They've now done that and more.  We see black and white footage of the participants, and each is interviewed separately, so in a time-lapsed fashion we see what their ideals and dreams are and how their lives turn out.  (After their seventh year, the rest of the film is done in color.)  Many interviewees become put off by their questioning, but every turn seems to bring about self-revealing initiatives about the careers, lives, and loves of key people.

1015541,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000HRMATA,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[8, 28]","I came into this film totally cold as far as the Up Series is concerned. So I had no connection to these people and no context for their situations. This does not end up causing me any problems at all because director Michael Apted comprises this film of about 50% new material and 50% old material from previous films. I certainly don't get to see these people grow up organically as I would have had I watched the films in order. But instead I get a nifty CliffNotes version that fills in all the important blanks. 49 may not be the most exciting age to be as most of these people have settled into their family lives, but thanks to some movie magic I get to see exactly how they got there. In the future I look forward to going back and watching all the other films in the series, but even if you are like me and have never seen any others you can still enjoy this one because I certainly did. It is incredibly interesting and definitely worth checking out. One thing that really struck me was just how similar their lives turned out. At the beginning of ""Trainspotting"" Ewan McGregor's character says ""Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family,"" and that is exactly what these people did. And that is fine, these people weren't delusional, they just wanted to find happiness and for better or for worse that is how they found it. They almost all turned out to be decent human beings with the exception being one woman who launches into a scorching tirade against Apted and the project in general. She seems upset about editing in his previous films, but it took no CGI here to make her look downright certifiable. Of course the rich kids stayed rich and the poor kids stayed poor, but that is the whole point of the series. You don't just play the hand you're dealt, you are the hand you're dealt.All of this is far more interesting than it ever should be. These are regular people with regular lives. I do believe that the film is hurt by Apted's line of questioning as it is soft and generic. He could have asked them about timely matters such as world events or politics, those things can tell us as much about a person as their families or careers. Also, he was always pushing them to admit that they are lazy and not ambitious. Maybe he could have asked the business man if he felt as though he spent too much of his life at the office. It is also worth noting that Mother Nature was not kind to these people. The men got off easier than the women, but Nick was the only one who seems to have improved looks wise over time. The film unconsciously asks the question if we are all doomed to become fat and domestic, and then they answer it with a resounding yes. But maybe I'm being too hard on these people. 21 is obviously a more turbulent time than 49 and we can't all be stallions forever. But with age they have picked up a real distaste for this project. A few of them even try to call out the viewers for being voyeuristic, but what person watching this film isn't already aware of that? These people at least have the option to opt out of the project (as 2 have already done), but what about those poor saps on ""Cops"" who are forced to live out their most humiliating moment on network TV? If I can gulp that down and not feel any guilt then these people don't stand a chance. Maybe if they had posed that question a few decades ago, you know, before the reality TV craze, then maybe people would have listened. But as it is they are now just another exhibit in the freak show that is our culture. ***1/2",3,Picking Through Other People's Lives,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,3537,"['came', 'film', 'totally', 'cold', 'as', 'far', 'Up', 'Series', 'concerned', 'had', 'connection', 'people', 'context', 'situations', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'causing', 'problems', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'film', 'about', '50', '%', 'new', 'material', '50', '%', 'old', 'material', 'previous', 'films', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'people', 'grow', 'up', 'organically', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'watched', 'films', 'order', 'instead', 'get', 'nifty', 'CliffNotes', 'version', 'important', 'blanks', '49', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'exciting', 'age', 'be', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'settled', 'family', 'thanks', 'movie', 'magic', 'get', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'future', 'look', 'forward', 'going', 'back', 'watching', 'other', 'films', 'series', 'even', 'are', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'others', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'one', 'certainly', 'did', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'struck', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'similar', 'lives', 'turned', 'out', 'beginning', 'Trainspotting', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'character', 'Choose', 'Life', 'Choose', 'job', 'Choose', 'career', 'Choose', 'family', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'did', 'fine', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'delusional', 'just', 'wanted', 'find', 'happiness', 'better', 'worse', 'how', 'found', 'almost', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'decent', 'human', 'beings', 'exception', 'being', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'scorching', 'tirade', 'Apted', 'project', 'general', 'upset', 'editing', 'previous', 'films', 'took', 'CGI', 'here', 'make', 'look', 'downright', 'certifiable', 'course', 'rich', 'kids', 'stayed', 'rich', 'poor', 'kids', 'stayed', 'poor', 'whole', 'point', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'hand', ""'re"", 'dealt', 'are', 'hand', ""'re"", 'dealt.All', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'ever', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'regular', 'people', 'regular', 'lives', 'do', 'believe', 'film', 'hurt', 'Apted', 'line', 'questioning', 'soft', 'generic', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'timely', 'matters', 'such', 'world', 'events', 'politics', 'things', 'can', 'tell', 'as', 'much', 'person', 'families', 'careers', 'Also', 'was', 'always', 'pushing', 'admit', 'are', 'lazy', 'not', 'ambitious', 'Maybe', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'business', 'man', 'felt', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'life', 'office', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'was', 'not', 'kind', 'people', 'men', 'got', 'off', 'easier', 'women', 'Nick', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'improved', 'looks', 'wise', 'time', 'film', 'unconsciously', 'question', 'are', 'doomed', 'become', 'fat', 'domestic', 'then', 'answer', 'resounding', 'yes', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'people', '21', 'obviously', 'more', 'turbulent', 'time', '49', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'stallions', 'forever', 'age', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'real', 'distaste', 'project', 'few', 'even', 'try', 'call', 'out', 'viewers', 'being', 'voyeuristic', 'what', 'person', 'watching', 'film', ""n't"", 'already', 'aware', 'people', 'least', 'have', 'option', 'opt', 'project', '2', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'what', 'poor', 'saps', 'Cops', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'out', 'most', 'humiliating', 'moment', 'network', 'TV', 'can', 'gulp', 'down', 'not', 'feel', 'guilt', 'then', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Maybe', 'had', 'posed', 'question', 'few', 'decades', 'ago', 'know', 'reality', 'TV', 'craze', 'then', 'maybe', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'listened', 'are', 'now', 'just', 'exhibit', 'freak', 'show', 'culture', '***1/2']",49 Up
1015542,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000HRMATA,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","Yes, he did it again! One of the great filmic projects of the 20th Century, Michael Apted's The Up Series, makes its entr&eacute;e into the new millennium with the seventh bravura installment of its documentary format. Although shown on British television over the last four decades, viewers in other parts of the world have usually had to see it on the big screen, in local arts and independent theaters. Late this year, the DVD of the 49 Up was released in America, just a few weeks after its theatrical release, and it's a worthwhile successor to earlier films. While the series' participants wax bitterly, on occasions, many wax philosophically, displaying one of the series' greatest virtues- showing that the average person is not necessarily as doltish as modern reality television would lead you to believe. Given an opportunity to reflect, average folks can stumble upon real wisdom, rather than the Lowest Common Denominator stupidity that American `reality' shows like Survivor or Fear Factor highlight. Of course, neither of those shows is reality- they are merely staged gimmick shows. The Up Series is `real reality,' and no, there won't be a new episode in a week's time to appease the speed addicted MTV mindset. It'll take seven long years before the next entry pulls into port.The series began as the brainchild of the Left Wing ITV television show World In Action, made by Granada Television, which in 1964 sought out typical school children from the lower and upper classes of English life. Back then, the class system in Merry Olde England was noteworthy, as the voiceover intoned, `The executive and the shop steward of the year 2000 are seven years old,' but by the third installment, 21 Up- in 1978, the lives of these ordinary people took precedence over political posturing, and the series was firmly in control of co-producer Apted- director of The World Is Not Enough, Coal Miner's Daughter, and Gorillas In The Mist, who was merely an assistant on the original Seven Up. The motto of the series has always been the notion espoused by a Jesuit proverb: `Give me a child until he is seven, and I will give you the man.' That seems to have proven a durable- if not infallible, wisdom....Some viewers and critics feel that this should be the last episode. I disagree, for people like that are injecting a `purpose' into the films, rather than extracting one out of them. This is often a problem with news coverage in any field. Centuries and eons from now, this series will be a Rosetta Stone- despite the immense tracking of our culture via printed media, films, radio, television, and the Internet, for it was the first one to focus on average people, whatever their backgrounds. These participants will become icons who are studied and debated long after most of their peers are dust; a fact which may explain their reluctance to appear in it, but not excuse it, for the nobler option is almost always to serve the betterment of all. Is a few minutes onscreen glimpse into real reality that much of a loathsome burden?By 56 Up, it would not shock me if the first death occurs within the fourteen- I just get a sense of it- perhaps Lynn or Jackie, or perhaps some tragedy, so that sense makes each episode with all of them all the more meaningful. The series, as a whole, and this installment, shows that there is a great nobility in utility, which is best summed up by wisdom that Bruce imparts: `When dreams go and the day to day living of ordinary life and family life takes over, I think we just sort of live without our dreams.' In what other medium does the offhanded poesy that too much fictive art misses come so vividly to life? Where else do people show off the best in themselves- an ability to cogitate, reason, empathize, and reflect, rather than the worst- their own petty envies and lusts?....The reason why the series touches so many others is precisely because they lack such things as artistic talent or a platform to be seen. If I can be so moved, merely by the memory of watching the earlier installments of this film, I have to believe that most of the participants- whom we all know and refer to by their first names, as they age and wise up a bit more, will see that they, too, have been touched by something greater than anything their lives, alone can signify. And the fact that their touching will last long beyond flesh on flesh is something anyone reading this review, now or in the far future, can be thankful for.",5,Apted's opus for humanity,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,4470,"['Yes', 'did', 'again', 'One', 'great', 'filmic', 'projects', '20th', 'Century', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'Up', 'Series', 'entr', 'eacute', 'new', 'millennium', 'seventh', 'bravura', 'installment', 'documentary', 'format', 'shown', 'British', 'television', 'last', 'four', 'decades', 'viewers', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'have', 'usually', 'had', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'local', 'arts', 'independent', 'theaters', 'Late', 'year', 'DVD', '49', 'Up', 'was', 'released', 'America', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'theatrical', 'release', 'worthwhile', 'successor', 'earlier', 'films', 'series', 'participants', 'wax', 'bitterly', 'occasions', 'many', 'wax', 'philosophically', 'displaying', 'one', 'series', 'greatest', 'virtues-', 'showing', 'average', 'person', 'not', 'necessarily', 'as', 'doltish', 'modern', 'reality', 'television', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'Given', 'opportunity', 'reflect', 'average', 'folks', 'can', 'stumble', 'upon', 'real', 'wisdom', 'rather', 'Lowest', 'Common', 'Denominator', 'stupidity', 'American', 'reality', 'shows', 'Survivor', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'highlight', 'course', 'shows', 'reality-', 'are', 'merely', 'staged', 'gimmick', 'shows', 'Up', 'Series', 'real', 'reality', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'new', 'episode', 'week', 'time', 'appease', 'speed', 'addicted', 'MTV', 'mindset', ""'ll"", 'take', 'seven', 'long', 'years', 'next', 'entry', 'port.The', 'series', 'began', 'brainchild', 'Left', 'Wing', 'ITV', 'television', 'show', 'World', 'Action', 'made', 'Granada', 'Television', '1964', 'sought', 'out', 'typical', 'school', 'children', 'lower', 'upper', 'classes', 'English', 'life', 'Back', 'then', 'class', 'system', 'Merry', 'Olde', 'England', 'was', 'noteworthy', 'voiceover', 'intoned', 'executive', 'shop', 'steward', 'year', '2000', 'are', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'third', 'installment', '21', 'Up-', '1978', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people', 'took', 'precedence', 'political', 'posturing', 'series', 'was', 'firmly', 'control', 'co-producer', 'Apted-', 'director', 'World', 'Not', 'Enough', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', 'who', 'was', 'merely', 'assistant', 'original', 'Seven', 'Up', 'motto', 'series', 'always', 'been', 'notion', 'espoused', 'Jesuit', 'proverb', 'Give', 'child', 'seven', 'will', 'give', 'man', 'have', 'proven', 'durable-', 'not', 'infallible', 'wisdom', '.Some', 'viewers', 'critics', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'last', 'episode', 'disagree', 'people', 'are', 'injecting', 'purpose', 'films', 'rather', 'extracting', 'one', 'often', 'problem', 'news', 'coverage', 'field', 'Centuries', 'eons', 'now', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'Rosetta', 'Stone-', 'immense', 'tracking', 'culture', 'printed', 'media', 'films', 'radio', 'television', 'Internet', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'focus', 'average', 'people', 'backgrounds', 'participants', 'will', 'become', 'icons', 'who', 'are', 'studied', 'debated', 'long', 'most', 'peers', 'are', 'dust', 'fact', 'may', 'explain', 'reluctance', 'appear', 'not', 'excuse', 'nobler', 'option', 'almost', 'always', 'serve', 'betterment', 'few', 'minutes', 'onscreen', 'glimpse', 'real', 'reality', 'much', 'loathsome', 'burden', '56', 'Up', 'would', 'not', 'shock', 'first', 'death', 'occurs', 'fourteen-', 'just', 'get', 'sense', 'it-', 'perhaps', 'Lynn', 'Jackie', 'perhaps', 'tragedy', 'sense', 'episode', 'more', 'meaningful', 'series', 'whole', 'installment', 'great', 'nobility', 'utility', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'wisdom', 'Bruce', 'imparts', 'When', 'dreams', 'go', 'day', 'day', 'living', 'ordinary', 'life', 'family', 'life', 'think', 'just', 'sort', 'live', 'dreams', 'what', 'other', 'medium', 'offhanded', 'poesy', 'too', 'much', 'fictive', 'art', 'come', 'so', 'vividly', 'life', 'Where', 'else', 'do', 'people', 'show', 'off', 'best', 'themselves-', 'ability', 'cogitate', 'reason', 'empathize', 'reflect', 'rather', 'worst-', 'own', 'petty', 'envies', 'lusts', 'reason', 'why', 'series', 'touches', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'precisely', 'lack', 'such', 'things', 'artistic', 'talent', 'platform', 'be', 'seen', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'moved', 'merely', 'memory', 'watching', 'earlier', 'installments', 'film', 'have', 'believe', 'most', 'participants-', 'whom', 'know', 'refer', 'first', 'names', 'age', 'wise', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'will', 'see', 'too', 'have', 'been', 'touched', 'something', 'greater', 'anything', 'lives', 'alone', 'can', 'signify', 'fact', 'touching', 'will', 'last', 'long', 'flesh', 'flesh', 'something', 'anyone', 'reading', 'review', 'now', 'far', 'future', 'can', 'be', 'thankful']",49 Up
1015543,A3S6YZMZLUSLM0,B000HRMATA,Dean A. Anderson,"[2, 2]","I've read about this series for years but just never got around to watching any of them. The first film was made in 1964 and was titled 7 Up. It featured a group of seven- year old English school children from different schools, locations and social classes. (Some were from public schools and some were from private schools, which leads to ongoing confusion for me since in England a public school is what we would call a private school and vice versa.)Apted was 22 years old when he made the first film, and he thought it would be a one time project. But he continued to make a film every seven years, featuring the same people profiled in the first film (though some have dropped out of the project over the years).49 Up is the film I watched, and it features footage from all the projects made through the years (7 Up, 14 Up, 21 Up, 28 Up, 35 Up, and 42 Up). One of the subjects of the films, John, wonders if the whole thing is just an elaborate exercise in reality TV, but it certainly is much more.The film captures the idealism of childhood that is often crushed by the realities of the world. It is interesting to see how the filmmaker also had preconceptions that are crushed through the years in much the same way.In the first film Apted quotes the Jesuits who said, ""Show me a boy at seven I give you the man."" Some of the children make predictions about their lives that are uncannily accurate (Andrew, for instance, at seven years old predicts the schools he will attend and his profession as a solicitor). But some of the kids defy expectations. Some kids from broken homes fear relationships, but go on to build good marriages and become good parents. Some make foolish mistakes and spoil their childhood dreams and potential.One interesting theme is the importance of one's roots as an adult. Nick leaves England and moves to the States.  The filmmakers take him back to his homeland for this edition of the film. The landscape of the country of his youth was the cold and harsh moors of northern England. He says he does not miss this land but then, when he sees it, he is moved. He says that other locations seem insignificant in comparison.Most of the subjects talk about how painful it can be to have their lives captured on film every seven years and have it broadcast (on the BBC as well as in the movie theaters) for millions to see. Jackie brings up the unfair nature of a filmmaker's option to pick and choose the segments of their interviews he will use, and feels that she and others have been treated unfairly. Suzy tells Apted she believes 49 will be her last time to participate.The films remind me of the moment in Annie Hall when children in a classroom stand up and say what they will do in their later lives (one elementary school student in that film stands and says, ""I will become a heroin addict and die of an overdose"".)When we look at children, we don't like to think about the trials they will inevitably face in the years to come. But we also can't conceive of the wonderful things they will do in the future.One of the kids, John, at seven is a child of privilege who talks with his friends about how good it is that his school is expensive, because otherwise poor children would flood in and his classes would be too crowded. You think this kid will grow to be one of the upper class twits so successfully lampooned by Monty Python. To a degree, you'd be right. He goes on to be a barrister who looks quite a bit like Mr. Bean.But there is more to his story. He was drawn to the woman he married by a shared concern for the poor in the Eastern Europe. The reason he continues to do the film series is to draw attention to the educational and medical needs in Bulgaria.John is not alone. We see other children grow to be very good men and women who care for their families and for the needs of the less fortunate.The most poignant segment of the film is about Neil, a bright young kid whose life takes some nasty turns. As a teen, he says he doubts there is a God. At seven, he had dreams of college and career, but he later drops out of school and has trouble finding work. He becomes homeless and admits to questioning his own sanity. In 35 Up, one might have questioned whether the man will even be alive in the next film. But in 49 Up we see a very different man. Little is said about religion in the segments on most of the characters, but Neil in this film has found Jesus. And it has made all the difference in the world.49 Up came out in 2006. I would now like to see six other films. And I'm looking forward to 2013.",4,A Documentary Sequel,1227916800,"11 29, 2008",2008,4569,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'series', 'years', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1964', 'was', 'titled', '7', 'Up', 'featured', 'group', 'seven-', 'year', 'old', 'English', 'school', 'children', 'different', 'schools', 'locations', 'social', 'classes', 'were', 'public', 'schools', 'were', 'private', 'schools', 'ongoing', 'confusion', 'England', 'public', 'school', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'private', 'school', 'vice', 'versa', 'Apted', 'was', '22', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'project', 'continued', 'make', 'film', 'seven', 'years', 'featuring', 'same', 'people', 'profiled', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'dropped', 'project', 'years', '.49', 'Up', 'film', 'watched', 'footage', 'projects', 'made', 'years', '7', 'Up', '14', 'Up', '21', 'Up', '28', 'Up', '35', 'Up', '42', 'Up', 'One', 'subjects', 'films', 'John', 'wonders', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'elaborate', 'exercise', 'reality', 'TV', 'certainly', 'much', 'more.The', 'film', 'idealism', 'childhood', 'often', 'crushed', 'realities', 'world', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'filmmaker', 'also', 'had', 'preconceptions', 'are', 'crushed', 'years', 'much', 'same', 'way.In', 'first', 'film', 'Apted', 'Jesuits', 'who', 'said', 'Show', 'boy', 'seven', 'give', 'man', 'children', 'make', 'predictions', 'lives', 'are', 'uncannily', 'accurate', 'Andrew', 'instance', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'schools', 'will', 'attend', 'profession', 'solicitor', 'kids', 'defy', 'expectations', 'kids', 'broken', 'homes', 'fear', 'relationships', 'go', 'build', 'good', 'marriages', 'become', 'good', 'parents', 'make', 'foolish', 'mistakes', 'spoil', 'childhood', 'dreams', 'potential.One', 'interesting', 'theme', 'importance', 'one', 'roots', 'adult', 'Nick', 'England', 'moves', 'States', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'back', 'homeland', 'edition', 'film', 'landscape', 'country', 'youth', 'was', 'cold', 'harsh', 'moors', 'northern', 'England', 'not', 'miss', 'land', 'then', 'when', 'moved', 'other', 'locations', 'seem', 'insignificant', 'comparison.Most', 'subjects', 'talk', 'how', 'painful', 'can', 'be', 'have', 'lives', 'captured', 'film', 'seven', 'years', 'have', 'broadcast', 'BBC', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'theaters', 'millions', 'see', 'Jackie', 'up', 'unfair', 'nature', 'filmmaker', 'option', 'pick', 'choose', 'segments', 'interviews', 'will', 'use', 'feels', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'Suzy', 'Apted', '49', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'participate.The', 'films', 'remind', 'moment', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'when', 'children', 'classroom', 'stand', 'say', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'later', 'lives', 'one', 'elementary', 'school', 'student', 'film', 'stands', 'will', 'become', 'heroin', 'addict', 'die', 'overdose', 'When', 'look', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'trials', 'will', 'inevitably', 'face', 'years', 'come', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'wonderful', 'things', 'will', 'do', 'future.One', 'kids', 'John', 'seven', 'child', 'privilege', 'who', 'friends', 'how', 'good', 'school', 'expensive', 'otherwise', 'poor', 'children', 'would', 'flood', 'classes', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'crowded', 'think', 'kid', 'will', 'grow', 'be', 'one', 'upper', 'class', 'twits', 'so', 'successfully', 'lampooned', 'Monty', 'Python', 'degree', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'be', 'barrister', 'who', 'quite', 'bit', 'Mr.', 'Bean.But', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'drawn', 'woman', 'married', 'shared', 'concern', 'poor', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'reason', 'do', 'film', 'series', 'draw', 'attention', 'educational', 'medical', 'needs', 'Bulgaria.John', 'not', 'alone', 'see', 'other', 'children', 'grow', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'care', 'families', 'needs', 'less', 'fortunate.The', 'most', 'poignant', 'segment', 'film', 'Neil', 'bright', 'young', 'kid', 'life', 'nasty', 'turns', 'teen', 'doubts', 'God', 'seven', 'had', 'dreams', 'college', 'career', 'later', 'school', 'trouble', 'finding', 'work', 'homeless', 'admits', 'questioning', 'own', 'sanity', '35', 'Up', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'questioned', 'man', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'alive', 'next', 'film', '49', 'see', 'very', 'different', 'man', 'Little', 'said', 'religion', 'segments', 'most', 'characters', 'Neil', 'film', 'found', 'Jesus', 'made', 'difference', 'world.49', 'Up', 'came', 'out', '2006', 'would', 'now', 'like', 'see', 'six', 'other', 'films', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', '2013']",49 Up

Also, being an American viewer, my awareness of the class struggle (greatly emphasized here from the perspective of Apted's British ""stars,"" so to speak) is quite different and, in many ways, the subject of the Briton relationship to class was a bit like a foreign language.  What's more, this was the seventh in his ""Up!"" series, and the characters that some people had known over the years, have settled into their middle age (some more gracefully than others).What worked so well, here, was the great sensitivity and attention to detail that Michael Apted clearly had, when providing archived clips from the previous films, as well as bringing the viewers up to speed with the subjects, their marriages (and divorces), children, career changes and the parallel between their views, feelings and perceptions as seven year old children, progressing all the way into their middle age at 49.  We see a great cross section of the public, portrayed on film, in the ""case studies"" of his subjects.  There's everything from the snooty upper class (three young boys who are all attending private academies, looking down on those from lower stock, and basically continuing their perpetual feelings of superiority into middle age), to young men who grew up in a children's home together (one, the product of a single parent home--the only example of this in the movie).There are great humorous moments here, as well as insightful and very poignant points that really make the subjects out to be human, just like the rest of us.  The accessiblity into their lives, hearts and inner most secrets could come off as voyeuristic.  Instead, Apted very sensitively presents the ups, downs, triumphs and tribulations with grace and class.  I highly reccomend this.",5,brilliant and compelling....,1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,1949,"['When', 'saw', '49', 'Up', 'theaters', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'previous', 'episodes', 'series', 'came', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'context', 'place', 'director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'subjects', 'Also', 'being', 'American', 'viewer', 'awareness', 'class', 'struggle', 'greatly', 'emphasized', 'here', 'perspective', 'Apted', 'British', 'stars', 'so', 'speak', 'quite', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'subject', 'Briton', 'relationship', 'class', 'was', 'bit', 'foreign', 'language', 'What', 'more', 'was', 'seventh', 'series', 'characters', 'people', 'had', 'known', 'years', 'have', 'settled', 'middle', 'age', 'more', 'gracefully', 'others', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'here', 'was', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'attention', 'detail', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'clearly', 'had', 'when', 'providing', 'archived', 'clips', 'previous', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'bringing', 'viewers', 'up', 'speed', 'subjects', 'marriages', 'divorces', 'children', 'career', 'changes', 'parallel', 'views', 'feelings', 'perceptions', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'children', 'progressing', 'way', 'middle', 'age', '49', 'see', 'great', 'cross', 'section', 'public', 'portrayed', 'film', 'case', 'studies', 'subjects', 'everything', 'snooty', 'upper', 'class', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'attending', 'private', 'academies', 'looking', 'down', 'lower', 'stock', 'basically', 'continuing', 'perpetual', 'feelings', 'superiority', 'middle', 'age', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'children', 'home', 'together', 'one', 'product', 'single', 'parent', 'home', 'only', 'example', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'humorous', 'moments', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'insightful', 'very', 'poignant', 'points', 'really', 'make', 'subjects', 'out', 'be', 'human', 'just', 'rest', 'accessiblity', 'lives', 'hearts', 'most', 'secrets', 'could', 'come', 'off', 'voyeuristic', 'Instead', 'Apted', 'very', 'sensitively', 'ups', 'downs', 'triumphs', 'tribulations', 'grace', 'class', 'highly', 'reccomend']",49 Up

Gentile,"[2, 20]","Documentaries are usually my favorite form of the medium, and I often very much like ones about subject matter that I have no general interest in, if they are well done. I can't honestly say this film isn't necessarily well done, but..it bored me into a stupor. I tend to like old fashioned, simple things..and often quote the  comment attributed to Andy Warhol...""I like boring things."" But, after approximately an hour and 1/2, I had to stop this film, before the remote fell from my numb hand and while I could still move my neck. With the glowing reviews by not only major critics, but, the reviews posted here on Amazon, I expected to be warmed, transfixed, educated, and generally moved by this film. I wasn't looking for sensationalism, and the prospect of seeing ""normal"" lives evolve, rather than the fake and shallow exploits of some heiress, was definately promising. But, for me, these chosen folks, while perfectly nice and mostly affable people, had the most boring, generic, ""average"" lives imaginable.  It had all the appeal of choosing any randomly chosen person/family, and turning on the camera and letting them ramble on and on about ther lives, and, let's face it, most lives are not the stuff of engrossing drama or lesson. I kept waiting for the high points, the life altering epiphanies, the triumphs, the tragedies, all resulting in the lessons learned for us all to share. Instead, I get monotonous daily monologues about children, grandchildren, work, life, your basic disappointments like divorce, etc...and, I found them all to be ""flatliners.""  Not being at all a fan of talk shows where so called normal people air their dirtiest laundry, I was ready for a refreshing take and the life altering appreciation promised on the dvd's cover, , but instead I got what was for me a mind numbing disappointment. I have been more moved by an episode of  ""Behind The Music""  than by this leaden,  non offensive but soporific film. Clearly I am in the minority in my opinion of this film, so, maybe it's me.

1015546,A2A0U27BHHWOES,B000HRMATA,G. Bestick,"[60, 60]","The 7 Up project started in 1963 as a Granada Films documentary about seven year old British children.  Director Michael Apted, himself only in his early twenties, set out to explore the British class system by interviewing youngsters from different economic backgrounds.  The film's hook was the old Jesuit saying, ""Show me the child until seven, and I will show you the man.""  Remarkably, Apted has gone back every seven years and updated his interviews with the dozen or so children he started with.  49 Up is the latest installment.If you only watch  49 Up, you'll get enough back story to know who these people are, but the most satisfying approach is to go through the documentaries in the order they were shot.  We are voyeurs in the lives of: Andrew, John and Suzie, upper-class kids who knew early on who they were and what they would do;  Simon and Paul, abandoned by their mothers and raised in an orphanage;  Jackie, Sue and Lynne, working class girls from London's East End; Nick and Neil, middle class kids with an intellectual bent; Tony, a lively, lovable Cockney; and Bruce, who moves up and down the class ladder.  The films prove that you can see the man or woman who will emerge in the child of seven.  Their personalities are set; all that's unknown are the circumstances under which their lives will play out.These are ordinary people; the genius of the series is that they become particular enough to us over the course of the films to feel special.  We care about them, and what happens to them.  At 49, the group seems much happier than they were in the previous two films.  Most of them have passed through the trauma of losing their parents, and they've made peace with career successes and setbacks.  In general, they now accept who they are; they're not fighting it or struggling to figure it out.Class plays less of a role in these lives than the filmmakers initially thought it would.  Partly that's an accident of timing.  1963, when these children were seven, turned out to be a watershed year in Britain: the old wartime mentality was ending, the Beatles were beginning, and there was a sense of new possibilities in the air.  Between the sense of new opportunity and the economic entitlements of the various Labour governments, even the most disadvantaged of these children managed to carve out a reasonable lifestyle.  Temperament, more than economics, determined their fates.Apted has a gift for balancing objectivity about these people (he asks some tough questions) and compassion for them.  It they didn't trust him, the series would have ended a long time ago.  He doesn't ask a lot of topical or political questions, so the temporal and trivial are stripped away.  What's left are moving images of people born in the middle of the twentieth century.  Watching them, we learn how they've faced the big issues of being human: dealing with their parents and upbringing; puberty; being open to the possibility of love; mating and breeding; finding their place in the world; the death of near and dear ones.  Of course, watching them is like watching ourselves.  Learning about them is learning about ourselves.  I'm rooting for all of them, and looking forward to seeing how they're faring at fifty six.",4,The Skull Beneath the Skin,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,3241,"['7', 'Up', 'project', 'started', '1963', 'Granada', 'Films', 'documentary', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'British', 'children', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'only', 'early', 'twenties', 'set', 'out', 'explore', 'British', 'class', 'system', 'interviewing', 'youngsters', 'different', 'economic', 'backgrounds', 'film', 'hook', 'was', 'old', 'Jesuit', 'saying', 'Show', 'child', 'seven', 'will', 'show', 'man', 'Remarkably', 'Apted', 'gone', 'back', 'seven', 'years', 'updated', 'interviews', 'dozen', 'so', 'children', 'started', '49', 'Up', 'latest', 'installment.If', 'only', 'watch', '49', 'Up', ""'ll"", 'get', 'enough', 'back', 'story', 'know', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'most', 'satisfying', 'approach', 'go', 'documentaries', 'order', 'were', 'shot', 'are', 'voyeurs', 'lives', 'Andrew', 'John', 'Suzie', 'upper-class', 'kids', 'who', 'knew', 'early', 'who', 'were', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Simon', 'Paul', 'abandoned', 'mothers', 'raised', 'orphanage', 'Jackie', 'Sue', 'Lynne', 'working', 'class', 'girls', 'London', 'East', 'End', 'Nick', 'Neil', 'middle', 'class', 'kids', 'intellectual', 'bent', 'Tony', 'lively', 'lovable', 'Cockney', 'Bruce', 'who', 'up', 'class', 'ladder', 'films', 'prove', 'can', 'see', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'emerge', 'child', 'seven', 'personalities', 'are', 'set', 'unknown', 'are', 'circumstances', 'lives', 'will', 'play', 'out.These', 'are', 'ordinary', 'people', 'genius', 'series', 'become', 'particular', 'enough', 'course', 'films', 'feel', 'special', 'care', 'what', '49', 'group', 'much', 'happier', 'were', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'Most', 'have', 'passed', 'trauma', 'losing', 'parents', ""'ve"", 'made', 'peace', 'career', 'successes', 'setbacks', 'general', 'now', 'accept', 'who', 'are', ""'re"", 'not', 'fighting', 'struggling', 'figure', 'out.Class', 'less', 'role', 'lives', 'filmmakers', 'initially', 'thought', 'would', 'Partly', 'accident', 'timing', '1963', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'seven', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'watershed', 'year', 'Britain', 'old', 'wartime', 'mentality', 'was', 'ending', 'Beatles', 'were', 'beginning', 'there', 'was', 'sense', 'new', 'possibilities', 'air', 'sense', 'new', 'opportunity', 'economic', 'entitlements', 'various', 'Labour', 'governments', 'even', 'most', 'disadvantaged', 'children', 'managed', 'carve', 'out', 'reasonable', 'lifestyle', 'Temperament', 'more', 'economics', 'determined', 'fates.Apted', 'gift', 'balancing', 'objectivity', 'people', 'tough', 'questions', 'compassion', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'long', 'time', 'ago', ""n't"", 'ask', 'lot', 'topical', 'political', 'questions', 'temporal', 'trivial', 'are', 'stripped', 'away', 'What', 'left', 'are', 'moving', 'images', 'people', 'born', 'middle', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Watching', 'learn', 'how', ""'ve"", 'faced', 'big', 'issues', 'being', 'human', 'dealing', 'parents', 'upbringing', 'puberty', 'being', 'open', 'possibility', 'love', 'mating', 'breeding', 'finding', 'place', 'world', 'death', 'near', 'dear', 'ones', 'course', 'watching', 'watching', 'Learning', 'learning', ""'m"", 'rooting', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', ""'re"", 'faring', 'fifty', 'six']",49 Up

We are drawn to these characters because they seem parodoxical and contradictory.  Roger Ebert mentioned in the interview that at one point, Micheal Apted was concerned that Tony would wind up being a criminal.  Just look at Tony now!

There is something so incredibly fascinating about seeing how these kids turned (and will turn) out. The most amazing thing about it, for me, is that every single one of them became a decent, responsible, thoughtful human being, and that has nothing to do with class or economics, as the film proves.  I am so touched at their incredible idealism, their faith, their intelligence, and their grace.  Each one of them still has a beautiful, beaming countenance, except, of course, for Neil.  That said, it is Neil whom I really connect with.  He was perhaps, in my mind, the most beautiful of the children, with an almost otherworldly innocence about him that is sublime.Watching this installment, I  wished I could go back in time and protect him from the slings and arrows he would face as an adult.  He turned out to be the most troubled of the group, and I can't help thinking that he was almost ""too good for this world,"" as they say, a quality that showed up early.  Still, what he has done with his life at this time is remarkable; he is giving both social and spiritual service to others, and what else is there, really, for a person to be able to say ""I gave my best""?  He has the mind of a philosopher, and I wonder if he writes poetry. I love his beautiful, suffering face.  He's actually very handsome, and I wish he would find a wonderful woman who could make his life a little less lonely, as have the other males in the series.  All in all, it's an extremely loveable group of people.  I can't wait to visit with them again, but I have a bit of guilt about that, because some of them indicated that the filming is a huge intrusion on their privacy - their lives - and, as one of them said, ""It opens up a can of worms every seven years "" (or something like that, old wounds, etc.).  I guess I would like to say ""Thank you!"" to each of them, for giving us a glimpse into their lives, which, in a sense, is a glimpse into ours.  And also - thank you for being good role models.

There's no way to watchthis remarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's ownlife, and how you have changed (and stayed the same) over your ownlifetime.While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for thisamazing piece of cultural anthropology, it's important to note the first film,7 Up,was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was a that point aresearcher for the project.",5,Unique and amazing series of films,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,905,"[""'Up"", 'Series', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'unusual', 'usesof', 'film', 'cinema', 'history', 'documentary', 'life-long', 'chronicle', 'thelives', '14', 'people', 'starting', '7', 'years', 'old', 'revisiting', 'sevenyears', 'age', '49', 'so', 'far', 'could', 'quibble', 'wishing', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'here', 'there', 'especially', 'women', 'where', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'emphasison', 'love', 'marriage', 'expense', 'else', 'really', 'astounding', 'moving', 'frightening', 'uplifting', 'document', 'way', 'watchthis', 'remarkable', 'series', 'films', 'reflecting', 'deeply', 'one', 'ownlife', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'stayed', 'same', 'ownlifetime.While', 'Michael', 'Aped', 'bit', 'credit', 'received', 'thisamazing', 'piece', 'cultural', 'anthropology', 'important', 'note', 'first', 'film,7', 'Up', 'was', 'actually', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Almond', 'Apted', 'was', 'point', 'aresearcher', 'project']",49 Up

1015553,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B000HRMATA,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[42, 45]","I started watching Michael Apted's ongoing documentary series in 1971 when Apted's first film (the second in the series, but first directed by Apted) ""14 UP"" was shown in US theaters. I remember seeing ""21 UP"" as well but then missed the next series of films until this year when ""49 UP"" was released.""Give me a child until he is seven, and I will give you the man,"" goes a Jesuit proverb, which the 'Up' documentaries quote. At seven year intervals Director Apted revisited 14 children in his native country of Britain. This was early ""reality TV"" before the concept was given a name. While the children were from so-called ""diverse"" backgrounds, they were mostly economic diverse rather than ethnically diverse. All but one are Caucasian. What is amazing is that all 14 are still living at age 49 and, though one woman has said that she doesn't wish to continue to participate in the series, all 14 are covered in this most recent chapter of the series.The most important thing to know is that this film stands on it's own and does not require watching the previous chapters. Director Apted uses enough footage from the prior films to, not only bring you up to date, but to show you immediate similarities to what the ""kids"" looked like as they grew older. Though I may go back to the films I missed, I didn't feel that it was necessary.At over 2 hours in length, this is not a short film but it will hold your attention.As a bonus the DVD adds a 30 minute interview with Director Apted and film critic Roger Ebert. This only adds to the enjoyment of the DVD. Strangely, what sounds like an air conditioner running in the background (or it could be just poor miking) runs through the interview that was recorded in June 2006. This is a minor defect as it's the feature film you will be watching and the sound on that is perfect.You remember these 14 people long after you watch this film. It'll be another 7 years before the next film is made - (How does Apted keep track of where these folks are over the years?) - and I, for one am anxious to see what road their lives will take by the time it's ready for Apted to film ""56 UP"".",5,Reality TV years before the genre was given a name!,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,2132,"['started', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'ongoing', 'documentary', 'series', '1971', 'when', 'Apted', 'first', 'film', 'second', 'series', 'first', 'directed', 'Apted', '14', 'UP', 'was', 'shown', 'US', 'theaters', 'remember', 'seeing', '21', 'UP', 'well', 'then', 'missed', 'next', 'series', 'films', 'year', 'when', '49', 'UP', 'was', 'released', 'Give', 'child', 'seven', 'will', 'give', 'man', 'Jesuit', 'proverb', ""'Up"", 'documentaries', 'quote', 'seven', 'year', 'intervals', 'Director', 'Apted', 'revisited', '14', 'children', 'native', 'country', 'Britain', 'was', 'early', 'reality', 'TV', 'concept', 'was', 'given', 'name', 'children', 'were', 'so-called', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'mostly', 'economic', 'diverse', 'rather', 'ethnically', 'diverse', 'one', 'are', 'Caucasian', 'What', 'amazing', '14', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'age', '49', 'one', 'woman', 'said', ""n't"", 'wish', 'continue', 'participate', 'series', '14', 'are', 'covered', 'most', 'recent', 'chapter', 'series.The', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'know', 'film', 'own', 'not', 'require', 'watching', 'previous', 'chapters', 'Director', 'Apted', 'enough', 'footage', 'prior', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'bring', 'date', 'show', 'immediate', 'similarities', 'what', 'kids', 'looked', 'grew', 'older', 'may', 'go', 'back', 'films', 'missed', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'necessary.At', '2', 'hours', 'length', 'not', 'short', 'film', 'will', 'hold', 'attention.As', 'bonus', 'DVD', '30', 'minute', 'interview', 'Director', 'Apted', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'only', 'enjoyment', 'DVD', 'Strangely', 'what', 'air', 'conditioner', 'running', 'background', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'poor', 'miking', 'interview', 'was', 'recorded', 'June', '2006', 'minor', 'defect', 'feature', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'sound', 'perfect.You', 'remember', '14', 'people', 'long', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', '7', 'years', 'next', 'film', 'made', 'How', 'Apted', 'keep', 'track', 'where', 'folks', 'are', 'years', 'one', 'am', 'anxious', 'see', 'what', 'road', 'lives', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'ready', 'Apted', 'film', '56', 'UP']",49 Up

Unfortunately, I found the film incredibly predicable and boring.  Is it the participants' middle age?  They all seemed so much more alive and interesting in their earlier incarnations.The stand out among the people portrayed herein has always been Neil.  All the others seem to follow the same predicable path - settling down, marriage and children.  Yawn.  We do not watch a documentary to see people falling into well established patterns.  Neil characterizes himself by being a loner and by suffering with depression and/or mental illness.  He doesn't fit well into society and becomes homeless.  Later, Neil rebounds, becoming involved politically or in community affairs.  In 49 Up, we see Neil is involved in the church and is still without a partner.  His spartan lifestyle is somewhat subsidized by social welfare in order of living quarters.  While watching this, my heart went out to Neil, and his story resonated with me.Siouxie",3,Disappointing,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1070,"[""'ve"", 'followed', 'Michael', 'Apted', 'documentary', 'series', 'beginning', 'so', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'latest', 'installment', '49', 'Up', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'film', 'incredibly', 'predicable', 'boring', 'participants', 'middle', 'age', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'alive', 'interesting', 'earlier', 'incarnations.The', 'stand', 'people', 'portrayed', 'herein', 'always', 'been', 'Neil', 'others', 'seem', 'follow', 'same', 'predicable', 'path', 'settling', 'down', 'marriage', 'children', 'Yawn', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'documentary', 'see', 'people', 'falling', 'well', 'established', 'patterns', 'Neil', 'being', 'loner', 'suffering', 'depression', 'and/or', 'mental', 'illness', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'society', 'homeless', 'Later', 'Neil', 'becoming', 'involved', 'politically', 'community', 'affairs', '49', 'Up', 'see', 'Neil', 'involved', 'church', 'still', 'partner', 'spartan', 'lifestyle', 'somewhat', 'subsidized', 'social', 'welfare', 'order', 'living', 'quarters', 'watching', 'heart', 'went', 'Neil', 'story', 'resonated', 'me.Siouxie']",49 Up
