1550933,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B008DL4HWU,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[53, 53]","I have several DVDs in the Element series (e.g.,Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility,ElementL Total Body Pilates With Mini Ball, andElement: Pilates Weight Loss) and enjoy all of them, so I thought I might like this DVD.  This was my first experience with instructor Tamal Dodge.Like all of the Element offerings, this DVD contains two practices, both of which are set in a pretty outdoor garden setting.  Dodge is featured alone, teaching via voiceover, and the only prop needed is a yoga mat.  I have provided an overview of each practice below.YOGA FOR ENERGY (32 minutes)Dodge begins this practice standing, moving into a standing backbend.  He then performs half sun salutes.  Coming into downward dog, he moves through plank, dolphin, and forearm plank.  This is followed by a series which includes down dog to three-legged down dog, crescent pose, twisted side angle, warrior 2, reverse warrior 2/reverse triangle, side angle, and repeat reverse warrior 2.  Dodge holds each posture for several breaths, which is quite challenging; he then repeats the entire series on the second side.  Sitting on the heels, he performs breath of fire (two rounds) and belly breathing.  This is followed by a series of seated poses, including full seated forward bend, seated leg stretch, reverse plank, forward bend in butterfly, and crab (aka table).  Finishing postures include a lying stomach twist and an approximately 2 minutes in relaxation pose before concluding in a seated position.YOGA FOR RELAXATION (40 minutes)For this routine, Dodge begins seated to practice ujjayi breathing.  Next comes a series of stretches, including shoulder/elbow rolls, a side neck stretch, a back neck stretch, and head shakes/rolls to finish.  Dodge then comes to all fours for cat/cow and a modified child's pose.  Sitting back into child's pose, he moves into rabbit and thread-the-needle with a bind.  Dodge raises up into down dog with a calf stretch and then lowers down onto the belly for sphinx and crocodile poses.  The next series of stretches moves from down dog to half (kneeling) pyramid, pigeon pose, and then concludes in down dog with breath retention.  From seated, Dodge performs head-to-knee forward bend, butterfly, modified eagle (wrists and ankles crossed), and fire log pose.  To conclude this practice, Dodge lies down on his back for half happy babies pose, revolved stomach twist, and about 3.5 minutes of yoga nidra, or relaxation; he again ends in a seated position.Overall, I enjoyed both of these practices.  Although I consider myself to be at an intermediate level in yoga, I found the Energy practice to be challenging--not because the postures themselves were difficult, but because Dodge holds the poses for a significant amount of time.  On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the longer holds for the Relaxation practice.  I would recommend this DVD to someone who is experienced enough in yoga to be familiar with the postures and who does not have many flexibility limitations, as Dodge does not show modifications (although he is very encouraging to only do what you are able to do).  This is a very nice DVD, and I would rate it about 4 1/2 stars.",4,Two very nice yoga practices intended for those with some prior yoga experience,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,3179,"['have', 'several', 'DVDs', 'Element', 'series', 'e.g.', 'Element', 'Yoga', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'Flexibility', 'ElementL', 'Total', 'Body', 'Mini', 'Ball', 'andElement', 'Pilates', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'might', 'like', 'DVD', 'was', 'first', 'experience', 'instructor', 'Tamal', 'Dodge.Like', 'Element', 'offerings', 'DVD', 'two', 'practices', 'are', 'set', 'pretty', 'outdoor', 'garden', 'setting', 'Dodge', 'featured', 'alone', 'teaching', 'voiceover', 'only', 'prop', 'needed', 'yoga', 'mat', 'have', 'provided', 'overview', 'practice', 'below.YOGA', 'FOR', 'ENERGY', '32', 'minutes', 'Dodge', 'practice', 'standing', 'moving', 'standing', 'backbend', 'then', 'half', 'sun', 'salutes', 'Coming', 'downward', 'dog', 'plank', 'dolphin', 'forearm', 'plank', 'followed', 'series', 'down', 'dog', 'three-legged', 'down', 'dog', 'crescent', 'pose', 'twisted', 'side', 'angle', 'warrior', '2', 'reverse', 'warrior', '2/reverse', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'repeat', 'reverse', 'warrior', '2', 'Dodge', 'posture', 'several', 'breaths', 'quite', 'challenging', 'then', 'entire', 'series', 'second', 'side', 'Sitting', 'heels', 'breath', 'fire', 'two', 'rounds', 'belly', 'breathing', 'followed', 'series', 'seated', 'poses', 'including', 'full', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'seated', 'leg', 'stretch', 'reverse', 'plank', 'forward', 'bend', 'butterfly', 'crab', 'table', 'Finishing', 'postures', 'include', 'lying', 'stomach', 'twist', 'approximately', '2', 'minutes', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'concluding', 'seated', 'position.YOGA', 'FOR', 'RELAXATION', '40', 'minutes', 'routine', 'Dodge', 'seated', 'practice', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'Next', 'series', 'stretches', 'including', 'shoulder/elbow', 'rolls', 'side', 'neck', 'stretch', 'back', 'neck', 'stretch', 'head', 'shakes/rolls', 'finish', 'Dodge', 'then', 'fours', 'cat/cow', 'modified', 'child', 'pose', 'Sitting', 'back', 'child', 'pose', 'rabbit', 'thread-the-needle', 'bind', 'Dodge', 'up', 'down', 'dog', 'calf', 'stretch', 'then', 'lowers', 'down', 'belly', 'sphinx', 'crocodile', 'poses', 'next', 'series', 'stretches', 'moves', 'down', 'dog', 'half', 'kneeling', 'pyramid', 'pigeon', 'pose', 'then', 'down', 'dog', 'breath', 'retention', 'seated', 'Dodge', 'head-to-knee', 'forward', 'bend', 'butterfly', 'modified', 'eagle', 'wrists', 'ankles', 'crossed', 'fire', 'log', 'pose', 'conclude', 'practice', 'Dodge', 'down', 'back', 'half', 'happy', 'babies', 'pose', 'revolved', 'stomach', 'twist', '3.5', 'minutes', 'yoga', 'nidra', 'relaxation', 'again', 'seated', 'position.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'practices', 'consider', 'be', 'intermediate', 'level', 'yoga', 'found', 'Energy', 'practice', 'be', 'challenging', 'not', 'postures', 'were', 'difficult', 'Dodge', 'poses', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'longer', 'Relaxation', 'practice', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'someone', 'who', 'experienced', 'enough', 'yoga', 'be', 'familiar', 'postures', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'flexibility', 'limitations', 'Dodge', 'not', 'show', 'modifications', 'very', 'encouraging', 'only', 'do', 'what', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'very', 'nice', 'DVD', 'would', 'rate', '4', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A
1550934,A1CCW4DLR2BPWA,B008DL4HWU,Happy Hiker,"[2, 2]","I've done the Relaxation practice, which is 40 minutes long, and I'm really impressed with it.Tamal Dodge, the instructor, has a soothing voice, and his cuing is great.  His sequencing is different than what I've done in yoga studio classes, and I was pleasantly surprised at how relaxing the practice was.  One of the unusual asanas was a variation of eagle pose while seated.  His comments on what certain poses do was really interesting.  One thing I really liked is that the practice isn't rushed, and he gives you a lot of quiet breathing time, which really helps to release tension while in asanas.  Also, the yoga nidra as the end is very soothing and well done - it's not all talk.  I'm definitely a fan of his style of teaching as a result of this practice.The music is relaxed, a little bit new age jazz. A horn is a little loud at minute 33, but overall, the music is very nice.The setting, like all Element DVDs, is outdoors in a garden that seems to be on the Pacific Ocean. It's very beautiful and pleasant, and one of the reasons why I like the Element DVDs.No props are needed, which surprised me.  I did use a blanket during Sukhasana, easy pose, because it makes sitting for a while more comfortable for me.  However, no need for blocks or straps.Although I haven't tried the Energy practice yet, I have to rave about the relaxation practice. The feeling I had at the end of the practice is the closest thing I've found in a DVD that compares to a yoga studio class.",5,Lovely and wonderful,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,1484,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'Relaxation', 'practice', '40', 'minutes', 'long', ""'m"", 'really', 'impressed', 'it.Tamal', 'Dodge', 'instructor', 'soothing', 'voice', 'cuing', 'great', 'sequencing', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'yoga', 'studio', 'classes', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'relaxing', 'practice', 'was', 'One', 'unusual', 'asanas', 'was', 'variation', 'eagle', 'pose', 'seated', 'comments', 'what', 'certain', 'poses', 'do', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'practice', ""n't"", 'rushed', 'lot', 'quiet', 'breathing', 'time', 'really', 'release', 'tension', 'asanas', 'Also', 'yoga', 'nidra', 'end', 'very', 'soothing', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'talk', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'fan', 'style', 'teaching', 'result', 'practice.The', 'music', 'relaxed', 'little', 'bit', 'new', 'age', 'jazz', 'horn', 'little', 'loud', 'minute', '33', 'overall', 'music', 'very', 'nice.The', 'setting', 'Element', 'DVDs', 'outdoors', 'garden', 'be', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'very', 'beautiful', 'pleasant', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'like', 'Element', 'DVDs.No', 'props', 'are', 'needed', 'surprised', 'did', 'use', 'blanket', 'Sukhasana', 'easy', 'pose', 'sitting', 'while', 'more', 'comfortable', 'However', 'need', 'blocks', 'straps.Although', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'Energy', 'practice', 'yet', 'have', 'rave', 'relaxation', 'practice', 'feeling', 'had', 'end', 'practice', 'closest', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'found', 'DVD', 'yoga', 'studio', 'class']",N/A
