It surpassed them with a flood of 40 nostalgia hits performed from 1994 to Jan. 16, 2000. Count 'em. That's 2,036 performances with the last one captured on film with professional values both visually and acoustically. This music was pretty much the sountrack of the '50s with hits from the days of Elvis, the Olympics and countless do wop groups that anyone who was alive during that era will be sure to recall and cherish.

The dancing and singing were highly energetic, reminding me of how good live theater can leave you high, refreshed, and joyous. The show moves along at a quick pace. No dialogue, just songs and dances, and before you know it the show is over. Nostalgia carries the show and gives you a sense of the roots of pop music.

However, this DVD is of the last performance in which they brought back the original cast!The singing talent in this show is excellent, particularly in the males.  Each song is sung flawlessly with harmonies and orchestrations that, in my opinion, are improvements on the original songs and translate effectively to the stage.Although most of the dancing is done in the first act, it is very fun to watch, hard to emulate and successfully executed.The show was filmed in front of a live audience and filmed well, there is never any problem with not being able to see an actor on stage, nor is there a problem with people being upstaged.  (Unless you want to include one person in the audience who couldn't help but standing up and applauding with their arms above their head).The only problem I was able to notice was that the cast did seem slightly out of practice.  To be more specific: In the song &quot;On Broadway&quot; there were problems establishing a beat as the five males in the song were trying to slow down the song in order to perform the dance steps.  Also, &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; was, in a word, rushed.But, overall, it is undeniable that this is probably the best recorded Broadway musical and it is a rarity to catch a show in its original cast.  Also, this is rarely, if ever, on television, I would definately recommend buying it.",5,Bravo!
