1104114,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000VT6ZWM,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is an hour-long stand-up routine done in Boston in 2007. As a bonus, his encore on the show is included, where he reads from ""The Purpose Driven Life"" which was written by Rick Warren, conservative preacher. Of course Maher manages to make what is an incredibly insipid book into a hilarious experience.The main part, the part named ""The Decider,"" is not only about George Bush, of course. He also talks about the Abstinence Only campaign and its ""success."" He serves up some delicious irony concerning the war on drugs and wars in the middle east. But his best jokes are definitely about politicians. One thing only seems funny in hindsight that is quite different from the way it way funny at the time. He mentions why it would be impossible for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to run on the same ticket. He was right, of course, but not for the reasons he seemed to think.One problem with topical humor is that it gets dated so quickly, but this one stands up well. OK, it's only been two years, but that's a long time for someone who takes his topics right from the headlines. Of his three DVDs I've recently reviewed, I have to say this is the best. Religulous is even better, but that's not the same sort of show at all. This and ""Be More Cynical"" were both stand-up monologues before a large live audience. ""New Rules"" was cut from his HBO show's regular segment by the same name. Of these three, this one is the best, although frankly, I loved them all.",5,You Gotta Love Bill Maher,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1467,"['hour-long', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'done', 'Boston', '2007', 'bonus', 'encore', 'show', 'included', 'where', 'Purpose', 'Driven', 'Life', 'was', 'written', 'Rick', 'Warren', 'conservative', 'preacher', 'course', 'Maher', 'make', 'what', 'incredibly', 'insipid', 'book', 'hilarious', 'experience.The', 'main', 'part', 'part', 'named', 'Decider', 'not', 'only', 'George', 'Bush', 'course', 'also', 'Abstinence', 'Only', 'campaign', 'success', 'up', 'delicious', 'irony', 'concerning', 'war', 'drugs', 'wars', 'middle', 'east', 'best', 'jokes', 'are', 'definitely', 'politicians', 'One', 'thing', 'only', 'funny', 'hindsight', 'quite', 'different', 'way', 'way', 'time', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'run', 'same', 'ticket', 'was', 'right', 'course', 'not', 'reasons', 'seemed', 'think.One', 'problem', 'topical', 'humor', 'dated', 'so', 'quickly', 'one', 'up', 'well', 'OK', 'only', 'been', 'two', 'years', 'long', 'time', 'someone', 'who', 'topics', 'right', 'headlines', 'three', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'reviewed', 'have', 'say', 'best', 'Religulous', 'even', 'better', 'not', 'same', 'sort', 'show', 'Be', 'More', 'Cynical', 'were', 'stand-up', 'monologues', 'large', 'live', 'audience', 'New', 'Rules', 'was', 'cut', 'HBO', 'show', 'regular', 'segment', 'same', 'name', 'three', 'one', 'best', 'frankly', 'loved']",N/A

After stumbling across this one on TV and spending 60 minutes laughing and wondering how I can translate all of his right on observations to my friends. I came on line to purchase it. I've never seen Bill do true stand up and this was highly entertaining. After just enough conservative observations (and when I say observations I mean side splitting humor) he moves on to general life observations that let you know how ""In touch with the american people"" he really is.Enjoy",5,"Side splitting humor if watched alone, if watched with other Maher fans watch out!",1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,542,"['like', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'never', 'take', 'time', 'search', 'shows', 'out', 'stumbling', 'one', 'TV', 'spending', '60', 'minutes', 'laughing', 'wondering', 'how', 'can', 'translate', 'right', 'observations', 'friends', 'came', 'line', 'purchase', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Bill', 'do', 'true', 'stand', 'up', 'was', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'just', 'enough', 'conservative', 'observations', 'when', 'say', 'observations', 'mean', 'side', 'splitting', 'humor', 'general', 'life', 'observations', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'touch', 'american', 'people', 'really', 'is.Enjoy']",N/A
1104116,A9TG2NFA614S9,B000VT6ZWM,John F. Rooney,"[11, 11]","In ""The Decider"" Bill Maher is very funny and biting in this stand-up assault and skewering of then-President Bush. He knows his facts and marshals them against Republicans, organized religions, drug companies, and Bush 43. (It anticipates his recent movie release ""Religulous."") It's a series of hard-hitting, obscene, and rapid fire jokes.President Clinton comes off fairly well, although I've always thought he would make a perfect target for an all-out assault. If you're a right wing zealot, you'd better avoid this full frontal attack. Maher extols the virtues of condoms. If you're going to attack the right wingers, you might as well hit all the bases.Surprisingly there is not too much about Vice-president Cheney except his poor aim when hunting. If you're a Bush-basher, a true Democrat, a libertarian, or an agnostic, you'll probably love this. I found it profanely and profoundly hilarious. Political satire has been a rare breed in recent years, and we need more of it to keep us honest and alert.",5,Get Ready for  Maher Mayhem,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,1011,"['Decider', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'very', 'funny', 'biting', 'stand-up', 'assault', 'skewering', 'then-President', 'Bush', 'facts', 'marshals', 'Republicans', 'organized', 'religions', 'drug', 'companies', 'Bush', '43', 'recent', 'movie', 'release', 'Religulous', 'series', 'hard-hitting', 'obscene', 'rapid', 'fire', 'jokes.President', 'Clinton', 'off', 'fairly', 'well', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'target', 'all-out', 'assault', ""'re"", 'right', 'wing', 'zealot', ""'d"", 'better', 'avoid', 'full', 'frontal', 'attack', 'Maher', 'virtues', 'condoms', ""'re"", 'going', 'attack', 'right', 'wingers', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'hit', 'bases.Surprisingly', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'Vice-president', 'Cheney', 'poor', 'aim', 'when', 'hunting', ""'re"", 'Bush-basher', 'true', 'Democrat', 'libertarian', 'agnostic', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'found', 'profanely', 'profoundly', 'hilarious', 'Political', 'satire', 'been', 'rare', 'breed', 'recent', 'years', 'need', 'more', 'keep', 'honest', 'alert']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","I have a small plaque on my dining room table that says ""Laugh often,"" and if there's ever a day that goes by that I can't find anything amusing, I'm quick to watch an old ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" episode or one of his comedy specials. Bill Maher is my stress reliever. Sometimes he says something stupid like Haiti was getting too much news coverage or his views on the name Mohammed in the U.K. Then there are times he gets it right, and this entire comedy special was full of get-it-right moments. He hit the nail on the head with comments about Clarence Thomas, every single thing he said about Bush, Brownie, religion and I was disturbed about the gynecologist anal raping his wife. That last part I missed entirely, which is yet another reason I appreciate Maher. If I missed it, I can guarantee I'll find the news topics that may slip under my radar on his show or these specials. The only downside was the bonus feature with him reading from that book was boring. He made fun of the book, but I still could've done without seeing that. The rest though was an easy five out of five.Side note: I love the outfit he was wearing. It looked a little younger than his usual style, but he looked relaxed and he kinda had the Michelle Obama arms going.",5,My stress reliever,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,1255,"['have', 'small', 'plaque', 'dining', 'room', 'table', 'Laugh', 'often', 'ever', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'amusing', ""'m"", 'quick', 'watch', 'old', 'Real', 'Time', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'episode', 'one', 'comedy', 'specials', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'stress', 'reliever', 'Sometimes', 'something', 'stupid', 'Haiti', 'was', 'getting', 'too', 'much', 'news', 'coverage', 'views', 'name', 'Mohammed', 'U.K.', 'Then', 'are', 'times', 'right', 'entire', 'comedy', 'special', 'was', 'full', 'get-it-right', 'moments', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'comments', 'Clarence', 'Thomas', 'single', 'thing', 'said', 'Bush', 'Brownie', 'religion', 'was', 'disturbed', 'gynecologist', 'anal', 'raping', 'wife', 'last', 'part', 'missed', 'entirely', 'yet', 'reason', 'appreciate', 'Maher', 'missed', 'can', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'find', 'news', 'topics', 'may', 'slip', 'radar', 'show', 'specials', 'only', 'downside', 'was', 'bonus', 'feature', 'reading', 'book', 'was', 'boring', 'made', 'fun', 'book', 'still', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'seeing', 'rest', 'though', 'was', 'easy', 'five', 'five.Side', 'note', 'love', 'outfit', 'was', 'wearing', 'looked', 'little', 'younger', 'usual', 'style', 'looked', 'relaxed', 'kinda', 'had', 'Michelle', 'Obama', 'arms', 'going']",N/A
