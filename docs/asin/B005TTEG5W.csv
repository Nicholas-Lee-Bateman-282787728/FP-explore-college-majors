1503836,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B005TTEG5W,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","The eleven television movies which make up the complete Hallmark Mystery Woman series is almost always entertaining but never up to the standard of the best British and American products of similar genre. One factor working against them is that the choice of stories and the presentation of them militates against sharply etched conflicts, bitter emotional conflict, and other disturbing elements which mark superior works. Another is the absence of a strong central character to carry the show. The lead is acceptable, but lacks  the strength and presence of A Star, someone who can do the heavy lifting. She is good enough to keep it watchable but not to bear the weight of invigorating all her scenes...which are the heart of the movies. Clarence Williams III does perform admirably in the limited role of sidekick but again is allowed limited range of emotion and limited time. Both these actors may simply be cut down to fit the concept of how the shows should be presented. Stories are interesting and supporting players capable. Overall, they  (and these three, of course) are Hallmark productions, that is, they do seek to provide the quality that Hallmark wants to be associated with its name, but that prevents a degree of innovativeness and daring  which would make them memorable.I can commend these three films as worthy of being the centerpiece of an evening of television.

The quality of the video and sound is excellent.The Mystery Woman series was originally produced by the Hallmark Chanel.  The series consists of a pilot and 10 movies.  The pilot aired in 2003 with the 10 movies following in the 2005 - 2007 time frame.The series stars Kellie Martin of ER fame as Samantha Kinsey.  She inherited a mystery bookstore from her uncle and now runs it.There are three additional main characters in addition to Samantha:Philby - He is the store caretaker.  He is played by Clarence Williams III of 1970's Mod Squad fame.Cassie Hillman - She is Samatha's best friend and the Assistant D.A.Chief Connors - He is the Police Chie whome Samantha proves wrong more often than not.Philby and Cassie were played by different actors in the pilot as compared to the 10 follow-up movies.The 11 titles are:Mystery Woman - PilotMystery WeekendSnapshotSing Me a MurderVision of a MurderGame TimeAt First SightWild West MysteryOh BabyRedemptionIn the ShadowsAll mysteries are complex, well thought out and well acted.

I don't know how they do it.  It is heart wrenching to fans like myself, however, not to be able to purchase every single thing they've ever made (there are millions of us who bemoan this fact all the time as we stand in bookstores complaining about it)--which made the purchase of this trilogy the best thing that's happened to me in a while.  I like this series.  Kelly Martin has always been intriguing in her roles.  She's not the traditional female by any stretch of the imagination, not cruel, bitter, or always willing to pick a fight.  She's a hardliner, though (nice touch), in a cute package.  There's no sweetsie crap going on with this mystery woman--but she's not heartless.  She is obsessed, which only adds to her charm, even though you do want to smack her every once in a while.  She's dedicated, what can I say?  If you want some good mystery without all the angst and non-essential life-affirming dialogue--this is your ticket.

Martin first assumed the role in ""Mystery Woman"" (2003) a production for the Hallmark Channel, and has so far appeared in ten successive Mystery Woman movies.  This DVD collection containsMystery Woman: Mystery Weekend(2005),Mystery Woman: Snapshot(2005), andMystery Woman - Sing Me a Murder(2005), which are the second, third, and fourth entries in the series.Samantha Kinsey follows in the tradition of many other amateur sleuths, such as Jessica Fletcher from Murder She Wrote, who in the course of her normal life, gets entangled in various crimes and mysteries.  Samantha gets support and valuable advice from Philby, who manages the bookstore, and is played by Clarence Williams III (Mod Squad).  Every detective needs connections with the law.  Sam's close friend Cassie Hillman (Nina Siemaszko) is an assistant to the local DA, and she also has a lively relationship with Police Chief Connors (Casey Sander).The Mystery Woman movies seem to be influenced by the success of Murder She Wrote, although featuring a younger heroine.  Mystery Woman has a gentle folksy feel similar to Cabot Cove, where the intrusion of violence, usually causes a major disturbance.  The movies have that made for cable TV vibe, where something exciting usually happens just before the commercial break, which means that things are typically quite lively.  The stories are generally well written and acted, and feature some familiar names like Kari Wuhrer, David Naughton, Deborah Van Valkenburg, John Getz, and Patty McCormack.Kellie Martin is a likeable and very talented actress, and even directs some of the succeeding ""Mystery Woman"" movies.  She already had tons of TV credits, but many became familiar with Martin when she appeared on ER for two seasons (1998-2000), playing Lucy Knight, a medical student who was tragically murdered.  Clarence Williams III, who played Lincoln Hayes on The Mod Squad (1968-1973), is a unique talent, and he and Martin seem to have excellent rapport, as a very offbeat crime solving team.If you enjoy Miss Marple, or detective programs like Murder She Wrote, The Father Dowling Mysteries, or Diagnosis Murder, you might enjoy Mystery Woman.  The two disc Mystery Woman Triple Feature, is a pretty economical way to get these three movies, which have been available for several years.

Since the show ended, I've been watching reruns and also checking out the DVDs from my local public library. I stumbled across the Mystery Woman series one day on the Hallmark Channel and promptly tivo-ed them all, a good thing since not all of the episodes are available on DVD.The Mystery Woman investigative drama is kind of like a grown-up version of Nancy Drew. It stars Kellie Martin (who first impressed me in her portrayal of devoted schoolteacher Christy in the TV series,Christy - The Complete Series). Here she plays photographer Samantha Kinsey who inherits an old mystery bookstore from her deceased uncle. She renames it Mystery Woman Bookstore, and runs it with the help of an enigmatic assistant, Philby (Clarence Williams III) who is sort of a father figure to her. Just like the indomitable Ms. Fletcher, Samantha Kinsey finds herself being 'courted' by mysteries and uses her natural intuition and other sleuthing skills to solve baffling cases. She is assisted by her BFF and assistant to the DA, Cassie Hillman (Nina Siemaszko) who uses her position to help Samantha whenever she can.This value set consists of three episodes:Mystery WeekendSnapshotSing Me a MurderThe following are the episodes as they were screened:Mystery Woman (2003 - had different actors playing Philby and Cassie)Mystery Woman: Mystery Weekend (2005)Mystery Woman: Snapshot (2005)Mystery Woman: Sing Me a Murder (2005)Mystery Woman: Vision of a Murder (2005)Mystery Woman: Game Time (2005)Mystery Woman: At First Sight (2006)Mystery Woman: Wild West Mystery (2006)Mystery Woman: Oh Baby (2006)Mystery Woman: Redemption (2006)Mystery Woman: In the Shadows (2007)Hallmark Channel shows the episodes every once in a while and I've been recording them off-air. Though not quite as engaging as Murder, She Wrote (I don't feel there ever will be a series quite like that again, and I so miss Cabot Cove!), Mystery Woman has a strong lead in Kellie Martin and a good supporting cast in the actors who play Philby and Cassie. Unlike Murder, She Wrote there is no real development of other characters that live in the town where Samantha lives. Each movie is stand-alone and one doesn't really need to watch the shows in order, though the first episode does provide some background info on Samantha.I'd recommend this series of movies for those who love cozy mysteries.",5,"Not quite Murder, She Wrote but charming nevertheless",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2546,"['am', 'great', 'fan', 'amazing', 'sleuth', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'iconic', 'TV', 'seriesMurder', 'Wrote', 'Complete', 'First', 'Seasonwhich', 'ran', 'twelve', 'seasons', 'was', 'followed', 'four', 'TV', 'movies', 'show', 'ended', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'reruns', 'also', 'checking', 'out', 'DVDs', 'local', 'public', 'library', 'stumbled', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'series', 'one', 'day', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'promptly', 'tivo-ed', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'DVD.The', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'investigative', 'drama', 'kind', 'grown-up', 'version', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'who', 'first', 'impressed', 'portrayal', 'devoted', 'schoolteacher', 'Christy', 'TV', 'series', 'Christy', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Here', 'photographer', 'Samantha', 'Kinsey', 'who', 'old', 'mystery', 'bookstore', 'deceased', 'uncle', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Bookstore', 'help', 'enigmatic', 'assistant', 'Philby', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'who', 'sort', 'father', 'figure', 'Just', 'indomitable', 'Ms.', 'Fletcher', 'Samantha', 'Kinsey', 'being', ""'courted"", 'mysteries', 'natural', 'intuition', 'other', 'sleuthing', 'skills', 'solve', 'baffling', 'cases', 'assisted', 'BFF', 'assistant', 'DA', 'Cassie', 'Hillman', 'Nina', 'Siemaszko', 'who', 'position', 'help', 'Samantha', 'whenever', 'can.This', 'value', 'set', 'consists', 'three', 'episodes', 'Mystery', 'WeekendSnapshotSing', 'Me', 'MurderThe', 'following', 'are', 'episodes', 'were', 'screened', 'Mystery', 'Woman', '2003', 'had', 'different', 'actors', 'playing', 'Philby', 'Cassie', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Mystery', 'Weekend', '2005', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Snapshot', '2005', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Sing', 'Me', 'Murder', '2005', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Vision', 'Murder', '2005', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Game', 'Time', '2005', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'First', 'Sight', '2006', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Wild', 'West', 'Mystery', '2006', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Oh', 'Baby', '2006', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Redemption', '2006', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'Shadows', '2007', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'episodes', 'once', 'while', ""'ve"", 'been', 'recording', 'off-air', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'engaging', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'there', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'quite', 'again', 'so', 'miss', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Mystery', 'Woman', 'strong', 'lead', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Philby', 'Cassie', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'real', 'development', 'other', 'characters', 'live', 'town', 'where', 'Samantha', 'movie', 'stand-alone', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'shows', 'order', 'first', 'episode', 'provide', 'background', 'info', 'Samantha.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'series', 'movies', 'who', 'love', 'cozy', 'mysteries']",Mystery Woman Triple Feature
