The scene opens with one tenacious, die hard detective from the Serious Crimes Division leading his men to a group of mainland robbers ready to leave the territory with their loot. In the ensuing shootout, the TV crew filmed a police officer, getting on his knees and begging one of the robbers not to shoot.This embarrassing scene brought shame and disgrace to the police force as the online community in Hongkong made their sentiments know. A female police officer (played by Taiwanese singer Kelly Chen) suggested to the chief that they ought to win back some public confidence and respect by making an impressive show out of the robbers' recapture.Police intelligence revealed that the robbers were holed up at an apartment with a labyrinth of corridors. A thousand police officers descended on the building. The female officer played by Kelly Chen took command of the whole operation. The real life difficulties of evacuating the building, tracking down the robbers, disobedient colleagues from another department, entertaining the media and ensuing the safety of hostages are handled skillfully by the director.As the robbers from the mainland were true professionals, they managed to make things extremely difficult for Kelly and her team. Not only did the bad guys have automatic weapons and an endless supply of ammo and grenades, they could also use gas tanks as bombs, took their own amateur footage of how the cop bungled and uploaded them to the internet.Luckily for the cops, the renegade detective from the Serious Crime Division defied orders and stayed in the building with his team. When the special forces moved in and got duped by the gangsters, the team moved in on the gang. All but 2 of the robbers/killers were killed. The 2 surviving gangsters somehow managed to escape from the building. The die hard detective went after them, got knocked down by a car, got up, continued chasing ...Even less believable was what led to the beautiful, intelligent female commanding officer going after the escaped robber alone, only to be taken hostage! The disobedient, die hard detective came to her rescue and it was a happy ending.",4,Cops & Robbers Reality,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,2359,"['cast', ""n't"", 'great', 'plot', 'not', 'always', 'believable', 'one', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'watched', 'start', 'end.Brilliant', 'camerawork', 'explosive', 'sequences', 'are', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'work', 'scene', 'one', 'tenacious', 'die', 'hard', 'detective', 'Serious', 'Crimes', 'Division', 'leading', 'men', 'group', 'mainland', 'robbers', 'ready', 'leave', 'territory', 'loot', 'ensuing', 'shootout', 'TV', 'crew', 'filmed', 'police', 'officer', 'getting', 'knees', 'begging', 'one', 'robbers', 'not', 'shoot.This', 'embarrassing', 'scene', 'brought', 'shame', 'disgrace', 'police', 'force', 'online', 'community', 'Hongkong', 'made', 'sentiments', 'know', 'female', 'police', 'officer', 'played', 'Taiwanese', 'singer', 'Kelly', 'Chen', 'suggested', 'chief', 'ought', 'win', 'back', 'public', 'confidence', 'respect', 'making', 'impressive', 'show', 'robbers', 'recapture.Police', 'intelligence', 'revealed', 'robbers', 'were', 'holed', 'up', 'apartment', 'labyrinth', 'corridors', 'thousand', 'police', 'officers', 'descended', 'building', 'female', 'officer', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Chen', 'took', 'command', 'whole', 'operation', 'real', 'life', 'difficulties', 'evacuating', 'building', 'tracking', 'down', 'robbers', 'disobedient', 'colleagues', 'department', 'entertaining', 'media', 'ensuing', 'safety', 'hostages', 'are', 'handled', 'skillfully', 'director.As', 'robbers', 'mainland', 'were', 'true', 'professionals', 'managed', 'make', 'things', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'Kelly', 'team', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'endless', 'supply', 'ammo', 'grenades', 'could', 'also', 'use', 'gas', 'tanks', 'bombs', 'took', 'own', 'amateur', 'footage', 'how', 'cop', 'bungled', 'uploaded', 'internet.Luckily', 'cops', 'renegade', 'detective', 'Serious', 'Crime', 'Division', 'defied', 'orders', 'stayed', 'building', 'team', 'When', 'special', 'forces', 'moved', 'got', 'duped', 'gangsters', 'team', 'moved', 'gang', '2', 'robbers/killers', 'were', 'killed', '2', 'surviving', 'gangsters', 'somehow', 'managed', 'escape', 'building', 'die', 'hard', 'detective', 'went', 'got', 'knocked', 'down', 'car', 'got', 'up', 'continued', 'chasing', 'Even', 'less', 'believable', 'was', 'what', 'led', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'female', 'commanding', 'officer', 'going', 'escaped', 'robber', 'alone', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'hostage', 'disobedient', 'die', 'hard', 'detective', 'came', 'rescue', 'was', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

I'm Kind Of A ...","[2, 2]","What's most interesting about ""Breaking News"" is that it starts out with a cool shootout between the cops and robbers. A group of robbers catch the police on the wrong day as they get tied up in a web of media scandal. The Hong Kong police want to use this group of robbers as an example and gain a reputation. The police are using the media to broadcast every moment of their attempts to capture the robbers. The thing the cops don't know is that these robbers are pretty darn smart and constantly trying to outsmart them. When the police finally get the five robbers cornered in an apartment building it becomes a showdown between the two to see who can use the media best but only one side will come out alive.I actually rented this movie because the cover looked interesting but I wasn't really expecting much from it. This is a hard one to review, just when you think the film has shown you all it's got it gives you some more. I like the whole feeling of it, the pacing and especially the camera work. This had great camera work, the director shows scenes that you may see in any other action film but shows it from such good angles that it exceeds the regular action film and looks better. You're given plenty of room to see everything so you won't miss a thing. For a actor to truly work well their character has to be written well and every character is written well in this movie.When the well-written characters were put with this talented cast the acting turned out pretty good. The story is very cool and it developed wonderfully. There is a great hero villain duo in Nick Cheung and Richie Jen and they truly keep the movie going. Nick plays a great tough nosed cop that just won't stop until he gets the bad guys and his performance was great. From beginning to end this is one movie that will definitely hold your attention. I really love that the bad guys had great plans and were not stupid. Plus Richie Jen was playing his character so well I started rooting for him to win.For me the only problem with ""Breaking News"" is that the action and gunplay could of been a bit better. The explosions could've been a little more realistic and bigger. Even the beginning shootout could have had a bit more oomph I think but again the camera work helped it look good. Over all this is definitely a film that is worth watching, it has few flaws but will exceed your expectations.

I haven't managed to see another of his movies until now. I didn't like this one nearly as much, but it's not all that bad, either.The film starts with a news crew stumbling upon, and broadcasting, a shootout between two gangs in which the late-arriving police look like bumbling idiots. Now, the Hong Kong media and the Hong Kong police don't have a history of working together, but as a public relations move, the cops allow the media access while they hunt down one of the gangs. Needless to say, this turns into a case of Murphy's Law gone insane, as the gang holes up in an apartment building with hostages. The cops, the media, the gang members, and the hostages are all looking at the situation through different eyes, and we get to see it all.Did you ever see a really, really awful 2001 movie called 15 Minutes, with Edward Burns? Nah, neither did anyone else. And now you don't have to! Breaking News is in many ways an Asian take on the same material (which was itself a loose, loose adaptation of the French flick Man Bites Dog). ""An Asian take"" usually means better character development, and that's the case here, but the plot loses its way a number of times, and some of those it never truly recovers from.

The police respond to the bad publicity from a failed stakeout that turns into a running battle by televising their investigation and resulting siege. They even hire a film director to re-edit their footage only for the media savvy crooks to put the footage they shot on their mobile phones on the internet, leading to a game of psychological one-upmanship - the crooks cook a meal for their hostages and show footage of them enjoying it, so the police buy meals for all the reporters; the crooks manage to bluff their way out of heir hideout being stormed, so the police wheel out Jackie Chan (well, an unconvincing lookalike) to show his support for the force.Lots of neat touches (such as the bad guys accidentally rescuing a pair of killers who are hiding out in the same building), a neat use of occasional split screens and an incredibly impressive opening sequence shot in one technically astonishingly difficult but remarkably fluid uninterrupted take add to the show.

964313,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000E0ODEK,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 10]","After very humiliating defeat of Hong Kong police, young and ambitious Inspector Rebecca Fong (Kelly Chen seen in `Infernal Affair') proposes one daring plan - that is, to bring the TV crew to the crime scenes, and let them broadcast how the `real' police are doing their jobs, risking their lives to protect the people from criminals. When another inspector hot-tempered Cheung (Nick Cheung) finds out the hideout of the criminals (and the very criminals that undermined the dignities of the police), Inspector Fong is assigned a job to show the police work on the air. What Fong didn't know is that the criminals are much more resourceful and cleverer than she thought.Johnny To takes up the idea of reality TV shows, and uses it in the unique way. Not that the idea itself is original - you know so many TV shows following the real-life police officers, or Robert DeNiro film '15 Minutes.' It is the way how the criminals led by the leader Yuan (Ritchie Ren) fight back and tries to escape that is really intriguing.(ULTRA-STYLISH, GREAT OPENING) Johnny To is known for his prolific career and stylish camerawork, and in `Breaking News' he again shows his great skills in creating the tension and beauty while shooting the action scenes. The opening seven minute sequence is just brilliant. It is shot in one take, and shows us that shoot-out scenes can be so intense without using many fast cuts.Some may find the film slightly confusing because of the police organization in Hong Kong. Fong belongs to OCTB (Organized Crime and Triad Bureau, and Cheung is a cop from CID (Criminal Investigation Department). Another unit PTU is also mentioned (and PTU played a central role in To's previous film `PTU' starring Simon Yam and Suet Lam, both also seen in `Breaking News), but all you have to do is to keep in mind that Fong and Cheung are from different sections of the police.I think the ending is a little weak, and cast-against-type Kelly Chen is not convincing. And probably the idea of reality TV could have been more explored.
