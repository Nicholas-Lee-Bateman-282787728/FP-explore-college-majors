Patlabor 2 is everyting the fisrt film was and more. Never befor have I seen such an elaborate story of lies, revenge  and politcal espianoge pulled of so well. Directed by the same director of  the first Patlabor film and the classic Ghost in the Shell. The animation  is outstanding! The voice cast is excellent at making there characters come  alive. The musical score is soothing yet haunting at the same time. The  story occures three years after the events in Patlabor. A string a  terrorist like events are occuring around Tokyo. Yet with each incident no  causualties only fear and a growing conflict between the government and the  military, with the Mobile police force caught in the middle. The only way  to stop a civil war is for the Mobile Police Force to find the man  responsible for these acts, ye the perpitrator is revield to be a former  teacher and lover of the second in command of the Mobile Police Force. The  best way to descibe this film would to combine the talents of Tom Clancy  and Masamune Shirow into one film.",5,A Political Thriller equal to anything from Tom Clancy!,960940800,"06 14, 2000",2000,1142,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'Patlabor', 'film', 'was', 'captivated', 'story', 'loved', 'comical', 'characters', 'Patlabor', '2', 'everyting', 'fisrt', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'Never', 'befor', 'have', 'seen', 'elaborate', 'story', 'lies', 'revenge', 'politcal', 'espianoge', 'pulled', 'so', 'well', 'Directed', 'same', 'director', 'first', 'Patlabor', 'film', 'classic', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'animation', 'outstanding', 'voice', 'cast', 'excellent', 'making', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'musical', 'score', 'soothing', 'yet', 'haunting', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'three', 'years', 'events', 'Patlabor', 'A', 'string', 'terrorist', 'events', 'are', 'occuring', 'Tokyo', 'incident', 'causualties', 'only', 'fear', 'growing', 'conflict', 'government', 'military', 'Mobile', 'police', 'force', 'caught', 'middle', 'only', 'way', 'stop', 'civil', 'war', 'Mobile', 'Police', 'Force', 'find', 'man', 'responsible', 'acts', 'ye', 'perpitrator', 'revield', 'be', 'former', 'teacher', 'lover', 'second', 'command', 'Mobile', 'Police', 'Force', 'best', 'way', 'descibe', 'film', 'would', 'combine', 'talents', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'Masamune', 'Shirow', 'one', 'film']",Patlabor 2 VHS

I agree that pointless violence is not a good thing in a movie, but this movie doesn't even move.  It might as well be a series of still frames with talking  dubbed over it.  There's a scene near the end where the captain is talking  with an ex-terrorist, and he has his back to the camera the whole time so  they didn't even have to animate that.  I'm not saying that I expect  destruction and gore, but they could at least move around a little.  They  could at least go for a walk or something while they talk, instead of just  showing one frame of animation for ten minutes while two people talk about  war.  This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  I must admit  that it had more of a point than the first one though.",1,Patlabor 2 is TERRIBLE,961200000,"06 17, 2000",2000,790,"['have', 'seen', 'good', 'anime', 'not', 'one', 'agree', 'pointless', 'violence', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'move', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'series', 'still', 'talking', 'dubbed', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'captain', 'talking', 'ex-terrorist', 'back', 'camera', 'whole', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'animate', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'expect', 'destruction', 'gore', 'could', 'least', 'move', 'little', 'could', 'least', 'go', 'walk', 'something', 'talk', 'instead', 'just', 'showing', 'one', 'frame', 'animation', 'ten', 'minutes', 'two', 'people', 'talk', 'war', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'must', 'admit', 'had', 'more', 'point', 'first', 'one', 'though']",Patlabor 2 VHS
386944,A2LXZRXUZXV51P,6303854540,Jim Beam,"[5, 6]","I rented Patlabor 2 at first because I was looking for Japanese anime with cool looking robots and lots of action. But this was not a typical robot flick. Something totally different. To put it simply, it's more of a Drama with Robots than anything else.In the story, which is set couple of years from now, the robots, or ""labors"", are very much everyday tools. They are just like cars or helicopters that we see everyday. And the way people casually treat these labors in the film, further stresses the idea that they are just everyday tools, not super robots that transform and shoot laser beams. Because of such setting, I found myself following the storyline, as oppose to waiting for robot fight sequences.And as the film went on, I was so memerized with the storyline that I wasn't even thinking about robots. The story felt like classic detective thriller in many ways. It even felt somewhat philosophical at times. What also helps this film create such experience is the music and cinematography.The original score is very subtle yet quite hypnotic. I thought its melodramatic feeling goes well together with such intelligent story.The cinematography (the way film was shot, or drawn in this case) is so much like a real film that it is amazing. There are few-minute sequences where they just show the scenery of streets of Japan with subtle music playing in the background, those are just breathtaking.Because of these qualities, I think this is a movie that a more mature audience can appreciate, rather than younger kids. But if anyone wants to experience totally different film, especially an anime, this is it. I've constantly refered to this movie as ""film"" rather than cartoon or anime because that's what it felt like to me. A very intelligent film.One more thing, Patlabor2 is directed by Mamoru Oshii and music by Kenji Kawai, who contributed same efforts on the film ""Ghost in the Shell"", another great Japanese anime known to many people.",5,"One of the most intelligent films, or anime, I've ever seen.",928281600,"06 2, 1999",1999,1958,"['rented', 'Patlabor', '2', 'first', 'was', 'looking', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'cool', 'looking', 'robots', 'lots', 'action', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'robot', 'flick', 'Something', 'totally', 'different', 'put', 'simply', 'more', 'Drama', 'Robots', 'anything', 'else.In', 'story', 'set', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'robots', 'labors', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'everyday', 'tools', 'are', 'just', 'cars', 'helicopters', 'see', 'everyday', 'way', 'people', 'casually', 'treat', 'labors', 'film', 'further', 'idea', 'are', 'just', 'everyday', 'tools', 'not', 'super', 'robots', 'transform', 'shoot', 'laser', 'beams', 'such', 'setting', 'found', 'following', 'storyline', 'oppose', 'waiting', 'robot', 'fight', 'sequences.And', 'film', 'went', 'was', 'so', 'memerized', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'thinking', 'robots', 'story', 'felt', 'classic', 'detective', 'thriller', 'many', 'ways', 'even', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'philosophical', 'times', 'What', 'also', 'film', 'create', 'such', 'experience', 'music', 'cinematography.The', 'original', 'score', 'very', 'subtle', 'yet', 'quite', 'hypnotic', 'thought', 'melodramatic', 'feeling', 'well', 'together', 'such', 'intelligent', 'story.The', 'cinematography', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'drawn', 'case', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'film', 'amazing', 'are', 'few-minute', 'sequences', 'where', 'just', 'show', 'scenery', 'streets', 'Japan', 'subtle', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'are', 'just', 'qualities', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'can', 'appreciate', 'rather', 'younger', 'kids', 'anyone', 'experience', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'especially', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'constantly', 'refered', 'movie', 'film', 'rather', 'cartoon', 'anime', 'what', 'felt', 'very', 'intelligent', 'film.One', 'more', 'thing', 'Patlabor2', 'directed', 'Mamoru', 'Oshii', 'music', 'Kenji', 'Kawai', 'who', 'contributed', 'same', 'efforts', 'film', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'great', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'known', 'many', 'people']",Patlabor 2 VHS

It clearly shows how vulnerable we are, yet how we as a society have done many immoral things.While I digress in the lack of action sequences, there are moments of humor (Ota's training sequence is a riot), and alot of &quot;fisheye&quot; shots.

This is certainly  NOT to say that the home video versions don't do the film justice---they  definitely do.  Even the English-language dubbing is first-rate, which is  something that unfortunately can be said of few English versions of anime.  But the grand scope of the giant-robot dominated universe of Japanese  animation can only be truly appreciated on the movie screen...because as  the American ""Godzilla"" (of all films) said, ""Size DOES  Matter""...just ask anyone who's seen ""Akira"" or ""Ghost In The Shell"" in the theater.
