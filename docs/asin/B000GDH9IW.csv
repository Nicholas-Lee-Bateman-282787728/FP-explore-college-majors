1002094,ABARNA66MT43U,B000GDH9IW,Bonemonkey,"[0, 0]","JCVD has made plenty of crappy movies since the glory days of Bloodsport and Kickboxer. Hard Corps is a prime example. The only possible defense I can think of is that it actually gets better as it progresses. The problem with this defense is that it starts off being completely and utterly terrible, and then slowly progresses to being just plain bloody awful. The storyline (kind of) goes -Our hero - Phil (JCVD) has been trained to run sideways while firing a machine gun. This skill has made him a war hero (but also a villain if you believe the terrorists version of events). He spends his days sitting on his bed daydreaming about running sideways while firing a machine gun. One day, he decides to take the job of protecting the heavy weight boxing champion of the world (who is only slightly bigger than an average man but has beaten Mike Tyson to a pulp in the past). Some rapper dude wants to bump off the champ and it's up to Phil to save the champ not only from death, but also his own stupidity. The champ goes clubbing even though he knows that he will probably be massacred at some point during the evening. Luckily Phil sees what's happening and quickly runs sideways while firing a machine gun, saving the day and becoming a hero in the eyes of the champs sister. Phil knows that the champ will be mincemeat if he's not always ready to run sideways while firing a machine gun. The champ goes to see his girlfriend but it's an ambush. Phil cannot run sideways (because he is standing in a doorway) so he stands still and fires his machine gun instead. The champ says that this breaches the terms and conditions of their contract and then tells Phil to leave town or else. Phil tells the champ that he wants to settle this dispute in a bare knuckle no holds barred fight to the death. They arrange to meet up and see who is talking crap. They let themselves be punched and kicked for a while and say things like &#34;you feel that b**ch?&#34;. Suddenly they hear the news that someone has kidnapped the champs sister. Phil is not prepared to accept that. They join forces to rescue her and drive to the house where she is waiting to be rescued. The champ suddenly realizes that the rapper dude is to blame, so he decides to beat him up. Someone else shoots at Phil but the bullets cannot harm him as he has already started running sideways while firing a machine gun. They both suddenly realize that they have found friendship while beating the crap out of some rappers. The champs sister and Phil both realize that they love eachother and so decide to get married. The end.Hard Corps may be enjoyed if you get pleasure out of watching a disaster of an action film. Have a laugh at the silly gun fights and ridiculous gangster rappers. But if you want to feel any emotional connection, watch A.W.O.L instead.",1,Hard corps can run sideways (while firing a machine gun)...,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,2823,"['JCVD', 'made', 'plenty', 'crappy', 'movies', 'glory', 'days', 'Bloodsport', 'Kickboxer', 'Hard', 'Corps', 'prime', 'example', 'only', 'possible', 'defense', 'can', 'think', 'actually', 'better', 'problem', 'defense', 'being', 'completely', 'utterly', 'terrible', 'then', 'slowly', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'bloody', 'awful', 'storyline', 'kind', '-Our', 'hero', 'Phil', 'JCVD', 'been', 'trained', 'run', 'sideways', 'firing', 'machine', 'gun', 'skill', 'made', 'war', 'hero', 'also', 'villain', 'believe', 'terrorists', 'version', 'events', 'days', 'sitting', 'bed', 'daydreaming', 'running', 'sideways', 'firing', 'machine', 'gun', 'One', 'day', 'take', 'job', 'protecting', 'heavy', 'weight', 'boxing', 'champion', 'world', 'who', 'only', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'average', 'man', 'beaten', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'pulp', 'past', 'rapper', 'dude', 'bump', 'off', 'champ', 'up', 'Phil', 'save', 'champ', 'not', 'only', 'death', 'also', 'own', 'stupidity', 'champ', 'clubbing', 'even', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'massacred', 'point', 'evening', 'Luckily', 'Phil', 'what', 'happening', 'quickly', 'runs', 'sideways', 'firing', 'machine', 'gun', 'saving', 'day', 'becoming', 'hero', 'eyes', 'champs', 'sister', 'Phil', 'champ', 'will', 'be', 'mincemeat', 'not', 'always', 'ready', 'run', 'sideways', 'firing', 'machine', 'gun', 'champ', 'see', 'girlfriend', 'ambush', 'Phil', 'can', 'not', 'run', 'sideways', 'standing', 'doorway', 'so', 'still', 'machine', 'gun', 'instead', 'champ', 'terms', 'conditions', 'contract', 'then', 'Phil', 'leave', 'town', 'else', 'Phil', 'champ', 'settle', 'dispute', 'bare', 'barred', 'fight', 'death', 'arrange', 'meet', 'up', 'see', 'who', 'talking', 'crap', 'let', 'be', 'punched', 'kicked', 'while', 'say', 'things', '34', 'feel', 'b**ch', '34', 'Suddenly', 'hear', 'news', 'someone', 'kidnapped', 'champs', 'sister', 'Phil', 'not', 'prepared', 'accept', 'join', 'forces', 'rescue', 'drive', 'house', 'where', 'waiting', 'be', 'rescued', 'champ', 'suddenly', 'rapper', 'dude', 'blame', 'beat', 'up', 'Someone', 'else', 'shoots', 'Phil', 'bullets', 'can', 'not', 'harm', 'already', 'started', 'running', 'sideways', 'firing', 'machine', 'gun', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'have', 'found', 'friendship', 'beating', 'crap', 'rappers', 'champs', 'sister', 'Phil', 'realize', 'love', 'eachother', 'so', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'end.Hard', 'Corps', 'may', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'get', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'disaster', 'action', 'film', 'Have', 'laugh', 'silly', 'gun', 'fights', 'ridiculous', 'gangster', 'rappers', 'want', 'feel', 'emotional', 'connection', 'watch', 'A.W.O.L', 'instead']",The Hard Corps

Fight scenes are more brawl-like than martial arts like, and gun fights seem to have taken more of role.  This is extremely true of the Hard Corps, a very enjoyable action movie that has good action, but even better suspense.  The acting and story itself are a bit weak, so this is a movie that is exciting the first time around, but may be difficult to watch over and over like the classic Van Damme films.Van Damme plays an ex-army troubled army officer, hired to protect a huge boxer in town named Wayne Barclay, who is famous for his skills and for puttin away his nemesis, Terell, who is a big time rapper.  Terell gets out of jail and has revenge on his mind for the boxer.  Phillip (Van Damme) puts together a team known as the Hard Corps to protect the boxer, but thins don't go so smoothly.  There are a lot of scenes where Terell and his gang get real close to killing Wayne, creating lots of suspense.  There are not a huge amount of fights, but you get a few good brawls from the main characters.This is a solid movie that is great to watch the first time around, especially if you love gang-type films with lots of rap for the soundtrack.  I can't see this being very exciting though the 2nd time watching, since the suspense was really the only element that stuck out.",3,you will only enjoy it the first time,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,1438,"['Van', 'Damme', 'pump', 'out', 'movies', 'day', 'martial', 'arts', 'edge', 'worn', 'off', 'aging', 'star', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'become', 'basic', 'action', 'Fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'brawl-like', 'martial', 'arts', 'gun', 'fights', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'role', 'extremely', 'true', 'Hard', 'Corps', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'even', 'better', 'suspense', 'acting', 'story', 'are', 'bit', 'weak', 'movie', 'exciting', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'watch', 'classic', 'Van', 'Damme', 'films.Van', 'Damme', 'ex-army', 'troubled', 'army', 'officer', 'hired', 'protect', 'huge', 'boxer', 'town', 'named', 'Wayne', 'Barclay', 'who', 'famous', 'skills', 'puttin', 'away', 'nemesis', 'Terell', 'who', 'big', 'time', 'rapper', 'Terell', 'jail', 'revenge', 'mind', 'boxer', 'Phillip', 'Van', 'Damme', 'together', 'team', 'known', 'Hard', 'Corps', 'protect', 'boxer', 'thins', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'smoothly', 'are', 'lot', 'scenes', 'where', 'Terell', 'gang', 'get', 'real', 'close', 'killing', 'Wayne', 'creating', 'lots', 'suspense', 'are', 'not', 'huge', 'amount', 'fights', 'get', 'few', 'good', 'brawls', 'main', 'characters.This', 'solid', 'movie', 'great', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'especially', 'love', 'gang-type', 'films', 'lots', 'rap', 'soundtrack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'very', 'exciting', '2nd', 'time', 'watching', 'suspense', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'element', 'stuck', 'out']",The Hard Corps
1002098,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000GDH9IW,Jason,"[3, 3]","The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1.  Who is he? He's a hallucination-prone, recovering alcoholic, troubled former U.S. soldier Phillippe Sauvage who served in Afghanistan and a few times in Iraq.2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged? His former Sergeant Major, with whom he served multiple tours, was killed in a shootout.3.  Does he take his shirt off? Unbelievably, it doesn't happen.4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress? It was probably a deleted scene (or will be in the sequel), but JCVD hit the jackpot in this one and he hooked up with Tamara Barclay (Vivica A. Fox).  C-List?  Pshaw!!5.  Is there a tournament? He trains several novice bodyguards like there is going to be a tournament, but it's just to protect the champ.6.  Is training needed for this tournament? In a surprise twist, JCVD trains others!7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  The actual splits aren't done, but in the penultimate battle, he does a kick that exposes ""Big Jim and the Twins"" to the enemy - close enough.8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  No, but one of Wayne's booty-call girls field-goals a thug's balls somewhere near his esophagus.9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  Good ol' JCVD, he had me going for a while.  He saved the 360-goodness for the very end.10.  Is his enemy unbeatable? Hardly.  A group of ignorant thugs who hold their pistols sideways do not a formidable enemy make.11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being fragile and suffering from PTSD, there are no real injuries of which to speak.12.  Does he win? He basically assassinates everyone; so, I'd call that a win.A former boxer, Wayne Barclay, needs protection from a clich&eacute;-ridden Suge Knight wannabe.  Eventually, a battle-hardened Sauvage (JCVD sporting a huge, baseball-sized knot on his head throughout the movie) is hired and tasked to build his own security team.  The people he plans on hiring are the ""hardest of the hard corp,"" but that basically ends up being one former soldier buddy and a few people from Barclay's gym.To summarize this movie, I'd borrow a line from Wayne: it's like ""pouring water on $*&# and calling it gravy"".  The convoluted plot, the stereotypical black characters, and the paint-by-numbers approach shouldn't work.  It should be ridiculous.  Adding JCVD's over-complicated character is brilliant.  It's never enough for JCVD to have a drinking problem in a movie; the character has to be riddled with problems and responsible for the My Lai Massacre in order for JCVD to bite.  Somehow, however, all of it together simply works.As far as production value goes, it's slightly better than average for JCVD.  It steals bits from several other movies (The Bodyguard,Major League,Four Brothers,Rocky II,Romeo Must Die,New Jack City,Jungle Fever) but ends up providing a relatively new, enjoyable experience.  Watch this movie.  That's an order, soldier.",4,JCVD stepping a bit outside his comfort zone,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,2953,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1.', 'Who', 'hallucination-prone', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'troubled', 'former', 'U.S.', 'soldier', 'Phillippe', 'Sauvage', 'who', 'served', 'Afghanistan', 'few', 'times', 'Iraq.2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'former', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'whom', 'served', 'multiple', 'tours', 'was', 'killed', 'shootout.3', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'Unbelievably', ""n't"", 'happen.4', 'Does', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'was', 'probably', 'deleted', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'JCVD', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'one', 'hooked', 'up', 'Tamara', 'Barclay', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'C-List', 'Pshaw', '5', 'there', 'tournament', 'several', 'novice', 'bodyguards', 'going', 'be', 'tournament', 'just', 'protect', 'champ.6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'surprise', 'twist', 'JCVD', 'others', '7', 'Does', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'actual', 'splits', 'are', ""n't"", 'done', 'penultimate', 'battle', 'kick', 'Big', 'Jim', 'Twins', 'enemy', 'close', 'enough.8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'No', 'one', 'Wayne', 'booty-call', 'girls', 'field-goals', 'thug', 'balls', 'somewhere', 'esophagus.9', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'Good', 'ol', 'JCVD', 'had', 'going', 'while', 'saved', '360-goodness', 'very', 'end.10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'Hardly', 'group', 'ignorant', 'thugs', 'who', 'hold', 'pistols', 'sideways', 'do', 'not', 'formidable', 'enemy', 'make.11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', 'Aside', 'being', 'fragile', 'suffering', 'PTSD', 'are', 'real', 'injuries', 'speak.12', 'Does', 'win', 'basically', 'everyone', ""'d"", 'call', 'win.A', 'former', 'boxer', 'Wayne', 'Barclay', 'protection', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'wannabe', 'Eventually', 'battle-hardened', 'Sauvage', 'JCVD', 'sporting', 'huge', 'baseball-sized', 'knot', 'head', 'movie', 'hired', 'tasked', 'build', 'own', 'security', 'team', 'people', 'hiring', 'are', 'hardest', 'hard', 'corp', 'basically', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'former', 'soldier', 'buddy', 'few', 'people', 'Barclay', 'gym.To', 'summarize', 'movie', ""'d"", 'borrow', 'line', 'Wayne', 'pouring', 'water', '*', 'calling', 'gravy', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'characters', 'paint-by-numbers', 'approach', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'should', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'Adding', 'JCVD', 'over-complicated', 'character', 'brilliant', 'never', 'enough', 'JCVD', 'have', 'drinking', 'problem', 'movie', 'character', 'be', 'riddled', 'problems', 'responsible', 'My', 'Lai', 'Massacre', 'order', 'JCVD', 'bite', 'Somehow', 'however', 'together', 'simply', 'works.As', 'far', 'production', 'value', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'JCVD', 'bits', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'Bodyguard', 'Major', 'League', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'Rocky', 'II', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'New', 'Jack', 'City', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'up', 'providing', 'relatively', 'new', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Watch', 'movie', 'order', 'soldier']",The Hard Corps

The current case in point is The Hard Corps. If you have seen The Bodyguard (Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston) you have seen a much better movie, than this low budget rehash.The movie's plot, actor's performances (or lack thereof), and the poor DVD package (only special features are other direct-to-dvd movies, and not even the trailer for this movie), make this a rental only.Van Damme plays an ex-soldier from Desert Storm and he is hired to be a bodyguard to a former boxer, now community leader. He doesn't want Van Damme's protection, but his sister does (played by Vivica Fox--what happened to her since Kill Bill?). There are some fight scenes involving a rap mogul (yes, how could anyone make this up) whom the boxer had sent to prison years earlier, now that he has been released. Drive-by shootings and house break-in attacks sum up the plot. Van Damme is playing very low key, lacking the charisma he showed in his youth. He is not bad, but not good either. For fans looking for a lot of martial arts, you won't find it. A few punches and kicks, but nothing any more spectacular than what he did in Second In Command.If this is the best Van Damme can do these days, I suggest a retirement.

1002104,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000GDH9IW,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","With ""The Hard Corps"", Jean-Claude Van Damme continued his trend of being a step above Seagal and Lundgren when it came to the technical and dramatic quality of their vehicles. In what would be his last film to-date to be directed by longtime collaborator Sheldon Lettich (Lionheart), Van Damme made his somewhat-overdue venture into ""urban"" film - a movie with a predominantly black cast and an environment wherein he is the minority - with pleasantly smooth results. The only major drawback is that the even storyline and decent acting seem to have come at the expense of the movie's action content, which isn't nearly as abundant as I would've preferred.The story: veteran soldier Philippe Sauvage (Van Damme) is employed as the bodyguard of a charismatic boxer-turned-entrepreneur (Raz Adoti,Amistad) threatened by a vengeful music producer and crime lord he helped incarcerate (Viv Leacock,I Spy).The movie opens with a bit of gratuitous slow-motion, and the occasional flashbacks to Philippe's army memories have a vaguely out-of-place feel to them, but beyond that, the film definitely looks better than a lot of other DTV offerings. For a low-budget production, the script by director Lettich and George Saunders (Bloodsport 4: The Dark Kumite) is remarkably big on character examination and relationship development, particularly between Van Damme's and Raz Adoti's characters. For the most part, the acting is good, with Vivica Fox (Kill Bill) as Adoti's sister/manager particularly standing out for her confidence, but surprisingly, Van Damme seems to phone in a performance this time around, seemingly making less of an effort (and definitely less of an impression) than the films he had made in the recent past and would in the near future.The hand-to-hand centerpiece of the movie is a mutual grudge fight between Van Damme and Adoti, which isn't fantastic but is good for what it is. The rest of the action is composed of two major shootouts (this may be the first time Van Damme wields an Uzi) and a couple uneven fights, including a disappointing wrestling match between Van Damme and top henchman Ron Selmour (Kingdom Hospital). Though their quality isn't outstanding, I wouldn't have minded seeing a greater quantity of fistfights - I mean, you'd think there'd be more by default, with both a martial artist and a boxer in the cast of characters. Fans who can get caught up in the story will probably be fine with what's there, and though even I can envision myself giving the movie a higher rating on account of the drama on a better day, this isn't one of them. More action, Sheldon.""The Hard Corps"" enjoys a surprisingly long runtime, going on two hours. This gives the movie a chance to stretch the legs of its storyline a bit, but folks who can't find particular enjoyment in it will probably think the film drags.

1002108,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000GDH9IW,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","The Hard Corps(2006)is a decent action movie with alot of suspense and thrills galore,that still stands up well.It features a majority of black actors and all,along with its' principal star,do a good job of creating and sustaining the tense atmosphere that permeates the film.The story immerses us into the world of gang violence,rivalries and revenge courtesy of its' main nemesis Terrell Singeltery(Viv Leacock).He is a rapper(with a nod to Notrious B.I.G)who has been doing time in prison for murder when he is suddenly let out for good behaviour only part way into his sentence.Heavyweight champion boxer Wayne Barkley(Razaaq Adoti)is worried because he is the one whose evidence was used to put him away in the first place;for the murder of his younger brother.He knows Terrell will be out for revenge...and he is right.Doubly worried is his sister and manager Tamara(Vivica Fox)who insists on tighter and more thorough security for her brother.Their current security head recommends an ex Vietnam and Iran/Afganistan vet and friend Clarence Bowden(Julian Christopher)to head it up.Clarence arrives with Phillip Sauvage(Van Damme)in tow,also a vet of the Afgan/Iraq war but still suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome.The two men's real first test of security comes at a disco where Barkley is attending.All goes fairly smoothly until the party leaves and they are attacked.Bowden is unexpectedly killed in the fire fight and Sauvage is asked to remain on to form a new security team.He makes inquiries of several of his former vets but only one comes to join him.Barkley takes him to the boxing club where he got his start and asks Sauvage to pick the remainder of his team from them.Reluctantly Sauvage is forced to acquiesce.Terrell isn't a happy rapper with those that have failed him.In a particularly scary and bloody moment while feeding his kenneled dogs,his first henchman kills one of the young men who failed in the first attempt and feeds his body parts to the animals.The next hit attempt comes one evening when Barkley,who has a girlfriend he often visits for""relaxation"",is visiting her home.The rappers hired men enter the home and have Barkley at a distinct disadvantage when Sauvage and his cohorts intervene and prevent his death.Barkley is next scheduled for a public appearance at an auditorium with the city mayor.Sauvage and his team thwart yet another attempt but subdue the wrong man,Terrell's head henchman.It goes public and Barkley is embarrassed beyond words and lets Sauvage go.It seems the same police lieutenant who had been investigating all of the attempts on Barkley's life also had been dissing Sauvage.He plants the story in Barkley's head that Sauvage was actually drummed out of the army for killing innocent civilians,namely children.That lie coupled with the embarrassment of the moment leads to Barkley's decision.When Barkley refuses to pay what he owes Sauvage the two meet in the gym and fight it out.At a stand still at one point,Barkley's security head enters to say his sister has been kidnapped.Then Barkley receives an urgent call from his girlfriend to come to her place alone.There he finds the police lieutenant,who it seems has been working for Terrell all along.He is to take Barkley to Terrell but again Sauvage and company intervene and the team goes to Terrell's on their own terms.Once there the final battle of the movie plays itself out;Terrell and Barkley duke it out while Sauvage and his team rescue Tamara.It is touch and go as the action goes back and forth but eventually the good guys finally win the day.Barkley gets his sister back and his sister gets a new love interest....Sauvage,of course!Well written and played the movie moves along at a decent pace with few slowdowns throughout its' 110 minute run.It is a solid cast all around and Van Damme plays his character of the stress affected vet quite well.There are some very violent moments and Ron Selmour as Terrell's #1 henchman Simcoe,casts a very menacing and effective presence throughout.Technically speaking the DVD is in a 1:85:1 aspect ratio and is quite clear and crisp.Besides the trailer and some previews there is nothing extra in this release.An above average action flick for the fans of Jean Claude and I recommend it.",4,3 1/2 stars for an above average action flick from JCVD.,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,4271,"['Hard', 'Corps', '2006', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'alot',

From Cyborg to Replicant, I've stood by him and his array of slightly predictable yet wildly entertaining films. There were hiccups along the way such as Universal Soldier 2, Knock Off and Street Fighter, but overall, JC has put out some of the best action films of the late eighties and nineties.Unfortunately, I think it's time he throws in the towel and retires from the cinematic limelight. Compared to some of his recent flops, The Hard Corps isn't horrible; it's just bad. The movie is a stretch to hold your attention. You really don't care due to the poor acting, poor script and poor direction of Sheldon Lettich. (BTW, Mr. Lettich knocked out such classics as Bloodsport and Kickboxer, but he has hit the wall in terms of creativity.) Van Damme is known for his martial arts, but the last several films have portrayed him as too old to do what got him to where he is. Maybe he can't do the splits anymore; maybe he can't do a roundhouse anymore, and maybe we just couldn't care less anymore. Where are the vintage scenes from Timecop or Hard Target?

Some JCVD fans may be dissapointed due to the minimal martial arts scenes in this film.However, this is not a martial arts movie, it is a suspense drama movie that contains more acting and less fighting. With that in mind, I see this film as a transition for Van Damme who appears to be stepping away from martial arts films and stepping toward suspense movies.Van Damme delivers an emotional yet highly entertainingperformance as a military veteran who is haunted by an accidental bombing of innocent civilians and many children by terrorists.  There are some flash back scenes which vividly show Van Damme's inner struggle to cope with the painful memory of war.Vivica Fox manages her famous brother who is an ex-athlete turned business man. The bad guys want to ""eliminate"" Vivica's brother by any means neccessary. Basically, Van Damme is hired as a bodyguard to protect her brother from the bad guys.  That is where the movie takes a turn from action to drama. The supporting cast (including the bad guys) are believable. Also, there is a very shocking torture scene involving pitbulls!Van Damme has truly ""stepped up to the acting plate"", so to speak.I rate this movie 5 stars because of the gripping plot and as always, Van Damme shows that he is more than just an athlete & martial artist.

Of course the brother is hard headed so he's always getting close calls (which helps move the story even though that's dumb) Van damme doesn't do a split in this one.!!!Negativesthe cover is kind of misleading to the storyline. I thought Vivica would be on the run and he needed to protect her (like that movie with William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford).Not enough storyline to warrant why Vivica would date Van Dammme. but it's typical van damme so you have to just go with it.

1002113,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000GDH9IW,trebe,"[2, 3]","The Hard Corps (2006) is an off-beat, mildly amusing action feature, that makes a bid for the hip hop audience.  Action star Jean-Claude Van Damme is Philippe Sauvage, an ex-soldier, now doing personal security work.  Retired boxer Wayne Barclay (Razaaq Adoti), needs protection, when Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock), a man he helped send to prison, is released early.  Reluctantly hired by Barclay's sister Tamara (Vivica A. Fox), Sauvage is given complete control over Barclay's security, after he saves the fighter's life in an attempted hit.Sauvage's assembled team of bodyguards play to mixed reviews, as they foil another attempt on Barclay's life, but the results are not as good at a rally, where the bodyguards apparently take down an innocent man.  Barclay likes doing things his way, with his emotions often getting the better of him.  Singletery is determined to see Barclay dead, and when he abducts Tamara, it sets the stage for a cartoonish final showdown, which features more of Adoti's fighting skills than Van Damme's.The film is written and directed by Sheldon Lettich.  A frequent collaborator with Van Damme, Lettich also wrote and directed Lionheart (1990), and Double Impact (1991), which featured Dennis Rodman.  An action feature that was not meant to be realistic or taken seriously, The Hard Corps mixes gunplay, with a bit of fighting, and a sprinkle of race based humor.
