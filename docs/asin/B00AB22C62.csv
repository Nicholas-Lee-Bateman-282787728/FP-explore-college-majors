1607494,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AB22C62,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","As a great showcase for underrated actor Robert Carlyle, Marshall Lewy's character study ""California Solo"" gives him one of his most fully realized roles in years. Truly, I am a fan of Carlyle. Sometimes, though, I forget just how good he can be. This low-key indie really lets Carlyle tap into the depths of the central character. There is no big plot or major drama in this modestly scaled picture, just one man shaken from routine and apathy to look at the life he's chosen and the one he's left behind. Carlyle is so natural, so believable, and so comfortable in the skin of a former British rocker living a quiet life in America! And it's this easy performance that carries ""California Solo"" to success. The screenplay develops a realistic situation and Carlyle sells it at every turn. There is no artifice in this understated presentation, just a compelling reflection of a life lived.Set in the rural outskirts of Los Angeles, Carlyle (once a famed wild child) lives a subdued existence tending to an organic farm. He still has a certain charm and a way with the ladies, and he enjoys a comfortable numbness in emotional solitude. A drunk driving stop, however, will abruptly end this way of life. Threatened with deportation, Carlyle starts to scramble. His legal woes and precarious position threaten a burgeoning new romance and will have him reuniting with a family long abandoned. The occurrence shakes him from the post-fame ennui that has defined him for decades. But in discovering what he values, might it be a little too late to matter? Again, the film just flows over the viewer in an incredibly subtle way. It gives Carlyle the chance to really open up and it's a fantastic performance.I appreciated that Carlyle was allowed to be a complex persona. Selfish and unlikable at times, he is never alienating. It would have been easy to make him a complete boor, but there is a real heart beating in ""California Solo."" You realize he's not a bad guy even if he commits bad acts. And in this new crisis, a form of redemption is possible. But this is not mushy and sentimental and the screenplay doesn't sell Carlyle out for cheap catharsis. I, for one, found this refreshingly honest. If you want a big plot driven movie, this isn't it. But as a quiet character contemplation, this movie has surprising edge and unexpected heart. I never knew quite where Carlyle was going to take me, and so I was fully invested in his journey.

After watching the movie, I'm not surprised it received such acclaim. It's a terrific character study about an endearing former rock star I couldn't help but feel for. Carlyle's ability to convey MacAldonich's internal and external struggles was mesmerizing. Even when he didn't speak a word, his body language said everything. As expected, Michael Des Barres' role as the former manager of MacAldonich's dissolved band was delightfully charming. And at one hour and 35 minutes, this movie doesn't overstay its welcome.

This is a story about a former British rocker who has had a season of success, apparently, with his band, until his brother died.  Now we see him, strangely, working as a laborer in an organic farm somewhere on the outskirts of LA.  He's no longer young, his face is lined, his hair is thin and has a lot of gray in it.  But he still has a certain charm, especially when he's been drinking and he seems to be a good hearted lad.  The Scottish accent, as he says, makes Americans trust him.  I don't about that but it goes a long way towards likability.Carlyle's performance is the main reason to see the film but the story itself is nicely told, realistic and has a satisfying resolution.  There are some lovely shots of the farm.  Most of the supporting cast is good, with the possible exception of the love interest.

1607498,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00AB22C62,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[5, 5]","This 95-minute film was an ""Official"" selection at Sundance and probably played many other film festivals. It's definitely an independent film on a small budget. Its 30 locations were shot in an amazingly short 21 days.  (You learn this from the ""Making of..."" featurette in the DVD bonuses.The one ""name"" actor is Scottish actor Robert Carlyle (who I must admit has an accent thick enough that I know I missed some of his dialogue. And, there are no ""subtitle options"", which might have helped). He's well-known but was new to me. His character, Lachlan MacAldonich, was in a UK rock band with his brother but - for reasons you will learn in the film - he left the band (well, it broke up) and has been living in California (outside LA ) for the last 10 years. One think you learn about Lachlan is that he drinks a lot. (If the liquid consumed in this film was real alcohol, a good portion of the budget would have been spent on it.) Writer/Director Marshall Lewy intends for Lachlan's character to be one that some of the audience take compassion for and other see him as a loser. He does make some really stupid moves. I won't go into details that will tell you how the story ends. That would give away too much.There are other characters in Lachlan's life in the film but they are - in my opinion - thinly drawn. The main one is Beau - who is described on the package as being ""a lovely struggling actress"". I don't ever remember her ""occupation"" being mentioned in the film but the central part of the story is that both Lachlan and Beau each have ""problems"" and may save each other. Lachlan's problem is of course his alcoholism but all we know about Beau is that she has ""some bad days"". (At least I couldn't figure out what her problems were.). Near the end we meet Lachlan's ex-wife and teenage daughter and the story changes again. I like independent films and gave this one a chance and the time was well spent. But I kept getting the feeling that Director Lewy was so excited to get a ""name"" actor in his film, that he concentrated on Lachlan so much he left loose ends for the other characters. (He gloats about Carlye signing on to the film in that ""Making of ... short"".As noted above there is the nine-minute ""Making of.."" short as well as A (just one) deleted scene lasting 2  minutes. The theatrical t5railer is there too. That's it for bonuses.I'll recommend this to those who like to take a chance on  American independent films.
