And by that I mean even though CHOBITS is set in the not so distant future it's a completely charming and accurate slice of modern, young Japanese life.Hideki is a modern day ""ronin,"" a highschool graduate who failed to pass the notoriously difficult Japanese university entrance exams so must go to a special cram school in order to take the test again. Since the tests are only offered once a year, Hideki has ample time to study. But he's sidetracked once he finds a beautiful ""Persocon"" android wiht a mysterious and complex past.The anime series goes on for 26 episodes and sometimes you wonder where the series is headed while star Hideki's ""Aww shucks"" ignorant bumpkin personality can wear a little thin at times over the nearly 13 hours the complete series runs.

734843,A2V026TK7H80V3,B000087F6V,Carl Cheng,"[12, 12]","I took a chance on this series by CLAMP (the group that brought you Cardcaptor Sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, and X, just to name just a few) but don't expect to find the playful, innocent nature that you find in Cardcaptor Sakura because it is more adult themed, thus earning a 16+ ranking from Pioneer.A little background on the story from what you just know from the first volume.  In a more advanced present day, Hideki Motosuwa (the main male character) decides to move to Tokyo from the countryside to study to get into college as he was rejected this year.  He is amazed by the vast technology that surrounds him as Persocoms (short for personal computer or ""person on computer"") are roaming the streets with the public.  These persocoms are not the desktops that you have in your houses; these are all in the form of people, toys, or animals.  Just to his luck, he finds Chi lying in the trash.  Now, all this happens with not-so-subtle adult jokes.  I was a little turned off by this but the fact that there was no direct nudity or need to accentuate anything like that put me more at ease.  So the real thing that was perverted in a sense is the jokes or gestures, which both I can handle and put aside to enjoy the show.  If you are a little skeptical, then try to watch a few episodes beforehand to see if you would want to buy it instead.Next, the packaging is simply breathtaking.  Oddly enough, Pioneer packed in a limited supply of a Chobits stationary set.  It looks like a cosmetic case (in pink and white) but within has a letter opener, pencil, eraser, and scissors.  As many companies are now releasing box sets with their releases, it seems to have lost its value as they are plainer than others but this one is easily an exception.  The top is very simple (which I think it should be) with just a picture of Sumomo (Hideki's friend's Persocom).  On the back of the box is a very nice picture of Hideki and Chi outside a window on a sunny day.  It's very refreshing.  One side of the box shows a very beautiful picture of Chi in a pink dress with red ribbons watching the cherry blossoms blow away from her hand.  On the other side, there are three darker characters surrounding Chi, in pink, in the center.  This really works well as it accents Chi as the pink is brighter than the surrounding black of the other characters.  One of the darker characters looks like a darker Chi while the other two haven't been revealed yet.  This makes me eager to watch more as it seems the light-hearted nature that was seen in the first volume will change to a darker, deeper, tone.  On the packaging of the DVD, Pioneer decided to use a hand-drawn manga (Japanese comic) picture of Chi sitting and smiling atop a telephone pole.  While I am sometimes iffy about using manga art for DVD volumes, as they are separate things in ways, this works out really well.  The colors are vibrant, yet also subtle.  It creates a very refreshing scene.  The back does well with listing the volume number and episode titles.  Being a dork, I notice the fonts and that its variety is nice and style works well with the technological theme of the show.Another thing that this release amazed me with was the amazing quality of the animation on DVD.  Lines were so crisp and clear and the backgrounds were subtle and did very well with supporting the characters in the scenes.  The sound quality is also very nice.Final Note: I am still worried about the fact that companies are cutting down on episodes per DVD on more popular titles.  This release is going to span seven volumes, when it could just as easily fit six.  With the variety of releases nowadays, it is harder to buy all that you want to so it would be easier if the companies helped out in that aspect.  But on another note, I'm happy with the packaging.  I hope for the same quality from other companies and for Pioneer to step up another notch and wow me again.  I look forward to this release to unfold the mystery of Chi and ""Chobits.""",4,Clamp's Newest,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,3996,"['took', 'chance', 'series', 'CLAMP', 'group', 'brought', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'Magic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'X', 'just', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'playful', 'innocent', 'nature', 'find', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'more', 'adult', 'themed', 'thus', 'earning', '16+', 'ranking', 'Pioneer.A', 'little', 'background', 'story', 'what', 'just', 'know', 'first', 'volume', 'more', 'advanced', 'present', 'day', 'Hideki', 'Motosuwa', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'move', 'Tokyo', 'countryside', 'study', 'get', 'college', 'was', 'rejected', 'year', 'amazed', 'vast', 'technology', 'Persocoms', 'short', 'personal', 'computer', 'person', 'computer', 'are', 'roaming', 'streets', 'public', 'persocoms', 'are', 'not', 'desktops', 'have', 'houses', 'are', 'form', 'people', 'toys', 'animals', 'Just', 'luck', 'Chi', 'lying', 'trash', 'Now', 'not-so-subtle', 'adult', 'jokes', 'was', 'little', 'turned', 'off', 'fact', 'was', 'direct', 'nudity', 'need', 'accentuate', 'anything', 'put', 'more', 'ease', 'real', 'thing', 'was', 'perverted', 'sense', 'jokes', 'gestures', 'can', 'handle', 'put', 'aside', 'enjoy', 'show', 'are', 'little', 'skeptical', 'then', 'try', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'beforehand', 'see', 'would', 'want', 'buy', 'instead.Next', 'packaging', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Pioneer', 'packed', 'limited', 'supply', 'Chobits', 'stationary', 'set', 'cosmetic', 'case', 'pink', 'white', 'letter', 'opener', 'pencil', 'eraser', 'scissors', 'many', 'companies', 'are', 'now', 'releasing', 'box', 'sets', 'releases', 'have', 'lost', 'value', 'are', 'plainer', 'others', 'one', 'easily', 'exception', 'top', 'very', 'simple', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'picture', 'Sumomo', 'Hideki', 'friend', 'Persocom', 'back', 'box', 'very', 'nice', 'picture', 'Hideki', 'Chi', 'window', 'sunny', 'day', 'very', 'refreshing', 'One', 'side', 'box', 'very', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'Chi', 'pink', 'dress', 'red', 'ribbons', 'watching', 'cherry', 'blossoms', 'blow', 'away', 'hand', 'other', 'side', 'are', 'three', 'darker', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'Chi', 'pink', 'center', 'really', 'well', 'Chi', 'pink', 'brighter', 'surrounding', 'black', 'other', 'characters', 'One', 'darker', 'characters', 'darker', 'Chi', 'other', 'two', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'revealed', 'yet', 'eager', 'watch', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'nature', 'was', 'seen', 'first', 'volume', 'will', 'change', 'darker', 'deeper', 'tone', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'Pioneer', 'decided', 'use', 'hand-drawn', 'manga', 'Japanese', 'comic', 'picture', 'Chi', 'sitting', 'smiling', 'atop', 'telephone', 'pole', 'am', 'sometimes', 'iffy', 'using', 'manga', 'art', 'DVD', 'volumes', 'are', 'separate', 'things', 'ways', 'out', 'really', 'well', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'yet', 'also', 'subtle', 'very', 'refreshing', 'scene', 'back', 'well', 'listing', 'volume', 'number', 'episode', 'titles', 'Being', 'dork', 'notice', 'fonts', 'variety', 'nice', 'style', 'works', 'well', 'technological', 'theme', 'show.Another', 'thing', 'release', 'amazed', 'was', 'amazing', 'quality', 'animation', 'DVD', 'Lines', 'were', 'so', 'crisp', 'clear', 'backgrounds', 'were', 'subtle', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'supporting', 'characters', 'scenes', 'sound', 'quality', 'also', 'very', 'nice.Final', 'Note', 'am', 'still', 'worried', 'fact', 'companies', 'are', 'cutting', 'down', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'more', 'popular', 'titles', 'release', 'going', 'span', 'seven', 'volumes', 'when', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'fit', 'six', 'variety', 'releases', 'nowadays', 'harder', 'buy', 'want', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'companies', 'helped', 'out', 'aspect', 'note', ""'m"", 'happy', 'packaging', 'hope', 'same', 'quality', 'other', 'companies', 'Pioneer', 'step', 'up', 'notch', 'wow', 'again', 'look', 'forward', 'release', 'unfold', 'mystery', 'Chi', 'Chobits']",N/A
734844,A39LRLKACX89IP,B000087F6V,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[0, 0]","Chobits will at once, remind Anime fans of Hand Made May, Love Hina, and Video Girl Ai. It is similar to these, plus other series involving a clueless ronin, and his collection of lady friends. Fortunately, the similarities end very quickly after about the first third of the series.  A mystery develops, and characters begin to take on some real dimensions.This series is does not just focus on Chi, the android, found in the trash by Hideki.  It focuses on the many relationships people might have, when presented with such lifelike ""helpers"". Many of the motivations behind how characters act in this series, are not revealed until near the end of the series.  Some of them take you totally by surprise.Like most of the series in this genre, one of the main goals is humor, and it succeeds admirably there.  Chi has a knack for getting into some funny situations.  The writers do a good job of showing how Chi reacts to the world.  They seem to have a good handle on how an android, with a lack of real-world data, might act in their environment.  This gives the character, a more believable role in the way she (""it?"") reacts in the Anime.Clamp as a group, likes to do a lot of ""conspiracy theory"" stuff.  This series is no exception to that rule.  Fortunately, that is not the whole focus of the series. This is good, the series true focus, is on the growing relationship between Hideki and Chi.  How it plays out in this series, is somewhat different that most of us might expect.",4,Surprisingly good for this type of Anime.,1059264000,"07 27, 2003",2003,1486,"['Chobits', 'will', 'once', 'remind', 'Anime', 'fans', 'Hand', 'Made', 'May', 'Love', 'Hina', 'Video', 'Girl', 'Ai', 'similar', 'other', 'series', 'involving', 'clueless', 'ronin', 'collection', 'lady', 'friends', 'Fortunately', 'similarities', 'end', 'very', 'quickly', 'first', 'third', 'series', 'mystery', 'develops', 'characters', 'begin', 'take', 'real', 'dimensions.This', 'series', 'not', 'just', 'focus', 'Chi', 'android', 'found', 'trash', 'Hideki', 'many', 'relationships', 'people', 'might', 'have', 'when', 'presented', 'such', 'helpers', 'Many', 'motivations', 'how', 'characters', 'act', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'revealed', 'end', 'series', 'take', 'totally', 'surprise.Like', 'most', 'series', 'genre', 'one', 'main', 'goals', 'humor', 'admirably', 'there', 'Chi', 'knack', 'getting', 'funny', 'situations', 'writers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'Chi', 'reacts', 'world', 'seem', 'have', 'good', 'handle', 'how', 'android', 'lack', 'real-world', 'data', 'might', 'act', 'environment', 'character', 'more', 'believable', 'role', 'way', 'Anime.Clamp', 'group', 'do', 'lot', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'stuff', 'series', 'exception', 'rule', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'whole', 'focus', 'series', 'good', 'series', 'true', 'focus', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Hideki', 'Chi', 'How', 'out', 'series', 'somewhat', 'different', 'most', 'might', 'expect']",N/A
734845,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B000087F6V,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[20, 22]","If you have a reasonably strong feminist tilt, or are buying this for a child under 13, read no further...""Chobits"" really isn't for you. If you can keep an open mind and focus on the other main themes explored in this series, then you'll find that most of your time will be spent either watching ""Chobits"" or waiting for the next volume to come out.Hideki Motosuwa, 18, has worked on a farm all his life, and is shattered to find out that he was rejected from the college of his choice. He decides to go to the big city and enroll in a Yobikou or Cram School (similar to Kaplan Prep or Princeton Review programs) to get into school. The first thing that catches his eye is the popular Persocon phenomenon--nearly everyone he sees when he first steps into the city has one form or another of human-looking robot companions (the jutting ear/headpieces being the only way to identify them). Sadly for farm-boy Hideki, they cost an exorbitant amount of money. Still, nearly everyone has one (they're equivalent to the popularity of cell phones for us), and he continues to want one.Leave it to wishful thinking to have Hideki find a near-naked Persocon lying in the trash by his apartment complex. He takes her home and (here comes the PG-13/Feminist Beware part) activates it by pressing in what is quite a special spot. She comes to life but with one flaw: she can only say the word ""Chi.""Through the various friends he makes in this first disc--landlady Hibya, neighbor and classmate Shinbo (and his adorable mini-mobile Persocon Sumomo), as well as Persocon expert/child genius Minoru (and his own Persocon Yuzuki)--Hideki finds that his Persocon (soon to be named ""Chi"") is running without an operating system or learning software, with processing speeds of nearly infinite capacity. Shinbo and Minoru theorize on what Chi could be: a Chobits, a legendary series of Persocons that, above all their unique abilities, can exercise free will.The series continues as such; Hideki juggling school, a part-time job, teaching Chi words and manners, while everyone attempts to find out 1) if Chi is indeed a Chobits, 2) who made her, 3) what her full capabilities are. Several subplots include a mysterious e-mailer sending photos and clues of what appears to be Chi; a series of fairy tale books that hooks Chi, and seem oddly to relate to Hideki and her situation. Thematically, ""Chobits"" puts forth reasonably deep questions regarding identity: what is it to be human? What is it to be a Persocon? And can love cross those boundaries? There is a mid-sized pool of characters in ""Chobits,"" each with their own experiences regarding love and Persocons, as well as two powerful, independent-minded Persocons named Dita and Jima, the former seemingly bent on finding and stopping Chi.The art is great; Japanese animators have become so extremely skilled as to seamlessly integrate computer graphics and effects into the drawings, as well as easily use various lighting and multi-layering techniques. ""Chobits"" features a very active camera that constantly changes angles, zooms in and out, and appropriately get blurry or sharp. The soundtrack includes one of the catchiest opening and ending themes; not since ""Cowboy Bebop"" has the ""adventurous/comedic"" music been so appropriately used, and not since ""Rurouni Kenshin"" has a melancholy piano instrumental been used so perfectly to evoke sadness. The Japanese vocals for Chi and Sumomo better match their images than the English dubs, the only significant vocal difference.The PG-13 issue...There is no flat out nudity or even excessive swearing or violence, but ""Chobits"" certainly doesn't lack for adult topics. Kidnapping, adultery, pornography and inappropriate touches are all covered in ""Chobits."" Thankfully, the computer jargon isn't overwhelming; computer illiterates won't falter since the main character (Hideki) is himself quite a naive dolt when it comes to those things.The feminist issue...This is a series that more likely than not would cause a walkout if it were played on Oprah or The View. Persocons are almost exclusively female in ""Chobits,"" and not once in the 26-episode series, other than Jimma (who appears in the last 1/4 of the series), is a male Persocon brought in as a major character, although you can oftentimes glimpse male persocons in the background. Chi is *extremely* submissive--everything she does is ""to make Hideki happy."" Minoru's Victoria's Secret-clad maids and Sumomo's genie outfit will certainly raise eyebrows as well. But to counter, several female characters do play key, empowered parts: Shimizu the teacher, fierce Persocon Dita, as well as the flipside to landlady Hibya's identity. On a more open-minded level, ""Chobits"" is more concerned with the ideas of love and devotion for those you care for. For each of Chi's submissive actions is a life-risking display by Hideki as well.No giant robots, no major sword and kung fu fights; still, ""Chobits"" is highly watchable for its unique atmosphere, a mystery unfolded at just the right pace, and the eye-candy art. You can forward through three ""recap""-type episodes: one in the middle, the second to last one, and parts of the last episode, all of which merely play montages of what had happened in the series. Highly recommended for most all anime fans.",5,"Not For Feminists And Not For Kids Under 13, But Still Good",1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,5302,"['have', 'reasonably', 'strong', 'feminist', 'tilt',

And its not like, stupid little kid funny, just the situations and hilarious voice acting for Hideki, every time I think about a scene from here, I just burst out laughing!!  It all starts out when Hideki goes off to prep school in Tokyo and finds a persocom, (personal computer) lying in the trash, and she's a cute persocom too.  Persocoms are computers that look, feel, and act exactly like real people.  However, Hideki's persocom is different, the only thing she can say is ""Chi"", and he finds out that she's a custum-made persocom, and nobody seems to know anything about her.  Well, he has to teach Chi, get through his classes, get a job, and find Chi some clothes!!

A farmhand who wants to go to an exclusive college (probably would be a university in the US) gets rejected from his school of choice but decides to go to a prep school in Tokyo (in USA it's a junior college).  Wandering the Tokyo streets, he finds a PC in the trash, brings it to his apartment and activates it-- which immediately prompts him to fall in love with it. (Did I mention that all of the PCs, or Persocoms in this series look like teenage girls?)The pace is slow and easy to follow; the tone is sometimes subtle and frequently frantic-- in the vein of '80s American sitcoms like Three's Company or Bosom Buddies. There is cuteness, but not to the level that would induce diabetes.  There is sexual reference and very brief nudity, but not too extreme.What makes me recommend Chobits?  Clean graphics, simple but engaging stories, and very good voice acting (even by the American cast, which, sadly, is a rarity in anime).The cultural differences aren't too jarring, and are well explained in the plot (for instance, the concept of older ""senpai"" students interacting with younger ones).Strangely, the character who should be the most grating is still very charming.

Clamp is the female artist studio that created the popular Sakura Cardcaptors manga and anime.  Chobits has such a bouncy, catchy, intro that makes it seems like the series will be as innocent as Cardcaptors.  In a way, Chobits is innocent, but it also has some very sexual aspects.  In the first few minutes, the main character Hideki is ranting about how he wants a Persocom to download porn from the Internet.  His porn mags are open, showing hot shots of young girls.  Later on the disc, Hideki visits a young computer prodigy who has a bevy of beautiful Persocoms in highly sexual maid outfits.  This incongruous blend of shoujo and ecchi still is very sweet and moral as a whole.Chobits begins as young Hideki leaves the countryside for the big city of Tokyo as he has to attend prep school because he has failed the entrance examination to college.  This Tokyo is modern day Japan; the slow Japanese economy is mentioned.  But Tokyoites have humanoid robots that they use as PC's.  There are full size ones, and mini ones.  They are almost all female, without exception, and are used sometimes as sex objects - in fact, they have ALL their parts in place.  This subverted sexism can make some female viewers uneasy.  Yet the kawaii quotient is super-high, so it somewhat cancels out the perveted stuff.Hideki is a typical poor college student who cannot afford a Persocom in his dreams.  He mysteriously finds a lovely Persocom tosed out in the trash.  His friend has a (super cute) mini Persocom and helps Hideki get Chi started.  Chi is extremely pretty and naiive. Her new owner is highly aroused.  He is a gentleman with her, though.  Hideki runs into problems with her setup, and the mystery deepens.  Where did Chi come from?  She seems to be custom-made, but by who?  The mystery will deepen in volume two.",4,"Cute, But for Adults",1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,1904,"['Chobits', 'Volume', 'One', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'anime', 'series', 'Clamp', 'Clamp', 'female', 'artist', 'studio', 'created', 'popular', 'Sakura', 'Cardcaptors', 'manga', 'anime', 'Chobits', 'bouncy', 'catchy', 'intro', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'innocent', 'Cardcaptors', 'way', 'Chobits', 'innocent', 'also', 'very', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'main', 'character', 'Hideki', 'ranting', 'how', 'Persocom', 'download', 'porn', 'Internet', 'porn', 'mags', 'are', 'open', 'showing', 'hot', 'shots', 'young', 'girls', 'Later', 'disc', 'Hideki', 'young', 'computer', 'prodigy', 'who', 'bevy', 'beautiful', 'Persocoms', 'highly', 'sexual', 'maid', 'outfits', 'incongruous', 'blend', 'shoujo', 'ecchi', 'still', 'very', 'sweet', 'moral', 'whole.Chobits', 'young', 'Hideki', 'countryside', 'big', 'city', 'Tokyo', 'attend', 'prep', 'school', 'failed', 'entrance', 'examination', 'college', 'Tokyo', 'modern', 'day', 'Japan', 'slow', 'Japanese', 'economy', 'mentioned', 'Tokyoites', 'have', 'humanoid', 'robots', 'use', 'PC', 'are', 'full', 'size', 'ones', 'mini', 'ones', 'are', 'almost', 'female', 'exception', 'are', 'used', 'sometimes', 'sex', 'fact', 'have', 'parts', 'place', 'subverted', 'sexism', 'can', 'make', 'female', 'viewers', 'uneasy', 'kawaii', 'quotient', 'super-high', 'somewhat', 'out', 'perveted', 'stuff.Hideki', 'typical', 'poor', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'Persocom', 'dreams', 'mysteriously', 'lovely', 'Persocom', 'tosed', 'out', 'trash', 'friend', 'super', 'cute', 'mini', 'Persocom', 'Hideki', 'get', 'Chi', 'started', 'Chi', 'extremely', 'pretty', 'naiive', 'new', 'owner', 'highly', 'aroused', 'gentleman', 'though', 'Hideki', 'problems', 'setup', 'mystery', 'deepens', 'Where', 'did', 'Chi', 'come', 'be', 'custom-made', 'who', 'mystery', 'will', 'deepen', 'volume', 'two']",N/A

Chi's different from all the other robots, or persocoms, she's very naive and mysterious. She's capable of learning and is much like a young child exploring her surroundings. Her childlike learning process is very believable, and you won't be able to help but fall in love with her.Hideki reflects Chi's naivety nicely, as he's from the country and new to the hustle and bustle of city life. The similarities and contrasts between the two are very well done. They're an unlikely but awesome duo.The show just gets rounded out with more and more well done characters, such as the easily scared Sumomo, who's about 8 inches tall.Really, it's a very cute show, and lots of fun to watch.

That being said, the anim&eacute; leaves a lot to be desired.First of all they have censored the series!  This is the same kind of Cartoon Network garbage that has been pulled on Tenchi Muyo, Ranma 1/2, even Sailor Moon!  There are important storyline reasons for leaving the story as it was written.  Censoring out nudity (and the original amount of nudity in this series was practically nill in the first place), violence, language, etc. hurts the story and takes away from the realism.  I have said it before, and I will say it again, &quot;anim&eacute;&quot; is *not* synonymous with &quot;cartoon.&quot;  Leave the series as it was originally written, they wrote it that way for a reason!  It seems the major reason American companies are pulling this garbage is because anim&eacute; is animated, and therefore it must be a &quot;cartoon,&quot; so therefore it must be intended for children right?  Wrong!  There are very few Japanese anim&eacute; series that are intentionally aimed at child audiences (at least American children, Japanese children are exposed to much more, much sooner).That being said (okay, ranted) I *will* say that except for the censorship -- the series is pretty faithful to the manga.  The character voices are pretty much what I was imagining when I read the manga.  One small point that annoys me is they have changed Plum's name to the Japanese &quot;Sumomo.&quot;  Sumomo means plum in Japanese, but it just isn't as cute as plum.  What is interesting is that they use the Japanese name Sumomo in both the English dub and the Japanese voice version with English sub-titles.The animation is clean and clear, very smooth and soft -- as the manga was originally drawn.  They do engage in an annoying cut-scene with cheesy graphics whenever Hideki is thinking hard about something, or is embarrassed or fantasizing, but other than that the animation is eye pleasing.Bottom line, the main basic storyline is still intact -- just censored.  The voice acting is acceptable (in both English and Japanese versions).  The animation is clean and bright and eye pleasing.

It was hard to believe men would only use ""hot"" persocoms for internet, errands, and other domestic duties.I agree with Mr. Solomon's review that this does feed into an outdated outlook that a women's purpose in life is to please a man. It was quite a relief that Mr. Hideki showed some honor by making Chii's happiness a priority. However, there was too much emphasis on Chii wanting to please Hideki and earn her owners affection. Frankly it sort of annoyed me to see a human-like robot having not much of a life. I know that robots' now being created in Japan are to help people, but is it really necessary to feed into a man's desire to have a female (human or robot) living to please only him? This series was almost a carbon copy of &quot;Ai Yori Aoshi&quot;, except the female character is a robot in this series. Anyone ever heard of Feminism?Despite the culture shock I experienced while watching the series, there were some good things about the series. The art is just amazing. The nice numbers of characters are likable and well drawn. The plot is interesting enough to complete the series. The little mobile persocoms are just adorable that I wanted one for myself. I appreciated the issues brought up about robot and human romantic relationships. The conclusion to the issue was rather satisfying and easy to accept, since you feel so sorry for Chii's after awhile. The music was not too cheesy but rather impressive, such as &quot;Ningyo Hime&quot; and &quot;Raison Detre&quot;.I gave the series four stars because it was still interesting and humorous. I found myself really caring about the characters and their situations. Also it had a happy ending, which is hard to come by with some anime.",4,Cute...but not perfect,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,2331,"['completing', 'Chobits', 'Series', 'was', 'left', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'wholestory', 'basically', 'nave', 'nice', 'boy', 'named', 'Hideki', 'who', 'country', 'life', 'city', 'enroll', 'prep', 'school', 'persocom/Chobits', 'human-like', 'robots', 'life', 'forever', 'changed.Watching', 'Hideki', 'experience', 'city', 'life', 'prep', 'school', 'was', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'off', 'very', 'silly', 'dramatic', 'However', 'discovery', 'persocoms', 'human-like', 'robots', 'service', 'humans', 'made', 'cringe', 'Mainly', 'first', 'see', 'female', 'persocoms', 'male', 'persocoms', 'are', 'seen', 'later', 'was', 'hard', 'believe', 'men', 'would', 'only', 'use', 'hot', 'persocoms', 'internet', 'other', 'domestic', 'duties.I', 'agree', 'Mr.', 'Solomon', 'review', 'feed', 'outdated', 'outlook', 'women', 'purpose', 'life', 'please', 'man', 'was', 'quite', 'relief', 'Mr.', 'Hideki', 'showed', 'honor', 'making', 'Chii', 'happiness', 'priority', 'However', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'Chii', 'wanting', 'please', 'Hideki', 'earn', 'owners', 'affection', 'sort', 'annoyed', 'see', 'human-like', 'robot', 'having', 'not', 'much', 'life', 'know', 'robots', 'now', 'being', 'created', 'Japan', 'are', 'help', 'people', 'really', 'necessary', 'feed', 'man', 'desire', 'have', 'female', 'human', 'robot', 'living', 'please', 'only', 'series', 'was', 'almost', 'carbon', 'copy', 'quot', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'quot', 'female', 'character', 'robot', 'series', 'Anyone', 'ever', 'heard', 'Feminism', 'culture', 'shock', 'experienced', 'watching', 'series', 'were', 'good', 'things', 'series', 'art', 'just', 'amazing', 'nice', 'numbers', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'well', 'drawn', 'plot', 'interesting', 'enough', 'complete', 'series', 'little', 'mobile', 'persocoms', 'are', 'just', 'adorable', 'wanted', 'one', 'appreciated', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'robot', 'human', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'conclusion', 'issue', 'was', 'rather', 'satisfying', 'easy', 'accept', 'feel', 'so', 'sorry', 'Chii', 'awhile', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'cheesy', 'rather', 'impressive', 'such', 'quot', 'Ningyo', 'Hime', 'quot', 'quot', 'Raison', 'Detre', 'quot', 'gave', 'series', 'four', 'stars', 'was', 'still', 'interesting', 'humorous', 'found', 'really', 'caring', 'characters', 'situations', 'Also', 'had', 'happy', 'ending', 'hard', 'come', 'anime']",N/A

He sees androids that are near-perfect matches of humans, but can't afford one. He goes home dreaming of owning one, and passes a shut-down persocom, one of the cute androids. He takes it home and activates it, and gains an obedient and loving machine. He meets a sad and beautiful teacher, a cute co-worker, a quiet and pretty apartment owner. He slowly uncovers the story behind each of these three people and a few others, and learns more about what's important in life.About the show:The show, in the beginning, revolves mostly about teaching Chii, the persocom, how to do a daily task, such as cooking, shopping for underwear, or getting a job. At some points the show is a little slow and you might get bored, but it can be funny, dramatic, or cute. If you don't like the cutesy stuff, you might want to look for another show. Chii often acts adorable, complete with making puppy-dog eyes. Sometimes this show portrays the covers of porn mags and some sounds, but no actual nudity. Still, it would probably be uncomfortable watching it with your parents. Later on, you will see some problems caused by persocoms falling in love, and that is the main theme of the show. Can a person and an android fall in love? Should they? You'll find out. The art is beautiful and colorful, and the music is pleasant. I think the voices in both the sub and the dub are good. I recommend this anime.",4,"Not much action, but still fairly interesting",1098057600,"10 18, 2004",2004,1517,"['Story', 'kind', 'young', 'farmer/student', 'failed', 'college', 'exams', 'must', 'go', 'city', 'study', 'prepare', 'next', 'attempt', 'androids', 'are', 'near-perfect', 'matches', 'humans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'one', 'home', 'dreaming', 'owning', 'one', 'shut-down', 'persocom', 'one', 'cute', 'androids', 'home', 'gains', 'obedient', 'loving', 'machine', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'teacher', 'cute', 'co-worker', 'quiet', 'pretty', 'apartment', 'owner', 'uncovers', 'story', 'three', 'people', 'few', 'others', 'more', 'what', 'important', 'show', 'show', 'beginning', 'mostly', 'teaching', 'Chii', 'persocom', 'how', 'do', 'daily', 'task', 'such', 'cooking', 'shopping', 'underwear', 'getting', 'job', 'points', 'show', 'little', 'slow', 'might', 'get', 'bored', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'cute', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'cutesy', 'stuff', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'show', 'Chii', 'often', 'adorable', 'complete', 'making', 'puppy-dog', 'eyes', 'Sometimes', 'show', 'covers', 'porn', 'mags', 'sounds', 'actual', 'nudity', 'Still', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'parents', 'Later', 'will', 'see', 'problems', 'caused', 'persocoms', 'falling', 'love', 'main', 'theme', 'show', 'Can', 'person', 'android', 'fall', 'love', 'Should', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'art', 'beautiful', 'colorful', 'music', 'pleasant', 'think', 'voices', 'sub', 'dub', 'are', 'good', 'recommend', 'anime']",N/A

734863,A6OT14VKILI4X,B000087F6V,V. J. Han,"[9, 9]","My first CLAMP (collective group made by all-female writers) series was ""Angelic Layer"".  While it was fun, but it did not have enough depth to make me think over.  So I find myself pleasantly surprise about this one.In order to stop myself from spoiling over, this starts as a story of a boy with good heart, but gets overboard easily which translates into sort of matchmaker while himself is single.  One day he discovers a persocon (android, that is), and the story begins.While starting seems bit cheesy, it progresses into something more serious about human relationship itself.  Watching Hideki (the main character) interacting and teaching Chii (one in cover) demonstrates the blue print for the perfect relationship.  It blends that ""Love at first sight"" with ""becoming more comfortable as you get older"" in such way that you can't help yourself but to watch more and more.Of course, if the show is all about human relationship, it would be too dry and gooey.  It throws plenty of mishaps involving the characters to make you laugh (especially with Hideki's hobit :)).It is neither as simple as Cardcapter, nor too serious as X, but I find it hitting right balance in between.
