497138,A81P47EIXM8HA,B00000F316,"Richardson ""Clarence""","[14, 14]",4 films from legendary and I use that word with great respect..director John Frankenheimer.  The Train is perhaps one of the last truly great WWII action films in Black and White and featured a gutsy performance by Burt Lancaster. The Manchurian Candidate is a stone classic and the extra features are very well done and  add to the enjoyment.  Ronin is a good example of later work by Frankenheimer and frankly the 2 disc set you can get  on its own has tons of very informative featurettes that go missing on this set...which brings us to The Young Savages..another Frankenheimer and  Lancaster project which sadly is the reason I had to buy this set as I own the other three and this isn't currently being  offered on its own.  Shame on the studios for these tricks.  I think they should not penalize folks who actually buy their movies by bundling  up ones you can only get in sets..with ones that have been out for years...I refuse to devalue this set however it is truly worth 5 stars at the price its offered.,5,VERY GOOD Films...but shame on the studio...again!,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1016,"['4', 'films', 'legendary', 'use', 'word', 'great', 'respect..director', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'Train', 'perhaps', 'one', 'last', 'truly', 'great', 'WWII', 'action', 'films', 'Black', 'White', 'featured', 'gutsy', 'performance', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'stone', 'classic', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'Ronin', 'good', 'example', 'later', 'work', 'Frankenheimer', 'frankly', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'can', 'get', 'own', 'tons', 'very', 'informative', 'featurettes', 'go', 'missing', 'set', 'Young', 'Savages..another', 'Frankenheimer', 'Lancaster', 'project', 'sadly', 'reason', 'had', 'buy', 'set', 'own', 'other', 'three', ""n't"", 'currently', 'being', 'offered', 'own', 'Shame', 'studios', 'tricks', 'think', 'should', 'not', 'penalize', 'folks', 'who', 'actually', 'buy', 'movies', 'bundling', 'up', 'ones', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'sets..with', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'years', 'refuse', 'devalue', 'set', 'however', 'truly', 'worth', '5', 'stars', 'price', 'offered']",The John Frankenheimer Collection (The Manchurian Candidate / The Train / The Young Savages / Ronin)

Someone I know recommended, &#34;The Train&#34; with Burt Lancaster.  These are all old movies before my movie viewing time, so they are all new to me and I thoroughly liked them.  I was surprised to like, &#34;Manchurian Candidate&#34; with Frank Sinatra.  I bought this, quite frankly, because I'm cheap!  I could have rented one movie for just a little less than buying this 4 movie DVD.  To me, buying the DVD for 4 movies was a better buy.  The movies are good and I can watch them again or lend out them out.Good deal.
