Do you believe in Plastic surgery? This is the only debate this show presents. The *cast* of the show that consists of a fair amount of professionals from surgeons to a therapiest all somehow make promises to their emotionally wounded participants that a single nose job, and a triple D cup size as well as other untold numbers of all kinds of surgery imaginable to fix a person's look can vanish ALL their life long problems and miracley heal the scars of the past not just the physical once but also the emotional once that they accumulated all their lives. Or is it?Now, if the contestants in this show were fairly healthy emotionally that is and only looked for an opportunity to fix that nose they never liked or whiten their stained teeth then it's fair to make such a statement and send that kind of message, but when those women that you're working with not only had a rough life but suffer from extremely low self esteem, possible body morphia, anxiety, some form of personality disorder and most of all depression then do you truly believe that getting a hot body and a new face is going to reinvent them completely? Shouldn't you start from the source of these issues instead of going the easy way round and picking the most shallow, superficial solution in the planet? Is that what's considered beauty nowadays?And if such a terrible ideology wasn't bad enough the representation is even worse! This show has no class whatsoever and is incredibly tacky. The cast doesn't involve one likable character even the therapist who is awful at her job they are all shallow and somehow believe that just because every celeb is getting plastic surgery nowadays normal people should follow in their footsteps. The surgeons just want to be recognized and advertise their work to draw more attention to them and gain possible customers who are willing to pay thousands of dollars for a new face, and the participants are just victims in their ploy who got taken advantage of.The sad thing is that none of them were THAT ugly to begin with, by exercising and eating healthy as well as going to therapy in order to get over their low self esteem and issues in their lives and makeup would've made them physically attractive in a healthier manner. Most of them aren't even doing it to please themselves but to please their husbands and somehow save the relationship. Loving yourself is the key to all success and progression if those women hated themselves so much I don't think a mere 3 months of weekly therapy that probably only lasts for An hour if not less is going to solve anything. Ironically they all end up looking similar except for the Hispanic contestants and those from African American origin because they're being *molded* by the same creators. Where is the uniqueness in that?So yeah, I think this show has made a transformation no doubt about that, but is it for the better?",1,Depressing.,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,3231,"[""'ll"", 'give', 'show', '0', 'stars', 'could', 'unfortunately', 'option', 'unavailable', 'amazon.com', 'shame', 'really', 'ratings', 'show', 'deservs', 'truly.I', 'think', 'Question', 'not', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'so', 'called', 'transformation', 'reality', 'based', 'series', 'moral', 'standards', 'ethical', 'Do', 'believe', 'Plastic', 'surgery', 'only', 'debate', 'show', '*cast*', 'show', 'fair', 'amount', 'professionals', 'surgeons', 'therapiest', 'somehow', 'make', 'promises', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'participants', 'single', 'nose', 'job', 'triple', 'D', 'cup', 'size', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'untold', 'numbers', 'kinds', 'surgery', 'imaginable', 'fix', 'person', 'look', 'can', 'vanish', 'life', 'long', 'problems', 'miracley', 'heal', 'scars', 'past', 'not', 'just', 'physical', 'once', 'also', 'emotional', 'once', 'accumulated', 'lives', 'Now', 'contestants', 'show', 'were', 'fairly', 'healthy', 'emotionally', 'only', 'looked', 'opportunity', 'fix', 'nose', 'never', 'liked', 'whiten', 'stained', 'then', 'fair', 'make', 'such', 'statement', 'send', 'kind', 'message', 'when', 'women', ""'re"", 'working', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'rough', 'life', 'suffer', 'extremely', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'possible', 'body', 'morphia', 'anxiety', 'form', 'personality', 'disorder', 'most', 'depression', 'then', 'do', 'truly', 'believe', 'getting', 'hot', 'body', 'new', 'face', 'going', 'reinvent', 'completely', 'Should', ""n't"", 'start', 'source', 'issues', 'instead', 'going', 'easy', 'way', 'round', 'picking', 'most', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'solution', 'planet', 'what', 'considered', 'beauty', 'nowadays', 'such', 'terrible', 'ideology', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'representation', 'even', 'worse', 'show', 'class', 'whatsoever', 'incredibly', 'tacky', 'cast', ""n't"", 'involve', 'one', 'likable', 'character', 'even', 'therapist', 'who', 'awful', 'job', 'are', 'shallow', 'somehow', 'believe', 'just', 'celeb', 'getting', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'nowadays', 'normal', 'people', 'should', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'surgeons', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'recognized', 'advertise', 'work', 'draw', 'more', 'attention', 'gain', 'possible', 'customers', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'new', 'face', 'participants', 'are', 'just', 'victims', 'ploy', 'who', 'got', 'taken', 'advantage', 'of.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'none', 'were', 'THAT', 'ugly', 'begin', 'exercising', 'eating', 'healthy', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'therapy', 'order', 'get', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'issues', 'lives', 'makeup', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'physically', 'attractive', 'healthier', 'manner', 'Most', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'doing', 'please', 'please', 'husbands', 'somehow', 'save', 'relationship', 'Loving', 'key', 'success', 'progression', 'women', 'hated', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mere', '3', 'months', 'weekly', 'therapy', 'probably', 'only', 'hour', 'not', 'less', 'going', 'solve', 'anything', 'Ironically', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'similar', 'Hispanic', 'contestants', 'African', 'American', 'origin', ""'re"", 'being', '*molded*', 'same', 'creators', 'Where', 'uniqueness', 'So', 'yeah', 'think', 'show', 'made', 'transformation', 'doubt', 'better']",The Swan
