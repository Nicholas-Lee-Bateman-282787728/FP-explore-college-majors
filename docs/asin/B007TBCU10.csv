As soon as I heard the intro song I knew my son would love it!  At four years old he is very inquisitive and constantly asking the ""why"" and ""how"" questions! He just started preschool and watching this DVD with him felt like we were in school!It's Halloween and Sid and his friends are dressing up!  When they go to school in their costumes, the teacher gives them lessons on what they are dressed as.  For example, they learn about spiders and how their webs are built.  I liked how it took a break from the cartoon to show real kids building a web.  I feel like this helps with relate ability for my son.  She also taught about bats and skeletons and then there was a fun song ""What's so Scary About me?"" about the ""scary"" animals of Halloween and what they are really are and what they do.The teacher did investigate, explore and discover time that actually showed how to make green slime with real kids!  I am just going to have to try it with my kids!  Simple and fun! It even shows what goes wrong if you add the wrong amount of ingredients.  Brilliant!  At the end the teacher reviews with the kids everything they learned.I was so thoroughly impressed with the educational aspect of this DVD that I will definitely be getting more for my kids!  Entertainment that is educational means no guilt for mom about letting my kids watch TV!",5,Spooktacular Science,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,1426,"['was', 'first', 'time', 'kids', 'have', 'seen', 'Sid', 'was', 'love', 'first', 'watch', 'As', 'soon', 'heard', 'intro', 'song', 'knew', 'son', 'would', 'love', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'very', 'inquisitive', 'constantly', 'asking', 'why', 'how', 'questions', 'just', 'started', 'preschool', 'watching', 'DVD', 'felt', 'were', 'school', 'Halloween', 'Sid', 'friends', 'are', 'dressing', 'up', 'When', 'go', 'school', 'costumes', 'teacher', 'lessons', 'what', 'are', 'dressed', 'example', 'learn', 'spiders', 'how', 'webs', 'are', 'built', 'liked', 'how', 'took', 'break', 'cartoon', 'show', 'real', 'kids', 'building', 'web', 'feel', 'relate', 'ability', 'son', 'also', 'taught', 'bats', 'skeletons', 'then', 'was', 'fun', 'song', 'What', 'so', 'Scary', 'scary', 'animals', 'Halloween', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'are', 'what', 'do.The', 'teacher', 'did', 'investigate', 'explore', 'discover', 'time', 'actually', 'showed', 'how', 'make', 'green', 'slime', 'real', 'kids', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'have', 'try', 'kids', 'Simple', 'fun', 'even', 'what', 'wrong', 'add', 'wrong', 'amount', 'ingredients', 'Brilliant', 'end', 'teacher', 'kids', 'everything', 'learned.I', 'was', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'educational', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'kids', 'Entertainment', 'educational', 'guilt', 'mom', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', 'TV']",N/A

Anytime there is a movie about spiders, bats, and skeletons you have a winner, right? Sid's Spooky Halloween talks about bat ""poop"" which gave my daughter the giggles more than once. The end of the video features an exciting parade to show off the children's costumes.  Such fun!  Definitely a great price for a good video.
