Also a little bit of action and some kind of a cute love story (although some of you might hate the romance).*A few of nostalgic homages to older Futurama episodes (expect to see some familiar characters and some references).*Story was not bad, and contained some interesting ideas (albiet it was strange and went off into some weird directions).*Interesting use of theology (conflict between the robot devil and Yivo made me think a lot of heaven and hell, obviously).*Good music (no musical numbers).The Bad Things*Some parts are weird or gross (like when Leela discovers that the tentacles are really ""gestacles"").  Most likely, they're trying to make it edgier than the show.*All of romance could be seen as sappy.The Questionable Things*Anticlimatic ending.*A little inconsistent with the last episode (considering that Fry went through a whole love spiel with Leela, and then turned around and found a new girlfriend.  Will Fry and Leela ever get together?!).  However, these movies are episodic, not accumilative.While ""Bender's Big Score"" was more like a good Futurama episode, this one is like one of the weaker episodes from the last season.  In particular, it's more of a series of love stories than sci-fi.  It's still good for Futurama fans, but casual viewers are likely to think of this as stupid and strange.The movie has great video and sound quality, and contains numerous special features (a few featurettes, including a full episode made from cut-scenes from the computer game, and probably some other stuff).  Comes in a neat cardboard case (although this may not be good for keeping the disc clean and scratch-free).",4,How Yivo Met Our Universe (aka Day of the Tentacles),1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,1799,"['Good', 'News', 'Everyone', '*Excellent', 'animation', 'quality', '*Some', 'good', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'funny', 'scenes', 'relying', 'too', 'heavily', 'catch', 'phrases', 'old', 'gags', 'Also', 'little', 'bit', 'action', 'kind', 'cute', 'love', 'story', 'might', 'hate', 'romance', '*A', 'few', 'nostalgic', 'homages', 'older', 'Futurama', 'episodes', 'expect', 'see', 'familiar', 'characters', 'references', '*Story', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'contained', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'was', 'strange', 'went', 'off', 'weird', 'directions', '*Interesting', 'use', 'theology', 'conflict', 'robot', 'devil', 'Yivo', 'made', 'think', 'lot', 'heaven', 'hell', 'obviously', '*Good', 'music', 'musical', 'numbers', '.The', 'Bad', 'Things*Some', 'parts', 'are', 'weird', 'gross', 'when', 'Leela', 'tentacles', 'are', 'really', 'gestacles', 'Most', 'likely', ""'re"", 'trying', 'make', 'edgier', 'show', '*All', 'romance', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'sappy.The', 'Questionable', 'Things*Anticlimatic', 'ending', '*A', 'little', 'inconsistent', 'last', 'episode', 'considering', 'Fry', 'went', 'whole', 'love', 'spiel', 'Leela', 'then', 'turned', 'around', 'found', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Will', 'Fry', 'Leela', 'ever', 'get', 'together', 'However', 'movies', 'are', 'episodic', 'not', 'Bender', 'Big', 'Score', 'was', 'more', 'good', 'Futurama', 'episode', 'one', 'one', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'last', 'season', 'particular', 'more', 'series', 'love', 'stories', 'sci-fi', 'still', 'good', 'Futurama', 'fans', 'casual', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'think', 'stupid', 'strange.The', 'movie', 'great', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'numerous', 'special', 'features', 'few', 'featurettes', 'including', 'full', 'episode', 'made', 'cut-scenes', 'computer', 'game', 'probably', 'other', 'stuff', 'Comes', 'neat', 'cardboard', 'case', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'keeping', 'disc', 'clean', 'scratch-free']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

1148928,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00158K0V0,Caleb Williams,"[3, 8]","Although Matt Groening will forever be remembered for his creation of the Simpsons and the total hysteria that still surrounds what many will agree has become a very bad attempt at comedy. Futurama, however, is something truly unique and has the potential to become Matt Groenings best creation especially when it comes to longevity as the mere setting of the show gives it the potential to be truly unique on a constant basis as the creators can truly go wild with the stories. Going wild is something they really have done with this movie as it's something that you feel is truly bizarre even for a comedy like Futurama. The story starts off with how the last movie finished with a big tear in the universe and nobody having a single idea about what it was.At the start we're introduced to the gang in all their glory but we learn that Kif and Amy are having a FonFon Rubok (Wedding) and Fry has a new Girlfriend called Colleen, but there's one problem with Colleen and that's she has 5 other boyfriends. Bender has his role in this movie as after the first attempt to pass through the universal tear and injuring himself in the process, he gets the chance to meet Calculon in hospital and decides he wants to be Calculons official stalker, which leads him into the dark underworld of the League of Robots. Through the movie after Fry breaks up with Colleen he votes himself to enter the rift to explore just exactly what it is that's in the alternate universe, we come to find that it's a huge squid monster names Yivo and it enters on a quest to invade our universe.This is a really good movie and much, much better than the first. The Futurama movies were only made with the intention of being split into episodes for a new season to eventually begin on Comedy Central. They don't seem to look like 3 or 4 episodes put into one long movie. Instead they simply appear as intended and that's a damn good movie. It's filled with some of the best one liners I've heard on an animated show of this kind and one of the best lines were by the character Yivo ""It burns like my gonorrhoea."" This line had me in absolute stitches at the sheer unexpected value of it, this is what makes Futurama so special as it has some of the most creative writing you can imagine. It's not shocking for shocks sake like Family Guy, and it's not ridiculous try hard humour like the current Simpsons seasons it's simply witty comedy that has you roaring with laughter at the genuine wit of the writing.This and Benders Big Score should be added to your DVD collections along with the upcoming Futurama movies which I can imagine to be just as special.",5,The Better Creation By Matt Groening,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,2630,"['Matt', 'Groening', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'remembered', 'creation', 'Simpsons', 'total', 'hysteria', 'still', 'what', 'many', 'will', 'agree', 'become', 'very', 'bad', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'Futurama', 'however', 'something', 'truly', 'unique', 'potential', 'become', 'Matt', 'Groenings', 'best', 'creation', 'especially', 'when', 'longevity', 'mere', 'setting', 'show', 'potential', 'be', 'truly', 'unique', 'constant', 'basis', 'creators', 'can', 'truly', 'go', 'wild', 'stories', 'Going', 'wild', 'something', 'really', 'have', 'done', 'movie', 'something', 'feel', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'even', 'comedy', 'Futurama', 'story', 'how', 'last', 'movie', 'finished', 'big', 'tear', 'universe', 'nobody', 'having', 'single', 'idea', 'what', 'was.At', 'start', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'gang', 'glory', 'learn', 'Kif', 'Amy', 'are', 'having', 'FonFon', 'Rubok', 'Wedding', 'Fry', 'new', 'Girlfriend', 'called', 'Colleen', 'one', 'problem', 'Colleen', '5', 'other', 'boyfriends', 'Bender', 'role', 'movie', 'first', 'attempt', 'pass', 'universal', 'tear', 'injuring', 'process', 'chance', 'meet', 'Calculon', 'hospital', 'be', 'Calculons', 'official', 'stalker', 'dark', 'underworld', 'League', 'Robots', 'movie', 'Fry', 'up', 'Colleen', 'enter', 'rift', 'explore', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'alternate', 'universe', 'come', 'find', 'huge', 'squid', 'monster', 'names', 'Yivo', 'quest', 'invade', 'universe.This', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'Futurama', 'movies', 'were', 'only', 'made', 'intention', 'being', 'split', 'episodes', 'new', 'season', 'eventually', 'begin', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'look', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'put', 'one', 'long', 'movie', 'Instead', 'simply', 'appear', 'intended', 'damn', 'good', 'movie', 'filled', 'best', 'one', 'liners', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'animated', 'show', 'kind', 'one', 'best', 'lines', 'were', 'character', 'Yivo', 'gonorrhoea', 'line', 'had', 'absolute', 'stitches', 'sheer', 'unexpected', 'value', 'what', 'Futurama', 'so', 'special', 'most', 'creative', 'writing', 'can', 'imagine', 'not', 'shocking', 'shocks', 'sake', 'Family', 'Guy', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'try', 'hard', 'humour', 'current', 'Simpsons', 'seasons', 'simply', 'witty', 'comedy', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'genuine', 'wit', 'writing.This', 'Benders', 'Big', 'Score', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'DVD', 'collections', 'upcoming', 'Futurama', 'movies', 'can', 'imagine', 'be', 'just', 'special']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

I enjoyed the first release a great deal, but was less than thrilled with this most recent effort.  While there are several genuinely funny moments, the narrative is disjointed, rambling, and various plot lines don't intersect all that well, and when connections are made they often feel forced and contrived.  If you are not yet a fan but are interested in getting ot know the series, by all means, do so, by starting with Season I.  Jumping in with this feature will only confuse and most likely alienate you and keep you getting to know this smart, hilarious and trenchant TV masterpiece.The bonus features were pretty much the same things offered in most DVDs, previews, deleted scenes, etc., and the staple of animated features, cast readings.  I enjoy this feature when we get to see the actors working, exploring various takes on how to voice a line, but like many others (Family Guy, etc)  this one consists of short shots of the actors screwing up their lines, making faces, or just laughing randomly at some private cast joke.  On those very rare occasions we see the actors really working it's informative and very entertaining; otherwise it's just irritating, and unfortunately, this falls into that category.  The ""lost"" episode, mentioned by several other reviewers, is worth a look.Hard core fan? add it to your collection.  I will keep it and no doubt watch it many more times, but I'll also always know that they are capable of much, *much* better work, and look forward to it in the next release.",3,"For some fans, a disappointment, for the non initiated, utterly confusing",1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,1765,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Futurama', 'fan', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Fox', 'decision', 'cut', 'funny', 'thought', 'provoking', 'series', 'down', 'mid-flight', 'was', 'equally', 'thrilled', 'learn', 'wold', 'rise', 'again', 'form', 'several', 'feature-length', 'DVDs', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'release', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'less', 'thrilled', 'most', 'recent', 'effort', 'are', 'several', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'narrative', 'disjointed', 'rambling', 'various', 'plot', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'intersect', 'well', 'when', 'connections', 'are', 'made', 'often', 'feel', 'forced', 'contrived', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'fan', 'are', 'interested', 'getting', 'ot', 'know', 'series', 'means', 'do', 'so', 'starting', 'Season', 'Jumping', 'feature', 'will', 'only', 'confuse', 'most', 'likely', 'alienate', 'keep', 'getting', 'know', 'smart', 'hilarious', 'trenchant', 'TV', 'masterpiece.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'things', 'offered', 'most', 'DVDs', 'previews', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc.', 'staple', 'animated', 'features', 'cast', 'readings', 'enjoy', 'feature', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'actors', 'working', 'exploring', 'various', 'how', 'voice', 'line', 'many', 'others', 'Family', 'Guy', 'etc', 'one', 'short', 'shots', 'actors', 'screwing', 'up', 'lines', 'making', 'just', 'laughing', 'randomly', 'private', 'cast', 'joke', 'very', 'rare', 'occasions', 'see', 'actors', 'really', 'working', 'informative', 'very', 'entertaining', 'otherwise', 'just', 'irritating', 'unfortunately', 'category', 'lost', 'episode', 'mentioned', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'look.Hard', 'core', 'fan', 'add', 'collection', 'will', 'keep', 'doubt', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times', ""'ll"", 'also', 'always', 'know', 'are', 'capable', 'much', '*much*', 'better', 'work', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'release']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

The show really grew on me, and throughout college, I grown to love the show. I was quite happy to see the show on Cartoon Network, and even more happy when the seasons made it to DVD. Needless to say, I enjoyed probably thousands of hours with Futurama. Recently, the makers decided it was time to re-air the show in the form of movies. I believe altogether, there will be four DVDs although I can't quite remember. The Beast with a Billion Backs is the second DVD released.This DVD starts off where Bender's Big Score left off. The show starts off quite good, but when the movie ends, I felt somewhat disappointed. Normally, Futurama has a formula to it: the team - mainly Leela, Fry, and Bender with support from other members from time to time - work together to resolve some issue. In a Beast with a Billion Backs, the Futurama formula isn't quite there. The story takes a odd turn that it normally doesn't take. By the end of the film, I felt that the characters detached from one another. Like it felt great that it ended with everyone together, but throughout the movie, it felt like it detached some how. Can't really say much without spoiling it for newcomers though.As a Futurama fan possibly talking to another Futurma fan, all I can say is that you should give this movie a shot. I felt the usual Futurama formula wasn't quite there; the characters felt detached somewhat. And on top of all the problems, the story doesn't settle quite well in the stomach.In all, I think the movie was alright.

I have one word of warning for them: Moonlighting. There have been about a half dozen points in the show where the writers could have clicked Fry and Leela together and then just nonchalantly proceeded with them as a couple, the same way they did with Kiff and Amy.

I thought Bender's Big Score was a decent effort showing some rust, so to speak, and that the new releases would get better from there. This one is a letdown, though. No doubt, there are some good jokes, and I laughed here and there during the 90 minutes. But the writing really doesn't feel like Futurama. The grossout and mildly sick humor is amped up (it was always there but balanced with the show's sophisticated writing), and in particular, some of the humor that plays on the film's ""rape"" plot has a slightly ugly edge. There's also a lengthy subplot with Calculon that really drags down the film while offering almost no laughs.The special features are pretty weak too. The deleted scenes reel is very short, the ""blooper"" section is just 2 minutes of the voice actors mugging for the video cameras (though this guy is happy to look at Tress McNeill and Katey Segal), and the full-length ""episode"" created for a video game just doesn't have the laughs.Bottom line: I eagerly awaited this and bought it day of release; I won't be in such a hurry for the next one (which doesn't look so hot, based on the preview included with this one).",3,Too late to go back to the future?,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,1242,"['bought', 'day', 'release', 'course', ""'m"", 'big', 'Futurama', 'fan', 'expected', 'like', 'thought', 'Bender', 'Big', 'Score', 'was', 'decent', 'effort', 'showing', 'rust', 'so', 'speak', 'new', 'releases', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'there', 'one', 'letdown', 'though', 'doubt', 'are', 'good', 'jokes', 'laughed', 'here', 'there', '90', 'minutes', 'writing', 'really', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Futurama', 'grossout', 'mildly', 'sick', 'humor', 'amped', 'up', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'balanced', 'show', 'sophisticated', 'writing', 'particular', 'humor', 'film', 'rape', 'plot', 'slightly', 'ugly', 'edge', 'also', 'lengthy', 'subplot', 'Calculon', 'really', 'down', 'film', 'offering', 'almost', 'laughs.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'weak', 'too', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'reel', 'very', 'short', 'blooper', 'section', 'just', '2', 'minutes', 'voice', 'actors', 'mugging', 'video', 'cameras', 'guy', 'happy', 'look', 'Tress', 'McNeill', 'Katey', 'Segal', 'full-length', 'episode', 'created', 'video', 'game', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'laughs.Bottom', 'line', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'bought', 'day', 'release', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'hurry', 'next', 'one', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'hot', 'based', 'preview', 'included', 'one']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

(That's right, you heard me.) I'm ecstatic that Futurama has returned from the dead, and I totally loved ""Bender's Big Score."" But this new Futurama flick disappoints. Most of what we know and love about Futurama is still here in spades, but this flick suffers from a poorly-developed plot and a degeneration of the show's formerly deep and subversive humor.The 88-minute format is either too long for a compact and focused plotline, or too short for the type of complex story the producers appear to be striving for. The story here jumps around at a very awkward pace and shows signs of severe over-editing. The jokes have been reduced to Family Guy-like asides played for cheap guffaws rather than deep thoughts. (The caped superhero is an unfortunate example, and Bender's firstborn son is a very unfortunate example.)Many holes and inconsistencies in the storyline show that plot construction took a backseat to the more easily written sight gags and cheap asides. (Here's an example that hopefully won't be condemned as a spoiler. Late in the film the new Yivo character says he [sklee] sent an image of himself to artists in our universe, but most of the story is built on the idea that Yivo thought he was alone in all universes.) The fundamental story has also trumped the longstanding strengths of the show. The personalities of Fry and Leela (and important supporting characters like Kif) are inconsistent, Bender has been demoted to an unworkable subplot, and Zoidberg does little more than vomit for simpleminded laughs. There are also many missed opportunities for building upon the cliffhangers left from ""Bender's Big Score.""You can rest assured that the great Futurama animation, music, and voice acting (the actors have always been the show's unsung heroes) won't disappoint this time around. But the writing will. Certain fans may or may not like the basic story, but the bigger point is that everyone will notice the careless and unprofessional defects in the story.

1148946,A105D0UKK3356E,B00158K0V0,Dunestar,"[2, 2]","When Futurama first came out by Groening and Cohen, I thought the premise was great, not too Jetsons, but also not too apocalyptic either.  Basically, it dealt with a hapless delivery boy getting accidentally frozen for one thousand years, and awakens to a freaked out future.Regrettably, thanks to Fox putting it on Football Sundays, the show never really got the notice it deserve, despite the fact it lasted four seasons in its original run.  Yet, it got new life on Adult Swim, and though Comedy Central has it currently, I rarely get to watch it.Anyway, recently the guys at Futurama decided on reviving the series through four new feature-length films.  The original plan was to 'connect' the films from one to another, but apparently Reality has stepped in and dictated otherwise.Whereas 'Bender's Big Score,' did focus on the series' Past Episodes, it seems 'Beast with a Billion Backs' throws out all convention and just starts with cannonizing what we knew of the series itself.Basically the film begins revealing what happened after 'Bender's Big Score,' with the TimeSpace disruption creating an anomaly and ripping a tear in the Universe.Though the tale runs like a typical Futurama episode, the problem here is, the writers have somehow given up on the Fry/Leela romance, while finally marrying Amy and Kiff.  Though which is humourous, it does lack the typical fare we've come to expect with Futurama.Perhaps the writers felt since the last film showed Fry jealous of Leela's romance, maybe it was time for the shoe to be on the other foot.  But the problem is, it's a bit too instantaneous for Fry to find romance.  Considering throughout the series the only person he's actually dated have been Amy and Leela, and his Past girlfriend (who later left him for Pauly Shore).The story's loosely based on a 1955 sci-fi film, ""The Beast with a Million Eyes.""  Except here our Beast takes over with tentacles after Fry decides on leaving his Universe after being unlucky in love once too many times.The problem here is unlike the other film where the characters interacted with each other throughout the main story line, it seems 'Beast' is a bit disconnected with Bender wanting to join the League of Robots, while Fry convinces the people of Earth of the Beast's good intentions.Meaning though you'd like to enjoy this second venture, it's rather hard because it seems more like the writers wanted parodying a classic film than genuinely focusing on why we liked Futurama in the first place.But it doesn't mean the DVD is all bad, we do see some humour with other characters this time around than just focusing on the main characters.  And though the subplots don't have quite the same connection as the first film did, it is fun watching Bender impress Calculon and later subtly take over the League due to the 'Kill All Humans' by-laws.Though it lacks the sharpness of its first incarnate, 'Beast with a Million Backs,' does have some merits by spoofing classic sci-fi as well as the spoof at the beginning intro.Hopefully, 'Bender's Game' will make up for the 'Beast's' shortcomings and bring back the main reason why we miss the Planet Express crew for these years.",3,Futurama's Beast Better than Nothing,1217548800,"08 1, 2008",2008,3181,"['When', 'Futurama', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Groening', 'Cohen', 'thought', 'premise', 'was', 'great', 'not', 'too', 'Jetsons', 'also', 'not', 'too', 'apocalyptic', 'either', 'Basically', 'hapless', 'delivery', 'boy', 'getting', 'accidentally', 'frozen', 'one', 'thousand', 'years', 'freaked', 'out', 'future.Regrettably', 'thanks', 'Fox', 'putting', 'Football', 'Sundays', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'notice', 'fact', 'lasted', 'four', 'seasons', 'original', 'run', 'got', 'new', 'life', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'currently', 'rarely', 'get', 'watch', 'it.Anyway', 'recently', 'guys', 'Futurama', 'decided', 'reviving', 'series', 'four', 'new', 'feature-length', 'films', 'original', 'plan', 'was', ""'connect"", 'films', 'one', 'apparently', 'Reality', 'stepped', 'dictated', 'otherwise.Whereas', ""'Bender"", 'Big', 'Score', 'did', 'focus', 'series', 'Past', 'Episodes', ""'Beast"", 'Billion', 'Backs', 'throws', 'convention', 'just', 'starts', 'cannonizing', 'what', 'knew', 'series', 'itself.Basically', 'film', 'revealing', 'what', 'happened', ""'Bender"", 'Big', 'Score', 'TimeSpace', 'disruption', 'creating', 'anomaly', 'ripping', 'tear', 'Universe.Though', 'tale', 'typical', 'Futurama', 'episode', 'problem', 'here', 'writers', 'have', 'somehow', 'given', 'up', 'Fry/Leela', 'romance', 'finally', 'marrying', 'Amy', 'Kiff', 'Though', 'humourous', 'lack', 'typical', 'fare', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Futurama.Perhaps', 'writers', 'felt', 'last', 'film', 'showed', 'Fry', 'jealous', 'Leela', 'romance', 'maybe', 'was', 'time', 'shoe', 'be', 'other', 'foot', 'problem', 'bit', 'too', 'instantaneous', 'Fry', 'find', 'romance', 'Considering', 'series', 'only', 'person', 'actually', 'dated', 'have', 'been', 'Amy', 'Leela', 'Past', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'later', 'left', 'Pauly', 'Shore', '.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', '1955', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'Beast', 'Million', 'Eyes', 'here', 'Beast', 'tentacles', 'Fry', 'leaving', 'Universe', 'being', 'unlucky', 'love', 'once', 'too', 'many', 'times.The', 'problem', 'here', 'other', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'interacted', 'other', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'bit', 'disconnected', 'Bender', 'wanting', 'join', 'League', 'Robots', 'Fry', 'people', 'Earth', 'Beast', 'good', 'intentions.Meaning', ""'d"", 'like', 'enjoy', 'second', 'venture', 'rather', 'hard', 'more', 'writers', 'wanted', 'parodying', 'classic', 'film', 'genuinely', 'focusing', 'why', 'liked', 'Futurama', 'first', 'place.But', ""n't"", 'mean', 'DVD', 'bad', 'do', 'see', 'humour', 'other', 'characters', 'time', 'just', 'focusing', 'main', 'characters', 'subplots', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'same', 'connection', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'fun', 'watching', 'Bender', 'impress', 'Calculon', 'later', 'subtly', 'take', 'over', 'League', 'due', ""'Kill"", 'All', 'Humans', 'by-laws.Though', 'sharpness', 'first', 'incarnate', 'Million', 'Backs', 'have', 'merits', 'spoofing', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'as', 'well', 'spoof', 'beginning', 'intro.Hopefully', 'Game', 'will', 'make', 'up', ""'Beast"", 'shortcomings', 'bring', 'back', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'miss', 'Planet', 'Express', 'crew', 'years']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

The same can be said to those who wrote a five page thesis of a review.I've watched as much Futurama as anyone.  This movie is outstanding; almost as good as the 4th season of the show.  It's entertaining, trippy, funny, and weird.  The plot doesn't jump around as much as the first movie, and the characters that are in Beast are in it because they should be, not because the writers wanted to revisit every single character.  (By the way, I would have given Big Score 4 stars).I don't understand the complaints about the plot.  The plot has to do with the concepts of heaven, love (and sex), and of alternate universes.  To me, that's pretty deep (right up there with the Godfellas episode in which Bender is God). The sight gags and one liners fit into the movie, not like Family Guy which has to cut to completely unrelated scenes).Yes, some of the humor is gross, but no worse than Zoidburg vomiting up pearls in the hippie episode.

Naturally nobody can agree and when Professor Farnsworth (Billy West) runs afoul of his nemesis Doctor Wernstrom they decide to settle their dispute in a hilarious live action version of title ball. Of course the fact that their debate stems from which of their crews is best suited to get slaughtered by exploring the rift is of little consequence.Once settled the crew of the Planetary Express under the command of Turanga Leela (Katey Sagal), shifts into high gear as their interpersonal relationships and quirks all come into play, often at the worst time which further complicates a bad situation.While this is going on, Bender (John Di Maggio), becomes infatuated with television personality Calculon, and starts down a path that will lead him to becoming part of a secret robotic society whose stated goal is death to all humans.As events unfold, an entity known as Yivo (David Cross), who inhabits the dimension on the other side of the rift, starts to control all of the people of our universe which places Fry in a Pope like position as he and the people start to discover the real reason Yivo is interested in our Universe.Along the way, there are numerous subplots and some truly classic lines from Zap Brannigan and others as the fate of two universes will soon depend on the actions of the highly dysfunctional characters of the story.While some may say the plot of this new Futurama does not grab you the way past episodes did, it does have plenty of humor; much of it comes in scenarios outside the main story arch and allows for some very nostalgic looks book at some of the classic moments from the series. I do not want to spoil any of the surprises, but let's say that the phrase Snu Snu comes back as does some of Bender's past.Since this is the second of four planned DVDs, it is clear that the new offering is laying ground work for the next two films as it does not wrap things up in a tidy bow when finished. Instead it provides plenty of laughs and great moments of nostalgia for fans of the series and loads of extras which include deleted scenes, commentaries, and a look at the next film ""Bender's Game"".All in all a welcome and satisfying film that should delight fans and help keep us happy until the new film arrives in time for the Holidays.4 stars out of 5",4,The Laughs are Solid in this new outing for the Planetary Express crew.,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,3243,"['second', 'straight', 'DVD', 'Futurama', 'movies', 'Futurama', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'arrived', 'loaded', 'laughs.Picking', 'up', 'shortly', 'end', 'previous', 'film', 'Bender', 'Big', 'Score', 'people', 'universe', 'are', 'fear', 'what', 'new', 'inter-dimensional', 'rift', 'will', 'mean', 'are', 'predict', 'end', 'everything', 'coming', 'soon.Back', 'Planetary', 'Express', 'Office', 'life', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'one', 'exception', 'Fry', 'Billy', 'West', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'named', 'Colleen', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'doing', 'well', 'new', 'relationship.Amy', 'Lauren', 'Tom', 'Kip', 'are', 'also', 'doing', 'well', 'relationship', 'buoyed', 'success', 'Fry', 'having', 'decide', 'conduct', 'marriage', 'ceremony', 'Kip', 'swamp', 'filled', 'home', 'planet.Soon', 'delegation', 'leaders', 'cosmos', 'gather', 'listen', 'head', 'Steven', 'Hawking', 'discuss', 'options', 'how', 'deal', 'latest', 'threat', 'universe', 'Naturally', 'nobody', 'can', 'agree', 'when', 'Professor', 'Farnsworth', 'Billy', 'West', 'afoul', 'nemesis', 'Doctor', 'decide', 'settle', 'dispute', 'hilarious', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'title', 'ball', 'course', 'fact', 'debate', 'crews', 'best', 'suited', 'get', 'slaughtered', 'exploring', 'rift', 'little', 'consequence.Once', 'settled', 'crew', 'Planetary', 'Express', 'command', 'Turanga', 'Leela', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'high', 'gear', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'quirks', 'come', 'play', 'often', 'worst', 'time', 'further', 'bad', 'situation.While', 'going', 'Bender', 'John', 'Di', 'Maggio', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'television', 'personality', 'Calculon', 'down', 'path', 'will', 'lead', 'becoming', 'part', 'secret', 'robotic', 'society', 'stated', 'goal', 'death', 'humans.As', 'events', 'unfold', 'entity', 'known', 'Yivo', 'David', 'Cross', 'who', 'dimension', 'other', 'side', 'rift', 'control', 'people', 'universe', 'Fry', 'Pope', 'like', 'position', 'people', 'start', 'discover', 'real', 'reason', 'Yivo', 'interested', 'way', 'are', 'numerous', 'subplots', 'truly', 'classic', 'lines', 'Zap', 'Brannigan', 'others', 'fate', 'two', 'universes', 'will', 'soon', 'depend', 'actions', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'characters', 'story.While', 'may', 'say', 'plot', 'new', 'Futurama', 'not', 'grab', 'way', 'episodes', 'did', 'have', 'plenty', 'humor', 'much', 'scenarios', 'main', 'story', 'arch', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'looks', 'book', 'classic', 'moments', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'surprises', 'let', 'say', 'phrase', 'Snu', 'Snu', 'back', 'Bender', 'past.Since', 'second', 'four', 'planned', 'DVDs', 'clear', 'new', 'offering', 'laying', 'ground', 'work', 'next', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'tidy', 'bow', 'when', 'finished', 'Instead', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'great', 'moments', 'nostalgia', 'fans', 'series', 'loads', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentaries', 'look', 'next', 'film', 'Bender', 'Game', '.All', 'welcome', 'satisfying', 'film', 'should', 'delight', 'fans', 'help', 'keep', 'happy', 'new', 'film', 'arrives', 'time', 'Holidays.4', '5']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

It also features some of the most inconsistent characterization ever seen in ""Futurama"".In particular, I was really disappointed by the mishandling of Fry and Leela's relationship -- Cohen promised development when these films were announced, not regression. Why would they give Fry a new girlfriend right after breaking new emotional ground in the Fry/Leela relationship during ""Bender's Big Score""? What's the point of showing us that these two can work as a couple if you're just going to stick Fry in a meaningless relationship with a polygamist and then have Leela berate him for 88 minutes?Almost as annoying is the gross mishandling of Kif and Amy's relationship. It's true that Amy is a little fickle, but I never would have pegged her as being so crass as to sleep with Zapp mere moments after Kif's death. It presents the charter as intensely shallow (even more so than she actually is), and mars what was a sweet relationship throughout the second half of the series. I suppose one could argue that she was grieving and in pain, and Zapp offered comfort, but this is Zapp Brannigan we're talking about. If she'd slept with Fry it might have felt less forced.The plot itself is pretty good, but it begins to stagnate around 3/4 of the way in. The subplot with Bender feels as though it continues to reiterate itself until such time that it becomes useful to the main plot (in the final act), and the whole thing really lacks the epic feel of the previous film. The story really didn't lend itself to big space battles or amazing revelations, although I will admit that the subjugation of Earth by a creature that just wants love is a really interesting (and somewhat disturbing) concept. The problem is that it just felt like an expanded episode rather than an epic movie, which is what it advertises itself to be. I think it could have easily been truncated into a 30 minute episode.Having said all that, I do think the film was really enjoyable and I'm eagerly anticipating the next installment. But while this film succeeded in being funnier than ""Bender's Big Score"", it doesn't hold a candle on the character development or emotional fronts.If I could give it 3 and 1/2 stars, I would.

Well they have the rip in the universe that was caused in BBS but that is where the connections end.The Nibblonians are completely gone.  Why Nibbler didn't erase anybody memory last time. The futurama crew knows of them now and of how technologically advanced they are compared to the rest of the universe. (I'm guessing they would realize this on how much nibbler knew on the mechanics of time travel from the last movie) plus based on the plot of this movie there complete absence is even more disturbing.No musical numbers! Oh come on guys what where you thinking? If there were any I must have fallen asleep and missed it.

The jokes were just as good as any original Futurama episode, and the main plot was just as good as the first movie's plot. I really don't get why everyone seem to hate it completely, to me it was just as good as I hoped it to be.As of the special features, there is some very interesting items. Here's the list:- The main feature commentary - Haven't got the time to listen to it, but apparently, it's pretty good.- The Lost Adventure - A 30 minutes long episode made specifically for the video game, featuring the real Futurama cast. Very good and very funny. I haven't had time to listen to the Lost Episode commentary either, I can't say how it is.- Storyboard Animatic - Not the best bonus, but still somehow interesting. You'll see for yourself.- Deleted Scenes - Some of them are very great scenes, so much that I really don't get why they're not in the movie's final cut.- David Cross eating popcorn - Voice actor David Cross (who plays the role of Yivo, the Beast With A Billion Backs ""shklimself"") talks about his character while eating popcorn.- Blooperama - Quite funny video of the cast at ""work"".- 3-D Models - How some of the elements of the movie (for example, the anomaly) are made commented by the animator. Again, not the best one, but still interesting)- A Brief History of Deathball - A tiny feature about certain elements of Deathball, how they were made. If you have two minutes to waste, why not?- Bender's Game sneak peek - A great teaser to what seems to be an awesome third movie.The DVD cover is great, well made (only, it's easily destroyed.

Less dependent on gags and nostalgic reunion-album kitchen-sinkism than Bender's Big Score, Beast avoids the flaws that bedeviled its otherwise great predecessor and presents a more even, if a little less exciting, experience. What it does deliver is genuine laughs, obscure sci-fi references, and a deep meditation on love--both sacred and profane.Sacred, you may ask? The religious allusions are heavy, but thoughtful, in the vein of Godfellas. Beast presents a god-like being (Yivo--YiHVoH?) who proclaims universal love and offers universal joy in exchange for commitment. Is that so wrong? Yivo may have ulterior motives, but if someone says shle loves you and makes you truly happy, what does shlis motives matter?The answers, of course, are highly subjective, and may even appear hypocritical, driven as they are by personal desire rather than universal standards.

I was surprised to see that this installment of Futurama is actually two awkward subplots mashed together: Lovecraftian horror for the first half, and a meditation on religion on the second half.On the Lovecraftian side, throw in tentacle attacks, slimy ancient gods from beyond time and space, and the nihilistic view that Heaven is a fabrication and you've got a pretty depressing, semi-creepy, not really all that funny first half.  Bender finally makes good on his threat to destroy all humans, Fry conveniently forgets his entire relationship with Leela, the Robot Devil shows up for a one-note gag ... I could go on but I'll stop there.Judging by the reviews so far, the second half went over a lot of peoples' heads.  Yivo is a parody of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is itself a parody of religion.  Basically, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a mental construct posed to challenge the notion of a divine being; if you can disprove that the Spaghetti Monster was responsible you win the argument. ""Win"" being a pretty subjective word, as anyone knows who has argued about religion or politics.As one big joke about relationships and religion, Beast With a Billion Backs works pretty well.  But for reasons known only to the writers, the plot shambles forward well beyond the Big Revelation by Leela about Yivo, the aforementioned Spaghetti Monster. It's like the drunk guy at a party who tells a joke, discovers no one thinks it's funny, then tells it in a slightly different way that STILL doesn't make it funny.  We get it: relationships with people can be just as ridiculous as relationships with God.  But this is Futurama, and while I appreciate the depth of meaning the show strives for with this movie, it feels forced.  A multitude of guest appearances doesn't make up for it.Still, I can't be too harsh on Futurama.  You won't find many animated shows that are willing to take on topics like relationships and religion at the same time, so Futurama gets points for trying.

It wasn't great, but it was certainly better than this movie.'The Beast with a Billion Backs' - the title itself a take-off of the reference in Shakespeare's Othello by Iago when he tells the king, ""Your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs,"" - promised a tongue-in-cheek satirical story.

I was disappointed by this seemingly quickly written and poorly thought out plot and storyline; I was disappointed by the less-than-stellar portrayal of the show's characters; and I was eager for it to end.While some of the humor from the TV series still remains present in this movie, it is hollow and empty, lacking in the quality and spark the series possesses still.Add it to your collection if you are buying the prescribed movie series, but don't expect it to be your favorite.",3,"For Collectors, Just Another Addition - For Fans, Disappointment",1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,1399,"['have', 'agree', 'whole-heartedly', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'disappointing', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Futurama', 'was', 'being', 'revived', 'was', 'thrilled', 'down', 'favorite', 'animated', 'series', 'Family', 'Guy', 'sometimes', 'shares', 'spot', ""'Bender"", 'Big', 'Score', 'was', 'funny', 'poignant', 'contained', 'same', 'laugh-out-loud', ""cheer-for-Fry's-love-of-Leila"", 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'certainly', 'better', 'movie', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'title', 'take-off', 'reference', 'Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'Iago', 'when', 'king', 'daughter', 'Moor', 'are', 'now', 'making', 'beast', 'two', 'backs', 'promised', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'satirical', 'story', 'anticipated', 'same', 'depth', 'level', 'humor', 'Futurama', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'animated', 'series', 'such', 'Family', 'Guy', 'fraught', 'silliness', 'substance', 'was', 'disappointed', 'seemingly', 'quickly', 'written', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'plot', 'storyline', 'was', 'disappointed', 'less-than-stellar', 'portrayal', 'show', 'characters', 'was', 'eager', 'end.While', 'humor', 'TV', 'series', 'still', 'present', 'movie', 'hollow', 'empty', 'lacking', 'quality', 'spark', 'series', 'still.Add', 'collection', 'are', 'buying', 'prescribed', 'movie', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'favorite']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

It covers the entire gamut, from monogamous relationships to polyamorous ones, individual love to universal love, platonic love to erotic love, new love to loss.  And it humorously juxtaposes the cultural trappings of one kind to another to explore the ramifications of each.It is pretty common to see TV shows that might tackle one of these, and either give a ""hey, isn't this great"" message (like most sit-coms) or a ""it looks good at first, but it isn't so great after all"" angle (like a Twilight Zone ""what looks like heaven is actually hell"").  Maybe that's all you can do in half an hour.  But this movie doesn't give an answer.  We see humanity (at least the Planet Express segment) individually achieve love, and have a couple of chances for universal love by different means, and by the end things end up shattered.  We end up puzzling the issue of what is best ourselves, with some new brilliant insights we had not thought of before.And I find it surprising that people claim the movie is terrible because it isn't funny.  It seems like they have not seen the show recently, and misremember how it actually was.  Go back to the original series, especially the third and fourth seasons, and see how many jokes there really were.  Humor is not the show's reason for being, it is the wrapper for philosophical and character explorations, just as in most sci-fi.  But don't think this movie isn't funny as well, because it is.

When they announced it would return, everyone cheered. When they announced that first would come several made-for-DVD movies...well, let's just say us fans were apprehensive.The success of Bender's Big Score changed that. Seeing that a Futurama movie could not only live up to the quality of the show-but even possibly surpass it-was, as the Professor would say, wonderful news. Beast with a Billion Backs instantly rose to the top of my most anticipated lists for this summer, and I have to say it delivered.Unlike Big Score, Billion Backs is more new material and less reliance on nostalgia. Where Big Score got their laughs from bringing back characters and tying together refrences in zany ways, Billion Backs has little to do with the show itself. The story takes place directly after Big Score, after the rift in the universe tears space asunder. The earth is panicking, and scientists are gathered to find a solution. After much debate (and Death Ball), the Planet Express crew is sent to man an expedition to the rift when they discover that nothing mechanical can pass through.Hurt, Bender returns home and sulks while humanity and the other organic lifeforms plan ways to destroy whatever universe lies on the other side. During his sulking, Bender meets up with the League of Robots, an all-robot group originally designed to destroy humanity, but which has since lots its purpose.Meanwhile, Fry stows away on a military spaceship (bet you can guess who the captain in charge of the mission is!) and flings himself into the other universe, trying to escape from it all. What Fry ends up finding (and bringing back with him) will forever change the course of our galaxy's history.CONTENT: 4/5The story in Beast with a Billion Backs isn't the greatest we've ever seen from the series, but it definitely belongs with the other strong episodes and Big Score. The interaction between the various characters goes to a level deeper than the show did, and we see new aspects of people we thought we already fully understood.David Cross provides the voice for the titular beast, and does an amazing job making it one of the more memorable cameos in the history of Futurama. If you're a fan of the series, this is definitely a must-watch story arc which is sure to bring a smile to your face with the witty writing we're so used too.VIDEO: 3.5/5The movie's animation is about par with the series, but nothing about it really blows you away any more than the episodes on DVD or Big Score. Colors and the design of some of the elements is nice, but I feel like BwaBB takes less chances with the art direction than past Futurama works, and relies heavily instead on the earth and other familiar locales. The only truly new and original locale (which you'll see near the end of the movie) isn't exactly original in its design.For you videophiles, though, the transfer is nice and smooth with no noticeable fading, is in native widescreen, and although there are a few grainy moments overall the blacks stay dark and consistent.AUDIO: 4/5The audio might not be as technically impressive as other movies, but the voice acting remains superb, and shows why Futurama was one of the most popular (and most respected) cartoons of all time. David Cross's work in this is tremendous, and only makes me want to have him become a regular contributor to the show once it's back on the air. Toss in 11 cast commentary tracks, and you're all set.REPLAY: 5/5Like the show, the replay value for Beast with a Billion Backs is off the charts for those who enjoy the show. Jokes remain funny and stand up well to repeated viewings.EXTRAS: 4.5/5You have to hand it to the Futurama crew, because they certainly know how to stock their products. Other than the aforementioned 11+ commentary tracks, Beast with a Billion Backs features deleted scenes, a short piece on David Cross's participation, a history of Deathball, a look at the next Futurama movie (the fantasy-based Bender's Game), and best of all, the entire 30 minute episode one could have watched by playing through the Futurama videogame. I never enjoyed the game enough to play through to view the story, but now you can watch it in its sorta-3D goodness uninterrupted.OVERALL: 4/5Beast with a Billion Backs isn't the best thing Futurama has ever produced, but it's certainly not in the bottom half. It's a very solid production for fans used to the show, and is a must-own for any fans.",4,"Good news, Futurama lovers!",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,4527,"['Ah', 'Futurama', 'How', 'missed', 'When', 'Futurama', 'was', 'cancelled', 'everyone', 'died', 'little', 'inside', 'When', 'announced', 'would', 'return', 'everyone', 'cheered', 'When', 'announced', 'first', 'would', 'come', 'several', 'made-for-DVD', 'movies', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'fans', 'were', 'apprehensive.The', 'success', 'Bender', 'Big', 'Score', 'changed', 'Seeing', 'Futurama', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'up', 'quality', 'show-but', 'even', 'possibly', 'surpass', 'it-was', 'Professor', 'would', 'say', 'wonderful', 'news', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'instantly', 'rose', 'top', 'most', 'anticipated', 'lists', 'summer', 'have', 'say', 'delivered.Unlike', 'Big', 'Score', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'more', 'new', 'material', 'less', 'reliance', 'nostalgia', 'Where', 'Big', 'Score', 'got', 'laughs', 'bringing', 'back', 'characters', 'tying', 'together', 'refrences', 'zany', 'ways', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'little', 'do', 'show', 'story', 'place', 'directly', 'Big', 'Score', 'rift', 'universe', 'tears', 'space', 'asunder', 'earth', 'panicking', 'scientists', 'are', 'gathered', 'find', 'solution', 'much', 'debate', 'Death', 'Ball', 'Planet', 'Express', 'crew', 'sent', 'man', 'expedition', 'rift', 'when', 'discover', 'nothing', 'mechanical', 'can', 'pass', 'through.Hurt', 'Bender', 'home', 'sulks', 'humanity', 'other', 'organic', 'lifeforms', 'plan', 'ways', 'destroy', 'universe', 'other', 'side', 'sulking', 'Bender', 'up', 'League', 'Robots', 'all-robot', 'group', 'originally', 'designed', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'lots', 'purpose.Meanwhile', 'Fry', 'away', 'military', 'spaceship', 'can', 'guess', 'who', 'captain', 'charge', 'mission', 'other', 'universe', 'trying', 'escape', 'What', 'Fry', 'up', 'finding', 'bringing', 'back', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'course', 'galaxy', 'history.CONTENT', '4/5The', 'story', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', ""n't"", 'greatest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'definitely', 'other', 'strong', 'episodes', 'Big', 'Score', 'interaction', 'various', 'characters', 'level', 'deeper', 'show', 'did', 'see', 'new', 'aspects', 'people', 'thought', 'already', 'fully', 'understood.David', 'Cross', 'voice', 'titular', 'beast', 'amazing', 'job', 'making', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'cameos', 'history', 'Futurama', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'definitely', 'must-watch', 'story', 'arc', 'sure', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'witty', 'writing', ""'re"", 'so', 'used', 'too.VIDEO', '3.5/5The', 'movie', 'animation', 'par', 'series', 'nothing', 'really', 'away', 'more', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'Big', 'Score', 'Colors', 'design', 'elements', 'nice', 'feel', 'BwaBB', 'less', 'chances', 'art', 'direction', 'past', 'Futurama', 'works', 'relies', 'heavily', 'instead', 'earth', 'other', 'familiar', 'locales', 'only', 'truly', 'new', 'original', 'locale', ""'ll"", 'see', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'original', 'design.For', 'videophiles', 'though', 'transfer', 'nice', 'smooth', 'noticeable', 'fading', 'native', 'widescreen', 'are', 'few', 'grainy', 'moments', 'overall', 'blacks', 'stay', 'dark', 'consistent.AUDIO', '4/5The', 'audio', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'technically', 'impressive', 'other', 'movies', 'voice', 'acting', 'remains', 'superb', 'why', 'Futurama', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'most', 'respected', 'cartoons', 'time', 'David', 'Cross', 'work', 'tremendous', 'only', 'want', 'have', 'become', 'regular', 'contributor', 'show', 'back', 'air', 'Toss', '11', 'cast', 'commentary', 'tracks', ""'re"", 'set.REPLAY', '5/5Like', 'show', 'replay', 'value', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'charts', 'who', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Jokes', 'remain', 'funny', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings.EXTRAS', '4.5/5You', 'have', 'hand', 'Futurama', 'crew', 'certainly', 'know', 'how', 'stock', 'products', 'Other', 'aforementioned', '11+', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'short', 'piece', 'David', 'Cross', 'participation', 'history', 'Deathball', 'look', 'next', 'Futurama', 'movie', 'fantasy-based', 'Bender', 'Game', 'best', 'entire', '30', 'minute', 'episode', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'playing', 'Futurama', 'videogame', 'never', 'enjoyed', 'game', 'enough', 'play', 'view', 'story', 'now', 'can', 'watch', 'sorta-3D', 'goodness', 'uninterrupted.OVERALL', '4/5Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', ""n't"", 'best', 'thing', 'Futurama', 'ever', 'produced', 'certainly', 'not', 'bottom', 'half', 'very', 'solid', 'production', 'fans', 'used', 'show', 'must-own', 'fans']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs
1148986,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00158K0V0,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 3]","The inimitable cast of Futurama returns in the second feature-length animated film, The Beast with a Billion Backs. Once again the outstanding dry humor surfaces, with throwbacks, spoofs and parodies of famous science fiction elements, as well as pop-culture; but this second film begins to show the strain of 3-4 episodes being melded together. Without the usual breaks the TV show afforded, some of the segments run a bit ill-paced toward the conclusion, and no doubt the film would be more enjoyable as the separate episodes that run individually on TV. It's still the genius of Futurama, but it's several of the less impressive adventures.An electromagnetic alternate universe reveals itself to the frightened people of earth as a space rip anomaly in the sky. Professor Hubert Farnsworth racks his brain for a solution to the possibly hazardous situation, but is contested by his longtime rival Doctor Ogden Wernstrom, who is constantly intent on one-upping him. When Philip Fry (Billy West), a bumbling Planet Express employee is sent into space to implement Ogden's plans, a planet-sized tentacled monster named Yivo (David Cross) emerges, intent on taking over the world.Leela (Katey Sagal), Farnsworth, Amy, Zoidberg, Hermes, Zapp Brannigan and more must unite to battle the enormous beast, which has sent down his many tentacles to turn the people of Earth into mindless zombie puppets. Fry becomes the tentacle pope of the world and is fixed on forcing everyone to join him as a victim to the enslaving mind-controlling appendages.Meanwhile, the unsympathetic and crass robot Bender becomes infatuated with television star Calculon, and decides to stalk him. Unearthing the League of Robots, a secretive group of powerful droids teamed to protect the less fortunate robots of the world, Bender eventually joins them only to become jealous of Calculon's leadership. As he plots to unite massive droid armies to usurp planet Earth, the human inhabitants decide to join Yivo in his dimension, after it is determined that all he wants is a meaningful relationship.Brittany Murphy joins the voice cast as Fry's girlfriend Colleen, a spunky young woman who believes she can satisfy her five boyfriends, much to the dismay of the conventional Fry. A hilarious Deathball tournament is used to settle arguments, the constant scatterbrained machinations of chauvinistic starship captain Zapp Brannigan return, Kif Kroker and Amy Wong take their relationship to the next level, Pazuzu makes an appearance, Nixon's head leads the citizens of Earth, and a Pirates of the Caribbean finale convinces everyone that love is downright awful - and that there is no great love without jealousy. But for all of the nonstop jokes, cameos, and general buffoonery, The Beast With a Billion Backs seems poorly timed during most of its duration.It's ironic that most criticisms of TV-to-movie adaptations are that the feature merely feels like several episodes stitched together. For the second Futurama film, it literally is several episodes stitched together, and is probably much more entertaining being viewed in its pieces. The Beast With a Billion Backs won't disappoint longtime fans of the show, but it also doesn't add as much excitement for Futurama's reinstatement as the first feature did.- Mike Massie",3,Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs Movie Review,1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,3299,"['inimitable', 'cast', 'Futurama', 'returns', 'second', 'feature-length', 'animated', 'film', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'Once', 'again', 'outstanding', 'dry', 'humor', 'surfaces', 'throwbacks', 'spoofs', 'parodies', 'famous', 'science', 'fiction', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'pop-culture', 'second', 'film', 'show', 'strain', '3-4', 'episodes', 'being', 'melded', 'together', 'usual', 'TV', 'show', 'afforded', 'segments', 'run', 'bit', 'ill-paced', 'conclusion', 'doubt', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'separate', 'episodes', 'run', 'individually', 'TV', 'still', 'genius', 'Futurama', 'several', 'less', 'impressive', 'adventures.An', 'electromagnetic', 'alternate', 'universe', 'reveals', 'frightened', 'people', 'earth', 'space', 'rip', 'anomaly', 'sky', 'Professor', 'Hubert', 'Farnsworth', 'brain', 'solution', 'possibly', 'hazardous', 'situation', 'contested', 'longtime', 'rival', 'Doctor', 'Ogden', 'Wernstrom', 'who', 'constantly', 'intent', 'one-upping', 'When', 'Philip', 'Fry', 'Billy', 'West', 'bumbling', 'Planet', 'Express', 'employee', 'sent', 'space', 'implement', 'Ogden', 'plans', 'planet-sized', 'tentacled', 'monster', 'named', 'Yivo', 'David', 'Cross', 'intent', 'taking', 'over', 'world.Leela', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'Farnsworth', 'Amy', 'Zoidberg', 'Hermes', 'Zapp', 'Brannigan', 'more', 'must', 'unite', 'battle', 'enormous', 'beast', 'sent', 'down', 'many', 'tentacles', 'turn', 'people', 'Earth', 'mindless', 'zombie', 'puppets', 'Fry', 'tentacle', 'pope', 'world', 'fixed', 'forcing', 'everyone', 'join', 'victim', 'enslaving', 'mind-controlling', 'appendages.Meanwhile', 'unsympathetic', 'crass', 'robot', 'Bender', 'infatuated', 'television', 'star', 'Calculon', 'stalk', 'Unearthing', 'League', 'Robots', 'secretive', 'group', 'powerful', 'droids', 'teamed', 'protect', 'less', 'fortunate', 'robots', 'world', 'Bender', 'eventually', 'only', 'become', 'jealous', 'Calculon', 'leadership', 'unite', 'massive', 'droid', 'armies', 'usurp', 'planet', 'Earth', 'human', 'inhabitants', 'decide', 'join', 'Yivo', 'dimension', 'determined', 'meaningful', 'relationship.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'voice', 'cast', 'Fry', 'girlfriend', 'Colleen', 'spunky', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'satisfy', 'five', 'boyfriends', 'much', 'dismay', 'conventional', 'Fry', 'A', 'hilarious', 'Deathball', 'tournament', 'used', 'settle', 'arguments', 'constant', 'scatterbrained', 'machinations', 'chauvinistic', 'starship', 'captain', 'Zapp', 'Brannigan', 'return', 'Kif', 'Kroker', 'Amy', 'Wong', 'take', 'relationship', 'next', 'level', 'Pazuzu', 'appearance', 'Nixon', 'head', 'citizens', 'Earth', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'finale', 'convinces', 'everyone', 'love', 'downright', 'awful', 'great', 'love', 'jealousy', 'nonstop', 'jokes', 'cameos', 'general', 'buffoonery', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'poorly', 'timed', 'most', 'duration.It', 'ironic', 'most', 'criticisms', 'TV-to-movie', 'adaptations', 'are', 'feature', 'merely', 'several', 'episodes', 'stitched', 'together', 'second', 'Futurama', 'film', 'literally', 'several', 'episodes', 'stitched', 'together', 'probably', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'being', 'viewed', 'pieces', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'longtime', 'fans', 'show', 'also', ""n't"", 'add', 'as', 'much', 'excitement', 'Futurama', 'reinstatement', 'first', 'feature', 'did.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs

I did not find it nearly as witty, but the storyline was good and fun, and David Cross at Yivo shows that he is still hilarious.The special features are good as well.  Unlike Bender's Big Score, there are not quite as many special features, but what they have is good stuff for the watching.I recommend this film to any Futurama fan.  If you are a true fan, you will probably buy this no matter what I said anyway, I know that I was getting this DVD no matter what!  =)High Points:Yivo, Deathball...Low points:Bender did not have as many wisecracks as normally.

1148988,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B00158K0V0,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[18, 33]","Beast with a Billion Backs, from what I imagine watching the preview, caused me to think this movie would be dull, or one dimentional.  NO WAY IS THIS A DULL FILM. In fact, this movie is really cool. Much of the film revolves around strange, freaked outed twists on  ""permittable"" love.  LOVE and LOSS is a big part the movie, right up to the film's funeral ending.  In the last film, it ends with a funeral too. Plus, love themes once more predominate. Lars and Leela's relationship hurt Fry more than it appeared, cos now, Fry is out for vengence. Jealousy is what's behind most of this film's plot. In a way, it pleads for the nessecity of a committed relationship, in order to be happy. The Beast from the other Universe is attempting to seduce and controll the universe, thru a parody of 1950's trite mating behavior. That was a fun part of the film. During the film, Leela becomes more and more isolated from everyone.  Even when the whole universe falls in love with a space octopus monster, Leela resists, because she is very skeptical about love, bottom line. Plus she wants the perfect man, and he's not out there. Anyway, when's the last time a film made you wonder, ""Should a Gigantic space monster fall in love, and mate, the species of another Universe?"" Let me know if you have seen one, cos I'd like to see it too.  It's surreal, and overintellectualized often, but the film has some classic themes behind the humor. That's what makes FUTURAMA fun to watch for adults. (This is not a children's show at all.) This Futurama film has great Scifi spoofs, a humorous view of the folly of love, and FUN ON A BUN!!  Beast of a Billion Backs has a TON of fantastic one-liners, hilarious sight gags, and all the twists and movements of LOVE'S GRAND FOLLY. (Not unlike a Shakespeare comedy...which is where ""THE BEAST WITH TWO BACKS"" comes from, BTW.) Even tho the film's funny, a farce, it often seems real.  People grieve, get depressed, elated by love, jealous, and everything else. Strangely once more, the film is filled with loss. At one point or another, everybody or another becomes broken hearted. Everyone is this film is jealous, and deeply so. But it seems these characters just love to make bad choices, when it comes to love, they do it consistantly.  The innocence of the love choices, made by fools, and not cruel people, is why this is a comedy film. That it's animated, is incidental.  So, I would buy this, for the movie alone. HOWEVER............This movie has some INCREDIBLE movie extras. First off, is the 30 minute extra cartoon episode, that was made for the video game. The game's animation look was a little odd. The characters were a cross between 3-D, and line drawings. Even with that, the extra show's jokes, wierd plot, and wild fantasy of invention, (like an earth sized space ship), made that the best extra since HYPNOTOAD. The parts of the extra cartoon where the Futurama characters are ""playing the video game"", is minimal. It's such a cool extra for a movie...a short film!! Along with that, comes a big chunk of ""Animatics"", for the first part of the film. It's like watching hand drawn comic book windows, without the dialouge balloons. Also, very cool. And as always, the commentary is at least as good as the film dialouge. After so many DVD commentaries, for the original series, and now these films, this crew has their off the cuff banter/ comedy routines polished bright. PLUS, the DVD threw in a GREAT teaser.....a coming attraction of the next Futurama film! THANK YOU.Unlike the ""cliffhanger"" on the first film, ie the end of all creation, this movie does not end on an unresolved note. If anything, it seems as tho the film wants to drive home the belief "" JEALOUSY PROVES TRUE LOVE."" It also shows that using jealousy to test love, only ends in broken hearts. My guess is that revelation to the Futurama characters, is going to be important in the next 2 films. I think that BWABB is A GREAT MOVEMENT FORWARD for the series' story arc. Hopefully, the experiences that both Fry and Leela have gone thru, might have showed them both, to accept each other, faults and all. I can only imagine, that by the last film, wedding bells might be ringing.",5,Futurama preaching UNIVERSAL LOVE...literally,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,4203,"['Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'what', 'imagine', 'watching', 'preview', 'caused', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'dull', 'one', 'dimentional', 'WAY', 'THIS', 'A', 'DULL', 'FILM', 'fact', 'movie', 'really', 'cool', 'Much', 'film', 'strange', 'freaked', 'outed', 'twists', 'permittable', 'love', 'LOVE', 'LOSS', 'big', 'part', 'movie', 'right', 'up', 'film', 'funeral', 'ending', 'last', 'film', 'funeral', 'too', 'love', 'themes', 'once', 'more', 'predominate', 'Lars', 'Leela', 'relationship', 'hurt', 'Fry', 'more', 'appeared', 'cos', 'now', 'Fry', 'out', 'vengence', 'Jealousy', 'what', 'behind', 'most', 'film', 'plot', 'way', 'nessecity', 'committed', 'relationship', 'order', 'be', 'happy', 'Beast', 'other', 'Universe', 'attempting', 'seduce', 'controll', 'universe', 'thru', 'parody', '1950', 'trite', 'mating', 'behavior', 'was', 'fun', 'part', 'film', 'film', 'Leela', 'more', 'more', 'isolated', 'everyone', 'Even', 'when', 'whole', 'universe', 'love', 'space', 'octopus', 'monster', 'Leela', 'very', 'skeptical', 'love', 'bottom', 'line', 'perfect', 'man', 'not', 'there', 'Anyway', 'when', 'last', 'time', 'film', 'made', 'wonder', 'Should', 'Gigantic', 'space', 'monster', 'fall', 'love', 'mate', 'species', 'Universe', 'Let', 'know', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'cos', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'too', 'surreal', 'overintellectualized', 'often', 'film', 'classic', 'themes', 'humor', 'what', 'FUTURAMA', 'fun', 'watch', 'adults', 'not', 'children', 'show', 'Futurama', 'film', 'great', 'Scifi', 'spoofs', 'humorous', 'view', 'folly', 'love', 'FUN', 'ON', 'A', 'BUN', 'Beast', 'Billion', 'Backs', 'TON', 'fantastic', 'one-liners', 'hilarious', 'sight', 'gags', 'twists', 'movements', 'LOVE', 'GRAND', 'FOLLY', 'Not', 'Shakespeare', 'comedy', 'where', 'BEAST', 'WITH', 'TWO', 'BACKS', 'BTW', 'Even', 'tho', 'film', 'funny', 'farce', 'often', 'real', 'People', 'grieve', 'get', 'depressed', 'elated', 'love', 'jealous', 'everything', 'else', 'Strangely', 'once', 'more', 'film', 'filled', 'loss', 'one', 'point', 'everybody', 'broken', 'hearted', 'Everyone', 'film', 'jealous', 'deeply', 'so', 'characters', 'just', 'love', 'make', 'bad', 'choices', 'when', 'love', 'do', 'consistantly', 'innocence', 'love', 'choices', 'made', 'fools', 'not', 'cruel', 'people', 'why', 'comedy', 'film', 'animated', 'incidental', 'So', 'would', 'buy', 'movie', 'alone', 'HOWEVER', 'movie', 'INCREDIBLE', 'movie', 'extras', 'First', '30', 'minute', 'extra', 'cartoon', 'episode', 'was', 'made', 'video', 'game', 'game', 'animation', 'look', 'was', 'little', 'odd', 'characters', 'were', 'cross', '3-D', 'line', 'drawings', 'Even', 'extra', 'show', 'jokes', 'wierd', 'plot', 'wild', 'fantasy', 'invention', 'earth', 'sized', 'space', 'ship', 'made', 'best', 'extra', 'HYPNOTOAD', 'parts', 'extra', 'cartoon', 'where', 'Futurama', 'characters', 'are', 'playing', 'video', 'game', 'minimal', 'such', 'cool', 'extra', 'movie', 'short', 'film', 'big', 'chunk', 'Animatics', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'watching', 'hand', 'drawn', 'comic', 'book', 'windows', 'dialouge', 'balloons', 'Also', 'very', 'cool', 'always', 'commentary', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'dialouge', 'so', 'many', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'original', 'series', 'now', 'films', 'crew', 'off', 'cuff', 'banter/', 'comedy', 'routines', 'polished', 'bright', 'DVD', 'threw', 'GREAT', 'teaser', '..a', 'coming', 'attraction', 'next', 'Futurama', 'film', 'THANK', 'cliffhanger', 'first', 'film', 'ie', 'end', 'creation', 'movie', 'not', 'end', 'unresolved', 'note', 'anything', 'tho', 'film', 'drive', 'home', 'belief', 'JEALOUSY', 'PROVES', 'TRUE', 'LOVE', 'also', 'using', 'jealousy', 'test', 'love', 'only', 'broken', 'hearts', 'guess', 'revelation', 'Futurama', 'characters', 'going', 'be', 'important', 'next', '2', 'films', 'think', 'BWABB', 'A', 'GREAT', 'MOVEMENT', 'FORWARD', 'series', 'story', 'arc', 'Hopefully', 'experiences', 'Fry', 'Leela', 'have', 'gone', 'thru', 'might', 'have', 'showed', 'accept', 'other', 'faults', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'last', 'film', 'wedding', 'bells', 'might', 'be', 'ringing']",Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs
