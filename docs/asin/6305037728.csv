444967,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305037728,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`The Newton Boys' is not your typical western.  Running more in the lines of `American Outlaws' then say `Unforgiven', `The Newton Boys' is in all respects a `fun film'.  It doesn't take itself too seriously.  It jokes around and rests heavy on comedic timing and a loud atmosphere.  The cast is young and fresh as apposed to mature and polished.  They are the `it' boys of the given year, cast to draw in a slew of teen viewers and boost ticket sales.  This is not an adult drama but more like a teen dramedy.  None of this is a bad thing; it's just a different thing.  I expected something more when I initially saw this when it was released, but after watching this again the other night I can see it for what it is and thus enjoy it even though it is not as good as it could have been, had it gone the more artistic route.The film chronicles the infamous Newton boys, four brothers who became the most successful bank robbers in history.  They were not your typical heathens either.  They never killed anybody; they lived near respectable lives and never turned a fellow in.  They were likable people.  I'm sure they had flaws but this film is not about embellishing them for our enjoyment, this film is about making them as charming and approachable as possible, and they do that.  The very idea of casting Matthew `charming' McConaughey as the lead is a dead give away for the films intent.  So Willis, Joe, Jess and Dock rob nearly eighty banks and would have gotten away with it entirely if they hadn't decided to take one `last' job, a mail train, a robbery that got so botched they almost lost their lives but in the end just lost their fortune.The acting is not too shabby considering the cast.  In fact Vincent D'Onofrio, who is arguably the best overall actor in the bunch despite his lack of `star power', has very little screen time in comparison to his co-stars yet the film still moves along fine.  Casting McConaughey as a Texas cowboy was smart since that's kind of what he is.  He is always charming even if he has less talent than most and here he uses his charm to help us forget he's riding fame on his looks.  Skeet Ulrich is decent as the apprehensive Joe, a far cry from his more famous role as Neve Campbell's killer boyfriend in `Scream'.  Julianna Margulies does her best to survive the at times horrific dialog and Dwight Yoakam does all he can to remain memorable in a film that doesn't care much for him.  The true highlight of this film though is Ethan Hawke who just nails his performance as Jess.  He's hilarious and enthralling.  In fact you can't keep your eyes off of him.  By far he gives the best performance of the bunch.In the end `The Newton Boys' is not a masterpiece but it is not a waste of time either.  It's not the type of film you may be expecting considering the `darkness' of more current westerns but it has a `fun' factor and is at times purely delightful.  It's as charming as its stars and as entertaining as can be expected.  At times the dialog is rough, but it's nothing to mull over.  Just sit back and relax and enjoy have a rootin'-tootin' good time.",3,A light and almost comical twist on the western...,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,3112,"['Newton', 'Boys', 'not', 'typical', 'western', 'Running', 'more', 'lines', 'American', 'Outlaws', 'then', 'say', 'Unforgiven', 'Newton', 'Boys', 'respects', 'fun', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'around', 'heavy', 'comedic', 'timing', 'loud', 'atmosphere', 'cast', 'young', 'fresh', 'apposed', 'mature', 'polished', 'are', 'boys', 'given', 'year', 'cast', 'draw', 'slew', 'teen', 'viewers', 'boost', 'ticket', 'sales', 'not', 'adult', 'drama', 'more', 'teen', 'dramedy', 'None', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'different', 'thing', 'expected', 'something', 'more', 'when', 'initially', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'watching', 'again', 'other', 'night', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'thus', 'enjoy', 'even', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'gone', 'more', 'artistic', 'route.The', 'film', 'infamous', 'Newton', 'boys', 'four', 'brothers', 'who', 'became', 'most', 'successful', 'bank', 'robbers', 'history', 'were', 'not', 'typical', 'heathens', 'never', 'killed', 'anybody', 'lived', 'respectable', 'lives', 'never', 'turned', 'fellow', 'were', 'likable', 'people', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'flaws', 'film', 'not', 'embellishing', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'making', 'charming', 'approachable', 'possible', 'do', 'very', 'idea', 'casting', 'Matthew', 'charming', 'McConaughey', 'lead', 'dead', 'give', 'away', 'films', 'intent', 'So', 'Willis', 'Joe', 'Jess', 'Dock', 'rob', 'nearly', 'eighty', 'banks', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'entirely', 'had', ""n't"", 'decided', 'take', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'mail', 'train', 'robbery', 'got', 'so', 'botched', 'almost', 'lost', 'lives', 'end', 'just', 'lost', 'fortune.The', 'acting', 'not', 'too', 'shabby', 'considering', 'cast', 'fact', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'who', 'arguably', 'best', 'overall', 'actor', 'bunch', 'lack', 'star', 'power', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'comparison', 'co-stars', 'yet', 'film', 'still', 'along', 'fine', 'Casting', 'McConaughey', 'Texas', 'cowboy', 'was', 'smart', 'kind', 'what', 'always', 'charming', 'even', 'less', 'talent', 'most', 'here', 'charm', 'help', 'forget', 'riding', 'fame', 'looks', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'decent', 'apprehensive', 'Joe', 'far', 'cry', 'more', 'famous', 'role', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'killer', 'boyfriend', 'Scream', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'best', 'survive', 'times', 'horrific', 'dialog', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'can', 'remain', 'memorable', 'film', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'true', 'highlight', 'film', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'just', 'performance', 'Jess', 'hilarious', 'enthralling', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'bunch.In', 'end', 'Newton', 'Boys', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'expecting', 'considering', 'darkness', 'more', 'current', 'westerns', 'fun', 'factor', 'times', 'purely', 'delightful', 'as', 'charming', 'stars', 'as', 'entertaining', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'times', 'dialog', 'rough', 'nothing', 'mull', 'over', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'have', ""rootin'-tootin"", 'good', 'time']",Newton Boys VHS

444969,A2ZIQ3QTYI4QTM,6305037728,"Elaine ""Horror Journalist""","[5, 5]","I didn't see this movie when it first hit the theatres but, being a fan of Matthew McConaughey, Dwight Yoakam and Skeet Ulrich, I rented it when it became available.  GREAT, fun movie! And based on the true story of four brothers from Uvalde, Texas (where McConaughey was born) who were not only the most successful bank robbers in US history but ALL lived to ripe old age, unlike those that followed them a few years later, like Bonnie & Clyde, Dillinger, etc.  McConaughey, Ulrich, Ethan Hawke (excellent!) and Vincent D'Onofrio play the Newton Boys.  Dwight Yoakam is wonderful as their ""cowardly"" sidekick who handles the nitroglycerin the gang uses on their jobs.  Julianna Margulies has THE most beautiful 1920s costumes in her role as McConaughey's love interest, Louise.  The film also has the best honky-tonk soundtrack, courtesy of an Austin band called Bad Livers (get ahold of a copy if you can - it is SO worth it!) and during the closing credits, we get to see the real Joe and Willis Newton in interviews.  Joe's is particularly funny as he is on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"".  And the robbery the gang pulls in Toronto has GOT to be the funniest debacle in outlaw movie history!  There is a book available at Amazon entitled ""The Newton Boys"" which this film is based on and it's basically the oral history of the gang's exploits as remembered by Willis and Joe.  Makes for fascinating reading and one other bit of trivia - when Dock Newton (D'Onofrio's character) was in his 70s, in 1968 I believe, he tried to rob the First National Bank of Rowena, Texas which just happened to be the birthplace of one infamous Miss Bonnie Parker.  Just another great bit of American history not taught in schools.  Heck, even Frank Hamer, ALSO of Bonnie & Clyde fame, makes a ""cameo"" in this movie.

The general plot is that four brothers become bank robbers and are successful in many of their endeavors, but when they try to pull off the greatest robbery in history, somehow a couple things don't go as planned and it lands them in hot water. Matthew McGonaughey is perfect in his role as Willis Newton, and the rest of the cast is good as the other three brothers-Jess, Joe, and Dock- and the various people who are in league with The Newtons (especially Juliana Marguiles as Louise).

444971,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6305037728,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","The film is very banal. Bank robbers and postal train robbers, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, blas&eacute;, pass&eacute;. Nothing particularly interesting or exciting. Yet the film has a slight flaw that makes it maybe of some interest. These bank robbers and postal train robbers survived the whole business in 1924, got through the trial with rather light sentences and they most of them died of old age fifty or so years later after giving, for some of them, some TV interviews about that profession of their young age. Then that was not a film but a fictionalized documentary. Shucks! Those who got the heaviest sentences were the few real profiteers who were the real organizers behind those young cowboys who got misled, by their own dream, into getting by force the money they desired to have. But the worst part in all that story is that they got caught on their last venture, the postal train robbery, because one of the gang of brothers shot another member of that brotherly gang because he did not stick to what he was supposed to do, went on the other side of the train and got frightened by someone who did not have the identifying hat they were all supposed to wear. A mistake, another mistake and the whole venture came to a stop, though they apparently did not recuperate all the money, neither the authorities, not the Newton Boys, because the part that was hidden away by one of them was done so under the influence of alcohol, not the money of course, but the Newton Boy who was supposed to bury it and he could never, so he says at least, remember where it was. If you are not afraid of the strong cowboy Texan accent of these boys, you can watch it and entertain yourself with the dream of what you could do with three million 1924 dollars. I guess you would favor buying a new hybrid car to be economical and nice with the planet.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,No gravitation for these Newtons but a lot of ethical levitation,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,1980,"['film', 'very', 'banal', 'Bank', 'robbers', 'postal', 'train', 'robbers', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'blas', 'eacute', 'pass', 'eacute', 'Nothing', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'film', 'slight', 'flaw', 'maybe', 'interest', 'bank', 'robbers', 'postal', 'train', 'robbers', 'survived', 'whole', 'business', '1924', 'got', 'trial', 'rather', 'light', 'sentences', 'most', 'died', 'old', 'age', 'fifty', 'so', 'years', 'later', 'giving', 'TV', 'interviews', 'profession', 'young', 'age', 'Then', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'fictionalized', 'documentary', 'Shucks', 'who', 'got', 'heaviest', 'sentences', 'were', 'few', 'real', 'profiteers', 'who', 'were', 'real', 'organizers', 'young', 'cowboys', 'who', 'got', 'misled', 'own', 'dream', 'getting', 'force', 'money', 'desired', 'have', 'worst', 'part', 'story', 'got', 'caught', 'last', 'venture', 'postal', 'train', 'robbery', 'one', 'gang', 'brothers', 'shot', 'member', 'brotherly', 'gang', 'did', 'not', 'stick', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'went', 'other', 'side', 'train', 'got', 'frightened', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'identifying', 'hat', 'were', 'supposed', 'wear', 'mistake', 'mistake', 'whole', 'venture', 'came', 'stop', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'recuperate', 'money', 'authorities', 'not', 'Newton', 'Boys', 'part', 'was', 'hidden', 'away', 'one', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'influence', 'alcohol', 'not', 'money', 'course', 'Newton', 'Boy', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'bury', 'could', 'never', 'least', 'remember', 'where', 'was', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'strong', 'cowboy', 'Texan', 'accent', 'boys', 'can', 'watch', 'entertain', 'dream', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'three', 'million', '1924', 'dollars', 'guess', 'would', 'favor', 'buying', 'new', 'hybrid', 'car', 'be', 'economical', 'nice', 'planet.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Newton Boys VHS
444972,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,6305037728,Jeremy Heilman,"[9, 9]","Richard Linklater's The Newton Boys eschews much of the post-modern trappings that have defined the western genre in the nineties. Sure, it begins with a credits sequence that mimics the style of an old silent serial (complete with a fisheye lens), and it has one scene in which some of the eponymous boys are accused of stealing from a movie house (though they are never convicted), but the film's sensibilities seem much closer to those of the 1920's in which the film was set. It's an old-fashioned work, and that feeling is compounded by some wonderful documentary footage that plays during the credits. The comments of those involved in the actual events lend an immeasurable air of authenticity to the film.  It might be tempting to classify the film's identification with the bank robbers as post-modern, especially since Bonnie and Clyde essentially kicked off the modern era of filmmaking, but consider the fact that even 1903's The Great Train Robbery gave more screen time to its criminals than its posse.That screen time tells a fairly standard story, and there are few genuine surprises to be found in that respect. Still, the movie isn't so much about plot as mood and character. This is the closest Linklater has come to making a Hollywood film, and he uses the resources to enhance, rather than ignore, his worldview. The cast is fairly excellent, with Ethan Hawke's drunkard being the standout. Matthew McConaughey has the largest role, and shows more charm here than in nearly any other film that he has been in. Although the film's setting is far from the modern day slacker world of Linklater's other films, the prevailing attitude seems to be the same. It's a mix of Texan charm and genteel sophistication. This treatment of the subject matter doesn't ever come off as cocky. It creates a wonderful sense of respect toward history. Several times, the Newton boys are allowed to state their socio-political justification for robbing banks. That they use flawed logic isn't the point. That they get a chance to make their case is. Linklater really isn't an astounding visualist (though the film is attractive) nor does he have a tremendous sense of pacing. What he does have is a humanist streak that runs throughout his films. Even when a double cross occurs in the film, he pauses to note that the traitor continued to assert his innocence. That genuine regard for his characters and fidelity to his setting are his strongest directorial traits.

444974,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6305037728,Michael Butts,"[3, 4]","THE NEWTON BOYS is a well done period film, richly and warmly photographed and performed by a talented cast.  I still have a problem in &quot;justifying&quot; their robberies.  Willis' conclusion that he has been done wrong so he can do wrong too is not a quality I find admirable.  Stealing is stealing, and Linklater makes it look perfectly normal to &quot;cheer&quot; these boys on.  The fact that this is a true story only adds fire to the fuel of how we make heroes out of bad guys because they were &quot;cute&quot; or they got the &quot;system&quot;, etc., etc.  Nough about that, though.  Matthew McConaughey, Skeet Ulrich and Ethan Hawke are splendid; they needed to give the excellent Vincent D'Onofrio more to do; Julianna Margulies was fascinating as Louise; Luke Askew in a great supporting role as the suspect-beating cop; and Dwight Yoakam as the friend who supplies the nitroglycerin.The movie is a little long, drags some in the middle, but for a period piece, it's effective...just don't think these guys are heroes.

Do  not rent or purchase this movie, and if it comes on cable change the  channel.
