723018,A15AGUKQHFC1DU,B00006SFJM,"Alexander Stroud ""nurse decapitator""","[3, 3]","I didn't know much about this movie when I picked it up. I had seen a picture from the movie of some sort of bone/raindeer/monster thing that made me want to see what it was. Not at all what I had expected. Wendigo, in short, seems to be a story about the relationships of a family who go from good to traumatic. Jake Webber (Dawn of the Dead '04) is the star of the movie. He's a father who loves his son, and cares for his wife. He obviously pays more attention to the son, distractingly played by Malcom in the Middle's Erik Per Sullivan. The mother/wife, Patricia Clarkson, doesn't play a huge role in the movie, rather boring. Not a whole lot happens in the first half hour of the movie besides watching father-son bonding and learning a little bit about the Wendigo legend. The last 20 minutes or so of the movie is where things really take a turn. After a sleding accident, the family returns home at night to find a disturbingly tall creature in their front yard. The rest of the movie is kind of crazy if not cheesy but still graps your attention with the father-son parting scene at the end. This movie was not what I had expected, or wanted, but it didn't dissapoint me. It's just not a movie that will be seen again anytime soon.",3,Cool idea...,1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,1241,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'movie', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'had', 'seen', 'picture', 'movie', 'sort', 'bone/raindeer/monster', 'thing', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'Not', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'Wendigo', 'short', 'be', 'story', 'relationships', 'family', 'who', 'go', 'good', 'traumatic', 'Jake', 'Webber', 'Dawn', 'Dead', ""'04"", 'star', 'movie', 'father', 'who', 'son', 'cares', 'wife', 'obviously', 'more', 'attention', 'son', 'distractingly', 'played', 'Malcom', 'Middle', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'mother/wife', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', ""n't"", 'play', 'huge', 'role', 'movie', 'rather', 'boring', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'watching', 'father-son', 'bonding', 'learning', 'little', 'bit', 'Wendigo', 'legend', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'where', 'things', 'really', 'take', 'turn', 'sleding', 'accident', 'family', 'home', 'night', 'find', 'disturbingly', 'tall', 'creature', 'front', 'yard', 'rest', 'movie', 'kind', 'crazy', 'not', 'cheesy', 'still', 'graps', 'attention', 'father-son', 'parting', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'wanted', 'did', ""n't"", 'dissapoint', 'just', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon']",Wendigo

But this movie...hmm. I thought it spend so much time setting up a story that turned out to be nothing in the end. We find out all sorts of things about the family dynamic of the characters, but then in the end, what difference does it make? I was expecting some big confrontation with the Wendigo, but it appears that it was mostly in the little boy's head and the real evil were those stereotyped rednecks. (Surprise, surprise!) It's hard for me to get excited about a movie that has about five things happen in the whole of it, and then ends so unsatisfyingly.Through most of the movie, I thought it looked like a student film which showed off a lot of new tricks the director learned (the fast, jerky motions; the 360-degree spin-around; the superimposed images that I assume are supposed to be creepy) but when it comes down to content, the movie just doesn't deliver.And a personal thing--why is it that movie hospitals are always completely deserted?

723020,A3G3HPYV1DBRC6,B00006SFJM,Andrew,"[3, 6]","For the first 10 minutes of the film, I thought, this is going to be cool- grainy, no big budget CGI to ruin a nice story line, little kids (always make for a creepy time unless your the one gloved wonder), incoherent redneck, city folk in the country, etc.20 minutes later, I thought, ok, this is an indie, so it's going for the depth and camera work that will probably make sense soon then it's going for the jugular.35 minutes later, I had to go to the bathroom.40 minues later, I was beginning to think that maybe this wasn't a horror film but a bad sequel to Deliverance or Redneckville's gift to cinema: Bambi vs NASCAR.An hour later, I got scared. I realized I was wasting my time and I would never get it back- still I had invested too much time to just stop watching it.When it was all said and done, there was a hood ornament chasing a redneck while a kid lay on a bed holding what was NOT a Transformer, but more than meets the eye, that was given to him by a Native American that was more than likely a Poltergeist- those prankster ghosts always trying to get some to shoplift (Next time you're caught trying to walk out with something say- 'My native American brethern gave it to me' and see if they give you a bargain)! All the while, in the background auditions, were being held for Patient 874 in an upcomming episode of ER. Let us not forget about the poor cop in dire need of Rid who was left outside a trailer like a poor Watchtower pusher on Christmas eve. Then there's the boots. I don't want to spoil the ending- but, oh those scary Nancy Sinatras weren't made for walking, were they?I love horror movies. I love indie horror movies the best because they are character driven and rely more on 'what you can't see' to creep you out. This movie is about as incoherent and dumb as my review. There's nothing scary about this film and the plot is shotty at best. I will say the acting is a bit better than Matress Mac selling Gallery Furniture or Bitsy selling a 4x4 in Dixie Country. Also, it does a decent job of providing about 1 minute worth of creepiness. This is mainly achieved through ticking clocks and blood dripping from this hanging string-- I know, I know- BOO!However, the camera angles (that have received much praise inseveral reviews) are silly: Family Scene- then cut to snow, trees, branches- family scene- cut to a totem pole and a dead deer- back to snow back to braches- now throw glitter into the wind! My favorite of the worst was when tree branches were tied to a camera and someone ran with it through the woods. WOW! Ohh. Creepy. Branches brushing up against branches. Yeah, whatever! This sort of stuff kind of worked in The Blair Witch, but is done so poorly on this film that it's funny.The angles and camera work is not thought out at all- there is no artistic value in them. It's like someone said, ""quick, we've got 25 minutes of film we have to use, record different parts of the woods!"" Then, they used those parts to put into the movie to make arthouse wannabees think they were watching something with depth and value when in actuallity they were probably added to make this movie a Full Length Feature instead of a Short Film.This could have been a decent to good film if it was done differently, say with some supernatural spooks. You want something creepy and artistic and GOOD???- watch The Devil's Backbone- superb film!I give Wendigo 1.25 stars and I am being kind. I would have given it 1, but I thought the make out scene was kind of sexy.",1,At least an angry bambi did a brief cameo.,1112832000,"04 7, 2005",2005,3502,"['first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'thought', 'going', 'be', 'cool-', 'grainy', 'big', 'budget', 'CGI', 'ruin', 'nice', 'story', 'line', 'little', 'kids', 'always', 'make', 'creepy', 'time', 'one', 'gloved', 'wonder', 'incoherent', 'redneck', 'city', 'folk', 'country', 'etc.20', 'minutes', 'later', 'thought', 'ok', 'indie', 'going', 'depth', 'camera', 'work', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'sense', 'soon', 'then', 'going', 'jugular.35', 'minutes', 'later', 'had', 'go', 'bathroom.40', 'minues', 'later', 'was', 'beginning', 'think', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'horror', 'film', 'bad', 'sequel', 'Deliverance', 'Redneckville', 'gift', 'cinema', 'Bambi', 'vs', 'NASCAR.An', 'hour', 'later', 'got', 'scared', 'realized', 'was', 'wasting', 'time', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'back-', 'still', 'had', 'invested', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'just', 'stop', 'watching', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'hood', 'ornament', 'chasing', 'redneck', 'kid', 'lay', 'bed', 'holding', 'what', 'was', 'NOT', 'Transformer', 'more', 'eye', 'was', 'given', 'Native', 'American', 'was', 'more', 'likely', 'Poltergeist-', 'prankster', 'ghosts', 'always', 'trying', 'get', 'shoplift', 'Next', 'time', ""'re"", 'caught', 'trying', 'walk', 'out', 'something', 'say-', 'native', 'American', 'brethern', 'gave', 'see', 'give', 'bargain', 'while', 'background', 'auditions', 'were', 'being', 'held', 'Patient', '874', 'upcomming', 'episode', 'ER', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'poor', 'cop', 'dire', 'need', 'Rid', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'outside', 'trailer', 'poor', 'Watchtower', 'pusher', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'Then', 'boots', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'ending-', 'oh', 'scary', 'Nancy', 'Sinatras', 'were', ""n't"", 'made', 'walking', 'were', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'love', 'indie', 'horror', 'movies', 'best', 'are', 'character', 'driven', 'rely', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'creep', 'out', 'movie', 'incoherent', 'dumb', 'review', 'nothing', 'scary', 'film', 'plot', 'shotty', 'best', 'will', 'say', 'acting', 'bit', 'better', 'Matress', 'Mac', 'selling', 'Gallery', 'Furniture', 'Bitsy', 'selling', '4x4', 'Dixie', 'Country', 'Also', 'decent', 'job', 'providing', '1', 'minute', 'worth', 'creepiness', 'mainly', 'achieved', 'ticking', 'clocks', 'blood', 'dripping', 'hanging', 'string', 'know', 'know-', 'BOO', 'However', 'camera', 'have', 'received', 'much', 'praise', 'inseveral', 'reviews', 'are', 'silly', 'Family', 'Scene-', 'then', 'cut', 'snow', 'trees', 'branches-', 'family', 'scene-', 'cut', 'totem', 'pole', 'dead', 'deer-', 'back', 'snow', 'back', 'braches-', 'now', 'throw', 'glitter', 'wind', 'favorite', 'worst', 'was', 'when', 'tree', 'branches', 'were', 'tied', 'camera', 'someone', 'ran', 'woods', 'WOW', 'Ohh', 'Creepy', 'Branches', 'brushing', 'up', 'branches', 'Yeah', 'sort', 'stuff', 'kind', 'worked', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'done', 'so', 'poorly', 'film', 'funny.The', 'angles', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'thought', 'out', 'all-', 'artistic', 'value', 'someone', 'said', 'quick', ""'ve"", 'got', '25', 'minutes', 'film', 'have', 'use', 'record', 'different', 'parts', 'woods', 'Then', 'used', 'parts', 'put', 'movie', 'make', 'arthouse', 'wannabees', 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'something', 'depth', 'value', 'when', 'actuallity', 'were', 'probably', 'added', 'make', 'movie', 'Full', 'Length', 'Feature', 'instead', 'Short', 'Film.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'differently', 'say', 'supernatural', 'spooks', 'want', 'something', 'creepy', 'artistic', 'GOOD', 'watch', 'Devil', 'Backbone-', 'superb', 'film', 'give', 'Wendigo', '1.25', 'stars', 'am', 'being', 'kind', 'would', 'have', 'given', '1', 'thought', 'make', 'out', 'scene', 'was', 'kind', 'sexy']",Wendigo

A family, on their way to a isolated mountain retreat (always a bad idea), hit a deer and their car gets stuck in the snow. We see this from the perspective of the child - or, at least, we share his sense of dread, his desire for night to cease (so that his dreams will stop turning into nightmares). The director, Larry Fessenden, is also the editor and he has a real feel for how to use digital editing techniques to enhance the look and texture of his film. (Although he is less successful in staging action sequences.) I typically loathe digital editing effects - I still prefer to use Avid - but I was rather impressed with Fessenden's use of this technology. Having said that, the second half of the film - especially the climax - is a disappointment. This has less to do with the low-budget FX though than with the muddled plot: Deliverance meets Pumpkinhead.",3,why all the bad reviews?,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,954,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'one', 'star', 'reviews', 'opening', 'forty', 'minutes', 'are', 'rather', 'good', 'family', 'way', 'isolated', 'mountain', 'retreat', 'always', 'bad', 'idea', 'hit', 'deer', 'car', 'stuck', 'snow', 'see', 'perspective', 'child', 'least', 'share', 'sense', 'dread', 'desire', 'night', 'cease', 'dreams', 'will', 'stop', 'turning', 'nightmares', 'director', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'also', 'editor', 'real', 'feel', 'how', 'use', 'digital', 'editing', 'techniques', 'enhance', 'look', 'texture', 'film', 'less', 'successful', 'staging', 'action', 'sequences', 'typically', 'loathe', 'digital', 'editing', 'effects', 'still', 'prefer', 'use', 'Avid', 'was', 'rather', 'impressed', 'Fessenden', 'use', 'technology', 'Having', 'said', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'especially', 'climax', 'disappointment', 'less', 'do', 'low-budget', 'FX', 'muddled', 'plot', 'Deliverance', 'meets', 'Pumpkinhead']",Wendigo

But things turn messy when their car hits a deer &amp; is run off the road. Looking for help they come across a couple of nasty rednecks out a-huntin' in the woods; and they're none too happy that a dad-burn city slicker done run over their dinner!As if this isn't bad enough the impact of the crash has left the deer with a busted antler- never mind that the animal is DEAD already. One of the rednecks, Otis; doesn't like this either. Nosiree Bob. He can't have the stag's head hanging over his mantle with one antler when his buddies come round to his shack for moonshine &amp; a rousing game of long- distance tobaccer juice spittin'! Ptooey!So the MacLaren family aren't exactly in these folks good books, so their relaxing getaway hasn't got off on the right foot: and it doesn't help that they're holidaying in a scungy one horse hick town (the NZ equivalents would be either Dargaville or Pounawea- the alimentary canal of Godzone).However later while out shopping with his mother, Miles discovers a gift shop where an unusual item takes his fancy- a statue of a Wendigo, a shape shifting Indian spirit. An elderly Indian man in the shop gives it to Miles as a gift, but when he takes it up to the counter, he discovers that he has to pay for it. The old man has mysteriously disappeared, &amp; the clerk at the counter has never seen nor heard of him (Twilight Zone music).But of course this is no ordinary statue. Obviously when you're dealing a Native American guy who talks the usual spiritual mumbo-jumbo littered with similies &amp; no apostrophes, you know these people are in for bad luck. And that's just what they get, when accidents start happening to them... &amp; this soon reaches a crescendo of gruesome slayings... and let's not forget about them fumin' angry Good Ole'Boys, &amp; I ain't talkin' 'bout Bo &amp; Luke Duke. Nope, this hit 'n' run's left them wound up tighter 'n Daisy's shorts! (Mmmm!) Now they's out fer blood!Written and Directed by Larry Fossenden, WENDIGO is above average of its type &amp; most of the horror in the film is wisely implied until near the end. When you actually get to see the &quot;Wendigo&quot; itself, it looks so cheesy that it was actually a very wise decision on the film maker's part to leave its appearance to the viewers imagination.WENDIGO is an above average horror.

The ...movie Wendigo. ...in hand WENDIGO, this movie was never boring, the acting was all round excelent ... especially from the young boy Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey in Malcolm in the Middle) the script is well above average for a horror movie especially in this day and age were CGI seems to dominate the content and push along a very weak and mirrored narrative. Wendigo does not contain any of todays teen horror / slasher flick genre trademarks. ...But here for me was a little treasure that I came to ponder about for several weeks after. Not a great masterpiece mind you, such as the final 20 minutes of the movie could have been handled a little more restraintly but that doesn't put you off the movie as a whole. I know now from watching this movie that I will be looking out for Larry Fessenden the director in the future for I am sure he will go onto greater things. As it stands, give Wendigo a chance ... at least it dared to be slightly different and contained, for me, the most important ingredient of any horror movie, ATMOSPHERE!And remember when independent horror flicks do come our way they will never appeal to the vast majority of audiences tastes simply because they were never meant too, if Windigo had then Larry Fessenden wouldn't have gone out and made it he would have made something like I Know What you Did Last Summer or Final Destination 2.Lastly, if anybody is too blame for the slasher / gore generation being misguided to hire this flick out, it should be the those PR reps at promising themes that the film may not contain.

723030,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00006SFJM,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[4, 7]","You're in the video store, looking for a decent, spooky, atmospheric DVD---and you see Wendigo, and hey, it has all the right elements:*A young and vulnerable family isolated in a country farmhouse in the Connecticut woods.*Whiskey drinking, rifle-toting yokels lurking about, with rapine and revenge on their minds.*An impressionable boy who speaks with an old Indian shaman about the terrible legend of the Wendigo, a fearsome creature that inhabits the primal woods around town, can take any shape, and ""as he eats gets bigger, and the bigger he gets, the hungrier he gets.""Sounds like a perfect horror flick, you think, right?  Dead wrong. Wendigo is an excremental monster mash of cinematic mediocrity and a boring disappointment.  Part ""Blair Witch Project"", a slice of  ""The Shining"", and a sprinkleof ""Deliverance"", the film shamelessly rips off all of these films and delivers as much excitement as your relatives' home movies.What is most disappointing about ""Wendigo"" is that it had so much potential, and for the first 30 minutes I was hooked.  The setting, supposedly in upstate Connecticut, is both tranquil and foreboding, and the cinematography, competently rendered, adds to the initial feeling of isolation.  The acting is also good throughout, from the yokels (who range from surly and uncommunicative to murderous) to the family.  Patricia Clarkson, who starred alongside Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness's wife in the Untouchables, carries out her part with humor, reserve, and quiet conviction.  Father Geoge (Jake Weber), a troubled commercial photographer, is also solid and convincing in what could have been a cut-out role.  And Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey from Fox's ""Malcolm in the Middle""), a cute and mopeylittle boy, does a competent job playing---surprise!---a cute and mopey little boy.Indeed, some of the scenes are rich in atmosphere, hinting atnastiness to come.  The initial confrontation with the town yokels is handled superbly, and the sense of isolation and palpable menace sets the groundwork for something malevolent and engrossing.And then nothing happens. For about sixty minutes, ""Wendigo"" meanders lamely and turgidly along; oh yes, we have the legend of the Wendigo as told by a spooky Indian shaman, but even that loses its power after about the 40th voice-over.  A little jerky and overly clever camera work, some bad CGI, but that's it. The climactic scene where the Wendigo reveals itself to its hapless victim is so atrociously done, and the 'special effects' so bad,How to think of ""Wendigo""? Imagine ""Deliverance"" without Ned Beatty squealing like a pig, a ""The Shining"" where Jack actually gets into writing his book, or ""Blair Witch"" without the witch, and you get a small sense of how exceedingly dismal ""Wendigo"" is.The only thing I can imagine someone might get out of watching this film is in thinking what might have been.  In the hands of a competent, capable director, the solid acting, creepy premise, and excellent locations might have been made into a fine film.  But then, what's the point? Save 90 minutes of your life and rent a decent horror movie.",1,"Dismal, slow, looks like a home video.

723031,ACXDDDPTK8OL,B00006SFJM,Deckard,"[7, 10]","I thoroughly enjoyed this original and intelligently made film, but I think that in order to do so, you really have to leave your pre-conceptions at the video shop door. If you pick a film wanting it to be something, then you're gonna be annoyed when it's not. My advice on Wendigo is just to watch it. Don't expect it to be anything, no matter what anyone says. Not deliverance, not a monster movie, not the blair witch, not Halloween. Give yourself some credit - you can watch something new and unique can't you? The story follows a young couple and their son on a weekend away up in the snow covered countryside. They have a run in with some local hunters on their way to the house, and as the weekend unfolds the young boy becomes aware of the Wendigo - a powerful spirit of Indian legend. Gradually the young family, the hunters, and the legend all become entangled as the film reaches it's conclusion. The performances are great, and the script is full of realism, purpose and pace. The dream sequences and visuals are extremely creepy, and atmospheric. The fact that a lot of people seem to think that this is a monster movie about a Deer-man is absolutely hysterical!! The Wendigo is an ancient spirit, one that takes on many forms (which incidently it does in the film). Just think about why it takes on the forms that it does, and then maybe you will draw your conclusions as to the spirit's intentions. And this for me was the real driving force and mystery behind the film. The Wendigo's purpose depends entirely on you. Maybe it is the unseen force that guards and provides the purpose in life. Maybe it's the keeper of the balance amongst all living things. Maybe it's just a big old tree that scares little kids. What you bring to this movie will ultimately determine what you'll take from it.

723033,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B00006SFJM,Draconis Blackthorne,"[2, 4]","A dark psychological thriller which accesses more of an atmospheric sense of terror, rather than blatant displays of gore - very subtle, leaving the mind to 'fill in' some of the plot ideas - one derives a sense of 'something' haunting the woods, being itself part of the woods, the trees, the grass, the wind, the animals, the night itself. The wendigo is the spirit of vengeance in native american culture, invoked to address a wrong committed by the rotten, to set the natural balances straight.A family travels through the backwoods when they become entrapped within a snowy ditch after having striuck a deer on the highway, and the only people around are a gaggle of hunting drunken rednecks who complain that the deer's antlers are broken, thus minimizing its prize value. The family eventually make it to their destination, but not after the presumptuous interference of the hicks, especially ""Otis"" now and again, who also happens to be a peeping Tom. The new house seems haunted, with its bloody memories appearing to the perceptive son, in somewhat of a ""sixth sense"" manner.They take a quick trip into town to survey the local neighborhood, and come across a store selling rather odd little items, when the boy is confronted by a native american stranger who relates to him the legend of 'the wendigo', and bestows him a veritable talisman resembling a deer-like 'Pan' figure - the stranger disappears as mysteriously as he appeared, like the wind, yet the story of the wendigo haunts the boy, who begins sensing its presence throughout the environment, which begins increasing exponentially as the nights go on - a feeling of impending doom looms heavy in the air.So he and pop go sledding, but things go horribly awry, as dad is knocked off therefrom and lays in a bloody heap in the snow. After a few hours of unconsciousness, he is taken to the hospital, and much is revealed in the climax of the film, as the wendigo lurks in the darkness of the forest, taking an anthropomorphic form as well, and justice is served in a delightfully ironic twist at the end.This is probably not a film for those with a short attention span, accustomed to exaggerrated stuntman exploits, profuse gore, or fight movies, as again, the plot is subtle, and many wonderful effects are used to accentuate the pleasant eeriness felt here. To truly appreciate the film, one must immerse oneself completely within it. An understanding of metaphor and poetic justice is elemental.

Even though I have some problems with the script and some of the acting, Larry Fesseden does a great job creating and sustaining a sense of menace, and in the tradition of the best horror literature and films, the supernatural arises as a projection of the psychological state of the characters. Also, the Wendigo itself is brilliantly presented. Rather than struggling to come up with a convincing monster on a low budget, Fessenden creates a bizarre, deliberately unreal-looking contraption shot and edited in a surreal manner that is startlingly effective.",4,Good but flawed indie horror film,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,744,"['Note', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'horror', 'fans', 'Ignore', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'here', 'unimaginative', 'dim-bulb', 'kids', 'Wendigo', 'easily', 'one', 'better', 'horror', 'films', 'last', '5', 'years', 'so', 'Even', 'have', 'problems', 'script', 'acting', 'Larry', 'Fesseden', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'sustaining', 'sense', 'menace', 'tradition', 'best', 'horror', 'literature', 'films', 'supernatural', 'arises', 'projection', 'psychological', 'state', 'characters', 'Also', 'Wendigo', 'brilliantly', 'presented', 'Rather', 'struggling', 'come', 'up', 'convincing', 'monster', 'low', 'budget', 'Fessenden', 'bizarre', 'deliberately', 'unreal-looking', 'contraption', 'shot', 'edited', 'surreal', 'manner', 'startlingly', 'effective']",Wendigo

Not really.........but I have to admit that I was shocked concerning how much I enjoyed this film particularly the second time around. Now.......there are many opinions on why people like or dislike this movie so I don't want to be disrespectful of the views of others, but I honestly felt that for the most part that director Larry Fessenden made a pretty unique & errie film.However.....I would not really class it as conventional ""horror"" but rather a tale of supernatural legend/lore if that makes any sense? A dear friend who is a production designer/artist was a guest at a specialscreening of Phantasm in NY a couple years ago & Fessenden attended as he was screening a new film as well. My friend remarked to him that he & I really enjoyed Wendigo & how difficult it is to find new & innovative stuff, but we were a little put off by some of the creature shots that he chose to use in the film while there were shots in the special features that looked much better ,but other than that the film was pretty tight. Needless to say this did not go over well with the somewhat jaded director & he refused to reply?

723041,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00006SFJM,Jeffrey Leach,"[10, 14]","The director of &quot; Wendigo,&quot; Larry Fessenden, claims in a short interview on the DVD that he first learned of this supernatural monster from a teacher during his days in elementary school. Intrigued by the idea, and apparently inspired by it as well, Fessenden decided to direct a film utilizing the eerie idea of a half man, half beast creature roaming through the snow covered forests of the Catskills. The director is seemingly unaware that the Wendigo was arguably one of Algernon Blackwood's most effective spook stories. This British author set his tale in the wilds of Canada towards the end of the nineteenth century where a hunting expedition undergoes a horrific encounter with the bloodthirsty Indian legend. The yarn is creepy to the nth degree, one of the best horror stories I have ever read. Sadly, Fessenden's take on the Wendigo legend fails to live up to the high standards set by author Blackwood. What a shame, too, because a movie incorporating even a tenth of the atmosphere found in the written version would have been a worthy endeavor indeed. Oh well, cinematic adaptations of H.P. Lovecraft stories rarely entertain either. Perhaps someday someone will do justice to the Wendigo legend--oh, I forgot! Someone did accomplish just such a feat. Its called &quot;Ravenous.&quot;&quot;Wendigo,&quot; Fessenden's version anyway, introduces us to Kim, George, and their son Miles. This is a family with problems, but we do not learn about them until well into the movie. We first see this big city trio driving into the Catskills in order to spend some time at the country house of a family friend. Both parents have stressful jobs: Kim is a psychiatrist and George is some sort of graphic artist. The son has his own problems, mainly a tentative relationship with his &quot;too busy to spend time with him&quot; father. The trip, therefore, will provide a chance for the family to reconnect. Problems emerge almost immediately when the car hits a deer on the road a few miles away from their destination. It soon becomes apparent that some local hunters were tracking the animal up until the time George mashed it to bits. The hunters are understandably upset about this unfortunate incident, especially Otis, one of the more obnoxious members of the group. George and Otis get into it over the dead animal, as does Kim when she screams and shouts about these guys having guns so close to her precious little son. Despite the hard feelings, the locals help pull George's car, which went into the ditch due to the deer, up onto the road.The weirdness continues once the three reach the house. Otis cruises by on the road near the house, glancing ominously up at the building before roaring off. An even more sinister incident happens when George and Kim notice someone fired a bullet through the window. It is clear Otis has a problem with these outsiders, a problem soon exacerbated by the bickering between Kim and George about their son and the father's inability to step back from his career. Still, the movie soldiers onward. A trip into town results in a peculiar encounter between Miles and a local Indian who tells the boy about the Wendigo legend and then gives him a figurine of the beast. Funny thing is, nobody knows anything about an old Indian in town. It seems that Miles experienced a supernatural incident. Meanwhile, more bullet holes in the house have just about worked Kim's last nerve to a frazzle. The police arrive on the scene too late to prevent a genuine tragedy from taking place. The movie concludes with a weeping Kim and a shocked Miles wondering just went wrong. Not surprisingly, the look on my face probably resembled Miles's visage to some extent, as I too wondered what had just taken place.Deviating significantly from Algernon Blackwood's story constitutes the gravest error of Fessenden's &quot;Wendigo.&quot; I would have preferred a shot by shot version of the story than yet another movie about a family in crisis expressed against the backdrop of a supernatural event. So what if Kim and George have numerous problems? What else is new? Everybody has difficulties within the family. The emphasis on a dysfunctional family might have been enough to save the movie if the characters were interesting. They are not: Kim is shrill and nagging, Miles distant and uncommunicative, and the problems I had with George are too numerous to list here. Suffice it to say he is a massive jerk with a bad haircut. When he and his wife started in on the hunters, my sympathies went to the locals. Here's an abrasive pair of big city know it alls trying to tell people what to do. They should have left them in the ditch. The good points of the film, namely the beautiful Clarkson, the occasionally oppressive mood, an interesting soundtrack, and a bit of violence are not enough to make this a film worthwhile. In fact, &quot;Wendigo&quot; reminded me of another indie clunker I saw recently called &quot;Kaaterskill Falls.&quot; This is not a good thing.The Wendigo does make an appearance towards the end of the film, but it is a slightly cheesy effect tricked up with fast camera cuts to hide the inherent flaws of the monster. Extras on the DVD include an interview with Fessenden, a commentary, a behind the scenes feature, and storyboards. The movie's picture quality is excellent, for what that is worth, but since the movie tanks I think you would be better off spending your hard earned coin on something else. Art snobs might love a movie like this; heck, even I like cerebral pictures like this one on occasion, but not on this outing.",2,Algernon Blackwood spins in his grave...,1074384000,"01 18,

723042,A25TN5K3J49GPO,B00006SFJM,JL1984,"[8, 11]","As I journey through the sea of cheesy yet humorous B movies I'm always in search of that one movie that will stick out from all the rest and will thus have the honor of being labeled as the worst movie known to man.  Though movies such as Back From Hell, Werewolf, and Zombie Lake have all come close to claiming this prestegious title, I would have to say that Wendigo not only surpasses them all, but also has the capabilites of forming a newer, more boring class of B movies known as C Movies as well.The hue of the film and the way in which camera angles are used in this movie borrows heavily from the theatrical blunder - The Blair Witch Project.  The story centers on a family who just so happen to be moving to an isolated cabin in upper NY or Connecticut and not only run into a conflict with hunters after hitting a deer, (which surprisingly leaves absolutely no damage to the car save a streak of fake blood), but also the mysterious legend of the Wendigo.  In its entirety, the Wendigo is only seen at the very end and its image is so obscured that you'd think the film was damaged.  The other 89 minutes of the movie mainly focus on the child's mental struggle with the surreal and the natural, as is depicted ONLY by: swirling camera visions of a somber forest, sullen shots of the boy's face, and an unforgettable array of melodramatic music.  The movie is hardly worth anyone's time as I found myself falling asleep about 30 minutes before its ""climactic ending"".There is a wide array of errors that attribute to this movie's putridity, but if I were to pick out one particular element that made the movie horrible, I'd have to say it'd be the sound.  In nearly every word spoken by any actor save the indian, the sound of their voices come out muffled.  I suppose had I been able to actually hear what the people were saying throughout this movie I would've been able to excuse a few of its flaws, however it just goes to show what you'll normally get when you watch low-budget films.  Yet another shocking fact that disgusted me was finding out the movie was made in 2001.  It looks as if it were made in 1981 which is something I personally find highly inexcusable in a film.  Add to that the movie's dullness and lack of practically anything save a few random shots of schizophrenic hunters and of the child's sullen countenance, and you've got Wendigo.All in all, this movie is probably the worst piece of trash that I've ever seen.  The movie had no plot whatsoever as the elements failed to tie together, sound that had me thinking my audio adjustments were off, about 75 minutes of pointless events, and the worst acting I've ever seen in ANY movie.

723043,ALY29A6CPLG2E,B00006SFJM,Joe Niedbala,"[2, 6]","I finally saw this film after much waiting, and gladly, knowing almost nothing about what to expect.Director Larry Fessenden will hopefully have many more films ahead of him. With Wendigo he has created the antithesis of the Hollywood film. By this, I don't mean nihilistic, amateurish, abstract, or any of the other qualities that, good or bad, are usually suggested by that concept. Well acted, beautifully photographed, with solid dialogue and even stronger visuals, Fessden has put his trust in the audience to take the lead and enter the path that he has pointed out to us.He manages to maintain a very low key, deliberately paced atmosphere of discomfort. This is all the more distubing when broken by his startlingly visual bursts. He never cinches once and for all whether the supernatural elements are real or just images brought on by paranoia and fear (or even just symbolism on the part of the filmmaker). Because of this, any &quot;flaws&quot; in the creature effects are rendered moot. The &quot;realism&quot; of the effects simply don't come into play. They serve their purpose splendidly. Just enough to get the point across without having to serve a whole garnished platter repleat with apple-mouthed pig.All of the performances seem almost underplayed. As a result, particularly with the family, we get a sense of reality in their relationships and situation. Very fly on the wall. There are many scenes that are almost mundane in their content, having little or nothing to do with the plot, but everything with giving us a feeling that we are watching real people.The parents, played wonderfully by Patricia Clarkson and Jake Weber, are often seen in a manner that you would never see in Hollywood. Casually cursing in front of their child, having minor squables, revealing their everyperson flaws, in other words, behaving like real world parents. There is no sense that these people need to be role models or have any fear of being admonished by the audience. The completely divergent ways that they, in one scene, try to calm their son's (Erik Per Sullivan -- revealing intelligence well beyond his so convincingly vapid Dewey on Malcom in the Middle) sudden wave of sad feelings are so true to life. Dad's &quot;Boys against the girls&quot; comment rings with such truth of life. Marvelous stuff!See this film. It is so unlike anything you will see come out of Hollywood and for all the right reasons.

He is a believable little boy, never seems like we are watching ""acting"". The parents are believable also. There are many moody shots of the forrest...that get a bit redundant and don't really lead anywhere. The ending is abrupt...and unsatisfying.

723046,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B00006SFJM,Joshua Koppel,"[3, 3]","This creepy indie film has a family heading out to upstate New York to a friend's cabin to get a bit of a vacation.  On their way they hit a deer and earn the ire of a local named Otis.  Otis and friend had been tracking the deer for hours.  An antler was cracked by the accident making it worth much less.  Eventually they manage to leave the hunters behind and make it to the house.  The next day they go into town for some supplies and the boy meets a strange Native American who teaches him about the legend of the Wendigo.  While not scared at first by the legend, the fear generated by the incident with the hunters begins to plague the boy.Later, the father is injured while sledding with the boy.  The boy gets scared and believes he is chased by the Wendigo.  He is found hours later by his mother.  Together they set out to find the father.  They find him and the boy has another run in with the Wendigo.  The action then moves to the hospital where the father receives treatment.  The boy sees the Indian again and the film ends.  Just stops.  That's it.According to an interview with the writer/director there is no monster in the film.  He is trying to show how myths come about to help explain the world.  But that doesn't explain the mysterious Indian that no one else seems to see.  Most of the acting was pretty good although some of the hospital personnel were poorly portrayed (I especially didn't like the casual and cavalier way one staff member delivered some news and sauntered away).  When the film ended I felt a little gypped.  There were plot threads I wanted to know more about.  We have a main character who may be wounded or dead and we never find out either way.  There is so much more to the story and it is just not there.Some of the special effects were quite good despite the small budget.  Some were really quite eerie and creepy.  I might have enjoyed the result a little better if I had not seen the interview but I would have still felt it just stopped instead of ending properly.  Some good points and some bad.  More like a promising first draft than a final.  Unfortunately there will be no final coming.  This is it.

Nevertheless, after watching this film last night I still felt cheated.""Wendigo"" was released by Artisan, the same company that gave the world ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and I'm sure the creative minds behind this film would love for it to be lumped into the same psychological horror genre as that film.

But while the film does a good job of using it's isolated rural setting to build an atmosphere of dread, it doesn't use these elements to push the film to a satisfying conclusion.  Ultimately, ""Wendigo"" gives its storyline and its actors nowhere to go and nothing do.The only actor in the film most folks are likely to have heard of is Eric Per Sullivan, who plays youngest brother, Dewey on Fox TV's ""Malcolm In The Middle"".  With his moon eyes and pensive glances he gives one of the best performances by a child actor in a suspense film since Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense.""But his performance can't save the rest of the film which nearly bored me to tears.

You can be driving down the street, minding your own business, and hit a deer; you can go on a vacation and find yourself with a troublesome neighbor; and you can go sledding and find yourself in the most hellish situation of your life. It's a concept all-too-real, but all-too-frightening as well.For George, his wife Kim, and their son Miles, life becomes all too real when they go up to the family cabin for a weekend outing.WENDIGO, released in 2001 to moderately-uneven reviews, is a movie that focuses heavily on characterization and story. Thought not a bad thing, viewers shouldn't go into this movie expecting a whole lot in regards to the horor element. The film plays out more as an edge-of-your-seat thriller than an actual horror movie. As a reviewer, I see it as a dramatic thriller with some horror elements, not a horror film.PROS:- The actors. Each and every actor that played in this movie portrayed their characters extraordinarily well. Throughout the film, I had no complaints in regards to any of the characters. Their actions were realistic, their portrayals were accurate, and their motives were pure, if only due to human necessity. As a viewer, I like to connect with characters that seem like more than actors. WENDIGO is extremely character-driven, and because of that, it's important to have actors that feel like more than just people playing a character. You don't feel like you're seeing someone playing a character in this movie; you see someone LIVING this movie.- The story. Though not as concentrated on the horror as the film makes itself out to be, the film presents itself as a well-thought-out family drama. The husband, avid photographer and troubled workaholic who doesn't know how to interact with his son; the wife, psychologist and worrysome mother; and the boy, curious, but not to the point where it might get him in trouble. These three characters save the film from being a total letdown. As its high point, the story does well with its portrayal of a family wanting to get away from life, but it also does well as a dramatic thriller in the latter half of the movie.The biggest and only con (that doesn't contribute the need to be sectioned into a list) is the absence of the real wonder of the movie--the Wendigo. A creature of Native American legend that `eats as it gets hungry' and `is an angry spirit,' it's only briefly shown near the end, when the man who ultimately tears the family's life apart is murdered in an act of vengence. This brief encapsulation of this highly-interesting creature is the biggest letdown of the entire movie, thus is the reason why I, as a reviewer, can only give it three stars. Had I wanted to go into a complete family drama, I would have picked something from the drama department. I picked WENDIGO because I wanted to see a horror movie. I didn't get that, which really disappointed me as someone who wanted to see a movie that looked to be more than it really is.As a film about a family ending up in a hellish situation, WENDIGO is the perfect film. As a horror film, it falls terribly short. The movie is only saved from being completely horrible due to its cast and incredible storytelling.In the end, WENDIGO is worth a watch, if only for the story alone. Diehard horror fans should probably avoid this film, if only to spare themselves the disappointment of not seeing the creature they're most likely going in to see.",3,A story film (not to be mistaken for a horror one.),1265155200,"02 3, 2010",2010,3476,"['Certain', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'perfectly-normal', 'ordinary', 'days', 'can', 'be', 'driving', 'street', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'hit', 'deer', 'can', 'go', 'vacation', 'find', 'troublesome', 'neighbor', 'can', 'go', 'sledding', 'find', 'most', 'hellish', 'situation', 'life', 'concept', 'all-too-real', 'all-too-frightening', 'well.For', 'George', 'wife', 'Kim', 'son', 'Miles', 'life', 'too', 'real', 'when', 'go', 'up', 'family', 'cabin', 'weekend', 'outing.WENDIGO', 'released', '2001', 'moderately-uneven', 'reviews', 'movie', 'heavily', 'characterization', 'story', 'Thought', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'viewers', 'should', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'whole', 'lot', 'regards', 'horor', 'element', 'film', 'out', 'more', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thriller', 'actual', 'horror', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'see', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'horror', 'elements', 'not', 'horror', 'film.PROS', 'actors', 'actor', 'played', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'film', 'had', 'complaints', 'regards', 'characters', 'actions', 'were', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'were', 'accurate', 'motives', 'were', 'pure', 'only', 'due', 'human', 'necessity', 'viewer', 'like', 'connect', 'characters', 'seem', 'more', 'actors', 'WENDIGO', 'extremely', 'character-driven', 'important', 'have', 'actors', 'feel', 'more', 'just', 'people', 'playing', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'someone', 'playing', 'character', 'movie', 'see', 'someone', 'LIVING', 'movie.-', 'story', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'concentrated', 'horror', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'well-thought-out', 'family', 'drama', 'husband', 'avid', 'photographer', 'troubled', 'workaholic', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'interact', 'son', 'wife', 'psychologist', 'worrysome', 'mother', 'boy', 'curious', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'might', 'get', 'trouble', 'three', 'characters', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'total', 'letdown', 'high', 'point', 'story', 'well', 'portrayal', 'family', 'wanting', 'get', 'away', 'life', 'also', 'well', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'latter', 'half', 'movie.The', 'biggest', 'only', 'con', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'need', 'be', 'sectioned', 'list', 'absence', 'real', 'wonder', 'movie', 'Wendigo', 'creature', 'Native', 'American', 'legend', 'eats', 'hungry', 'angry', 'spirit', 'only', 'briefly', 'shown', 'end', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'ultimately', 'family', 'life', 'apart', 'murdered', 'act', 'vengence', 'brief', 'encapsulation', 'highly-interesting', 'creature', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'entire', 'movie', 'thus', 'reason', 'why', 'reviewer', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'Had', 'wanted', 'go', 'complete', 'family', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'something', 'drama', 'department', 'picked', 'WENDIGO', 'wanted', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'really', 'disappointed', 'someone', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'looked', 'be', 'more', 'really', 'film', 'family', 'ending', 'up', 'hellish', 'situation', 'WENDIGO', 'perfect', 'film', 'horror', 'film', 'terribly', 'short', 'movie', 'only', 'saved', 'being', 'completely', 'horrible', 'due', 'cast', 'incredible', 'storytelling.In', 'end', 'WENDIGO', 'watch', 'only', 'story', 'alone', 'Diehard', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'film', 'only', 'spare', 'disappointment', 'not', 'seeing', 'creature', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'see']",Wendigo
723051,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00006SFJM,Lleu Christopher,"[4, 7]","This movie starts off in a manner typical for the horror genre --a family from the city is driving out to their new house in the country, where sinister supernatural forces await. The trouble for this family (the parents are played by Jake Weber and Patricia Clarkson, their son by Erik per Sullivan) starts before they even reach the house. Their Volvo station wagon hits a deer that three local hunters had been stalking. The ensuing confrontation is an interesting study in culture shock. The hunters are your typical movie rednecks; one has a particularly large chip on his shoulder and is furious that the deers' antlers were damaged in the accident. The city folks are quintessential yuppies who look upon locals who hunt the way a 19th Century English explorer might have looked at tribesmen deep in the Amazon jungle. Naturally, it turns out that these locals are going to be their neighbors. Much of the film's supernatural content revolves around the son, who is given a strange figure by a mysterious American Indian who only he can see. The figure, he is told, represents the ferocious Wendigo, a powerful and perpetually hungry spirit. The film does not fall into the predictable pattern of the Wendigo stalking the house and its inhabitants. Instead, we see more of the family's often tense interactions and further conflicts with the angry neighbor. Most of the thrills are very understated and we are often uncertain what is really happening and what is in the boy's imagination. Some of the scenes invite obvious comparison to The Blair Witch Project, as both use the natural eeriness of the woods as a primary device. While Wendigo has some compelling scenes and the performances are all good, the various elements don't exactly mesh. We are never told why or how this Wendigo manifests; it is all quite vague. The ending is dark and ambiguous, forcing the audience to speculate about the meaning. This was appropriate for The Blair Witch Project, but seemed like cheating with the more conventional set-up of Wendigo.",3,Interesting take on familiar genre,1040774400,"12 25, 2002",2002,2036,"['movie', 'off', 'manner', 'typical', 'horror', 'genre', 'family', 'city', 'driving', 'out', 'new', 'house', 'country', 'where', 'sinister', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'await', 'trouble', 'family', 'parents', 'are', 'played', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'son', 'Erik', 'Sullivan', 'even', 'reach', 'house', 'Volvo', 'station', 'wagon', 'deer', 'three', 'local', 'hunters', 'had', 'been', 'stalking', 'ensuing', 'confrontation', 'interesting', 'study', 'culture', 'shock', 'hunters', 'are', 'typical', 'movie', 'rednecks', 'one', 'particularly', 'large', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'furious', 'deers', 'antlers', 'were', 'damaged', 'accident', 'city', 'folks', 'are', 'quintessential', 'yuppies', 'who', 'look', 'locals', 'who', 'hunt', 'way', '19th', 'Century', 'English', 'explorer', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'tribesmen', 'deep', 'Amazon', 'jungle', 'Naturally', 'out', 'locals', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'neighbors', 'Much', 'film', 'supernatural', 'content', 'son', 'who', 'given', 'strange', 'figure', 'mysterious', 'American', 'Indian', 'who', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'figure', 'told', 'ferocious', 'Wendigo', 'powerful', 'perpetually', 'hungry', 'spirit', 'film', 'not', 'fall', 'predictable', 'pattern', 'Wendigo', 'stalking', 'house', 'inhabitants', 'Instead', 'see', 'more', 'family', 'often', 'tense', 'interactions', 'further', 'conflicts', 'angry', 'neighbor', 'Most', 'thrills', 'are', 'very', 'understated', 'are', 'often', 'uncertain', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'what', 'boy', 'imagination', 'scenes', 'invite', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'natural', 'eeriness', 'woods', 'primary', 'device', 'Wendigo', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'various', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mesh', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'why', 'how', 'Wendigo', 'quite', 'vague', 'ending', 'dark', 'ambiguous', 'forcing', 'audience', 'speculate', 'meaning', 'was', 'appropriate', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'seemed', 'cheating', 'more', 'conventional', 'set-up', 'Wendigo']",Wendigo

He portrays a young boy who finds himself enthralled by the legend of the Wendigo, an Indian folk legend that becomes horrifying real for him and his dysfunctional parents.  Larry Fessenden's film is a slow moving one and even when it picks up it's almost in slow motion.  There are, however, some truly eerie and ghostly scenes that merit it as a &quot;horror&quot; film, but as some reviewers noted, this is not a true representation of this film.  There is much mysticism and there is a dense portrayal of a family in hurt trying to heal the wounds.  Jake Weber and Patricia Clarkson are very effective as Miles' parents, but John Speradakos as the soon to be demented Otis is excellent in conveying evil in a soft, frightening manner.  The locale is beautiful in its winter isolation; some of the cinematography is also brilliant.

723054,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00006SFJM,Michael R Gates,"[3, 9]","Indie auteur Larry Fessenden's horror film WENDIGO is an intelligent and bone-chilling psychological sojourn to a nebular domain where Native American myth and reality converge.  It tells the story of an urban couple and their son Miles who, during a winter getaway to rural upstate New York, inadvertently provoke a prolonged fracas with an unbalanced local resident.  In the midst of the feuding, young Miles learns to cope with his ensuing anxieties and fears by placing his faith in The Wendigo, a wrathful spirit he has learned about from a mysterious Native American shaman.  But is the ancient spirit real, or is the boy's faith naively misplaced?Though produced on a meager budget, WENDIGO offers top-notch writing and direction from Fessenden; excellent cinematography, despite the 16mm-to-35mm blow-up technique used; outstanding acting, especially from the three principals; and simple but very effective special FX that should put more than a few big-budget Hollywood productions to shame.  The beautiful musical score, by composer Michelle Dibucci (1982's CREEPSHOW), is just this side of New Age stylistically, yet it is flavored with enough Native American elements that it cleverly echoes the film's dichotomous cultural subtext, while at the same time being ethereal enough to complement the spooky and otherworldly atmosphere required by the basic plot.WENDIGO serves up a subtle and tasteful nerve-tingling horror that is a refreshing alternative to the gore-laden horror movies that Hollywood often cranks out these days.  And like a lot of great art, this film requires that the observer exercise the ol' gray matter a little.  The younger crowd, therefore, will probably feel WENDIGO is too slow and lacking in blood-and-guts FX, but an audience with more mature tastes will really enjoy it.The DVD offers an crisp, clean digital transfer with good sound, as well as some interesting extras such as a behind-the-scenes featurette and a feature commentary from WENDIGO's creative and somewhat eccentric director.

There is a supernatural subplot that does not really show up until the final few minutes. In fact it is not really a horror movie at all and this is why it fails. The trailer and DVD box do little for it in that respect. If these guys are out to make a horror film then MAKE a horror film and not something that pretends to be a horror film and is in fact a boring &quot;drama&quot; about a family where nothing happens. If the DVD cover had a family sitting around an open fire in a log cabin with some guy standing outside with a gun.. well that would be more apt.. but lets face it - it would not sell that way and so they have boxed it up as a screaming horror film instead. In short, the distributors are cheating everyone here. Wendigo is a very bad marketing gimmick that wasted people's money. The film makers should be shammed.

723061,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B00006SFJM,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[6, 11]","'Wendigo' really is the sort of movie that you'll either love or hate. Wrongly classed by most as a horror movie, I had to watch it twice in order to fully appreciate it (I'm very glad I did), and, after reading this review, I hope you'll have a better understanding of why it's such a misunderstood film.A brief synopsis of the plot: Kim, George and their son Miles are taking a vacation in the Catskills, at the holiday home of a friend. Before they ever reach their destination, a collison with a deer and a nasty exchange between some hunters spoils their vacation, and things go from bad to worse as they are plagued by an angry local and the spirit of a Native American God, the Wendigo.Firstly, and most importantly, this is not a horror movie in the strictest sense of the word. It does have a supernatural baddie, but the real tension and atmosphere of 'Wendigo' comes from the beautifully-executed scenes of human conflict. John Speredakos is outstanding as the malevolent Otis, and turns in a performance as realistic as it is genuinely unnerving. The direction, too, is superior, with the hitherto relatively-unknown Larry Fessenden making excellent use of shocking rural North American-imagery and enigmatic Native American folklore to create a sense of the supernatural.'Wendigo' is a strange cross between psychological and supernatural horrors - picture 'The Silence of the Lambs' crossed with 'Anaconda' and you'll get the general idea. Although the titular 'Wendigo' does appear in the movie, he's merely secondary to the brilliantly realised tension between Otis and George. It's odd that such a contrast exists, the movie wouldn't actually make sense without a Demon, even though the human scenes are far superior. I don't know why, but it just works. The special effects for the demon are shoddy, but this is remedied greatly by Fessenden's heavy-handed use of unstructured camera work. A special mention, too, must go to Erik Per Sullivan as Miles - an excellent child actor playing his part with endearing realism.All in all, 'Wendigo' should be watched without any preconcieved ideas as to what a horror movie ought to be. It's a rewarding, surprisingly good offering and if you can put your previous experiences of horror aside, it's one of the best offerings of recent years.",4,Intelligent and Admirable,1070409600,"12 3, 2003",2003,2301,"['really', 'sort', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Wrongly', 'classed', 'most', 'horror', 'movie', 'had', 'watch', 'twice', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'reading', 'review', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'why', 'such', 'misunderstood', 'film.A', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'Kim', 'George', 'son', 'Miles', 'are', 'taking', 'vacation', 'Catskills', 'holiday', 'home', 'friend', 'ever', 'reach', 'destination', 'collison', 'deer', 'nasty', 'exchange', 'hunters', 'spoils', 'vacation', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'are', 'plagued', 'angry', 'local', 'spirit', 'Native', 'American', 'God', 'Wendigo.Firstly', 'most', 'importantly', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'strictest', 'sense', 'word', 'have', 'supernatural', 'baddie', 'real', 'tension', 'atmosphere', ""'Wendigo"", 'beautifully-executed', 'scenes', 'human', 'conflict', 'John', 'Speredakos', 'outstanding', 'malevolent', 'Otis', 'performance', 'as', 'realistic', 'genuinely', 'unnerving', 'direction', 'too', 'superior', 'hitherto', 'relatively-unknown', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'making', 'excellent', 'use', 'shocking', 'rural', 'North', 'American-imagery', 'enigmatic', 'Native', 'American', 'folklore', 'create', 'sense', 'supernatural', 'strange', 'cross', 'psychological', 'supernatural', 'horrors', 'picture', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'crossed', ""'Anaconda"", ""'ll"", 'get', 'general', 'idea', 'titular', 'appear', 'movie', 'merely', 'secondary', 'brilliantly', 'realised', 'tension', 'Otis', 'George', 'odd', 'contrast', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'Demon', 'even', 'human', 'scenes', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'just', 'special', 'effects', 'demon', 'are', 'shoddy', 'remedied', 'greatly', 'Fessenden', 'heavy-handed', 'use', 'unstructured', 'camera', 'work', 'special', 'mention', 'too', 'must', 'go', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'Miles', 'excellent', 'child', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'endearing', 'realism.All', ""'Wendigo"", 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'preconcieved', 'ideas', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'ought', 'be', 'rewarding', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'offering', 'can', 'put', 'previous', 'experiences', 'horror', 'aside', 'one', 'best', 'offerings', 'recent', 'years']",Wendigo
723062,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006SFJM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 10]","Wendigo (Larry Fessenden, 2001)Larry Fessenden gave the world his first entry into the hip, not-scary horror genre a few years back with Habit, an utterly engrossing vampire flick that's not as much about vampires as it is about its main character's slow descent into alcoholic madness. Well, Fessenden is back with his second foray into the genre, Wendigo, and we get the same treatment here we got in Habit. In other words, if you hated that one, don't bother with this one.Wendigo isn't a horror movie as such. It's more a family drama (not as in ""appropriate for the whole family,"" mind you). George (American Gothic's Jake Weber) and his wife Kim (the highly underrated Patricia Clarkson, recently in The Station Agent) have borrowed a country house for the weekend from a business associate, and headed up with their son, Miles (Erik Per Sullivan, Malcolm in the Middle's Dewey). What at first seems to be a regular weekend family trip opens up into the beginnings of an attempt at a journey to heal an unspecified fracture in George and Kim's relationship; we learn this, but we're never sure what the specific event was. We find out why; George is self-obsessed and stubborn, Kim is distant and unable to understand why her nagging George about his self-obsession and stubbornness won't change him. But the two have been married a while, and they have that dynamic about them. (Which is good, because any chance to see Patricia Clarkson unclothed should be eagerly snatched by the oversexed male film viewer.)The weekend is marred by an event on the way to the cabin, given to us in the opening scenes of the movie; George loses control of the car and hits a deer which is being pursued by a number of hunters, led by Otis (John Speredakos, recently in Rules of Engagement). Otis is not a nice guy, not at all. He seems perennially hopped up on something, is twitchy, nervous, and a little too fond of his rifle. Adding Otis into the equation makes things that much harder on the family. After all, once Otis is part of the equation, he's going all the way through to the solution.(The Wendigo itself, though it does play a part in the film, is a minor character at best, and is, perhaps, only a mass hallucination.)Again, as with Habit, what you see is not necessarily what you get. Those expecting a horror film are going to be disappointed; those expecting a heartfelt tear-jerker are unlikely to get that, either. It moves too slowly to be a thriller (which is probably the closest established genre to what Wendigo really is), but too quickly to be a slice-of-life film. In other words, it's uncategorizable.And perhaps that is why Wendigo is one of those films that will stay with you long after you've finished watching it. Everyone in the film portrays their characters wonderfully, and all the tension between the family members is believable. Otis is very much the backwoods dangerous redneck, and unlike most rednecks of recent years, something about him seems uncompromisingly dirty; the kind of detail one only expects to find in Lucio Fulci films, but that Fessenden never fails to do well (even in front of the camera, a la Session 9). Otis may be one of the most disturbing characters in modern film, on a visceral level; there's nothing that makes you sit up and say ""whoa!,"" just a vague feeling of unease whenever he's onscreen.Wonderful stuff. Not for everyone, but the few will adore it. ****",4,Fessenden does it (very well) again.,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,3421,"['Wendigo', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', '2001', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'gave', 'world', 'first', 'entry', 'hip', 'not-scary', 'horror', 'genre', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Habit', 'utterly', 'engrossing', 'vampire', 'flick', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'vampires', 'main', 'character', 'slow', 'descent', 'alcoholic', 'madness', 'Well', 'Fessenden', 'back', 'second', 'foray', 'genre', 'Wendigo', 'get', 'same', 'treatment', 'here', 'got', 'Habit', 'other', 'words', 'hated', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one.Wendigo', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'such', 'more', 'family', 'drama', 'not', 'appropriate', 'whole', 'family', 'George', 'American', 'Gothic', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'wife', 'Kim', 'highly', 'underrated', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'recently', 'Station', 'Agent', 'have', 'borrowed', 'country', 'house', 'weekend', 'business', 'associate', 'headed', 'up', 'son', 'Miles', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'Dewey', 'What', 'first', 'be', 'regular', 'weekend', 'family', 'trip', 'up', 'beginnings', 'attempt', 'journey', 'heal', 'unspecified', 'fracture', 'George', 'Kim', 'relationship', 'learn', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'what', 'specific', 'event', 'was', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'George', 'self-obsessed', 'stubborn', 'Kim', 'distant', 'unable', 'understand', 'why', 'nagging', 'George', 'self-obsession', 'stubbornness', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'while', 'have', 'dynamic', 'Which', 'good', 'chance', 'see', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'unclothed', 'should', 'be', 'eagerly', 'snatched', 'oversexed', 'male', 'film', 'viewer', 'weekend', 'marred', 'event', 'way', 'cabin', 'given', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'George', 'control', 'car', 'deer', 'being', 'pursued', 'number', 'hunters', 'led', 'Otis', 'John', 'Speredakos', 'recently', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'Otis', 'not', 'nice', 'guy', 'not', 'perennially', 'hopped', 'up', 'something', 'twitchy', 'nervous', 'little', 'too', 'fond', 'rifle', 'Adding', 'Otis', 'equation', 'things', 'much', 'harder', 'family', 'once', 'Otis', 'part', 'equation', 'going', 'way', 'solution', 'Wendigo', 'play', 'part', 'film', 'minor', 'character', 'best', 'perhaps', 'only', 'mass', 'hallucination', 'Again', 'Habit', 'what', 'see', 'not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'get', 'expecting', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'expecting', 'heartfelt', 'tear-jerker', 'are', 'unlikely', 'get', 'too', 'slowly', 'be', 'thriller', 'probably', 'closest', 'established', 'genre', 'what', 'Wendigo', 'really', 'too', 'quickly', 'be', 'slice-of-life', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'uncategorizable.And', 'perhaps', 'why', 'Wendigo', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'stay', 'long', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'watching', 'Everyone', 'film', 'characters', 'wonderfully', 'tension', 'family', 'members', 'believable', 'Otis', 'very', 'much', 'backwoods', 'dangerous', 'redneck', 'most', 'rednecks', 'recent', 'years', 'something', 'uncompromisingly', 'dirty', 'kind', 'detail', 'one', 'only', 'find', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'films', 'Fessenden', 'never', 'do', 'well', 'even', 'front', 'camera', 'la', 'Session', '9', 'Otis', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'characters', 'modern', 'film', 'visceral', 'level', 'nothing', 'sit', 'up', 'say', 'whoa', 'just', 'vague', 'feeling', 'unease', 'whenever', 'onscreen.Wonderful', 'stuff', 'Not', 'everyone', 'few', 'will', 'adore', '****']",Wendigo

'Wendigo' is a great example of this.As many other reviewers have pointed out, the atmosphere was really eerie.  I thought the director (Larry Fessenden) did a great job in setting the mood and directing his cast.  Other reviewers seem to disagree, but I though it was well acted.  Problem is though, it was almost as if Fessenden knew that the special FX were going to be lousy.  It seems to me like he tried to cover this up by dragging out the opening sequences and limiting the ammount of time that the Wendigo is on the screen to the bare minimum.This really ended up hurting his final product.  I wound up feeling like the movie turned out to be no better then a &quot;pretty good&quot; X-Files episode.  Simply put, it took too long to get started and then ended too quickly.Bottom line is, if you can catch it on cable or rent it at a reasonable rate, it's not at all a waste of your time.

The movie has a slow build-up filled with mundane drama, which some have criticized. Yet this is reminiscent of films likeThe Birds (Collector's Edition),"" where the main characters and a sense of realism are well established before things get going.""Wendigo"" is a mood piece more than anything else. The mysteriousness of the lonely Catskill woods is evoked along with a sense of wonder and fear of the unknown. It's a vibe more akin to ""The Mothman Prophecies"" than ""Ogre (Unrated).""Like ""The Mothman Prophecies"" ""Wendigo"" is somehow a pleasure just to watch (as long as you're not psyched-up for a monster-slasher flick). There's a quiet style and expertise to the filmmaking that smacks of professionalism.Patricia Clarkson is effective as the wife/mother and little Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the son, Miles.Interestingly, none of the special effects were done with CGI, but rather cinematic techniques, costumes, make-up and creative editing. It works for me.The film leaves the viewer somewhat scratching his/her head with its ambiguity. What conjured up the Wendigo? What's its purpose? How exactly does it ""devour"" people with its unquenchable hunger? Etc. Obviously if you like everything spelled out for you and don't like banging your head this is not the film for you.The film was shot in the Catskills, NY, and runs 91 minutes.GRADE: B+ or A-POSSIBLE EXPLANATION (SPOILER - don't read further if you haven't seen the film)Children are more sensitive to the spiritual realm because they haven't yet built up years of intellectual blockades along with social conditioning. It's clear that Miles senses malevolent creatures or spirits around him, which is why he and his mother check the closet and underneath the bed before he goes to sleep.The Wendigo is a spirit and can only manifest in the physical realm through an agent who releases the spirit through BELIEF. The Wendigo souvenir plays a role in the Wendigo's manifestation because it was created by someone who BELIEVED in the Wendigo; it's in essence an article of worship and, in a sense, an idol. Hence, the Wendigo is attracted to the figure, which can inspire BELIEF in certain individuals, like Miles.The ghostly Native American in the souvenir shop is obviously the Wendigo in human form. He's attracted to Miles because he senses belief and therefore guides the boy to the Wendigo figure and explains the ""legend."" He says, ""No one believes in spirits anymore,"" but after sharing the story of the Wendigo he asks the boy if he believes, to which Miles responds, ""I guess so."" This wasn't much, but it was all the Wendigo needed. The boy gets his mother to purchase the statue and thus the Wendigo is released into the physical realm to devour human prey.The Wendigo is an evil spirit and therefore a liar. In Indian form he claims that such spirits are not ""bad"" just ""angry."" In other words, he makes excuses for his malevolent actions. Our prisons are full of people who do the same thing.Once released, the Wendigo immediately inspires Otis to shoot the husband and, later, kill the cop. The Wendigo then goes after the very person he used, Otis, which shows that evil spirits will readily use you if you're willing and then lose you. Why didn't the Wendigo provoke someone else? Because evil spirits can only utilize those who are ALREADY given over to the dark side of their natures. The film shows that Otis was already an arrogant SOB and potential psycho. He doesn't go ""over the edge"" until AFTER the Wendigo is released.If you're wondering why the Wendigo required belief to manifest in the physical realm, just think about it: It's the same way with God. The bible says that ""without faith it is impossible to please God."" Faith is the key that activates God on our behalf, answers prayer, heals and moves mountains. Why would we think it's any different with spirit beings who aren't benign?

I'm not too sure wheter this was the intention or not but the movie delivered to me very much what I was wishing for when I did the rental. Basically, it's a sweet little family drama piece in which a couple and their kid is being confronted by a uncomfortable conflict with some locals. The family is a typical city sorta family that doesn't really behave better then the locals they meet right at the beginning of the film. Later they reach a friend's house they had rented for the weekend.The plot early on focuses on the family conflict while the pictures give you the idea that there's something special about the deers in the forest. The excellent music and the well shot pictures give you an eerie feeling about them. Maybe not in a dangerous but rather mysterious way.It's subtle for sure, definetly boring to some, but I was entertained by the believably performed family dynamics. The supernatural stuff is extremly rare and somewhere in the background most of the time. It pulled me in from the beginning to the end. The special effects are so-so but solid. They could have done without any at all to still support the subtle and comfortably haunting feeling of ""there's something out there"".If you like a bit of family drama, good actors having interesting dialogues, a bit of indian mystery breeze, it's a recommondation.",4,Impressive (little) family suspense drama in the woods,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,1388,"['true', 'Wendigo', 'not', 'exactly', 'horror', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'wheter', 'was', 'intention', 'not', 'movie', 'delivered', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'wishing', 'when', 'did', 'rental', 'Basically', 'sweet', 'little', 'family', 'drama', 'piece', 'couple', 'kid', 'being', 'confronted', 'uncomfortable', 'conflict', 'locals', 'family', 'typical', 'city', 'sorta', 'family', ""n't"", 'really', 'behave', 'better', 'then', 'locals', 'meet', 'right', 'beginning', 'film', 'Later', 'reach', 'friend', 'house', 'had', 'rented', 'weekend.The', 'plot', 'early', 'focuses', 'family', 'conflict', 'pictures', 'give', 'idea', 'something', 'special', 'deers', 'forest', 'excellent', 'music', 'well', 'shot', 'pictures', 'give', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'Maybe', 'not', 'dangerous', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'way.It', 'subtle', 'sure', 'definetly', 'boring', 'was', 'entertained', 'believably', 'performed', 'family', 'dynamics', 'supernatural', 'stuff', 'extremly', 'rare', 'somewhere', 'background', 'most', 'time', 'pulled', 'beginning', 'end', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so-so', 'solid', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'still', 'support', 'subtle', 'comfortably', 'haunting', 'feeling', 'something', 'out', 'there', '.If', 'bit', 'family', 'drama', 'good', 'actors', 'having', 'interesting', 'dialogues', 'bit', 'indian', 'mystery', 'breeze', 'recommondation']",Wendigo
