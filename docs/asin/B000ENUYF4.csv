974958,A2F6UZ8BMH45GX,B000ENUYF4,peter krug,"[7, 7]","In MR. MOM Michael Keaton is a man with a wife and three kids-two elementary school-age boys and a baby girl. Their family is like the classic pre-women's lib-era one: he goes to work every day while she has all the child-care and house-cleaning responsibilities. Then Mike is suddenly laid off from his job. He decides to get another one, but his wife decides she wants to see if she can get one herself. As it happens, she gets hired first, and Mike finds the roles reversed: while his wife goes to work, he must stay home and take care of the kids. Probably my favorite scenes are: when he's at a supermarket and he loses track of one of his boys, and finds some other kid hanging on his shopping cart. He finds his own son standing by a woman with a shopping cart. He switches kids, and as he's walking away with his son he hears the woman call out,""I don't have a kid!"" Also I like the scene where his baby daughter eats a whole can of chili. (Hope they have enough diapers on hand.)BABY BOOM was one of two films to come out in 1987 that delt with the theme of a childless adult who suddenly becomes the reluctant parent of a baby girl. (The other was THREE MEN AND A BABY.) Here Diana Keaton plays J.C. Wiatt, a high-powered corprate woman whose life is irreversibaly changed when she suddenly inherits a baby girl, Elizabeth.
