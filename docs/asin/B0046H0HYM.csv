He might have been a bit young to understand the story, but he loved the scenes with the firemen rallying to fight the fires.

My boys though are always disappointed when the show ends and want more, which is why this DVD rocks!  It is five straight episodes of Fireman Sam and full of lots of fun!  It is the first Fireman Sam DVD that I even knew existed and the first fireman show for kids I have ever come across.  The DVD is great and Fireman Sam really is full of great lessons of working together and solving problems.  We have watched this full DVDs a few times and my boys love it both watching it straight thru or watching an episode at a time.",5,Very fun!,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,613,"['have', 'only', 'caught', 'few', 'episodes', 'Fireman', 'Sam', 'boys', 'love', 'gang', 'boys', 'are', 'always', 'disappointed', 'when', 'show', 'want', 'more', 'why', 'DVD', 'five', 'straight', 'episodes', 'Fireman', 'Sam', 'full', 'lots', 'fun', 'first', 'Fireman', 'Sam', 'DVD', 'even', 'knew', 'existed', 'first', 'fireman', 'show', 'kids', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'DVD', 'great', 'Fireman', 'Sam', 'really', 'full', 'great', 'lessons', 'working', 'together', 'solving', 'problems', 'have', 'watched', 'full', 'DVDs', 'few', 'times', 'boys', 'love', 'watching', 'straight', 'thru', 'watching', 'episode', 'time']",N/A

Hensley ""Hensley's Bluegrass Music""","[1, 2]","I think education cartoons, like Fireman Sam, are the best way to introduce your toddler/preschooler to important topics like safety.  Kids have no real concept of danger, and shows like this one really seem to help get the point across that some things are dangerous and should be avoided.  It also reinforces that children should call for help.  The older the child, the more they will get from this cartoon.  Our almost-three year old loves Fireman Sam and we love what he is learning.",5,Fun Educational Cartoons,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,488,"['think', 'education', 'cartoons', 'Fireman', 'Sam', 'are', 'best', 'way', 'introduce', 'toddler/preschooler', 'important', 'topics', 'safety', 'Kids', 'have', 'real', 'concept', 'danger', 'one', 'really', 'seem', 'help', 'get', 'point', 'things', 'are', 'dangerous', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'also', 'children', 'should', 'call', 'help', 'older', 'child', 'more', 'will', 'get', 'cartoon', 'almost-three', 'year', 'old', 'Fireman', 'Sam', 'love', 'what', 'learning']",N/A
1387713,A7WDIKW44VEJ0,B0046H0HYM,Ron Hendricks,"[0, 0]",Grand kids (2 & 4) were visiting on a VERY rainy day and we gave in on watching TV.  Everything we came up with to watch was way to loud and intense.  The two year old wanted to watch one thing and the four year old wanted to watch something different.  Mimi and Poppa chose Fireman Sam and both boys settled in.  We enjoyed watching the Fire Crew rescue the towns' people from so many different situations.  And they definitely rescued our rainy afternoon.,5,Grand Parent Friendly,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,457,"['Grand', 'kids', '2', '4', 'were', 'visiting', 'VERY', 'rainy', 'day', 'gave', 'watching', 'TV', 'Everything', 'came', 'up', 'watch', 'was', 'way', 'loud', 'intense', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'wanted', 'watch', 'one', 'thing', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'wanted', 'watch', 'something', 'different', 'Mimi', 'Poppa', 'chose', 'Fireman', 'Sam', 'boys', 'settled', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Fire', 'Crew', 'towns', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'situations', 'definitely', 'rescued', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",N/A
