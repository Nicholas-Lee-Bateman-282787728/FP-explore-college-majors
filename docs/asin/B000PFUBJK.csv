In fact, by the third episode, I couldn't give a &#34;tinker's damn&#34; about Uncle Rory.  You could literally cut this 4 hour mini-series down to 90 minutes and not miss a thing.  I generally love British and BBC dramas, but this was a struggle to get through.  You could refer to this series as challenging.As one reviewer noted, the Scottish accent can sometimes be difficult to get around.  Actually, for the first 1/2 hour of the show, I really thought they were referring to Prentice as Princess...no kidding.This is only for those Anglophiles that have the patience of a saint and can get passed the Scottish accent.",3,I can take it or leave it,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,727,"['three', 'stars', 'indicate', 'okay', 'What', 'billed', 'mystery', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'very', 'mysterious', 'fact', 'third', 'episode', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', '34', 'tinker', 'damn', '34', 'Uncle', 'Rory', 'could', 'literally', 'cut', '4', 'hour', 'mini-series', '90', 'minutes', 'not', 'miss', 'thing', 'generally', 'love', 'British', 'BBC', 'dramas', 'was', 'struggle', 'get', 'could', 'refer', 'series', 'challenging.As', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'difficult', 'get', 'around', 'Actually', 'first', '1/2', 'hour', 'show', 'really', 'thought', 'were', 'referring', 'Prentice', 'Princess', 'kidding.This', 'only', 'Anglophiles', 'have', 'patience', 'saint', 'can', 'get', 'passed', 'Scottish', 'accent']",The Crow Road

I found it a little hard to understand some of the dialogue because of the accent, but it was worth the effort.  A young man, haunted by his uncle who disappeared under mysterious circumstances, goes looking for answers and uncovers a multitude of family secrets in the process.  Very satisfying.

1070759,AD44WZGK0FVHS,B000PFUBJK,Nightflyer,"[6, 7]","This is a terrific series, but it does make some demands on the viewer.  The frequent flashbacks (sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks) can be confusing on a first viewing; the Scottish brogue is sometimes difficult to understand; and anyone who has not spent some time in Scotland will probably not fully ""get it.""  But if you make the effort to get past these things, this series is enormously rewarding.  I'm watching it for the second time and getting so much more out of it than I did at first.  Still, I loved it the first time too.  And I am not exaggerating when I say it sometimes has me in tears, it is so moving.But if you're the sort of viewer who does not want any challenges, you should probably give it a pass.",5,A fantastic series that challenges the viewer,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,727,"['terrific', 'series', 'make', 'demands', 'viewer', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'sometimes', 'flashbacks', 'flashbacks', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'first', 'viewing', 'Scottish', 'brogue', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'understand', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'spent', 'time', 'Scotland', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'fully', 'get', 'make', 'effort', 'get', 'things', 'series', 'enormously', 'rewarding', ""'m"", 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'getting', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'first', 'Still', 'loved', 'first', 'time', 'too', 'am', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'when', 'say', 'sometimes', 'tears', 'so', 'moving.But', ""'re"", 'sort', 'viewer', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'challenges', 'should', 'probably', 'give', 'pass']",The Crow Road

1070761,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B000PFUBJK,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[2, 2]","This BBC TV adaptation of Iain Banks' novel, ""The Crow Road"" dates from 1996. It is perfectly attuned to the spirit of the book and I doubt that the many changes to the original story that have been necessary in order to present it cinematographically would upset even the most ardent of fans. The pace does start out a little slow, perhaps, but by and large, it is well handled over its four episode span, with each more gripping than the last. Performances by and large are good, with the strength of the dialogue making up for any hamminess in their delivery. Needless to say, Peter Capaldi shines in his role of the missing Uncle Rory -- a character who never actually appears in the book but masterfully added to the dramatisation by screenwriter, Bryan Elsley.  The musical soundtrack by Colin Towns is, characteristically, both highly evocative and annoyingly memorable.There are a couple of extras on the disc, in the form of a general interview with Iain Banks, and a director commentary track on the first episode, which is well worth a listen and gives an interesting insight into the values of the production team without giving away any surprises for the later episodes.Despite its age, still strongly recommended.",5,Brilliant adaptation,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,1227,"['BBC', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Iain', 'Banks', 'novel', 'Crow', 'Road', '1996', 'perfectly', 'attuned', 'spirit', 'book', 'doubt', 'many', 'changes', 'original', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'order', 'present', 'cinematographically', 'would', 'upset', 'even', 'most', 'ardent', 'fans', 'pace', 'start', 'out', 'little', 'slow', 'perhaps', 'large', 'well', 'handled', 'over', 'four', 'episode', 'span', 'more', 'gripping', 'last', 'Performances', 'large', 'are', 'good', 'strength', 'dialogue', 'making', 'up', 'hamminess', 'delivery', 'Needless', 'say', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'shines', 'role', 'missing', 'Uncle', 'Rory', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'actually', 'book', 'masterfully', 'added', 'dramatisation', 'screenwriter', 'Bryan', 'Elsley', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'Colin', 'Towns', 'characteristically', 'highly', 'evocative', 'annoyingly', 'are', 'couple', 'extras', 'disc', 'form', 'general', 'interview', 'Iain', 'Banks', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'first', 'episode', 'well', 'listen', 'interesting', 'insight', 'values', 'production', 'team', 'giving', 'away', 'surprises', 'later', 'episodes.Despite', 'age', 'still', 'strongly', 'recommended']",The Crow Road
