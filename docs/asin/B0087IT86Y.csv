1547578,AO4WFALWQYTW0,B0087IT86Y,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[36, 37]","Bernie is the new masterpiece by Richard Linklater. The fact that he could turn such a difficult premise to such a successful black comedy/drama is remarkable. This may be one of the greatest works on small-town America in this decade. Though Bernie may not have the breadth of a work like Fargo, it does magic in how it tells its story.Really, the most fascinating thing about Bernie is the way the story is told. Rather than give us a linear story, Bernie story is mostly retold by the residents of Carthage, TX who were witnessed to the gruesome events that occurred in this innocent town. This style can backfire gloriously if these characters are too animated, but Linklater strikes the right tone. With a Texan accent and some Southern innocence, these characters all suit the benefits the main story line. He seamlessly alternates between the world of the main characters and residents. This is very competent screenwriting as Linklater only uses his main characters when they are necessary, and allows the residents of Carthage to do the main storytelling. This is a welcome retreat from heavy-set narration of many Hollywood movies, especially some master filmmakers like Woody Allen.The movie is amazing because it centers on a murder that is hard to condemn like a CSI episode and the intent not dissimilar to Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. What makes the crime difficult to assess is that most of what the audience knows from Bernie is from the residents of Carthage, TX. We do not know Bernie as well as they do, and have to assume that their judgments are sound and not simplistic or based on a faade generated by Bernie himself. The film has been the subject of controversy by the way it portrays the murder, but if it were completely accurate to the conditions of the crime, the audience would not have such ambiguous feelings about the crime committed. In that case, Bernie would become another lunatic who murdered an innocent. What Linklater does is much more than that.",5,Possibly the greatest film on small-town America in this decade,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,1993,"['Bernie', 'new', 'masterpiece', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'fact', 'could', 'turn', 'such', 'difficult', 'premise', 'successful', 'black', 'comedy/drama', 'remarkable', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'works', 'small-town', 'America', 'decade', 'Bernie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'breadth', 'work', 'Fargo', 'magic', 'how', 'story.Really', 'most', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'Bernie', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'Rather', 'give', 'linear', 'story', 'Bernie', 'story', 'mostly', 'retold', 'residents', 'Carthage', 'TX', 'who', 'were', 'witnessed', 'gruesome', 'events', 'occurred', 'innocent', 'town', 'style', 'can', 'backfire', 'gloriously', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'animated', 'Linklater', 'strikes', 'right', 'tone', 'Texan', 'accent', 'Southern', 'innocence', 'characters', 'suit', 'benefits', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'seamlessly', 'world', 'main', 'characters', 'residents', 'very', 'competent', 'screenwriting', 'Linklater', 'only', 'main', 'characters', 'when', 'are', 'necessary', 'residents', 'Carthage', 'do', 'main', 'storytelling', 'welcome', 'retreat', 'heavy-set', 'narration', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'especially', 'master', 'filmmakers', 'Woody', 'Allen.The', 'movie', 'amazing', 'murder', 'hard', 'condemn', 'CSI', 'episode', 'intent', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'Dostoevsky', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'What', 'crime', 'difficult', 'assess', 'most', 'what', 'audience', 'Bernie', 'residents', 'Carthage', 'TX', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Bernie', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'have', 'assume', 'judgments', 'are', 'sound', 'not', 'simplistic', 'based', 'faade', 'generated', 'Bernie', 'film', 'been', 'subject', 'controversy', 'way', 'murder', 'were', 'completely', 'accurate', 'conditions', 'crime', 'audience', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'ambiguous', 'feelings', 'crime', 'committed', 'case', 'Bernie', 'would', 'become', 'lunatic', 'who', 'murdered', 'innocent', 'What', 'Linklater', 'much', 'more']",Bernie

1547582,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B0087IT86Y,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","I saw this movie for the first time last night. I knew it was based on a true story. What I didn't know was that Bernie, who was convicted of first-degree murder and faced a minimum of 50 years in prison, was recently released (two weeks ago as of this review) after serving approximately 18 years of his sentence, as new evidence came to light regarding his troubled childhood and the abusive relationship in which he found himself embroiled that resulted in his conviction. (I discovered this upon doing a bit of research after watching the movie.)So, why is this movie worth watching, seeing that the facts of the case are readily available online and there is little real suspense?First, the acting. Jack Black steps out of his normal roles and does a great job of portraying Bernie. Shirley MacLaine is equally outstanding in her role of the older widow with whom Bernie becomes involved.Second, I lived in a small town for a few years. This movie captures the mentality of small-town folks on a number of levels and provides a realistic picture of how and why a town can almost universally come to the defense of one of their own, even to the point of ignoring what seem to be obvious facts.Finally, while the lead roles are played by professional actors, the realism of &#34;Bernie&#34; is enhanced by interviews with residents of the town, a technique that allows us to gain further insight into the mindset of the local residents.",5,Justice is served,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,1439,"['saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'knew', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Bernie', 'who', 'was', 'convicted', 'first-degree', 'murder', 'faced', 'minimum', '50', 'years', 'prison', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'review', 'serving', 'approximately', '18', 'years', 'sentence', 'new', 'evidence', 'came', 'light', 'regarding', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'found', 'embroiled', 'resulted', 'conviction', 'discovered', 'upon', 'doing', 'bit', 'research', 'watching', 'movie', 'So', 'why', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'seeing', 'facts', 'case', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'online', 'little', 'real', 'suspense', 'First', 'acting', 'Jack', 'Black', 'normal', 'roles', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Bernie', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'equally', 'outstanding', 'role', 'older', 'widow', 'whom', 'Bernie', 'involved.Second', 'lived', 'small', 'town', 'few', 'years', 'movie', 'mentality', 'small-town', 'folks', 'number', 'levels', 'realistic', 'picture', 'how', 'why', 'town', 'can', 'almost', 'universally', 'come', 'defense', 'one', 'own', 'even', 'point', 'ignoring', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'obvious', 'facts.Finally', 'lead', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'professional', 'actors', 'realism', '34', 'Bernie', '34', 'enhanced', 'interviews', 'residents', 'town', 'technique', 'gain', 'further', 'insight', 'mindset', 'local', 'residents']",Bernie

1547584,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0087IT86Y,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Casting Jack Black in the title role of this 2012 dark comedy turns out to be a masterstroke on the part of director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater because the real-life character of Bernie Tiede is a comically ambiguous figure not only sexually but more to the point, as a jovial child-man personality beloved by his small Texas town of Carthage while at the same time, strangely insistent in his constant presence in their lives. His pointed need for universal acceptance and unconditional love is what makes Bernie unique as a screen creation. It takes Black's oddly discomfiting screen persona to make the character work as a protagonist of closeted complexity, and in turn, he delivers his most accomplished screen work to date. No stranger to Texas-size guffaws intermingled with wry observations about human nature, the versatile Linklater (Before Sunrise/Before Sunset) tells this hard-to-believe, true-crime story with both morbid humor and surprising conviction.Based on a comic 1998 Texas Monthly article by co-screenwriter Skip Hollandsworth, the plot revolves around the unlikely relationship between Bernie, a relentlessly thoughtful assistant funeral director, and Marjorie Nugent, recently widowed and one of the richest women in Carthage. As Bernie becomes indispensable to the fabric of the community with his acts of charitable kindness, his Broadway-style choir solos, and his gentlemanly way of comforting widows in the throes of their grief, the ever-scowling Marjorie is always ready for battle with not only the townsfolk who impede on her life but even her immediate family who can't stand her. Bernie, however, is able to breakthrough her icy veneer with his cheery persistence, and their relationship evolves into an unhealthy codependence to put it mildly. As Marjorie lavishes Bernie with expensive gifts and luxurious vacations, she grows increasingly manipulative in her need to control his every move to meet her every need.Even Bernie has his limits about what he is willing to do under her iron fist, and needless to say, consequences ensue. For all the dire consequences, Linklater keeps the mood buoyant with the insertion of intertitles to signal what question the movie will address next and with the brief interviews he includes with both actors and true residents of Carthage, all showing their unqualified support of Bernie through his burgeoning troubles. Much like Warren Beatty did inReds, Linklater uses them as a cumulative Greek chorus who on one hand, provide some of the film's biggest laughs, and on the other, illustrate just how myopic and oppressive a small town can be in its rumor mongering ways, so much so that Bernie's trial has to be moved fifty miles away in order to allow the light of objectivity to filter into the proceedings. As Bernie, Black finally has a multi-dimensional role that fits him perfectly, and I would be hard pressed to identify anyone else who could have played the character to the seriocomic depths he achieves here.Well into her seventh decade of movie stardom, Shirley MacLaine is not particularly challenged in portraying Marjorie's sourpuss nature since she's been playing variations on the same role since her turn as the ornery Ouisa inSteel Magnolias"". However, in one key scene, she lets loose all her insecurities that exposes the impenetrable cage in which she has put the increasingly desperate Bernie. Linklater favorite Matthew McConnaughey (Dazed and Confused) plays the showboating district attorney Danny Buck with gusto, although I wish he was reined in a bit more to provide more of a contrast to the other two principal actors. The movie is a fascinating meld of the Coen Brothers'Fargoand Hal Ashby'sHarold and Maudewith an unexpected dose of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries. While Linklater does not completely avoid making Carthage the object of ridicule, he has made a black comedy with surprising resonance when all is said and done, especially when you see the real Tiede in an archival video clip at the end.",4,Morbidly Seriocomic True-Crime Story Gives Black an Ideal Role for His Quirky Persona,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,4028,"['Casting', 'Jack', 'Black', 'title', 'role', '2012', 'dark', 'comedy', 'out', 'be', 'masterstroke', 'part', 'director', 'co-screenwriter', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'real-life', 'character', 'Bernie', 'Tiede', 'comically', 'ambiguous', 'figure', 'not', 'only', 'sexually', 'more', 'point', 'jovial', 'child-man', 'personality', 'beloved', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'Carthage', 'same', 'time', 'strangely', 'insistent', 'constant', 'presence', 'lives', 'pointed', 'need', 'universal', 'acceptance', 'unconditional', 'love', 'what', 'Bernie', 'unique', 'screen', 'creation', 'Black', 'oddly', 'discomfiting', 'screen', 'persona', 'make', 'character', 'work', 'protagonist', 'closeted', 'complexity', 'turn', 'most', 'accomplished', 'screen', 'work', 'date', 'No', 'stranger', 'Texas-size', 'guffaws', 'intermingled', 'wry', 'observations', 'human', 'nature', 'versatile', 'Linklater', 'Sunrise/Before', 'Sunset', 'hard-to-believe', 'true-crime', 'story', 'morbid', 'humor', 'surprising', 'conviction.Based', 'comic', '1998', 'Texas', 'Monthly', 'article', 'co-screenwriter', 'Skip', 'Hollandsworth', 'plot', 'unlikely', 'relationship', 'Bernie', 'relentlessly', 'thoughtful', 'assistant', 'funeral', 'director', 'Marjorie', 'Nugent', 'recently', 'widowed', 'one', 'richest', 'women', 'Carthage', 'Bernie', 'indispensable', 'fabric', 'community', 'acts', 'charitable', 'kindness', 'Broadway-style', 'choir', 'solos', 'gentlemanly', 'way', 'comforting', 'widows', 'throes', 'grief', 'ever-scowling', 'Marjorie', 'always', 'ready', 'battle', 'not', 'only', 'townsfolk', 'who', 'impede', 'life', 'even', 'immediate', 'family', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Bernie', 'however', 'able', 'breakthrough', 'icy', 'veneer', 'cheery', 'persistence', 'relationship', 'unhealthy', 'codependence', 'put', 'mildly', 'Marjorie', 'Bernie', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'luxurious', 'vacations', 'increasingly', 'manipulative', 'need', 'control', 'move', 'meet', 'need.Even', 'Bernie', 'limits', 'what', 'willing', 'do', 'iron', 'fist', 'needless', 'say', 'consequences', 'ensue', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Linklater', 'mood', 'buoyant', 'insertion', 'intertitles', 'signal', 'what', 'question', 'movie', 'will', 'address', 'next', 'brief', 'interviews', 'actors', 'true', 'residents', 'Carthage', 'showing', 'unqualified', 'support', 'Bernie', 'burgeoning', 'troubles', 'Much', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'did', 'inReds', 'Linklater', 'cumulative', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'who', 'one', 'hand', 'provide', 'film', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'other', 'illustrate', 'just', 'how', 'myopic', 'oppressive', 'small', 'town', 'can', 'be', 'rumor', 'mongering', 'ways', 'so', 'much', 'Bernie', 'trial', 'be', 'moved', 'fifty', 'miles', 'away', 'order', 'allow', 'light', 'objectivity', 'filter', 'proceedings', 'Bernie', 'Black', 'finally', 'multi-dimensional', 'role', 'perfectly', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'identify', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'character', 'seriocomic', 'depths', 'here.Well', 'seventh', 'decade', 'movie', 'stardom', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'not', 'particularly', 'challenged', 'portraying', 'Marjorie', 'sourpuss', 'nature', 'been', 'playing', 'variations', 'same', 'role', 'turn', 'ornery', 'Ouisa', 'inSteel', 'Magnolias', 'However', 'one', 'key', 'scene', 'loose', 'insecurities', 'impenetrable', 'cage', 'put', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'Bernie', 'Linklater', 'favorite', 'Matthew', 'McConnaughey', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'showboating', 'district', 'attorney', 'Danny', 'Buck', 'gusto', 'wish', 'was', 'reined', 'bit', 'more', 'provide', 'more', 'contrast', 'other', 'two', 'principal', 'actors', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'meld', 'Coen', ""Brothers'Fargoand"", 'Hal', ""Ashby'sHarold"", 'Maudewith', 'unexpected', 'dose', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'Linklater', 'not', 'completely', 'avoid', 'making', 'Carthage', 'object', 'ridicule', 'made', 'black', 'comedy', 'surprising', 'resonance', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'especially', 'when', 'see', 'real', 'Tiede', 'archival', 'video', 'clip', 'end']",Bernie

If you are just looking for a typical, by-the-numbers comedy, you should definitely search elsewhere. However, if you're prepared for something unusual, both in terms of content and the style of filming, then give this flick a chance.I'm a huge fan of Jack Black, so watching this movie was a no-brainer for me. Nonetheless, I was quite confused as to just what in the hell was going on for the first twenty minutes or so of ""Bernie"". Based on a true story, this movie is filmed halfway between the style of a documentary and that of a traditionally shot film, peppered with interviews with residents of the Texas town (Carthage) where the story occurred. It should be noted that these interviews with the locals are some of the absolute funniest parts of the movie, and they give you a true flavor of small town Texas life (or so we must presume- but it certainly seems authentic).What makes the movie most notable, however, is that it features some of the oddest performances ever by two heavy hitters of Hollywood- Jack Black and Matthew McConaughey. These guys really went way out their comfort zone for these roles (Black as funeral director Bernie, and McConaughey as DA Danny Buck). If you are a fan of either of these actors, and you possess an open mind, you should watch ""Bernie"" just to see how flexible they can be when assuming the role of an unlikely character. These guys are quite talented (and Black gets to use his impressive singing skills to belt out some gospel music, quite the departure from his usual heavy metal tunes with his band ""Tenacious D""). ""Bernie"" is not so funny that I would return to it for future viewings (as I would with my favorites), but I certainly feel it was worth seeing once, if for nothing else than to see Black and McConaughey embark upon these quirky roles so far removed from their general bodies of work.",4,"""Oh, he's an angel alright... an Angel of Death!""

Everyone loved and appreciated Bernie, so it came as no surprise when he befriended Marjorie Nugent, an affluent widow who was as well known for her sour attitude as her fortune. Bernie frequently traveled with Marjorie and even managed her banking affairs. Marjorie quickly became fully dependant on Bernie and his generosity and Bernie struggled to meet her increasing demands. Bernie continued to handle her affairs, and the townspeople went months without seeing Marjorie. The people of Carthage were shocked when it was reported that Marjorie Nugent had been dead for some time, and Bernie Tiede was being charged with the murder.The cast led by Jack Black (excellent as Bernie), Shirley MacLaine (as Marjorie) & Matthew McConaughey (as Danny Buck) is brilliant. The directing by Richard Linklater (who also co-wrote the screenplay and produced) is brilliant. The screenplay (which is based on the article In Texas Monthly by Skip Hollandsworth) by Linklater & Hollandsworth is brilliant.The music by Graham Reynolds is excellent. The cinematography by Dick Pope is excellent. The film editing by Sandra Adair is excellent. The production design by Bruce Curtis is excellent. The art direction by Rodney Becker, the set dressings by Chris Clayton & Melanie Ferguson is excellent. The costume design by Kari Perkins is excellent.This is an interesting and entertaining film that has a different feel to it, different with what most true-crime movies are like, a brilliant documentary-like feel to some of the scenes that are a very interesting part to the movie. This is also well-made and well-crafted, as well. Jack Black is excellent as Bernie Tiede (one of his best performances) and Shirley MacLaine & Matthew McConaughey are great in their parts of Marjorie & Danny Buck. This is also another brilliant Linklater film, as well. The teaming of Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey & Richard Linklater, working together for the first time in the same movie, not separately, as was the case of ""School Of Rock"" (Black / Linklater), ""Dazed & Confused"" (McConaughey / Linklater), ""The Newton Boys"" (McConaughey / Linklater) & ""Tropic Thunder"" (Black / McConaughey, although they did not share any scenes in the movie, as far as I can tell) is pure excellence and a long awaited pairing, in my mind, of the three of them together.

I LIKE Jack Black, but let's face it, a little Jack goes a loooooooong way.  For me, watching him is like watching Robin Williams doing comedy films - there is NO let up.  It's manic all the way.  He's just too exhausting to watch.However, in Bernie, Jack manages to keep his lid on and turn in an understated and sympathetic performance.  His portrayal of the real-life, good-hearted Carthage mortitician-turned-murderer is absolutely brilliant. He is completely believable, and as a result, makes brings Bernie Tiede to life for those of us non-Carthage, Texas dwellers. Everyone in the movie played it straight, letting the laughs come from the dialog and the whole preposterous situation.  It was just genius to use real Carthage citizens as a Greek chorus, moving the story along with the remarks, obvervations and memories.  Matthew McConaughey does a great job too.The one casting I didn't too much care for was that of Shirley MacLaine.  Don't get me wrong; I normally love Shirley MacLaine, but she's been playing the old female curmudgeon role for all it's worth since Steel Magnolias.  In fact, her take on her role of Marjorie in Bernie is just a one-dimensional reprise of Weezer.Nevertheless, this is an excellent, unique movie about real events in a small Texas town.  The events are so outlandish that this film would not have worked as fiction: the story is just too implausible.Most of all, this showed me what an excellent artist Jack Black is.  He is not the one-note like I thought he was.  His performance was perfect: restrained, believable and completely sympathetic. He was actually nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Bernie Tiede and I was sure rooting for him. I am now anxiously awaiting more great performances from Jack Black.In the meantime, I have Bernie - quirky, unique, hilarious, poignant, full of memorable characters and based in fact.",5,"You don't have to know Texas, but it sure doesn't hurt.",1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,1997,"['bought', 'film', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'hesitated', 'presence', 'Jack', 'Black', 'LIKE', 'Jack', 'Black', 'let', 'face', 'little', 'Jack', 'loooooooong', 'way', 'watching', 'watching', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'doing', 'comedy', 'films', 'let', 'up', 'manic', 'way', 'just', 'too', 'exhausting', 'watch.However', 'Bernie', 'Jack', 'keep', 'lid', 'turn', 'understated', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'portrayal', 'real-life', 'good-hearted', 'Carthage', 'mortitician-turned-murderer', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'completely', 'believable', 'result', 'brings', 'Bernie', 'Tiede', 'life', 'non-Carthage', 'Texas', 'dwellers', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'played', 'straight', 'letting', 'laughs', 'come', 'dialog', 'whole', 'preposterous', 'situation', 'was', 'just', 'genius', 'use', 'real', 'Carthage', 'citizens', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'moving', 'story', 'remarks', 'obvervations', 'memories', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'great', 'job', 'too.The', 'one', 'casting', 'did', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'care', 'was', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'normally', 'love', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'been', 'playing', 'old', 'female', 'curmudgeon', 'role', 'worth', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'fact', 'take', 'role', 'Marjorie', 'Bernie', 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'reprise', 'Weezer.Nevertheless', 'excellent', 'unique', 'movie', 'real', 'events', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'events', 'are', 'so', 'outlandish', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'fiction', 'story', 'just', 'too', 'implausible.Most', 'showed', 'what', 'excellent', 'artist', 'Jack', 'Black', 'not', 'one-note', 'thought', 'was', 'performance', 'was', 'perfect', 'restrained', 'believable', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'was', 'actually', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'portrayal', 'Bernie', 'Tiede', 'was', 'sure', 'rooting', 'am', 'now', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'more', 'great', 'performances', 'Jack', 'Black.In', 'meantime', 'have', 'Bernie', 'quirky', 'unique', 'hilarious', 'poignant', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters', 'based', 'fact']",Bernie
1547610,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B0087IT86Y,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[3, 4]","The offbeat docu-drama style of this movie created a lot of great funny moments - mostly in the interviews with 'real- life' individuals involved - but overall it just missed the mark for me. It dragged in parts, and the fact that you pretty much know where it is headed from the first few minutes of the film leaves you nothing to enjoy but the quips and performances. And while both Shirley MacLaine and Jack Black do fine, I didn't feel their performances were as good as many have said. Jack Black in particular just couldn't help mugging it up a bit in parts, and that left me mistrustful of his character, which undermined the sympathetic tone the movie overall seemed to take to Bernie.Just to cover the basics, in case you don't already know, this movie is based on the real-life murder of elderly ornery widow Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) by Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) in the small town of Carthage Texas. Bernie was a local legend, a quirky but beloved town member who was active and generous in his church and community. He befriended Marjorie after her husband died, eventually becoming so indispensable to her life that he went to her house daily to help her with meals, and traveled around the world with her. Marjorie was not well-liked, and upon the discovery of her death and Bernie's confession to her murder, much of the town rallied to his defense (this isn't a spoiler, most of this is laid out in the first few minutes of the film.)The film is told in a docu-drama style through a combination of interviews with real-life members of the Carthage community and the actors in character, as well as actual scenes played out. The funniest moments in the film really come from these interviews, and the colorful anecdotes and phrases used to describe both Marjorie and Bernie, and their reactions to the events that transpired. The scenes between Bernie and Marjorie just didn't always work for me, for the reasons I described above. I didn't feel their chemistry, so the evolution of their relationship just never really made sense.So overall, a film that delivers some great funny moments, but just missed the mark overall for me.",3,"Great OffBeat Format and Humor, But Missed the Mark for Me",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2154,"['offbeat', 'docu-drama', 'style', 'movie', 'created', 'lot', 'great', 'funny', 'moments', 'mostly', 'interviews', ""'real-"", 'life', 'individuals', 'involved', 'overall', 'just', 'missed', 'mark', 'dragged', 'parts', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'where', 'headed', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'nothing', 'enjoy', 'quips', 'performances', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Jack', 'Black', 'do', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'performances', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'Jack', 'Black', 'particular', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'mugging', 'up', 'bit', 'parts', 'left', 'mistrustful', 'character', 'undermined', 'sympathetic', 'tone', 'movie', 'overall', 'seemed', 'take', 'Bernie.Just', 'cover', 'basics', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'movie', 'based', 'real-life', 'murder', 'elderly', 'ornery', 'widow', 'Marjorie', 'Nugent', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Bernie', 'Tiede', 'Jack', 'Black', 'small', 'town', 'Carthage', 'Texas', 'Bernie', 'was', 'local', 'legend', 'quirky', 'beloved', 'town', 'member', 'who', 'was', 'active', 'generous', 'church', 'community', 'befriended', 'Marjorie', 'husband', 'died', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'so', 'indispensable', 'life', 'went', 'house', 'daily', 'help', 'meals', 'traveled', 'world', 'Marjorie', 'was', 'not', 'well-liked', 'discovery', 'death', 'Bernie', 'confession', 'murder', 'much', 'town', 'rallied', 'defense', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'most', 'laid', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'film', 'told', 'docu-drama', 'style', 'combination', 'interviews', 'real-life', 'members', 'Carthage', 'community', 'actors', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'actual', 'scenes', 'played', 'out', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'really', 'come', 'interviews', 'colorful', 'anecdotes', 'phrases', 'used', 'describe', 'Marjorie', 'Bernie', 'reactions', 'events', 'transpired', 'scenes', 'Bernie', 'Marjorie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'reasons', 'described', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'chemistry', 'evolution', 'relationship', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'sense.So', 'overall', 'film', 'great', 'funny', 'moments', 'just', 'missed', 'mark', 'overall']",Bernie

Unfortunately, nearly every review gives away a key detail of the plot -- usually in the first sentence -- and so although the movie wasn't ruined (hardly), I know that it lacked as much impact as it could have provided. I know this because I watched it with two people from whom I had deliberately withheld the key detail, and their response to the film -- although just as deeply pleased as mine -- had a far sharper edge of interest. They had been waiting to see what might happen. I was waiting for what I knew would happen.If this is the only review of the film you read, then read none others, because you should go in fresh. I will tell you this much: the film is a cross between a mockumentary and an homage to the true tale of a personable mortician/funeral director named Bernie. A Methodist with a tender voice and a precise sort of careful charm, Bernie's affable and off-beat ways woo most of the citizens of the town of Carthage, Texas, including its most notable curmudgeon, an older woman named Marjorie Nugent, known as much for her wealth as for her sweet-as-a-porcupine demeanor. The unlikely friendship that blossoms between those two -- as well as its ultimate dissolution and effect on the town -- provides the heart of this absorbing, beautifully acted crime drama/dark comedy.The movie's action is interspersed with interviews from citizens of the town, all of whom are so rich in character and colloquialisms that my friends and I could not decide if they were actors or the real deal. It turns out that they are, indeed, real citizens from the town, people who really knew Bernie, and this just adds to the film's sweetly sad charm. Driving the whole thing, however, is the seamlessly stunning performance of Jack Black, who inhabits the titular character with a quietly accomplished gravitas. One part funny, one part dark, and two parts grim philosophical inquiry, this movie resonates on enough levels to belie its own rich veins of humor and pathos.

It tells the true story, so strange nobody could have made it up, of Bernie Tiede, a kindly assistant funeral director in Carthage, TX. Bernie befriends Marjorie Nugent, the richest, meanest widow in town, then becomes her heir, murders her with four shots in the back from an armadillo gun, and hides her body in her deep freeze under some Marie Callender pot pies. Mrs. Nugent's family and community miss her so little that nobody even looks for her for almost nine months.Jack Black gives his most subtle, nuanced performance to date as the endearing, ""light-in-the-loafers"" Bernie. Shirley MacLaine has almost no dialogue but creates an indelible Mrs. Nugent with her eyes, her gestures, the way she holds her face and body--even the way she chews her food. Matthew McConaughey plays Carthage's hard-pressed prosecuting attorney Danny Buck Davidson, who must uphold the law in the face of community outrage. Danny Buck asks to have Bernie's trial  moved two counties away because Carthage so loves Bernie, and so reviled Mrs. Nugent, that Danny Buck doesn't think he can get a conviction in Carthage even though Bernie confessed. Neighbors keep asking Danny Buck if he can't find some extenuating circumstances that can help good old Bernie.Based on a piece in the Texas Monthly by co-screenwriter Skip Hollandsworth, ""Bernie"" unfolds mostly in flashbacks and via interviews with Carthage gossips. Many of the townspeople depicted are actual Carthage residents who remember Bernie, Mrs. Nugent, and the murder. I can think of no movie richer in local color and character. The accents, expressions and community businesses remind us that we still have regional cultures in the United States.  When civic-minded Bernie wants to invest in ""a Neiman-Marcus for Carthage,"" the man he backs opens a store called ""Boot Scootin' Western Wear.""

But ""Bernie"" is a true story, even featuring some of the townspeople of Carthage, Texas, who knew Bernie Tiede and his victim Marjorie Nugent. An assistant funeral director in Carthage, Bernie (Jack Black) is an infinitely kind, infinitely generous man who's the friend of everyone in town. But everyone in town is dumbfounded when Bernie manages to win the good opinion of Marjorie (Shirley MacLaine), a sour, bossy, but very wealthy harridan who doesn't have a good opinion of anyone except Marjorie.Bernie quits his undertaker's job and becomes personal assistant to Marjorie, who disinherits her unloved and unlovable children in favor of Bernie. One day Marjorie stops showing up in town. Bernie tells the townspeople that Marjorie is ill and in a nursing home. No one cares about Marjorie, so no one checks up on her. Bernie continues to live his same frugal lifestyle, though the surprise gifts he's always loved to give people get bigger and more expensive. Ten months go by. Then the police show up at Marjorie's house and open the freezer in her garage...Director Richard Linklater co-wrote the screenplay with Skip Hollandsworth, who wrote the Texas Monthly article on which the story is based. The film works brilliantly, not only as a true-crime story but as one of the most insightful depictions of small-town life ever put on screen. Some people might not cotton to the film's dry-as-the-Dust-Bowl sense of humor, but everyone will love Jack Black as Bernie, giving by far the best performance of his career. It's a performance that richly deserves an Oscar nomination, but it probably won't get one because the film wasn't a hit and was released too early in the year.Black dominates the movie, but MacLaine skillfully underscores Marjorie's nastiness merely by the way she chews her re-fried beans, like a spiteful cow. Matthew McConaughey gives a live-wire performance as the prosecutor who brings Bernie to justice; it's a performance he's given before, but nobody does it better.

1547619,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0087IT86Y,mirasreviews,"[5, 5]","""Bernie"" was conceived and directed by Richard Linklater based on an article in ""Texas Monthly"" magazine by Skip Hollandsworth, who co-wrote the film, about the 1996 murder of an 81-year-old widow by her younger male companion. The story is an interesting departure from a classic ""homme fatal"" scenario in that so many townspeople of Carthage, Texas, where the murder took place, tended to side with the murderer. ""Bernie"" is a genre-bending black comedy character study told primarily through fictionalized interviews with ordinary folk. It's Jack Black's best work onscreen by far. Black always comes up short in dramatic roles. He is good in comedic parts, but he's never done anything unexpected. Black has found his calling in convicted murderer Bernie Tiede.Bernie Tiede's (Jack Black) life in Carthage, Texas began when he answered an ad from a funeral home for a mortician. Bernie quickly earned the respect of his employer and the townspeople with his meticulous, thoughtful attention to the town's deceased and generosity toward their families. He meets Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) at  her husband's funeral. As always, Bernie follows up with flowers and condolences for the widow. Marjorie keeps to herself and is generally detested by the community for her hateful, abusive manner. But eventually, Bernie's kindness wins her over, and the pair become fast companions. Marjorie enjoys travel and she takes Bernie globetrotting in high style. But she is still controlling and sadistic, and Bernie has become dependent on her.""Bernie"" is told entirely in flashback, because it is told through a series of interviews, interspersed throughout the film, with the people of Carthage, played by actors, as they recall the events that led to tragedy. Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson (Matthew McConaughey) also recalls his case against Bernie Tiede. The scenes play out as people recall the people and events in them. It's not usually clear if the townspeople in the film are supposed to represent specific real people or not, but one of the most memorable townspeople is played by Matthew McConaughey's mother Kay.

Bernie is the most likeable guy you'll ever meet. He is involved in the community like no-one else before, and the small town just things the world of him.

Several comments: I didn't realize until the credits rolled that (i) this is based on true mid-90s events in Carthage, and (ii) the movie intersects with interviews from people from Carthage, which it turned out are not actors but the actual folks from Chartage who witnessed the whole thing.I must mention the excellent work from Jack Black as Bernie (has he ever been better than in this movie?), but even more so the eye-popping performance by Shirley McLaine as Marjorie, which really blew me away. Matthew McConaughey certainly deserves an honorable mention in his role as the local District Attorney, MILES away from his usual stuff.

Back in 1996 a geriatric member of the Carthage elite was shot by Bernie Tiede in a fit of rage and frustration and an apparent sense of helplessness.  While this sounds like the recipe for a television procedural Black plays the Bernie character with grand pomposity, sensitivity and downright brilliance.  Channeling his inner Nathan Lane, Black's ""Bernie"" is an absolute stitch, with the plot punctuated by the caustic and perceptive observations of the real folks from Carthage who knew the principals involved.  The accents, the stories, the spontaneous reactions of the townsfolk- as told to an unseen interviewer are so typically Texas and funny, while giving us keen insight into the players involved.Incredibly enough, the plot and story line loses steam as soon as Bernie offs Mrs. Nugent (played constipatingly by the wonderful Shirley MacLaine).  Unfortunately the drama associated with Mrs. Nugent's murder syphons the life out of the story as well, with the townsfolk interviews taking a back seat.

That's what makes it especially good since it's told from an ordinary person's point of view in a small town.  Bernie is well know as an assistant funeral director in the small town of Carthage, Texas. He is talented, being a great singer of hymns and performing and directing local musicals.  He also has a way not only with the deceased but with their bereaved spouses, mostly elderly women.  He brings them flowers and soaps and other goodies as a follow up after the funeral.  Everybody loves Bernie!  Especially the hard nosed, difficult, mean spirited Marjorie Nugent, whose family doesn't even like her!  Nevermind, Bernie is on the scene and soon charms the socks off of her and before long they are off to Russia, Paris, cruises, and first class all the way!  Sounds like a dream life for Bernie, right?  Wrong.  Marjorie not only has annoying habits, like chewing her food two hundred times, but she is very demanding, and Bernie becomes her chief cook, bottle washer, valet, financial advisor, chauffeur, you name it.  She also changes her will to leave him her fortune. We all predict what happens next as Bernie loses it and the inevitable happens, but no one is aware of this for while.  The trial goes forward and the prosecutor is guess who, Danny Buck Davidson, played by hunky Matthew McConaghey. Of course, this is not going to be a fair trial because nobody in this small town will give a guilty verdict to Bernie.  So this goes on and the ending is kind of predictable but how it all gets there is amusing to say the least.  No one liked Marjorie and if someone killed her they did the town a service according to the folks that live there.

What is unfortunate is that the DVD cover write up assumes that you are familiar with the story and explains the entire plot. Bernie (Jack Black) is a nice guy who hangs wallpaper, does tax returns, directs the choir, directs plays, does needlepoint and makes curtains. He is also the town's assistant funeral director...one that doesn't hang out with girls.Bernie befriends Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) a rich mean woman hated by the town and her own family. The movie is done similar to ""Broadway Danny Rose"" in that part of it is a mock docu-drama with some funny locals. Jack Black does not come across as someone from East Texas. I doubted the sincerity of Bernie because they tried to make him a little too cute and humorous. That said, it did make the film more entertaining which is what counts in the long run.There were very few laugh out loud moments, but many moments that made me smile. The trial at the end of the film was far too short and a missed opportunity for some comedic moments. The film is witty and entertaining.

We know what happens and how, but the titular character Bernie remains a mystery. Who is he after all? What did he want?  The film does not explain the inner psychological complexities (if there are at all) of the person about whom everyone in the small town talks about in amusing interview sections of actual Carthage residents. After all no one knows for sure.And that is exactly the point.

She gives just the right of crankiness to her mean, old lady character without going over the top.  Another reviewer complained that the residents of Carthage Texas were stereotypes.  I did not find that to be the case.  One of the chief attractions of this story is the use of real citizens to tell the story.  They are not portrayed as  dumb hicks.  Nor are they shown as gun toting blood thirsty people who want to fry criminals in the electric chair.  I do not want to give away any of the scenes or ruin the plot of this story for anyone so I will just tell you to watch and judge for yourself.
