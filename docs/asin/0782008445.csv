41229,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0782008445,Alex Udvary,"[4, 5]","""The Devil & Miss Jones"" is an enjoyable, charming, funny 1940s comedy directed by Sam Wood starring one of my favorite actresses Jean Arthur.It's odd that Sam Wood would be a part of this film. ""The Devil and Miss Jones"" has a lot of leftist ideas. Workers fighting back against big business. Unions. But Sam Wood was a Republican and actually named names to the House of UnAmerican Activities. The funny connection here is that Wood was pretending to be something he wasn't. I'm sure if Wood had told the studio I'm not directing this movie, they would let him walk off, and probably fire him after. That's the way the studios worked back then, but, Charles Coburn who playes J.P. Merrick is also pretending to be something he's not; a worker. A man who can relate to the working class.Now of course a lot of people are probably not thinking about this because who really goes through the trouble to figure out the politics of a film's director? But it is something to think about when you watch this movie.""The Devil and Miss Jones"" is about J.P. Merrick (Charles Coburn) who owns a store where the workers are starting to revolt. They demand a union where they we be given security. Merrick of course is against this idea and after an ad in the paper bringing the issue to the public Merrick decides he needs to send a detective in to find out who is the leader, but Merrick decides to do it himself. There he meets a group of characters whom meet him with different reactions. First is Miss Jones (Arthur) a kind hearted co-worker who gives Merrick some lunch money. Then there is Hooper, (Edmund Gwenn) the floor manager, who takes an instant dislike to Merrick and he to him. And finally there is Elizabeth (Spring Byington) another co-worker who develops a crush on Merrick. All of these people take Merrick into their confidence and Merrick thinks he will soon find out who the troublemaker is. But there are a lot of funny scenes that take place before that happens.You can probably guess where the movie is going to go. Will Merrick report the leader, who turns out to be Joe (Robert Cummings) as in ""average Joe"". Will Merrick have a change of heart and see things from the workers point of view? And will Merrick fall in love with Elizabeth?But thats all besides the point. Here is a wonderful old-fashion comedy that should please film buffs greatly. It has a good cast, some funny lines and was even nominated for 2 Oscars; ""Best Supporting Actor (Coburn)"" and ""Best Original Screenplay (Norma Krasna)"". And to top it all off it has Jean Arthur.S.Z. Sakall also co-stars as Coburn's butler. And William Demarest, perhaps best known for appearing in several Preston Sturges comedies has a brief role as a detective.Bottom-line: Entertaining comedy that has some leftist views but it shouldn't upset anyone with its ideas. Mostly some good old-fashion fun. You know, it's one of those movies they don't make anymore.",4,"Can't Beat ""The Devil""",1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,2929,"['Devil', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'enjoyable', 'charming', 'funny', '1940s', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'starring', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Jean', 'Arthur.It', 'odd', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'would', 'be', 'part', 'film', 'Devil', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'lot', 'leftist', 'ideas', 'Workers', 'fighting', 'back', 'big', 'business', 'Unions', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'was', 'Republican', 'actually', 'named', 'names', 'House', 'UnAmerican', 'Activities', 'funny', 'connection', 'here', 'Wood', 'was', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'sure', 'Wood', 'had', 'told', 'studio', ""'m"", 'not', 'directing', 'movie', 'would', 'let', 'walk', 'probably', 'fire', 'way', 'studios', 'worked', 'back', 'then', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'who', 'playes', 'J.P.', 'Merrick', 'also', 'pretending', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'worker', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'working', 'class.Now', 'course', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'thinking', 'who', 'really', 'trouble', 'figure', 'out', 'politics', 'film', 'director', 'something', 'think', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'Devil', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'J.P.', 'Merrick', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'who', 'store', 'where', 'workers', 'are', 'starting', 'revolt', 'demand', 'union', 'where', 'be', 'given', 'security', 'Merrick', 'course', 'idea', 'ad', 'paper', 'bringing', 'issue', 'public', 'Merrick', 'send', 'detective', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'leader', 'Merrick', 'do', 'group', 'characters', 'whom', 'meet', 'different', 'reactions', 'First', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'Arthur', 'kind', 'hearted', 'co-worker', 'who', 'Merrick', 'lunch', 'money', 'Then', 'Hooper', 'Edmund', 'Gwenn', 'floor', 'manager', 'who', 'instant', 'dislike', 'Merrick', 'finally', 'Elizabeth', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'co-worker', 'who', 'crush', 'Merrick', 'people', 'take', 'Merrick', 'confidence', 'Merrick', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'troublemaker', 'are', 'lot', 'funny', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'happens.You', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'go', 'Will', 'Merrick', 'report', 'leader', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Joe', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'average', 'Joe', 'Will', 'Merrick', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'see', 'things', 'workers', 'point', 'view', 'will', 'Merrick', 'fall', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'point', 'Here', 'wonderful', 'old-fashion', 'comedy', 'should', 'please', 'film', 'buffs', 'greatly', 'good', 'cast', 'funny', 'lines', 'was', 'even', 'nominated', '2', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Coburn', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Norma', 'Krasna', 'top', 'Jean', 'Arthur.S.Z', 'Sakall', 'also', 'Coburn', 'butler', 'William', 'Demarest', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'appearing', 'several', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'comedies', 'brief', 'role', 'detective.Bottom-line', 'Entertaining', 'comedy', 'leftist', 'views', 'should', ""n't"", 'upset', 'anyone', 'ideas', 'Mostly', 'good', 'old-fashion', 'fun', 'know', 'one', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore']",N/A

41232,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,0782008445,Bobby Underwood,"[3, 3]","""You're just one person against the world unless you've got someone."" -- Jean ArthurJean Arthur and Charles Coburn shine in this underrated RKO classic. Perhaps because it isn't zany enough to fall into the true screwball category this warm and charming comedy often gets overlooked when the genre is spoken about. Sam Wood's direction, sets by William Cameron Menzies, a nice score from Roy Webb, and Norman Krasna's funny screenplay all add up to a good time for classic film lovers.Charles Coburn is simply adorable as the maligned millionaire who goes undercover in a department store he didn't even know he owned until employees burned a life size dummy of him in effigy which makes the papers. Getting hired on as Tom Higgens so he can root out the people behind it doesn't have quite the outcome he'd intended. Immediately befriended by Mary (Jean Arthur) in the shoe department who loans him 50 cents for lunch because she thinks he's broke, his purpose becomes less clear with each passing day.You'll find yourself chuckling as Merrick (Coburn) begins to take down names of management rather than employees in his ""doomsday book"" for what he experiences. What he also begins to experience is living, finding a friend in the sweet Mary and romance with her pal Elizabeth (Spring Byington). Robert Cummings is delightful as Mary's boyfriend, Joe O'Brien, who also happens to be the idealistic voice behind those workers revolting! S.S. Sakall is also endearing as Merrick's valet.There are some fun scenes on the boardwalk and a mix-up which nearly lands them all in jail until Joe does some fast talking. Arthur never seemed more vulnerable than in a sweet scene on the beach where it is she who asks Joe to marry her, and gets turned down because he doesn't want to disappoint her. As Merrick gets more and more involved in his undercover life, and further from his real one, he begins to look at his wealth as something of a handicap!A great ending which will make you glad you watched this one push a good film over the top into the 5 star range. Don't miss Coburn's fight with a young brat he's hired to make him look good.

It's a movie I can honestly consider ""perfect"", filled with comedy of mistaken identity and new situations, helped by outstandingly clever writing, and imbued with patriotism.  It's not a goofy movie like many ""screwball comedies"", but instead has more well-rounded human qualities.  Screwball comedies can be good (I really like the original, It Happened One Night), but I think their breezy style and one-dimensional supporting characters would have cheapened this movie.

Merrick, the wealthy, sinister millionaire and owner of his own department store, where the overworked and underpayed workers, led by Joe O'Brien (Robert Cummings) are protesting. In order to eliminate all the ringleaders of the employee protest movement, Merrick, who's face isn't known by any of the employees, changes his name to Tom Higgins and becomes an employee in his own department store. While working in the dreaded shoe department, Higgins meets the charming Mary Jones (Jean Arthur), who takes pity on Higgins and befriends him, not knowing that he's her evil boss.Higgins, when not gathering the names of protesters in his organization, also falls for one of his ""co-workers"", Elizabeth Ellis (Spring Byington). Higgins is faced with a problem however, when he discovers that Mary Jones' boyfriend is none other than Joe O'Brien. Yet over time Higgins' unlikely friendship with these people makes him forget about his sinister original plan and he becomes a new man who cares for his employees.Now that the equally great comedy with Charles Coburn and Jean Arthur, ""The More the Merrier"", has been released on dvd, why can't this underated classic get a dvd release? Sure, some of the dialogue is dated and corny, but that's just part of the charm with an old-fashioned comedy like ""The Devil and Miss Jones"". Jean Arthur was terrific and absolutly charming as usual, but Charles Coburn really stole the show with his great performance. Charles Coburn was an incredible actor who could play very likable characters, or the worst of villians, as in ""Kings Row"". Robert Cummings was good in this as well, although his speech at the police station was vomit-inducing.

This is a fanciful smart comedy made for the masses who were recovering from the aftermath of the Great Depression.  It is subtly subversive in a way because it concerns a group of department store workers rebelling against their faceless ownership represented by Charles Coburn as a tycoon who wasn't even aware that the store was part of his holdings.  I found it interesting that the organizing workers never say the word union probably because the makers of the film probably thought they would be accused of Bolshevism.  Jean Arthur is as reliable and winning as ever as the salesgirl with a heart of gold struggling to make ends meet.  Of all the leading ladies of that era I always found Arthur to be the most accessible and down-to-earth.  She's not so much the girl next door but the woman next door.  Coburn also hits a bulls eye as the curmudgeonly tycoon who as the film evolves discovers the heart he unconsciously buried a long time ago.

It's so perfect that it's difficult to really describe the effect it had on me.The plot of the film tells the story of what happens when a millionaire (Coburn), who among many, many assets, owns a Department Store in New York, arranges to be infiltrated into the Store as a simple Shoes (more precisely ""Slipper"") Salesman, in order to investigate who, among its employees, participated as agitators and were responsible for the hanging of his effigy, when protesting against the Store's policies regarding workers, working conditions and Unions.Among the employees of the Store, Coburn meets fellow Shoes Saleslady, Jean Arthur, who befriends him, not only believing he's an employee, but also a poor, almost destitute old man.Coburn is delightful as the millionaire; I'd dare to say that it's his best role ever, along with the one he played in ""The More the Merrier"". Jean Arthur plays much more a ""human"" character than a plain-comedic one and Bob Cummings is also very good as her boyfriend and the main ""agitator"", getting to play together a couple of very believable love scenes.An excellent supporting cast includes among others, Spring Byington as Arthur's sweet friend and co-worker, Edmund Gwenn as the rather nasty Head of the Shoe Department and S.Z. Sakall as Coburn's butler.Kudos to Norman Krasna for his excellent screenplay and for the handling of social issues regarding Labour, which are timeless and still very pertinent.This film ought to be on DVD.",5,A Classic,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,2060,"['Classic', 'Film', 'couples', 'are', 'Garbo', 'Gilbert', 'Gable', 'Crawford', 'Tracy', 'Hepburn', 'have', 'discovered', 'also', 'Arthur', 'Coburn', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'most', 'engaging.Two', 'films', 'More', 'Merrier', 'one', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'now', 'Devil', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'are', 'testimony', 'great', 'chemistry', 'rapport', 'existed', 'two', 'great', 'comedians', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Charles', 'Coburn.Last', 'night', 'watched', 'wonderful', 'Comedy', 'first', 'time', 'believe', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Comedy', 'quality', 'class', 'long', 'time', 'so', 'perfect', 'difficult', 'really', 'describe', 'effect', 'had', 'me.The', 'plot', 'film', 'story', 'what', 'when', 'millionaire', 'Coburn', 'who', 'many', 'many', 'assets', 'Department', 'Store', 'New', 'York', 'be', 'infiltrated', 'Store', 'simple', 'Shoes', 'more', 'precisely', 'Slipper', 'Salesman', 'order', 'investigate', 'who', 'employees', 'participated', 'agitators', 'were', 'responsible', 'hanging', 'effigy', 'when', 'protesting', 'Store', 'policies', 'regarding', 'workers', 'working', 'conditions', 'Unions.Among', 'employees', 'Store', 'Coburn', 'fellow', 'Shoes', 'Saleslady', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'believing', 'employee', 'also', 'poor', 'almost', 'destitute', 'old', 'man.Coburn', 'delightful', 'millionaire', ""'d"", 'dare', 'say', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'one', 'played', 'More', 'Merrier', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'character', 'plain-comedic', 'one', 'Bob', 'Cummings', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'boyfriend', 'main', 'agitator', 'getting', 'play', 'together', 'couple', 'very', 'believable', 'love', 'scenes.An', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'others', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'Arthur', 'sweet', 'friend', 'co-worker', 'Edmund', 'Gwenn', 'rather', 'nasty', 'Head', 'Shoe', 'Department', 'S.Z', 'Sakall', 'Coburn', 'butler.Kudos', 'Norman', 'Krasna', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'handling', 'social', 'issues', 'regarding', 'Labour', 'are', 'timeless', 'still', 'very', 'pertinent.This', 'film', 'ought', 'be', 'DVD']",N/A

She is a too good to be true store clerk at a major New York department store, in this surprisingly good comedy with a political point of view. Charles Coburn in a performance worthy of an academy award nomination plays JP Merrick. He is the wealthiest man in the world & this department store is a  tiny  piece of his portfolio. A picture of him hasn't been seen for years & he's rather reclusive. But some employees hate him & are agitating for change. He decides to go undercover & find out who is responsible for the rebellion & crush them. He gets a job as a shoe clerk & is soon befuddled & in trouble with his supervisor who views him as an old incompetant. He's befriended by Mary who feels sorry for him. He has even forgot to bring money for lunch.He is invited to a secret meeting of the store employees who want some changes from the working conditions & low wages they endure. The ringleader is Mary's boyfriend, Joe played by Robert Cummings in a somtimes over the top performance. He  basically bitches about everything rebels against anything. He also becomes friends with Merrick as does Elizabeth (Spring Byington) with whom he develops a romance. Merrick is not a devil, he just was ignorant of the employees modest demands, a little respect & appreciation for their hard work.

41247,A37MH7ICH80QOX,0782008445,Kate McMurry,"[2, 2]","Fifty-five-year-old tycoon, John P. Merrick (played by Charles Coburn, who was 63 at the time and looked much older than his character's age), owns among his many holdings a department store in New York City bearing his name. The store is enormous with close to a thousand employees. He is shocked and filled with righteous indignation when he learns he has been hung in effigy by rabble-rousers and that there is movement afoot among his employees to form a union. Merrick hires a private investigator to snoop in the store and ferret out the traitorous employees involved, but the PI claims he can't start work for a few days. Impatient with the delay, Merrick impulsively decides to take on the false persona of a man named Tom that the PI had planned to use and do his own spying himself.Merrick as Tom is placed in one of the lowliest jobs in the store, selling house slippers in the shoe department. The shoe-section manager, Hooper (played by Edmund Gwenn, who won an Academy Award for his role inMiracle on 34th Street, 1947), is an officious jerk, and Merrick is so offended, he does a lousy job of acting humble. Hooper assigns an experienced shoe clerk named Mary Jones (Jean Arthur, the queen of screwball comedy, was age 40 at the time and looked much younger) to train Tom. In the process, Mary befriends him and introduces him to her friend and fellow shoe clerk, Elizabeth Ellis (Spring Byington, who was 55 at the time, but also looked much younger than her age). Both Mary and Elizabeth soon become convinced that the man they know as Tom has had a very hard life with unsympathetic employers who have dumped him after years of loyal service, and they take him under their wing. Mary loans him fifty cents and Elizabeth feeds him her lunch.Soon after Mary brings her new friend Tom to a secret union-organizing meeting, where she introduces him to her boyfriend Joe O'Brien (Robert Cummings, best known for theLove That Bob1950's TV series; he was only 31 years old at the time of this film, and he looks very young and fresh). Joe is a recently fired employee of the store and has convinced 400 employees to agree to form a union, but he is not impressed with his results because he states that this is only a small fraction of the total employees.Merrick finds himself in possession of all the information he needs to take down the people he previously saw as enemies, but it is increasingly difficult for him to keep thinking of them in those terms because Elizabeth and Mary--and even fiery Joe--are quickly proving themselves to be the best friends he's ever had.This is the first of three movies that Charles Coburn and Jean Arthur made together. The other two were both set contemporaneously with World War II themes, including a 1943 romantic, screwball comedy,The More the Merrier, and the 1944 dramedy,The Impatient Years.A familiar face in this film is the wonderful character actor, S.Z. Sakall, as George, Merrick's butler. My favorite film with him in a major supporting role is as Felix Bassenak inChristmas in Connecticut from 1945. His part in this film is much more subdued than his usually far more colorful roles as the local eccentric from Budapest (which is where he was actually born).Charles Coburn was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for this film, and screenwriter Norman Krasna was nominated for Best Original Screenplay. This film was made by a short-lived independent production company consisting of Krasna and Jean Arthur's husband, producer Frank Ross. It's too bad they didn't make more films, because this one was a big box-office success.I find it historically fascinating that the director of this film, Sam Wood, had a reputation in Hollywood as a political conservative, and he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, a few years after this film was made. In spite of that perspective, he was willing to direct this particular film, which clearly takes the ""liberal"" political view, presenting downtrodden workers as very much in need of forming unions in order to protect themselves from the harm callously caused by their distant and uninvolved, ultra-rich employer.If you like Charles Coburn, you will enjoy this film. I'm surprised he was labeled as a ""supporting actor,"" because he is center stage far more often than Jean Arther or Robert Cummings, though they got top billing. Merrick's incognito life among his employees rather reminds me of an aging King Arthur (played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke) going out among his subjects disguised as a peasant in order to see what their lives were like in the comic, historical, time-travel movie,A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court from 1949.Jean Arthur is her usual perky, sweet, adorable self in this film. I've watched almost all of her movies from the 1930's and 1940's. I would not rate this as one of her very best roles by a long shot--I like her far more in spunky roles rather than sweet, good-girl roles like this one, but she's always worth watching, and she does have at least one scene in this film when she gets to show a bit of snap.I'm a big fan of Bob Cummings, though his role in this movie, in spite of his overall fame as a very talented comic actor, is not particularly humorous in and of itself. However, he remains very watchable, and he does an excellent job with the ""dramady,"" that is, the mix of drama and comedy, that is the tone of this film.It is always a joy to watch any film with Spring Byington, a consummate character actress who was ageless on the screen. I most remember her as Doris Day's mother inPlease Don't Eat the Daisies from 1960. Like Jean Arthur, I much prefer the roles in which Spring Byington is allowed to display some spunk and backbone. In this particular film, she is merely a sweet, gentle, kindly woman who is very nurturing.There are a couple of romances in this film, but they are definitely subplots, as the major focus is the fish-out-of-water plot.As all films of this era, this one is G-Rated by today's standards. One pleasant, and very unusually for the era, aspect of this film is that no one smokes! Almost unheard of. There is only one scene where anyone drinks alcohol, and no one gets drunk. That's something else that is almost always found in any comic movie, drunkenness used for humor, and it is a refreshing change to see that trope avoided.",5,"Fun, trading-places, working-man

41252,AD2BIAIH78QI5,0782008445,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[21, 23]","in this very funny story of how the richest man in the world decides to go undercover as a shoe salesman in a store he forgot he owned until labor agitators hang him in effigy. It's Charles Coburn's intention to infiltrate the labor movement and bring these ""wrongdoers"" to justice or at least unemployment. He doesn't bargain on what happens when he begins to rub shoulders with the hoi polloi, and how meeting with the peppy Miss Jones (Jean Arthur) will change his outlook on labor and ultimately life.Jean Arthur is very appealing as this working class heroine, but it's Charles Coburn who runs away with the picture. His transformation from a Rockefeller-type cold as ice businessman into a tuna popover eating funlover is aces, especially in his dealings with the surprisingly unpleasant Edmund Gwenn as the manager of the shoe department. Ironic that Gwenn returned to the department store scene a few years later to buck authority himself as Kris Kringle in ""Miracle on 34 Street"". A point worth noting is that much of the dialogue concerns the misunderstanding about Coburn's true identity, and his consequently being abused as an older worker with limited skills in an emerging modern world. Although 60 years ago, this still rings true today, and gives us some food for thought.This picture has only two things going against it: First is its terrible title. Not only does it not really make any sense given the plot of the film, but it later got co-opted as the title of a famous porn film, ""Devil IN Miss Jones"", so that even the librarian where I took this out gave me the once over, thinking I was taking out a smutty film. I'll bet few people ever do rent this movie because of its dubious monniker. The second thing that's not so hot is a police station scene where Robert Cummings tries (and fails) to be a Capra-esque ""ordinary man"" hero bucking authority by appealing to the Founding Fathers' principles. The scene is so bad it brings the movie to a complete standstill; I was afraid it would be downhill from there, but it picked up again. My advice is that should you ever rent or buy this film, as soon as Cummings enters the station, fast forward to the next scene to save yourself some grief.Other than those two points, ""The Devil and Miss Jones"" is a real winner, and I still give it five stars for a funny script and Coburn's marvelous performance.",5,Jupiter comes down to Earth...,1039564800,"12 11, 2002",2002,2375,"['very', 'funny', 'story', 'how', 'richest', 'man', 'world', 'go', 'undercover', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'store', 'forgot', 'owned', 'labor', 'agitators', 'hang', 'effigy', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'intention', 'infiltrate', 'labor', 'movement', 'bring', 'wrongdoers', 'justice', 'least', 'unemployment', ""n't"", 'bargain', 'what', 'when', 'rub', 'shoulders', 'hoi', 'polloi', 'how', 'meeting', 'peppy', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'will', 'change', 'outlook', 'labor', 'ultimately', 'life.Jean', 'Arthur', 'very', 'appealing', 'working', 'class', 'heroine', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'who', 'away', 'picture', 'transformation', 'Rockefeller-type', 'cold', 'ice', 'businessman', 'tuna', 'popover', 'eating', 'funlover', 'aces', 'especially', 'dealings', 'surprisingly', 'unpleasant', 'Edmund', 'Gwenn', 'manager', 'shoe', 'department', 'Ironic', 'Gwenn', 'returned', 'department', 'store', 'scene', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'buck', 'authority', 'Kris', 'Kringle', 'Miracle', '34', 'Street', 'point', 'worth', 'noting', 'much', 'dialogue', 'misunderstanding', 'Coburn', 'true', 'identity', 'consequently', 'being', 'abused', 'older', 'worker', 'limited', 'skills', 'emerging', 'modern', 'world', '60', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'true', 'today', 'food', 'thought.This', 'picture', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'First', 'terrible', 'title', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'given', 'plot', 'film', 'later', 'got', 'co-opted', 'title', 'famous', 'porn', 'film', 'Devil', 'IN', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'even', 'librarian', 'where', 'took', 'out', 'gave', 'once', 'thinking', 'was', 'taking', 'out', 'smutty', 'film', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'few', 'people', 'ever', 'do', 'rent', 'movie', 'dubious', 'monniker', 'second', 'thing', 'not', 'so', 'hot', 'police', 'station', 'scene', 'where', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'tries', 'be', 'Capra-esque', 'ordinary', 'man', 'hero', 'bucking', 'authority', 'appealing', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'principles', 'scene', 'so', 'bad', 'movie', 'complete', 'standstill', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'be', 'downhill', 'there', 'picked', 'up', 'again', 'My', 'advice', 'should', 'ever', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'Cummings', 'station', 'fast', 'forward', 'next', 'scene', 'save', 'grief.Other', 'two', 'points', 'Devil', 'Miss', 'Jones', 'real', 'winner', 'still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'funny', 'script', 'Coburn', 'marvelous', 'performance']",N/A

41254,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,0782008445,MadMacs,"[3, 4]","Have been and always will be a fan of Jean Arthur. Ditto my feelings for Charles Coburn, in his time the go-to-guy when you needed a crafty fast-talking hustler with just a drop of deviousness. (check out 'The Lady Eve' if you get a chance)As mentioned in my previous reviews, it's notable that Ms. Arthur never saw herself as sexy or sexually charged, always believing that her fort&eacute; was more attuned to the roles of spunky kid sister or funny friend. But she clearly shorted herself - because no straight man alive wouldn't be attracted to her beauty, her wonderful sense of humor, and that oh-so-sweet voice.This was the first of three times the pair worked together; and each time they just got better and better. Their second film from 1943, 'The More the Merrier', is in my opinion, one of the best romantic-comedies for the period.In 'Miss Jones' she plays Mary, a ladies shoes salesperson in a very large department store. Said store is in turmoil. The corporate stooges are uncaring and the floor managers harsh taskmasters who deny their workers any real benefits while miserly doling out meager earnings. Revolt is in the air. Some employees are demanding a union and the store's owner is none too pleased with the protestations; considering them nothing more than insubordinate peons. In fact, the disdain is mutual. His workers quietly call their boss 'The Devil', hence the title.His real name is J.P. Merrick and Coburn plays the Wall Street tycoon to absolute perfection. An authoritarian cheapskate who demands total subservience and complete capitulation from all. Therefore - revolt of any stripe is not allowed.He's so incensed that his drone ants are conspiring ""against him"" - that he decides to nip the rebellious employees in the bud, cut them to the quick, and get rid of them. But his underlings can't penetrate the worker's secrecy. They just don't have the ability to get past their haughty superiority to dig - even metaphorically. But J.P. isn't about to let that stop him. Deciding that the only man up to the task is staring back at him from the mirror, he decides that he's going undercover. He'll infiltrate, locate, and identify the troublemakers. And then heads will roll and bottoms will sting.Adopting a fictitious name, J.P. engineers an opening on the sales floor to collect intelligence and add black marks to names. His target assignment: Ladies Shoes.One can pretty much work out the story from there. But it's the joy of discovery - the hilarity of watching one of the privileged 1% having to grovel and serve others, like the rest of us, that makes this so very enjoyable. Especially in this current economy.Also stars Robert Cummings and Spring Byington. I have to admit that over the years I've learned to detest Ms. Byington. She plays capricious and manipulative roles so well (i.e. 'No Room for the Groom') that I'm unaccustomed to her playing sweet and normal. That I find her so abhorrent is a testament to her fantastic acting skill; and believe me, I understand and respect it. But she's so good, I always have an instantaneous negative reaction whenever I see her on screen. It will likely take a variety of screenings before I'm able to differentiate, and ultimately, appreciate her varied performances.Finally, I would be remiss not to mention Edmund Gwynn. And like Spring, once again, I'm emotionally torn. I'm used to seeing him play sweet, kind and supportive - how can anyone see him as anything butSanta Claus? &lt;g> But Gwynn was indeed a professional, as perfectly executed in this production. Because he's a s**** heel extraordinaire in this film.An outstanding and very fun comedy with rambunctious Charles Coburn stealing the show.",4,Yet Another Wonderful Arthur/Coburn Production,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,3707,"['Have', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'fan', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Ditto', 'feelings', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'time', 'go-to-guy', 'when', 'needed', 'crafty', 'fast-talking', 'hustler', 'just', 'drop', 'deviousness', 'check', 'out', ""'The"", 'Lady', 'Eve', 'get', 'chance', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'reviews', 'notable', 'Ms.', 'Arthur', 'never', 'saw', 'sexy', 'sexually', 'charged', 'always', 'believing', 'fort', 'eacute', 'was', 'more', 'attuned', 'roles', 'spunky', 'kid', 'sister', 'funny', 'friend', 'clearly', 'shorted', 'straight', 'man', 'alive', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'attracted', 'beauty', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'humor', 'oh-so-sweet', 'voice.This', 'was', 'first', 'three', 'times', 'pair', 'worked', 'together', 'time', 'just', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'second', 'film', '1943', 'More', 'Merrier', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'romantic-comedies', 'period.In', 'Jones', 'Mary', 'ladies', 'salesperson', 'very', 'large', 'department', 'store', 'Said', 'store', 'turmoil', 'corporate', 'stooges', 'are', 'uncaring', 'floor', 'managers', 'harsh', 'taskmasters', 'who', 'deny', 'workers', 'real', 'benefits', 'miserly', 'doling', 'out', 'meager', 'earnings', 'Revolt', 'air', 'employees', 'are', 'demanding', 'union', 'store', 'owner', 'none', 'too', 'pleased', 'protestations', 'considering', 'nothing', 'more', 'insubordinate', 'peons', 'fact', 'disdain', 'mutual', 'workers', 'quietly', 'call', 'boss', 'Devil', 'hence', 'title.His', 'real', 'name', 'J.P.', 'Merrick', 'Coburn', 'Wall', 'Street', 'tycoon', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'authoritarian', 'cheapskate', 'who', 'total', 'subservience', 'complete', 'capitulation', 'Therefore', 'revolt', 'stripe', 'not', 'allowed.He', 'so', 'incensed', 'drone', 'ants', 'are', 'conspiring', 'nip', 'rebellious', 'employees', 'bud', 'cut', 'quick', 'get', 'rid', 'underlings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'penetrate', 'worker', 'secrecy', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ability', 'get', 'haughty', 'superiority', 'dig', 'even', 'metaphorically', 'J.P.', ""n't"", 'about', 'let', 'stop', 'Deciding', 'only', 'man', 'up', 'task', 'staring', 'back', 'mirror', 'going', 'undercover', ""'ll"", 'infiltrate', 'locate', 'identify', 'troublemakers', 'then', 'heads', 'will', 'roll', 'bottoms', 'will', 'sting.Adopting', 'fictitious', 'name', 'J.P.', 'opening', 'sales', 'floor', 'collect', 'intelligence', 'add', 'black', 'marks', 'names', 'target', 'assignment', 'Ladies', 'Shoes.One', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'work', 'story', 'there', 'joy', 'discovery', 'hilarity', 'watching', 'one', 'privileged', '1', '%', 'having', 'grovel', 'serve', 'others', 'rest', 'so', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Especially', 'current', 'economy.Also', 'stars', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'have', 'admit', 'years', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'detest', 'Ms.', 'Byington', 'capricious', 'manipulative', 'roles', 'so', 'well', 'i.e', 'Room', 'Groom', ""'m"", 'unaccustomed', 'playing', 'sweet', 'normal', 'find', 'so', 'abhorrent', 'testament', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'skill', 'believe', 'understand', 'respect', 'so', 'good', 'always', 'have', 'instantaneous', 'negative', 'reaction', 'whenever', 'see', 'screen', 'will', 'likely', 'take', 'variety', 'screenings', ""'m"", 'able', 'differentiate', 'ultimately', 'appreciate', 'varied', 'performances.Finally', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'not', 'mention', 'Edmund', 'Gwynn', 'Spring', 'once', 'again', ""'m"", 'emotionally', 'torn', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'play', 'sweet', 'kind', 'supportive', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'see', 'anything', 'butSanta', 'Claus', 'lt', '>', 'Gwynn', 'was', 'indeed', 'professional', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'production', 's****', 'heel', 'extraordinaire', 'film.An', 'outstanding', 'very', 'fun', 'comedy', 'rambunctious', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'stealing', 'show']",N/A

41260,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0782008445,Randy Keehn,"[3, 3]","""The Devil and Miss Jones"" is one of those ""fun"" movies out of the '30's and '40's.  Back then Hollywood had a varied sense of humor within a general framework of decency.  As such, there were a lot of ""screwball"" comedies that might not always be understood by all generations but at least could be viewed by all generations.  Nowadays the rating of the movies restrict their audiences (and, generally, for good reason).  Thus we end up with cartoon and animal-themed movies for little kids, inane junk (like ""Joe Dirt""-sorry Robby) for pre-teens, silly romance comedies for teenagers, and profane whatevers for adults.  There was an art to making a movie that could be enjoyed by all generations and comedy was one genre that generally attracts all generations (what pre-puberty juvenile would want to watch a romantic drama even if it was rated G).  That was what kept running through my mind as I watched ""The Devil and Miss Jones"".The premise is as fertile as it is silly; a multi-millionaire is bothered by labor unrest in one of his least important businesses.  To find out what the problem is, he mascarades as a new employee and the fun begins.  There is a fair amount of social commentary mixed into the script but nothing too serious.  (You understand that from the disclaimer at the movie's beginning).  The various different hijinks that arise are enjoyably funny.  I may not have laughed out loud but I did smile a lot; both inwardly and outwardly.  Movies like these are required to have a happy ending and there is an interesting twist to this one.The acting in ""The Devil and Miss Jones"" is pretty good with the best preformance given by Charles Colburn.  Jean Arthur does comedy well and this movie serves as a reminder of that fact.  Bob Cummings gets a bit much at times but, then, he's supposed to.  There are plenty of other great efforts including an appropriately reserved preformance by Spring Byington.""The Devil and Miss Jones"" is not a great movie; it is a good movie.  In its' own way, it is a testament to the quality that was Hollywood two or three generations ago.  Subtle is not a word often used to describe modern cinema.

41262,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0782008445,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","The Devil and Miss Jones(released April/41)finally comes to DVD.The film stars,among others,Jean Arthur as Mary Jones,Robert Cummings as Joe O'Brien,Charles Coburn as John P. Merrick,Edmund Gwenn as Hooper,Spring Byington as Elizabeth Ellis,S.Z. Sakall as George (Merrick's Butler)and William Demarest as First Detective.I hadn't seen the film for years until a copy surfaced in the 80s,restored by UCLA.This version is licensed through Paramount,who holds the rights for this RKO film.The company here is relatively new to the scene,Olive Films.Their catalogue is not what you would call extensive but it is eclectic.The story opens as four executives arrive at the stately mansion of one John Merrick.He is a rich but crotchety old man who runs and owns multiple businesses.After viewing a picture in the paper of some employees outside of a department store he owns(Neeley's to be specific)burning him in effigy,he vows to take drastic action.Already some of those responsible have been fired but Merrick is calling for more blood.A detective is hired but he is waived away as his wife is pregnant and he cannot start right away.Much to the chagrin of his butler,he decides to go undercover himself,under the detectives name.Off he trots the next day to Neeleys and is greeted by a rather surly and condescending floor manager.Both take an instant dislike to one another,and the manager is the first to go down on his list in his little black book.A clerk,Mary Jones,befriends Merrick and in fact gets the impression he is very poor.She in turn introduces him to another clerk named Elizabeth Ellis.As they are the same age both take an instant liking to each other.In bursts Joe O'Brien shouting to anyone who will hear him,a close friend of Mary's,who is trying to organize/unionize the store.He is taken away by the store detective,and later that night he greets Mary and Merrick at a clandestine meeting held on a rooftop.Merrick is used by Mary as a poster boy for what is wrong with management and why they should band together,much to Merricks embarrassment.Next day Merrick joins Joe,Mary and Elizabeth at the beach at Coney Island.They all have a great time,and Merrick becomes closer to the three than he wants to admit.Somehow during the day they lose track of each other and Merrick ends up getting arrested.Down at the police station the other three finally track him down and Joe grandstands there on principle,until the police let them all go,charges dropped.Back at the beach,it is now early evening,and Mr.Merrick and Elizabeth are laying side by side;Mr.Merrick though still awake and listening to the other two.Mary and Joe have a heart to heart during which Joe tells Mary he cannot marry her,because his prospects of employment are bleak.Mary gets upset and Joe storms away,dropping the list of 400 employees he is trying to sign up to organize.Merrick quickly picks it up and Mary sees him.He goes to hand it back to Mary but she tells him to keep it;he does,smiling.On the train back to the city Mary,Elizabeth and Merrick talk about the events that have just transpired.Merricks stop comes up and he leaves.Unknowingly he drops his card identifying him to the personnel manager,as working undercover.Mary picks it up,plays with it,cleans her fingernails with it,looks at it,all the while her mind being on Joe.She drops it and leaves the train.Just as the train door closes behind her it hits her what she saw on the card.Next day at the store Merrick is back,a little late,and being admonished by the floor manager.However today he is on the offensive and tells the manager HE is the one going to be fired.Mary tries to warn Elizabeth and Joe that Merrick is really working for the company.The four of them end up upstairs in the store managers office,and grieve their case to him.The manager plays coy and says there is nothing he can do if he hasn't the list of names.When Mary hands him the list and the store manager's true colours come to the fore.He immediately threatens to start by firing everyone on the 5th floor.They push out the security and Joe becomes a one man barricade until Merrick and Mary can swallow the list.They also manage to make a store wide announcement for everyone to walk out and picket Merricks home.Later Merrick is now home and there is a huge protest going on outside his home,including Joe,Elizabeth and Mary.Merrick has summoned the four executives from the beginning of the film to his residence and plans a parle' with the protestors.Merrick sneaks out the servants entrance and joins the picket line,just as Mary arrives with an effigy of Merrick to burn.She is going to give Merrick the honour of lighting it when he tells them there is a meeting planned inside.The four arrive in a room with the execs on one side of the table and Merrick and the three others on the other.The exces try to browbeat any suggestion thrown out but Merrick admonishes them ever so carefully as to not blow his cover.Finally something has to give,and when Elizabeth leans on Merrick crying the execs stand up telling her to &#34;unhand Mr.Merrick&#34;.His cover blown,Elizabeth backs away,Mary screams and Joe is laid flat out on the floor!The final scene finds all of the employees at the Neely store all dancing at a giant party being thrown by Merrick.The camera moves back and they are all on a ship sailing toward Hawaii,courtesy of Mr.Merrick himself.This is such a joyous,touching and wonderful film on so many levels.The film on one hand is almost a Scrooge like tale where the nemesis sees the error of his ways and becomes a better person for it in the end.The way Merrick slowly starts to come around and changes,not only his outlook on the store but as his inner feelings blossom towards Elizabeth and Mary and Joe,is done with just the right and believable touch.On the other hand we have a love story between Joe and Mary,which seems as real and human as anything you are likely to see in real life.There is also the  back story of employees trying to organize and how companies treat them.All of the actors involved were top notch and the film is edited well and directed well by Sam Wood.Whenever anyone aks me,I tell them that this is my favourite Jean Arthur film,and one of my favourite character actors is on hand with a brilliant understated performance,S.Z.Sakall.Technically speaking the film is in its original 1:37:1 a/r and this is a very good to excellent print.There are no extras.All in all a heartwarming and wonderful movie,with a dream cast that gels together like nobodies business.This film has been out of circulation for far too long and I hope now it will get the wider audience it deserves.I loath using the word&#34;classic&#34; because it has been overused for years.But with this film,I have to make

There have been several uprisings in the company, and the events are topped off with a stuffed dummy likeness of Mr. Merrick. The real Merrick is fed up, so he decides to spy undercover. He takes a job as a slipper salesman alongside two women, the kindhearted Mary Jones (Jean Arthur) and sweet Elizabeth Ellis (Spring Byington). Mary's boyfriend Joe (Robert Cummings) is the ringleader of the plot against Merrick stores. This angers Merrick, but he quickly learns why the employees hate working there with secret shoppers breathing down their necks and selfish bosses. Merrick softens up thanks to the company he keeps, and the comedy mounts on a trip to Coney Island.This is a breezy, fun film with a very lovable cast. Arthur is sweet as always and Cummings is a wonderful match for her, but it is Coburn who is the real star. It is interesting to see such an elderly character actor as the star, but that is exactly what he is and he carries the film well.

Merrick, the world's richest man, who decides to infiltrate one of his holdings - a department store - to ferret out union organisers who have targeted him as being responsible for the miserable conditions his employees work under.  Merrick is subjected to many indignities by the management, finally ending up in the shoe department alongside Mary Jones [Jean Arthur].  Mary thinks Merrick destitute, takes pity on him and shows him the intricacies of the department.  The old boy attends union meetings and carefully notes everyone there, but the abuse from the store's management becomes intolerable - then he meets Elizabeth Ellis [Spring Byington] - and has a change of heart...

What a simply wonderful comedy which stars the beautiful Jean Arthur, the gruff character actor Charles Coburn, as well as Bob Cummings and Edmund Gwenn.  Coburn is J.P. Merrick, the millionaire owner of a large department store.  When the employees of the store start trying to organize a union, he decides to go undercover to find out who the ringleaders are.  He takes a job as a shoe salesman calling himself Tom Higgins.  He is immediately confronted on his first day by the shoe department manager Mr. Hooper (Gwenn) who plays a nasty role for once and tells Higgins he had the lowest intelligence score he's ever seen.Tom is assigned to sell women's slippers and befriends two women In the department, Mary (Arthur) and Elizabeth (played by Spring Byington).  When Tom says he doesn't eat lunch, the women take pity on him because they think he's broke and give him money and some of their food.  Later Tom agrees to meet Mary at night and soon finds himself in the middle of a hopeful union meeting.  It turns out that Mary and her boyfriend Joe (Cummings) are the ringleaders and even use ""poor"" Tom as an example of a man who's down on his luck due to being tossed out by his previous employers.At work, Tom is constantly under criticism from Hooper who thinks he's too old for the job.  Tom keeps a notebook and writes in bold letters ""Fire department manager!!""  He wants to do a good job and so he his butler come in with the daughter of one of the servants to buy a dozen shoes.  The plan goes hilariously awry when the girl screams she doesn't like the shoes and Hooper decides to take over AND get credit for the sale.And so it goes with Merrick as the fish out of water, learning not only about these employees but himself as well.  In another scene Tom and Elizabeth join Joe and Mary for a day at Coney Island beach.  Tom brings along some very expensive wine but the others think he was taken with some cheap stuff and it makes for a classic clash of cultures.The Film was directed by Sam Wood who made such classics as Goodbye Mr. Chips, A Night at the Opera, And the Pride of the Yankees.  The film is very Capra-esque however with great performances from the entire cast.

John P. Merrick (Charles Coburn), the world's richest man, gets word that someone is trying to unionize a department store that he owns. To thwart this blatant act of democracy, Merrick changes his name and takes a menial job at the store, the better to catch the union activists without detection. Once he himself is subjected to the humiliating treatment afforded his employees, Merrick starts to wise up -- and soften up. As things develop, it is Merrick himself who spearheads the union movement after discovering how duplicitous his hand-picked executives can be. The film also introduces Jean Arthur and Robert Cummings as fellow employees who fall in love before fadeout time. Keeping with the film's insistence upon equal treatment for everyone, Merrick himself is permitted a romance in the person of Elizabeth Ellis (Spring Byington). The Devil and Miss Jones was written by Norman Krasna and directed by Sam Wood. ~ Hal Erickson, RoviHere is the Amazon ""Product Description""The great Sam Wood (Pride of the Yankees) directs this socially conscientious classic comedy. John P. Merrick (Charles Coburn), the world's richest man, gets word that someone is trying to unionize a department store he owns. To thwart this blatant act of democracy, Merrick changes his name and takes a menial job at the store to catch the union activists without detention. Once he himself is subjected to the humiliating treatment by the department supervisor, Hooper (Edmund Gwenn), Merrick starts to wise up -- and soften up. Jean Arthur (The More the Merrier) plays Mary Jones, a shoe saleswoman who becomes Coburn's coworker and liaison to the world of the common man. Miss Jones is love with the head of the union activists played by Robert Cummings (Saboteur) and Merrick himself falls in love with co-worker, Elizabeth Ellis (Spring Byington). The double-date sequence at Coney Island immortalizes the infamous beach in its masses of flesh and general bedlam, the great William Cameron Menzies (Gone with the Wind) created the extravagant detail-rich sets, which are the perfect complements to the witty script by Norman Krasna (White Christmas).

Spring Byington is wonderful, also as usual, and Robert Cummings is a surprise, playing a romantic lead instead of the comic that he was known for on TV. The theme of the movie is as relevant now as it was when it was made. How nice it would be if this plot happened in real life. How terrible that we haven't gotten much farther in 70 years. Give yourself a treat and see it.",5,a great cast in a very relevant story,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,620,"['Charles', 'Coburn', 'real', 'star', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'AND', 'MISS', 'JONES', 'Not', 'Jean', 'Arthur', ""n't"", 'fabulous', 'self', 'usual', 'part', 'fit', 'glove', 'Coburn', 'one', 'are', 'really', 'rooting', 'centerpiece', 'story', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'wonderful', 'also', 'usual', 'Robert', 'Cummings', 'surprise', 'playing', 'romantic', 'lead', 'instead', 'comic', 'was', 'known', 'TV', 'theme', 'movie', 'relevant', 'now', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'How', 'nice', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'How', 'terrible', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'much', 'farther', '70', 'years', 'Give', 'treat', 'see']",N/A
