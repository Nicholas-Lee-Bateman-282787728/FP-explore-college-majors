1541385,A27AU9SIQYNKLB,B0081L9TO8,Bracia1,"[0, 0]",I really like Anthony Bourdain. He goes to ordinary places around the world. He'll eat anything! With a local to take him around to street venders and other less known places he eats food prepared by farm people and fishermen and hunters and talks to them about their lives and politics and how they cook.  So interesting and not a fancy restaurant tour.,4,Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations Collection 7,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,354,"['really', 'Anthony', 'Bourdain', 'ordinary', 'places', 'world', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'anything', 'local', 'take', 'around', 'street', 'venders', 'other', 'less', 'known', 'places', 'food', 'prepared', 'farm', 'people', 'fishermen', 'hunters', 'talks', 'lives', 'politics', 'how', 'cook', 'So', 'interesting', 'not', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'tour']",Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations Collection 7

You can see why Anthony Bourdain is moving to CNN from the Travel Channel as the show has become less about actual travel and mainly about the culture and politics of the places he's seeing.  The Haiti episode featuring Sean Penn was as insightful as any I've seen about the devastation from the 2010 earthquake.  The Cuba show illustrated the poverty created by the Castro regime among the majority of the island's citizens.  Even the look at the Ozarks delved more into the culture of the region than food.  Those looking for a more straight travel show, the Vienna episode has gorgeous snow covered scenery and Mr. Bourdain chowing down on all manner of meats and chocolates.  The Cajun show has Mr. Bourdain going Tony Soprano on a pig and is one of the best episodes the series has ever produced.",5,More Reservations,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,873,"['last', 'season', 'No', 'Reservations', 'may', 'have', 'well', 'been', 'show', 'best', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Anthony', 'Bourdain', 'moving', 'CNN', 'Travel', 'Channel', 'show', 'become', 'less', 'actual', 'travel', 'mainly', 'culture', 'politics', 'places', 'seeing', 'Haiti', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'as', 'insightful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'devastation', '2010', 'earthquake', 'Cuba', 'show', 'illustrated', 'poverty', 'created', 'Castro', 'regime', 'majority', 'island', 'citizens', 'Even', 'look', 'Ozarks', 'delved', 'more', 'culture', 'region', 'food', 'looking', 'more', 'straight', 'travel', 'show', 'Vienna', 'episode', 'gorgeous', 'snow', 'covered', 'scenery', 'Mr.', 'Bourdain', 'chowing', 'down', 'manner', 'meats', 'chocolates', 'Cajun', 'show', 'Mr.', 'Bourdain', 'going', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'pig', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'produced']",Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations Collection 7
