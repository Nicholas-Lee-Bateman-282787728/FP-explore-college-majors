I am so glad that there is something out there that has allowed me to relive my childhood.  I think any adult and child should have the plesure to watch these classic cartoons.

Well, I liked them as a kid too so I can understand. I guess the appeal is just ageless. As such, I spotted the Tom and Jerry ""Whiskers Away"" DVD in the five dollar bins at a nearby Wall-Mart and got it for the boy. I've had it for a couple weeks now. Well, yesterday was a heavy workload day and I was feeling really stressed. I didn't feel like watching some high-powered, deep-thinking movie. I opted for a late-night preview of the new Tom and Jerry DVD for the boy.It's a good DVD. The artwork is excellent and the colors are bright and vivid. The ten episodes went by fast. Best of all, I was laughing and it felt good. How silly these episodes are, yet even as a 76-year-old adult I can always get a good laugh. I seldom laugh at the modern cartoons my wife plays for the boy. Don't get me wring, he likes them but I don't. Just give me these old timers for good belly laughs. I think my boy reacts the same way. This is an excellent DVD.Gary Peterson",5,Excellent Artwork. Bright Vivid Colors.

728648,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,B00007G1ZN,Jerry McDaniel,"[9, 13]","i've got this Tom and Jerry project on video and so maybe there's a difference with the DVD? when i watch the video i've got {it's in a clam shell case}, they look just as if they were from Cartoon Network. there's nothing bad about them that i can find. my favorite cartoons on this video are ""In the Hollywood Bowl""; ""Two Mouseketeers""; ""Texas Tom""; and ""Cat and the Mermouse"". the only thing negative is the running time. just 72 minutes and i know what some might be thinking. commercial free 72 minutes is LONGER than something with commercials. this is true. but, Tom and Jerry, classic or contemporary, are always good if given proper stories. i didn't like the cartoons where they were ""pals"" and fought a common enemy. i also didn't like the Gene Dietch versions either, but they're better than the friendly versions that Hanna-Barbera produced after being intimidated by anti-violent, nonsensical protest groups who had influence over advertisers and the media-at-large. if you doubt me, just look at how the media paints cartoons like this as violent even though in the next scene everyone's in perfect shape. Unrealistic violence does not harm anybody and neither does realistic violence for that matter. it all boils down to a viewer's psyche and NOT a silly anti-violence spokesperson CLAIMING how harmful these shows are. this, like i said, is great as far as i can tell. i don't have the DVD version. get the VHS and see if there's a difference. but from my perspective, there's not one thing wrong with the VHS i've got.",5,i've got this on VHS,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,1537,"['i', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'project', 'video', 'so', 'maybe', 'difference', 'DVD', 'when', 'i', 'watch', 'video', 'i', ""'ve"", 'got', 'clam', 'shell', 'case', 'look', 'just', 'were', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'nothing', 'bad', 'i', 'can', 'find', 'favorite', 'cartoons', 'video', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'Two', 'Mouseketeers', 'Texas', 'Tom', 'Cat', 'Mermouse', 'only', 'thing', 'negative', 'running', 'time', 'just', '72', 'minutes', 'i', 'know', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'thinking', 'commercial', 'free', '72', 'minutes', 'LONGER', 'something', 'commercials', 'true', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'classic', 'contemporary', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'given', 'proper', 'stories', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'cartoons', 'where', 'were', 'pals', 'fought', 'common', 'enemy', 'i', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'Gene', 'Dietch', 'versions', ""'re"", 'better', 'friendly', 'versions', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'produced', 'being', 'intimidated', 'anti-violent', 'nonsensical', 'protest', 'groups', 'who', 'had', 'influence', 'advertisers', 'media-at-large', 'doubt', 'just', 'look', 'how', 'media', 'paints', 'cartoons', 'like', 'violent', 'even', 'next', 'scene', 'everyone', 'perfect', 'shape', 'Unrealistic', 'violence', 'not', 'harm', 'anybody', 'neither', 'realistic', 'violence', 'matter', 'down', 'viewer', 'psyche', 'NOT', 'silly', 'anti-violence', 'spokesperson', 'CLAIMING', 'how', 'harmful', 'shows', 'are', 'i', 'said', 'great', 'as', 'far', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVD', 'version', 'get', 'VHS', 'see', 'difference', 'perspective', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'wrong', 'VHS', 'i', ""'ve"", 'got']",N/A
