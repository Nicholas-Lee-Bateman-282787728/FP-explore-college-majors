Instead he befriends the toughest kid in the school, a loner, who agrees to become his bodyguard.

But through his friendship with Makepeace, Baldwin comes out of his shell in a climactic finale involving a fight with the extortionists.

226375,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,6300247309,Brett Johnson,"[5, 7]","""My Bodyguard"" is a story about high school sophomore Clifford Peache (Chris Makepeace).  On just his first day of school, he pisses off the class bully Melvin Moody (Matt Dillon).  Later, Moody corners Clifford in the bathroom and tells him that he provides ""protection"" to a lot of the kids for a dollar a day.  Clifford considers that to be extortion and decides he'll have no part of it.  Needless to say, that just makes Moody target him even more.  Clifford employs the assistance of another kid in the class named Ricky Linderman (Adam Baldwin).  Ricky has a shady past and there are rumors floating around that he killed a cop and assaulted a teacher.  Clifford decides to hire Ricky to be his bodyguard.  It works for a while because Moody is afraid to fight him.Of course, there would be no movie if everything went smoothly after this little arrangement.  Problems develop and the situation escalates until the predictable ending.  While ""My Bodyguard"" isn't anything amazing, it is saved by an amiable script, decent direction and especially a talented young cast.  This was the first starring role for both Adam Baldwin and Joan Cusack.  As always, Joan was wonderful in a role which was small but showed that she was going to be a promising new actress.  This was only the second major role for Matt Dillon and it really helped to establish him as a hot young actor as well.  Martin Mull, Ruth Gordon and an appearance by John Houseman rounded out the capable cast.""My Bodyguard"" is one of those rare high school movies that actually stars teenagers.  That is always a plus because it helps add to the reality.  You truly believe that these could be kids facing actual problems.  It doesn't come across as a bunch of twentysomethings playing parts.  However, this film falls short in a key area.  It ends up sending the message that if you are being hassled in high school then try and fight your way out of it.  I guess the fact that you may end up hospitalized or expelled is unimportant.  Not everyone is a good fighter and not everyone has the privilege of having a bodyguard.

Pretty sad considering I grew up just north of Chicago and a few famous landmarks are visibly present within a number of scenes.Anyway, Clifford Peache (Chris Makepeace) has a problem besides his really bad mushroomed shaped harido.  Having just transferred from a private to public school, Clifford has run afoul of a gang of toughs, led by Moody (Matt Dillon) whose main source of income is extorting money from kids under the premise of protection from another kid, Ricky Linderman (Alec Baldwin).  See, legend has it that Ricky, a boy larger than most, has done all kinds of things from killing a kid, raping a teacher, to shooting a cop.  Moody and his gang claim to provide protection from Ricky, but, really, they are only providing protection against themselves, because not paying Moody would result in a beating from Moody or any of his cronies.  Clifford angers Moody and his goons by refusing to pay, which results in all kinds of harassment.Clifford, seeing that even the bullies are afraid of Ricky, approaches Ricky to try and make a deal to get him to be his bodyguard.  Ricky agrees initially, but backs out as Clifford tries to learn more about Ricky, about his past and why he's so feared.  I've noticed some reviewers have tried to infer some sort of burgeoning homoerotic relationship between these two characters, but I really didn't see it.  It's sad that two male characters in a movie can't develop a close friendship without some people labeling it as something other than what it is...I actually found that notion a little offensive and silly as this is a charming little movie that portrays one boy, who shut nearly shut everything out after a tragic event opening up to a friend.  In the end, the boys develop a friendship, but also get more in that Clifford learns how to stand up for himself and Ricky seems to come to terms with a past event that isolated him and made him feared throughout the school.Look for appearances by Martin Mull, Ruth Gordon, Joan Cusack, John Houseman, George Wendt, Tim Kazurinsky, and Jennifer Beals.  The movie is presented in full screen and wide screen formats, and looks really good.  The audio is solid, but there are English subtitles if needed.  One of the many things I appreciated about this movie was the use of real teenagers to portray teens on the screen.  It really annoys me seeing some twenty something being passed off as a high school student as seems fairly common nowadays.

It also features an uncreditedcameo by a young Jennifer Beals pre her Flashdance days, still looking as beautiful as ever.

If you caught the middle of ""My Bodyguard"" on television several times like I did or have only seen this movie one time, you may think that this is simply a clich&eacute; film about bullies ruling the school and the nerdy outsiders getting their revenge. But the story of ""My Bodyguard"" goes a bit deeper than that. I was one of those who saw bits and pieces of this film on television and was moved enough to buy the movie for myself. It's been one of my favorite movies ever since and is perfect for the family (however there is some mild violence and a little language, so some scenes may not be appropriate for the littler kids).This neat little family movie is probably one of the most underrated of its kind and features a terrific cast including a very young Matt Dillon and Joan Cusak (John Cusak's sister). But the movie revolves around Clifford Peache (played by Chris Makepeace) and Ricky Linderman (an outstanding performance from Adam Baldwin). In a nutshell, the two teens are from opposite sides of the tracks and come together in a most unique and unlikely friendship. Clifford is the new kid in school who comes from a rich family and lives in a fancy Chicago hotel with this father and wacky, kid-hearted grandmother. Ricky is a tall, grungy, filthy and alienated school rebel who keeps to himself and avoids any social activities. Amongst the rumors spread through school about him killing kids and abusing teachers, Ricky walks around lost in a world of depression while everyone fears him and is cautious of him, even the top school bully Melvin Moody (played by Matt Dillon). You kind of feel sorry for Ricky somehow in the beginning. Maybe it's because I can relate to the aloneness that Ricky must feel because I personally was alone a lot in high school without many friends. But from the get-go, you kind of get a sense that Ricky is not as bad as people think he is.The only student that is not intimidated by Ricky or Moody is Clifford. Behind Clifford's innocent, laid-back personality is quite the bold young man. I have to hand it to Clifford that he has a lot of courage to not succumb to the bullies' demands. But he instead takes abuse from them. Clifford finds out early who rules the roost in his new school and really does not get off on the right track. Clifford's wisecrack at Moody in the classroom leads to an after school encounter in the boys' bathroom where Moody throws huge water-soaked wads of toilet paper around him and tells Clifford that he should pay him ""protection money"" to keep him safe from the ""awful"" Ricky Linderman. According to Moody, he and his crew are ""bodyguards."" But bold Clifford refuses to give him his lunch money for so-called protection (in this case it is more like extortion). Unfortunately for Clifford, Moody and his gang have plans to make life miserable for him for not taking them up on their offer. First they chase Clifford out of the school after an episode concerning a cup of toilet water. Next, things escalate after Clifford's father calls the school complaining about the kids committing extortion against his son. Moody rough-houses Clifford during a gym class basketball game, they load his gym locker with garbage and then begin to harass him in the bathroom; that is until they see Ricky in the bathroom as well and decide to take off.Clifford doesn't really buy all the rumors about Ricky Linderman and he thinks the ""protection money"" deals are ridiculous; especially when he hears that his friend and classmate Carson has also been picked on by Moody and his gang and has been forced to give up his lunch money, bus fair and stay away from the boys' bathroom. After all, Carson, in his words is ""kind of addicted to breathing."" So what to do in a situation like this? Take the bull by the horns, which is exactly what Clifford does after the gym incident. Running up to Ricky, Clifford offers him money and to do his homework in exchange for him being his bodyguard, to which Ricky simply says: ""Not interested."" Clifford even goes so far as to ask a teacher about these so-called rumors about Ricky and he finds out about the tragic accident concerning Ricky, his little brother and a gun they had been playing with.The saga continues with Moody and his gang tripping Clifford at lunch and stuffing him into a locker after he's done swimming. Guess who gets Clifford out of the locker? But Clifford gets a little revenge of his own, at least for the moment. After spying Moody and his gang in a local high school hangout/diner, Clifford sneaks in and catches them off guard with surprise squirts of ketchup and mustard in their faces and milkshakes dunked over their heads. Oh boy, hear we go again. The chase is on and Moody and his gang corner Clifford in a back ally, threatening to beat him up good. Guess who appears just in time? None other than Ricky Linderman, whose icy cold stare is enough to make Moody and his gang throw in the towel and take off. It was a great moment for Clifford and for Carson, as they both were able to stand up to Moody with the comfort of Ricky being there. Clifford proudly announces: ""Moody, I'd like you to meet my bodyguard. Anything you want to say to me, you have to go through him first."" Carson has the pleasure of getting up in Moody's face, giving him the finger and saying ""You owe me a years worth of lunches.""But Clifford finds out that getting Ricky to remain his bodyguard won't be easy. After bailing Clifford out of the spot he had gotten into with Moody and his gang, Ricky returns to his normal outsider-self who has nothing to do with Clifford and being a ""team."" But Clifford is adamant about getting Ricky to become his friend and even goes to the somewhat dangerous lengths of following him through the rough Chicago streets until Ricky catches on to him and stops him. But despite what Clifford says, there's just no getting through Ricky, at least until Clifford finds himself lost and needs Ricky's help to get out of the Chicago streets. This is where the friendship begins. They spend their time walking and talking about their families, Ricky shows Clifford his rebuilt motorcycle, they spend time visiting while walking through junkyards looking for the correct part he needs for his motorcycle, and they finally go for an exhilarating ride together through Chicago. Clifford brings Ricky back to their hotel to meet his family and have dinner, and Clifford, Ricky, Carson, and Shelly (Joan Cusak) start eating lunch together at school and enjoying each other's company.But Moody is about to crash the party with his own bodyguard; an tan-skinned, bald-headed beef-machine named Mike whose job is to harass Ricky and kick the hell out of him. Mike taunts Ricky, pushes him around, kicks him and punches him; even tries breaking his motorcycle. But despite Mike's abuse, all Ricky gives him in return is a dull stare and watches as Moody takes his motorcycle and rolls it into the nearby pond. And of course, Clifford speaks the same thoughts that are running through the viewer's minds: ""Why didn't you fight?"" Well, the answer lies in the confession that Ricky expresses to Clifford one night in a busy subway station after Clifford had got on him about his attitude. When Ricky tells Clifford what really happened between he and his little brother with the gun, we start to see why Ricky chooses to keep things bottled up and refuses to fight. Ricky obviously does not want to hurt anyone and tries to stay away from everyone. In Ricky's words: ""I let everybody down."" In reality, Ricky is letting himself down.Eventually, we as movie critics come to realize how much Ricky and Clifford needed each other. And this help for one another led them to engage in a huge knock-down-drag-out schoolyard brawl to end the movie. With Ricky's help, Clifford learns to find the strength to fight back. And let's just say that Clifford helps re-arrange Moody's nose a bit. With Clifford's help, Ricky is able to get his feelings off his chest and then as if being released from jail, cuts loose on Moody's bodyguard, Mike. Clifford's friendship and lending ear helped break the emotional chains around Ricky and enabled him to find the strength within him to be a young man again. So in the end, we have two young men that with each other found the way to escape from their fears.Okay, so I did my sugary-sweet spiel. But hey, the story is a good one and perfect for the family. And as a female I have to say that I enjoy seeing Adam Baldwin in this movie. The character he plays may look grungy, but he's still very good-looking! He's one heck of a great actor too; very underrated. One of his best and most intense scenes was during the confession to Clifford in the subway station. The first time you see it, you won't forget it. What a very realistic performance. And for you Matt Dillon fans; especially the gals, you'll like watching this film to catch a glimpse of that adorable face. But you know, he played his character Moody so well that I was too busy hating Matt in this movie to enjoy him (haha!) Another thing, call me crazy or whatever, but I actually like the music in this movie. It's very innocent, very dated, but kind of enjoyable.So without further ado, I highly recommend this movie. It was filmed in 1980, so it is quite a nostalgia trip, but a very enjoyable one. This is for all ages. Watch it with your kids, watch it with your siblings, watch it with your parents, your grandparents, boyfriends or girlfriends, husbands or wives. And make it a movie on the top of your list any time of the year.",5,"""Is That Peach Or Peachy?""",1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,9725,"['days', 'school', 'shootings', 'became', 'epidemic', 'rival',

(In time, she starred in many other roles, and is well known for her phone commercials).High schooler Clifford Peach, accustomed to a sheltered background, is bullied by Moody and his crew. He is extorted, teased, tripped, and once blindfolded and forced into a locker. At another time, garbage is thrown on his clothes in his locker. The principal is of minimal help.Clifford attempts to hire John Linderman, a tall fellow, as a bodyguard, but the latter isn't interested. But, gradually they open up to each other, and become friends. Clifford locates a cylinder that enables Linderman to finish his home-built motorcycle. They go on rides together. In time, Linderman relates a horrible personal secret to Clifford.There is place for humor in this film. They use a telescope, in Peach's hotel room, to look at heavenly bodies. But these are not celestial objects. They are women in tall buildings located some distance from the hotel.Clifford has conquered his problem with bullies--or so it seems. But if Clifford can get a bodyguard, so can Moody, his old nemesis. And so there is the inevitable fisticuffs between the bodyguards.

Moore,"[35, 36]","It's a commentary on the Year 2001 (and not a pleasant one) that My Bodyguard, made in 1980, now seems almost as old-fashioned as Boy's Town. Sure, an occasional curse word crosses the lips of the teen characters in this movie, and boogers and toilets are mentioned in passing. But even the school bully isn't a sex-crazed moron, and no one is shown doing distasteful things to mice, apple pies or hair mousse. It's just the sweet, likable story of Clifford Peache, a nice, smart kid bullied by a nasty school clique led by the loathsome Melvin Moody, and Ricky Linderman, the hulking loner with a violent reputation whom Clifford hires to protect him from Moody and his thugs. Clifford and Linderman become pals, Clifford learns Linderman's dark secret, and both learn a great deal from each other about friendship and courage when Moody tries to double-cross them. That's all there is to the movie, except for a subplot about Clifford's harried hotel-manager father (Martin Mull) and raffish grandmother (Ruth Gordon). It's no masterpiece, but it is pleasant and surprisingly memorable, thanks largely to the touchingly real performances of the teen stars. Adam Baldwin, who made his film debut here, is outstanding as Linderman; why he hasn't had a better subsequent career is utterly beyond me. I also have no idea why Chris Makepeace's career was essentially over by 1985. Only Matt Dillon has had a real star career--undoubtedly because he was the only one with leading-man looks. Director Tony Bill makes good use of the Chicago locations, and Joan Cusack also had her film debut here in a small role.",4,"A sweet, old-fashioned movie about teen friendship.",997488000,"08 11, 2001",2001,1608,"['commentary', 'Year', '2001', 'not', 'pleasant', 'one', 'My', 'Bodyguard', 'made', '1980', 'now', 'almost', 'as', 'old-fashioned', 'Boy', 'Town', 'Sure', 'occasional', 'curse', 'word', 'lips', 'teen', 'characters', 'movie', 'boogers', 'toilets', 'are', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'even', 'school', 'bully', ""n't"", 'sex-crazed', 'moron', 'one', 'shown', 'doing', 'distasteful', 'things', 'mice', 'apple', 'pies', 'hair', 'mousse', 'just', 'sweet', 'likable', 'story', 'Clifford', 'Peache', 'nice', 'smart', 'kid', 'bullied', 'nasty', 'school', 'clique', 'led', 'loathsome', 'Melvin', 'Moody', 'Ricky', 'Linderman', 'hulking', 'loner', 'violent', 'reputation', 'whom', 'Clifford', 'protect', 'Moody', 'thugs', 'Clifford', 'Linderman', 'become', 'pals', 'Clifford', 'Linderman', 'dark', 'secret', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'other', 'friendship', 'courage', 'when', 'Moody', 'double-cross', 'movie', 'subplot', 'Clifford', 'harried', 'hotel-manager', 'father', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'raffish', 'grandmother', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'masterpiece', 'pleasant', 'surprisingly', 'memorable', 'thanks', 'largely', 'touchingly', 'real', 'performances', 'teen', 'stars', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'here', 'outstanding', 'Linderman', 'why', ""n't"", 'had', 'better', 'subsequent', 'career', 'utterly', 'also', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Chris', 'Makepeace', 'career', 'was', 'essentially', '1985', 'Only', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'had', 'real', 'star', 'career', 'undoubtedly', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'leading-man', 'looks', 'Director', 'Tony', 'Bill', 'good', 'use', 'Chicago', 'locations', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'also', 'had', 'film', 'debut', 'here', 'small', 'role']",N/A

226412,A3USZM6HYVCIRZ,6300247309,Roger M. Longo,"[7, 7]","The movie is well done with a fine cast. What makes it unusual is the manner in which it deals with some fundamental elements in the ""coming of age process."" One of the themes one can chart throughout a life cycle is the evolution of the concept of power. One finds that in the elementary grades where power is physical and individualistic. The mindset atthis point is ""whose the tuffest kid in the class."" As one moves towards high school the notion of power becomes redefined into a more social framework such as team sports (football, basketball, etc.). It still deals with the physical domain of power, but more social (team efforts sanctioned by the institutional structure, i.e., the school). However there is a class divide that exists within the schools. Those who come from middle class families are more readily moved forward towards college and the professions. Those who are disenfranchised do not. The realization of this on the part of the disenfranchised can lead to hostility expressed in the form of physical threats. This is the nub of the movie. A bright student comes to an inner city school and finds himself the target of a formidable group of bullies. Realizing that he is no physical match he decides that the way to deal with this delemma is trump his tormentors by finding someone even more menacing. At first the potential bodyguard is reticent and dismisses the offer, but eventually the two are drawn together by circumstances and become friends. The result of the friendship is the focus of the movie: the evolution of each of these characters as a result of their interaction with one anther. Needless to say, the bullies are vanquished in the end and the two main characters (the ""geek"" and his bodyguard)continue to evolve well beyond the point of their first encounter. The movie is also a bit unusual in the sense that it treats the psychological motiviation of the ""bodyguard"" at a deeper level that one might expect from a teen movie. It's well done and the cast is excellent with a story told in a very believable fashion.",4,"My Bodyguard: Social Class, Inner City School Environments, and Personal Growth",1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2060,"['movie', 'well', 'done', 'fine', 'cast', 'What', 'unusual', 'manner', 'fundamental', 'elements', 'coming', 'age', 'process', 'One', 'themes', 'one', 'can', 'chart', 'life', 'cycle', 'evolution', 'concept', 'power', 'One', 'elementary', 'grades', 'where', 'power', 'physical', 'individualistic', 'mindset', 'atthis', 'point', 'tuffest', 'kid', 'class', 'one', 'towards', 'high', 'school', 'notion', 'power', 'becomes', 'redefined', 'more', 'social', 'framework', 'such', 'team', 'sports', 'football', 'basketball', 'etc.', 'still', 'physical', 'domain', 'power', 'more', 'social', 'team', 'efforts', 'sanctioned', 'institutional', 'structure', 'i.e.', 'school', 'However', 'class', 'divide', 'schools', 'who', 'come', 'middle', 'class', 'families', 'are', 'more', 'readily', 'moved', 'forward', 'towards', 'college', 'professions', 'who', 'are', 'disenfranchised', 'not', 'realization', 'part', 'disenfranchised', 'can', 'lead', 'hostility', 'expressed', 'form', 'physical', 'threats', 'nub', 'movie', 'bright', 'student', 'inner', 'city', 'school', 'target', 'formidable', 'group', 'bullies', 'Realizing', 'physical', 'match', 'way', 'deal', 'delemma', 'trump', 'tormentors', 'finding', 'someone', 'even', 'more', 'menacing', 'first', 'potential', 'bodyguard', 'reticent', 'offer', 'eventually', 'two', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'circumstances', 'become', 'friends', 'result', 'friendship', 'focus', 'movie', 'evolution', 'characters', 'result', 'interaction', 'one', 'anther', 'Needless', 'say', 'bullies', 'are', 'vanquished', 'end', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'geek', 'bodyguard', 'continue', 'evolve', 'well', 'point', 'first', 'encounter', 'movie', 'also', 'bit', 'unusual', 'sense', 'psychological', 'motiviation', 'bodyguard', 'deeper', 'level', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'teen', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'cast', 'excellent', 'story', 'told', 'very', 'believable', 'fashion']",N/A

Actually, I didn't run around in junkyards either (although I liked to crawl through drainage pipes as a young lad).'My Bodyguard' is a pretty simple story of a kid who is bullied at school.  There's more to it, but that is your synopsis in a nutshell.Every parent should make their kid watch this movie as just about every kid is, at one time or another, laughed at or picked on somewhere along the way when growing up.  The difference being, most parents don't have the guts to tell their kids to stick up for themselves and beat the hell out of someone who makes them feel inferior in some sense.Maybe you don't need to see the movie and just need to make your kids read my review.  When someone is trying to act tough around you and bully you or one of your best friends, there are three simple steps to take:1.  Walk right up to them and get in their face and stare at them when you tell them to put up or shut up.  I'd say a good eight inches from their face is a good distance.  Most of these morons are just starving for attention and need to act a certain way to get that attention, so they'll balk at the suggestion anyway.2.  When they don't do anything but back pedal and stutter, you tell them if there's anymore b.s. coming from their mouths or if you hear any b.s. has continued when you're not around, you're going to punch them in the face.3.  Punch them in the face anyway.  That's the problem with bullies, their parents obviously didn't do a very good job of raising them, so you need to do some parenting of your own.  Nothing stops until you take action yourself and give them what they truly deserve.Two punks in Junior High and 1 in high school got exactly what they deserved 16-17 years ago and Moody and Mike got what they deserved in the park at the end of this fantastic, realistic movie.It makes you feel good when you do it.
