That same day he goes back to his home-town Big Eden and reencounter with the ghosts from the past , a.k.a his best friend from highschool who he was in love with. Yep, this is a GAY MOVIE.The movie has a slow rithm and it increases near the end. For a low-budget film, it has a great quality on performances, location, photography, etc.Whether you are gay or straight, this movie is a must-seen. For one part, is about family, love and search for happiness and as much as idealist the movie is, it show us that is possible to be tolerant and accept the fact that there's gay people who look for happiness and a long term relationship. We will be aware that a lot of situations on this movie are ficticious and hard to believe, full of excesive-sweetness but who cares? It show us what a lot of people wants to see(including me) a place where you could be with the person you love without having to worry about what people say about sexual preferences, go where you want...in brief, a perfect place, like an Eden. That's the whole point.By the end, you'll think that everything is possible...The DVD features two DVD's, the second one includes a lot of features like the challenge of filming a gay movie in a rural town. Excelent presentation, great features, interviews, a lot of trailers from wolfe movies, and even cooking recipes!

694554,A1MEZNNYI5MQHG,B0000639HT,"Amazon Customer ""darshan1""","[12, 14]","This film struck me as a more sophisticated and realistic (and not AIDS-phobic) version of the film, Jeffrey. The magical quality that everyone is more than accepting of gay love is found in this film in a tiny town in Montana. There is a love triangle: Henry, home from NY to take care of his grandfather; Dean, the athletic, allegedly straight heartthrob that Henry has been swooning over for 10-20 years; and Pike, a painfully shy native-american who secretly loves Henry. What would make an interesting debate is Dean's motivation. On the surface it appears that Dean is gay and loves Henry, but is either unable to accept himself or unable to come out and risk losing custody of his two young children. The first possibility seems unlikely considering the completely loving atmosphere surrounding them. The second is perhaps more plausible, but is not something the movie explores at all. A very rare, almost unheard of act is one where a straight man loves his best friend so much that he tries to go through the motions of ""being gay"" for him, and the fact that he (Dean) can't be what Henry wants is, at least temporarily, heartbreaking. Although, perhaps this point is unclear, it's true that the human heart can be less than understandable as well.

694556,A2U4UOBD0705V4,B0000639HT,"AndrewCF ""Andy""","[2, 11]","This stale fairy tale may just be the most grossly overrated gay film I've ever seen.  Get this:  a painter (Arye Gross) who hails from a drink water town, Big Eden, in the Montana mountains (every camera angle is a breathtaking vista) has achieved a certain measure of success living in New York (his work has inexplicably been accepted by the Whitney, but he paints stars that look like they belong in Disney's Fantasia - i.e., hardly cutting edge) must go back home to care for his ailing Zampa (George Coe, in a one-note performance).  It seems he fled Big Eden when his friendship/romance with his high school buddy (Tim DeKay) tanked and the friend married a woman (the screenplay is quite vague on past issues).  Conveniently, the buddy shows up in town at the same time.  In the meantime, the Native-American (Eric Schweig) who runs the general store is terminally shy and suffers from an unrequited love for the painter;  every time the painter comes in, he stutters and runs into the kitchen (no one seems to think this behavior is strange, including the painter).  The NA decides to learn how to cook in order to impress the painter, but is too mortified to take credit for his meals (are you saying ""huh?"" yet?).  The plot hinges on whether the painter will renew his affair with his high school buddy or take up with the mooning, moody NA.  Guess?Big Eden appears to be situated on the outer banks of the Twilight Zone.  It is populated entirely by the gay-friendly; even the flannel-shirted red necks who frequent the general store and the busybody church ladies are sympathizers.  To his credit, writer/director Thomas Bezucha never uses the word ""gay"" once.  His characters, meant to be charmingly idiosyncratic a la Northern Exposure are merely dull and unrealistic.  The soundtrack is replete with country music chestnuts (to drive one mad, no doubt); there is no k.d. lang to be found in this universe.  In fact, you will not find any blips on your gaydar.  Really?Arye Gross simply plays his character sullen and stiff; he interprets his character to be immune to the gay flair of NYC, one guesses.  He has no erotic or even romantic spark.  Tim DeKay has the physicality that his role requires but not much else; sexual longing is translated into buddy-buddy hugs and impatience.  There is a laughable pantry scene between the exes in which the pent-up hurt and frustration should ignite, but Bezucho sadly underwrites the scene as if he were afraid it would become melodramatic rather than cathartic; the result: the audience is left clueless. Eric Schweig, the rather doughy NA (nice hair, though) radiates no sexuality - his persona is morose, befuddled and off-putting.  He only comes to life in a scene where he relates an Indian fable, which is completely out of character.  Wasted are a now-fat Louise Fletcher (""wasted"" describes her acting career after Cuckoo's Nest), whose part consists of puppy-dog looks of empathy, and the once-formidable, bitchy Nan Martin, who has nothing much to work with here.  The cast is listed in alphabetical order, as if this was an ensemble piece, but since Gross is in nearly every scene, this is a strange idea.This movie just feels juvenile and untested, without the courage of its convictions.

694558,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,B0000639HT,anna-joelle,"[22, 30]","Two reasons I bought this DVD: 1) the sweet and romantic storyline and 2) Eric Schweig (I'll watch any movie with Eric in it). I think the only other ""gay"" themed movies I've watched so far are ""Birdcage"" and ""M. Butterfly"" - one a comedy, the other a tragic drama. But ""Big Eden"" is a beautiful romance, set in modern-day Montana.Many reviews have already touched on the plot of ""Big Eden"", so I'll just comment on my personal observations of the characters, DVD features and other trivia.1) IMO, both Arye Gross and Eric Schweig share great screen chemistry as ""Henry Hart"" and ""Pike Dexter"", respectively. Pike is a head taller than Henry and I feel that if there must be a ""dominant"" partner in any relationship (gay/not), Pike would be the one. He's evidently the stronger of the two although he's more silent, painfully shy and perhaps more sensitive. Henry is sensible, vulnerable but very cheerful and romantic. There's a cute scene (before Henry realizes his true feelings) which takes place in Henry's kitchen. Pike has just delivered dinner to him, and Henry (who is doing the dishes, I think) asks Pike to stay for dinner. Pike shyly declines and Henry presses him on to stay. Then Pike nervously says OK, but he has to go home to feed his dog first. Henry was pleased and he says ""OK"", and then he returns to the kitchen sink and Pike just stands by him and I just couldn't help smiling and thinking: gosh, that scene is so sweet and ""domestic""! You really do want these two to find romantic bliss together!2) All the actors did a brilliant job - to me, the standouts are Arye Gross, Eric Schweig, Louise Fletcher (""Grace"") and Nan Martin (""Widow Thayer"").3) There are 2 passionate kissing scenes... one involving Henry and Dean (the local ""boy"" whom Henry had loved for the past 20 years) and the other (a ""hotter"") scene with Henry and Pike. I think people who have ""problems"" watching gays kissing should avoid watching/reviewing this movie altogether. People like the movie critic, Roger Ebert for example, who gave this movie only 2-stars. Ebert wrote that the last scene (which is the kissing scene) was ""... painfully overdone.... When you lay it on too thick, the audience is distracted by implausibility..."" Come on, the whole movie has shown us just how warm and loving the community of Big Eden is and how accepting the people are with gay issues. Heck, these people are the ones who bring the two guys together. So I think there's nothing ""overdone"" or ""implausible"" about the public kissing! Another observation: Ebert seems to have no problem with lesbian love scenes (read his glowing review of the movie ""Mulholland Drive"").4) The DVD comes in a 2-disc format. The movie itself is in Disc 1 (it has Henry's face on the cover). There is a Scenes Selection feature but no subtitles are available. Disc 2 has Pike's face on the cover and contains some great featurettes e.g. theatrical trailer, deleted scenes and interviews with the director, producer and actors.5) I like it that in the story, Henry and Pike are of different races. As there're more barriers to overcome, it makes their coming together that much more sweet and real. Arye Gross commented in the Interview that because Henry and Pike are from different cultures, they have more to offer each other in the relationship. The director, Tom Bezuckha actually decided to write Pike's character as a Native American only in the end i.e. after the script was finished.6) Some viewers will complain that there's no place like Big Eden in the real world; that it's too good to be true; that it's all purely the director's fantasy. Well, if that's the case, then how sad! All the more reason why we need more positive movies like ""Big Eden"" with the hope that after watching them, people (wherever they are in the world) will open their mind and heart and accept the differences that exist among people. You know, that life may eventually imitate art.7) This movie is great for many reasons.

Big Eden is a small town where people look out for each other and have big hearts. That they do so in a completely beautiful mountains and lakes environment may not be merely coincidence.Henry Hart is a successful artist in New York City. He misses his gallery opening because he got a phone call that his grandfather, Sam Hart, has had a stroke and he must go to Big Eden right away. The gallery owner is furious, but she gets over it eventually and even makes a trip up to Big Eden.Henry is gay, but has never told his grandfather. It seems one of the main reasons he left 20 years ago was that Dan Stewart, on whom he had a great crush, rejected him. Now Dan is back, newly divorced and with custody of his two adorable sons. Right away we know there is going to be pain.Henry can't cook and so he makes arrangements with Pike Dexter, who runs the local pretty-much-everything store (modern version of a general store, complete with a circle of old guys who make it their social club), to have the Widow Thayer cook for them and he, Pike, will deliver the meals. But the widow wants to fry everything, and of course Sam is not allowed to have fried food, or added salt, or a lot of other things he likes. He gets more and more cranky, until Pike gets the idea to learn to cook so he can be the one who cooks for them. Pike feeds the widow's meals to his dog, and eats them himself when he can.Why does Pike not tell Henry that he's doing the cooking, and that it's all for love of him? Because Pike is a big, quiet, shy Indian, and he simply cannot say anything.At first, the widow tries to set Henry up with all the local single girls, but they figure it's pretty obvious he's gay, and so she tries to set him up with all the local gay men. After she finds out that Pike is doing the cooking, she and the old boys who hang out at Pike's store conspire to keep his secret, but they know all about it.I'm not going to tell any more, except to point out that there's nothing of homophobia or gay bashing or anything in it. There's a very out-of-closet lesbian couple in down who seem to be well liked. These people are just simple folk who figure love is love and they don't put people down for it.

694567,A26L2EQ97ML3OW,B0000639HT,"""bruce452""","[5, 5]","Big Eden arises from a startling concept by its creator:  a universe in which there are no homophobes, in which the straights are not even slightly antagonistic to the gays in their midst.  In this movie, every single pea-pickin' one of the heteros are encouragers and enablers to their gay neighbors.  The only homophobia in Big Eden is that internalized by the town's two gay men (and one bi) and even that is partly just commitment phobia.The result is an hilarious send-up of small town America, a paradise in which the good old boys who loiter at the general store all day squabble over whose turn it is to make the cappuchino and their different readings of the moves the gays are putting on each other.  Every time you think the homophobic sh-t is going to hit the fan, it doesn't.  If you're like me, this topsy-turvy state of affairs will have you rolling on the floor laughing your head off at times and bawling your eyes out at others.  If the real world were like this, I'd go thru my days giggling non-stop.The supporting cast is excellent, particularly George Coe as Sam, the dying grandfather, Louise Fletcher as Grace, an aptly named character, and O'Neal Compton as Jim Soams, the solicitous if not too perceptive leader of the bucolic gang down to the general store, perfectly cast against type (you'd expect to see him as a bigoted Southern sheriff).  The scene in which Soams tries to find a way to ask Pike if he is 'one of them' is hilarious.The principals are unfortunately somewhat less interesting than the supporting cast.  Arye Gross as Henry Hart is such a distant character throughout most of the film, it's difficult to care much whether he finds love.  Eric Schweig as Pike Dexter is also cast against type, though less successfully than Compton; he has an imposing physical presence and is good at glowering, staring at the floor and running from the room, but the character is too much of a caricature; we get to know him more from what others say of him than what he shares of himself.  Tim DeKay as Dean is perhaps the least likeable character in a film in which it's hard to find someone not to like.  Henry's high school crush, Dean has held on to his school-boy good looks and is newly divorced.  Throughout the film he waffles over whether to get a new set of his-n-hers towels, or his-n-his.  He provides a little tension in a love story which nevertheless remains not very interesting.  Henry is clearly too hurt by what happened in the past to renew the love.But the real core of the film is not the love story, which is not only not very captivating but also wrapped up a bit to easily at the end, but the themes of 'coming home to who you are' and 'being known.'  Just days before he dies, Sam calls Henry to sit beside him on the sofa and complains 'you won't tell me who you are,' and 'I can't help thinking your grandma and I didn't do right by you some how' because of Henry's resistance to being known and accepting the love of the townsfolk.  Henry doesn't get it, though, until it's too late.These are the real discoveries Henry makes by returning home to Big Eden.The soundtrack is excellent: simple, classic country songs, only a couple of which I could identify without watching the credits closely, which perfectly speak to the complexities which bedevil most lives.  The setting of the film is, of course, magnificent.I give Big Eden 5 Stars in the ratings system, though I would prefer to give it 4.5, downgrading it only for the lack of a more interesting, better told love story.  Still, it is an excellent and very entertaining film and I highly recommend it.",5,A delightful fairy tale - no pun intended.,1021852800,"05 20, 2002",2002,3619,"['Big', 'Eden', 'arises', 'startling', 'concept', 'creator', 'universe', 'are', 'homophobes', 'straights', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'slightly', 'antagonistic', 'gays', 'midst', 'movie', 'single', 'pea-pickin', 'one', 'heteros', 'are', 'encouragers', 'enablers', 'gay', 'neighbors', 'only', 'homophobia', 'Big', 'Eden', 'internalized', 'town', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'one', 'bi', 'even', 'partly', 'just', 'commitment', 'phobia.The', 'result', 'hilarious', 'send-up', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'paradise', 'good', 'old', 'boys', 'who', 'loiter', 'general', 'store', 'day', 'squabble', 'turn', 'make', 'cappuchino', 'different', 'readings', 'moves', 'gays', 'are', 'putting', 'other', 'time', 'think', 'homophobic', 'sh-t', 'going', 'hit', 'fan', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'topsy-turvy', 'state', 'affairs', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughing', 'head', 'off', 'times', 'bawling', 'eyes', 'out', 'others', 'real', 'world', 'were', ""'d"", 'go', 'thru', 'days', 'giggling', 'non-stop.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'George', 'Coe', 'Sam', 'dying', 'grandfather', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Grace', 'aptly', 'named', 'character', ""O'Neal"", 'Compton', 'Jim', 'Soams', 'solicitous', 'not', 'too', 'perceptive', 'leader', 'bucolic', 'gang', 'down', 'general', 'store', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'type', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'bigoted', 'Southern', 'sheriff', 'scene', 'Soams', 'find', 'way', 'ask', 'Pike', ""'one"", 'hilarious.The', 'principals', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'somewhat', 'less', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Arye', 'Gross', 'Henry', 'Hart', 'such', 'distant', 'character', 'most', 'film', 'difficult', 'care', 'much', 'love', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'Pike', 'Dexter', 'also', 'cast', 'type', 'though', 'less', 'successfully', 'Compton', 'imposing', 'physical', 'presence', 'good', 'glowering', 'staring', 'floor', 'running', 'room', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'caricature', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'others', 'say', 'what', 'shares', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'Dean', 'perhaps', 'least', 'likeable', 'character', 'film', 'hard', 'find', 'someone', 'not', 'like', 'Henry', 'high', 'school', 'crush', 'Dean', 'held', 'school-boy', 'good', 'looks', 'newly', 'divorced', 'film', 'get', 'new', 'set', 'his-n-hers', 'towels', 'his-n-his', 'little', 'tension', 'love', 'story', 'nevertheless', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'Henry', 'clearly', 'too', 'hurt', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'renew', 'love.But', 'real', 'core', 'film', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'very', 'captivating', 'also', 'wrapped', 'up', 'bit', 'easily', 'end', 'themes', ""'coming"", 'home', 'who', 'are', ""'being"", 'known', 'Just', 'days', 'Sam', 'Henry', 'sit', 'beside', 'sofa', ""'you"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'grandma', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'right', 'how', 'Henry', 'resistance', 'being', 'known', 'accepting', 'love', 'townsfolk', 'Henry', ""n't"", 'get', 'though', 'too', 'late.These', 'are', 'real', 'discoveries', 'Henry', 'returning', 'home', 'Big', 'Eden.The', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'simple', 'classic', 'country', 'songs', 'only', 'couple', 'could', 'identify', 'watching', 'credits', 'closely', 'perfectly', 'speak', 'complexities', 'bedevil', 'most', 'lives', 'setting', 'film', 'course', 'magnificent.I', 'give', 'Big', 'Eden', '5', 'Stars', 'ratings', 'system', 'would', 'prefer', 'give', '4.5', 'downgrading', 'only', 'lack', 'more', 'interesting', 'better', 'told', 'story', 'Still', 'excellent', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

694569,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0000639HT,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 5]","Big Eden is a small jewel of a film. I will point out three strengths of the film after giving a very brief synopsis of the film.The film is about a young artist who has suceeded by the New York artworld criteria. He has a gallery, one-person shows, and is collected by contemporary museums such as the Whitney. His grandfather that reared him has had a stroke and so he misses his own one-person show openning reception to fly to Montana to be with his grandfather. There he runs into two men with whom he grew up. The first is Pike Dexter, a handsome Native American man who runs the general store. The second is Dean Stewart, who is Henry's best friend from high-school and secret love for 20 years. The film revolves around Henry's growing attachement to one of these men and his ability to let go of attachment to the other.There were three themes that were well developed in the film.First, the film creates a world free of homophobia, and thus the title Big Eden has multiple meanings. Cowboys and little church ladies are all incredibly supportive of a budding gay love affair.Second, the film deals with the fascinating process of attraction and insecurity, the repulsion and attraction, that happen between couples. I was reminded greatly of E.M. Forrester's Room with a View by the interactions in this film. Whereas the young couple in Room with a View are highly attracted to each other, those around them must continually open doors and smooth the way for the romance to grow. This is much like Big Eden where 7 cowboys, a little busy-body church lady, and Henry's own grandfather all conspire to connect Henry to Pike as they all become aware of the attaction Pike has for Henry and the need to end the sage of Henry's attraction fantasy to Dean.Third, the film does a very good job of revealing how interpretation of the past and future influence our current perceptions. Henry, an artist, should be very perceptive, yet he only gradually sees the beauty in Pike and Pike's desire for him. His eyes are opened to Pike as his expectations for Dean wither.All the acting is well done and the scenery is beautiful.

694574,A39GVH8DH1JDXU,B0000639HT,Daniel White,"[0, 0]","Big Eden (2002) Wolfe VideoIs that ""Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes""?  Well, this gay film is going to be different!  Director Thomas Bezucha allows your questions to drift away.  As his story unfolds; you find yourself in a beautiful world.  Here, everything is as it should be.  Like a true magician, he focuses your attention away from questions.  His talented slight of hand brushes aside homophobia and racism.  Filmed inside Glacier National Park, the beauty of nature instills a sense of awe.Big Eden fulfills the purpose of a myth with a homespun approach and quite humor.  Even without the tired ""victimization of oppression"", intimacy is hard to deal with.  No time to waste being divisive, this deals with real issues and problems we create for ourselves with our fantasies.  At the same time it gives us a glance of a future that really is not that far off.  The splendor of nature is unpredictable, so is this film.Henry Hart (Arye Gross), an artist just making a name for himself in New York City.  He is a sad sack that things just seem to happen to.  He can't quite get a handle on his life.  Gross allows inanimate objects to fight his every move. The day before opening his major exhibit, a call from Montana changes everything.  The grandfather, Sam, who raised him, has had a stroke.  Against the advice of his manager and best friend Mary Margaret (Veanne Cox), he hops a plane, flies across the country, and crashes headlong into his past.The town of Big Eden is a gentler version of ""Twin Peaks"" inhabited with the nice kind of odd people.  They are all part of our hero.Sam Hart, (George Coe) built every house in the town.  He stands by his work.  He doesn't see a stroke as a reason to retire, or change what he eats!The school teacher Grace (Louise Fletcher) sings in the church choir and is afraid of nothing.  She is a family friend and confidant.  Grace is the embodiment of the love to be found here. This woman can see right through you and still enjoy the view.  (Completely countering Fletcher's historic part of Nurse Ratchet in ""One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest"").The Widow Thayer, (Nan Martin) sees no reason for people to be alone.  Her mission is a matchmaker.  There is no stopping her.  Not really a busy body, she is just willing to work to get friends to meet.  She is glad to offer advice and cooking, although both might be questionable.Pike, (Eric Schweig) owns the general store.  He is shy and unsure of himself. He can hardly look people in the eye without stammering.  The ""guys"" who hang out on the porch all day long feel obligated to protect him.  While goofing off, they run interference. They learned to use his fancy coffee maker and  like kids, argue over who gets to make the next cappuccino!  Pike appears to want a quiet life, and stays to himself.  He talks more to his dog Frances then to any customer.  Is this what he wants, or is it just safe and all he can hope for?  Either way, he is quick to simply and politely, turn his back and disappear.Not at all like the outgoing and playful Dean, (Tim Dekay).  He was the high school jock and once, Henry's crush.  Everybody knew the boys were close. Dean, now divorced, moved back into town with his two little boys.  The kids take to Henry and we can tell Henry is still ""carrying a torch"".  Is Dean only being friendly or is he making the moves on our hero?  What is he up to, does he even know? More importantly, what is he able to do?The Mayor (Corinne Bohrer) is a single mother, how is she going to fit into this equation? She has a demure smile but watch out, she plays a mean fiddle!Henry's long distance life line is Mary Margaret. She does her best reminding him Dean is straight, period!  How many years of therapy did it take to get over him?  She wants what is best for her friend but as a manager, she wants him back in New York!Now, here comes Widow Thayer with an entire chess team to visit Sam and Henry!  Where did that come from? Don't worry; Bezucha has just the right shot and old song that explains everything.Impressive visuals don't overpower this funny ""coming to terms"" film.  Henry's art is abstract, but nature provides the stunning backdrop to the reality that he must face.The music list reads like the best of country music.  George Jones, Dwight Yoakam, Buck Owens, Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, David Allan Coe, and Lori White are carefully picked to guide us through the emotional backgrounds.No ""twinks"" or half naked gym rats. No sex scenes - even implied, and only a couple of kisses.  You won't feel uncomfortable watching with your mother or grandmother.  If you are looking for homophobia, or teen suicide, or racial prejudges, look elsewhere.  Plenty of films focus on those themes.Big Eden's message is simple: When everything else you did is wrong, what is left for you to do was right all along!  One of those right things is to see this film for pure enjoyment.  Watch the breathtaking beauty, tap your foot with the music, and share the unexpected happiness with a friend.  The character of Jim sums it up best when he says: ""There are so few nice suppresses in life.  ""Seems to me its kind of a shame to squander one of them don't you think?""",5,"Nature is unpredictable, so is this film.",1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,5200,"['Big', 'Eden', '2002', 'Wolfe',

I went with a friend to catch this movie and we both said the same thing leaving the cinema----gotta have that on dvd!  Bascially, this story is an old fashioned romance about a young man that returns to his home town to deal with a family matter and comes face to face with the man he loved for years but without reciprocation.  The town, with its kind and accepting people, is most definitely a fictional locale but that gives the film an almost fairy tale (no pun intended) like quality.  The story is universal---a prodigal son returning, dealing with family and friends and eventually finding the love that he wants, though not necessarily from who he expects.

Beautifully shot with great landscape photography, it's a rare find for a 'gay themed' movie to have no gratuitous sex scenes - simple, tender affection is shown to enhance the story. Also the use of late 30's early 40's actors in the principle roles is novel - ordinary 'folk' falling in love. There are no young, hip 'fashionable' gay men to be found here and that is a big plus. A special mention should be made of the DVD - a 2 disc set packed with extra features like audio commentary, deleted scenes, interviews, behind the scenes footage and even recipes from the film. Whilst the presentation of the extra features doesn't compare to the big studio releases, kudos to Wolfe Video for including them.

Absolutely no negative energy surrounds this guy.  He's out, and absolutely no one has a problem with it, even in a small, rural town (not your typical NYC-style anything-goes mentality).  The worst problem he has to worry about is whether he should respond to the advances of a guy he had a crush on in high school who now has two kids.Alas, what will Harry do?  He clearly still retains some unresolved feelings for this high school guy... and he doesn't even know that this other guy holds a torch for him, to the point of cooking him and his grandfather wonderful meals every single day.  What to do, what to do?....Not to say I totally disliked this movie.  It was kinda cute watching a big, strapping hunk act all coy and shy around his love interest.

The 'making of' documentary was especially enjoyable, because of the enthusiasm of everyone involved in this ambitious but seemingly simple little movie.As for the movie itself, I could have done without all the country music, but the documentary reveals that those songs helped inspire the movie, so I suppose I should be grateful for that.

Having said that it's not the worst way to spend an evening!My 'biggest' problem with big Eden centers on one key point: the relationship between Henry (Arye Gross) and his high-school boy ""crush"" Dean (Tim DeKay), who now has kids and a divorce behind him. While I think Henry deserves all the sympathy he can get, Dean does not: He's arrogant, indecisive and manipulative. You get the sense that their relationship (as it were) is driven solely by Henry's longing and strong emotional attachment that rekindles itself when Henry returns to his hometown to deal with family business and ""re-center"" his life back in NYC where he's a successful artist.Meanwhile, there is a charming and potentially fulfilling relationship waiting for Henry, if only he can open his heartto another man from his hometown.

It's a wonderful idea and a pretty good fairy tale, but I didn't find the relationships credible, and some of the actors don't apparently have the ability to carry off this rather brilliant idea.I doubt very seriously that the people in a small Montana town would encourage a homosexual relationship, but that's what makes the idea of this movie so much fun. I never bought into the passion between the main character and his childhood buddy. The actor who plays Henry, the lead character, is limited in his expression. The other actors do much better. Personally, I'd never believe that a successful artist with a fabulous loft in Brooklyn Heights would give it all up to move back to a town he desperately tried to escape after high school. The cabin he returns to, where his grandfather lives, is essentially a faux rustic palace.

After viewing ""Big Eden"" I found that I could not.  I found it impossible to accept, on any level, a film that I feel to be nothing but pure hokey fantasy.  Maybe, I've become too cycnical and bitter.  Yet, I have enjoyed films such as Broadway Damage and Broken Heart Club.I just don't buy the story of ""Big Eden"".  Come on people!  Where in Montana (or any other sparsley populated area)can two gay men dance together (and be encouraged to dance together, by the town-folk)at a public square dance? Where in any small American town (or even a large one) do old crotchety straight men sit around drinking coffee, smoking and plotting how to bring two guys together by encouraging one of the men involved to learn to cook for his man?In addition to the above, I found the film to be poorly acted.  Not one, of the actors, was (to me) believable in his or her role--Louise Fletcher being the worse! If this film didn't have a gay theme, it is so hokey that it could have been made by the ""Focus on the Family "" group in Colorado Springs, Colorado. (drafters of Amendment Two) or any other fundamentalist religious group.I know, I know that the world would be a better place if, indeed, there was a place like Big Eden.

694598,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0000639HT,Get What We Give,"[13, 17]","Big Eden is a film that is just about perfect when addressing its subject matter and delivering the goods to the viewer.Harry is a middle aged, successful artist living in New York City.  Harry just happens to be gay and single.  He does not have luck in the love department.  On the eve of his first big show, he learns that his only living relative - his grandfather - has had a stroke.  Harry rushes to his side in the town where Harry grew up - Big Eden.  (I don't remember being told where Big Eden is supposed to be, although in the extras the director divulged that it was shot in Montana).  Big Eden is an itty bitty town in an absolutely idyllic setting.  I am fully prepared to move to that town.When Harry returns to his hometown, he is informed that the love of his life, Dean, has moved back to town, divorced and with his two sons in tow.  Harry is somewhat devastated in that he didn't know that Dean had ever married or had kids.  Harry has been burning a torch for Dean for about twenty years.  Though the exact nature of their former relationship is never truly defined, we get a good idea of what it must have been - flirtation of youthful men who knew that they dared not cross a line and become physical.Big Eden (the film) is a fantasy of sorts.  It is set in a reality that exists just beyond our true vision - slightly beyond our peripheral.  The characters are real and ....not.  The town locals who seem to do nothing more than sit in and in front of the local store, are a cast of scruffy male characters without a judgmental or prejudiced bone in their body.  Again, the director/writer Bezucha stated that he wanted to portray a life for a gay character where all the hurdles that homosexuals state exist - do not.  And if those hurdles were removed, what would the gay man's life be like?  Would it be carefree and happy and fulfilled?  Probably more to the truth, as this films tells, it would still be rife with heartache and a bevy of other emotions, because in the end, we are all human and our lives are not meant to be simple and carefree - gay or straight.Arye Gross is really quite believable, if not a bit too doe eyed at times as Harry.  Eric Schweig, as ""Pike,"" the Native American owner of the general store is really quite amazing in his portrayal.What makes this movie truly amazing is that it doesn't answer the questions you want answered in a simple or laid out way.  You have to glean from your own perspective some of the answers.  It's an intelligent film with a heartwarming center and covered up in really excellent actors, who, sadly, you may or may not have ever heard of, but will surely recognize as you watch this film.I am very thankful for a film about a middle aged gay man going through the same sort of ""relationship"" or ""emotional"" issues that I am at roughly the same age as me.  I really enjoy the ""coming of age"" and ""coming out"" films that are currently out there, but I've long since passed that time of my life.  I needed a film that addresses me as a middle aged gay man - without the hovering doom of AIDS as a component - and ""Big Eden"" is almost perfect in that respect.  I have been, for some time, contemplating moving to a small town in New England or in the West - someplace where I could get to know my neighbors and become a part of the community - a community of real friends.Ultimately, I think that is what ""Big Eden"" espouses.  With a community of real, trusted, loving, and caring friends, you can't go wrong.  Those friends don't neccessarily have to be of the same sexual orientation, gender, race, sex or political affiliation in order for you to be loving and loved.You really have to watch this film.

694599,A1J39MAMRGHZ5Y,B0000639HT,"giovannif7 ""giovannif7""","[100, 102]","Big Eden is a romantic fantasy for mature souls. This warm, wonderful film taps into the universal emotional drives for family, love, and a place to call home. Audiences at numerous film festivals have taken to heart the Everyman characters created by some exceptional performers, guided by the writing and direction of Thomas Bezucha.The story revolves around Henry Hart.  He's a transplanted New Yorker - an artist on the verge of major success in the big city.  As he readies for his big gallery show, a call comes from his hometown.  His grandfather, the man who raised Henry after the death of his parents, has had a stroke.  Henry, despite the protests of his friend/agent, hops the first plane back to Montana, and quickly becomes thrust back into the lives of the small community he had left years before.As he integrates back into the Big Eden community, Henry has to cope with helping his grandfather adjust to his medical condition, as well as dealing with the curiosity and interference of the well-meaning locals.  The standout is the Widow Thayer, who is enlisted to do the cooking for Henry and his grandfather, but who takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Henry.Henry's most-anticipated reunion is with Dean, his best friend from high school, and not-so-secret crush.  Dean has also recently returned to town following his divorce, and is very happy to rekindle his friendship with Henry.  Other familiar faces from Henry's past include Anna, the mayor of the town, and Pike, the painfully shy, enigmatic owner of the general store.As Henry and Dean begin to re-explore their relationship, another potential romantic partner surfaces, and the whole town becomes aware of the situation.  Rather than exploding with intolerance and homophobia, the townsfolk become conspirators and cheerleaders for everyone to wind up in happy relationships, regardless of orientation.Much of the criticism of this film involves the unlikelihood that small-town America would be as open-minded and supportive as the members of the Big Eden community when it comes to the issue of same-sex relationships.  This would be a valid point in a documentary, but Big Eden is a fictional location.  It should not be any more difficult to accept this dramatic convention than it is to accept that Dorothy can visit Oz after a bump on the head, or that Julia Roberts can be rescued from a life of prostitution by a mogul who looks like Richard Gere.Big Eden is the type of wonderful surprise that keeps me returning to the Outfest film festival year after year.  Many of the movies I see there are formulaic and forgettable, but every now and then a fresh new perspective pops up on screen, and reminds me of how an enjoyable film can create a world filled with characters and relationships that entertain, and stay with you.  This was my reaction to Big Eden, as well as many other audience members at Outfest, judging from our conversations afterwards.If your idea of the perfect gay film involves near-naked gym bunnies looking for their next sex partner or drug high, do yourself a favor and skip Big Eden.

The screening was attended by director Thomas Bezucha, who fielded questions from the enthusiastic audience afterward.  I saw it again during its general release and for over a year I have eagerly anticipated the DVD.  Big Eden grows better with repeat viewing, a sign of rare quality.There is a trick to enjoying this film: abandon your cynicism.  There are no political statements here (except the general one that we CAN get along); there are no histrionics; the film is gratefully free of controversy and artsy pretension; and the characters are allowed to be (and look) imperfect.  This is a simple story about the many ways love expresses itself, from Henry taking care of his grandfather, to Pike falling in love with Henry, and the entire town caring for one another.  This film is suffused with the many kinds of human love which make life worth living.  As such, this film is a welcome change from some of the depressing, lurid fare independent film fans are used to having forced upon us.  Bezucha directs this film, his first, with calm professionalism and sensitive simplicity.  The quality of the production values belies the fact that this film was shot on a shoestring budget.Is this a realistic value of acceptance in small town America?  Not entirely.  However, this film was shot in a rural setting not unlike the fictional one of Big Eden--and the fact that the overwhelming majority of citizens supported the production augers well for the real-life Big Edens of the future.Wolfe Video has provided a strong DVD presentation, with plenty of extras, from the usual director's commentary, to a selection of recipes from the film.  The picture quality is excellent, well defined with deep color saturation.  The sound is clear and dimensional, although Bezucha's insightful commentary is not always clear over the dialogue.  One minor complaint, Wolfe Video has not provided subtitles of closed-captioning.  Considering the large number of hearing-impaired gay people, this should be standard.For those who wish to be shocked, angered or titillated, there are already a plethora gay themed films that accomplish that.  Big Eden offers gay film's first old-fashioned, heart warming love story.

But what makes it interesting is of course the subject, gay love, a love affair among gay men in the heart of a small community in Montana. We have all the essential elements of a good heart-breaking and heart-rejoicing story. The father who is going to die, the relatives and friends of the community to which the son comes back from New York who are helpful, friendly and over comprehensive to the point of deciding to help. Then an old best friend who had been very friendly in the past in High School arrives too, divorced with two little boys under his custody. The attempt at reopening the closed file fails because that best friend of old does not seem to accept to abandon all his habits of thinking and behaving and to just delve into the love that is proposed to him. But thanks to the villagers another love appears fast, the main hero and the Indian manager of the General Store and diner. This Indian is in cooking and he is manipulated into cooking for the son and the father when the father is back home from hospital. And a love affair car start there. This cross-cultural relationship makes it all the more impressive because to be gay is like to be an Indian in a small community, or as for that in a big one: it is difficult to assume because it is a minority situation but it has to be accepted by the concerned people first of all. One cannot be free in society if they are not free in their heads first of all. Then the film can close on a long kiss in the midst of the locals.

Some of them center on ""unbelievable, unrealistic, no small town in Montana would ever act that way."" But they miss an important point about this film. If our goal someday is to build a society that accepts all people for who they are, then we need to support those positive images on our movie screens as much as possible. Thomas Bezucha's vision provides us a beautiful fable and beautiful images in the film called ""Big Eden"".""Big Eden"" is about Henry Hart, struggling to find the important things in life, realizing those things are in the community that raised him as a child. Traveling back to Big Eden, Montana, to care for his ailing grandfather allows him to confront issues in his life that he spent many years running away from. Landing back home, surrounded by people that devotely love him, becomes emotionally overwhelming for him, and his struggle only intensifies. Throw in his best friend/unrequited love, and new potential love in Eric Schweig's incredible performance as Pike. As Henry falls deeper into Big Eden's web, he finds himself discovering answers, and even more questions.Give Bezucha credit for a gutsy script. Here is a gay film that breaks many rules of ""gay filmmaking"": there is no sex, there is no 20 year old cute boy walking around shirtless, no club scene, no drugs, no homophobic country hicks in trucks ready to pounce at first light. He gives us straight and gay characters who believe and act as people first, who are allowed the intimate, complex lives we all should have. He gives us a town that celebrates all the good things in life: companion, love, honesty, compassion, without fear of labels. Mostly, he gives us a story, some incredible characters that we absolutely love, and sets it in some of the most beautiful scenery captured on film in recent years.Three cheers for Big Eden, it's one step in the right direction.",5,Eden on Earth,1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,1970,"['been', 'interesting', 'hear', 'read', 'comments', 'film', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'friends', 'center', 'unbelievable', 'unrealistic', 'small', 'town', 'Montana', 'would', 'ever', 'act', 'way', 'miss', 'important', 'point', 'film', 'goal', 'someday', 'build', 'society', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'need', 'support', 'positive', 'images', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'Thomas', 'Bezucha', 'vision', 'beautiful', 'fable', 'beautiful', 'images', 'film', 'called', 'Big', 'Eden', 'Big', 'Eden', 'Henry', 'Hart', 'struggling', 'find', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'realizing', 'things', 'are', 'community', 'raised', 'child', 'Traveling', 'back', 'Big', 'Eden', 'Montana', 'care', 'ailing', 'grandfather', 'confront', 'issues', 'life', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'running', 'away', 'Landing', 'back', 'home', 'surrounded', 'people', 'devotely', 'love', 'emotionally', 'overwhelming', 'struggle', 'only', 'Throw', 'best', 'friend/unrequited', 'love', 'new', 'potential', 'love', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Pike', 'Henry', 'deeper', 'Big', 'Eden', 'web', 'discovering', 'answers', 'even', 'more', 'questions.Give', 'Bezucha', 'credit', 'gutsy', 'script', 'Here', 'gay', 'film', 'many', 'rules', 'gay', 'filmmaking', 'sex', '20', 'year', 'old', 'cute', 'boy', 'walking', 'around', 'shirtless', 'club', 'scene', 'drugs', 'homophobic', 'country', 'hicks', 'trucks', 'ready', 'pounce', 'first', 'light', 'straight', 'gay', 'characters', 'who', 'believe', 'act', 'people', 'first', 'who', 'are', 'allowed', 'intimate', 'complex', 'should', 'have', 'town', 'good', 'things', 'life', 'companion', 'love', 'honesty', 'compassion', 'fear', 'labels', 'Mostly', 'story', 'incredible', 'characters', 'absolutely', 'love', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'captured', 'film', 'recent', 'years.Three', 'cheers', 'Big', 'Eden', 'one', 'step', 'right', 'direction']",N/A

694614,A1QHEQII6QRVND,B0000639HT,J.G.,"[0, 2]","""Big Eden"" is a sweet film which takes place in the beautiful mountains of western Montana. The scenery is perhaps the best part of the film. The characters (portrayed by actors in what seems like a reunion of actors who played in past ""Golden Girls"" episodes) are also very likeable, which makes the film easy to watch despite the story being a bit disjointed. I'm guessing the story is a semi-autobiographical tale by the filmmaker. I only wished he had been clearer in the plot. I really had no idea who was who and what was what, but like I said the characters were so likeable I didn't really care. I also knew from the reviews that the film had a happy ending and after watching so many depressing, self-loathing gay movies like ""Angels in America"" and ""Ladder Days,"" I was willing to sit it out. However, one has to make a lot of assumption while watching this film since the storyline is not that clear. Sometimes, at least in my case, the assumptions are wrong. I won't say what they were to avoid giving away the story. I thought the romance with the Indian, however, came out of left field. It was cute and sweet, but at what point does the protagonist fall in love? Gay love stories often lack a clear connection between the two lovers; I suppose to speed up the plot. I will say that many of the reviews on here of this film are unfair in saying that the film is unrealistic because it portrays small town America in a gay-friendly light. It's really sad that so many of us have been brainwashed into thinking that America is such a homophobic, hateful society. It's truly sad that we have been duped into thinking we can only validate ourselves only if we are victims. In fact, much of the central western states such as Wyoming and Montana are very libertarian and gay-friendly. The small cities of Montana and Wyoming have openly gay mayors and sheriffs. I don't think CNN will cover much about that. They are more interested in reinforcing the stereotype that everyone in America is oppressed and suffering. I think the films that depict people as homophobic violent thugs, such as in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" are more unrealistic than this one, which portrays a friendly town where the residents are concerned for everyone's happiness, including the gay ones. I know gay people who live in the Missoula area of Montana, and they attest the film is actually quite realistic. I was once even invited to a ""gay party"" in Missoula much like the old lady gave in the film. Unfortunately I could not make it. I would recommend this film because it's sweet, well-acted and for the scenery.I would also recommend watching the Director's Commentary version of the film which comes with the DVD. It's intersting to hear what the director had to say about the making of the film. Much of what I wrote above is affirmed by the director himself. He points out that most America has no idea just how tolerant and accepting places like Montana are. He talked about filming inside Glacier National Park, and how even the rangers were open and supportive of his project. Even the local straight men--tough mountain men--were eager to participate in the film. Most of the extras in the film portraying gay men are actually straight. In one scene you can even see the guy's wedding ring. The director constantly lambasts the ""liberal gays"" from places like New York City who have an elitist contempt for anything west of New Jersey.",3,"Sweet, entertaining",1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,3428,"['Big', 'Eden', 'sweet', 'film', 'place', 'beautiful', 'mountains', 'western', 'Montana', 'scenery', 'perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'actors', 'what', 'reunion', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'past', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'likeable', 'film', 'easy', 'watch', 'story', 'being', 'bit', 'disjointed', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'story', 'semi-autobiographical', 'tale', 'filmmaker', 'only', 'wished', 'had', 'been', 'clearer', 'plot', 'really', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'said', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'likeable', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'also', 'knew', 'reviews', 'film', 'had', 'happy', 'ending', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'depressing', 'self-loathing', 'gay', 'movies', 'Angels', 'America', 'Ladder', 'Days', 'was', 'willing', 'sit', 'out', 'However', 'make', 'lot', 'assumption', 'watching', 'film', 'storyline', 'not', 'clear', 'Sometimes', 'least', 'case', 'assumptions', 'are', 'wrong', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'were', 'avoid', 'giving', 'away', 'story', 'thought', 'romance', 'Indian', 'however', 'came', 'left', 'field', 'was', 'cute', 'sweet', 'what', 'point', 'protagonist', 'fall', 'love', 'Gay', 'love', 'stories', 'often', 'lack', 'clear', 'connection', 'two', 'lovers', 'suppose', 'speed', 'up', 'plot', 'will', 'say', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'film', 'are', 'unfair', 'saying', 'film', 'unrealistic', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'gay-friendly', 'light', 'really', 'sad', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'brainwashed', 'thinking', 'America', 'such', 'homophobic', 'hateful', 'society', 'truly', 'sad', 'have', 'been', 'duped', 'thinking', 'can', 'only', 'validate', 'ourselves', 'only', 'are', 'victims', 'fact', 'much', 'central', 'western', 'states', 'such', 'Wyoming', 'Montana', 'are', 'very', 'libertarian', 'gay-friendly', 'small', 'cities', 'Montana', 'Wyoming', 'have', 'openly', 'gay', 'mayors', 'sheriffs', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'CNN', 'will', 'cover', 'much', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'reinforcing', 'stereotype', 'everyone', 'America', 'oppressed', 'suffering', 'think', 'films', 'depict', 'people', 'homophobic', 'violent', 'thugs', 'such', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'are', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'one', 'friendly', 'town', 'where', 'residents', 'are', 'concerned', 'everyone', 'happiness', 'including', 'gay', 'ones', 'know', 'gay', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'Missoula', 'area', 'Montana', 'attest', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'realistic', 'was', 'once', 'even', 'invited', 'gay', 'party', 'Missoula', 'much', 'old', 'lady', 'gave', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'could', 'not', 'make', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'sweet', 'well-acted', 'scenery.I', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'version', 'film', 'DVD', 'intersting', 'hear', 'what', 'director', 'had', 'say', 'making', 'film', 'Much', 'what', 'wrote', 'above', 'affirmed', 'director', 'out', 'most', 'America', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'tolerant', 'accepting', 'places', 'Montana', 'are', 'talked', 'filming', 'inside', 'Glacier', 'National', 'Park', 'how', 'even', 'rangers', 'were', 'open', 'supportive', 'project', 'Even', 'local', 'straight', 'men', 'tough', 'mountain', 'men', 'were', 'eager', 'participate', 'film', 'Most', 'extras', 'film', 'portraying', 'gay', 'men', 'are', 'actually', 'straight', 'one', 'scene', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'guy', 'wedding', 'ring', 'director', 'constantly', 'liberal', 'gays', 'places', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'who', 'have', 'elitist', 'contempt', 'anything', 'west', 'New', 'Jersey']",N/A

I can't believe this movie has been around more than a decade and I was unaware of it. The local gay social group showed it on Movie Night last Monday (July 30, 2012). I'm so grateful. I will tell everyone that this is Brokeback Mountain, but only with a happy ending. People who know Aristotle's Poetics know what I mean; in the end, there's a very thin line between a great tragedy and a great comedy. Both Big Eden and Brokeback Mountain are GREAT films, but I'll watch Big Eden more. I'm also grateful about the attention to detail, constructing one sequence of scenes around hands for instance, another about sounds. And the fact that the screenplay never dishonors its debt to classic (Plautus and Terrance classic, that is) comedy. The mix of people of all ages, at all stages of life. The schtick with the ""seven dwarves"" is wonderful. And wrapping it all up with all the joined couples dancing. Classic. And I'd like to add a short note on the 'unrealistic' aspects of the story. Some great works of art ask the question, what if... What if the world were black and white? (photography) What if we view the world as shapes instead of subjects? (abstract art) And, in the case of Big Eden, what would a community be like if we remove one cultural element--prejudice against homosexuals? The Big Eden argument is, people would still be human. It would still be about love, and community, and food, and relationships, and getting through together because that's the only way we can get through. In the end, I'm reminded of E. M. Forster's response to his close friends about Maurice. It was not uncommon for his manuscript readers to respond, ""But that's not what it's like. You know it; we know it."" Forster responded, in essence, 'my book, my ending' (then forbad it being printed until after his death). There you go. A wonderful movie--full of wonder.

But how different they are.  Latter Days is a film which touches upon the sore points of gay existence-- the disapproval of blood relations (and homophobia in general), dogmatic religion, AIDS, the seductiveness of a superficial lifestyle, coming out, achieving balance in an unapproving wider society; and engages these points directly.  Big Eden is a fable, a delightful fairy tale: it takes place in the aptly named small town of Big Eden, Montana: a town where homophobia appears not to exist at all, where gay townsfolk are protected and treasured by their neighbors-- where old widow women and weatherbeaten cowboys actively play matchmaker, and meddle with only the best intentions. Henry, a native of the town, now a successful artist in New York, is called home to care for his grandfather.  Also newly back in town is his high school best-friend, Dean, for whom he carried a torch all those years, but who was straight.  Dean is married-- a father-- and now divorced, curious, and confused.  The local general store is run by Native-American Pike, who also knew Henry as a boy-- and who has secretly harbored love for him.  Pike is bighearted and a man of few words... and when his friends realize he is in love with Henry, they are deeply sympathetic, and only worried Pike will get hurt.  They also care for Henry.  The absence of homophobia, of the omnipresence (elsewhere) of AIDS, allows us to focus on these three men and the human issues they share with all of mankind-- love, fear of rejection, uncertainty of what one truly wants.  The townspeople are delightful:  Nan Martin, as the delightful Widow Thayer, may be a busybody, but she is one with only the best intentions and without any malice.  When Henry returns she throws him a party- with all the eligible young ladies she can rustle up.  When the error of her judgment becomes clear, she intrepidly throws him another party-- with all the eligible young MEN she can corral. The actors are uniformly superb-- the performances a delight--- and like all good fables, there is a warm, happy ending.  Someday, in public, in front of their whole towns, gay people may be able to dance together, and kiss, as their straight counterparts do without giving it another thought.  Not soon-- not here in America, in the present climate of increasing repressiveness, with our president vociferously against gay rights and plebiscites voting to deny gays the right to marriage--  but somewhere, someday.

When his beloved grandfather has a stroke, he reluctantly puts his career on hold and moves back to his small hometown in Montana to care for him. Once there, he finds that, while the people are a little older, not much has changed in the years he's been gone. He reconnects with old friends, including his best friend (and secret crush) from high school, Dean.Widow Thayer is the town busy-body, and she's taken it upon herself to prepare meals for Henry's grandfather...and play matchmaker in the process. She attempts to set Henry up with every available woman in town, before it finally dawns on her that he is gay. It doesn't slow her down for a second. She just shifts her match-making skills into same-sex mode.As Henry and Dean explore their relationship, Pike enters the scene. Pike is a sweet, shy man who runs the local general store. The whole town can see that Pike has a crush on Henry, but Henry seems oblivious, too caught up in his crush on Dean and his dying grandfather to barely notice the man who delivers their meals. The townspeople begin to work to push Pike and Henry together, but will their plan succeed or will Henry return to New York?This movie is a charming fairy tale. Would all the citizens of a tiny Montana town be as open-minded as the residents of Big Eden? Only in a perfect world, but taken in the context of a fictional movie, it illustrates how different our world could be if everyone wasn't so hung up on sexuality. Like its Biblical namesake, Big Eden is a paradise of sorts, a place free from homophobia and hate. I thought the cast did a remarkable job of bringing the story to life, and while the movie bogs down a bit in the middle, I thoroughly enjoyed it as a whole.",4,A Sweet Fairy Tale,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,1792,"['Henry', 'up-and-coming', 'artist', 'toast', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'art', 'world', 'When', 'beloved', 'grandfather', 'stroke', 'reluctantly', 'career', 'hold', 'back', 'small', 'hometown', 'Montana', 'care', 'Once', 'there', 'people', 'are', 'little', 'older', 'not', 'much', 'changed', 'years', 'been', 'gone', 'old', 'friends', 'including', 'best', 'friend', 'secret', 'crush', 'high', 'school', 'Dean.Widow', 'Thayer', 'town', 'busy-body', 'taken', 'prepare', 'meals', 'Henry', 'grandfather', 'play', 'matchmaker', 'process', 'set', 'Henry', 'up', 'available', 'woman', 'town', 'finally', 'gay', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'second', 'just', 'shifts', 'match-making', 'skills', 'same-sex', 'mode.As', 'Henry', 'Dean', 'explore', 'relationship', 'Pike', 'scene', 'Pike', 'sweet', 'shy', 'man', 'who', 'local', 'general', 'store', 'whole', 'town', 'can', 'see', 'Pike', 'crush', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'oblivious', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'crush', 'Dean', 'dying', 'grandfather', 'barely', 'notice', 'man', 'who', 'meals', 'townspeople', 'begin', 'work', 'push', 'Pike', 'Henry', 'together', 'will', 'plan', 'succeed', 'will', 'Henry', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'charming', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Would', 'citizens', 'tiny', 'Montana', 'town', 'be', 'as', 'open-minded', 'residents', 'Big', 'Eden', 'Only', 'perfect', 'world', 'taken', 'context', 'fictional', 'movie', 'how', 'different', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'everyone', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'hung', 'up', 'sexuality', 'Biblical', 'namesake', 'Big', 'Eden', 'paradise', 'sorts', 'place', 'free', 'homophobia', 'hate', 'thought', 'cast', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'life', 'movie', 'down', 'bit', 'middle', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'whole']",N/A

I was pretty sure that would not be the case with Big Eden. I really wanted to like it, really!The filmmakers obviously had great intentions and thematically it's an interesting story. The cinematography is beautiful with terrific locations.Just imagine . . . a beautiful little town where being gay didn't matter one whit to anyone. Imagine that your hunky straight best friend from high school valued your friendship so much that he really wished that he could return your romantic interest - to the point where he was even willing to give it a try. (yah right) There are plenty of affectionate townfolk, quirky characters, and more. Jeeeze, I really wanted to like this set-up. A gay oriented movie that isn't actually ABOUT being gay.Unfortunately the two leads are chemistry free.  Not a good thing.  Ayre Gross can be an very engaging actor in the right part, but here he certainly isn't. He's just plain whiney.The hunky best friend was really the only character who was moderately appealing.  It mystifies me how this movie got cast this way - Gross's romantic interest is a big lunky dour acting guy that barely speaks. If you must see this, rent it or buy it on the used marketplace.Many reviewers have given this movie high marks and I can understand that because it's well intentioned -the kind of movie gay and gay friendly audiences would really, really like to see more of.  I suspect that many reviewers are rating the possibilites this film represents rather than the actuality of it.Too bad it didn't wind up being an engaging movie after all but maybe it'll help make better ones in the future possible.",1,A big disappointment.,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,1762,"['Normally', 'buy', 'movie', 'hate', 'will', 'hang', 'couple', 'years', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'different', 'time', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'Big', 'Eden', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'really', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'had', 'great', 'intentions', 'thematically', 'interesting', 'story', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'terrific', 'locations.Just', 'imagine', 'beautiful', 'little', 'town', 'where', 'being', 'gay', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'whit', 'anyone', 'Imagine', 'hunky', 'straight', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'valued', 'friendship', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'wished', 'could', 'return', 'romantic', 'interest', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'even', 'willing', 'give', 'try', 'yah', 'right', 'are', 'plenty', 'affectionate', 'townfolk', 'quirky', 'characters', 'more', 'Jeeeze', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'set-up', 'gay', 'oriented', 'movie', ""n't"", 'actually', 'ABOUT', 'being', 'gay.Unfortunately', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'chemistry', 'free', 'Not', 'good', 'thing', 'Ayre', 'Gross', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'engaging', 'actor', 'right', 'part', 'here', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'just', 'plain', 'whiney.The', 'hunky', 'best', 'friend', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'moderately', 'appealing', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'cast', 'way', 'Gross', 'romantic', 'interest', 'big', 'lunky', 'dour', 'acting', 'guy', 'barely', 'must', 'see', 'rent', 'buy', 'used', 'marketplace.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'high', 'marks', 'can', 'understand', 'well', 'intentioned', '-the', 'kind', 'movie', 'gay', 'gay', 'friendly', 'audiences', 'would', 'really', 'really', 'see', 'more', 'suspect', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'rating', 'possibilites', 'film', 'rather', 'actuality', 'it.Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'engaging', 'movie', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'help', 'make', 'better', 'ones', 'future', 'possible']",N/A

It's not that it's the best gay themed movie I've ever seen, but I just get caught up in rooting for the characters. In this mythical place of Big Eden, it's not about whether you're queer or not, but that you have someone to love and in return, they love you. You have a few concurrent themes going on here. One would be the unrequited love(s) of our youth;did I really love him as a boy/teen, or was it just friendship/hormones? Then you have the theme of an older mentor/relative getting ready to pass on and whether or not you've told them something important about your core self that you think they should know. Finally, you have the theme of baggage that all of us queers carry through life and how it can affect us day-to-day. We try so hard to connect with other souls in this life and so often we just become estranged because of all the 'stuff' we carry inside. This movie not only explores the possibilities out there, but bolsters the time-honored notion that sometimes, our soul mates are right under our noses. The best part of this movie for me anyway, is that the denizens of this town don't trivialize queer relationships, or for that matter any relationships.

Henry Hart (Arye Gross), is a painter getting ready for a big show in New York City when he learns that his grandfather, Sam Hart (George Coe), who raised him after the death of his parents, has suffered a stroke.  Over the protests of his agent, Mary Margaret Bishop (Veanne Cox), he returns immediately to Big Eden, Montana, the small town in which he was raised and where he never admitted he was gay.  Family friend Grace Cornwell (Louise Fletcher) changes everything when she tells Henry that Dean is back in town.  This would be Dean Stewart (Tim DeKay), Henry's best friend from high school and for twenty year's the object of his heart's desire.  Henry catches up on Dean's story, learning his old friend has been married, is now divorced, and has custody of his two young boys.  Dean appears to be as happy to see Henry as Henry is to see him, and this makes the unthinkable a possibility.The local busybody, Widow Thayer (Nan Martin), lines up all of the single women in town for Henry, and when she learns he is gay turns right around and sets up a ""Chess Club"" meeting so Henry can be introduced to all of the single men as well.  But this is not enough to induce Henry to come out of the closet.  Meanwhile, Pike Dexter (Eric Schweig), who runs the local general store and has been making meals for Sam, suddenly finds himself making fancy meals and being even more tongue tied than usual when Henry is around.  Henry might not notice what has come over Pike, but Jim Soams (O'Neal Compton) and the rest of the guys sitting around the store certainly pick up on the signals and decide they should do something about it.  Also floating around town is Anna Rudloph (Corinne Bohrer), another romantic possibility despite her limited sexual orientation (she likes men).The thought that there is a small town in Montana where everybody conspires to set up a gay couple is unrealistic, although I would attribute that more to the mentality of small towns rather than a particular state.  Outside of geographical pockets in obvious metropolises like San Francisco and New York City, there are few places where such a story might seem like anything more than fantasy.  But then most romances are fantasies of a sort, and creating an idealistic corner of the country free from bigotry is not a bad place to imagine.  Another thing that this 2005 film has going for it is that its gay men are in their late 30s rather than their early 20s.  So ""Big Eden"" is not about buff guys running naked through some sort of metaphorical paradise, but about men looking for love.  In this film being held while crying is as important as any other physical manifestation of affection.This was the first film by writer-director Thomas Bezucha, whose second effort ""The Family Stone"" came out last year.  I was leaning towards rounding up on this film, but I was hoping for something more creative for the conclusion than the romantic commonplace that Bezucha trots out.  He came up with a more memorable ending for ""The Family Stone,"" but he failed to come up with anything new for the big finish of this one.  In any romantic film a key element is the grand romantic gesture and ""Big Eden"" does not really have one.  However, despite the predictable plot contrivances, it does have developed characters and some fine performances.  Gross is such a familiar face from dozens of television shows, that we are on his side from the start and his longing to share his life is palatable, while Coe has an especially nice moment when he tries to coax his grandson out of the closest.  But it is Sweig who stands out, taking the stereotype of the stoic Native American and giving a nuanced performance that makes the looks on his face a lot more important than whatever words he actually manages to speak.  These performances along are enough to make it an above average romance, despite its unconventional elements.",4,"Apparently you can go home again, even if you are a gay man from a small town in Montana",1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,4031,"['strength', 'Big', 'Eden', 'also', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'clearly', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'will', 'embrace', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'Henry', 'Hart', 'Arye', 'Gross', 'painter', 'getting', 'ready', 'big', 'show', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'when', 'grandfather', 'Sam', 'Hart', 'George', 'Coe', 'who', 'raised', 'death', 'parents', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'protests', 'agent', 'Mary', 'Margaret', 'Bishop', 'Veanne', 'Cox', 'immediately', 'Big', 'Eden', 'Montana', 'small', 'town', 'was', 'raised', 'where', 'never', 'admitted', 'was', 'gay', 'Family', 'friend', 'Grace', 'Cornwell', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'changes', 'everything', 'when', 'Henry', 'Dean', 'back', 'town', 'would', 'be', 'Dean', 'Stewart', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'Henry', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'twenty', 'year', 'object', 'heart', 'desire', 'Henry', 'up', 'Dean', 'story', 'learning', 'old', 'friend', 'been', 'married', 'now', 'divorced', 'custody', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Dean', 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'see', 'unthinkable', 'possibility.The', 'local', 'busybody', 'Widow', 'Thayer', 'Nan', 'Martin', 'lines', 'single', 'women', 'town', 'Henry', 'when', 'gay', 'turns', 'right', 'up', 'Chess', 'Club', 'meeting', 'so', 'Henry', 'can', 'be', 'introduced', 'single', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'enough', 'induce', 'Henry', 'come', 'closet', 'Meanwhile', 'Pike', 'Dexter', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'who', 'local', 'general', 'store', 'been', 'making', 'meals', 'Sam', 'suddenly', 'making', 'fancy', 'meals', 'being', 'even', 'more', 'tongue', 'tied', 'usual', 'when', 'Henry', 'around', 'Henry', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'what', 'come', 'Pike', 'Jim', 'Soams', ""O'Neal"", 'Compton', 'rest', 'guys', 'sitting', 'store', 'certainly', 'up', 'signals', 'decide', 'should', 'do', 'something', 'Also', 'floating', 'around', 'town', 'Anna', 'Rudloph', 'Corinne', 'Bohrer', 'romantic', 'possibility', 'limited', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'men', '.The', 'thought', 'small', 'town', 'Montana', 'where', 'everybody', 'set', 'up', 'gay', 'couple', 'unrealistic', 'would', 'attribute', 'more', 'mentality', 'small', 'towns', 'rather', 'particular', 'state', 'geographical', 'pockets', 'obvious', 'metropolises', 'San', 'Francisco', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'story', 'might', 'seem', 'anything', 'more', 'fantasy', 'then', 'most', 'romances', 'are', 'fantasies', 'sort', 'creating', 'idealistic', 'corner', 'country', 'free', 'bigotry', 'not', 'bad', 'place', 'imagine', 'thing', '2005', 'film', 'going', 'gay', 'men', 'are', 'late', '30s', 'rather', 'early', '20s', 'Big', 'Eden', 'not', 'buff', 'guys', 'running', 'naked', 'sort', 'metaphorical', 'paradise', 'men', 'looking', 'love', 'film', 'being', 'held', 'crying', 'as', 'important', 'other', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'affection.This', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Thomas', 'Bezucha', 'second', 'effort', 'Family', 'Stone', 'came', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'leaning', 'towards', 'rounding', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'more', 'creative', 'conclusion', 'romantic', 'commonplace', 'Bezucha', 'out', 'came', 'up', 'more', 'memorable', 'ending', 'Family', 'Stone', 'failed', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'new', 'big', 'finish', 'one', 'romantic', 'film', 'key', 'element', 'grand', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'Big', 'Eden', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'one', 'However', 'predictable', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'have', 'developed', 'characters', 'fine', 'performances', 'Gross', 'such', 'familiar', 'face', 'dozens', 'television', 'shows', 'are', 'side', 'start', 'longing', 'share', 'life', 'palatable', 'Coe', 'especially', 'nice', 'moment', 'when', 'coax', 'grandson', 'closest', 'Sweig', 'who', 'out', 'taking', 'stereotype', 'stoic', 'Native', 'American', 'giving', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'looks', 'face', 'lot', 'more', 'important', 'words', 'actually', 'speak', 'performances', 'along', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'above', 'average', 'romance', 'unconventional', 'elements']",N/A
694631,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0000639HT,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 9]","""Big Eden"" must represent an idealized reality. The tolerance and understanding shown seem like a place one would hope to find rather than a place that exists on the map. Even given that premise, it isn't good cinema, especially compared to ""Far From Heaven."" Arye Gross played Adam on the Ellen DeGeneres Show & had a small part in Spielberg's ""Minority Report."" Here his character Adam Hart is a wishy-washy self-involved guy who is profoundly untalented at reading other people. ""Last of the Mohicans"" actor Eric Schweig plays his love interest, Pike. There isn't much chemistry between these two. Most of the romance happens anonymously with Pike cooking gourmet dishes, passing them off as the Widow Thayer's. The other hole is Dean, played by Tim McKay who was an agent in ""Swordfish"" with John Travolta. Dean whacks Hart on the butt, keeps flinging his arm around him, and bear hugging. We get that he likes Hart, but what's going on is never articulated. Is Dean bi-sexual? Is he a hetero who's trying to be gay? Who knows? So the torch Adam carries for Dean for 20 years is nonsensical. Nan Martin as Widow Thayer is a great busybody.

694634,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B0000639HT,Libretio,"[17, 31]","BIG EDEN(USA - 2000)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalOn the verge of commercial success in New York, a lonely artist (Arye Gross) returns to his picturesque home town in Montana after his elderly grandfather (George Coe) falls ill. There, his feelings for the former high school jock (Tim DeKay) are reawakened, but True Love comes calling from totally unexpected quarters...Despite its good intentions and mainstream production values, writer-director Thomas Bezucha's feature debut is a huge disappointment. Adopting a tone similar to the quirky TV series ""Northern Exposure"" (but without the laughs), Bezucha struggles desperately to keep raw emotions from slipping into 'sentimentality' (when will filmmakers learn that Sentimentality Is Not A Bad Thing?!), and takes his sweet time steering a flimsy narrative towards its inevitable conclusion. There's actually a half-decent 90 minute movie struggling to emerge from this two-hour behemoth!Unlike most other gay films, in which handsome young bucks struggle with their sexuality against a backdrop of bigotry and oppression, BIG EDEN focuses instead on older characters who are already long-established within their sexual identities, though troubled by unresolved issues from their distant past. Hence, Gross' unease when confronted by former jock DeKay, now divorced with two kids, but still hunky enough to catch Gross' eye whenever he takes off his shirt. DeKay appears to have similar feelings for his old high school buddy, but his motives remain ambiguous right up to the 'dramatic' climax. Sadly, Gross doesn't do very much to warrant all the attention he receives, which makes it kinda hard to care one way or the other.But the film's major drawback is the character played by Eric Schweig, a hulking delivery guy whose passions have been thwarted by crippling shyness. A dab hand in the kitchen, and happiest when he's alone with his faithful dog, the character is meant to be sweet and endearing but, as conceived and executed here, he seems to be vying for the title of Dullest Man In The World, and there comes a point in the narrative when his refusal to interact with the very people who might facilitate his hearts' desire becomes an annoyance, to be pitied rather than indulged. And this is ERIC SCHWEIG, the huge Native American guy whose dynamic performances in the likes of SQUANTO: A WARRIOR'S TALE and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS (amongst many others) lifted those movies right off the screen. Talk about playing against type! As such, he and Gross spend the entire movie circling one another, while their friends and families offer encouragement from the sidelines, hoping they'll find the happiness they 'deserve' in each others arms. And not a homophobe in sight!!In terms of craftsmanship, BIG EDEN can't be faulted. Filmed on location in the Montana heartland, it's designed and photographed with exquisite grace, and the performances from a hugely experienced cast - including Louise Fletcher, George Coe and Nan Martin - are first-rate throughout. But Bezucha's approach to the material is so low-key, it simply lies there and dies there, making no dramatic impact whatsoever.NB. Incredibly, the MPAA has given the film a PG-13 rating for 'mature thematic material', and frankly, I'm at a loss to understand why. There's a few PG-level swear words, but no sex or nudity, and no violence. In fact, the ONLY thing which seems to have invoked the PG-13 appears to be a couple of scenes in which two guys share a loving kiss. That's it! Make of it what you will, but some observers have already taken the MPAA to task for their ultra-conservative approach to sex and sexuality, especially in gay-themed movies. And if they're prepared to issue a restrictive rating for little more than a KISS, can you imagine how they deal with stronger subjects intended for the R category?...",2,Gay romance takes sweet time going nowhere,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",2004,3879,"['BIG', 'EDEN', 'USA', '2000', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'DigitalOn', 'verge', 'commercial', 'success', 'New', 'York', 'lonely', 'artist', 'Arye', 'Gross', 'picturesque', 'home', 'town', 'Montana', 'elderly', 'grandfather', 'George', 'Coe', 'ill', 'feelings', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'jock', 'Tim', 'DeKay', 'are', 'reawakened', 'True', 'Love', 'calling', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'quarters', 'good', 'intentions', 'mainstream', 'production', 'values', 'writer-director', 'Thomas', 'Bezucha', 'feature', 'debut', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'Adopting', 'tone', 'similar', 'quirky', 'TV', 'series', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'laughs', 'Bezucha', 'desperately', 'keep', 'raw', 'emotions', 'slipping', ""'sentimentality"", 'when', 'will', 'filmmakers', 'learn', 'Sentimentality', 'Not', 'A', 'Bad', 'Thing', 'sweet', 'time', 'steering', 'flimsy', 'narrative', 'towards', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'actually', 'half-decent', '90', 'minute', 'movie', 'struggling', 'emerge', 'two-hour', 'behemoth', 'most', 'other', 'gay', 'films', 'handsome', 'young', 'bucks', 'struggle', 'sexuality', 'backdrop', 'bigotry', 'oppression', 'BIG', 'EDEN', 'instead', 'older', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'long-established', 'sexual', 'identities', 'troubled', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'distant', 'past', 'Hence', 'Gross', 'unease', 'when', 'confronted', 'former', 'jock', 'DeKay', 'now', 'divorced', 'two', 'kids', 'still', 'enough', 'catch', 'Gross', 'eye', 'whenever', 'shirt', 'DeKay', 'have', 'similar', 'feelings', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'buddy', 'motives', 'remain', 'ambiguous', 'right', 'up', ""'dramatic"", 'climax', 'Sadly', 'Gross', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'much', 'warrant', 'attention', 'kinda', 'hard', 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other.But', 'film', 'major', 'drawback', 'character', 'played', 'Eric', 'Schweig', 'hulking', 'delivery', 'guy', 'passions', 'have', 'been', 'thwarted', 'crippling', 'shyness', 'dab', 'hand', 'kitchen', 'happiest', 'when', 'alone', 'faithful', 'dog', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'conceived', 'executed', 'here', 'be', 'vying', 'title', 'Dullest', 'Man', 'World', 'there', 'point', 'narrative', 'when', 'refusal', 'interact', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'facilitate', 'hearts', 'desire', 'annoyance', 'be', 'pitied', 'rather', 'indulged', 'ERIC', 'SCHWEIG', 'huge', 'Native', 'American', 'guy', 'dynamic', 'performances', 'likes', 'SQUANTO', 'WARRIOR', 'TALE', 'THE', 'LAST', 'THE', 'MOHICANS', 'amongst', 'many', 'others', 'lifted', 'movies', 'right', 'off', 'screen', 'Talk', 'playing', 'type', 'such', 'Gross', 'spend', 'entire', 'movie', 'circling', 'one', 'friends', 'families', 'offer', 'encouragement', 'sidelines', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'find', 'happiness', ""'deserve"", 'others', 'arms', 'not', 'homophobe', 'sight', 'terms', 'craftsmanship', 'BIG', 'EDEN', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Montana', 'heartland', 'designed', 'photographed', 'exquisite', 'grace', 'performances', 'hugely', 'experienced', 'cast', 'including', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'George', 'Coe', 'Nan', 'Martin', 'are', 'first-rate', 'Bezucha', 'approach', 'material', 'so', 'low-key', 'simply', 'dies', 'there', 'making', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'whatsoever.NB', 'Incredibly', 'MPAA', 'given', 'film', 'PG-13', 'rating', ""'mature"", 'thematic', 'material', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'loss', 'understand', 'why', 'few', 'PG-level', 'swear', 'words', 'sex', 'nudity', 'violence', 'fact', 'ONLY', 'thing', 'have', 'invoked', 'PG-13', 'be', 'couple', 'scenes', 'two', 'guys', 'share', 'loving', 'kiss', 'Make', 'what', 'will', 'observers', 'have', 'already', 'taken', 'MPAA', 'task', 'ultra-conservative', 'approach', 'sex', 'sexuality', 'especially', 'gay-themed', 'movies', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'issue', 'restrictive', 'rating', 'little', 'more', 'KISS', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'deal', 'stronger', 'subjects', 'intended', 'R', 'category']",N/A

Newton,"[3, 3]","Most 'Gay Cinema' seems to deal with one of three main themes - being a drag queen; living with HIV/ dying of AIDS related illness; or dealing with an often painful/ traumatic coming out - first love scenario. All very worthy, but getting a bit boring quite honestly.So how refreshing to see Big Eden. The film concerns a successful (in terms of career, not love) artist, Henry Hart who is asked to return to his small home town in rural Montana - Big Eden - to help with his sick grandfather. He is unwilling to return in part because of his successful career, but in truth he uses this as an excuse not to go back so as to avoid painful memories. Of course he does return and so begins a new awakening for him, though perhaps re-awakening would be a better term to use.Having returned to Big eden he finds that the focus of his adolescent first, an un-requited love, has also returned to town with his two sons. He also strikes up a re-aquaintance with the painfully shy Pike, a local Native American storekeeper. Henry Hart re-adjusts to the slow and easy-going pace of life in Big Eden where people are just busy being nice and helpful to each other.The story develops and different aspects of the different characters emerge each with their own concerns and complexities. Henry slowly realises that the concern people have for him is not born out of a need for gossip, but genuine affection. He eventually manages to put the past behind him and finds love in probably the most unexpected quarter.Ok, so it's probably not like real life because in real life the lovely group of men who hang around Pike's store would be more likely to beat Henry up than embrace him as a member of their community. Perhaps though, that's where the beauty of Big Eden lies, it's a 'might be, should be' place that all of us want at some level - unconditional acceptance of who we are and who we choose to love.There are some great characters in this. I've already mentioned the chaps who hang around the store and Pike; but the grandfather is great and the Widow Thayer is not to be missed!",5,Simply Great!,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2076,"['Most', ""'Gay"", 'Cinema', 'deal', 'one', 'three', 'main', 'themes', 'being', 'drag', 'queen', 'living', 'HIV/', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'related', 'illness', 'dealing', 'often', 'painful/', 'traumatic', 'coming', 'out', 'first', 'love', 'scenario', 'very', 'worthy', 'getting', 'bit', 'boring', 'quite', 'honestly.So', 'how', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Big', 'Eden', 'film', 'successful', 'terms', 'career', 'not', 'love', 'artist', 'Henry', 'Hart', 'who', 'asked', 'return', 'small', 'home', 'town', 'rural', 'Montana', 'Big', 'Eden', 'help', 'sick', 'grandfather', 'unwilling', 'return', 'part', 'successful', 'career', 'truth', 'excuse', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'so', 'avoid', 'painful', 'memories', 'course', 'return', 'so', 'new', 'awakening', 'perhaps', 're-awakening', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'term', 'use.Having', 'returned', 'Big', 'eden', 'focus', 'adolescent', 'first', 'un-requited', 'love', 'also', 'returned', 'town', 'two', 'sons', 'also', 'up', 're-aquaintance', 'painfully', 'shy', 'Pike', 'local', 'Native', 'American', 'storekeeper', 'Henry', 'Hart', 'slow', 'easy-going', 'pace', 'life', 'Big', 'Eden', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'busy', 'being', 'nice', 'helpful', 'other.The', 'story', 'develops', 'different', 'aspects', 'different', 'characters', 'emerge', 'own', 'concerns', 'complexities', 'Henry', 'slowly', 'concern', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'born', 'need', 'gossip', 'genuine', 'affection', 'eventually', 'put', 'past', 'finds', 'love', 'probably', 'most', 'unexpected', 'quarter.Ok', 'probably', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'lovely', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'hang', 'Pike', 'store', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'beat', 'Henry', 'up', 'embrace', 'member', 'community', 'Perhaps', 'where', 'beauty', 'Big', 'Eden', ""'might"", 'be', 'should', 'be', 'place', 'want', 'level', 'unconditional', 'acceptance', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'choose', 'are', 'great', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'chaps', 'who', 'hang', 'store', 'Pike', 'grandfather', 'great', 'Widow', 'Thayer', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

But, this movie takes the viewer for a ride that's such a joy. It was a blessing I found this film.Not only are the lead actors fantastic. But, all the supporting players are great as well. This really is a great cast of awesome characters.But, it's really Pike who you'll root for and fall in love with. Pike is a very shy, introverted and withdrawn man who owns the general store in town. Once you see the story unfold, you begin to see what's underneath all of that shyness and introversion. I found Pike to be very sweet natured, generous and adorable. What I ADORED about Eric Schweig, who has the uncanny ability to let body language, intense eyes and facial expressions speak more than any verbal dialogue ever could,is the way he played this man. Pike wasn't played as the stereotypical Gay man.There's no trace of femininity in this man. It's refreshing to see that Gay comes in all colors, sizes and shapes. Eric Schweig played the character like any man in love. Even the stammering wasn't overly done. It was subtle. Just a delicious performance from Mr Schweig, an actor of enormous grace. Certain American Indians were offended at the movie having an gay Indian character. But, they need to get over it. There ARE Gays in the Indigenous community as well. Gay looks like your next door neighbor, your best friend, your pastor, your school teacher. That's what is so rewarding about  Eric Schweig's portrayal of Pike.Go see this movie, you will be so glad you did.Honorable mention should be made to the scenery of Montana. It is BREATH TAKING!

Thus, I was forced to scavenge the 'video library' for something worth watching again, or, to brave watching for the first time.  I had seen advertisements for Big Eden before, and I knew Wolfe video promotes it highly (though I think their involvement in the film slightly biases them).  AnyWho, I gave it a try.

Upon his return, friendships with townfolk rekindle, including a romance with Dean, a straight former bestfriend who is now divorced and back in town with his two kids.  (That's a long, complicated description of the rather complicated, almost forced scenariomaticizing of Dean's character)  All the while a 'first nations' man is trying to woo Henry through gourmet cooking.  If this is not a frightful cliche or idiotic circumstance, I'm not sure what is.On the whole, the film was entertaining.  It was tedious through certain 'reminiscences'.  It tasted something like Sweet Home Alambama, but less humorous.  The acting was only B, including the protaganist.  It is unfortunate that such films, which are relatively 'good', are deemed highly favorable releases from and for the gay and lesbian community.

It is they, the directing and the cinematography which craft this magical place. A place where everybody is surrounded by and accepted by love. Big Eden where everybody is just who and as they are with the bullies and lechers products of pulp novelists and bad dreams.The lush and loving caresses of the scenery by the camera shots, the wide-pans, the long-shots, groups shots, fades and the silhouettes, well, they all amount to a striking artistry and taken together they are akin to a big happy pill. An immense shot of oxygen. The final and perfect chords of an ensemble chorale.Even after more than thirty viewings, it never becomes stale or anticipatory as it unreels before you. It becomes the best beats of life's heart and as vital. In so many ways and wishes it is the best hopes for life and love. One reviewer compared it, I thought unkindly so, to ""Pretty Woman"" yet after reflection, I understand what they saw in a way. I cannot speak to their experiences, but as a gay man this is akin to ""KISMET"" or ""MY FAIR LADY"" because Henry had to first recognize the language of love to be able to see it around him.For lovers and romantics of all ages, I do recommend this film.Big Eden",5,For lovers and romantics of all ages,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1661,"['Big', 'Eden', 'romantic', 'hope', 'fantasy', 'beautiful', 'souls', 'enshrouds', 'gentle', 'cocoon', 'opening', 'moments', 'slowly', 'transforms', 'do', 'realize', 'make-believe', 'performances', 'what', 'are', 'drawn', 'story', 'spite', 'make', 'experiences', 'writing', 'good', 'bit', 'one-dimensional', 'actors', 'chemistry', 'abilities', 'shine', 'here', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'craft', 'magical', 'place', 'place', 'where', 'everybody', 'surrounded', 'accepted', 'love', 'Big', 'Eden', 'where', 'everybody', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'bullies', 'lechers', 'products', 'pulp', 'novelists', 'bad', 'dreams.The', 'lush', 'loving', 'caresses', 'scenery', 'camera', 'shots', 'wide-pans', 'long-shots', 'groups', 'shots', 'fades', 'silhouettes', 'well', 'amount', 'striking', 'artistry', 'taken', 'together', 'are', 'akin', 'big', 'happy', 'pill', 'immense', 'shot', 'oxygen', 'final', 'perfect', 'chords', 'ensemble', 'chorale.Even', 'more', 'thirty', 'viewings', 'never', 'stale', 'anticipatory', 'best', 'beats', 'life', 'heart', 'vital', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'wishes', 'best', 'hopes', 'life', 'love', 'One', 'reviewer', 'compared', 'thought', 'unkindly', 'so', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'yet', 'reflection', 'understand', 'what', 'saw', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'experiences', 'gay', 'man', 'akin', 'KISMET', 'MY', 'FAIR', 'LADY', 'Henry', 'had', 'first', 'recognize', 'language', 'love', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'around', 'him.For', 'lovers', 'romantics', 'ages', 'do', 'recommend', 'film.Big', 'Eden']",N/A

The main character is rude to his friends, his family, and everyone who approaches him from the very first scene and you end up not caring for him as a viewer. The city he finds himself in is bent on playing matchmaker and keeping him there, but it all seems very unrealistic and your mind fights against it the whole time.

This is the most important distinction...there are none whatsoever of the usual Displays of Homophobia, or hints of it, by any of the supporting characters that surround the principle roles. In the DVD extras. the director Tom Bezucha (who also wrote the screenplay) states that this was intentional as it was his desire to paint a gay love story with the biggest ""what-if"" of them all: What would happen if the usual underlying theme of bigotry and hatred toward those who love those of the same sex (a sub-plot of a lot of ""out-there"" gay films) was removed entirely from the plot. Indeed, to do such a thing in the story of ""Big Eden"" makes it by far the biggest fantasy in the catalogue of gay movies in my opinion. A number of reviewers feel that this feature of the movie detracts from its overall value as a film; I on the other hand, found the absence of homophobia in the story very, very refreshing.What's left is a story where the main characters are actually being pushed toward one another by the people in this little Montana town who see the truth of their feelings toward each other before they do. In itself, the antics of the these supporting characters alone is worth a single viewing of the film.If you detest country music, be warned: the soundtrack has a number of CW songs in it, most of them from before the time of Garth Brooks. I for one, loved the music as well as the film score, which utilized flutes over the usual piano for the more poignant moments.A two disk set, there are plenty of CD extras with the film, something this ""Extras-junkie"" craves.Very few films deserve five stars in my opinion and ""Big Eden"" does have a few less-than-polished moments. However they were so un-overwhelming (and since Amazon does not offer a 4.5 star option to the individual reviewer) I will go-for-broke here and give it the Big Five.

This is probably the first gay-themed film that truly touched me on a very personal level.Structured as a modern-day fable, ""Big Eden"" explores the same issues that peoples of minorities feel and deal with on a daily basis for having committed no other crime than being ""different"" from the ""norm"".Normally, we ""freaks of nature"" seek a false sense of belonging in ghettos, or seek anonymity in the hustle and bustle of large cities - anywhere, as long as it is far away from our families or close-knit communities of ""normal"" people. Learning to hate ourselves at a very early age for being different (those of who shout ""pride"" the loudest are usually the one who harbor the most self-loathing), secretly wishing to fit in and be accepted as opposed to rebelliously boxing our way into a society that prefers evolution to revolution, most ""minority peoples"" become emotional cripples, incapable of accepting or giving real love - how can we, when we don't even love ourselves?This is the reality that our hero, Henry Hart, lives in...that is, until he enters ""Big Eden"": a small, tucked-away community in Montana in which everyone knows everyone, where no one stands alone, where Christian love is more than a goal that makes us feel guilty for not achieving.  ""Big Eden"" is a utopia in which people are judged for their goodness and not their race or sexual proclivities, in which the concept of family extends way past bloodlines.Those of us who have spent their lives on the outside looking in, or anonymously minding their own business from within, like Henry, will feel awkward at first being surrounded by all of this unconditional acceptance and human kindness. We will want to shun it off as intrusive at best, not to be trusted at worst, like Henry. With luck, we will, however, get sucked into the healing quality of it all before reaching for the remote control to shut it out and label it as a painful fantasy that will never happen. Many will want to run from this ""Eden"" (as does Henry) before even giving it a real chance.Those who stay with this allegory for a perfect world in which all people can live along side of each other, will start to understand that this new Eden will only be achievable, when we stop hiding and hating ourselves...when we understand that love and caring can be infectious - they could even cause a pandemic.Does ""Big Eden"" really exist? No, not at the moment. Could it ever exist? Yes, it is possible, but probably on a global level highly improbable...after all, we are ""only"" human. That having been said, it should never cease to be our goal, and who knows, maybe it is possible on a smaller level - like the microcosm represented in ""Big Eden"", and that microcosm starts within.",5,A Utopea of a Film,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2854,"['What', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'levels', 'script', 'director', 'cast', 'production', 'value', '-last', 'not', 'least', 'emotional', 'impact', 'probably', 'first', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'truly', 'touched', 'very', 'personal', 'level.Structured', 'modern-day', 'fable', 'Big', 'Eden', 'same', 'issues', 'peoples', 'minorities', 'feel', 'deal', 'daily', 'basis', 'having', 'committed', 'other', 'crime', 'being', 'different', 'norm', '.Normally', 'freaks', 'nature', 'seek', 'false', 'sense', 'belonging', 'ghettos', 'seek', 'anonymity', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'large', 'cities', 'anywhere', 'as', 'long', 'far', 'away', 'families', 'close-knit', 'communities', 'normal', 'people', 'Learning', 'hate', 'ourselves', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'being', 'different', 'who', 'shout', 'pride', 'loudest', 'are', 'usually', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'self-loathing', 'secretly', 'wishing', 'fit', 'be', 'accepted', 'opposed', 'rebelliously', 'boxing', 'way', 'society', 'evolution', 'revolution', 'most', 'minority', 'peoples', 'become', 'emotional', 'cripples', 'incapable', 'accepting', 'giving', 'real', 'love', 'how', 'can', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'love', 'reality', 'hero', 'Henry', 'Hart', 'Big', 'Eden', 'small', 'tucked-away', 'community', 'Montana', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'where', 'one', 'alone', 'where', 'Christian', 'love', 'more', 'goal', 'feel', 'guilty', 'not', 'achieving', 'Big', 'Eden', 'utopia', 'people', 'are', 'judged', 'goodness', 'not', 'race', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'concept', 'family', 'way', 'bloodlines.Those', 'who', 'have', 'spent', 'lives', 'outside', 'looking', 'anonymously', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'Henry', 'will', 'feel', 'awkward', 'first', 'being', 'surrounded', 'unconditional', 'acceptance', 'human', 'kindness', 'will', 'want', 'shun', 'off', 'intrusive', 'best', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'worst', 'Henry', 'luck', 'will', 'however', 'get', 'sucked', 'healing', 'quality', 'reaching', 'remote', 'control', 'shut', 'out', 'label', 'painful', 'fantasy', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'Many', 'will', 'want', 'run', 'Eden', 'Henry', 'even', 'giving', 'real', 'chance.Those', 'who', 'stay', 'allegory', 'perfect', 'world', 'people', 'can', 'live', 'side', 'other', 'will', 'start', 'understand', 'new', 'Eden', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'achievable', 'when', 'stop', 'hiding', 'hating', 'ourselves', 'when', 'understand', 'love', 'caring', 'can', 'be', 'infectious', 'could', 'even', 'cause', 'pandemic.Does', 'Big', 'Eden', 'really', 'exist', 'No', 'not', 'moment', 'Could', 'ever', 'exist', 'Yes', 'possible', 'probably', 'global', 'level', 'highly', 'improbable', 'are', 'only', 'human', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'should', 'never', 'cease', 'be', 'goal', 'who', 'maybe', 'possible', 'smaller', 'level', 'microcosm', 'represented', 'Big', 'Eden', 'microcosm', 'starts']",N/A

It's only considered a fantasy because many perceive ""gay life"" as young 20somethings dancing and drugging it up at some flashly gay bar.  And then there are gay pride parades...which are nothing more than freak shows.  Most people believe that the gay lifestyle is all about drama and many gay men make that assumption believeable.  I'm gay and I don't blame the world for any of these perceptions.Big Eden is simply the ""other"" gay world.  Do I believe it exists?  Absolutely...though maybe not on the grand scale that Big Eden presents.  But Big Eden gets so much credit from me for not having any sex scenes, no drag queens, no flashy designer clothes and no stereotypical gay behavior.There is an issue of whether the town's people are conspiring from the very beginning to bring together Henry and Pike.  With repeated viewings I see more and more that would indicate this. If this is the case, it's all the more magical!  Big Eden, as a place and as a movie, is all about being subtle.  It's about people reconviening at a place and time to find themselves and others and to move forward.Actually Big Eden isn't a gay love story.  It's simply a love story.  Big Eden certainly isn't a gay mecca...it's simply a real community of caring people--like communities should be but often are not.  And that's why some will view this story as pure fantasy.The story is awesome...the acting subtle and real.  This is a movie with a message...maybe a warning of sorts to gay people.

As others have noted,  the initial premise of a NYC gay artist returning to his small town home might have provided interesting dynamics and conflicts to be explored, but instead the story revolves around the slapstick caricature of an improbable Montana town where everyone is not only gay-friendly, but intimately involved in getting the queers together, even though the queer boys themselves remain strangely uptight or full of unresolved emotional trauma about their gayness.  I would have to say the most interesting part of the movie was figuring out that there was nothing substantial behind all the puzzling and apparently irrational behavior, particularly that of the gay native american, other than said unresolved conflicts, which of course made no sense considering the whole town was unimaginably gay friendly including the rednecks.  Also, there is really nothing to explain why the main gay character is supposed to be so irresistible, not only to the two gay high school friends but to everyone else as well. Since it really can't be described as ""absurdist"" in its presentation, the utter incredibility of the story makes it seem simply hokey.

It's about a man in New York who comes back to his native Montana to care for his ailing grandfather.  The man is also gay but unattached, though an old flame tries to get together with him again.  A more fascinating character is called Pike (Eric Schweig), a Native American who runs the general store but is scared of what he feels for the prodigal fellow, played by Arye Gross.  The townspeople turn out to be very warm and tolerant in regard to gay relationships, and they are quite supportive in many respects.The ending is just a slight letdown:  why didn't Arye come clean with Pike instead of letting him think he had gone back to NY for good?  They could have had a last-chance encounter at the airport, possibly.  And what was Arye's reason for staying in Montana after all?  Just because of Pike?

I just bought the DVD directors cut and the second DVD has a lot of info and has the Directors commentary. Very entertaining!  Of course we all know that as of now, with all the hate and fear in the world, Big Eden has to live in a corner of our mind's eye as a ""WHAT IF""town in the Montana Mountains, but a dreamy (what if) and a very warm glowing movie. The cinematography is spectacular.Although this has a gay theme, I think that it has reached into all segments of the population and been hailed as a small miracle. It has won countless award's. Erye Gross, ( Henry Hart) does a great job as the returning grandson to Big Eden, from New York, where he is an established painter. (His grandpa played by George Coe, (Sam Hart) has had a light stroke.) Also, returning to Big Eden is his school chum, Dean, (Tim McKay) who Henry had a crush on in school and still has feelings for him. Enter Eric Schweig , (Pike) ""Last Of The Mohicans,"" and Skins, to make this a love triangle. There are the Boys that hang around the general store owned by Pike and they offer people Capachino's which was a hoot to see in the Montana Mountains.I have to mention Louise Fletcher, (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) as she is one of the lady's who want Henry to get hooked up to the right guy. Nan Martin is (The widow Thayer) and is a scream at how she manipulates Henry to first the women of Big Eden and then when enlightened, to the men of the general area.So, this is a movie on how this is all worked out, with Henry and most of Big Eden pulling for him to stay in Eden and his life in New York, pulling him back, plus his self image dragging him down a little. Corinne Boher plays his agent in NY and does a fantastic job. Folks you will love this movie and I suggest you see it and buy the DVD.

Everyone - gay or straight, has yearned for someone to love them, and these 2 hours of sheer joy brings back that certain feeling all over again!Plot:Gay painter Henry Hart upsets his busy New York career by returning to his hometown of Big Eden, Montana, to care for his ailing grandpa. Meeting up with childhood crush Dean gets him contemplating to stay on in Big Eden. Trouble is - Dean is straight and likely to remain so.The gentle townspeople badly wants to include Henry in their community and so a plan takes shape. This includes a matchmaking widow, the painfully shy Indian manager of the local store, and some wonderful cooking...Few romantic movies live up to their own hype. This one does. Big Eden has that intensely self-contained mood you want to experience again and again. It doesn't relate to a singular time or place. It's not dependent on anything but your imagination. Like Wuthering heights, Portrait of Jennie, Elvira Madigan, Summer of 42 and Love Story, it's simply there to be enjoyed by lovers of all creeds.It could be the music - country and western love songs have rarely been used this effectively. It could be the scenery: Big Eden, Montana is shot in a National Park, all woodlands and mountains. It could be the cinematography, shaded autumnal tones, wonderfully lit log cabin interiors, the brilliant big sky.
