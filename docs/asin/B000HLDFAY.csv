1015253,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000HLDFAY,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[6, 6]","""Too Cool For Christmas"" (Canada, 2004) tells the story of self-centered and spoiled 16 year old Lindsay Dearborn, who plans to ditch spending Christmas with her family (actually, a gay father and his life partner, along with her little sister) in order to go on a ""really cool"" ski trip with some friends. When even her friend Paige tells her that her negative attitude about the holidays is getting to be a bit much, she tries to befriend the mall's Santa (George Hamilton), who confides in her that Mrs. Claus doesn't seem to be so romantic with him anymore, even though they successfully made it through the ""700-year Itch"" part of their marriage (Hint: Get ready for MANY very bad puns!) Of course, Lindsay puts Santa through a total makeover, and is rewarded with an invitation to accompany Santa on his Christmas Eve rounds ... but in her sports car, since she is leery about traveling in a flying sleigh without seat belts. Of course, Santa intends the trip to show Lindey Hamilton the true holiday spirit.  Hamilton essentially plays a parody of himself, including an encounter with a tabloid photographer. Additional comedy relief (as if it was needed) is provided by a nerdy but egotistical mall cop, who threatens Lindsay with being banned from the mall for life.It is interesting to note that Liberation Productions, affiliated with the gay pay TV channel Here!, also made (the way it is classified on IMDB) a ""censored"" version of the film, with is called ""A Very Cool Christmas."" The only difference: Lindsay has a traditional heterosexual set of parents.Corny and campy, of course, but otherwise incredibly stupid and predictable. If you're a George Hamilton fan (Anyone?), you'll love it. Otherwise, if you can find it Here!OnDemand, or a cheap rental, it might be a good background film for a gay holiday party, with the sound replaced by your favorite music. DVD has no special features to speak of. Give it two humbug stars out of five.",2,"Campy, corny and predictably bad ... and those are the  good points.",1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,1956,"['Too', 'Cool', 'Christmas', 'Canada', '2004', 'story', 'self-centered', 'spoiled', '16', 'year', 'old', 'Lindsay', 'Dearborn', 'who', 'ditch', 'spending', 'Christmas', 'family', 'actually', 'gay', 'father', 'life', 'partner', 'little', 'sister', 'order', 'go', 'really', 'cool', 'ski', 'trip', 'friends', 'When', 'even', 'friend', 'Paige', 'negative', 'attitude', 'holidays', 'getting', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'befriend', 'mall', 'Santa', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'Mrs.', 'Claus', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'so', 'romantic', 'anymore', 'even', 'successfully', 'made', '700-year', 'Itch', 'part', 'marriage', 'Hint', 'Get', 'ready', 'MANY', 'very', 'bad', 'puns', 'course', 'Lindsay', 'Santa', 'total', 'makeover', 'rewarded', 'invitation', 'accompany', 'Santa', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'sports', 'car', 'leery', 'traveling', 'flying', 'sleigh', 'seat', 'belts', 'course', 'Santa', 'trip', 'show', 'Lindey', 'Hamilton', 'true', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'Hamilton', 'essentially', 'parody', 'including', 'encounter', 'tabloid', 'photographer', 'Additional', 'comedy', 'relief', 'was', 'needed', 'provided', 'nerdy', 'egotistical', 'mall', 'cop', 'who', 'Lindsay', 'being', 'banned', 'mall', 'life.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Liberation', 'Productions', 'affiliated', 'gay', 'pay', 'TV', 'channel', 'Here', 'also', 'made', 'way', 'classified', 'IMDB', 'censored', 'version', 'film', 'called', 'Very', 'Cool', 'Christmas', 'only', 'difference', 'Lindsay', 'traditional', 'heterosexual', 'set', 'parents.Corny', 'campy', 'course', 'otherwise', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'predictable', ""'re"", 'George', 'Hamilton', 'fan', 'Anyone', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Otherwise', 'can', 'find', 'Here', 'OnDemand', 'cheap', 'rental', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'background', 'film', 'gay', 'holiday', 'party', 'sound', 'replaced', 'favorite', 'music', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'Give', 'two', 'humbug', 'stars', 'five']",N/A
