It tells the story of director Sarah Polley's quest to figure out who is her biological father.  Sarah Polley was a Canadian child star who now, as an adult, has moved into directing.  The movie is never boring and the clips of her beautiful, now deceased mother are great.My objection to the film is that she used actors to portray the real characters so it feels a bit of a 'rip-off' to call yourself a documentary film and then hire actors to play the real, still alive people.  That is the reason I give this only 3 stars.  If she had used the real people, or at the least, used photographs like she does of her mother, I would have felt the movie was more authentic.

1637354,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BPRI6WG,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","Earlier in the year I promised myself that I would explore the genre of the Documentary more this year.  I would make a conscious effort to see more documentaries and to appreciate them as a medium for storytelling and as a worthy avenue of filmmaking.  That isn&#8217;t to say that I turned my nose up at them or anything, I just never really found myself compelled to watch them.  I don&#8217;t read biographies.  I don&#8217;t tend to watch those television documentaries (unless they are those hilarious ones on BBC about people who have ongoing relationships with sex dolls).  I have just always preferred fiction over fact.I saw a trailer for a film called &#8216;Leviathan&#8217; (which I&#8217;ve already reviewed) early this year that promised to be the &#8216;documentary for people who don&#8217;t like documentaries&#8217; and so I was compelled to see it.  Admirable, but it wasn&#8217;t anything wonderful (too avant-garde and underdeveloped).  Then I started to read all the glowing reviews for Sarah Polley&#8217;s film &#8216;Stories We Tell&#8217; and since I&#8217;m a fan of her work (I really liked &#8216;Away from Her&#8217; and &#8216;Take This Waltz&#8217; is easily one of the most underrated films of last year) I decided that I needed to see this movie.Now THIS is the documentary to redefine the term documentary!&#8216;Stories We Tell&#8217; manages to be two very different things at once, and balance them so well that one can&#8217;t help but become enveloped in every frame.  The film is both intimate and personal while at the same time being whimsy and fantastical.  It blends fact and fiction in a way I never thought possible and basically creates a genre all its own.This film belongs alongside films like &#8216;Zelig&#8217; and &#8216;Sans Soleil&#8217; as films dwelling within this genre (yes, I&#8217;m aware that &#8216;Zelig&#8217; was a faux-documentary) that break down boundaries and write their own rules and ultimately become benchmarks for greatness.&#8216;Stories We Tell&#8217; is a masterpiece.What I think is no neat about this film is that it is not a director exploring a subject that they are merely interested in or vaguely connected to in an extended sense.  This is Sarah Polley making a beautiful tribute to her mother.  Taking on her parent&#8217;s marriage, relationship issues, her early childhood, her mother&#8217;s death and then ultimately a shocking family scandal, Polley&#8217;s influence, opinion and perspective could have been all over this film in an off-putting and manipulative way, but what makes this film so effective is the restraint that Polley uses in just allowing the interviewees to speak their mind, tell their stories, and inevitably grab our interest.  The subject matter, while on the surface may seem rather insignificant or unimportant, has such endearing beauty because it feels so authentic and relatable.  This is the story of family, but more than that it is a celebration of memories and how they can shape who we are and where we&#8217;ve been.The same story, told by ten different people, will carry ten different meanings, all of which are equally as important depending on how you chose to look at it.I don&#8217;t want to delve into the scandal addressed in the film&#8217;s second half, but there is so much beauty, grace and intelligence to be noted in the way that Polley allows it to be addressed.One thing that I will touch upon is the visual style with which Sarah uses to color in her documentary.  Throughout the film there are so many beautifully detailed sequences of &#8216;home movies&#8217; that help to pull in the viewer and connect them to the Polley family.  Whether it be vacations her parents took or a glimpse of Sarah playing with her father in the yard or an important meeting in a caf&eacute;, these segments help illustrate the intimate story Polley is telling us.  When it is uncovered that all of these videos are re-enactments, it becomes all the clearer how brilliant this film really is.  Sarah is a visionary director who captured life in a capsule and delivered it wish such substantial style (see what I did there).And I just want to say that Michael Polley is EVERYTHING.  The man is endearing, charming, sweet, heartfelt, honest, passionate and his speaking voice is just captivating.  You can sense the love between Sarah and her father and his stamp of approval (and participation) in this project makes it all the more affecting.  You fall in love with him, and thus the film takes on an even deeper narrative.His reaction to the question about what he said to his wife on her deathbed was just&#8230;too much for me.So, I guess it&#8217;s clear how I feel about this film.  It is one of the best films of the year, period.  In fact, outside of &#8216;Lawrence Anyways&#8217; I&#8217;d have to say that this IS the best film of the year.  A solid masterpiece in style, substance and technical precision (the editing is so fluid and captivating).  This is all around perfection, from every angle.",5,Tell me another story&#8230;,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,5036,"['Earlier', 'year', 'promised', 'would', 'explore', 'genre', 'Documentary', 'more',

This film has an interesting mystery about parentage that holds the viewer...although I was often bored. I lost interest because the over educated Canadian family have leached emotion from their middle class speech. The father(s) are more interesting, having been artists and come from a different time period. This is a daughter's search for the &#34;truth&#34; about her mother's life before the last daughter is born. Oddly, no one ever quotes anything the mother actually said. I found that odd. But the absence of quotes from the mother, I found myself missing her presence. Diane. I wish your daughter had found a way to give you a voice in this story. There's something subtle missing in this documentary. I think it's Diane. A woman the director, and daughter, never knew as an adult. But since the director is a woman, I wish she'd probed for evidence of her mother's point of view on her own life. The end is worth waiting for. Maybe hang in for 70% of this film until you give up.

The extended family in this documentary film is a most interesting one, and each individual member is a fascinating character in her or his own right, in spite of, perhaps because of, the fact that there is nothing that truly weird about any of them. The extensive use of home video footage from the 60s, 70s, and 80s really carries the film.

Eventually there doesn't seem to be a point. Sarah mixes documentary style interviews with film, some from home footage and some created with paid actors to appear like home footage. The reviewers keep talking about how each person has a different view, but what came through was a sequence of events in Diana's life.

This sequence serves as a metaphor for the entire film, which concentrates in depth on the nature of story-telling.  It is fundamentally an autobiographical detective story, as Sarah interviews various members of her extended family to discover something about her late mother's life.  We learn that her mother used to be an actress and performer; a vivacious soul who married Michael (a British actor) after having experienced a disastrous first marriage.  Her marriage to Michael works fine for the first few years, but then things start to go wrong, and her mother ends up having an affair with film producer Harry Gulkin (one of Polley's interviewees).  Michael and the family are based in Toronto; Gulkin in Montreal.  As Sarah investigates more about this love-affair, she discovers something shocking about her own life that changes her perspective for ever.  As she conducts her interviews, Polley realizes that different interviewees have different versions of 'the truth,' shaped not only according to their perceptions, but also by what they want to reveal on camera.  Only by comparing different interviews can Polley reach at least an approximation about what 'really' happened to her mother and Gulkin, and the effect of their love-affair on Michael.  One reviewer of this film has already asked &#34;what is it REALLY about?&#34;  The answer to this question becomes clear: there is no such thing as a 'real' or 'definitive' interpretation of the past.  We can only listen to different accounts, and make up our own minds, while realizing that our interpretation is no more or less definitive than other interpretations.  Polley's film is both uncompromising yet sympathetic to the interviewees; sometimes they are prompted into revealing truths about themselves (which perhaps they had not previously admitted), but Polley - who appears on screen as well as directing the entire film - makes no judgment on them.

It's not the dad she was raised by and it turns out not to be the other expected party either.  This group of people agreed to make this emotionally raw film together in little bits of separate one on one interviews that took place over a period of time and each one is kind of like peeling a scab off of a wound -- each time you get a little bit deeper into it.  You can feel the internal squirming of some of the people being interviewed as some of them are not comfortable revealing secrets or how they feel about the subjects.  It feels a little raw for some of them.  Some things are revealed about Sarah's mom and it's hard not to judge her and label her but ultimately you see her as another wounded human being just trying to do the best that she can in the difficult situations that she's helped create called her life.  At one point she chooses her personal freedom but has to give up her children as a result of that choice.  Later she gives up a man she loves because she does not want to lose her second family.  When Sarah does find her biological father, it turns out it is not whom she and everyone else suspected that it was.  Turns out he is not surprised that she is his daughter - he knew it all along.  But he is thrilled and full of joy that Sarah now knows and wants her to be in his life.  The dad who raised Sarah is wounded and hurt by the threat of Sarah's biological father even though he had been participating in these interviews and her quest from the beginning.  It seems that no one had considered the ripple effects of this discovery via this movie making idea - that it would become public knowledge, their friends and family would know.  It seems that Sarah's dad didn't mind that Sarah's mom had another mans child while they were married - he just didn't want everyone else to know about it.The movie is hard to watch sometimes because you can't help but empathize with all of the characters and how they feel about what is happening.  You also find yourself wondering if Sarah's mother was still alive if this movie would've still been made and if it was how she would feel about it.

1637414,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BPRI6WG,Paul Allaer,"[2, 2]","""Stories We Tell"" (2012 release from Canada; 108 min.) is the third film from Canadian writer-director Sarah Polley (after ""Away From Her"" and ""Take This Waltz"", both excellent). But this is her first documentary, and not just any documentary: this movie looks at the life and times of her parents, and also whether her dad is really her biological father. Her mom Diane comes across as a person who fills the room with energy, whereas her dad Michael is the more introverted type. Nevertheless the two strike up a romance leading to marriage, and eventually kids. Sarah was the third and youngest. At some point in her childhood she is getting teased about not looking like her dad at all, and it becomes sort of a running joke, until it isn't a joke anymore. Sarah eventually decides to investigate the rumors, and gathers all the characters for interviews: her dad (we learn that her mom has passed away many years ago), but also her siblings including two more from a prior marriage that Diane had prior to meeting Michael, and other assorted folks in the theatre and art community in Canada. To tell you much more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out, but if you have seen the trailer for the movie (which I had) and wonder ""was it Tom, or Wayne, or Jeff?"", you will be surprised with how it all turns out!Several comments: first and foremost, this movie shows once again that if you have a strong story to tell, you don't a superhero or specical effects to keep the movie going. I couldn't believe how quickly the time passed. Second, this is a deeply personal movie obviously and yet it resonates with a broader audience because of the universal themes of love, family, and acceptance. Third, I was amazed at the wealth of home movies that were used in the movie, only later to find out that many of them were reenactments filmed on 8mm film. I generally do not like reenactments in documentaries but here it workes because, frankly, I didn't realize for most of the movie that they were reenactments. That aside, most telling is a scene late in the documentary where someone asks Sarrah directly why she is making this movie in this particular way, and she explains how different people see different truths of the same events and hence she brought it from a multi-person perspective. (This is clearly not to the liking of one of the main characters... whatch why!)Bottom line: this is another great movie from Sarah Polley. The screening at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati where I saw this, was very well attended for a late afternoon showing, and I think this movie can become an art-house box office success. If you love documentaries, you cannot go wrong with this.

So I'll focus mostly on what the movie ultimately explores and illuminates in exciting ways...rather than on the mundane sounding ""what happened was.""It's a documentary constructed by actress/director Sarah Polley (DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, GO). Essentially, she mixes interviews with family members and friends along with home movie footage, to tell the story of her deceased mother and the secrets she had. Polley is ostensibly searching for her identity (and that's all I'll say)...but the movie has ever so much more on its mind.First, it is an exploration of how the things that happen to us become the stories we tell to others and that few experiences are really FACTS, but are interpretations of those FACTS or events. While no one differs enormously on the details of the mother's life or other family events...the feelings about those details, the impressions DO differ, in ways subtle or big. For example, when various folks are asked ""did you think my mother was afraid of dying?"" the answers vary. The FACT is that she did die. But the story becomes either how bravely she faced it, or how she was in denial, or something else. Yet these impressions become facts to the person telling the story, and thus the LISTENER is also influenced.Second, the movie itself is a fascinating detective story. It's amazing to experience how engrossing this seemingly mundane family story becomes. And to me, not only was the story interesting...but the fact that it WAS interesting says something interesting too. We all have common bonds that we can recognize in each other...that empathy can flow easily when we get to know someone a little bit. The people we see in this film are REAL people sharing some real issues they faced or experiences they had...and these resonate in the viewer, even though we are strangers. I find this experience to have been uplifting to think about.Finally, the film is also about the idea of a movie documentary. One always knows that the documentarian MUST bring a point of view to their subject...even if only through what they chose to show and what falls to the cutting room floor. The questions asked. The subjects interviewed. Heck, even the title of documentaries often betrays a point of view. But we still watch and willingly absorb. Polley plays with that TRUST that we as viewers have in our STORYTELLER (the creator(s) of the documentary) and slowly turns that on its head. I wish I could explain more...but to do so would spoil a couple of gasp-worthy moments.So just trust me...this innocuous sounding film is gripping, exciting, incisive and richly rewarding.

1637435,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00BPRI6WG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 14]","Sarah Polley has an interesting career. Starting out in front of the camera, she has starred in a number of television shows and films before transitioning behind the camera as a director. Now with three films under her belt, her small body of work can begin to be appreciated, and evaluated.Her first film, ""Away From Her"", is the phenomenally well-made story of an aging couple, played by Julie Christie and Gordon Winsett, dealing with illness at the end of their lives. Emotional, heartfelt and very genuine, the film almost earned an Oscar for Chrstie's work. How did Polley create such a remarkable, well-received film her first time out? I'm not sure, but it is an achievement. I defy you to watch this film without a hanky.Her second film, the recent ""Take This Waltz"", starring Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen as Margot and Lou, a young married couple living in Toronto, is less successful. Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby, a recognizable character actor with a lot of TV appearances to his name) and they begin an affair. The film is problematic because Lou is never defined enough to be either good or bad and Margot just seems listless - why she enters into an affair is never really illustrated or credible enough to keep the film grounded.Now with her third film, Polley writes and directs ""The Stories We Tell"", a documentary about her own family. The fifth child of two actors, Michael and Diane, Sarah was a late child and much younger than her siblings. Her mother's death, when Sarah was only 11, deeply affected her and she began to ask questions. These questions eventually lead to ""The Stories We Tell"".Polley corrals her father, her brothers and sisters, and other key people involved in the story, and gets them to talk on camera about her mother and their family. Each subject seems extremely self-conscious, at least at first, which is a little surprising given each is involved in acting in some way.Michael types out his thoughts, creating an unpublished, lengthy memoir. Polley brings him to a professional recording studio to read his writing. As he records the audio, her camera records the session. The rest of the interviews are conducted in their own living spaces. The difference between the two scenarios does a couple of things. Because of Michael's environment, his words seem to have greater weight and also seem under greater scrutiny. As he recounts the events of his life, Polley sits at a mixing board in the adjoining room, listening passively, occasionally asking him to go back and redo a line. During this time, cameras watch both father and daughter, providing a lot of emphasis to his words.As Michael recounts his story, one thing quickly becomes clear; he and his wife were very different people. Meeting as working actors in the same play, Diane embraces the idea of her profession and wants to enjoy her life to the fullest. Even in the home movies we watch, she is always dancing or mugging for the camera. On the other hand, Michael seems to retreat into the role of father, taking a respectable, steady job. As Michael narrates, we watch their relationship go through some ups and down, leading to cycles in their relationship.At one point, Diane is offered a role in a new play called ""Toronto"" which is booked for an extended run in Montreal. During the production, Michael visits Diane and he recognizes a renewed vigor in their love life. Nine months later, Sarah is born. Years later, one of Sarah's brothers makes a joke leading her to eventually discover Michael might not be her biological father.""The Stories We Tell"" is her story of finding out the truth.Even though you may know going in what she will find out, Polley goes through the story with the practical, detached eye of a skilled documentarian. The shots of her `directing' her father's recording sessions show her intently listening to his words, rarely interrupting. Using a wealth of home movie footage, she illustrates the stories each of the participants tells, methodically getting to the center of the story.""The Stories We Tell"" is a quiet, well-made look at one family's very moving story. I was very emotionally invested in the tale.(WARNING! Spoiler alert! After you have watched the film, please return to the review and consider the following.)Until the credits began to roll.In an age when every great documentary by Errol Morris or Michael Moore, films which reach mass audiences because they are also entertaining, are basically dismissed by Oscar voters in favor or more typical, more boring, traditional documentaries, a lot of scrutiny is placed on how documentaries tell their stories. You have a point of view? Yikes. You don't have talking head after talking head? That isn't acceptable. You are trying to make a documentary that is both informative and entertaining? How dare you. No, no, no.Just as ""The Stories We Tell"" ends and you are feeling  the film's emotions roll over you, the credits roll and you see that actors were hired to play Diane, Michael and all of the other subjects for the `home movie' footage. Once you see these credits, and you begin to put two and two together, you may ask why this was necessary. Is any of the home movie footage authentic? Every effort is made to make the `home movie' footage look like home movies. Some of the shots are even repeated over and over again, indicating a possible scarcity of material. Then you may realize that Polley was essentially directing her father during the recording session. How did this change the story, if at all?Documentaries often use `recreations' but these aren't usually made to look like something you would expect one of the participants to have at hand. Morris frequently uses stylized recreations to illustrate what someone is describing, an event no camera could record. Learning that actors were used to create many, if not all, of the `home movies' detracts from the emotion of the film. And it also raises questions that really shouldn't enter into the discussion.Polley is a remarkably gifted director capable of getting her subjects to reveal real, raw emotion. She doesn't need to resort to fake, manipulated 'home movies' to sell the narrative. Frankly as all of these questions started to circulate in my head and I felt like I had been used. The movie I just watched seemed less emotional and much more manipulative.",3,"Very Good Film, But...",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,6359,"['Sarah', 'Polley', 'interesting', 'career', 'Starting',
