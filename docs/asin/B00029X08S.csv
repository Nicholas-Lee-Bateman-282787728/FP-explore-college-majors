Robertson ""CrashTestChris""","[4, 4]","4 Stars for the performance......As outlined, Mark's voice cracked during the Paranoid medley and probably was embarrasing to Farner for this gig to be put out.....The Itchicoo Rock Festival where this came from was a total financial disaster (some groups never were paid)....So the producers put out these DVDs culled from those that actually went on during the 3 day event back in 1999 (Farner, Styx, Steppenwolf...etc) just to try and recoup some money from the losses....There never was another fest after this one.....Also, the original billing was ""Mark Farner AND Grand Funk Railroad"" that did not go over very well with the 2 other GFR members and lawsuits abounded (along with alot more bad feelings). Farner was not very happy with the release of this DVD, but really had no say in it's production due to agreement contract he'd signed....Overall the visuals were pretty good, but the sound mix was not...The screen ratio went from the original widescreen format back to pan and scan for some reason, and that's disappointing.....A ""Rock & Roll Greats"" compilation was released before this that was much better but only one performance of Mark's was included I""M YOUR CAPTAIN......On the plus side, you can tell that Mark has a solid band behind him and they still put on a whale of a show, even though it's a early afternoon time slot with a approaching thunder storm, and a smallish crowd.Anything is better than nothing, and you could do worse than purchasing anything other than an alltime great like Mark Farner....Physically, he's just like he was when was at his peak in 1971-73, and much better guitarist....Worth the money.CrashTestChris 2K7",4,A Rock N' Roll Great....Just Not A Great Set.....,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1660,"['4', 'Stars', 'performance', 'outlined', 'Mark', 'voice', 'cracked', 'Paranoid', 'medley', 'probably', 'was', 'embarrasing', 'Farner', 'gig', 'be', 'put', 'out', '..The', 'Itchicoo', 'Rock', 'Festival', 'where', 'came', 'was', 'total', 'financial', 'disaster', 'groups', 'never', 'were', 'paid', 'producers', 'put', 'out', 'DVDs', 'culled', 'actually', 'went', '3', 'day', 'event', 'back', '1999', 'Farner', 'Styx', 'Steppenwolf', 'etc', 'just', 'try', 'recoup', 'money', 'losses', '.There', 'never', 'was', 'fest', 'one', '..Also', 'original', 'billing', 'was', 'Mark', 'Farner', 'AND', 'Grand', 'Funk', 'Railroad', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'very', 'well', '2', 'other', 'GFR', 'members', 'lawsuits', 'abounded', 'alot', 'more', 'bad', 'feelings', 'Farner', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'release', 'DVD', 'really', 'had', 'say', 'production', 'due', 'agreement', 'contract', ""'d"", 'signed', 'visuals', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'sound', 'mix', 'was', 'not', 'screen', 'ratio', 'went', 'original', 'widescreen', 'format', 'back', 'pan', 'scan', 'reason', 'disappointing', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Greats', 'compilation', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'one', 'performance', 'Mark', 'was', 'included', 'M', 'YOUR', 'CAPTAIN', 'plus', 'side', 'can', 'tell', 'Mark', 'solid', 'band', 'still', 'put', 'whale', 'show', 'even', 'early', 'afternoon', 'time', 'slot', 'approaching', 'thunder', 'storm', 'smallish', 'crowd.Anything', 'better', 'nothing', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'purchasing', 'anything', 'other', 'alltime', 'great', 'Mark', 'Farner', '.Physically', 'just', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'peak', '1971-73', 'much', 'better', 'guitarist', 'money.CrashTestChris', '2K7']",N/A

Yeah, guess so...and Mark's still here,still giving his all for us Brothers and Sisters. No, there's not much in the way of video for us Funksters, so we just appreciate what we can get that much more. Thanks Mark.

829007,A18CYLGEI7DUIE,B00029X08S,Old Fan,"[1, 1]","I was there when this album came out. (I saw it and bought it in a heartbeat...at the ""PX"" on the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama when I was a teenager. It is now 2009 and I'm 55) For many reading this the ""PX"" part won't mean a thing...but that is short for ""POST EXCHANGE"" which co-notes being in the army and having a place to shop on base. Believe it or not many Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Beatles stuff flowed thru that place and un-beknownst to many of the top brass at the time...it was a Gods-send to GI's. God bless Veterans! This album flows in my DNA now. The song:""Closer To Home"" may be a rock anthem for many but for me it was and is... a very spiritual song. It's so strange how songs that we have heard in our younger years have a way coming to fruition and affect us as we age. I really like that Mark is healthy and still rockin! I just wish he'd done ""Sin's a Good Man's Brother"" and ""Aimless Lady"". But hey...at my age ..it's all good!Peace.",5,Sweet,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,973,"['was', 'there', 'when', 'album', 'came', 'out', 'saw', 'bought', 'heartbeat', 'PX', 'Redstone', 'Arsenal', 'Huntsville', 'Alabama', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'now', '2009', ""'m"", '55', 'many', 'reading', 'PX', 'part', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'thing', 'short', 'POST', 'EXCHANGE', 'being', 'army', 'having', 'place', 'shop', 'base', 'Believe', 'not', 'many', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Beatles', 'stuff', 'flowed', 'thru', 'place', 'un-beknownst', 'many', 'top', 'brass', 'time', 'was', 'Gods-send', 'GI', 'God', 'bless', 'Veterans', 'album', 'DNA', 'now', 'song', 'Closer', 'Home', 'may', 'be', 'rock', 'anthem', 'many', 'was', 'very', 'spiritual', 'song', 'so', 'strange', 'how', 'songs', 'have', 'heard', 'younger', 'years', 'have', 'way', 'coming', 'fruition', 'affect', 'age', 'really', 'Mark', 'healthy', 'still', 'rockin', 'just', 'wish', ""'d"", 'done', 'Sin', 'Good', 'Man', 'Brother', 'Aimless', 'Lady', 'hey', 'age', '..it', 'good', 'Peace']",N/A

829009,A386NVAVQV5WUO,B00029X08S,"Richard D. Cappetto ""RickDC""","[46, 48]","I was all set to give this DVD a great review but then I watched it LOL. Its not terrible; but there are some problems. One Mark Farner, who is one of rock n roll's greatest singers, was not in great voice on this day, he sounded like he had some voice strain (I am sure from a heavy turning schedule) and this company passport Video should have had Mark do some overdubs. Another problem is the Vocals are very loud in the mix and that causes the songs to sound not as hard edged as they should. And lastly there are two songs mislabeled on the DVD. Song number 6 is Not He sent me you it is a medley of Paranoid, Sin's a Good man's Brother and Mr. Limousine Driver; and song number 7 is not Call yourself a Man it is Comfort me.On the Good side this is the first full length DVD of mostly GFR songs anywhere; and it deserves 4 STARS JUST FOR THAT REASON ALONE. The picture looks fantastic, the backdrop is cool with the big screen and the Psychedelic colors. Judgment Day Blues one of Mark's Christian songs absolutely rocks, Mark rips it up with some tasty and nasty blues riffs. There IS a nice version of Comfort Me on hear mislabeled as I said above and it is one of my favorite GFR songs ever. And I'm Your Captain, one of Rock N roll's GREAT songs (anthems) is very done well.Mark's band is adequate, But Mel's pounding Bass (or bong rattling Bass) and Don's drums and raspy vocals are missed.  Mark's bass player cannot sing, his voice to me is like fingernails on a chalk board. Well, over exaggeration he is not that bad, and having said all that, this is still a must have DVD for any and all GFR fans.Lets hope with the death of Terry Knight that the Guys will get together and realize we are all mortal and lets get the GFR classic stuff out there on DVD, such as the Shea stadium show.
