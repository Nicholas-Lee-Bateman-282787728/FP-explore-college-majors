774867,A3AV573DJTTJI2,B0000CABHV,Cynthia Dagnal-Myron,"[0, 0]","No, this isn't your usual teen romance.  It's gritty and realistic--it feels, in fact, like cinema verite, shot as if the director simply turned on a camera and watched the train wreck happen.The director chose perfect, very natural actors--in fact, I have a feeling they weren't really actors, just two ""real"" kids chosen because they were so right for the roles.  And the roles are almost archetypal.  Compulsive criminal Boyd is every parent's nightmare: a very bad boy with James Dean appeal.  And Katie's an impressionable little moth drawn to his flame, and yet somehow able to avoid being consumed no matter how close she gets.  Watching Boyd spin more and more out of control while Katie hangs on out of a yearning for adventure that she's too young to understand or control is both heart breaking and familiar.I know these kids. I knew kids just like them when I was young, too.  I both envied and feared their seemingly fatal attraction. This movie reminded me why I felt that way.  And made me feel that dread tinged with a big dose of curiosity yet again.It's definitely not ""Pretty in Pink.""

774869,A3LVXNUEVUQA9T,B0000CABHV,Echolocation,"[0, 0]","The lead actor is the spitting image of a young Brad Pitt, he's also a talented actor with much potential. The female lead is a bit boring and is overshadowed by Boyd. I won't tell the story as you can get the gist of that from other reviews. This is not a movie too watch if you want too lift up your spirits. I think it does firmly explain why some girls like bad boys.) This initially turns into something exciting but the movie wanes as the antics just don't stop. You realize that no matter what some people do they will always be habitual offenders. Boyd is easy too like because he can be extremely charming and seems to have a good heart. The movie is about 20 minutes too long as it get's exhausting after a while. You also realize how a person's surroundings, and their parents greatly affect their children's actions. It was an interesting watch but has it's weaknesses as the movie tends to drag on and on. So if you're interested in human behavior/psychology and why certain people don't change or can't this is right up your alley.

The story and acting of this young man I my special 5- performance since this is his first acting job as a young 17 year old.  He is a tremendously good looking boy match with a comparable good looking young lady. A innocent attraction that goes wrong very fast.This is a movie you like to take a date too. and  get into the richer screen\ play and can't wait to see what will happen next.Be ready for this great coming of age movie.Highly recomend this movie.
