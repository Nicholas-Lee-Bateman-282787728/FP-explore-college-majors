297899,AQ3A4Q1JMZ0TS,6302139791,JohnnyNash,"[0, 0]",This is one of the older movies John Wayne did. It has a great storyline and a pretty decent movie. The quality of the movie is only fair and sometimes drifts towards bad but overall a pretty good film to have in your collection. The quality of the film is more likely due to the age of the film and condition when it was preserved. If I had watched it and then had to decide if I wanted to purchase it I would buy it again. Some of these old movies will be lost in years to come and even though it's not one of the best qualities it's still a decent film,4,Older Movie,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,555,"['one', 'older', 'movies', 'John', 'Wayne', 'did', 'great', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'quality', 'movie', 'only', 'fair', 'sometimes', 'drifts', 'towards', 'bad', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'collection', 'quality', 'film', 'more', 'likely', 'due', 'age', 'film', 'condition', 'when', 'was', 'preserved', 'had', 'watched', 'then', 'had', 'decide', 'wanted', 'purchase', 'would', 'buy', 'again', 'old', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'years', 'come', 'even', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'qualities', 'still', 'decent', 'film']",King of the Pecos VHS

A young John Wayne in absolute top form, a great plot, great Cy Kendall heavy and great ace stuntman and actor Yakima Cannut. Lots of riding and shooting and a fine, long shootout finale. Wayne's two sidekicks are hilarious. And the dialogue is witty. Take this one: Wayne as a lawyer: &#34;I take your case.&#34; Client: &#34;Where to?&#34; Even the cover of the box is delicate showing the old nostalgic poster for the film.

297905,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302139791,Randy Keehn,"[4, 5]","I'm a big fan of John Wayne.  Even in my youthful liberal days, I always stood up for him whenever my friends on the left would disparage him and his acting.  ""Forget his politics"" I would say, ""He's an outstanding actor!""  The comment that ""He always played the same role"" led me to observe, over the years, that this discription would apply to 90% of all screen actors.  The idea that a strong, forceful man of principle is the discription of a character role just doesn't register.  The main problem with the career of John Wayne was that he made numerous poor decisions in the movies he chose to make.  However, that is a flaw of his years of stardom.  He made a lot of clunkers before he ever became a star but that was his role in hollywood; the Saturday matinee cowboy hero.I have seen a number of Wayne's pre-""Stagecoach"" movies and I decided to jot a review of ""King of the Pecos"" because it struck me as one of the better movies Wayne made during this period.  It has an interesting beginning; a ruthless man and his entourage stake out a terriotory of their own in Texas.  In the process his henchman kills a settler and his wife but leaves the young boy.  Well, guess who comes back incognito as an adult.  Some of the action is fairly decent and the role that Wayne plays is a bit more complex in this movie (he has a law degree as well as the ability to shoot the eyes out of a snake).  The other characters are somewhat less developed but there are a couple of comic sidekicks that fit the role adequately.  There are issues with this movie as there are with all the pre-stardom movies that were made on the cheap.  Things don't always make sense.  For example what happens to his horse during one of the big shootouts, how can you rely on white armbands while riding miles on a dusty trail, and what's the big deal with the safe and the salamander nickname?  However, for a low budget movie probably made in a week's time, ""King of the Pecos"" isn't too bad (but, let's face it, none of these movies rate a ****  or a *****).",3,King of the Preteens,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,2040,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Even', 'youthful', 'liberal', 'days', 'always', 'stood', 'up', 'whenever', 'friends', 'left', 'would', 'disparage', 'acting', 'Forget', 'politics', 'would', 'say', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'comment', 'always', 'played', 'same', 'role', 'led', 'observe', 'years', 'discription', 'would', 'apply', '90', '%', 'screen', 'actors', 'idea', 'strong', 'forceful', 'man', 'principle', 'discription', 'character', 'role', 'just', ""n't"", 'register', 'main', 'problem', 'career', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'made', 'numerous', 'poor', 'decisions', 'movies', 'chose', 'make', 'However', 'flaw', 'years', 'stardom', 'made', 'lot', 'clunkers', 'ever', 'became', 'star', 'was', 'role', 'hollywood', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'cowboy', 'hero.I', 'have', 'seen', 'number', 'Wayne', 'pre-', 'Stagecoach', 'movies', 'decided', 'jot', 'review', 'King', 'Pecos', 'struck', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'Wayne', 'made', 'period', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'ruthless', 'man', 'entourage', 'stake', 'terriotory', 'own', 'Texas', 'process', 'henchman', 'settler', 'wife', 'young', 'boy', 'Well', 'guess', 'who', 'back', 'incognito', 'adult', 'action', 'fairly', 'decent', 'role', 'Wayne', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'movie', 'law', 'degree', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'shoot', 'eyes', 'snake', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'less', 'developed', 'are', 'couple', 'comic', 'sidekicks', 'fit', 'role', 'adequately', 'are', 'issues', 'movie', 'are', 'pre-stardom', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'cheap', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'example', 'what', 'horse', 'one', 'big', 'shootouts', 'how', 'can', 'rely', 'white', 'armbands', 'riding', 'miles', 'dusty', 'trail', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'safe', 'salamander', 'nickname', 'However', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'probably', 'made', 'week', 'time', 'King', 'Pecos', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'let', 'face', 'none', 'movies', 'rate', '****', '*****']",King of the Pecos VHS
