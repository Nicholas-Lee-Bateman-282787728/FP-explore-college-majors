1212247,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001KZIRKY,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Valkyrie, 2008 filmThis movie is based on a true story, the attempted assassination of Hitler in July 1944. German soldiers swore an oath of unconditional obedience to the Fuehrer. Only death could break it. One man writes about the terrors of Nazi rule. Hitler is the arch-enemy of Germany. Germany is fighting the British in North Africa in 1942 and losing. They are attacked by fighters that drop bombs and shoot at them. The next scene is in 1943 Russian. The Leader meets his Generals. A small package is brought into the conference room. [No inspection of packages.] It failed to go off. Dissenters will be rounded up because of another plot. They will need a replacement for the caught plotter. Mrs. Stauffenberg is told about her husband's wounds. Medals are given to wounded soldiers. Colonel Stauffenberg is recruited to a meeting. What will happen when Hitler is removed? Is there chance of success?Back home Stauffenberg's family seeks shelter during an air raid. There is an idea to use Operation Valkyrie to take power in Berlin (the reserve troops). They meet General Fromm, he is cautious. Stauffenberg talks to another General: no deal. Stauffenberg is promoted to Chief of Staff of the reserve forces. They visit the mountain retreat of Hitler. The revised plan is browsed and signed. The plotters discuss the time bomb and the need for both Hitler and Himmler to be there. ""Nothing ever goes according to plan."" [The idea is not reality.] Their plan is given to the men, their most important action. A drill is scheduled. Stauffenberg goes to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia. An officer drops a cigarette as a signal. Stauffenberg makes a telephone call to Berlin. It is only a drill! One of the plotters must disappear tonight! Stauffenberg goes to another meeting. They prepare the bomb. The meeting site is changed. There is bad news for the German Army, the Red Army is advancing. Stauffenberg gets a telephone call and walks away. There is an explosion. [Does his departure provide a clue? Better to have stayed close by?]An officer calls Berlin, communications are severed. The General hesitates to implement the plan without knowing that Hitler is dead. The Standby Drill is ordered, but later than planned. Operation Walk&uuml;re is ordered, the orders passed along. Fromm places a telephone call and learns Hitler survived. The Berlin Ministry is sealed. The police will cooperate. Soldiers take over government buildings. All seems to be going well. But new orders come from Hitler! Goebbels makes a telephone call, the traitors are to be taken alive. Generals make a decision to be on the winning side. One man says ""the Fuehrer is not dead"". Operation Walk&uuml;re is ended. The radio sens out the news. The coup failed. [In Norse mythology the Walk&uuml;re were beautiful maidens who accompanied dead warriors to Valhalla for celebrations.]Troops arrive to arrest the plotters by orders of the Fuehrer. Beck asks for a pistol. The others are tried for treason. Some are shot, the others are hanged. ""The July 20 plot was the last of 15 known attempts by Germans to assassinate Hitler. Nine months later, with Berlin surrounded, Hitler committed suicide."" [What if they used a more powerful bomb?] The book ""Counterfeit Traitor"" said there would be no need for the Gestapo and concentration camps if all the Germans supported Hitler. The Allies signed a treaty that called for unconditional surrender so a successful coup would not have changed the post-war world. Germany would still have been partitioned into zones of influence. Would the war in Asia have ended sooner? The secret protocol of the Yalta Agreement called for the Soviet Union to renounce its peace treaty with Japan and attack 90 days after the end of the European war. The war could have ended in 1944 without the use of an atomic bomb (which would be developed anyway). The civil war in China would have continued. The war for independence in Vietnam (and elsewhere) would have started.

1212253,A281FXS7SA4TB,B001KZIRKY,Alaric,"[1, 2]","In riposte to the terse polemic of J. Ventura's review, . . . ignoring the mysterious neologism 'repping':--There are MANY TOP GERMAN ACTORS playing MAJOR roles in this film.  The portrayal of the criminal indifference to their imposed sufferings on the German public of Hitler and his inner circle is the single most menacing achievement in this genre to date.  Hitler is not just the worn out neurasthenic hysteric playing the part of the victim what an entire country suffered, as he is in Downfall; where he is seen from the perspective of those who knew him personally, versus as a mere figure of power.  In Valkyrie, the 'dark side' of this is emphasized --the nature of the Junker-Prussian Officer aristocratic caste's palpable fear and barely covert outrage of the megalomaniacal, criminal and incompetent plebe as the dominating determination in the fate of Germany as a whole is done in exemplary fashion.  FM von Manstein is mentioned briefly, it is a shame that his strategic and moral opposition (nearly exclusive, in the sense of its frankness) was not fitted somewhere into the film -it would have given greater context of the overall situation and dire necessity to remove Hitler while the war in the East was still manageable- something which ceased to be possible following Operation Citadel, in conjunction with Manstein's effective dismissal.  This film achieves the kind of epically proportioned tragedy that this war truly embodies on so many different levels, for all combatants.Yes, von Stauffenberg's son asked Cruise to leave his father's memory alone (*his being Scientologist the primary consideration here*), however, aside from his personal pomposity and plane strangeness of character, the von Stauffenberg of Cruise portrayed here is well done; no 'Vanilla Sky' Tom Cruise smooth cat persona exudes to the detriment of the role and film.  Hopefully there will be abundant extra footage to flesh out the picture more fully in a multi disc release. ** And perhaps most importantly, the film is not the sort of guilt ridden, cultural Marxist (read: Germanophobic racism, in the Anglo-American liberal Progressivist tradition) apology and glorification of the participants of the failed coup.  Integral to this is Wolff's characer -ambivalently loyal to the regime, yet having been slighted by its petty bureaucratism, is prepared to lend support in true Machiavellian style, his cynical and potentially powerful hand to serve his detractors their just deserts.  He embodies the sort of full circle which Germany -and any other country under such conditions- can redeem itself: Wolf is the type of generically patriotic, prudently in awe of power and success of the restitution and expansion of the old Reich to Napoleonic proportions military man, of whom many millions of the post war generation would have shared similar passions and aspirations for their country.  Once the reigns disappear into the Jacobian abyss, with injustices and indignities mounting even against those truly loyal, he steps speculatively into the genuinely patriotic camp --though without a thought as to how the situation can be reversed at this late juncture.  The wrestling match of conscience is most waged in Wolf's mind, while the others are committed through strength of their moral instinct (with occasional, fatal intrusions of the instinct for self-preservation, a la Olbricht) -he must, and needs objectively the conditions that would quantify the necessity of making that same judgment: he understands most clearly that continuing the struggle in vain is preferable to becoming a figurehead of 'in vain' in the history of his country (a Benedict Arnold) and the world -for it only to end in death, when inevitable and objectively 'honorable' death awaits otherwise, together with the possibility of surviving the war if he continues to stay the course in his current position.  Ultimately, as many others on either side in the film, the inertia of events overwhelms the counter forces that would deny the inevitability of the 'historical dialectic' and the 'force of destiny', and assert enduring value standards against this tide.  A tragedy of Homeric proportions.",4,"Removing Hitler, Ending Nazi-ism, Staving off Sovietism:  Valkyries Against Civilizational Ragnarok (Prussia's Swan Song)",1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,4184,"['riposte', 'terse', 'polemic', 'J.', 'Ventura', 'review', 'ignoring', 'mysterious', 'neologism', ""'repping"", 'are', 'MANY', 'TOP', 'GERMAN', 'ACTORS', 'playing', 'MAJOR', 'roles', 'film', 'portrayal', 'criminal', 'indifference', 'imposed', 'sufferings', 'German', 'public', 'Hitler', 'inner', 'circle', 'single', 'most', 'menacing', 'achievement', 'genre', 'date', 'Hitler', 'not', 'just', 'worn', 'out', 'neurasthenic', 'hysteric', 'playing', 'part', 'victim', 'what', 'entire', 'country', 'suffered', 'Downfall', 'where', 'seen', 'perspective', 'who', 'knew', 'personally', 'versus', 'mere', 'figure', 'power', 'Valkyrie', ""'dark"", 'side', 'emphasized', 'nature', 'Junker-Prussian', 'Officer', 'aristocratic', 'caste', 'palpable', 'fear', 'barely', 'covert', 'outrage', 'megalomaniacal', 'criminal', 'incompetent', 'plebe', 'dominating', 'determination', 'fate', 'Germany', 'whole', 'done', 'exemplary', 'fashion', 'FM', 'von', 'Manstein', 'mentioned', 'briefly', 'shame', 'strategic', 'moral', 'opposition', 'nearly', 'exclusive', 'sense', 'frankness', 'was', 'not', 'fitted', 'somewhere', 'film', '-it', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'greater', 'context', 'overall', 'situation', 'dire', 'necessity', 'remove', 'Hitler', 'war', 'East', 'was', 'still', 'manageable-', 'something', 'ceased', 'be', 'possible', 'following', 'Operation', 'Citadel', 'conjunction', 'Manstein', 'effective', 'dismissal', 'film', 'kind', 'epically', 'proportioned', 'tragedy', 'war', 'truly', 'embodies', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'combatants.Yes', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'son', 'asked', 'Cruise', 'leave', 'father', 'memory', 'alone', '*his', 'being', 'Scientologist', 'primary', 'consideration', 'here*', 'however', 'aside', 'personal', 'pomposity', 'plane', 'strangeness', 'character', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'Cruise', 'portrayed', 'here', 'well', 'done', ""'Vanilla"", 'Sky', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'cat', 'persona', 'exudes', 'detriment', 'role', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'abundant', 'extra', 'footage', 'flesh', 'out', 'picture', 'more', 'fully', 'multi', 'disc', 'release', '**', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'not', 'sort', 'guilt', 'ridden', 'cultural', 'Marxist', 'read', 'Germanophobic', 'racism', 'Anglo-American', 'liberal', 'Progressivist', 'tradition', 'apology', 'glorification', 'participants', 'failed', 'coup', 'Integral', 'Wolff', 'characer', '-ambivalently', 'regime', 'yet', 'having', 'been', 'slighted', 'petty', 'bureaucratism', 'prepared', 'lend', 'support', 'true', 'Machiavellian', 'style', 'cynical', 'potentially', 'powerful', 'hand', 'serve', 'detractors', 'just', 'deserts', 'sort', 'full', 'circle', 'Germany', '-and', 'other', 'country', 'such', 'conditions-', 'can', 'redeem', 'Wolf', 'type', 'generically', 'patriotic', 'prudently', 'awe', 'power', 'success', 'restitution', 'expansion', 'old', 'Reich', 'Napoleonic', 'proportions', 'military', 'man', 'whom', 'many', 'millions', 'post', 'war', 'generation', 'would', 'have', 'shared', 'similar', 'passions', 'aspirations', 'country', 'reigns', 'disappear', 'Jacobian', 'abyss', 'injustices', 'indignities', 'mounting', 'even', 'truly', 'loyal', 'speculatively', 'genuinely', 'patriotic', 'camp', 'thought', 'how', 'situation', 'can', 'be', 'reversed', 'late', 'juncture', 'wrestling', 'match', 'conscience', 'most', 'waged', 'Wolf', 'mind', 'others', 'are', 'committed', 'strength', 'moral', 'instinct', 'occasional', 'fatal', 'intrusions', 'instinct', 'self-preservation', 'la', 'Olbricht', '-he', 'must', 'objectively', 'conditions', 'would', 'quantify', 'necessity', 'making', 'same', 'judgment', 'most', 'clearly', 'continuing', 'struggle', 'vain', 'preferable', 'becoming', 'figurehead', ""'in"", 'vain', 'history', 'country', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'world', 'only', 'end', 'death', 'when', 'inevitable', 'objectively', ""'honorable"", 'death', 'awaits', 'otherwise', 'together', 'possibility', 'surviving', 'war', 'stay', 'course', 'current', 'position', 'Ultimately', 'many', 'others', 'side', 'film', 'inertia', 'events', 'counter', 'forces', 'would', 'deny', 'inevitability', ""'historical"", 'dialectic', ""'force"", 'destiny', 'assert', 'enduring', 'value', 'standards', 'tide', 'tragedy', 'Homeric', 'proportions']",Valkyrie

1212255,A14N5L5T089VX3,B001KZIRKY,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[125, 142]","All Historical Dramas faithful to the actual events run the risk of being dry and boring.  Fortunately, although it is a bit dry here and there, the producers of Valkyrie didn't stray too far in that direction.  The story is well-told, and I did not feel that it dragged or got into excessive and boring detail at any point.  If you are a student of WWII, and particularly this famous failed attempt to assassinate Hitler, you will be pleased with the quality of the film, the acting, and the film's faithfulness to facts and to the tone of the times.  The film brings forth many details of which I was not aware, and the historical facts I know-of from past research are accurately portrayed.It is clear computer graphics are used extensively in this film, since many of the scenes could not have been filmed in any other way, more than 60 years after events took place.  The special effects are for the most part well done, and are not intrusive - clearly used only as needed to support the story instead of being an excuse to show-off a studio's CGI capabilities.As for acting, this story was an excellent vehicle for Tom Cruise.  I feel Cruise's portrayal of Colonel von Stauffenburg, who was a central figure in the assassination plot and this story, was excellent and believable.  Some may argue that the characterization is a bit wooden, but I suspect this may be intentional on Cruise's part, and in keeping with the historical figure: a decorated soldier filled with anger towards Hitler, who could survive in the upper levels of the German Army only by masking his true feelings.The rest of the cast is phenomenal. I was amazed at the number of familiar and respected actors and actresses that appeared in relatively minor roles throughout the film.  Not a single performance was less than I would expect from such a cast.The film is not a light-hearted one, nor does it end well for most of the characters.  There are several bloody scenes, but none of the violence is gratuitous.

Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) returns from battle in Tunisia missing an eye, a hand and a couple of fingers.2. Not being a man to let such trivialities stand in his way, he's soon back in uniform, with the addition of a dashing eye patch and a glass eye in a little carrying case.3. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) tries a little sleight of wine trick, but this proves to be yet another little hiccup in the plan to dispose of Hitler.4. Von Stauffenberg is soon recruited to join the plot to free Germany from Hitler, his co-conspirators including  General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy), Colonel General Ludwig Beck (Terrence Stamp), Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, and retired Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben5.

The one thing about the movie that probably isn't terribly accurate is the use of English-speaking actors as the main characters. It sort of takes away from the feel of the movie. Some of the scenes of the movie were filmed on-location at actual spots from the real-life action. I enjoyed this movie because it's a famous episode from World War II that most people have heard of but maybe don't know the details of. However, I thought the movie lacked a little punch. A lot of charaters come into the story without a lot of introduction or buildup. At times it makes the story a little confusing or lacking in emotional power. This is one of those movies that sort of does its job with clinical efficiency but lacks in memorable moments or emotion. I didn't find myself caring much about any of the characters or having an emotional reaction to much that happened.

1212260,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B001KZIRKY,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","A good film about the Von Stauffenberg plot, the conspiracy that almost succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler during the later stages of World War II. It doesn't start very promisingly: things happen fast (we have Von Stauffenberg severely injured in a battle in North Africa, losing an arm, three fingers and an eye, and a few minutes later we have him joining the conspiracy, without explaining very well his motivations) and characters are introduced hastily without explaining well who they are. But as the movie progresses and we get into the plot itself (which was more than about killing the Fuhrer; knowing that that wouldn't be enough to end Germany's dreadful situation, they also have a complicated plan to take power and be able to sue the allies for peace in terms that would not be disastrous for Germany), it gets more and more gripping with a superb final hour. The mostly British cast here (among them, Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy), acquit themselves very well. Tom Cruise, however, while not a disaster, is just not very believable as a German officer. Besides his limited acting range, his demeanor has always been very American, so he is just not very believable playing people from other countries. I can think of other actors who could have been great in this role: for example, Thomas Kretschmann, who plays a Major who has a key role in breaking the coup attempt, could have been a great Von Stauffenberg. Still, this was better than expected as director Bryan Singer (of the X-Men franchise) certainly knows how to make a gripping, entertaining movie.

I think most of my review of this movie is about Bryan Singer (the director) We all (well, most of us) know how Hitler died. So this movie is all about how the director present them. The emotion, the passion, the thrill, the tensions and the logic.... but it's kinda lacking in some aspects I mentioned above. Example, the logical aspect, why did Bryan has to show us how Hitler and his important people got blown off by the bomb Stauffenberg put, why didn't he just leave it to how Stauffenberg percepted it? that really bothers me since we know this misson is gonna fail. Is it just a reason to make a pretty cool special effect? or make it more ""action""?And I like Tom Cruise acting overall even in the Lions for Lambs which they said it's kinda fail. But in this one, I think Bryan put way too much close up to Tom's face (to show expression, I guess) but it just didn't deliver it to me, at least. And it's just way too much, seriously.I feel depressed watching this movie until when the end message reminded me that this movie is intended to be a tribute to heroic and brave people who are willing to sacrifice themselves for justice and freedom , etc. That start touch my heart, but how about the other 14 known attempts to put out Hitler (as Bryan himself said it at the end message..?) Bryan...Bryan... I like his works at X Men series and even Superman Returns, though. But not on this one, even the acting are pretty solid... but just the way Bryan present this story (which we pretty much know the ending already, most of us do).... doesn't have quite a bite in it.

I just couldn't shake myself off the idea of 21st Century Hollywood production of a World War II picture (hello...Pearl Harbor, anyone?). Finally, I said, ""The hell with it, I'll just suffer."" It was an all right picture despite the obvious inaccuracies displayed. First of all, Hitler's eyes were blue, not brown! That was a simple fact that was apparently overlooked by everybody involved, even the researchers themselves. Second, Germans didn't speak English; they spoke German. Third, Hitler always wore military uniforms, not civilian clothes, during meetings of such matters. Anyway, who cares?

New York PressThe above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films,The Usual Suspects).Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best sinceCollateralandMinority Report). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a clich&eacute; here in that ""I was on the edge of my seat"" throughout the second half of the film.So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND.

1212289,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001KZIRKY,Caleb Williams,"[6, 9]","We all know who Hitler is. If you don't, you're an idiot. If you don't, let me give you a very short and vague lesson as to the man that is Hitler. Hitler = very evil man, killed many people, tried to create a German empire and almost succeeded, became a bit too power hungry and had his allies turn against him. Now you know Hitler, then this can lead you on the path to understanding this film and just exactly what operation Valkyrie was.Operation Valkyrie is an operation put in place by Hitler which ensures that in the event of allied bombings on major German cities that may cause disruption to law & order and the upper authorities, that order and law is upheld. This is the basic ways in which operation Valkyrie would work and the movie tells the story of how Colonel Claus von Staufenberg (Cruise) and other major figures in Hitler's army attempt to use operation Valkyrie to their advantage to help the takeover of Hitler's government after he's assassinated.Of course, many people can be forgiven for thinking that Hitler's Germany was all on his side. After all, that's the way it is portrayed in our school history lessons. Very rarely are we shown the good side of Germany, and very rarely are we taught about the numerous attempts on the Fuhrer's life. ""Valkyrie"" brings one of the more infamous attempts on Hitler's life to the big screen, which develops into one of the most thrilling movies of the year.The film itself starts off with an attempt on Hitler's life as Major-General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) hides a bomb within a wine case which is brought onto the same plane as Hitler as he leaves the airfield. The Bomb doesn't detonate and Tresckow is approached by fellow conspirator General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) who informs Tresckow that another member of their secret committee was arrested and therefore must be replaced. A recommendation is made that General Claus von Staufenberg (Cruise) should be brought in to help develop a new plan of action.Throughout the film there is some fantastic dialogue which ignites genuine discussion over the nature of the German people during war time. Were all Germans 100% behind Hitler or were they simply taken intimidated by his prowess and posture? From the appearance of this film it would seem that some of his highest ranking generals weren't even an ounce behind him. It's not only the historical depiction that is great about this film but it's more about the way it's filmed and the appearance of the cast. The settings seem authentic and in some senses present an intimidating portrait of the Nazi's we have come to know about today.Although this film is based around the plot to kill Hitler and restore Germany's dignity before they are invaded by the allies, we see very little of Hitler himself, played by David Bamber. The depiction of the Fuhrer is that of a frail, beaten old man who says very little. This is in high contrast to the electrifying and terrifying speeches we have seen him perform before his followers. Maybe the brief sightings of Hitler allow for the terrifying image we hold to stay within, whilst presenting this brief glimpse to remind us that ""this is the man who must die.""It's a brilliantly shot, brilliantly acted and brilliantly paced film. Tom Cruise is astonishing as always and I think the many criticisms that I have heard about this film are highly unjust.",5,A Stunning Historical Spectacle,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,3391,"['know', 'who', 'Hitler', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'idiot', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'give', 'very', 'short', 'vague', 'lesson', 'man', 'Hitler', 'Hitler', '=', 'very', 'evil', 'man', 'killed', 'many', 'people', 'tried', 'create', 'German', 'empire', 'almost', 'succeeded', 'became', 'bit', 'too', 'power', 'hungry', 'had', 'allies', 'turn', 'Now', 'know', 'Hitler', 'then', 'can', 'lead', 'path', 'understanding', 'film', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'operation', 'Valkyrie', 'was.Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'operation', 'put', 'place', 'Hitler', 'event', 'allied', 'bombings', 'major', 'German', 'cities', 'may', 'cause', 'disruption', 'law', 'order', 'upper', 'authorities', 'order', 'law', 'upheld', 'basic', 'ways', 'operation', 'Valkyrie', 'would', 'work', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'Colonel', 'Claus', 'von', 'Staufenberg', 'Cruise', 'other', 'major', 'figures', 'Hitler', 'army', 'attempt', 'use', 'operation', 'Valkyrie', 'advantage', 'help', 'takeover', 'Hitler', 'government', 'assassinated.Of', 'course', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'was', 'side', 'way', 'portrayed', 'school', 'history', 'lessons', 'Very', 'rarely', 'are', 'shown', 'good', 'side', 'Germany', 'very', 'rarely', 'are', 'taught', 'numerous', 'attempts', 'Fuhrer', 'life', 'Valkyrie', 'one', 'more', 'infamous', 'attempts', 'Hitler', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'most', 'thrilling', 'movies', 'year.The', 'film', 'off', 'attempt', 'Hitler', 'life', 'Major-General', 'Henning', 'von', 'Tresckow', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'bomb', 'wine', 'case', 'brought', 'same', 'plane', 'as', 'Hitler', 'airfield', 'Bomb', ""n't"", 'detonate', 'Tresckow', 'approached', 'fellow', 'conspirator', 'General', 'Friedrich', 'Olbricht', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'informs', 'Tresckow', 'member', 'secret', 'committee', 'was', 'arrested', 'therefore', 'must', 'be', 'replaced', 'recommendation', 'made', 'General', 'Claus', 'von', 'Staufenberg', 'Cruise', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'help', 'develop', 'new', 'plan', 'film', 'fantastic', 'dialogue', 'genuine', 'discussion', 'nature', 'German', 'people', 'war', 'time', 'Were', '100', '%', 'Hitler', 'were', 'simply', 'taken', 'intimidated', 'prowess', 'posture', 'appearance', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'highest', 'ranking', 'generals', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'ounce', 'not', 'only', 'historical', 'depiction', 'great', 'film', 'more', 'way', 'filmed', 'appearance', 'cast', 'settings', 'seem', 'authentic', 'senses', 'present', 'intimidating', 'portrait', 'Nazi', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'about', 'film', 'based', 'plot', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'restore', 'Germany', 'dignity', 'are', 'invaded', 'allies', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'Hitler', 'played', 'David', 'Bamber', 'depiction', 'Fuhrer', 'frail', 'beaten', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'high', 'contrast', 'electrifying', 'terrifying', 'speeches', 'have', 'seen', 'perform', 'followers', 'Maybe', 'brief', 'sightings', 'Hitler', 'allow', 'terrifying', 'image', 'hold', 'stay', 'whilst', 'presenting', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'remind', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'die', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'brilliantly', 'paced', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'astonishing', 'always', 'think', 'many', 'criticisms', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'are', 'highly', 'unjust']",Valkyrie

It is quite another in the 21st century to have all American and British actors playing Germans in WWII in their own American and British voices.  There is the necessity of making a viewer feel like he or she is there when recreating history in the movies.  I never felt as if I was in WWII Nazi Germany.  The rest of the film was faithful enough to the event.  Specifically, it studies the July 1944 assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler as masterminded by Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise).  I found it interesting if a bit plodding at times.  I don't need such linear and literal reenactments of history.  I appreciate more imaginative retellings.

1212293,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B001KZIRKY,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 2]","The best laid plans are still subject to accident, coincidence, and unforeseen challenges. That is certainly a theme of the excellent film Valkyrie. Tom Cruise plays a heroic and noble figure, brave and fully in the right, and yet tragically fails in his mission against evil forces purely due to accident and coincidence. The maturity of this theme elevates this film beyond a World War II suspense film. The good guys lose, which is often the case in the real world. Yet even though anyone who knows the least about history knows the end of the film before it begins, the film makers were able to create an entertaining suspenseful movie that kept me hoping that the good guys would be able to pull off a stunt that would have saved over a million lives.  Tom Cruise does an a great job and fully demonstrates that he can play mature middle aged men grappling with conflict. Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a key player in the assassination attempt, and noble risk taker. The entire cast is superb and even though there are multiple levels of military and political ranks to navigate, the film does this effortlessly so we are clear about good guys, bad guys, and ambivalent guys. The film has a grand old European feel as interior shots are perfectly appointed and exterior shots have a golden glow. In the end the film appears to have been a highly accurate portrayal of actual historic events and characters, played realistically.

With any Hollywood movie covering such a sensitive historical event, there is always going to controversy over which facts are emphasized, omitted, or ""embellished"". I found ""Valkyrie"" to be an exciting movie that remained close enough to the historical realities to still be considered worthwhile.Since the plot is taken directly from history, and everyone knows (or should know) that Hitler died by his own hand less than a year after the events portrayed in this movie, I'm not going to worry about giving away any spoilers. Towards the end of WWII, even some of the most loyal German officers realized that Hitler had lost both the war and likely his mind. In addition, the general Army officers often resented and feared the power and inhuman methods of the SS and Gestapo. ""Valkerie"" follows the core group of officers that devised a plan to assassinate Hitler, neutralize the SS and Gestapo, and sue for peace with the advancing Allies.This was a very well made movie, setting the right atmosphere with the music, set and costume design, and really good cinematography (the shots of the forests were just amazing). The cast was first rate, with Tom Cruise (I'm not really a fan) skillfully portraying a confident and somewhat arrogant Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. My only major complaint was with the wild fluctuation of sound volume that resulted in us having to stop, turn up the volume, and replay some scenes to hear the dialog, only to be deafened when the next LOUD event started.Overall, ""Valkyrie"" was an engaging movie that was good exposure for my teenagers to an important event.

In that it largely succeeds. It also sets out to revive Tom Cruise's somewhat stalled career. In that... well, time will tell. It always does, as the Doctor once said.The movie focuses on the formation of a plot to kill Hitler using Operation Valkyrie, a plan originally drafted to maintain law and order in the Reich in the event of Allied bombings destroying Berlin. The plotters, led by Claus von Stauffenberg, played ably by Tom Cruise, planned to use Valkyrie as a way to round up the SS and take control of the government after assassinating Hitler.The July 20 plot to kill Adolf Hitler was one of fifteen that failed to do so over the years (I do hope I'm not spoiling the movie for you by pointing out he doesn't die). Knowing that Hitler survives makes this movie less about his assassination and more about how close the coup plotters came to success, even though the Fuher lived. Before the plot began to fall apart, we see that they'd managed to take over the government quarter, arrested much of the SS heirarchy and were about to arrest Goebbels (something his children, in retrospect, might've appreciated). In the end, in fact, the only thing that caused the coup to fail was the fact that, well, Hitler wasn't dead. Ooops.It's interesting for someone like me, who loves history and enjoys reading alternate history, to ponder how things might've gone different had the plot worked. Had Hitler died, had the plotters been more on the ball and moved faster, or even, heck had the other plot shown in the movie worked, just what would've happened? (for the record, I believe the Allies would've negotiated with a new government, but Stalin would've demanded territorial concessions, like, for example, Poland, which might've caused the whole thing to collapse)The movie is tense and entertaining. The fact that it was shot in Germany lends a nice authenticity to the movie that is spoiled only by the fact that none of the leads has a German accent. The pacing is good, the sets are great, etc, etc.Ah, but you want to know about Tom Cruise, right? Well, I'm not a fan of his work in general. I find him to be very overrated and, in fact, one of the only things I've seen him in that I really enjoyed was Tropic Thunder.But that said his performance in this movie is adequette.

1212299,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B001KZIRKY,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","The plot to kill Hitler. This is a well documented true story. But I have to say that I felt sick at my stomach watching this film. The entire movie was set up to feature Tom Cruise (who I really enjoy as an actor), but in doing so, lost much of its credibility. I am a huge WW2 history fan, and so I watched this with an open mind.Though the events are more or less accurate, the execution here fails. Compared with a film such as Downfall, this is trash. I'm sorry if you disagree, but if you are rating this five stars and haven't seen Downfall, you need to do so immediately.The acting is probably the worst thing about this film. I am appalled that the film was in English (so they could feature American actors) and I am sure if it had been in German it wouldn't have raked in a lot of cash. So I don't really blame the producers there. But could we have at least TRIED to have the actors playing Germans actually affect a German accent? Would that be too much to ask? Mel Gibson affected a Scottish accent for Braveheart... even Tom Cruise affected an Irish accent for Far and Away. Perhaps the director and producers felt that having Tom Cruise as the top billed actor could convince people to ignore some of these issues.The other problem I have is that the film just didn't really seem to be all that interesting. The National Geographic documentary ""42 Ways to Kill Hitler"" was hands down more interesting than this film.The only kudos I give are to the good performances from a few key actors and the beautiful and accurate set designs. I just felt the film lacked continuity. Project Valkyrie was an amazing effort by Germans to assassinate a despot whom they felt would bring Germany crashing down... though the plot very nearly succeeded, alas, as we all know, it failed. I will say that the final scenes were 100% spot on accurate to what I have seen on documentaries and read about. So I give three stars.For a real look into these plots check out: 42 Ways to Kill Hitler. Or check out my favorite WW2 film depicting the German side of things: Downfall [DVD]. Just watch this film with an open mind, and take everything in with a grain of salt.

1212300,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B001KZIRKY,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[2, 2]","Surprising because Tom Cruise apparently took some critical knocks but, here, they aren't warranted. Cruise, in an unexpectedly effective turn from the kind of work with which he is most associated, comes up with an effective and even convincing performance as the Nazi-era German Col. Claus von Stauffenberg who directs an attempt to save literally all of Eurpoe by killing his boss - his Fuhrer, Adolph Hitler. Based on actual events that came to a head July 20, 1944, when a bomb that was planted with Hitler standing only feet away failed to hit its target, Valkyrie was the German code name of the operation to be implemented to keep Hitler's Germany on the Fuhrer's course in the event of his death. The plot, the last known of 15 attempts by German resistant forces to kill Hitler and his vision for the country, is arguably the best known to history as cited in memorials throughout Berlin honoring the lives of the conspirators. This film version, incredibly well acted with a stellar cast that includes Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh and the always-superb Tom Wilkinson, comes across with passion, compassion, historic accuracy and a sense of respect for those German military men who snubbed their loyalty oath to Hitler in an attempt to close what they saw even then to be one of the darkest chapters in human history. The film didn't slay any giants at the box office or come close to blockbuster status. That's a shame, if for no other reason than the historic importance of the film didn't hit a mass audience. The film deserved a better commerical showing, and perhaps it will find its just due in the home DVD market. Also unfortunate is the critical slam Cruise was dealt; it isn't justified. Literally within weeks of the failed July 20 plot, most of its architects were executed; ironically, just nine months later, with Berlin surounded by the Red Army and the threat of other Allied forces nearing, Hitler committed suicide. The viewer who is unfamiliar with the history of the event probably will not fully appreciate the film's purpose and message, but so it goes with any other movie based on historic events. This film is too important to be missed if for no other reason than to show that not all the men and women in Hitler's regime shared the evil that cloaked their Fuhrer.",5,"Surprising, and an important footnote to history",1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2303,"['Surprising', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'apparently', 'took', 'critical', 'knocks', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'warranted', 'Cruise', 'unexpectedly', 'effective', 'turn', 'kind', 'work', 'most', 'associated', 'up', 'effective', 'even', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Nazi-era', 'German', 'Col.', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'who', 'attempt', 'save', 'literally', 'Eurpoe', 'killing', 'boss', 'Fuhrer', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'Based', 'actual', 'events', 'came', 'head', 'July', '20', '1944', 'when', 'bomb', 'was', 'planted', 'Hitler', 'standing', 'only', 'feet', 'away', 'failed', 'hit', 'target', 'Valkyrie', 'was', 'German', 'code', 'name', 'operation', 'be', 'implemented', 'keep', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'Fuhrer', 'course', 'event', 'death', 'plot', 'last', 'known', '15', 'attempts', 'German', 'resistant', 'forces', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'vision', 'country', 'arguably', 'best', 'known', 'history', 'cited', 'memorials', 'Berlin', 'honoring', 'lives', 'conspirators', 'film', 'version', 'incredibly', 'well', 'acted', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'always-superb', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'passion', 'compassion', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'sense', 'respect', 'German', 'military', 'men', 'who', 'snubbed', 'loyalty', 'oath', 'Hitler', 'attempt', 'close', 'what', 'saw', 'even', 'then', 'be', 'one', 'darkest', 'chapters', 'human', 'history', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'slay', 'giants', 'box', 'office', 'come', 'close', 'blockbuster', 'status', 'shame', 'other', 'reason', 'historic', 'importance', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'mass', 'audience', 'film', 'deserved', 'better', 'commerical', 'showing', 'perhaps', 'will', 'find', 'just', 'due', 'home', 'DVD', 'market', 'Also', 'unfortunate', 'critical', 'slam', 'Cruise', 'was', 'dealt', ""n't"", 'justified', 'Literally', 'weeks', 'failed', 'July', '20', 'plot', 'most', 'architects', 'were', 'executed', 'ironically', 'just', 'nine', 'months', 'later', 'Berlin', 'surounded', 'Red', 'Army', 'threat', 'other', 'Allied', 'forces', 'nearing', 'Hitler', 'committed', 'suicide', 'viewer', 'who', 'unfamiliar', 'history', 'event', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'film', 'purpose', 'message', 'other', 'movie', 'based', 'historic', 'events', 'film', 'too', 'important', 'be', 'missed', 'other', 'reason', 'show', 'not', 'men', 'women', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'shared', 'evil', 'cloaked', 'Fuhrer']",Valkyrie

As I noted in Collateral, Cruise has the ability to drive a film, and he does it here.Even though we all know the actual outcome, I somehow found myself hoping that Stauffenberg would succeed and a new government come to power in Germany. Flawless direction, an excellent supporting cast, authentic-appearing sets, uniforms, vehicles, and airplanes created an incredible illusion of reality. Plenty of suspense.The film built a compelling atmosphere of the fear endured by those engaged in a conspiracy surrounded by hostile forces in a police state. These brave men and women had their necks on the line.This movie inspired me to delve a little deeper into the story. According to Wikipedia, 4,980 people were executed in the aftermath of the failed assassination, many of them high officials in the German military/government. These executions gutted the German resistance movement against Hitler. It seems certain that if Hitler had died at the ""Wolf's Lair,"" Operation Valkyrie would have succeeded. That is, a Nazi-less government would have come to power. This government would have negotiated a quick end to the war, thus stopping all the atrocities committed by the Hitler regime between July of 1944 and the end of the war in Europe in May of 1945. And, of course, saving all of those who died in the heavy fighting during this period.The film has historical value in that it illustrates the widespread opposition to Hitler's regime among the German people.",5,Superb,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,1609,"['Tom', 'Cruise', 'great', 'performance', 'Colonel', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'leader', '20', 'July', '1944', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'noted', 'Collateral', 'Cruise', 'ability', 'drive', 'film', 'here.Even', 'know', 'actual', 'outcome', 'somehow', 'found', 'hoping', 'Stauffenberg', 'would', 'succeed', 'new', 'government', 'come', 'power', 'Germany', 'Flawless', 'direction', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'authentic-appearing', 'sets', 'uniforms', 'vehicles', 'airplanes', 'created', 'incredible', 'illusion', 'reality', 'Plenty', 'suspense.The', 'film', 'built', 'compelling', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'endured', 'engaged', 'conspiracy', 'surrounded', 'hostile', 'forces', 'police', 'state', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'had', 'necks', 'line.This', 'movie', 'inspired', 'delve', 'little', 'deeper', 'story', 'According', 'Wikipedia', '4,980', 'people', 'were', 'executed', 'aftermath', 'failed', 'assassination', 'many', 'high', 'officials', 'German', 'military/government', 'executions', 'gutted', 'German', 'resistance', 'movement', 'Hitler', 'certain', 'Hitler', 'had', 'died', 'Wolf', 'Lair', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'would', 'have', 'succeeded', 'Nazi-less', 'government', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'power', 'government', 'would', 'have', 'negotiated', 'quick', 'end', 'war', 'thus', 'stopping', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'July', '1944', 'end', 'war', 'Europe', 'May', '1945', 'course', 'saving', 'who', 'died', 'heavy', 'fighting', 'period.The', 'film', 'historical', 'value', 'widespread', 'opposition', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'German', 'people']",Valkyrie

Tom Cruise plays Klaus von Stauffenberg, the man tasked with setting the explosive device and who was severely maimed, losing the use of one arm and half his other hand during a battle several years before.Cruise doesn't do a bad job in the role, to his credit. I was able to see beyond ""this is Tom Cruise"" and connect with his character. An excellent supporting case including Hugh Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and Eddie Izzard (yes, Eddie Izzard) really help Cruise and the movie which runs the risk of trying to tell too much and getting bogged down with detail.In this age of CGI, blood and gore, it was quite nice to watch a character-driven movie that relied on acting more than effects. There are some, I hasten to add for those ""action"" people, but this is more a drama than an action flick. The story is pretty much on-target with the history of the July 20th plot and there is a good balance between telling us what we need to know in order to follow the story without confusing us while doing so.This film, like so many others of this kind runs into problems with a pet peeve of mine: accents. Tom Cruise is a talented actor. I am sure he is capable of putting on a German, or British accent, but he doesn't. Not a problem, necessarily, except that he is surrounded by a mixture of British and German accents with no obvious differences as to who speaks what. I don't know why directors let this happen. It's not a big deal, I guess, to many viewers, but if everyone's supposed to be from the same place, at least get some form of similarity in accents, rather than allow each actor to decide ""how"" they're going to speak.Sigh.Anyway, other than that, everyone in the main cast well lives up to their assigned roles. Special Kudos to Bill Nighy for an excellent, indecisive General Olbricht.The inner circle of Hitler (Goering, Goebbels, Himmler, Speer) are secondary to this story and rightly so. Even Hitler is involved when he absolutely needs to be, keeping the focus of the story on the plot, rather than the target and the job is excellent in this regards. David Bamber is an okay Hitler, for what's it's worth. Harvey Friedman isn't a particularly good Goebbels other than he looks the part. However, none of this really detracts from the film.So, to conclude...if you know the story, this is still a film worth watching. There are no surprised for those who do know the history. It's nice to see that decent historical-drama type of films are still made and able to attract big names. If you're looking for ""Private Ryan"" action, this isn't for you.

Viewers observe his subsequent routine once he is home, having to cope with his physical challenges. Cruise's performance ranges from bland and staid to fairly charismatic. Dutch actress Carice Van Houten, who gave a bravura performance in another World War II era epic, ""Black Book"", plays his wife, Nina.By the summer of 1944, the Third Reich was in its last phase of evil that had been far too triumphant.With a group of high-ranking officials, who realize ( as most Germans did as early as 1942 by which time there were a few large countries with consequently large armies opposing them)that their country was fighting a losing conflict, including Major general Henning von Tresckow( Kenneth Branagh),Tresckow's aide, played by Tresckow's real-life grandson, Philipp von Schulthess, Colonel Albrecht Ritter(Christian Berkel), General Fredrich Olbricht(Bill Nighy), Colonel General Ludwig Beck(real-life Blitz survivor, Terrence Stamp), Dr. Carl Fredrich Goerdeler(Kevin McNally)who plans to become the new Chancellor after the overthrow,Lieutenant Werner von Haeften(Jamie Parker), General Erich Fellgiebel(Eddie Izzard),Wolf-Henrich Graf von Helldorf(Waldemar Kobus),and Field Marshal Erwin von Wizleben(David Schofield), Stauffenberg, who had initially admired Hitler realizes the need for an end to the madness.Each men will donate his skills and military clout to what will be known as the July 20th Plot, the last known plot to kill Hitler(David Bamber), and give Germany an honorable exit from the war.Tom Wilkinson's Colonel General Fredrich Fromm is painted as a more sympathetic character in this movie.With his wife and children safe in Switzerland, we watch  Stauffenberg and cohorts enact Operation Valkyrie. Perhaps the thing that has struck me the most was watching one of the secretaries receiving the premature message of Der Fuerher's passing do so with tears in her eyes--a fascinating depiction of someone on the wrong side of history.The conspirators have their dealings with those of Hitler's inner circle, including Luftwaffe Commander Herman Goring (Gerhard Haase-Hindenberg),and Albert Speer(Anton Algrang). But it is Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels(Harvey Friedman) who presides over a fateful moment during the incident.Viewers are reminded of how the world may have been different had the plot gone as planned.

He knew all about it and told me to check it out in the history books. He was one of the soldiers, an Army Ranger in C Company, that landed on Normandy Beach in France at D-Day, June 6, 1944. He told me that if Col. von Stauffenberg had succeeded in his plot to assassinate Hitler only six weeks later, the war would have been over by the end of July, and General Patton would not have had to start the winter offensive called the Battle of the Bulge. He said he personally would have wanted to shake the hand of Col. von Stauffenberg (the character portrayed so well by Tom Cruise). As it turned out, he admired the Col. for his courage and what turned out to be a suicide mission.The film is excellent in every department - production and art design, locations, directing, acting, costume design, music score, attention to detail, everything looks completely authentic to the period. This film is a real tribute to the memory of a true hero, Col. von Stauffenberg, not only a hero of Deutschland, the German people, and to all Jews everywhere, but to the entire free world, and his stalwart company of dedicated men who gave their lives for the cause of freedom from the tyranny of Hitler's Third Reich.The movie was filmed entirely on location in Germany, and is available in a special German-language version for the people of Germany. This is an important film in the history of world cinema, and a must-see for anyone interested in history, World War II, or the history of Germany, or anyone who loves a great drama.I understand the production company had to receive a special permit to use the Nazi swastika symbol on their flags and other props throughout the production of the picture, because the Nazi swastika is totally illegal in modern Germany.I give this picture five stars!

This is a movie that is pure quality, made by filmmakers and actors who pay fitting tribute to a small group of German patriots who almost pulled off the impossible in July, 1944.I knew about this assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler at the Wolf's Lair in the summer of 1944; what I didn't know is how elaborate it was, how many were involved, and how they almost pulled off a coup mobilizing the German Reserve Army under a directive signed by the Fuhrer himself (Operation Valkyrie).  I also didn't know the conspirators were almost exclusively of the aristocratic class, from General Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp) to Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise).  All were men (and women) horrified at what the Nazis had done to their beloved Germany, along with all the atrocities and brutality; they wanted to take control and negotiate with the Allies for peace--before all of Germany lie in ruins.  But before they could negotiate, they had to take control of the government, and taking control of the government meant killing Hitler.What a story.  And as the events of Operation Valkyrie transpire--even though we all know how it plays out--the viewer is taken on a magnificent thrill-seeking ride, culminating in an emotional, powerful ending.  And the cast--top notch.  No, I'm no fan of Tom Cruise, but here he turns in a commanding, extraordinary performance as Colonel von Stauffenberg, the leader of Operation Valkyrie.  Cruise is surrounded by quite an impressive ensemble, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Carice von Houten.  Look for a quick cameo by Bernard Hill.  David Bamber plays a very believable Hitler right down to the Fuhrer's creepy mannerisms, while Jamie Parker is very good in his small role as Stauffenberg's loyal-to-the-last-second aide.Special features.  This special edition contains a commentary by Cruise, director Bryan Singer, and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie.  The commentary contains a plethora of information--not only about making the movie and what the actors were experiencing, but bountiful historical snippets and information about the characters themselves.  It's extremely informative and entertaining (and Cruise has a fantastic sense of humor).  This DVD also contains the documentary ""The Valkyrie Legacy"", which aired on The History Channel.  It, too, is very compelling and informative.  As a special edition this DVD for VALKYRIE is just about as good as it gets.  A must-have for all historical and film buffs.--D.

The result of the failed assassination attempt by Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg (a Nazi who saw the evil in Hitler after the insane attack on Russia) did cause enough injuries to the evil dictator and megalomaniac to slow him down and make him even more unstable, insane and paranoid. This made him more of a nuisance than an asset to his Generals planning the defence of Nazi occupied Europe. All these factors hastened the end of the horrible 3rd Reich and the brutal and painful end of the vertically challenged dwarf. I knew someone like that once and I told him to his repulsive face, ""You can never have what you most desire and that is to be tall like me."" Ha!, he did not take it well, which pleased me greatly. I am certain that he too will come to a bad end like that creepo swine Hitler.Based in fact, this movie is very well acted and Tom Cruise excels in his potrayal of the aristocratic war hero who lost one eye and other body parts in the fighting in Tunisia after being strafed by Allied fighters. He makes a bomb using time pencil detonators developed by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) for sabotage missions against the Nazis in occupied Europe. Ah the irony of life! These silent aluminium detonators have to be crimped with pliers to break the capsule of acid inside, which then slowly eats through the wire. This is the time delay before detonation. When the wire breaks, the bomb detonates. Von Stauffenberg packs the bomb in a leather briefcase stuffed full of 'plastique' and tries his best to do the noble deed... but he is thwarted by destiny. At first, they think their ""Putsch"", which is German for Coup d'etat is successful, but then when they find out that Hitler is still alive, they lose their nerve and things go against them. The 60th anniversary of Stauffenberg's failed assassination attempt against Hitler of July 20, 1944, will be officially commemorated in Germany on Monday, July 20, 2009.German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung led a wreath-laying ceremony on Monday at a memorial in the Bendlerblock courtyard, the former Nazi war ministry in Berlin, where Stauffenberg aged 36, and three fellow conspirators were executed by firing squad hours after the bomb went off. In the movie, Tom Cruise, in his best role yet, in my humble opinion, shouts before the bullets hit him, ""Ich liebe die Freiheit"" which translates as ""I love Freedom"". In actual fact, the real Colonel shouted, ""Long live holy Germany!"" oder ,,Leben lang heiligen Deutschland!""Well, at the very least he was a patriot at heart. Operation Valkyrie actually comes from Hitler's favourite composer's work Der Ring des Nibelungen in which the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" features. There are four operas in this Ring-Cycle.I believe that to this day, Richard Wagner's works of music are banned in Israel.The Nibelung of the title is the dwarf Alberich. Perhaps Hitler identified with the dwarf seeing as he was a malevolent midget himself, Ha! Ha! The Valkyries are warrior-maidens, daughters of Wotan.May all dictators whether it be Mao Tse Tung, Mussolini, Napoleon or Kim Jong Il, die horrible, slow, painful deaths, and may they rot in hell forever.

I knew the story about how the briefcase with the bomb was randomly pushed behind a stanchion which held up the table ~ thus (inadvertently) saving Hitler's life.  Like most people, that's all that I knew about the plot, other than that fact that a great many Nazis (including the legendary ""DESERT FOX"" Erwin Rommell) were rounded up & executed.I found this film to be quite illuminating as it elaborated on the grand-plot to not only whack Hitler but also to take control of Berlin and (eventually) the entire German military force.  The plan was quite ingenious;  to mobilize the Berlin reserve forces (kind of like Hitler's very own private National Guard) to impose order under the false-pretenses that the Gestapo was guilty of regicide.While the plot ultimately failed, I never knew just how close they came to succeding ~ not just in killing Hitler but also in overthrowing Hitler's government.  I suspect most people who see this movie will be as surprised as I was.This is what I like to refer to as an unconventional war movie in that it deals with a subplot of a war rather than a battle or a military leader.  As such, it is a superb bit of history.  And, of course, it's always refreshing to see a movie where the Gestapo are bullied & pushed around.

Based on the failed attempt to assassinate Adolph Hitler in 1944 (or, as the ads say, ""based on the incredible true story""), the movie follows Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg as he leads a conspiracy to blow up der F&uuml;hrer in his Wolfsschanze, putting von Stauffenberg and his family in jeopardy. (The wife of von Stauffenberg was pregnant at the time, a fact just hinted at here.) The film didn't fare well at the holiday box office, maybe because the release was poorly timed, but maybe because the moviegoing masses simply didn't know what it was all about. I understand a recent survey revealed the astonishing fact that a great number of people think the Germans were our allies in World War II! Hopefully,now that the DVD is released, the picture will be more readily available to a discerning audience. It's well worth seeing, intelligently written by Christopher MacQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, beautifully accompanied by John Ottoman's score, and well acted by the cast. In the central role of von Stauffenberg the American actor Tom Cruise is as effective as usual, and he is surrounded by some of the best British performers working today: Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Jamie Parker. A British character actor named David Bamber plays Hitler as a vague dumpy little man rapidly aging. Some people have objected to so many non-Germans playing German characters, but when the acting is so good why quibble about this type of ""authenticity""? I say Thank God they didn't use Teutonic accents. There is also a flurry of complaints about lapses in historical accuracy, but then ""Valkyrie"" is not pretending to be a stark documentary.

1212332,A1UWGR88UD16Z6,B001KZIRKY,"Edward Rasen Jr. ""ExecEditor""","[8, 16]","Tom Cruise battles his childhood enemy in a valiant attempt to reassert his box-office reputation.Valkryrie was the code-word for the secret plot near the end of World War II organized by German Army officers to assassinate Adolph Hitler, leader of Germany and the Third Reich. The historical drama is based on a true story obviously aimed at males 25 - 54 years old.As we know, Hitler was not assassinated and later committed suicide with his girlfriend Eva Braun in an underground bunker as the American and Russian armies raced into Berlin, capital of the Third Reich.So what is this film? A tragedy? A study of failed ambition? In reality, simply a slick, suspense thriller which casts Tom Cruise as an All-American hero willing to risk his life to save the world from the evil villain.Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the Wermacht (German Army) officer who led the assassination plot. Along with several other German Army officers ---played in the film by British actors--- von Stauffenberg wants to eliminate Hitler and end the war, which Germany is losing. Cruise said during pre-theatrical release that as a child he always wanted ""to kill Hitler.""Director Brian Singer revises history to make Cruise a super-hero. Valkyrie was a meticulously planned operation which almost succeeded. Christopher McQuarrie's and Nathan Alexander's script presents Valkyrie as a seriously-flawed plot with little chance of success unless Cruise can overcome numerous obstacles and singlehandedly save the world.Instead of being a deeply disechanted German engulfed with anguish for German youth being sacrificed by a psychotic meglomaniac, Cruise plays a Hollywood superhero caricature. In spite of his acting experience, Cruise does not portray anguish or disenchantment. All he gives is a stern stare.Moreover, this film suffers from convoluted casting. Von Staffenberg's co-conspirators are played by British actors Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp, who deliver their lines with British accents while Cruise rants in American English. Meanwhile, Thomas Kretschmann, the German actor playing Hitler, delivers his lines in English with a German accent.Obviously, viewers for the sake of entertainment have to forsake reality in favor of fantasy and of course ignore history. The bomb attempt against Hitler during July 20, 1944 did not succeed. Hitler in retribution had all conspirators executed. Those facts seemingly would undermine any reason to a produce a big-budget film sixty-four years after the insignificant event.This film was simply a vehicle for Cruise to re-establish his box-office presence after being publicly dumped from a long-term contract by Paramount Pictures following public rants about Sciencetology and psychology. This was Cruise's first film under the United Artists banner, which he is part-owner. MGM, owner of the United Artists name, distributed the film.Although well-produced, you have to be a Tom Cruise or World War II fan to endure this slick, superficial thriller. But, apparently there are many who adore Cruise or still hunger for another World War II film. Valkyrie grossed $198,107,000 during it's first sixteen weeks of worldwide theatrical release, with foreign markets collectively far outperforming the U.S. box office.Don't buy or rent if you plan on watching with wife or girlfriend, unless you know she is a Tom Cruise fan. Forsake the single disc version and buy or rent the double-disc DVD or Blu Ray editions which have dual commentary tracks. The production-oriented track features director Brian Singer, Tom Cruise and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie while the history-oriented track features McQuarrie and his co-writer Nathan Alexander. Also, included are two informative production oriented featurettes.If you have a high-definition television, the Blu Ray version is far superior to the standard DVD.

1212333,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001KZIRKY,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 5]","The good, detailed info on this film is to be found in the astonishing number of reviews. So, from my gut to yours:1. No one ever attempted a film this good in such compact time, with such gifted actors. It's 'old-school' at its best. I can't believe the man who recently directed ""Superman"" is responsible for this film. Spielberg couldn't have done it as well.2. The locations are unbelievable and beautiful--we forget at certain moments exactly where in history we really are, so taken are we with the beauty of the surroundings. The NAZI luxury of the high-ranking is especially evident, and I was moved by the reconstructions of Hitler's main haunts.I was particularly moved by one of a million excellent details: Singer made sure his colonels and generals were without their military ribbons while in private. This was a genuine custom, due to the bizarre arrangement of the NAZI ""fruit salad""--it was a privileged relief to be able to remove those ribbons, but they must have removed their ribbons as a gesture of disgust. So many WWII films are nothing but an ocean of candy-striped NAZI ribbons as far as the eye can see. Singer discreetly places them most prominently on the chests of the true villains, who never seem to remove them.3. Singer has introduced a new kind of tension and suspense--would have done Hitchcock proud. If anyone can sit calmly through Col. von Stauffenberg's desperate struggle to arm his briefcase bomb, that person sitting through it is likely dead.Singer has given us a heroic (but not comic-book-style) interpretation of amazing events. Even I, a lifelong student of the disgusting Adolph Hitler, had no idea of the extent of the hatred toward him. By fellow NAZIs no less, and that they had a shadow government working both ends against the middle. On the other hand, Singer avoids the fact that they all nearly agreed to call it off near the end.Still, Singer does not shy away from the fact that these men, smart and talented as they were, remained numb-nuts NAZIs at the end of the day. Oh, they actually state they are not NAZIs, but only in the context of the broken promises Hitler provided. The film, without sentimentality and without getting maudlin, shows the ultimate stupidity of such a coup. It didn't quite swing that way in real life, but very, very close. It is this quality Singer has re-defined for cinema with this movie.The actors retaining their natural speaking accents, instead of affecting double-talk German accents, is the most idiotic debate I've ever read. Is this VALKYRIE, likely the the finest WWII film since ""Patton"", or is it ""Hogan's Heroes""? You decide, then tell me how important a German double-talk accent is.Bill Nighy is not to be ignored as General Olbrecht. All his Tourettic twitches and comical facial expressions are used here with power and pathos. It is the first and only time I have ever found myself cheering for a NAZI, and I felt a twinge of pain when his character was executed at the end. It didn't feel the same when Stauffenberg's time came, because he was the big hero, and he took it like a man. Olbrecht did too, but I nearly wept when they shot him. That's the strength of Nighy for you! And I also know they filmed this sad sequence on the actual spot these men were executed.Cruise isn't bad, though I think he was chosen for his startling resemblance to the real von Stauffenberg, more than anything else. A minor weakness in the film is too much camera-lingering on Cruise, instead of getting on with it. Admittedly, Cruise walks through the role, zombie-like. Then we must bow to Kenneth Brannagh as General Treskow, who opened the film with such verve and derring-do.I could not believe the raw, nervous power Eddie Izzard brought to the role of General Feldgiebel. His interactions with Count von Stauffenberg are so effective and intimate it really adds greatly to the film. Izzard is an acting force to be reckoned with, but I doubt he'll ever get another role equal to this one. The look on his face when he sees Hitler has survived von Stauffenberg's bombing of Wolf's Lair is one of cinema's finest close-ups.The great Christian Berkel as Lieutenant Mertz von Quirnheim is stunning and charismatic. I often wonder why they did not choose him to play Count von Stauffenberg. Kudos also to poor Mathias Schweighofer in the thankless little role of Lieutenant Herber, the secretary to General Friederich Fromm (a bland Tom Wilkinson). Schweighofer's star appeared to be rising but I guess he's just big in Europe. Singer picked him because he is notably cute.I will end this with a special nod to David Bamber (""Miss Potter"", ""Pride and Prejudice""), who plays Hitler. Understated and somewhat hidden by Singer until a crucial moment in the film, Bamber is better than Anthony Hopkins' in-depth portrayal of Hitler in ""The Bunker"". No other film in history has approached Hitler so straightforwardly. No other actor, including Hopkins, has rendered such a chilling, convincing performance.Bamber even got Hitler's normal speaking voice spot-on; and one cannot fail to see Bamber's fantastically accurate near-nervous breakdown as Hitler sees his end drawing near. Truly, it is as close a feeling of being in the room with Hitler as one can ever get. The scene at Hitler's private residence, in the ""map room"" with the huge windows, is chilling. It is educational as well. Did this limp, greasy, spooky rag-doll of a goof really lead the nation in such crimes? Bamber actually moves us to ask that question, again and again.(In the 2012 History Channel documentary THE NAZI GOSPELS, which explains the cult Hitler and Himmler created, Bamber plays the role of Himmler, again to chilling effect. He is so excellent that I made an exception in that one case about my general dislike of ""reenactments"". Bamber deserves an Emmy for doing that.)Singer should have expanded this film from just under 2 hours to just under three hours. The characters required more clarification and fleshing-out; an actor played Albert Speer, for example, he's in the credits... he wasn't pointless to the film, yet he is nowhere to be seen in the film. Also, I rest my case about a better explanation of the character's backgrounds.Still, it is this compact and expertly filmed old-school style, rapid-fire action that truly MAKES this film. Singer and company ought to have gotten a whole battalion of little golden soldiers for this.",5,Klick the heels and say Heil Oscar!!,1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,6422,"['good', 'detailed', 'info',

L'hoir,"[5, 6]","I watched the Blu-ray version of this film on my son's gigantic TV, and I must say that I was blown away by the clarity of the images, especially when the cinematographer contrasted the prevailing grey of the uniforms with the blood-red flags (Some of these shots, in a miniature sense, were worthy of Leni Riefenstal).I thought that the scenes set in the teletype pool were especially effective, with row upon row of women reading the copy, and one or more raising her hand tentatively when a message of importance came in for the officer-in-charge to scrutinize. In a movie about a wartime assassination plot, one doesn't ordinarily think about such matters as communication. This added detail contributed to the believability of the film, which hinges thematically on communication and its lack. The suspense derives from a sense of dread, knowing the outcome (Having stood in that ghastly room with the meat-hooks when visiting Berlin, I was really dreading the end, but the director handled the scene discreetly; hence the PG rating.).Other than the always-handsome Tom Cruise, I had no idea who was in the cast since I could not read the elongated printing that is used on the back of DVD covers (and I had not read the reviews on Amazon). About a quarter of the way into the film, however, I exclaimed, ""Good Grief! Is that Kenneth Brannagh?"" (Not being one of his fans, my son had no idea.) Only a certain intonation of voice gave him away, since Brannagh, who looks about 20 pounds heavier than the last time I saw him, usually loses himself in whatever part he plays.By the time the end credits rolled, I was astounded that other roles had been acted by Bill Nighy, Eddie Izzard, Terence Stamp, and Tom Hollander. I have admired each of them in many previous films, but the fact that they immersed themselves into their characters so deeply and seamlessly as to be unrecognizable attests to their ability as actors of the highest quality. i think I appreciated the film all the more because of their total anonymity.",4,Who Knew???,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,2026,"['watched', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'film', 'son', 'gigantic', 'TV', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'clarity', 'images', 'especially', 'when', 'cinematographer', 'contrasted', 'prevailing', 'grey', 'uniforms', 'blood-red', 'flags', 'shots', 'miniature', 'sense', 'were', 'worthy', 'Leni', 'Riefenstal', '.I', 'thought', 'scenes', 'set', 'teletype', 'pool', 'were', 'especially', 'effective', 'row', 'row', 'women', 'reading', 'copy', 'one', 'more', 'raising', 'hand', 'tentatively', 'when', 'message', 'importance', 'came', 'officer-in-charge', 'scrutinize', 'movie', 'wartime', 'assassination', 'plot', 'one', ""n't"", 'ordinarily', 'think', 'such', 'matters', 'communication', 'added', 'detail', 'contributed', 'believability', 'film', 'thematically', 'communication', 'lack', 'suspense', 'derives', 'sense', 'dread', 'knowing', 'outcome', 'Having', 'stood', 'ghastly', 'room', 'meat-hooks', 'when', 'visiting', 'Berlin', 'was', 'really', 'dreading', 'end', 'director', 'handled', 'scene', 'discreetly', 'hence', 'PG', 'rating', '.Other', 'always-handsome', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'could', 'not', 'read', 'elongated', 'printing', 'used', 'back', 'DVD', 'covers', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'quarter', 'way', 'film', 'however', 'exclaimed', 'Good', 'Grief', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'Not', 'being', 'one', 'fans', 'son', 'had', 'idea', 'Only', 'certain', 'intonation', 'voice', 'gave', 'away', 'Brannagh', 'who', '20', 'pounds', 'heavier', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'usually', 'part', 'time', 'end', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'astounded', 'other', 'roles', 'had', 'been', 'acted', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'have', 'admired', 'many', 'previous', 'films', 'fact', 'immersed', 'characters', 'so', 'deeply', 'seamlessly', 'be', 'unrecognizable', 'attests', 'ability', 'actors', 'highest', 'quality', 'i', 'think', 'appreciated', 'film', 'more', 'total', 'anonymity']",Valkyrie

Some have criticized the fact that the actors spoke with American accents while some spoke with British accents, blah blah blah. Who really cares? The question is...did you enjoy the movie? I, for one, did enjoy it very much. Tom Cruise, who is, by the way, a very good actor, did a wonderful job, as did the rest of the cast. There is very little  battle action in the film, but that's ok. War films are not always about the action, Sometimes they are about the humanity and compassion that can arise during all the chaos and madness. This movie has that, and then some. While it may be true that the German officers involved with the plot against Hitler did want to put themselves in a better position for a surrender, they were sickened by Hitler and his henchmen and the nasty things they were doing. These were soldiers whose job is to fight other soldiers, not women, children and old men. This movie portrays them ashuman beings with families and a deep love for their country. Imagine the pain they must have felt as they plotted against the leader of the country, no matter how big a madman he was. So, my advice is to stop analyzing everything and enjoy the movie.

I saw this film on blu-ray recently and thought it to be an intelligent and suspenseful film that was much better than expected.  Based on the true attempt to assasinate Hitler on July 20th 1944, this film goes into great detail on the specifics of the plot.  (I've always thought that it was basically an attempt to kill Hitler.  However there was a much more complicated plot to take over the govenment once the madman was killed, which unfortunately he was not.)  The sad ends to those who participated are shown in detail.  Cruise is quite good and is surrounded by an excellent British cast including Terrence Stamp.  The production values are excellent and it is well directed by Bryan Singer (whose name seems to have become a dirty word in Hollywood since the failure of ""Superman Returns.""  This film only did moderate business as well.)There are numerous special features but the high point is an almost 2 hour documentary on the actual plot, which includes interviews with some of the widows, children and grandchildren of the participants, who were all quickly executed after the plot's failure.  This documentary is excellent and a very nice bonus.  The picture and sound quality on the blu-ray are excellent.If you did not see this film and like a well-made WWII film about an event that actually occured, then I recommend that you see this film.

They talk about saving the world and so on, voicing noble sentiments that make them unequivocally the good guys. I imagine that if Coppola or Scorsese had done this film, it at least would have delved into Staffenberg's Catholic faith, and more about the huge leap it is to stage a coup against your national leader, even if he is Hitler (Staffenberg in years previous had expressed admiration for Hitler, particularly the conquest of France).Without the existential tension, you have execution. Execution is fine and good when you don't know what happens, in say a heist job that we know nothing about about. But we know what happens. The coup fails. Hitler lives.

For most, it was put together by high ranking German army officers who saw the hopelessness of the German cause in WW2 and hoped with Hitler out of the way they could negotiate a more amicable truce with the allies and therein lies the problem.  The film has no real depth or background.  For a 2 hour film I felt like that Christopher Walker character in the film true romance where he said ""What we have here is a game of show and tell, you show me everything but dont tell me anything""We have the officers who are planning the assassination but no real background of what has motivated them to do so.  All we have is that they saw the annihilation of Germany and Europe and wanted the war to end.  All well and good but just how did they intend to do that?  What kind of truce did they hope to negotiate?  With whom did they intend to negotiate with?  The Soviets who has suffered the most under German invasion, the Western Allies who were by 1944 equally in little mood of any kind of amicable truce with Germany and what kind of post truce Europe were they hoping to create?  One that Germany still occupies large parts of Europe or one where they returned to pre war borders?  Did they ally themselves with any of the resistance in occupied Europe and if not why not?  Did they have contact with the allies and what kind of help were they given?  What kind of government did they wish to set up?  A democracy, a military dictatorship?  You would think in a 2 hour film we would be given some background to the coup/assassination attempt but I felt like I was back in school with that tired uninterested history teacher just telling me ""And there was an assassination attempt on Hitler which if it succeeded may have ended the war earlier""Positives are in the film the actual extent of the assassination attempt/coup the fact that this was a very real attempt to overthrow the Hitler regime but as I say, there is very little in the film to give the viewer any insight to it.  I understand that this film gave great concern in Germany where sensitivity in regards to WW2 would possibly be most felt however, my main concerns with this film are what is left out of it rather than its actual contents.  Cruise does a fairly decent job as the main character and though people have argued that an American accent spoils the film I would say its no worse than the generic English accent that usually accompanies war film I mean the film Enemy at the Gates has full English accents throughout the film even though its set in WW2 Stalingrad! To be honest I would rather have Cruise stick to his own accent than try and attempt a German accent.I give this 3 stars as its fairly fast moving and the whole coup plot is quite interesting however I would say it is seriously lacking in content.",3,A bit hit and miss,1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,3009,"['nice', 'effort', 'bringing', 'cinema', 'one', 'most', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'WW2', 'unfortunately', 'bit', 'hit', 'most', 'people', 'generation', 'UK', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Hitler', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'most', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'high', 'ranking', 'German', 'army', 'officers', 'who', 'saw', 'hopelessness', 'German', 'cause', 'WW2', 'hoped', 'Hitler', 'way', 'could', 'negotiate', 'more', 'amicable', 'truce', 'allies', 'therein', 'problem', 'film', 'real', 'depth', 'background', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'felt', 'Christopher', 'Walker', 'character', 'film', 'true', 'romance', 'where', 'said', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'game', 'show', 'tell', 'show', 'everything', 'dont', 'tell', 'anything', 'have', 'officers', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'assassination', 'real', 'background', 'what', 'motivated', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'saw', 'annihilation', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'wanted', 'war', 'end', 'well', 'good', 'just', 'how', 'did', 'intend', 'do', 'What', 'kind', 'truce', 'did', 'hope', 'negotiate', 'whom', 'did', 'intend', 'negotiate', 'Soviets', 'who', 'suffered', 'most', 'German', 'invasion', 'Western', 'Allies', 'who', 'were', '1944', 'equally', 'little', 'mood', 'kind', 'amicable', 'truce', 'Germany', 'what', 'kind', 'post', 'Europe', 'were', 'hoping', 'create', 'One', 'Germany', 'still', 'large', 'parts', 'Europe', 'one', 'where', 'returned', 'pre', 'war', 'borders', 'Did', 'ally', 'resistance', 'occupied', 'Europe', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'Did', 'have', 'contact', 'allies', 'what', 'kind', 'help', 'were', 'given', 'What', 'kind', 'government', 'did', 'wish', 'set', 'up', 'democracy', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'would', 'think', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'background', 'coup/assassination', 'attempt', 'felt', 'was', 'back', 'school', 'tired', 'uninterested', 'history', 'teacher', 'just', 'telling', 'was', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Hitler', 'succeeded', 'may', 'have', 'ended', 'war', 'earlier', 'Positives', 'are', 'film', 'actual', 'extent', 'assassination', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'attempt', 'overthrow', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'say', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'give', 'viewer', 'insight', 'understand', 'film', 'gave', 'great', 'concern', 'Germany', 'where', 'sensitivity', 'regards', 'WW2', 'would', 'possibly', 'be', 'most', 'felt', 'however', 'main', 'concerns', 'film', 'are', 'what', 'left', 'rather', 'actual', 'contents', 'Cruise', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'main', 'character', 'people', 'have', 'argued', 'American', 'accent', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'worse', 'generic', 'English', 'accent', 'usually', 'war', 'film', 'mean', 'film', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'full', 'English', 'accents', 'film', 'even', 'set', 'WW2', 'Stalingrad', 'be', 'honest', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'Cruise', 'stick', 'own', 'accent', 'try', 'attempt', 'German', 'accent.I', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'fairly', 'fast', 'moving', 'whole', 'coup', 'plot', 'quite', 'interesting', 'however', 'would', 'say', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'content']",Valkyrie

The movie ""Valkyrie"" was better than anticipated. Stories about the German resistance are overdue but there is an institutionalised agenda to limit or stop public awareness about them. The most crucial part of the movie is the bomb plot on 20 July 1944 and the political coup. A German officer whom wasn't portrayed in the movie made a grave error and failed to ensure the operation Valkyrie codes had ""highest priority"" status when recieved by the German army. Consequently, the German army continued to recieve instructions from Adolf Hitlers headquarters and this is where the coup detat came unstuck. In the event the Valkyrie codes had ""highest priority"" status the German army would have ignored any further communications from Adolf Hitlers headquarters.The coup of 20 July 1944 is proof there were sophisticated and significant efforts to obtain peace by the Germans. It was a peace the allies didn't want. The German resistance got no help at all from the allies who helped the French resistance and the Dutch resistance just next door. The most successful allied spy ring in Europe the ""Lucy Spy Ring"" under Rudolf Rossler in Switzerland continued to recieve intelligence reports from the German Resistance inside the German High Command (OKW) resulting with the demise at Stalingrad in 1942 and operation Citadel (Kursk) in 1943. In 1944 the German jet industry were producing thousands of Jet fighters and jet bombers by Arado, Messerschmitt and Heinkel. By 1943, the allies were intercepting ALL German radio traffic and allied knowledge of the advanced German military technology sharply became a mind set of allied greed to own the German jet fighters; jet bombers; high speed submarines; radio guided missiles and ballistic missiles.The allies abandoned the German resistance (and peace) to achieve world technological supremacy instead and the German Resistance were ""written out of history."" There was no peace effort by the allies. The allied agenda imposed ultimatums of ""unconditional surrender"" terms that were a pretext to steal German property, scientists and the worlds most advanced military technology by military force through DDAY and the destruction of western Europe where tens of millions of people were killed. The allies broke the German Enigma code in 1942 and shark Enigma in 1943 and were intercepting all German radio traffic. The allied 24 hour bombing of Germany continued, impeding German supply lines, while ground forces slowly advanced into Germany to steal the worlds most advanced military technology and scientists by military force.Ask yourself this question. Why would the allies need to impose ultimatums of ""unconditional surrender"" AT ALL on the Germans and launch ""operation overlord"" or DDAY which destroyed western Europe and killed many millions of people when there was already a very sophisticated network of conspirators ""the German resistance"" within the German High Command (OKW) trying to overthrow Adolf Hitler, close the concentration camps and obtain peace in 1943. The allied priority to conduct repeated bombing raids with Lancaster bomber squadrons dropping ""tall boy"" bombs on the Tirpitz battleship in Norwegian fjords in 1944(a second Bismark battleship make)INSTEAD of dropping them on Adolf Hitler in the wolf's lair in East Prussia shows the true allied intentions. The selfish and self interested allies turned their backs on the German resistance whom were ""written out of history"" along with the ""Lucy Spy Ring"" to conceal the big LIE.

1212351,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001KZIRKY,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","VALKYRIE deserves wider attention than it received during its theatrical release, a theater run mired by the media emphasis on the tacky behind the scenes stories of the making of the film and the character destruction of Tom Cruise.  This is a fascinating bit of World War II German history that is not as well known as the other aspects of the Third Reich and it bears telling.  Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander have used the facts of the 15th unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler as spearheaded by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and molded a thriller and a classy drama populated by some of our finest actors. Director Bryan Singer manages to recreate Germany of 1944 and make it all look real - too real for comfort - and paces this complex mission with steady  and harrowing momentum.The film belongs to Cruise who is rarely off screen. His acting is solid and credible.  The other actors whose presence gives the film a sense of realism are Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Terrance Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Eddie Izzard, Christian Berkel, Tom Hollander, Jamie Parker, Carice van Houten, and David Bamber (excellent in the role of Adolf Hitler).  What makes this cast stand above the average ensemble crew is the sense of selflessness each actor brings to his/her role.  Even though many of these fine actors are only on the screen for moments, their contribution is so well crafted (and directed) that the audience feels as though each is fully understood as members of this infamous historic event.This film appears to be an honest, non-sensationalized view of history about which too few people are informed.  As a quasi-documentary it holds up well: as a thrilling drama it deserves kudos.

1212353,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B001KZIRKY,Graves,"[0, 0]","Valkyrie more or less follows the plot by several high ranking Germans to kill Hitler in 1944. They are motivated by a sure knowledge that Germany is losing the war and the only way the Allies can be approached for a negotiated peace is if Hitler is removed.Enter Tom Cruise as a decorated officer who's literally given his right arm, and one eye, for Germany and so has been given a staff job with access to Hitler. At first he is the latest patsy for the coup led by Terrance Stamp and Kenneth Brannagh, who will be the one to kill Hitler while they seize power but as things unfold, Cruise becomes the driving force behind the plot.The plotting though is not how to end one life, Hitler, but how to arrange to seize power and make sure other powerful Nazi's do not just step into the void. That is operation ""Valkyrie,"" not the assassination of Hitler but the coup to seize control of German after he dies. To do that you need to bring in more collaborators, but the larger the plot, the great the chance someone will betray you. How do you know whom to trust?To look at the film is depressing. Although in color it seems to have a dull grey filter over most of the action. This is fine for setting the mood of the Berlin office blocks but even the East Prussian woods seem grey and after a while it starts to wear you down. The only flashes of color are people's faces, officers gold braid and the bright red of Nazi flags.Since you know Hitler was not assassinated in 1944 you watch the movie knowing these men will fail, but you still care. That is a sign of good direction. The problem is that they can't hold this tension. Once it is clear the coup failed all the umph goes out of the conspiracy and the film. The last few scenes are just played out as inevitable without any tension. The scene for the final executions was filmed on the actual site and the film wasted the opportunity that presented. It look like a set and might as well be. A better ending might have been as the last shots fire, to fade out 1944 and fade in 2008 with the memorial the German people put up to these martyred heroes, reminding the audience just how real these men were.Cruise was the driving force behind the film and got a lot of grief from the German authorities because of his beliefs but they do not come in here. It is a film about Germans in WW2 who dared to challenge the rule of one of the most evil men in history.

The actiing, directing & everything else were excellent. This is the first reteaming of Bryan Singer & Christopher McQuarrie since ""The Uusal Suspects,"" for which McQuarrie won Best Screenplay. The film stars Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Christian Berkel, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izard, Tom Wilkinson, Tom Hollander, Carice Van Houten & David Bamber. Everyone did a wonderful job. Though anyone who studied history knows the outcome of the plot (Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945), the movie keeps you in suspense. I was literally watching the screen, my hands freezing, as Stauffenberg put Operation Valkyrie in motion. I kept thinking, ""If only..."" At one point, I thought, about another character, ""That son of a..."" I nearly cried at the end of the movie. From the very beginning, we're thrust into Stauffenberg's world and the movie never lets up for a single minute. Stay for a few minutes after the final image fades from the screen for a brief epilogue on Hitler, the fate of Stauffenberg's family and a moving tribute to Stauffenberg, Tresckow, Olbricht, Beck, Von Quirnheim, Fellegeibel, Goerdler, Von Helldorf & the others who dared to stand against Hitler's evil regime, even in the face of certain death. ""I am engaged in high treason with all means available to me..."" These men knew the risks to their own lives & the lives of their families, but they were bold & brave enough to sacrifice themselves for what they believed in. They ""Put their principles above personal gain."" While Hitler's evil regime was on the move, Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) and others were covertly plotting to destroy Hitler. ""Well, we have to show the world that not all of us were like him."" These men stood up for what they believed in, though it cost them their lives, but their sacrifice was not in vain. The movie is rated PG-13 for violence & brief strong language, but it should've been PG (the violence and language were very mild).The special features on the 2-Disc DVD aren't that extensive, but well worth it. No deleted scenes (a few scenes in the first trailer, several lines in the three trailers and a scene where Stauffenberg dances with his wife were cut from the movie; I have no idea why) or extensive documentaries on the making of the movie, but a 16 minute featurette which includes a segment with Stauffenberg's grandson (who has a minor role in the movie), a 43 minute documentary on the legacy of the July 20th 1944 plot and two excellent commentaries, one with Tom Cruise, Bryan Singer & Christopher McQuarrie and the other with Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander. The first commentary is very informative AND peppered with anecdotes about what went on during the making of the film; the second one is mostly for people who hope to make a career as a screenwriter and is also entertaining. Both commentaries make references to scenes that were cut from the film and they also explain why the scenes were deleted. (It wouldn't hurt to have included the scenes on the DVD as deleted scenes with optional director, star & screenwriter commentary, though). I highly recommend both commentaries, the featurette and the 43 minute documentary. All of the material is enlightening, entertaining, but most of all, educational. And why does the 2-Disc DVD not include the five extra featurettes available on the Blu-Ray? Those are my only complaints about the DVD.",5,"""Well, We Have To Show The World That Not All Of Us Were Like Him.""

Still under the surface of duty and loyalty was a growing resentment and desire to end a war that every officer knew could only end in a total defeat for Germany.This semi-documentary offers an excellent insight to the sentiments in the Germany army.

I feared that the resultant film was going to be epically bad.  Having Bryan ('X-Men','Superman Returns') Singer at the helm did not predispose me to think that ""Valkyrie"" was going to get respectful, sober, 'adult' treatment, either, even with some British heavy guns in the supporting cast.Having seen the film, once in the theatre and once more on DVD, I have to issue both Mr. Cruise and Mr. Singer apologies, and kudos for defying my expectations so thoroughly.  The last scenes of this film brought me to tears both times, and I do not cry at schlock.  Bravo.  Though I wish with all my heart that the outcome of this brave attempt to stand up to tyranny could have been a positive one, this film treatment is a worthy addition to the von Stauffenberg canon, giving testament to the fact that many brave Germans were willing to defy Hitler to the end, even though it meant making the ultimate sacrifice.Cruise inhabits the skin of Stauffenberg like he was born to it.  Not only does he master the haircut, uniform and demeanor of a high-ranking German military officer, he also must master navigating a tricky plot while embodying Stauffenberg's war injuries.  The Colonel lost a hand, half the other and an eye in Tunisia, where we first see him writing an anti-Hitler screed in his diary that in itself would have been a capital offense.  Cruise opens with a very creditable German voiceover, but wisely shifts to his own voice for the rest of the film.  As do the other actors.  Mr. Cruise is the only American, but this fact fades into the background soon enough, and he displays more than enough gravitas to be a respected leader of men.  The ubiquitous Tom Wilkinson is comfortable in either British or American, and here he opts, interestingly, for an American accent as Stauffenberg's nemesis in the officer corps.  All the supporting actors are fine, but I want to give special mention to the young actor playing Stauffenberg's lieutentant, who emobodies ultimate loyalty to his commanding officer, and to Carice van Houten, for a brief but powerfully touching role as Stauffenberg's wife and mother of his five children.  She died in 2006, which was too soon to have seen this film, but I can't help thinking she would be pleased.  In the hands of Cruise and Singer, her husband is unquestioningly, a hero of the people.

They were tweaked, probably in order to ennoble the plotters more (and by extension, in my view, if not to re-write history, but to give a more positive twists to the German resistance during WW2).For example, General Beck (brilliantly, in my view, played by Terence Stamp) is portrayed as personally asking to commit suicide. In reality, he was ordered to shoot himself by General Fromm, but succeeded only in wounding himself, and a sergeant was brought in to administer the coup de grce by shooting Beck in the back of the neck. The film omitted that.This and other tweaked details reveal more telling and dubious undercurrent - it is desire by some to present the officers corp as (failed) saviors of Germany - it should be rejected out of hands. In reality, the Wehrmaht's generals, while not rabid Nazis en masse, nevertheless had showed themselves unusually subservient to Hitler. Even the Soviet generals during the War slammed and opposed Stalin's orders more, if they deemed the orders impractical or stupid.

Crabtree ""Doc Crabtree""","[3, 3]","An excellent movie, Valkyrie avoids discussion of the previous officer plots to assassinate or depose Hitler, some of which go back to 1938. An underground resistance, made up of former government officials and serving military officers, eventually formed to oppose Hitler. The reasons for resistance varied: some disagreed with the Nazi's racial policies, others felt that Catholicism was under attack, yet others simply wanted Hitler gone because they felt he was incompetent in prosecuting the war. Valkyrie doesn't really go into this and it's too bad because it would have added a human element to the story.As far as the mechanics of the plot itself the movie is excellent and seems to accurately portray the various elements involved. I liked the discussion of the plan and the clips which showed how the plot was SUPPOSED to work and then as the movie progressed how the plot ACTUALLY  progressed. The movie followed the historical facts closely, including the first, aborted attempt on Hitler's life made by Stauffenberg.The acting in this film was excellent. Tom Cruise got it exactly right I think.

Some of them were thinking of ways of persuading Hitler to end it or, failing that, to assassinate him, take control, and try for a negotiated settlement with the Allies.Stauffenberg sent out feelers to other German officials, and found some potential supporters. The plot was hatched. The attempt was to be made at a meeting located in Wolf's Lair, in East Prussia. Unfortunately, owing to the hot weather, the meeting had been moved from the concrete bunker to a wooden hut, greatly reducing the effects of the explosion. Also, for some reason, only one of the blocks of plastic explosive was used instead of the two that were available.In the meeting, Stauffenberg got next to Hitler, planted the bomb, and left. Stauffenberg saw the explosion with his own eyes. Surely Hitler was dead. Stauffenberg got past the checkpoints, and flew to Berlin to start the revolt. Confusion reigned. German officials did not know whose side to take. Contradictory arrest orders were given. Who to believe and obey?Then all the phone lines to Stauffenberg's office were cut. Stauffenberg was arrested after a shootout. Hitler came on the radio and announced that he was very much alive. The plotters' fate was sealed.Although this movie has much drama and entertainment value, some parts have questionable accuracy. Did Stauffenberg, while participating in the North African campaign, actually take the risk of putting his misgivings about Hitler in writing? The movie doesn't point out that most of the conspirators remained Nazis. Considering all the atrocities committed by the Wehrmacht, were the Wehrmacht officers actually disgusted by the atrocities of the SS? Was Goebbels actually prepared to commit suicide had the plotters succeeded? And so on...Still, this is a very good film. It even has a poignant scene: Two of Stauffenberg's young sons playing with swords while Wagner's VALKYRIE is playing on the then-primitive record player. Also, Stauffenberg's daughter dons his officers' hat.",5,Captures the Drama of the Attempt on Hitler.

1212382,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B001KZIRKY,Jiang Xueqin,"[0, 2]","In Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie,"" Tom Cruise plays the anti-Hitler conspirator Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, and in the process Cruise trades his infectious smile for a glass eyeball.  In ""Superman Returns,"" Bryan Singer tries to make human and knowable an invincible man who chooses to fly around the sky in his underwear, and in ""Valkyrie"" Singer must deal with another impossible superhero:  Tom Cruise.The script is terrible and seems hastily written.  The script comes across as very amateurish when compared with ""The Good Shepherd,"" a very good spy film script that is suspenseful and tightly woven, and deftly incorporates the metapors and symbols of espionage and conspiracy.  By comparison ""Valkyrie"" lacks depth and credibility.  I was ready to stop watching the movie after one ridiculous scene where Cruise and one of his co-conspirators confronts Colonel General Frederich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) to seek his implicit approval for the coup d'etat against the Nazis.  In what should have been an acutely subtle scene where motivations and allegiances are revealed in the inflection of the voice or a glance of the eye the three are much too blatant and direct with each other.Indeed, the film feels a lot like ""Jerry Maguire,"" and not enough like ""The Good Shepherd.""  At the film's climax Tom Cruise is working the phones, in a scene that could have come right out of ""Jerry Maguire.""  There's too much heroism and bravuda, and not enough ulterior motives and duplicity that make a conspiracy a conspiracy.  The conspirators were all too easy to fall in line behind the noble but rash von Stauffenberg, and in Hitler Germany where everybody swore allegiance to the Fuhrer it's hard to imagine that the conspiracy could have assembled dozens of plotters without there being leaks and double crosses.  Everyone had a role to play and played it to the letter, and there was no room for doubt and compromise and shifting allegiances.  (War brings out the worst and the best in people, as the films ""The Counterfeiters"" and ""King Rat"" competently demonstrate.)  But the worst crime committed here is simple and damning:  this film is very boring for a very good hour before the coup d'etat fully unfolds.Bryan Singer was very impressive in ""The Usual Suspects,"" but he has not made a decent film since.  ""Superman Returns"" was a pretentious and pointless film that went nowhere, and in ""Valkyrie"" Singer has managed the same feat twice.",3,Very Boring in the Beginning,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,2441,"['Bryan', 'Singer', 'Valkyrie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'anti-Hitler', 'conspirator', 'Colonel', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'process', 'Cruise', 'infectious', 'smile', 'glass', 'eyeball', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'make', 'human', 'knowable', 'invincible', 'man', 'who', 'fly', 'sky', 'underwear', 'Valkyrie', 'Singer', 'must', 'deal', 'impossible', 'superhero', 'Tom', 'Cruise.The', 'script', 'terrible', 'hastily', 'written', 'script', 'very', 'amateurish', 'when', 'compared', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'very', 'good', 'spy', 'film', 'script', 'suspenseful', 'tightly', 'woven', 'deftly', 'metapors', 'symbols', 'espionage', 'conspiracy', 'comparison', 'Valkyrie', 'depth', 'credibility', 'was', 'ready', 'stop', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'where', 'Cruise', 'one', 'co-conspirators', 'confronts', 'Colonel', 'General', 'Frederich', 'Fromm', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'seek', 'implicit', 'approval', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'Nazis', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'acutely', 'subtle', 'scene', 'where', 'motivations', 'allegiances', 'are', 'revealed', 'inflection', 'voice', 'glance', 'eye', 'three', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'blatant', 'direct', 'other.Indeed', 'film', 'lot', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'not', 'enough', 'Good', 'Shepherd', 'film', 'climax', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'working', 'phones', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'right', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'too', 'much', 'heroism', 'bravuda', 'not', 'enough', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'duplicity', 'make', 'conspiracy', 'conspiracy', 'conspirators', 'were', 'too', 'easy', 'fall', 'line', 'noble', 'rash', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'where', 'everybody', 'swore', 'allegiance', 'Fuhrer', 'hard', 'imagine', 'conspiracy', 'could', 'have', 'assembled', 'dozens', 'plotters', 'being', 'leaks', 'double', 'crosses', 'Everyone', 'had', 'role', 'play', 'played', 'letter', 'was', 'room', 'doubt', 'compromise', 'shifting', 'allegiances', 'War', 'out', 'worst', 'best', 'people', 'films', 'Counterfeiters', 'King', 'Rat', 'competently', 'demonstrate', 'worst', 'crime', 'committed', 'here', 'simple', 'damning', 'film', 'very', 'boring', 'very', 'good', 'hour', 'coup', 'fully', 'unfolds.Bryan', 'Singer', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'not', 'made', 'decent', 'film', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'pretentious', 'pointless', 'film', 'went', 'nowhere', 'Valkyrie', 'Singer', 'managed', 'same', 'feat', 'twice']",Valkyrie

And Cruise's portrayal of Von Stauffenberg is definitely compelling.  It's more engaging than 90% of the Hollywood fictional trash out there, because YOU KNOW that the conspirators are standing up to a huge, dark, powerful Beast (Hitler's Killing Machine), and that they are going to fail & die in the end.BUT they nearly did it!  A recent scientific examination said that Hitler would have died if (1) the briefcase bomb wasn't moved accidentally, (2) two charges were used, as planned, not just one, or (3) the meeting was in the bunker, not the conference house.  So Von Stauffenberg and co-conspirators came VERY, VERY CLOSE to killing Hitler.  One might wonder if God was ""looking"" down at the time, why didn't he just ""tweak"" the physics 0.01% to cause Hitler to die?  This would have saved literally millions of lives that perished in the last year of the European theater of WWII.  It's the Butterfly effect -- a small error, a slightly small charge in the bomb, a wiff of air, caused Hitler to survive, and in surviving, a massive change in history resulted.  It has lots of philosophical implications.Many PC-types might not like this movie because they want to think of the entire German population in WWII as evil..... well, they're wrong.  It's heart-wrenching and compelling to think that courageous men like Von Stauffenberg willingly gave their lives to try to kill Hitler and put into place the Valkyrie plan, in order to try to save their country from the Nazi barbarians.  The plan was BRILLIANT, and would have worked!  They had planned to blame the SS and seize control of Berlin with the Reserve troops -- it was all working except for the little unfortunate fact that HITLER DIDN'T DIE.Oh, yes, the movie.  Lots of tense scenes.  Particularly when he's getting Hitler himself to sign the amended copy of Valkyrie, and of course leading up to the bomb blast.  Lots of steely resolve and appropriate acting by Cruise.  Excellent supporting acting ensemble (like Kenneth Branagh, Terrance Stamp, Thomas Kretschman).  Some very memorable scenes ... Kretschman's character picking up the phone while Goebbels waits, ready to kill himself, only to see Kretschman stiffen and freak out when he hears the supposedly dead Hitler on the phone.  Another: Cruise being forced to give the Nazi salute, and then doing so, saying ""Heil Hitler"" while saluting with his right arm (which is missing a hand from war wounds!!) -- Shocking, compelling, touching.I highly recommend this movie (realize that 4 stars is a good score for me).",4,Truth is more Compelling than Fiction!,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,2633,"['What', 'movie', 'so', 'exciting', 'tense', 'moving', 'based', 'true', 'history', 'Cruise', 'portrayal', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'definitely', 'compelling', 'more', 'engaging', '90', '%', 'Hollywood', 'fictional', 'trash', 'there', 'YOU', 'KNOW', 'conspirators', 'are', 'standing', 'up', 'huge', 'dark', 'powerful', 'Beast', 'Hitler', 'Killing', 'Machine', 'are', 'going', 'fail', 'die', 'end.BUT', 'nearly', 'did', 'recent', 'scientific', 'examination', 'said', 'Hitler', 'would', 'have', 'died', '1', 'briefcase', 'bomb', 'was', ""n't"", 'moved', 'accidentally', '2', 'two', 'charges', 'were', 'used', 'planned', 'not', 'just', 'one', '3', 'meeting', 'was', 'bunker', 'not', 'conference', 'house', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'co-conspirators', 'came', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'CLOSE', 'killing', 'Hitler', 'One', 'might', 'wonder', 'God', 'was', 'looking', 'down', 'time', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'tweak', 'physics', '0.01', '%', 'cause', 'Hitler', 'die', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'literally', 'millions', 'lives', 'perished', 'last', 'year', 'European', 'theater', 'WWII', 'Butterfly', 'effect', 'small', 'error', 'slightly', 'small', 'charge', 'bomb', 'wiff', 'air', 'caused', 'Hitler', 'survive', 'surviving', 'massive', 'change', 'history', 'resulted', 'lots', 'philosophical', 'implications.Many', 'PC-types', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'want', 'think', 'entire', 'German', 'population', 'WWII', 'evil', '..', 'well', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'heart-wrenching', 'compelling', 'think', 'courageous', 'men', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'willingly', 'gave', 'lives', 'try', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'put', 'place', 'Valkyrie', 'plan', 'order', 'try', 'save', 'country', 'Nazi', 'barbarians', 'plan', 'was', 'BRILLIANT', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'had', 'planned', 'blame', 'SS', 'seize', 'control', 'Berlin', 'Reserve', 'troops', 'was', 'working', 'little', 'unfortunate', 'fact', 'HITLER', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'DIE.Oh', 'yes', 'movie', 'Lots', 'tense', 'scenes', 'Particularly', 'when', 'getting', 'Hitler', 'sign', 'amended', 'copy', 'Valkyrie', 'course', 'leading', 'up', 'bomb', 'blast', 'Lots', 'steely', 'resolve', 'appropriate', 'acting', 'Cruise', 'Excellent', 'supporting', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Terrance', 'Stamp', 'Thomas', 'Kretschman', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Kretschman', 'character', 'picking', 'up', 'phone', 'Goebbels', 'waits', 'ready', 'kill', 'only', 'see', 'Kretschman', 'stiffen', 'freak', 'out', 'when', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'Hitler', 'phone', 'Cruise', 'being', 'forced', 'give', 'Nazi', 'salute', 'then', 'doing', 'so', 'saying', 'Heil', 'Hitler', 'saluting', 'right', 'arm', 'missing', 'hand', 'war', 'wounds', 'Shocking', 'compelling', 'touching.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'realize', '4', 'stars', 'good', 'score']",Valkyrie

1212399,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001KZIRKY,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 3]","Over the course of Hitler's devastating reign of terror as the leader of Nazi Germany he commanded what appeared to be unwavering loyalty from all under his command. However, during his tyrannical tenure there were a total of seventeen assassination attempts made on Hitler's life. This fact proved that not everyone within his grasp was onboard with the Fuhrer's genocidal plans, and that some were even willing to risk their very lives to put an end to his evil. Out of the seventeen attempts, the final attempt codenamed Operation Walk&uuml;re, remains one of the most infamous. This is true, not only for how the operation was carried out, but also for just how far reaching the disillusionment with the Nazi party and the atrocities they committed had become amongst some of the military and civilians within the country.""Valkyrie"" is based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), who led a group of high-ranking officials within Nazi Germany in an incredible assassination attempt on the life of Adolf Hitler. For them to succeed would mean Germany could begin to remove the stain of Hitler's reign, but to fail would mean that all involved would become traitors to their country and death would inevitably follow.For ""Valkyrie"" to actually succeed in creating the undeniably palpable sense of tension surrounding the events on screen is truly surprising to me. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") has crafted a fast-paced, albeit streamlined account, of the events leading up to and following the failed assassination attempt on Hitler during World War II. To achieve this, the screenplay focused upon the bigger moments within the assassination plot to give audiences a general understanding of what will happen should they win the day, while also repeatedly mentioning the possible repercussions that would occur should the coup d'&eacute;tat fail. Those two story elements, along with Singer's quick-cuts in the film's editing process, allowed the story to become much more exhilarating and suspenseful than what should have been possible.The screenplay's tightly paced, streamlined narrative definitely allowed the movie to become much more of a thriller rather than an historical drama, which was precisely how director Bryan Singer (""Superman Returns"") had envisioned the film. However, in taking this route the film ultimately suffers from being too simplistic and truncated. The plot of Operation Walk&uuml;re was an intricately conceived plan that was not implemented on a whim, and it required finesse, precision, dedication, and not to mention a good amount of luck. While the film does touch on the fact that the conspirators did not take their decision lightly, it did appear that the operation was not all that hard to devise or execute. Now, I understand that certain elements of the plot and events surrounding it had to be omitted or condensed in order for the film to fit into a two hour running time; yet, in doing so, this approach made the coup seem far too easy to accomplish.Another problem was that in some ways the story unfolded in an uneven manner. On the one hand the conspirators obviously feared the potential severity of the consequences should they fail, but at the same time the abridged approach to conveying the plot and its drawbacks made the consequences unrealistically appear as less threatening and not nearly as much of a hindrance to signing up for the cause as one might have thought. Even though Bryan Singer wanted to create a thriller surrounding this moment in history, I personally feel that he would have had far greater success with the end result had he opted for a more detailed account as one would find in a typical historical drama. In doing this, the movie could have taken much more time in laying out the various details of the operation, and also shedding even more light on the conspirators involved; therefore providing audiences with a much more fulfilling experience.Leading the cast in this average and uneven historical thriller is the one-time Hollywood powerhouse, Tom Cruise (""Collateral""). Over the years, I have seen many of Tom Cruise's films, and enjoyed a good majority of them along the way. However, within those plethora of films lies a myriad of performances, ranging from superb (""Collateral"") to good (""Mission: Impossible 2"") to simply phoning it in (as was the case with this film). What went wrong with Tom Cruise's performance in this movie was his extremely flat, unenthused delivery, a general lack of charisma or captivating presence (the real Stauffenberg was known as a very charismatic man), and an obviously lacking German-esque accent.In regards to the issue of the accent or lack thereof, I understand that many of the other members of the cast didn't adopt German accents for their roles either. However, I know from some of their previous performances, and just their overall talents as actors, that most of them could have adopted a passable accent, if given the opportunity. Yet for this film, director Bryan Singer apparently informed the non-German actors that they were not required to convey an accent because he wasn't concerned with making an historical drama/documentary, but merely an entertaining thriller. To me this sounds more like an excuse used to cover Cruise's shortcomings as an actor than anything else, and an obvious ploy on Singer's part to try to protect his lead actor from becoming embarrassment.In my opinion, while Cruise did an adequate job in some scenes, his lack of commitment and/or skill in other scenes opposite the much more capable members of the cast made it abundantly clear that Cruise was way out of his league in this film. Thus, leading me, and many other viewers, to believe that any of the other cast members could have done a much more authentic and accurate job of portraying this historical figure, and that the movie would have benefited from this type of change in the end.Alongside Tom Cruise was an extremely talented assemblage of actors whose performances while good, never veered towards the great or even exceptional side of the spectrum. This was no doubt a by-product of their performances being much more reserved so as to not outshine their lead actor too much in his attempted ""comeback"" movie. Among this group of men featuring the likes of Tom Wilkinson (""Batman Begins""), Bill Nighy (""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"") and Terrence Stamp (""Yes Man""), I found myself disappointed by how average all of their performances tended to be. Again, none of the supporting performances were bad; I just expected more from actors of their caliber. So the movie just felt extremely wanting in this area.Two other members of the supporting cast worth noting, although their lack of screen time makes them seem more like cameos, Kenneth Branagh (""Wild Wild West"") and comedian Eddie Izzard (TV's ""The Riches"") seemed to show the most promising performances. Yet their lack of time on camera made their historical figures' inclusion into the story seem like afterthoughts. It felt as if the writer thought that their characters, based on the few scenes they appeared in the movie, were somewhat important to the plot (to what extent I don't know); however, in the end it didn't seem like they were worth mentioning all that much to him. This is surprising since Eddie Izzard's character's position at the Wolf's Lair seemed very important to the conspirators' cause. I guess these two actors' lacking story arcs were just another example of how the trimmed down storyline caused the movie to fall way short of its potential.""Valkyrie"" could have been, and arguably should have been, another great World War II era movie that focused on an important event in history, that if successful could have changed everything from that moment on. Yet questionable decisions on the part of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie, regarding making this a faster-paced thriller rather than an historical drama, resulted in a merely average film that will never be as memorable as some of the other entries surrounding this war. Not to mention a weak performance from Tom Cruise, and universally average portrayals from the remainder of the cast, in the end ""Valkyrie"" will go down as being unmemorable for a movie of its genre.""Valkyrie"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",3,Tom Cruise Holds Back This Revolution...,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,8380,"['course', 'Hitler', 'devastating', 'reign', 'terror',

Valkyrie succeeds in this magnificently.Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise as Claus Von Stauffenberg, a Colonel in the German Army, but he has a strict code of morals that's different than Hitler's Germany. Stauffenberg was worried about the German people and a regime that was killing 16,000 daily. After suffering horrific wounds in North Africa Stuaffenberg is assigned to be an adjutant of Hitler's. Upon arriving in Berlin he is recruited into a secret group of like minded high ranking German officers who want to remove Hitler from power and put him on trial. Stauffenberg develops Operation Valkyrie, a plan to assassinate Adolph Hitler, it was a brilliant plan, take over the  army reserve, the  National Guard would be our equivalent, and lead them to think that after they assassinate Hitler, a radical faction of the SS was trying to seize power, and that Stauffenberg would appear to be supporting Hitler's government until it was too late and they had control of the government. Stauffenberg plants a bomb in the room where Hitler is having a staff meeting, he is able to get out of the meeting just before the bomb goes off, and he witnesses the room being blown to bits but he isn't sure if Hitler is dead. He makes it back to Berlin to put Operation Valkyrie into effect, and discovers his co-conspirators haven't done very much to put the plan into effect because General Olbricht (Bill Nighy) has lost his nerve due to almost being caught in a previous attempt. As Valkyrie is put into action they secure SS and Gestapo barracks not only in Berlin but Paris and Prague. Word starts to get out that Hitler wasn't killed but the conspirators keep going because they've gone to far to stop and because if they can secure Berlin they can isolate Hitler and his cronies and remove them from power. The plan almost succeeds until dual orders come to arrest Goebels and Stauffenberg and which orders the German soldiers choose to obey and why.Every few movies Cruise proves he's an actor by turning in a good performance, and the whole cast turn in performances that fill in the blanks of dry history and give breath to the characters and dramas that make up history.While there isn't a whole lot of range in Cruise's Stauffenberg, this isn't a wooden performance Stauffenberg is first and foremost a soldier and his demeanor reflects that. The whole cast turns in good performances from Kenneth Branagh, although I was disappointed he wasn't used more, Terence Stamp as General Beck who the conspirators are looking to make the new leader of Germany, Tom Wikinson as General Fromm who was aware of the conspiracy but neither encouraged it nor turned the conspirators in, and Bill Nighy as the indecisive General Olbricht.As I Watched this movie I had some interesting reactions to what was going on. On the one hand Stauffenberg and the other conspirators are trying to do the right thing for their country and humanity, but they're also committing treason.",4,"Historical Drama, That Succeeds Both as History & Drama",1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,3279,"['Movies', 'history', 'are', 'risky', 'business', 'viewer', 'already', 'outcome', 'trick', 'make', 'compelling', 'riveting', 'drama', 'viewer', 'forget', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'get', 'sit', 'edge', 'seats', 'events', 'unravel', 'reveal', 'history', 'eyes', 'Valkyrie', 'magnificently.Valkyrie', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Claus', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'Colonel', 'German', 'Army', 'strict', 'code', 'morals', 'different', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'Stauffenberg', 'was', 'worried', 'German', 'people', 'regime', 'was', 'killing', '16,000', 'daily', 'suffering', 'horrific', 'wounds', 'North', 'Africa', 'Stuaffenberg', 'assigned', 'be', 'adjutant', 'Hitler', 'arriving', 'Berlin', 'recruited', 'secret', 'group', 'minded', 'high', 'ranking', 'German', 'officers', 'who', 'want', 'remove', 'Hitler', 'power', 'put', 'trial', 'Stauffenberg', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'plan', 'assassinate', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'was', 'brilliant', 'plan', 'take', 'army', 'reserve', 'National', 'Guard', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'lead', 'think', 'assassinate', 'Hitler', 'radical', 'faction', 'SS', 'was', 'trying', 'seize', 'power', 'Stauffenberg', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'supporting', 'Hitler', 'government', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'had', 'control', 'government', 'Stauffenberg', 'plants', 'bomb', 'room', 'where', 'Hitler', 'having', 'staff', 'meeting', 'able', 'get', 'meeting', 'just', 'bomb', 'off', 'room', 'being', 'blown', 'bits', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Hitler', 'dead', 'back', 'Berlin', 'put', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'effect', 'co-conspirators', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'very', 'much', 'put', 'plan', 'effect', 'General', 'Olbricht', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'lost', 'nerve', 'due', 'almost', 'being', 'caught', 'previous', 'attempt', 'Valkyrie', 'put', 'action', 'secure', 'SS', 'Gestapo', 'not', 'only', 'Berlin', 'Paris', 'Prague', 'Word', 'get', 'out', 'Hitler', 'was', ""n't"", 'killed', 'conspirators', 'keep', 'going', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'far', 'stop', 'can', 'secure', 'Berlin', 'can', 'isolate', 'Hitler', 'cronies', 'remove', 'power', 'plan', 'almost', 'dual', 'orders', 'come', 'arrest', 'Goebels', 'Stauffenberg', 'orders', 'German', 'soldiers', 'choose', 'obey', 'why.Every', 'few', 'movies', 'Cruise', 'actor', 'turning', 'good', 'performance', 'whole', 'cast', 'turn', 'performances', 'fill', 'blanks', 'dry', 'history', 'give', 'breath', 'characters', 'dramas', 'make', 'up', 'history.While', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'range', 'Cruise', 'Stauffenberg', ""n't"", 'wooden', 'performance', 'Stauffenberg', 'first', 'foremost', 'soldier', 'demeanor', 'whole', 'cast', 'turns', 'good', 'performances', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'more', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'General', 'Beck', 'who', 'conspirators', 'are', 'looking', 'make', 'new', 'leader', 'Germany', 'Tom', 'Wikinson', 'General', 'Fromm', 'who', 'was', 'aware', 'conspiracy', 'encouraged', 'turned', 'conspirators', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'indecisive', 'General', 'Olbricht.As', 'Watched', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'reactions', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'one', 'hand', 'Stauffenberg', 'other', 'conspirators', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'country', 'humanity', ""'re"", 'also', 'committing', 'treason']",Valkyrie

This movie told that story superbly, and the actors in this film were just as superb.  I remember learning about this incident some years ago when I read the excellent series of books authored by Winston Churchill detailing the strategies and battles of WWII.  Alhough I'm far from expert on the subject I believe that this movie coincided well with my recollection of what I read about it then, and since.  Some critics of this film seem bothered by the fact that the actors didn't use German accents in this movie, finding the American and British accented dialogue to be somewhat jarring and unrealistic.  They should remember that the people depicted here did not speak English, nor English with a German accent.  They spoke German, as indicated in the film's opening, when Tom Cruise as Col. Stauffenberg began by speaking German with English subtitles, and then thankfully switched to English, as if it were being translated.  I believe the film makers assumed that the audience would be smart enough to know what was meant by the transition from German to English.  I personally was not bothered by the American-accented English spoken by Tom Cruise, or the slight British accent of many of the other actors.  Even though I knew from my familiarity of this event how it would turn out, I found the movie riveting to the very end, and the special effects spectacular.

It probably would have been a lot better if it had been made thirty years ago, when people still remembered World War II. It definitely would have been a lot better if an old school actor of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting played the lead. Without an Alpha Male in the lead, VALKYRIE just flounders.Although Tom Cruise has some good work on his resume, like A FEW GOOD MEN and THE LAST SAMURAI, he just isn't the man to play Colonel Stauffenberg, the ringleader of the July 20, 1944 plot to kill Adolf Hitler. Cruise is boyish. He lacks character lines on his face. He isn't hard enough to be the killer of a mass killer.VALKYRIE's biggest weakness, though, isn't Cruise, it's a go-nowhere script that lacks any suspense at all. History tells us the plotters failed, so the end is a foregone conclusion. Getting to the end is the dynamic part of this story. VALKYRIE just isn't dynamic. Its sonorous low energy all-talk no-action scenes between conspirators and its overall shuffling pace are enough to make you doze.Although the film tries to portray Stauffenberg and his cohorts as heroes, it's important to remember that these men did nothing to free Germany for the length of the war until after D-Day when it became transparently clear that the war would be lost.

This is how the story goes: In a country in the grips of evil, in a police state where every move is being watched, in a world where justice and honor have been subverted, a group of men hidden inside the highest reaches of power decide to take action. Based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and the daring and ingenious plot to eliminate one of the most evil tyrants the world has ever known.A proud military man, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is a loyal officer who serves his country all the while hoping that someone will find a way to stop Hitler before Europe and Germany are destroyed. Realizing that time is running out, he decides that he must take action himself and joins the German resistance. Armed with a cunning strategy to use Hitler's own emergency plan - known as Operation Valkyrie - these men plot to assassinate the dictator and overthrow his Nazi government from the inside.With everything in place, with the future of the world, the fate of millions and the lives of his wife and children hanging in the balance, von Stauffenberg is thrust from being one of many who oppose Hitler to the one who must kill Hitler himself.The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg) is excellent!

1212414,A10610LHTIBAVR,B001KZIRKY,"Kurt Carmichael ""Kurt""","[5, 9]","Many other reviewers are singing the praises of this quasi-historically-accurate thriller.  Although the plot is insightful and hits the key elements of this assassination attempt on Hitler, it misses the underlying historical point.  The Wehrmacht leadership was divided into two organizational components by this point in the war.  Not surprisingly, it was Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany, who made this organizational ""adjustment"" early in the war due to his distrust of the existing mechanisms of promotion and the questionable loyalty of the pre-1939 German Army leadership.  He installed his puppet officers, those he could control, in the OKW or the OberKommand der Wehrmacht, in violation of the long-standing tradition of the Army to be independent of political control.  This destruction of longstanding (since 1807) German Army organizational principles caused a great reaction among the 'purists' within the junior and senior officer corps, culminating in this final attempt to kill Hitler and, all of his cronies in the OKW.  Notably, most of the conspirators were these same Army purists who put devotion to the Army and pre-1939 Germany above personal considerations and Hitler's blandishments.  Only by assassination could the Army rid itself of both the menace of Hitler, whose strategic direction had failed, and the OKW patsies.  The goal was to save Germany through negotiated surrender with the Allies, with the Army representing the people of Germany.  That this attempt failed meant that Germany soon became partitioned by the Allies and that the German people were subjected to even further atrocities under the various English, French, US and Russian occupation 'governments'.A subtext of the movie relates to the activation of ""Code Valkyrie"".  Valkyrie was a German Army plan, signed by Hitler, intended to protect the upper level Nazi leadership (such as Hitler, Goebbels & Goering) against existing internal threats or counter-coups, now that the war itself was lost.  It made use of the Army Reserve to protect key infrastructure and leadership, while operating to arrest or decapitate rival claimants to the dictatorship.  What seems to be missed in the movie is Hitler's obsession (not with Goebbels) but with Himmler, the leader of the SS.  It was Himmler that Code Valkyrie was directed against, because Himmler was the most likely candidate to assume power and authority given the far-reaching tentacles of the SS and the natural antipathy that arose between Hitler and Himmler, the men holding the most raw state power.  Historians have not yet unraveled the linkage between Stauffenberg's preemptive activation of the Valkyrie plan and the dire threat that Himmler & the SS posed to Hitler's form of governing in the closing days of WW II.  In fact, almost to confirm this fact and Hitler's obsession, it was Himmler that eventually proclaimed himself dictator after Hitler was confined within his Berlin bunker, whereupon Hitler placed him under sentence of death for overreach of authority.",2,"Wehrmacht vs. OKW vs. SS, the culmination of struggle and antagonism in WWII Germany",1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,3034,"['Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'singing', 'praises', 'quasi-historically-accurate', 'thriller', 'plot', 'insightful', 'key', 'elements', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Hitler', 'underlying', 'historical', 'point', 'Wehrmacht', 'leadership', 'was', 'divided', 'two', 'organizational', 'components', 'point', 'war', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'Hitler', 'dictator', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'who', 'made', 'organizational', 'adjustment', 'early', 'war', 'due', 'distrust', 'existing', 'mechanisms', 'promotion', 'questionable', 'loyalty', 'pre-1939', 'German', 'Army', 'leadership', 'installed', 'puppet', 'officers', 'could', 'control', 'OKW', 'OberKommand', 'der', 'Wehrmacht', 'violation', 'long-standing', 'tradition', 'Army', 'be', 'independent', 'political', 'control', 'destruction', 'longstanding', '1807', 'German', 'Army', 'organizational', 'principles', 'caused', 'great', 'reaction', ""'purists"", 'junior', 'senior', 'officer', 'corps', 'culminating', 'final', 'attempt', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'cronies', 'OKW', 'Notably', 'most', 'conspirators', 'were', 'same', 'Army', 'purists', 'who', 'put', 'devotion', 'Army', 'pre-1939', 'Germany', 'personal', 'considerations', 'Hitler', 'blandishments', 'Only', 'assassination', 'could', 'Army', 'rid', 'menace', 'Hitler', 'strategic', 'direction', 'had', 'failed', 'OKW', 'patsies', 'goal', 'was', 'save', 'Germany', 'negotiated', 'surrender', 'Allies', 'Army', 'representing', 'people', 'Germany', 'attempt', 'failed', 'meant', 'Germany', 'soon', 'became', 'partitioned', 'Allies', 'German', 'people', 'were', 'subjected', 'even', 'further', 'atrocities', 'various', 'English', 'French', 'US', 'Russian', 'occupation', 'subtext', 'movie', 'activation', 'Code', 'Valkyrie', 'Valkyrie', 'was', 'German', 'Army', 'plan', 'signed', 'Hitler', 'intended', 'protect', 'upper', 'level', 'Nazi', 'leadership', 'such', 'Hitler', 'Goebbels', 'Goering', 'existing', 'internal', 'threats', 'counter-coups', 'now', 'war', 'was', 'lost', 'made', 'use', 'Army', 'Reserve', 'protect', 'key', 'infrastructure', 'leadership', 'operating', 'arrest', 'decapitate', 'rival', 'claimants', 'dictatorship', 'What', 'be', 'missed', 'movie', 'Hitler', 'obsession', 'not', 'Goebbels', 'Himmler', 'leader', 'SS', 'was', 'Himmler', 'Code', 'Valkyrie', 'was', 'directed', 'Himmler', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'candidate', 'assume', 'power', 'authority', 'given', 'far-reaching', 'tentacles', 'SS', 'natural', 'antipathy', 'arose', 'Hitler', 'Himmler', 'men', 'holding', 'most', 'raw', 'state', 'power', 'Historians', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'unraveled', 'linkage', 'Stauffenberg', 'preemptive', 'activation', 'Valkyrie', 'plan', 'dire', 'threat', 'Himmler', 'SS', 'posed', 'Hitler', 'form', 'governing', 'closing', 'days', 'WW', 'II', 'fact', 'almost', 'confirm', 'fact', 'Hitler', 'obsession', 'was', 'Himmler', 'eventually', 'proclaimed', 'dictator', 'Hitler', 'was', 'confined', 'Berlin', 'bunker', 'whereupon', 'Hitler', 'placed', 'sentence', 'death', 'overreach', 'authority']",Valkyrie

Schindler's List told the story of some valorous citizens. Now Valkyrie has done the same with the military, relating the details of a nearly successful conspiracy among a cadre of high ranking officers to assassinate Hitler, overthrow his regime, and end the war. This is an extraordinary film, one in which the suspense builds slowly, always heightened by a sense of foreboding, since we know they will fail. The cast is superb (what a treat to see Terence Stamp again), with the power to convey, mostly nonverbally, the awesome courage required to risk everything for the greater good. Shot in Germany, the visuals capture the cold-blooded essence of Naziism, and the firing squad scenes are particularly effective. Only a few problems stand out. The orchestral score is a fine, unobtrusive one, until the conspiracy begins unravelling, at which point the music grows so tragic that it's cloying.

1212427,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B001KZIRKY,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is a brilliant, powerful and very realistic film describing the 20 July 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi regime. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.The real story of anti-Nazi plot which ultimately led to 20 July crisis is quite well known, let's therefore just present here the main lines. It was already in 1938 that three high ranking officers of Wehrmacht, Field Marshal Erich von Witzlebben and generals Ludwig Beck and Hans Oster formed a conspiracy to overthrow Hitler. After the Kristallnacht in November 1938 revealed the true face of Nazi regime, they were joined by other people, including a prominent conservative monarchist politician Carl Goerdeler and also Helmuth Graf von Moltke, a simple lawyer but who by his familial background had vast connexions in German aristocracy and other elites.All attempts to push Wehrmacht commanders to overthrow Hitler however failed and finally the plotters decided that it was necessary to kill Hitler first, before any coup attempt. With time, the group grew larger and more high ranking officers joined, including generals Henning von Tresckow and Friedrich Obricht - it was they who attempted to kill Hitler in March 1943, but the bomb placed in his plane failed to detonate. Unable to pierce Hitler's security, plotters tried to convince again some highest ranking military commanders of Wehrmacht to stage a coup - but without success. It is however revealing, that neither of those men (von Kluge, von Rundstedt, von Manstein and even Rommel!) reported the plotters to Gestapo.In August 1943 two new men joined the conspiracy, quite junior in grade, but very efficient and devoted - Lieutenant-Colonel (later Colonel) Albrecht Mertz von Quirheim and Lieutenant-Colonel (later also promoted to Colonel) Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. They quite quickly took the control of the planning of the whole conspiracy and the 20 July 1944 crisis was in great part the result of their efforts, with Stauffenberg taking on himself the riskiest part of the operation. I will say no more - if you are not familiar with this story, you deserve to discover this incredible but tru stor by yourself.This film is a fast paced, very tense and extremely dramatic reconstruction of events preceding the 20 July and of this famous crisis itself. The pace and the suspense are such that at the end of the film it is really hard to believe that 124 minutes passed... The film also tells a tragic tale (it is hardly a spoiler to say that Hitler survived - and therefore the conspirators couldn't...) and yet it is not depressing - the plotters failed, BIG TIME, but they preserved their honor, and therefore once the last words of this film are spoken, it leaves the viewer very shaken and yet somehow strangely elated. Indeed I could also hear Stauffenberg and his companions say those words from the Bible: &#34;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I kept the faith&#34; - especially considering that most of those men were devoted Catholics...Another treasure of this film is the presentation of life under the Nazi regime with its main &#34;attraction&#34; being present everywhere and affecting everybody, the Nazis included - mind paralizing, bones freezing FEAR! With the possible exception of the four men in the First Circle of Power whom we can see briefly in one scene (Hitler, Goring, Goebbels and Himmler) EVERYBODY in Third Reich lived in constant terror, as they could be arrested, tortured and executed at any moment for any reason. This is also why almost everybody in this film all the time takes a great care to not speak too openly, as Gestapo spies and microphones are everywhere...Actors did an amazing job in this film, including Tom Cruise, who, notwithstanding all the excentricities and oddities of his personal life, is a GREAT ACTOR - and proves it here again! For me, the second best performance in this film was that offered by Bill Nighy, who plays general Olbricht, a man almost paralyzed with fear but who nevertheless soldiers on the best he can. Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Wilkinson are also excellent.Bottom line, this is an excellent film telling a true story in a great and very emotional way. I will absolutely keep my DVD for another viewing. Enjoy!",5,"""I am involved in high treason with all means available to me.

1212432,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001KZIRKY,Mark Turner,"[16, 19]","This Memorial Day I was thinking about the soldiers of past wars who placed their lives on the line in an attempt to preserve freedom for so many in this country. It seems as if we've used a holiday to salute them but as with many holidays it boils down to sales pitches and day long war film viewing. And it's always the same films. Now a new movie has a chance to be included in that group.VALKYRIE is the true story about a group of high level German officers in World War II who determined that the only way to save their country was to assassinate Adolph Hitler. These were not the fanatical members of the SS or the Gestapo but every day soldiers who believed in their country who had realized far too late that Hitler was not the man they had hoped for.The film opens with disillusioned Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) in Africa writing in his journal as he tries to obey orders while at the same time save his men. After finding a possible solution, they are attacked and the official who would help is killed and Stauffenberg is severely wounded, losing a hand, an eye and several fingers.Returned to Germany, Stauffenberg is placed in a high level position. There, due to his vocal criticism of how things are going, he is recruited to replace a man recently found guilty of treason. General Olbricht (Bill Nighy) has been given the task to find the replacement and thinks he has found the man in Stauffenberg. Truth be told, he has.A meeting Stauffenberg visits involving those plotting to take over reveals to him that while they have the desire, they don't have the plans in place to do so. Taking out Hitler is one thing, but what do you do afterwards? His research leads him to Operation Valkyrie, a plan set up to bring in the rear guard soldiers stationed in Germany to prevent a coupe or uprising. Once Hitler is killed, this plan goes into effect and the country is then run by whoever controls this army.The plan is placed in motion, other members of the army are recruited for vital roles and the plan calls for Stauffenberg to detonate a time released bomb inside Wolf's Lair, the bunker Hitler gathers together with his generals to plan the war. A single explosion here would be enough to take out Hitler and many of those faithful to him.As history has told us, this plan failed. Not because of its execution but due to numerous circumstances. Hitler's moving the meeting from the bunker to a cooler spot, the bomb being placed behind a heavy table plank preventing it from doing him damage, unstable fuses...all contributed.Without certain knowledge that the bomb had killed Hitler, the organizers follow the lead of Stauffenberg and initiate Valkyrie. Given the time to get it going, the plot might have worked on that level alone, but unfortunately it failed.Knowing the complete story before seeing the film doesn't detract from the drama that it provides. As I said at the beginning, we are witness to a group of determined men who risked their lives and those of their families to put an end to the rule of a madman. As soldiers they served their country, not Hitler. And when it was obvious that he was insane, they continued to serve their country by trying to take him out.As an historical document the movie does a decent job of making us believe we are witness to the events as they unfold. Certainly the more dramatic moments where proclamations are yelled before executions are carried out might not be factual but they do inspire. And how does it stand as a movie? Only so so.As viewers we are bombarded with fast paced images that hold our attention like a giddy schoolchild watching a silver ball bounce back and forth from flipper to bumper in the pinball game that is film. A slower paced film that unfolds slowly isn't likely to hold the attention these days unfortunately. I've often thought that if Alfred Hitchcock were making movies today he'd find himself unemployed. Fast pacing seems to be the rule of thumb now.For those who are willing to set this aside and watch a good story unfold you'll be rewarded with this film. It not only tells a story that many should be made aware of, it does so as completely as two hours can and is executed to perfection by a cast of stand out actors that is second to none.Director Bryan Singer made his mark with THE USUAL SUSPECTS and moved on to the super hero genre with X-MEN and SUPERMAN RETURNS. Here he shows he can tackle a real life story and make us interested while adhering to the tale at hand.VALKYRIE is not a movie for frenetic MTV generation viewers. It is, however, a movie that has earned a spot on the Memorial Day movie list. It's not only the US soldiers that need remembered on those days. It is the men who tried to stop the war as well. And this group deserves credit for doing their best as well.",4,CRUISE TAKES ON HITLER,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,4818,"['Memorial', 'Day', 'was', 'thinking', 'soldiers', 'past', 'wars', 'who',

1212433,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B001KZIRKY,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[3, 4]","There have been five versions of `Valkyrie' told on screen in the last twenty years.  1990 had the excellent Brad Davis in ""The Plot To Kill Hitler"", 2004 had ""Operation Valkyrie"" by Sebastion Koch and 2008 produced two films, ""Killing Hitler:  The True Story Of The Valkyrie Plot"" and ""Operation Valkyrie: The Stauffenberg Plot To Kill Hitler"".  For those interested, the word valkyrie is derived from `old horse' valkyrja (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb kj&oacute;sa (meaning ""to choose""). Together, the words mean ""chooser of the slain.""  A word chosen by Hitler himself.  The story tells of the 1944 attempt by several High Command German Officers to asassinate Hitler and take over control of the German government.  Colonel Stauffenberg led a resistance group who managed to plant a bomb in Hitler's battlefield headquarters.  The bomb went off.  We all know how Hitler really died.Now this year we have ""Valkyrie"" starring a host of grand actors like, Tom Wilkinson, Terrance Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Eddie Izzard. Hitler is played to perfection by a lesser-known actor named David Bamber.  All sport British/German accents, which helps the credibility of the story.  Then we have Tom Cruise as Colonel Stauffenberg.  He is horrendously and miserably miscast.  The beginning of the film has a Tom Cruise sound-alike German voice speaking that tries to slowly evolve into Cruise's American voice.  It's as big a bomb as the one that goes off in Hitler's bunker.The direction by Bryan Singer is, of course, well done with first class cinematography and surround sounds of explosions and gunfire.  All the acting is first rate, except for Tom Cruise who rarely raises his voice and looks meek and stoic throughout the film.  I am sorry to bash Mr. Cruise, but he is just terribly miscast.  He shows little emotion, drive or passion.  Brad Davis in the 1990 version was excellent, showing a wide range of emotions, especially towards the plot, his companions and his family.  In fact, Davis successful changes his accent even if it isn't perfect German or British.The Singer film is perfectly adequate, but I found myself sighing every time Cruise appears on film (and not the good kind of sighing).  Singer does manage to be faithful to the original story, only changing some scenes to highlight Cruise.  Many of the scenes of the Stauffenberg house, the bunker in the forest and others are identical and it manages to feel like WWII Germany (it was filmed there), but the ending set-up seems contrived, even if it is true.  The Stauffenberg family was imprisoned and released a few years later, something not noted in the Singer film.If you have never heard the story, it is an amazing part of history.  The supporting cast couldn't be better and Director Singer knows how to handle suspense and the horrors of war.  However, Tom Cruise is simply ""Risky Business"" Tom Cruise in a German uniform.  He is completely out of place.

1212435,A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI,B001KZIRKY,Matthew P. Cochrane,"[6, 8]","Valkyrie is a movie based on the true story of the 1944 plot by German army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Starring Tom Cruise, the film contains all of the necessary elements for successful cinema: good acting, a worthy plot and suspenseful drama. Despite knowing of the ultimate failure of the assassination plot, the movie still is able to hold the audience in rapt attention.The movie begins when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is injured while fighting Allied forces in northern Africa. Losing an arm and an eye in the attack, Stauffenberg is sent back to Berlin as an officer in the German army reserves. There he becomes involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi government so that peace can be brokered with the Allies. After several failed attempts, Stauffenberg succeeds to detonate a bomb in a situation room where Hitler is briefing his top generals. Believing Hitler to be dead, Stauffenberg races back to Berlin while his co-conspirators seizes control of the German reserve army and order them to arrest all SS troops, falsely accusing them of killing Hitler. The coup begins to succeed but falls apart when Hitler makes a national broadcast to prove he was still alive.Spoiler Alert!!!The SS troops are released from prison and surround the conspirators' headquarters where Stauffenberg and his accomplices are summarily executed.End Spoiler Alert!!!Cruise does an excellent job of portraying Colonel Stauffenberg and turns in one of the better performances of his career. The movie is actually remarkably historically accurate, as far as it goes, and truthfully relates the events almost exactly as they transpired. One can't help but wonder how different history could have turned out if the bomb Stauffenberg detonated had succeeded in killing Hitler or if the Valkyrie coup had succeeded in overthrowing the Nazi government. There are several moments in the movie where you realize if people involved in the Valkyrie plot had faithfully carried out their part in the coup, things might have turned out quite differently.I consider the film's criticism for not showcasing German accents to be minor and unrelated to the quality of the film.I appreciate the movie's attempt to convey the courage and moral fortitude these German soldiers displayed to actually move forward with a plot to assassinate their country's leader. They recognized that in order to be a ""good German"" they had to stop the ""bad Germans."" Though it was unquestionably the right thing to do and a valiant attempt to save lives, the officers involved still had to make several tough decisions along the way, knowing that if they failed in their attempts they faced certain torture and death.Many have pointed out, correctly, that Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators at first supported Hitler when he first rose to power.  This is true, yet they still deserve credit for realizing their errors and attempting to atone for their mistakes, even if it was belated.The movie only briefly alludes to Stauffenberg's devout Catholicism which undoubtedly paid a pivotal role in his decision to oppose Hitler. Though the movie does not mention it, Stauffenberg was also a member of German nobility. This is interesting only because those who were most prone to opposing Hitler were either the Christians, German aristocracy or the capitalists. Thus Stauffenberg met two of these characteristics. Though it is shamefully nearly forgotten today, the Nazis were a radical left-wing socialist movement and publicized themselves as a worker party.",4,Valkyrie is Historical Drama at Its Finest,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,3564,"['Valkyrie', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', '1944', 'plot', 'German', 'army', 'officers', 'assassinate', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'film', 'necessary', 'elements', 'successful', 'cinema', 'good', 'acting', 'worthy', 'plot', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'knowing', 'ultimate', 'failure', 'assassination', 'plot', 'movie', 'still', 'able', 'hold', 'audience', 'rapt', 'attention.The', 'movie', 'when', 'Colonel', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'injured', 'fighting', 'Allied', 'forces', 'northern', 'Africa', 'Losing', 'arm', 'eye', 'attack', 'Stauffenberg', 'sent', 'back', 'Berlin', 'officer', 'German', 'army', 'reserves', 'involved', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Hitler', 'overthrow', 'Nazi', 'government', 'peace', 'can', 'be', 'brokered', 'Allies', 'several', 'failed', 'attempts', 'Stauffenberg', 'detonate', 'bomb', 'situation', 'room', 'where', 'Hitler', 'briefing', 'top', 'generals', 'Believing', 'Hitler', 'be', 'dead', 'Stauffenberg', 'back', 'Berlin', 'co-conspirators', 'seizes', 'control', 'German', 'reserve', 'army', 'order', 'arrest', 'SS', 'troops', 'falsely', 'accusing', 'killing', 'Hitler', 'coup', 'succeed', 'apart', 'when', 'Hitler', 'national', 'broadcast', 'prove', 'was', 'still', 'alive.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'SS', 'troops', 'are', 'released', 'prison', 'surround', 'conspirators', 'headquarters', 'where', 'Stauffenberg', 'accomplices', 'are', 'summarily', 'executed.End', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Cruise', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Colonel', 'Stauffenberg', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'career', 'movie', 'actually', 'remarkably', 'historically', 'accurate', 'as', 'far', 'truthfully', 'events', 'almost', 'exactly', 'transpired', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'different', 'history', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'bomb', 'Stauffenberg', 'detonated', 'had', 'succeeded', 'killing', 'Hitler', 'Valkyrie', 'coup', 'had', 'succeeded', 'overthrowing', 'Nazi', 'government', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'realize', 'people', 'involved', 'Valkyrie', 'plot', 'had', 'faithfully', 'carried', 'out', 'part', 'coup', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'quite', 'differently.I', 'consider', 'film', 'criticism', 'not', 'showcasing', 'German', 'accents', 'be', 'minor', 'unrelated', 'quality', 'film.I', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'attempt', 'convey', 'courage', 'moral', 'fortitude', 'German', 'soldiers', 'displayed', 'actually', 'move', 'forward', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'country', 'leader', 'recognized', 'order', 'be', 'good', 'German', 'had', 'stop', 'bad', 'Germans', 'was', 'unquestionably', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'save', 'lives', 'officers', 'involved', 'still', 'had', 'make', 'several', 'tough', 'decisions', 'way', 'knowing', 'failed', 'attempts', 'faced', 'certain', 'torture', 'death.Many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'correctly', 'Stauffenberg', 'co-conspirators', 'first', 'supported', 'Hitler', 'when', 'first', 'rose', 'power', 'true', 'yet', 'still', 'deserve', 'credit', 'realizing', 'errors', 'attempting', 'atone', 'mistakes', 'even', 'was', 'belated.The', 'movie', 'only', 'alludes', 'Stauffenberg', 'devout', 'Catholicism', 'undoubtedly', 'paid', 'pivotal', 'role', 'decision', 'oppose', 'Hitler', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'Stauffenberg', 'was', 'also', 'member', 'German', 'nobility', 'interesting', 'only', 'who', 'were', 'most', 'prone', 'opposing', 'Hitler', 'were', 'either', 'Christians', 'German', 'aristocracy', 'capitalists', 'Thus', 'Stauffenberg', 'met', 'two', 'characteristics', 'shamefully', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'today', 'Nazis', 'were', 'radical', 'left-wing', 'socialist', 'movement', 'publicized', 'worker', 'party']",Valkyrie
1212436,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B001KZIRKY,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[10, 11]","The movie:Valkyrie tells the tale of a plot to assassinate and overthrow the government of Adolph Hitler. By the time the war was winding down and Germany seemed to be on the losing side, many members of the military felt that suing for peace was the rational course - one that Hitler vehemently disagreed with, being set upon a disastrous ""fight to the end"" course which would end up claiming countless more lives.Our protagonist in this drama is Count Claus Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), a young Catholic Colonel in the German army who is injured in Africa, losing a hand and an eye. Already weary of the war and disdainful of Nazi policies, he is recruited by the resistance led by General Edward Beck (Terence Stamp). Their idea: assassinate Hitler, and then use Hitler's own contingency plan, code-named ""Valkyrie,"" to take control of the government apparatus in Berlin and install economist/politician Carl Goerdeler as chancellor.The film creates a palpable sense of tension, which is, alas, undercut by the sheer parade of guys in uniform who are not really explained or identified. I would consider myself at least an amateur student of the era, having read all 1150 pages of Shirer's ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich""... and I was still having a little bit of trouble following all the winding machinations of the plot and the players in it.Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise. Never during the teleplay did I forget that I was watching Tom Cruise. Terence Stamp is very good, and most of the supporting players are fun to watch as well. There are, however, no real particular stand-out or ""scenery chewing"" performances. It's all very brisk and utilitarian.Overall, this is a fine movie, but not the kind of period film that really whisks you away to a new time and place (like ""The Aviator,"" ""Zodiac"" or ""Milk""), or has you at the edge of your seat (like ""The Dark Knight""). It's moderately entertaining. History buffs will find a lot to like. The average movie-goer will probably come away thinking ""yep, those Nazis were pretty bad."" Which is too bad, because the message of the film is that there were many Germans who resisted, despite how it might seem to the outside world.The Blu-Ray:Any criticism of ""Valkyrie"" is directed only at the film itself - the Blu-Ray is phenomenal. We are presented with a 1.78:1 image (i.e. one that fills a widescreen TV) that possesses exceptional detail. Dust motes after an explosion are visible. Fine facial lines, strands of hair, beads of sweat. The textures of wood, leather, gravel. Beautiful forests and airfields. It's really a top-notch HD experience. Particularly nice is the light but easily apparent film grain that permeates the transfer - thankfully not washed away by excessive digital noise reduction, which gives ""Valkyrie"" a nice film-like appearance on Blu-Ray. Audio is fine as well, with booming explosions, echoing shouts and ""heils,"" all very nicely rendered in the surround space.What truly amazes me are the quality of the extras - a 2 hour documentary is included, in 1080p, explaining the backdrop of the period. It is quite informative. Also included are commentaries, making of segments, and the like. It's amazing that the film looks so good even though there are essentially 4.5 hours of 1080p HD all on one disc. I guess they really used the 50gb capacity of Blu-Ray to its fullest here. It's so nice not to have extras banished to a second disc. Kudos!********Overall, this is a solid genre flick for fans of WWII drama. Those unfamiliar with the setting may be a bit lost during the proceedings, but a fine set of extras will fill them in if they devote the time to them. This is not a classic that will have you thinking about it for days afterward, or have your palms sweating with tension as you watch. But it's a good film that should find an audience with such a solid HD presentation to back it up. The a/v quality is top shelf, and could easily be used as ""demo"" material to impress friends or customers who are dubious of the benefits of Blu-Ray.",4,"Pretty good movie, stellar Blu-Ray",1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,4037,"['movie', 'Valkyrie', 'tale', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'overthrow', 'government', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'time', 'war', 'was', 'winding', 'down', 'Germany', 'seemed', 'be', 'losing', 'side', 'many', 'members', 'military', 'felt', 'suing', 'peace', 'was', 'rational', 'course', 'one', 'Hitler', 'vehemently', 'disagreed', 'being', 'set', 'disastrous', 'fight', 'end', 'course', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'claiming', 'countless', 'more', 'lives.Our', 'protagonist', 'drama', 'Count', 'Claus', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'young', 'Catholic', 'Colonel', 'German', 'army', 'who', 'injured', 'Africa', 'losing', 'hand', 'eye', 'Already', 'weary', 'war', 'disdainful', 'Nazi', 'policies', 'recruited', 'resistance', 'led', 'General', 'Edward', 'Beck', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'idea', 'assassinate', 'Hitler', 'then', 'use', 'Hitler', 'own', 'contingency', 'plan', 'code-named', 'Valkyrie', 'take', 'control', 'government', 'apparatus', 'Berlin', 'install', 'economist/politician', 'Carl', 'Goerdeler', 'chancellor.The', 'film', 'palpable', 'sense', 'tension', 'alas', 'undercut', 'sheer', 'parade', 'guys', 'uniform', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'explained', 'identified', 'would', 'consider', 'least', 'amateur', 'student', 'era', 'having', 'read', '1150', 'pages', 'Shirer', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Third', 'Reich', 'was', 'still', 'having', 'little', 'bit', 'trouble', 'following', 'winding', 'machinations', 'plot', 'players', 'it.Tom', 'Cruise', 'well', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Never', 'teleplay', 'did', 'forget', 'was', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'however', 'real', 'particular', 'stand-out', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'performances', 'very', 'brisk', 'utilitarian.Overall', 'fine', 'movie', 'not', 'kind', 'period', 'film', 'really', 'whisks', 'away', 'new', 'time', 'place', 'Aviator', 'Zodiac', 'Milk', 'edge', 'seat', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'History', 'buffs', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'like', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'will', 'probably', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'yep', 'Nazis', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Which', 'too', 'bad', 'message', 'film', 'were', 'many', 'Germans', 'who', 'resisted', 'how', 'might', 'seem', 'outside', 'world.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'criticism', 'Valkyrie', 'directed', 'only', 'film', 'Blu-Ray', 'phenomenal', 'are', 'presented', '1.78:1', 'image', 'i.e', 'one', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'exceptional', 'detail', 'Dust', 'motes', 'explosion', 'are', 'visible', 'Fine', 'facial', 'lines', 'strands', 'hair', 'beads', 'sweat', 'textures', 'wood', 'leather', 'gravel', 'Beautiful', 'forests', 'airfields', 'really', 'top-notch', 'HD', 'experience', 'Particularly', 'nice', 'light', 'easily', 'apparent', 'film', 'grain', 'transfer', 'thankfully', 'not', 'washed', 'away', 'excessive', 'digital', 'noise', 'reduction', 'Valkyrie', 'nice', 'film-like', 'appearance', 'Blu-Ray', 'Audio', 'fine', 'as', 'well', 'booming', 'explosions', 'echoing', 'shouts', 'heils', 'very', 'nicely', 'rendered', 'surround', 'space.What', 'truly', 'are', 'quality', 'extras', '2', 'hour', 'documentary', 'included', '1080p', 'explaining', 'backdrop', 'period', 'quite', 'informative', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'commentaries', 'making', 'segments', 'like', 'amazing', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'even', 'are', 'essentially', '4.5', 'hours', '1080p', 'HD', 'one', 'disc', 'guess', 'really', 'used', '50gb', 'capacity', 'Blu-Ray', 'fullest', 'here', 'so', 'nice', 'not', 'have', 'extras', 'banished', 'second', 'disc', 'Kudos', '********Overall', 'solid', 'genre', 'flick', 'fans', 'WWII', 'drama', 'unfamiliar', 'setting', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'lost', 'proceedings', 'fine', 'set', 'extras', 'will', 'fill', 'devote', 'time', 'not', 'classic', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'days', 'afterward', 'have', 'palms', 'sweating', 'tension', 'watch', 'good', 'film', 'should', 'find', 'audience', 'solid', 'HD', 'presentation', 'back', 'up', 'a/v', 'quality', 'top', 'shelf', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'used', 'demo', 'material', 'impress', 'friends', 'customers', 'who', 'are', 'dubious', 'benefits', 'Blu-Ray']",Valkyrie

1212438,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B001KZIRKY,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","Valkyrie's premise - the plot to kill Hitler - was practically scripted for a movie.  Preparing for my Delta Green role-playing game campaign meant researching Nazis and Project Valkyrie, a major historical but oft-ignored event by the American public.  Until now.Because the movie is based on a historical account, typical models of assessing a film - like a twist ending, for example - aren't possible.  We know how things turned out.  In fact, doing research on how Valkyrie came about and ended somewhat tarnished the movie for me.  Valkyrie's not bad, but it wasn't the great drama I hoped it would be.Tom Cruise is perfectly serviceable as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, and the surrounding cast does an excellent job of showing what amounts to a typical bureaucracy.  The more apparent it becomes that Germany might lose the war, the more urgent the plans to overthrow him.But there were other factors motivating these desperate men, factors that are somewhat lost in the film.  My understanding - and I admit this is limited, as I'm no WWII scholar - is that the nobility that led warfare in olden times, and specifically World War I, felt that there was a ""wrong"" and ""right"" way to conduct a war.  Hitler didn't so much offend this old guard's sense of moral responsibility as it did their sense of following the rules according to an educated upper class.  In a sense, Hitler's war was a peoples' war, waged at whatever cost and using whatever resources necessary and, at times, ignoring the right of the nobility to determine how a conflict was conducted.This is important because Stauffenberg, and some of the elites involved in the attempted coup, were members of this aggrieved ruling class.  This isn't to say that Stauffenberg didn't find Hitler's policies reprehensible, but as a large group, it helps explain the framework for why a coup would even be conceived.  This entire thrust seems to be deemphasized in the film.  It's almost as if Singer was concerned that playing up Stauffenberg's nobility might be a comment on Cruise himself.The other part that seems to be lacking from the film is the miserable ending for the conspirators.  Stulpnagel, the German commander in France, tried to shoot himself several times before being captured by the Gestapo.  There is a brief scene where the surviving conspirators are put on a mock trial and holding their pants up; this is because they weren't given belts, to humiliate them more.  The scene flashes by so fast that, to a viewer who is unaware of those circumstances, it just seems like the defendants lost a lot of weight and are holding up their pants.And that sums up the problems I had with the movie.  The tension is ratcheted up, there are little known scenes drawn from actual history that further enhance the film, but it all seems to be disconnected from the greater war.  It's like Valkyrie took place in a hermetically sealed film universe. This adds to the claustrophobia of the conspiracy, but doesn't quite satisfy those looking for a historical context.",4,Narrowly-focused drama,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,3040,"['Valkyrie', 'premise', 'plot', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'was', 'practically', 'scripted', 'movie', 'Preparing', 'Delta', 'Green', 'role-playing', 'game', 'campaign', 'meant', 'researching', 'Nazis', 'Project', 'Valkyrie', 'major', 'historical', 'oft-ignored', 'event', 'American', 'public', 'movie', 'based', 'historical', 'account', 'typical', 'models', 'assessing', 'film', 'twist', 'ending', 'example', 'are', ""n't"", 'possible', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'turned', 'out', 'fact', 'doing', 'research', 'how', 'Valkyrie', 'came', 'about', 'ended', 'somewhat', 'tarnished', 'movie', 'Valkyrie', 'not', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'drama', 'hoped', 'would', 'be.Tom', 'Cruise', 'perfectly', 'serviceable', 'Colonel', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'surrounding', 'cast', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'what', 'amounts', 'typical', 'bureaucracy', 'more', 'apparent', 'Germany', 'might', 'lose', 'war', 'more', 'urgent', 'plans', 'overthrow', 'him.But', 'were', 'other', 'factors', 'motivating', 'desperate', 'men', 'factors', 'are', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'film', 'understanding', 'admit', 'limited', ""'m"", 'WWII', 'scholar', 'nobility', 'led', 'warfare', 'olden', 'times', 'specifically', 'World', 'War', 'felt', 'was', 'wrong', 'right', 'way', 'conduct', 'war', 'Hitler', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'offend', 'old', 'guard', 'sense', 'moral', 'responsibility', 'did', 'sense', 'following', 'rules', 'according', 'educated', 'upper', 'class', 'sense', 'Hitler', 'war', 'was', 'peoples', 'war', 'waged', 'cost', 'using', 'resources', 'necessary', 'times', 'ignoring', 'right', 'nobility', 'determine', 'how', 'conflict', 'was', 'conducted.This', 'important', 'Stauffenberg', 'elites', 'involved', 'attempted', 'coup', 'were', 'members', 'aggrieved', 'ruling', 'class', ""n't"", 'say', 'Stauffenberg', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Hitler', 'policies', 'reprehensible', 'large', 'group', 'explain', 'framework', 'why', 'coup', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'conceived', 'entire', 'thrust', 'be', 'deemphasized', 'film', 'almost', 'Singer', 'was', 'concerned', 'playing', 'up', 'Stauffenberg', 'nobility', 'might', 'be', 'comment', 'Cruise', 'himself.The', 'other', 'part', 'be', 'lacking', 'film', 'miserable', 'ending', 'conspirators', 'Stulpnagel', 'German', 'commander', 'France', 'tried', 'shoot', 'several', 'times', 'being', 'captured', 'Gestapo', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'surviving', 'conspirators', 'are', 'put', 'mock', 'trial', 'holding', 'pants', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'belts', 'humiliate', 'more', 'scene', 'flashes', 'fast', 'viewer', 'who', 'unaware', 'circumstances', 'just', 'defendants', 'lost', 'lot', 'weight', 'are', 'holding', 'up', 'pants.And', 'up', 'problems', 'had', 'movie', 'tension', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'are', 'little', 'known', 'scenes', 'drawn', 'actual', 'history', 'further', 'enhance', 'film', 'be', 'disconnected', 'greater', 'war', 'Valkyrie', 'took', 'place', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'film', 'universe', 'claustrophobia', 'conspiracy', ""n't"", 'quite', 'satisfy', 'looking', 'historical', 'context']",Valkyrie

The other thing was the overwhelming obvious fact that Hitler died of suicide, so you're left watching a movie that you know isn't going to end with von Stauffenberg being successful.(I joked that the Cliff's Notes movie would be something to the effect of: ""Quick, we must stop Hitler!

Tom Cruise is fine as Stauffenberg, with just enough depth to portray the level of charisma the man must surely have had to get as far as he did, and the boldness he must have had to start the whole process with as much confidence as he seems to have had.  The rest of the cast is like a who's who of British cinema, reminding the viewer of the classic war movies of old.  And the movie really does seem to share a gene pool with those epic war movies recreating real life movies, with the same pros and cons they had.  On the plus side, the movie convinces on authenticity.  Events appear close to the known facts, without too much embroidering for effect.  The budget, though not overblown by today's standards, and fairly small by Cruise' standards, has enough to create some terrific set design - the planes, the settings, the real life locations, and the recreation of the wolf's lair - all help to immerse you in the story.  On the minus side, the cast are all worthy, but never outstanding.  It's as if they are playing their roles with kid gloves, to be as reverential as possible to people who actually existed.  Perhaps with one exception - Bill Nighy portrays the films more ambiguous character, in a role which starts to flesh out some of the anguish that must have been felt building up to what amounted to High Treason.  It's a performance which manages to scratch a little beneath the surface of how it would have felt, rather than the bare facts - and yet still treats the character with respect.Kudos to director Bryan Singer then - he has taken a moribund genre (WW II thriller), with a story we know the ending to, and still managed to make something relatively nail biting, and certainly visually satisfying.

Complete with an fantastic ensemble cast led by Cruise--who despite being a bit of a loon does in fact know how to act--the film is compelling, well made, and thoroughly enjoyable. It's only real downside is the obvious problem that we already know the ending, and no matter how much we want the plot against Hitler to succeed, we know that it can't and won't. Director Bryan Singer does a great job of keeping things suspenseful under the circumstances, but it is really the stellar cast that drive the movie forward.The sets and art direction are fantastic, and as a fan of WWII history and especially warplanes, it was a pleasure to see the HE 111s, and even more so the fully restored P-40s used in the opening scene. About as historically accurate as I expected, the film is able to convey a more nuanced view of German officers than the stereotypes typically presented in American propaganda pieces that portray all of them as baby-murdering psychopaths. There were plenty  of those among the Nazis, don't get me wrong, but it's interesting to have probably the most hated regime of the modern era presented in the light of their poorly known resistance movement and its divergent heroes. In light of their impossible situation, it brings interesting questions to the surface: faced with a similar situation, how many of us would have the bravery to stare evil in the face and forfeit our own lives for our beliefs?As a film, VALKYRIE succeeds. As a history lesson, it's just as good. It's a great movie to watch with your kids (as long as they're old enough to handle the violent moments of the film) to start a discussion of the moral complexities of war; of how good men and women can get stuck on the wrong side, and of how blind love of your country can lead you down some pretty scary paths.4/5 Stars.

Told mostly from Stauffenberg's and his crew's point of view, Valkyrie is clever and often engaging, but the moments of the film that are supposed to be suspenseful just end up coming up pretty empty.

It has elevated many movies like ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Minority Report"" from being mediocre sci-fi fare to great popcorn films. It's ok to be in love with Katie Holmes, and truly love Scientology, as long as your movies are good and entertaining, which is exactly what ""Valkyrie"" is. Directed by Bryan Singer, I was happy to get what I expected from the film, a good (not GREAT) thriller, involving true events during WWII. The story of the group of Nazi politicians and generals of the army trying to assasinate Hitler was a new one to me, and after doing some research, I can safely say that the film hit all the right facts. The acting by some major british actors is very well done, including a wonderful character by Bill Nighy. Singers direction emphasizes on the assassination plot rather than the characters of the film, so even though Cruise acted well enough, it wasn't worthy of an oscar. The production values were great, and the minor special effects used in the film fit the setting perfectly. If one watches this films with the expectations of a modern thriller based in a WWII setting, you will be plenty satisfied. I just wish they would've delved deeper into the mind of Cruise's character, Gen. Stauffenberg, which would have made the final scenes in the film much more memorable.4 out of 5.The Blu-Ray:Video:Well, this is definitely a good transfer, with some minor set backs. Colors are bold and spot-on, and blacks are nice, though not as inky as I'm used to. The only nit pick I had with this transfer was the obscurity of fine detail. I am used to seeing all of the individual strands of hair or the textures of uniforms, and in this BD, it was slightly lacking. Still, nit picks aside, this is a very good transfer.4 out of 5.Audio:This DTS-HD MA packs a whallop. This is a dialogue driven film, and that is the only problem with the audio aspect, volume matching. At many times I had to raise the volume to understand the dialogue, and had to lower it since the bombastic moments were too loud. This takes away from the ""Movie"" experience. Other than that, everything else is dead on. Pans and directionality are crystal clear, and the bass, oh the bass. I watched the film with a couple of friends, and they all jumped when the bomb went off in the Wolf's Lair. Not a bad mix at all.4.5 out of 5.If you are fan of Tom Cruise or Bryan Singer, or just a lover of anything WWII, then watch this film.

This extraordinary story reflects the bravery of the people within Germany who did resist the Nazis. To be fair, it probably underplayed the risk as I am sure the reprisals against the families of the plotters were brutal.Cruise is perfectly capable in this film, the man can act and it's a shame that his off screen antics overshadow his performances. It seems that the industry is willing him to make a stinker so they can perform some sort of Coup de Grace on him and finish him off.He is backed by a fine cast of largely British character actors and quite right, they have laid off the ""ver are zey going"" cod German accents.

It transitions nicely from German in the first few minutes, just to show that actually, the Germans in WW"" actually spoke German, just in case anyone was in doubt, still, it was nicely done.

I need not comment on the acting; all main parts were played by exceptionally gifted actors.

Re-watching the movie on TV last night reminded me of the strengths (many)  and weaknesses (very few) of this film. It also reminded me of many of the off-kilter reviews posted on Amazon, one of which was the portrayal of Hitler by David Bamberg.  Most of the negative reviews seem to think he played Hitler too much as an exhausted and distracted, worn out rag doll. How could the ruler of Nazi Germany get away with being such a weakling?  A 'cariacture' as one reviewer wrote. Let's put this to rest once and for all.  In 1970 I spent two hours with Albert Speer ( Hitler's minister of armaments) at his home in Heidleberg.  Speer had just released his memoirs,  'Inside the Third Reich'.  Naturally, during my conversation I asked him about Hitler, especially during the latter part of the war.  His description of Hitler ( and who would know better?) was exactly the way Bamberg portrayed him. Exactly.  This is substantiated by the numerous memoirs and autobiographies of others who knew Hitler at that time. It's easily verifiable by watching films and photographs of Hitler taken in mid/late 1944. Therefore it's clear to me that  Bamberg, the director and the film's historians had done thorough research in planning the portrayal for shooting.

Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[2, 3]","""Look them in the eye, they'll remember you.""Much has been made of the controversial Tom Cruise's role in this film, and I too was somewhat skeptical of what he, along with ""Hollywood,"" would do with this heroic tale. As it turns out, the film was much better than I expected. Cruise is a strange dude, no doubt, but the man is not a bad actor and I found him perfectly sufficient in portraying the personage of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. It should be noted as well that Cruise bears a striking resemblance to the real Stauffenberg.It seems needless to say, but 'Valkyrie' is the story of the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Stauffenberg, an aristocratic Christian type, was just one of a large conspiracy of army officers to take down the Fuhrer. Stauffenberg is the central character because of his willingness to do the deed personally. Their reasons for doing so were no doubt varied and complex, but to write them off as mere self-serving traitors (as some have done) would be preposterous. Watching the film, one is struck by the physical and moral courage these men displayed, knowing all along what their potential fate would be. Say what you will, these men were downright heroic. Which is also why one can't help but share in the heartbreak as their briefly promising plan disintegrates before their eyes. These men are tragic heroes.The film is relatively simple, nothing flashy, just a compelling drama. The acting is generally good, my only blatant complaint is the guy who played Hitler. Too much of a skulking caricature, but this was very minor. As a student of history, I was already familiar with the story but sadly, I think it's safe to say that many Americans are quite ignorant of the fact that there were indeed many ""good Germans"" such as these men.

Colonel von Stauffenberg's motives may have been personally the highest, but the attempt to drape the whole German Army in the rightousness of his protest goes too far.  The Wehrmacht's role in war crimes is too well-documented.  The motive for most of the plotters (and the film does allude to this) were to scrape Germany's wartorn nuts out of the fire by assassinating Hitler, make peace with the Western Alles, and prevent the occupation of Germany, repeating the successful diplomacy of WW I.  No doubt the outcome for Germany would have been happier if the plot had succeeded.Cruise does an excellent job portraying the Colonel, and even bears a striking physical resemblance to the real man. A lot was crammed into two hours of film, which might make it uneven and perhaps confusing for those unfamiliar with the story.  This is compensated by its swift to-the-bone pace, making for a gripping film that is best watched complete from beginning to end.  The reconstruction of period detail is impeccable throughout.A revealing afternote to the story: Wehrmacht war criminals sentenced at Nuremberg were released from American custody at the insistence of Federal Chancellor Adenauer in 1955, to gain the officer corps' cooperation in forming the new NATO-led Bundeswehr.  This included their amnesty and complete rehabilitation.  Many of these officers returned to active duty, justifying their wartime deeds with highly revisionist accounts of Germany's wartime ""struggle"" and ""sacrifice,"" while draping themselves in the mantle of von Stauffenberg's attempted redemption.  Fortunately for the modern Bundeswehr that he was executed, as he would have doubtless taken aim next at its self-serving mythology.Ironic, too, that this story of an act of terror is released and receiving highly-deserved acclaim during a self-described ""War on Terror.""

This is one of those rarities.  Tom Cruise plays Colonel von Stauffenberg, one of the leaders of the plot to kill Hitler, and plays him well.  I wouldn't have thought of Cruise in this role, but it works, and his resemblance to the real von Stauffenberg is uncanny.  Cruise isn't placid; rather his movie persona is tightly controlled as indeed von Stauffenberg must have been.  And yet he makes your emotions crackle when he tells his wife that if he fails in his assassination attempt, ""they"" will come for her and the children.  What a gutsy group these conspirators were, and it's high time their story was told in the cinema.This is history made alive, and it's thrilling to see how the conspiracy shaped up, the arguments behind the scenes and the character foibles of the various conspirators.  You also get to see how incredibly charmed Hitler was to escape the assassination attempt, as he did so many other tries and coups--Beelzebub must have been his guardian angel.  What ""Valkyrie"" brings out so well is von Stauffenberg's logical look at post-Hitler Germany.  It wasn't enough to simply kill Hitler, but to also wrest control of Germany from Hitler's immediate underlings (such as Himmler) and the SS.  Valkyrie was Hitler's own plan to keep Germany under control in case of catastrophe, and in true ju-jitsu fashion von Stauffenberg tried to use his opponent's power against him.This movie is yet another instance in which many paid reviewers simply missed the mark.  I'm irked by political correctsters who are always first on the bandwagon to find what they think are racist or otherwise politically incorrect flaws in a work--think of the scene in ""Borat"" in which the whites at the dinner party are accused of bigotry against Borat's black ""girlfriend,"" when in fact they were repulsed because she was a blatant whore.But I'll break my own rule and speculate that one reason why the American mainstream reviewers so dopily criticized this movie was simply this: they didn't want Germans shown to be anything other than crazed Nazis marching Jews into ovens.  That there was a German resistance to Hitler might just be too much nuance for their bias to handle; it's so much easier to see the entire race as monocled, scar-faced knuckle-draggers.The movie states at the end that there are 15 known attempts to overthrow or kill Hitler.  Why is this datum so little known?  (See above for possible answer.)  Why didn't FDR and Churchill aid and abet the conspirators, for as we now know they were aware of the German dissenters and yet refused to help them?

Nevertheless, after Schindler's List and a few others publicizing the crimes and atrocities of that country, a film dramatizing this little known event of the Reich does Germany a service.  Not all Germans were memorized by Adolf's promises, but, regrettably, it was their dumb luck all 15 of their attempts failed.  Note to self-- ""stay away from assassination plots against Hitler.""For an army corporal to take power and have afraid even Field Marshals is certainly remarkable in and of itself.  But it is this very same corporal even today whose name is reached for when someone seems to become too difficult to deal with ""Your just HITLER,"" or ""you're just like HITLER.""  Adolf had succeeded in creating a pervasive ""Cult of Personality "" around him that far exceeded his physical prowess and reaches across time.  When Col.Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg bomb plot neared, Hitler began to suffer very visibly from physical aliments.The movie portrays well the weak and sickly Adolf, but I do not feel entirely convinced of this ""Cult of Personality"" the intensity of charisma Hitler emanated.  Certainly the actors/ characters  responded as in the telephone scene with Goebbels, to an Adolf who was very much in charge.With Generals in the resistance, one may ask, ""how it is it the Colonel is so influential?""  Historically, the Colonel's strong moral convictions (he was a Catholic) and transfer of key leaders motivated the resistance to take more decisive action.  I got the impression though some of this is contrived, ""ok Hitler got us THIS far, but now that we're losing, the crimes, the dead bodies, yeah THAT's it.""he HAS to GO...""But historically, the Colonel had sincere convictions that caused him to question the German cause from 1942 at least.  One may wonder why this late date, but in a totalitarian society where no one is allowed to own a cell phone and internet access denied , it might take awhile before word gets around.  It is easy to see why Tom Cruise took the role of the Colonel.. He played center role  with many of the scenes revolving around him, but so did the actual Colonel in the real bomb plot of July 20th .Once things go bad and Hitler emerges with a few cuts and bruises (when reading about the other plots as well as this one, there can be little doubt that the man is uncannily lucky) death precedes him.  Millions more die in the war as well the 4,980 people executed as the result of the failed attempt. One might wonder, gee God, briefcase just a little bit to to the other side of that table leg, or ComeON God, make the weather a little cooler so they use the BUNKER as planned by the co-conspirators or WTF Colonel, they gave you TWO explosive charges!!!Still, Hitler was not an immovable force, he could have gotten a clue, changed his ways...maybe even apologized.Joachim von Ribbentrop's  statement  at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946 after Hitler popped himself and the Russians pinched his jawbone: ""Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say 'Do this!', I would still do it.""See this movie!!!Five stars, one taken away for Misc stuff such as er maybe the Hitler actor just was not as intense as I thought he should be, but then , they might really.... have to get HITLER... ok FIVE stars.",5,Good depiction of little known event,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,4292,"['OH', 'NO', 'movie', 'SUBTITLED', 'so', 'thought', 'beginning', 'narration', 'was',

1212515,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B001KZIRKY,Steffan Piper,"[6, 9]","Having recently been invited to a private screening of the film in Los Angeles, I thought I would step forward and offer a few thoughts about the latest Cruise historical drama that tries to recreate and encapsulate the WWII acclaimed German Hero: Claus Count Schenk von Stauffenberg.I'm not a WWII historian, but I have been reading the history deftly for the bulk of my life and I'm fairly well versed in the facts that build the story of the film. I've taken the liberty to list a few of the numerous books that well-detail this account at the bottom of the review in case folks want to read up first. These are my suggestions of the books that I've read, but I'm sure there are some that others will say are better.First, Tom Cruise seems to have set a strong stride in film this year delivering up a very watchable performance in Tropic Thunder that is already garnering nominations. Second, this film could quite possibly be the high-water mark of his entire career, if it can survive the usual bevy of hard-core anti-Cruise critics that typically pop out of the woodwork every time one of his films is about to hit the theatres. Cruise has recently stated that many times people have told him that the films he has often selected to star in, would be career suicide, but by his own admission he's still going strong and has no desire to duck out now.The factual nature of this Valkyrie production, and there definitely have been others, is probably what will pull people in and keep people locked in their seats. Valkyrie has an absolute eerie feel to it that is just downright creepy, but mesmerizing all at once. The reason is probably due to the fact that the film was shot on location throughout Germany and virtually no expense was spared from the sets, the vehicles, the `red banners and flags' that adorn so many scenes that chills and a cold sweat may form on the back of your neck.I'm not going to include spoilers about the story and plot of the film, even though the story is already well known, but Tom Cruise does a very good job at portraying a historical figure who was known for his deep sense of commitment, spiritualism and honor. Some criticism has already been lobbed like a grenade at Cruise, stating that because he is a Scientologist, that he cannot possibly convey the depth of Stauffenberg ... which is just some sad, sad nonsense. I'm no fan of Scientology and I'm only a luke-warm viewer, or rather participant to Tom Cruise, but if the man ever came across on screen as an actor in a film, rather than a self-obsessed personality, then this is the vehicle. I was completely convinced at what I was seeing and knowing that the bulk, probably greater than 95%, of what I was seeing was true.The only fault I could find in this film was the actor playing Adolf Hitler. I guess I was hoping, or rather looking for a performance as disturbing as the one given recently byBruno GanzinDer Untergang(or The Downfall for the rest of us). Bruno Ganz is one of those rare actors that only come along once in a generation and who rarely seem to show up in enough vehicles to satisfy a viewer's curiosity. But this really wasn't about Hitler as much as it was about Stauffenberg.I also was a little taken aback by the lack of Tom Cruise's German accent, which is a very minor thing, but one would've thought that trying to engage in such a `larger than life' character, something would've surfaced from him as an attempt to self-authenticate his role as a German Army Officer and a member of the fallen Aristocracy that part and parcel clearly became duped by the momentum that Adolf cranked forward like self-powered locomotive that would obviously, inevitably, and thankfully de-rail.At several points during this film, I could hear Mario Savio's immortal words repeating in my head:""There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part, you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!""... ...Operation Valkyrie: The Plot Against

1212525,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B001KZIRKY,Terence Allen,"[2, 4]","""Valkyre"" is based on the incidents leading up to and following the famous July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and end the European theater of World War II. Tom Cruise portrays Claus von Stauffenberg, the leader and chief instigator of the plot, which involved killing Hitler with a bomb at the Wolf's Lair, a fortified bunker where Hitler would be meeting with many of his top generals. Von Stauffenberg was a decorated soldier who's lost an arm, an eye, and several fingers in North Africa.There has been lots of controversy involving this film, much of it involving Cruise and the lack of German accents in the film. In the end, films are often made without respect to native languages and accents. That should be an issue here. Cruise is more than capable of playing von Stauffenberg as a dedicated, motivated soldier who for a number of reasons decides to join the conspriracy against Hitler. He is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, Terence Stamp, and others.The film, as with any Hollywood production, takes liberties with the truth. The aftermath of the bomb attempt is not accurate, and the involvement of Wilkinson's character in the plot is different than most historical accounts. But this is to be expected. More importantly, Valkyrie is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.",4,"Gripping, Well-Staged WWII Saga",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,1383,"['Valkyre', 'based', 'incidents', 'leading', 'up', 'following', 'famous', 'July', '20', '1944', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'end', 'European', 'theater', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'leader', 'chief', 'instigator', 'plot', 'involved', 'killing', 'Hitler', 'bomb', 'Wolf', 'Lair', 'fortified', 'bunker', 'where', 'Hitler', 'would', 'be', 'meeting', 'many', 'top', 'generals', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'was', 'decorated', 'soldier', 'who', 'lost', 'arm', 'eye', 'several', 'fingers', 'North', 'Africa.There', 'been', 'lots', 'controversy', 'involving', 'film', 'much', 'involving', 'Cruise', 'lack', 'German', 'accents', 'film', 'end', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'made', 'respect', 'native', 'languages', 'accents', 'should', 'be', 'issue', 'here', 'Cruise', 'more', 'capable', 'playing', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'dedicated', 'motivated', 'soldier', 'who', 'number', 'reasons', 'decides', 'join', 'conspriracy', 'Hitler', 'surrounded', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'others.The', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'liberties', 'truth', 'aftermath', 'bomb', 'attempt', 'not', 'accurate', 'involvement', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'plot', 'different', 'most', 'historical', 'accounts', 'be', 'expected', 'More', 'importantly', 'Valkyrie', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'well-directed']",Valkyrie

He is compelled to destroy this man he knows must be stopped, all the while looking at the faces of his wife and children with the full understanding that this will likely be his own destruction and the destruction of them as well - yet he doesn't waver.  On one side, you have literally the most evil of men and on the other, the most honorable and selfless. There were many such performances in this movie and, again I say, I cannot begin to fathom the pain and the conflict they had to summon to portray the most inconceivable emotion.In my opinion though, perhaps the most affecting scene was not even scripted film, but as they stood on the very ground in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock where Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg,General Friedrich Olbricht, Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, and Lieutenant Werner von Haeften were unmercifully executed by firing squad under a blanket of darkness lit only by the headlights of the vehicles that idled nearby, Christopher McQuarrie, Bryan Singer and Tom Cruise made short remarks followed by a moment of silence, held out of &#34;respect for the place (the Bendlerblock) and for the life achievement of the people who were executed there.&#34; (from interview with actor Christian Berkel (Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim).

That aspect seems to be covered well and little I could say would add value in that area.What I would like to comment about and somewhat warn those thinking about the Blu-ray version of this film is that the audio levels and fluctuation there in may drive viewers a little batty.  What I mean is that for much of the film the dialogue is going to be quiet, almost at a whisper level.  That is as it should be since a lot of the activity is secretive discussion of treasonous plans, but.... well, there's a problem in that if you adjust the volume up so you can hear most of the dialogue when normal (non-whisper level) dialogue comes along it may nearly blast your ears.  Most certainly any explosions, thunder, or other noise will do the job and chase you out of the viewing area.I wish this wasn't a problem here, and perhaps in a different home theatre configuration it might not be a problem at all, but I bring the problem up so that others might be forewarned.In other aspects the Blu-ray is excellent.  Video quality is superb though the color scheme is primarily earth tones (military hues and browns and grays).  The color levels are good and the image is clean and clear.

Sadly, I didn't have the chance to view the movie until it was released on home video.  Nevertheless, upon finishing ""Valkyrie"" I must say I was very, very impressed.  This historical thriller directed astutely by Bryan Singer (X-Men, Usual Suspects) was not only a good movie, but tackled a subject that (from my understanding) hasn't been touched by another filmmaker.  I also want to take this moment to say that the cinematography in this movie was marvelous, both great camera angles and photography of landscapes.As for the acting it was astonishing. I must say that in the past decade Tom Cruise has come along way in his art of performing.  I would place his role as Colonel Von Stauffenberg as one of, if not the best, performance Tom Cruise has ever done.  Sadly the critics are more focused on Tom Cruise's personal life, religious affiliation, his Jennifer Beal impersonation on Oprah's show a few years ago rather his acting.  The supporting cast was also very solid and very good, featuring Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Izzard, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp (among many fine foreign actors and actress as well.)I am very familiar with World War II, but am not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I believe this movie did a wonderful job portraying a moment in world history.

1212547,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B001KZIRKY,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 2]","Although some saw Tom Cruise's last film as a possible propaganda vehicle, it's tempting to look upon it more as a cry for help. After seeing him playing a man so increasingly disillusioned with the insane control-freak tendencies of the personality cult that has taken control of every aspect of its followers lives and sets out to destroy all who disagree with it that he becomes part of a doomed plot to kill its leader, David Miscavige probably made sure the security was trebled next time Cruise visited the compound.Valkyrie is one of those films that's neither the disaster many were hoping for nor quite as good as it could have been, never quite veering to either side as it all too steadily ploughs its course through another retelling of the failed July Plot to assassinate Hitler. If there are no real lows there are also, sadly, precious few highs, the film retelling events efficiently but never really gripping as tightly as it should and only briefly engaging the emotions in the final scenes, and those you suspect more for the fate of the real people involved than those onscreen. It's a noble effort, but it's hard to resist comparing it to the failed assassination attempt: it makes a big noise but it doesn't quite hit the target.Originally intended as a lower-budget directorial outing for co-writer Christopher McQuarrie and German actor Thomas Kretschman, who gets a fairly thankless supporting role as consolation, it's certainly a big improvement on eventual director Bryan Singer's ponderous take on Superman, but despite marshalling some impressive resources thanks to Tom Cruise's involvement, it never quite grasps the epic enormity of its subject: the first half is less a desperate attempt to pull back from the brink of destruction than a series of measured conversations in rooms and offices. Despite some flat one-dimensional characterisation, it doesn't entirely idealise its conspirators - as one unwilling recruit blackmailed into co-operating tells them, they're like rats deserting a sinking ship who may be no better than the people they want to replace - but it's only when their plan starts to go wrong thanks to stalling, indecision and plain bad luck that the film starts to take hold. Multi-tasking editor/composer/co-executive producer John Ottman's score could have given the film more help at times, but only really comes into its own in the end credits. It's a worthy effort, and not nearly as bad as that word now implies, with some good supporting performances from Tom Wilkinson, Christian Berkel, Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp (though Carice van Houten is wasted as Cruise's wife): it just needed to be that bit more forceful and direct to really fulfil its promise.As is increasingly common, the DVD edition stints on the extras - even the documentary is a cutdown version of the one included on the BluRay.",3,A decent try but it misses the target,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2866,"['saw', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'last', 'film', 'possible', 'propaganda', 'vehicle', 'tempting', 'look', 'more', 'cry', 'help', 'seeing', 'playing', 'man', 'so', 'increasingly', 'disillusioned', 'insane', 'control-freak', 'tendencies', 'personality', 'cult', 'taken', 'control', 'aspect', 'followers', 'lives', 'out', 'destroy', 'who', 'disagree', 'part', 'doomed', 'plot', 'kill', 'leader', 'David', 'Miscavige', 'probably', 'made', 'sure', 'security', 'was', 'trebled', 'next', 'time', 'Cruise', 'visited', 'compound.Valkyrie', 'one', 'films', 'disaster', 'many', 'were', 'hoping', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'never', 'quite', 'veering', 'side', 'too', 'steadily', 'course', 'retelling', 'failed', 'July', 'Plot', 'assassinate', 'Hitler', 'are', 'real', 'lows', 'are', 'also', 'sadly', 'precious', 'few', 'highs', 'film', 'retelling', 'events', 'efficiently', 'never', 'really', 'gripping', 'as', 'tightly', 'should', 'only', 'briefly', 'engaging', 'emotions', 'final', 'scenes', 'suspect', 'more', 'fate', 'real', 'people', 'involved', 'onscreen', 'noble', 'effort', 'hard', 'resist', 'comparing', 'failed', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'big', 'noise', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'target.Originally', 'intended', 'lower-budget', 'directorial', 'outing', 'co-writer', 'Christopher', 'McQuarrie', 'German', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Kretschman', 'who', 'fairly', 'thankless', 'supporting', 'role', 'consolation', 'certainly', 'big', 'improvement', 'eventual', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'ponderous', 'take', 'Superman', 'marshalling', 'impressive', 'resources', 'thanks', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'involvement', 'never', 'quite', 'epic', 'enormity', 'subject', 'first', 'half', 'less', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'pull', 'back', 'brink', 'destruction', 'series', 'measured', 'conversations', 'rooms', 'offices', 'flat', 'one-dimensional', 'characterisation', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'idealise', 'conspirators', 'one', 'unwilling', 'recruit', 'blackmailed', 'co-operating', 'tells', ""'re"", 'rats', 'deserting', 'sinking', 'ship', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'no', 'better', 'people', 'want', 'replace', 'only', 'when', 'plan', 'go', 'wrong', 'thanks', 'stalling', 'indecision', 'plain', 'bad', 'luck', 'film', 'take', 'hold', 'Multi-tasking', 'editor/composer/co-executive', 'producer', 'John', 'Ottman', 'score', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'more', 'help', 'times', 'only', 'really', 'own', 'end', 'worthy', 'effort', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'word', 'now', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Christian', 'Berkel', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'wasted', 'Cruise', 'wife', 'just', 'needed', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'forceful', 'direct', 'really', 'fulfil', 'promise.As', 'increasingly', 'common', 'DVD', 'edition', 'stints', 'extras', 'even', 'documentary', 'cutdown', 'version', 'one', 'included', 'BluRay']",Valkyrie

I'm sure most people know this movie is about the failed assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler.The acting was very good throughout. I actually enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance but he did not take the lead as strongly as he should have. He did what had to be done but he could have elevated this movie like he has done to others in the past. His role needed that maverick type attitude like he provided in Born On the Fourth of July. His non-German accent was not an issue it was the strength that he displayed in his performance that was disappointing to many. This movie was certainly a chance for him to build his career back up to a more serious level but he clearly did not impress too many people with his role as Stauffenburg to do that. Still, he was enjoyable to watch for me.The supporting cast though was great. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson were all pivotal in the success of this movie and they certainly filled in perfectly.The directing of Bryan Singer was superb. He provided an amazing amount of suspense to a movie that everyone knew the ending to. For a good half hour I was totally frozen watching as the plot unfold. I also thought the movie was paced very well and he brought the best out of the supporting cast. Of course it was shot very well with a great production throughout. The movie was written very nicely but as many people have said, it would have been great if there was more emotional depth added to the characters to make the audience feel more attached them.This movie certainly had a lot of potential but it stayed within the realm of mostly a suspense action movie. Valkryie reminded me of a WW2 movie from the 50s and 60s with its style and pacing.

1212551,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001KZIRKY,Turfseer,"[8, 30]","First off, I agree with those critics who found Tom Cruise utilizing an American accent while the other actors are all speaking in polished British accents, a big mistake. The film's verisimilitude is compromised quite a bit by Cruise's inability to convince us that he's truly Klaus von Stauffenberg, a sophisticated Army officer from an aristocratic German family.That said, Valkyrie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. It's basically a by-the-numbers recreation of the last plot to kill Hitler. While it lacks suspense (since the film's climax is a forgone conclusion) it does ably depict who the players were and how they concocted and carried out the failed assassination plot.Valkyrie fails in the area of character development. We never get to know any of these characters as multi-dimensional human beings. Director Bryan Singer chose to tell his story purely as an action-adventure movie. On the plus side, the movie looks like it was filmed at some of the actual locations especially the scenes shot at the ""Wolf's Lair"" which looked pretty realistic.The most objectionable aspect of 'Valkyrie' is elevating von Stauffenberg to hero status. While certainly he was courageous, he was no hero. Had Germany been winning the war, it's not likely there would have been as many assassination attempts as there were. I find it difficult to believe that most of the conspirators were primarily motivated by a moral imperative.Daniel Goldhagen, in his brilliant book ""Hitler's Willing Executioneers--Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust"", informs that von Stauffenberg's own brother admitted that in the sphere of internal politics, ""we had welcomed the basic tenets of National Socialism for the most part...The concept of race seemed sound and very promising."" Their objection was merely that its ""implementation was exaggerated and carried too far"". Stauffenberg's uncle, Count Uxkull, stated ""We should hold on to the concept of race as far as possible.""According to Goldhagen, one of the central documents of the resistance to Hitler, prepared at the beginning of 1943 by leading Protestant theologians and university professors, explicitly condemned genocide but still argued that Jews caused trouble for Germany, that a ""Jewish Problem"" existed, that the Jews had harmed Germany and that a ""solution"" was necessary that would prevent future harm to Germans.Valkyrie might have been better as a 'Made for TV' special. Instead of spending all that money about a minor footnote in the history of the Third Reich, wouldn't it have been better to focus on the complicity of the overwhelming majority of the German people who either enthusiastically embraced Hitler or looked the other way as he successfully carried out his nefarious plan of genocide and attempt at world domination?",2,Better off as a 'made-for-TV-movie' special,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,2786,"['First', 'agree', 'critics', 'who', 'found', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'utilizing', 'American', 'accent', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'speaking', 'polished', 'British', 'accents', 'big', 'mistake', 'film', 'verisimilitude', 'compromised', 'quite', 'bit', 'Cruise', 'inability', 'convince', 'truly', 'Klaus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'sophisticated', 'Army', 'officer', 'aristocratic', 'German', 'family.That', 'said', 'Valkyrie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'be', 'basically', 'by-the-numbers', 'recreation', 'last', 'plot', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'suspense', 'film', 'climax', 'forgone', 'conclusion', 'ably', 'depict', 'who', 'players', 'were', 'how', 'concocted', 'carried', 'failed', 'assassination', 'plot.Valkyrie', 'area', 'character', 'development', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'multi-dimensional', 'human', 'beings', 'Director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'chose', 'tell', 'story', 'purely', 'action-adventure', 'movie', 'plus', 'side', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'actual', 'locations', 'especially', 'scenes', 'shot', 'Wolf', 'Lair', 'looked', 'pretty', 'realistic.The', 'most', 'objectionable', 'aspect', ""'Valkyrie"", 'elevating', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'hero', 'status', 'certainly', 'was', 'courageous', 'was', 'hero', 'Had', 'Germany', 'been', 'winning', 'war', 'not', 'likely', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'were', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'most', 'conspirators', 'were', 'primarily', 'motivated', 'moral', 'imperative.Daniel', 'Goldhagen', 'brilliant', 'book', 'Hitler', 'Willing', 'Executioneers', 'Ordinary', 'Germans', 'Holocaust', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'own', 'brother', 'admitted', 'sphere', 'internal', 'politics', 'had', 'welcomed', 'basic', 'tenets', 'National', 'Socialism', 'most', 'part', 'concept', 'race', 'seemed', 'sound', 'very', 'promising', 'objection', 'was', 'merely', 'implementation', 'was', 'exaggerated', 'carried', 'too', 'far', 'Stauffenberg', 'uncle', 'Count', 'Uxkull', 'stated', 'should', 'hold', 'concept', 'race', 'as', 'far', 'possible', 'According', 'Goldhagen', 'one', 'central', 'documents', 'resistance', 'Hitler', 'prepared', 'beginning', '1943', 'leading', 'Protestant', 'theologians', 'university', 'professors', 'explicitly', 'condemned', 'genocide', 'still', 'argued', 'Jews', 'caused', 'trouble', 'Germany', 'Jewish', 'Problem', 'existed', 'Jews', 'had', 'harmed', 'Germany', 'solution', 'was', 'necessary', 'would', 'prevent', 'future', 'harm', 'Germans.Valkyrie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""'Made"", 'TV', 'special', 'Instead', 'spending', 'money', 'minor', 'footnote', 'history', 'Third', 'Reich', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'focus', 'complicity', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'German', 'people', 'who', 'either', 'enthusiastically', 'embraced', 'Hitler', 'looked', 'other', 'way', 'successfully', 'carried', 'out', 'nefarious', 'plan', 'genocide', 'attempt', 'world', 'domination']",Valkyrie
1212552,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001KZIRKY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 4]","Based upon actual historical events, VALKYRIE is a cinematic portrayal of the German Operation Valkyrie, a subversive plot against Hitler's Germany by a group of Nazi insiders.  Tom Cruise stars as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg.  Stauffenberg is a distinguished and decorated officer, but secretly hates Hitler.  After loosing an eye, a hand, and some fingers during combat operations in Tunisia, Stauffenberg is approached by the German Resistance.  They know of his dislike for Hitler's regime and believe that his new post places him in the perfect position for an intended coup.  Using ""Operation Valkyrie"", a contingency plan originally approved by Hitler that allowed the Ersatzheer (replacement army) to take control of the country if there was a internal breakup of the high command, as a blueprint Stauffenberg and the Resistance begin planning how to kill Hitler and take Germany back.Even though I enjoy history, I have to admit that before seeing VALKYRIE, I was unaware of ""Operation Valkyrie"".  I knew that there had been many assassination attempts on Hitler's life, but I did not know about the brave Stauffenberg, Valkyrie, and the almost successful coup of Hitler's Germany.  I thought the film did a good job of bringing the story to the screen in an interesting and exciting way.  If the only reason you haven't watched this movie is because you already know the outcome of the operation, please reconsider.  People flocked to TITANIC even though everyone knows the ship sunk, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID is a great movie even though we know the leads disappear and are probably killed in Bolivia, etc.  Sure we already know ahead of time that ""Operation Valkyrie"" fails, but that doesn't make VALKYRIE any less compelling.Acting-wise, VALKYRIE has some great performances.  Tom Cruise illustrates once again that he's a better actor than he would sometimes like the world to believe and seems perfect as lead man Stauffenberg.  However, VALKYRIE is really an ensemble picture and everyone else in the picture does a fine job, too.There are some who think it unusual that the characters speak in English with no German accents.  Personally, I found this refreshing.  I'm not sure where the idea originated that people of different countries have to speak in an English film with an accent reflecting their country of origin, but it's a convention that I'm glad isn't used in this movie.  I hope that future historical films such as this follow suit and we could get rid of bad accents in historical movies altogether.As far as historical accuracy goes, as I mentioned before, I didn't know much about ""Operation Valkyrie"" before seeing the movie. However, since then, I have done some research and it seems that VALKYRIE does an excellent job of sticking to historical truth.  There are some events, scenes, and dialogue that have been changed, edited, or extended for dramatic or pacing purposes, but the essence of the story is kept and many of the historical facts of the events are adhered to.  The props, set designs, and costumes are extremely accurate.  Also, it should be noted if for no other reason, VALKYRIE is a movie worth watching because its one of only a few films ever to be allowed to film on location at the Blenderblock in Berlin.I really enjoyed VALKYRIE.  I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I know he can be a pretty good actor.  I also enjoy watching historical pictures.  The film kept me engrossed and was so interesting that it led me to do some historical research afterwards.  With that said, there is quite a bit of dialogue in the movie.  In fact, much of what occurs between the opening scene and the final act of the movie is dialogue.  I didn't mind that so much, but there are some people who might find all that talking (but great dialogue and discussion) to be drab and boring.The regular edition DVD includes just the movie with only a few trailers as extras.  The special edition DVD is the one you probably want to buy as it includes two audio commentaries, a making-of featurette, a documentary from the History Channel entitled ""The Valkyrie Legacy"", and a digital copy of the film for your personal computer.",4,The German Coup That Almost Succeeded.,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",2009,4176,"['Based', 'actual', 'historical', 'events', 'VALKYRIE', 'cinematic', 'portrayal', 'German', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'subversive', 'plot', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'group', 'Nazi', 'insiders', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Colonel', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'Stauffenberg', 'distinguished', 'decorated', 'officer', 'secretly', 'Hitler', 'loosing', 'eye', 'hand', 'fingers', 'combat', 'operations', 'Tunisia', 'Stauffenberg', 'approached', 'German', 'Resistance', 'know', 'dislike', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'believe', 'new', 'post', 'places', 'perfect', 'position', 'intended', 'coup', 'Using', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'contingency', 'plan', 'originally', 'approved', 'Hitler', 'allowed', 'Ersatzheer', 'replacement', 'army', 'take', 'control', 'country', 'was', 'internal', 'breakup', 'high', 'command', 'blueprint', 'Stauffenberg', 'Resistance', 'begin', 'planning', 'how', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'take', 'Germany', 'back.Even', 'enjoy', 'history', 'have', 'admit', 'seeing', 'VALKYRIE', 'was', 'unaware', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'knew', 'had', 'been', 'many', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'Hitler', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'brave', 'Stauffenberg', 'Valkyrie', 'almost', 'successful', 'coup', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'thought', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'screen', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'way', 'only', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'operation', 'please', 'reconsider', 'People', 'flocked', 'TITANIC', 'even', 'everyone', 'ship', 'sunk', 'BUTCH', 'CASSIDY', 'THE', 'SUNDANCE', 'KID', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'know', 'leads', 'disappear', 'are', 'probably', 'killed', 'Bolivia', 'etc', 'Sure', 'already', 'know', 'ahead', 'time', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', ""n't"", 'make', 'VALKYRIE', 'less', 'compelling.Acting-wise', 'VALKYRIE', 'great', 'performances', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'once', 'again', 'better', 'actor', 'would', 'sometimes', 'world', 'believe', 'perfect', 'lead', 'man', 'Stauffenberg', 'However', 'VALKYRIE', 'really', 'ensemble', 'picture', 'everyone', 'else', 'picture', 'fine', 'job', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'unusual', 'characters', 'speak', 'English', 'German', 'accents', 'Personally', 'found', 'refreshing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'idea', 'originated', 'people', 'different', 'countries', 'have', 'speak', 'English', 'film', 'accent', 'reflecting', 'country', 'origin', 'convention', ""'m"", 'glad', ""n't"", 'used', 'movie', 'hope', 'future', 'historical', 'films', 'such', 'follow', 'suit', 'could', 'get', 'rid', 'bad', 'accents', 'historical', 'movies', 'altogether.As', 'far', 'as', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'mentioned', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'seeing', 'movie', 'However', 'then', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'VALKYRIE', 'excellent', 'job', 'sticking', 'historical', 'truth', 'are', 'events', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'edited', 'extended', 'dramatic', 'pacing', 'purposes', 'essence', 'story', 'kept', 'many', 'historical', 'facts', 'events', 'are', 'adhered', 'props', 'set', 'designs', 'costumes', 'are', 'extremely', 'accurate', 'Also', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'other', 'reason', 'VALKYRIE', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'only', 'few', 'films', 'ever', 'be', 'allowed', 'film', 'location', 'Blenderblock', 'Berlin.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'VALKYRIE', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'also', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'historical', 'pictures', 'film', 'kept', 'engrossed', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'led', 'do', 'historical', 'research', 'afterwards', 'said', 'quite', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'fact', 'much', 'what', 'opening', 'scene', 'final', 'act', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'find', 'talking', 'great', 'dialogue', 'discussion', 'be', 'drab', 'boring.The', 'regular', 'edition', 'DVD', 'just', 'movie', 'only', 'few', 'trailers', 'extras', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'one', 'probably', 'want', 'buy', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'documentary', 'History', 'Channel', 'entitled', 'Valkyrie', 'Legacy', 'digital', 'copy', 'film', 'personal', 'computer']",Valkyrie

Still, there are so many chapters of history that were overshadowed by the 'main event' that they are lost. Film has really given these lost stories a chance to resurface and be shown to the movie going public. Valkyrie is one of those stories.World War II is one of the most talked about periods of history, but this film shows the story within. During the reign of Hitler in Nazi Germany no one would ever have guessed there were actually high Nazi officials with a heart who knew that what was happening was evil. Led by a decorated soldier who escaped death, these officers fearing their own demise carefully craft a plan to take out the furer and stop what they already knew would be a losing battle.I felt that the movie was good for what it was. Bryan Singer tried to tell a story of consipiracy and good will with a good cast backing it up. I am not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise, but I was pretty impressed by the origionallity of his performance. The story moves pretty slow in the begining, but normally stories such as these will.

1212555,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B001KZIRKY,V. Berk,"[244, 274]","9/10 StarsForget all the negative hype surrounding Valkyrie, because I assure you it is false. Bryan Singer has made a well-crafted thriller that kept me and my family on the edge of our seats until the end - even though we all know what the story's unfortunate outcome. Also, many tabloids were making this out to be the movie that would permanently cripple the career of Tom Cruise. This is entirely false. Cruise delivers a fine performance, and this hatred I can only assume is related to his rather odd personal life. Tom Cruise is as strong of an actor as he ever was, and I won't let something like turning Oprah's couch into a playground deny the fact that the man has talent, and is a truly passionate actor (and seriously, he does have a slight resemblance to Stauffenberg).The movie is based on the last of fifteen known attempts on the life of German dictator Adolf Hitler (I'm sure everyone will have him in a nice ""Five Most Evil People"" list), and has Tom Cruise playing Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who of course was the key player in the assassination attempt. Ultimately this attempt failed (as we all know Hitler would die by suicide nine months later), but that doesn't keep Valkyrie from being an addictively engaging film.Every member of the cast does their part well, not jockeying for superiority in any way. More importantly Cruise does not grandstand in this movie, fading in with the rest of the cast, rather than trying to stand above them like you'd expect, given his past films. Cruise gives a performance similar to 2005's War of the Worlds, where he does a good performance, but he never tries to overpower the other members of the cast. In Valkyrie Tom Cruise is a being a good team player, not trying to steal any glory, and never once does he overact the part.Using very little CGI Valkyrie is also a wonderful film to look at. The vintage automobiles and aircrafts make this film have a distinct authentic flair that few other war films have (CGI looks like it was only used for the climatic assassination attempt). You can look at this and tell that this is the real deal, with the production team putting careful care into how they want this film to look, unlike most Blockbuster films that try and inflate every aspect of the film rather than aim for reality. Like the performance by Tom Cruise they don't try and overpower the audience with special effects, they simply let the characters slip into the realistic settings.Also, the complaints about the accents I truly feel are desperate attempts to bash Cruise's performance. It was director Bryan Singer's concept to not use false German accents, and not that of Cruise, or the primarily British cast. I agree with Singer's concept that if feels false, and inaccurate to have people speak in English, but with foreign accents. I know several Germans in real life, and they do not sound very ""German"" when they speak in English, because the accent is not intended for the English language. I personally feel the desire for English being spoken in German accents comes from decades of WWII films where we've categorized every-single member of the German army, and by them speaking in that accent only is to clich&eacute; them and separate them from American audiences. They can speak in German accents, but only if they're speaking in German, because if they aren't it seems to be a tool to keep your common American moviegoer from relating to the characters.Don't go into Valkyrie expecting to be greeted with a horrifically bad film that you will be able to poke fun at with friends. The movie has been released, and I feel the rumors, and negative hype of been proven decisively false. This isn't a movie to kill Cruise's career, but it won't help him regain love in the American community either (as previously mentioned he doesn't shine so much as mix in with the rest of the cast). It is a very enjoyable dramatization of a true event, and I don't think the material could have been handled much better, even with a full German cast, because Singer's style and method of conveying this story are all very well-done.Go out and enjoy this dramatization of one of the darkest periods of human history.

They hatch a daring plan to set off explosives during a briefing.  The main man in all of this is Col. Stauffenberg, played ably by Tom Cruise.

1212558,A1C80B497LCYKA,B001KZIRKY,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[12, 17]","Valkyrie, the latest Tom Cruise actioner, is an almost perfect political thriller. It is about the 1944 nearly successful attempt to assassinate Hitler toward the end of WWII, which Cruise's character, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, heads up. It's been awhile since I've seen such impeccable sets and costumes, heard such a pounding score, enjoyed such a stellar cast, and witnessed such excellent filmmaking, not to mention the really good, nail-biting story. Although we all know the outcome - Hitler survives, only to commit suicide nine months later - it will still have you on the edge of your seat. For those unfamiliar with the name, Valkyrie is a Wagnerian opera after which Hitler named his secret operation for protecting Germany and her occupied territories in the event something happened to him. (Even in death he was a control freak.)If you like military films, this one is top-notch, with some terrific reproductions of German aircraft. The story opens with von Stauffenberg stationed in North Africa with the Afrikakorps, reflecting in his journal how he'd like to do something about Hitler. (Not a safe thing for a German officer to write in his journal, but it says volumes about who von Stauffenberg was.) When his unit is attacked by Allied planes, von Stauffenberg ends up in a military hospital missing one hand, two fingers and an eye. From there he is moved to Berlin, where he is recruited by a ring of conspirators out to assassinate Hitler and establish a new government.It doesn't take long for the Colonel to take over the operation: he's a strong leader, exuding active commitment, integrity, moral courage and - if I may extrapolate - faith. How he manages to get into the confidence of Hitler and almost pull off the greatest coups in history is remarkable. Through this film, we get a very authentic view of what those who opposed Hitler were doing behind the scenes in Nazi Germany in 1944. Interestingly, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was the spiritual leader for this group, though, regretfully, he does not appear as one of the characters.Every aspect of this production is superb, including the special effects and action sequences, and particularly the explosion designed to kill Hitler in his secret headquarters, known as Wolf's Lair. The performances are top-drawer. Besides Cruise, who never seems to age and for whom this is the perfect vehicle, I was especially impressed with Bill Nighy (Pirates Of The Caribbean), who plays General Friedrich Olbricht, the main officer in cahoots with von Stauffenberg; Tom Wilkinson (Batman Begins), who plays General Friedrich Fromm, the officer in charge of initiating Valkyrie; Dutch actress Carice van Houten as von Stauffenberg's wife, Nina; and German actor Thomas Kretschmann (Eichmann, King Kong) as Major Otto Ernst Remer, the officer in charge of carrying out Valkyrie.I wasn't especially taken by Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Major-General Henning von Tresckow, von Stauffenberg's predecessor in the assassination plot, even though Branagh gets second billing to Cruise. Nor did I like David Bamber's version of Adolf Hitler (a difficult character to play) - he seems too old, weak and vulnerable to be the leader of the Third Reich. Historians will have to decide if that was accurate. On the other hand, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard and Kevin McNally render their characters well as fellow conspirators.Just a word about three common criticisms of the film that I have heard. The first is that Valkyrie doesn't deal with the Holocaust. That's because it wasn't about the Holocaust - a myopic criticism. The second is that the actors didn't use German accents. That's because everyone in the film is German. German's don't have accents to each other. The only reason for using accents in a film is when there are other nationalities involved, and you're wanting to differentiate between them - an idiotic criticism. The third is that Cruise wasn't a good choice for von Stauffenberg. Actually, he was the perfect choice. Not only does he look exactly like von Stauffenberg, he probably has his personality. If all Cruise had done was play Cruise, he would have been perfect - a prejudiced criticism. All of these criticisms are unfounded.This film is way, way overdue. We haven't seen nearly enough about the courage of the German people who tried to resist Hitler. I hope there will be many more to follow. Although I didn't count on Hollywood to do the right thing at Oscar time - they didn't - Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns) deserved to be nominated for Best Director; Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander deserved the nomination for Best Screenplay; and all the production crew needed to be recognized for their outstanding work. Valkyrie is that good. But if you don't like war films or political thrillers, don't waste your time. This is filmmaking the old fashioned way, with story and acting taking center stage. They don't make them like this very often, so please don't miss this outstanding film.Waitsel Smith",5,CRUISE & TOP-DRAWER CAST IN TOP-NOTCH THRILLER,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,5019,"['Valkyrie',

1212559,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B001KZIRKY,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 3]","With all the bad word of mouth associated with ""Valkyrie"" as a backlash against Tom Cruise, I thought this film which focuses on the attempts against Hitler's life by members of the German military and politicians/intellectuals would be bad. Instead, I was surprised to find a solid thriller that manages to be suspenseful for most of its running time even though we know the outcome of the attempts on Hitler.Although I still find Cruise personally annoying, he gives a very good performance in ""Valkyrie"". Cruise plays Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg who after being wounded in Africa returns to Germany and is recruited by a team of military leaders (Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson) to try and kill the Fuhrer. A sharp man Stauffenberg recognizes the short comings of their plan to assassinate Hitler and in a bit of irony adapts one of Hitler's own plans to stabilize the German government should anything happen to him--Operation Valkyrie to help the conspirators take control of the German government and seek peace with the Allies. Stauffenberg recognizes that assassinating the Fuhrer may be a one-way trip so he plans an exit strategy of his own to help increase the odds he will come back alive and to his family after the Fuhrer is dead.""Valkyrie"" looks extremely good in its Blu-ray (and no doubt DVD)debut. The film has a grainy quality which was intentional.The special features include a terrific documentary made by Ken Burns that aired on Public Television as a tie-in to the movie about the real events that we see dramatized in the movie. It gives us a sense of how Hitler dominated Germany and the endless stream of propaganda the Nazi's used to help ""sell"" the German people on the evil of Jews and anybody that wasn't a true ""German"". It also focuses on the aftermath of the failure of Valkyrie.We also get a number of featurettes on the production of the film as well as two commentary tracks one featuring director Bryan Singer, Cruise and writer Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie and his co-writer Nathan Alexander appear on a second commentary track. Both are quite informative and entertaining focusing on different elements from pre-production, shooting and post-production of the film.""Valkyrie"" is a surprisingly good suspense thriller and well worth watching.3 1/2 stars",4,Extremely good thriller that was overlooked in theaters gets second chance,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,2329,"['bad', 'word', 'mouth', 'associated', 'Valkyrie', 'backlash', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'thought', 'film', 'attempts', 'Hitler', 'life', 'members', 'German', 'military', 'politicians/intellectuals', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'Instead', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'solid', 'thriller', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'even', 'know', 'outcome', 'attempts', 'Hitler.Although', 'still', 'find', 'Cruise', 'personally', 'annoying', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Valkyrie', 'Cruise', 'Colonel', 'Claus', 'Von', 'Stauffenberg', 'who', 'being', 'wounded', 'Africa', 'returns', 'Germany', 'recruited', 'team', 'military', 'leaders', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'try', 'kill', 'Fuhrer', 'A', 'sharp', 'man', 'Stauffenberg', 'short', 'comings', 'plan', 'assassinate', 'Hitler', 'bit', 'irony', 'adapts', 'one', 'Hitler', 'own', 'plans', 'stabilize', 'German', 'government', 'should', 'anything', 'happen', 'Operation', 'Valkyrie', 'help', 'conspirators', 'take', 'control', 'German', 'government', 'seek', 'peace', 'Allies', 'Stauffenberg', 'assassinating', 'Fuhrer', 'may', 'be', 'one-way', 'trip', 'exit', 'strategy', 'own', 'help', 'increase', 'odds', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'alive', 'family', 'Fuhrer', 'dead', 'Valkyrie', 'extremely', 'good', 'Blu-ray', 'doubt', 'DVD', 'debut', 'film', 'grainy', 'quality', 'was', 'intentional.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'terrific', 'documentary', 'made', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'aired', 'Public', 'Television', 'tie-in', 'movie', 'real', 'events', 'see', 'dramatized', 'movie', 'sense', 'how', 'Hitler', 'dominated', 'Germany', 'endless', 'stream', 'propaganda', 'Nazi', 'used', 'help', 'sell', 'German', 'people', 'evil', 'Jews', 'anybody', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'German', 'also', 'aftermath', 'failure', 'Valkyrie.We', 'also', 'get', 'number', 'featurettes', 'production', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'featuring', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Cruise', 'writer', 'Christopher', 'McQuarrie', 'McQuarrie', 'co-writer', 'Nathan', 'Alexander', 'appear', 'second', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'quite', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'focusing', 'different', 'elements', 'pre-production', 'shooting', 'post-production', 'film', 'Valkyrie', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.3', '1/2', 'stars']",Valkyrie

1212566,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001KZIRKY,Z Hayes,"[3, 4]","I admit I was initially put off watching this movie by all the negative critics' reviews, but I'm a fan of WW II dramas, especially those focused on Nazi Germany and the Holocaust and could not resist watching this when it was released on DVD.To my surprise, I truly enjoyed the movie and found it was a historically accurate portrayal of the actual events to do with the 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Tom Cruise is credible in his role as Col. Claus von Stauffenberg whose deep-seated disgust at the Fuhrer's leadership and the atrocities perpetrated by the SS has him resolved to put an end to the Fuhrer's reign of terror. Much has been said about Cruise's use of an American accent throughout this film. Admittedly, it is jarring to hear Cruise speak with an American accent whilst portraying a German officer, and this appears even more awkward when his co-stars speak in British accents. That being said, I think this has more to do with viewers expectations - we are used to hearing German accents used in wartime movies, and ""Valkyrie"" sort of bucks that trend. However, as some reviewers have noted, not all Germans speak English with a pronounced German accent.Accent concerns aside, I thought the movie was well-paced without sacrificing attention to period details or historical facts. The movie depicts events as it happened in real life, and the director, Bryan Singer needs to be commended for that. All the main characters played their roles convincingly, i.e. Tom Cruise as Stauffenberg, Bill Nighy as General Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as General Fromm, Terence Stamp as Ludwig Beck, Kenneth Branagh as Major General Henning von Tresckow etc. It's a star-studded cast and yet the other appealing aspect of this movie is that there wasn't one actor dominating the movie. Cruise shares the spotlight with the other major players, a refreshing change from some other Cruise-dominated movies.This is not an action flick in the traditional sense - there's no real action [unless you count mass mobilization of German troops as action] per se, but what keeps viewers on the edge of their seats is the suspense [even when one is privy to what eventually happens] that is maintained throughout.Final verdict: ""Valkyrie"" will appeal to those who appreciate WW II dramas that focus more on character development and storyline than pure action.",4,Compelling retelling of the Valkyrie plot,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,2357,"['admit', 'was', 'initially', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'movie', 'negative', 'critics', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'fan', 'WW', 'II', 'dramas', 'especially', 'focused', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Holocaust', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD.To', 'surprise', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'found', 'was', 'historically', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'actual', 'events', 'do', '1944', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'credible', 'role', 'Col.', 'Claus', 'von', 'Stauffenberg', 'deep-seated', 'disgust', 'Fuhrer', 'leadership', 'atrocities', 'perpetrated', 'SS', 'resolved', 'put', 'end', 'Fuhrer', 'reign', 'terror', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Cruise', 'use', 'American', 'accent', 'film', 'Admittedly', 'jarring', 'hear', 'Cruise', 'speak', 'American', 'accent', 'whilst', 'portraying', 'German', 'officer', 'even', 'more', 'awkward', 'when', 'co-stars', 'speak', 'British', 'accents', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'more', 'do', 'viewers', 'expectations', 'are', 'used', 'hearing', 'German', 'accents', 'used', 'wartime', 'movies', 'Valkyrie', 'sort', 'bucks', 'trend', 'However', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'not', 'Germans', 'speak', 'English', 'pronounced', 'German', 'accent.Accent', 'concerns', 'aside', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'well-paced', 'sacrificing', 'attention', 'period', 'details', 'historical', 'facts', 'movie', 'events', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'director', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'be', 'commended', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'roles', 'convincingly', 'i.e', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Stauffenberg', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'General', 'Olbricht', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'General', 'Fromm', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Ludwig', 'Beck', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Major', 'General', 'Henning', 'von', 'Tresckow', 'etc', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'yet', 'other', 'appealing', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'actor', 'dominating', 'movie', 'Cruise', 'shares', 'spotlight', 'other', 'major', 'players', 'refreshing', 'change', 'other', 'Cruise-dominated', 'movies.This', 'not', 'action', 'flick', 'traditional', 'sense', 'real', 'action', '[', 'count', 'mass', 'mobilization', 'German', 'troops', 'action', ']', 'se', 'what', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats', 'suspense', '[', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'privy', 'what', 'eventually', ']', 'maintained', 'throughout.Final', 'verdict', 'Valkyrie', 'will', 'appeal', 'who', 'appreciate', 'WW', 'II', 'dramas', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'storyline', 'pure', 'action']",Valkyrie
