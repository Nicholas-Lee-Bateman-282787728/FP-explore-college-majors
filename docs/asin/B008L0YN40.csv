Williams,"[0, 1]","I have a number of nature videos produced by the BBC Earth people and they are superb blu-ray, such as planet earth, etc. but I'm not sure this is blu-ray quality -- at least it doesn't compare in sharpness to the BBC Earth ones that we love. The topics and footage is good and somewhat enjoyable, but the benchmark has been set high by the BBC Earth folks! I have a blu-ray DVD by them on Yellowstone that IS my # 1 favorite nature DVD of all time.
