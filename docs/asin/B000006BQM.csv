493481,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000006BQM,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[4, 7]","Using Ernest Hemingway's story of a writer in Africa, as well some of his other fictional themes blended in, this is a wordy but occasionally poetic tale of a man with a severe leg wound, reminiscing about his travels and the women in his life, as he lies close to death at the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro, with his latest love by his side.As the ambitious, hard-drinking, hard-living writer (some will say elements of the story are like Hemingway's life), Gregory Peck puts in a good performance, though of all his great films, this one would be near the bottom, perhaps because the part of Harry Street is never particularly likable or heroic, but is of a rather self-centered man with a talent for words but little insight into life, and essentially a boring man, despite his many adventures.The women in his life are all beauties and played by Susan Hayward, Ava Gardner (excellent as ""Cynthia"") and Hildegard Knef, and Leo G. Carroll plays ""Uncle Bill"".Directed by Henry King with a score by Bernard Hermann, perhaps the best thing in the film is the cinematography by Leon Shamroy, especially the bullfight scene, which is superbly filmed (animal rights people will not like this film because of that scene, as well as the typical Hemingway safari sections).The film takes place in Africa, as well as France and Spain, where Harry Street joins the Civil War, and finally back to Africa for the purpose of ""working the fat off his soul"".The film received two Oscar nominations: Best Color Cinematography (losing to Archie Stout's work for ""The Quiet Man"") and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration (""Moulin Rouge"").Suggested for serious Peck fans only, total playing time is 117 minutes.",3,reminiscing with Harry,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1684,"['Using', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'story', 'writer', 'Africa', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'fictional', 'themes', 'blended', 'wordy', 'occasionally', 'poetic', 'tale', 'man', 'severe', 'leg', 'wound', 'reminiscing', 'travels', 'women', 'life', 'close', 'death', 'foot', 'Mt', 'Kilimanjaro', 'latest', 'love', 'side.As', 'ambitious', 'hard-drinking', 'hard-living', 'writer', 'will', 'say', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'Hemingway', 'life', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'good', 'performance', 'great', 'films', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'bottom', 'perhaps', 'part', 'Harry', 'Street', 'never', 'particularly', 'likable', 'heroic', 'rather', 'self-centered', 'man', 'talent', 'words', 'little', 'insight', 'life', 'essentially', 'boring', 'man', 'many', 'adventures.The', 'women', 'life', 'are', 'beauties', 'played', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'excellent', 'Cynthia', 'Hildegard', 'Knef', 'Leo', 'G.', 'Carroll', 'Uncle', 'Bill', '.Directed', 'Henry', 'King', 'score', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'cinematography', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'especially', 'bullfight', 'scene', 'superbly', 'filmed', 'animal', 'rights', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'film', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'typical', 'Hemingway', 'safari', 'sections', '.The', 'film', 'place', 'Africa', 'as', 'well', 'France', 'Spain', 'where', 'Harry', 'Street', 'Civil', 'War', 'finally', 'back', 'Africa', 'purpose', 'working', 'fat', 'soul', '.The', 'film', 'received', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Color', 'Cinematography', 'losing', 'Archie', 'Stout', 'work', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction/Set', 'Decoration', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', '.Suggested', 'serious', 'Peck', 'fans', 'only', 'total', 'playing', 'time', '117', 'minutes']",Snows of Kilimanjaro VHS

Harry, the writer, thinks he's dying from an untreated infected leg in Kenya where he and wife have been on a safari canoeing down a murky river.  He had jumped in to rescue another of the group and he ends up needing rescuing himself.  While waiting for the plane, he relives the important events in his life through flashbacks.  We see him as a young man full of life, in love with beautiful women -- along the way, marrying three of them.  He is most attractive, but hard to live with, it seems.He didn't have any problem getting a wife but couldn't find a lasting relationship.  His first wife declared that ""God would punish me"" for wanting to be happy too much.  None of the wives appeared especially happy even at the dances and parties.  This wouldn't be Hemingway without a bullfight in Spain.  It was quite a sight.  The flamengo dancer was fantastic and the Spanish guitar sounded like Segovia in Madrid.The Spanish Civil War interrrupts his literary and love life.

493485,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000006BQM,Byron Kolln,"[5, 6]","THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO was producer Darryl F. Zanuck's prestige production for 1952.  Based around several of Ernest Hemingway's stories, it gave Gregory Peck the chance to play one of his most intriguing roles and also showcased Ava Gardner in one of her best performances.Acclaimed author Harry Street (Gregory Peck) lies severely wounded and dazed on the African plains with his patient wife Helen (Susan Hayward), awaiting a rescue flight.  Floating in and out of conciousness, he recalls his early life and the women who shared it with him.  Themes of fate and thwarted love are constant in Hemingway's works; in THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO, those themes are explored with an almost poetic reverence.Ava Gardner plays Harry's steadfast but ultimately doomed first love Cynthia Green; Hildegard Neff is his grasping, possessive mistress, the Countess Liz.  Susan Hayward provides a wonderful gravity as his eventual wife Helen.  Gregory Peck plays Harry in the great tradition of his deeply-flawed heroes.Despite it's success with audiences and critics (plus two Academy Award nominations), Ernest Hemingway disliked the movie because he felt it poached from too many of his collective works to pad out the story, most notably ""Fiesta"" and ""A Farewell to Arms"".Previously only available in horrid Public Domain prints, THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO is now thankfully back in the catalogue with a legitimate studio release from Fox.

493487,AOV2RGDDURFA4,B000006BQM,David Kaminsky,"[13, 15]","Ernest Hemingway hated this adaptation of his work, and disparagingly referred to it as ""The Snows of Zanuck."" I think he was overestimating his own writing, and I think the film is no worse than the work upon which it was based. Methinks he doth protest too much. Hemingway was heard to grumble: ""I sold Zanuck one short story, not my whole body of works."" The Casey Robinson screenplay is witty and honest, with the right blend of cynicism and naivetee. Gregory Peck is a gruff, grumbly, handsome-as-a-devil Hemingway ""hero,"" and Ava Gardner makes a memorable, heartbreakingly beautiful Cynthia. Susan Hayward makes the best of the film's most thankless role (she looks great in a pith helmut, too). The layers of flashbacks perfectly convey the sense of a man reevaluating his past as he faces imminent death. Much has been made of the ending, and the way it deviates from the original story. I don't see the sunny Hollywood ending purists have denounced, since we really don't know the status of the dying writer as the helicopter arrives. The soundtrack is a bit loopy and out-of-synch in places, and the special effects (especially the river crossing) look pretty bad by today's standards, but the acting adds a depth and humanity which is missing from Hemingway's original work. A fun piece of escapist safaridrama along the lines of the superior ""King Solomon's Mines"" or ""Mogambo.""",3,An interesting Hemingway adaptation,1053648000,"05 23, 2003",2003,1390,"['Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'hated', 'adaptation', 'work', 'disparagingly', 'referred', 'Snows', 'Zanuck', 'think', 'was', 'overestimating', 'own', 'writing', 'think', 'film', 'worse', 'work', 'was', 'based', 'Methinks', 'protest', 'too', 'much', 'Hemingway', 'was', 'heard', 'grumble', 'sold', 'Zanuck', 'one', 'short', 'story', 'not', 'whole', 'body', 'works', 'Casey', 'Robinson', 'screenplay', 'witty', 'honest', 'right', 'blend', 'cynicism', 'naivetee', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'gruff', 'grumbly', 'handsome-as-a-devil', 'Hemingway', 'hero', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'memorable', 'heartbreakingly', 'beautiful', 'Cynthia', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'best', 'film', 'most', 'thankless', 'role', 'great', 'pith', 'helmut', 'too', 'layers', 'flashbacks', 'perfectly', 'convey', 'sense', 'man', 'reevaluating', 'past', 'imminent', 'death', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'ending', 'way', 'original', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'sunny', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'purists', 'have', 'denounced', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'status', 'dying', 'writer', 'helicopter', 'soundtrack', 'bit', 'loopy', 'out-of-synch', 'places', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'river', 'crossing', 'look', 'pretty', 'bad', 'today', 'standards', 'acting', 'depth', 'humanity', 'missing', 'Hemingway', 'original', 'work', 'fun', 'piece', 'escapist', 'safaridrama', 'lines', 'superior', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Mines', 'Mogambo']",Snows of Kilimanjaro VHS

I found the cinematography to be a strong point because of the location shots. There's something captivating about the old style location scenes in Africa, France, and Spain.Hemmingway was ripped by some of the other reviewers for bad writing, however I think he achieves some of his goal of having the audience reflect on the struggle between personal ambition and fulfillment and the sacrifice of loving someone else. One flaw is that the husband and wife can't agree on the cause of his accident. That just isn't pausible. There's also a miscommunication between the couple over Harry Street's ambition and his wife's desire for a child.

493489,A7SZ6PY7YNCMC,B000006BQM,Film Buff Chris,"[0, 0]","I was surprised by the negative reviews of this.  As a baby boomer, I saw this 1952 movie, loosely based on Hemingway, when I was 13 and watching Saturday Night at the Movies -- which played 50s Fox movies on prime time when I was young.  This was the top grossing movie of 1952!Gregory Peck is in Africa with his latest wife (the vibrant Susan Hayward), and he's possibly dying from an injury he received from a hippo.  (Vultures are gathering, waiting for him.)  As he keeps slipping in and out of consciousness, he remembers the women in his life.First and foremost is Cynthia, played by Ava Gardner in one of her best performances (along with excellent work in ""Mogambo,"" ""Bhawanhi Junction,"" and ""Night of the Iguana"").  The poster/reviewer who called her ""vapid"" is unfair, or just doesn't respond to her.Peck and Gardner meet in a smoky Paris club, fall in love, and he drags her off to bull fights and safaris in Africa, both of which she hates.  Gardner is glamorous and distinctive, and is very sympathetic and convincing as her relationship with Peck starts to unravel.She doesn't tell him when she gets pregnant -- which triggers a pointed but funny line from a doctor: after Peck says ""what baby?"", the doctor says: ""don't you two people talk to one another?""  She starts to drink and disappears.Peck then hooks up with a wealthy contessa - the intriguing Hildegarde Neff, a German actress with a sexy, throaty voice; and the contessa, in an upsetting scene, keeps Peck from getting a message from the missing Cynthia.  Finally, Peck meets Susan Hayward,who's emotionally ""healthier"" than Gardner, and who in Africa almost WILLS Peck to continue living.  Hayward's acting style is hard-hitting and on the nose -- but the notes she hits are genuine.  I like her.  I enjoy this film, especially the three actresses.I have an older, cheaper dvd -- not great, but acceptable.  The person whose dvd keeps starting over is clearly dealing with a damaged dvd, and should have sent it back for another copy.

Producer, Daryl Zanuck, Director Henry King and writer, Casey Robinson, have taken this short story and developed it in to an outstanding two hour epic...one of the best adaptations of Hemingway's works in my opinion. There were a couple of significant parts of the screenplay that varied from the short story...the character, Cynthia, played by Ava Gardner, was added to the movie adaptation; and the ending is different. Hemingway, while accepting his fees and royalties, disagreed with the changes and never watched the film. Gregory peck was the perfect choice for Harry Green, the writer/adventurer, who while on safari in Africa with his wife, Helen (Susan Hayward) injures his leg, and appears to be dying of a gangrenous infection. While laying on a cot, he reflects back over his life and the film story is told in flashback. The flashbacks are mostly about Greens failed and successful romances with Cynthia (Gardner); Helen (Hayward) and Countess Elizabeth (Hildegard Knef). All three actresses deliver fine performances and perfectly complement Peck's performance as Harry Green.

493506,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B000006BQM,Utah Blaine,"[5, 6]","This film can only be characterized as a huge disappointment.  A great cast, a screenplay based on the works (and life) of a great author, a dangerous, romantic setting, and this film simply doesn't go anywhere at the end.  This film opens with the main character Harry Street (played by Gregory Peck) lying in bed at a safari camp in Africa, wounded, perhaps mortally, and being attended by his lover, Helen (played by Susan Hayward).  We are then taken back to Peck's earlier life as a young, talented writer (much like Hemingway himself) through a series of flashbacks.  We see the ups and downs of his life, his loves, and his mistakes.  We are occasionally taken back to Africa where Street reflects on his life, the women that he loved, and the relationship with his current love.  This is a tale of adventure, of life, of love, and of reflection, it could have been an all time great film, but unfortunately falls well short.  There is a lot to like in this film.  The acting is, for the most part, top notch.  Great performances by Susan Wayward and Ava Gardner in my view.  The complex relationship between Peck and Gardner is particularly well done.  You'll really feel the emotions of their love affair, as well as their ultimate lack of any real connection.  I also thought that the overall portrayal of Street's life and his successes and failures, both professional and romantic, was well done.  There are some things I really dislike about this film though.  The cinematography in Africa is horrid.  One thing that the audience can usually count on in films set in Africa (particularly with a safari-related theme - compare with other Africa films shot in the same era such as Mogambo or King Solomon's Mines) is spectacular cinemtography of the wildlife, the landscape, etc.  These scenes are so dark and poorly shot that you'll be left wondering why you bothered.  Second, the writer/producer/director went over the top with the melodrama at times, and it really weakens the overall effect of the film.  I found the ambulance scene in Spain in which Harry Street comes across his long lost love in the middle of a battle to be almost laughably overblown.  Finally, the ending is unimaginative and anti-climactic.  Did Street truly find the women he loves because she spent one night taking care of him on what may be his deathbead?
