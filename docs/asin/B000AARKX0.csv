Taylor ""Wyld Weasil""","[20, 29]","I'll be the first to admit, I saw ""Jay and Silent Bob"" and bought the disc, however I didn't really know much about Degrassi the next generation. But it's OK, because the disc is pretty self explanitory when it comes to stories from other episodes that were carried over. One thing You'll have to keep in mind is that this was just a guest spot by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith on 3 episodes, the episodes were about Kevin Smith wanting to shoot his new Jay and Silent bob movie there(in Canada). One thing i didn't like was how Kevin kept throwing in anti Bush jabs into the show. I'm not a Bush supporter, but Bush bashing really had no place in this show.As for the show(s), they were very entertaining. I could definetly see getting into this show on a regular basis, even if it was a little Cheezey.",4,Unfamiliar with Degrassi,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,802,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'saw', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'bought', 'disc', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'Degrassi', 'next', 'generation', 'OK', 'disc', 'pretty', 'self', 'explanitory', 'when', 'stories', 'other', 'episodes', 'were', 'carried', 'One', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'just', 'guest', 'spot', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Kevin', 'Smith', '3', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'were', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'wanting', 'shoot', 'new', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'bob', 'movie', 'there', 'Canada', 'One', 'thing', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'how', 'Kevin', 'kept', 'throwing', 'anti', 'Bush', 'jabs', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'Bush', 'supporter', 'Bush', 'bashing', 'really', 'had', 'place', 'show.As', 'show', 'were', 'very', 'entertaining', 'could', 'definetly', 'see', 'getting', 'show', 'regular', 'basis', 'even', 'was', 'little', 'Cheezey']",N/A

925693,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000AARKX0,Dorrie Wheeler,"[44, 56]","Okay, I am writing this rare review in anticipation of a release because some of the other reviews are a bit off target.  Jay and Silent Bob do Degrassi is a 3 episode arc of Degrassi-The Next Generation.  These 3 episodes are the last episodes of the shows 4th season.  Kevin Smith descends upon Degrassi to film a movie, ""Jay and Silent Bob Do Degrassi.""  Although, the Kevin Smith storyline is prevalent, the main Degrassi storyline continues.  The first episode of the arc primarily focuses on Paige being a spoiled brat as usual.  She doesn't want to give Manny any credit for her role in the spirit squad and the two go back and forth.  Craig speaks to a member of Kevin Smiths production about writing a song for the movie.  Happy, Craig and Ashley get to work.  Their songs are panned and Ashley decides to move to Europe, she was already planning the Europe trip but the songs being panned is the dealmaker. The second episode of the arc is mainly more Craig and Ashley.  Craig and Caitlin (the object of Kevin Smiths crush), discuss Craig going to Europe. Joey Jermiah (Craig's Stepdad) gives in to Craig's plan but when Ashley is less than happy when Craig announces his plans to join her, he goes off the deep end.  Production wise these episodes aired as ""West End Girls,"" and ""Going Down The Road part 1 &2.""  FUNIMATION offers awesome releases of Degrassi DVD's and the Jay and Silent Bob set is being released in a regular and an unrated version.  The third episode of the arc features a lot more Kevin Smith as he and Caitlin grow closer.  Since the DVD's haven't been released I don't have a ton of specs but upon release I will revise review.  I think this will be a great purchase, especially for fans of Degrassi The Next Generation.  The season sets are still on season 2 and this will give us a chance to own a piece of Season 4.",5,Advance information about Jay & Silent Bob Do Degrassi,1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,1852,"['Okay', 'am', 'writing', 'rare', 'review', 'anticipation', 'release', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'bit', 'off', 'target', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'do', 'Degrassi', '3', 'episode', 'arc', 'Degrassi-The', 'Next', 'Generation', '3', 'episodes', 'are', 'last', 'episodes', 'shows', '4th', 'season', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'upon', 'Degrassi', 'film', 'movie', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'Do', 'Degrassi', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'storyline', 'prevalent', 'main', 'Degrassi', 'storyline', 'first', 'episode', 'arc', 'primarily', 'Paige', 'being', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'usual', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'Manny', 'credit', 'role', 'spirit', 'squad', 'two', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'Craig', 'member', 'Kevin', 'Smiths', 'production', 'writing', 'song', 'movie', 'Happy', 'Craig', 'Ashley', 'get', 'work', 'songs', 'are', 'panned', 'Ashley', 'move', 'Europe', 'was', 'already', 'planning', 'Europe', 'trip', 'songs', 'being', 'panned', 'dealmaker', 'second', 'episode', 'arc', 'mainly', 'more', 'Craig', 'Ashley', 'Craig', 'Caitlin', 'object', 'Kevin', 'Smiths', 'crush', 'discuss', 'Craig', 'going', 'Europe', 'Joey', 'Jermiah', 'Craig', 'Stepdad', 'Craig', 'plan', 'when', 'Ashley', 'less', 'happy', 'when', 'Craig', 'plans', 'join', 'deep', 'end', 'Production', 'episodes', 'aired', 'West', 'End', 'Girls', 'Going', 'Road', 'part', '1', '2', 'FUNIMATION', 'awesome', 'releases', 'Degrassi', 'DVD', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'set', 'being', 'released', 'regular', 'unrated', 'version', 'third', 'episode', 'arc', 'lot', 'more', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Caitlin', 'grow', 'closer', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ton', 'specs', 'release', 'will', 'revise', 'review', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'purchase', 'especially', 'fans', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'still', 'season', '2', 'will', 'give', 'chance', 'own', 'piece', 'Season', '4']",N/A
925694,A3T2V4H3RGFL8E,B000AARKX0,"D. Wright ""The Film Junky""","[2, 4]","Because there were too many positive reviews and a few negative reviews I decided to write this one.  I am one of Kevin Smith's biggest fans and own alot of his stuff (DVD's, Comic Books, Action Figures, etc.); however, I decided against owning this DVD set.  It is not because the set is not good, it is because it is something I would probably never watch again.  The entire DVD consists of 3 or 4 episodes of Degrassi High (A canadian ripoff of 'Saved By The Bell').  In this feature Kevin Smith plays himself.  Smith is asked by one of Degrassi's main characters to come to Degrassi High and shoot a movie.  In rolls, Jay and Silent Bob (TA-DA!), then the plot becomes boring.  Jason Mewes has basically a cameo in this entire production, and Smith's performances are extremely weak (Shocking, I know).  For the rest of the episodes, we concentrate mostly on the kids of Degrassi High with Smith only make brief appearances.Unless you are a fan of Degrassi High, or want to see what Kevin Smith might have looked like in an episode of Saved By The Bell, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!Just as a comparision Kevin had a much better performance in 'Bottoms Up' (with Paris Hilton and Jason Mewes) and an Oscar winning performance in 'Catch and Release' (with Jennifer Garner) when compared to this garbage.  He was even better in 'Vulgar' (which I thought completely sucked) than his performance in this video.",3,A Set for the true Kevin Smith fan,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,1399,"['were', 'too', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'few', 'negative', 'reviews', 'decided', 'write', 'one', 'am', 'one', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'biggest', 'fans', 'own', 'alot', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'Comic', 'Books', 'Action', 'Figures', 'etc', 'however', 'decided', 'owning', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'set', 'not', 'good', 'something', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'entire', 'DVD', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'A', 'canadian', 'ripoff', ""'Saved"", 'Bell', 'feature', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Smith', 'asked', 'one', 'Degrassi', 'main', 'characters', 'come', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'shoot', 'movie', 'rolls', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'TA-DA', 'then', 'plot', 'boring', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'basically', 'cameo', 'entire', 'production', 'Smith', 'performances', 'are', 'extremely', 'weak', 'Shocking', 'know', 'rest', 'episodes', 'concentrate', 'mostly', 'kids', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'Smith', 'only', 'make', 'brief', 'are', 'fan', 'Degrassi', 'High', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'episode', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'DO', 'NOT', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'Just', 'comparision', 'Kevin', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'Up', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', ""'Catch"", 'Release', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'when', 'compared', 'garbage', 'was', 'even', 'better', ""'Vulgar"", 'thought', 'completely', 'sucked', 'performance', 'video']",N/A

As such, it wasn't going to be ""tidy"" as a video release.  Those looking for Kevin Smith/Jay & Silent Bob won't be disappointed--but he's definitely created a character for himself here.  Smith's relationship with one of the Degrassi mothers (ignoring the fact that he is in fact married in real life, and is playing himself) overwhelms most of his camera time, and as a non-regular watcher of the show, I have to wonder how badly this little subplot derailed an ongoing story where that woman seemed to be happily engaged going into these episodes.All in all, it's a fun diversion, a great chance to see Smith make fun of himself and have fun with these characters at a time when ""Clerks II"" wasn't yet a glint in the eye of the moviegoing public and there was no clear sense of whether or not Jay and Bob would ever be back.",3,"A little slow, but okay...",1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,899,"['three-episode', 'arc', 'serial', 'television', 'melodrama/teen', 'soap', 'such', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'tidy', 'video', 'release', 'looking', 'Kevin', 'Smith/Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'definitely', 'created', 'character', 'here', 'Smith', 'relationship', 'one', 'Degrassi', 'mothers', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'fact', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'playing', 'most', 'camera', 'time', 'non-regular', 'watcher', 'show', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'badly', 'little', 'subplot', 'derailed', 'ongoing', 'story', 'where', 'woman', 'seemed', 'be', 'happily', 'engaged', 'going', 'episodes.All', 'fun', 'diversion', 'great', 'chance', 'see', 'Smith', 'make', 'fun', 'have', 'fun', 'characters', 'time', 'when', 'Clerks', 'II', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'glint', 'eye', 'moviegoing', 'public', 'was', 'clear', 'sense', 'not', 'Jay', 'Bob', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'back']",N/A
