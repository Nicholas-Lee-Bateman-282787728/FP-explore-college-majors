The beginning of the movie is not very dynamic, as you will see a number of disconnected quite gruesome scenes describing personal dramas of main characters, the pace becomes really intense with the death of one of them. Visual effects are impressive, the cinematography puts you in the mood of a never-ending agony of hell shared by the bunch of lost residents. Some actors were doing their parts in the movie really great. I particularly admired the excellent performances of Hee Ching Paw (Auntie Mui). She should have received an Oscar for this one.

1692441,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00HUX3IYK,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","I make it no secret to anyone that I love the movies of Takashi Shimizu. One of the most exciting moments of my career as a movie blogger was getting the opportunity to interview the talented Writer / Director / Producer. While many grew weary of &#8220;The Grudge&#8221; after so many spin-offs and sequels, I actually enjoyed and found most of them terrifyingly entertaining.His other works like &#8220;Reincarnation,&#8221; &#8220;The Shock Labyrinth,&#8221; and &#8220;Tormented&#8221; are all fine examples of what Shimizu can do outside the box of his most famous creation.  I&#8217;ve been waiting years for his film &#8220;4700&#8221; to be released either straight-to-DVD or in theaters. It looks like we&#8217;ll have to settle for projects produced by him for a while. One of those was recently released by Well Go USA Entertainment.&#8220;Rigor Mortis&#8221; is a supernatural tale featuring vampires, zombies, ghost hunters, and other creatures that haunt your nightmares. They all seem to have a fixation on the apartment building a washed-up suicidal actor moved into. As you can imagine, all sorts of very strange and disturbing occurrences unfold. Mix in some martial arts and you have a perfect homage to the classic Chinese vampire films of the past.&#8220;Rigor Mortis&#8221; is presented in 16x9 widescreen with 5.1 HD Surround Sound. The natural color scheme is stylishly altered throughout giving it different moody elements. The audio features all sorts of oddly disturbing sounds for horror fans to enjoy and immerse themselves in.There&#8217;s not much here for folks who like bonus material. All that&#8217;s included is a trailer for the movie. It would have been interesting to see a &#8220;Making of&#8221; featurette containing interviews with the cast and crew and production footage.Although &#8220;Rigor Mortis&#8221; is unrated, I would give it an R. There&#8217;s a lot of gore and disturbing horror imagery. Bad language and some nudity can be found as well.I can definitely see why Takashi Shimizu took a liking to &#8220;Rigor Mortis.&#8221; After seeing the filmmaker&#8217;s more bizarre stylings in &#8220;The Shock Labyrinth&#8221; and &#8220;Tormented,&#8221; I perceive why he was drawn to the strange characters and peculiar phantasmagorias Director Juno Mak came up with for this unique genre entry. If you grow weary of the typical American monster movies we constantly get, &#8220;Rigor Mortis&#8221; is a step in a curious direction.",4,'Grudge' Mastermind Takashi Shimizu Gives Horror Fans 'Rigor Mortis',1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,2483,"['make', 'secret', 'anyone', 'love', 'movies', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'One', 'most', 'exciting', 'moments', 'career', 'movie', 'blogger', 'was', 'getting', 'opportunity', 'interview', 'talented', 'Writer', '/', 'Director', '/', 'Producer', 'many', 'grew', 'weary', '8220', 'Grudge', '8221', 'so', 'many', 'spin-offs', 'sequels', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'found', 'most', 'terrifyingly', 'other', 'works', '8220', 'Reincarnation', '8221', '8220', 'Shock', 'Labyrinth', '8221', '8220', 'Tormented', '8221', 'are', 'fine', 'examples', 'what', 'Shimizu', 'can', 'do', 'box', 'most', 'famous', 'creation', '8217', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'film', '8220', '4700', '8221', 'be', 'released', 'straight-to-DVD', 'theaters', '8217', 'll', 'have', 'settle', 'projects', 'produced', 'while', 'One', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'Well', 'Go', 'USA', 'Entertainment.', '8220', 'Rigor', 'Mortis', '8221', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'featuring', 'vampires', 'zombies', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'other', 'creatures', 'haunt', 'nightmares', 'seem', 'have', 'fixation', 'apartment', 'building', 'washed-up', 'suicidal', 'actor', 'moved', 'can', 'imagine', 'sorts', 'very', 'strange', 'disturbing', 'occurrences', 'unfold', 'Mix', 'martial', 'arts', 'have', 'perfect', 'homage', 'classic', 'Chinese', 'vampire', 'films', 'past.', '8220', 'Rigor', 'Mortis', '8221', 'presented', '16x9', 'widescreen', '5.1', 'HD', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'natural', 'color', 'scheme', 'stylishly', 'altered', 'giving', 'different', 'moody', 'elements', 'audio', 'features', 'sorts', 'oddly', 'disturbing', 'sounds', 'horror', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'immerse', 'in.There', '8217', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'folks', 'who', 'like', 'material', '8217', 's', 'included', 'trailer', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', '8220', 'Making', '8221', 'featurette', 'containing', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'production', 'footage.Although', '8220', 'Rigor', 'Mortis', '8221', 'unrated', 'would', 'give', 'R.', '8217', 's', 'lot', 'gore', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'imagery', 'Bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'well.I', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'why', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', 'took', 'liking', '8220', 'Rigor', 'Mortis.', '8221', 'seeing', 'filmmaker', '8217', 'more', 'bizarre', 'stylings', '8220', 'Shock', 'Labyrinth', '8221', '8220', 'Tormented', '8221', 'perceive', 'why', 'was', 'drawn', 'strange', 'characters', 'peculiar', 'phantasmagorias', 'Director', 'Juno', 'Mak', 'came', 'up', 'unique', 'genre', 'entry', 'grow', 'weary', 'typical', 'American', 'monster', 'movies', 'constantly', 'get', '8220', 'Rigor', 'Mortis', '8221', 'step', 'curious', 'direction']","Rigor Mortis (Region A Blu-ray) (English subtitled) Juno Mak, Takashi Shimizu"

1692444,A1P95EYQ9MW2RM,B00HUX3IYK,"Persistent Gardener ""cinephile""","[0, 2]","This is a creative homage to the genre of Chinese Horror films,by young Hong Kong director Juno Mak. This is his first feature film.It is a grim, unrelenting film, without the usual comedic elements of the genre.The devastating emotional pain of the loss of loved onesdefines the mood of the story, and it is equally important to the extremephysical pain and gory violence of the action sequences.Although-by hindsight-the title ""Rigor Mortis"" is revealing,please note that crucial plot elements are reviewed here.Actor Siu-Ho Chin, of Mr. Vampire (1985)fame, arrives in a run-down apartmentcomplex. All his belongins fit in a milk crate, and a battered suitcasewhich holds the costumes of his famous roles.His acting career is over, and he has been separated from his wife and hisbeloved son. In his frame of mind, his new abode appears like apost-apocalyptic prison. There, in his dreary cubicle #2442, crushed byloneliness and remorse, he takes his life.His dying brain casts the fleeting impressions of the other inhabitantsof the apartment complex into a complex narrative of traditional ChineseHorror. There's the retired Taoist Vampire Hunter, the twin ghosts of two girls,a corrupt priest dabbling in Black Magic, and the inevitable Chinese Vampire.The actor reprises, for one last time, his famous screen exploits.This is a masterfully directed, photographed and edited film, withfirst-rate special effects. It is frightening and emotionally poignantat the same time.Blu-ray extras include the trailer of the film, a making-of featurettewhich comprises conversations with the director and the principal actors,and a small photo gallery.",5,In a Hell of his own...,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,1645,"['creative', 'homage', 'genre', 'Chinese', 'Horror', 'films', 'young', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'director', 'Juno', 'Mak', 'first', 'feature', 'film.It', 'grim', 'unrelenting', 'film', 'usual', 'comedic', 'elements', 'genre.The', 'devastating', 'emotional', 'pain', 'loss', 'loved', 'onesdefines', 'mood', 'story', 'equally', 'important', 'extremephysical', 'pain', 'gory', 'violence', 'action', 'sequences.Although-by', 'hindsight-the', 'title', 'Rigor', 'Mortis', 'revealing', 'please', 'note', 'crucial', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'reviewed', 'here.Actor', 'Siu-Ho', 'Chin', 'Mr.', 'Vampire', '1985', 'fame', 'run-down', 'apartmentcomplex', 'belongins', 'fit', 'milk', 'crate', 'battered', 'suitcasewhich', 'costumes', 'famous', 'roles.His', 'acting', 'career', 'been', 'separated', 'wife', 'hisbeloved', 'son', 'frame', 'mind', 'new', 'abode', 'apost-apocalyptic', 'prison', 'dreary', 'cubicle', '2442', 'crushed', 'byloneliness', 'remorse', 'life.His', 'dying', 'brain', 'fleeting', 'impressions', 'other', 'inhabitantsof', 'apartment', 'complex', 'complex', 'narrative', 'traditional', 'ChineseHorror', 'retired', 'Taoist', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'twin', 'ghosts', 'two', 'girls', 'corrupt', 'priest', 'dabbling', 'Black', 'Magic', 'inevitable', 'Chinese', 'Vampire.The', 'actor', 'reprises', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'famous', 'screen', 'exploits.This', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'photographed', 'edited', 'film', 'withfirst-rate', 'special', 'effects', 'frightening', 'emotionally', 'poignantat', 'same', 'time.Blu-ray', 'extras', 'include', 'trailer', 'film', 'making-of', 'featurettewhich', 'comprises', 'conversations', 'director', 'principal', 'actors', 'small', 'photo', 'gallery']","Rigor Mortis (Region A Blu-ray) (English subtitled) Juno Mak, Takashi Shimizu"
1692445,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B00HUX3IYK,S. Der,"[3, 5]","There are some spoilers in my review. Help me answers these questions I have.I watched this movie because I loved Chinese Vampire movies when I was a little kid, and was super sad when they stopped making them. Now after so many years have passed, they decided to make a NEW Chinese Vampire movie. I was pretty excited getting ready to watch this movie. But, it didn't turn out exactly how I imagined it to be.Okay, first things first, I like the name of the movie: Rigor Mortis. I had no idea what that meant until I Google it. I thought this was an excellent name for the movie. Rigor Mortis means that dead bodies goes through stiffness and the limbs become hard to move. And, if you know anything about Chinese Vampire, you know that they do not walk or run. All they do is hop and their arms are extended straight forward and stiff. Therefore, this is Rigoar Mortis effect is the perfect name for this Chinese Vampire flick.I really enjoyed all the cast members' characters, they really played their parts well and made me believed their characters. The story made the casts member really shine in their parts.The CGI was done very, well. This was probably the best thing to go watch this movie for. The great details, they put into making everything looked great to watch. However, the music I thought could had been better to fit the scenes being shown. It still worked out though.Now for what I didn't like. I didn't really like the whole idea of mixing a hunted ghost apartment with the Chinese Vampire story. They made the story fit for the movie purpose, but I would rather just see one or the other. I really just wanted to watch this movie for the Chinese Vampire, and not be brother with the ghost aspects. Also, it does seem there were more showing of the ghosts than the vampire. It was interesting to see ghosts possession of the Chinese Vampire's body. That has never been done to my knowledge.I didn't like how this movie explains everything so quickly. If you didn't fully pay attention to every single sentence, you will probably miss out on something very important. They don't tend to repeat themselves, so if you missed it--YOU MISSED IT! For example, Chin Siu-ho is the main actor you will see in this movie. I didn't know he was a former vampire hunter actor in movies before after finishing the movie. But after watching the movie and reading a review about it, I found that out about Chin Siu-ho, which made more sense now. I believe I did hear them mention it quickly, but I didn't think too much of it because it was just so quick. There were some other clues to him being a previous vampire hunter actor as well, but it didn't really hit me until I actually read it in a review. Also, it's NOT obvious thing to notice from him. This is because in the whole movie, you will see him being saved over and over again. Then, at the very end of the movie, it's amazing to see him actually know how to fight--VERY WELL. He knows what to do and how to fight off a vampire, which I was very questionable. Until I find out, oh, he was a former vampire hunter actor. Really, that made way more sense now. lolThe biggest problem I have with this movie is the story itself is so confusing. If you really understand the movie, I hope you can help me understand these questions I have about it. As I said before, a Chinese Vampire ""hops"". So, it really confusing when I saw for the very first time in the movie, the fight against it and Kara Hui (crazy housewife). They both are ready to fight each other and when Kara starts running towards it, instead of it jumping towards her, we see it just gliding motion across the floor like it was a ghost. I'm sorry, but it can't do that!!! It supposed to either jump huge leap toward her or do a lot of small hops towards her. The thing can't just slide his feet like a ghost towards her! What is it using as proportion to do that? It can't suddenly lift up on his toes and jet at her. This really made no sense.Another confusing scene was how the Vampire just suddenly gets out of control? I thought all they had to do was leave that face mask on it. Then, it would be under control all the time. I don't know how it just went from one scene where everything is just fine and the next scene everything is out of control. I was so in disbelief. I was all of a sudden, seeing the vampire already loss its masks and is totally out of control. Also, the Dark Priest was seriously hurt. There were no explanation scenes to get to that point in between. That felt really rushed and confusing. How did it just get loose? So now it is on the rampage? Wow...Speaking of the mask around the Vampire's mouth, is that really suppose to be the new way of controlling the Chinese Vampire? That's my guess. Before the way to control these Chinese Vampires were to stick these Chinese writing yellow papers or ""fu"" on their forehead. Once the fu were stuck on their heads, they can be control by a priest to follow his orders. But, we don't see this, so I'm guessing it's that mask thing, right?Finally my biggest problem with this movie is the ending. It's so confusing! I'm not exactly sure why Anthony Chan (Taoist master-exorcist) had to really loose his arm. I know he was turning the metal device with his arm. It went around and around until it broke off. Really??? Who the hell says, he can't simply get up and keep on crawling around with the device while it's turning? It's not like he's really doing anything. He doesn't need to focus on the battle between the vampire and Chin Siu-ho. He didn't get involved. His main job was to turn that device and keep track of the time limit. So, he can get up and turn it. It doesn't make any sense, how he loss his arm. But, since it's supposed to be a scary movie, I guess that's how they are supposedly scaring people?The final battle between Chin Siu-ho and the Vampire was a bit confusing as well. Chin Siu-ho was seriously injured minutes before the final battle. He was stabbed right through stomach! There was a HUGE hole! He was bleeding a gallon of blood. He looked like he was barely alive at this point. I don't know how he just got up and suddenly fought like he was 100%??? My only guess is that the Taoist master somehow sent him into an alternative dimension and that supposedly got him fully healed? I don't know how so, because he should still be hurt. Even if he was sent through time and space, he still should be seriously hurt. Going into the alternative dimension and coming out of it, doesn't mean he's good to go. I believed he even asked the Taoist master, if he can save his life, but he said he couldn't. So, I don't know how he ended up saving his life anyways.Another thing is the ending after the final battle. We see Chin Siu-ho have these visions. Or at least, I think it's visions. I could be wrong, where none of what we just saw was real. This guy could had been really a true Psycho-Path, and we just saw a messed up dream sequence of his dead eyes. Then, what really happened is the alternative vision at the end. I think it is a true possibility because we see him dead at morgue. Then, we see a black tunnel with a white light in the middle, we are charging upward. Then, it shows his dead eyes too at the morgue. Both realities were shown through his dead eyes. So, which universe was the true universe??? Who else was confused as I was at the end? What did we just see?I really hate a director that gives an open-ended ending. It's like you spend 2 hours of your life watching something and you end up thinking, ""was this all a dream""??? It's open to interpretation, which SUCKS! You won't really know what happened until the director says something. Why couldn't he just make the ending end? All he needed to do is kill the Chinese Vampire - that's it! Why mess everything up and tell the audience this is maybe fake reality? It's like the director just slapped the audience in the face and laugh at us.Yes, this movie is worth watching. You should see it because it has very unique concepts. But, you might be confused and angry as I was.",3,It's like the director just slapped the audience in the face and laugh at us!,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,8077,"['are', 'spoilers', 'review',
