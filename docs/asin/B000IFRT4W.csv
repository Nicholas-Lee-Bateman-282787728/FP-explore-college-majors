1020374,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000IFRT4W,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Update- June 14, 2013Well I think I'm finally losing my mind.  I wrote a review for this film 6 years ago and can't remember a single bit of it.  I mean I remember *nothing* at all.  This is... the first time this has ever happened.  Hopefully I'm not going through some kind of permanent case of amnesia.  Really strange.Well anyway, my original review was too short and not interesting enough, so here's an updated one.Little Man is about a criminal midget who, after his jail release, meets up with a ""friend"", disguises himself as a baby, robs a jewelry store, and lives with a husband/wife because they accidentally brought home a precious high-dollar jewel thanks to a botched robbery.Little Man is definitely a really silly, outrageous and far-fetched storyline but my GOODNESS is it ever hilarious!  The midget is played by Marlon Wayans, who's not really a midget- this is all movie trickery making it *seem* like he is, and rather effectively exeucted because I actually had to come online just to make sure!Throughout the film the husband and wife really think he's a baby.  Several moments are just really funny to me.  The visit to the doctor where it's discovered he has a tongue of a 40-year old man, and a tattoo (explained that it's not unusual for parents to put tattoos on their kids).  I also LOVE the many facial expressions the baby would make whenever he had to do something he didn't like, such as drink breast milk from a woman he's not attracted to, or takes a shot of alcohol/whiskey and has an accident in his pants.Also the hockey game segment is totally priceless with the overdramatic hockey player coming into the stands to pick a fight with a fan, in addition to the birthday party that occurs later on where Marlon is just happy he's finally being appreciated.  Oh and who can overlook the scene with the baby attempting to drive away with the jewel in his possession believing he's making a clean escape, only to cause a wreck.  He quickly hops in the baby seat and when the cops arrive they act like the driver escaped, lol.  Another memorable segment is the football game that takes place between a ""rough and tough"" father, as well as other fathers and children.  Oh and when the baby arrives at the doorstep and there's a note written down explaining who the baby is.  Inappropriate enough that I can't share here on amazon but trust me, it's really funny.  Just several moments had me in tears that easily warrants a 5-star rating.  GREAT movie!Also, the father of the ""baby"" is really sincere due to desperately wanting a baby with his wife, and it's a moment of sentimental writing when he says he'll always be there for his son no matter what.  Overall, highly recommended comedy.",5,"stop that baby, I mean...",1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,2723,"['Update-', 'June', '14', '2013Well', 'think', ""'m"", 'finally', 'losing', 'mind', 'wrote', 'review', 'film', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'single', 'bit', 'mean', 'remember', '*nothing*', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'happened', 'Hopefully', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'kind', 'permanent', 'case', 'amnesia', 'Really', 'strange.Well', 'anyway', 'original', 'review', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'not', 'interesting', 'enough', 'here', 'updated', 'one.Little', 'Man', 'criminal', 'midget', 'who', 'jail', 'release', 'up', 'friend', 'baby', 'robs', 'jewelry', 'store', 'husband/wife', 'accidentally', 'brought', 'home', 'precious', 'high-dollar', 'jewel', 'thanks', 'botched', 'robbery.Little', 'Man', 'definitely', 'really', 'silly', 'outrageous', 'far-fetched', 'storyline', 'GOODNESS', 'ever', 'hilarious', 'midget', 'played', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'midget-', 'movie', 'trickery', 'making', 'rather', 'effectively', 'exeucted', 'actually', 'had', 'come', 'online', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'film', 'husband', 'wife', 'really', 'think', 'baby', 'Several', 'moments', 'are', 'just', 'really', 'funny', 'visit', 'doctor', 'where', 'discovered', 'tongue', '40-year', 'old', 'man', 'tattoo', 'explained', 'not', 'unusual', 'parents', 'put', 'tattoos', 'kids', 'also', 'LOVE', 'many', 'facial', 'expressions', 'baby', 'would', 'make', 'whenever', 'had', 'do', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'such', 'drink', 'milk', 'woman', 'not', 'attracted', 'shot', 'alcohol/whiskey', 'accident', 'pants.Also', 'hockey', 'game', 'segment', 'totally', 'priceless', 'overdramatic', 'hockey', 'player', 'coming', 'stands', 'pick', 'fight', 'fan', 'addition', 'birthday', 'party', 'later', 'where', 'Marlon', 'just', 'happy', 'finally', 'being', 'appreciated', 'Oh', 'who', 'can', 'overlook', 'scene', 'baby', 'attempting', 'drive', 'away', 'jewel', 'possession', 'believing', 'making', 'clean', 'escape', 'only', 'cause', 'wreck', 'quickly', 'baby', 'seat', 'when', 'cops', 'arrive', 'act', 'driver', 'escaped', 'lol', 'memorable', 'segment', 'football', 'game', 'place', 'rough', 'tough', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'fathers', 'children', 'Oh', 'when', 'baby', 'doorstep', 'note', 'written', 'down', 'explaining', 'who', 'baby', 'Inappropriate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'share', 'here', 'amazon', 'trust', 'really', 'funny', 'Just', 'several', 'moments', 'had', 'tears', 'easily', 'warrants', '5-star', 'rating', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'Also', 'father', 'baby', 'really', 'sincere', 'due', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'baby', 'wife', 'moment', 'sentimental', 'writing', 'when', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'there', 'son', 'matter', 'what', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommended', 'comedy']",N/A

1020376,A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B000IFRT4W,"Chandler ""Infamous""","[4, 6]","I'm so glad I rented this movie. To tell you the truth, it wasn't even worth the 2 bucks I paid to rent this movie. Basically it's about a short midget who steals a diamond and hides it in a lady's purse and pretends to be a baby for a couple as he tries to get it back. Little Man had so many problems. First, the movie was boring. Seriously, I had a hard time staying awake in this movie. Second, it wasn't funny (or at least I didn't find it funny). The humor was completely dry, especially the beginning when Percy and Calvin were at the bank (a word of advice to whoever casted this movie, avoid that lady who played the bank teller who tried to be ""hip"").The real meat of this movie was the fact that Calvin (Marlon Waynes) playing as a baby. Couldn't they get better props, such as making Calvin look like a baby? I mean, they could have made him bald or something (I can still see the fresh cut on Calvin's head). And for Percy with his over blinged out outfit, just not cool. And John Witherspoon is in here as well. Didn't they get enough of eachother during The Waynes Brothers 10 years ago?It's real hard to find the best part of the movie. Probably because I fell asleep for a short period (the part between when Daryl and Vanessa took Calvin to the doctor and when Daryl and Calvin were at the park, I don't know what happened - and didn't bother to rewind to see what happened either).Overall, this movie is a train wreck. If you think this movie is funny, you might want to see a doctor. There was a chuckle here and there. Kerry Washington looked sexy in the movie. Her looks alone warrant the 4 out of 10 score on this movie. Either way, the movie still sucks. I didn't even bother looking at the bonus features, because I was mad at the movie.

1020378,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000IFRT4W,Chris Pandolfi,"[13, 23]","As I sat through ""Little Man,"" I was reminded of a cartoon drawn by Charles Addams. It showed three mobster-type men standing in front of the safety deposit box of a bank. Two of them were normal sized while the one in the middle was a dwarf who couldn't have been more than two and a half feet tall. The caption underneath the cartoon has this short criminal saying, ""All right, fellas. You got it straight what you're supposed to do?"" I think the effectiveness of this joke depends on its simplicity; a single illustration on a piece of paper is all we're given, and the rest of the scenario is left up to our imaginations. If the joke had been extended into a full comic strip and had told a complete story, it would have been a terrible read. That's because we know how unrealistic it is to rob a bank by stuffing a dwarf through a safety deposit box.Herein lies the failure of ""Little Man"": it's an absolutely ridiculous movie about a pint-sized criminal and his attempt to infiltrate someone else's home by dressing up as a baby. From start to finish, it's filled to the brim with implausible circumstances, idiotic characters, and low-grade humor, none of which heighten the comedic intentions so much as they completely destroy them. I don't think the fact that it was directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans makes that much of a difference; he successfully tackled the first two ""Scary Movie"" films with an over the top sense of humor, turning them into full-blown parodies. From these examples, I know he's capable of entertaining an audience. That's one of the reasons why this new film was difficult to sit through: I hoped for something amusing but got something that completely misses the mark.It's also an offensive movie, exploiting those with Dwarfism and turning the condition into a way to get a cheap laugh. It's made even worse by the fact that the main character--vertically challenged criminal mastermind Calvin Simms--is played by Marlon Wayans, someone who in real life is of average height. They had to use special effects for this character, superimposing Wayans' head with that of a small actor's body. That just doesn't seem credible to me. For that matter, neither does the plot, an idea so garbled it's a wonder the studio gave this project the green light. When Calvin is released from prison, he immediately plots another daring heist with his dimwitted rapper-wannabe of a sidekick, Percy (Tracy Morgan). They have to steal a very large diamond and give it to Walken (Chazz Palminteri), an Italian kingpin stereotype whose reasons for wanting the diamond in the first place are unknown. (It must have been more than money. He didn't just want the diamond; he was desperate for it)Lucky for them, it's on display at an upscale jewelery store, and they waste no time in attempting to get their hands on it. In order to sneak in undetected, Calvin is stuffed into an oversized sports bag and carried over Percy's shoulder. Percy then enters, sets the bag down, and distracts one of the salesclerks by claiming he's the producer of a hip-hop record label and he's looking to give his ""girls"" some bling. (Now do you see what I mean about this being offensive?) Calvin goes about his task and successfully steals the diamond, crawling beneath the display stand and drilling a hole to the surface. It's interesting that no one noticed this as it was happening, considering the store was full of people. Only in a substandard comedy would the crooks be noticed just as they're leaving, and only then is the alarm is sounded.Percy and Calvin are nearly caught by the police while making their getaway. In order to protect themselves and the diamond, they run into a local drugstore and drop it into a woman's purse. While this gets them out of hot water with the police, it still creates an even bigger problem: the diamond is now in someone else's possession and they have to somehow recover it and deliver it to Walken before it's too late. They then come up with a plan, one that involves Calvin posing as an abandoned baby. Percy leaves Calvin on the doorstep of the woman's home with a barely legible note attached to his bib. He then rings the doorbell and walks away. It could have been such a classic moment (if a little cliche) were it not for a wandering dog that stops and pees on Calvin's face.The house belongs to Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa (Kerry Washington), a young couple who, as it happens, have been trying to have a baby. Even though they're not bad people, I didn't like them one bit. For one thing, Darryl didn't seem completely fleshed out; all we know for sure is that he can't afford a diamond for his wife's ring (which she wears anyway) and that he's hell bent on starting a family. Vanessa is ambitious but incredibly naive, pretty much to the point of foolishness (not helped by the fact that she never once looked inside her purse). And the fact that they welcome Calvin with open arms is beyond me; not only does he not look like a baby, he doesn't sound or behave like one, either. And yet they fall for it, as does everyone else in this movie. He even manages to fool a doctor, who notices right off the bat that he has a tattoo, a scar on the left side of his stomach, and all thirty-two teeth in his mouth (with bridge work, I might add). I can't help but question the state of anyone who fails to notice that a dwarf looks nothing like a real baby.The only character who isn't fooled is Vanessa's father (John Witherspoon), a crotchety old man living with his daughter and son-in-law (the latter of which he despises). He continuously makes note of how ugly a baby Calvin is (at one point he calls him Chucky), and always wants to take the attention away from him. Of course, Calvin is on to him and knows just how to fix the problem. Basically, he makes the old man look senile by acting one way in front of his ""parents"" and another way in front of him. It works well enough to get him sent away to a nursing home, something his daughter was initially unwilling to do (she was too doting to notice how unlikable a man he really is). How interesting that the writers used a plot device harkening back to the Warner Bros. cartoon ""One Froggy Evening."" And how dumb.Truth be told, ""dumb"" is a pretty good way to describe the entire film. It was one of the most unfunny, unintelligent films I've ever seen, made worse by pathetic attempts at drama and prejudicial overtones. Within the first thirty minutes, I found that I no longer cared whether or not the diamond would eventually be recovered and everything would turn out okay. That didn't seem to be what the filmmakers wanted to focus on, despite the fact that it plays a very important role in the story. All they wanted to show was juvenile humor and meaningless, offensive caricatures. This doesn't just apply to the main characters; in a scene when the neighborhood dads play football with their sons, a testosterone-driven tough guy (who believes boys should be raised only around sports) picks up his son by his helmet and drags him. That was painful to watch, as was the rest of the film.Charles Addams had the right idea when he drew that cartoon. It was short and to the point, and by not making it into an actual story, it didn't expose the ridiculousness of the situation. This is more than I can say for ""Little Man."" My only recommendation is that you avoid this movie. It's not worth the time or the effort, and it certainly isn't worth the price of admission.",1,"""Little Man"" Was a Big Mistake",1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,7489,"['sat', 'Little', 'Man', 'was',

There's even more flatulence humor spewing across the screen and the characters are dumber than ever, given what the movie's plot entails.  It's about Marlon Wayans as midget thief who stole a diamond with the help of Tracy Morgan and had to drop the item on a purse of an unsuspecting couple, so he (reluctantly) disguised himself as a baby in a basket so the foolish couple would give it love and attention.  And thus, we have lots of baby-related jokes: pooping, breast-feeding, and using toys to throw them in someone's gonads again and again and again.  There's also that one scene where the wife awoke after an exhausting couple of love-makings and realized the baby was right next to her and the husband (Shawn) wasn't around during the second round; within a certain context, that's almost as disturbing as the 'Miss Teacher' episode of ""South Park"".What I don't like about this movie is that the midget crook doesn't seem to care about keeping an appearance.  Granted, it's unconvincing enough that he has adult features to even be considered a baby, and even if technically he's portraying a toddler it's still unconvincing, but he prefers not to act like one.  At least in ""White Chicks"" when the main characters put on make-up that made them look more like bleached, hairless apes than rich white girls, they stayed in character (for the most part).  Here, the crook kept breaking out of character more than he broke laws, from his winks to his muscular strength regarding handshakes and his verbal insults at a mascot in front of a busy party; thank goodness for him the other characters being as dumb as doorknobs, because even a brain-damaged spaz would discover his disguise.  I know it's all suppose to be funny, but I find it too stupid to be delightful.""Little Man"" is humorless and pathetic, another step to the continuing downfall of the Wayans Brothers' careers.

So, I figured I give ""Little Man"" a try, and honestly, it wasn't that bad, I actually had a decent time watching this unlike ""White Chicks."" Most of the humor in this film revolves around slapstick violence, which is in itself mainly based around the fact that one of the instigators of the violence is tiny. This sounds horrible, I know it does, but it is actually not that bad (barring a few parts).Through out this film I found few annoying performances. I have no idea what John Witherspoon was on during the filming of this, but I have the feeling it'd put half of viewers to sleep. I realize the character he's playing is supposed to be a bit crazy, but I quite honestly felt like throwing my shoe through the screen whenever he was on it. Kerry Washington also annoyed me at some points, but that was mostly due to her character's lines rather than how she delivered them. Shawn Wayans puts on a decent performance and is believable at times.The actual plot (a stolen diamond) is pretty much forgotten throughout most of the film. Once Marlon pretends to be the baby, until the very end of the movie, the diamond is pretty much a useless part of the plot. But with this kind of comedy, you know you're not going to get much of a plot-heavy movie anyway, and that should be taken into consideration. Other than that it's a decent film. It's not perfect and it's not bad either.

1020388,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000IFRT4W,JGC,"[3, 4]","First of all, there's a lot of very funny performances in this film by some enormously talented stars! Why isn't Tracy Morgan ever mentioned when this movie is being reviewed? If I had known he was staring in it I would have watched this 2 years ago when it first came out, instead of waiting for it to be shown on Encore. Tracy Morgan plays Percy, a bumbling, stumbling criminal who can make even the most serious person crack up! Of course I enjoyed the performances by the 2 lead stars, Marlon (as Calvin) and Shawn Wayans (as Darryl.) They work together very well and are excellent at doing slap-stick comedy.In addition, I enjoyed the core cast of Kerry Washington (as Vanessa) and John Witherspoon (as Pops.) I love it when Pops says to the baby, ""you smell like PISS."" At first I couldn't tell if Vanessa was missing a screw or if she was just very proper. In the end we all know that she was a very sweet lady who was perhaps a touch on the bonkers side (she almost reminded me of the late Michelle Thomas of ""Family Matters!"") I also loved the performance by Alex Borstein as Janet. Didn't she look so different? I totally didn't recognize her! And wasn't it so funny when she b-r-eastfed baby Calvin? That was just nasty.There's also a slew of cameos by some of my favorite (and probably your favorites, as well!) stars! I loved Molly Shannon as the nutty Soccer Mom!! She was soooooo funny!! David Alan Grier was also in the very beginning and he was very amusing! And Rob Schneider plays a wannabe Barney-the-Dinosaur in a laugh-till-it hurts (yet uncredited) scene!I also thought it was hilarious how Calvin was made out to be a baby/infant in some scenes (when he was in the high chair or inside that baby swing) and in other scenes he was supposed to be a toddler (like when he was in the park or when he played football.) This had to be done on purpose to make everyone look silly and give the movie somewhat of a cartoon feel to it. The movie has some incredible special effects which took nearly 5 months to shoot, not to mention several more months in post-production.""Little Man"" did have a positive message. What message did I gain from it? I believe the film was trying to convey that there isn't anything corny in being a good father or a strong black husband who wants to be there for his wife and children.I did like how it ended (courtesy of Marlon and Shawn and a smaller role by Chazz Palminteri as Walken the thug!) It was very funny and fast-paced. Although I didn't understand why Kerry Washington was M.I.A. for the last 3 scenes?Based on what everyone has said about this movie I thought it was going to be really bad. I also thought it was going to be horrible because I could not stand ""White Chicks"" (also with Marlon & Shawn.)

My guess is you're familiar with the Wayans brothers, or at least the Scary Movie series (if you're not, you've either strenuously avoided all forms of pop culture in the past 7 years, or you have some kind of memory disorder; either way, lucky you), so you have some idea of what to expect.Even if all you hear is the premise -- tiny jewel thief (Marlon Wayans, demolishing all the integrity he got from his powerful performance in ""Requiem for a Dream"") pretends to be a baby to sneak into a house and steal an obscenely huge diamond -- you can pretty much guess what you're going to get.  There are plenty of poo-poo jokes (Ha ha ha!  Baby made a surprise!), hilarious incestual misunderstandings (Is it possible for a woman to ""accidentally"" have sex with her baby and not even realize it?  Of course it is!), and let's not forget, given Little Man's stature, the bevy of groin pops, pulls, snaps, thwacks, wollops, punts, and headbutts that may be employed (some of them over and over!).Let's not sell the movie short (Ho ho!  Me so witty!).  It never proposes to offer more than Loony Toons-esque humor (with some decidedly adult twists).  But whereas a Bugs Bunny cartoon is rarely longer than ten minutes (apparantly part of the script was inspired by a Baby Bugs Bunny cartoon with a similar theme), this movie spends an hour and forty minutes using and reusing the same, tired jokes that almost anyone could think of.Delivery does stand for something, though.  The special effects are first rate (remarkable, actually), and -- in spite of myself -- there were at least three or four moments where I laughed out loud (""This cookie's got a bite to it"") but I'm not entirely willing to discount that that might have been due to something I ate.Add in a bewildering cast -- Chazz Palminteri (this guy must really like playing mobsters), Molly Shannon (she spends her throw-away appearance half-heartedly playing a lame stereotype), Vanessa Edwards (who acts in every scene as if the director is pointing a gun at her and telling her to be really funny), and an uncredited Rob Schneider (who apparantly doesn't have anything better to do) -- and what you're left with is a silly mess of a movie, even by the Wayans standards.

Then to get the diamond back they decide to not just mug her for it, but the little guy has a shave and pretends to be an abandoned baby left on there door step.

I really, really enjoyed the movie.  It was funny, it was fun, and Marlon did a fantastic job just using his facial features and voice in the film.  Calvin really made the movie.  It was just so interesting, because you know Marlon Wayons is this tall slim man, but instead he is looking really short.  The effects were pretty good.Calvin and his wanna be rapper side kick Percy steal a large diamond.  Things go wrong, and Calvin has to ditch the diamond, and places it in Vanessa's purse.  But if Calvin and Percy don't get the diamond back they are in a world of hurt from the big boss.  In order to get the diamond back Calvin acts like he is an abandoned baby, hoping he will be able to get the diamond and split.  Instead what ensues is hilarity and road block after road block.  Calvin realizes he missed having a real family, and is actually liking his father son moments with Darryl who desperately wants to be a father, but his wife Vanessa is on the career track and nervous about becoming a Mother.One of the funnier moments is the football game.  Darryl has a friend who turns into Mr. competitive and takes the game really seriously.  Calvin gets a little boy to toughen up so he won't be pushed around.  John Witherspoon as Vanessa's father was hilarious.  His role is small, but a funny one regardless.  He knows that something is amiss, but when he reveals that Calvin is a thief they cart him off to some old folks home thinking he has lost his mind.The Multi-tasking soccer mom while dangerous, that scene had me holding my sides.  Mainly because Darryl is sitting in the car screaming, and begging to get out of the car.  I was surprised to see Rob Schneider in the film playing Dinosauraus Rex.
