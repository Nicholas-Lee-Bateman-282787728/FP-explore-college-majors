They did an amazing job making a great recrutement show. It is seriously needed now more than ever. It must be assumed the military gave it's full support in the making of this HBO production. Watching GENERATION KILL it should be clear to most viewers being in the Marines means being in a brotherhood, something so many young men are desperate for, and it sure looks like a lot of fun. That GENERATION KILL shows *some* bad stuff that can happen to our ""boys"" over there only serves to make it all the more exciting. This is where you can be somebody, be part of a group, and be a real man. All those people back home just don't get it and they never will.

There is a feeling of excitement that comes on the verge of war. After this initial excitement breakdowns occur. There are problems with supplies arriving, there is dissent in the chain of command and there are questions as to orders given. The show ends with the taking of Baghdad but the show leaves its viewer with more questions than overall answers.The series is presented in an in your face manner that may be difficult for some viewers to get into. You are literally dropped into a confusing situation and left to fend for yourself and reach your own conclusions. The acting is first rate along with the entire production. The set features commentaries on six out of seven episodes. There is a discussion with the actual First Recon Marines upon whom the story is based. A thirty minutes making of featurette films in some gaps in the production history.

1166968,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001AQO3WY,Caleb Williams,"[55, 67]","When I first heard about Generation Kill, I expected it to simply be a glamorised version of the Iraq War where it shows everything working smoothly. What I didn't expect was a gritty and true story of the 1st Recon Marines during the first wave of the American invasion of Iraq. It didn't hold back, and honestly I would have hated it if they did. I later found out that this was based on the book written by journalist Evan Wright who followed this company during the initial invasion. I haven't read the book, but from the other stuff I've read I'm lead to believe it keeps true to the novel.The show focuses around the 1st Recon Marines company as a part of the initial invasion of Iraq that eventually overthrew Sadaam Hussein. It shows the true struggles that the marines went through during this invasion as they struggled with supply shortages and conditions. They are joined by Rolling Stones reporter Evan Wright (Book Author) who's there to see what really goes on in the Marine Corps. It's not about Wright or is it even about one particular Marine, it's rather a show about the entire company and their particular personalities.This is the more interesting and disturbing nature of the show. A lot of the soldiers displayed appear to have some real mental problems when it comes to their enthusiasm to kill anything in sight, or just their general views of the Iraqi people. It touches upon the civilian killings and how some order were actually made by the higher ups to kill any Iraqi whether they had weapons displayed or not. On one hand I would say it's wrong to have people with such mental problems i.e. a bit too enthusiastic to kill. On the other hand, if you didn't have these particular individuals then would we even have an army capable enough to fight such a war.Another aspect of the show, aside from the disturbing images or the general crudeness of it all is the irreverent humour displayed. It's not intentional and certainly isn't set up to be hysterical, it simply comes across as that as within the conversations of some of these men, like any chat with friends etc. you always get the odd unintentional classic line. This gives the entire show a well rounded feel and is something to be experienced by everyone. I applaud those who are over in Iraq and Afghanistan as, unfortunately due to my ignorance before this show I didn't know things were so tough.It's an overall great show and another classic creation by HBO. Be warned, however, as it is very graphic in relation to violence and if you're easily offended by strong or racist language then I would advise you stay away.",5,Gritty & Genuine.

The sheer joy and amusement of the military at the destruction it is causing is harpped on, and on.  I saw the whole serise(except the last episode)and the writers also just love to show men defacating and urinating and shooting civiliand, women, children, structures, etc.; as long as they're showing guns spitting spent shells and having that cool sound of M-16/M14 goin off.I also read the book and it seems the author was also fully engrossed in only recording the civilina casualties.  Each time they came in contact with the enemy, woemen and children were the only ones that got paragraphs and paragraphs of details.Oh and there were Syrians and Iraqi jihadist that got killed also, but you get a sentance and then on to the chilren and innocents getting shredded left and right.  It did happen, I read it on ""One Bullet Away"" by Nate Fick, the guy featered in Gen. Kill the book and tv series, but come on, give the guys some credit.  By the way, ""One Bullet Away"" is a waaaay better book than Gen. Kill.  The Gen. Kill authore just like to let you know how many times men in war go use the bathroom.  He also details it over and over and over.  We know guys out there don't have nice restrooms or private bathrooms, okay.  It goes without saying.  But to write about it over and over...  The tv series also likes this aspect of the tale.  You get to see guys butts alomst every 15 minutes.  You sure don't see that on Platoon by Oliver Stone, or even implied on Tour of Duty(the '80s tv series).The brutality of war is shown, but mostly how it affects women and children in the line of fire.  The real bad guys don't get much time in the book or the tv series.  In no way does this compare to Saving Priveate Ryan and Band of Brothers.  Those movies/series were about the heart of the US military, not the heartless ones they are portrayed here.I for one will not be buying it on DVD, nor do I recommend anyone else to do so either.  Unless you like to see the killing of innocents by our incompetent military(which is what the book and series paint our miltary to be).  I did 12 yrs in the US Navy so I know a little about military comraderie.  It's show here, but in a deceitful context.",1,AVOID AT ALL COST!!

It will be very useful to new persons to this series.I'm a big fan of Band of Brothers and The Pacific and I went into Generation Kill hoping for more of the same and I was not disappointed. It's definitely an honest look at modern military activity. When the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys aren't always bad. While it's not as epic as the previously mentioned series it still is a phenomenal production. I love the characters and how you get to see inside them and what motivates them.  It's what I love about the series that HBO produces they generally let you look at the different characters on a very in-depth level. It's what makes all these miniseries so much better than movies because of the character development in my opinion.If you can stand having subtitles very few shows in English benefit as much as GK. The subtitles pick up on a lot of the background chatter plus whatever they use military acronyms it's easier to decipher what they said. Personally I love subtitles whenever I watch the show and I recommend them highly.I watch this series almost yearly and always will pick up funny new things that I didn't notice on previous viewings. I can't recommend this enough especially if you like military movies or video games.The one thing I love about this show is the military jargon and radio chatter that is used often. Now I've seen the series five times and over those repeat viewings I've been able to make out or look up what much of the jargon or terms they use mean. the one thing I love about this show is they don't go into depth to explain what they're talking about they leave that up to the viewer to Google it themselves. So here's a comprehensive list I recommend printing it and using it while you watch the show.556: The diameter bullets in millimeters used by US forces in rifles and light machine guns a.k.a. NATO rounds.Assassin: Radio call sign for first recon's Alpha company; assassin actual is Alpha company's commander Capt. Patterson.AO: Area of operationAOE: Area of engagementAss: Traveling in the company of heavy units like tanks, cobras ectBDA: Battle Damage AssessmentCas Evac: Casualty EvacuationChaos: radio call sign for General MattisCorpsman: Enlisted member of a military medical unit.Cleared hot: Given permission to fire your weapon by a superior.Danger close: Friendly units are within 600 meters of a proposed artillery target.Fire mission: Artillery missionForty Mike-Mike: 40 millimeters; refers to either an individual 40mm self-propelled grenade round or the weapon that launches them, such as the M-19.Glassed:  Observed target with binoculars or rifle scope.Godfather: Call sign of Lieut. Col. Ferrando as well as his battalion in part due to the sound of his voice. NOTE: Godfather often speaks of himself in the third person; instead of saying ""I think"" he will say ""Godfather thinks""Haji: Slang for an IraqiH&S;: The headquarters and supply company responsible for supporting ""line companies"" or combat units made up of Alpha, bravo and Charlie companies.Helo-hot: Missile fired from a combat helicopter such as an Cobra.Hitman Two One Actual:  Bravo company's second platoon team one leader, Sgt. Colbert. While ""Hitman Two One"" refers to the entire team, ""Actual"" means the actual commander. ""Hitman two"" refers to all of bravo second platoon, but ""Hitman Two Actual"" is the platoon commander, Lieut. Fick.Hitman Victor: any vehicle and bravo company.Interrogative: Radio code prefacing a questionLAV:  Light Armored VehicleLOD: Line Of DepartureKlicks: KilometersMikes: minutesMSR: Main Supply RouteNJP: Non-Judicial Punishment ie disciplineNVGs: Night Vision GogglesOscar Mike: On the movePec-fours, Pec-thirteens: Night and infrared vision scopes.POG: Person Other than GruntPX: post-exchange storeRaptor: Radio call sign for First Recon's Charlie CompanyROE: Rules of Engagement, rules for engaging civilian targetsRTB: Return to BaseRTO: Radio Telephone OperatorRCT1: Regimental Combat Team 1Shamal: Hellacious wind and dust storms endemic to Iraq.Sit-Rep: Situation report, basically the status on mission or area.SOP: Standard Operating ProcedureStay frosty: Staying sharp, or attentive to the situationT72s: an Iraqi tankVictors: VehiclesWhiskey Tango: white trashSo there you go I hope you enjoy that list and find it very useful.

But the members of a particular Internet forum I frequent wouldn't stop talking about it, so I rented it from Netflix. I was hooked from the first episode. Last week I finished the series and ordered the book. Before viewing the series, I had decided NOT to read the book, based on critical reviews by some military reviewers. The tone of the series didn't put me off, and I wanted to read the source material. Besides, I like to make my own decisions, and I made the right one for me.I did four years in a Marine infantry unit and went to the first Gulf War, so, not surprisingly, I have an interest in Marine Corps stories. I readJarhead: a Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battlesand liked it, because the author's experiences echoed my own. I enjoyed the movie adaptation, but there was an element of fantasy to it that caused me to keep it at arm's length, so to speak. It's the gritty realism of ""Generation Kill"" that really pulls me in.In terms of recreating my experiences, GK is scary-accurate. I wasn't with a recon unit and I didn't go into Iraq, but I dug my share of fighting holes and put up way more than my share of cammie nets, and I did my fair share of grousing about the Big Green [Machine]. The guys' sitting around and complaining about anything and everything--and particularly their officers--is spot-on. So if the officers come across as less than competent, it's because the story is told from the point of view of the enlisted men. No surprise there. The characters and their bickering and camaraderie really resonated with me, and by the end of the series I felt as if I knew the guys. LikeBand of Brothersbefore it, GK's casting is remarkable. Alexander Skarsgard is magnetic. And like Person says, ""You're not gay if you think Rudy is hot.""It will be many years before I can share this series with my son, but when he is old enough I will. It will give him a little taste of what the Corps was like before powered armor suits and smart weapons (that is, the broken ones handed down from the army). :)Update: I finished reading the book in about three days. It was solid, but I didn't feel as if it really gave me any more information or insight than the miniseries did. To me that says more about the strength of the series than it does about the book. I also bought Nate Fick's book,One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer.

1166979,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B001AQO3WY,David Bonesteel,"[3, 3]","This HBO miniseries documents the adventures of a Marine platoon during the first phase of the Iraq War in 2003 as they rumble around the desert in unarmored humvees looking for the bad guys.  The large cast and the density of military jargon in the dialogue can make the story difficult to follow for civilians like me, but the resulting texture and authenticity more than makes up for it.  A rather clear picture of the muddled tactical situation and the platoon's variety of reactions to it gradually emerges, and repeated viewings are bound to reveal additional insights.  This exceptional film mostly eschews politics in the interest of showing us what the war looks like from the front lines.The entire cast is outstanding, but special mention goes to the actors who portray the crew of Bravo Company's lead vehicle, who come closest to being the stars of the show.  Alexander Skarsgard (who should have been cast in the upcoming Thor movie) portrays the cool, dependable Brad ""Iceman"" Colbert.

1166981,A2G4MGVWR20OOI,B001AQO3WY,D. Brown,"[112, 118]","This series is an accurate and engrossing depiction of combat in Iraq. The Marines are presented realistically, as neither heroes nor villains, but men doing their jobs. There are stoic idealists like Sgt. Colbert and borderline psychotics like Cpt. America, and everything in between. This is just like any military unit, or any group of people for that matter. Instead of idealizing war, Generation Kill simply gives viewers a glimpse of what it is really like. And by the same token, the series does not condemn warfare, as many documentaries and films are so tempted to do lately.War is frustrating for the individual soldier. Not just the Iraq War, but any war. Generation Kill does an excellent job of capturing this frustration. The Sergeant Major's obsession with the grooming standard is a perfect example of how military units often lose track of what their priorities should be. But in the Sergeant Major's defense, standards are set for a reason. And if you stop enforcing some, others will usually follow. In combat, small standards and procedures often determine whether people live or die.On a more technical note, the acting and writing in Generation Kill were very well done. Realistically portraying a soldier or marine is probably one of the most difficult roles for an actor. There are so many subtle nuances of being a soldier or marine, that without actually being one, it is hard to understand them. Generation Kill did a great job of training the actors to look and sound believable.I was in Iraq for 27 months, in 2005 and in 2007/2008, and I can attest that this series is about as accurate as you can get in a film. I am in the Army, but I worked pretty extensively with Marines during both of my tours, so I have a pretty decent knowledge of how they work. In the end, whether you are Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force or any other armed service member, the Iraq experience is for the most part universal. At different times you feel a wide range of emotions, from disappointment and despair, to elation and nostalgia. And Generation Kill does a great job of bringing those feelings to the viewer in a realistic and respectful way.",5,Outstanding Series,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,2161,"['series', 'accurate', 'engrossing', 'depiction', 'combat', 'Iraq', 'Marines', 'are', 'presented', 'realistically', 'heroes', 'villains', 'men', 'doing', 'jobs', 'are', 'stoic', 'idealists', 'Sgt', 'Colbert', 'borderline', 'psychotics', 'Cpt', 'America', 'everything', 'just', 'military', 'unit', 'group', 'people', 'matter', 'Instead', 'idealizing', 'war', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'simply', 'viewers', 'glimpse', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'same', 'token', 'series', 'not', 'condemn', 'warfare', 'many', 'documentaries', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'tempted', 'do', 'lately.War', 'frustrating', 'individual', 'soldier', 'Not', 'just', 'Iraq', 'War', 'war', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'frustration', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'obsession', 'grooming', 'standard', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'military', 'units', 'often', 'lose', 'track', 'what', 'priorities', 'should', 'be', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'defense', 'standards', 'are', 'set', 'reason', 'stop', 'enforcing', 'others', 'will', 'usually', 'follow', 'combat', 'small', 'standards', 'procedures', 'often', 'determine', 'people', 'live', 'die.On', 'more', 'technical', 'note', 'acting', 'writing', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Realistically', 'portraying', 'soldier', 'marine', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'roles', 'actor', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'being', 'soldier', 'marine', 'actually', 'being', 'one', 'hard', 'understand', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'training', 'actors', 'look', 'sound', 'believable.I', 'was', 'Iraq', '27', 'months', '2005', '2007/2008', 'can', 'attest', 'series', 'as', 'accurate', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'am', 'Army', 'worked', 'pretty', 'extensively', 'Marines', 'tours', 'have', 'pretty', 'decent', 'knowledge', 'how', 'work', 'end', 'are', 'Army', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'Navy', 'Air', 'Force', 'other', 'armed', 'service', 'member', 'Iraq', 'experience', 'most', 'part', 'universal', 'different', 'times', 'feel', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'disappointment', 'despair', 'elation', 'nostalgia', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'feelings', 'viewer', 'realistic', 'respectful', 'way']",Generation Kill

This is supposed to be uncorrected 'realism', which is a fraud because it fails to realize the context of its moral prerogatives, itself a classical failure of liberals. In fact that failure for circumspection is what defines their essence, the 'tolerant intolerance of intolerance'.I only was able to stomach 3 episodes. As far as the element of pure entertainment, this series is a complete bore. A deliberate bore because it enjoys being another ponderous, self-serving liberal commentary on 'America'. One could turn on NPR and get the exact same message for free, rather than paying the premium for Amazon prime or giving David Simon 30 dollars.Realism here consist of bland military platitudes, ""when you leave the Marines you get your brain back"". Jarhead language is abound. Everyone is ready to shoot a ""raghead"" and send the boiled skull back to his wife. And that is pretty much it for the first 3 episodes. There is an occasional superficial gloss on the nature of the human race and 'Hate', always a touchstone for pretentious liberals. Naturally, colored men, whom HBO categorically presents as incorruptible bastions of virtue, give these monologues to us.Elsewhere the series has a large preoccupation with the race-war in America, as does OZ and 'The Wire'. Commentary is delivered through the same hysterical, despairing, hand-wringing David Simon liberalism, the dominant liberalism of our time. There is your token white racist guy here, as in OZ, and he gets put in his place by big black men, as with OZ. The Token white racist guy in 'The Wire' I think is understood to be America simply, since liberals have a mental defect and believe the wrong white people are still in complete control of this country and are still actively pursuing extermination of all others. But 'Generation Kill' also believes this to be true, ""the white man won't be denied"" says the incorruptible black man during the invasion; the voice of peace, reason, righteousness--this angel.

I have to admit that I hated this series in the beginning. I am by no means a prude but some of the things that were said even had me going Whoa! These guys are a**holes! But after that 1st episode, it grabbed my attention and never let go. I have never been in the military, but come from a military family, with my son being the latest recruit. This series showed the true grit, attitude, boredom, tediousness and, yes, bravery of a Marine's deployment. It was very interesting to see the various reactions to the same bad and sometimes horrifying circumstances. Some handled it by keeping it inside, some took it out on others, some became better men because of it. This series showed the dilemmas faced by these guys, the confusion that occurs during battle, the endless waiting that goes on, the frustration of waiting to receive permission to shoot the enemy, and the amazing way that most of them retain their sense of humor through it all. The one thing that really opened my eyes was imagining how these guys felt helping and herding the civilians through the streets and always wondering who or what may be concealing a bomb. Imagine helping these people carry their belongings (luggage, bags, etc.) never knowing if it was going to blow you to bits.I have the utmost respect for anyone, be it a Marine, soldier, or Airman, that has had to participate in this ugly war.

Don't get me wrong--I was glued to the set for every minute of every episode. The series features strong characters, great dialogue, and no little action, and those traits make it watchable. And what the series gets absolutely right is the sheer boredom that military service sometimes entails. ""Hurry up and wait,"" as they said during World War II or, as one of my college professors put it, ""100 hours of boredom and one of sheer terror.""Generation Kill is adapted from the book of the same name by Evan Wright, but it's clear that the writers and producers have also incorporated material from One Bullet Away, the memoir by Nathaniel Fick, whom viewers will recognize as a platoon commander in this series. (Both books, by the way, are excellent reading--Fick's is one of the best I've ever read.) The series follows a platoon of Marine recon from Kuwait through the initial invasion of Iraq. Along the way, firefights break out with hostile jihadists, the company is ambushed, sent on seemingly pointless missions, and eventually arrives in Baghdad itself.

Honestly I don't think it was worth the money. The sound quality on the DVD version is just as good as the blu ray and the picture is almost the same. There's a slight upgrade in parts, but on the whole I felt like I was watching the DVD version when I had the blu ray in (most of it has the same grainy quality to it - not saying this is bad as it's the style it was shot in, just that it looks the same as the DVD), again, minus beefer sound quality, especially during the battle scenes.One thing that really set this version apart is losing the military glossary book from the DVD. It is included in this set, but it's interactive on the disks. To some that might not matter, but when I'm watching and want to look up a term, it's so much easier to just pull out the book and flip a few pages rather than interrupting the flow of the show by fussing with the remote.

The ""bro"" and uber-homoerotic scenes added to the complete lack of action I had intended to sit down and watch, and were frustrating.  A lot of it seemed trite and obvious.Here's the thing though.  They nailed it.  First, the actors get a bit better at saying things like ""bro,"" but, more importantly, the series as a whole gives one of the best portrayals of this war I've yet to encounter.  There is this rush to take down an enemy that is only sometimes there to fight, and the first episodes make you feel the frustration (not to say that I wish there had been more bloodshed in the war) and even boredom of the ready-to-do-this troops.  This slog continues, with moments, little glimpses of what is trying to be portrayed.  By the ""end"" of the series, mirroring the false end of the war, the pace and action pick up.  So one is left with the impression that the real fighting didn't even start until the end was declared.It can seem that the writers were at times trying to glamorize certain characters and character traits, but don't make the assumptions.  Watch this all the way through before passing judgement.

This series tells the story (based on the non-fiction book by Evan Wright) about a group that was on of the first on the scene in Iraq at the beginning.  Certainly a complex topic, but with many facets to it.  Not only does it show the war side of it, it shows the human side that those serving are faced with.  It's complex and rather gritty at times.  The series doesn't glorify war and there's no political slant to it.  It focuses on the marines and what goes with it.I actually started reading the book that this series was based on by Evan Wright before I started the series. The characters that were described so well in the book are brought to life on screen with a fabulous cast that is led by Alexander Skarsgard as Brad Colbert, Team Leader.  This series cetainly shows his range as an actor.  He's the ""iceman"" - calm, tough and calculating, but also shows humor, compassion and downright sadness at times.  We get many glimpses of him behind a large gun and what he conveys with his eyes nothing short of amazing.  Also James Rascone as Ray Person, Brad's Humvee driver and a great source of comic relief.  Sleep deprived and on ""RipFuel"", he's usually telling stories, making jokes or singing songs, but you see him a bit down a few times and he does that equally as well.  Stark Sands is excellent as Lt. Nathaniel Fick. His performance is a little more difficult to describe, but I can't imagine someone else cast in the same part.  His interactions with the entire cast are fantastic.The rest of the casting is great as well, but the 3 mentioned above were the most noteworthy.  I don't own any ""series"" DVD box sets, and this is my first.  Well worth the time.  If you like the series, check out the book that is was based upon.While the series follows the dialog almost verbatim most of the time, there are things in the book that are not in the series, as well as insights and more information about the marines in the series.

Yes, the locations were great, South Africa is a dead ringer for Iraq, and the special effects were brilliant...BUT, I felt that there wasn't enough action.  Very few battle sequences, and those that there were, were too short.  The series spent way too much time with the internal politics of the military chain of command and how individual soldiers dealt with it.  I realize that the series was based on the writings and henceforth the book of the embedded Rolling Stone reporter that was featured in the series, but I must say that the fictional FX series ""Over There"" was much more exciting.That said, the portrayal of the first few weeks of the Iraq invasion was great.  From the MOP levels and the chaos in Baghdad after liberation was great.  So with that I give the series two stars, one for the location shooting, and one for the special effects.  I'd love to it it more stars, but quite frankly I would closely watch the show just waiting for something to happen, and then nothing ever did.If HBO, or whoever wanted to make a much more exciting show about the invasion, they should have used 3rd I.D. stuff, instead of a Marine Force Recon unit that *sighe* never got to do any force recon, other than once during the Nasiriyah sequence.",2,Ya know folks....,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,1292,"['was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'series', 'Yes', 'locations', 'were', 'great', 'South', 'Africa', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Iraq', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'brilliant', 'BUT', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'action', 'Very', 'few', 'battle', 'sequences', 'were', 'were', 'too', 'short', 'series', 'spent', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'internal', 'politics', 'military', 'chain', 'command', 'how', 'individual', 'soldiers', 'dealt', 'realize', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'writings', 'henceforth', 'book', 'embedded', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'reporter', 'was', 'featured', 'series', 'must', 'say', 'fictional', 'FX', 'series', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'exciting.That', 'said', 'portrayal', 'first', 'few', 'weeks', 'Iraq', 'invasion', 'was', 'great', 'MOP', 'levels', 'chaos', 'Baghdad', 'liberation', 'was', 'great', 'So', 'give', 'series', 'two', 'stars', 'one', 'location', 'shooting', 'one', 'special', 'effects', ""'d"", 'love', 'more', 'stars', 'quite', 'frankly', 'would', 'closely', 'watch', 'show', 'just', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'then', 'nothing', 'ever', 'HBO', 'whoever', 'wanted', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'show', 'invasion', 'should', 'have', 'used', '3rd', 'I.D', 'stuff', 'instead', 'Marine', 'Force', 'Recon', 'unit', 'never', 'got', 'do', 'force', 'recon', 'other', 'once', 'Nasiriyah', 'sequence']",Generation Kill

People go off to foreign places to kill other people, or to get killed. And they do all this in the name of &#34;freedom,&#34; which is just a word that comes out of a can in much the same way Spam does. The soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are not fighting for our freedom. They are there because the government sent them there, and - like I did - went very often for the adventure. The ones who think they are &#34;fightin' for our freedom&#34; are merely naive.That being said, the character portrayals are very realistic, and the representation of war - of battle - of deadly conflict is very accurate, except that it is shown from just one perspective. The references to &#34;they are the bad guys&#34; is ironic insofar as we (including me) would do the same thing as those &#34;bad guys&#34; if foreign invaders dared to set foot on our shores.I liked the characters, and the honesty.

Set in the Iraq invasion during Desert Storm, a battalion of elite Force Recon Marines charge into Iraq aboard their Humvies to achieve their objectives. Their leader, Lt.Colonel Stephen Ferrando, who calls himself &#34;God Father&#34; and earned the moniker due to his voice, as a result of throat cancer; tries to keep his unit in the forefront of the Marine Corps command by continuing to request new missions. It's very entertaining watching the &#34;God Father&#34; and his merry band of officers and senior NCOs imposing their nonsense on the average guys in the battalion. The biggest joke and jerk of course is Battalion Sergeant Major John Sixta, who runs around mandating that men adhere to strict Marine Corps regulations in the middle of a war. He embarrasses himself by dropping &#34;God Father's&#34; name time and again to give what says credibility. Of course, there are incompetent officers, who should never lead anyone anywhere as well as the ass kissing senior NCOs, who front for these boobs, and eventually get people killed with their orders.All the fun in the series is found inside Sgt. Brad Colbert's Humvee, where his driver, Cpl. Josh Ray Pearson; never stops talking and/or singing to the delight of the audience. Rolling Stones reporter Evan Scribe Wright is embedded into Colbert's squad, and acts as a sound board for Pearson's antics. Contributing to the hilarious banter is Sgt. Antonio Espera, who keeps reminding one and all about the White Man's Burden. Humor keeps these men from addressing the carnage unfolding all around them.A poignant point revealed time and again is that the war is just a vehicle for officers and senior NCOs to promote their careers, usually at the expense of the men serving under them. It really brings up the question for many who did serve in the Marine Corps at one time or another: now, why did I enlist into this all this tom foolery?
