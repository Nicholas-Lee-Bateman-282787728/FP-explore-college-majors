A better than average sci-fi drama, it had some interesting special effects, a good cast and interesting storyline. Unfortunately, it ran during the same season as Heroes and Lost and didn't have quite the character count or star quality that those shows did and I thiink it lost viewers because of that.

993127,A76YYKY2IKTH4,B000FOPPBA,A. Hutto,"[0, 0]","This is a show that gets extremely hit and miss. the show starts off with a simple enough yet interesting enough an average idea that should attract any alien movie/series fans. orange glowly things attack people in the water and if they are accepted they come back ""different"" as the show loves to call them as the later term hybrids seems to offend hybrids or ""different"" people. if rejected you end up with scars on your body....the one exception happens to the sheriffs daughter who gets rejected but suffers 0 scars because well women must look hot on TV at all times amirite guys???yea the show can do good parts such as the subtle plot the alien hybrids craft to take over....but then it can be extremely stupid. the characters turn on each and make up at a rate of every other scene. yes its explained normally but it gets annoying. their also seems to be entirely too much focus on mindless drama. it seems the characters cannot accept the overwhelming amount of evidence that they all see in front of their faces. also no one seems at all freaked out by this bodysnatchers thing going on. and its not until disc 5 where the son of one of these body snatchers blurts out NO YOU ARE NOT MY MOTHER ANYMORE. thats about as much as the show acknowledges that no these hybrids are not people like us. its ok the son makes up with mommy because again the characters flip-flop like a mad man on crack when it comes to whether they are angry with someone or not.the real inexplicable problems arise towards the final few episodes where the show suffers from the clear screw it we are cancelled syndrome lets just throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks. in one of these final episodes the two lead adult male characters take on a well trained army 2 vs 50 with no trouble. mind you the 50 are these hybrids. later a group of preganant hybrids(the offspring is revealed as the greatest threat they are all fearing) are inexplicably saved by one of these lead male characters and his ex-wife. why you ask? because we cant kill them. thats it. your threat to the entire earth is saved because killing is wrong. thats the excuse. the show ends on a major cliffhanger as well because screw proper wrap ups.there are other inexplicable thintgs before the final episodes. a man gets his arm grown back after getting changed in the water. the sheriff tells him to cut it back off because people fear change. so he does. this takes no more than 3 minutes of persauding which is just alarming. he then gets pissed off at the sheriff after wards. then forgives the man. the source of his anger is he thought the sheriff was a God believing Christian. not ya know the fact he was an idiot and chainsawed off his own arm with no sedatives at all.the women however are just downright stupid. they all want their husband home at all times. whats that honey? stopping aliens? thats nice dear WHY ARENT YOU HOME??? oh mr. husband sheriff you locked up that mad serial rapist you say? well i am pissed because you did not call me like you said you would. one blurts out she is preganent 6 times an episode and when not blurting this out she is holding her belly or touching it or her husband mentions she is preganent or some other character does the honor of saying it. the other lead female adult mother despite being a hybrid insists repeatedly she is still the mother of her children. in the last episode a deranged gun man is persuaded to not go in insane by the ramblings of a 7 year old girl because absolutely screw logic because she says his now changed mother is still mommy just different....NO YOU FOOLS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHANGED DIE. this is established repeatedly in the show. all the main characters know it. these people die. they take over your body....make a brand new copy of it and dispose of the old one in the water which we are shown repeatedly. the characters all know this. in fact you are even treated to one that didnt finish attacking and taking over and you see a multilated unfinished hybrid. again these things kill you. speaking of the half dead unfinished one....the main characters it visits and dies on...in the next episode or later in the same episode i cant remember. they decide lets go bug my ex-wife to run DNA tests on....yet completely ignore their dead hybrid they had last night???? seriously???despite this the acting is solid. the sheriff does his part well. the consipiracy theory guy truly looks and plays the role. everyone acts well and the story is told well enough its just nothing happens by the end. and there is erractic plothole filled writing through and through. if nothing some of the writing is laughably bad at points. but its biggest fault is it REPEATS ITSELF. i dont need to hear im pregnant every 5 minutes. i dont need to hear a divorced couple fighting over the kids every 5 minutes...speaking of that they flip flop repeatedly. one second they are going to kill each other the next they arent. speaking of laughably bad moments one actor shoots her one ally for no reason at all. none. not one reason. its so bad and random its hilarious.one phrase i repeated a lot while watching....""this wouldnt be a problem if you werent such a female dog""....and thats this show in a nutshell. hilarious at times. interesting at others. and just randomly insane with bad writing in others. and the female characters repeatedly without fail act like ""female dogs"" and create mindless drama over the stupidest of things and get in the way constantly. they serve as nothing more than drama queens.for 15 and under have at it. anything more and dont bother. it has aliens invasion of the body snatchers going for it. orange glowy things. hurricanes. terrible plots that are laughable yet genious in other areas. and a good few twists and turns.",2,invasion of the body snatchers...NOW WITH PLOTHOLES!!!!,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,5785,"['show', 'extremely', 'hit', 'show', 'off',

Although the story line did remind me of the Invasion of The Body Snatchers there was still a great deal of the story line/plot that was original that keep me sitting on the edge of my seat.  I am looking forward to Season 2 (am actually searching for it).  I would recommend this to any sci-fi/drama/action buff as they tha all rolled into one.  A great cast some with familiar actors and some new ones. Rose was a delight as one of the youngest where I have seen her before I can't place her.  What is great about is you never know who is taken by the aliens and who isn't.  I truly miss guessed on a few of the towns people; saddened to discover others weren't taken.  I wish I had Season 2 as Season 1 left me wanting more at a great ending point of the story.

993129,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B000FOPPBA,Alric the Red,"[10, 17]","About five episodes into INVASION, it became obvious that the writers were making it up as they went along.  The role of the sheriff changed slightly, from more insidious to someone more sympathetic.  To me, this suggests that the enemy wasn't clearly outlined in producer Shaun Cassidy's imagination.  He had a PREMISE -- that something was taking over a Florida town, and that it had something to do with water, and that the government might have something to do with it -- but it was just a list of intriguing, atmospheric SOMETHINGS, with no fully visualized outcome.  By the end, not even Cassidy knew what or who the invader was, and he was hoping these essential details to be revealed to him during some flash of inspiration.  The constant dragging out of revelations -- and none of them decidedly revelatory -- added to the notion that Cassidy was stalling for the epiphany that never came.  Instead he settled for inserting ANYTHING into the mix, one creepy thing after the other, forever suggesting possibilities to keep interest in his premise alive, and seemingly never looking back at what had previously occurred.  Development was exchanged for a procession of dalliances and deadends.  By the season finale, nothing about anything was revealed.  Not even the sheriff knew anymore who or what he was.Cassidy did the same thing with AMERICAN GOTHIC, which fizzled instead of ending, and the final episode was hastily thrown together without resolution.  When I learned during the pilot episode for INVASION that Cassidy was producer and creative mind behind it, I was only mildly disappointed; MILDLY because what worked in AMERICAN GOTHIC worked so well, Cassidy could be forgiven for what might have been beyond his control.  But he's done this twice now, bespeaking more of HIS limitations and lack of respect for his audience.  The man can put forth a great idea, but he is unable to see it to its conclusion.  Perhaps he  should be advised that the first step is to lay out the entire premise.  Not an episode-per-episode plot synopsis, but at least a strong outline from which the team of writers can not stray.  Never lose sight of the inevitable, that ALL series must come to an end.  When the axe comes, the finale will be ready to go, putting the series to rest with an honest conclusion.  Then when it's over, Cassidy can repackage it all as a completed series, perhaps for years to come, perhaps to an ever expanding audience; instead of the finale reflecting a lazy effort that treated the audience as rubes, exploiting their expectations without ever delivering.  Never again, Mr. Cassidy.  Never again.

My favorite shows are Dexter, The Wire, Battlestar Galactica and Rockford Files (when David Chase writes them) - so that's where I'm coming from. I would put this right up there with them. The narrative is strong and is full of twists and turns. It also keeps moving. I agree with the slow start, but there is very little fat on this. Unlike Lost, which is full of gratuitious story telling to chew up episodes, this never loses its way. I found myself even becoming disturbed by it - which says a lot.Having read a lot into the Cambrian period and various theories on evolutionary ""jumps,"" I thought they handled the whole back story with incredible deftness. My only objection was that an evolutionary superior species would be more spiritually or rationally endowed instead of just physically so. The writers behind Invasion seem to be suggesting the contrary - that these ""aliens"" are an invasive specie with no soul, and are only restrained by their ""human"" half in the case where this human half is strong enough to resist the pull of the aliens. So the hybrids who's human halfs possess a strong moral or religious center (like the priest and the deputy or the Doctor) are more capable of resisting the evil the aliens unleash. This is the part I found disturbing because it really does suggest that advances in evolution need not be advances in spirituality, etc., which basically means the human racce is screwed. It's a very cynical, Darwinian outlook, but also one that is very plausible.

993144,AYHDKBFFAFEJU,B000FOPPBA,C. Martin,"[2, 3]","I came across this series in the local library. I do not recall it being on television...probably because it lasted but one season.There were a lot of sub-plots that were left hanging, that I was forced to wonder if they may have gone somewhere if the series had been continued beyond one season.Basically the show is built on the idea that alien life forms have invaded the human species in the form of glowing, orange sting-rays that come down in massive shooting-star like fashion during hurricanes. These glowing sting-rays have invaded the small town of Homestead Florida, totally disrupting one dysfunctional family made up of the Sheriff (Tom), his doctor wife (Mariel), the doctor wife's x-husband/park ranger (Russ), his new wife/news reporter (Larkin), her blog-writing brother (Dave), and three children belonging to the couples (Kira, Jesse, Rose). These people seem to be the only ones aware that glowing orange sting-rays have taken over the bodies of town-members.There are some really annoying reminders thrown in every other scene or so, as if we may have forgotten that Larkin is pregnant. Her character feels the need to blurt it out in turret's style fashion every few phrases or so, ""I'm a pregnant woman!"". All throughout the season there are blatant hints that the ""offspring"" of the EBE's (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities...which is a phrase I'm afraid will never replace the simple ""E.T.s"" of Speilberg's brain) are the REAL THREAT to the human race....by the way, the series ends before we ever meet the off spring of said EBE's.Despite the little annoyances of sub-plots gone no where, the series was just beginning to take shape and start to get really interesting when it was cancelled at the end of season 1....with a huge cliff-hanger to leave those of us who are some-what twisted and occult-like in our enjoyment of the absurd, feeling betrayed and confused, when Larkin, our ""I'm a pregnant woman!""-shouting supporting actress is tossed into the water for the glowing sting-rays to do with as they deem appropriate. We'll never know if she became a ""hybrid"" (which the show took the time to remind us in one episode, is NOT the car, but the combination of glowing sting-rays and human DNA) or if she was spit back onto land...and what happened to the baby she was carrying that had become the subject of constant reminders throughout the entire series, at least 6 times each episode? And what happened to the ""litter"" of offspring the hybrid women were apparently carrying....and I'm sure the series was leading toward the idea of a hybrid (Lewis) becoming sexually involved with young Kira at some point.The main focus of the series was the offspring, yet we'll never know whether they're taking over the world as we know it or not.My advice---watch out for glowing orange sting-rays falling out of the sky during huricanes!Enjoy this series, though....but I wouldn't buy it.

993145,A1MVI2NUINF6WE,B000FOPPBA,Copperfield,"[1, 1]","I cannot recommend this series more highly. ""Invasion"" was a breakthrough series- great drama, terrific full-blooded characters, suspense, imagination, emotion and humor. It was also sci-fi, and apparently that was its doom. Too many viewers assumed that a sci-fi series would be tacky and never even gave it a try. They were so wrong. This particular sci-fi story did not involve Klingons and ""Beam me up, Scotty."" It's more like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" where you are dealing with human beings only, but humans who begin to change. The pace and suspense of the story are fantastic. What's most frustrating is that the cancellation of the series meant there was essentially no ending- it ran a full season, stopped on a cliffhanger episode and then never came back. So go into it knowing that. The writing for this series and the casting end up with some of the most compelling characters I've ever seen in a show. The little girl Rose is irresistible and never hackneyed. You can't take your eyes off the blond doctor heroine (whose name I've forgotten- sorry)- she's fascinating and beautiful. Her brother is an oddball unemployed beer guy- very funny and you attach to him instantly. Her husband Tom is probably one of the best ""villains"" I've ever seen because you keep changing your mind about him- Is he good? Is he bad? Is he both?! Can he be trusted? The sci-fi aspect involves lights that fall into the water during a terrible hurricane. Anyone who goes into the water after that is ""infected"" by these lit-up entities. People still look the same, most act basically the same, but they are only carbon copies of their real selves which perished in the water. They've been taken over by the entities.

993148,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000FOPPBA,Cubist,"[20, 21]","Poor Shaun Cassidy. If he didn't have bad luck he'd have no luck at all. In 1995, he created American Gothic, a creepy supernatural drama for network television that was unable to garner decent enough ratings to stay on the air. In 2005, he returned with Invasion, a contemporary spin on Invasion of the Body Snatchers and was one of several genre shows that capitalized on the success of Lost. It was smart and scary so, of course the network cancelled it.Invasion is the kind of show that calls for a subtle kind of acting as characters have to appear normal while also having a certain look in their eyes that suggests something is not quite right. As a result, cryptic phrases take on a whole new meaning as we try to figure out who has been infected (for lack of a better phrase) by the aliens and who is still a 100% human.The always watchable William Fichtner is excellent as the town sheriff. He seems a bit of a cold fish right from the start which makes you wonder if he has already been taken over by an alien before the hurricane even happened and future episodes elaborate on this point. But Fichtner's performance, the odd looks and things that he says, keep us constantly guessing as to the degree in which his character has been infected and the actor plays it so well. He is the master at being the calm yet menacing type and this is what makes Tom so unsettling at times.Invasion aired right around the time of Hurricane Katrina and the clean-up and reaction to it is eerily mirrored on the show albeit with a science fiction spin. The writers effectively establish the cast of characters and their relationship to one another. They took advantage of the medium to flesh them out so that we become emotionally invested in the characters' lives.The show works on several levels using its science fiction premise to comment on the differences between economic classes while also telling a good old fashion mystery as Russell uncovers evidence of an alien presence. Like Lost, when Invasion answers one of its key plot questions, two more are raised in its place. Just when you have a character figured out, they do or say something that makes you question your assumptions. Sadly, we probably will never find out how all the various storylines would have played out as Invasion was cancelled after only one season. Out of the crop of new SF/horror shows from last year, it was the best. Hopefully, this DVD set will expose more people to this excellent show.""Invading the Mind of Shaun Cassidy"" explores the themes that run through the show with the cast and crew gushing about how much they loved his ideas. Everyone touches upon the show's mythology and clarifies a few things that were deliciously ambiguous in the show with Cassidy claiming that Invasion was not about alien invasion but human evolution.Also included is a ""Gag Reel,"" a collection of amusing outtakes and blown lines.Finally, there are deleted scenes for 13 episodes.",5,Cancelled Before Its Time,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2954,"['Poor', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'luck', ""'d"", 'have', 'luck', '1995', 'created', 'American', 'Gothic', 'creepy', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'network', 'television', 'was', 'unable', 'garner', 'decent', 'enough', 'ratings', 'stay', 'air', '2005', 'returned', 'Invasion', 'contemporary', 'spin', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'genre', 'shows', 'capitalized', 'success', 'Lost', 'was', 'smart', 'scary', 'so', 'course', 'network', 'cancelled', 'it.Invasion', 'kind', 'show', 'subtle', 'kind', 'acting', 'characters', 'have', 'appear', 'normal', 'also', 'having', 'certain', 'look', 'eyes', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'result', 'cryptic', 'phrases', 'take', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'been', 'infected', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'aliens', 'who', 'still', '100', '%', 'human.The', 'always', 'watchable', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'excellent', 'town', 'sheriff', 'bit', 'cold', 'fish', 'right', 'start', 'wonder', 'already', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'alien', 'hurricane', 'even', 'happened', 'future', 'episodes', 'elaborate', 'point', 'Fichtner', 'performance', 'odd', 'looks', 'things', 'keep', 'constantly', 'guessing', 'degree', 'character', 'been', 'infected', 'actor', 'so', 'well', 'master', 'being', 'calm', 'yet', 'menacing', 'type', 'what', 'Tom', 'so', 'unsettling', 'times.Invasion', 'aired', 'right', 'time', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'clean-up', 'reaction', 'eerily', 'mirrored', 'show', 'science', 'fiction', 'spin', 'writers', 'effectively', 'establish', 'cast', 'characters', 'relationship', 'one', 'took', 'advantage', 'medium', 'flesh', 'out', 'so', 'become', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'characters', 'lives.The', 'show', 'several', 'levels', 'using', 'science', 'fiction', 'premise', 'comment', 'differences', 'economic', 'classes', 'also', 'telling', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'mystery', 'Russell', 'uncovers', 'evidence', 'alien', 'presence', 'Lost', 'when', 'Invasion', 'one', 'key', 'plot', 'questions', 'two', 'more', 'are', 'raised', 'place', 'Just', 'when', 'have', 'character', 'figured', 'out', 'do', 'say', 'something', 'question', 'assumptions', 'Sadly', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'various', 'storylines', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'Invasion', 'was', 'cancelled', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'crop', 'new', 'SF/horror', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'best', 'Hopefully', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'expose', 'more', 'people', 'excellent', 'show', 'Invading', 'Mind', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'themes', 'run', 'show', 'cast', 'crew', 'gushing', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'ideas', 'Everyone', 'show', 'mythology', 'few', 'things', 'were', 'deliciously', 'ambiguous', 'show', 'Cassidy', 'claiming', 'Invasion', 'was', 'not', 'alien', 'invasion', 'human', 'evolution.Also', 'included', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'collection', 'amusing', 'outtakes', 'blown', 'lines.Finally', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', '13', 'episodes']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

This is a great series, right up to the point where ABC kicks us in the teeth and says 'so long, suckers'. It starts almost drearily slow, and almost lost me in the first few episodes, but I stuck with it. There is a level of depth and complexity to the writing that's worth waiting for and once it becomes clear whats going on, all the dreary slowness clears away. All of the episodes flow together seemlessly.What I found most amusing is Dave, the alien conspiracy nut, who is the only one who really sees what's going on for what it is - and eventually even he concedes that the 'pod people' seem pretty normal. The female characters in the series are generally inane and annoying with an addiction to overacting and an aversion to following directions, but generally the cast does a good job in helping us suspend disbelief.However, had I fully realized what a collosal tease this show would end up being, I probably wouldn't have watched it.

993150,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B000FOPPBA,Danno,"[0, 0]","Are you looking for intelligently written, character driven science-fiction? If you are, ""Invasion"" is an excellent choice. The short-lived TV series survived for just a single season in 2005-2006, but had ideas - and talent - enough for a multi-year run. While none of the actors and actresses in the series are household names (probably the best-recognized is character actor is William Fichtner, who plays antihero Sheriff Tom Underlay), all are extremely capable and believable in their roles. Unlike a lot of science-fiction TV series, it wasn't written and marketed exclusively to a teen audience and although some elements of the show are reminiscent of ""The X-Files,"" the program never settled into a ""Freak of the Week"" holding pattern between story arcs. These two factors make a lot of demands on the audience's attention span, and it's no surprise that ""Invasion"" plays much better on DVD than when it was on TV. (Personally, I gave up on the show back then because I missed a couple of episodes and couldn't catch up on the plot. I think my experience was a fairly common one.)""Invasion"" is the sort of TV show that is extremely sensitive to spoilers, so I won't reveal too much about the plot except the very bare bones. In the aftermath of a hurricane, the some of the residents of a small Florida town start behaving very strangely in ways varying from subtle to extreme. Some claim that unexplained lights appeared in the sky right around the time of the hurricane, but what really happened? And why can't any of the recovered ""survivors"" remember exactly what happened to them why they were missing. The story echoes ""The Tommyknockers"" in spots, as well as the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and even good old H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Shadow over Innsmouth"" but it really speaks to our own post 9/11 disaster culture more than anything. There's a creeping sense of dread and desperation throughout these episodes, which makes the few sudden shocks stand out even more. This is definitely a TV series designed to appeal to thinkers, and it holds up well upon multiple viewings, because it's often quite subtle.Unfortunately, the DVD set lacks some features that we often take for granted. There are no foreign language soundtracks, and while Spanish, French, Portuguese, and even Chinese are included as subtitles there are no English subtitles. Extras are minimal - just a few deleted scenes and a very brief promo tagged onto the 6th disc. There are no commentary tracks (a true letdown), no post-season cast interviews, and no adjunct materials such as the original Hurricane Katrina disclaimer that originally appeared with the pilot episode. Yes, I know that ""Invasion"" was dumped by ABC and therefore isn't considered a marquee-quality series, but I do think that the series deserved a better DVD release. It always irritates me when some series are given DVD releases that are overflowing with extras and some are not. This is definitely an overlooked series that deserved a bit more love in the DVD release, but I did not detract points for this.",5,One of the Best Science-fiction TV series - EVER,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,3080,"['Are', 'looking', 'intelligently', 'written', 'character', 'driven', 'science-fiction', 'are', 'Invasion', 'excellent', 'choice', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'survived', 'just', 'single', 'season', '2005-2006', 'had', 'ideas', 'talent', 'enough', 'multi-year', 'run', 'none', 'actors', 'actresses', 'series', 'are', 'household', 'names', 'probably', 'best-recognized', 'character', 'actor', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'who', 'antihero', 'Sheriff', 'Tom', 'Underlay', 'are', 'extremely', 'capable', 'believable', 'roles', 'lot', 'science-fiction', 'TV', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'marketed', 'exclusively', 'teen', 'audience', 'elements', 'show', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'X-Files', 'program', 'never', 'settled', 'Freak', 'Week', 'holding', 'pattern', 'story', 'arcs', 'two', 'factors', 'make', 'lot', 'demands', 'audience', 'attention', 'span', 'surprise', 'Invasion', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'Personally', 'gave', 'up', 'show', 'back', 'then', 'missed', 'couple', 'episodes', 'could', ""n't"", 'catch', 'up', 'plot', 'think', 'experience', 'was', 'fairly', 'common', 'one', 'Invasion', 'sort', 'TV', 'show', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'very', 'bare', 'bones', 'aftermath', 'hurricane', 'residents', 'small', 'Florida', 'town', 'start', 'behaving', 'very', 'strangely', 'ways', 'varying', 'subtle', 'extreme', 'claim', 'unexplained', 'lights', 'appeared', 'sky', 'right', 'time', 'hurricane', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recovered', 'survivors', 'remember', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'were', 'missing', 'story', 'Tommyknockers', 'spots', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'even', 'good', 'old', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'Shadow', 'Innsmouth', 'really', 'own', 'post', '9/11', 'disaster', 'culture', 'more', 'anything', 'creeping', 'sense', 'dread', 'desperation', 'episodes', 'few', 'sudden', 'shocks', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'definitely', 'TV', 'series', 'designed', 'appeal', 'thinkers', 'up', 'well', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'often', 'quite', 'subtle.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'set', 'features', 'often', 'take', 'granted', 'are', 'foreign', 'language', 'soundtracks', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Portuguese', 'even', 'Chinese', 'are', 'included', 'subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'just', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'very', 'brief', 'promo', 'tagged', '6th', 'disc', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'true', 'letdown', 'post-season', 'cast', 'interviews', 'adjunct', 'materials', 'such', 'original', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'disclaimer', 'originally', 'appeared', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Yes', 'know', 'Invasion', 'was', 'dumped', 'ABC', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'considered', 'marquee-quality', 'series', 'do', 'think', 'series', 'deserved', 'better', 'DVD', 'release', 'always', 'when', 'series', 'are', 'given', 'DVD', 'are', 'overflowing', 'extras', 'are', 'not', 'definitely', 'overlooked', 'series', 'deserved', 'bit', 'more', 'love', 'DVD', 'release', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'points']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

Also the scenes where the little 6-year-old girl is acting. The rest of the cast was poorly selected. The producers failed to ensure there was continuality in the series and they failed to have a military coordinator help them. The Sheriff claims to have been a CAPTAIN in the Air Force but all the scenes of him in uniform are as a LIEUTENANT COLONEL. He also tells a female colonel he retired a MAJOR--again he was shown as a LIEUTENANT COLONEL.The credibility of the series fails. The military would not KNOW about an invasive species and then let a whole community fall prey; a park ranger would not run around unarmed for half the series with HIS family threatened; a sheriff and park ranger would not go after 100 armed adults with only a shotgun w/15 rounds and a pistol; the high school scenes go no where; giving Jessie a revolver--and then he never uses it ; the slamming door incident with the uncle where they use the SAME slamming door THREE times!; the sheriff being shot three times and heals in three days--yet his deputy's face takes weeks to heal; having the deputy cut off his arm with a chain saw--absolutely unrealistic and obviously the writer has never used a chainsaw! On and on...error after error.The writer does well when he writes scenes about what he KNOWS about--a dysfunctional his/hers/ours family and those scenes are a soap opera--but he totally fails when he writes about subjects he knows NOTHING about; military, killing, swamps, weapons.The worse part is trying to sell the viewer on the high-breeds are good creatures and they let pregnant humans be taken by them!

Veracity ""Mac Guy""","[0, 0]","The review on the box says """"As well written, well acted, and intensely focused a piece of television as you'll find anywhere on the tube.""  Ellen Gray, Philadelphia Daily News.Ellen was very gracious but I have to offer an example of why I disagree with her assessment.After reading the reviews, I got this ""Complete Series"" for $6 and it's worth that.  The show has quite a few good actors but the acting is a bit too melodramatic for me.  Overall however, it's a good sci-fi idea and soap opera.  I know others will find this nit picky, but it's about the writing and lack of focus that got to me.  Here is a small example/spoiler for one episode - a character turns off a main road thinking they're being followed and ends up flipping their car, then they are ""trapped by a seatbelt buckle release malfunction"" - yeah right - how trite can you get. One might slip out of a seat belt - but then I guess the seat belt tensioners are broken too - Murhy's Law I guess.  All the while their hand held radio is just inches out of reach as the other spouse is calling to check on their whereabouts.  After an ample of amount of writhing about, the character knocks the mirror off the windshield and breaks it to cut themselves out - then kicks the front window out with their foot (again if you could get your foot up over the dash, I would have thought they had room to just slip out of the seatbelt)..at any rate, all the while their hand held radio is just inches out of their reach.  So I'm wondering why not use the mirror to rake the radio toward you??!?!.BUT THEN, mysteriously the vehicle moves to slightly deeper water implying they're in even more danger...(you can't miss the mystery because the music cues are so obvious, there's no doubt when to clinch for the ""action""...anyway, they managed to get out of the vehicle and apparently leave the radio behind - this time however, no mystery music as they forget the radio or lonely/sorrowful music cue as the radio is left behind.Fortunately the spouse had been wondering about where their loved one is and went out to find them...and find them they did in short order.  ALL of Florida, ALL of the Everglades and the sleuthful Park Ranger happens across a back road where the missing spouse's vehicle is found upside down and empty.  As they leave this scene - the characters and a cop are the only ones on site and when they leave to the left of the scene, on the right side of the screen is another person fumbling around in the background...haha  off road middle of Everglades and hey, no one noticed the guy in the background?!?!BUT then there's the glaring issue of the missing spouse involved in the accident.  That person could have simply went back up the ROAD they came down, after all the other spouse and cop just came down that very road, BUT apparently the dazed and confused spouse goes fumbling through the Everglades to be picked up and and and so the story goes...aye yai yai it's just so unbelievable at times and better writing would not leave you wondering WHY!!!...

Result: unfortunate cancellation.""Invasion"" is a lot likeSurface - The Complete Seriesand the much more popular/longer-livedLost - The Complete First Seasonin that it builds mystery over a long series of episodes, drawing you in, answering some questions while giving rise to others.  If you like a well-spun science-fiction yarn with a lot of characters, then ""Invasion"" is probably a show you should check out.  Bear in mind, however, that the ""series"" is 22 episodes long (i.e. one TV season) and that you'll be both intrigued and dissatisfied at the end of episode 22 because that's it, no more ""Invasion.""Although ""Invasion"" generally has great special effects, there's an episode where the park ranger (Russell) and his brother-in-law (Dave) infiltrate the aliens' island hideaway.  At some point, they get their mitts on a radio and call in the Coast Guard.  What ensues is one of the most surrealistic (i.e. fake-looking) scenes I've had the displeasure of witnessing in a recent TV show, particularly in one where the effects are usually great.  There's also another scene where an alien claws a dead body off the beach.  The alien looks fine, the beach looks fine, the dead body looks fine, the water looks fine, but the mixture of them is poor.  The problem with these scenes seems to stem from a bright-blue white-cloud background, a watery midground and a sandy foreground, the last of which usually has a human being or two in it.  For the aforementioned effects, I removed half a star from what is an otherwise five-star effort in episodic TV.Definitely worth a look for the science-fiction fan.",4,Fantastic show!

I've been too busy with college courses, work, and reading for my Degree path to enjoy much entertainment.  However, during Xmas Break, I experienced the first DVD in the ""Invasion"" series, and I was completely hooked.  I had to watch the entire series while I had the opportunity, then I also purchased the complete set.This is not just a Sci-Fi, action-packed, well-made and gripping story, but this is also a perfect series for anyone who has experienced alternative family situations.  The interplay between lovers and ex-lovers, the bonding and issues experienced by the children, and other basic daily family issues play out in a believable, realistic manner throughout the series.  As someone who has experienced even more complex family combining situations, and ex-lover becomes new lover's friend type of scenarios, I thoroughly grasped the stories within the story.  I believe this series is a realistic portrayal of modern relationships (with an Alien twist).As a long time X-Files fan, and a person who enjoys good Sci-Fi, I truly enjoyed and recommend this series.  I purchased this ASAP to add to my movie collection.  I've never seen anything quite like the ""Invasion"" series, but this conjured-up memories of X-Files, The Outer Limits, The Twilight Zone, and other great Sci-Fi series; yet ""Invasion"" is very modern and contemporary, with current social commentary.In a post-Katrina U.S., this series has tapped into the underlying worries of Global Warming, government issues, ""Conspiracy Theory"" and a host of other issues.  Basically, this series has something for everyone.I also recommend ""Invasion"" for people who are not interested in Sci-Fi, or the above genres, yet have experienced divorce, separation, the joining of families, and other modern (common) societal changes.  This would be an excellent series to purchase for teenagers who are experiencing parental divorce, ""see it isn't that bad...it could be worse...your step-mom could be an Alien!""",5,Outstanding series; Addictive and Exciting,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2045,"['series', 'grabbed', 'interest', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'been', 'too', 'busy', 'college', 'courses', 'work', 'reading', 'Degree', 'path', 'enjoy', 'much', 'entertainment', 'However', 'Xmas', 'Break', 'experienced', 'first', 'DVD', 'Invasion', 'series', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'had', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'had', 'opportunity', 'then', 'also', 'purchased', 'complete', 'set.This', 'not', 'just', 'Sci-Fi', 'action-packed', 'well-made', 'gripping', 'story', 'also', 'perfect', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'experienced', 'alternative', 'family', 'situations', 'interplay', 'lovers', 'ex-lovers', 'bonding', 'issues', 'experienced', 'children', 'other', 'basic', 'daily', 'family', 'issues', 'play', 'out', 'believable', 'realistic', 'manner', 'series', 'someone', 'who', 'experienced', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'family', 'combining', 'situations', 'ex-lover', 'new', 'lover', 'friend', 'type', 'scenarios', 'thoroughly', 'grasped', 'stories', 'story', 'believe', 'series', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'modern', 'relationships', 'Alien', 'twist', 'long', 'time', 'X-Files', 'fan', 'person', 'who', 'good', 'Sci-Fi', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', 'series', 'purchased', 'ASAP', 'add', 'movie', 'collection', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'Invasion', 'series', 'conjured-up', 'memories', 'X-Files', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'other', 'great', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'Invasion', 'very', 'modern', 'contemporary', 'current', 'social', 'commentary.In', 'post-Katrina', 'U.S.', 'series', 'tapped', 'underlying', 'worries', 'Global', 'Warming', 'government', 'issues', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'host', 'other', 'issues', 'Basically', 'series', 'something', 'everyone.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'Invasion', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'Sci-Fi', 'above', 'genres', 'yet', 'have', 'experienced', 'divorce', 'separation', 'joining', 'families', 'other', 'modern', 'common', 'societal', 'changes', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'series', 'purchase', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'experiencing', 'parental', 'divorce', 'see', ""n't"", 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'step-mom', 'could', 'be', 'Alien']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

I knew that going in, but I liked the premise, and when the price came down low enough, I snagged it (it helped me reach the $25 free shipping minimum).  Was it worth it?  For $8.49, you bet.  If I'd paid $40 for it, I'd have been a bit honked off.The premise of Invasion is aliens quietly invading a small town in Florida.  They're not little green men, but indeed come disguised as squid type creatures....or not disguised and they actually are like that.  They arrive years before the start of the series, but begin their 'attack' during and after a hurricane hits the town.  They take people over and essentially 'replace' them, though the person retains their memories and such.  That's the premise that Shaun Cassidy (American Gothic) and his people sold ABC, and they bought it.  The trouble was, all the creators had was a premise and some character ideas.The show revolves around a large extended family:  Sheriff Tom Underlay (William Fichtner), his wife Mariel (Kari Matchett), a local doctor.  Her ex-husband Russell Varon (Eddie Cibrian), their kids Rose and Jessie(Ariel Gade and Evan Peters), Russell's new wife Larkin (Lisa Sheridan), her brother Dave (Tyler Labine), and Tom's daughter Kira (Alexis Dziena).  Without spoiling anything, one of the main characters is already changed before the series starts, and another quickly thereafter, along with an increasing large swath of the town.  Essentially the show is about how the core characters react to the changes and the ramping up of the alien presence.  Again, I can believe that the network would finance a pilot, and pick it up.But from then on, the show veers off in a slew of directions, seemingly in random ways.  Characters are allies one second, enemies the next, and then allies again.  The Mariel and Russell characters, who appear to have been divorced for about five years, go all over the place with each other, while the predictable tension between Tom and Russell gets turned off and on like a light switch, depending on the need of the plot.  I'm sure the writers would correct me on this if they read it, but they literally seemed to be making up the plot from week to week, and on a show like this, that's not really a good plan.  Also, the pace was kind of slow, as in the first half of the season not a whole lot happened.  You can get away with this on the CW or cable, where ratings don't need to be quite as high, but Cassidy and company should have known better given that ABC was involved.The acting was........inconsistent at best, but never truly bad or unwatchable.  Fichtner was his usual self, dependable and reliable.  I first saw him on As the World Turns, so I'm sure he was used to his character shifting around like crazy, and it didn't seem to faze him.  Eddie Cibrian does not fare so well, as they wanted to make him the action hero of the story, only with dramatic moments, and he just couldn't pull it off.  He did the requisite stupid things that any action hero is forced to do, but rarely ever had to pay for his mistakes.  The wives were better off, kind of, but all too often were given the cliched roles of the worried wives who just want their hubbies to be home for their families.  I did like how Matchett and Sheridan interacted with the kids though, a definite strength.  Tyler Labine played a softer version of the Sock character he would later play on Reaper, so this was a nice warmup for him.  Dave was a alien conspiracy nut before this, so these events were seemingly right in his wheelhouse, but he also was a great uncle to his step-nieces and nephew, and could be counted on.  The kids were a strange lot, the little girl Rose got the best lines and scenes of the three, while Evan Peters seemed to have one facial expression only, but it must have been what they wanted, as they gave his character more to do as the season went on.  The Kira character started off as the typical pretty girl type, but of course evolved, though not unbelievably.  Only Labine really got a bounce from the show, career-wise, though Fichtner didn't need one.The ending was one that indicated that the producers/writers either didn't know that the show was on the chopping block, or didn't care.  A lot of threads are hanging there, including a life or death moment........but they exist to be tied off in our minds, as ABC wouldn't do it for us.Is this show worth your money?  For less than $10, absolutely.  For much more, it depends on your disposable income I suppose.  Just go into this series with the knowledge that there's an end, but no conclusion.Three stars because of William Fichtner and Lisa Sheridan (for her incredible episode of The Mentalist).",3,Unrealized,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,4888,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ll"", 'know', 'now', 'Invasion', 'was', 'not', 'completed', 'way', ""'The"", 'Complete', 'Series',

It was sorta lame that during Lost, they'd be like the 4 star hit Invasion is next! When it was nothing compared to Lost. We constantly got reminded that the aliens like water. Their were tons of times where we see the blonde mother who became one of them, in the bathtub breathing under water. So it was like ""ok, we get it, they like water!!"".  While the main actor who plays Russel seems as if he went to Matthew Fox acting school. Everytime I saw him, I kept forgetting his name wasn't Jack. I found a lot of the acting dull too in the earlier episodes.However this show got a hell of a lot better by the time the finale came along. The acting even got better and I even started to love the characters. The finale gives us a great cliffhanger and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next in season 2 and the very next day I found out....it was CANCELED!!! So although this show got better and was actually turning into the four star hit they were talking about it's not coming back. I think the 10 p.m time slot after Lost is what did it in. After Lost being so gripping with each episode taking alot out of you, I always forgot their was even a show on after it. I think if next year they put Invasion on at 8:00 and Lost on at 9:00 then it could've done better. A lot of people don't even watch tv at 10 p.m. Anyway I really wanted to see what would happen next and because of stupid abc we never will!

993188,A35I428M5WAT5Q,B000FOPPBA,"Joseph Kohout Jr. ""The Art of War""","[1, 1]","My minor tribute to Mr. Cassidy aside and perhaps a 1/2-star is do the current hiatus in the TV schedule.  However, I really did enjoy this and thought that the drama actually gained momentum (respectfully disagreeing with other reviewers that thought the show peaked early).  The last 3-episodes were 5*Without offering any spoilers, what I most liked about the show was that there was a fair amount of ""gray"" and even when the sides were more clearly defined, there were both ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" in each camp.While the entire cast did workman like jobs, IMHO, the writing was better than the acting (again, respectfully disagreeing with some of the other reviewers) and with the exception of Rose (the youngest daughter, who did a great job), I felt that the script was tight enough to plug in and play.In summary, this was not one of those series that caused me to lose sleep, though it did keep me interested.

993194,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FOPPBA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 14]","Of the three alien invasion shows that debuted on network television in the fall of 2005, ""Invasion"" was the one that was hyped the most and for which the most success was predicted.  After all, ""Invasion"" had the advantage of airing on Wednesday night's after""Lost""on ABC.  To be fair, in the end ""Invasion"" did get to air all 22 of its first season episodes, while NBC's""Surface""only got 15 episodes on and""Threshold""filmed 14 episodes but only aired nine of them.  Now all three of the shows are available on DVD and all three proudly proclaim themselves to be ""The Complete Series,"" wearing their cancellations like badges of honor whether they deserve them or not.  All things considered, ""Invasion"" was my least favorite of the three, mainly because its story took the longest to develop.  Creator Shaun Cassidy was clearly thinking long-term and how to develop his mystery over the course for the first season, and certainly at the end of the year things were starting to get interesting.  But as far as I was concerned by then it was the proverbial too little, too late.The start of ""Invasion"" had the advantage of art imitation life as the fictional Hurricane Eve strikes Homestead, Florida, on the edge of the Everglades.  The show's characters are a pair of families related by divorce and remarriage.  The show's nominal hero is Russ Varon (Eddie Cibrian), a U.S. park ranger in the Everglades who has a new wife, Larkin Groves (Lisa Sheridan), who is not only a reporter but also happens to be pregnant with their first child.  Russ' ex-wife, Dr. Mariel Underlay (Kari Matchett), is a medical doctor who has recently remarried as well, this time to Sheriff Tom Underlay (William Fichtner).  The children of Russ and Mariel, Jesse (Evan Peters) and Rose (Ariel Gade), live with Tom and Mariel, along with Kira Underlay (Alexis Dziena), Tom's daughter from a previous marriage.  Completing the cast is Dave Groves (Tyler Labine), Larkin's brother, who watches the kids and apparently has an encyclopedic knowledge of conspiracy theories.Strange things happen to the characters when the hurricane strikes.  Rose sees lights coming down from the sky and landing in the water during the storm, while Mariel goes missing and is not found until the next day, at which point she is naked and remembers nothing but is physically untouched by the hurricane.  Only now she likes to take really long baths and seems really into water.  Then Dave finds what he is convinced is the skeleton of an extraterrestrial and we continue to see strange lights in the water.  But it is the Sheriff, with his strange words of comfort for his disoriented wife, who turns out to be the pivotal member of the cast of characters.The strange lights in the water are an apt metaphor for ""Invasion,"" because here the threat is internal rather than external.  The show is much more in the tradition of""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""than any of the traditional alien invasion movies with their bug-eyed monsters.  The mystery is not easy to figure out, as amply proven when Mariel finds her own body floating in the swamp and we all leap to the obvious and apparently wrong conclusion.  But clues were being parceled out as almost as slowly as the revelations and in the absence of clear answers having clues to work over becomes even more important.In watching these episodes again the show certainly does make more sense, but I still see a strong beginning and a fairly strong ending, with things dragging on too much in the middle.  I have to think that if we did some serious editing of the middle third of ""Invasion"" that it would work a lot better.  It is not so much a question of omitting episodes as it is moving things along more quickly.  There was a point where the only reasons I kept watching ""Invasion"" was because it was one of the series I had cleared for the television unit for my class and because I was curious to see if it could free itself from the morass it was becoming (ironically, none of my students wrote about the show, but they used the course discussion board to try and figure out what was coming on, with limited success).Before I watched ""Invasion"" again from start to finish I was learning towards rating it three stars because I was so disappointed by it given my expectations.  I ended up with a four star rating because the second time around I was focusing on Tom and Mariel rather than Russ and Larkin, and this shift in perspective made a big difference.  Going higher was not an option because all fans are going to find here for special features are deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a featurette ""Inside the Mind of Shaun Cassidy.""  Not having any commentary tracks for those fans who were anguished by the cancellation of the show is extremely disappointing.  You can also better appreciate how the series does go against your expectations time and time again, which should be a good thing, but not if you are looking at the show the wrong way.  Whether this is your first or second (plus) time through ""Invasion,"" let Fichtner's Tom Underlay be your guide (Say, do you think the character's last name was suppose to be a clue or something?).",4,"Reconsidering ""Invasion: The Complete Series"" now that it is all over (but not done with)",1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,5167,"['three', 'alien', 'invasion', 'debuted', 'network',

This is the 22nd episode in a season full of brilliant, intelligent, fun and fierce pseudo-science fiction. It's more than that...INVASION is as much about family and the ever changing dynamic within two families as it is about the alien invasion that comes down in a hurricane in the form of lights and gradually takes over the small town of Homestead, Florida.The show stars William Fichtner as creepy but effective Sheriff Tom Underlay, a man who seems to know what is going on, but may not be as ""in the loop"" as he thinks. His wife is Dr. Mariel Underlay (Kari Matchett), a family woman and town physician suddenly thrust seemingly overnight into a cold, detached disillusionment. She doesn't know what's happened with those lights in the sky, but her kids don't recognize her anymore (not ""inside,"" anyway)...Eddie Cibrian is Mariel's former husband Russell Varon, a park ranger who has two kids with his ex-wife and is currently married to Larkin Groves (Lisa Sheridan), a local news reporter with whom Russ is expecting a third child...Those first two kids would be high-school-age Jesse (Evan Peters) and cute as a button 1st grader Rose (Ariel Gade). While Rose is wide-eyed with wonder over the events during and after the hurricane, concerned for her mother, confused by her sudden frequency of being missing, Jesse is growing increasingly paranoid - enough so to match his new uncle Dave (Tyler Labine), a conspiracy-theory-spouting blogger who is convinced (correctly) that some sort of alien force has come out of the sky in the cover of a hurricane and is plotting something...Whether Sheriff Tom (who Rose calls ""Daddy/Uncle Tom"") is behind this ""invasion"" is up for debate, but the shifting dynamic between the two families is only magnified by the increasingly erratic behavior of Tom's own daughter, Kira (Alexis Dziena from ""Broken Flowers""). She has never quite felt like she belonged, and the sudden ""invasion"" of her parents makes her feel less and less like she fits in...The season took a real turn when it was revealed that a man named Eli Szura (special guest star James Frain of ""Where the Heart Is..."" fame) was behind the impending alien invasion, knew more than anyone could've about the hurricane, the lights in the sky, etc., and that he had been working with Tom, only to go behind his back and take things way too far...Where it ends up is anybody's guess. Tonight is the season (series?) finale of ""INVASION"" entitled ""The Last Wave Goodbye"" (not a good sign), and yet it appears to end on a cliffhanger...INVASION is a huge hit with critics like TV Guide and seems to be the best-received new show of the season critically. I hope ABC renews it, but that appears to have fallen through. Rumor has it that the new hybrid network the C/W (UPN/WB) will join forces to bring the show over to the new joint venture and that would be fantastic! What better way to watch a show about hybrids than on a hybrid network?!?",5,INVASION: Smart Sci-Fi!,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,3077,"['Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'INVASION', 'prepared', 'wrap', 'up', 'first', 'perhaps', 'only', 'season', '1', 'hour', 'finale', 'tonight', '10', 'pm', 'ABC', '22nd', 'episode', 'season', 'full', 'brilliant', 'intelligent', 'fun', 'fierce', 'pseudo-science', 'fiction', 'more', 'INVASION', 'as', 'much', 'family', 'ever', 'changing', 'dynamic', 'two', 'families', 'alien', 'invasion', 'down', 'hurricane', 'form', 'lights', 'gradually', 'small', 'town', 'Homestead', 'Florida.The', 'show', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'creepy', 'effective', 'Sheriff', 'Tom', 'Underlay', 'man', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'loop', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Mariel', 'Underlay', 'Kari', 'Matchett', 'family', 'woman', 'town', 'physician', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'seemingly', 'overnight', 'cold', 'detached', 'disillusionment', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'lights', 'sky', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'anymore', 'not', 'inside', 'anyway', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'Mariel', 'former', 'husband', 'Russell', 'Varon', 'park', 'ranger', 'who', 'two', 'kids', 'ex-wife', 'currently', 'married', 'Larkin', 'Groves', 'Lisa', 'Sheridan', 'local', 'news', 'reporter', 'whom', 'Russ', 'expecting', 'third', 'child', 'first', 'two', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'high-school-age', 'Jesse', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'cute', 'button', '1st', 'grader', 'Rose', 'Ariel', 'Gade', 'Rose', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'events', 'hurricane', 'concerned', 'mother', 'confused', 'sudden', 'frequency', 'being', 'missing', 'Jesse', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'enough', 'match', 'new', 'uncle', 'Dave', 'Tyler', 'Labine', 'conspiracy-theory-spouting', 'blogger', 'who', 'convinced', 'correctly', 'sort', 'alien', 'force', 'come', 'sky', 'cover', 'hurricane', 'plotting', 'something', 'Whether', 'Sheriff', 'Tom', 'who', 'Rose', 'Daddy/Uncle', 'Tom', 'invasion', 'up', 'debate', 'shifting', 'dynamic', 'two', 'families', 'only', 'magnified', 'increasingly', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'Tom', 'own', 'daughter', 'Kira', 'Alexis', 'Dziena', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'never', 'quite', 'felt', 'belonged', 'sudden', 'invasion', 'parents', 'feel', 'less', 'less', 'season', 'took', 'real', 'turn', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'man', 'named', 'Eli', 'Szura', 'special', 'guest', 'star', 'James', 'Frain', 'Where', 'Heart', 'fame', 'was', 'impending', 'alien', 'invasion', 'knew', 'more', 'anyone', 'could', ""'ve"", 'hurricane', 'lights', 'sky', 'etc.', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'Tom', 'only', 'go', 'back', 'take', 'things', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'Where', 'up', 'anybody', 'guess', 'Tonight', 'season', 'series', 'finale', 'INVASION', 'entitled', 'Last', 'Wave', 'Goodbye', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'yet', 'end', 'cliffhanger', 'INVASION', 'huge', 'hit', 'critics', 'TV', 'Guide', 'be', 'best-received', 'new', 'show', 'season', 'critically', 'hope', 'ABC', 'have', 'fallen', 'Rumor', 'new', 'hybrid', 'network', 'C/W', 'UPN/WB', 'will', 'join', 'forces', 'bring', 'show', 'new', 'joint', 'venture', 'would', 'be', 'fantastic', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'watch', 'show', 'hybrids', 'hybrid', 'network']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)
993204,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000FOPPBA,Marc Cabir Davis,"[2, 3]","""Invasion"", quite simply, is the best science fiction show ever created. Yes, even better than ""Battlestar Galactica"", ""Firefly"", or for those of you from the 1980s, ""V"". The only downside is that this show was not renewed for a second season, which is a pity, considering just how excellent the first season was.This DVD set contains all the Episodes from the First and only Season of ""Invasion"". You probably know the story already - but this is very, very different from any of the ""Body Snatchers"" themes you might have come across. In this version, lights from the sky fall down into the waterbodies in Southwest Florida, and anyone who steps near the water is 'reborn' as a biologically varied clone. Yes, there ARE aliens here, but they look more like squid. However, considering they come from another planet, their origins or intents are never properly explained. The end of the first season is a shocker - a primary characters' destiny is altered, and it is hinted that the Invasion by the Aliens is being supported by the Government itself.Thrown in a very good looking and talented cast, and you have a winner. Eddie Cibrian plays the lead role here, as a Park Ranger who has to deal with the madness around him, and protect his children and fiancee at the same time. The show is heavy on family drama, yet not for one second does it forget its a science fiction show. An equal dose of melodrama and sci-fi mystery are presented in every episode. What I found very surprising is how re-watchable every episode is. Replay Value ranks very highly when I make a DVD Purchase, so its a mercy to find that every episode of ""Invasion"" is worth watching again. Sorry, ""Firefly"" fans, I can't say the same for that series.What I liked about ""Invasion"", was also the fact that it never once teetered on ridiculous. A show of this sort could be so 'out there', that you might start disconnecting from the lead characters. Everyone here was so human and normal - and the child actors did a fantastic job in their roles. A coherent storyline marks every episode, and even though every episode is long (sometimes more than an hour a-piece), it is never boring.Watching this a few years post-cancellation, its evident this was a rare TV Show that was WAY ahead of its' time. Most people don't 'get' the show or the reason for its' cult success. I would say - trust your instincts and get this as a blind buy. You'll be thanking me for years to come.Five Stars.",5,The Series That Could Have Changed Science Fiction,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,2458,"['Invasion', 'quite', 'simply', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'ever', 'created', 'Yes', 'even', 'better', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Firefly', '1980s', 'V', 'only', 'downside', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'pity', 'considering', 'just', 'how', 'excellent', 'first', 'season', 'was.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'Episodes', 'First', 'only', 'Season', 'Invasion', 'probably', 'know', 'story', 'already', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'themes', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'version', 'lights', 'sky', 'fall', 'down', 'waterbodies', 'Southwest', 'Florida', 'anyone', 'who', 'water', ""'reborn"", 'biologically', 'varied', 'clone', 'Yes', 'ARE', 'here', 'look', 'more', 'squid', 'However', 'considering', 'come', 'planet', 'origins', 'intents', 'are', 'never', 'properly', 'explained', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'shocker', 'primary', 'characters', 'destiny', 'altered', 'hinted', 'Invasion', 'Aliens', 'being', 'supported', 'Government', 'itself.Thrown', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'talented', 'cast', 'have', 'winner', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'lead', 'role', 'here', 'Park', 'Ranger', 'who', 'deal', 'madness', 'protect', 'children', 'fiancee', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'heavy', 'family', 'drama', 'yet', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'forget', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'equal', 'dose', 'melodrama', 'sci-fi', 'mystery', 'are', 'presented', 'episode', 'What', 'found', 'very', 'surprising', 'how', 're-watchable', 'episode', 'Replay', 'Value', 'very', 'highly', 'when', 'make', 'DVD', 'Purchase', 'mercy', 'find', 'episode', 'Invasion', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'Sorry', 'Firefly', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'series.What', 'liked', 'Invasion', 'was', 'also', 'fact', 'never', 'once', 'teetered', 'ridiculous', 'show', 'sort', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'might', 'start', 'disconnecting', 'lead', 'characters', 'Everyone', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'human', 'normal', 'child', 'actors', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'roles', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'marks', 'episode', 'even', 'episode', 'long', 'sometimes', 'more', 'hour', 'a-piece', 'never', 'boring.Watching', 'few', 'years', 'post-cancellation', 'evident', 'was', 'rare', 'TV', 'Show', 'was', 'WAY', 'ahead', 'time', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", ""'get"", 'show', 'reason', 'cult', 'success', 'would', 'say', 'trust', 'instincts', 'get', 'blind', 'buy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thanking', 'years', 'come.Five', 'Stars']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

THEN, next episode another person falls in the water, comes back and the cycle continues, nothing new really happens in the first few episodes.The final episodes weren't that good either and very predictable, actually the whole show was predictable, i mean i knew where it was going from the start, ( people changing and being taken over by aliens, more and more join in and eventually aliens want to take over the world, hmmmmmm, i didn't see that coming ?! )Im not sure why fans like this show and keep asking for it to come back, if it were for me i wouldn't watch a second season of this show, and im glad there isn't another season, because it really sucked !There are several other shows that are far more superior to this boring show, ( examples include : x-files, millennium, miracles, 24, lost and battlestar galagtica )Actually, im very dissapointed in wasting my money on this show, if you haven't seen this, my advice is don't buy it and save your money, because it is not worth it .I gave it one star because of some good acting by some, and good sepcial effects, but overall, it is a failure.",1,"Not that good, unoriginal, i've seen better !",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,2120,"['Hi..I', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'invasion', 'few', 'days', 'back', 'i', 'saw', 'show', 'DVD', 'tell', 'truth', 'i', 'was', 'expecting', 'excellent', 'series', 'reading', 'positive', 'reviews', 'i', 'was', 'quite', 'dissapointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'fact', 'most', 'episodes', 'were', 'boring.No', 'wonder', 'been', 'canceled', 'had', 'potential', 'getting', 'better', 'soon', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'boring', 'unoriginal', '*', 'spoilers*First', 'i', 'thought', 'whole', 'idea', 'show', 'was', 'unoriginal', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'idea', 'many', 'many', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'examples', 'include', 'invasion', 'body', 'snatchers', 'faculty', 'actually', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'similar', 'movie', 'faculty', 'same', 'idea', 'whole', 'aliens', 'thier', 'preference', 'water', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'slowly', 'progressing', 'many', 'times', 'boring', 'nothing', 'really', 'one', 'episode', 'someone', 'water', 'back', 'changed', 'people', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'change', 'THEN', 'next', 'episode', 'person', 'water', 'back', 'cycle', 'nothing', 'new', 'really', 'first', 'few', 'episodes.The', 'final', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'very', 'predictable', 'actually', 'whole', 'show', 'was', 'predictable', 'i', 'mean', 'i', 'knew', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'start', 'people', 'changing', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'aliens', 'more', 'more', 'join', 'eventually', 'aliens', 'want', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'hmmmmmm', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'fans', 'show', 'keep', 'asking', 'come', 'back', 'were', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'im', 'glad', ""n't"", 'season', 'really', 'sucked', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'shows', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'superior', 'boring', 'show', 'examples', 'include', 'x-files', 'millennium', 'miracles', '24', 'lost', 'battlestar', 'galagtica', 'Actually', 'im', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'wasting', 'money', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'save', 'money', 'not', 'worth', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'sepcial', 'effects', 'overall', 'failure']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

993210,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000FOPPBA,Michael Butts,"[3, 6]","INVASION is a conundrum in some ways.  I watched the entire series over a five night period, and think that maybe this is one show that might have been more enjoyable watching on a weekly basis.  Viewing it all in an abbreviated showing only heightened the series problems:  it became tedious, repetetive, and often boring.  Shaun Cassidy is to be given credit for trying to take a singular plot line and extend it over 22 episodes, but that one plot line vacillated too much and the writers couldn't overcome the plot's limitations.During a Hurricane (Eve), something strange happens:  mysterious orange lights are seen falling into the waters in southern Florida's everglades area.  After the storm is over, some of the residents are acting rather peculiarly.  We learn soon tha extraterrestrial beings have ""taken over"" the bodies of some of the townsfolk, creating ""hybrid"" human/alien life forms.  We also learn that Sheriff Tom Underlay is one of these hybrids and he is trying to control the new species..for what purpose we don't know for a long time into the series.WHAT WERE THE ""CHANGES"" THE HYBRIDS EXPERIENCED?  Other than the fact that they can stay submerged under water for a long time (evidenced by the countless scenes of Mariel in her bathtub), and some possible other ""super powers' never fully explained, what were these changes?  That's at least for the ""good"" hybrids; but what about the ""bad"" ones, as evidenced in the sociopathic behavior of Christina, who abandons her baby, and then kills her mother in law, and sex-starved Derek, who ends up being Clyde to her Bonnie?  And what about the churchgoers who nearly beat a man to death who has come to pick up his wife after one of their ""survivor"" meetings, or the priest who turns to the gun for retribution?Writers also tried to turn initially villainous Tom into an almost beatified savior of sorts, most blatantly evidenced by Tom's actions in the last episode.  Tom's character obviously is one who wants control and expects every one to feel the way he does about the ""changes"".  On focusing on mainly the two families, we got repeat doses of Jesse's surliness and Rose's cuteness, and how Russell tries to juggle his two wives in order to protect the kids.  Involving more people might have made the series feel more vibrant and involving.  After a while, all the bickering between the two couples made me feel like I was watching DALLAS.  The decision to cancel the series without a wrap up episode is unforgivable.  For those fans who devotedly followed the series, they should be given at least a special tv movie or something to tie things together.INVASION looked good, with some nice camerawork and editing, and the performances were sharp:  William Fichtner brought a Clint Eastwood flintiness to his role as Tom; Kari Matchett did well as the hybrid Mariel, trying to be both a mother and wife in spite of her changes; Eddie Cibrian as Russell was heroically stalwart although as the series progressed, his character became more of an action hero type than a real character; Lisa Sheridan was effective as Russell's pregnant wife Lauren and Ariel Gade's Rose was realistically cute.

993217,A2TYXDI7PVCZ7M,B000FOPPBA,OathofDarkness,"[3, 3]","2005 was a bittersweet year for me regarding new television shows.  2005 produced four of my all-time favorite shows: Invasion, Surface, Threshold and Prison Break.  Unfortunately, all but Prison Break lasted only one season and it's a crying shame.  Earlier this week I finished watching Invasion for the third time and it gets better with every viewing, as I always pick up new details.  With this last viewing, I finally understand the deeper meaning of the show.  Many people may think the show is about an alien invasion, but it's not.  While there is that aspect of it, it's actually about evolution and the prolonging of the human race.  Aside from the show being extremely well written, the acting is what engages the viewer to connect with the show.  You care about them and almost get lost in everything they're saying because it feels so real.I once read that Invasion was supposed to run for five seasons.  It's sad to think that we only got about 20% of what Shaun Cassidy and crew wanted us to, but it is what it is.  I wonder what would have happened in the second season just for the fact that the end of season one (and the series) left us with such a huge cliffhanger.  It was almost as huge as the cliffhanger ending to Surface.  Speaking of the cliffhanger ending, I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed with the Invading the Mind of Shaun Cassidy special feature because they did not go into detail about the ending or what the audience could expect in following seasons, unlike the Threshold special features which told you what you could have expected.Overall, the show is phenomenal and well worthy of your time if you enjoy science fiction, deep character development and/or sociology .",5,We're Not at the Top of the Food Chain Anymore,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,1719,"['2005', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'year', 'regarding', 'new', 'television', 'shows', '2005', 'produced', 'four', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'Invasion', 'Surface', 'Threshold', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Unfortunately', 'Prison', 'Break', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'crying', 'shame', 'Earlier', 'week', 'finished', 'watching', 'Invasion', 'third', 'time', 'better', 'viewing', 'always', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'details', 'last', 'viewing', 'finally', 'understand', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'show', 'Many', 'people', 'may', 'think', 'show', 'alien', 'invasion', 'not', 'aspect', 'actually', 'evolution', 'prolonging', 'human', 'race', 'Aside', 'show', 'being', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'acting', 'what', 'viewer', 'connect', 'show', 'care', 'almost', 'get', 'lost', 'everything', ""'re"", 'saying', 'so', 'real.I', 'once', 'read', 'Invasion', 'was', 'supposed', 'run', 'five', 'seasons', 'sad', 'think', 'only', 'got', 'about', '20', '%', 'what', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'crew', 'wanted', 'what', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'second', 'season', 'just', 'fact', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'series', 'left', 'huge', 'cliffhanger', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'huge', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'Surface', 'Speaking', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'Invading', 'Mind', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'special', 'feature', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'ending', 'what', 'audience', 'could', 'expect', 'following', 'seasons', 'Threshold', 'special', 'features', 'told', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'expected.Overall', 'show', 'phenomenal', 'well', 'worthy', 'time', 'enjoy', 'science', 'fiction', 'deep', 'character', 'development', 'and/or', 'sociology']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

993219,AHF97M45JFCB,B000FOPPBA,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","Conclusion: My love for science fiction television leads me to some strange places.  What's that you say? Reports are supposed to start with a hypothesis and end with a conclusion?  Well in my defense, since the creators of Invasion weren't troubled with ending the series with any sort of conclusion, who says I should play by the rules in reviewing it?Okay that's a little harsh considering the reason Invasion never properly ends is that when the first (and only) season concluded, viewer ratings weren't strong enough to justify creation of a second season.  So it's got to be bad right? Well not really.  In fact of all the science fiction Lost can take credit for popularizing, (a list that includes Surface, Taken, Threshold, the 4400, Defying Gravity and so on) Invasion is actually one of the stronger entries.The story goes like this: During a hurricane that hits Florida, a bunch of strange lights emerge from the ocean. Several people go missing, only to wind up the following morning near the water, completely naked and with no memory of how they survived. Immediately following the bizarre phenomenon, the people of the small town of Homestead begin slowly transforming into hybrids presumably in connection with the orange lights and weird fish-like monsters that are showing up washed ashore in pieces and bits of flesh.Add a jovial but quickly dismissed unemployed blogger with a penchant for conspiracy theories, a creepy town sheriff, a few hormonally charged teens, the military and more schemes than the proverbial super-villain's underground lair and the formula is complete.Eventually it's accepted that the small Floridian town is the beachhead for an impending invasion of creatures, possibly extraterrestrial, that abduct people in the water and make perfect hybrid copies of them, with the possible purpose being to either offer the next step in evolution or extinction.The format is one fans of Lost will already know quite well: each 48-minute episode introduces new mysteries, answers a question or two but always ends on a cliffhanger.  Unlike Lost however, Invasion doesn't bury its viewers in new mysteries far more often than it solves old ones.  In fact, despite a few twists and turns, the plot of Invasion is surprisingly focused and coherent for this genre.The plot does tend to lean more heavily on the type of science fiction we associate with X-Files over say Star Trek and there's little doubt that the pacing most closely resembles that of a soap opera than a typical prime-time drama.So what we have here is essentially a horror-laced serial that runs 21-episodes without a definitive conclusion.  Besides, for a premise centered on an alien invasion, there really isn't much alien or invasion to be found here, rather innuendo, hypothesis and conspiracy theories.  Even still it's pretty safe to say the DVD box set is a worthy investment, especially during the winter months.  For one thing it can eat up a massive chunk of time- nearly 20-hours in fact (spread across 6 discs).  Secondly, while by no means revolutionary, the premise and delivery are strong enough to catch and hold most viewers' attention.  Finally those disappointed with the phenomenon that was Lost (a demographic that includes yours truly), Invasion offers a pretty intriguing alternative that isn't nearly as muddled or implausible.Of course when this set was initially released, the MSRP was a staggering $59.99.  At that price point, your money could definitely be better spent elsewhere however these days it seems the entire set can be picked up for under ten-bucks.  907-minutes of mystery/ action coupled to special features including: Missing scenes, ""Invading the Mind of Shaun Cassidy"" featurette & a gag reel, you really can't complain.Hypothesis: Is it possible blue haired women and hungry gators aren't the scariest residents of Florida after all?",3,Solid if a bit Formulaic,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,3881,"['Conclusion', 'love', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'strange', 'places', 'What', 'say', 'Reports', 'are', 'supposed', 'start', 'hypothesis', 'end', 'conclusion', 'Well', 'defense', 'creators', 'Invasion', 'were', ""n't"", 'troubled', 'ending', 'series', 'sort', 'conclusion', 'who', 'should', 'play', 'rules', 'reviewing', 'Okay', 'little', 'harsh', 'considering', 'reason', 'Invasion', 'never', 'properly', 'when', 'first', 'only', 'season', 'concluded', 'viewer', 'ratings', 'were', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'justify', 'creation', 'second', 'season', 'got', 'be', 'bad', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'fact', 'science', 'fiction', 'Lost', 'can', 'take', 'credit', 'popularizing', 'list', 'Surface', 'Taken', 'Threshold', '4400', 'Defying', 'Gravity', 'so', 'Invasion', 'actually', 'one', 'stronger', 'entries.The', 'story', 'hurricane', 'Florida', 'bunch', 'strange', 'lights', 'emerge', 'ocean', 'Several', 'people', 'go', 'missing', 'only', 'wind', 'up', 'following', 'morning', 'water', 'completely', 'naked', 'memory', 'how', 'survived', 'Immediately', 'following', 'bizarre', 'phenomenon', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'Homestead', 'begin', 'slowly', 'transforming', 'hybrids', 'presumably', 'connection', 'orange', 'lights', 'weird', 'fish-like', 'monsters', 'are', 'showing', 'up', 'washed', 'ashore', 'pieces', 'bits', 'flesh.Add', 'jovial', 'quickly', 'dismissed', 'unemployed', 'blogger', 'penchant', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'creepy', 'town', 'sheriff', 'few', 'hormonally', 'charged', 'teens', 'military', 'more', 'schemes', 'proverbial', 'super-villain', 'underground', 'lair', 'formula', 'complete.Eventually', 'accepted', 'small', 'Floridian', 'town', 'beachhead', 'impending', 'invasion', 'creatures', 'possibly', 'extraterrestrial', 'abduct', 'people', 'water', 'make', 'perfect', 'hybrid', 'copies', 'possible', 'purpose', 'being', 'offer', 'next', 'step', 'evolution', 'extinction.The', 'format', 'one', 'fans', 'Lost', 'will', 'already', 'know', 'quite', 'well', '48-minute', 'episode', 'introduces', 'new', 'mysteries', 'question', 'two', 'always', 'cliffhanger', 'Lost', 'however', 'Invasion', ""n't"", 'bury', 'viewers', 'new', 'mysteries', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'old', 'ones', 'fact', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'Invasion', 'surprisingly', 'focused', 'coherent', 'genre.The', 'plot', 'tend', 'lean', 'more', 'heavily', 'type', 'science', 'fiction', 'associate', 'X-Files', 'say', 'Star', 'Trek', 'little', 'doubt', 'pacing', 'most', 'closely', 'soap', 'opera', 'typical', 'prime-time', 'drama.So', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'essentially', 'horror-laced', 'serial', '21-episodes', 'definitive', 'conclusion', 'Besides', 'premise', 'centered', 'alien', 'invasion', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'alien', 'invasion', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'rather', 'innuendo', 'hypothesis', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'Even', 'still', 'pretty', 'safe', 'say', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'worthy', 'investment', 'especially', 'winter', 'months', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'eat', 'up', 'massive', 'chunk', 'time-', 'nearly', '20-hours', 'fact', 'spread', '6', 'discs', 'Secondly', 'means', 'revolutionary', 'premise', 'delivery', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'catch', 'hold', 'most', 'viewers', 'attention', 'Finally', 'disappointed', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'Lost', 'demographic', 'yours', 'truly', 'Invasion', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'alternative', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'muddled', 'implausible.Of', 'course', 'when', 'set', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'MSRP', 'was', 'staggering', '59.99', 'price', 'point', 'money', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'better', 'spent', 'elsewhere', 'however', 'days', 'entire', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'ten-bucks', '907-minutes', 'mystery/', 'action', 'coupled', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'Missing', 'scenes', 'Invading', 'Mind', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'featurette', 'gag', 'reel', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain.Hypothesis', 'possible', 'blue', 'haired', 'women', 'hungry', 'gators', 'are', ""n't"", 'scariest', 'residents', 'Florida']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

Its true that it did start kinda slow, but it sure caught its stride in a hurry. I think the biggest problem was the fact abc never gave much attention to the show, and then when they stopped showing it for awhile and substituted all those stupid shows mis season, that kinda cost the show, many people kinda lost interest in it during that time, and when it came back on, they had already found other shows to watch then.

The show was not renewed for a 2nd season so the DVD subtitled ""The Complete Series"" is, in fact true - 22 episodes which is all the 1st seasons shows.  The series tells the story of water based creatures (seeded from another planet?) that ""merge"" DNA with humans caught up in the aftermath of a Florida hurricane. The creatures appearance, origins, plans etc. are never explored but they are always a hovering presents - sometimes off stage - throughout each episode. The cloning effects are dramatized through two families in the semi-isolated town of Homestead Florida. The show was produced by Shaun Cassidy Productions and Warner Bros. Television.The shows should by watched in sequence since events are carried over from episode to episode.Pros:I watch the entire series over the period of several weeks - no marathon view feast for me. The science-fiction aspect of the show was subservient to the interactions of the two dysfunctional families both of which are affected by the mutant effects of the aliens. The creative talents did, in my estimation, an excellent job keeping family tensions and ""weirdness' in balance.Although filmed in California the extensive depictions of swamps and 'glades and a small town Florida in the far southern wetlands were very authentic.Cons:There were so many incredible coincidences in this series I was at a lost, and could only exclaim to my spouse ""unbelievable!""Packaging:The six DVD's are housed in a solid fan-fold case that slide in an external box. Each disk has a color picture of a principal actor. An excellent piece of packaging.Recommendations:This is a well acted off-beat SF series that appealed to me.

993231,A1CRQMP1MWUGDY,B000FOPPBA,Roger Shreeve,"[3, 3]","Mr. Shaun Cassidy (""American Gothic"") proves again his talent in screen writing and production.  INVASION provided an awesome soap opera serial without the soap or the opera.  Grounded in the fantasy of our imagination, it presented a plausible and intelligent script anchored by good actors and supported by an excellent production team.  INVASION was one of the reason why television was invented: entertainment.The premise is well worn-a twist of ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".  Nevertheless, it is the twist Mr. Cassidy provides that makes the show addictive.  However, the writing combined with a strong cast anchored by William Fichtner (The Sheriff), Eddie Cibrian (Russell), Kari Matchett (Mariel), Lisa Sheridan (Lisa), and Tyler Labine (Dave) take it a step above your average first season series.  An equally strong secondary cast with Evan Peters (Jesse), Ariel Gade (Rose), Alexis Dziena (Kira), Aisha Hinds (Mona Gomez) round out this amazing group.  Note: If you are wondering, yes--Alexis Dziena did portray the Lolita character in ""Broken Flowers"" and Bonnie in ""Joan of Arcadia"".So if you have looking to divest yourself of some money for quality television, than I suggest INVASION, but be warned of the series finale and it's cancellation.

Only just barely related to INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (in the sense of human bodies being replaced by alien replicas), the series revolved around a small Florida town in which a segment of the population had turned alien during a hurricane.  This premise allowed for alot of promising drama as families and friends had to deal with certain of their members being turned while others remained human.  To add suspense to the mix, the sheriff of the town was revealed from the get-go to be one of the lead aliens, along with his wife, while her EX-husband and family (including two children) remained human.  Furthermore, as the series unfolded, we learned that there were competing factions among the aliens, some peaceful and concerned for their safety from other aliens AND the military, while the other segment was violent and bent on world-domination (usually resulting in self-destructive behavior).  As for the rest of the drama and the many plot-points that arose along the way, you'll just have to watch to see for yourself.  Just bear in mind that this is the one and ONLY season the show will ever have (unless another network picks it up, which is unlikely).INVASION sadly got off to a slow start but by the time the mid-season finale was reached, everything was moving along nicely and the actors were beginning to fill their roles very nicely.  Early on, the sheriff and his wife established themselves as the anchor-actors and characters of the show, and they were the reason I came back and stayed faithful to the show for its second half.  But by the time the finale came, I had grown fond of ALL the actors and the characters they played.  It's just too bad that they won't get a second chance to carry on the story, because they had sown many seeds for a promising second season.What did the show in was not being able to capture the audience right away.  I myself didn't get past the first episode, but tuned in at about episode 10, and by then things had gotten VERY exciting - but most people never gave the show a second chance.  Let that be a lesson - taking your time with a story is a wonderful thing (despite what UK Ramsey said below in his anti-USA TV rant) - but you have to kick things off with enough of a bang to lock viewers in BEFORE you slow things down.  What Ramsey's comments reveal is a sad truth about today's viewing audience - people are just too scatter-brained to give a story time to unfold.  But hopefully, shows like LOST and INVASION will open the door for more series of the like that take their time and slow people down a bit.By the way - if you liked the show and are interested in trying to get it renewed on ABC or another network, buy the DVD set. In fact, pre-order it and show the suits that there is a large audience for this show that is willing to spend money on it!  $$$ is the only language the suits speak!!",4,Minus one star only for slow pacing at the beginning.,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2978,"['several', 'shows', 'have', 'tried', 'launch', 'LOST', 'lead-in', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'Only', 'just', 'barely', 'related', 'INVASION', 'THE', 'BODY', 'SNATCHERS', 'sense', 'human', 'bodies', 'being', 'replaced', 'alien', 'replicas', 'series', 'revolved', 'small', 'Florida', 'town', 'segment', 'population', 'had', 'turned', 'alien', 'hurricane', 'premise', 'allowed', 'alot', 'promising', 'drama', 'families', 'friends', 'had', 'deal', 'certain', 'members', 'being', 'turned', 'others', 'remained', 'human', 'add', 'suspense', 'mix', 'sheriff', 'town', 'was', 'revealed', 'get-go', 'be', 'one', 'lead', 'aliens', 'wife', 'EX-husband', 'family', 'including', 'two', 'children', 'remained', 'human', 'Furthermore', 'series', 'unfolded', 'learned', 'were', 'competing', 'factions', 'aliens', 'peaceful', 'concerned', 'safety', 'other', 'aliens', 'military', 'other', 'segment', 'was', 'violent', 'bent', 'world-domination', 'usually', 'resulting', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'rest', 'drama', 'many', 'plot-points', 'arose', 'way', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'Just', 'bear', 'mind', 'one', 'ONLY', 'season', 'show', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'network', 'up', 'unlikely', '.INVASION', 'sadly', 'got', 'off', 'slow', 'start', 'time', 'mid-season', 'finale', 'was', 'reached', 'everything', 'was', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely', 'actors', 'were', 'beginning', 'fill', 'roles', 'very', 'nicely', 'Early', 'sheriff', 'wife', 'established', 'anchor-actors', 'characters', 'show', 'were', 'reason', 'came', 'back', 'stayed', 'faithful', 'show', 'second', 'half', 'time', 'finale', 'came', 'had', 'grown', 'fond', 'actors', 'characters', 'played', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'second', 'chance', 'carry', 'story', 'had', 'sown', 'many', 'seeds', 'promising', 'second', 'season.What', 'did', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'capture', 'audience', 'right', 'away', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'episode', 'tuned', 'episode', '10', 'then', 'things', 'had', 'gotten', 'VERY', 'exciting', 'most', 'people', 'never', 'gave', 'show', 'second', 'chance', 'Let', 'be', 'lesson', 'taking', 'time', 'story', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'what', 'UK', 'Ramsey', 'said', 'anti-USA', 'TV', 'rant', 'have', 'kick', 'things', 'off', 'enough', 'bang', 'lock', 'viewers', 'BEFORE', 'slow', 'things', 'down', 'What', 'Ramsey', 'comments', 'reveal', 'sad', 'truth', 'today', 'viewing', 'audience', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'scatter-brained', 'give', 'story', 'time', 'unfold', 'hopefully', 'shows', 'LOST', 'INVASION', 'will', 'open', 'door', 'more', 'series', 'like', 'take', 'time', 'slow', 'people', 'down', 'bit.By', 'way', 'liked', 'show', 'are', 'interested', 'trying', 'get', 'renewed', 'ABC', 'network', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'fact', 'pre-order', 'show', 'suits', 'large', 'audience', 'show', 'willing', 'spend', 'money', 'only', 'language', 'suits', 'speak']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)

There is so much good to say about this Shawn Cassidy creation.  The show starts with an intriguing plot, mixes it with well developed characters, and blends in a magnificent setting to produce a wonderful TV show.  It is certainly not run of the mill sci-fi fare.  The quality and charm of the show entrance the viewer and brings those who watch it in into the world of INVASION.  The locations start to feel familiar while striking a balance with the slightly creepy premise.  Water is very prevalent in the show.  The rain, fog, and bogs all revolve around the central theme of the series.  There is something not quite right about life in the little town, and there is literally something in the water.  The show is well paced and sadly only aired for one season.  The potential it had far outstrips the offerings we are stuck with now.  This is once again an example of poor TV studio management that wrecked an excellent show.  The potential INVASION had will probably never be realized.  It truly is a shame.  Fortunately, what we have is excellent and very entertaining.  Sadly, the show ends in a major cliffhanger.  We may never know the ending.  Hopefully, someone will do a movie, write a book, or even pick the series back up one day.  However, what we have is definitely worth your time.

I'd seen the entire series on rented DVDs but thought I'd buy it since it was so inexpensive. What a great decision! I was surprised at the quality of just about everything in this show. You know they're doing something right when they take a silly premise with some ludicrous plot points and transform it into an engrossing drama.You may not even have to like science fiction to like this. It's just good drama... and I don't even enjoy TV! I haven't watched in 20 years but I've found a few great series on DVD. This is one of them. What a shame it fell through the cracks.One aspect I love is characters often do unpredictable - but not unbelievable -  things.,4,Continue to be amazed...,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,708,"['found', 'set', '13', 'grocery', 'store', ""'d"", 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'rented', 'DVDs', 'thought', ""'d"", 'buy', 'was', 'so', 'inexpensive', 'What', 'great', 'decision', 'was', 'surprised', 'quality', 'just', 'everything', 'show', 'know', ""'re"", 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'when', 'take', 'silly', 'premise', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'points', 'transform', 'engrossing', 'drama.You', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'like', 'science', 'fiction', 'like', 'just', 'good', 'drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'enjoy', 'TV', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', '20', 'years', ""'ve"", 'found', 'few', 'great', 'series', 'DVD', 'one', 'What', 'shame', 'fell', 'cracks.One', 'aspect', 'love', 'characters', 'often', 'do', 'unpredictable', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'things']",Invasion:CSR (DVD)
