Why those aliens would want to booby trap all of them for destruction of the earth  later is vague.  The special effects for the movie's other disaster sites  are disappointing.  Frankly, most of the good effects are shown almost in their entirety in the trailer, leaving not much for the movie except for long talk intervals in scientific rooms and empty fields and watching teams of scientists stare at computer screens in wonder as graphs and charts flash by.

The actors did well, the storyline was pretty good.  The only thing that really bothered me were the special effects in some scenes (mostly towards the beginning).  Over all, I liked it.",4,Not bad,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,355,"['usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'most', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'see', 'SyFy', 'think', 'originally', 'aired', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'storyline', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'bothered', 'were', 'special', 'effects', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'beginning', 'liked']",Stonehenge Apocalypse

However, no matter how used the concept is, the delivery of Stonehenge Apocalypse, is marvelous.Conspiracy radio show host (and award winning physicist), Jacob, uncovers a series of magnetic disturbances AND learns that a group of tourists have been destroyed at Stonehenge.  For him, this is a clear call to GO to Henge and uncover what is going on.  Around the world, magnetic vortices are exhibiting dangerous signs (volcanic erruptions et al) and destroying Mexico, Malaysia, Egypt (Giza), and maybe Maine.  His mission, as he chooses to accept it, to stop the nuclear destruction of Stonehenge by a mad military leader before he can find the key to the disturbances and turn off the terra forming he suspects is going on!  Betrayal, action, transatlantic travel at light speed, and indoctrination through a series of revelatory discoveries makes this a National Treasure of Destruction.Having said that, I liked it.  It is not factual, nor academy award material, but it is a good film that will make you appreciate the fact that even well intentioned films can still be passable.  SyFy is to be applauded for giving voice to films like these that can often be better than the high budget LOTR genres.Thanks so much folks.Keep those pyramids buried, please.",4,Enjoyable Destruction,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1403,"['central', 'theme', 'film', 'prophetic', 'words', 'seem', 'come', 'close', 'reality', '2012', 'discovery', 'magnetic', 'chamber', 'not', 'new', 'However', 'matter', 'how', 'used', 'concept', 'delivery', 'Stonehenge', 'Apocalypse', 'marvelous.Conspiracy', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'award', 'winning', 'physicist', 'Jacob', 'series', 'magnetic', 'disturbances', 'group', 'tourists', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Stonehenge', 'clear', 'call', 'GO', 'Henge', 'uncover', 'what', 'going', 'world', 'magnetic', 'vortices', 'are', 'exhibiting', 'dangerous', 'signs', 'volcanic', 'erruptions', 'et', 'al', 'destroying', 'Mexico', 'Malaysia', 'Egypt', 'Giza', 'maybe', 'Maine', 'mission', 'accept', 'stop', 'nuclear', 'destruction', 'Stonehenge', 'mad', 'military', 'leader', 'can', 'find', 'key', 'disturbances', 'turn', 'off', 'terra', 'forming', 'going', 'Betrayal', 'action', 'transatlantic', 'travel', 'light', 'speed', 'indoctrination', 'series', 'revelatory', 'discoveries', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Destruction.Having', 'said', 'liked', 'not', 'factual', 'academy', 'award', 'material', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'even', 'well', 'intentioned', 'films', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'passable', 'SyFy', 'be', 'applauded', 'giving', 'voice', 'films', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'better', 'high', 'budget', 'LOTR', 'so', 'much', 'folks.Keep', 'pyramids', 'buried', 'please']",Stonehenge Apocalypse
