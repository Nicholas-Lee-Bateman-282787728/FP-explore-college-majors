There were only three minor flaws that I noticed while watching the film this week; one I don't remember the details on, two that the beginning titles are a little hard to read as the writing/white color is weak, and thirdly that there is one nature scene that is out of register for approximately 5 to 10 seconds (a medium to long shot, second unit piece).  The color pops, the actor's are fine (as one should expect), and it's Mr. DeMille. It won't bore you to death.  I ordered my copy overnight on Monday/Tuesday (04-08-2014) and received it on Thursday (04-10-2014) via USPS, and it included tracking numbers, arriving from Florida to Oregon in that time.
