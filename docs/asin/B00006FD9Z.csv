If it is anything like this movie, I would definitely read it.  The performances were strong, the story was engaging, and the struggles that Hunter, the main character, must go through, living between two worlds--the world of the Whites and the world of the Natives--is noble and heartwrenching to watch.  How can he possibly ""become a man"" in the way his White father sees fit--through becoming a fine hunter (hence, the name)--when he can only shoot a doe?  This also crosses over to his mother's culture, where shooting does is the ultimate sin because they symbolize fertility. Hence, the death of the doe is also the death of the generations.  Hunter's generations may also be at risk for hemophilia, the disease he acquires--the White man's disease.This film tackles everything--breaking away from family, self definition, first love and the epidemic of HIV.I definitely reccomend it.  It is a fine film, and be sure to have Kleenex handy when you watch it.  It is a real tearjerker.",5,"beautiful, haunting film",1082592000,"04 22, 2004",2004,1085,"['what', 'was', 'told', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'anything', 'movie', 'would', 'definitely', 'read', 'performances', 'were', 'strong', 'story', 'was', 'engaging', 'struggles', 'Hunter', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'go', 'living', 'two', 'worlds', 'world', 'Whites', 'world', 'Natives', 'noble', 'heartwrenching', 'watch', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'become', 'man', 'way', 'White', 'father', 'fit', 'becoming', 'fine', 'hunter', 'hence', 'name', 'when', 'can', 'only', 'shoot', 'doe', 'also', 'mother', 'culture', 'where', 'shooting', 'ultimate', 'sin', 'symbolize', 'fertility', 'Hence', 'death', 'doe', 'also', 'death', 'generations', 'Hunter', 'generations', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'risk', 'hemophilia', 'disease', 'White', 'man', 'disease.This', 'film', 'tackles', 'everything', 'breaking', 'away', 'family', 'definition', 'first', 'love', 'epidemic', 'HIV.I', 'definitely', 'reccomend', 'fine', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'Kleenex', 'handy', 'when', 'watch', 'real', 'tearjerker']",N/A

Almost nobody heard about Doe Boy and there really isn't a good - or acceptable reason.Slowly paced this very gentle film packs an emotional wallop few films with bigger budgets, more stars and loftier stories could hope to achieve.  Doe Boy is about Hunter - a boy with an American Indian mother and white father.  Hunter is a hemophiliac, a disease seemingly unknown to Native American's.  His macho father (a terrific performance by Kevin Anderson) loves his son, but is let down by the boy's inability to be more physically active because of the disease.  As the film traces Hunter's story from childhood through his late teens, we see the difficulty of the relationship between he and his father straining and the inability of his mother to let him go and be the man he needs to be.James Duval gives a performance that is positively incandescent.  With relatively little dialogue, and through facial features, body language he fills Hunter with a sense of defiance and the need for acceptance, and the struggle of being different, in more ways than one.  Acceptance and understanding do not come easy, but with the aid of his wise grandfather, a beautiful girl, and coming to grips with his heritage and nature, Hunter's journey is one that everyone should be able to relate to.An amazing, nearly perfect movie.",5,As Good As Indie Films Get,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1362,"['Talk', 'movies', 'slip', 'radar', 'Almost', 'nobody', 'heard', 'Doe', 'Boy', 'really', ""n't"", 'good', 'acceptable', 'reason.Slowly', 'paced', 'very', 'gentle', 'film', 'packs', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'few', 'films', 'bigger', 'budgets', 'more', 'stars', 'loftier', 'stories', 'could', 'hope', 'achieve', 'Doe', 'Boy', 'Hunter', 'boy', 'American', 'Indian', 'mother', 'white', 'father', 'Hunter', 'hemophiliac', 'disease', 'seemingly', 'unknown', 'Native', 'American', 'macho', 'father', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'Anderson', 'son', 'let', 'down', 'boy', 'inability', 'be', 'more', 'physically', 'active', 'disease', 'film', 'traces', 'Hunter', 'story', 'childhood', 'late', 'teens', 'see', 'difficulty', 'relationship', 'father', 'straining', 'inability', 'mother', 'let', 'go', 'be', 'man', 'be.James', 'Duval', 'performance', 'positively', 'incandescent', 'relatively', 'little', 'dialogue', 'facial', 'features', 'body', 'language', 'Hunter', 'sense', 'defiance', 'need', 'acceptance', 'struggle', 'being', 'different', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Acceptance', 'understanding', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'easy', 'aid', 'wise', 'grandfather', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'coming', 'grips', 'heritage', 'nature', 'Hunter', 'journey', 'one', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'to.An', 'amazing', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'movie']",N/A

The story starts when the boy is in his pre-teens but shortly moves to his late teens, where most of the story takes place.

As both a family melodrama and a coming of age story, it shows family and cultural friction among its characters.  The soundtrack is also very good, with tracks by Robbie Robertson and Sacred Spirit, among others I did not recognize, but enjoyed.  The soundtrack is Native American themed in the indie rock or contemporary genre and was joyful and sad at the same time.  You will need a box of Kleenex because you will be crying at the end.

In this film, the protagonist finds himself between two worlds that oppose one another.  His grandfather offers him a link to cultural traditions that his father doesn't really value.  In the midst of this battle of ideas, he must find himself and outgrow childhood trauma.  The disappointments of his father mean to become his own and a weakness in his own body presents a deadly serious trial.  The Doe Boy is a film that successfully portrays the unique story of a young man facing the crisis of maturity and adulthood.
