1548187,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B0087RIJTC,Bob L,"[0, 2]","I rented this movie and before I watched it I thought I'd check what the masses thought and I almost didn't watch the movie because of all the negative reviews. The only thing I could hope for is that it would be one of those movies like The Road to Wellville where a lot of people who are very uptight about there bodies can't handle the bawdy humor. Well, that's what happened. The Babymakers is very funny, well paced, the characters are likable and humor ranges all over the place, it's in the dialog, the visuals and the timing. I'd have to say this is one of the more likable comedies along with Role Models, Office Space, Away We Go, Sex Drive, Walk Hard and luckily it's not at all like Wedding Crashers, Bridesmaids, Good Luck Chuck or The Hangover.The one big change I would have made was to keep Jay behind the camera and if his character was really necessary it would have played funnier with Gerry Bednob.I wasn't going to watch this movie because all these negative reviews made me think I would see a big failure of Jay's direction and that wouldn't be any fun at all. Jay's direction is terrific.And for reference, I'm offended by the toilet humor in Enchanted but I think the toilet humor in Not Another Teen Movie is hysterical. It's a matter of propriety. It's not right in Enchanted. It's fine in NATM. What's done in this movie is just fine for it.",5,Pleasantly Surprised,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,1369,"['rented', 'movie', 'watched', 'thought', ""'d"", 'check', 'what', 'masses', 'thought', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'negative', 'reviews', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'movies', 'Road', 'Wellville', 'where', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'uptight', 'bodies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'bawdy', 'humor', 'Well', 'what', 'happened', 'Babymakers', 'very', 'funny', 'well', 'paced', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'humor', 'place', 'dialog', 'visuals', 'timing', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'one', 'more', 'likable', 'comedies', 'Role', 'Models', 'Office', 'Space', 'Away', 'Go', 'Sex', 'Drive', 'Walk', 'Hard', 'luckily', 'not', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Bridesmaids', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'Hangover.The', 'one', 'big', 'change', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'was', 'keep', 'Jay', 'camera', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'funnier', 'Gerry', 'Bednob.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'negative', 'reviews', 'made', 'think', 'would', 'see', 'big', 'failure', 'Jay', 'direction', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fun', 'Jay', 'direction', 'terrific.And', 'reference', ""'m"", 'offended', 'toilet', 'humor', 'Enchanted', 'think', 'toilet', 'humor', 'Not', 'Teen', 'Movie', 'hysterical', 'matter', 'propriety', 'not', 'right', 'Enchanted', 'fine', 'NATM', 'What', 'done', 'movie', 'just', 'fine']",The Babymakers

Although this isn't an official Broken lizard movie with all of the usual cast, we still have the same type of humor. Jay Chandrasekhar is funny as usual, and the best scenes are the ones he's in.  This movie starts a little slow, but gets really good after we meet Jays character. I was lucky enough to meet the Broken Lizard group at a comedy club, really nice guys.

I was willing to forgive Club Dread for being not as good, and then turn a blind eye when they decided to do Dukes of Hazard with only a few mentions of the old cast.  I loved beer fest, just not as much as Super Troopers, and now there just seems to be all of these would be bit comedy movies by Jay Chandresekhar, the director of Broken Lizard who is the India guy from the troupe.  This film tries to be racy, and I love Olivia Munn, but the performances here are just so wooden.  I don't expect anything to really get solved, but this film is so lazy.  None of the gags play off well, and the group of friends should be broken lizard, at least in my head.

There is a long focus on this relationship with some laugh out loud hilarity among a serious examination of how infertility affects people.The movie then shifts into a weird digressions as a slapstick comedy with much silliness.
