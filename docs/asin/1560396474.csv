When a team of robots from the future burst into Dexter's Lab with the intention of destroying &quot;The one who saves the future&quot;, Dexter automatically assumes that it is him they are refering to. Wondering how he saves the future, he travels through different stages of his life to find what great acomplishments he makes. And of course, everywhere he goes, he meets his rival, Mandark.

Drawn and animated in Genndy Tartakovsky's brilliantly stark geometric style quite similar to that of The Powerpuff Girls, the story opens as Dexter is suddenly attacked by a whole band of Transformer-like robots from the distant future. Our brooding young hero then finds himself being whisked off on the most amazing adventure of his whole lifetime: he meets himself at three different ages and learns the whole story behind it as he goes from one chilling scenario to another. His archrival, the nerdy Mandark had taken over the whole world through his very own genius and thus brought about its ruin while poor Dexter himself had fallen from his own glory to eventually escape Mandark's greedy clutches and build himself up as a muscle-bound, middle-aged crusader behind eyeless goggles. So young Dexter himself is there to help him out! And as the saying goes, the rest is history. VERY IMPRESSIVE!!! The very artful opening credits themselves are just simply marvelous as well as the cleverly designed fantastic settings created for Dexter's latest exploits! The only griping I have about this whimsical little masterpiece is that it hadn't been closed-captioned yet for my viewing pleasure. But fear not, my dear fellow deaf fans of the immortal Dexter...this video indeed IS, so just sit back and ENJOY!!!:)",5,DYNAMIC!!!,975715200,"12 2, 2000",2000,1418,"['What', 'cool', 'feat', 'star', 'Dexter', 'Boy', 'Wonder', 'feature-length', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Drawn', 'animated', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'brilliantly', 'stark', 'geometric', 'style', 'quite', 'similar', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'story', 'Dexter', 'suddenly', 'attacked', 'whole', 'band', 'Transformer-like', 'robots', 'distant', 'future', 'brooding', 'young', 'hero', 'then', 'being', 'whisked', 'off', 'most', 'amazing', 'adventure', 'whole', 'lifetime', 'three', 'different', 'ages', 'whole', 'story', 'one', 'chilling', 'scenario', 'archrival', 'nerdy', 'Mandark', 'had', 'taken', 'over', 'whole', 'world', 'very', 'own', 'genius', 'thus', 'brought', 'about', 'ruin', 'poor', 'Dexter', 'had', 'fallen', 'own', 'glory', 'eventually', 'escape', 'Mandark', 'greedy', 'clutches', 'build', 'up', 'muscle-bound', 'middle-aged', 'crusader', 'eyeless', 'goggles', 'So', 'young', 'Dexter', 'there', 'help', 'out', 'saying', 'rest', 'history', 'VERY', 'IMPRESSIVE', 'very', 'artful', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'just', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'as', 'well', 'cleverly', 'designed', 'fantastic', 'settings', 'created', 'Dexter', 'latest', 'exploits', 'only', 'griping', 'have', 'whimsical', 'little', 'masterpiece', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'closed-captioned', 'yet', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'fear', 'not', 'dear', 'fellow', 'deaf', 'fans', 'immortal', 'Dexter', 'video', 'indeed', 'IS', 'so', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'ENJOY']",Dexter's Laboratory - Ego Trip VHS
182810,A3NFO65EIFQRE1,1560396474,Laughing Dragon,"[0, 0]","To start off with, I'm a fan of the Cartoon Network animated show ""Dexter's Laboratory"". True, I wasn't overly impressed with it at first glance, but it grew on me as I got to know the show's premise and its characters. While it never featured the best animation, and the writing was occasionally sloppy, with episodes that ended inconclusively, story lines that didn't always add up and occasional character moments that made me cringe rather than laugh, overall the series was still quite enjoyable, and for the most part, has held up well over time.What made the series especially intriguing was the relationship between the show's titular character, Dexter, a 10-year-old reclusive boy genius who has a secret lab in the basement of his parents' house, and his free-spirited, playful and inquisitive older sister, Dee Dee. On the surface, their relationship is antagonistic, with Dexter blowing a fuse every time his sister invades his lab and proceeds to unwittingly break things and make a lot of noise. She doesn't do such things in a hurtful way, but out of curiosity and a sense of fun. Dexter, however, has little patience with fun, and does whatever he can to chase her out of his lab so he can return to his obsessive inventing (mostly useless bits of machinery that often go wrong, with or without Dee Dee's help).But despite their quarreling, it is made plain throughout most of the series' run that Dexter and Dee Dee love each other. The creator of the series, Genndy Tartakovsky, seemed to make a point in a number of episodes that Dexter actually relies on Dee Dee's rambunctiousness and her desire to spend time with him because, quixotically, it helps him focus on his work; her presence is actually a source of comfort and security for him. Several episodes revolve around his feelings of isolation and loneliness when Dee Dee is absent from his lab for any length of time. As for Dee Dee, her affection for her little brother is unshakable and utterly without judgement; to her, he's this fascinating baby brother who invents cool stuff and goes on awesome adventures. This mutual devotion helped deter ""Dexter's Laboratory"" from being a one-note joke of a show, and gave the characters a warmth and depth that other shows of its type all too often lack. There can be little doubt that the appeal of its two main characters had a lot to do with the series' remarkable longevity (78 episodes in all, although the best episodes were the first 52).Unfortunately, the animated TV movie ""Ego Trip"", while very clever in its overall execution, portrays a much darker side of the series, with Dexter's egomania overtaking his good qualities to the point that, when he discovers that it's his sister Dee Dee who saves the universe instead of him, actually conspires with alternate-dimensional versions of himself to kill her. This contradicts, even violates, his character and removes much of his humanity and appeal. It also flattens his personality into a caricature, robbing it of much of its fun, and the movie never gets over the loss of its central character's poignancy and pathos. As a result, this film is likely to leave longtime ""Dexter"" fans with a bad taste in their mouths, and is very UNlikely to win new fans for the series. As such, while I applaud the film's production values and the core of the idea that inspired it, I cannot recommend it. I advise anyone who wants to relive the series in its glory, or who is new to ""Dexter"" and wishes to discover the reasons for its popularity, to stick to the first 52 episodes, and avoid this movie altogether. Too bad.",2,A clever movie that unfortunately damages the series and characters,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,3593,"['start', 'off', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'animated', 'show', 'Dexter', 'Laboratory', 'True', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'impressed', 'first', 'glance', 'grew', 'got', 'know', 'show', 'premise', 'characters', 'never', 'featured', 'best', 'animation', 'writing', 'was', 'occasionally', 'sloppy', 'episodes', 'ended', 'inconclusively', 'story', 'lines', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'add', 'up', 'occasional', 'character', 'moments', 'made', 'cringe', 'rather', 'laugh', 'series', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'part', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'time.What', 'made', 'series', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'was', 'relationship', 'show', 'titular', 'character', 'Dexter', '10-year-old', 'reclusive', 'boy', 'genius', 'who', 'secret', 'lab', 'basement', 'parents', 'house', 'free-spirited', 'playful', 'inquisitive', 'older', 'sister', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'surface', 'relationship', 'antagonistic', 'Dexter', 'blowing', 'fuse', 'time', 'sister', 'lab', 'proceeds', 'unwittingly', 'break', 'things', 'make', 'lot', 'noise', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'things', 'hurtful', 'way', 'curiosity', 'sense', 'fun', 'Dexter', 'however', 'little', 'patience', 'fun', 'whatever', 'can', 'chase', 'lab', 'can', 'return', 'obsessive', 'inventing', 'mostly', 'useless', 'bits', 'machinery', 'often', 'go', 'wrong', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'help', '.But', 'quarreling', 'made', 'plain', 'most', 'series', 'run', 'Dexter', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'love', 'other', 'creator', 'series', 'Genndy', 'Tartakovsky', 'seemed', 'make', 'point', 'number', 'episodes', 'Dexter', 'actually', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'rambunctiousness', 'desire', 'spend', 'time', 'because', 'quixotically', 'focus', 'work', 'presence', 'actually', 'source', 'comfort', 'security', 'Several', 'episodes', 'revolve', 'feelings', 'isolation', 'loneliness', 'when', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'absent', 'lab', 'length', 'time', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'affection', 'little', 'brother', 'unshakable', 'utterly', 'judgement', 'fascinating', 'baby', 'brother', 'who', 'cool', 'stuff', 'awesome', 'adventures', 'mutual', 'devotion', 'helped', 'deter', 'Dexter', 'Laboratory', 'being', 'one-note', 'joke', 'show', 'gave', 'characters', 'warmth', 'depth', 'other', 'shows', 'type', 'too', 'often', 'lack', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'doubt', 'appeal', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'series', 'remarkable', 'longevity', '78', 'episodes', 'best', 'episodes', 'were', 'first', '52', '.Unfortunately', 'animated', 'TV', 'movie', 'Ego', 'Trip', 'very', 'clever', 'overall', 'execution', 'much', 'darker', 'side', 'series', 'Dexter', 'egomania', 'overtaking', 'good', 'qualities', 'point', 'when', 'sister', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'who', 'universe', 'instead', 'actually', 'alternate-dimensional', 'versions', 'kill', 'even', 'character', 'much', 'humanity', 'appeal', 'also', 'personality', 'caricature', 'robbing', 'much', 'fun', 'movie', 'never', 'loss', 'central', 'character', 'poignancy', 'pathos', 'result', 'film', 'likely', 'leave', 'longtime', 'Dexter', 'fans', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouths', 'very', 'UNlikely', 'win', 'new', 'fans', 'series', 'such', 'applaud', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'core', 'idea', 'inspired', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'advise', 'anyone', 'who', 'relive', 'series', 'glory', 'who', 'new', 'Dexter', 'wishes', 'discover', 'reasons', 'popularity', 'stick', 'first', '52', 'episodes', 'avoid', 'movie', 'altogether', 'Too', 'bad']",Dexter's Laboratory - Ego Trip VHS
182811,A1WN9S1R3P4PLL,1560396474,Les,"[10, 11]","This video is based on the Cartoon Network show &quot;Dexter's Laboratory&quot;.  (my favorite cartoon cartoon)  The story revolves around Dexter and his struggle to save the future.  He travels to several different time periods in his attempt, picking up an older version of himself each time.  Didi, Dexter's sister, had a very small role in this movie, which is unfortunate because she is always a humorous edition to the show.  Dexter's only other enemy is a fellow prodigy and classmate named Mandark.  The competition between these two geniuses is not as funny as the sibling rivalry between Dexter and Didi, but it is nonetheless entertaining.  The real humor lies in the Dexters of the future.  Imagine Dexter with muscles abound and a superhero voice (with the same goofy accent), or a feeble old man that can't hear.  The Mandarks of the future are funny as well.  I would reccomend this movie to a Dexter fan moreso than an average cartoon watcher because the tape will make more sense if you know a little background.  Either way, I enjoyed the tape and was satisfied with my purchase.  Now when are they going to release a compilation DVD??",5,Didi!

182812,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,1560396474,Luis Hernandez,"[2, 2]","With a Teutonic accent, and the mind of a genius, Dexter stars in his first feature-length film ever. This film, which aired on the Cartoon Network in the summer of 2000 marks the first time the characters of the long-running and popular series &quot;Dexter's Laboratory&quot; branch out into an hour-length film.The plot revolves around Dexter's travel to the future where he discovers that his rival and arch-nemesis, Mandark, has taken over the world in the future, where his technology controls the functions of society's everyday needs. Dexter goes back into the future to find his future selves in order to turn back the hands of time and prevent Mandark from his conquest.The video is a refreshing treat for any Dexter fan. My only qualms about this was that the picture quality is dark and the small presence of his crazy sister, Dee-Dee, and his parents make this film less-enjoyable than an average Dexter episode. Overall, this is a good film, but it could have been much better.

182813,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,1560396474,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[5, 5]","I'm a huge fan of Dexter's Lab. In it's short episodes it manages to make fun of Die Hard, Star Wars, Tron, and even Samurai Flicks. But what happens when you take a show normally dedicated to several short episodes and stretch it out to an hour?Our story starts with Dexter's archnemesis Mandark attempting to steal his ""greatest creation"" (no, really), the neurotomic protocore. After a fantastic action scene featuring Dexter fighting off Mandark's laser blasts using only a wrench (his tool of choice and symbolic weapon), Dexter finds himself seemingly under attack by robots sent back in time to ""destroy the one who saved the future"". Dexter naturally quickly dispatches the invaders using his usually awesome array of gadgetry. But naturally Dexter's curiosity gets the better of him. Just how did he save the future? And from what? Led by a singular desire to see how cool he really is, Dexter heads to the future in his trusty time machine.And this is where the movie REALLY starts. Dexter first goes to the future (an awesome futuristic city straight of a classic sci-fi flick), only to discover that he's still too far in the past. So then he heads farther into the future, discovering a Utopia world remade in his image (it bears more than a little resemblance to the land of Oz, and everyone wears white lab coats). Again the wrong time, so Dexter heads for the future right in between the two he just visted (and brings along his the two future versions of himself he found the previous two futures). This time the world is post-apocalypic, and Dexter's old Nemesis Mandark is responsible! It's the ultimate showdown as four Dexters (including the super-cool post-apocalypic version which bears more than a little resemblance to a certain Austrian action star) fight to save the future against four Mandarks!Dexter's Lab is normally billiant, but Ego Trip takes the cake. The usually great art direction is upped a notch, the music is excellent, the jokes hilarious and action perfectly executed. But perhaps most surprising of all is the fact that the plot looks like something straight out of a sci-fi classic (as do all of the locations). Any true fan of Dexter's Lab needs to OWN this movie. ESPECIALLY anyone who loves sci-fi.
