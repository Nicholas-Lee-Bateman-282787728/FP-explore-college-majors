984073,A35D2JNAO6JKX3,B000F6ZE7S,Atma Weapon,"[1, 2]","This is a very informative documentary that spends a lot of time untangling the complicated history of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  There isn't as much information on the content of the texts as there is on the discovery and controversial custody of the various scrolls and fragments (different parties ended up with different pieces of the puzzle).  In fact, it was such a complicated history that I found it a bit hard to keep up with all the details, but I think I've got the gist of it.The scrolls were found in some caves in Qumran by a shepherd boy.  He didn't really know what he had discovered at first and brought them to a merchant in town.  Eventually, when it was determined that the texts might have some archaeological and therefore monetary value, there appears to have been return trips to all the caves in the area to search for more.  One is left with the impression that there was a bit of a mad scramble with certain parties pocketing pieces here and there.  Then, once the scrolls were mostly in the hands of scholars, it became a secretive issue.  I think it's possible that this was dramatized a bit, as you'd expect some discretion to surround such important documents, but there is a sense in which it seemed maybe too secretive (scholars were allowed to see but not to publish any of the texts).  I can understand the physical scrolls would be a sensitive issue, but ironically the custodians were rather insensitive to the physical preservation issues and yet very strict on controlling the information of the texts.  In any case, it seems that over the years, things have sorted themselves out and more has been published and the physical preservation been attended to.As for the scrolls themselves and what they tell us about ancient history, the main takeaways were: (1) that they seemed to be copies of familiar biblical texts, corroborating their accuracy, (2) they shed light on Qumran (the location) and the Essene sect (presumed to live in a community at that location), (3) one of the documents, the so-called MMT document, once finally revealed, raised a lot of questions about our understanding of the Essene sect and seemed to blur the distinction between Sadducees and Essenes.  There was less emphasis on the texts themselves, but that may well be because the texts are simply copies of known texts with very little deviation from the originals.  There was some mention of a treasure map as well as non-biblical texts serving as metadata of sorts (e.g. the MMT document).The fragmentary nature of the scrolls themselves, the initially frenzied distribution to various parties, and the secretive policies of some of the custodians cast a lot of mystery on what all texts were in the caves.  However, due to their significance, there has also been a lot of pressure to sort it all out and do a better job of preserving the scrolls.  So, while it's a shame that it's been such a messy process, there is still a lot that has been preserved including some new material of historical significance.  There was also a suggestion that there may be even more scrolls hidden in inaccessible caves: the area is apparently prone to earthquakes and it's surmised that future earthquakes may reveal more caves.I would have liked less emphasis on the discovery and curation (the messy 20th century archaeology) and more emphasis on the texts themselves (the ancient history and theological import, if any): what all has been found, what is presumed missing, and what does it all mean.  Nevertheless, as a non-expert on the subject, I found it to be extremely informative and interesting.",4,Helps Unravel Complicated History of the Discovery and Custody of the Scrolls,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,3606,"['very', 'informative', 'documentary', 'lot', 'time', 'untangling', 'complicated', 'history', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Scrolls', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'information', 'content', 'texts', 'discovery', 'controversial', 'custody', 'various', 'scrolls', 'fragments', 'different', 'parties', 'ended', 'up', 'different', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'fact', 'was', 'such', 'complicated', 'history', 'found', 'bit', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'details', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'gist', 'it.The', 'scrolls', 'were', 'found', 'caves', 'Qumran', 'shepherd', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'had', 'discovered', 'first', 'brought', 'merchant', 'town', 'Eventually', 'when', 'was', 'determined', 'texts', 'might', 'have', 'archaeological', 'therefore', 'monetary', 'value', 'have', 'been', 'return', 'trips', 'caves', 'area', 'search', 'more', 'One', 'left', 'impression', 'was', 'bit', 'mad', 'scramble', 'certain', 'parties', 'pocketing', 'pieces', 'here', 'there', 'Then', 'once', 'scrolls', 'were', 'mostly', 'hands', 'scholars', 'became', 'secretive', 'issue', 'think', 'possible', 'was', 'dramatized', 'bit', ""'d"", 'expect', 'discretion', 'surround', 'such', 'important', 'documents', 'sense', 'seemed', 'maybe', 'too', 'secretive', 'scholars', 'were', 'allowed', 'see', 'not', 'publish', 'texts', 'can', 'understand', 'physical', 'scrolls', 'would', 'be', 'sensitive', 'issue', 'ironically', 'custodians', 'were', 'rather', 'insensitive', 'physical', 'preservation', 'issues', 'yet', 'very', 'strict', 'controlling', 'information', 'texts', 'case', 'years', 'things', 'have', 'sorted', 'more', 'been', 'published', 'physical', 'preservation', 'been', 'attended', 'to.As', 'scrolls', 'what', 'tell', 'ancient', 'history', 'main', 'takeaways', 'were', '1', 'seemed', 'be', 'copies', 'familiar', 'biblical', 'texts', 'corroborating', 'accuracy', '2', 'shed', 'light', 'Qumran', 'location', 'Essene', 'sect', 'presumed', 'live', 'community', 'location', '3', 'one', 'documents', 'so-called', 'MMT', 'document', 'once', 'finally', 'revealed', 'raised', 'lot', 'questions', 'understanding', 'Essene', 'sect', 'seemed', 'blur', 'distinction', 'Sadducees', 'Essenes', 'was', 'less', 'emphasis', 'texts', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'texts', 'are', 'simply', 'copies', 'known', 'texts', 'very', 'little', 'deviation', 'originals', 'was', 'mention', 'treasure', 'map', 'as', 'well', 'non-biblical', 'texts', 'serving', 'metadata', 'sorts', 'e.g', 'MMT', 'document', '.The', 'fragmentary', 'nature', 'scrolls', 'initially', 'frenzied', 'distribution', 'various', 'parties', 'secretive', 'policies', 'custodians', 'cast', 'lot', 'mystery', 'what', 'texts', 'were', 'caves', 'However', 'due', 'significance', 'also', 'been', 'lot', 'pressure', 'sort', 'out', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'preserving', 'scrolls', 'So', 'shame', 'been', 'such', 'messy', 'process', 'still', 'lot', 'been', 'preserved', 'including', 'new', 'material', 'historical', 'significance', 'was', 'also', 'suggestion', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'scrolls', 'hidden', 'inaccessible', 'caves', 'area', 'apparently', 'prone', 'earthquakes', 'surmised', 'future', 'earthquakes', 'may', 'reveal', 'more', 'caves.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'less', 'emphasis', 'discovery', 'curation', 'messy', '20th', 'century', 'archaeology', 'more', 'emphasis', 'texts', 'ancient', 'history', 'theological', 'import', 'what', 'been', 'found', 'what', 'presumed', 'missing', 'what', 'mean', 'Nevertheless', 'non-expert', 'subject', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'informative', 'interesting']",N/A

I believe the mystery of Christ's Ministry and Life as well as those dating back to early human history will be unearthed in this area of the world.

ASOR supports three independent overseas institutes, one of which is the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research, Jerusalem. Former directors of  the Albright Institute include Millar Burrows, who was instrumental in the first publications of the Dead Sea scrolls.  He is also infamous for withholding many other scrolls.This &#34;illegal&#34; copy was distributed over the internet, so even when ASOR tried to hunt down all the copies, it was virtually impossible to do so. Soon after, ASOR announced a more relaxed policy for applications to study the original fragments.I am writing this straight from memory, so I apologize for any errors in sequencing or omissions I may have made.  Herschel Schanks, the publisher and director of &#34;Biblical Archaeology Review&#34;(BAR), has written and published extensively on the subject of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the politics surrounding them. If interested, you can access the full story through BAR's archives, or the books that Schanks has published on the subject.Even though this documentary is out of date, it brings to mind a very important segment in Biblical, as well as Archaeological history.",3,"Unfortunately, out of date...",1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1493,"['documentary', 'did', 'voice', 'many', 'concerns', 'scholars', '34', 'closed', 'system', '34', 'implemented', 'study', 'scrolls', 'many', 'events', 'have', 'changed', 'publication.As', 'remember', 'complete', 'digital', 'photographic', '34', 'library', '34', 'was', 'smuggled', 'hands', 'ASOR', 'American', 'School', 'Oriental', 'Research', 'ASOR', 'three', 'independent', 'overseas', 'one', 'Albright', 'Institute', 'Archaeological', 'Research', 'Jerusalem', 'Former', 'directors', 'Albright', 'Institute', 'include', 'Millar', 'Burrows', 'who', 'was', 'instrumental', 'first', 'publications', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'scrolls', 'also', 'infamous', 'withholding', 'many', 'other', 'scrolls.This', '34', 'illegal', '34', 'copy', 'was', 'distributed', 'internet', 'so', 'even', 'when', 'ASOR', 'tried', 'hunt', 'down', 'copies', 'was', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'do', 'so', 'Soon', 'ASOR', 'announced', 'more', 'relaxed', 'policy', 'applications', 'study', 'original', 'fragments.I', 'am', 'writing', 'straight', 'memory', 'apologize', 'errors', 'sequencing', 'omissions', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'Herschel', 'Schanks', 'publisher', 'director', '34', 'Biblical', 'Archaeology', 'Review', '34', 'BAR', 'written', 'published', 'extensively', 'subject', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Scrolls', 'politics', 'surrounding', 'interested', 'can', 'access', 'full', 'story', 'BAR', 'archives', 'books', 'Schanks', 'published', 'subject.Even', 'documentary', 'date', 'mind', 'very', 'important', 'segment', 'Biblical', 'as', 'well', 'Archaeological', 'history']",N/A

This was the most informative DSS documentary I could find on amazon. I definitely do recommend it. However, there really don't seem to be any conclusions as to whether there is a Catholic Conspiracy - this question still has yet to be answered. I find this documentary to somehow attempt to tell the viewer there is no conspiracy but then the interviewer asks a few biblical scholars who actually worked with the texts if they had ever kept texts from the public and they said they'd rather not go into that and what the consequences basically are for talking about unreleased and unknown texts.
