1652495,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00CZ6U0HA,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","When you're dealing with a foreign film revolving around a story with a family featuring seven sons, it's a bit difficult to distinguish one from the other unless you know the actors backwards and forwards. Wu Chun was the only recognizable cast member thanks to &#34;Magic to Win&#34; being seen beforehand, but the rest of the cast just kind of blends together because despite the sons using different weapons on the battlefield they all have the same character traits and have similar personalities. You don't exactly expect a war epic from Hong Kong to have exceptional acting, but none of the actors really have the opportunity to stand out. Adam Cheng is given enough time to portray a concerned father and a first-rate warrior, but is most interesting when the General Yang character is suddenly stricken with illness. Wu Chun has the biggest opportunity to be emotional in the film, but even the noteworthy actors don't have much time to showcase how talented they really are.The highlight of &#34;Saving General Yang&#34; is the battle sequences. Everything from the camera work to the performances and even the locations the film was shot in become top notch. The scenery is beautiful and the sunsets are exquisite, but then the film will spin around to show its audience a sky sucked of all its color, dead men impaled on their weapons on the battlefield, and pools of blood deep enough to drown in. The catapult sequence is a little hard to digest at times since the computer generated effects are a bit much, but the scene is so destructive and devastating that it's difficult not to appreciate it. The scene where the third brother squares off against the man with the poison arrows and the worst haircut imaginable is the most impressive in the entire film. Not only is it stunning, but it also has shades of &#34;War of the Arrows&#34; which is one of the best compliments a film like this could possibly receive.What doesn't make sense about &#34;Saving General Yang&#34; is that the Yang family knows their father is in trouble and is need of rescue. They make preparations, but they also waste too much time standing around, saying goodbye, and reminiscing about the tournament, romance, and their childhood. There's no sense of urgency. Even after they're trying to return home, every Yang brother risks their lives for impulsive reasons whether it's for revenge or to help another sibling. Logic is something that isn't utilized often.Destruction, war, and fighting for your life are represented quite well in &#34;Saving General Yang&#34; since the impressive action sequences make the film from Hong Kong somewhat worthwhile. However the film has very little if anything else to offer. There's no chemistry amongst the cast and the story feels very safe for a Chinese war film, which gives the entire film a flat, dull, and tedious atmosphere. Unfortunately, &#34;Saving General Yang&#34; isn't anything you haven't seen before.",3,Poisoned by the mundane,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,2951,"['When', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'foreign', 'film', 'revolving', 'story', 'family', 'featuring', 'seven', 'sons', 'bit', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'one', 'other', 'know', 'actors', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'Wu', 'Chun', 'was', 'only', 'recognizable', 'cast', 'member', 'thanks', '34', 'Magic', 'Win', '34', 'being', 'seen', 'beforehand', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'kind', 'blends', 'together', 'sons', 'using', 'different', 'weapons', 'battlefield', 'have', 'same', 'character', 'traits', 'have', 'similar', 'personalities', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'expect', 'war', 'epic', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'have', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'none', 'actors', 'really', 'have', 'opportunity', 'stand', 'out', 'Adam', 'Cheng', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'portray', 'concerned', 'father', 'first-rate', 'warrior', 'most', 'interesting', 'when', 'General', 'Yang', 'character', 'suddenly', 'stricken', 'illness', 'Wu', 'Chun', 'biggest', 'opportunity', 'be', 'emotional', 'film', 'even', 'noteworthy', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'showcase', 'how', 'talented', 'really', 'are.The', 'highlight', '34', 'Saving', 'General', 'Yang', '34', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Everything', 'camera', 'work', 'performances', 'even', 'locations', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'become', 'top', 'notch', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'sunsets', 'are', 'exquisite', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'spin', 'show', 'audience', 'sky', 'sucked', 'color', 'dead', 'men', 'impaled', 'weapons', 'battlefield', 'pools', 'blood', 'deep', 'enough', 'drown', 'catapult', 'sequence', 'little', 'hard', 'digest', 'times', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'are', 'bit', 'much', 'scene', 'so', 'destructive', 'devastating', 'difficult', 'not', 'appreciate', 'scene', 'where', 'third', 'brother', 'off', 'man', 'poison', 'arrows', 'worst', 'haircut', 'imaginable', 'most', 'impressive', 'entire', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'stunning', 'also', 'shades', '34', 'War', 'Arrows', '34', 'one', 'best', 'compliments', 'film', 'could', 'possibly', 'receive.What', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', '34', 'Saving', 'General', 'Yang', '34', 'Yang', 'family', 'father', 'trouble', 'need', 'rescue', 'make', 'preparations', 'also', 'waste', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'standing', 'around', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'reminiscing', 'tournament', 'romance', 'childhood', 'sense', 'urgency', 'Even', ""'re"", 'trying', 'return', 'home', 'Yang', 'brother', 'risks', 'lives', 'impulsive', 'reasons', 'revenge', 'help', 'sibling', 'Logic', 'something', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'often.Destruction', 'war', 'fighting', 'life', 'are', 'represented', 'quite', 'well', '34', 'Saving', 'General', 'Yang', '34', 'impressive', 'action', 'sequences', 'make', 'film', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'somewhat', 'worthwhile', 'However', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'anything', 'else', 'offer', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'story', 'feels', 'very', 'safe', 'Chinese', 'war', 'film', 'entire', 'film', 'flat', 'dull', 'tedious', 'atmosphere', 'Unfortunately', '34', 'Saving', 'General', 'Yang', '34', ""n't"", 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before']",Saving General Yang 2013

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 1]","Sometimes I need to pause to reflect on one honest fact for those who stumble across my reviews: I&#8217;ve seen scads and scads of foreign releases, and this sometimes means that &#8211; because of that vast library stuck in my brain &#8211; I may not enjoy one film as much as the next reviewer.  That doesn&#8217;t make my review any less credible, nor does it the other person&#8217;s.  Instead, I think it ends up providing a kind of &#8216;critical balance&#8217; between those just discovering some of the wonderful surprises found today in, say, Korean or Chinese cinema that I&#8217;ve been experiencing for going on three decades.That being said, I&#8217;ll freely admit that I didn&#8217;t enjoy SAVING GENERAL YANG as much as others; however, I still give it an enthusiastic endorsement for you to discover if wartime epics are in your wheelhouse.  It has everything you could possibly want &#8211; epic themes, heroic characters, all backed with a hint of romance.What didn&#8217;t I like?  I&#8217;ll try to convey that better below.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Seven sons must take on an army of thousands, brave treacherous mountain terrain, and find a way home alive &#8211; all to rescue their beloved father.&#8221;The explosion of CGI has helped fuel a renaissance with the epic war story, and that&#8217;s a tremendous plus for today&#8217;s audiences: no longer does a director have to corral a billion extras on camera in order to effectively portray what a vast and brutal landscape ground war looked like centuries ago.  Special effects have given studios a chance to do it on a cinematically grand scale while leaving the creative folk &#8211; storyteller, director, and actors &#8211; free to concentrate their work in other areas.  SAVING GENERAL YANG is a picture that, decades ago, would&#8217;ve been a daunting undertaking, one involving huge casts of extras, travel around a great nation in order to capture the various castles and locations, and as many artisans working behind-the-scenes to bring it to life as were working in front of the camera.  This is one of the benefits to this modern era of filmmaking: it just makes the unimaginable possible.Narratively, there&#8217;s a downside directors much keep in check, and &#8211; to his credit &#8211; director Ronny Yu has performed miracles with SAVING in that despite the prevalence of effects work there&#8217;s a very human story very close to the core of the picture: it&#8217;s a tale that involves country, family, and honor.However, I found SAVING to be a bit too clinical in its approach to the other elements.  The canvas is suitable large, and there are always new colors and new shades added compliments of Yu&#8217;s handiwork that I found myself watching too many of those storytelling tricks.  In the process, I cared just a wee bit less and less about the characters.  As this story is based on a Chinese tale of legend, it isn&#8217;t as if Yu could&#8217;ve effectively eliminated, say, three brothers in order to offer more screen time to just four heroes.  While each of them is gifted with his own unique skills on the field of battle, I just didn&#8217;t care as much about them as individuals to honestly find much honor in their respective deaths.  Yes, they were tragic &#8230; but, for some reason, I kept wondering how the next one was going to fall, and I suspect that wasn&#8217;t the director&#8217;s intent.There&#8217;s nothing decreasing the film&#8217;s visual accomplishments.  Yu has delivered a terrific war-time fairy tale that offers up some outstanding detail, some of which kinda/sorta appears as if it were rendered in post-production instead of in-camera.  (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with it!)  The picture is certainly a site to behold; I&#8217;m simply nitpicking the fact that I would&#8217;ve liked to have cared more for these individuals than the film had time for in its usually trim 107 minutes.SAVING GENERAL YANG (2013) is produced by Pegasus Motion Pictures Production and Pegasus Motion Pictures.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by one of my personal favorite distributors: Well Go USA Entertainment.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Chinese spoken language production with English subtitles available; or &#8211; should you prefer &#8211; there is an English-dubbed track.  (I rarely watch those as I prefer to hear the original language.)  As for the technical specifications?  BOOM!  This is one immaculately engineered piece of entertainment, and no expense was spared in delivering it with the highest quality sights and sounds.  Lastly &#8211; if it&#8217;s special features you want &#8211; then there are some rather obligatory making-of interviews with the cast and crew, along with the theatrical trailer.  It&#8217;s a nice collection.RECOMMENDED.  SAVING GENERAL YANG is kinda/sorta done in the same thematic vein as, say, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN because, like the Spielberg film, the story is fundamentally more about surviving than it really is &#8216;saving.&#8217;  Still, the exquisite cinematography and effective fight sequences &#8211; no doubt all put together by director Ronny Yu &#8211; wound up feeling a bit too clinical for me to love this as much as the next critical bloke.  Perhaps I&#8217;ve seen so many far more interesting stories from that part of the world that this one didn&#8217;t strike me as exceptional as it did others.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of SAVING GENERAL YANG by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution in no way, shape, or form influenced by opinion of it.",3,Excellent Period Piece Delivers Big Visuals With Little Investment In Character,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,6165,"['Sometimes',

1652503,A1M2UIO0DNLH1S,B00CZ6U0HA,L. Nguyen,"[0, 0]","I'm actually quite surprised at the number of negative reviews regarding this movie. Not only on here, but from critics as well. Goes to show that I always don't agree with the majority. I read about this movie and was wanting to watch it for awhile and when it came out, well, I was on it.First off, I am already very familiar with the story of the Yang Family. It is a very well known story and I also picked up quite a bit more of the story watching The Young Warriors, one of the Chinese television series. That series is long- around 43 episodes but did a really good job with all of the family members. If you are interested in this family story, then I would suggest that series to watch. The Yang story is good but also sad since the outcome never really changes in the fate of this family.The entire premise of this movie is largely set around a specific battle in which General Yang ( patriarch) of the family goes off to war and gets abandoned with his soldiers in a closed off area while he is being hunted down by Yelu Yuan (bad guy) who is set on his own mission by his Empress to take down the Yang Clan as well as settling his own personal vendetta. The movie paces around the suspense of Yelu Yuan chasing down the father and brothers. That is basically it in a nutshell. The plot line is simple while the movie focuses more on the suspense and the fighting scenes and the overall theme of love, honor, and family.I understand that most of the remakes take their own spin on the legend and this one from what I understand did stick with some of the details of the story and also spun their own version on what  happened as well so I was prepared for that and I really didn't see anything that was so out of the blue that was hugely different than what I had seen prior.  Plot was condensed more but you would have to with this story because it's really hard to compress months worth of action, emotions, etc., in a movie that is over in two hours.This movie was a tad bit confusing to the average person just watching this with no prior knowledge of the history of the story so I can see where people were frustrated with the lack of details and the lack of character development. Well, honestly, with seven sons it would definitely eat up quite of screen time to show their back stories so I would suggest watching one of the series to get more backstory to each of the brothers or read up on them. I definitely think that since I had the background information the movie made more sense to me and I didn't mind the little details that didn't get explained or how the movie skipped around at times.The biggest reason on why I wanted to watch this film was because Ronnie Yu directed it. I have always been a big fan since he did The Bride With the White Hair- and I wanted to see how this would translate into this movie. I didn't think this was as great as The Bride- that will always be one of my favorite movies- but I honestly didn't think this movie was so bad as to warrant the terrible reviews on this.  Far from it. I enjoyed the performances of Adam Cheng, Ekin Cheng, and Raymond Lam and there were also some other actors that I had seen in other movies but noticed in minor roles here. I wouldn't say that the acting was horrible but it may not have been very memorable either. The brothers didn't really develop much character depth to distinguish from one another- I agree with another reviewer that some of the brothers were hard to tell apart- but in this movie, it was enough to convey the overall tone of the film- that the family and honor is worth fighting for. Basically all for one and one for all mentality. There were several parts in the film that reminded me of Yu's older works- he does like to use flashbacks to make thing more poignant, and he does that again in this film. The imagery, costumes and fighting scenes were decent. You had more hand to hand combat rather than flying around which is more realistic, and there were a few scenes that reminded me of War of the Arrows. It's not maybe as epic as you would think it would be and maybe a bit stretching of plausibility at some parts but it still was far from the worst movie that I have watched. Bottom line- you may enjoy this more if you knew the story beforehand.",4,It Is What It Is,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,4270,"[""'m"", 'actually', 'quite', 'surprised', 'number', 'negative', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'here', 'critics', 'well', 'Goes', 'show', 'always', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'majority', 'read', 'movie', 'was', 'wanting', 'watch', 'awhile', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'well', 'was', 'it.First', 'am', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'Yang', 'Family', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'story', 'also', 'picked', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'watching', 'Young', 'Warriors', 'one', 'Chinese', 'television', 'series', 'series', 'long-', '43', 'episodes', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'interested', 'family', 'story', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'series', 'watch', 'Yang', 'story', 'good', 'also', 'sad', 'outcome', 'never', 'really', 'changes', 'fate', 'family.The', 'entire', 'premise', 'movie', 'largely', 'set', 'around', 'specific', 'battle', 'General', 'Yang', 'patriarch', 'family', 'war', 'abandoned', 'soldiers', 'closed', 'off', 'area', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'Yelu', 'Yuan', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'set', 'own', 'mission', 'Empress', 'take', 'down', 'Yang', 'Clan', 'as', 'well', 'settling', 'own', 'personal', 'vendetta', 'movie', 'suspense', 'Yelu', 'Yuan', 'chasing', 'down', 'father', 'brothers', 'basically', 'nutshell', 'plot', 'line', 'simple', 'movie', 'more', 'suspense', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'overall', 'theme', 'love', 'honor', 'family.I', 'understand', 'most', 'remakes', 'take', 'own', 'spin', 'legend', 'one', 'what', 'understand', 'did', 'stick', 'details', 'story', 'also', 'spun', 'own', 'version', 'what', 'happened', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'prepared', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'was', 'so', 'blue', 'was', 'hugely', 'different', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'prior', 'Plot', 'was', 'condensed', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'story', 'really', 'hard', 'compress', 'months', 'action', 'emotions', 'etc.', 'movie', 'two', 'hours.This', 'movie', 'was', 'tad', 'bit', 'confusing', 'average', 'person', 'just', 'watching', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'history', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'details', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'Well', 'honestly', 'seven', 'sons', 'would', 'definitely', 'eat', 'up', 'quite', 'screen', 'time', 'show', 'back', 'stories', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'one', 'series', 'get', 'more', 'backstory', 'brothers', 'read', 'up', 'definitely', 'think', 'had', 'background', 'information', 'movie', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'details', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'explained', 'how', 'movie', 'skipped', 'around', 'times.The', 'biggest', 'reason', 'why', 'wanted', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'because', 'Ronnie', 'Yu', 'directed', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'did', 'Bride', 'White', 'Hair-', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'translate', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'great', 'Bride-', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies-', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'warrant', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'Far', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Adam', 'Cheng', 'Ekin', 'Cheng', 'Raymond', 'Lam', 'were', 'also', 'other', 'actors', 'had', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'noticed', 'minor', 'roles', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'horrible', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'memorable', 'brothers', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'develop', 'much', 'character', 'depth', 'distinguish', 'one', 'another-', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'brothers', 'were', 'hard', 'tell', 'apart-', 'movie', 'was', 'enough', 'convey', 'overall', 'tone', 'film-', 'family', 'honor', 'worth', 'fighting', 'Basically', 'one', 'one', 'mentality', 'were', 'several', 'parts', 'film', 'reminded', 'Yu', 'older', 'works-', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'make', 'thing', 'more', 'poignant', 'again', 'film', 'imagery', 'costumes', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'were', 'decent', 'had', 'more', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'rather', 'flying', 'more', 'realistic', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'reminded', 'War', 'Arrows', 'not', 'maybe', 'as', 'epic', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'maybe', 'bit', 'stretching', 'plausibility', 'parts', 'still', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'Bottom', 'line-', 'may', 'enjoy', 'more', 'knew', 'story', 'beforehand']",Saving General Yang 2013

Yu is an iconic director who has a couple of nice, cult horror hits under his belt, including BRIDE OF CHUCKY and one of my favorites, FREDDY VS. JASON.  I was expecting great things with this film, and I&#8217;m very happy to report it blew my expectations away.This is one of the best Well Go USA titles I&#8217;ve seen this year.  It is a gripping story with believable characters and intense action.  But it is also a compelling period piece that shows the value of family and honor.  In short, the film is epic in scope and vision, as well as execution.SAVING GENERAL YANG is shot very well and looks stunning onscreen.  The cinematography is a big part of what makes this movie so excellent from a visual standpoint.  It also helps convey the importance of key scenes and adds to the intensity of the battles.The acting is superb as well.  The actors portraying the seven sons each do an outstanding job and bring their characters to life with vivid detail.  Their emotional performances lend a huge amount of credibility to the onscreen drama and set the tone for the film as a whole.The battle sequences in SAVING GENERAL YANG  are also amazing, with (in my opinion) realistic depictions of what open-field combat would probably be like.  There&#8217;s martial-arts action, but it&#8217;s not the wire-work-filled displays that modern day audiences are used to; this is not a bad thing, as I love those kinds of movies as well.  But the lack of over-exaggerated fight scenes makes this movie even more believable.SAVING GENERAL YANG is a huge win for me and I highly recommend it.

I didn't.  The flashback scenes made perfect sense within the context of the film and serve as an excellent mechanism to provide background information, rather than trying to cover the background at the beginning, which would probably make the film longer and harder to follow (Red Cliff does that well, but it's a 4 hour movie).The battle scenes are as good as any I've seen (possibly excepting Red Cliff, which is the best war movie I've ever seen, period.).See this movie.

1652519,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00CZ6U0HA,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 7]","&#8220;Saving General Yang&#8221; is based on an episode in the stories collectively known as &#8220;Generals of the Yang Family.&#8221; Set in early days of China&#8217;s Song dynasty (960&#8211;1279), the film follows the story of military family the Yangs. When the Khitan armies arrive from the north to invade the country, their father General Yang goes to the battlefield, but, severely wounded, he is left behind the enemy line with a handful of warriors.The film&#8217;s title refers to the heroic fights of the family&#8217;s seven sons, who set out to rescue their father. Now the problem of this film adaptation is that those who do not know the source material will find the story rushed and characters flat. There are so many characters in a comparatively short film, so some viewers may ask themselves while watching the film: &#8220;So, who is this General Pan Renmei?&#8221;Even so, action sequences are pretty impressive. &#8220;Saving General Yang&#8221; is directed by Ronny Yu, better known among English-speaking audiences as the director of &#8220;Bride of Chucky&#8221; and &#8220;Freddy vs. Jason.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t heard his name quite a while, but Yu is no stranger to Chinese martial arts films, his last film being &#8220;Fearless&#8221; back in 2006. You cannot expect Jet Li&#8217;s fighting skills here, but combat scenes are powerful and brutal enough.So is the film good? Well, I think so. &#8220;Saving General Yang&#8221; suffers from the uneven pace and some bad CGI, but is worth watching for its combat sequences.",4,(3.5 STARS) Legend of the Yang Family,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,1556,"['8220', 'Saving', 'General', 'Yang', '8221', 'based', 'episode', 'stories', 'collectively', 'known', '8220', 'Generals', 'Yang', 'Family.', '8221', 'Set', 'early', 'days', 'China', '8217', 's', 'Song', 'dynasty', '960', '8211', '1279', 'film', 'story', 'military', 'family', 'Yangs', 'When', 'Khitan', 'armies', 'arrive', 'north', 'invade', 'country', 'father', 'General', 'Yang', 'battlefield', 'severely', 'wounded', 'left', 'enemy', 'line', 'handful', 'warriors.The', 'film', '8217', 'title', 'refers', 'heroic', 'fights', 'family', '8217', 's', 'seven', 'sons', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'rescue', 'father', 'Now', 'problem', 'film', 'adaptation', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'source', 'material', 'will', 'find', 'story', 'rushed', 'characters', 'flat', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'comparatively', 'short', 'film', 'viewers', 'may', 'ask', 'watching', 'film', '8220', 'So', 'who', 'General', 'Pan', 'Renmei', '8221', 'Even', 'so', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'impressive', '8220', 'Saving', 'General', 'Yang', '8221', 'directed', 'Ronny', 'Yu', 'better', 'known', 'English-speaking', 'audiences', 'director', '8220', 'Bride', 'Chucky', '8221', '8220', 'Freddy', 'Jason.', '8221', 'haven', '8217', 'heard', 'name', 'quite', 'while', 'Yu', 'stranger', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'last', 'film', 'being', '8220', 'Fearless', '8221', 'back', '2006', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'Jet', 'Li', '8217', 'fighting', 'skills', 'here', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'powerful', 'brutal', 'enough.So', 'film', 'good', 'Well', 'think', 'so', '8220', 'Saving', 'General', 'Yang', '8221', 'suffers', 'uneven', 'pace', 'bad', 'CGI', 'worth', 'watching', 'combat', 'sequences']",Saving General Yang 2013
