1495456,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B005N8KPD6,Colleen M. Schneider,"[1, 1]","I borrowed this one from the library and have decided that overall it wasn't the right fit for me, but can see where it might be just the ticket for some exercisers.  Here are my pros and cons:The instructors were all fine, motivating and pushing you to finish your reps.  The exercises were easy to follow and got your heart rate up with simple moves, jumping jacks, leaps squats with weights, lunges, etc.  The segments are short, approx. 15 minutes each, which allow you to customize your routine as a longer or shorter piece.  The exercisers were all on the show.  Sometimes it is refreshing to see real people who look like they need to exercise shown instead of people who already have perfect abs, skinny thighs and the like.  It is also nice to see that they showed variations when the moves were too challenging, which is a great thing, showing that just because you can't do it all you can modify the move and still get a workout and work up to the move.The cons for me was that it was a routine I felt I would get bored with too easily.  I also felt that occasionally there was some sloppy form with a few exercisers that wasn't corrected and sometimes people were out of synch with the moves.  These are small things, but still a little annoying.I do exercise daily and thought this might be a lighter day workout for me, but it really did make me sweat when I really powered into the moves, which range from kickboxing to old school squats, etc and yoga moves.Overall I would say if you are an advanced beginner or intermediate exerciser you could do this.  I would caution those that have knee issues or do not like high impact moves as there are several exercises that may not be for you.",3,Good for those between beginner & intermediate....,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,1703,"['borrowed', 'one', 'library', 'have', 'decided', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'fit', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'ticket', 'exercisers', 'Here', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'instructors', 'were', 'fine', 'motivating', 'pushing', 'finish', 'reps', 'exercises', 'were', 'easy', 'follow', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'simple', 'moves', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'leaps', 'squats', 'weights', 'lunges', 'etc', 'segments', 'are', 'short', 'approx', '15', 'minutes', 'allow', 'customize', 'routine', 'longer', 'shorter', 'piece', 'exercisers', 'were', 'show', 'Sometimes', 'refreshing', 'see', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'need', 'exercise', 'shown', 'instead', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'have', 'perfect', 'abs', 'skinny', 'thighs', 'like', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'showed', 'variations', 'when', 'moves', 'were', 'too', 'challenging', 'great', 'thing', 'showing', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'can', 'modify', 'move', 'still', 'get', 'workout', 'work', 'up', 'move.The', 'cons', 'was', 'was', 'routine', 'felt', 'would', 'get', 'bored', 'too', 'easily', 'also', 'felt', 'occasionally', 'was', 'sloppy', 'form', 'few', 'exercisers', 'was', ""n't"", 'corrected', 'sometimes', 'people', 'were', 'synch', 'moves', 'are', 'small', 'things', 'still', 'little', 'annoying.I', 'do', 'exercise', 'daily', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'lighter', 'day', 'really', 'did', 'make', 'sweat', 'when', 'really', 'powered', 'moves', 'range', 'kickboxing', 'old', 'school', 'squats', 'etc', 'yoga', 'moves.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'could', 'do', 'would', 'caution', 'have', 'knee', 'issues', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'high', 'impact', 'moves', 'are', 'several', 'exercises', 'may', 'not', 'be']",The Biggest Loser: Calorie Knockout

What I loved about it is &#34;calories burned&#34; and to knockout those extra pounds or fat. This was the first time I have ever picked up one of their tapes and wondered what the contestants have to do on the show. Where here it is! I loved this one and was able to complete the entire workouts.Anna is the easiest but she will do those jumping jacks. Ugh. 30 one round and 50 the last round. Not me. Oddly when I was an athlete in high school, these were one of my favorite exercises we had to do when I played volleyball and softball, don't recall doing much when I played basketball.Bob Harper is the hardest on this DVD. He will make you sweat for sure. Maybe sore too?! If you do modified moves, you will be okay.Dolvett Quince tabatta is second to hardest, or second to easier, depending on your drive and metabolism, or how you workout. I also can finish it because I am looking at his gorgeous smile and confidence to push through the workout itself. Never slacked on this one.Warmup and cool down is cool.I did notice that it says 15 minutes per workout but Anna does 11:30 minutes, the other two 15 minutes and a few seconds over the time. Warm up is 5 minutes but cool down is about the same.Adrienna Turner, author of The Day Begins with Christ*Hope to get as a Christmas gift.

I have over 300 workout dvds and I thought this one was great and it was not boring at all.  I workout about 6 days a week for about an hour and 30 minutes and I could definitely  tell you that this dvd was not easy and obviously if you do not like to exercise you are going to find any workout boring.

1495460,AI079T7UA2U00,B005N8KPD6,Kelsey,"[3, 4]","I have done a lot of workout DVDs, and I have to say, Anna is by far the worst, and I mean WORST, instructor I have ever seen. She doesn't count down so you have no idea how many more of ie. jumping jacks you have to do. She just stops and goes into something new. She also tells you to watch Vinny and someone else for modifications, but she never introduces them in the beginning! You can clearly see who they are eventually, but it's all up to you.I only did the Circuit #1 with Anna, and even though Anna is TERRIBLE, the workout is pretty good. I did sweat. But since she's terrible, the workout is choppy and the transitions aren't smooth at all. I did like most of the exercises though, but be prepared, she goes quickly into new things without warning.I'll have to do Circuits #2 and #3 to get a full opinion, but so far, workouts are good, but Anna is bad.",3,"Good workout, but Anna is TERRIBLE!!",1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,865,"['have', 'done', 'lot', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'have', 'say', 'Anna', 'far', 'worst', 'mean', 'WORST', 'instructor', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""n't"", 'count', 'down', 'so', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'ie', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'have', 'do', 'just', 'stops', 'something', 'new', 'also', 'watch', 'Vinny', 'someone', 'else', 'modifications', 'never', 'beginning', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'who', 'are', 'eventually', 'up', 'you.I', 'only', 'did', 'Circuit', '1', 'Anna', 'even', 'Anna', 'TERRIBLE', 'workout', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', 'sweat', 'terrible', 'workout', 'choppy', 'transitions', 'are', ""n't"", 'smooth', 'did', 'most', 'exercises', 'be', 'prepared', 'quickly', 'new', 'things', 'warning.I', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'Circuits', '2', '3', 'get', 'full', 'opinion', 'so', 'far', 'workouts', 'are', 'good', 'Anna', 'bad']",The Biggest Loser: Calorie Knockout

1495462,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B005N8KPD6,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[3, 3]","""Calorie Knockout"" is one of the most intense workouts I've ever done. Maybe it was because I did all three circuits on one day one after the other. There is a nice warm up and a cool down. The circuits are intense because of the pace and for most of the time you are using weights. I'd suggest three pound weights as they seemed heavy enough because of the speed of the exercises. You are going to sweat doing these circuits as they are seriously intense. You will be doing lunges, squats, jumping jacks, kicks and boxing moves. I thought all the three instructors were good and I could follow along great. OK maybe I was a little slower but there were few things I had to modify. The only thing I have to complain about is how Bob makes you hold positions for so long. I had to come out of the positions a few times because it was too intense. Anna was cute and Dolvett has a huge beautiful smile. Dolvett communicates with you in a mild drill sergeant-like style which is amusing and makes you work harder than you would. Anyway I think you get your money's worth when you buy this DVD.~The Rebecca Review",5,A Serious Workout for Intermediates,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,1108,"['Calorie', 'Knockout', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'Maybe', 'was', 'did', 'three', 'circuits', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'other', 'nice', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'circuits', 'are', 'intense', 'pace', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'using', 'weights', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'three', 'pound', 'weights', 'seemed', 'heavy', 'enough', 'speed', 'exercises', 'are', 'going', 'sweat', 'doing', 'circuits', 'are', 'seriously', 'intense', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'lunges', 'squats', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'kicks', 'boxing', 'moves', 'thought', 'three', 'instructors', 'were', 'good', 'could', 'follow', 'along', 'great', 'OK', 'maybe', 'was', 'little', 'slower', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'had', 'modify', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'complain', 'about', 'how', 'Bob', 'hold', 'positions', 'so', 'long', 'had', 'come', 'positions', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'too', 'intense', 'Anna', 'was', 'cute', 'Dolvett', 'huge', 'beautiful', 'smile', 'Dolvett', 'mild', 'drill', 'sergeant-like', 'style', 'amusing', 'work', 'harder', 'would', 'Anyway', 'think', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'when', 'buy', 'DVD.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",The Biggest Loser: Calorie Knockout
