453325,AQ7ZQWXAYT8HZ,6305180822,"Michael R. Chernick ""statman31147""","[41, 41]","The Yankees are my team.  I adopted them as a child in the 1950s when I grew up in New York and inspite of their success and unpopularity they remain my team. I have seen the dynasty of the 1950s and early 60s.  Their fall in 1965 and resurrection in 1976.  After 1981 they suffered a drought until 1996 and Joe Torre constructed his best team in 1998.  While Sosa and McGwire were annihilating Maris' home run record the Yankees quietly amassed one of the best winning records in the history of the game and the San Diego Padres made it to the World Series.  The Yankees had it all pitching, hitting, defense and power.  The Padres were no match for this ream and got swept.  It is arguable whether this was the greatest Yankee team I ever witnessed.  The 1961 Yankees behind the home run power of Mantle and Maris and the piych of Ford an Arroyo were certainly up there even if the won-loss record was not quite a match.  I would say one of these two Yankee teams was the best ever.  I know some will say the 1927 Yanks were.This 1998 series is not a very exciting series as the Yankees ran away with it.  But it is a treat to look at it just to remember how great they were.",5,Best Yankee team since Mantle and Maris,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,1177,"['Yankees', 'are', 'team', 'adopted', 'child', '1950s', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'inspite', 'success', 'unpopularity', 'remain', 'team', 'have', 'seen', 'dynasty', '1950s', 'early', '60s', 'fall', '1965', 'resurrection', '1976', '1981', 'suffered', 'drought', '1996', 'Joe', 'Torre', 'constructed', 'best', 'team', '1998', 'Sosa', 'McGwire', 'were', 'annihilating', 'Maris', 'home', 'run', 'record', 'Yankees', 'quietly', 'amassed', 'one', 'best', 'winning', 'records', 'history', 'game', 'San', 'Diego', 'Padres', 'made', 'World', 'Series', 'Yankees', 'had', 'pitching', 'hitting', 'defense', 'power', 'Padres', 'were', 'match', 'ream', 'got', 'swept', 'arguable', 'was', 'greatest', 'Yankee', 'team', 'ever', 'witnessed', '1961', 'Yankees', 'home', 'run', 'power', 'Mantle', 'Maris', 'piych', 'Ford', 'Arroyo', 'were', 'certainly', 'there', 'even', 'won-loss', 'record', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'match', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'two', 'Yankee', 'teams', 'was', 'best', 'ever', 'know', 'will', 'say', '1927', 'Yanks', 'were.This', '1998', 'series', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'series', 'Yankees', 'ran', 'away', 'treat', 'look', 'just', 'remember', 'how', 'great', 'were']",1998 Official World Series Video - New York Yankees vs. San Diego Padres VHS
