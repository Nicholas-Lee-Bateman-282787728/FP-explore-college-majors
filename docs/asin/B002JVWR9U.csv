1272647,AKJONKU5DALMF,B002JVWR9U,"A.Marte ""Supernatural  Lover""","[3, 3]","I will be honest, I had really low hopes for this show. I remember the general theme books, having read them almost two decades ago, but thought nothing of the show because I am an adult and they were teen. There are far too many vampire themed sagas out right night; seeming to cater to every age bracket. I thought how could a show about teenage vampires, on the CW no less, be any good; I was wrong. I rented the first season form Netflix and really enjoyed it. It was fast-paced and I liked how the characters maintain all the traits from the novels even though most do not physically match. I do not mind that some main characters were not introduce or that others have changed genders because the writers have done a wonderful job of making it work. In fact while you know that the main characters are teens; they do not act the way that movies and the CW generally portrays them. The lore is very well placed and there is just enough violence to let you know these are real vampires/supernaturals. I found myself amazed that a network show could actually be better than a premium one.

1272648,AC3064RV9PV62,B002JVWR9U,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[0, 0]","WARNING:  may contain spoilers!FYI:  I'm reviewing strictly as a viewer of the series.  I've never read the books upon which the series is based.Vampire stories, films, and series have been done, re-done, overdone and underdone, for a good long while. A lifelong fan of the genre, I've made peace with the reality that a certain amount of repetition is inevitable in paranormal dramas.  ""The Vampire Diaries"" revisits many devices common to vampire fiction: Good Vampire Brother versus Evil Vampire Brother; Present Day Love Interest has identical looks to Vampire's former, long-lost love; Evil Pyschopath Vampire Brother may not be quite so evil as he seems.Despite these ""been there, done that"" plot devices, ""The Vampire Diaries"" earns its place as an entertaining, memorable series.  The show manages to reinvent the devices and make them its own. Multi-dimensional characters, great acting and excellent continuity contribute to a compelling viewing experience.The series unfolds like a great book that starts out a tad slow and takes a while to build up to the ""good stuff"" only to sweep its readers away through a fantastic read.  Patient viewers will appreciate ""Vampire Diaries"" for taking the time to ""tell the whole story."" Many of the early episodes introduce a lot of information and character development that enhance the later episodes.After avoiding ""Twilight's"" appalling mediocrity, I was reluctant to view a new teen paranormal series. I'm pleasantly surprised.  I like that Elena is an ordinary person (not a ""slayer"" or other ""special"" person/creature,) but she isn't the chronic ""Oh I am nobody without my vampire boyfriend!"" type.  She does not depend on vampire muscle to save the day, and has definitely done her part to save the day for vampires sometimes.The one disappointment I have for this series is the casual portrayal of and/or mention of teen indulgence in alcohol, substance abuse, and premarital sex. It's not a moral issue in my mind so much as pathetic to see all these ""good"" teens getting drunk/wasted (or talking about getting drunk/wasted) or having sex pretty casually. Just because it might be ""real"" doesn't mean I want to see it, especially if it's not relevant to the storyline.Fasinating secondary characters and storylines have emerged in this series. Jeremy and Anna's storyline is particularly touching. The writers manage to mix so many issues -- grief/bereavement, child abuse, child neglect, divorced families, classism -- into their storytelling.  Never a dull moment.  Numerous vampire citizens and guests reveal facets of a fascinating culture all their own. Interesting, for example, vampires don't seem hung up on race concerns.Finally, I really applaud the producers for featuring ""Vampire Diaries"" in a small, Southern town and not featuring a ton of ""hillbilly"" stereotypes and people talking with drawling accents that have become so typical of any Southern town portrayal.  ""Vampire Diaries"" introduces very believeable people, even the paranormal ones.Well worth a look.",5,Slow Introduction Works up to a great story,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,3037,"['WARNING', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'FYI', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'strictly', 'viewer', 'series', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'books', 'series', 'based.Vampire', 'stories', 'films', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'done', 're-done', 'overdone', 'underdone', 'good', 'long', 'lifelong', 'fan', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'made', 'peace', 'reality', 'certain', 'amount', 'repetition', 'inevitable', 'paranormal', 'dramas', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'many', 'devices', 'common', 'vampire', 'fiction', 'Good', 'Vampire', 'Brother', 'versus', 'Evil', 'Vampire', 'Brother', 'Present', 'Day', 'Love', 'Interest', 'identical', 'looks', 'Vampire', 'former', 'long-lost', 'love', 'Evil', 'Pyschopath', 'Vampire', 'Brother', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'so', 'evil', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'plot', 'devices', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'place', 'entertaining', 'memorable', 'series', 'show', 'reinvent', 'devices', 'make', 'own', 'Multi-dimensional', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'excellent', 'continuity', 'contribute', 'compelling', 'viewing', 'experience.The', 'series', 'unfolds', 'great', 'book', 'out', 'tad', 'slow', 'while', 'build', 'up', 'good', 'stuff', 'only', 'sweep', 'readers', 'away', 'fantastic', 'read', 'Patient', 'viewers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'taking', 'time', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'Many', 'early', 'episodes', 'introduce', 'lot', 'information', 'character', 'development', 'later', 'episodes.After', 'avoiding', 'Twilight', 'appalling', 'mediocrity', 'was', 'reluctant', 'view', 'new', 'teen', 'paranormal', 'series', ""'m"", 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'like', 'Elena', 'ordinary', 'person', 'not', 'slayer', 'other', 'special', 'person/creature', ""n't"", 'chronic', 'Oh', 'am', 'nobody', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', 'type', 'not', 'depend', 'vampire', 'muscle', 'save', 'day', 'definitely', 'done', 'part', 'save', 'day', 'vampires', 'sometimes.The', 'one', 'disappointment', 'have', 'series', 'casual', 'portrayal', 'and/or', 'mention', 'teen', 'indulgence', 'alcohol', 'substance', 'abuse', 'premarital', 'sex', 'not', 'moral', 'issue', 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'pathetic', 'see', 'good', 'teens', 'getting', 'drunk/wasted', 'talking', 'getting', 'drunk/wasted', 'having', 'sex', 'pretty', 'casually', 'Just', 'might', 'be', 'real', ""n't"", 'mean', 'want', 'see', 'especially', 'not', 'relevant', 'storyline.Fasinating', 'secondary', 'characters', 'storylines', 'have', 'emerged', 'series', 'Jeremy', 'Anna', 'storyline', 'particularly', 'touching', 'writers', 'manage', 'mix', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'grief/bereavement', 'child', 'abuse', 'child', 'neglect', 'divorced', 'families', 'classism', 'storytelling', 'dull', 'moment', 'Numerous', 'vampire', 'citizens', 'guests', 'reveal', 'facets', 'fascinating', 'culture', 'own', 'Interesting', 'example', 'vampires', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hung', 'up', 'race', 'concerns.Finally', 'really', 'applaud', 'producers', 'featuring', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'not', 'featuring', 'ton', 'hillbilly', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'talking', 'drawling', 'accents', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'typical', 'Southern', 'town', 'portrayal', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'introduces', 'very', 'believeable', 'people', 'even', 'paranormal', 'ones.Well', 'look']",N/A

I was reading Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series before vampires were a trend. Back when the books were funny, quirky mysteries. Janet Evanovich with vampires. There is much less humor now that the author seems to be writing more for the TV series. I watch it anyway, and still read the books.During the first episode or two, I thought this series might not be worth watching. Teen angst, etc. I gave it another episode or two and was hooked. The plots kept getting better and more complicated. Usually, it surprises me in some way in each episode. It is scary, but not too scary for me. The music is perfect for each episode, and adds a lot to the story. There is no humor in the series, but it is appropriate.There is still some teen angst in each episode. That is the main audience. I think. It is no longer the focal point, however, and that widened its appeal for me. I'm learning more about the vampires' back stories, as well as Elena's and Bonnie's past.

When this show was first announced on the CW Network, I was a little leery, but hopeful. When series producer/writer Kevin Williamson(Scream, Dawson's Creek) said it would be ""more Buffy than Twilight"", I was intrigued and hopeful. Could it be?. This was the CW and all, but I was optimistic. I am so glad I tuned in. Let's get started....""The Vampire Diaries"" takes place in a nice little town called Mystic Falls. Elena Gilbert and her brother Jeremy(Nina Dobrev, Steven R. McQueen) are high school students. They live with their aunt after the death of their parents. Elena meets mysterious broody guy Stefan(Paul Wesley), vampire, and sparks fly. Unfortunatley for them and the town, Stefan's brother Damon(Ian Somerhalder), wild vampire extraordinaire, comes to town and begins to shake things up amongst the locals and Elena's group of friends.Okay, obviously that is the short, condensed version of things. Truth is, A LOT goes on in this show. It has a decent sized cast with recurring members coming and going. That's not even the tip of the iceberg. Better to let you watch and discover everything unfold in the show yourself. Amongst the 22 episodes of season 1, here are some of the stuff you can expect. Again, the condensed version of a few eps as to not give much away. The ""Pilot"" episode was good, sets things up, but isn't indicative of the maturing and twists and turns the show would make over the season. ""The Night Of The Comet"", episode 2, is the episode where Elena and Damon first meet. It's a Founder's party in episode 4, ""Family Ties"", where we learn some of the town elders know of the town's dark secrets. This is when the show starts to grow and take interesting turns. Stefan finally explains his past to Elena, via flashbacks to 1864, in episode 6, ""Lost Girls"". Halloween rears it's festive head in episode 7, ""Haunted"", which also deals with the death of a character. New history teacher Alaric Saltzman(Matt Davis)shows up in episode 9, ""History Repeating"", and he may be more than just a history teacher. Damon also reveals his true motives for showing up in town in this episode. Episode 13, ""Children Of The Dammned"", features more 1864 flashbacks. ""Let The Right One In"", episode 17, has Damon and Elena rescuing Stefan. Elena and Jeremy's shady uncle John shows up in town in episode 18, ""Under Control"". ""Miss Mystic Falls"", episode 19, has Elena learning of Stefan's recent urges while competing in a Founder's Day gala. Episode 22, the season finale, ""Founder's Day"", is a whirlwind of a finale. There were at least 4 cliffhangers in this episode that made every fan want to jump to season 2 immediatley.Like many, I feared TVD would be lighter and watered down ala ""Twilight"", but I am here to wipe away those fears. While TVD is not in the league of that slayer in Sunnydale, it is far from the land of Edward and Bella. TVD is darker, edgier, sexier, more violent, more dangerous, and filled with more history and shocking surprises and twists and turns. Kevin Williamson and crew have created a show that continually surprised me with story twists during the entire season. It seemed they weren't happy unless they ended almost every episode with a shocker. Credit goes to Williamson and the rest of the show's writers. They have really created an atmopsheric town filled with rich characters. Some may seem like CW-lite teen people from the beginning, but that changes. The whole show changes. You can really see the show gaining ground and it's bearings as the debut season rolls along. It really is different to watch the finale and then the pilot. It also doesn't hurt that TVD boasts the best looking cast on TV. Would you expect anything less on the CW?. Despite the attractiveness of the cast, they can act. They are not just faces. Nina Dobrev, as Elena, is an amazing, soulful beauty, as is Katerina Graham as best friend Bonnie. However, it is Ian Somerhalder as Damon who seems to be having the most fun.

1272669,AB34G6VKP28L,B002JVWR9U,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 1]","In the early nineties, a book series by L. J. Smith became popular that featured a young woman caught between two immortal brothers. The series introduced witches, vampires, and werewolves onto bookstore shelves and inspired some of the plot twists in the Buffy series, as well as the Twilight saga. While many changes have been made from the source material in bringing the series to the small screen, it maintains the creepiness and romantic edge of the books.It has been six months since the Gilberts' car plunged through the railing of a bridge outside town and the parents drowned in the river. Elena (Nina Dobrev) was pulled free of the wreckage and managed to survive, but has been left orphaned along with her brother Jeremy (Stephen R. McQueen). Living with their aunt Jenna (Sara Canning) and struggling to keep her brother out of trouble, Elena soon encounters the handsome and mysterious Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley). Tall, dark and charming, it doesn't take long for romantic sparks to ignite between them, much to the envy of her friends Caroline (Candice Accola) and Bonnie (Katerina Graham). What Elena does not realize is that Stefan is a vampire who abandoned the region years earlier and has returned to watch over her since Elena reminds him profoundly of Katherine, a woman he loved and lost during the Civil War. But her presence and his attentiveness have brought another immortal to town: his older and far more ruthless brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder). Having feuded over Katherine more than a century earlier, Damon has sworn to make Stefan ""suffer for all eternity,"" and to do that he intends to corrupt Elena. Seducing Caroline into a relationship and injecting himself into Stefan's world, Damon is a growing threat and his brutal behavior around town sets off warning bells to those old enough to remember the last time the local vampires were out of control. In the meantime, Bonnie is dealing with the realization that she has magical powers, and all her instincts are warning her that Elena is not safe - especially around Stefan.When I first heard about this series I was not impressed, but the strength of the season as it gained momentum convinced me it is one of the most well thought out and paced shows on television. The writing is tremendous, full of constant twists and turns and minor revelations that build toward an intense finale. Fans of the book series should be forewarned, however, that only minor similarities to the novel remain. The characters are much altered in significant ways and other individuals are simply excluded altogether. Most of the history of the Salvatore brothers remains somewhat intact but the differences are noticeable. However, it does maintain the strength of the book in the fact that it accurately represents the creepiness of the original works. Everyone is great in their respective roles, but Somerhalder is particularly good as Damon. We are never quite certain if he is trustworthy but at the same time our interest in him continues to expand. Later on, two notable regulars join the cast -- Alaric Saltzman (Matthew Davis) as a professor with a dark secret, and Elena's sinister uncle (David Anders).There are several underlining mysteries that surround the town and its unusual heritage, and flashbacks provide an excuse to show off lovely Civil War costumes. It promises a twist ending every week and more than delivers. It features wonderful performances, a terrific soundtrack that includes a lot of popular songs, and immense creativity in its characters. It pays homage to the original books but strikes out in a new direction that leaves its audience hanging.",5,This Show Has Bite,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3652,"['early', 'nineties', 'book', 'series', 'L.', 'J.', 'Smith', 'became', 'popular', 'featured', 'young', 'woman', 'caught', 'two', 'immortal', 'brothers', 'series', 'introduced', 'witches', 'vampires', 'bookstore', 'shelves', 'inspired', 'plot', 'twists', 'Buffy', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'many', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'source', 'material', 'bringing', 'series', 'small', 'screen', 'creepiness', 'romantic', 'edge', 'books.It', 'been', 'six', 'months', 'Gilberts', 'car', 'plunged', 'railing', 'bridge', 'town', 'parents', 'drowned', 'river', 'Elena', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'was', 'pulled', 'free', 'wreckage', 'managed', 'survive', 'been', 'left', 'orphaned', 'brother', 'Jeremy', 'Stephen', 'R.', 'McQueen', 'Living', 'aunt', 'Jenna', 'Sara', 'Canning', 'struggling', 'keep', 'brother', 'trouble', 'Elena', 'soon', 'handsome', 'mysterious', 'Stefan', 'Salvatore', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'Tall', 'dark', 'charming', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'ignite', 'much', 'envy', 'friends', 'Caroline', 'Candice', 'Accola', 'Bonnie', 'Katerina', 'Graham', 'What', 'Elena', 'not', 'realize', 'Stefan', 'vampire', 'who', 'abandoned', 'region', 'years', 'earlier', 'returned', 'watch', 'Elena', 'profoundly', 'Katherine', 'woman', 'loved', 'lost', 'Civil', 'War', 'presence', 'attentiveness', 'have', 'brought', 'immortal', 'town', 'older', 'far', 'more', 'ruthless', 'brother', 'Damon', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'Having', 'feuded', 'Katherine', 'more', 'century', 'earlier', 'Damon', 'sworn', 'make', 'Stefan', 'suffer', 'eternity', 'do', 'corrupt', 'Elena', 'Seducing', 'Caroline', 'relationship', 'injecting', 'Stefan', 'world', 'Damon', 'growing', 'threat', 'brutal', 'behavior', 'town', 'sets', 'off', 'warning', 'bells', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'local', 'vampires', 'were', 'control', 'meantime', 'Bonnie', 'dealing', 'realization', 'magical', 'powers', 'instincts', 'are', 'warning', 'Elena', 'not', 'safe', 'especially', 'Stefan.When', 'first', 'heard', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'strength', 'season', 'gained', 'momentum', 'convinced', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'paced', 'shows', 'television', 'writing', 'tremendous', 'full', 'constant', 'twists', 'turns', 'minor', 'revelations', 'build', 'intense', 'finale', 'Fans', 'book', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'forewarned', 'however', 'only', 'minor', 'similarities', 'novel', 'remain', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'altered', 'significant', 'ways', 'other', 'individuals', 'are', 'simply', 'excluded', 'altogether', 'Most', 'history', 'Salvatore', 'brothers', 'somewhat', 'intact', 'differences', 'are', 'noticeable', 'However', 'maintain', 'strength', 'book', 'fact', 'accurately', 'creepiness', 'original', 'works', 'Everyone', 'great', 'respective', 'roles', 'Somerhalder', 'particularly', 'good', 'Damon', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'certain', 'trustworthy', 'same', 'time', 'interest', 'expand', 'Later', 'two', 'notable', 'regulars', 'join', 'cast', 'Alaric', 'Saltzman', 'Matthew', 'Davis', 'professor', 'dark', 'secret', 'Elena', 'sinister', 'uncle', 'David', 'Anders', 'are', 'several', 'underlining', 'mysteries', 'surround', 'town', 'unusual', 'heritage', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'lovely', 'Civil', 'War', 'costumes', 'twist', 'ending', 'week', 'more', 'delivers', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'terrific', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'popular', 'songs', 'immense', 'creativity', 'characters', 'homage', 'original', 'books', 'out', 'new', 'direction', 'audience', 'hanging']",N/A

1272671,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B002JVWR9U,Claire,"[1, 1]","As a huge fan of vampire lore as well as other elements of the supernatural I will say that this series is one of the better takes on the vampire craze that has swept through the entertainment industry of late. There are so many shows/movies out nowadays dealing with vampires and their supernatural cousins werewolves plus witches too that it is hard to keep up with everything. My introduction into Hollywood's take on vampires came in 1987 when ""The Lost Boys"" was released and I fell in love with the concept of vampirism, especially when I saw how handsome the vamps were with their rock star good looks. Kiefer Sutherland made one great vamp. Then later ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" the movie came out in 1992 followed by the show in 1997 and its spinoff ""Angel"" all of which rekindled my affection for the genre. It didn't hurt that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt also made it look appealing to have fangs and suck blood in ""Interview With The Vampire"" in 1994. So in keeping with my interest in the vampire mythology I began to watch all the newer vamp shows- ""True Blood,"" ""Being Human,"" the movies ""Twilight""- and also ""The Vampire Diaries."" I have to say that Diaries in my opinion is the most appealing of all the recent takes on vamps and it even covers, as all the aforementioned shows do, the equally popular werewolf lore plus even throws in a witch or two. Now that the zombie popularity wave has swept through eclipsing the vamp/werewolf craze I'm waiting for a show or movie that combines ALL the different supernatural elements.Diaries is interesting for one thing b/c the books on which the show is based came out in 1991, way before any of these other popular shows burst onto the scene. I don't know why it took so long for them to be adapted into a tv show but I'm glad Kevin Williamson took an interest in developing them. Making a name for himself by bringing us movies such as ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" he was the perfect visionary genius to translate this wonderful story of a girl in love with two brothers- one generally good, the other a bad-boy- to the small screen. I'm glad also that he chose to use television instead of film to do it so that the story can go on and on. Thankfully ""Twilight"" is now over but Diaries can go on and on with new characters and new stories adding to the old characters and stories.This show gives us a chance to grow with it- grow with the stories and the characters. The characters and plots are not one-sided but are multidimensional which makes for some great entertainment. At the center of the story initially is the love triangle between Elena and the vampire Salvatore Brothers- Stefan (Elena's smoldering white knight) and Damon (her smokin' dark knight)- both of whom are in love with her. This first season pretty much centers on their relationship while friends circle the periphery coming into their own with time. Elena's friends Caroline and Bonnie are a vampire and a witch respectively. Males also in Elena's world include Tyler who is coming to terms with being a werewolf and Alaric who is a vampire hunter plus ex-boyfriend Matt and little brother Jeremy who has his own problems. Elena is learning about herself while processing the changing roles of those around her and dealing with high school in the aftermath of her parents' tragic death.The show is dark and mysterious with very little tongue in cheek humor that made Buffy so clever. It explores the mysteries and past of the town instead of focusing on high school which is refreshing and appealing since we've had so much exposure to high school with Buffy and Twilight, just to name a couple. A big part of the show is the town's and the characters' past which is often shown in flashbacks. (I'm not sure why several reviewers seem to think the characters are time-traveling? It is obvious the past is being seen in flashbacks as the characters are remembering their history. As far as I can tell, no one does any time traveling here.)Season 1 has lots of good writing and storytelling plus lots of interesting characters and plot twists- never a dull person or moment with this show. It is rather exciting and not over the top graphic gore. The creators do not waste such a delicious premise by ruining it with graphic gore, sex or profanity. This show is plenty scary and is a bit mature in theme. I also like the creativity with which this show is made- that makes it more appealing than the dull Twilight theme which got old after the 2nd or 3rd installment. The actors are pretty good too. At first I wasn't happy with the show version of Elena since the book portrayed her differently. However, the tv Elena now seems a stronger character than the book heroine. I remember Paul Wesley from a ""Smallville"" episode and he has come into his own on this show as Stefan. To me, the most appealing star is Ian Somerhaulder who as Damon owns this character.This show is definitely worth watching and even holds its own among all the other vamp shows and flicks out there. I'd say it only takes a couple of episodes to get into it and once you're sucked in (excuse the pun) you won't want to quit. Expect to marathon watch the season through to the end. My guess is you won't be disappointed. I imagine it appeals mostly to teenage girls but I'm almost 40 and I've watched it with my 13 year-old godson who likes it, as well as with my 64 year-old mom who is addicted to it too. I don't think it is limited to any age group. It might appeal more to females than males but who knows?",5,One of the better vampire shows.,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,5538,"['huge', 'fan', 'vampire', 'lore', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'elements',

They rip out heats and break necks.Very good action and storylines. One of the best shows on tv and guys do like thiis show. If you like vampires this isa good show! Avoid that Tru Blood crap.

Adults play a larger role than in many other ""teen"" series, but mostly the kids do as they please. Enough subplots and questions to keep you interested, if not enthralled.Somewhat unoriginal and predictable plot lines, but the story starts to get more interesting towards end of Season 1.Supernatural and other creatures in Season 1:Vampires (old and newly-made), witches. Teens and parents in role-reversals.(Spoiler Alert): I'm ready for Season 2 when other creatures start showing up. The high school mascot is a Timberwolf, ya know.Yes, it's aimed towards teens/young adults. Yes, these (old) vampires do very stupid things at times.  But it's better than most other things on TV these days. The flashbacks to the 1800s are usually pretty fun as well, and slowly fill in some of the reasons the vampires behave as they do. And of course the ""bad"" brother is much more interesting than the ""good"" one.If you like vampires, drama, and cute actors/actresses, it's worth watching. If you are expecting something along the lines of Underworld, stay away.By the way: 100+ year-old vampires pining after teenage girls (and vice-versa) is a bit creepy.  But this series beats the heck out of Twilight. Vampire Diaries vamps do NOT sparkle. They burn.Parents:  Yes, there's sex, both on-screen (with some skin showing), and talked about a bit.

1272692,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002JVWR9U,Haunted Flower,"[3, 3]","22 Episodes on 4 Blu-Ray Discs, released August 31, 2010The vampire craze continues with this series based on the book series by L. J. Smith. It follows high school student, Elena played by Nina Dobrev who falls in love with vampire Stephen Salvatore played by Paul Wesley and ends up caught in a love triangle with him and his older brother, Damon played by Ian Somerhalder (Boone from Lost) due to a past history they have with a woman named Katherine Pierce who is the mirror image of Elena.When this series came out, I watched the first three episodes, got bored, and stopped. This was mainly due to the melodramatic nature of teen romance, the annoying ""Dear Diary"" type voiceovers, and the angst being through the roof. The series becomes much more entertaining when it stops being about who is dating who, tormented family past, and drugs and switches to an awareness about the vampires, a town history, and Elena's best friend, Bonnie (Katerina Graham) discovering she is a witch and learning to use her powers. When these secrets begin to be shared between the main cast members, the story gets a lot more interesting as unlikely pairs teams up against outside forces of vampires coming to town and a mysterious tomb buried locally that is supposed to contain Katherine herself and several other malnourished vampire souls just waiting to be released.Nina Dobrev's Elena is a beautiful doe-eyed innocent and actually pulls off being interesting and deep enough for a vampire to come to town just to get to know her better. She has a very highly functioning morality compass and always wants to do the right thing by her friends and family. Even more so on the scale of do-gooders is her vampire boyfriend, Stephen. Take Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and mash him together with the vegetarian Edward Cullen from the ""Twilight"" series and you'll get Stephen. From their combined facial features to personalities, Stephen is a tortured vampire looking for love but not wishing to sacrifice his woman's happiness from head to toe. Occasionally Stephen or Elena will inform the other the painful truth that they shouldn't be together for the well-being of the other but are unable to stay apart for long.While other towns may boast of a ""rich"" town history, this town seems to make good on that. Townspeople have been secretly gathering information about vampires for years and the lady sheriff of the town seems to be the head of the offensive force when they suspect vampires have come back to town. Stephen's brother, Damon seems to still carry a torch for Katherine, the woman they both fought over years ago and wishes to free her, but also engages himself regularly in trying to thwart the police for their mutual safety and cover.This series is pretty entertaining when it doesn't dwell on high school problems of dating and focuses on the creatures of the night. I would mostly recommend it for teenagers through the 30's crowd and particularly enjoy Ian Somerhalder's presence after his turn on Lost being so short. Here he almost plays the Sawyer character as a vampire since he helps out for his brother and Elena, but is often the antagonist as well and always is playing for his own best interests.Bonus Features:It looks spectacular on Blu-ray, especially during vampire/witch special effects. There are over 8 hours of special features including four featurettes, unaired scenes, and a gag reel. Some of the Featurettes include: ""Into Mystic Falls: Bringing Vampire Lore and the High School Experience from Page to Screen"", ""When Vampires Don't Suck!: The Popularity of Vampires and the Fans Who Love Them"", ""The Vampire Diaries: A New Breed of Vampires - Casting the Series"", and ""The Vampire Diaries: Vampires 101 - The Rules of the Vampire."" There is commentary from the creators and director on the Pilot episode and a well-advised spoiler alert that you should watch the whole season before listening and stuff is given away! There is also ""The Vampire Diaries: A Darker Truth Webisodes"" and the most unique aspect about getting the Blu-Ray version would be the Downloadable Audiobook of the Bestselling Novel The Vampire Diaries: The Awakening by L.J.

Vampire Diaries is simply amazing and like I said its a million times better than Twilight. And im not trying to bash Twilight at all, im a fan of the books and I watch the movies cause they're a guilty pleasure. But VD blows them BOTH out of the water! Ive never read the VD books so I cannot say how well the show compares to them but I don't care, this show is simply fantastic. Its everything Twilight wishes it could be. And my favorite part about it is its actually not afraid to be a little mature and grown up. Your not going to get any frickin ""Glittery"" vampires in this show. And yes while Damon and Stephan are both completely dreamy and gorgeous they can be dangerous and violent if need be. They're not the wimpy type of vampires that are so sadly being so popular at the moment. What also made me very pleasantly happy is that even though this was only the first season of the show it was so well developed and entertaining! The writers and directors and producers really are very talented and know how to out together an awesome show from the very beginning. Every actor in this show is amazing as well. They are all very strong and there's no one that brings the show down, I didn't like Caroline at first but she's definitely growing on me. My favorite character has to be Bonny, Elena's friend who discovers she has special powers. I absolutely love her character and everything she goes through. Also this show has some SERIOUS eye candy!!! Stephan and Damon are Blazing Hot and Tyler is very cute as well. CW does a very good job at getting some good hunks to be on their shows lol. They girls are also very sexy as well so straight guys have something to like about it too haha. So if you even remotely like vampire stories or are a Twilight fan you HAVE to watch this show, its simply Amazing! Everything about it is spot on perfect. You will not be disappointed with this show I can guarantee it!

Stefan gets with her, which leads Damon to be jealous, but he's still protective of Elena.Damon is both good and bad, you never know when he'll kill an innocent or help them, he's unpredictable which is why I like the show. Damon always makes things more interesting and Ian may not be the best actor around, but he's probably at least the best actor on the show. Damon is at least the best character that's making it to season 2.Some fans complain that the more likable characters in the show die, when the annoying ones live on. I won't mention names, but a certain vampire girl that I loved was killed off, so I kind of agree that the show kills off some of the better characters. Damn, she was mad cute too and she wasn't whiny or annoying like some of the other girl characters can be.I rolled my eyes the first time I saw a commercial for Vampire Diaries, I was expecting a Twilight rip-off. Hell I was thinking True Blood was one too. But it turns out that the Vampire Diaries and True Blood books have been around longer. So, sorry Twilight fans, Twilight didn't invent vampire and human couples. I'm sorry but Let the Right One In (or the American version Let Me In) book has also been around longer than Twilight as well. Hell, Buffy the Vampire Slayer did it long before Twilight too. My point is that...Twilight isn't as original as you think. I know that doesn't have much to do with my review, but I wanted to get that off my chest lol.",4,One of the better CW shows,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1796,"['Vampire', 'Diaries', 'may', 'be', 'mushy', 'CW', 'teen', 'drama', 'least', 'engaging', 'very', 'violent', 'normal', 'High', 'School', 'girl', 'Elena', 'Gilbert', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'attention', 'two', 'vampire', 'brothers', 'Stefan', 'Salvatore', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'Damon', 'Salvatore', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'Elena', 'lot', 'vampire', 'woman', 'once', 'loved', 'Stefan', 'Damon', 'be', 'jealous', 'still', 'protective', 'Elena.Damon', 'good', 'bad', 'never', 'know', 'when', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'innocent', 'help', 'unpredictable', 'why', 'show', 'Damon', 'always', 'things', 'more', 'interesting', 'Ian', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'actor', 'probably', 'least', 'best', 'actor', 'show', 'Damon', 'least', 'best', 'character', 'making', 'season', '2.Some', 'fans', 'complain', 'more', 'likable', 'characters', 'show', 'die', 'when', 'annoying', 'ones', 'live', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'names', 'certain', 'vampire', 'girl', 'loved', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'so', 'kind', 'agree', 'show', 'better', 'characters', 'Damn', 'was', 'mad', 'cute', 'too', 'was', ""n't"", 'whiny', 'annoying', 'other', 'girl', 'characters', 'can', 'be.I', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'commercial', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'was', 'expecting', 'Twilight', 'rip-off', 'Hell', 'was', 'thinking', 'True', 'Blood', 'was', 'one', 'too', 'out', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'True', 'Blood', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'around', 'longer', 'So', 'sorry', 'Twilight', 'fans', 'Twilight', 'did', ""n't"", 'invent', 'vampire', 'human', 'couples', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'American', 'version', 'Let', 'Me', 'book', 'also', 'been', 'around', 'longer', 'Twilight', 'as', 'well', 'Hell', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'did', 'long', 'Twilight', 'too', 'point', 'Twilight', ""n't"", 'as', 'original', 'think', 'know', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'review', 'wanted', 'get', 'off', 'chest', 'lol']",N/A

The innocent girl, the brooding, angst ridden vampire and then the bad boy vampire.  And get this -  our bad boy bites humans....yeah!!!This is a well acted show with some really good young talent.  Damon could be cliche, but Ian Somerhalder handles the character adeptly; making us love him one minute and angry with him the next.  He seems to really enjoy this role and it shows in every scene.  Stefan is a little boring, but he is our hero - a true gentleman and he has the heart of Elena, out heroine.  The supporting cast is really good as well, especially Caroline.

Let's just say I love her much more as Katherine, than Elena.All in all, I love this show, it's fun, dark, and very entertaining.EDIT: NOVEMBER 8TH, 2011I must retract my last statement about Nina Dobrev. In the last season and a half she has become a breakout star in the series, playing multiple characters in just one episode. She is by far just as strong an actor as Ian in the show and I must give credit where it's due.

It's what you would expect from a vampire show with the deep colors, especially red and people wearing a lot of black.It's hard to comment on the story yet. But it seems like it could get very deep. Each character seems to have a lot of issues to deal with on top of the every day high school stuff, and there is already plenty of conflict between a lot of the characters. Conflict between Good Brother and Evil Brother, one girl gets jealous of another and has to deal with it, and brother and sister have to cope with the loss of their parents, relationship issues...it's all here, but now with dak vampire storylines mixed in.I'd say this show would very highly appeal to teenagers but can be enjoyed by anyone.I also love the classic CW formula of playing great music in the show to deepen the emotional experience and to add to the insight of the characters.I'm looking forward to seeing how the story will play out.

I've seen clips of the show, prior to watching the series from the beginning, and it didn't grab me so much. It is a lot of conflict/drama going on in the series, and if you haven't followed it from the ""Pilot"" episode, you will be seriously lost.First off, vampires. Not as savage as the ""True Blood"" vamps, but more violent than the ones in ""Twilight"". I think what makes this show great is the sibling rivalry. Yes, Stefan Salvatore and Damon Salvatore are the vampire brothers of the series, fighting for one Elena Gilbert--the series lead. The story takes place in Mystic Falls, VA where Stefan finally mainstreams to get closer to Elena. The conflict?--well, she looks like his ex, Katherine, who also turns out to be his (SPOILER ALERT) sire. So, Elena's doppelganger is Stefan's ex. No problem; except, not only was Katherine Stefan's sire, she was also Damon's. Conflict!The series is watchable and is powerfully written. A lot of unexpected twists and it does treat the viewers with extreme care. Most vampire shows sugarcoat some of the violence, but this show is far from that. It is compared to ""Twilight"" because of certain hold backs, but on the contrary, it is NOTHING like ""Twilight"".

1272738,A12FLZREV32JOP,B002JVWR9U,Noelle Eiram,"[19, 19]","I thought the show would be worse than Twilight. Its setup is identical: a vampire falls in love with a high school girl. To my surprise, The Vampire Diaries kept me tuning in every week.Our heroine Elena (Nina Dobrev) lives in the historic Virginia town Mystic Falls. Her parents recently died in a car crash, leaving her and her dope-head brother Jeremy (Steve McQueen) in the care of their young aunt Jenna (Sara Canning), a lovable pal but sucky guardian. Elena's grief causes her to bond with the - unbeknownst to her - nice vampire stalker Stefan (Paul Wesley). Unfortunately, he has a vampire brother who is not so nice. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) enjoys making his brother's life miserable and has no qualms about eating humans. He also notices that Elena looks exactly like their (yes, their) ex who lived more than a century ago.Other cast members include Elena's cute ex Matt (Zach Roerig), his a-hole best friend Tyler (Michael Trevino), and Tyler's druggie girlfriend Vicki (Kayla Ewell). She is also Matt's sister and Jeremy's love. The town is incestuous. Then there are Elena's best friends Bonnie (Katerina Graham) and Caroline (Candice Accola). Bonnie is sweet and supportive; Caroline is blond and bitchy.It's... BelievableFor a cheesy show about gorgeous townsfolk and creatures of the night, it's surprisingly realistic. (Note: I am used to television-hot actors not CW-hot. These people look like no one I've met.) The most initially stereotypical characters turn out to be some of the most complex.It's FunnyThe Vampire Diaries doesn't take itself too seriously. The heroine's best friend matter-of-factly explains why she is psychic. They laugh at such a preposterous notion. (So does the audience, for other reasons, of course.) One vampire advises another: ""You're dead, dude. Get over it.""It's SurprisingEven though the series borrows heavily from previous vampire/teen stories, it follows its own path. It uses and plays with formulas. The pilot features Elena running through a foggy graveyard, complete with an ominous crow. It also quickly dissolves a budding love triangle clich&eacute; because a character actually acts sensibly.It's ConsistentThey've done a darn good job with the vampire mythology. The explanations, including questions of vampire morality, have a basic logic. Not only that, but the tone, pacing, and character development are dependable. Unlike many shows, actions (usually) have consequences. Characters have motivations and don't forget about what they did the previous week.The vampire ""look"" is perhaps the best I've seen. When vamps get blood hungry they sprout fangs. Eyes become bloodshot and veiny. These immortal serial killers are scary twists on their human selves, beastlike and vicious.The writing and acting are respectable. Nina Dobrev can be grating in a teenager-y way, but her Elena is an appealing character. Paul Wesley is somewhat one note, but he brings a wisdom and tenderness to the role of Stefan. That he manages to be less than creepy is a remarkable feat which alone elevates the show far above Twilight. Ian Somerhalder clearly relishes playing Damon, who is funny, flirtatious, and wicked, but perhaps not irredeemable.Certain scenes are ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious, but the camp is part of the fun. Due to historical echoes, intertwining relationships, and flashbacks to the brothers' vampire births, the show borders on epic.

After the show hits it's stride, it's pure, awesome, fast-paced fun. I can remembered dying to see the next episode only 2 episodes in.Not to mention the cast is completely sexy, and the love triangle is smokin' (You'll root one minute for Stefan and the next for Damon). I love vampires and always have, but this show is indeed more then that. It also, after a few episodes, transcends them being in high school so that it's not hitting you over the head constantly, making this show watchable for an older demographic as well.

I do like Angel and Buffy The Vampire Slayer. I have also been a fan of darker themed shows like Tru Calling. I tried to watch True Blood but it just seems to wild and crazy for my taste. My mother loves it though. I may sit through one day and try and watch it. I have started to rent a lot of Television shows that seem interesting. If it wasn't for that I would never become a fan of 24,Alias and Lost. I am afraid because I rented the first disc of this show, I became hooked. Now I have only seen the first 5 episodes on Standard DVD. Right after I finished those 5 episodes I immediately ordered The 1st season of The Vampire Dairies on Blu-Ray.What drew me to the show where the 3 lead characters Stefan(Paul Wesley), Damon (Ian Somerhalder)and Elena Gilbert(Nina Dobrev)I have seen Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder in smaller roles throughout the year. Paul Wesley was in the 2nd Season of Everwood and he was also on the last season of 24. Ian Somerhalder I watched through Lost but his character on the show was short lived. I also seen him in Smallville. These two finally get a show together that show of their true acting abilities. Stefan and Damon are brothers and one does not want to feed and the other does. They have a feud over each other because they both fell in love with a girl who they both lost. Stefan is drawn to the Nina Dobrev's character, Elena as she slowly starts to be suspicious of both of them and starts to see signs that Stefan is hiding from her.This is a great show and I am looking forward to finishing this season on blu-ray and hopefully I can catch up before the new season starts.Paul",4,Instant Buy For Me!,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1745,"['Vampire', 'DairiesI', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'vampire', 'shows', 'do', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'fan', 'darker', 'themed', 'shows', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'tried', 'watch', 'True', 'Blood', 'just', 'wild', 'crazy', 'taste', 'mother', 'may', 'sit', 'one', 'day', 'try', 'watch', 'have', 'started', 'rent', 'lot', 'Television', 'shows', 'seem', 'interesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'would', 'never', 'become', 'fan', '24', 'Alias', 'Lost', 'am', 'afraid', 'rented', 'first', 'disc', 'show', 'became', 'hooked', 'Now', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'Right', 'finished', '5', 'episodes', 'immediately', 'ordered', '1st', 'season', 'Vampire', 'Dairies', 'Blu-Ray.What', 'drew', 'show', 'where', '3', 'lead', 'characters', 'Stefan', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'Damon', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'Elena', 'Gilbert', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'have', 'seen', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'smaller', 'roles', 'year', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'was', '2nd', 'Season', 'Everwood', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'season', '24', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'watched', 'Lost', 'character', 'show', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'also', 'seen', 'Smallville', 'two', 'finally', 'get', 'show', 'together', 'show', 'true', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Stefan', 'Damon', 'are', 'brothers', 'one', 'not', 'want', 'feed', 'other', 'have', 'feud', 'other', 'fell', 'love', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'Stefan', 'drawn', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'character', 'Elena', 'starts', 'be', 'suspicious', 'see', 'signs', 'Stefan', 'hiding', 'her.This', 'great', 'show', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'finishing', 'season', 'blu-ray', 'hopefully', 'can', 'catch', 'up', 'new', 'season', 'starts.Paul']",N/A

1272745,A1QYOWY8H6MT16,B002JVWR9U,Phoenix Child,"[3, 3]","""The Vampire Diaries"" is the latest addition to a delightfully growing genre of gothic romance based on vampire lore. Playing like a teenage/young adult version of ""True Blood,"" the first season of ""The Vampire Diaries"" is engaging, intense, and ultimately as addictive as the human blood drained by the lead characters.""The Vampire Diaries"" tells the story of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), a serious and strong-willed girl who has just lived through personal tragedy and is trying to wake back up to the real world in the small, mysterious town of Mystic Falls, Virginia. Elena's life is quickly and irrevocably complicated by the arrival of two brothers in her life: Stefan and Damon Salvatore (Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder, respectively), two young men of wildly different temperament, both attractive, both somewhat unhealthily interested in her...and both vampires.As Elena is entangled in a web of increasingly dangerous dark side mythology, she finds that the world around her is not what she knew as the bloody and fascinating history of Mystic Falls begins to come alive around her, leading to shocking revelations and violent twists. As Elena learns of her and her friends' connections to the bloody vampiric past, a mysterious new history teacher (Matt Davis) with a hidden past has the power to shed shocking light on Elena's past, leaving viewers breathless for each new episode and ending the season on an explosive cliffhanger so tense it leaves viewers' hearts pounding in fear and excitement in equal turns.""The Vampire Diaries"" succeeds, first and foremost, on the strength of its characters. Elena is a grave young girl who has a fiercely strong core. She is unafraid to stand up for what she believes in, and it is her iron will that guides her through her dealings with the Salvatore brothers. She is never weak or overwhelmed when dealing with Stefan's vampire nature -- she falls in love with Stefan *despite* the fact that he is a vampire, rather than because of it. It is the strength of her heart that breaks through to the human buried beneath the darker Damon, though the consequences of that awakening may be more brutal than Elena had counted on.Stefan is a delightfully nuanced character, at once taking some cues from ""Angel"" but retaining a new energy. Stefan's struggles with both his way of life and his dealings with Damon are intensely real. And as for Damon? How long has it been since we've seen television vampires who take genuine glee in their immortality? As the body count stacks up at Damon's feet, he is at turns hilariously over-the-top and terrifyingly evil. It's always unsettling to see the youthful and beautiful faces of the vampires change at a moment's notice to a twisted, ugly and veiny countenance.""The Vampire Diaries"" also hosts a truly fascinating cast of secondary characters who each has their own story to tell: Elena's younger brother Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen), a brooding presence whose unhealthy ways of dealing with grief are intensely empathetic; Elena's best friend Bonnie (Katerina Graham), who discovers that she is a powerful witch and as directly linked to Mystic Falls' nightmarish past as Elena herself; Caroline (Candice Accola), a strong-willed girl who hides her strength behind her personality; Matt (Zach Roerig), Elena's ex-flame who fires the screen with his brooding presence; and many more distinct and sometimes mysterious inhabitants of the strange town of Mystic Falls. The setting itself is so realistic and so integral to the story that it almost becomes a character in and of itself, speaking to the quality of the writing.The series deals with teenage issues in an adult manner, never condescending to its audience by opening up to viewers of all ages. The vampires of the show have moments of real horror, reminding viewers that any creature that has to drink the blood of the living in order to survive is not to be trusted; there is enough fierce action and slight gore to keep viewers engaged while the romantic elements of the plot simmer with tension so tight that the explosions of passion are nearly as violent as the fight scenes themselves.""The Vampire Diaries"" is a fun, fresh, and sharply-written supernatural drama that is sure to attract a strong fanbase. It certainly doesn't hurt that all of the actors are both attractive and talented and that the history of the town is as engaging as its present. Ultimately, ""TVD"" is a strong, bloodthirsty and fast-paced ride, and it just may be enough to prove to the world that the vampire genre still has plenty of bite left in it yet.5 out of 5 stars.NOTE: ""The Vampire Diaries"" is based on the series of novels of the same name by teenage author of the '90's, LJ Smith; however, the show deviates strongly from the novels in many positive ways -- no longer is Elena a shallow blonde beauty queen; no longer is Stefan an overbearing, brooding bore, no longer is Damon a callow and irritating bad guy. While fans of the book series may take issue with the differences between the novels and the series, non-fans and those who have never read the novels are certainly not missing much by watching the show rather than reading the books.",5,A Rare Treat to Sink Your Teeth Into,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,5186,"['Vampire', 'Diaries', 'latest', 'addition', 'delightfully', 'growing', 'genre',

There's only so much teenage-angst and emo-drama I can stomach, so I had no plans to see it. And then, I got sick, and my sister grabbed the first season from the library with the intention of making me watch it. So, with protests and misgivings aplenty, I started watching.The first two discs or so confirmed what I believed the series would be...and then, something amazing happened. They dropped the emo-drama, and focused on actual story. And, instead of watching it because I had nothing better to do, I found that I really liked the series.To be fair, the first episodes necessarily had to be slower...we were ""meeting"" the characters and learning about their lives. That wasn't the problem. It was the predictable-and-oh-so-annoying back and forth of the main character, Elana, deciding she and her vampire boyfriend, Steffan, can't be together because he's a monster, then changing her mind only to find that he's decided they can't be together because he's a monster, before he changes his mind...etc., that was truly aggravating. Yes, I know it happens in the vampire stories, from True Blood to Twilight...but, for once, I'd like to see one where it didn't! That, and all the silly drama that went with it, was what I found really annoying about the first two or so discs. After that, though, the story really seemed to find its way, and became very enjoyable.The characters, especially after the first two discs, are really pretty likable - or, at least, understandable; the story is very interesting, and progresses (after the first two discs) at a good pace. The townspeople and history the series creates are very well done, and believable. You feel like you ""know"" Mystic Falls and its inhabitants after awhile.All in all, I give this 5/5 stars...because it redeemed itself from the emo-self-pity-party pattern that it had fallen into in such a superb way.

Elena dives into her own family history.Taking a risk on being wildly unpopular, I don't really like Elena and Stefan. Stefan is so very boring. He is pretty whiny too. Elena is okay, however, nothing about her stands out for me. She seems pretty normal. Stunning, but normal. Damon though, is pretty awesome.

Damon's quest to free his love Katherine, who was locked inside the Mystic Falls church in 1864, comes to an explosive head as Stefan rescues Elena from her vampire kidnappers. Matt and Caroline are still trying to make their fledgling romance work, while Jeremy has fallen for the strange new girl, Anna, who is much more than she appears to be. Even Tyler makes a (not-too-notable) appearance (his first post-hiatus, I think).All of the elements from the last several episodes come together in a satisfying conclusion, including the identity and purpose of the new vampires in town and Damon's quest to obtain Emily Bennett's grimoire in order to break the seal on the tomb. Elena, Stefan and Bonnie have promised to release Katherine, but not the other vampires. Unlike the previous episode, there are no flashbacks in ""Fool Me Once."" Elena must appeal to Damon's attraction to her after she's broken his trust in the last episode; his acquiescence is vital to their scheme. Bonnie's grandmother (Jasmine Guy) also plays a pivotal role in opening the long-sealed tomb.The pacing, plot and performances show just how far this show has come since the pilot. There's a new maturity and depth of emotion to the storyline; several characters lose someone they loved. Ian Somerhalder shines in this episode; Damon is taken from hope to anger to the deepest grief, and we feel along with him every step of the way.

1272767,A2BLRRNYU9XO9R,B002JVWR9U,S. Coleman,"[9, 10]","After picking up the Twilight series from my local library back in 2007, I became instantly hooked on the idea of vampires. I began reading everything I could find on the subject, from adult and teen fiction to historical accounts of vampire myths in the real world. However, I found myself feeling a little bit disatisfied. All of the books that I was reading were pretty much the same. A beautiful girl falls in love with a beautiful vampire...blah blah blah. I was looking for something with a darker side . When HBO's True Blood came on the air in the fall of 2008, I was very excited ""Yay! A vampire show about REAL, bloodsucking vampires!"" Though I still watch the show to this day, I have to admit that I am slightly off put by its graphic sexual nature. The plot of the show is simply genius, but so many scenes of violence and sex are really not necessary to the development of the story. I discovered that I needed a healthy, balanced vampire story--something dark and delicious but not gratuitously graphic and violent.When I first heard that the CW was going to air a show about vampires, I was instantly skeptical. ""Great. One Tree Hill, but with vampires,"" I thought to myself. Fortunately, I gave the Vampire Diaries a chance, and now I find it impossible to stay away. Though the first few episodes played out like your general tacky teen soap opera, by the Halloween episode at the end of October, I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I was very delighted to find that the characters of the show are so well developed--not your typical teen drama bores. Each and every character, no matter how small their role, has some sort of a backstory and contributes to the development of the plot. The main character Elena Gilbert is a true heroine, not your generic Mary Sue of vampire fiction (sorry Bella). Instead of waiting around to be saved by some gorgeous man, Elena is often the one to do the saving. She has some guilt in her past, but instead of moping around about it, she makes the decision to move forward. Stefan Salvatore is Elena's boyfriend, a vampire with a heart of gold who sometimes finds himself incapable of resisting his nature. Damon Salvatore is Stefan's delectably devious older brother, a vampire who has no problem raising the body count of the town if it means getting what he wants. His non-beating heart begins to soften at the end of the season, and after Elena bonds with him over his troubled existance, he slowly begins to stake his claim on her. This leaves young Elena miserably torn between two vampire brothers whom she loves very much. In addition to the main cast, the supporting characters are equally interesting. Elena's best friend Bonnie just happens to be a witch. Her brother Jeremy struggles with drug abuse, the loss of a very dear friend, and considers immortality as the only way out of his misery. Caroline Forbes is the wonderfully shallow queen bee, Matt is  Elena's ever-loyal sidekick of sorts, and Alaric Saltzman is the history teacher with a major beef against vampires. Every character is well-rounded and wholly believable, and the superb acting makes this series a joy to watch.As most people know, the Vampire Diaries was first a series of novels by LJ Smith in the early 90s, with new stories having been released since the beginning of the CW show. While I definitely recommend the Vampire Diaries TV show to fans of the book series, just keep in mind that they are VASTLY different from one another. It is almost as if someone wrote a piece of fanfiction for LJ Smith's novels and turned it into a full-length TV show. In the novels Elena does not have a brother, Fells Church is the name of the city (not Mystic Falls), Bonnie is a ditzy redhead who still possesses powers but is not the descendent of Salem Witches, Elena has a second best friend named Meredith with whom she is actually closer than Bonnie, and Stefan and Damon were turned into vampires during the Italian Renaissance in the 1500s--not during the Civil War in 1864 (this is an extremely important factor to the story). In fact, with the exception of the characters' names and a few major plot points, the book and screen versions are nothing alike. But if you can overlook these details, you will find yourself widely entertained by a phenomenal show.The first season of the Vampire Diaries is for anyone who likes their vamps to be bad, but not outright offensive and sexually perverse. You will laugh at some moments and feel compelled to cry at others, while also being on your guard for the next big scare. But most of all, you will be captivated and utterly addicted to the story of a girl and her love for two vampires.",5,Extremely Captivating and Addicting!,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,4679,"['picking', 'up', 'Twilight', 'series', 'local', 'library', 'back', '2007', 'became', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'idea', 'vampires', 'began', 'reading', 'everything', 'could', 'find', 'subject', 'adult', 'teen', 'fiction', 'historical', 'accounts', 'vampire', 'myths', 'real', 'world', 'However', 'found', 'feeling', 'little', 'bit', 'disatisfied', 'books', 'was', 'reading', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'love', 'beautiful', 'vampire', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'darker', 'side', 'When', 'HBO', 'True', 'Blood', 'came', 'air', 'fall', '2008', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'Yay', 'vampire', 'show', 'REAL', 'bloodsucking', 'vampires', 'still', 'watch', 'show', 'day', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'slightly', 'put', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'nature', 'plot', 'show', 'simply', 'genius', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'violence', 'sex', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'necessary', 'development', 'story', 'discovered', 'needed', 'healthy', 'balanced', 'vampire', 'story', 'something', 'dark', 'delicious', 'not', 'gratuitously', 'graphic', 'violent.When', 'first', 'heard', 'CW', 'was', 'going', 'air', 'show', 'vampires', 'was', 'instantly', 'skeptical', 'Great', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'vampires', 'thought', 'myself', 'Fortunately', 'gave', 'Vampire', 'chance', 'now', 'find', 'impossible', 'stay', 'away', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'played', 'out', 'general', 'tacky', 'teen', 'soap', 'opera', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'end', 'October', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'was', 'very', 'delighted', 'find', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'developed', 'not', 'typical', 'teen', 'drama', 'bores', 'character', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'role', 'sort', 'backstory', 'contributes', 'development', 'plot', 'main', 'character', 'Elena', 'Gilbert', 'true', 'heroine', 'not', 'generic', 'Mary', 'Sue', 'vampire', 'fiction', 'sorry', 'Bella', 'Instead', 'waiting', 'be', 'saved', 'gorgeous', 'man', 'Elena', 'often', 'one', 'do', 'saving', 'guilt', 'past', 'instead', 'moping', 'decision', 'move', 'forward', 'Stefan', 'Salvatore', 'Elena', 'boyfriend', 'vampire', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'incapable', 'resisting', 'nature', 'Damon', 'Salvatore', 'Stefan', 'delectably', 'devious', 'older', 'brother', 'vampire', 'who', 'problem', 'raising', 'body', 'count', 'town', 'getting', 'what', 'non-beating', 'heart', 'soften', 'end', 'season', 'Elena', 'bonds', 'troubled', 'existance', 'slowly', 'stake', 'claim', 'young', 'Elena', 'miserably', 'torn', 'two', 'vampire', 'brothers', 'whom', 'very', 'much', 'addition', 'main', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'interesting', 'Elena', 'best', 'friend', 'Bonnie', 'just', 'be', 'witch', 'brother', 'Jeremy', 'drug', 'abuse', 'loss', 'very', 'dear', 'friend', 'considers', 'immortality', 'only', 'way', 'misery', 'Caroline', 'Forbes', 'wonderfully', 'shallow', 'queen', 'bee', 'Matt', 'Elena', 'ever-loyal', 'sidekick', 'sorts', 'Alaric', 'Saltzman', 'history', 'teacher', 'major', 'beef', 'vampires', 'character', 'well-rounded', 'wholly', 'believable', 'superb', 'acting', 'series', 'joy', 'watch.As', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'novels', 'LJ', 'Smith', 'early', '90s', 'new', 'stories', 'having', 'been', 'released', 'beginning', 'CW', 'show', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'TV', 'show', 'fans', 'book', 'series', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'VASTLY', 'different', 'one', 'almost', 'someone', 'wrote', 'piece', 'fanfiction', 'LJ', 'Smith', 'novels', 'turned', 'full-length', 'TV', 'show', 'novels', 'Elena', 'not', 'have', 'brother', 'Fells', 'Church', 'name', 'city', 'not', 'Mystic', 'Falls', 'Bonnie', 'ditzy', 'redhead', 'who', 'still', 'powers', 'not', 'descendent', 'Salem', 'Witches', 'Elena', 'second', 'best', 'friend', 'named', 'Meredith', 'whom', 'actually', 'closer', 'Bonnie', 'Stefan', 'Damon', 'were', 'turned', 'vampires', 'Italian', 'Renaissance', '1500s', 'not', 'Civil', 'War', '1864', 'extremely', 'important', 'factor', 'story', 'fact', 'exception', 'characters', 'names', 'few', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'book', 'screen', 'versions', 'are', 'nothing', 'alike', 'can', 'overlook', 'details', 'will', 'find', 'widely', 'entertained', 'phenomenal', 'show.The', 'first', 'season', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'anyone', 'who', 'vamps', 'be', 'bad', 'not', 'outright', 'offensive', 'sexually', 'perverse', 'will', 'laugh', 'moments', 'feel', 'compelled', 'cry', 'others', 'also', 'being', 'guard', 'next', 'big', 'scare', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'captivated', 'utterly', 'addicted', 'story', 'girl', 'love', 'two', 'vampires']",N/A

But as of last year I'm checking out EVERYTHING vampire- and werewolf-related. The problem is that some books and movies just don't have the same fascinating characters as others. I'm a diehard Team Jacob fan, but I can't even decide between Damon and Stefan. Damon is the most lovable jerk I've ever seen on television, and I love that wide-eyed thing the very gorgeous Ian Somerhalder does with Damon's character. Paul Wesley's Stefan character is easy to like and more than pleasing on the eyes. Both are incredibly different, but like Twilight, there are things I do and don't like about both of their characters. The great thing about this television show is I actually like ALL of the female leads. Twilight's Bella irritates me to no end, but I'd hang out with all of the girls on ""Vampire Diaries.""Elena is a little more street smart than the average female lead (with a vampire boyfriend) so I like her. Plus, she has no problems standing up to Damon even though he could snap her neck at any moment. Bonnie is fun to watch, and I enjoyed watching her transition to a witch. I'm a diehard ""A Different World"" fan so anything Jasmine Guy is involved in is going to make me pay attention although I was none too thrilled about a certain episode when a certain something happened. (No spoilers.)I like Caroline although she's a little over-the-top, somewhat because I'm a fan of werewolves and I like her present relationship Tyler. (Note: If not for the current season, I would NOT like Tyler at all. He was more evil to Jeremy than Damon is to everybody.) However, on THIS season, I learned her background with Elena's ex-boyfriend. Because I watched the seasons out of order, I didn't know Caroline's backstory, but the first season made her more personable even though she's incredibly emotional.The first season is an introduction to the boys coming back to Mystic Falls, learning about Caroline's and Tyler's relationships with supernatural beings, the connection between Elena and her doppelganger, and Bonnie's confirmation that her ""psychic"" powers are a little bit more. I watched this season and immediately wondered, ""Why wasn't I watching this show from the beginning?""My favorite episodes are: 1) When Lexi comes into town; 2) When Damon and Elena go on a road trip to Atlanta; 3) The first episode when Stefan strolls into town and all the girls like him.",5,Loved every minute of it,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,2570,"['not', 'being', 'bored', 'enough', 'go', 'see', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Eclipse', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'day', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'pay', 'watch', 'anything', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'last', 'year', ""'m"", 'checking', 'out', 'EVERYTHING', 'vampire-', 'werewolf-related', 'problem', 'books', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'others', ""'m"", 'diehard', 'Team', 'Jacob', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'decide', 'Damon', 'Stefan', 'Damon', 'most', 'lovable', 'jerk', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'love', 'wide-eyed', 'thing', 'very', 'gorgeous', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'Damon', 'character', 'Paul', 'Wesley', 'Stefan', 'character', 'easy', 'like', 'more', 'pleasing', 'eyes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'different', 'Twilight', 'are', 'things', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'characters', 'great', 'thing', 'television', 'show', 'actually', 'ALL', 'female', 'leads', 'Twilight', 'Bella', 'end', ""'d"", 'hang', 'out', 'girls', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'Elena', 'little', 'more', 'street', 'smart', 'average', 'female', 'lead', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', 'so', 'problems', 'standing', 'up', 'Damon', 'even', 'could', 'snap', 'neck', 'moment', 'Bonnie', 'fun', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'transition', 'witch', ""'m"", 'diehard', 'Different', 'World', 'fan', 'anything', 'Jasmine', 'Guy', 'involved', 'going', 'make', 'pay', 'attention', 'was', 'none', 'too', 'thrilled', 'certain', 'episode', 'when', 'certain', 'something', 'happened', 'spoilers', 'like', 'Caroline', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'somewhat', ""'m"", 'fan', 'werewolves', 'like', 'present', 'relationship', 'Tyler', 'Note', 'not', 'current', 'season', 'would', 'NOT', 'Tyler', 'was', 'more', 'evil', 'Jeremy', 'Damon', 'everybody', 'However', 'THIS', 'season', 'learned', 'background', 'Elena', 'ex-boyfriend', 'watched', 'seasons', 'order', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Caroline', 'backstory', 'first', 'season', 'made', 'more', 'personable', 'even', 'incredibly', 'emotional.The', 'first', 'season', 'introduction', 'boys', 'coming', 'back', 'Mystic', 'Falls', 'learning', 'Caroline', 'Tyler', 'relationships', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'connection', 'Elena', 'doppelganger', 'Bonnie', 'confirmation', 'psychic', 'powers', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'watched', 'season', 'immediately', 'wondered', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'watching', 'show', 'beginning', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', '1', 'When', 'Lexi', 'town', '2', 'When', 'Damon', 'Elena', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'Atlanta', '3', 'first', 'episode', 'when', 'Stefan', 'town', 'girls']",N/A

When that show came to an end, a little piece of me died along with it. Since I'm all grown up now (I'm thirty years old), I figured I've outgrown teen series.  And honestly, I didn't think there'd be any vampire show as good as Buffy. I was wrong. The Vampire Diaries is as good and engrossing as Buffy. I'm still chastising myself over why I haven't watched this show when it first aired. On the flip side, I now can watch them all back to back without having to wait on pins and needles for the next episode.Even though The Vampire Diaries is targeted for young adults, it appeals to women over the age of 30. Unlike the O.C and other teen shows, the characters in this show are mature. It isn't anything like Twilight, where the protagonist (Bella) is a pathetic weakling.  Elena (played by the beautiful Nina Dobrev) is strong, vulnerable, and likable. Unlike Bella, her self-worth isn't tied to her beau. She has a good head on her shoulders. Her best friend, Bonnie, is equally endearing.In the pilot, Stefan, a 163 year-old vampire becomes romantically interested in Elena, a seventeen-year-old mortal.  Likewise, Elena becomes interested in Stefan. *minor spoilers ahead* Truth be told, I wanted to see what the writers will come up with once Elena found out that Stefan is a vampire.*end of spoilers*  Initially, I thought that the storyline was plain obvious and linear. Again, I was wrong. The Vampire Diaries is multi-layered and has a lot of twists and turns. As the layers unfold, you're thrust deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding Mystic Falls.Damon is a character you'd love to hate (played by the gorgeous Ian Smolderhalder whom I've grown to love his baby-blues on Lost). He is malevolent and selfish, yet has a tender side. I loved the history of Stefan and Damon and their love triangle with the enigmatic Katherine. I loved the backdrop of Mystic Falls and its rich history. The Vampire Diaries is fast-paced, intriguing, and addictive!With all the hoopla and vampire craze created by Twilight, you might probably dismiss The Vampire Diaries as another Twilight spin-off.

With the general exception of the first three or so episodes, every episodes is interesting, enthralling, & exciting. The acting is superb, the first of many things that set it apart from Twilight. Another is that the characters have more, well, character. The villains in this series are particularly amazing. The feel of the show is a bit dark most of the time. Sometimes very dark. Expect a lot of death. Especially in the first season, someone dies pretty much every episode. There are several surprises throughout the season, some of them are particularly shocking. The chemistry between the leads is spot-on, both the romantic relationships, and the other, subtler relationship of brothers.Newcomers should keep in mind that this is intended as a teen show, though its quite popular among other demographics.

Now that it's been out for three seasons now, I decided to give it a chance and bought the first season on a whim. Although I still maintain that it's rather Twilight-y with its love triangle and its brooding and its near-perfect female lead with brunette hair... this is WAAAAAY better, on all accounts - including the books. I didn't care for the first couple of books... the show, in MY humble opinion, is superior. And perhaps it's because I'm female and I enjoy this show purely for the gorgeous men/boys... I like to think of it as ""True Blood"" if you took out all of the crazy sex and at least 3/4's of the blood - not necessarily for kids, but for those who don't have any desire to expose themselves to the unnecessarily graphic and gratuitously explicit sex and violence, which, at least in my mind, is a plus (and yes, I've watched True Blood... watched all the way up to season 4 and then stopped... and I've read all the books. I've done my homework, this is all opinion based).Long story, short, this series, at best, is a guilty pleasure for me. Does it have its flaws? Of course.

I, generally, try to stay away from those kind of ""kid"" versions (I'm more the Tru Blood type). Anyway, I decided to give V Diaries a shot and I'm so glad I did.Vampire Diaries is a guilty pleasure. Despite the fact that the series is set-up with the high school crowd, it definitely has a more adult feel to it with the complex issues that come up and the dark, edgy violence. The first couple of eps played a bit too 90210(ish) but then the series really took off.The main characters are well rounded and believable even in unbelievable situations. The series has managed to weave a set of relationships that breath life into each of the characters. Elena is the high school girl who must not only face personal tragedy but a new boyfriend (Stephan) that may or may not be what he seems. And Stephan has his own family issues with his bad boy brother, Damon. And while Damon is definitely bad (body count anyone?)he has reasons he believes are valid for the pain he inflicts.(mostly)Elena as played by Nina Dobrev is a smart girl with a compassionate heart who definitely doesn't put up with any BS. In this vampire tale she doesn't just automatically tell Stephan it's all right when she finds out his secret. It's not cool that he's a vampire. People die around him and that's not ok. They fall in love despite his being a vampire rather than because of it.Stephan Salvatore, Mystic Falls resident brooding vampire, started out (to me) a little too much like an Angel wannabe but Paul Wesley has done a competent job in opening the character up. What he does to Damon in the basement was truly chilling. I was like, HEY!, aren't you supposed to be the good guy!And last but not least of the lead characters, Damon. What can I say. Damon is just delightfully bad. Ian Somerhalder plays him with relish. In the wrong hands, his character could have easily become a cliche but the actor has turned him into someone you just can't help but feel for (equal parts sympathy and revulsion)as he struts his way around, doling out cruelty with a smile, all the while hiding a secret of his own.The supporting cast is also just wonderful in their roles. Kudos especially to Candice Accola for her portrayal of Caroline Forbes. The whole cast was well chosen and that they're all beautiful and sexy doesn't hurt either.Anyway, before this review becomes a novel... just watch a few eps.
