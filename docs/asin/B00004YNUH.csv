""toonstuff""","[40, 41]","Barring some scriptural inaccuracies (a disclaimer admits to the dramatic license taken), Joseph is a wonderful, inspiring version of the Biblical tale.  The songs are decent for a video production, and some of them actually stand out quite well.The majority of the story talks about Joseph's journey of faith and hope, and how he overcame hurdle after hurdle to properly share the gifts that God had given him.A little light on the religious side, Joseph plays up the entertainment value of the story (as with most films).  However, it never deviates from the fact that Joseph believes his ability to interpret dreams is a gift from God. Far too few films  are willing to take this chance...

559460,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B00004YNUH,"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony""","[26, 26]","This worthy companion piece to Dreamworks' &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot; retells the Biblical story of Joseph, his betrayal by his brothers, sale into slavery, imprisonment, then rise to prominence through God's gift of prophecy through dreams. The story is well-voiced by stars including Judith Light, Mark Hamill, and Ben Affleck as Joseph, despite some weak, Disneyfied songs (voiced by the normally reliable Maureen McGovern and Jodi &quot;Ariel&quot; Benson).&quot;Joseph&quot;'s dream and flashback sequences are well-animated, with images of sunflowers, flowing wheatfields and flying eagles referencing Joseph's growth(in status and wisdom)in Egypt. This is notable where Joseph visions his brothers mocking him while cleaning a palace floor, then flashbacks to his youth while caring for a tree in his prison cell.Like all great Biblical stories, &quot;Joseph&quot; works as love lesson (in forgiveness and personal growth here) and dramatic narrative, and is economically told on both accounts. The film accurately captures Joseph's contentious relationship with his old and new families; the story's dramatic parallels (his false imprisonment by and reproachment with Portiphar, then the suspenseful-turned-joyous reunion with his brothers where Joseph reveals his identity) are powerful. While some dramatic license was taken with the storyline, &quot;Joseph&quot; thankfully eschews Disney-esque asides, superflous fantasy characters or expanded romantic angles (Joseph's love and marriage to Asenath is simply part of the story).&quot;Joseph&quot; was and remains among the Old Testament's most engrossing stories, particularly to families susceptible to sibling rivalry. Despite occassional melodramatic lapses, &quot;Joseph&quot; retains that core story and is an exceptional family film with much to teach its viewers.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[29, 31]","I usually don't buy direct-to-video sequels -- usually, they are inferior to the original product and only tarnish my enjoyment. However, &quot;King of Dreams&quot; is not a sequel, rather than a companion piece.Delving once again into ancient history, this story tells of a &quot;miracle child,&quot; the favorite son of old Jacob and his wife Rachel (the Biblical polygamy is delicately ignored, though hinted at in that Joseph is a half-brother). While Joseph's ten brothers toil in the fields, he is taught to read and write and is given a magnificently woven coat. When he has dreams that &quot;mean something,&quot; his brothers' resentment starts to grow. He ends up enslaved in Egypt, where despite his talents and intelligence he falls further and further. But newfound humility and a special gift from God will bring him back up.This movie has a beautiful piece of symbolism - the little fruit tree that Joseph carelessly steps on as he cries out to God, &quot;Why?&quot; Everyone in their lives is faced with a crisis in which it is asked why God is doing this to them. The single leaf that remains living on the shattered tree shows how his faith still exists, and that faith grows as he saves the tree and nurtures it to health. God is spoken of less, as Joseph is not convincing anyone of anything, but his presence is highly felt in the writing.From a secular point of view, this is also a good cautionary tale. At the beginning, Joseph bounds past his brothers, singing, &quot;I am special, I am smart! I am a miracle child!&quot; and being coddled by his parents. Allowing himself to be arrogant is part of his downfall. Later on, he uses his gift and his intelligence to benefit everyone, and thus is rewarded.The secondary characters are, like Ramses of PoE, multi-dimensional even if you are supposed to dislike them. As Joseph enjoys his special status, one can sympathize with his jealous brothers -- but the same spoiled boy will take your sympathy when his brothers taunt him and cruelly sell him. Potiphar is well-drawn -- a man who betrays his own honor and clearly suffers inwardly because of it, and his niece is an instantly sympathetic character is her urgings to forgive.Though this film is acceptable for small kids, there are a few moments that will disturb them, such as when Potiphar's wife makes a (it's not obvious to the very young) pass at Joseph, and when he is dragged off while his brothers accept silver as payment for him.The songs aren't quite as good as PoE, but the animation in its lesser glory is excellent. When Joseph is led into Egypt, one can definitely sympathize with his slack-jawed awe. Lesser details, such as Potiphar's servant's thoughts on Joseph's hygiene, are also present and very enjoyable. The dream sequences strike a good balance of otherworldliness and realism.Okay, so this isn't quite up to the standards of &quot;Prince of Egypt.&quot; There's a lesser budget, but it's a more personal, family story.",5,A delight,978307200,"01 1, 2001",2001,2972,"['usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'direct-to-video', 'sequels', 'usually', 'are', 'inferior', 'original', 'product', 'only', 'tarnish', 'enjoyment', 'However', 'quot', 'King', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'not', 'sequel', 'rather', 'companion', 'piece.Delving', 'once', 'again', 'ancient', 'history', 'story', 'quot', 'child', 'quot', 'favorite', 'son', 'old', 'Jacob', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'Biblical', 'polygamy', 'delicately', 'ignored', 'though', 'hinted', 'Joseph', 'half-brother', 'Joseph', 'ten', 'brothers', 'toil', 'fields', 'taught', 'read', 'write', 'given', 'magnificently', 'woven', 'coat', 'When', 'dreams', 'quot', 'mean', 'something', 'quot', 'brothers', 'resentment', 'grow', 'up', 'enslaved', 'Egypt', 'where', 'talents', 'intelligence', 'further', 'further', 'newfound', 'humility', 'special', 'gift', 'God', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'up.This', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'symbolism', 'little', 'fruit', 'tree', 'Joseph', 'carelessly', 'out', 'God', 'quot', 'Why', 'quot', 'Everyone', 'lives', 'faced', 'crisis', 'asked', 'why', 'God', 'doing', 'single', 'leaf', 'living', 'shattered', 'tree', 'how', 'faith', 'still', 'faith', 'grows', 'tree', 'health', 'God', 'spoken', 'less', 'Joseph', 'not', 'convincing', 'anyone', 'anything', 'presence', 'highly', 'felt', 'writing.From', 'secular', 'point', 'view', 'also', 'good', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'beginning', 'Joseph', 'brothers', 'singing', 'quot', 'am', 'special', 'am', 'smart', 'am', 'miracle', 'child', 'quot', 'being', 'coddled', 'parents', 'Allowing', 'be', 'arrogant', 'part', 'downfall', 'Later', 'gift', 'intelligence', 'benefit', 'everyone', 'thus', 'rewarded.The', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'Ramses', 'PoE', 'multi-dimensional', 'even', 'are', 'supposed', 'dislike', 'Joseph', 'special', 'status', 'one', 'can', 'sympathize', 'jealous', 'brothers', 'same', 'spoiled', 'boy', 'will', 'take', 'sympathy', 'when', 'brothers', 'taunt', 'cruelly', 'sell', 'Potiphar', 'well-drawn', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'honor', 'clearly', 'suffers', 'inwardly', 'niece', 'instantly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'urgings', 'forgive.Though', 'film', 'acceptable', 'small', 'kids', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'will', 'disturb', 'such', 'when', 'Potiphar', 'wife', 'not', 'obvious', 'very', 'young', 'pass', 'Joseph', 'when', 'dragged', 'off', 'brothers', 'accept', 'silver', 'payment', 'him.The', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'PoE', 'animation', 'lesser', 'glory', 'excellent', 'When', 'Joseph', 'led', 'Egypt', 'one', 'can', 'definitely', 'sympathize', 'slack-jawed', 'awe', 'Lesser', 'details', 'such', 'Potiphar', 'servant', 'thoughts', 'Joseph', 'hygiene', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'dream', 'strike', 'good', 'balance', 'otherworldliness', 'realism.Okay', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'standards', 'quot', 'Prince', 'Egypt.', 'quot', 'lesser', 'budget', 'more', 'personal', 'family', 'story']",N/A

It really is a timeless adventure for all ages .It is different to Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat  , but just as good . The former being a light-hearted musical , and 'King of Dreams' being an educational and enchanting story.Furthermore the criticism that God was left out of the story is simply untrue.It is clear throughout the story that events are being moved by the hand of God.When Pharaoh queries Joseph's power , Joseph makes it clear to Pharaoh that it is not his power at all but comes from God.I loved the imagery , for example the use of birds signifying freedom and going far  during """"More Than You Take"" .The film is a rollercoaster of emotions , a particularly poignant scene being when Joseph explains to his beautiful young wife Asinath , that the men who he is treating so badly are his brothers (earlier represented as a particularly nasty and sordid bunch) , who cruelly sold him into slavery .Also pay attention to the small details. In the last scene when Jacob is welcomed by Joseph to Egypt , he is thrilled to see Joseph's two little sons .Those who know there Bible know that they are , Ephraim and Manasseh who will become great leaders in their own right.Joseph - King of Dreams is one of the greats of animated movies!",5,Enchanting and Educational,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,1419,"['enchanting', 'animated', 'epic', 'must', 'educational', 'experience', 'Christian', 'Jewish', 'child.It', 'also', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'adults', 'really', 'timeless', 'adventure', 'ages', '.It', 'different', 'Joseph', 'Amazing', 'Technicolour', 'Dreamcoat', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'former', 'being', 'light-hearted', 'musical', ""'King"", 'Dreams', 'being', 'educational', 'enchanting', 'story.Furthermore', 'criticism', 'God', 'was', 'left', 'story', 'simply', 'untrue.It', 'clear', 'story', 'events', 'are', 'being', 'moved', 'hand', 'God.When', 'Pharaoh', 'Joseph', 'power', 'Joseph', 'clear', 'Pharaoh', 'not', 'power', 'God.I', 'loved', 'imagery', 'example', 'use', 'birds', 'signifying', 'freedom', 'going', 'far', 'More', 'Than', 'Take', '.The', 'film', 'rollercoaster', 'emotions', 'particularly', 'poignant', 'scene', 'being', 'when', 'Joseph', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'Asinath', 'men', 'who', 'treating', 'so', 'badly', 'are', 'brothers', 'earlier', 'represented', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'sordid', 'bunch', 'who', 'cruelly', 'sold', 'slavery', '.Also', 'pay', 'attention', 'small', 'details', 'last', 'scene', 'when', 'Jacob', 'welcomed', 'Joseph', 'Egypt', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Joseph', 'two', 'little', 'sons', '.Those', 'who', 'know', 'there', 'Bible', 'know', 'are', 'Ephraim', 'Manasseh', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'great', 'leaders', 'own', 'right.Joseph', 'King', 'Dreams', 'one', 'greats', 'animated', 'movies']",N/A

It's a totally different story, and follows Joseph, the son of Jacob, as he's given preferential treatment by his father, who is so proud that he is the first born to his wife, Rachel.  Then there are the dreams which he receives, with his brothers bowing in obeisance to him, and then the action sets in, and he's sold into slavery into Egypt.This is a fine re-telling of this Biblical story, and as has been noted previously, the animation and the songs are rich and fulfilling.  Joseph rises to power in Egypt, after being falsely accused by Potiphar's wife, and while in prison, he continues to remain faithful to God.The resolution of this, naturally, is when the famine hits Canaan, Jacob sends all his sons to Egypt, except is youngest son, and by this time Joseph has risen to be the #2 man in Egypt.

Though it can't hold a candle to ""Prince of Egypt"", it is a fair attempt and a pleasant movie to watch. My children sat thru it and enjoyed it. That's the sign of a good movie for a young person.The animation doesn't seem to be top notch (or at least as well as Dream Works demonstrated in Prince of Egypt), but it was easy to get used to. But I really like the scene when Joseph first enters Egypt, the city seemed very...majestic. I was totally glued to it and the way they portrayed the characters was really interesting too. The songs were not particularly memorable (i.e.: I couldn't tell you more than a line of lyrics used), but I can't really complain because the music was very nice and the singing was good. Not enough to blow me away, but a pleasant background to the story.But what I defiantly liked best are the characters themselves. I can just imagine how hard it must be for the actors to put life and feeling into an animated character, and all of the actors who lent their voices were positively great.Overall, a nice way to get kids to enjoy the story.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[7, 9]","Although it lacks the starpower and budget of its predecessor, ""Prince of Egypt,"" ""Joseph:  King of Dreams"" is a very ambitious film for the direct-to-DVD market.  It features the voice talents of Ben Affleck(Daredevil, Gigli), Mark Hamill(the Star Wars trilogy, Batman:  The Animated Series), James Eckhouse(Beverly Hills, 90210), Steven Weber(Wings), and Jodi Benson(Ariel of ""The Little Mermaid"").  It also features the voices of Dan Castellaneta, Maureen McGovern, Rene Auberjonois, Judith Light, and other established actors.It tells the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors and how his father, Jacob, puts him on a pedestal above his other brothers.  When Joseph's bragging goes a little too far, his brothers sell him into slavery.  Little do they know that he will eventually become second only to Pharoah in power and literally hold their futures in his hands.  The story sticks relatively close to that of the Bible.  It handles the dreams that Joseph has and interprets in a very good manner.  They standout from the rest of the film without actually separating themselves from the overall story.The music is sort of average, and not on the level of ""Prince,"" but it does move the story along at a decent clip.  The animation is also a step down from ""Prince,"" but the budget was also considerably smaller, so I'll let that pass.Some have claimed that God is only mentioned once in this film.  However, if you follow the story and the actions of Joseph (especially when he is imprisoned), you'll see that God is everywhere in this film.  It is all left to interpretation, and if you don't look for God, you'll obviously not see him in this movie.I highly recommend this story as a companion piece to ""Prince of Egypt.""  Although some may see it as a sequel, it's actually just another film based on a story from the Bible.  After viewing this flick, try reading the actual story to your children and see if they can pick out the differences and similarities between the real story and Dreamworks' version.Please note that there is a little bit of violence in this film, but nothing along the lines of of ""Prince of Egypt.""  There is also a tad bit of sensuality when Potiphar's wife attempts to seduce Joseph, but this is handled quite nicely in the film and little ones will most likely not catch on to it.A really good film with solid production and voice talent.

The sweeping tale takes us from Canaan to Egypt at the surge of its growth as an empire that ruled the world.  Yet it's the personal, intimate aspects that bring about the story's power and universality.Ben Afflect creates an effective voice characterization that actually reflects the life-challenging experiences of Joseph.  The ensemble cast featurs the voice talents of mark Hamill, Judith Light, Maureen McGovern and Dan Castellaneta among others.Nizo Yamamoto, who was art director on the stunning &quot;PRINCESS MONONOKE&quot; served as background supervisor.  He created a special technique to generate the gentle softness of some of the dusky desert vistas.  &quot;I use an airbrush and spray water over the painting and then use a huge brush to soften the whole thing,&quot; he says.  Over 500 artists from an international talent pool worked on this unusual project that was tweaked with break-through computer animation.  In fact, not a single frame of film was exposed -- the entire movie was finished digitally.The score was composed and orchestrated by Dan Pelfrey.  John Bucchino wrote the songs.  In some ways, as in &quot;THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,&quot; the songs slow down the story telling and in fact take us out of the compelling story as adapted from the Bible by Eugenia and Raymond Singer.  The direction was shared by Rob  LaDuca and Rob Ramirez.The DVD includes bonus features for the entiure family and all age groups from Sing-Along Songs to Storyboard Commentary to an Interactive Trivia Game and more.(DreamWorks, 74 minutes, Not Rated)",4,TO BETRAY AND AVENGE,1009929600,"01 2, 2002",2002,2227,"['heartbreak', 'family', 'divided', 'power', 'family', 'united.According', 'DreamWorks', 'Jeffrey', 'Katzenberg', 'much', 'creative', 'team', 'was', 'involved', 'quot', 'PRINCE', 'OF', 'EGYPT', 'quot', 'was', 'gathered', 'work', 'quot', 'JOSEPH', 'KING', 'DREAMS.', 'quot', 'resulting', 'richly', 'colored', 'animation', 'often', 'bathed', 'desert', 'light', 'not', 'quite', 'eye-popping', 'caliber', 'former', 'certainly', 'satisfying.This', 'vivid', 'thoughtful', 'sometimes', 'insightful', 'retelling', 'timeless', 'oft-told', 'Biblical', 'tale', 'brother', 'betrayal', 'ironic', 'revenge.The', 'story', 'naive', '17', 'year-old', 'Hebrew', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'powerful', 'wise', '34', 'year', 'old', 'lord', 'Egypt', 'sweeping', 'tale', 'Canaan', 'Egypt', 'surge', 'growth', 'empire', 'ruled', 'world', 'personal', 'intimate', 'aspects', 'bring', 'story', 'power', 'universality.Ben', 'Afflect', 'effective', 'voice', 'characterization', 'actually', 'life-challenging', 'experiences', 'Joseph', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'featurs', 'voice', 'talents', 'mark', 'Hamill', 'Judith', 'Light', 'Maureen', 'McGovern', 'Dan', 'Castellaneta', 'others.Nizo', 'Yamamoto', 'who', 'was', 'art', 'director', 'stunning', 'quot', 'PRINCESS', 'MONONOKE', 'quot', 'served', 'background', 'supervisor', 'created', 'special', 'technique', 'generate', 'gentle', 'softness', 'dusky', 'desert', 'vistas', 'quot', 'use', 'airbrush', 'spray', 'water', 'painting', 'then', 'use', 'huge', 'brush', 'soften', 'whole', 'thing', 'quot', '500', 'artists', 'international', 'talent', 'pool', 'worked', 'unusual', 'project', 'was', 'tweaked', 'break-through', 'computer', 'animation', 'fact', 'not', 'single', 'frame', 'film', 'was', 'exposed', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'finished', 'digitally.The', 'score', 'was', 'composed', 'orchestrated', 'Dan', 'Pelfrey', 'John', 'Bucchino', 'wrote', 'songs', 'ways', 'quot', 'PRINCE', 'OF', 'EGYPT', 'quot', 'songs', 'slow', 'down', 'story', 'telling', 'fact', 'take', 'compelling', 'story', 'adapted', 'Bible', 'Eugenia', 'Raymond', 'Singer', 'direction', 'was', 'shared', 'Rob', 'LaDuca', 'Rob', 'Ramirez.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'entiure', 'family', 'age', 'groups', 'Sing-Along', 'Songs', 'Storyboard', 'Commentary', 'Interactive', 'Trivia', 'Game', 'more', 'DreamWorks', '74', 'minutes', 'Not', 'Rated']",N/A

POE is one of my favorite all time movies and Joseph is my favorite biblical character.  So you can imagine my delight when I heard that Dreamworks who had put out a masterpiece like POE was, developing the story of Joseph.  But when I sat down to watch the movie I was horrified.  It was a trite, sappy story and had none of the edge and solid characterizations of POE.The makers of this movie could have gone a long way to show the growing up and the development of Joseph and his relation to his brothers.  The same way they showed the development of Moses and his relationship to his brother Ramses.  Joseph was a spoilt, pampered and favorite Daddy's boy.  Who practically provoked his brothers into selling him into slavery through his arrogance towards them and constant tattle telling.  Insted in JKOD everything is one dimensional.  Joseph is simply a saint who did nothing wrong and had no character flaws. Whereas his brothers were just plain bad. It really would have been nice if we could have seen Joseph change from an arrogant youth to humble and responsible man.I've listened to the POE soundtrack over and over again.  But with JKOD I was forced to press the mute button on the remote because I found the songs so irritating.Two favorible things.  The handling of the sexual harassment issue by Potiphars wife was tastefully done.  I also liked the way that Asenath was slipped into the story.If you are looking for something on par with Prince of Egypt, believe me Joseph King of Dreams is not it.  It would be far better to watch Princess Mononoke.  I hope that one day someone will do a proper telling of this story",2,If you are expecting the same as POE--pass.,991440000,"06 2, 2001",2001,1726,"['was', 'really', 'honestly', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'ever', 'was', 'development', 'POE', 'one', 'favorite', 'time', 'movies', 'Joseph', 'favorite', 'biblical', 'character', 'can', 'imagine', 'delight', 'when', 'heard', 'Dreamworks', 'who', 'had', 'put', 'out', 'masterpiece', 'POE', 'was', 'developing', 'story', 'Joseph', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'horrified', 'was', 'trite', 'sappy', 'story', 'had', 'none', 'edge', 'solid', 'characterizations', 'POE.The', 'makers', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'show', 'growing', 'up', 'development', 'Joseph', 'relation', 'brothers', 'same', 'way', 'showed', 'development', 'Moses', 'relationship', 'brother', 'Ramses', 'Joseph', 'was', 'spoilt', 'pampered', 'favorite', 'Daddy', 'boy', 'Who', 'practically', 'provoked', 'brothers', 'selling', 'slavery', 'arrogance', 'towards', 'constant', 'tattle', 'telling', 'Insted', 'JKOD', 'everything', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Joseph', 'simply', 'saint', 'who', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'had', 'character', 'flaws', 'Whereas', 'brothers', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'Joseph', 'change', 'arrogant', 'youth', 'humble', 'responsible', 'man.I', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'POE', 'soundtrack', 'over', 'again', 'JKOD', 'was', 'forced', 'press', 'mute', 'button', 'remote', 'found', 'songs', 'so', 'irritating.Two', 'favorible', 'things', 'handling', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'issue', 'Potiphars', 'wife', 'was', 'tastefully', 'done', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'Asenath', 'was', 'slipped', 'story.If', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'par', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'believe', 'Joseph', 'King', 'Dreams', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'watch', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'someone', 'will', 'do', 'proper', 'telling', 'story']",N/A

559498,A2S24ARW626ZVU,B00004YNUH,Stella Rosenfeld,"[2, 2]","For a direct-to-video this wasn't half bad. I've always liked the Dreamworks style of animation that's sharp and more angular instead of the rounded, softer look from Disney characters. Dreamworks also avoids the fairy tale genre by choosing more provocative stories than can become very worthwhile if done properly. ""Joseph: King of Dreams"" is historically a prelude to ""Prince of Egypt"" but it successfully stands on its own. It has no need to capitalize on a blockbuster film with a ""sequel"".The animation, while not on par with the computer-animated sea split from PoE, is still exquisite in detail. We see Egypt through the eyes of the startled Joseph who goes from a bustling slave market to the splendor of Potiphar's house to the dankness of a prison cell. Dreamworks is credited to thorough research on ancient civilizations and their lifestyles, seen from the finery of Egyptain garments and Joseph's hand painted mural--a nod to Moses hieroglyphic dream from PoE.PoE is an epic tale about a nation's liberation while ""Joseph"" is a more personal story about one man's journey into the unknown world. It feels friendlier to families watching it at home and there's no freaky plagues to scare the kids either. My only complaint is the second half of the film that's inaccurate in text and feels too rushed. The brothers come to Egypt and Joseph gives them cold retribution until his good natured wife Asenath advises him otherwise. The sudden ""surprise"" discovery of new brother, Benjamin, is also incorrect. (Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin. He and Joseph grew up together until Joseph was sold into slavery.)Nevertheless, it's nice film that you can show the family without worrying about crass content. Like PoE, the star-studded voice cast is adequate. Ben Affleck delivers a low key ""realistic"" voice for Joseph.  Mark Hamill is a worthwhile Judah (although all the brothers are depicted rather malevolently.)  The music is not on par with the original ""When You Believe"" score but it turns out all right. The highlight of the film is ""Better than I"", where the frustrated Joseph finds peace with himself after suffering much adversity. Parents can gladly add this film to their video library and know that their children are watching a beautiful and inspirational tale.
