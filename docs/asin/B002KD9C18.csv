But I also liked other anime such as ""Devil May Cry"", ""Sands of Destruction"" and comic based ""Witchblade""... and never played the games or read the comic.  I don't mind if different formats are different, like movies/books/video games, I like nuances, it leaves the original work special; I also enjoy when an anime starts off with an episode that doesn't character build or develop plot, it just starts out with a HUGE bang; the later episodes explain the actions/reactions of the characters quite nicely.  I get a kick out of Miss Alucard and ""Anko"", the reporter.  The backgrounds, character design, and the fluidity of animation I was actually quite stunned by, I thought it wonderful.At least for the first Dark Arts story arc of 14 episodes, the first four episodes of Martial Fist story arc and the 26th thank-you episode titled ""Romeo & Juliet"" which felt like it should have come after the first half of the Martial Fist story arc.  Not sure WHAT the heck happened to the production quality and character design of the 19th - 25th episodes; it's like it was passed off to a second-rate studio, some of the characters are somewhat unrecognizeable at first, nor did the animation flow as nicely (or at all).  That was my biggest pet-peeve.I can deal with piecing a story together, I quite like that aspect; a good flashforward, several flashbacks... the pieces all go together (eventually); especially with the awkwardly pieced together ""Walk Onwards, Children"" episode, it showed some insightful relations (like why the archer girl couldn't use her right arm).  The first 'season' of 14 episodes had me wanting to watch them straight through, and it's always a good sign when not only do I want to watch the season again, but watch an episode again right away; the first half is that good in my opinion.The second half of Martial Fist (Stars of Fate) goes a bit off the deep end; with the ho-hum storyline, bad animation, I could have skipped the last story arc for the most part.  And yes, not only is there unanswered questions, there's characters that end up being vampires -- did not see that coming, and have NO idea what it added to the story.  Maybe I should  play the video game?  Heh.  But overall, the first half of this series is incredible and recommended.",4,Majin Magic,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2356,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'slightly', 'unbiased', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'also', 'liked', 'other', 'anime', 'such', 'Devil', 'May', 'Cry', 'Sands', 'Destruction', 'comic', 'based', 'Witchblade', 'never', 'played', 'games', 'read', 'comic', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'different', 'formats', 'are', 'different', 'movies/books/video', 'games', 'like', 'nuances', 'original', 'work', 'special', 'also', 'enjoy', 'when', 'anime', 'off', 'episode', ""n't"", 'character', 'build', 'develop', 'plot', 'just', 'out', 'HUGE', 'bang', 'later', 'episodes', 'explain', 'actions/reactions', 'characters', 'quite', 'nicely', 'get', 'kick', 'Miss', 'Alucard', 'Anko', 'reporter', 'backgrounds', 'character', 'design', 'fluidity', 'animation', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'stunned', 'thought', 'wonderful.At', 'least', 'first', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'story', 'arc', '14', 'episodes', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'Martial', 'Fist', 'story', 'arc', '26th', 'thank-you', 'episode', 'titled', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'first', 'half', 'Martial', 'Fist', 'story', 'arc', 'Not', 'sure', 'WHAT', 'heck', 'happened', 'production', 'quality', 'character', 'design', '19th', '25th', 'episodes', 'was', 'passed', 'off', 'second-rate', 'studio', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'unrecognizeable', 'first', 'did', 'animation', 'flow', 'nicely', 'was', 'biggest', 'pet-peeve.I', 'can', 'deal', 'piecing', 'story', 'together', 'quite', 'aspect', 'good', 'flashforward', 'several', 'flashbacks', 'pieces', 'go', 'together', 'eventually', 'especially', 'awkwardly', 'pieced', 'together', 'Walk', 'Onwards', 'Children', 'episode', 'showed', 'insightful', 'relations', 'why', 'archer', 'girl', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'right', 'arm', 'first', ""'season"", '14', 'episodes', 'had', 'wanting', 'watch', 'straight', 'always', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'want', 'watch', 'season', 'again', 'watch', 'episode', 'again', 'right', 'away', 'first', 'half', 'good', 'opinion.The', 'second', 'half', 'Martial', 'Fist', 'Stars', 'Fate', 'bit', 'deep', 'end', 'ho-hum', 'storyline', 'bad', 'animation', 'could', 'have', 'skipped', 'last', 'story', 'arc', 'most', 'part', 'yes', 'not', 'only', 'there', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'vampires', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'have', 'NO', 'idea', 'what', 'added', 'story', 'Maybe', 'should', 'play', 'video', 'game', 'Heh', 'overall', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'incredible', 'recommended']",N/A

What I got was an awesome and fun ride with a great cast of characters and awesome looking monsters. What really drove this one home was a few things first off I loved that our heroes went out of their way to save and redeem the possessed people being used by the demons and even try to save the demons some actually joined their side of the fight which I thought was cool. Another big reason was the character design all the characters looked Asian and were drawn to look that way. And the last big point for me was how fluid the animation was the fights were well put together and easy to follow.

1274417,AHF97M45JFCB,B002KD9C18,ONENEO,"[12, 13]","To confess, I'm not a big ""horror anime"" buff but typically enjoy series based on successful video game franchises.  As such it was with a blend of expectations that I set out to review Tokyo Majin, The Complete Series.Interestingly enough, it appears as though Funimation has actually released this previous ADV Films' property as two individual season sets and is now planning a complete series box set, which contains all 26 episodes of the show.Released across four discs (in a double-sized clamshell case), The Complete Series consists of episodes 1-26 and comes in at a total runtime of 650 minutes. It wears an appropriate TV MA (mature, 17+) rating due to violence, gore, and supernatural imagery.Language options are standard sub & dub with both an English dub (Dolby 5.1 Digital Surround) and original Japanese soundtrack (stereo) & the choice of English subtitled if so inclined to turn them on.The story goes something like this: The mystical energy flow that maintains order to the world (the Dragon Stream) has been disrupted.  As a direct result of this disturbance, a whole bunch incidents have erupted across Tokyo, including a surge of deaths, plagues of zombies, and six teenagers (who want nothing more than to live the simple life of students) suddenly gaining mystical powers.It's tough to put the show into a single category; it would be foolish to downplay the supernatural/ mystical elements as they are catalyst that drives the plot but in terms of delivery and pacing, Tokyo Majin may more closely resemble an action series.  In other words yes there are some moody environments throughout and attempts at depth by establishing conflicted pasts for a few of the main characters, the series is really the medium in which to showcase super-human action sequences.  Teenagers who can fire glowing mystical arrows from a bow or a tough guy who can uppercut through hordes of swarming monsters is going to be good onscreen fun, bottom line.Viewers can expect episodes loaded with gruesome creatures, flashy magical effects, and fight scenes loaded to the hilt with animation detail.  For the most part, the formula works so long as you go into the show without expectations of a deep psychological thriller element.  This is superhero fun against the legions of the underworld first and foremost; drama and mystery serve only to compliment the greater mission at hand.The visuals are pretty solid throughout with just the right texturing (and gore elements) to make for some truly nasty nasties and the environmental tones are nice and gritty as well.  The sound work is solid for the most part, with eerie notes working nicely into the background and slick tension-building strings when the mood calls for them.  Unfortunately the hard rock anthem done by ACID at the opening and closing of each episode comes off as a bit misguided until you realize that it is the theme for the evil rock star villain later on in the prose.In all, this is a show where the visuals and effects certainly outshine the writing but perhaps that's exactly what makes it so unique.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little supernatural butt whipping by some everyday kids.  It's also really decent of Funimation to consider their fans in deciding to release a full 26-episode box set release for little more than the individual seasons have been selling for until now.",3,"A Fun-Filled, Supernatural Brawl",1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,3382,"['confess', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'horror', 'anime', 'buff', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'series', 'based', 'successful', 'video', 'game', 'such', 'was', 'blend', 'expectations', 'set', 'out', 'review', 'Tokyo', 'Majin', 'Complete', 'Series.Interestingly', 'enough', 'Funimation', 'actually', 'released', 'previous', 'ADV', 'Films', 'property', 'two', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'now', 'planning', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', '26', 'episodes', 'show.Released', 'four', 'discs', 'double-sized', 'clamshell', 'case', 'Complete', 'Series', 'episodes', '1-26', 'total', 'runtime', '650', 'minutes', 'appropriate', 'TV', 'MA', 'mature', '17+', 'rating', 'due', 'violence', 'gore', 'supernatural', 'imagery.Language', 'options', 'are', 'standard', 'sub', 'dub', 'English', 'dub', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'original', 'Japanese', 'soundtrack', 'stereo', 'choice', 'English', 'subtitled', 'so', 'inclined', 'turn', 'on.The', 'story', 'something', 'mystical', 'energy', 'flow', 'order', 'world', 'Dragon', 'Stream', 'been', 'disrupted', 'direct', 'result', 'disturbance', 'whole', 'bunch', 'incidents', 'have', 'erupted', 'Tokyo', 'including', 'surge', 'deaths', 'plagues', 'zombies', 'six', 'teenagers', 'who', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'live', 'simple', 'life', 'students', 'suddenly', 'gaining', 'mystical', 'powers.It', 'tough', 'put', 'show', 'single', 'category', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'downplay', 'supernatural/', 'mystical', 'elements', 'are', 'catalyst', 'plot', 'terms', 'delivery', 'pacing', 'Tokyo', 'Majin', 'may', 'more', 'closely', 'resemble', 'action', 'series', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'moody', 'environments', 'attempts', 'depth', 'establishing', 'conflicted', 'pasts', 'few', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'really', 'medium', 'showcase', 'super-human', 'action', 'sequences', 'Teenagers', 'who', 'can', 'fire', 'glowing', 'mystical', 'arrows', 'bow', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'uppercut', 'hordes', 'swarming', 'monsters', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'onscreen', 'fun', 'bottom', 'line.Viewers', 'can', 'expect', 'episodes', 'loaded', 'gruesome', 'creatures', 'flashy', 'magical', 'effects', 'fight', 'scenes', 'loaded', 'hilt', 'animation', 'detail', 'most', 'part', 'formula', 'so', 'long', 'go', 'show', 'expectations', 'deep', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'element', 'superhero', 'fun', 'legions', 'underworld', 'first', 'foremost', 'drama', 'mystery', 'serve', 'only', 'compliment', 'greater', 'mission', 'hand.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'just', 'right', 'texturing', 'gore', 'elements', 'make', 'truly', 'nasty', 'nasties', 'environmental', 'tones', 'are', 'nice', 'gritty', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'work', 'solid', 'most', 'part', 'eerie', 'notes', 'working', 'nicely', 'background', 'slick', 'tension-building', 'strings', 'when', 'mood', 'Unfortunately', 'hard', 'rock', 'anthem', 'done', 'ACID', 'opening', 'closing', 'episode', 'off', 'bit', 'misguided', 'realize', 'theme', 'evil', 'rock', 'star', 'villain', 'later', 'prose.In', 'show', 'where', 'visuals', 'effects', 'certainly', 'outshine', 'writing', 'perhaps', 'exactly', 'what', 'so', 'unique', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'little', 'supernatural', 'butt', 'whipping', 'everyday', 'kids', 'also', 'really', 'decent', 'Funimation', 'consider', 'fans', 'deciding', 'release', 'full', '26-episode', 'box', 'set', 'release', 'little', 'more', 'individual', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'selling', 'now']",N/A
1274418,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B002KD9C18,RavenRing,"[16, 17]","If you've just started watching the first episode and come here to see if there is some prequel series you are missing - just keep watching, the second episode clears everything up (and really should have been the first episode).Mysterious transfer student, Tatsuma Hiyuu, and delinquent student, Kyouichi Houraiji, along with their schoolmates, strong guy who cooks, annoying archery girl, and annoying helpless good girl, fight the 'Reborn Dead' and other monsters. Apparently they all have psychic powers, though it is never too clear on exactly how they have these powers or how their power works. The series is split into two arcs; the first they fight against a creepy, probably insane, guy with interesting make-up, and in the second arc they go against his boss.The storyline is a little confusing and not quite clear, but despite the extremely 2-dimensional stereotypical characters, this series was actually pretty fun. The storyline was pretty dumb at times, but it did manage flashes of originality that made it worth finishing. The characters never really improve, or get stronger or more interesting, but you learn to just accept them and enjoy the action. But if you choose this show just because of the ""Mysterious transfer student"", prepare to be disappointed. When it finally sort of explains his past, it is brief and not very interesting. That is my biggest complaint about this series - it sets itself up for big revelations and really fails in the delivery - i.e. one character is introduced as though she was disposable, but it is then hinted that she will be important later on. Then she does almost nothing and what little she did do, I didn't understand the significance of. I still don't quite understand the motivations of any of the bad guys either.The art is decent. The character designs are not too bad, but some of the settings are really well done. The destruction of various parts of the city was always fun to watch. I don't remember the music at all, but it was probably ok. I watched it in Japanese, and the voice cast did a good job. Nothing stellar, but not weak.For the price, this is a pretty good series to pick up.

I watched this series on Youtube before buying the DVD Set. I try to do that to avoid purchasing a bad Anime set. I liked this story because it was not drawn out too long, and the story unfolds in an unusual style. You don't learn how they got their powers till the second episode, and it honestly works for me that way. They plunge you right into the action, and then take you along for the ride. The characters themselves are what interested me the most, because they all seem to unfold themselves as the story progresses. They're not always fearless and perfect, and they don't always save the person that needs saving --but they try. My only complaint is that there were other characters that needed more fleshing out and the ending to the show leaves it open for a future return to tell another tale. I honestly wish they would do an OVA or something to give us that conclusion but I'm not holding my breath for one.The kids kind of reminded me of the cast of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series in that they find themselves in this world of mysticism and horror, and they do their best to deal with it. They try to protect each other and grow through the series. There are some heart wrenching moments and I think I liked that best of all. If It makes any difference to anyone, I watched the series first, then I bought the DVD.",5,One of my favorites,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,1469,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'bunch', 'technical', 'things', 'say', 'DVD', 'Set', 'buy', 'watch', 'not', 'critique', 'science', 'project', 'watched', 'series', 'Youtube', 'buying', 'DVD', 'Set', 'try', 'do', 'avoid', 'purchasing', 'bad', 'Anime', 'set', 'liked', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'drawn', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'unfolds', 'unusual', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'how', 'got', 'powers', 'till', 'second', 'episode', 'honestly', 'way', 'plunge', 'right', 'action', 'then', 'take', 'along', 'ride', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'interested', 'most', 'seem', 'unfold', 'story', ""'re"", 'not', 'always', 'fearless', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'save', 'person', 'saving', 'try', 'only', 'complaint', 'were', 'other', 'characters', 'needed', 'more', 'fleshing', 'out', 'ending', 'show', 'open', 'future', 'return', 'tell', 'tale', 'honestly', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'OVA', 'something', 'give', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'one.The', 'kids', 'kind', 'reminded', 'cast', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'series', 'find', 'world', 'mysticism', 'horror', 'do', 'best', 'deal', 'try', 'protect', 'other', 'grow', 'series', 'are', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'moments', 'think', 'liked', 'best', 'difference', 'anyone', 'watched', 'series', 'first', 'then', 'bought', 'DVD']",N/A
