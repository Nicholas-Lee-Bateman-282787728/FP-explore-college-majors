It was a great movie, and I thought it was a little humorous that the pony was narrating the entire movie, but at least it was not a distraction. I have seen movies with talking horses before and at times, they became a little redondent. But I think this one was really the best. More often than not, I read the notes about the movie and then make a decision to purchase or not. Those product notes are very very important although at times, misleading as to language and content. This one was not, and I loved it. This was an excellent movie. I think it touched all of the emotions every single one of them. The horses were absolutely beautiful, and it was easy to become absorbed in their lives. The introduction of the tribal children and their interaction with the horse was excellent, and the ending was unbelievable, who could expect that outcome. I cannot wait to watch it again. Great movie!",5,Running Free,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,1009,"['first', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'narrative', 'was', 'coming', 'then', 'realized', 'was', 'pony', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'humorous', 'pony', 'was', 'narrating', 'entire', 'movie', 'least', 'was', 'not', 'distraction', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'talking', 'horses', 'times', 'became', 'little', 'redondent', 'think', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'best', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'read', 'notes', 'movie', 'then', 'make', 'decision', 'purchase', 'not', 'product', 'notes', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'important', 'times', 'misleading', 'language', 'content', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'loved', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'think', 'touched', 'emotions', 'single', 'one', 'horses', 'were', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'was', 'easy', 'become', 'absorbed', 'lives', 'introduction', 'tribal', 'children', 'interaction', 'horse', 'was', 'excellent', 'ending', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'who', 'could', 'expect', 'outcome', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'watch', 'again', 'Great', 'movie']",N/A

556599,A1D663YD036KNH,B00004XONZ,paperbackriter,"[52, 53]","An inspiring tale of a young colt named Lucky who endures much tragedy -- separation from his mother, war and isolation-- before gathering the courage to roam free in the grueling African desert. Anyone who has ever pondered an animal's point of view will greatly appreciate Lukas Haas' narration as the inquisitive voice of Lucky. The pure and, ultimately, triumphant views of this sensitive equine are truly thought-provoking in a world where animals are often discarded. The sweeping cinematography of the African desert is stunning and, at times, reminiscent of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Chase Moore as the young boy who strikes up an everlasting friendship with Lucky. Overall, &quot;Running Free&quot; is a beautiful film which touts the triumph of good over evil, and the persistence of will which allows the underdog to prevail. A word of caution to parents: a frightening war scene and a pair of violent horse fights may be too intense for young children. Otherwise, a highly recommended movie.",5,A Triumph of Spirit,1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,1056,"['inspiring', 'tale', 'young', 'colt', 'named', 'Lucky', 'who', 'much', 'tragedy', 'separation', 'mother', 'war', 'isolation', 'gathering', 'courage', 'roam', 'free', 'grueling', 'African', 'desert', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'pondered', 'animal', 'point', 'view', 'will', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'narration', 'inquisitive', 'voice', 'Lucky', 'pure', 'ultimately', 'triumphant', 'views', 'sensitive', 'equine', 'are', 'truly', 'thought-provoking', 'world', 'where', 'animals', 'are', 'often', 'discarded', 'sweeping', 'cinematography', 'African', 'desert', 'stunning', 'times', 'reminiscent', 'quot', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'quot', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Chase', 'Moore', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'everlasting', 'friendship', 'Lucky', 'Overall', 'quot', 'Running', 'Free', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'film', 'triumph', 'good', 'evil', 'persistence', 'will', 'underdog', 'prevail', 'word', 'caution', 'parents', 'frightening', 'war', 'scene', 'pair', 'violent', 'horse', 'fights', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'young', 'children', 'Otherwise', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie']",N/A
