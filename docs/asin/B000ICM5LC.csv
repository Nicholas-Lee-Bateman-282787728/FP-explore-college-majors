I did not understand Robin's character way of thinking.What I loved about it was Sean Blakemore.  He played his part well.  I was convinced that his pain was real.  It did not hurt that he is easy on my eyeballs.Tyler if you listening or reading, how about featuring this chocolate hunk in one of your productions.

Hampton ""Author""","[45, 45]","In Reggie Gaskins' latest film, Restraining Order, you'll get an opportunity to see the works of Robin Givens, as well as the phenomenal performance of Sean Blakemore, who continues to show the world that he has what it takes to bring such a thrilling novel alive. The storyline flowed tremendously well, and as Diane(Robin) tries to separate herself from a marriage that she no longer wants to be in, Dontae(Sean) ain't having it. Like many men who put forth every effort to ""take care of home"", Dontae is stunned by his wife's sudden non interest and he turns into a crazed individual. A divorce is not an option for him and the story has a tramatic ending, proving that honesty is definitely the best policy. The most enjoyable thing about this movie is the ability to keep the viewer speculating and wondering who the other man is. Once the individual was revealed, it was a shocker and I certainly didn't see it coming. No doubt, this is one to add to your DVD collection.",5,"Something new, exciting, and a bit different...",1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,977,"['Reggie', 'Gaskins', 'latest', 'film', 'Restraining', 'Order', ""'ll"", 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'works', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'as', 'well', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'Sean', 'Blakemore', 'who', 'show', 'world', 'what', 'bring', 'thrilling', 'novel', 'alive', 'storyline', 'flowed', 'tremendously', 'well', 'Diane', 'Robin', 'separate', 'marriage', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'Dontae', 'Sean', 'ai', ""n't"", 'having', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'put', 'forth', 'effort', 'take', 'care', 'home', 'Dontae', 'stunned', 'wife', 'sudden', 'non', 'interest', 'crazed', 'individual', 'divorce', 'not', 'option', 'story', 'tramatic', 'ending', 'proving', 'honesty', 'definitely', 'best', 'policy', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'thing', 'movie', 'ability', 'keep', 'viewer', 'speculating', 'wondering', 'who', 'other', 'man', 'Once', 'individual', 'was', 'revealed', 'was', 'shocker', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'doubt', 'one', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection']",Restraining Order codeblack

It is an acronym for a hot @zz mess. That pretty much sums up the whole film from start to finish. I watched this with my friend and we were on the floor laughing the whole time at this blunder. The bad editing and writing, horrific acting, and awkward camera angles will have you in stitches. In one shot, it looked like they switched from film to video. Don't get me wrong I knew this film was low budget but come on they could have done better. It seemed as if they had a budget of $20.00 and half of that looked like it was spent on the food. And Robin Givens, sweety, are times really this hard? I would have given you the money to pay your master card bill for the month.
