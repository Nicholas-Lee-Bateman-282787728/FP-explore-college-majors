My own tastes must be out of sync with today's television since I'm definitely in the minority here. I just didn't care for this show -- I didn't find it at all funny.First of all, I don't care for ""reality"" shows to begin with, so that was an issue from the start. But this never seemed ""real"" at all -- it was stagey and the dialogue was stilted. When people are obviously aware they're on camera, their actions are seldom authentic.Also, watching two apparently fairly wealthy guys play at being farmers wasn't for me. The guy (can't remember which was which) who had to line up the farm machines all neat in a row wasn't funny or even quirky. He was seriously neurotic. It was almost as bad as watching Paris Hilton trying to act like a ""normal"" middle class person.I think the premise of two city folk (gay or straight) moving to the country might have been funny as a scripted sitcom, but this didn't work for me at all. I'll think I'll go and watch reruns of the old British comedy, Good Neighbors.",2,An uneasy (and unfunny) mix of reality show and sitcom,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,1111,"['Comedy', 'such', 'subjective', 'thing', ""n't"", 'mean', 'people', 'love', 'dry', 'wit', 'other', 'prefer', 'slapstick', 'own', 'tastes', 'must', 'be', 'sync', 'today', 'television', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'minority', 'here', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny.First', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'reality', 'shows', 'begin', 'was', 'issue', 'start', 'never', 'seemed', 'real', 'was', 'stagey', 'dialogue', 'was', 'stilted', 'When', 'people', 'are', 'obviously', 'aware', ""'re"", 'camera', 'actions', 'are', 'seldom', 'authentic.Also', 'watching', 'two', 'apparently', 'fairly', 'wealthy', 'guys', 'play', 'being', 'farmers', 'was', ""n't"", 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'who', 'had', 'line', 'up', 'farm', 'machines', 'neat', 'row', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'even', 'quirky', 'was', 'seriously', 'neurotic', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'watching', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'trying', 'act', 'normal', 'middle', 'class', 'person.I', 'think', 'premise', 'two', 'city', 'folk', 'gay', 'straight', 'moving', 'country', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'scripted', 'sitcom', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', ""'ll"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'go', 'watch', 'reruns', 'old', 'British', 'comedy', 'Good', 'Neighbors']",Fabulous Beekman Boys

Unlike the current television programs that purport to show the changing American family with stereotypes, straight actors in gay parts, gay actors in straight parts, and foul language that isn't funny, the Beekman Boys are real, really gay, farming in a village of 500 people who think they are nice guys, and have the same laughs and arguments and throw the same hissy fits we all do.  In short, they are Real.  And we know for a fact they are generous friends, great neighbors, and funny smart.  They won the Amazing Race last year on CBS, paid off their farm and built a business that is benefitting this small town in upstate New York, so for that alone, they are living the American dream of life with love and happiness.
