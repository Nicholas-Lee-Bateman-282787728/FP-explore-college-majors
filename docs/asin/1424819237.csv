177171,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,1424819237,A. Burchfield,"[6, 7]","7 straight years of good SciFi televison is what Stargate can lay claim to, most shows don't even last that long let alone remain good.As with any series/season there are good and bad episodes in the 7th, this one is as worth buying as the previous ones.Disc(1) #1 Fallen was an interesting reintro for Michael Shanks although his subsequent readaptation to humanity wasn't very well handled through the season.#3 Fragile Balance was an interesting take on the Alien abduction theory involving a smart mouthed young O'Neill clone (that kid did a good Richard Dean Anderson imitation)and a rogue Asgard scientist using humans in unauthorized experiments.Disc(2) #7 Enemy Mine involved trouble on a planet where the SGC is mining Naquadah. The Unas who live there still hate their former Goa'uld masters and there's almost a war with them until Daniel Jackson negotiates a truce in which they operate the mines and Earth fights the Goa'uld.#8 Space Race was kind of silly I thought. Carter helps an Alien friend in a race in return for technology access (I think it was supposed to show Carter's/Tapping's fun side)Disc(3)#10 Birthright concerned female Jaffa warriors, kind of interesting, main point here is the first appearance of Jolene Blalock (T'Pol, Enterprise -that show was probably killed off, in part, by Stargate)Disc(4)#13 Grace involved USAF starship Prometheus (looks nice but I still think such a ship couldn't have been built less than 7 years after first getting the technology)and Carter getting injured in an attack. She keeps seeing people who aren't there (she was left alone on the ship)and has to figure a way out of the nebula Prometheus and the alien ship are trapped in. She trades her idea to the unseen aliens (never again mentioned in the series)in return for her fellow, captured crewmates. In #14 Falout, Jonas Quinn needs help from Earth in topping a runaway Naquadriah reaction in his homeworld of Kelowna. It wasn't a bad story, even involved a Goa'uld in his girlfriend, but the Kelownan's are supposed to be mostly behind Earth in technology- yet here they've got a ship/drill capable of drilling deep into the planetary crust.Disc(5)#18 Heroes, part 2 did a good job of keeping the viewer guessing which of the characters actually got killed during the filming of a documentary. That was a better subplot than the idea of a secret documentary of the Stargate program as a main plot. #20/21 Inauguration/Lost City were sort of a set up for the forthcoming StarGate: Atlantis and concerned the new President (William Devane) learning about the StarGate program and dealing with the attack by Super Goa'uld Anubis on Earth. Generally well done, nice to look at (had the Prometheus again)even had a bit when the new President stopped to look at a bust of late President Kennedy (Devane played the role of Kennedy once).As always, the featurettes are well worth looking at, you'll learn something about the show (those people seem to enjoy the work and doing the featurettes) and the actors. Amanda Tapping's bit wasn't so much about Stargate as it was about what she does with her time off. She evidently wore a wig during at least part of 7th season, her off camera real hair is so long. Richard Dean Anderson didn't really talk about StarGate at all, mostly about his travels on, I think, some documentaries.If you're a StarGate fan, you need the set- if you're new to the show it's worth a look.",4,Best SciFi currently on Television,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,3430,"['7', 'straight', 'years', 'good', 'SciFi', 'televison', 'what', 'Stargate', 'can', 'lay', 'claim', 'most', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'last', 'long', 'let', 'alone', 'remain', 'good.As', 'series/season', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'episodes', '7th', 'one', 'worth', 'buying', 'previous', 'ones.Disc', '1', '1', 'Fallen', 'was', 'interesting', 'reintro', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'subsequent', 'readaptation', 'humanity', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'season.', '3', 'Fragile', 'Balance', 'was', 'interesting', 'take', 'Alien', 'abduction', 'theory', 'involving', 'smart', 'mouthed', 'young', ""O'Neill"", 'clone', 'kid', 'did', 'good', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'imitation', 'rogue', 'Asgard', 'scientist', 'using', 'humans', 'unauthorized', 'experiments.Disc', '2', '7', 'Enemy', 'Mine', 'involved', 'trouble', 'planet', 'where', 'SGC', 'mining', 'Naquadah', 'Unas', 'who', 'live', 'still', 'hate', 'former', ""Goa'uld"", 'masters', 'almost', 'war', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'truce', 'operate', 'mines', 'Earth', 'fights', ""Goa'uld."", '8', 'Space', 'Race', 'was', 'kind', 'silly', 'thought', 'Carter', 'Alien', 'friend', 'race', 'return', 'technology', 'access', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'show', ""Carter's/Tapping"", 'fun', 'side', 'Disc', '3', '10', 'Birthright', 'concerned', 'female', 'Jaffa', 'warriors', 'kind', 'interesting', 'main', 'point', 'here', 'first', 'appearance', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', ""T'Pol"", 'Enterprise', '-that', 'show', 'was', 'probably', 'killed', 'off', 'part', 'Stargate', 'Disc', '4', '13', 'Grace', 'involved', 'USAF', 'starship', 'Prometheus', 'nice', 'still', 'think', 'ship', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'built', 'less', '7', 'years', 'first', 'getting', 'technology', 'Carter', 'getting', 'injured', 'attack', 'seeing', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'was', 'left', 'alone', 'ship', 'figure', 'way', 'nebula', 'Prometheus', 'alien', 'ship', 'are', 'trapped', 'idea', 'unseen', 'aliens', 'never', 'again', 'mentioned', 'series', 'return', 'fellow', 'captured', 'crewmates', '14', 'Falout', 'Jonas', 'Quinn', 'help', 'Earth', 'topping', 'runaway', 'Naquadriah', 'reaction', 'homeworld', 'Kelowna', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'story', 'even', 'involved', ""Goa'uld"", 'girlfriend', 'Kelownan', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'mostly', 'Earth', 'technology-', 'yet', 'here', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ship/drill', 'capable', 'drilling', 'deep', 'planetary', 'crust.Disc', '5', '18', 'Heroes', 'part', '2', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'characters', 'actually', 'got', 'killed', 'filming', 'documentary', 'was', 'better', 'subplot', 'idea', 'secret', 'documentary', 'Stargate', 'program', 'main', 'plot', '20/21', 'Inauguration/Lost', 'City', 'were', 'sort', 'set', 'up', 'forthcoming', 'StarGate', 'Atlantis', 'concerned', 'new', 'President', 'William', 'Devane', 'learning', 'StarGate', 'program', 'dealing', 'attack', 'Super', ""Goa'uld"", 'Anubis', 'Earth', 'Generally', 'well', 'done', 'nice', 'look', 'had', 'Prometheus', 'again', 'even', 'had', 'bit', 'when', 'new', 'President', 'stopped', 'look', 'bust', 'late', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'Devane', 'played', 'role', 'Kennedy', 'once', '.As', 'always', 'featurettes', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'looking', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'something', 'show', 'people', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'work', 'doing', 'featurettes', 'actors', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'bit', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'about', 'Stargate', 'was', 'what', 'time', 'off', 'evidently', 'wore', 'wig', 'least', 'part', '7th', 'season', 'off', 'camera', 'real', 'hair', 'so', 'long', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'StarGate', 'mostly', 'travels', 'think', 'documentaries.If', ""'re"", 'StarGate', 'fan', 'need', 'set-', ""'re"", 'new', 'show', 'look']",N/A

177177,ABSX5TGEGRH76,1424819237,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[5, 8]","I must say that I've never seen a show with more ""false endings"" than Stargate: SG-1.  What I mean by this is that, for the past three years, the producers have believed that the show was going to end, so the series was preparing for a finale, only to be renewed.  In Season 6, they were planning on ending with a cliff-hanger and would do a spin-off feature film.  Then they got picked up for another year.  That brought us to this season; originally, the finale, Lost City, was going to be a film, then they decided not to.  However, they thought that this would be the last season, and Lost City was going to have it be a lead-in into the upcoming spin-off series, Stargate: Atlantis.  It remained a good lead-in (it even had some of the theme music from Atlantis in the background), but SG-1 was picked up for an 8th year!  This is actually when I started watching.  Anyway, they were sure that it would end after Season 8, so the entire year was leading up to the end, only to be renewed for a NINTH season (but more on that in the Season 8 review)!Anyway, the 7th Season starts a few months after the end of year 6.  Jonas Quinn (Corin Nemec) is still trying to find the location of the Lost City of the Ancients that he and the then-ascended Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) had found out about on the planet Abydos.  He finds a lead, and he and the rest of SG-1, Col. Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), Maj. Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping), and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) travel to a planet where they find, of all people, Daniel in human form without any memories of who he was.  Soonafter, though, he regains his memories and rejoins SG-1, while Jonas returns to his warring homeworld to serve as an ambassador.There were some great stories this year, involving old friends and enemies.  Sadly, the goa'uld Anubis only made a few appearances, but they were all memorable.  Also, the system lord Ba'al was often mentioned, but he never appeared this year (pity).  Right now, Ba'al is the leader of the other system lords who are opposing Anubis, who is currently trying to wipe out the rest of the goa'uld lords in order to become an unstoppable force.  He gains a huge advantage this year in the episodes ""Evolution, Pts. 1 and 2""; he is finally able to create a foot soldier superior to Jaffas; the Kull warrior.  They are drones; completely loyal to their creator, and they wear armor that protects them from bullets, energy-based weapons, and even most explosions.One of my favorite stories was the two-part season finale, ""Lost City"".  The now Vice President Kinsey (Ronny Cox), who was in 4 episodes this year, had time to show even more deviousness, President Hayes (William Devane) got to show his ability to lead this country well, the character of Dr. Elizabeth Weir was introduced (although she was played by Jessica Steen instead of Torri Higginson, who plays her next year on SG-1 and Atlantis), and Gen. Hammond (Don S. Davis) got a cool new job.  Also, there were many cool fights and revelations.Some of the best episodes this year were the premiere episodes, ""Fallen"" and ""Homecoming"", ""Fragile Balance"" with the cloned O'Neill, ""Revisions"", ""Lifeboat"", ""Space Race"", ""Avenger 2.0"", ""Evolution, Pts. 1 and 2"", ""Grace"", ""Chimaera"", ""Death Knell"", ""Heroes, Pts. 1 and 2"", which actually led to the death of a beloved character who's been around since the beginning, ""Ingauguration"", and ""Lost City, Pts. 1 and 2"".Having said that there were many great stories this year, there were a few episodes that I must mention my dissatisfaction with.  First, there was ""Enemy Mine"", which involved the Unas and Daniel's friend Chaka.  Then there was ""Birthright"", involving some female Jaffa.  I can't say enough how much I could care less about the Unas and the Jaffa.  I enjoy most stories about the different races, but the writers can't seem to come up with anything new about either of these two races.  If they can create some new problem that hasn't been done and is interesting, then by all means, go with them, but until then, ignore the Unas and the Jaffa.Fortunately, as usual, the good of the season far outweights the bad.",5,Lost and Found,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,4148,"['must', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'more', 'false', 'endings', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'What', 'mean', 'past', 'three', 'years', 'producers', 'have', 'believed', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'series', 'was', 'preparing', 'finale', 'only', 'be', 'renewed', 'Season', '6', 'were', 'planning', 'ending', 'cliff-hanger', 'would', 'do', 'spin-off', 'feature', 'film', 'Then', 'got', 'picked', 'up', 'year', 'brought', 'season', 'originally', 'finale', 'Lost', 'City', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'then', 'decided', 'not', 'However', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'Lost', 'City', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'be', 'lead-in', 'upcoming', 'spin-off', 'series', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'remained', 'good', 'lead-in', 'even', 'had', 'theme', 'music', 'Atlantis', 'background', 'SG-1', 'was', 'picked', 'up', '8th', 'year', 'actually', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'Anyway', 'were', 'sure', 'would', 'end', 'Season', '8', 'entire', 'year', 'was', 'leading', 'up', 'end', 'only', 'be', 'renewed', 'NINTH', 'season', 'more', 'Season', '8', 'review', 'Anyway', '7th', 'Season', 'few', 'months', 'end', 'year', '6', 'Jonas', 'Quinn', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'location', 'Lost', 'City', 'Ancients', 'then-ascended', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'had', 'found', 'out', 'planet', 'Abydos', 'lead', 'rest', 'SG-1', 'Col.', 'Jack', ""O'Neill"", 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'Maj.', 'Sam', 'Carter', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'Teal', 'c', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'travel', 'planet', 'where', 'find', 'people', 'Daniel', 'human', 'form', 'memories', 'who', 'was', 'Soonafter', 'though', 'memories', 'SG-1', 'Jonas', 'returns', 'warring', 'homeworld', 'serve', 'ambassador.There', 'were', 'great', 'stories', 'year', 'involving', 'old', 'friends', 'enemies', 'Sadly', ""goa'uld"", 'Anubis', 'only', 'made', 'few', 'appearances', 'were', 'memorable', 'Also', 'system', 'lord', ""Ba'al"", 'was', 'often', 'mentioned', 'never', 'appeared', 'year', 'pity', 'Right', 'now', ""Ba'al"", 'leader', 'other', 'system', 'lords', 'who', 'are', 'opposing', 'Anubis', 'who', 'currently', 'trying', 'wipe', 'out', 'rest', ""goa'uld"", 'lords', 'order', 'become', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'gains', 'huge', 'advantage', 'year', 'episodes', 'Evolution', 'Pts', '1', '2', 'finally', 'able', 'create', 'foot', 'soldier', 'superior', 'Jaffas', 'Kull', 'warrior', 'are', 'drones', 'completely', 'loyal', 'creator', 'wear', 'armor', 'bullets', 'energy-based', 'weapons', 'even', 'most', 'explosions.One', 'favorite', 'stories', 'was', 'two-part', 'season', 'finale', 'Lost', 'City', 'now', 'Vice', 'President', 'Kinsey', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'who', 'was', '4', 'episodes', 'year', 'had', 'time', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'deviousness', 'President', 'Hayes', 'William', 'Devane', 'got', 'show', 'ability', 'lead', 'country', 'well', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Elizabeth', 'Weir', 'was', 'introduced', 'was', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Steen', 'instead', 'Torri', 'Higginson', 'who', 'next', 'year', 'SG-1', 'Atlantis', 'Gen.', 'Hammond', 'Don', 'S.', 'Davis', 'got', 'cool', 'new', 'job', 'Also', 'were', 'many', 'cool', 'fights', 'revelations.Some', 'best', 'episodes', 'year', 'were', 'premiere', 'episodes', 'Fallen', 'Homecoming', 'Fragile', 'Balance', 'cloned', ""O'Neill"", 'Revisions', 'Lifeboat', 'Space', 'Race', '2.0', 'Evolution', 'Pts', '1', '2', 'Grace', 'Chimaera', 'Death', 'Knell', 'Heroes', 'Pts', '1', '2', 'actually', 'led', 'death', 'beloved', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'beginning', 'Ingauguration', 'Lost', 'City', 'Pts', '1', '2', '.Having', 'said', 'were', 'many', 'great', 'stories', 'year', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'must', 'mention', 'dissatisfaction', 'First', 'was', 'Enemy', 'Mine', 'involved', 'Unas', 'Daniel', 'friend', 'Chaka', 'Then', 'was', 'Birthright', 'involving', 'female', 'Jaffa', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Unas', 'Jaffa', 'enjoy', 'most', 'stories', 'different', 'races', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'new', 'two', 'races', 'can', 'create', 'new', 'problem', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'interesting', 'then', 'means', 'go', 'then', 'ignore', 'Unas', 'Jaffa.Fortunately', 'usual', 'good', 'season', 'far', 'bad']",N/A

177204,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,1424819237,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[1, 2]","This season has some good episodes but, mostly, it is not up to the same standard as the middle seasons. There are some major changes in this season and Anubis becomes a major player who brings the battle home to earth. There is a change of presidential administrations and changes at the SGC. It is well worth the viewing but the whole show seems to be searching for a new direction. That direction may be found by the end of the season but it may require seeing the next season to make sure.Episode synopses appear below:Fallen - Last season ended with Anubis reneging on his deal with Daniel and then Daniel being whisked away to safety by parties unknown. The SG1 team recovered a tablet which should prove the key to finding the lost city of the Ancients. This season opens with Jonas figuring where he thinks that lost city to be. The team is dispatched and are surprised to find Daniel Jackson living there as a native. He has no memory prior to appearing there naked and unconscious. His memory starts to return fitfully but there are large gaps. That doesn't stop them from conceiving a plan to sucker Anubis to the planet and trying to wipe him out. It is a dangerous plan which is made all the more dangerous in that it depends on the cooperation of the ghoul, Lord Yu. Never trust a ghoul. Things go awry and Jonas is captured. Anubis' super ship is damaged but not destroyed and we are left to wonder how they are going to get out of this bad situation. I assume they do because I still have almost 2 seasons worth of DVDs to watch.Homecoming - Anubis has captured Jonas and uses his technology to probe his mind and learn the location of his home planet. He wants to go there because of the supply of the naquadria he needs to power his damaged super ship. Jonas' people have never encountered the ghouls before and don't realize how awful they are. SG1 tries to help them. They also have hopes of recovering Daniel and Jonas who are still stranded on Anubis' ship. They can't do it alone and are forced to make yet another deal with the ghoul system lords. Lord Yu didn't' work out because of some problems with ghoul senility. Teal'c hopes that Ba'al will work out better. The real problem is one of trust. We know we can't trust the ghouls. Jonas' people seem little more trustworthy than the last time we met them.Fragile Balance - A teenage kid shows up at the SGC bunker with Col. O'Neill's ID and claims to be the colonel. He has the attitude down right. It's fun from the Adult but grating from the kid. It is fun, though, to watch the others interact with him, especially when Maj. Carter offers to set up a Playstation for him. The young O'Neill turns out to be a problem. After much frustration and background research, this circumstance is revealed to have something in common with alien abductions and the ""Roswell"" aliens. A renegade Asgard named Loki is the one responsible for the abductions. He is conducting illicit experiments on humans to try and solve their racial genetic problem. The young clone is dying and the only hope of keeping him alive or of getting back the original O'Neill lies in capturing the Asgard.Orpheus - Teal'c is injured as the SG1 team evacuates a hostile planet. It is a serious injury but he begins to recover in his body. His mind is another matter. Teal'c has lost his confidence. Daniel Jackson is bothered as well although he cannot remember the reason why. Finally, they both realize that Bray'tac and Rayac, Teal'c's mentor and son are overdue. Daniel realizes that he has some knowledge of the place where the two are. They are prisoners working in a hellhole and time is running out. Bray'tac is out of the drug that sustains his life in the absence of the larval ghoul who used to inhabit him. Now, all the SG1 team has to do is mount a rescue mission against overwhelming odds.Revisions - The SG1 crew finds a devastated world with a completely toxic environment. Within that environment, there is a force field bubble containing an idyllic community. The bubble was created to protect the locals from their own depredations upon the environment. It is maintained by a giant computer network which also links to each and every inhabitant and looks after their well being. It seems too good to be true. It is. The link works both ways. It not only provides information, it edits memories to accomplish its own ends. The result is that people die. The hardest part is that nobody believes SG1 because the Link has edited their memories.Lifeboat - The SG1 crew finds a derelict ship crashed on a planet. While investigating it, they find hundreds of stasis units with cryogenically suspended people within. They are further checking out the ship when a strange light renders everyone unconscious. All revive with little worse than a headache except for Daniel Jackson. He is not himself...literally. In fact many personalities are inhabiting his body. They range from an arrogant sovereign to a frightened child. It seems that it is a desperate gambit to save the lives of the passengers of the crashed ship before the power supply to the stasis pods runs out. Some aliens have decided to sacrifice Daniel in an effort to save a few of their own. The SG1 crew is not amused.Enemy Mine - Stargate Command finally finds a planet with a viable supply of naquada but there is a problem. The expeditionary force is attacked by a tribe of feral Unas. The mine encroaches upon a sacred area where their ancestors were tortured and killed by ghouls. The local team leader is a hard charging, simple minded guy who does not have much use for the Unas. His preferred tactic at this point is to attack and wipe them out. Daniel Jackson has other ideas. He enlists the aide of Chaka, the Unas who once captured him, to broker an agreement with the locals. Negotiations are tense because of the colonel's dislike of the Unas, the Pentagon's desire for a large naquada supply and the Unas's own tribal warrior culture.Space Race - Last season, the SG1 team encountered a crashed alien ship delivering prisoners and helped the captain to reclaim his vessel. Now, the captain of that vessel has contacted the SG1 looking for Maj. Carter. He wants her to help him win a big race. It's like a space version of the America's Cup except that there are virtually no rules and that everyone fights dirty. The winner of the race gets a lucrative corporate contract. For Carter, this sounds like fun and will give her a chance to explore some alien technology. There is danger, though. Aside from the dangerous competition, there are hidden agendas that see to the sabotage of most of the ships. It's a fairly stupid episode but has a few light moments.Avenger 2.0 - Dr. Felger is nerdy scientist who last season accidentally got himself involved in an SG1 mission. Although he managed to screw up just about every step of the way, he still came out the hero. Now, he is back at SGC and working on several weapons projects. When his ""photon torpedo"" malfunctions and knocks out the power, Gen. Hammond is about ready to sack him. The firing is held off for a little bit, though, because he claims to have another weapon for use against the ghouls. He has designed a computer virus to take down the ghoul's gate network. Maj. Carter actually thinks it is a good idea and Hammond assigns her to work with him while the other SG1 members are off planet doing other things. They send the virus and manage to knock out every gate except the one on earth. All the teams are stranded. Hammond is hacked. The geek and Carter have to come up with a fix even though they are not sure where they went wrong. They will have to install the fix deep in enemy territory.Birthright - The SG1 team encounters a group of warrior women. They are priestesses of a particular nasty ghoul who demands that most female children be sacrificed in flames. The high priestess realizes the evil and spirits girl children away whenever she can. She leads a group of these warrior women and clandestinely makes raids to kill jaffa so that their larval ghouls may be stolen. Their race has been altered such that female children who reach puberty and do not receive one of the ghoul larvae die. The SG1 team tries to explain that there is another way. The tritonin drug can be used as an alternative to the symbiote. Some are hopeful of this but many more are suspicious. Most of SG1 are, after all, men. To make matters worse, there are some problems with the trials.Evolution Part 1 - Teal'c and Bray'tac learn of a meeting between two minor ghouls wishing to unite against Ba'al. They head out to investigate but find the Jaffa of both ghouls slaughtered along with one of the ghouls itself. About this time, a strange warrior appears and starts firing. None of their weapons have any effect and it looks like Teal'c is about to buy the farm when the super warrior keels over dead. Investigation of the corpse reveals that it is some type of short lived, genetically engineered warrior and all signs point toward Anubis. They also point towards the fountain of youth, possible precursor to the ghoul sarcophagi. Part of the team heads out to try and capture one the super warriors. That is easier said than done. They other part, led by Daniel Jackson, go in search of the fountain. It looks like they might have found it but they wind up kidnapped by terrorists. So end the cliffhanger.Evolution Part 2 - Col. O'Neill heads off to Central America to rescue Daniel Jackson and the device he may have recovered. He must depend on an old buddy who thinks that he was sold out by the colonel years before. TO make matters worse, the terrorists have been playing with the strange artifact and it is affecting their minds. They are even less stable than they were to begin with. Meanwhile, Maj. Carter, Teal'c and Bray'tac head off to Anubis' home planet to see if they can develop more intel on these super warriors he is producing. It is worse than they feared. He has an entire army of them. The future of humanity would seem to ride on whatever new gadgets the Tok'ra can invent based on the recovered artifact and the developed intel.Grace - The Prometheus is still a long way from home but making its way in short jumps. Maj. Carter heads out to join them on one jump because she wants to examine a nebula. When they emerge near the nebula, they are attacked by a strange ship. They flee into the nebula in the hopes of hiding but when enemy fire hits, the major hits her head and is knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she is the only one on the ship. Everyone else is gone and the gas of the nebula is slowly corroding the ship. She tries to get the ship out of the cloud but she is hampered by not having all of the ship's systems working properly and by the fact that she has a concussion. She is aided by hallucinations of her father and the other members of SG1. What is less clear is the hallucination of the little girl named grace who keeps popping up. She is an unfamiliar figure. She has her work cut out for her rescuing the ship, the rest of the crew and keeping the ship from dissolving while she keeps herself from dying. It's a strange episode and not very satisfying. We never learn much about the aliens who attack except that they seem to keep their word.Fallout - The SGC hears from former member Jonas Quinn. His planet is in trouble. The veins of naquadria on his planet are not stable and neither are they natural. They are reacting and the chain reaction is heading for a deep vein. When it gets to the motherload, the entire planet will be toast. Jonas and Maj. Carter find a way to possibly stave off disaster. They want to set off a nuke on a fault line to shift things around and prevent the reaction from reaching the motherload. To do so will require using a tunneling machine right out of Jules Verne. It also requires the assistance of a hidden ghoul agent. None of this is the hard part, however. The hard part comes for those back at SGC. They are left dealing with the squabbling politicians from the planet over contingency plans to evacuate at least a small number to safety. Saving the planet is easy compared to that.Chimera - This is actually 2 stories combined into one episode. In the first one, Daniel Jackson is having trouble sleeping at night. He keeps dreaming about his former girlfriend, the one who got taken over by Osiris. In his dreams, he is trying to decipher the writing on an artifact. In his waking life, he believes that what he is trying to decipher in his sleep is the key to finding the lost city of the Ancients. It turns out that Osiris is paying him nightly visits and trying to weasel the information out of him. In the other story, Maj. Carter seems to be falling in love with a cop. She is worried because every time she has a boyfriend or kisses someone, that person gets wasted. He is also not cleared to know her real job. He gets suspicious, though, and does some background checking. The two stories come together when he stumbles into an attempt to capture Osiris in the act.Death Knell - Maj. Carter and her father are working at the Alpha site to develop a weapon that will stop Anubis' new super warriors. While there, the base comes under attack from those same soldiers. Many are killed but she gets away. The problem is that one of those super soldiers is tracking her. Now, Col. O'Neill and Teal'c set out to find her first and rescue her. Meanwhile, relation between the Jaffa and the Tok'ra of the base continue to deteriorate due to mutual suspicion. Someone betrayed the secret of the Alpha base. Each group is sure that the other is responsible. They don't trust each other, they don't like each other and the arrogance of each side just makes matters worse. It looks like the fragile alliance is coming to pieces.Heroes Part 1 - The President decides to let someone film what happens at the SGC for ""posterity"". Naturally, the SGC is less than thrilled. In fact, their compliance is the minimum to comply with the letter of the orders given. This leads to a very frustrated film director. In fact, there are only two people who warm up to the camera. One is the slimy senator Lindsey who lies his face off about support for the program and the other is Maj. Carter who just tries to be helpful. There are some things the crew is barred from. One of them is access to ongoing missions. This just increases the director's frustrations, especially when something interesting seems to be going on. SG9 has found an ancient city. The inscriptions indicate that it was built by the ancients. Unfortunately, they run into someone else's probe which takes them under hostile fire. They manage to destroy the thing but not before it gets a message off. Now, SG9 finds itself attacked by Jaffa who arrive by ship. The cliffhanger ending is that we do not know what will happen next. It seems the whole episode was set up to get to this point: an offworld team stranded and under fire.Heroes Part 2 - The rescue mission to retrieve the offworld SG team does not go all that well. Casualties are taken. Lives are lost. This included one of the regulars. This affects everyone. The film director is still not happy about not getting access and makes a bigger nuisance of himself until he is kicked off the base. Everyone assumes he is just going to do a hatchet job anyway. This impression is strengthened when yet another investigation by the ever corrupt NID takes place. This is not a great action episode nor does it do much to advance the story beyond detailing the death of a regular cast member. Instead, it draws attention to true heroism of a type that occurs in the mythical world of SGC or right here on our everyday earth. Bravo.Resurrection - The rogue NID agents are at it again. The ""good"" NID agent finds a warehouse with lots of slaughtered people, a helpless girl and an evil scientist. According to the video tapes, the sweet girl killed al the people but when SG1 arrives, she just wants to go back to her cage. They also find a basement full of artifacts. One of the artifacts turns out to be a naquida bomb and its set to go off very soon. The girl turns out to be an experiment to splice ghoul and human genes. The hope was to retrieve some of the racial memory of the ghouls. Now, the race is on to disarm the bomb but the girl cannot control when she acts as the ghoul and when she acts as the innocent. The key lies with the evil scientist.Inauguration - A new president has been inaugurated. One of the first things that happens is a briefing from the joint chiefs about the Stargate project. He can hardly believe what he hears but more is to come. The slimy senator Lindsey is now the vice president. He is pushing to have the Stargate program stripped from the military and given to the NID. He wants this because he virtually controls the NID. Most of the episode is a debate between the Vice President's hatchet man and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. It is a retrospective episode consisting mostly of old footage.Lost City - Daniel Jackson finds a clue as to the location of the Lost City of the Ancients. He wants to take the SG1 team to a planet with one of the strange mind devices such as was encountered in the first season. At that time, the machine downloaded information into Col. O'Neill's head and slowly began to overwrite his own mind. The plan this time is to bring one of the machines back. While there, the planet comes under attack from Anubis who pursues the same information. In order to keep the information from falling into Anubis' hands, Col. O'Neill sticks his head into the device (They are one shot deals). They flee back through the Stargate to home in the hope that as the memories manifest, they will find the answers they seek. Back at home, however, major changes have taken place. Gen. Hammond has been replaced with a civilian and the slimy vice president is eager get rid of them all. Just to keep things interesting, Bray'tac arrives with the news that Anubis is on his way to earth with a fleet. The VP thinks it is just a plot so that SG1 can keep their jobs but it is real. The fleet shows up but SG1 has gone off to find the planet. What they find is unexpected and they have to get back to earth to prevent its complete destruction. It's a race against time and they just make it to their goal. Anubis has the same goal and the Col. Is running out of time as well.",4,Changing Administrations,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,18433,"['season', 'good', 'episodes', 'mostly', 'not', 'up', 'same', 'standard', 'middle', 'seasons', 'are',

IMO, all the other episodes a good (maybe except Space Race) but these four episodes here make me almost want to call this my favorite season. Daniel's back, which most fans might take as a positive note, and Anubis is brought up front and center as the baddest guy in the series' history.The Lost City, as I said before, is want shines the most in this set. Originaly planned as a feature film movie after season six, it was slightly transformed into a series finale after the renewal. But then StarGate got renewed again, so again they tweaked it once more, making it a cliffhanger. Many other episodes make the set worth the money, especially the two-part opener, Heroes, Orpheus, and Birthright.I would recommend this set to anyone who liked any of the first six seasons.

177208,AA3UIRH39FZ7P,1424819237,"J. Sheldon ""falcon710""","[12, 15]","Season 7 is the first season to be produced under the ownership of the Sci-Fi Channel.  There are some changes in the show, some related and some unrelated to this change in ownership.First and foremost, Col. Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) has a reduced role on the show (this was at his own request - he wished to spend more time with his daughter).  Because of this, Carter, Teal'C, and Daniel Jackson (who returns in the first episdoe of the season) have to pick up the slack.  Each of them do, with episodes that are more character driven than in the past.  Also, the return of Dr. Jackson means the departure of Jonas Quinn (Corin Nemec) back to his home planet.  Those who were fans of Jonas might be disappointed, but he does make a guest appearance later in the season (I'm sure the numerous Jackson fans are excited about his return, however).There is also less use of the Stargate than in past seasons.  Most episodes in the past would focus on SG-1 traveling to another planet in order to assist the indigenous populace or fight the Goa'uld.  In this season, the team stays on Earth much more often, with episodes that deal with the individual characters or the uncovering of political plots against the program.

177216,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1424819237,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[108, 116]","Looking back on the seventh season of ""Stargate SG-1"" it seems clear that the show was caught between the idea that this was the final season and an impulse to retool the series to keep in going into an eighth season.  In short, I think if they knew then what they know now they would have done things differently, especially with the question of Richard Dean Anderson's status for season nine.  When the new president made Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Jessica Steen) the new civilian head of the Stargate project that had a lot of interesting possibilities, both because of her gender and because she had an extensive background in diplomatic negotiations.  But the two-part ""Lost City"" that ends this season becomes more about stopping Anubis from destroying the Earth than retooling the show and Weir is going to end up on ""Stargate: Atlantis"" (to be played by Torri Higginson).  There is a lot that happens in those last three episodes, when President Hayes (William Devane) takes office and Anubis attacks, with the potential for more all sorts of interesting ramifications, more so than with what happens when the season starts.That is when Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) returns from being an ascended being, albeit on an alien world without his memory (""Fallen"").  This required getting rid of Jonas Quinn (Corin Nemec) to get the old gang back together again, which happens when Anubis download Jonas' memory and the Goa'uld attack Kelowna (""Homecoming"").  Wisely, this is not the last appearance of Jonas for the season (""Fallout"") as he becomes another one of recurring guest characters that are a major strength of the series.  There are several Daniel Jackson stories that make a point of giving the actor interesting things to do, such as ""Lifeboat,"" where his mind becomes a resting place for a bunch of alien minds, ""Enemy Mine,"" which requires Jackson to show diplomatic skills, and big time flashbacks in ""Chimera,"" to before Daniel first saw the Stargate.  Overall, Jackson comes running to the rescue more often than any other character during this season (e.g., ""Resurrection"").I understand now that Anderson had a reduced workload for Season 7 of ""Stargate SG-1,"" and there are some interesting attempts to make the best of that situation, as when O'Neill is transformed into a teenage boy (""Fragile Balance"").  For the most part the main tactic is to make O'Neill a supporting character and let the other characters do the heavy lifting.  But when I look over the 21 episodes for the season it becomes clear that Teal'c (Christopher Judge) is primarily a supporting player for the year as well, with ""Orpheus"" and ""Birthright"" being the only episodes to really focus on Teal'c.  You do have to admit, that nobody on the show milks a stare better than the big fella.Overall, Season 7 is really Samantha Carter's season and Amanda Tapping has several episodes where she pretty much goes it alone.  ""Space Race"" has her joining an alien pilot for a little intergalactic competition, while ""Death Knell"" finds Carter being hunted by the supers soldiers of Anubis after an attack on Earth's secret off-world base.  In ""Grace"" Carter literally ends up alone when the Prometheus is attacked and she wakes up to find herself the only one on a ship drifting in deep space.  The other characters show up as the angels of her better nature, which is the only way that Sam and Jack are ever going to have an honest conversation.  She even has an actual boyfriend for an episode ""Chimera,"" in a concerted effort to get rid of the ""black widow"" label that has plagued Carter.  The unrequited love between Carter and O'Neill is pitch perfect, so just let them keep their unspoken thoughts and give this woman a social life.  Of course we have to take this to an extreme and that would be the fantasies of Jay Felger (""Avenger 2.0"").The whole Anubis/Lost City bit ends up being equal parts time to beat another bigger and badder system lord and find a fitting end point for the series that can also work as a transition to the spinoff.  In your free time you can speculate as to what they would have done differently knowing that there was going to be an eighth season of ""Stargate SG-1,"" but I have to think there would have been some significant changes that would not have wrapped up things so quickly and conveniently.  Besides, having read my Dante I have been patiently waiting for Robert Kinsey (Ronny Cox) to receive his comeuppance, and with everything that was happening in those final episodes that was a notable anticlimax.The two main tensions in Season 7 are between the need to keep coming up with a bigger threat for SG-1 to face and the desire to keep the characters real.  The former is represented by the super soldiers engineered by Anubis (""Evolution, Part 1"") and Kinsey becoming Vice President (""Inauguration""), while the latter is at the heart of the two-part ""Heroes,"" when reporter Emmett Bregman (Saul Rubinke) shows up at Cheyenne Mountain to document the Stargate project for some future posterity.  The episode underscores the dangers inherent in what Stargate does, an idea which is revitalized by having the off-world focus being on SG-13, led by Colonel Dave Dixon (Adam Baldwin).  The subtext for the episode is honoring the unsung heroes of the American military in the real world, and it certainly accomplished that goal and the performances are particularly memorable.  Of course, the cast is given ample motivation given the script and the episode's emotional payoff.While ""Stargate SG-1, Season 7"" is one of the weaker seasons for the series, it is still a pretty good science fiction show on a par with ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""Farscape.""  The common denominator, of course, is that the best stories are character driven and not just dressed up by computer-generated special effects.  Part of the problem at this point is that the characters are so comfortable with each other that pushing them to new levels becomes extremely difficult.  But at least with ""Heroes,"" they proved that SG-1 can still make the effort and meet the challenge.",4,"Daniel Jackson returns for the 7th season of ""Stargate SG-1""",1103673600,"12 22,

We've got amazon women (Xena: Warrior Princess); a faceless arch villian in black robes with a clone army (Hmmmmm...familiar?); a space ship with shields that degrade by percentages (oh yeah!); jounalists visiting to shoot a documentary (done by Babylon 5 but done at least as well by Stargate SG-1 this season); and government intrigue in high places (sort of like X Files).  But it's all well done and fun to watch.2. Great guest stars who were leading characters on Star Trek Voyager, Enterprise, Firefly, and even the Red Green Show!  (No spoilers here for those who haven't watched this season yet.)3. Several instances of that self-effacing humor that seem so unique to Stargate SG-1.4. Many episodes that continued stories started by episodes perhaps years in the past.  It sure pays to watch this series in chronological order.  It's getting like Babylon 5 was, with many stories happening within the overall story.  Much attention is payed to continuity, and that isn't lossed on me at all.5.

177225,AG42CYU5P8NVQ,1424819237,Mathew A. Shember,"[3, 4]","It's interesting to read other reviews.  Some people don't like this season or a lukewarm about it.  I still liked it.  With any series, there are great episodes and not so great.  Overall I have yet to say this is stupid and change the station.This season returns Daniel Jackson to the fold and has Anubis become the major threat of the system lords.DVD 1: Fallen - Here we have Jonas thinking he may have found the lost city.  They check it out and find Daniel Jackson living with the people of the world.  Why is he there?  He doesn't know.  His memory slowly returns and Jonas is captured by Anubis.  We also get to see the new 302 fighter.Homecoming - Anubis sticks a probe in Jonas' head and learns about Naquadria.  He has to have it.  It's a race to save Jonas' planet as SG1 tries to recover Daniel and Jonas who are on Anubis' ship.  To get help, they try to make deals with Yu and Baal.Fragile Balance - This was kind of a fun little ""what the?"" story where a teenager shows up claiming to be Jack O'Neill.  He talks like him and has the same expressions, etc.  He is shown to be a clone and the question is why and what happened to the real Jack O'Neill?  I kind of liked this story and say the kid did a good job in his role.Orpheus - The first lesson of not having a symbiant.  Teal'c is wounded and starts to doubt his abilities.  Jackson gets visions of Bray'tac and Rayac being in danger.  They figure out where they are located and of course decided a rescue.DVD 2: Revisions - A lesson in environmental destruction; the world is supposedly dead but a force field is noticed.  Thinking it might be useful as they are always in search of alien technology; they check it out.  To their surprise they find a community unaffected by what's outside the shields.  It's kind of a utopian ""borg"" setup as they are all linked together to a central computer that protects them.  Or so they think.  SG1 notices something's up when people disappear and the people don't believe they ever existed.Lifeboat - A crashed ship on a planet presents hundreds of people cryogenically stored.  Everybody passes out and wake up to find Daniel Jackson has a case of multiple personalities.  Hmmm everything seems to happen to him.  And interesting story and it has a sad moment involving a father and son.Enemy Mine - Now this was a story I liked.  We get to see a planet with an Unas tribe who stand in the way of a nice supply of Naquadria.  Chaka returns to help Daniel negotiate with the Unas tribe but of course problems arise as Unas and people begin o die.I started liking the Unas after this.....Space Race - This one kind of made me go ""oookay?""  The prisoner transport captain from last season returns and asks Carter to help him win a race.  Carter thinks it's a simple race but later learns you can easily die in it.  There is also a side story that deals with racism.  The human culture and the Captains people have intermingled.  Some don't like it.....DVD 3: Avenger 2.0 - The Geek scientist Dr. Felger returns.  He now works on weapons at the SGC and one weapon knocks out the power of the SGC.  He is about to get fired but talks he way out by saying he has a weapon that will work.  His weapon is a computer virus designed to attack Baal's stargates.  But the unexpected happens.  All Stargates are knocked offline.  He has to work with his dream girl Carter to save the day.Birthright - Bring on the Amazons.  SG1 finds women Jaffa warriors.  Of course they don't like men.  Teal'c finds a possible love interest who is played Jolene Blalock (T'Pol from Enterprise).  SG1 tries to show them tritonan but of course problems happen when some of the warriors die while testing it.Evolution Part 1 - Enter the super soldiers.  Teal'c and Bray'tac investigate a rumor about two minor Goa'ulds teaming up to fight Baal.  They find them and their Jaffa warriors slaughtered by one soldier!  He is immune to bullets, bombs and staff blasts oh my!A side story involves Daniel Jackson who heads to Central America to look for a power source that might the reason for the legend of the fountain of youth.  He is kidnapped by anti-government rebels.Evolution Part 2 - Col. O'Neill heads off to Honduras to rescue Daniel Jackson.  He run's into a past screw-up named Burke played by Enrico Colantoni (Elliot from just shoot me).  Burke is a great wise cracking sidekick who make not be a screw-up after all.The story of the super soldiers continues as carter, Teal'c, Bray'tac, and Carter's father head off to Anubis's planet to gather intel on the super soldiers.DVD 4: Grace - Carter and the crew of the Prometheus head off to examine a nebula.  They are attacked by an unknown ship and run into the Nebula to escape the more powerful ship.  Carter is injured and wakes up to find she is alone on the ship except for a little girl.  Is she a hallucination?  She has others that involve her father and SG1.  But; who is this little girl?The story is another ""what?"" story and we never learn the identity of the aliens.  I thought it might be an introduction of the Furlings.Fallout - Jonas Quinn returns asking for help as Naquadria is about to destroy his planet.  Naquadria is not natural to the planet and a vein of it is about to explode.  Enter a tunnel machine and a race to the center of the planet to avert the disaster.  We get a spy from Baal who has different plans.The fun part of episode is watching Jack deal with squabbling politicians!Chimera - Daniel Jackson is having bad dreams involving Osiris and Carter finds love.  But does she want it as any man she dates; dies.  The man is a cop and starts to follow Carter as he gets suspicious over her hesitation.Death Knell - Maj. Carter and her father are working to develop a weapon that will stop Anubis' new super warriors.  Her father is in a foul mood and leans he gives up coffee because Selmac doesn't like it.  ;)  The base is attacked and Carter finds her self being tracked by a super soldier.Meanwhile the Tok'ra and the Jaffa are at odds.  Old grudges arise.  Will the Alliance stay together?Heroes Part 1 - SGC gets a documentary team filming their activities.  The director gets frustrated by the less then helpful SGC.  Especially Jack.  A team goes off world to explore a possible city of the Ancients and is visited by a strange probe.  They destroy it but it gets a message off.  The Jaffa attack.DVD 5: Heroes Part 2 - A rescue is attempted and casualties mount.  A regular of the SGC perishes.  The documentary director is still causing problems and eventually gets tossed but later shows he does a good job.Another Meh episode that really served no purpose to the story line except to exit a character.Resurrection - The evil NID agents are back.  We get a warehouse with many dead bodies and a helpless girl.  Who did the killing and why?Inauguration - A new president appears and is stunned to learn about Stargate.  This episode is mainly old footage as the story is told.Lost City - Daniel Jackson thinks he found the lost city of the ancients.  They investigate and find one of the knowledge libraries of the ancients.  Jack of course gets himself loaded up again.  Anubis appears and it is later learned that he will attack earth.  Hammond is replaced, O'Neill's mind is being changed and Anubis is about to attack Earth.All in all; it was an ok season.  However, I did get the feeling Jack was going to begin to fade away from the series.",5,Daniel Jackson returns and Anubis attacks!,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",2006,7432,"['interesting', 'read', 'other',

The only thing I really appreciated was the way the writers finally dumped the ""shippy"" fantasy. Thank the lord.

A simple remedy would have been to actually show her talking with and being taught by the different alien cultures instead of espionage, infiltration, ground assualt, combat expert, geneticist, and etc.  They needed to replace her with someone believable, who can act, she doesn't even pass as an egghead.  I watched the show with my spouse and without prompting(we weren't discussing the show) while Amanda tapping was saying something I heard ""She's not even believable, she doesn't make an impression.  Especially when she's trying to be authoritative it just doesn't come across.  How does a egghead have time to train for all of that ?  Not enough hours in a day to be that profiecient in so many areas, it would be different if she could act.""Nailed it on the head.  They also went into how Tealc should be more informative and helpful but they just portray him as a butler.  He should be way more familiar with the language, history and weapons.  He uses the weapons and etc as 1st prime, would have been taught the history of the Goa'uld served.  If they are to serve them as Gods wouldn't they use stories of past conquests as propaganda to further the subjugation of the populace ?  Anyway they screwed the pooch on this show they had so many opportunities to get it right and make it a classic.  But you can tell by the dialog contract negotiations got in the way and people were required to get xx amount of lines and or facetime.  Because most of the conversations sound pretty ^^^^^^^ stupid and overly contrived.Also micheal shank's ego needed checking he was pbarely passable and talked too much when the dialog should have been coming from someone else.",1,"I agree, it's just getting worse and worse",1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,2319,"['shame', 'times', 'really', 'got', 'things', 'right', 'handful', 'episodes', 'unas', 'episodes', 'Amanda', 'tapping', 'really', 'series', 'new', 'low', 'got', 'rid', 'season', '4', 'replaced', 'someone', 'decent', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'chance', 'character', 'introduced', 'theoretical', 'astrophysicist', 'yet', 'expert', 'alien', 'technology', 'fairly', 'quickily', 'help', 'integrity', 'show', 'considering', 'things', 'suppose', 'have', 'done', 'series', 'little', 'six', 'years', 'was', 'so', 'easy', 'why', ""n't"", 'earth', 'further', 'along', 'technologically', 'withing', 'setting', 'simple', 'remedy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'actually', 'show', 'talking', 'being', 'taught', 'different', 'alien', 'cultures', 'instead', 'espionage', 'infiltration', 'ground', 'assualt', 'combat', 'expert', 'geneticist', 'etc', 'needed', 'replace', 'someone', 'believable', 'who', 'can', 'act', ""n't"", 'even', 'pass', 'egghead', 'watched', 'show', 'spouse', 'prompting', 'were', ""n't"", 'discussing', 'show', 'Amanda', 'tapping', 'was', 'saying', 'something', 'heard', 'not', 'even', 'believable', ""n't"", 'make', 'impression', 'Especially', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'authoritative', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'How', 'egghead', 'have', 'time', 'train', 'Not', 'enough', 'hours', 'day', 'be', 'profiecient', 'so', 'many', 'areas', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'could', 'act', 'Nailed', 'head', 'also', 'went', 'how', 'Tealc', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'informative', 'helpful', 'just', 'portray', 'butler', 'should', 'be', 'way', 'more', 'familiar', 'language', 'history', 'weapons', 'weapons', 'etc', '1st', 'prime', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'history', ""Goa'uld"", 'served', 'are', 'serve', 'Gods', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'stories', 'past', 'conquests', 'propaganda', 'further', 'subjugation', 'populace', 'Anyway', 'screwed', 'pooch', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'opportunities', 'get', 'right', 'make', 'classic', 'can', 'tell', 'dialog', 'contract', 'negotiations', 'got', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'required', 'get', 'xx', 'amount', 'lines', 'facetime', 'most', 'conversations', 'sound', 'pretty', '^^^^^^^', 'stupid', 'overly', 'contrived.Also', 'micheal', 'shank', 'ego', 'needed', 'checking', 'was', 'pbarely', 'passable', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'dialog', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'someone', 'else']",N/A

Barnes ""Science Fiction and Music Collector""","[20, 26]","This seemed to be the year of a bit more ""reality"" to the series and more personal character development as noted by many other reviewers. Many reviews are split between ""I want shoot em up action"" and the ones who wish to get a total view of the characters and the storyline as a wholeReality says for over 7 years, this has been a secret from the world, (which is a stretch) and we touched the surface as far as the interactions of Politics, with the President being a person being on the other end of the red phone. With the addition of William Devane to counter Ronny Cox, this series has added two excellent accomplished actors and a more defined storyline in which the previous seasons only touched the surface.""Heroes"" is one of my all time favorites. While the death of Dr. Frasier saddened me (one of my favorite characters), how long can this series go on with its endless battles and no major character dies? The change in General Hammond in ""Lost City"" I liked, since in the real world few commanders stay on their command that long. He also is a favorite character, and his new ""job"" I think broadens his influence and inserts him into a more active roll.""Lost City"" is very close to being a favorite Sci Fi Episode of any series. The special effects that we take for granted on a Televison show exceeds that of many movies, the the acceleration in the action and the battle scenes is spectacular. I watched it twice in one day!Great series such as the Star Trek shows, (""Deep Space Nine"", Voyager"") and Roddenberry's ""Andromeda"" excelled at mixing character development with true Sci Fi action and marked the success of those series, and it is true here. While I wish to see more of Richard Dean Anderson, I welcome the focus on others as well. Its true that this was the year for Colonel Carter, and I just hope they keep a mix of action as well.Overall, I rate this as 5 star, with ""Heroes"" and ""Lost City"" being some of the best episodes ever in this genre. How can they top these?

177238,A16QODENBJVUI1,1424819237,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","Seasons One through Five were remarkably uniform, each season introducing new characters and developing storylines, but not really bringing about much in the way of major changes.  Season Six was different because of the single-season departure of Michael Shanks.  But Season Seven is the season where things were, as Elvis would say, all shook up.For many fans the most painful moment in the season was the shocking and unanticipated death of Dr. Janet Fraiser, played by Teryl Rothery.  Along with Tony Amendola (Master Bra'tac) and Carmen Argenziano (Jacob Carter/Selmak), Rothery was the most important non-opening credits actor in the entire run of the show, appearing prominently in several dozen episodes.  She has been an extraordinarily busy actress, showing up on virtually every show ever made in Vancouver (off the top of my head I remember her in episodes of DEAD LIKE ME, THE X-FILES, and SMALLVILLE), but the show she is most closely identified with is STARGATE SG-1.  Her death outraged and disturbed a host of fans.  The most I can say about her death is that it helped correct one of the great shortcomings of STARGATE:  how safe the characters all were.  One of the things that BUFFY brought to genre television was the practice of making the world unsafe for characters.  The moment when Angelus breaks Jenny Calendar's neck was one of the most shocking scenes I had ever seen.  Until then, all major characters on all shows were more or less protected and safe.  There over a dozen major deaths in BUFFY and ANGEL, and many fantasy and Sci-fi shows followed its example.  Shows are simply more compelling when there is a real threat that major characters will die, and the very best shows are not afraid to have a body count (witness Season Two of VERONICA MARS).The death of Dr. Fraiser was hardly the only change.  Michael Shanks's Daniel Jackson returned to the show, necessitating the departure of Corin Nemec.  Plot wise, we witness a major change as General Hammond is relieved of his command of SGC (though he has never quite left the series entirely).  Don Davis's departure is understandable.  In fact, as the series headed into its 8th season it was remarkable that so few major characters had left the show.  Filming a series is a grueling affair and it is astonishing that so few performers had burned out.  Michael Shanks left for one year but returned.  Don Davis left as a full time performer.  And Richard Dean Anderson would start reducing his involvement in the show.  In this way, Season Seven can be seen as part of a trend that has continued.Personally, I think the changes have been great for the show.  Though it never quite started to feel stale, there had been a bit of sameness to the show that didn't help make it as good as it could be.  Compared to some of the very best shows on TV (BUFFY, FARSCAPE, LOST, ANGEL, 24, or even SMALLVILLE) STARGATE had far less character and narrative development.  But Season Seven started changing that.The season ended with some major narrative changes as well.  The alliance between the SGC and the Tok'ra became strained and threatened to collapse.  And after multiple hints through the season that there was a great city of the Ancients that contained technology that would help them defend earth, it was discovered that this city was none other than Atlantis, leading not just to a thrilling season finale but to a spin off series.All in all, this was yet another strong season in one of the most consistently excellent Sci-fi series we have seen, and certainly the longest lived.",5,A season that brings multiple major changes to Stargate Command,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,3569,"['Seasons', 'One', 'Five', 'were', 'remarkably', 'uniform', 'season', 'introducing', 'new', 'characters', 'developing', 'storylines', 'not', 'really', 'bringing', 'about', 'much', 'way', 'major', 'changes', 'Season', 'Six', 'was', 'different', 'single-season', 'departure', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'Season', 'Seven', 'season', 'where', 'things', 'were', 'Elvis', 'would', 'say', 'shook', 'up.For', 'many', 'fans', 'most', 'painful', 'moment', 'season', 'was', 'shocking', 'unanticipated', 'death', 'Dr.', 'Janet', 'Fraiser', 'played', 'Teryl', 'Rothery', 'Tony', 'Amendola', 'Master', ""Bra'tac"", 'Carmen', 'Argenziano', 'Jacob', 'Carter/Selmak', 'Rothery', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'non-opening', 'credits', 'actor', 'entire', 'run', 'show', 'appearing', 'prominently', 'several', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'been', 'extraordinarily', 'busy', 'actress', 'showing', 'up', 'virtually', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'Vancouver', 'top', 'head', 'remember', 'episodes', 'DEAD', 'LIKE', 'ME', 'THE', 'X-FILES', 'SMALLVILLE', 'show', 'most', 'closely', 'identified', 'STARGATE', 'SG-1', 'death', 'outraged', 'disturbed', 'host', 'fans', 'most', 'can', 'say', 'death', 'helped', 'correct', 'one', 'great', 'shortcomings', 'STARGATE', 'how', 'safe', 'characters', 'were', 'One', 'things', 'BUFFY', 'brought', 'genre', 'television', 'was', 'practice', 'making', 'world', 'unsafe', 'characters', 'moment', 'when', 'Angelus', 'Jenny', 'Calendar', 'neck', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'then', 'major', 'characters', 'shows', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'protected', 'safe', 'dozen', 'major', 'deaths', 'BUFFY', 'ANGEL', 'many', 'fantasy', 'Sci-fi', 'shows', 'followed', 'example', 'Shows', 'are', 'simply', 'more', 'compelling', 'when', 'real', 'threat', 'major', 'characters', 'will', 'die', 'very', 'best', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'have', 'body', 'count', 'witness', 'Season', 'Two', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', '.The', 'death', 'Dr.', 'Fraiser', 'was', 'hardly', 'only', 'change', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'returned', 'show', 'necessitating', 'departure', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'Plot', 'wise', 'witness', 'major', 'change', 'General', 'Hammond', 'relieved', 'command', 'SGC', 'never', 'quite', 'left', 'series', 'entirely', 'Don', 'Davis', 'departure', 'understandable', 'fact', 'series', 'headed', '8th', 'season', 'was', 'remarkable', 'so', 'few', 'major', 'characters', 'had', 'left', 'show', 'Filming', 'series', 'grueling', 'affair', 'astonishing', 'so', 'few', 'performers', 'had', 'burned', 'out', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'left', 'one', 'year', 'returned', 'Don', 'Davis', 'left', 'full', 'time', 'performer', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'would', 'start', 'reducing', 'involvement', 'show', 'way', 'Season', 'Seven', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'part', 'trend', 'continued.Personally', 'think', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'show', 'never', 'quite', 'started', 'feel', 'stale', 'had', 'been', 'bit', 'sameness', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'Compared', 'very', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'BUFFY', 'FARSCAPE', 'LOST', 'ANGEL', '24', 'even', 'SMALLVILLE', 'STARGATE', 'had', 'far', 'less', 'character', 'narrative', 'development', 'Season', 'Seven', 'started', 'changing', 'that.The', 'season', 'ended', 'major', 'narrative', 'changes', 'as', 'well', 'alliance', 'SGC', ""Tok'ra"", 'became', 'strained', 'threatened', 'collapse', 'multiple', 'hints', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'city', 'Ancients', 'contained', 'technology', 'would', 'help', 'defend', 'earth', 'was', 'discovered', 'city', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Atlantis', 'leading', 'not', 'just', 'thrilling', 'season', 'finale', 'spin', 'off', 'series.All', 'was', 'yet', 'strong', 'season', 'one', 'most', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'Sci-fi', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'certainly', 'longest', 'lived']",N/A

177243,A2VUOO5RVB78A7,1424819237,Stephanie Sandlin,"[8, 17]","Stargate SG1 during the Showtime years had excellent moments. Especially early on. Even through some changes (S4/S5) it was still pretty good. Heck, even S6 with Jonas was still watchable.Season 7 though is a whole different matter. Gone is the team element in many episodes. Gone is O'Neill as a main character. In many shows the Stargate is gone too. Gone are the stories and actor chemistry which made the show such powerhouse to begin with.  Instead, we see more ""personalization"" of the characters. We see Teal'c get some nooky with T'Pol, Carter get shagged by Pete. Oh yes, and we see the newly reannointed, buffed and tanned Dr Jackson show how great of actor he is by playing host to dozens of people in lifeboat. It is fair to note Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson)plays his character now very differently as opposed to the early years. We now have arrogant uberstud Daniel as opposed to passionate archeologist Daniel with a heart.They should've never allowed Shanks back. Jonas in S6 allowed for some new depth of characters. Thanks vocal Shanks fans - part of this trainwreck S7 and onwards is on you. The whole write Shanks out/bring him back has caused a laughably convoluded story arc. How many times now has Daniel died/ascended now?!? (as of 3/22/05)Bottom line of this review the show is a hollow shell of itself. The stories used to be central element of the show with menacing big bad guys about to annihilate the earth and the team going and saving us again. We also used to see new worlds and peoples through the gate. Making friends and allies to defend ourselves(what a concept huh?). Now, we're reduced to Carter humming the Stargate theme music while she avoids talking to Jack about her boytoy Pete.  That ain't Stargate folks. That's As the Gate Turns.  The whole Sam girly girl relationship thing with either O'Neill or *insert character* she's had a thing for - its been a distraction and ruined some of the high quality storylines of the show.Memo to TPTB - Get back to what made the show great. You've obviously lost your way.Best moments of S7:Fragile Balance  (Asguard create a mini O'Neill)Avenger 2.0  (Felger Part Two)The Lost City Pt. 1/2 (Rare good action episode during S7)Worst Moments of S7:Space Race (Duh - annoying alien announcers - stupid plot)Grace  (Sam's Daddy/Jack issues while trying to notget killed by a Romulan Warbird ep. *BARF*)Birthright (Teal'c gets nooky and pals around with  Amazon jaffawomen. One word - cliche!)Chimera  (Sam's sex life again - Who cares?!?)Heroes  (Killing off Dr Fraiser *shakes head*)Resurrection (NID AGAIN for the 100th time - this time hybrids!)This is not a great season. Nowhere near it.  If you like the excellent quality of the early years.  You will find only a few episodes of this season worthy of purchase.BTW - anyone who can call this season the greatest SG1 season just stuns me. If you like the dumbed down personal life on display SG1 rather than great stories and Scifi. I have an idea: coming in S9 Sam decorates her house.

I really liked how the writers gave the cast a chance to showcase another dimension of their acting skills.  The supporting characters were all quite good, and the writing was pretty decent as well.  Episodes like this are one of the many reasons that this delightful show ran for ten enjoyable seasons.  I'd have liked to see Adam Baldwin appear in a more permanent role in the show, or maybe in Atlantis.  All in all, a good war movie-esque story, with complex and multidimensional characters.

Keep it up, guys.If I could name season 7, I would call it ""Transitions"" for how some of the themes that began developing back in season 5 finally come to a closure, and the SG-1 team begins moving on to other things - just like the way things happen to ordinary people.  The finale, which features an Earth-threatening attack by Anubis is also a beginning for the new Stargate Atlantis series, and a transition for both Col. O'Neill and Gen. Hammond.  The return of Daniel is not really a return, since he was there all along, and the departure of Jonas is not a departure - both are transitions for both the characters and the SG-1 team.  The team also becomes increasingly wrapped up in the search for Atlantis, and what it could mean for their growing conflict with Anubis.  There are other transitions to speak of, but I don't want to spoil the season for you, in case you haven't seen it already.  I rate season 7 as one of the better Stargate seasons that have been made, but I haven't made up my mind over whether it is, in fact, the best.The DVDs also have featurettes on both the characters and the production of the show itself.

This season is great, with groundbreaking visual effects and wonderful acting. I was very happy to see several one-off episodes at the start of the season. Anubis just gets better and better. Lost City was an outstanding episode-though it took me until my second time to realize how great it was because I saw the eight season premiere before I saw this two-parter, and Dr.Weir is played by someone else in that episode, so I sat through the entire episode trying to figure out why they would do that. Oh well...The battle over Antarctica is great-one of the best battles in Stargate history. I recommend this set to anyone curious about the show or a big fan of the series.
