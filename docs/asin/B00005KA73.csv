Certainly Brando's ""On the Waterfront"" had as much impact on society and labor-management relations as any single film made. ""Victory at Sea"" and Ken Burns latest series ""The War"" are also superb presentations but factual. ""Shoah"" is best series on the Holocaust.Harlan County War shows a battle that was bitterly fought and finally resolved. The union gave it but its tactics forced concessions from DukePower Co. and other firms.  There is a movie about Hormel strike in MN involving Spam.  Tactics used there were timid and there was no tie-inplot.  ""Norma Rae"" a great film comes close yet her 'solo' effort with the union organizer loses a bit of the big picture.Holly Hunter can't be held down once she sees her father die from black lung disease and her husband laid off, along with scores of others. Thecompany's spy and goon tactics were revealing and true.  ""Hoffa"" shows some of these.  Harlan County War involves a whole community, united ina solo cause. When only three men can picket the mine entrance, women and their children lie on the roads. When some miners' homes are bulldozed and others vandalized, all stick together.  Community cohesiveness isoutstanding.  The plot and acting are superb. So is the photography and direction. And when there is a final cruel act near the film's end, even the company recognizes some concessions must be made. Then the miners go back to eating coal dust while performing back-breaking work. The filmhas a beginning, middle and ending, although the solution to one problem leads to another.  Family respect is shown clearly: This is something vastly lacking today.I rate this film 5*****. I have not seen a better one of its ilk.I will watch it again and can share my copy.doctorkorganizer",5,Best :Labor Documentary with Moving Plot: Fine Acting,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,1841,"['have', 'seen', 'countless', 'movies', 'are', 'total', 'documentary', 'based', 'facts', 'true', 'events', 'Certainly', 'Brando', 'Waterfront', 'had', 'much', 'impact', 'society', 'labor-management', 'relations', 'single', 'film', 'made', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'latest', 'series', 'War', 'are', 'also', 'superb', 'presentations', 'factual', 'Shoah', 'best', 'series', 'Holocaust.Harlan', 'County', 'War', 'battle', 'was', 'bitterly', 'fought', 'finally', 'resolved', 'union', 'gave', 'tactics', 'forced', 'concessions', 'DukePower', 'Co.', 'other', 'firms', 'movie', 'Hormel', 'strike', 'MN', 'involving', 'Spam', 'Tactics', 'used', 'were', 'timid', 'was', 'tie-inplot', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'great', 'film', 'close', 'yet', ""'solo"", 'effort', 'union', 'organizer', 'bit', 'big', 'picture.Holly', 'Hunter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'held', 'down', 'once', 'father', 'die', 'black', 'lung', 'disease', 'husband', 'laid', 'off', 'scores', 'others', 'Thecompany', 'spy', 'goon', 'tactics', 'were', 'revealing', 'true', 'Hoffa', 'Harlan', 'County', 'War', 'whole', 'community', 'united', 'ina', 'solo', 'cause', 'When', 'only', 'three', 'men', 'can', 'picket', 'mine', 'entrance', 'women', 'children', 'lie', 'roads', 'When', 'miners', 'homes', 'are', 'bulldozed', 'others', 'vandalized', 'stick', 'together', 'Community', 'cohesiveness', 'isoutstanding', 'plot', 'acting', 'are', 'superb', 'photography', 'direction', 'when', 'final', 'cruel', 'act', 'film', 'end', 'even', 'company', 'concessions', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Then', 'miners', 'go', 'back', 'eating', 'coal', 'dust', 'performing', 'back-breaking', 'work', 'filmhas', 'beginning', 'middle', 'ending', 'solution', 'one', 'problem', 'Family', 'respect', 'shown', 'clearly', 'something', 'vastly', 'lacking', 'today.I', 'rate', 'film', '5*****', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'better', 'one', 'ilk.I', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'can', 'share', 'copy.doctorkorganizer']",N/A

Holly Hunter and Ted Levine are the main characters. Ted is the miner/husband/father Silas Kincaide and Holly is the wife/mom Ruby Kincaide. Stellar Skarsgard plays Warren Jacopovich, UMWA organizer. His character is loosely-based on Paul Jablonsky, a real UMWA organizer, who was murdered, along with his wife and daughter, by company-hired assassin.The accents, expressions, and portrayals are very accurate.

661359,A2X25C107CSLOR,B00005KA73,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[5, 6]","This Showtime TVM directed by Tony Bill is reminiscent of Norma Rae, with a dash of the Jane Fonda The Dollmaker. Set in Kentucky in 1973, it tells the true story of the Brookside coal miners strike over the Duke Power company's refusal to agree to a union contract. When managment fires the male workers, it is the wives who form a &quot;women's club&quot; to populate the picket line, to bypass the legal trespassing injunction signed against the men, using the constitutional freedom to gather for their meetings as a defence. Strikes with picket lines are always demonstrations of strategy and whilst the intial psychological one-upman ship is interesting, the length of the strike and the accumulative frustration and anger of both parties leads to more violent confrontations. These confrontations, particularly a climactic act, show the moral complications that such activities create - does one action justify a response, or a response of greater ugliness? What is notable about the teleplay by Peter Silverman is the representation of the strike action as only part of the lives of these people, without diminishing their commitment to the cause, and the insight that when the strike is inevitably over that the inhabitants of the county will have to continue working and living together harmoniously. Silverman also uses Holly Hunter as the leader of the women's club as an example of how uneducated people still have common sense. Bill however disappoints with his cliched presentation of noble hillbilly's filmed in heroic slow motion, and coating the soundtrack with syrpy music. A parallel is made between the strike and Vietnam, presumably with Silverman equating the American invasion with Duke Power, underlined by black and white TV footage and Bill decolouring his footage to be matching TV news. As in Norma Rae, the reversal domestic sex role reversal emasculates the man and empowers the women, where a man sits around drinking in the time his wife used to exhaust herself with home duties. And the suggestion of attraction between Hunter and Stellan Skarsguard as the union man is also underplayed, though Bill doesn't match the swimming scene in Martin Ritt's film. Thankfully the heroine isn't textbook &quot;politicised&quot;. She is someone both ordinary and extraordinary, an everywoman who is nervous at the prospect of public speaking, one who takes pleasure in the new opportunities the adventure provides yet is portrayed as being resourceful and wise even before the strike began. Hunter underplays and is all the more admirable, and I admired the journey of the scene she has with Ted Levine as her former-miner husband when he accuses her of changing and she replies it is he who has changed. I also liked the way Bill has her defends herself from someone who patronises her as an ignorant hillbilly yokel, and Skarsgard's inability to stomach the local cuisine.",4,Kentucky moonshine,990748800,"05 25, 2001",2001,2897,"['Showtime', 'TVM', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Bill', 'reminiscent', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'dash', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Dollmaker', 'Set', 'Kentucky', '1973', 'true', 'story', 'Brookside', 'coal', 'miners', 'strike', 'Duke', 'Power', 'company', 'refusal', 'agree', 'union', 'contract', 'When', 'managment', 'male', 'workers', 'wives', 'who', 'form', 'quot', 'women', 'club', 'quot', 'populate', 'picket', 'line', 'bypass', 'legal', 'trespassing', 'injunction', 'signed', 'men', 'using', 'constitutional', 'freedom', 'gather', 'meetings', 'defence', 'Strikes', 'picket', 'lines', 'are', 'always', 'demonstrations', 'strategy', 'whilst', 'intial', 'psychological', 'one-upman', 'ship', 'interesting', 'length', 'strike', 'accumulative', 'frustration', 'anger', 'parties', 'more', 'violent', 'confrontations', 'confrontations', 'particularly', 'climactic', 'act', 'show', 'moral', 'complications', 'such', 'activities', 'create', 'one', 'action', 'response', 'response', 'greater', 'ugliness', 'What', 'notable', 'teleplay', 'Peter', 'Silverman', 'representation', 'strike', 'action', 'only', 'part', 'lives', 'people', 'diminishing', 'commitment', 'cause', 'insight', 'when', 'strike', 'inevitably', 'inhabitants', 'county', 'will', 'have', 'continue', 'working', 'living', 'together', 'harmoniously', 'Silverman', 'also', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'leader', 'women', 'club', 'example', 'how', 'uneducated', 'people', 'still', 'have', 'common', 'sense', 'Bill', 'however', 'cliched', 'presentation', 'noble', 'hillbilly', 'filmed', 'heroic', 'slow', 'motion', 'coating', 'soundtrack', 'syrpy', 'music', 'parallel', 'made', 'strike', 'Vietnam', 'presumably', 'Silverman', 'equating', 'American', 'invasion', 'Duke', 'Power', 'underlined', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'footage', 'Bill', 'decolouring', 'footage', 'be', 'matching', 'TV', 'news', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'reversal', 'domestic', 'sex', 'role', 'reversal', 'man', 'women', 'where', 'man', 'around', 'drinking', 'time', 'wife', 'used', 'exhaust', 'home', 'duties', 'suggestion', 'attraction', 'Hunter', 'Stellan', 'Skarsguard', 'union', 'man', 'also', 'underplayed', 'Bill', ""n't"", 'match', 'swimming', 'scene', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'film', 'Thankfully', 'heroine', ""n't"", 'textbook', 'quot', 'politicised', 'quot', 'someone', 'ordinary', 'extraordinary', 'everywoman', 'who', 'nervous', 'prospect', 'public', 'speaking', 'one', 'who', 'pleasure', 'new', 'opportunities', 'adventure', 'yet', 'portrayed', 'being', 'resourceful', 'wise', 'even', 'strike', 'began', 'Hunter', 'underplays', 'more', 'admirable', 'admired', 'journey', 'scene', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'former-miner', 'husband', 'when', 'changing', 'who', 'changed', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'Bill', 'defends', 'someone', 'who', 'ignorant', 'hillbilly', 'yokel', 'Skarsgard', 'inability', 'stomach', 'local', 'cuisine']",N/A

Most things aren't, and we often don't perceive truth clearly no matter how it's presented.
