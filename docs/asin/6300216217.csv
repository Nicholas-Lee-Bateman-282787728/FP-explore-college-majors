We stayed, and laughed so hard I looked for it for years and told people about this odd film no one knows about.Thank God cable aired it and it became available on VHS so I could recommend it to friends.  The movie is simply hilarious.Matthau is an arrogant, cultured, vain, selfish and rich snob suddenly finding himself penniless.  His only salvation is to marry a rich woman and he finds the perfect target in the introverted and socially inept heiress/botanist played by Elaine May.Matthau, dreading this intrusion into his perfectly ordered bachelor existence, decides murder of this ditz-of-all-time is the answer to all his problems.  But, that is just the beginning to a very funny and ultimately touching story.There are some of the best written and performed comedy bits in this film that I've ever seen.  Starting with William Redfield as an accountant trying to explain to a willfully uncomprehending Matthau that he's broke; James Coco as Matthau's detested uncle extorting him over breakfast; Jack Weston as May's conniving and crooked lawyer/boyfriend; Matthau proposing to May while kneeling on broken glass; the wedding with May being given away by a blubbering Weston; the Honeymoon and the toga nightgown; May's disasterous household of thieving servants; and so on.Special mention must go to George Rose who plays Matthau's valet and all-purpose manservant.  He is superb in his dry, clipped delivery while conveying the man's undelying wisdom and empathy.Okay, the ending may seem tacked on or otherwise not perfect but you can say that about The Producers, Blazing Saddles, and quite a few other classic comedies.  I won't take so much as 1/2 star off for that.  This is a Classic American comedy and should be seen by everyone.  Don't miss it.

It just keeps socking you.Matthau is a pernicious delight in this dark fable of murderous greed and ultimate submission.  Socially awkward to the point of creepiness, May shines as the hapless victim and George Rose is hilarious as Matthau's butler.Henry Graham (Walter Matheau) is pompous and self absorbed, and has a big problem: he has run through his entire inheritance and completely unequipped to make a living outside being a gentleman bachelor of independent means. His guardian, Uncle Harry (James Coco!!!!), refuses to give him a dime.Henry is unwilling to commit suicide so he devises a plan with the help of his butler Harold George Rose), who is also motivated for Henry to have a solution because he fears looking for a job as a butler and gentleman's gentleman (valet) as opportunities for the lost art are thin on the ground. Henry needs money the old-fashioned way: marry it.Henry has just six weeks to find a rich bride and repay a loan that Uncle Harry gives him at punitive terms. Henry must forfeit all of his property if the loan isn't made good.Desperation sets in as Henry's poorly executed efforts to meet a suitable girl all fail. So with only days remaining on his deadline, Henry bumps into clumsy, painfully shy heiress Henrietta Lowell (Elain May, who also directs). A mailable Galatea, Henrietta is the answer to his prayers.Henrietta's suspicious lawyer Andy McPherson (Jack Weston) is a problem for Henry, as is his own revulsion for marriage (in a remarkable departure for Hollywood, Henry is apparently asexual or has the libido of a glass of ice water). But Henry considers his marriage to be a temporary inconvenience, since he plans to kill Henrietta  as soon as possible.Murder never far from his mind, Henry takes charge of Henrietta's life. He reorganizes her household staff, which has been taking advantage of her timidity and naivete. For example, Henrietta takes the bus everywhere becasue the servants are so busy, evne though she has a driver and multiple cars. Becasaue Henrietta is completely disorganized and recognizes her own weakness she welcomes Henry's manily take-charge attitude. She even notesthat he has the academic credentials to teach at a junior college, like herself.For Henrietta is a botany professor, and discovers a new species of tree fern and names it after Henry. She loves Henry and invites him to join her on a canoe trip to a remote area on a research trip for her work.I won't spoil the heart-warming ending. For this is a dark comedy with rays of grace.Directed by May from her screenplay and based on the short story The Green Heart by Jack Ritchie. The direction is nothing spectacular, no creative shots here, just good workman-like storytelling.Favorite quotes:""Kneeling on broken glass is my favorite pastime - it keeps me from slouching!""""Marriage?'

In every way imaginable I saw myself as Henrietta -awkward, shy, clumsy, dismissed by everyone. Forty years later I still recognize that awkward person Elaine May is portraying. Yet Henrietta seems completely clueless that she is perceived this way, which was something I found hard to buy, but it does make her more endearing and make this film more about Henry's journey as he marries this totally helpless yet wealthy creature in order to get out from under his financial problems and discovers he has to take over every aspect of her life outside of her profession as botanist in order to preserve her wealth and his rarefied sense of order. You might say Henry dislikes his new wife so much because he initially sees himself as her - he says so at the beginning of the film when he finds out he has no money. He confides in his gentleman's gentleman that he has no talents or ambitions other than being rich. This is not the case, but this is how he sees himself. This really IS the case for Henrietta yet she does not see herself that way. So, in a really quirky way they are made for each other.There really is only one big plot hole I could find. How did Henry know that he would be the beneficiary of Henrietta's estate if he should manage to either kill her or arrange ""an accident"" and get away with it? Someone with so much money and so many hangers-on as Henrietta would almost certainly have a will prior to their meeting and the two just recently got married.Elaine May has always been an underrated talent, and as for Walter Matthau, what can I say?

That is why ""A New Leaf"" (1971) really is a treasure. Other classic screwball romantic comedies of fame, good for the same reasons ""A New Leaf"" (1971) is good and thus worth getting and scsreening often, include ""His Girl Friday"" (1939) and ""Lovers And Other Strangers"" (1970).-------------Tex (David) Allen is a SAG-ACTRA accredited movie actor.

I just tried adding the DVD for this side-splittingly funny black comedy to my Netflix queue only to discover that it is not available. Really? I thought. How weird... oh, well. There's always Amazon--I'll just buy it outright...Except it's not available (at least not in DVD format) from Amazon, either. It doesn't appear to be available in DVD ANYWHERE, thanks to-- well, I'm not sure what, really. Does anyone know? Is this some stupid oversight on Paramount's part, or has there been some behind the scenes wrangling going on between Paramount and writer-director Elaine May regarding royalties or distribution? I'm as perplexed as everyone else here--why isn't this classic film, one of the great (and very much missed) Walter Matthau's very best, available by now on DVD? This is a travesty!Many who have reviewed here has mentioned their favorite comedic moments in this nearly flawless movie. I will add one or two of my own (apologies if I'm repeating): that lunatic throwaway line in my review title, where Henry and Henrietta, attending their first dinner party together, are smoothly introduced to various other couples, including the aforementioned Hitlers (Elaine May, her wickedly funny wit sharpened by her legendary improv partnership with actor-writer-director Mike Nichols, is really on her game with this, her first screenplay); the moment earlier on the film where it finally registers with Henry that he is, or is about to be, poor, and he wanders about in a weepy, funereal daze of self-pity, whispering his goodbyes to all his favorite upperclass haunts; and also the falling-down-on-the-floor-funny wedding sequence, especially the scene where Henrietta's sleazy attorney (played by the fabulous Jack Weston, also much missed), having failed in all previous attempts to prevent the marriage and reveal Henry as the charlatan they both know he is, is reduced to whispering increasingly desperate pleas to the befuddled bride as they stagger up the aisle (""Henrietta! Please! I'll kill myself if you do this insane thing--!!"") and can then be heard breaking into despairing sobs as Henry and Henrietta calmly exchange their vows.Amazingly funny stuff--if you've made it this far and never seen ""A New Leaf"" you're in for a treat, assuming you can find it, I mean. Its release to DVD (with special features, pretty please!) would be a terrific Christmas stocking stuffer--hint, hint, Paramount!!PS: Though reportedly Miss May and Mr. Matthau did not get on well during the filming of ""A New Leaf"" they must have patched things up nicely at some point, for they reteamed for the 1978 Neil Simon comedy ""California Suite"" in which they play a long-married couple staying at a ritzy California hotel.

Figler ""jfigl""","[42, 42]","That Elaine May has directed herself in a film only once bids fair to become one of the mythic disappointments of film history, like the hostile neglect visited upon so much of Orson Welles' work, like the fact that ""Night of the Hunter"" was Charles Laughton's only film as a director, like Oliver Stone having access to film-making equipment.The version here is not the film that May made. She attempted to no avail to have her name removed from it when the studio hijacked her 3-hour edit and decided that the cut we now have is the one that's good for us.  Heresy though it may be to say so, if this version is butchery, the original must have been...the best movie ever made.Henry Graham (Walter Matthau) is a suddenly penniless bon vivant who realizes he can perpetuate his extravagant lifestyle only by marrying, then killing, a rich woman. He sets his sights on Henrietta Lowell (Elaine May), a shy, painfully awkward, stupendously naive heiress and botanist who appears never to have enjoyed the romantic attentions of a man. This seeming pushover will prove to be, in a manner of speaking, an immovable object.Henrietta Lowell is a comic character with no awareness that she is a comic character. From the moment she first appears onscreen (at which point Henry makes brilliantly cynical use of her klutziness to demonstrate what a terribly gallant fellow he is, instantly cementing poor Henrietta's devotion) until the final frames, she thinks she's living in a love story, a fairy tale, not a black comedy. Her innocence, which seems so to endanger her, will actually be her salvation. And Henry's too.May's remarkably well-polished script builds from the ground up a world, its denizens, and the humor inherent in both.  For instance: The improbably frequent, seemingly endless repetition of the phrase ""Carbon on the valves"" is just plain funny but also sketches, first, Henry's chronic negligence and then, when the lament is repeated by a fellow playboy, a whole subculture of ""Henrys"". Or: Henry's snobbish reference to Mouton Rothschild (the '55 is CLEARLY superior to the '53) prompts Henrietta to offer, ever so helpfully, that with Mogen David ""every year is good"". Very funny, but also nuanced; the exchange speaks volumes about each. Dodi Heinrich, the odd little flower girl at the wedding, is pure visual one-liner, but to Henry is a terrifying doppelganger of Henrietta come to torment the hysterical groom.At the end, the viewer is just as startled as Henry to hear a contrite Henrietta say, ""Henry...I know...that this isn't exactly what you planned...But would you mind doing it...very much?""Maybe... just maybe... (writer Elaine May finally, teasingly suggests), Henrietta isn't as myopic as she seems.

""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" ""As Good as It Gets,""and ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Yes, yes, all good. Now consider ""A New Leaf."" Thought so. You've never heard of it. And that's a shame because this is my favorite comedy and that of other reviewers on this page. Why?Walter Matthau, a superb actor in any movie, stars with Elaine May, little known as an actress. She wrote the screenplay and directed the movie. There was much controversy behind the scenes, making it run millions over budget. Matthau and May did not get along. But the movie was made and distributed with little publicity.Why is the film so lauded by those who have seen it? Because it is so funny and matches the two most unlikely pair of characters this side of the moon for marriage. Back to the beginning.Henry Graham was born rich, lives rich, and awakens one day to discover his inheritance is gone. Having never worked, he is contemptuous of the idea. The only plan is to find a rich women, knock her off on the honeymoon, and inherit once again and become the rich playboy that is his natural right. Oh, add cynicism, world-weariness, rapier wit, and a great dislike of women on general grounds and Henry becomes a problem to himself in acquiring a bride.One of the funniest scenes in the movie that reveals his utter disregard for women occurs when he is with a woman well-endowed, not only financially but physically. She tells him how much she wants him and begins to undo the top to her swimsuit. He hollers: ""Don't let them out, Phyllis, don't let them out!""There is a bet involving money and his uncle with Henry having so many days to find a woman to marry him. He finds Henrietta , who is as klutzy and naive as he is sophisticated and cynical. He and his manservant continuously remove bread crumbs and new dress labels from her person, before she is presentable for going to teach botany at the local college. Henry must also deal with her bloated, unnecessary, useless, freeloading house staff.Through her goofy style Henrietta convinces Henry to accompany her on her annual trip to find an unnamed fern to name after her and live in posterity. The second funniest moment comes when Henrietta cannot get her arms and head in the right places in her Venetian nightgown on the honeymoon. I fell on the floor laughing at this scene.Suffice it to say, Henry does not kill Henrietta. In fact, the ending is just a beautiful thing--very low-keyed, seeming very ordinary but quite momentous--just like this fabulous film!

What to do?  The only solution, according to Henry's butler, is to marry a  wealthy woman, except Henry is a confirmed misogynist, so the idea revolts  him.  Then he adds his own twist - he will marry the woman, get her money,  AND then murder her.  His quest for the perfect victim leads him to Elaine  May, as Henrietta, an extravagantly clumsy and extravagantly wealthy  botanist who seems the perfect foil for Henry's scheme.This is a  perfectly cast movie.

Harold and Maude gets a lot of press  and because of that, it seems that a film like this should be enjoyed by a  lot more people. Anyone who enjoyed Harold and Maude - I mean really,  really liked it- will like this movie.Sure it's a bit darker. I mean, yeah,  Matthau wants to kill Elaine May so it's pretty dark. But it's just too  good a movie to be overlooked like it is. Matthau is excellent as Henry  Graham- a rich slob who realizes he must marry a rich widow or become  totally destitiute.(Spoiler) When his trust runs out, and after a lengthy  discussion with his accountant William Redfield(hilarious), Graham  discovers he has no money left. To counter this dangerous situattion, he  borrows some &quot;capital&quot; from his uncle and gets  $50,000 (for all  his possesions) with which to court a young widow of his choice. He finally  settles on klutz botanist Elaine May. She is so truly good in this film.  Mattahu and she are one of the great love couples of 1970s film! Mattahu  must then figure out how he's going to kill her. Based on a Jack Ritchie  story and sadly disowned by May herself, this film is a classic waiting to  be rediscovered. Mattahu's death may help bring about a new interest in his  filmography. Hopefully more people will watch this film and see it for the  great Matthau comic performance that it is.
