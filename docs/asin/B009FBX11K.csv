This DVD features four episodes each featuring Thomas and his friends getting into mischief but learning lessons in the longrun.  They are wholesome episodes with the trains solving problems, working together and getting into mischief.  I like that they focus on solving problems which my boys could definitely use help with.Episodes include:""Stuck on You""""Spencer the Grand""""Gordon and Ferdinand""""Charlie and Eddie""",4,Problem Solving,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,516,"['Yes', 'Thomas', 'DVD', 'same', 'wholesome', 'lessons', 'others', 'boys', 'love', 'DVD', 'four', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Thomas', 'friends', 'getting', 'mischief', 'learning', 'lessons', 'longrun', 'are', 'wholesome', 'episodes', 'trains', 'solving', 'problems', 'working', 'together', 'getting', 'mischief', 'like', 'focus', 'solving', 'problems', 'boys', 'could', 'definitely', 'use', 'help', 'with.Episodes', 'include', 'Stuck', 'Spencer', 'Grand', 'Gordon', 'Ferdinand', 'Charlie', 'Eddie']",Thomas & Friends: Sticky Situations

The characters are cute with lots of personality and most importantly, they are well behaved.  Well, most of the time!  And when they aren't, it's to teach a lesson.Thomas and Butch are using magnets and literally get stuck.  I like the comparison between that and friends sticking together. Reed is at the age (four) that friends are a huge part of his life.  I talked to him about friends helping each other out with they get stuck in certain situations.Another thing my son really seems to enjoy is the humor.  It's a bit corny but that's perfect for kids!  They crack jokes and Reed laughs like it's the funniest thing ever!  And this kid does not usually laugh out loud at shows!  I think train lovers have a certain kind of brain so they probably have similar senses of humor too!Hit Entertainment has another high quality, entertaining DVD! It amazes me that these Thomas shows are released so often and yet they never suffer in quality based on the quantity.  This would make a fun stocking stuffer for little boys!",5,Another Hit!,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,1124,"['just', 'love', 'Thomas', 'DVD', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'son', 'Reed', 'enough', 'watch', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'lots', 'personality', 'most', 'importantly', 'are', 'well', 'behaved', 'Well', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'teach', 'lesson.Thomas', 'Butch', 'are', 'using', 'magnets', 'literally', 'get', 'stuck', 'like', 'comparison', 'sticking', 'together', 'Reed', 'age', 'four', 'friends', 'are', 'huge', 'part', 'life', 'talked', 'friends', 'helping', 'other', 'out', 'get', 'stuck', 'certain', 'situations.Another', 'thing', 'son', 'really', 'enjoy', 'humor', 'bit', 'corny', 'perfect', 'kids', 'crack', 'jokes', 'Reed', 'funniest', 'thing', 'ever', 'kid', 'not', 'usually', 'out', 'loud', 'shows', 'think', 'train', 'lovers', 'have', 'certain', 'kind', 'brain', 'probably', 'have', 'similar', 'senses', 'humor', 'too', 'Hit', 'Entertainment', 'high', 'quality', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'Thomas', 'shows', 'are', 'released', 'so', 'often', 'yet', 'never', 'suffer', 'quality', 'based', 'quantity', 'would', 'make', 'fun', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'little', 'boys']",Thomas & Friends: Sticky Situations
