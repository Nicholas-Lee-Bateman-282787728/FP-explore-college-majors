They are running the new Sea World in Florida. And after having fun, along comes ..... Jaws 3. AIEEEEE !!!Such a big turd at now 35 feet, she roams the area in search of revenge after the people of the facility accidently killed her 15 ft baby. So, here she comes...and the shark is huge ! Blue screen FX are so awful....watching her big butt swimming across the screen is hilarious. The script is so 80's typical...a NEW AGE theme park  and they become food for ... JAWS 3 !! Aieeeeee.....blubblub....crunch.....munch....Unbelievably after winning an Oscar, Louis Gossit Jr. has the guts to star in such a dump of a movie? HAHAHAHAThe funniest part is when the little girl spots Jaws coming towards their underwater plexiglass view window and says, ""Look daddy...loooook!"" And without chaging his dull and bored facial expression yet changing his voice, he yells so loud, ""Holy ....""Imagine sounding so scared, swearing , yet looking half asleep??

I discovered I didn't own either DVD.  I could recall watching them at some point but didn't really remember the movies so I decided to rent them both on Amazon Instant.  After watching them I remembered why I didn't own the DVD's - they are horrible movies.  Jaws 3, based in sea world, is void of tension and suspense that Jaws inspires and I found myself not caring who got eaten and who lived.

It was already pretty shaky after Jaws 2 but this is the moment when the series jumped shark (no pun intended).  Through herculian efforts, I convinced myself that what happened in Jaws 2 was possible because maybe the shark in the first one had a girlfriend/boyfriend shark nearby.  But a supermassive great white terrorizing the Brody family for a third time?It's worth noting that this film probably contains a scene or two that have arguably the worst special effects of the whole Jaws series (including Jaws the Revenge).  The one that comes to mind is when the shark breaks through the glass and floods the place in the underwater city at the end of the movie.  It is not just bad, it is breathtakingly bad.  When the shark hits the glass it comes to a complete stop even though the glass it hits has just been shattered into tiny pieces. Imagine throwing a baseball at a window causing it to completely shatter but the ball miraculously does not go through the window.  That's the logic that this movie expects you to believe.One of the few nice things I can say about this movie is that it could have been worse (as Jaws the Revenge proved).  And there were some things that I liked:  I thought the little (by its standards) baby great white was cute and the dolphins were awesome.  But these small elements that I enjoyed are few and far between.I'll admit that when I was young I must have watched this movie many times.  But now that I'm older I've regretted spending so much time watching these movies that made money JUST by their title and little else.  They're a waste of time and money and I strongly urge anyone seriously considering buying this to look elsewhere.

202841,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6300183181,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[2, 3]","First, to debunk the product description, the most terrifying ""Jaws"" ever will always be the first. Nothing after that is even in the same league. And this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original, topped only by ""Jaws 4- The Revenge,"" in being worse. ""III was originally released at the theater  in 3-D, which didn't improve it by any stretch, rather made it more of a novelty. In viewing in non-3D release, it's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-D scenes, which are obvious when you watch it now. The acting couldn't be more ""made for TV,"" as can be said about the whole storyline, the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director. This is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing, ""Yeah, right!"", when seeing many of the sequences. Even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater. Once again, another movie, regardless of how bad it is, I peak at it occasionally when on the Dish just to watch Lea Thompson, even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules. The same can be said of the whole cast in fact, including, shamefully, Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar winning ""Officer and a Gentleman"" role. He couldn't have a more annoying, over the top, archetypical character. I hope the check was worth it Louis. There's nothing nearly as suspenseful, dramatic, or engaging as the original. There are no characters that you really care about- there's no depth, merely posturing by the characters. And the climax' plausibility is an insult to one's intelligence. This movie is just plain bad. In that it can be worth a watch alone, just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of ""Jaws.""",1,"Don't buy into the ""product description.""",1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,1865,"['First', 'debunk', 'product', 'description', 'most', 'terrifying', 'Jaws', 'ever', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'first', 'Nothing', 'even', 'same', 'league', 'chapter', 'devolution', 'started', 'ending', 'credits', 'original', 'topped', 'only', 'Jaws', '4-', 'Revenge', 'being', 'worse', 'III', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'theater', '3-D', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'stretch', 'rather', 'made', 'more', 'novelty', 'viewing', 'non-3D', 'release', 'even', 'worse', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'director', 'catered', '3-D', 'scenes', 'are', 'obvious', 'when', 'watch', 'now', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'made', 'TV', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'whole', 'storyline', 'scenes', 'deception', 'freely', 'utilized', 'camera', 'director', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'constantly', 'find', 'scoffing', 'Yeah', 'right', 'when', 'seeing', 'many', 'sequences', 'Even', 'very', 'ending', 'movie', 'caused', 'laugh', 'contempt', 'when', 'exiting', 'theater', 'Once', 'again', 'movie', 'regardless', 'how', 'bad', 'peak', 'occasionally', 'when', 'Dish', 'just', 'watch', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'even', 'acting', 'one', 'nothing', 'time', 'capsules', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'whole', 'cast', 'fact', 'including', 'shamefully', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'fresh', 'off', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'role', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'annoying', 'top', 'archetypical', 'character', 'hope', 'check', 'was', 'worth', 'Louis', 'nothing', 'nearly', 'as', 'suspenseful', 'dramatic', 'engaging', 'original', 'are', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'about-', 'depth', 'merely', 'posturing', 'characters', 'climax', 'plausibility', 'insult', 'one', 'intelligence', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'watch', 'alone', 'just', 'take', 'pot', 'shots', 'absurdity', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'down', 'making', 'buck', 'had', 'dragged', 'down', 'once', 'proud', 'brand', 'name', 'Jaws']",N/A

202850,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6300183181,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","After two trips to Amity Island, the JAWS makes a bold but brilliant move in relocating the action to the Sea World amusement park, where a pair of sharks terrorize the local marine life and park goers! Mike Brody, the oldest son of Chief Martin Brody, has taken a position designing the newest attractions at the theme park. As fate would have it, he comes face to face with another Great White shark that has entered the park through a deep sea channel. With the help of other staffers, he manages to capture the shark and put it on display, but what he doesn't know is that the shark's 35-foot mother isn't far behind... At the time of its release, the 3-D gimmick was at the height of its popularity. While the eye-popping effects may have entertained theater audiences in the 80's, the subsequent home video releases are left with lingering, discolored scenes that are entirely out of place from the rest of the film. This is but a minor distraction, however, and there is still plenty of fun to be had in the script without the help of the old red-and-blue visors. Watching two White sharks run amok in a giant undersea kingdom while attacking water skiers and performers is a dream come true for many Horror fans. Alan Parker steps in with a highly energetic new score that compliments the theme park setting, while the infamous shark theme from JAWS remains intact. What is most surprising about JAWS 3 is the amount of blood and gore than managed to make its way in to the theaters for a film that earned a PG rating from the MPAA. Floating heads and severed limbs cloud the screen in blood, which must have been a real treat in the original 3-D. A young Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong headline as the film's leads, with each providing an enjoyable and fresh new role to the series.

In the early to mid eighties, there was a mini revival of the 3D format, hence Jaws 3D.  The filmmakers, in an attempt to link this wretched sequel to the previous two, bring back Mike and Sean Brody.  Apparently, Mike works at Seaworld, in some fashion or other, and his younger brother Sean comes for a visit.  Seems to me that if I had a couple of life changing events with enormous man eating sharks, I would be wary of working around the water, but there you go.As is common with sequels, this one suffers from a much lower budget than the previous movies, and it seems obvious with the cheesy special effects.  Was there hope that the threadbare plot and flimsy connection to the first two movies would be covered up by the awesome use of 3D?  Probably, but since 3D is not available on this disc, that makes the movie seem all the more hokey, especially when you see something flying towards the screen for no apparent reason.Basically, a baby shark and a mother shark enter a man made lagoon in Seaworld, the baby shark ends up dying due to human recklessness, and the mother shark wreaks all kinds of havoc.  That's it.  While some of the actors do a very capable job, with Dennis Quaid showing a glimmer of talent, they can't save the movie's poor direction and excrutiatingly bad special effects (with some of the most obvious examples of bluescreen work I've ever seen...did they even watch this movie before releasing it?).  This movie was basically made to capitalize on the short-lived 3D fad in the eighties and off the huge and moderate success of its predecessors, Jaws and Jaws 2.  On a positive note, at least it's not Jaws:  The Revenge.My take on this series of movies is the first is not only the best, but one of the greatest movies of all time.  Jaws was not about body count (only four people got killed in that one) but about telling a great story, credible characters, the building of suspense, and amazing direction.  Jaws 2, lacking the element of surprise and shock of the first, was wholly serviceable and did have it's moments, but ultimately was just an effort to squeeze some more money out of the premise, and it shows.  The next two sequels are more of the same, each being shoddier than the next.  Hopefully we've seen the end of this series, a series that should have never existed.

While the first ""Jaws"" displayed at least a modicum of intelligence about its monster, ""Jaws 3"" basically ignores any factual information about the Great White Shark, especially one that's (an unheard-of) 35 feet long. Bess Armstrong plays a peppy marine biologist who displays a tragic lack of knowledge about sharks when she says ""Our shark still had all its teeth--that means it was a baby."" Unfortunately, sharks don't have temporary teeth like a human child; they go through hundreds of sets of teeth throughout their entire lives.Still, ""Jaws 3"" works as a sort of underwater slasher-flick, with gruesome killings and potboiler characters, and the battle royal between Jaws and two bottlenose dolphins is a hoot.

The script/story, though a joke, is at least a breath of fresh air than just rehashing the first one like 2 did. At least there's a surprise when after the baby shark dies, they reveal that its mother is somewhere in the park. The most fun I do have watching this movie is pointing out the effects that were supposed to be 3-D (seeing as how the effect of 3-D doesn't translate that well to home video) and stuff that the shark isn't supposed to be able to do (like roar and being able to go in reverse when inside the pipe). A very young Dennis Quaid is the elder Brody in this outing, working at Sea World (though which Sea World I don't know but I'm guessing its Florida). He's probably the best actor out of the bunch as everyone else, especially Louis Gossett, comes off as bland.

202867,A3FDHJWK54LHAO,6300183181,"""dbzub22""","[1, 2]","Jaws 3, the second sequel to a movie that didn't even need one. In theatres it was presented in glorious 3-D, but not for home video, nor is it shown in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, which sort of takes the fun out of this movie. But it still has its assets. Besides having a big cast, I can easily say that the mechanical shark in this installment is the best yet!First off, I liked how the eyes of this shark realistically rolled back white whenever it attacked its prey, just as real sharks' do. A very nice touch.I also noticed that the shark in this movie had a lot more attention paid to the working mechanics of its jaws. For instance, when a shark opens its mouth, its gums lower to the point that they look like they're going to fall right out of its mouth. You'd think something so noticable would've been incorperated into the design of the mechanical shark in the the first Jaws movie. But it wasn't until Jaws 3 when that effect finally came into play. It was the first and only mechanical shark in the series that did that. It was also the only shark in the series that never stuck its head out of the water for more than a couple of seconds, which was more realistic than having a shark throw itself onto a boat, and stay there until someone slides into its mouth.Lastly, the shark's skin seems to have been perfected. It wasn't rubbery like the sharks in the first and second movie, and wasn't as rough as sandpaper like the one in the fourth Jaws. Its skin actually looked fleshy!Apart from the shark's super-slow speed, and the several instinces where we were obviously meant to see it in 3-D, this shark looked more real than all the other sharks in the series put together!The one thing that I couldn't get past with the shark in this movie was its size. Though it's true that all the sharks in the Jaws series were guilty of being overly large, 35 feet is ridiculous! And what better way to see this big female shark demonstrate her freakish size than by scooping a full grown man completley into her mouth, where he's repeatedly squeezed between her massive tounge and the roof of her mouth until he explodes! Though it was interesting to watch, and maybe even a little funny, it was clearly impossible.All in all, this movie just served to be campy fun, and will appeal to you if you enjoy movies like: Anaconda, Lake Placid, Piranha, and Deep Blue Sea. However, if you're hoping for a movie that recaptures the fear of the original Jaws, than don't look any further than Jaws 2, which is finally available on DVD, and as a 'special edition' no less. I think it would be nice if the Univeral released this movie on DVD to complete the series. I'd love to see it in its full 2.35:1 widescreen format, and in 3-D. Anyone who owns a multi-regional DVD player, and wants to add this movie to their DVD collection can do it already. Jaws 3 is currently available on DVD in R2 and R4. They aren't in 3-D as most people would've liked, but it is in animorphic widescreen, and includes 3 trailers. One is the theatrical, and the others are for Jaws 2 and Jaws The Revenge. Perhaps Unviersal is holding back the R1 release of Jaws 3 to make a special edition DVD.

Most of us at a younger age could care less about story and characters, and in this case, want to see some great Shark horror action.  The idea behind this film was genious in that sense.  What better way to get lots of helpless people within easy grasp of a giant shark?  Put them in the undersea kingdom at Sea World, inside underwater glass walkways.  The scene scared me nearly to death as a kid, when the crowd is running down the walkway with the shark chasing them and breaking the glass soon after.  Though nobody gets near the shark, but the people do get stuck in flooding waters for some time.  Today, watching that scene is embarassing to think I used to like it, but we all have to grow up at some point.Everything from the prior films is lost in Jaws 3.  Everything except a few returning characters - Mike and Sean Brody, now young adults, with Mike an employee at Sea World and Sean visiting from Colorado.  The actors have changed though, with Dennis Quaid playing Mike.  But a fine actor such as Quaid can't save this film.  The idea, is teriffic, putting a huge shark in the middle of a tourist trap, but the execution is not quite there.  This is supposed to be Sea World in Florida, but it doesn't make much sense to me that it's connected to the ocean in the film.  Oh well, one of those things we'll just have to accept.  It takes some time (about 40 minutes) for the characters to realize there is a shark in the park, and one of the best parts of the film is that the shark they find is only a baby (though appearing menacing enough).  The real shark (mommy!) eventually reveals her 35ft. self, which was a bit ridiculous if you ask me - just too big.  The shark moved worse than ever - very mechanical and looked horrible in nearly every scene.  And it even growls!  Whoah, what kind of shark does that?  Even the horror elements aren't very scary, though they easily could be (such as the forementined people in the underwater walkways), but all the visuals look pathetic.  Though it was all originally intended for 3-d, we're forced to watch this minus that, resulting in the poor effects.  One of the scariest parts of the film for me, or rather more intriguing, is when we get an ""in-the-mouth"" view of the shark attempting to swallow Philip Royce, almost felt as if the viewer is being swallowed him/herself.This is a fun movie overall, and even a guilty pleasure and late night popcorn flick - but it just can't be taken seriously.  It's a great sequal in the sense to takes things to a completely new setting with Sea World, but everything else makes it sad that they even put the name Jaws on this.Acting - 3.5Characters - 3Horror - 2.5Story - 3.5Overall - 3",3,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen",1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,2767,"['loved', 'kid', 'fact', 'was', 'favorite', 'Jaws', 'films', 'Most', 'younger', 'age', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'story', 'characters', 'case', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'Shark', 'horror', 'action', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'genious', 'sense', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'get', 'lots', 'helpless', 'people', 'easy', 'grasp', 'giant', 'shark', 'Put', 'undersea', 'kingdom', 'Sea', 'World', 'underwater', 'glass', 'walkways', 'scene', 'scared', 'nearly', 'death', 'kid', 'when', 'crowd', 'running', 'down', 'walkway', 'shark', 'chasing', 'breaking', 'glass', 'soon', 'nobody', 'shark', 'people', 'do', 'get', 'stuck', 'flooding', 'waters', 'time', 'Today', 'watching', 'scene', 'embarassing', 'think', 'used', 'like', 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'point.Everything', 'prior', 'films', 'lost', 'Jaws', '3', 'Everything', 'few', 'returning', 'characters', 'Mike', 'Sean', 'Brody', 'now', 'young', 'adults', 'Mike', 'employee', 'Sea', 'World', 'Sean', 'visiting', 'Colorado', 'actors', 'have', 'changed', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'playing', 'Mike', 'fine', 'actor', 'such', 'Quaid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'idea', 'teriffic', 'putting', 'huge', 'shark', 'middle', 'tourist', 'trap', 'execution', 'not', 'quite', 'there', 'supposed', 'be', 'Sea', 'World', 'Florida', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'connected', 'ocean', 'film', 'Oh', 'well', 'one', 'things', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'accept', 'time', '40', 'minutes', 'characters', 'realize', 'shark', 'park', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'shark', 'find', 'only', 'baby', 'appearing', 'menacing', 'enough', 'real', 'shark', 'mommy', 'eventually', '35ft', 'self', 'was', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'ask', 'just', 'too', 'big', 'shark', 'moved', 'worse', 'ever', 'very', 'mechanical', 'looked', 'horrible', 'nearly', 'scene', 'even', 'Whoah', 'what', 'kind', 'shark', 'Even', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary', 'easily', 'could', 'be', 'such', 'forementined', 'people', 'underwater', 'walkways', 'visuals', 'look', 'pathetic', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', '3-d', ""'re"", 'forced', 'watch', 'minus', 'resulting', 'poor', 'effects', 'One', 'scariest', 'parts', 'film', 'rather', 'more', 'intriguing', 'when', 'get', 'in-the-mouth', 'view', 'shark', 'attempting', 'swallow', 'Philip', 'Royce', 'almost', 'felt', 'viewer', 'being', 'swallowed', 'him/herself.This', 'fun', 'movie', 'overall', 'even', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'late', 'night', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'great', 'sequal', 'sense', 'things', 'completely', 'new', 'setting', 'Sea', 'World', 'everything', 'else', 'even', 'put', 'name', 'Jaws', 'this.Acting', '3.5Characters', '3Horror', '2.5Story', '3.5Overall', '3']",N/A

Basically, they just kept tossing things into the forefront and that was the extent of their 3D effect.

I don't think this is a movie anyone brags about in their resume.That said, I hold a peculiar fondness for this turkey.  It makes me smile every time I watch it.  Yes, it's bad.  It's amazing how many of the people who worked on it blame someone else for its shortcomings.  Fabulous author Richard Matheson blames `script doctors.'  Everyone blames the director, Joe Alves, who was a production designer.  Roy Scheider was glad to be left out of it.  Apparently, they first proposed this as a comedy spoof: Jaws 3, People 0.  How it got from there to this is anyone's guess.  At any rate, it's just dopey enough to be fun.

Simon MacCorkindale shows up as a self-congratulatory braggart big game photographer/hunter something or other.

202882,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300183181,Erik North,"[1, 2]","For all the hype surrounding this third big fish entry's use of 3-D effects, JAWS 3 still rests in a vacuum because the shark's rampages and the means used to destroy it totally defy credibility.  The film puts Dennis Quaid in the role of Mike Brody, who is now employed at the Undersea Kingdom in Florida as a marine mammal expert.  Jon Putch is his younger brother Sean, who like their father has a severe case of hydrophobia because of his previous encounters with sharks.  That fear is fully justified when a shark sneaks into the underwater tubes that connect the park to the Atlantic Ocean and kills three people before being anaesthetized.But in a truly gratuitous twist, the shark's mother, a 35-foot Great White, comes looking for its ""infant"" and proceeds to turn the Undersea Kingdom into a kill zone before the obligatory over-the-top method of killing him comes into play.Alongside Quaid and Putch are such talented people as Louis Gossett Jr., coming off his Oscar-winning turn in 1982's AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, Bess Armstrong, and, in an early role, BACK TO THE FUTURE's Lea Thompson.  Unfortunately, they are saddled with a surprisingly inert screenplay by Richard Matheson (of DUEL fame) and JAWS veteran Carl Gottlieb, as well as the equally inert direction of Joe Alves, who was production designer on the first two films and associate producer on the second.  The suspense that was generated so naturally by Spielberg in the spectacular original is lost on Alves, and even the 3-D effects aren't quite enough to make JAWS 3 any better than routine.

Of the lot of them, this one tries to pass the torch of shark-fighting to Michael Brody, who has even left Amity island.  Mike now works at Sea World as the chief engineer, and he is quite proud of his newly created &quot;Undersea kingdom,&quot; which is just opening this week.This &quot;Undersea kingdom&quot; attracts an experienced Australian shark-hunter (perhaps the Croc-hunter took too many lessons from watching this film) and his assistant.It also attracts baby-brother Sean, who has a considerably logical fear of the water.  Being trapped on a boat with seventeen teenagers, one of whom is eating while holding you up, would drive anyone to become a cowboy instead of a diver.  Sean, however, appears to be an omen of misfortune, for wherever he goes, a shark tends to appear.A baby shark swims through the gate which is left open by the rather irresponsible water-skiers.  You are set up at the start to think the baby, who detects easy prey, will attack the skiers, but breaking with the tradition of Chrissy and the two rich divers, the skiers survive.  If anything, they distract the baby.  In a sense, this whole nightmare is partly Kelly's fault.Clearly Deep Blue sea stole some ideas from this film, because most of the actual business towards running the park takes place in the underwater control room.  It's not merely aesthetics that convinced them to create a gigantic plexi-glass window in front in either film.While reunited with his brother, Sean, Mike watches as Kelly hunts Sean like he was a stag.  But to Mike, the relationship with senior biologist Katherine is of much greater interest.  The only problem I have with Katherine is that her dolphins have a habit of rescuing her.  She should be sensible enough to send Dan and Liz, her assistants, into the water instead of her.  But, it wouldn't be an action-ATTEMPT (this doesn't succeed, but for farcical horror it is exceptional) if the heroine didn't put herself at risk as well.  Besides, the dolphins probably wouldn't rescue Dan or Liz.  I assure you it is quite worth it to watch how, just as the shark is about to make a meal of Katherine, her two dolphins show up and start slapping Jaws until she forget about Katherine long enough for her to get away.  Biologically, that is how dolphins would put a stop to a shark, because shark cartiledge cannot withstand high amounts of pressure.Naturally, Calvin Bouchard, the manager, is far more interested in killing the shark than anything else.  At least he doesn't insist on keeping things hushed up.  But he doesn't listen to the biologist, period.  Had Katherine been able to keep the baby shark herself a bit longer, she might have developed a connection with it.  To watch her around animals, even sharks, appears almost druidic in her ability to connect to them.  The baby shark attacks her only once, and it soon lets her go.And by the way, it is a biological certainty that all great whites, no matter what age, will commit suicide if they are in captivity.  They cannot survive without the sea.  Ask any icthyologist.  Now, bear in mind, they should have realized this.  But, hey, a great white is an excellent money-maker, and quite a reputation-builder.I love this movie.  If you want Jaws to revive itself, you should watch Jaws 2, which is what happens when you lose your supporting cast and have to draw upon pure terror, or Jaws 4, which is what happens when you run out of remaining characters and have to draw on the family.  Regretfully, Jaws 4 is how the Jaws situation will ultimately play out, though Ellen's newly developed psychic abilities regaurding sharks mean that the film only makes sense to people who're into that type of thing.Possible explaintations for Jaws 4's changes.  Clearly between Jaws 3-4, some disconnect has taken place.  Mike has obviously become influenced enough by Katherine to abandon engineering and study marine biology, but my guess would be that Katherine decided she should remain with her animals instead of going with him to S. America.  Somewhere in this, he meets Carla, an artist and scultress, who obviously has Lea, their daughter, before he met her.  Carla is not Katherine!  Carla is cruel, and doesn't seem to trust Mike.  Katherine is stronger and knows what she wants, but works better with animals than she does with people.",5,The most interesting of the movies.,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,4404,"['film', 'not', 'original', 'Jaws', 'Jaws', '2', 'Jaws', 'revenge', 'lot', 'one', 'pass', 'torch', 'shark-fighting', 'Michael', 'Brody', 'who', 'even', 'left', 'Amity', 'island', 'Mike', 'now', 'Sea', 'World', 'chief', 'engineer', 'quite', 'proud', 'newly', 'created', 'quot', 'Undersea', 'kingdom', 'quot', 'just', 'opening', 'week.This', 'quot', 'Undersea', 'kingdom', 'quot', 'experienced', 'Australian', 'shark-hunter', 'perhaps', 'Croc-hunter', 'took', 'too', 'many', 'lessons', 'watching', 'film', 'assistant.It', 'also', 'baby-brother', 'Sean', 'who', 'considerably', 'logical', 'fear', 'water', 'Being', 'trapped', 'boat', 'seventeen', 'teenagers', 'one', 'whom', 'eating', 'holding', 'would', 'drive', 'anyone', 'become', 'cowboy', 'instead', 'diver', 'Sean', 'however', 'be', 'omen', 'misfortune', 'wherever', 'shark', 'appear.A', 'baby', 'shark', 'gate', 'left', 'open', 'rather', 'irresponsible', 'water-skiers', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'start', 'think', 'baby', 'who', 'easy', 'prey', 'will', 'attack', 'skiers', 'breaking', 'tradition', 'Chrissy', 'two', 'rich', 'divers', 'skiers', 'survive', 'anything', 'distract', 'baby', 'sense', 'whole', 'nightmare', 'partly', 'Kelly', 'fault.Clearly', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'sea', 'stole', 'ideas', 'film', 'most', 'actual', 'business', 'towards', 'running', 'park', 'place', 'underwater', 'control', 'room', 'not', 'merely', 'aesthetics', 'convinced', 'create', 'gigantic', 'plexi-glass', 'window', 'front', 'film.While', 'reunited', 'brother', 'Sean', 'Mike', 'Kelly', 'Sean', 'was', 'stag', 'Mike', 'relationship', 'senior', 'biologist', 'Katherine', 'much', 'greater', 'interest', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'Katherine', 'dolphins', 'have', 'habit', 'rescuing', 'should', 'be', 'sensible', 'enough', 'send', 'Dan', 'Liz', 'assistants', 'water', 'instead', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'action-ATTEMPT', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'farcical', 'horror', 'exceptional', 'heroine', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'risk', 'as', 'well', 'Besides', 'dolphins', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'Dan', 'Liz', 'assure', 'quite', 'worth', 'watch', 'how', 'just', 'shark', 'make', 'meal', 'Katherine', 'two', 'dolphins', 'show', 'up', 'start', 'slapping', 'Jaws', 'forget', 'Katherine', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'away', 'Biologically', 'how', 'dolphins', 'would', 'put', 'stop', 'shark', 'shark', 'cartiledge', 'can', 'not', 'withstand', 'high', 'amounts', 'pressure.Naturally', 'Calvin', 'Bouchard', 'manager', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'killing', 'shark', 'anything', 'else', 'least', ""n't"", 'insist', 'keeping', 'things', 'hushed', 'up', ""n't"", 'listen', 'biologist', 'period', 'Had', 'Katherine', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'baby', 'shark', 'bit', 'longer', 'might', 'have', 'developed', 'connection', 'watch', 'animals', 'even', 'sharks', 'almost', 'druidic', 'ability', 'connect', 'baby', 'shark', 'only', 'once', 'soon', 'go.And', 'way', 'biological', 'certainty', 'great', 'whites', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'will', 'commit', 'suicide', 'are', 'captivity', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'sea', 'Ask', 'icthyologist', 'Now', 'bear', 'mind', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'hey', 'great', 'white', 'excellent', 'money-maker', 'quite', 'reputation-builder.I', 'love', 'movie', 'want', 'Jaws', 'revive', 'should', 'watch', 'Jaws', '2', 'what', 'when', 'lose', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'draw', 'pure', 'terror', 'Jaws', '4', 'what', 'when', 'run', 'remaining', 'characters', 'have', 'draw', 'family', 'Regretfully', 'Jaws', '4', 'how', 'Jaws', 'situation', 'will', 'ultimately', 'play', 'out', 'Ellen', 'newly', 'developed', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'regaurding', 'sharks', 'mean', 'film', 'only', 'sense', 'people', 'who', ""'re"", 'type', 'thing.Possible', 'explaintations', 'Jaws', '4', 'changes', 'Clearly', 'Jaws', '3-4', 'disconnect', 'taken', 'place', 'Mike', 'obviously', 'become', 'influenced', 'enough', 'Katherine', 'abandon', 'engineering', 'study', 'marine', 'biology', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'Katherine', 'decided', 'should', 'remain', 'animals', 'instead', 'going', 'S.', 'America', 'Somewhere', 'Carla', 'artist', 'scultress', 'who', 'obviously', 'Lea', 'daughter', 'met', 'Carla', 'not', 'Katherine', 'Carla', 'cruel', ""n't"", 'seem', 'trust', 'Mike', 'Katherine', 'stronger', 'what', 'better', 'animals', 'people']",N/A

202892,APEOO1ATR5VHB,6300183181,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[2, 3]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Warning- Spoilers Contained Below-- Jaws 3 was the third film in Universal Studios' shark-thriller movie series. The first film, released in 1975, was a pioneering blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. He passed on a sequel, and so Jaws 2 was directed by Jeannot Swarc. Generally considered inferior to the first, it nonetheless made a modest profit at the box office in 1978. Five years would pass before another sequel was made--but perhaps it shouldn't have. 1983 saw a brief revival of 3-D films at the box-office, with minimal results. It was likely presumed that a 3-D Jaws would have more 'bite' to offer filmgoers. It didn't work.This time (directed by Joe Alves), the action moves from the New England town of Amity to a coastal Florida Sea World amusement park. The film damages its thematic credibility early on by prematurely aging the Brody boys, sons of Chief Brody of the first two Jaws films. Now the 30-ish Mike (played by Dennis Quaid in his 80's zenith) is an engineer/designer of underwater tunnel systems, with Sean college-aged and visiting his big brother for the summer. Bess Armstrong is Kathryn Morgan, the park's head marine biologist and Mike's love interest. Lea Thompson is Kelly, a ski-show performer and Sean's would-be girlfriend.Louis Gossett, Jr. (who had recently won an Oscar for his role in An Officer and a Gentleman) plays the flamboyant Calvin Bouchard, a New Orleans-reared businessman who has just recently taken over as the manager of the park. Fishy things start to happen when a great white shark apparently mauls an unsuspecting worker near the park's storm drainage tunnels.Enter Philip FitzRoyce, played by Simon MacCorkindale (TV's ""Manimal"") an Australian wildlife photographer/hunter who offers to capture the rogue predator. He is successful, and Bouchard orders that the shark be put on display to seize on the publicity. His decision is questioned by Kathryn and Mike, the latter of whom knows all too well that great whites aren't anything to trifle with.Soon, the shark specimen dies--however, the recently discovered remains of another shark victim indicate that they couldn't have been killed by the shark in custody--this one would have to be much bigger. Shortly afterwards, the park staff (and their clientele) are face to face with the shark's mother--over 30 feet in length and apparently feeling a maternal revenge instinct. From there, shark mayhem starts happening in a major way, as the murderous predator mauls its way through a ski-show exhibition, the bumper boat lagoon, and floods an observation tunnel. The shark is contained only temporarily, setting up the climax where viewers get to see a slow-motion reaction shot from the protagonists as the shark apparently has the presence of mind to charge headlong into an underwater control room to get at those pesky humans.Quaid is decent enough as a lead and Gossett is always a pleasure to watch, but despite their acting pedigrees this film is still strictly B-grade at best. It is unintentionally humorous that Sea World would lend its brand name to be potentially marred as vulnerable to shark invasion (at least, the coastal locations). Perhaps the show dolphins prominently featured in the film (another real-life park attraction) had something to do with the enticement--though it would have been great if at least one of them were sacrificed to the shark. The special effects here are dated, and rendered muter for the fact that the 3-D effect has been removed. Certain scenes show objects heading straight for the camera (like a hypodermic needle, a crossbow bolt, shattered glass--oh yes, and 'Bruce'). Minus the 3-D effect, unknowing viewers may question the odd choice of angles. Everyone except a Jaws completist should only rent this film.",2,JAWS 3:  It Bites...,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,3820,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Warning-', 'Spoilers', 'Contained', 'Below', 'Jaws', '3', 'was', 'third', 'film', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'shark-thriller', 'movie', 'series', 'first', 'film', 'released', '1975', 'was', 'pioneering', 'blockbuster', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'passed', 'sequel', 'so', 'Jaws', '2', 'was', 'directed', 'Jeannot', 'Swarc', 'Generally', 'considered', 'inferior', 'first', 'nonetheless', 'made', 'modest', 'profit', 'box', 'office', '1978', 'Five', 'years', 'would', 'pass', 'sequel', 'was', 'made', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', '1983', 'saw', 'brief', 'revival', '3-D', 'films', 'box-office', 'minimal', 'results', 'was', 'likely', 'presumed', '3-D', 'Jaws', 'would', 'have', 'more', ""'bite"", 'offer', 'filmgoers', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.This', 'time', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Alves', 'action', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'Amity', 'coastal', 'Florida', 'Sea', 'World', 'amusement', 'park', 'film', 'damages', 'thematic', 'credibility', 'early', 'prematurely', 'aging', 'Brody', 'sons', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'first', 'two', 'Jaws', 'films', 'Now', '30-ish', 'Mike', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', '80', 'zenith', 'engineer/designer', 'underwater', 'tunnel', 'systems', 'Sean', 'college-aged', 'visiting', 'big', 'brother', 'summer', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'Kathryn', 'Morgan', 'park', 'head', 'marine', 'biologist', 'Mike', 'love', 'interest', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'Kelly', 'ski-show', 'performer', 'Sean', 'would-be', 'girlfriend.Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'flamboyant', 'Calvin', 'Bouchard', 'New', 'Orleans-reared', 'businessman', 'who', 'just', 'recently', 'taken', 'over', 'manager', 'park', 'Fishy', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'when', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'apparently', 'mauls', 'unsuspecting', 'worker', 'park', 'storm', 'drainage', 'tunnels.Enter', 'Philip', 'FitzRoyce', 'played', 'Simon', 'MacCorkindale', 'TV', 'Manimal', 'Australian', 'wildlife', 'photographer/hunter', 'who', 'capture', 'rogue', 'predator', 'successful', 'Bouchard', 'orders', 'shark', 'be', 'put', 'display', 'seize', 'publicity', 'decision', 'questioned', 'Kathryn', 'Mike', 'latter', 'whom', 'too', 'well', 'great', 'whites', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'trifle', 'with.Soon', 'shark', 'specimen', 'dies', 'however', 'recently', 'discovered', 'remains', 'shark', 'victim', 'indicate', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'shark', 'custody', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'much', 'bigger', 'Shortly', 'afterwards', 'park', 'staff', 'clientele', 'are', 'face', 'face', 'shark', 'mother', '30', 'feet', 'length', 'apparently', 'feeling', 'maternal', 'revenge', 'instinct', 'there', 'shark', 'mayhem', 'happening', 'major', 'way', 'murderous', 'predator', 'mauls', 'way', 'ski-show', 'exhibition', 'bumper', 'boat', 'lagoon', 'floods', 'observation', 'tunnel', 'shark', 'contained', 'only', 'temporarily', 'setting', 'up', 'climax', 'where', 'viewers', 'get', 'see', 'slow-motion', 'reaction', 'shot', 'protagonists', 'shark', 'apparently', 'presence', 'mind', 'charge', 'headlong', 'underwater', 'control', 'room', 'get', 'pesky', 'humans.Quaid', 'decent', 'enough', 'lead', 'Gossett', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'acting', 'pedigrees', 'film', 'still', 'strictly', 'B-grade', 'best', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'Sea', 'World', 'would', 'lend', 'brand', 'name', 'be', 'potentially', 'marred', 'vulnerable', 'shark', 'invasion', 'least', 'coastal', 'locations', 'Perhaps', 'show', 'prominently', 'featured', 'film', 'real-life', 'park', 'attraction', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'enticement', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'least', 'one', 'were', 'sacrificed', 'shark', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'dated', 'rendered', 'muter', 'fact', '3-D', 'effect', 'been', 'removed', 'Certain', 'show', 'heading', 'straight', 'camera', 'hypodermic', 'needle', 'crossbow', 'bolt', 'shattered', 'glass', 'oh', 'yes', ""'Bruce"", '3-D', 'effect', 'unknowing', 'viewers', 'may', 'question', 'odd', 'choice', 'angles', 'Everyone', 'Jaws', 'completist', 'should', 'only', 'rent', 'film']",N/A

Jaws is a classic, Jaws II is a strong, worthy sequel but this drek is just so pathetic. Though I must say it's nowhere near as bad as the notorious Jaws The Revenge.In the space of 5 years the Brody kids have gone from kids to total grown-ups. Dennis Quaid is Michael and he now works at Sea World (one would imagine he would have a fear of the water by now) in Florida. They've just opened up their Undersea Kingdom (y'know those glass tunnels) and ignorant park owner Calvin Bouchard (Academy Award winner Louis Gosset Jnr. at the start of his downward spiral) is so full of himself he doesn't even realize a massive Great White Shark has sneaked into the lagoon and plans to munch on divers, swimmers, skiers etc. Luckily for them a renegade naturalist (Simon MacCorkindale from TV's Casuality, looking EX-ACT-LEE like Thomas Jane) is hanging around to convince everyone that getting in the water to torment/trap/catch the poor beast is the best idea. His fate is firmly sealed as soon as he opens his mouth. Which is a bit of rip-off considering he risks his life many times through-out the film and Calvin Bouchard jeopardizes so many but escapes un-eaten.The shark coverage is down right terrible. The underwater photography sucks and is badly spliced with stock footage of sharks that look nothing like the clumsy foam rubber monster in the close-ups. The 3-D effects come off as the WORST you will ever see. Even in plain-old 2-D you can see that they were pretty much the most unimaginative and unsubtle attempts at reaching the audience ever. Even the 3-D tricks in Friday the 13th Part 3 were much more fun and natural than this.I first saw Jaws III on ITV years ago. It's best to see it on DVD as the 2.35:1 picture adds loads to the sides of the frame for those of you who suffered the pan and scan video. Plus there is a few extra gory shots that ITV and some video releases saw fit to censor. But the picture quality is real nasty with some dirty grainy scenes and annoyingly soft focus others. The sound is simple Dolby Stereo but don't expect any Oscar winning sound mixes this time. Even John Williams shark theme is all but vanished and some guy called Alan Parker's score is generic and unengaging.Extra feature(s) consist of a trailer (methinks originally in 3-D shown before Friday the 13 Part 3 began, in the previous summer). And then there's something Universal call 'Recommendations'. Click on it and what do you get? Still photos of the DVD covers of the other Jaws movies. Duh, thanks! The only interesting thing about this film is the fact that Sea World actually allowed their name and logo to be defamed in such a ludicrous way. Jaws may have been born into greatness but it died very, very quickly as a franchise. Now Jason Voorhees has lasted much, much, MUCH longer and the first Friday the 13th film was hardly a masterpiece.",1,The third dimension is awfulness,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,2887,"['Oh', 'dear', 'film', 'bad', 'Jaws', 'classic', 'Jaws', 'II', 'strong', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'drek', 'just', 'so', 'pathetic', 'must', 'say', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'notorious', 'Jaws', 'Revenge.In', 'space', '5', 'years', 'Brody', 'kids', 'have', 'gone', 'kids', 'total', 'grown-ups', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Michael', 'now', 'Sea', 'World', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'fear', 'water', 'now', 'Florida', ""'ve"", 'just', 'opened', 'up', 'Undersea', 'Kingdom', ""y'know"", 'glass', 'tunnels', 'ignorant', 'park', 'owner', 'Calvin', 'Bouchard', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Louis', 'Gosset', 'Jnr', 'start', 'downward', 'spiral', 'so', 'full', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'massive', 'Great', 'White', 'Shark', 'sneaked', 'lagoon', 'plans', 'munch', 'divers', 'swimmers', 'skiers', 'etc', 'Luckily', 'renegade', 'naturalist', 'Simon', 'MacCorkindale', 'TV', 'Casuality', 'looking', 'EX-ACT-LEE', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'hanging', 'around', 'convince', 'everyone', 'getting', 'water', 'torment/trap/catch', 'poor', 'beast', 'best', 'idea', 'fate', 'firmly', 'sealed', 'as', 'soon', 'mouth', 'Which', 'bit', 'rip-off', 'considering', 'risks', 'life', 'many', 'times', 'through-out', 'film', 'Calvin', 'Bouchard', 'so', 'many', 'un-eaten.The', 'shark', 'coverage', 'down', 'right', 'terrible', 'underwater', 'photography', 'sucks', 'badly', 'spliced', 'stock', 'footage', 'sharks', 'look', 'nothing', 'clumsy', 'foam', 'rubber', 'monster', 'close-ups', '3-D', 'effects', 'come', 'off', 'WORST', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Even', 'plain-old', '2-D', 'can', 'see', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'most', 'unimaginative', 'unsubtle', 'attempts', 'reaching', 'audience', 'ever', 'Even', '3-D', 'tricks', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '3', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'natural', 'this.I', 'first', 'saw', 'Jaws', 'III', 'ITV', 'years', 'ago', 'best', 'see', 'DVD', '2.35:1', 'picture', 'loads', 'sides', 'frame', 'who', 'suffered', 'pan', 'scan', 'video', 'few', 'extra', 'gory', 'shots', 'ITV', 'video', 'saw', 'fit', 'censor', 'picture', 'quality', 'real', 'nasty', 'dirty', 'grainy', 'scenes', 'annoyingly', 'soft', 'focus', 'others', 'sound', 'simple', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'sound', 'time', 'Even', 'John', 'Williams', 'shark', 'theme', 'vanished', 'guy', 'called', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'score', 'generic', 'unengaging.Extra', 'feature', 'consist', 'trailer', 'methinks', 'originally', '3-D', 'shown', 'Friday', '13', 'Part', '3', 'began', 'previous', 'summer', 'then', 'something', 'Universal', 'call', ""'Recommendations"", 'Click', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'Still', 'photos', 'DVD', 'covers', 'other', 'Jaws', 'movies', 'Duh', 'thanks', 'only', 'interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'fact', 'Sea', 'World', 'actually', 'allowed', 'name', 'logo', 'be', 'defamed', 'such', 'ludicrous', 'way', 'Jaws', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'greatness', 'died', 'very', 'very', 'quickly', 'franchise', 'Now', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'lasted', 'much', 'much', 'MUCH', 'longer', 'first', 'Friday', '13th', 'film', 'was', 'hardly', 'masterpiece']",N/A

The first one was simply a masterpiece, a work of art that was brought to audiences due to talent and hard work. The most memorable part of the movie was the section where you see the three guys go out into the ocean to kill the shark. Now how would they outdo that?Then came Jaws II, which was not really horrible but it was a movie that really didn't need to be made. THEN here comes the kicker... Jaws III. Basically, a killer shark gets into Sea World and, you guessed it, all hell breaks loose. The shark's baby ends up getting killed, which doesn't help matters any.So what's your point, you ask? Well, there's quite a bit of bad stuff in this. The type of main characters that are used are so cliche. There's the rough and hard-headed ""Sea World"" architect and there's the smart/attractive biology girlfriend. The movie supposedly uses some ""3D effects"" but all I saw was some rather crappy stuff that may or may not have been 3D. One example is the shark in some scenes. The shark looked god awful. Watch the part near the end where the shark hits the control room. You'll get my point. Also, the feeling that was in the first one was missing. You know what I'm talking about, that feeling of terror of the water that seemed to have been part of the first movie. Jaws 3 was just not scary at all. A shark attacking Sea World?! Come on! That's just as bad as Jason Vorhees attacking Manhatten!The only scene that I thought was good, and is why I gave this movie an extra star, is where the dude gets sucked into the shark's mouth.

Anyway, Mike Brody (older of the two sons, this time portrayed by Dennis Quaid) is now a marine biologist working at Sea World alongside his girlfriend, Catherine (played by the very beautiful Bess Armstrong).  Sean Brody (younger of the two sons) decides to come visit Mike and Catherine and, with a little help from park water skier Kelly, attempts to conquer his childhood fear of the water.  However, Sean's fears are soon realized as a giant, blood-thirsty great white shark makes its way into the park and begins feeding on its hapless patrons.  Eventually, things are brought to a rather &quot;explosive&quot; conclusion when Mike &quot;pulls the pin&quot; from a grenade that's been lodged in the shark's mouth.The things that really make this film work are the above average acting by an excellent cast, Alan Parker's exciting score (which actually does rival John Williams' original), and a very clever script written by Carl Gottlieb.  Another factor that makes the film so entertaining is simply the fact that it takes place at Sea World.Granted the special effects aren't what they were in the first two films, but they're certainly not bad and are much better than those featured in &quot;JAWS: The Revenge&quot;, the next film in the series.",5,CCCCCRRRRRUUUUUUNNNNNNNCCCCCCHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!,987033600,"04 12, 2001",2001,1606,"['Awesome', 'film', 'best', 'series', 'quot', 'JAWS', 'III', 'quot', 'quot', 'JAWS', '3-D', 'quot', 'up', 'where', 'quot', 'JAWS', '2', 'quot', 'left', 'off', 'sort', 'quot', '2', 'quot', 'was', 'originally', 'released', '1978', 'one', 'came', 'out', '1983', ""'m"", 'guessing', '5', 'years', 'supposedly', 'passed', 'two', 'films', 'reference', 'passage', 'time', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'Mike', 'Brody', 'older', 'two', 'sons', 'time', 'portrayed', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'now', 'marine', 'biologist', 'working', 'Sea', 'World', 'girlfriend', 'Catherine', 'played', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'Sean', 'Brody', 'younger', 'two', 'sons', 'come', 'visit', 'Mike', 'Catherine', 'little', 'help', 'park', 'water', 'skier', 'Kelly', 'conquer', 'childhood', 'fear', 'water', 'However', 'Sean', 'fears', 'are', 'soon', 'realized', 'giant', 'blood-thirsty', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'way', 'park', 'feeding', 'hapless', 'patrons', 'Eventually', 'things', 'are', 'brought', 'rather', 'quot', 'explosive', 'quot', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Mike', 'quot', 'pin', 'quot', 'grenade', 'been', 'lodged', 'shark', 'mouth.The', 'things', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'acting', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Alan', 'Parker', 'exciting', 'score', 'actually', 'rival', 'John', 'Williams', 'original', 'very', 'clever', 'script', 'written', 'Carl', 'Gottlieb', 'factor', 'film', 'so', 'entertaining', 'simply', 'fact', 'place', 'Sea', 'World.Granted', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'were', 'first', 'two', 'films', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'featured', 'quot', 'JAWS', 'Revenge', 'quot', 'next', 'film', 'series']",N/A

The 3D effects were just plain bad, the shark was so fake, the acting bad, and it was all just too far fetched to be believed.Although it was later established that the two male leads were the adult sons of Cheif Brody, I just got the impression they were just residents of Amity Island who were witness to the famous shark attacks.  Dennis Quaid works as an engineer at Sea World, and his girlfriend, Beth Armstrong, is a whale tranier / scientist.  There are lots of gals strolling around in spandex and headbands, otherwise you might not be able to place it timewise.  Also, I liked that one supervisor who told the hostess gals that their shorts were short enough and if they show any cheeks they will be put back behind the deep friers.  HA!  I guess that is a little indicative of the time, people tend to avoid the hot pants / Daisy Dukes these days.One day very suddenly a staff member is killed by a shark that came in through a gate left open, and they naturally get nervous.  Louis Gosset Jr. is the park manager, who, in typical corporate fashion, is more concerned about cutting costs and trying to keep everything running as smooth as possible.  As a result of corporate greed, corruption and being lazy and shiftless, all hell breaks loose as they realize the captured shark they had before (thanks to the efforts of the Aussie Dunee-esque adventure man who is later eaten) was just the baby and Big Mamma is in the park causing real problems.From there it all falls apart, storywise and effectwise.  Disaster after disaster results as Big Mamma destroys things in her path, eating water skiers, and even taking a chomp out of Lea Thompson further engrossing the younger Brody's neurosis about being in the water.  I bet that guy won't even get into the shower after that disaster.The 3D effects were what was supposed to make this great, and, like all 3D movies with or without the glasses it gives you a big headache.

If you thought things went down hill from the nail biting original thriller ""Jaws"" to the ridiculous teen flick ""Jaws 2"", then ""Jaws 3"" plumbs new depths of abysmal film making. Everything about this film is terrible....banal dialogue, overacting by the principal cast, totally absurd & moronic plot and utterly third rate special effects. Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr., & Lea Thompson should all strike this movie from their resume's as they all contribute shocking performances !Director Joe Alves ( the production designer for the first two ""Jaws"" movies ) made his directorial debut with this film, and he hasn't directed another film since...and based on this turkey, I wouldn't put him behind another camera either. The movie lacks any hint of suspense and is nothing more than a stupid 90 minute advertisement for Sea World and flipping dolphins and leaping killer whales. The paper thin plot sees the sons of Amity police chief , Martin Brody, pick up jobs at Florida's Sea World ( why couldn't they get jobs as rangers in the Rocky Mountains....no sharks up there ! ), where once again the Brody clan attracts giant great white sharks like flies to an outdoor picnic !Pandemonium breaks loose in the acquatic park as a 35 foot great white starts its own show for the tourists by eating the water ski team, shattering undersea walkways imprisoning the tourists, eating more stupid scuba divers and then plowing through a glass wall into the main control room, and nearly makes a meal of Quaid & Armstrong. The special effects with the shark breaking into the control room have to be seen to be believed.....they are so shabbily done it's just a joke. Want to know how bad the shark looks in this movie ??

202941,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6300183181,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Jaws 3-D (Joe Alves, 1983)During the 2012 edition of the Capitol Theatre's yearly horror-thon Twelve Hours of Terror, I got to see Universal's brand-new (as far as the cinema knew, it was the first theatrical showing in America) Real-D remaster of Jaws 3-D, commissioned as part of the Universal 100th Anniversary series of Blu-Ray discs. I was astonished--not by the realism of the 3-D, but by the fact that Universal would spend that much time, money, and effort on one of the crappiest movies ever made. Worse yet, thirty years later, it has aged very, very badly; my forty-three-year-old self saw a lot of flaws that my thirteen-year-old self missed.Plot: it's another beautiful day at Sea World. Or it soon will be, because Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett, Jr., who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman a mere five months before the release of this film) has just spent millions creating the Sea World Underwater Kingdom, a massive installation in a lagoon aimed at getting people under the actual sea so they can see the real habitat of all these fish, rather than having them under a big fish tank. Just before opening day, the entire crew is in a fever trying to get ready for the grand re-opening. Needless to say, there's a big shark hanging around to mess it up and throw any number of monkeywrenches into the plans of chief engineer Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid, whose recent run of stinkers obviously has a gold pedigree); marine biologist Kathy Morgan (Jekyll and Hyde...Together Again!`s Bess Armstrong), Mike's girlfriend; Sean (Skeeter`s John Putch), Mike's younger brother, still deathly afraid of the sea after the events of the first two films; and Kelly Ann (Back to the Future`s Lea Thompson in her feature debut), who takes to Sean like a duck to... well, you know. There's a subplot with a Richard Atttenborough-like nature show host (Death on the Nile`s Simon MacCorkindale)......but like the rest of the plot, it's secondary to the fact that this movie is an hour-and-a-half-long ad for Sea World. Did anyone stop to think that perhaps a movie about a killer shark that goes around eating people might not exactly cause the tourist dollars to flow? Obviously not, since the movie actually got released. And like most of the movies that appeared during the mercifully brief 3-D resuscitation that happened during the early eighties, they used the same ridiculous ""hey, look at what I'm doing with this technology!"" shots that act as nothing more than filler (hey, wow, that coral tentacle coming right out of the screen is cool!...for about five seconds, which is six times shorter than the shot itself lasts) one found in so many fifties 3-D movies without actually thinking about new applications of the technology; one of the reasons the newest 3-D fad has lasted so long is because directors are using it to make movies like Cave of Forgotten Dreams and Pina.Entirely ridiculous, though the appeal of a young Lea Thompson in short-shorts will be enough of a draw for some folks. **",2,Note: this is a review of the upcoming Universal 100th Anniversary Blu-Ray.

This movie, on the other hand, is like being tortured by a psychopathic shark-lover...at sea world! Who would ever think to incorporate SEA WORLD into the Jaws franchise??? Seriously, It was just a horrible idea! The whole, ""Mother Shark lost her baby shark"" scenario is just weird...I don't even think that Shark's raise there ""pups"" once they are born...they just swim away. Not that this is that much different than the plot in Jaws 2, where a ""relative"" shark of the first Jaws decides to go after Cheif Brody and his kids...cheesy, but still, more fun and overall a better storyline. This movie trods along at a slow pace and the 3-D graphics add a overly grainy, aged look to the film. The acting is horrendous. Dennis Quaid is OK, but everyone else is just plain awful.

202949,AP0R9UZK7W5UB,6300183181,Sandra L. Rigas,"[5, 7]","Out of all the Jaws films, Jaws 3 is my third favorite, it isn't as good as Jaws(the best) or Jaws 2 but is better than Jaws 4:The Revenge. Jaws 3 is different from the first two Jaws films because for one the story takes  place in Sea World  in Orlando and the acting talents of Roy Scheider are  missed, as the main characters are Mike and Sean Brody. This film also is a  bit more comical and not as dark-edged as its predecessors, which slightly  hurts the film. Dennis Quaid is very good as Mike Brody.The Sea World  setting is nice and I love the Undersea Kingdom, yet I like Amity Island  better. John Williams' theme is here, but his whole original score is  missed, and the music needs to be better. The cinematography is fairly  good, yet the  sound and editing of the previous Jaws films is sorely  missed (especially in the original, which won Oscars for both sound and  editing). The visual effects are cheesey, and though it is fascinating when  Jaws busts through the glass, the effects aren't very good. And if you  watch films like Star Wars: Return of the Jedi which received a Special  Achievement Award at the Oscars for Visual Effects, you'll see that films  in 1983 could have good visual effects.Also, I think Universal and  Steven Spielburg should re-release all the Jaws films on Special Edition  DVD and VHS in boxed sets with documentaries and behind-the-scenes looks,  remaster the sound and editing,update the visual effects, add new scenes,  and re-release them in theatres with 3-D effects the way Lucas and 2Oth  Century Fox did with Star Wars( yet lucas and Fox only put out Special  Edition VHS and theatres with no 3-D effects). It would be a real treat,  since I love the Jaws films (yet Jaws 4: The Revenge is only fair at best).Overall, Jaws III has some entertaining aspects such as the Sea World  settings, the comical touch, Mike and Sean Brody together, and the TWO  sharks, yet is not as good as the first two excellent Jaws films.",4,Jaws III,961372800,"06 19, 2000",2000,1974,"['Jaws', 'films', 'Jaws', '3', 'third', 'favorite', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Jaws', 'best', '2', 'better', '4', 'Revenge', 'Jaws', '3', 'different', 'first', 'two', 'Jaws', 'films', 'one', 'story', 'place', 'Sea', 'World', 'Orlando', 'acting', 'talents', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'are', 'missed', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Mike', 'Sean', 'Brody', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'comical', 'not', 'as', 'dark-edged', 'predecessors', 'slightly', 'film', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'very', 'good', 'Mike', 'Brody.The', 'Sea', 'World', 'setting', 'nice', 'love', 'Undersea', 'Kingdom', 'yet', 'like', 'Amity', 'Island', 'better', 'John', 'Williams', 'theme', 'here', 'whole', 'original', 'score', 'missed', 'music', 'be', 'better', 'cinematography', 'fairly', 'good', 'yet', 'sound', 'editing', 'previous', 'Jaws', 'films', 'sorely', 'missed', 'especially', 'original', 'won', 'Oscars', 'sound', 'editing', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'cheesey', 'fascinating', 'when', 'Jaws', 'glass', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'watch', 'films', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'received', 'Special', 'Achievement', 'Award', 'Oscars', 'Visual', 'Effects', ""'ll"", 'see', 'films', '1983', 'could', 'have', 'good', 'visual', 'effects.Also', 'think', 'Universal', 'Steven', 'Spielburg', 'should', 're-release', 'Jaws', 'films', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'boxed', 'sets', 'documentaries', 'behind-the-scenes', 'looks', 'remaster', 'sound', 'editing', 'update', 'visual', 'effects', 'add', 'new', 'scenes', 're-release', 'theatres', '3-D', 'effects', 'way', 'Lucas', '2Oth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'did', 'Star', 'Wars', 'yet', 'lucas', 'Fox', 'only', 'put', 'out', 'Special', 'Edition', 'VHS', 'theatres', '3-D', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'treat', 'love', 'Jaws', 'films', 'yet', 'Jaws', '4', 'Revenge', 'only', 'fair', 'best', '.Overall', 'Jaws', 'III', 'entertaining', 'aspects', 'such', 'Sea', 'World', 'settings', 'comical', 'touch', 'Mike', 'Sean', 'Brody', 'together', 'TWO', 'sharks', 'yet', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'excellent', 'Jaws', 'films']",N/A

Jaws 3, I believe, is one of the most underrated entries in the series. Sure it has some shoddy effects shots (due to the film originally being filmed in 3-D), but it is the most creative sequel; setting the story in a Florida Sea World.The film does have some great acting but some of the ""villains"" act quirky making the acting seem wooden.Besides the occasional quirky acting, The film (or actually, DVD), suffers from some bad shots due to certain scenes meant for 3-D. The thing that bothered me the most was, in some scenes, the picture seemed to ""jump"" a little. And some of the backgrounds were still fuzzy due to the crew cleaning up the 3-D shots. Those two things make it hard on one's eye to watch.Of course, there is the shark fact inaccuracies. Sure every Jaws film had them, but this one seemed to stretch it a little bit more than the first two. First off, a mother shark getting upset over her baby dying is out of touch. For one, parent sharks don't care for their young like other animals. In fact, if they can, they will even eat some of their young. Also, sharks cannot swim backwards. And there is no such thing, during modern times, that there is a 35 foot great white shark.All in all, Jaws 3, in my opinion, is the most creative sequel in the franchise. Apparently, some people think if you venture too far off the original forumla, the film won't work. You look at the history of film, some of the greatest films of all time are films that are drastically different from others. The film, though, does have its problems with a so-so story, erratic acting, jumpy shots, fuzzy backgrounds, and easily identitifiable special effects scenes.

Needless to say, you'll be rooting for the shark from the first frame.Just as you're thinking that the underwater picnic can't begin soon enough, a shark gobbles up a lone diver working on the gate between the lagoon and the open sea. When the victim fails to show up at home, his angry girlfriend is certain he's with another woman--""I tell you, the man's trash!""---but Quaid and ""senior biologist"" Armstrong fear something worse and set out in a submarine to investigate. Two pet dolphins follow along, apparently with the intention of proving that dolphins are smarter than people, for as Quaid and Armstrong leave the sub to swim around, the dolphins warn them of impending danger by shaking their heads back and forth. Sure enough, a shark suddenly lunges for them. Lacking fingers to shake at the foolish humans, the two dolphins rush over to Quaid and Armstrong and offer them rides to safety. For the second time, the shark fails to get them. Why? For one thing, it resembles a giant inflatable Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon and moves about as fast. To become this shark's dinner you'd practically have to swim into its mouth and throw yourself down its throat.Faced with the alarming prospect of a killer shark in an underwater theme park, Armstrong has an idea: trap the beast and turn it into an attraction. ""This is crazy!"" roars Quaid--the very words he failed to say to his agent after reading this script. Naturally, the troop goes hunting for the shark, and, naturally, the shark promptly attacks, but MacCorkindale deters it by conking it on the snout, about which we only say: don't try this at home. Inexplicably, the shark proves easy to capture and becomes an endearing pet. Finding Armstrong petting the shark in the tank, Quaid jealously jumps into the water, saying, ""If this is the only way we can be together!"" Armstrong primly hands him a plastic bottle with formula for the shark. It's a Jaws III-way. When the park opens to the public, nymphets in hot pants succeed where Quaid and Armstrong have failed--they come upon the shredded torso of the missing diver. Ever the aquatic professional, Quaid takes one look at the remains of his pal and barfs.Armstrong realizes... well, let her tell it: ""Our shark couldn't have killed him--its mother did!"" Yes, the captured shark's 35-foot great white mama is fiendishly racing around the lagoon, which is now filled with tasty tourists. After knocking people out of a boat and overturning bathers on a wooden raft, the killer shark simply scratches one person then politely stops. (Is it any wonder this movie was nicknamed Gums?) But things pick up when MacCorkindale cages the mama shark (don't ask) and then neglects to leave the cage himself. This allows for a genuinely laugh-out-loud shot of MacCorkindale's view from inside the shark looking out--a peak moment in sharkcam cinema. The body count begins to go up until the thing you've been waiting for finally happens--Armstrong gets attacked. Alas, Quaid rescues her before she can be safely devoured. Quaid then saves the day by detonating a hand grenade inside the shark--a fitting ending for this legendary bomb.",5,IT'S A SCREAM!!!,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,3874,"['Hollywood', 'forever', 'hell-bent', 'producing', 'contenders', 'dubious', 'honor', 'Most', 'Unnecessary', 'Sequel', 'Ever', 'awesome', 'new', 'entries', 'Speed', '2', 'Cruise', 'Control', 'Lost', 'World', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'crown', 'belong', 'Jaws', 'III.Whereas', 'unnecessary', 'sequel', 'Jaws', 'II', 'still', 'had', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'Jaws', 'III', 'now', 'grown-up', 'Brody', 'boys', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'John', 'Putch', 'Sea', 'World', 'theme', 'park', 'Florida', 'far', 'Amity', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'Quaid', 'unveil', 'mammoth', 'man-made', 'lagoon', 'attraction', 'guessed', 'will', 'quickly', 'become', 'shark-feeding', 'station', 'Now', 'rest', 'cast', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'Simon', 'MacCorkindale', 'Quaid', 'girlfriend', 'Bess', 'Armstrong', 'Needless', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rooting', 'shark', 'first', 'frame.Just', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'underwater', 'picnic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'soon', 'enough', 'shark', 'up', 'lone', 'diver', 'working', 'gate', 'lagoon', 'open', 'sea', 'When', 'victim', 'show', 'up', 'home', 'angry', 'girlfriend', 'certain', 'woman', 'tell', 'man', 'trash', '-but', 'Quaid', 'senior', 'biologist', 'Armstrong', 'fear', 'something', 'worse', 'set', 'out', 'submarine', 'investigate', 'Two', 'pet', 'dolphins', 'follow', 'along', 'apparently', 'intention', 'proving', 'dolphins', 'are', 'smarter', 'people', 'Quaid', 'Armstrong', 'leave', 'sub', 'swim', 'around', 'dolphins', 'warn', 'impending', 'danger', 'shaking', 'heads', 'back', 'forth', 'Sure', 'enough', 'shark', 'suddenly', 'Lacking', 'fingers', 'shake', 'foolish', 'humans', 'two', 'dolphins', 'rush', 'Quaid', 'Armstrong', 'offer', 'rides', 'safety', 'second', 'time', 'shark', 'get', 'Why', 'one', 'thing', 'giant', 'inflatable', 'Macy', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'Parade', 'balloon', 'moves', 'fast', 'become', 'shark', 'dinner', ""'d"", 'practically', 'have', 'swim', 'mouth', 'throw', 'down', 'throat.Faced', 'alarming', 'prospect', 'killer', 'shark', 'underwater', 'theme', 'park', 'Armstrong', 'idea', 'trap', 'beast', 'turn', 'attraction', 'crazy', 'Quaid', 'very', 'words', 'failed', 'say', 'agent', 'reading', 'script', 'Naturally', 'troop', 'hunting', 'shark', 'naturally', 'shark', 'promptly', 'MacCorkindale', 'deters', 'conking', 'snout', 'only', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'home', 'Inexplicably', 'shark', 'easy', 'capture', 'becomes', 'endearing', 'pet', 'Finding', 'Armstrong', 'petting', 'shark', 'tank', 'Quaid', 'jealously', 'water', 'saying', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'Armstrong', 'primly', 'plastic', 'bottle', 'formula', 'shark', 'Jaws', 'III-way', 'When', 'park', 'public', 'nymphets', 'hot', 'pants', 'succeed', 'where', 'Quaid', 'Armstrong', 'have', 'failed', 'come', 'shredded', 'torso', 'missing', 'diver', 'Ever', 'aquatic', 'professional', 'Quaid', 'one', 'look', 'remains', 'pal', 'barfs.Armstrong', 'realizes', 'well', 'let', 'tell', 'shark', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'killed', 'mother', 'did', 'Yes', 'captured', 'shark', '35-foot', 'great', 'white', 'mama', 'fiendishly', 'racing', 'lagoon', 'now', 'filled', 'tasty', 'tourists', 'knocking', 'people', 'boat', 'overturning', 'bathers', 'wooden', 'raft', 'killer', 'shark', 'simply', 'one', 'person', 'then', 'politely', 'wonder', 'movie', 'was', 'nicknamed', 'Gums', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'when', 'MacCorkindale', 'mama', 'shark', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'then', 'neglects', 'leave', 'cage', 'genuinely', 'laugh-out-loud', 'shot', 'MacCorkindale', 'view', 'shark', 'looking', 'out', 'peak', 'moment', 'sharkcam', 'cinema', 'body', 'count', 'go', 'up', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'finally', 'Armstrong', 'attacked', 'Alas', 'Quaid', 'can', 'be', 'safely', 'devoured', 'Quaid', 'then', 'day', 'detonating', 'hand', 'grenade', 'shark', 'fitting', 'ending', 'legendary', 'bomb']",N/A

Some people are just following what others are saying so they won't sound 'uncool' for saying they like it. Let's rewind for a minute or two back to when this movie came out. I saw this in the theatres and I can tell you people jumped during those 3-D shots the same way they did during Friday The 13th part 3 in 3-D! From the chewed off arm to the shark breaking the glass, the effects were not bad at all like most would have you believe.As for the movie itself, i thought it was pretty good. You have a shark that is in a lagoon that is scary enough. But towards the end when you see the mother shark's tale whip back and forth and break the gate open due to the force of the shark's strength your imagination let's you aleady wonder how big this shark is! You also have the shark hunter in this movie along with his partner that try to cage the shark up to begin with. You have big name stars like Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. joining the cast.Yes you have the stereotype 'must have' in every shark movie guy/girl relationship, the shark hunter, the weak character/brother, the businessman,etc. There are actually to many things going on in this movie in my opinion and I can go into negative things also like anyone else. But the bottom line is this movie has not one, but TWO big sharks. It also has some suspense to it like parts 1 and 2 with the shark coming up on it's victim from behind. And the idea of a big shark swimming around in a sea with an undergound see-though glass structure people are walking in just makes it that much better.It is NOT Jaws. Nothing will be even close to the first one. It is not Jaws 2 that many would agree is a worthy sequel and the truth is they could have stopped right there and that would be a good set to open/close with. But if you look at Jaws 3 as something other than a sequel and judge it by it's own..heck, pretend it has another name like maybe Shark Attack 5 or something and I am pretty sure you will think this movie is at least better than most have said Jaws 3 is.
