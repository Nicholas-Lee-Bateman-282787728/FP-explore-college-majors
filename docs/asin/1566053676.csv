184211,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,1566053676,Annie Van Auken,"[0, 0]","In 1973, WALKING TALL was huge summer box office stuff.It has since spawned sequels, a TV series and a remake (with 'The Rock').Lot of curious contradictions with this one. For example, at the outset we read that ""Walking Tall"" is based on the life of Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, yet when this violently bloody picture is over a new disclaimer says it's a work of fiction and any similarity to persons living or dead, blah blah blah...Also after Sheriff Buford (Joe Don Baker), who looks like a mummy in his gauze mask, crushes two mortal enemies with a Dodge police cruiser and a bonfire is held using the gambling club's furniture, he sheds a poignant tear as a more poignant Johnny Mathis warbles the movie's balladic theme song. This syrupy tune comes after TWO women (Elizabeth Hartman and Rosemary Murphy) get shot in the head, Pusser's chest is carved into shreds with a switchblade, a sheriff toasts to a crisp in a car crash, the family dog is murdered and Pusser's buddy is found bobbing in the lake like a lily pad.Ah yes, a nice family movie!THE STORY:Retired wrestler Buford Pusser returns to his small Tennessee town to find that it's changed for the worst. Moonshine still operators are rampant and a cheesy roadhouse called the LUCKY SPOT is a hotbed of crooks. To the unwary they offer loaded dice, slot machines that never pay and other fixed games, plus a backroom filled with illegal booze disguised as Jack Daniels.After Pusser catches a guy at the craps table with four dice in his hands, he's beaten, kicked and sliced up like a tomato. Once healed, Buford returns to the club with a huge stick and beats hell out of his attackers. Then he demands back the money his friend lost at the fixed crapgame, as well as payment for doctor bills (hundreds of stitches).He's arrested and tried for assault, strong-arm robbery and other crimes. Judge R.W. Clarke (Douglas Fowley) would love to see him convicted, and Buford's only witness mysteriously drowns, so he just may be found guilty at that. But Buford removes his shirt in the courtroom to show the jury what these thugs did to his chest (dozens of scars) and tells them they could be next. The jury acquits him of all charges.Buford decides to run against the town's corrupt sheriff and when intimidation doesn't deter him, Sheriff Al Thurman (Gene Evans) tries forcing our hero's car off the road. Thurman's cruiser instead careens down an embankment, crashes and burns. He doesn't survive, yet his cohorts at the Lucky Spot STILL run Thurman's ghost for re-election!Pusser campaigns and wins the sheriff job on a promise to clean up local corruption-- the Lucky Spot tops his list. With no help from a crooked judge and with an unknown on-the-take cop working at odds against him, Buford's task is no easy one.It's a well-done picture (that a certain useless film critic with the initials LM pooh-poohs), a bit on the bloody side true, but audiences *like* this honest country boy and root for him all the way.I recommend ""Walking Tall.""",4,"Buford: ""I got tired of being a trained animal in somebody else's circus.""",1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,3017,"['1973', 'WALKING', 'TALL', 'was', 'huge', 'summer', 'box', 'office', 'stuff.It', 'spawned', 'sequels', 'TV', 'series', 'remake', ""'The"", 'Rock', '.Lot', 'curious', 'contradictions', 'one', 'example', 'outset', 'read', 'Walking', 'based', 'life', 'Tennessee', 'sheriff', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'yet', 'when', 'violently', 'bloody', 'picture', 'new', 'disclaimer', 'work', 'fiction', 'similarity', 'persons', 'living', 'dead', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Also', 'Sheriff', 'Buford', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'who', 'mummy', 'gauze', 'mask', 'crushes', 'two', 'mortal', 'enemies', 'Dodge', 'police', 'cruiser', 'bonfire', 'held', 'using', 'gambling', 'club', 'furniture', 'poignant', 'tear', 'more', 'poignant', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'movie', 'balladic', 'theme', 'song', 'syrupy', 'tune', 'TWO', 'women', 'Elizabeth', 'Hartman', 'Rosemary', 'Murphy', 'get', 'shot', 'head', 'Pusser', 'chest', 'carved', 'shreds', 'switchblade', 'sheriff', 'crisp', 'car', 'crash', 'family', 'dog', 'murdered', 'Pusser', 'buddy', 'found', 'bobbing', 'lake', 'lily', 'pad.Ah', 'yes', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'THE', 'STORY', 'Retired', 'wrestler', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'small', 'Tennessee', 'town', 'find', 'changed', 'worst', 'Moonshine', 'still', 'operators', 'are', 'rampant', 'cheesy', 'roadhouse', 'called', 'LUCKY', 'SPOT', 'hotbed', 'crooks', 'unwary', 'offer', 'loaded', 'dice', 'slot', 'machines', 'never', 'pay', 'other', 'fixed', 'games', 'backroom', 'filled', 'illegal', 'booze', 'disguised', 'Jack', 'Daniels.After', 'Pusser', 'guy', 'craps', 'table', 'four', 'dice', 'hands', 'beaten', 'kicked', 'sliced', 'up', 'tomato', 'Once', 'healed', 'Buford', 'club', 'huge', 'stick', 'beats', 'hell', 'attackers', 'Then', 'back', 'money', 'friend', 'lost', 'fixed', 'crapgame', 'as', 'well', 'payment', 'doctor', 'bills', 'hundreds', 'stitches', '.He', 'arrested', 'tried', 'assault', 'strong-arm', 'robbery', 'other', 'crimes', 'Judge', 'R.W', 'Clarke', 'Douglas', 'Fowley', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'convicted', 'Buford', 'only', 'witness', 'mysteriously', 'drowns', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'Buford', 'shirt', 'courtroom', 'show', 'jury', 'what', 'thugs', 'did', 'chest', 'dozens', 'scars', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'jury', 'charges.Buford', 'run', 'town', 'corrupt', 'sheriff', 'when', 'intimidation', ""n't"", 'deter', 'Sheriff', 'Al', 'Thurman', 'Gene', 'Evans', 'forcing', 'hero', 'car', 'road', 'Thurman', 'cruiser', 'instead', 'down', 'embankment', 'crashes', 'burns', ""n't"", 'survive', 'yet', 'cohorts', 'Lucky', 'Spot', 'STILL', 'run', 'Thurman', 'ghost', 're-election', 'Pusser', 'campaigns', 'sheriff', 'job', 'promise', 'clean', 'up', 'local', 'corruption', 'Lucky', 'Spot', 'list', 'help', 'crooked', 'judge', 'unknown', 'on-the-take', 'cop', 'working', 'odds', 'Buford', 'task', 'easy', 'one.It', 'well-done', 'picture', 'certain', 'useless', 'film', 'critic', 'initials', 'LM', 'pooh-poohs', 'bit', 'bloody', 'side', 'true', 'audiences', '*like*', 'honest', 'country', 'boy', 'root', 'way.I', 'recommend', 'Walking', 'Tall']",N/A
184212,A1IBC9XP2LICQL,1566053676,A. Wolverton,"[33, 36]","&quot;Walking Tall&quot; is the story of Buford Pusser, the tall, no-nonsense Tennessee sheriff who fought a tremendous up-hill battle to clean up his hometown.  The movie is (sometimes loosely) based on several events which happened to the real Sheriff Pusser in his pursuit of justice.  The film seeks to describe (sometimes graphically) the personal price that Pusser paid to rid his town of corruption, not just at the gambling house, but in the courtroom as well.I was surprised how well the film has held up 20+ years later.  While definitely not a great film, the story is an exciting, but violent tale of corruption and the man trying to stop it.  The film will probably lead a lot of people to find out more about Buford Pusser, especially to learn which parts of the film are true and which are fiction.I was fortunate enough to hear Pusser speak just months before he died.  If you can imagine it, the real Pusser was even tougher looking and larger than the actor (Joe Don Baker) who portrayed him.  He looked like he could take apart a pro football player without halfway trying.  In his speech, Pusser was quick to point out what was accurate and inaccurate in the film, what he was pleased with and what he was disappointed with.  He pretty much stuck to the facts and didn't try to play on the emotions of the crowd.  But he had one of those faces that you could look into and tell that he had been through all the hell that you see in the film and more, and was still walking tall.  He left me with the feeling that he was still not going to turn away as corruption was taking over his town.  He knew the cost and he was willing to do whatever it takes.  One reviewer (probably rightfully so) mentioned that Pusser's methods WERE often out of line.  His behavior may have been wrong, but his intent was not.",3,Hollywood vs. Reality,994636800,"07 9, 2001",2001,1824,"['quot', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'quot', 'story', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'tall', 'no-nonsense', 'Tennessee', 'sheriff', 'who', 'fought', 'tremendous', 'up-hill', 'battle', 'clean', 'up', 'hometown', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'loosely', 'based', 'several', 'events', 'happened', 'real', 'Sheriff', 'Pusser', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'film', 'describe', 'sometimes', 'graphically', 'personal', 'price', 'Pusser', 'paid', 'rid', 'town', 'corruption', 'not', 'just', 'gambling', 'house', 'courtroom', 'well.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'held', 'up', '20+', 'years', 'later', 'definitely', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'story', 'exciting', 'violent', 'tale', 'corruption', 'man', 'trying', 'stop', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'lead', 'lot', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'especially', 'learn', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'true', 'are', 'fiction.I', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'hear', 'Pusser', 'speak', 'just', 'months', 'died', 'can', 'imagine', 'real', 'Pusser', 'was', 'even', 'tougher', 'looking', 'larger', 'actor', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'who', 'portrayed', 'looked', 'could', 'take', 'apart', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'halfway', 'trying', 'speech', 'Pusser', 'was', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'accurate', 'inaccurate', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'pleased', 'what', 'was', 'disappointed', 'pretty', 'much', 'stuck', 'facts', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'play', 'emotions', 'crowd', 'had', 'one', 'could', 'look', 'tell', 'had', 'been', 'hell', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'was', 'still', 'walking', 'tall', 'left', 'feeling', 'was', 'still', 'not', 'going', 'turn', 'away', 'corruption', 'was', 'taking', 'over', 'town', 'knew', 'cost', 'was', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'One', 'reviewer', 'probably', 'rightfully', 'so', 'mentioned', 'Pusser', 'methods', 'WERE', 'often', 'line', 'behavior', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'intent', 'was', 'not']",N/A

I originally saw this movie as a new release at the drive-in as a child. My dad was a deputy sheriff, and he eagerly awaited the story of Buford Pusser...the legendary, Tennessee lawman. We were not disappointed. Parts of the story were dramatized for the movie, but much of it actually happened to Sheriff Pusser. Some of the violence depicted in the film is quite accurate. The story is gripping and inspiring. This is an important story for Americans to know. Joe Don Baker was an excellent pick for the part of Pusser.My family didn't really know what was going on in the Tennessee hills until that seventies night at the drive-in.

""Walking Tall"" is the mostly true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser (Joe Don Baker), who, upon being elected sheriff of McNairy County, TN, attempts to clean up the rampant corruption in the county, only to be followed, shot at, and severely beaten on numerous occasions. (His wife loses her life as a result of one attempt to ambush his car.) Although some of the scenes are fictionalized, the entire movie is based on true incidents that took place during Pusser's tenure as sheriff.The movie contains a considerable amount of graphic violence, and I would not recommend it for the faint of heart or for younger children. However, if you can put up with the violence (including at least a couple of the most violent scenes I have ever seen on the screen), this is a compelling story of a truly courageous man.

Low budget films taking place in the South consisting of car chases, fist fights, coarse language and even a boob shot here and there. Films like Max Baer's (yes, that's Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies!)""Macon County Line"", Roger Corman's ""Jackson County Jail"" among others fell into this genre.But the undesputed king of these Roughies was Walking Tall. Very loosely based on the exploits of real life Tennesee sheriff Buford Pusser, the story tells of a one man battle against corruption. Joe Don Baker gives a career-making (although one note) performance as the club wielding lawman ready to bash heads of anyone who gets in the way.First he gets sliced up at a casino and lives, later he's shot in the face and lives, then he's shot all over the place by machine guns and still lives! Rasputin eat your heart out! Got to be a special kind of lawman to endure that! The film has it's share of grisly violence but no sex, just a few boob shots.The film was a box-office sensation raking in about $17 million and made on a shoestring budget.

This is what I would call a ""good"" action movie.  It's full of violence, yes, but the violence is not the main feature of the film.  The primary themes are decency, honor and community, and the lengths one must go to in their defense.Joe Don Baker plays Buford Pusser, a simple but good-hearted man who has been both a Mariane and a pro wrestler, and is now returning home to Tennessee to start a new life with his wife and kids.  Upon arriving he is dragged into a seedy local bar brimming with illegal gambling and hookers.  He is assaulted after confronting the owners with the loaded dice they use in their crap games and ends up nearly dead and dropped on the side of the highway.Pusser's life is saved, but the criminals stole his car and the cash he had on him.  He tries the local sheriff, but soon finds out that he is owned by the bar owners, who themselves are tied in with organized crime.  In fact the bar is only a small part of a local ""sin city"" that resembles a miniature Las Vegas, only far more sleazy and corrupt.Pusser's solution: he finds a large,solid tree branch, shaves off the bark and whittles it into an oversized baseball bat, and returns to the bar.  After beating the living Hell out of the thugs who run it, he takes enough money from it's coffers to cover the cost of his vehicle, his stolen cash and his doctor's bills - nothing more.This sets the stage for a struggle between Pusser and the local criminal plus the corrupt sheriff that occupies the rest of the movie.  Pusser eventually is elected sheriff himself and sets out to clean up the town.  He pays a terrible price for his devotion to his ideals, as does his family.  The film's end is bitter-sweet, a reflection on both what he achieves as well as what he loses.This movie will make you shout, cheer, reflect and weep.  I dinged it one star because it was shot on a tiny budget and that shows.  Joe Don Baker is a little over the top at times, and many of the scenes seemed to have been rushed through by the film crew.

184231,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,1566053676,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","I saw it when it came out, in Dunn North Carolina, mind you, in the new cinema complex that had just open in the new shopping mall that had started opening in 1970 (I bought a tie there, the tie of Campbell community college next door, in 1970). I thought it was interesting, fascinating, but maybe slightly extreme. I have not changed my mind. But what is it about? A man coming back to his birth place and his family, along with his wife, their two kids and their dog, a birth place they decide to call home, in Tennessee. I have seen that pattern so often like in ""Sometimes they come back"" by Stephen King. He is at once, on the very second day, face to face with the perversion prohibition can produce. The county, or at least the city, is anti-alcohol, anti-prostitution, anti-gambling, and what had to happen happens. Just beyond the county limits a bar cum bordello cum gambling hall opens and attracts the males of the county who want to be ripped of their money by cheating game masters, of their soberness by moonshine whisky unduly called Daniels and of their kinky dreams  by trailer female visitors, go and have a good time. But this business is of course in the hands of hard traffickers, of some organized crime at least at the level of the whole state and anyone who opposes it is dead meat, but after it has been severely tenderized. Our hero decides to run as sheriff against the rotten one who is in place and the rotten racist local judge who is covering the whole business. And then it is the story of how he will learn how to do things, how to integrate a black man in his team, how to inspire courage and fight corruption, how to bust the faade of these traffickers, bust the heads of a couple as soon as they draw a weapon, and finally inspire the people to build a posse and go out for the Lucky Spot of their dreams and burn it down. True of course, but too extreme. Things never happen that way. It takes time, a lot of time, to move public opinion, particularly in a small town. It takes time and finesse to trick and trap mafia criminals. It takes time and patience to trick and trip a judge who has so much power in his hands. But in 1973 it was a sign on the road away from the good old silent majority. The very first step on a very long way that is just coming ripe right now, maybe, and the silent majority might finally get some voice and shout ""Yes We can"" to their desire for ""the change they need"". Will that be a landslide or a tottering stumble? The film seems to believe that such radical change is possible once the fruit is ripe. Yet it does not show the ripening of the fruit, just the plucking.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,Will that promise of people power come true ?,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,2776,"['saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Dunn', 'North', 'Carolina', 'mind', 'new', 'cinema', 'complex', 'had', 'just', 'open', 'new', 'shopping', 'mall', 'had', 'started', 'opening', '1970', 'bought', 'tie', 'there', 'tie', 'Campbell', 'community', 'college', 'next', 'door', '1970', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'maybe', 'slightly', 'extreme', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'mind', 'what', 'man', 'coming', 'back', 'birth', 'place', 'family', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'dog', 'birth', 'place', 'decide', 'call', 'home', 'Tennessee', 'have', 'seen', 'pattern', 'so', 'often', 'Sometimes', 'come', 'back', 'Stephen', 'King', 'once', 'very', 'second', 'day', 'face', 'face', 'perversion', 'prohibition', 'can', 'produce', 'county', 'least', 'city', 'anti-alcohol', 'anti-prostitution', 'anti-gambling', 'had', 'happen', 'happens', 'Just', 'county', 'bar', 'cum', 'bordello', 'cum', 'gambling', 'hall', 'opens', 'males', 'county', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'ripped', 'money', 'cheating', 'game', 'masters', 'soberness', 'moonshine', 'whisky', 'unduly', 'called', 'Daniels', 'kinky', 'dreams', 'trailer', 'female', 'visitors', 'go', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'business', 'course', 'hands', 'hard', 'traffickers', 'organized', 'crime', 'least', 'level', 'whole', 'state', 'anyone', 'who', 'dead', 'meat', 'been', 'severely', 'tenderized', 'hero', 'run', 'sheriff', 'rotten', 'one', 'who', 'place', 'rotten', 'racist', 'local', 'judge', 'who', 'covering', 'whole', 'business', 'then', 'story', 'how', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'things', 'how', 'integrate', 'black', 'man', 'team', 'how', 'inspire', 'courage', 'fight', 'corruption', 'how', 'bust', 'faade', 'traffickers', 'bust', 'heads', 'couple', 'as', 'soon', 'draw', 'weapon', 'finally', 'inspire', 'people', 'build', 'posse', 'go', 'out', 'Lucky', 'Spot', 'dreams', 'burn', 'down', 'True', 'course', 'too', 'extreme', 'Things', 'never', 'happen', 'way', 'time', 'lot', 'time', 'move', 'public', 'opinion', 'particularly', 'small', 'town', 'time', 'finesse', 'trick', 'trap', 'mafia', 'criminals', 'time', 'patience', 'trick', 'trip', 'judge', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'hands', '1973', 'was', 'sign', 'road', 'away', 'good', 'old', 'silent', 'majority', 'very', 'first', 'step', 'very', 'long', 'way', 'just', 'coming', 'ripe', 'right', 'now', 'maybe', 'silent', 'majority', 'might', 'finally', 'get', 'voice', 'shout', 'can', 'desire', 'change', 'need', 'Will', 'be', 'landslide', 'tottering', 'stumble', 'film', 'believe', 'such', 'radical', 'change', 'possible', 'once', 'fruit', 'ripe', 'not', 'show', 'ripening', 'fruit', 'just', 'plucking.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

184233,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,1566053676,Jeffrey Leach,"[26, 26]","In the 1960s a man emerged who wasn't afraid to stand up and face down organized crime. He was a former marine turned wrestler turned sheriff who decided to clean up his little corner of Tennessee the best way he knew how: with a very big pine stick and a whole lot of gumption. He swept through the county like a firestorm, blowing up illegal liquor stills and closing down dens of iniquity without batting an eye. The decent people loved him and supported his actions, but the targets of his raids wouldn't go down without a fight. They shot this man on at least eight different occasions, stabbed him, attacked his home and his family, and eventually killed his wife. Still, he wouldn't back down. Of course I'm talking about legendary lawman and American tough guy Buford Pusser, and the movie is the just as legendary ""Walking Tall."" They ""remade"" this picture a year or two ago into a laughable PG-13 kiddie version starring a professional wrestler, but if you want to see the real deal you need to check out the DVD version of the original 1973 masterpiece starring Joe Don Baker. Here's a film that redefines the term ""gritty.""The film opens with Pusser, his wife Pauline (Elizabeth Hartman), and two kids (one played by Leif Garrett!) heading back to Buford's childhood home to settle down for good. Life on the road working as a professional wrestler apparently isn't all its cracked up to be, what with having to jump when others say jump and throw a match when told to do so. Right from the start we learn that Buford Pusser is his own man, or at least he desperately wants to be. So he acquires the property of a deceased moonshiner with the help of his father Carl (Noah Beery Jr.) and sets about earning a living running a timber mill. His wife is ecstatic, Buford is just as cheery, and his parents are happy to have their boy home. Then tragedy--the first in what will soon be a long string of them--hits with the subtlety of a knee to the crotch. Buford hooks up with a childhood friend named Lutie McVeigh (Ed Call) for an afternoon of fun. It soon becomes apparent that the town is quite different from the place Pusser fondly remembers. A saloon called the Lucky Spot now sits on the outskirts of town, a saloon with gambling tables in the back and scads of mobile homes outside packed with harridans openly plying their trade. Pusser doesn't like the looks of things, and likes it even less when a he's nearly killed after a fight breaks out over a gambling cheat.What follows moves as fast as a swallow of moonshine through your digestive tract. Pusser engages in a war of attrition with the folks running the saloon, runs into trouble with crooked sheriff Al Thurman (Gene Evans) and the even more corrupt judge R.W. Clarke (Douglas Fowley), and eventually ends up running for county sheriff on a campaign to clean up the town. Needless to say he wins the election and immediately begins to crack skulls. There are a few problems at first, such as learning that you need warrants before walking onto someone's property and busting them, but Pusser slowly learns what he needs to know. He even strong arms Judge Clarke into giving him the authority to raid the crime dens in a hilarious scene that by itself provides enough reason for watching the movie. Beyond this humorous sequence there is little to laugh about in ""Walking Tall."" The movie is loaded with bloody fight scenes, car chases, murders, a dead dog, and lots of genuine southern atmosphere. Some call ""Walking Tall"" a prime example of hicksploitation; I call it a blast of a film that holds up well over thirty years after it played in theaters. Its impact will last a heckuva lot longer than the version starring The Rock.Apparently the filmmakers took some liberties with certain details of Buford Pusser's real life. Probably so, but who cares? Call it dramatic license. Whatever the case, ""Walking Tall"" is a film loaded with great performances. Joe Don Baker makes you want to stand up and cheer as he cracks heads, breaks bones, and generally sticks it to the bad guys every chance he gets. He's authentic, brutal, and likable all at the same time. In fact, every actor and actress in this film does a great job, even the ones who didn't go on to do anything else. That's quite rare for the world of low budget filmmaking when you consider most actors in these things have all the allure of cigar store Indians. But even better than the performances are the actions sequences. The stuff we see in ""Walking Tall"" is downright brutal. When people take a punch or a kick they actually bleed and end up wearing bandages or casts. Pusser spends a significant portion of the film recuperating from the various injuries he receives in his battles. This realism makes the movie far more appealing than many potboiler actioners.It's important to make a few comments about the DVD version of this film. First, there are no extras on the disc: no commentary tracks, no trailers, no behind the scenes footage or featurettes, nothing to add depth to the viewing experience. That stinks. Second, and far worse, is the picture transfer. It looks like the company responsible for bringing this classic to disc merely copped the picture from a second generation VHS dupe. The most notable problem is color fading, but the whole movie looks quite poor. ""Walking Tall"" is a classic fully deserving of an in-depth restoration, and I for one hope it receives this treatment soon. Nevertheless, it's still worth watching if you haven't seen it. Go out and rent it today.",5,"Movie fantastic, DVD transfer poor",1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,5541,"['1960s', 'man', 'emerged', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'stand', 'up', 'face', 'down',

His Mom and Dad are happy about his decision along with his own family.  Now they can settle down and live like normal people out in the beautiful Tennessee countryside.  But, of course, that's not how it turns out.  He goes into town and runs into an old football buddy from high school who takes him just outside town and introduces him to one of the new businesses, ""The Lucky Spot"".  Here there is plenty to drink, gambling in the back room, and ladies of the evening that will entertain you in trailors parked off to the side.  His buddy blows a 10 spot at the craps table and Buford loans him more.  But Buford decides to bring a halt to this and get his money back.  Naturally, this is met with resistance.  After taking on about 5 or 6 guys Buford is finally restrained and they ""show [him] who runs things around here"".  Buford is dumped on a lonely road and left to die but he survives, recovers and decides to settle the score.  This sets the tone of the movie. Buford runs for sheriff and gets elected and decides he's going to clean up the place and naturally, this also meets with resistance.  Brenda Benet (Lu Ann) is one of the girls who works at the Lucky Spot.  Women don't get any sexier than Brenda.  She helps Buford out because she has a soft spot for ""big, strong, good lookin' ex-marines"".

Buford the Bull, a pro wrestler who is disenchanted with the crooked sport and who decides to settle down in his home town in rural Tennessee. Home is not the way he remembers it, though. There is a hint of corruption in the air.This does not matter overly much to Buford until it affects him personally. When the local thugs, working for the local moonshiners and madam, work him over and leave him for dead, he decides that he has had enough. He doesn't get a gun, his wife does not like guns. Instead, when he recovers, he gets a big piece of oak, heads over to the roadhouse where all the problems are and proceeds to kick everyone's collective butt. That lands him in jail.When the trial comes about, it's a pretty open and shut case. Even Buford admits that he did the violence. It looks like he is going to be convicted until he fires his lawyer, makes an impassioned plea on his own behalf, shows the jury his scars and promises that if he is acquitted, he will run for sheriff and clean up the town. He gets off and then proceeds to clean things up.The problem is that the crooks don't want to be cleaned up. They fight him and even threaten his family. That makes it personal for Buford. He cleans them up anyway but has to endure a fair amount of grief in the process. Throughout it all, he relies only on speaking softly and carrying a BIG stick.This is not highbrow.

Soon after his arrival PUSSER runs into serious troubles, when an argument at the local watering hole/gambling joint/brothel over cheating at a dice game escalates and the baddies beat him to a pulp, use a switchblade on him, steal his station wagon and leave him for dead beside a country road. PUSSER is a very tough guy, though, and survives. Because the corrupt sheriff is not much help, he takes law into his own hands. Armed with a long thick wooden stick he returns to the baddies' establishment and deals out some good old DIY justice very generously. After being aquitted for assault charges and fed up with the corrupt local authorities he decides to run for sheriff to fight the backwood gangsters more efficiently. Our hero has to stand his ground, deal with an incompetent county judge and a traitor in the police force, survive several assassination attempts, find moonshine bootleggers (whose poisonous booze killed several thirsty blacks) and blow up their backyard distillery, while the local mob gets ever more ferocious at this brave man whom they can neither bribe nor kill...An oldfashioned film in the best sense of the word WALKING TALL makes for compelling viewing. It is amazing that it is based on true facts! If only half of what I've read about the real Buford PUSSER is true his exploits surpass those of Bruce WILLIS' character in the DIE HARD movies! The real sheriff PUSSER was beaten to a pulp, shot, stabbed and run over by a car several times. Like in the movies his weapon of choice was a big wooden stick he used with bone-crunching results on the local backwood baddies! (Admittedly - and I do not want to mock either the real sheriff PUSSER or the movie - it looks a bit odd to see the lawman walking around with his big club, almost a little caveman-like. Additionally, the plaster Joe Don BAKER is wearing on his face in the last scenes of the movie is also a bit unintentionally funny. It does not distract too much however.)Personally I found this story of a man who could not take it any longer and who stood up against the crime and the filth in his community against overwhelming odds and with little regard for the risks, very entertaining and inspiring.The film is also at times very touching, like when PUSSER and his family cry over the loss of their family pet dog (which was shot during a shoot-out with a mob hitman). Acting is uniformly very good, particularly Joe Don BAKER - this man always has a great screen presence.Despite the violence (and make no mistake: this is not the sanitized fun comic book violence of Hollywood's contemporary output) it is a good movie to watch with the whole family.Shame on the DVD however! While overall perfectly watchable and admittedly cheap, it suffers from its fullscreen presentation.

184243,ALD1CRUBY1365,1566053676,R. L. MILLER,"[2, 2]","Last night I saw on the local news a story about a local cop who got busted for trafficking in stolen goods--to wit, Bluetooth units that ""fell off the back if the truck"". This news item probably got guys I know who can't say the word ""cop"" without the prefix ""dirty"" nodding their heads knowingly. Usually because they get hassled for holding weed. This morning I woke up with this film's tear-producing end credits song by Johnny Mathis in my head. Talk about contrasts! I was just all over the internet trying to find a download of it. No dice. I don't even know what Mathis album it's on. So I ended up here, looking for the flick itself on DVD, and found it. One dilemma solved, soon as it shows up.This movie is one my ex dragged me to during the 1970s when it was in theatrical release, and unlike her, it stuck with me. As more than one apparently older reviewer has already pointed out, it's a clash between traditional definitions of law and order and the ""new freedom"", which has gotten awfully old over the intervening decades. Today it's next to impossible to bring criminals to justice, what with special interest pressure groups and legal technicalities. So now we have news stories like I mentioned earlier. This movie, though, represents to me a better time when a dedicated lawman could clean up a town without becoming the enemy to an ungrateful citizenry. I'm not going to go into too much detail and re-cover ground that other reviewers already have covered. True story--Buford Pusser, retired wrestler, becomes sheriff of his home Tennesee county and finds the place a cesspool of vice. So he takes matters into his own two hands. In the form of a huge club that looks like a homemade baseball bat. He gets a lot of resistance from ""legit"" types who've turned a blind eye to it. Not to mention organized criminals who provide the deadly muscle. End of story, with that Johnny Mathis song over the closing credits. One point of order, though. At least one reviewer referred to it as ""vigilante justice"", in the same spirit that the same type of reviewers did with Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" movies. Reality check--time out! Both Pusser and the fictional Dirty Harry were officers of the law, not some angry unreasonable civilian taking the law into his own hands. We don't need another Dirty Harry, in a time when lawlessness and thuggery have even affected police. But Pusser was real, and God's got him now. Tennesee's loss, and our loss as well. Anyhow, this film spawned two sequels, plus a remake starring Dwayne Johnson that I'm not going to bother with--the story isn't even close to the one told here. As for the sequels, the star of this film--Joe Don Baker--was replaced inadequately by Bo Svenson, who I never saw again in any other vehicle. Both films are very anticlimactic. As for Baker, he went on to star in ""To Kill a Cop"", based on the Robert Daley novel, which spawned a not-great-but-not-too-bad TV series (""Eischeid"") built on Baker's character. The last time I saw him on the screen was in the Bond franchise, where he played two different roles--a bad guy in ""Living Daylights"" and a Bond buddy in ""Goldeneye"".",5,Yesterday's Lawman Compared To Today's Model,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,3152,"['Last', 'night', 'saw', 'local', 'news', 'story', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'got', 'busted', 'trafficking', 'stolen', 'goods', 'wit', 'Bluetooth', 'units', 'fell', 'off', 'back', 'truck', 'news', 'item', 'probably', 'got', 'guys', 'know', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'cop', 'prefix', 'dirty', 'nodding', 'heads', 'knowingly', 'Usually', 'get', 'hassled', 'holding', 'weed', 'morning', 'woke', 'up', 'film', 'tear-producing', 'end', 'credits', 'song', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'head', 'Talk', 'contrasts', 'was', 'just', 'internet', 'trying', 'find', 'download', 'dice', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'Mathis', 'ended', 'up', 'here', 'looking', 'flick', 'DVD', 'found', 'One', 'dilemma', 'solved', 'soon', 'up.This', 'movie', 'one', 'ex', 'dragged', '1970s', 'when', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'stuck', 'more', 'one', 'apparently', 'older', 'reviewer', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'clash', 'traditional', 'definitions', 'law', 'order', 'new', 'freedom', 'gotten', 'awfully', 'old', 'intervening', 'decades', 'Today', 'next', 'impossible', 'bring', 'criminals', 'justice', 'what', 'special', 'interest', 'pressure', 'groups', 'legal', 'technicalities', 'So', 'now', 'have', 'news', 'stories', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'movie', 'though', 'better', 'time', 'when', 'dedicated', 'lawman', 'could', 'clean', 'up', 'town', 'becoming', 'enemy', 'ungrateful', 'citizenry', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 're-cover', 'ground', 'other', 'reviewers', 'already', 'have', 'covered', 'True', 'story', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'retired', 'wrestler', 'sheriff', 'home', 'Tennesee', 'county', 'place', 'cesspool', 'vice', 'matters', 'own', 'two', 'hands', 'form', 'huge', 'club', 'homemade', 'baseball', 'bat', 'lot', 'resistance', 'legit', 'types', 'who', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'blind', 'eye', 'Not', 'mention', 'organized', 'criminals', 'who', 'provide', 'deadly', 'muscle', 'End', 'story', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'song', 'closing', 'credits', 'One', 'point', 'order', 'though', 'least', 'one', 'reviewer', 'referred', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'same', 'spirit', 'same', 'type', 'reviewers', 'did', 'Eastwood', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movies', 'Reality', 'check', 'time', 'out', 'Pusser', 'fictional', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'were', 'officers', 'law', 'not', 'angry', 'unreasonable', 'civilian', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'time', 'when', 'lawlessness', 'thuggery', 'have', 'even', 'affected', 'police', 'Pusser', 'was', 'real', 'God', 'got', 'now', 'Tennesee', 'loss', 'loss', 'as', 'well', 'Anyhow', 'film', 'spawned', 'two', 'sequels', 'remake', 'starring', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bother', 'story', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'one', 'told', 'here', 'sequels', 'star', 'film', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'was', 'replaced', 'inadequately', 'Bo', 'Svenson', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'again', 'other', 'vehicle', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'anticlimactic', 'Baker', 'went', 'star', 'Kill', 'Cop', 'based', 'Robert', 'Daley', 'novel', 'spawned', 'not-great-but-not-too-bad', 'TV', 'series', 'Eischeid', 'built', 'Baker', 'character', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'screen', 'was', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'where', 'played', 'two', 'different', 'roles', 'bad', 'guy', 'Living', 'Daylights', 'Bond', 'buddy', 'Goldeneye']",N/A

184245,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,1566053676,Robert Morris,"[11, 11]","As I watched this film again recently, I reacted to it almost the same way I did when I first saw it 30 years ago: Joe Don Baker's performance as sheriff Buford Pusser dominates it from beginning to end. There really are no ""gray"" cats in the small town in Tennessee's ""alley"" as Pusser reacts creatively, at times violently to the widespread corruption around him. Because he is such a serious threat to those responsible for the corruption (within and beyond the town), he is constantly in harm's way, as are his loved ones and the honest men who ""walk tall"" with him. This time around, however, I appreciated even more Elizabeth Hartman's understated (hence more credible) performance as Pusser's wife Pauline. This is one of the most influential of modern (i.e. post 1960) Good Guys versus Bad Guys films. There is absolutely no confusion about who is which. Like Willie Stark in an earlier film, All the King's Men (1949), Pusser gains public office to oppose more effectively the evil he observes around him. Unlike Stark, he is uncorrupted by it. Director Phil Karlson manages to walk a fine line between drama and melodrama (at least most of the time), allowing Baker's commanding presence to guide the narrative to its powerful conclusion. This time around, however, I found the quiet moments in the film to have much greater impact. For example, the scenes in which the Pussers has a family picnic, later when Pusser meets briefly with Callie Hacker (Rosemary Murphy) before she leaves town, and then when his son walks through the hospital hallway to Pusser's room. It remains for others far better qualified than I to comment on this film's historical authenticity. (Although delighted by the attention which the film attracted to him, the real Buford Pusser was reportedly very upset by how Matt Briskin's screenplay portrays him.) Then (1973) and now, I think Walking Tall makes some important statements about what a determined and principled person can accomplish, whatever the cost may prove to be.

With the new version out featuring &quot;The Rock&quot;, the original may wind up being forgotten.",3,"Vicious, Brutal and Down Right Tough to Watch!",1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,388,"['brutal', 'nature', 'film', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'unforgetable', 'performance', 'Sherrif', 'Pusser', 'Elizabeth', 'Hartman', 'also', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'well', 'very', 'violent', 'tough', 'endure', 'entertaining', 'times', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'rating', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'new', 'version', 'featuring', 'quot', 'Rock', 'quot', 'original', 'may', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'forgotten']",N/A

184249,ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,1566053676,theboombody,"[1, 1]","This movie was a little too graphic for my taste.  Joe Don Baker moves to a small town and it doesn't take long for him to get into trouble.  He participates in a bar fight and some thugs slice him open.  Somehow he survives the attack, but he doesn't let anything slide.  He campaigns to become the new sheriff and sure enough, it happens.Baker busts a team of folks for making some surprisingly dangerous moonshine, and does bunch of other sheriff-type stuff.  But there are way more bad guys in the town than we realize, and he gets shot point blank after falling for one of their traps.  Once again, it's back to the hospital where he miraculously survives, again.  His pursuit of criminals becomes even more aggressive, and he shoots a crooked lady at Christmas time.I guess you can see where this is going.  People keep sending Joe Don Baker to the hospital but he just keeps coming back.  The movie gets more and more violent during this progression, and I was more depressed than inspired.If you want a lighter Joe Don Baker movie, you can always watch his infamous performance as Mitchell, the policeman with no last name.It frightens me that this was based on a true story.  While it may not be my cup of tea, the public needs to know if stuff like this is actually happening.",3,Not My Cup of Tea,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,1286,"['movie', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'graphic', 'taste', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'small', 'town', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'get', 'trouble', 'bar', 'fight', 'thugs', 'slice', 'open', 'attack', ""n't"", 'let', 'anything', 'slide', 'become', 'new', 'sheriff', 'sure', 'enough', 'team', 'folks', 'making', 'surprisingly', 'dangerous', 'moonshine', 'bunch', 'other', 'sheriff-type', 'stuff', 'are', 'way', 'more', 'bad', 'guys', 'town', 'realize', 'shot', 'point', 'blank', 'falling', 'one', 'traps', 'Once', 'again', 'back', 'hospital', 'where', 'miraculously', 'again', 'pursuit', 'criminals', 'becomes', 'even', 'more', 'aggressive', 'crooked', 'lady', 'Christmas', 'time.I', 'guess', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'People', 'keep', 'sending', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'hospital', 'just', 'coming', 'back', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'violent', 'progression', 'was', 'more', 'depressed', 'inspired.If', 'want', 'lighter', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'movie', 'can', 'always', 'watch', 'infamous', 'performance', 'Mitchell', 'policeman', 'last', 'name.It', 'frightens', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'public', 'know', 'stuff', 'actually', 'happening']",N/A
