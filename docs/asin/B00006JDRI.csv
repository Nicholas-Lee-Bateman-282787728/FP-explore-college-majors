While the story was unique but it was simply put together so badly half the time you were like what the hell is going on.  Even when the film tries to explain it at the end it still does a super poor job.The action was simply laughable since you couldnt see what was going on due to the purposely shaky filming to make the action look like it was in your seat.  It was not a good idea because unless you have an exciting plot and well explained action is not needed.  But the action was horrible and plot was explained at a D-.Good points: attempt at a good storyBad points: poor coreography, poor production of action sequencesworst points: boring film due to bad action sequences and poor  story tellingOverall movie grade D+",2,Horrible film...but it had potential,1038096000,"11 24, 2002",2002,832,"['film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Plot', 'actually', 'tried', 'be', 'intelligent', 'failed', 'miserably', 'story', 'was', 'unique', 'was', 'simply', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'badly', 'time', 'were', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'Even', 'when', 'film', 'tries', 'explain', 'end', 'still', 'super', 'poor', 'job.The', 'action', 'was', 'simply', 'laughable', 'couldnt', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'due', 'purposely', 'shaky', 'filming', 'make', 'action', 'look', 'was', 'seat', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'have', 'exciting', 'plot', 'well', 'explained', 'action', 'not', 'needed', 'action', 'was', 'horrible', 'plot', 'was', 'explained', 'D-.Good', 'points', 'attempt', 'good', 'storyBad', 'points', 'poor', 'coreography', 'poor', 'production', 'action', 'sequencesworst', 'points', 'boring', 'film', 'due', 'bad', 'action', 'sequences', 'poor', 'story', 'tellingOverall', 'movie', 'grade', 'D+']",Soul Assassin

It isn't done that well at times and the plot is difficult to follow. Not to mention that Skeet Ulrich pulls off the worst performance I have seen all year. I know he was never great but he was never this bad. I mean his performance here is plain bad. I felt that there were times when I was supposed to know what was going on and I just didn't. I commend them for the style though. The fast music, the fast filming here and there. this film seems like a Dutch mix of THE BOURNE IDENTITY, any Jerry Bruckheimer movie, and RUN LOLA RUN.

This reminds me of the later Bourne movies, strange stuff that we are beginning to accept as ""normal"" in the world of big business and world intrigue.  I think Skeet often is ahead of his time and his movies need a re-release to pick up on his star ability.  I recommend the movie, though it may be hard to find, I gather it is no longer being produced for sale.  I bought my DVD second-hand, I'm glad I did.

It has a complex plot with lots of twists and false leads, and some skillful performances from supporting players Rena Owen and Derek De Lint.  However, director Laurence Malkin decided to film 90 percent of it with a blue filter; erratic MTV-style choppy scenes and focused very little on the script or its performers.  Hence, all we get is a muddled tale of corporate deception and murder.  The use of the blue screen and its chaotic camerawork serves only to make the film more annoying than entertaining.  Skeet Ulrich is lost in the miasmic mess and the original Buffy (Kristy Swanson) just floats around with a gun in her hand most of the movie.

717627,A2VNDUY7NUHOUV,B00006JDRI,(Mr.) N. Sean Wright,"[3, 5]","On the surface, this movie had everythingit takes to score a hit (minus a Grade-A cast).However it missed the marked by a longshot.It's obvious that the writers invested mucheffort into creating an original storyline.....and they succeeded. However, their creative ideasdid not transfer well into the script.  The resultis a collosal mess of confusion.It is VERY difficult to follow. Everyone is implicatedin everything. The victims are the perpetraters. TheGood people are the Bad People.  The past is thefuture and the future is the present. More talentedwriters could have parlayed these contradictions intoan ecxiting suspense thriller. Unfortunatly, it appears thattalent,in general, was in  short supply across the board.The action is slightly better, but not by much. The mostridiculous thing about this movie is that the main character (kevin)can't fight. He gets beaten up in every fight sequence andeven gets killed at the end. (And he's supposed to be thestar/hero?) His performance of the fight choreography is blooper-reel quality at best.To save money, the producers could havepulled any 5 year old off the playgroundand gotten a more effective performance. The other actors are convincing,but Kevin should have had PUNK tatooed across his forehead.In spite of my negativity regarding this film, I still giveit a 3, based on a great story IDEA, and some really goodfight scenes with the elusive female agent at the end.",3,Confusion Abounds,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,1433,"['surface', 'movie', 'had', 'everythingit', 'score', 'hit', 'Grade-A', 'cast', 'missed', 'marked', 'longshot.It', 'obvious', 'writers', 'invested', 'mucheffort', 'creating', 'original', 'storyline', '..and', 'succeeded', 'However', 'creative', 'ideasdid', 'not', 'transfer', 'well', 'script', 'resultis', 'collosal', 'mess', 'confusion.It', 'VERY', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Everyone', 'implicatedin', 'everything', 'victims', 'are', 'perpetraters', 'TheGood', 'people', 'are', 'Bad', 'People', 'past', 'thefuture', 'future', 'present', 'More', 'talentedwriters', 'could', 'have', 'parlayed', 'contradictions', 'intoan', 'ecxiting', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Unfortunatly', 'thattalent', 'general', 'was', 'short', 'supply', 'board.The', 'action', 'slightly', 'better', 'not', 'much', 'mostridiculous', 'thing', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'kevin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'beaten', 'up', 'fight', 'sequence', 'andeven', 'killed', 'end', 'supposed', 'be', 'thestar/hero', 'performance', 'fight', 'choreography', 'blooper-reel', 'quality', 'best.To', 'save', 'money', 'producers', 'could', 'havepulled', '5', 'year', 'old', 'playgroundand', 'more', 'effective', 'performance', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'convincing', 'Kevin', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'PUNK', 'tatooed', 'forehead.In', 'spite', 'negativity', 'regarding', 'film', 'still', 'giveit', '3', 'based', 'great', 'story', 'IDEA', 'really', 'goodfight', 'scenes', 'elusive', 'female', 'agent', 'end']",Soul Assassin
717628,A1K4VAYQQLNFVS,B00006JDRI,"""peterdao""","[9, 10]","This indie from the Netherlands, with various film techniques from fast editing to fast music, could be a pleasant surprise to viewers who got fed up with Hollywood's cliches when it comes to suspense and action. Of course the movie would have been even better with a bigger budget for a stronger cast, yet I find it all in all enjoyable.There's nothing quite new with the plot (""The Replacement Killers"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" being two best in this genre lately) but it still manages to keep you guessing at least half way through. Skeet Ulrich is Kevin Burke, a rising star in an international bank in Rotterdam, working as security agent under his surrogate father and mentor, bank director Karl Jorgensen (Derek de Lint). Just when Kevin prepares to propose to a broker he's deeply in love with, the beautiful Rosalind Bremmond (Katherine Lang), her life is cut short by an assassin's bullet. As Kevin is furiously driven to seek revenge, his investigation into Rosalind's death not only reveals a dark facet of her life, it also drags him into a web of corporate espionage and assassination involving some agents from Interpol and numerous unidentified enemies. While working his way out of this dangerous maze, Kevin confronts with another mysterious beauty, Tessa Jansen (Kristy Swanson), who might well give him the ultimate answer to his deadliest question...Conclusion: 4 stars, 1 to the cast (especially Derek de Lint), and 3 to the film makers in terms of editing and cinematography (some sexy scenes from the streets of Rotterdam are really worth checking out). One side note: I was a little bit curious about ""some sexuality"" under the R rating box. Turned out it didn't involve Kristy Swanson, just Katherine Lang. But it was good anyway.",4,"Foreign indie, pleasant surprise",1036886400,"11 10, 2002",2002,1757,"['indie', 'Netherlands', 'various', 'film', 'techniques', 'fast', 'editing', 'fast', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'viewers', 'who', 'got', 'fed', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'when', 'suspense', 'action', 'course', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'bigger', 'budget', 'stronger', 'cast', 'yet', 'find', 'nothing', 'quite', 'new', 'plot', 'Replacement', 'Killers', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'being', 'two', 'best', 'genre', 'lately', 'still', 'keep', 'guessing', 'least', 'half', 'way', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'Kevin', 'Burke', 'rising', 'star', 'international', 'bank', 'Rotterdam', 'working', 'security', 'agent', 'surrogate', 'father', 'mentor', 'bank', 'director', 'Karl', 'Jorgensen', 'Derek', 'de', 'Lint', 'Just', 'when', 'Kevin', 'propose', 'broker', 'deeply', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Rosalind', 'Bremmond', 'Katherine', 'Lang', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'assassin', 'bullet', 'Kevin', 'furiously', 'driven', 'seek', 'revenge', 'investigation', 'Rosalind', 'death', 'not', 'only', 'dark', 'facet', 'life', 'also', 'web', 'corporate', 'espionage', 'assassination', 'involving', 'agents', 'Interpol', 'numerous', 'unidentified', 'enemies', 'working', 'way', 'dangerous', 'maze', 'Kevin', 'mysterious', 'beauty', 'Tessa', 'Jansen', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'who', 'might', 'well', 'give', 'ultimate', 'answer', 'deadliest', 'question', 'Conclusion', '4', 'stars', '1', 'cast', 'especially', 'Derek', 'Lint', '3', 'film', 'makers', 'terms', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'streets', 'Rotterdam', 'are', 'really', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'One', 'side', 'note', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'curious', 'sexuality', 'R', 'rating', 'box', 'Turned', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'involve', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'just', 'Katherine', 'Lang', 'was', 'good', 'anyway']",Soul Assassin
