Alien 3000 (aka Unseen Evil 2) is by no means a good movie.  Its cast is comprised of inept no-names poorly delivering badly written lines.  The story is nonsensical, being hacked together bits of established Sci-Fi movie tropes.  Bits of The X-files, Aliens, Predator and who knows what else have all been mashed together in a movie that contains Government Agents, ""Green Berets,"" a traumatized survivor of an alien attack, and the worst gang of Mercenaries ever assembled. The effects are worthy of the bargain-bin and the cinematography is, frankly, bush league.  This looks like a half-hearted student film, released by a college freshman with next to no budget and filmed in probably two locations.  Heck, the Alien on the cover is actually from another film, and has nothing to do with this one!  So why do I give it 4 stars?Because, dear reader, this movie is absolutely awesome!  It's everything hilarious that a purveyor of trashy sci-fi/horror films could ask for.  What's there to enjoy?  The combination of over and under-acting provides a treasure trove of one-liners and inside jokes to share with your friends.  The first couple of minutes of the film include a completely gratuitous flash of breasts.  Over the top blood and gore transform what should seem tragic (maybe) into a series of sight gags and ""what will they do next?"" moments.  A hero named McCool who wields a toy machine gun.  It's a joy to watch a film that includes little toy helicopters, Tonka(TM) trucks and cardboard box buildings masquerading as the real thing.  Lorenzo-Freaking-Lamas.  Seriously, this movie has it all.

(I had the misfortune of seeing that one, too, so I knew when the flashbacks occurred, I was in for trouble).  Lorenzo Lamas, looking seriously bored and only in the movie for about 10 minutes, is pretty bad, but the rest of the cast is worse.  The effects are some of the worst I've seen recently and the screenwriter is one of those who thinks that every character must have at least three profanities in his dialogue.

907863,A1QGMIQD8ZYDS8,B0009KQP6Y,"Ralph J. Fitcher ""Namahotitae""","[0, 0]","Clearly many of the reviewers did not realize that this was a B movie. As such, the ratings (if you go in for B movies) have to be adjusted accordingly. As a B movie, I give it 5 stars. If I were to grade it on the quality I would expect from an A list movie, I would have to give it less than 1 star. But lets be realistic here folks, buying a movie just because the picture on the box is reminiscent of an A list movie, does not ""ever"" make the movie a great or even good movie. This is schlock at its best. FX are not so bad for a B movie. Yes, the only two recognizable names in the movie have less than stellar parts, heck even somewhat limited parts. To be honest, I never realized Priscilla Barns could look so bad. And, I used to have a crush on her. Well, if you were married to the person I was married to at the time, you would understand. But, I digress, and I do now have a wonderful wife. The funny thing about this movie is, that it's a sequel to a movie called ""Unseen Evil"" also of poor quality. With a very similar plot-line ""If you see the beast you are already dead."" This story picks up with the one lone survivor of the first movie in a nut-hutch etc. Sound familiar, it should, it's been done in many horror movies in the past. So,if  you like B list movies, poor FX, and you know what you are getting when you buy this, you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you prefer a higher class of loser as Garth sings, then stay away from this movie.Rod",5,"A B movie at it's best, also a sequel to another B movie!!!!!!!!!!",1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1468,"['Clearly', 'many', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'B', 'movie', 'such', 'ratings', 'go', 'B', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'adjusted', 'accordingly', 'B', 'movie', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'were', 'grade', 'quality', 'would', 'expect', 'A', 'list', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'give', 'less', '1', 'star', 'be', 'realistic', 'here', 'folks', 'buying', 'movie', 'just', 'picture', 'box', 'reminiscent', 'A', 'list', 'movie', 'not', 'ever', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'movie', 'schlock', 'best', 'FX', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'B', 'movie', 'Yes', 'only', 'two', 'recognizable', 'names', 'movie', 'have', 'less', 'stellar', 'parts', 'heck', 'even', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'parts', 'be', 'honest', 'never', 'realized', 'Priscilla', 'Barns', 'could', 'look', 'so', 'bad', 'used', 'have', 'crush', 'Well', 'were', 'married', 'person', 'was', 'married', 'time', 'would', 'understand', 'digress', 'do', 'now', 'have', 'wonderful', 'wife', 'funny', 'thing', 'movie', 'sequel', 'movie', 'called', 'Unseen', 'Evil', 'also', 'poor', 'quality', 'very', 'similar', 'plot-line', 'see', 'beast', 'are', 'already', 'dead', 'story', 'up', 'one', 'lone', 'survivor', 'first', 'movie', 'nut-hutch', 'etc', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'past', 'So', 'like', 'B', 'list', 'movies', 'poor', 'FX', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'when', 'buy', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'prefer', 'higher', 'class', 'loser', 'Garth', 'sings', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'movie.Rod']",Alien 3000
907864,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0009KQP6Y,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","Most people are quite familiar with the pony-tailed B legend known as Lorenzo Lamas. Whether you want to admit it or not, you've probably enjoyed one of his classic works at some point in life. The man launched his career in the 90's as an action powerhouse, most notably as Reno Raines in the uber B show Renegade, and has never looked back. When you have such a successful B action career you tend to get a bit restless. The non stop neck snappings, explosions, and stables of women can become tiresome. This could be the one reason Lorenzo decided to branch out and sign himself up for a journey into the world of sci-fi with Alien 3000. Now to be clear, this movie was about as horrible as any movie could possibly be. The creature on the cover has nothing to do with the alien in the movie. Maybe they casted the aliens more B brother instead because this thing was hilarious. The only reason this earned a three star rating was in honor of the mighty Lorenzo and a cameo that even we were not prepared for. When Scott Schwartz, Flick from a Christmas Story, showed up on the screen we almost lost our minds! The man was a better actor at 10 years old with his tongue stuck to a telephone pole.  What's even more funny is remembering his did a few adult films back in the 90's, which added an even larger dose of B to the already nightmarish film.Alien 3000 opens up with some peep freak with binoculars checking out a chicks rack. Seriously they opened up the movie with nudity...which is something Sid from 94 would have been thrilled about. Not only did they open with it but it lasts for a good 35 seconds. This was their way of letting you know this movie is going to be horrendous. After some rackage we follow this crew of flunkies into a cave where they stumble upon a bunch of gold. Instead of the gold being protected by a little Irish maniac, it's protected by one of the cheapest CGI aliens anyone could create. When they try to take its gold the creature chops everyone in half. This now leads to a girl in a mental institution that has visions of this aliens killings, gathers up a team of even bigger losers, and heads out to stop this alien. We're not sure where Lorenzo really comes into play, but he's seen at the start and end of the movie. He plays an army guy that winds up having a sword fight with the alien. None of this makes any sense and is actually quite challenging to even attempt to explain. Bottom line is the movie is horrific and as confused as Santa on the toilet when a slow fellow opens the stall door.Alien 3000 could easily have been created on a $50 budget with the actors being paid in Big Uns. The cast, except for Lamas and Flick, seemed as if they'd never been involved in any form of acting. It's almost like they all randomly showed up and were asked ""hey do you want to be in a movie?"" You could even tell by Lamas's face that he couldn't believe he was involved in this nightmare. And considering his resume, that's pretty disturbing. The acting was actually nowhere near as horrid as the special effects. Most of the time the alien was invisible with a slight outline, similar to Predator...just lacking any level creativeness. It was like a mentally challenged version of predator. When the alien was materialized it was pretty hilariously cheap. But leaps and bounds above the CGI version. We can't advice you spend any time watching Alien 3000, but we will dare you.

907867,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0009KQP6Y,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[0, 0]","I have to say that enjoying this type of movie requires an enquired taste.  I have seen many types of films in my day, from Hollywood, mainstream, independent, low budget or whatever.  As a matter of fact in my college days I used to make movies (not those types of movies) and did freelanced work with film/video.  Therefore I feel I am able to appreciate a good movie or a bad movie.  Please don't mistake me, just because I use to work with video/film doesn't mean I have a better taste than others, this is just my excuse for loving schlock. :)With this introduction taken into consideration, I have to say that ""Alien 3000"" is so bad that it is awesome.  To say the acting is terrible is an understatement, the story is awful and has the continuity problems to prove it; the special effects are brought to you in part by Xbox and/or Kmart Halloween costumes.  In other words, if you want to watch an ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" movie, then just watch an ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" movie.  Nevertheless I feel that ""Alien 3000"" was much more entertaining that ""Alien vs. Predator"".The plot is simple a woman named Kate (Megan Malloy) is in a mental institution after witnessing everyone from her camping group killed by an ""unknown"" being.  I must say that Megan Malloy is really attractive, sadly her looks don't bleed over into her performance. The mental institution looks like it was filmed in an extra room at an elementary school.  I digress, the military need Kate to track down this ""unknown"" being.  This leads to a motley crew of Special Forces to track down the ""unknown"" being A.K.A ""Alien"".  One of the Special Forces team members is this Goth-type girl with a potty mouth who looks a lot like a girl I use to date. As for the other team members, well if the United States had to recruit this group to pour a glass of milk we are all doomed.The vast majority of this movie takes place in the woods and/or mountains, so already the production budget of this movie is being saved.  The ""Alien"" is really fake looking, man it is so bad.  Also the ""Alien"" has loot and/or gold if you take it then you have already signed your death certificate. This gold-death conduit is never really explained.Anyway, there is plenty of blood, guts, screaming, bad acting, dummies, more dummies, exploding body parts, toy helicopters, dummies, fake bats, CGI that mirrors Xbox and oh yeah dummies.  I was laughing so hard during this movie I couldn't stand it. I found myself rewinding stuff just to crack myself up. This movie was non-stop cheese that was either Gorgonzola or Havarti, I still can't decide.This movie also features Lorenzo Lamas, who seems sedated in his 12 minute part as a solider, Priscilla Barnes (the third blonde from ""Three's Company"") plays a doctor and Scott Schwartz (the kid from ""The Toy"" and my personal favorite ""Raiders of the Living Dead"") has a small part.The only special feature is a gallery of trailers/previews, yet the trailer/preview for ""Alien 3000"" isn't presented.  Then there is a mock interview with the ""Alien"" about his part in this movie.  The ""Alien"" is just a guy wearing a mask, pretty lame.This movie has received some pretty low ratings in this forum.  I totally understand why, this movie was a shoddy attempt at a sci-fi and/or horror movie.  This movie plays more as a comedy than a horror or sci-fi movie.  So don't let the cover of the movie seduce you, it isn't a great movie.  However, I lowered my expectations (way down) when I watched this movie and I loved it.  In conclusion, if you walk into an Outback Steakhouse and get a steak you aren't going to be surprised.

Poor filming and horrid script made it a film that not-even cable will show again. The story is a survivor of the first film is contracted by the government to work with mercenaries to find and capture this alien entity. First, last i checked the US government has no need to contract mercenaries, we have the largest and most trained army in the world. The second thing i found really annoying is the aliens shape. We see about three different body-suits used for the alien and its cloaking is a bad omage of the predator movies. All in all the film was to bad for me to completly finish as it was to agonizing and the DVD picture quality and sound was below an awful bootleg.",1,Eah,1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,785,"['movie', 'good', 'idea', 'prequal', 'unseen', 'evil', 'production', 'DVD', 'value', 'incredibly', 'low', 'Poor', 'filming', 'horrid', 'script', 'made', 'film', 'not-even', 'cable', 'will', 'show', 'again', 'story', 'survivor', 'first', 'film', 'contracted', 'government', 'work', 'mercenaries', 'find', 'capture', 'alien', 'entity', 'First', 'last', 'i', 'checked', 'US', 'government', 'need', 'contract', 'mercenaries', 'have', 'largest', 'most', 'trained', 'army', 'world', 'second', 'thing', 'i', 'found', 'really', 'annoying', 'aliens', 'shape', 'see', 'three', 'different', 'body-suits', 'used', 'alien', 'cloaking', 'bad', 'omage', 'predator', 'movies', 'film', 'was', 'bad', 'completly', 'finish', 'was', 'agonizing', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'was', 'awful', 'bootleg']",Alien 3000
