I had high expectations for a thriller, and was hoping for a suspenseful movie with ruthless tactics by Harrison Ford and his opponent Gary Oldman.  But all of the suspense kept dying away as quickly as it came, because most of the scenes interspersed throughout involve the main character brooding or drawn-out nonessential interactions.  Unlike National Treasure, the pacing and editing kill the suspense instead of creating it.  I also would have liked a drastic turnaround in the main character's attitude toward women at the end.

The movie chronicles the relationship between two major tech companies, with both of the CEOs, played by Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, who have a very personal history between them.  Ford's company has a secret product that Oldman's company will do anything to get.Oldman's company goes about trying to steal the product by blackmailing a newly fired employee, played by Liam Hemsworth, to get the job done.  The fact that Hemsworth's character goes from being a fired low level flunkie at Oldman's company to a hot rising star at Ford's company overnight is not plausible in the least.Amber Heard plays a marketing executive at Ford's company and while her character never gets the full development it deserved she played the part well and as always looked great on the screen.Harrison Ford's character was a little too one dimensional, but that really was probably more due to the script than his performance.This is not a great movie, it has some pretty glaring holes and the audience is expected to suspend belief in order to jump over those plot holes.

1592469,AGNN3F0NN9314,B009AMAMT8,Emgee,"[43, 47]","About eight years ago or so, I read the book which this movie is based upon.  Even in the book jacket at the time, it said the book had been optioned for film rights.  I loved the book.  It is one of my favorite contemporary suspense thrillers and there was so much to it.  But I never heard anything more about the movie.  I kept an eye out on IMDb for information, but for years, there was nothing.Then I went to see ""Man of Steel"" and saw a trailer for the movie and I was excited beyond belief. Finally!Then thee movie came out and I saw the critical reviews absolutely panning the movie. 4% on the Tomatometer.  I was crushed.  The movie I'd waited so long for was, it seemed, being deemed one of the worst movies of the year, if not ever.As I read more and more reviews, I decided to cast aside my feelings about the book and decided to go see the movie thinking it would be fun to watch such a disaster. Perhaps it would give me something fun to laugh at and tell my co-workers how absolutely bad the movie had been.Ever go into a movie with such high hopes that they get crushed?  Consider this one the opposite effect. I went in with such low expectations that the movie was able to rise above it.Yes, there were some plot holes (the fact that Adam's corporate credit card was not cancelled is one multiple critics have cited) and it is pretty by the numbers.  Even as far as suspense thrillers go, it's not up there as a great one. They even changed a great deal from the book.  But the movie is nowhere near as bad as critics have been making out to be. It's actually a pretty decent flick.  Definitely worth wasting away my Sunday night with.It's definitely not a movie that commands to be seen in theaters on a big screen, so waiting for this one on DVD may be the path to take if you have reservations about it.

1592471,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009AMAMT8,FNDNreview,"[6, 10]","Writing movie reviews can be dizzying at times, mainly due in large part to bad, bad movies.  When you're passionate or infuriated about a film, it's certainly easy to pass along the praise or dish out the anger.  However, every now and then a film slips through the cracks, quite honestly because it's so horribly uneventful and so pointless that you can't help but forget about it.  Now, it's been a while since one of these easily forgettable blunder-filled hatchet jobs has been released - and even more shocking is the fact this particular film stars two of Hollywood's finest - plus an actor and an actress that are so attractive that it's questionable how they don't turn us all to stone when we look at them.  Of course the two Hollywood alums are Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, while the ""pretty"" people are Liam Hemsworth and Amber Heard.  Together, this rather unique foursome stars in the dull techno-thriller, Paranoia.Directed by Robert Luketic (21, Killers) and based on the novel of the same name (by Joseph Finderstars), Paranoia stars Liam Hemsworth as Adam Cassidy, a young tech guru that is forced into a world of corporate espionage after he lands in debt with technology CEO mogul, Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman).  Desperate to keep his company afloat, Wyatt sends Cassidy to work for the competition, as a double-agent.  His job is to steal trade secrets by getting close to its CEO tech-titan, Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford), who has set out to run Wyatt out of business.  Along the way, Cassidy is put in a difficult position when he becomes romantically involved with Emma Jennings (Amber Heard), an employee under Goodard.  Lucas Til, Julian McMahon, and Richard Dreyfuss also star in supporting roles.To be fair, Paranoia starts out as an interesting film.  Liam Hemsworth's character, Adam, has a tech-team that is so anxious and overzealous to sell their ideas and earn corporate jobs that it completely backfires.  Unfortunately, smart kids can be pretty dumb sometimes - especially when they decide to take their corporate credit card out for a spin at a local night club.  From there, events spiral out of control when Gary Oldman's character, Wyatt, decides to use it as an excuse and take advantage of the situation by blackmailing Adam into submission.  And, while the story sounds more interesting on paper than it appears on the screen, it should be noted that this film at least attempted to tell an ambitious story - but simply fails to connect viewers to these ""titans"" of industry and their lives of wealth in the highly competitive world of riches that's known as corporate America.The main issue of this film - outside of a tasteless plot, is simply that there's very little feasible ""paranoia.""  It's easy to understand why most of them could be paranoid - in their world of secrets where anyone and everyone could be listening and watching you.  However, ""big brother"" is always everywhere these days anyway, so at no point do any of these characters resemble the proper amount of fear for their stability.  In fact, the majority of this film is spent listening to banter-rich exchanges and a series of events full of greedy, childish maneuvers.The film obviously had to have a villain, and Gary Oldman fills the role quite nicely, much like he did during Air Force One.  His heavy British accent can be overbearing and pompous at times, but I suspect that was the point.  Harrison Ford is also quite enjoyable in this films, mostly when he's engaged with Oldman - who are back at each other's throats once again (see 1997's thriller, Air Force One).  For the few brief scenes Ford is present, he proves to be a domineering presence - although mostly outlandish and vengeful, even for his typical character standards.Overall, Paranoia is a perfect example of filmmakers attempting to use pretty faces and glittery gadgets to sell movie tickets.  This film cries desperately for attention, yet there's absolutely nothing to see here.  It relies far too much on flashy, inanimate objects - like designer suits, fast cars, and futuristic cell-phones and not enough on sustainable, plausible scenarios.  The cast severely lacks chemistry with one another - mainly Liam Hemsworth and his co-star love interest, Amber Heard.  And, no matter how many times Liam Hemsworth takes his shirt off over the course of a film, it will always feel like blatantly desperate plot for attention.  Unlike his superhero brother - Chris Hemsworth, Mr. Miley Cyrus might want to stick to a few supporting roles before trying to hang in the big leagues with the ""God of Thunder.""GRADE:  DFNDNreview.com",1,"Liam Hemsworth stars in the dull techno-thriller, 'Paranoia'",1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,4620,"['Writing', 'movie', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'dizzying', 'times', 'mainly', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'bad', 'bad', 'movies', 'When', ""'re"", 'passionate', 'infuriated', 'film', 'certainly', 'easy', 'pass', 'praise', 'dish', 'out', 'anger', 'However', 'now', 'then', 'film', 'cracks', 'quite', 'honestly', 'so', 'horribly', 'uneventful', 'so', 'pointless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'forget', 'Now', 'been', 'while', 'one', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'blunder-filled', 'hatchet', 'jobs', 'been', 'released', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'fact', 'particular', 'film', 'stars', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'finest', 'actor', 'actress', 'are', 'so', 'attractive', 'questionable', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'stone', 'when', 'look', 'course', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'alums', 'are', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'pretty', 'people', 'are', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'Together', 'rather', 'unique', 'foursome', 'stars', 'dull', 'techno-thriller', 'Paranoia.Directed', 'Robert', 'Luketic', '21', 'Killers', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Joseph', 'Finderstars', 'Paranoia', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'Adam', 'Cassidy', 'young', 'tech', 'guru', 'forced', 'world', 'corporate', 'espionage', 'debt', 'technology', 'CEO', 'mogul', 'Nicholas', 'Wyatt', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Desperate', 'keep', 'company', 'afloat', 'Wyatt', 'Cassidy', 'work', 'competition', 'double-agent', 'job', 'steal', 'trade', 'secrets', 'getting', 'close', 'CEO', 'tech-titan', 'Jock', 'Goddard', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'run', 'Wyatt', 'business', 'way', 'Cassidy', 'put', 'difficult', 'position', 'when', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Emma', 'Jennings', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'employee', 'Goodard', 'Lucas', 'Til', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.To', 'be', 'fair', 'Paranoia', 'out', 'interesting', 'film', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'character', 'Adam', 'tech-team', 'so', 'anxious', 'overzealous', 'sell', 'ideas', 'earn', 'corporate', 'jobs', 'completely', 'Unfortunately', 'smart', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'when', 'decide', 'take', 'corporate', 'credit', 'card', 'spin', 'local', 'night', 'club', 'there', 'events', 'spiral', 'control', 'when', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'character', 'Wyatt', 'use', 'excuse', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'blackmailing', 'Adam', 'submission', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'paper', 'screen', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'film', 'least', 'attempted', 'tell', 'ambitious', 'story', 'simply', 'connect', 'viewers', 'titans', 'industry', 'lives', 'wealth', 'highly', 'competitive', 'world', 'riches', 'known', 'corporate', 'America.The', 'main', 'issue', 'film', 'outside', 'tasteless', 'plot', 'simply', 'very', 'little', 'feasible', 'paranoia', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'most', 'could', 'be', 'paranoid', 'world', 'secrets', 'where', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'could', 'be', 'listening', 'watching', 'However', 'big', 'brother', 'always', 'everywhere', 'days', 'anyway', 'so', 'point', 'do', 'characters', 'resemble', 'proper', 'amount', 'fear', 'stability', 'fact', 'majority', 'film', 'spent', 'listening', 'banter-rich', 'exchanges', 'series', 'events', 'full', 'greedy', 'childish', 'maneuvers.The', 'film', 'obviously', 'had', 'have', 'villain', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'role', 'quite', 'nicely', 'much', 'did', 'Air', 'Force', 'heavy', 'British', 'accent', 'can', 'be', 'overbearing', 'pompous', 'times', 'suspect', 'was', 'point', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'also', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'mostly', 'when', 'engaged', 'Oldman', 'who', 'are', 'back', 'other', 'throats', 'once', 'again', 'see', '1997', 'thriller', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Ford', 'present', 'be', 'domineering', 'presence', 'mostly', 'outlandish', 'vengeful', 'even', 'typical', 'character', 'standards.Overall', 'Paranoia', 'perfect', 'example', 'filmmakers', 'attempting', 'use', 'pretty', 'glittery', 'gadgets', 'sell', 'movie', 'tickets', 'film', 'desperately', 'attention', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'see', 'here', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'flashy', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'designer', 'suits', 'fast', 'cars', 'futuristic', 'cell-phones', 'not', 'enough', 'sustainable', 'plausible', 'scenarios', 'cast', 'severely', 'chemistry', 'one', 'mainly', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'co-star', 'love', 'interest', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Liam', 'Hemsworth', 'shirt', 'course', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'feel', 'blatantly', 'desperate', 'plot', 'attention', 'superhero', 'brother', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Mr.', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'might', 'want', 'stick', 'few', 'supporting', 'roles', 'trying', 'hang', 'big', 'leagues', 'God', 'Thunder', 'GRADE', 'DFNDNreview.com']",N/A

1592486,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B009AMAMT8,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","Young Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) is a tech genius. Just take our word for it. After a disastrous presentation at his company, he and his whole crew are fired by the no-nonsense owner, Nicolas Wyatt (Gary Oldman). Adam, at this point, is approached by Wyatt and friends with a counter offer: if Adam will go undercover at a rival company and steal their secrets, they will pay him handsomely.Espionage!The plot of this clunker is fairly nonsensical. Much is said about various levels of technology and such, but none of it seems that impressive or even knowledgeable. Of course, Hollywood scriptwriters have to fudge here and there to up the entertainment value, but the lags in plausibility in this script are titanic and distracting.Gaps in logic and yawning plot holes are dealt with in the laziest, cheapest way possible: by casting leads that are ridiculously attractive. Our two protagonists -- Adam and his love interest, Emma Jennings (Amber Heard) -- are so ludicrously pretty that it is equally distracting. I'm serious. These two are gorgeous beyond belief. As in, I don't believe it. I think that was the point of casting them, if the overlong, out of place, Cinemax-style sex scenes are any indication. And if that doesn't do it for you, there are a few pointless chases to numb the mind, some life-is-on-the-line moments, and even the reliable Richard Dreyfuss as Adam's curmudgeonly-lovable-ailing dad. All to serve as a distraction that the story is as weak as a baby bird.This movie is stupid. I mean literally. The writers didn't come up with any interesting twists or clever turns, and the main character's only saving grace is that he has some smart friends (an appropriately nerdy-looking couple) and some amazing luck. Otherwise, he's a complete non-entity. A pretty pair of eyes and a dimpled smile without hardly a drop of acting skill in his body.In fact, the whole flick would've been a wash if it hadn't been for the strong acting chops of Goldman, Ford, and Dreyfuss. It's nice to watch Ford and Goldman square off in a restaurant, or ham it up at their various businesses, and even Dreyfuss is an engaging presence (although he's looking more and more like an anthropomorphic beanbag chair with every movie). But even these three tested talents can't fully float the cheap script, vapid acting, and silly plot contrivances that infest this watered-down thriller.",2,Gosh.

One day Adam gets in an argument with the Wyatt CEO (played by Gary Oldman) and gets fired. Adam uses the company credit card for a lavish going away party, and soon gets apprehended by Wyatt. Adam get a choice: unless he starts spying for them at a competitor called Eikon, they'll report the credit card abuse to the cops. In no time Adam gets himself hired at Eikon, and even catches the attention of the CEO (played by Harrison Ford). In the meantime at that getaway party Adam hooks up with a young woman named Emma (played by Amber Heard). Turns out that woman also works at Eikon. Will Adam get away with corporate espionage? who is playing whom here exactly? will Adam and Emma find true love? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience of this plot-heavy movie.Couple of comments: first, the movie takes quite a bit of time to set up all the necessary elements to provide us with a thriller in the corporate world, and that is quite alright, as long as we get the proper pay-off. Unfortunately, the movie never fully delivers on the promise, as it turns out the plot and intrigue is rather thin. Second, I believe this movie is mistitled (although I fully realize that the movie is based on the book of the same name by Joseph Finder), as there is very little 'paranoia' to be found in the movie. Third, the movie is somewhat rescued by the fine performances of the two CEOs, played by Oldman and Ford. I particularly liked Harrison's look (with the shaved head). There is also a small role for Richard Dreyfuss as Adam's dad that is worth noting. Can't say I'm a big fan of Liam Hemsworth (best known for his role in The Hunger Games), as he simply does not have the chops to carry a movie of this kind. Lastly, the movie soundtrack is very nice, with the movie score coming from Junkie XL (and also available here on Amazon), but with additional tracks from indie bands like Surfer Blood, City and Colour, and Empire of the Sun.Bottom line: ""Paranoia"" starts off promisingly as a corporate espionage thriller, but ultimately the plot was too thin/too obvious to really have me on the edge of my seat. I saw the movie this weekend at a brand spanking new theatre here in Cincinnati (the Cinemark Oakley), which was a very nice place to see a movie. The screening I saw this at was attended okay but not great, so I'm not sure what that says about the long-term success of this movie in the theatres.

This film has a somewhat complicated plot to explain without spoilers, but I will attempt to do so. Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) is a low level employee at one of the worlds largest tech company. His boss has learned that their main competition, his former employer, is about to unveil a revolutionary piece of new technology, that can change everything. Fearing for his companies future, Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) decides to give Cassidy the opportunity of a lifetime, that is if he's willing to break a few dozen laws or so. Liam Hemsworth was terrific, giving a performance similar to the one Bradly Cooper gives in Limitless, as a guy with an important job that's in way over his head. Hollywood finds these good looking guys and the truth is that a lot of them have nothing to offer, but Hemsworth proves that he has the talent it takes to star on the big screen. In the film he's supported by a real all-star cast, that includes Harrison Ford, Richard Dryfuss, and Gary Oldman, all of whom do what they've been doing for half a century, making great films even better. The only reason this film isn't getting 5 stars, is the same reason it didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. Paranoia is about corporate espionage and at times, the business aspect is confusing and makes us feel as overwhelmed as Hemsworth's character does.

Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, also Richard Dreyfuss is in this but in a lesser role. I cannot recall a movie they have been in that has been bad (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was bad but its still Indiana Jones so I can't hate it and I blame Lucas for that anyway). I did find out how to mess up a movie with those two legendary actors...add baby Thor (Liam Hemsworth). I'm not saying he was a bad actor in this because it wasn't terrible but when you have those two in a movie and you make baby Thor the main focus you have screwed up somewhere. I'd compare this to the movie Son Of No One in the way that you have Ray Liotta and Al Pacino and you make Channing Tatum the focus. Nothing personal against Hemsworth or Tatum but when you have such high caliber actors why waste them? As far as this movie goes the scenes with Oldman and Ford are amazing as expected, as far as the rest goes it was slow, a little boring and not exciting at all.
