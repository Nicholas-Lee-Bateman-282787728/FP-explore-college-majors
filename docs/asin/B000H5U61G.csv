1009991,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B000H5U61G,Amateur Stargazer,"[55, 59]","This DVD set has four National Geographic TV specials about jaguars, bears, lions, hyenas, and whales, along with some bonus material on the programs.  You are treated to some of the great wildlife photography that you expect from National Geographic. However, I wish that more of the wildlife specials that were made over the years were included in the set.  I would rather have much more of the artful film photography than the video included in the bonus  footage.  Still, it is a very entertaining and educational set, not too expensive and well worth your viewing time.",4,A Good Wildlife Collection,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,574,"['DVD', 'set', 'four', 'National', 'Geographic', 'TV', 'specials', 'jaguars', 'bears', 'lions', 'hyenas', 'whales', 'bonus', 'material', 'programs', 'are', 'treated', 'great', 'wildlife', 'photography', 'expect', 'National', 'Geographic', 'However', 'wish', 'more', 'wildlife', 'specials', 'were', 'made', 'years', 'were', 'included', 'set', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'artful', 'film', 'photography', 'video', 'included', 'bonus', 'footage', 'Still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'set', 'not', 'too', 'expensive', 'well', 'viewing', 'time']",N/A
