1112713,A20NK24YAZFO8Q,B000X07TLA,"Dean T. Sinclair ""Geoman""","[5, 5]","I have just completed the entire three season series, including commentary tracks and special features.  If you have any memories of this series, this is a wonderfully priced addition to your tv catalog; if you have heard of the series and want to check it out, this is still a great buy, because once you go through the first season you will want to finish the journey.  I remember watching the show in the 70s, but because it has been syndicated so little (unlike say Star Trek), I really did not remember specific episodes, but only recalled the basic structure of the show.  And that has been well described by other reviewers.As to the series itself, in my humble opinion season one is good, with the show finding its legs.  Season two is far and away the strongest, with important themes coursing through nearly every episode.  Season three suffered from what other reviewers have pointed out was an increasing reliance on mystical/magical themes.  Less commented on has been some of the really rough acting found in season three, including Barbara Hershey (Seagull) in a critical two parter directed by Caradine himself.  His girlfriend at the time (and based on some later commentary the relationship may have been winding down even while they were filming) does not do a very good job in a critical role.  And in the last four episodes which wind up the series, the Barrimore playing the son of Danny Caine really doesn't do a very good job in the role. These acting problems were nowhere in evidence in the second season.  In addition, in season three the series moved away from the basic structure of the show, with its connected flashbacks tracking with the old west action.  It's my belief that these changes/problems accelerated after Caradine announced it was all over, and they rushed their way to a series finale, which is beautiful, by the way, with Caradine using his last dance move to gracefully exit the stage.To summarize: if you have any interest in this ground breaking series, you won't be disappointed.  And if you have interest in it, you are really going to want to see the whole thing.

Even though Bruce Lee got cheated out of the lead role it is still a good entertaining show.

1112716,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B000X07TLA,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[490, 546]","Kung Fu drastically challenged the conservative, militaristic, and philosophically naive outlook I held as a 20 year old college student and ""gung-ho"" ROTC cadet in 1972.  Now, 36 years later, I have had the opportunity to watch Kung Fu once more, and the impact has been nearly as powerful.  I have been disabled for severe depression and anxiety for over 15 years, including close to two years of hospitalization.  In all of that time I have barely moved forward--until re-watching Kung Fu.  The show has visually reminded me of many things, repeatedly told me by therapists, in such a way that I am once again able to reflect--especially while watching the show--a little more positively on my life.That is the beauty and mastery of Kung Fu, one of the most intriguing shows ever made: it invokes one to THINK, discuss, and contemplate.  The only other show I have seen have such an effect on so many people (nearly 90% of my ROTC class of 207 cadets watched Kung Fu as well as me), is the original two years of Star Trek.  BUT, the level and intensity invoked by Kung Fu was immeasurably greater than that of Star Trek.  The commentaries and features (see the Comments for listing of these items) often mention how teachers ""required"" students to watch Kung Fu, and then discussed the episodes in class.  In deed, it is the philosophical nature of the show that most appeals to me and many who watch it.Conversely, I will not deny that the show led me to sign up for Judo classes too (over 50% of my friends signed up for some form of martial arts), but the Karate nature of the show was never that appealing to me.  Kung Fu is frequently accredited for ""introducing"" thousands of people to the martial arts.  Unfortunately, many who watch the show or have watched the show have followed the path of what I consider ""aggressive"" martial arts, forgetting the retrospective nature of true Kung Fu.  But, I must believe that if parents watch the show with their children, they can have an opportunity to talk with their children about both aspects of Kung Fu.Another fabulous feature of the show is that viewers are presented with the reality of bigotry and hate--something that never ends, and is completely pertinent to today's world.  (Please see the Comments for an example of how the mere fact that I lamented--now also in the Comments--that the DVDs are in English only prompted someone ""disrespectful to Americans living in AMERICA."")  Again, parents could easily use episodes to discuss and help their children--be they victims, violators, or naive--deal with bigotry and hate.PLEASE NOTE:  Warner Brothers has apparently advertised, and thus Amazon has listed, this set to contain wide-screen formate; see the Comments for more discussion on this.  While the Season One episodes have been digitally reformatted ""IN A ""MATTED"" WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING A THEATRICAL EXHIBITION ASPECT RATIO. ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVs,"" all episodes and features in the Season 2 and 3 sets are in fact full screen.  The release date (on Amazon and the back of the red slip case for the series) states 2007, but season boxes all state they were done in 2005; so I don't think there is any difference between the Complete Series Box Set and the single season box sets.  On an even sadder note, while Warner Brothers did attempt to improve the quality of the shows and alter the formate, they did so, with varying success, for the first season only.  (Again, please see the Comments for more discussion on this matter).  For the second and third seasons, Warner Brothers either did nothing or very little to restore the negatives, so the episodes are littered with white specs, scratches, and so on (although I found them no less bothersome than those found when watching a well used copy of a movie showing at a theater; for more discussion on this, see the Comments).  That said, one must remain mindful of the fact that ""Kung Fu"" was filmed for television not the theater, was on a limited budget, and the fact that the negatives, when placed in the vault for storage, were most likely not very high quality to begin with; after all, nobody anticipated cable television syndication, let alone VHS and DVD production when the negatives were stored.  On the other hand, this inconsistency in DVD quality (be it television shows or movies) is what I have now come to expect from Warner Brothers: misinformation and little or no care for their consumers; out of seventeen letters I have sent to them with questions, they have never replied to a single one.All that said and done: Please consider renting (if available) or buying the Kung Fu series, and watch it with family and friends if you have them.  ""Kung Fu - The Complete Series"" includes the award winning Pilot movie and all 62 episodes on 11 discs, starring David Carradine as Kiwai Chang Caine, Philip Ahn as Master Kan, and Keye Luke as Master PO.  Special guest stars (some of which I have noted in the Comments) include David's father John Carradine, Benson Fong, Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Don Johnson, Leslie Nielsen, William Shatner, and others.  ""Kung Fu"" is a show that is thought provoking, educational, inspirational, and unforgettable.  ""Kung Fu"" is a show that can be watched over and over--by yourself, with friends, or with your family.  There is no other TV show that I would recommend for people of all ages than ""Kung Fu""--so, treat yourself with the whole series.UPDATE--FEBRUARY 22, 2009: It came to my attention while reading ""A Kid's Review--Kung Fu is the best, and this is the best way to own them,"" that I failed to mention the great extra features included in each of the three season sets.  In particular, in the Season Three Set, there is a fascinating documentary that follows David Carradine and some of his friends on a trip to China, where David is given a Shaolin robe on their visit to the famed Shaolin Temple Monastery, a key location depicted in the series, and David plays his flute on the Great Wall of China while it is snowing.  ForKill Bill - Volume OneandKill Bill - Volume Twofans, there is a bonus feature on the Season Two set that features David Carradine having dinner with stars/friends from these two films and the ""Kung Fu"" series.  (See the Comments for more details on other bonus features and special guest stars, including Harrison Ford!).Also, I feel like this review has become too long in my efforts to answer questions.  Therefore, I am going to cut my other updates and place them in a comment.  For first time readers, these comments deal with the following: film format and transfer quality for each season; languages and subtitles for the episodes and extra features; the fact that the discs are double sided; more on how the series is packaged; and, bonus features (rather than listing them here).  I sincerely apologize if this is an inconvenience for some, but if you look at the comments you will understand just how long this review was getting.June 14, 2009: I have deleted my response to the individual whose comments have been once again removed by Amazon, as they were out of place without that person's comments.  If you wish to read them, I have saved them and would be happy to send them to you--just go to my Profile to get my email address.  And thanks to everyone for making this my most successful, albeit declining in popularity vote percentages.  Regardless, if my review sparks interests, then it has achieved one of my objectives.If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.

1112720,AYB3VTUIRI23R,B000X07TLA,George Macdonald,"[7, 9]","I have been (re)enjoying this series that I enjoyed so much as a teenager.  The series starts with the original pilot movie which is essential to be able to understand the rest of the series. (Otherwise you just get bits and pieces thrown at you about where Caine came from and why).It comes nicely packaged in a box and each season is in a foldout with 4 DVDs in its own box within the bigger one.  They are nicely illustrated.  The amazing thing to watch is how season#1 differed from season #2 which in turn differed from saeson #3.  In the first season, both Caine as well as the story line and characters are naive and over simplified.  But, that progresses through season #2 into the 3rd season to where both Caine as well as the stories and characters are much more sophisticated.  Unfortuantly, much of the teaching drops away as Caine becomes more adept at managing the situations that he finds himself in.The DVDs also have a few special features -- such as Carradine having dinner with people who appeared in the series over the years while they reminisced.  I can't say that I enjoyed watching them, but I did learn a number of things about the series:  Did you know that the ""rice paper"" was actually butcher paper because they couldn't find a roll of rice paper -- and, that you couldn't tear it if you tried -- and they did!My only ocomplaint is that the sound quality is very marginal -- almost poor. I run the sound through my Yamaha amp and tower speakers and, in order to hear it I have to have the volume turned up to 3/4s which would typically have the windows rattling.  In addition, the left channel keeps cutting out.  But, once you get past all that stuff, the audio is at least clear and understandable.I highly recommend this package.",4,Great series -- marginal sound quality,1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,1761,"['have', 'been', 're', 'enjoying', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'teenager', 'series', 'original', 'pilot', 'movie', 'essential', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'rest', 'series', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'get', 'bits', 'pieces', 'thrown', 'where', 'Caine', 'came', 'why', '.It', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'box', 'season', 'foldout', '4', 'DVDs', 'own', 'box', 'bigger', 'one', 'are', 'nicely', 'illustrated', 'amazing', 'thing', 'watch', 'how', 'season', '1', 'differed', 'season', '2', 'turn', 'differed', 'saeson', '3', 'first', 'season', 'Caine', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'are', 'naive', 'simplified', 'season', '2', '3rd', 'season', 'where', 'Caine', 'as', 'well', 'stories', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Unfortuantly', 'much', 'teaching', 'away', 'Caine', 'more', 'adept', 'managing', 'situations', 'in.The', 'DVDs', 'also', 'have', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'Carradine', 'having', 'dinner', 'people', 'who', 'appeared', 'series', 'years', 'reminisced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'did', 'learn', 'number', 'things', 'series', 'Did', 'know', 'rice', 'paper', 'was', 'actually', 'butcher', 'paper', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'roll', 'rice', 'paper', 'could', ""n't"", 'tear', 'tried', 'did', 'My', 'only', 'ocomplaint', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'marginal', 'almost', 'poor', 'run', 'sound', 'Yamaha', 'amp', 'tower', 'speakers', 'order', 'hear', 'have', 'have', 'volume', 'turned', 'up', '3/4s', 'would', 'typically', 'have', 'windows', 'rattling', 'addition', 'left', 'channel', 'cutting', 'out', 'once', 'get', 'stuff', 'audio', 'least', 'clear', 'understandable.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'package']",Kung Fu: The Complete Series Collection

1112737,A1AES697PC2IW5,B000X07TLA,"Kevin Kiersky ""oceaneagle""","[1, 1]","The ""Kung Fu"" series [starring ""Grasshopper"" David Carradine and many other good folks] is one of the few TV shows I have always liked. I have mostly given-up on most recent TV -- due to the lack of long-running quality shows such as ""Kung Fu"". One great exception is the fairly recent ""Andromeda"" series -- which also combines action adventure with a strong ethic guiding the heros, led by their starship captain, in restoring law-and-order civilization during a galactic dark age. There is some quite good martial arts action and a little deep philosophy in that fine show. But, in contrast, ""Kung Fu"" has only one lonely hero versus first Imperial China and later Wild West America. This ex-Shaolin Monk half-breed wanderer must survive in an alien and violent setting [especially for him] -- The Old Wild West. Yet, he follows his Shaolin ethics while using his Shaolin Kung Fu indirectly, and directly as he must, to survive and help others.When I was quite young, I would try to watch every episode of ""Kung Fu"" -- catching every run and rerun that I could find via TV. I was very inspired by ""Kung Fu"". I continued to watch all of it I could -- even after starting my own study of The Art-and-Way via ""Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu"" -- a distant offspring of Shaolin Kung Fu. Jeet Kune Do and Bruce Lee are technically as great as can be -- and well worth carefully studying -- but I have been more personally inspired by ""Kung Fu"" and ""Grasshopper"" David Carradine. Oddly, Bruce Lee was hoping to star in ""Kung Fu"" -- but for various reasons was turned-down in favor of Carradine -- which is well-and-good cause now we have them both.Eventually, one of my big concerns was ""whether Carradine really followed The Art-and-Way"". Almost all of the Kung Fu action in ""Kung Fu"" is slowed-way-down -- allowing us to see it well -- but also allowing for David Carradine to be ""micro-directed"" by someone who really knew The Art-and-Way. Well, Carradine started slowly to get involved in The Art-and-Way -- via his Tai Chi Praying Mantis ""micro-director"" -- and later was fully into Tai Chi Praying Mantis and The Art-and-Way. So, I recall, with some amused chagrin nowadays, me later ""wondering about who tossed-together those Tai Chi and Praying Mantis moves with some odd Jiujitsu, in slow-motion, to fool us"". Now, I realize it is some pretty good Tai Chi Praying Mantis -- with some associated Chin Na grappling and some other moves. The interesting much newer sci-fi-action [space opera western] ""Firefy"" series has a similar odd blend of China-and-America and a fair amount of Kung Fu -- well, really a hybrid of Ballet, Savate Kickboxing and Kung Fu.The ""Kung Fu"" series is quite un-dated, very viewable and inspiring even now -- the plots, scenes, action and characters are as excellent as ever. It is still a singular creative pioneering show -- well worth the cost to get the whole series in this big box-set. ""When you can remove this DVD from my hand, Grasshopper, you will not be able to stop taking the rest one-by-one"".

But because current America needs the messages in this show.I love the ""subversive"" teachings in this show. The classic Western is cowboys ""solving"" a problem with their guns and fists. It was the mythos of 1950s: the John Wayne type. These historical roots go deep for us Americans. The early English settlers saw the wild land and its indigenous people as dark and threatening, something to be defeated. (Extreme example: the plunderering, murderous Spanish Conquistadores.)Then you have Kung Fu in the 1970s showing us how shallow is the ""brute force control"" approach to life. (God bless those flower children, and forgive their drug addictions.)The character Kwai Chang Caine is a Shaolin monk, which comes from the Chinese Chan Buddhist tradition. Chan is the equivalent of Japanese Zen, which I know a little about. Zen teaches living in the present, which is really the only time you can live in. Also, letting go of anger, hatred, prejudices, regrets of the past, fears for the future, cravings for yet more stuff. We Westerners on our treadmill of materialism, ""success,"" and ""control"" could find a lot of peace from these kinds of teachings.Buddhist style meditation, for example, has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety and depression, and also to foster compassion. There are many science-based books on this topic, such asMindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic Worldby Dr. Mark Williams at Oxford.Buddhism, in its essential form, isn't a religion so much as a program of personal self-help. It's about accepting your reality (whatever that may be) and finding peace. Anyone can use Buddhist tools whatever their religious belief system. I'm a Christian personally, but Buddhist ideas have helped me a lot in my life. They actually help me become a better Christian.",5,Excellent messages.

We gladly bought the three season package to share the experience with my two daughters, making a family summer of revisiting the series. The praise found in the reviews here speaks for the quality of the show. The quality of the DVD set, well that's a little frustrating. Here are the three big things you need to know about the collection, from big to huge:BIG: Errors in old TV shows framing: Back then 480 resolution was all they had to deal with, now transfered to 1080p with modern black levels, shows this old often reveal things that were hidden from the audience when they first aired. Occasionally you see a powerline, or notice from cut-to-cut that the daylight was WAY lower earlier in the scene than later.  All this can be corrected with relatively cheap CGI efforts, but no such effort was made on this collection.BIGGER: No film restoration. In some cases the color correction is really bad, faded film, hairs in the transfer gate, spots and flickers that would have been treated and returned to original print quality in a more porperly restored version of the series are just left as is. You get the feeling they spun old prints through a transfer chamber and called it a day. Lazy work.HUGE: Way back when Kung Fu was cancelled some lame brains at the network decided to air the last six shows out of order to capitalize on sweeps ratings, making the six story arc ending of the series occur with the last three preceding the first three. An easy fix, the DVD makers could have put the shows in the correct story order and list the air-dates on the insert material. They didn't, however, simpley following the air order instead of the intended story order. GOOD GRIEF.  Fortunately, this can be fixed. When you get to the very last DVD of the series, watch the B-side first, then the A-side last, and you get the correct story arc. It is worth the effort to do this!!!!!!!Sad about the lazy DVD work, but -- if this is how you have to get such a great show, the flaws are not bad enough that you should pass up the opportunity!",5,"Great series worth watching, not the best DVD treatment",1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,2133,"['can', 'not', 'find', 'words', 'strong', 'enough', 'support', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'must', 'see', 'gladly', 'bought', 'three', 'season', 'package', 'share', 'experience', 'two', 'daughters', 'making', 'family', 'summer', 'revisiting', 'series', 'praise', 'found', 'reviews', 'here', 'quality', 'show', 'quality', 'DVD', 'set', 'well', 'little', 'frustrating', 'Here', 'are', 'three', 'big', 'things', 'need', 'know', 'collection', 'big', 'huge', 'BIG', 'Errors', 'old', 'TV', 'framing', 'Back', 'then', '480', 'resolution', 'was', 'had', 'deal', 'now', 'transfered', '1080p', 'modern', 'black', 'levels', 'old', 'often', 'reveal', 'things', 'were', 'hidden', 'audience', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'Occasionally', 'see', 'powerline', 'notice', 'cut-to-cut', 'daylight', 'was', 'WAY', 'lower', 'earlier', 'scene', 'later', 'can', 'be', 'corrected', 'relatively', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'efforts', 'such', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'collection.BIGGER', 'film', 'restoration', 'cases', 'color', 'correction', 'really', 'bad', 'faded', 'film', 'hairs', 'transfer', 'gate', 'spots', 'flickers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'returned', 'original', 'print', 'quality', 'more', 'porperly', 'restored', 'version', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'as', 'get', 'feeling', 'spun', 'old', 'prints', 'transfer', 'chamber', 'called', 'day', 'Lazy', 'work.HUGE', 'Way', 'back', 'when', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'was', 'cancelled', 'lame', 'brains', 'network', 'decided', 'air', 'last', 'six', 'order', 'capitalize', 'sweeps', 'ratings', 'making', 'six', 'story', 'ending', 'series', 'occur', 'last', 'three', 'preceding', 'first', 'three', 'easy', 'fix', 'DVD', 'makers', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'shows', 'correct', 'story', 'order', 'list', 'air-dates', 'insert', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'however', 'simpley', 'following', 'air', 'order', 'instead', 'intended', 'story', 'order', 'GOOD', 'GRIEF', 'Fortunately', 'can', 'be', 'fixed', 'When', 'get', 'very', 'last', 'DVD', 'series', 'watch', 'B-side', 'first', 'then', 'A-side', 'last', 'get', 'correct', 'story', 'arc', 'effort', 'do', 'Sad', 'lazy', 'DVD', 'work', 'how', 'have', 'get', 'such', 'great', 'show', 'flaws', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'should', 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity']",Kung Fu: The Complete Series Collection

Nice philosophy is given as flashbacks in the temple during his journeys.  Music is nice, has a nice melody and is somewhat melancholy, but very enjoyable.DVD packaging, disks and cases: attractive package, double-sided disks, fold-out, hard-case plastic with those dreaded CENTER PUSH mechanisms that don't let the disks out easy-- you know, the ones that break when pushed, and don't release the disk, and the ones that ALL CONSUMERS dislike and many manufacturers keep making!

DVDs have English subtitles that is VERY ESSENTIAL for hard of hearing, noisy environments, and children and persons learning English.DVD Arrangement: good with highlighted episodes in the case and summaries.
