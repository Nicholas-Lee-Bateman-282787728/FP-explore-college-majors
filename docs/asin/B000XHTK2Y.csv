I mean, Giant, radiated landcrabs who devour humans and take on their personalities?? What could be better?! This stars Russell Johnson (It Came From Outer Space, This Island Earth) and is one of Roger Corman's best directorial efforts. However, this particular dvd release is awful! It's some dvd-r burned version of some vhs tape that must have sat melting in the hot sun! Too bad, as the movie itself is a personal favorite.

1114176,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000XHTK2Y,calvinnme,"[9, 10]","The popular internet film database that everyone goes to for advice on films rates this as 3.7/10. For a B horror film from the late 1950's, I totally disagree. This film is between 7 and 8 out of 10. It blends the typical tale of the late 50's of scientists investigating strange happenings and reaping the effects of the nuclear age. The entire film is just over an hour in length, so it doesn't have a chance to drag. Until I saw it on TCM, I have only seen second-rate DVD copies since I first saw it on the late show on some UHF station back in 1972 when I was babysitting. The acting and dialogue are adequate enough, and you have your obligatory late 1950's beautiful female scientist thrown into the mix to add a touch of spice. The idea of mutated creatures growing gigantic in size and turning on the human population had been done before. The gimick that makes this film unique is that the giant crabs ingest the minds of their victims as well, including their knowledge and cunning which they now turn against their surviving former companions. The disembodied victims then ""speak"" to the survivors through metal objects, either trying to trick them or warning them that ""resistance is futile"". In the end, only two of the scientists survive - I won't tell you which two. Great fun and a good blend of camp (the rubber crabs and claws) and horror.As far as video quality, the copy I saw on Turner Classic Movies last night is the best I've ever seen - video and audio-wise it was perfection. The DVD rights to Allied Artists' movies, of which this is one, belong to Warner Home Video. Thus I would not be surprised if this was a warm-up broadcast for a film to be released in Warners' Cult Camp Classics series, which is how they have been releasing the other Allied Artists B-rated horror and sci-fi films. Thus, I would advise waiting and seeing if Warner does indeed release the copy I saw last night. The wait would be worth it. The copies currently on DVD, including this one, just don't measure up.",4,"Roger Corman turns ""you are what you eat"" into a novel horror tale",1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,2016,"['popular', 'internet', 'film', 'database', 'everyone', 'advice', 'films', 'rates', '3.7/10', 'B', 'horror', 'film', 'late', '1950', 'totally', 'disagree', 'film', '7', '8', '10', 'typical', 'tale', 'late', '50', 'scientists', 'investigating', 'strange', 'happenings', 'reaping', 'effects', 'nuclear', 'age', 'entire', 'film', 'just', 'hour', 'length', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'drag', 'saw', 'TCM', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'second-rate', 'DVD', 'copies', 'first', 'saw', 'late', 'show', 'UHF', 'station', 'back', '1972', 'when', 'was', 'babysitting', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'are', 'adequate', 'enough', 'have', 'obligatory', 'late', '1950', 'beautiful', 'female', 'scientist', 'thrown', 'mix', 'add', 'touch', 'spice', 'idea', 'mutated', 'creatures', 'growing', 'gigantic', 'size', 'turning', 'human', 'population', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'gimick', 'film', 'unique', 'giant', 'crabs', 'ingest', 'minds', 'victims', 'well', 'including', 'knowledge', 'cunning', 'now', 'turn', 'surviving', 'former', 'companions', 'disembodied', 'victims', 'then', 'speak', 'survivors', 'metal', 'objects', 'either', 'trying', 'trick', 'warning', 'resistance', 'futile', 'end', 'only', 'two', 'scientists', 'survive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'two', 'Great', 'fun', 'good', 'blend', 'camp', 'rubber', 'crabs', 'claws', 'far', 'video', 'quality', 'copy', 'saw', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'last', 'night', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'video', 'audio-wise', 'was', 'perfection', 'DVD', 'rights', 'Allied', 'Artists', 'movies', 'one', 'belong', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'Thus', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'was', 'warm-up', 'broadcast', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'Warners', 'Cult', 'Camp', 'Classics', 'series', 'how', 'have', 'been', 'releasing', 'other', 'Allied', 'B-rated', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'Thus', 'would', 'advise', 'waiting', 'seeing', 'Warner', 'indeed', 'release', 'copy', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'wait', 'would', 'be', 'copies', 'currently', 'DVD', 'including', 'one', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up']",N/A

1114178,A3CMS67WI1C36V,B000XHTK2Y,Michael W. Dean,"[3, 4]","""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" was a popular television staple back in the 1960s.  In the last 40 years the film has been rarely shown, especially when the (now defunct) Allied Artists' television syndication packages expired.  This example of Roger Corman's low budget inventiveness is often remembered with a feeling of nostalgia.  Unfortunately, the Apex DVD has some of the worst image quality I've ever seen on DVD.  The DVD contains Allied Artist's U.S. television version, which was padded to 70 minutes, which looks like is was copied from a poor quality public domain videocassete which was mastered from a well used 16mm print.",2,Disappointing DVD,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,636,"['Attack', 'Crab', 'Monsters', 'was', 'popular', 'television', 'staple', 'back', '1960s', 'last', '40', 'years', 'film', 'been', 'rarely', 'shown', 'especially', 'when', 'now', 'Allied', 'Artists', 'television', 'syndication', 'packages', 'expired', 'example', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'low', 'budget', 'inventiveness', 'often', 'remembered', 'feeling', 'nostalgia', 'Unfortunately', 'Apex', 'DVD', 'worst', 'image', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'contains', 'Allied', 'Artist', 'U.S.', 'television', 'version', 'was', 'padded', '70', 'minutes', 'was', 'copied', 'poor', 'quality', 'public', 'domain', 'videocassete', 'was', 'mastered', 'well', 'used', '16mm', 'print']",N/A

While ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS is a very good movie in and of itself, the quality of this DVD was just so poor, it was virtually unwatchable, first of all, there was no menu to speak of, the menu that was there looks like it was done off a computer and the quality of the movie itself looked like something out of a second generation copy of an original video tape (a copy of a copy).  too bright in some spots, too dark in others, I'm glad I only spent 11.99 for it or I'd be pissed, the two stars I gave it were for the time I gave to give this review.
