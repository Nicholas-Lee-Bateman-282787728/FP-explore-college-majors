However this devil of a film was cute for the 1980'a.Bill Cosby is a soul Arranger who give a recently dead Max Devlin (Elliot Gould) a chance to return to earth. His assignment for two months to get three innocent souls to sell their souls. Cosby as Devil is almost as fun as George Burns was in Oh God You Devil. I will say this, when Cos is on screen, he steals the scene away from Gold everytime.On the other hand, Gould plays a slick con man who is not the sharpest tool in the box. His wide-eyes deer in the headlights look makes his heroic Devlin like  most Disney main characters. Gould's simple Devlin does not try to be heroic, it comes out at the endAs flawed and as dated as this film is (its almost 27 years old), it still holds up as a family film.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLDThis cute comedy does not sound preachy. It is Disney with a slight edge. It is a nice family film, it seems dated, but still its good.",5,Oh Cos You Devil,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,969,"['1980', 'were', 'not', 'Disney', 'heyday', 'films', 'However', 'devil', 'film', 'was', 'cute', '1980', 'a.Bill', 'Cosby', 'soul', 'Arranger', 'who', 'give', 'recently', 'dead', 'Max', 'Devlin', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'chance', 'return', 'earth', 'assignment', 'two', 'months', 'get', 'three', 'innocent', 'souls', 'sell', 'souls', 'Cosby', 'Devil', 'almost', 'as', 'fun', 'George', 'Burns', 'was', 'Oh', 'God', 'Devil', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'Cos', 'screen', 'scene', 'away', 'Gold', 'everytime.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Gould', 'slick', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'sharpest', 'tool', 'box', 'wide-eyes', 'deer', 'headlights', 'look', 'heroic', 'Devlin', 'most', 'Disney', 'main', 'characters', 'Gould', 'simple', 'Devlin', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'heroic', 'out', 'endAs', 'flawed', 'as', 'dated', 'film', 'almost', '27', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'up', 'family', 'film.Bennet', 'Pomerantz', 'AUDIOWORLDThis', 'cute', 'comedy', 'not', 'sound', 'preachy', 'Disney', 'slight', 'edge', 'nice', 'family', 'film', 'dated', 'still', 'good']",N/A

Not exactly, but you are stuck in a bad movie.  In order to keep from being a permanent resident of Hell, on level 4, he has to consign the souls of three kids (two teenagers and a seven year old boy) to the devil (Bill Cosby).  Max does exactly that, through various means of trickery and deceit, even marrying the mother of the boy he's trying to send to hell.  How any of this can be misconstrued as a comedy is anyone's guess.  Worse.  It's even purported to be a romance, although how romantic can it be if you're only after a woman for her son's soul?Not terribly inspired, with few if any laughs.  Cosby smirks, Gould looks rumpled (and so is his performance).  At least Julie Budd gets to sing one great song to close out the movie (this is the only bright spot in an otherwise tedious affair).It should be noted that this is one of three films that forced Walt Disney Productions to form Touchstone Pictures just to handle the less than `Disney' approved movies (this is supposedly the first Disney film to contain profanity).",2,"""One day you're going to drag home a murderer!""",1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1182,"['Elliott', 'Gould', 'Max', 'Devlin', 'shiftless', 'landlord', 'literally', 'thrown', 'bus', 'dies', 'transported', 'hell', ""'m"", 'having', 'bad', 'dream', 'Not', 'exactly', 'are', 'stuck', 'bad', 'movie', 'order', 'keep', 'being', 'permanent', 'resident', 'Hell', 'level', '4', 'consign', 'souls', 'three', 'kids', 'two', 'teenagers', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'devil', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Max', 'exactly', 'various', 'means', 'trickery', 'deceit', 'even', 'marrying', 'mother', 'boy', 'trying', 'send', 'hell', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'misconstrued', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'guess', 'Worse', 'even', 'purported', 'be', 'romance', 'how', 'romantic', 'can', 'be', ""'re"", 'only', 'woman', 'son', 'soul', 'Not', 'terribly', 'inspired', 'few', 'laughs', 'Cosby', 'smirks', 'Gould', 'rumpled', 'so', 'performance', 'least', 'Julie', 'Budd', 'sing', 'one', 'great', 'song', 'close', 'out', 'movie', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'otherwise', 'tedious', 'affair', '.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'one', 'three', 'films', 'forced', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Productions', 'form', 'Touchstone', 'Pictures', 'just', 'handle', 'less', 'Disney', 'approved', 'movies', 'supposedly', 'first', 'Disney', 'film', 'contain', 'profanity']",N/A
480721,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,6305840059,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[21, 22]","One of Bill Cosby's first mainstream films and a hoot a minute.  The real star is supposed to Elliot Gould and he is indeed great as Max Devlin, a not so nice chappie who is hit by a bus and finds that he has gone to hell and hell is not a very nice place...In order to stay out of the infernal flames the Devil gives him a second chance, go back to earth and persuade three innocent people to sell their souls to the Devil.  Max is all for it at first and to make sure he completes his task he is accompanied back to the land of the living by one of the Devil's helpers, played to perfection by Bill Cosby.  The film isn't what you would call a mover and shaker when it comes to the storyline, the plot and the characters, but it fun and it will make you laugh.  Max soon finds that he has gained a conscience as he tries to persuade his three victims to sign over their souls and he falls in love with the mother of his young victim played admirably by Adam Rich.  Add to this a wonderful soundtrack, the song, &quot;Roses and Rainbows,&quot; sung by Julie Budd is a cracker and you have a film that will have you chortling and crying in the same breath.  Cosby is delicious as the Devil's helper who isn't really as bad as he tries to make out, and he certainly proves that he is a hell of an actor (ouch that pun hurt!) in this gloriously funny and poignant film about, man, the devil and the human heart.",5,A Hilarious Film of Devlish Proportions,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,1409,"['One', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'first', 'mainstream', 'films', 'hoot', 'minute', 'real', 'star', 'supposed', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'indeed', 'great', 'Max', 'Devlin', 'not', 'so', 'nice', 'chappie', 'who', 'hit', 'bus', 'gone', 'hell', 'hell', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'place', 'order', 'stay', 'infernal', 'Devil', 'second', 'chance', 'go', 'back', 'earth', 'persuade', 'three', 'innocent', 'people', 'sell', 'souls', 'Devil', 'Max', 'first', 'make', 'sure', 'task', 'accompanied', 'back', 'land', 'living', 'one', 'Devil', 'helpers', 'played', 'perfection', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'film', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'call', 'mover', 'shaker', 'when', 'storyline', 'plot', 'characters', 'fun', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'Max', 'soon', 'gained', 'conscience', 'persuade', 'three', 'victims', 'sign', 'over', 'souls', 'love', 'mother', 'young', 'victim', 'played', 'admirably', 'Adam', 'Rich', 'Add', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'song', 'quot', 'Roses', 'Rainbows', 'quot', 'sung', 'Julie', 'Budd', 'cracker', 'have', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'chortling', 'crying', 'same', 'breath', 'Cosby', 'delicious', 'Devil', 'helper', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'bad', 'make', 'out', 'certainly', 'hell', 'actor', 'ouch', 'pun', 'hurt', 'gloriously', 'funny', 'poignant', 'film', 'man', 'devil', 'human', 'heart']",N/A
