The sounds of rivers and water buffaloes which are blended with the rural landscape appear to be in harmony which sometimes make the viewer feel that he is in there.  Although the cinematography is well worth it,the plot is rather weak and some of the scenes appear dragging which reminds me of some articles in National Geographic Magazines. However, the actors and actresses I think did their part well. We would welcome more movies about Vietnam.",4,Beautiful scenery with its remarkable sounds.,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,557,"['are', 'interested', 'watching', 'scenes', 'rural', 'Vietnam', 'may', 'serve', 'become', 'one', 'collection', 'sounds', 'rivers', 'water', 'buffaloes', 'are', 'blended', 'rural', 'landscape', 'appear', 'be', 'harmony', 'sometimes', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'there', 'cinematography', 'well', 'worth', 'plot', 'rather', 'weak', 'scenes', 'appear', 'dragging', 'articles', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Magazines', 'However', 'actors', 'actresses', 'think', 'did', 'part', 'well', 'would', 'welcome', 'more', 'movies', 'Vietnam']",N/A
966017,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000E1NWHS,Craig Connell,"[7, 9]","Frankly, I am surprised I hung with this movie because it's pretty slow. It's not a real ""entertainer,"" except for two things: 1 - the camera-work is nice at times; 2 - the story is quite different from anything we are accustomed to in the West. But after two-thirds of this story had elapsed, it was tough going the rest of the way. It's not an uplifting story, either. It left me feeling depressed. Yet, it IS a memorable film and I'm glad I watched it. Does that make sense?Floods, family, friends, enemies, thieves, sex, loyalty, poverty and abandonment and generally what life is like for those people in this story.  With all the water around them, they couldn't bury their loved ones until the dry season came. They wrapped them up and put them on poles, and hoped the crows didn't peck away at the bodies.  There are enough bizarre (for us) scenes like this, plus the fine cinematography, to make this a film with a few scenes you won't forget.You wouldn't want to live here, at the southern tip of Vietnam with these rainy, long flood seasons. Lugging a couple of Water Buffaloes through waist-deep muddy water for miles can't be a great existence, either.  This is a tough story of people surviving under tough circumstances.",3,You Wouldn't Want To Live This Kind Of Life!,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,1235,"['Frankly', 'am', 'surprised', 'hung', 'movie', 'pretty', 'slow', 'not', 'real', 'entertainer', 'two', 'things', '1', 'camera-work', 'nice', 'times', '2', 'story', 'quite', 'different', 'anything', 'are', 'accustomed', 'West', 'two-thirds', 'story', 'had', 'elapsed', 'was', 'tough', 'going', 'rest', 'way', 'not', 'uplifting', 'story', 'either', 'left', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'memorable', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'make', 'sense', 'Floods', 'family', 'friends', 'enemies', 'thieves', 'sex', 'loyalty', 'poverty', 'abandonment', 'generally', 'what', 'life', 'people', 'story', 'water', 'could', ""n't"", 'bury', 'loved', 'ones', 'dry', 'season', 'came', 'wrapped', 'up', 'put', 'poles', 'hoped', 'crows', 'did', ""n't"", 'peck', 'away', 'bodies', 'are', 'enough', 'bizarre', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'make', 'film', 'few', 'scenes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget.You', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'here', 'southern', 'tip', 'Vietnam', 'rainy', 'long', 'flood', 'seasons', 'Lugging', 'couple', 'Water', 'Buffaloes', 'waist-deep', 'muddy', 'water', 'miles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'existence', 'either', 'tough', 'story', 'people', 'surviving', 'tough', 'circumstances']",N/A
