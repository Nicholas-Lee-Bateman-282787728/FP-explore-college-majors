A great concert even if it was only their second gig in this line-up. Had high expectations for the blu-ray, which took ages to be released.

1660019,A1MMWID822EN70,B00DOQK2HS,Rock Yours,"[7, 10]","The project of this super group was meant to last a couple of shows, but with the public request, the band decided to did a full tour without their own technicians and crew. The band is comfortable playing together on this night. The level of musicianship is high and not too many notes are left out. The music is a celebration of songs played in the past from all the members involved. All songs are instrumental, except ""Shy Boy"", a strait forward rock song. The Japan audience was expecting a demonstration of some impressive technique on how to play guitar, bass, keyboards and drums,at a fast pace and that's what they got.The overall sound of the music is similar to Planet-X, obviously because of the presence of Derek Sherinian and Tony Macalpine. The camera work is quick following the pace of the music with many close shots that place you in the stage with the musicians. The picture in high definition doesn't disappoint. As far as the sound mix in HD-Master, it's mostly for ambiance, but prepare to jump out of your seat in one occasion.While i have enjoyed the Blu-Ray, i don't think i would listen anymore to this kind of music in my audio system very much in the future, but those who are following Planet-X and the projects of Macalpine and Sheehan, will not want to miss this concert.",3,"Very good product, but ...",1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1303,"['project', 'super', 'group', 'was', 'meant', 'last', 'couple', 'shows', 'public', 'request', 'band', 'decided', 'did', 'full', 'tour', 'own', 'technicians', 'crew', 'band', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'together', 'night', 'level', 'musicianship', 'high', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'notes', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'music', 'celebration', 'songs', 'played', 'past', 'members', 'involved', 'songs', 'are', 'instrumental', 'Shy', 'Boy', 'strait', 'forward', 'rock', 'song', 'Japan', 'audience', 'was', 'expecting', 'demonstration', 'impressive', 'technique', 'how', 'play', 'guitar', 'bass', 'keyboards', 'drums', 'fast', 'pace', 'what', 'got.The', 'overall', 'sound', 'music', 'similar', 'Planet-X', 'obviously', 'presence', 'Derek', 'Sherinian', 'Tony', 'Macalpine', 'camera', 'work', 'quick', 'following', 'pace', 'music', 'many', 'close', 'shots', 'place', 'stage', 'musicians', 'picture', 'high', 'definition', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'As', 'far', 'sound', 'mix', 'HD-Master', 'mostly', 'ambiance', 'prepare', 'jump', 'seat', 'one', 'occasion.While', 'i', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Blu-Ray', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'i', 'would', 'listen', 'anymore', 'kind', 'music', 'audio', 'system', 'very', 'much', 'future', 'who', 'are', 'following', 'Planet-X', 'projects', 'Macalpine', 'Sheehan', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'concert']",Live in Tokyo
