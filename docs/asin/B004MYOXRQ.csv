I started with a set of Inspector Lewis after seeing one episode on Masterpiece Theatre.  Then I went to Miss Marple, Poirot, and Midsomer Murders.  Having been so pleased with the previous selections I tried Murdoch Mysteries most recently, and was delighted with the turn of the century Victorian setting and the chemistry between Murdoch and the adorable female medical examiner.  I find it amusing that it's not uncommon in British Murder Mysteries, to have two or three murders in one episode.  They don't seem to be surprised...""It's all in a days work.""  Detective Murdoch has invented many primitive  examples of modern day criminal testing equipment.  I have enjoyed this series so much I now have Seasons One, Two and Three.

Comedy, mystery, adventure and romance unite perfectly in a Victorian setting based on Maureen Jennings novels. You get Victorian crime with contemporary evidence gathering techniques. Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) is a century ahead of his forensic sleuthing counterparts. Dr. Ogden (Helene Joy) is the gorgeous pathologist in the forensics search--the morgue maiden. Victorian 'sparks' happen between Murdoch and Dr.O, at his discretionary Victorian rate. Romantic chemistry cleverly woven into murder investigations. Insp. Brackenreid (Thomas Craig) ex-army & boss, plus Crabtree (Jonny Harris) ambitious right-hand man, are back in every episode. Guest stars a-plenty. There will NEVER be too many episodes of this exciting/fun TV series.All episodes are police investigations with interesting new technology (new to the period) or science helping find clues. Marvelously inventive in plot and beautiful to view it the realistic Victorian era. Perfection in sets, costumes, and props. It's no wonder it is award grabbing (over 2 dozen to date) and still continues on TV.It is murder situations, with some violence and blood (especially in Dr.O's morgue clue-gathering scenes), and multiple plot episodes. Highly recommended for the mystery, crime, and even Victorian romance fans.Bonus of film presentations ""About Murdoch Mysteries"" ""Make-Up"" ""Costume Design"" & episode 13 ""The Tesla Effect Alternate Ending"" with all including subtitles.Episodes have SDH SUBTITLES:_._1 The Murdoch Identity- Murdoch, minus memory, is chased by gunmen & saved by a pub owner Anna (Lisa Faulkner-`Murder in Suburbia). A cop-temp, Hamish (Patrick McKenna-`Red Green Show') helps save the day. Interesting morgue view of a large diameter bullet hole clean through the cadaver's head._._2 The Great Wall- Station 4's Murdoch is summoned to St. 5 for a cop killing in China Town. A China Rx shop owner is accused but there is conflicting evidence._._3 Victor, Victorian- A new Freemason member is poisoned. Why does Dr. Ogden say the victim's ID is wrong? A Masonic nightmare?_._4 Rich Boy, Poor Boy- Brackenreid's son is snatched. Was a purse snatcher involved in the kidnapping? Was another kid the intended victim? Very emotional._._5 Me, Myself and Murdoch- 60th birthday axe murder with the daughter (Anastasia Phillips) found holding the axe. Devil possession, amnesia, or schizophrenia? Dr. Roberts (Paul Ames) will find clues via hypnosis._._6 This One Goes to Eleven- Rembrandt's nude painting disappears from the elevator between floors leaving the guard dead. The case explodes into a forgery conspiracy. Owners, Sally (Kate Greenhouse) & James Pendrick (Peter Stebbings) are suspect and these guest stars will reappear in 3 later episodes in new/renewed plots._._7 Blood and Circuses- Death by circus tiger and the whole circus do a runner. All are arrested making Station 4 a circus. Crabtree as always gets in some good one-liners. Surprising results from Ogden's autopsy of trainer and tiger. Ivy lady (Ashley Leggat) & Lady Minerva (Lally Cadeau) are two guest stars playing circus stars._._8 Future Imperfect- Pendrick hosts a gathering for human selective breeding, eugenicists, attended by H.G. Wells and Ruby (Sarah Gadon) Dr. O's sis. Unfortunately a dog also attends carrying a severed human arm._._9 Love and Human Remains- 2 bodies found in peat at a building site. Death time is puzzling but the bodies cause a family reunion, including an old couple who once lived at the location; the Hastings (Myron Natwick) & (Joan Gregson). Death by cyanide, but how? Subplot finds Crabtree's cousin in town._._10 The Curse of Beaton Manor- Dead but pushed or jumped? Death by a ghost? Suspicious death is a habit at Beaton Manor, members played by guest stars William Godfrey, Jonathan Goad, Jordan Pettle, and Stephanie Langton._._11 Hangman- After his hanging the victim leaps off the autopsy table. Fox (Hardee T. Lineham) gave himself a tracheotomy to air. Other guest stars are Eric Peterson & Peter Donaldson. Murdoch is at the end of his rope on this case._._12 In the Alltogether- Strangulation in the park and risqu&eacute; postcards found of the victim leading to a pornographer (Ennis Esmer) studio. Sally Pendrick photos also found, oops. A return, but different look, at this guest star. Murder and blackmail while Ogden gets impatient with a romance subplot._._13 The Tesla Effect- Electrocution by microwave. Guest star Peter Keleghan is back as a govt. spy looking for a new weapon and Tesla (Dmitry Chepovetsky) is a returned guest to solve the puzzle of a cooked corpse. Crabtree hopes to test a yam. The Pendricks are back too, and Ogden is largely ignored in a returning subplot as she considers a new job in Buffalo.Check the listing for Murdoch Mysteries Series 1 & 2.
