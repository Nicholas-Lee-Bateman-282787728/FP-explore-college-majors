928517,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000AM6OVW,Doug Anderson,"[6, 6]","In recent years there has been a crop of small films that recall those great small films of the early to mid-70's. Into the Wild (2007) and Wendy and Lucy (2008) are prime examples of this phenomenon, but My Summer of Love (2004) might be the most interesting. It certainly leaves a lasting impression. Really two things leave a lasting impression: the bleak but beautiful Yorkshire valley (which serves as a kind of refuge for two wild creatures that refuse to be contained by social mores/norms) and Emily Blunt's performance (which to this day remains her signature role).My favorite films from the 70's were the small films that shunned conventional narrative techniques and celebrated the psychological states of individuals who also shunned convention. I am thinking of Barbet Schroeder's More and La Vallee, Antonioni's Zabriskie Point, Altman's Images and Three Women, Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock, and the recently re-released Frank Perry film The Last Summer (1969). These films celebrated little moments of liberation, but they also acknowledged the fleeting nature of liberation, and the cynicism that often rested at the heart of the liberatory impulse. The reason so many of these films were made in the early to mid-seventies was because that was the moment when post WWII, 1950's, and 1960's optimism faded and turned into 1970's skepticism and selfism. In so many of the seventies films dreams of liberation are equated with self-delusion and/or self-destruction. In the 1960's to dream was to awaken to possibility; in the 1970's to dream was to refuse to see the world as it was. My Summer of Love is about two characters: one dreamer, and one cynic. But its also about how these contradictory impulses co-exist within each of us and how we negotiate between the two.Without giving away too much of the movie's mystery, I'll just say the way Tasmin (played by Emily Blunt) negotiates her own contradictory impulses is fascinating to watch. This is not only a wise and open-eyed study of the divided nature of post-adolescent psychology, but a wise and open-eyed study of the divided nature (and warring impulses) of western psychology.Highly recommended!",5,the dreamer and the cynic,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2174,"['recent', 'years', 'there', 'been', 'crop', 'small', 'films', 'recall', 'great', 'small', 'films', 'early', 'mid-70', 'Wild', '2007', 'Wendy', 'Lucy', '2008', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'phenomenon', 'My', 'Summer', 'Love', '2004', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'certainly', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Really', 'two', 'things', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'bleak', 'beautiful', 'Yorkshire', 'valley', 'kind', 'refuge', 'two', 'wild', 'creatures', 'refuse', 'be', 'contained', 'social', 'mores/norms', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'performance', 'day', 'signature', 'role', '.My', 'favorite', 'films', '70', 'were', 'small', 'films', 'shunned', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'techniques', 'celebrated', 'psychological', 'states', 'individuals', 'who', 'also', 'shunned', 'convention', 'am', 'thinking', 'Barbet', 'Schroeder', 'More', 'La', 'Vallee', 'Antonioni', 'Zabriskie', 'Point', 'Altman', 'Images', 'Three', 'Women', 'Weir', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', 'recently', 're-released', 'Frank', 'Perry', 'film', 'Last', 'Summer', '1969', 'films', 'celebrated', 'little', 'moments', 'liberation', 'also', 'acknowledged', 'fleeting', 'nature', 'liberation', 'cynicism', 'often', 'rested', 'heart', 'liberatory', 'impulse', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'early', 'mid-seventies', 'was', 'was', 'moment', 'when', 'post', 'WWII', '1950', '1960', 'optimism', 'faded', 'turned', '1970', 'skepticism', 'selfism', 'so', 'many', 'seventies', 'films', 'dreams', 'liberation', 'are', 'equated', 'self-delusion', 'and/or', 'self-destruction', '1960', 'dream', 'was', 'awaken', 'possibility', '1970', 'dream', 'was', 'refuse', 'see', 'world', 'was', 'Summer', 'Love', 'two', 'characters', 'one', 'dreamer', 'one', 'cynic', 'also', 'how', 'contradictory', 'impulses', 'co-exist', 'how', 'negotiate', 'two.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'mystery', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'way', 'Tasmin', 'played', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'own', 'contradictory', 'impulses', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'wise', 'open-eyed', 'study', 'divided', 'nature', 'post-adolescent', 'psychology', 'wise', 'open-eyed', 'study', 'divided', 'nature', 'warring', 'impulses', 'western', 'psychology.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

You can't point to the older brother and say, ""Oh, well he's just a religious nut."" They are people, and come across as such, with real faults and virtues, understandable and even lovable.And, that is why the film will never be popular. Things are not spelled out. You have to do more than just sit there watching and absorbing. You have to think as you watch the film. I have noticed that thinking is very unpleasant for most people, and they will do anything to avoid it. Hence they will mark the film low because ""it's thin on plot,"" or ""not enough dialogue."" Observe carefully, and read the body language and the facial expressions, in addition to hearing the dialogue. Then, you can understand and appreciate this excellent, beautiful, artistic film. Some of the scenes are just flat-out gorgeous, filmed in the countryside. The whole movie is like a vacation to which I wish I was invited.Also, needless to say, the two lovers in question are gorgeous. I like the Celtic one best because she has the most color, orange and blue. Just watching her face and her body is justification enough for the whole movie. She also has a pulse, unlike her icy cold, Neitzche-admiring, elitist companion who, while pretty, could never be captivating. She just seems immediately dangerous from the get-go. You would not want to leave a pair of sharp scissors around her.It's not a terribly sexy movie, in terms of flesh or action, and the lovers are naive first-timers, who probably need instruction on ""what to do"" and ""how to do it"". But then again, this ain't porn, but a romantic story about love. And it works as such. Very intelligent. Neat take on the whole ""religion versus atheism"" bag.

928520,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000AM6OVW,Galina,"[1, 1]","My Summer of Love (2004) is an independent British film directed by Pawel Pawlikovski which tells about two 16-year-old girls from different worlds, social groups and interests, who met one warm and sunny summer (and this happens in England) in idyllic rural Yorkshire.  Mona (Natalie Press),  a redhead with freckles lives in a small provincial town, comes from a working family,  rides a scooter with no motor and lives with her older brother Phil (Paddy Considine - as always convincing and pleasure to watch, although his role is rather thankless and the least interesting). Phil recently returned from prison, where he became a Born Again Christian. Upon his return, Phil rebuilt the pub, which he and Mona inherited from their mother into a house of worship. Natalie Press is simply delightful as Mona. She is  impulsive, trusting, cynical and lonely, tired and bored with poverty and dead end existence.  She is not well educated but is observant and has no illusions regarding what future has in store for her.  After this role, Press continues to appear in British independent films. The most notable and interesting - ""Night Watch"" (2008) by Peter Greenaway. The second girl, Tamsin - thin, slim, dark-haired student of the prestigious private school, where she had a negative impact on classmates, is  the daughter of wealthy parents who are never home. She is well-read, speaks the proper literary language, adores Edith Piaf and cites the well-known philosophers. She is ironic and terribly bored in her parents' suburban castle, where she spends the summer. One day while riding the horse, she meets a funny freckled girl with unruly mane of red hair. Emily Blunt was 21 when she played 16 years old charming manipulator Tamsin.  In two years after My Summer of Love, Blunt practically stole all her scenes in the blockbuster ""The Devil Wears Prada"" from Hollywood more famous actress Anne Hathaway. The role of Tamsin did not make Emily Blunt an overnight star but it without doubt signaled of  her promising future in acting.As different as they are, Tamsin and Mona shared one thing - loneliness, and they become fast friends with Mona staying overnight at Tamsin's house and spending all days together. The relationship progressed from  the mutual interest to friendship to to the intimacy when the girls become un-separated and sexually attracted to each other.  Soon they promised never ever separate and be always together. It seemed that summer and their love would never end but as it is often the case,  one loves without reservation truly and deeply, and the other takes the love and devotion for granted. I read some comments from the viewers rather disappointed with the ending. I personally found it quite logical and the only possible resolution or the Summer of Love. The film is short and lasts less than one and a half hours but during this time we have an opportunity to learn about heroines, to understand their motivations, longings and the reasons behind their actions. My Summer of Love is an interesting psychological drama, which explores the yearning of young souls and bodies, their desires and interests, and sadly concludes that after summer always comes autumn, time to return to the decadent temptations of a big city and to the boredom of provincial stalemate existence. Love, or however you would call the strong and mutual attraction that brought the girls together, would be replaced by bitter disappointment and shattered dreams. According to many interviews with the film writer/director, Pawel Pawlikowski, he did not try to make a film about typical teenage life in England, he wanted to give it a certain ""timeless feeling"". I think he succeeded in his intentions. The film takes place in Yorkshire, England in the 80s or was it the 70s? There are no computers, cell phones or iPods in sight, so, this story could happen any time at any place. It is honest, convincing, and engrossing. Both young actresses deserved and shared an Evening Standard British Film award for Most Promising Newcomer.

928524,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000AM6OVW,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[10, 10]","The maze of emotional turmoil and identity often overwhelms teens, as they seek personal ways of finding themselves through trial and error.  Some of these attempts are sometimes harmful and tormenting, yet the quest of finding oneself continues.  This troublesome quest to come of age intensifies when guidance is of short supply, which on occasion could make the situation far worse than necessary.  However, through this difficult time many youthful minds discover themselves through stressful and painful situations.  My Summer of Love offers an intriguing piece of cinema in regards to this phenomenon where adolescence faces the highly stressful time of self-discovery.The film opens with a scene where the story's protagonist Mona (Nathalie Press) sketches a portrait of someone directly on the wall.  Decisively, she pushes the pencil against the uneven surface, as shoulders, neck, and a face emerge through her unyielding determination to finish the drawing.  With red marker, she creates a frame around the portrait, which obviously seems to have some deeper meaning for Mona.  When she is done, she sits down on the floor and lights a cigarette while the finished product stares down at her.  This, seemingly out of place opening, suggests that the portrait has some significant meaning, but it remains a mystery to the audience until a later point of the film.When the storyline picks up the thread, a straightforward tale of how two polar opposite teen girls from two different social classes unites in a sensible tale of affection, belonging, and friendship.  The working class daughter Mona lives with her older brother and ex-convict, Phil (Paddy Considine), in an apartment above a pub.  Mona seems to have wandered into a personal void without any kind of guidance, as her mother has past away and Phil preoccupies himself with God and a search for a more moral cause.  Instead, she seeks her attention from older men who take advantage of her vulnerable state.  When Mona meets Tamsin (Emily Blunt), an intelligent and neglected upper-class daughter who has returned from boarding school to spend the summer with absent parents, her life seems to change.  Like the warm sunlight on a cold winter day, Mona embraces Tamsin's presence and wisdom, as she offers her a listening ear and friendship.  In return, Mona gives Tamsin what she lacks in her existence - friendship and affection, which turns into a warm loving friendship where each teen gives each other room for growth and understanding.Mona and Tamsin get closer as the summer progresses.  They even become lovers that find comfort and affectionate care within their physical embrace.  Within the presence of each other their trusts grows, as they share their secrets and fully expose themselves with complete disregard for their own safety.  However, in their emotional bliss, they forget about the nearing fall, and Tamsin's return to boarding school.  As the inevitable gradually approaches and the foreseeable pain of breaking up comes closer, their bond becomes stronger.Pawel Pawlikowski's cinematic adaptation of Helen Cross' novel tailors a clever and symbolic tale of coming of age and all of its angst.  In addition, Pawlikowski truthfully captures the self-deceit and emotional distress that immeasurable numbers of adolescents have suffered under the sign of amour.  Skillfully the director uses visual symbolism through remarkable photography and scene framing, which brings forth through the, at times, brilliant storytelling.  The opening with the moped without an engine analogously suggests Mona's own existence, which lack a drive and aim in life.  Tamsin's initial appearance is completely opposite of Mona, as she enters the scene on a horse, which hints toward her untamed and spirited persona, which is something that attracts Mona.  In the end, the story of the two girls presents touching tale of the pain and agony many nave teens experience on their journey into adulthood.My Summer of Love offers a worthwhile experience that brings the audience back to the nostalgia of adolescence through a captivating story of love, deceit, and other teenage predicaments.  Several aspects of the film motivate the viewer to contemplate Mona's situation, as she draws the portrait in the opening of the film.  However, the true cinematic gem does not appear until the end of the film, which ultimately offers an exhaustive perspective of coming of age and self-discovery, as youthful arrogance often prohibits outside guidance.",5,Touching Tale of Adolescent Angst while Coming of Age...,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,4519,"['maze', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'identity', 'often', 'overwhelms', 'teens', 'seek', 'personal', 'ways', 'finding', 'trial', 'error', 'attempts', 'are', 'sometimes', 'harmful', 'tormenting', 'quest', 'finding', 'troublesome', 'quest', 'come', 'age', 'intensifies', 'when', 'guidance', 'short', 'supply', 'occasion', 'could', 'make', 'situation', 'far', 'worse', 'necessary', 'However', 'difficult', 'time', 'many', 'youthful', 'minds', 'discover', 'stressful', 'painful', 'situations', 'Summer', 'Love', 'intriguing', 'piece', 'cinema', 'regards', 'phenomenon', 'where', 'adolescence', 'highly', 'stressful', 'time', 'self-discovery.The', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'story', 'protagonist', 'Mona', 'Nathalie', 'Press', 'portrait', 'someone', 'directly', 'wall', 'Decisively', 'pencil', 'uneven', 'surface', 'shoulders', 'neck', 'face', 'emerge', 'unyielding', 'determination', 'finish', 'drawing', 'red', 'marker', 'frame', 'portrait', 'obviously', 'have', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'Mona', 'When', 'done', 'down', 'floor', 'cigarette', 'finished', 'product', 'down', 'seemingly', 'place', 'opening', 'portrait', 'significant', 'meaning', 'mystery', 'audience', 'later', 'point', 'film.When', 'storyline', 'up', 'thread', 'straightforward', 'tale', 'how', 'two', 'polar', 'opposite', 'teen', 'girls', 'two', 'different', 'social', 'classes', 'unites', 'sensible', 'tale', 'affection', 'belonging', 'friendship', 'working', 'class', 'daughter', 'Mona', 'older', 'brother', 'ex-convict', 'Phil', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'apartment', 'pub', 'Mona', 'have', 'wandered', 'personal', 'void', 'kind', 'guidance', 'mother', 'past', 'away', 'Phil', 'preoccupies', 'God', 'search', 'more', 'moral', 'cause', 'Instead', 'attention', 'older', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'vulnerable', 'state', 'When', 'Mona', 'Tamsin', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'intelligent', 'neglected', 'upper-class', 'daughter', 'who', 'returned', 'boarding', 'school', 'spend', 'summer', 'absent', 'parents', 'life', 'change', 'warm', 'sunlight', 'cold', 'winter', 'day', 'Mona', 'Tamsin', 'presence', 'wisdom', 'listening', 'ear', 'friendship', 'return', 'Mona', 'Tamsin', 'what', 'existence', 'friendship', 'affection', 'warm', 'loving', 'friendship', 'where', 'teen', 'other', 'room', 'growth', 'understanding.Mona', 'Tamsin', 'get', 'closer', 'summer', 'even', 'become', 'lovers', 'find', 'comfort', 'affectionate', 'care', 'physical', 'embrace', 'presence', 'other', 'trusts', 'grows', 'share', 'secrets', 'fully', 'expose', 'complete', 'disregard', 'own', 'safety', 'However', 'emotional', 'bliss', 'forget', 'nearing', 'fall', 'Tamsin', 'return', 'boarding', 'school', 'inevitable', 'gradually', 'approaches', 'foreseeable', 'pain', 'breaking', 'up', 'closer', 'bond', 'stronger.Pawel', 'Pawlikowski', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Helen', 'Cross', 'novel', 'tailors', 'clever', 'symbolic', 'tale', 'coming', 'age', 'angst', 'addition', 'Pawlikowski', 'truthfully', 'self-deceit', 'emotional', 'distress', 'immeasurable', 'numbers', 'adolescents', 'have', 'suffered', 'sign', 'amour', 'Skillfully', 'director', 'visual', 'symbolism', 'remarkable', 'photography', 'scene', 'framing', 'forth', 'times', 'brilliant', 'storytelling', 'opening', 'moped', 'engine', 'analogously', 'Mona', 'own', 'existence', 'lack', 'drive', 'aim', 'life', 'Tamsin', 'initial', 'appearance', 'completely', 'opposite', 'Mona', 'scene', 'horse', 'untamed', 'spirited', 'persona', 'something', 'Mona', 'end', 'story', 'two', 'girls', 'presents', 'touching', 'tale', 'pain', 'agony', 'many', 'nave', 'teens', 'experience', 'journey', 'adulthood.My', 'Summer', 'Love', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'audience', 'back', 'nostalgia', 'adolescence', 'captivating', 'story', 'love', 'deceit', 'other', 'teenage', 'predicaments', 'Several', 'aspects', 'film', 'motivate', 'viewer', 'contemplate', 'Mona', 'situation', 'portrait', 'opening', 'film', 'However', 'true', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'not', 'appear', 'end', 'film', 'ultimately', 'exhaustive', 'perspective', 'coming', 'age', 'self-discovery', 'youthful', 'arrogance', 'often', 'outside', 'guidance']",N/A

The finale was a major let down for me, and as a result, it's only getting a 3 star review.I picked this up, as it was in a cheap deal, and it had been on my wishlist for a while. It was cheap, and it sounded pretty good, so what is there to go wrong?Set in a Yorkshire village, we observe two 16 year old girls, growing into their bodies and their sexuality and all that nonsense. Instantly, there are major differences between them - one is riding a horse, the other is riding a motorcycle without an engine. They always say opposites attract, and the two girls decide to hang out when they're bored.Tamsin is the slightly upperclass one, kicked out of boarding school, with an accent, perfect figure, perfect hair, perfect skin etc. Portrayed brilliantly by Emily Blunt (a rising star if there ever was one), she portrays Tamsin with the right amount of manipulativeness to make the viewers still like her.Mona is the quiet girl, who knows not a lot about fashion, lives with her ex-jailbird, now born again Christian, riding an engine-less motorcycle around town. She lives above a pub, but her brother has poured all the alcohol down the sink, and it's now a place of worship.Their friendship moves from hanging out together because they're bored, to an almost sisterly companionship, to a proper full on relationship. But all the time you get the impression Tamsin's just stringing Mona along, until something better appears. There's lots of shots of the girls hanging out together, and discovering each other - in more ways than one, for the males, there's some topless shots.Nathalie Press, who plays Mona, is the shining star in this movie. Although initially she reminded me of Sissy Spacek (her whole face structure is sharper though), she was amazing as the smitten kitten Mona. When her young heart was shattered into a million pieces, the audience feels along with her at the same time, and many a teenager will emphasise with her.I thought the whole Christian subplot was slightly unnecessary, especially the re-enactment of the crucifixion, and although it's only in short sharp bursts, it still draws the viewers' attention away from the relationship developing on screen.My Summer of Love is an excellent little film (and all I can say, is roll on summer), and although the ending was a major disappointment, I would watch it again, but perhaps skip the Christian bits. Not necessary.

Mona (Nathalie Press) a young Yorkshire local is a sprightly, but naive, small town girl who lives in a run down pub with her troubled brother Phil (Paddy Considine) a recent Born Again Christian.While on her summer break Mona coasts the towns outskirts on her ten quid, motor-less step-through. When Mona crosses paths with a young upper-class girl, Tamsin (Emily Blunt) on one of her 'rides'  they instantly form a fascination with each other.Tamsin is sexy and brash with a confidence that seems to bely her years. Full of culture and mystery she proceeds to spend most of her time with Mona opening up a world that previously had not existed for the young local girl.As they chat about Nietzsche, listen to Edith Piaf, take magic mushrooms and generally run a mock in the village, the girls form an intense bond that soon turns turns into a classic summer romance. However trouble is brewing as Mona's brother Phil learns of their relationship. Phil sees Mona's love for Tamsin as a illness that needs to be cured by the hand of god. In an interesting twist his attempts to warn Tamsin away from Mona sees his true nature exposed.My Summer of Love builds slowly and surely to it's climax through the relationship of Tamsin and Mona. And although it can be described as a coming of age film the story culminates in a clash of culture, family and deception that sees any sort of ""sweet summer love"" clich&eacute; blown out of the water. Press and Blunt at times seem a little out of depth with their characters, although this doesn't take away from what is an interesting skew on the usual young love tale.Considine is perfectly unbalanced as the ex-con who preaches the word of god with the same vengeance that he once drank and fought.

"" --NietzscheAs Tamsin, a prep-school Nietzche quoting outcast tries to impress the unsophisticated Mona, a horse whinnies off-screen. ""My Summer of Love"" is filled with small touches like this that reveal character and carry the story along in an indirect, almost enchanting manner.  Director Pawel Pawlikowski possesses an essential quality of a good filmmaker, the gift for showing more than telling.  I'm going to give some details away in this review, so you might want to stop reading if you haven't seen the film.I haven't read Helen Cross' novel, so going in I had no preconceptions.  Another reviewer here compared the film to ""Heavenly Creatures.""  Both stories do unfold in a similar manner, but in the end are dramatically different.  In ""Heavenly Creatures,"" the girls have parents but don't want them -- they prefer their fantasies; in ""My Summer of Love,"" the parents are absent (emotionally or physically), while the kids long for their attention.Keep an eye on the leads' attire during Phil's (Mona's brother) sermon on the mount and in the following bathtub scene.  During the majority of the film, Phil is wearing white, while Tamsin wears red.  The colors red and white play an important part in the film. In the sermon and bathtub scene, the colors shift, and Tamsin shows small signs that reveal she may have some sincere interest in Phil's newfound religiosity under her smirking cynicism.  Here I began seeing the filmmakers weren't taking sides, that maybe Tamsin's fantasy world inhabited by spirits might wind up appearing as unhealthy as Phil's fanaticism, that this film was going to be different than ""Heavenly Creatures.""  I wonder what Tamsin might have done if Mona hadn't popped out of the tub imitating Satan.""The French forgive crimes of passion.""Judging from the shot of Phil's giant Cross being dwarfed by a smokestack in the foreground, the filmmakers could be siding with Christ's seven woes.  In spite of what he preaches throughout the film, Phil looks externally, instead of internally for guidance from his almighty Father.  (Near the end of the film, he's definitely not calling out to God for help when he's hunched outside of Mona's room.)It would've been easy for me to join Mona and Tamsin's ridicule of Phil, and later write him off as a monster, but the filmmakers made it difficult for me to do this, especially when I saw his conflicted grimace as one of his congregation patted him on the back after he'd kicked his sister in the gut.Paddy Considine gives a respectfully nuanced performance to someone who could have easily been presented as hopelessly corrupt. He gives us someone who sincerely wants to be a better person, someone who grabs hold to the only thing around him that is promising to save him from his violent past.  Phil has just been released from prison; he's a man who used to have no problem ""puttin' a glass in someone's face.""  Their father abandoned them.  Their mother died of cancer. So, he turns the family pub into a church. He replaces the booze with religion. Meanwhile, Mona finds answers from a mother in Tamsin.  (She's lying in a field with sheep when she first meets Tamsin on a white horse.)  Instead of building a cross, Mona draws a picture of Tamsin on her wall. In their valley, the masculine and feminine are divided (in the end, Paddy's pub congregation is made up of all men); men and women have lost respect and awareness for each others' innate gifts (note how Mona is discarded by her boyfriend at the beginning of the film), and until those special qualities are brought into the light, appreciated, and integrated, these characters are destined for depression and chaos.All of the cast and crew seem to have communicated well with each other, as all elements in the film unite into a clear, fine tuned vsion.  It is beautifully photographed.  At times, the uneasy camerawork and close-ups on the girls' faces reminded me of Polanski's ""Repulsion"" (if it had been shot in color), which is interesting, because I often found myself being seduced by the depiction of Mona and Tamsin's relationship.  Small jolts and zooms are used to show shifts in the characters' thoughts.  I've seen this done on television a lot (mainly crime shows), but in this film, it seems to genuinely accentuate the characters' thoughts instead of forcing or inventing them. Sometimes the technique does call too much attention to itself, but aside from a few distracting moments, it added to the film's emotional charge, really drawing me into these characters' heads.Pawlikowski's past documentary work seems to have enhanced his ability to direct actors.  There are some scenes, particularly the ones focused on Tamsin, where more exposition is conveyed through a natural gesture or facial expression than could've been with ten pages of dialog.  As with the other players, Emily Blunt takes what could've been a callous rich-girl stereotype and brings a humanity and understanding to her character that makes it hard to hate her. I'm not going into too much detail about Tamsin, because I don't want to completely spoil the film.The sound and picture quality on the DVD are excellent.  The only real special feature is director commentary, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to listen to.  The other features are a few trailers, and an ad for the soundtrack CD, which looks pretty good -- Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory's score is both wondrous and strange, their beguiling, distracting 21st-century noir visions remind me a lot of the song ""Not Yet Remembered"" from Harold Budd and Brian Eno's album ""Plataeux of Mirrors.""If you want to see another well-made film dealing with similar subject matter but with a more upbeat ending, check out Swedish director Lukas Moodysson's ""Show Me Love.""  It's as deserving of your attention as ""My Summer of Love"" or ""Heavenly Creatures.""",4,The Apocalyptic Harlot,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,6203,"['Three', 'thinkers', 'equal', 'spider',

Set in Northern England in a remote working class village, two teenage girls meet and their lives become intertwined.Mona, the girl from the village, is angry that her brother has become a born-again Christian and turned their pub into a religious meeting place.  There is nothing fulfilling in her life except her ability to draw. She spends her days roaming the countryside on a motorless bike. She meets Tamsin on such an excursion and the two become instantly inseparable.  Tamsin, is not from the village per se, but lives in the feudal mansion nearby and is from a wealthy family.  She tells Mona that she is home because she has been suspended from school.The two spend all their time together often getting drunk, high or generally causing trouble.  Eventually their liaison becomes sexual, confusing lust with love. Mona is dazzled by the worldly Tamsin, who showers gifts and clothes on her.  Mona's horizon is the village and is very limited. Tamsin has a broad understanding of life in the real world, outside the village and uses this to entice, entrance and toy with her.How the relationship evolves and ultimately ends can be guessed from the first scenes.

Zwick,"[11, 11]","Based on the novel by Helen Cross, the British drama ""My Summer of Love"" tells the story of two troubled teens from opposite sides of the tracks who - as the title pretty much spells out for us - meet one summer and fall in love.  Her mother dead and her father long gone from the scene, Mona (Natalie Press) is a simple country girl who lives with her ex-convict, born-again Christian brother who, much to Mona's disgust, has decided to convert the family-owned pub into a meeting place for Pentecostal revivalists.  Tamsin (Emily Blunt), on the other hand, hails from a wealthy family, attends a posh boarding school, and studies Nietzsche in her spare time.  However, despite all these seeming advantages, Tamsin has also endured her share of tragedy.  Her beautiful older sister died of anorexia, her father is a serial adulterer and her mother is a second-rate actress who spends much of her time away from home touring with third-rate acting companies.  Lonely, bored and feeling abandoned by those closest to them, Mona and Tamsin turn to each other for companionship and support, finding hope and meaning in a relationship that neither of them can ever truly understand.Written and directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, ""My Summer of Love"" is a fascinating study not only of two complex and interesting characters but of the milieu in which they live.  The girls are clearly intended as sympathetic figures - and for the most part that's how they come across - but Pawlikowski is not afraid to show them in a less-than-flattering light when necessary.  Tamsin, for instance, has serious issues with honesty, and even though the girls have suffered quite a bit at the hands of unfeeling adults, that still may not justify some of the petty retaliations they take against those to whom they feel superior (Mona's religious zealot brother and his fundamentalist minions) or whom they believe have hurt them in some way (Mona`s married ex-boyfriend, Tamsin`s father`s current girlfriend).  This, however, only makes the characters more three-dimensional and believable and helps us to identify with them more strongly.  Pawlikowski matches this in the tone of the film, for despite the lyricism of many of the scenes, there is always a hint of darkness and danger lurking just beneath the surface.  We never quite know where the story is going because it refuses to follow any type of narrative formula.  The portrayal of the born-again Christians does border dangerously on the stereotypical, but their presence in the story provides an intriguing counterpoint to the lesbian love affair at the forefront of the film.  It also leads to a visually stunning sequence in which a group of worshippers carry a massive wooden cross to the top of a hill as a way of reclaiming the valley for Jesus.Press and Blunt are excellent as the two young women at the core of the story, and Paddy Considine (""In America"") is equally effective as the brother who loves Mona in his own way but whose new-found religious extremism ironically functions as a wall preventing him from showing that love.",4,lyrical offbeat romance,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,3078,"['Based', 'novel', 'Helen', 'Cross', 'British', 'drama', 'Summer', 'Love', 'story', 'two', 'troubled', 'teens', 'opposite', 'sides', 'tracks', 'who', 'title', 'pretty', 'much', 'spells', 'out', 'meet', 'one', 'summer', 'fall', 'love', 'mother', 'dead', 'father', 'long', 'gone', 'scene', 'Mona', 'Natalie', 'Press', 'simple', 'country', 'girl', 'who', 'ex-convict', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'brother', 'who', 'much', 'Mona', 'disgust', 'decided', 'convert', 'family-owned', 'pub', 'meeting', 'place', 'Pentecostal', 'revivalists', 'Tamsin', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'other', 'hand', 'hails', 'wealthy', 'family', 'posh', 'boarding', 'school', 'studies', 'Nietzsche', 'spare', 'time', 'However', 'seeming', 'advantages', 'Tamsin', 'also', 'endured', 'share', 'tragedy', 'beautiful', 'older', 'sister', 'died', 'anorexia', 'father', 'serial', 'adulterer', 'mother', 'second-rate', 'actress', 'who', 'much', 'time', 'away', 'home', 'touring', 'third-rate', 'acting', 'companies', 'Lonely', 'bored', 'feeling', 'abandoned', 'closest', 'Mona', 'Tamsin', 'turn', 'other', 'companionship', 'support', 'finding', 'hope', 'meaning', 'relationship', 'can', 'ever', 'truly', 'understand.Written', 'directed', 'Pawel', 'Pawlikowski', 'Summer', 'Love', 'fascinating', 'study', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'complex', 'interesting', 'characters', 'milieu', 'live', 'girls', 'are', 'clearly', 'intended', 'sympathetic', 'figures', 'most', 'part', 'how', 'come', 'Pawlikowski', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'less-than-flattering', 'light', 'when', 'necessary', 'Tamsin', 'instance', 'serious', 'issues', 'honesty', 'even', 'girls', 'have', 'suffered', 'quite', 'bit', 'hands', 'unfeeling', 'adults', 'still', 'may', 'not', 'justify', 'petty', 'retaliations', 'take', 'whom', 'feel', 'superior', 'Mona', 'religious', 'zealot', 'brother', 'fundamentalist', 'minions', 'whom', 'believe', 'have', 'hurt', 'way', 'Mona', 's', 'married', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Tamsin', 's', 'father', 's', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'however', 'only', 'characters', 'more', 'three-dimensional', 'believable', 'identify', 'more', 'strongly', 'Pawlikowski', 'tone', 'film', 'lyricism', 'many', 'scenes', 'always', 'hint', 'darkness', 'danger', 'lurking', 'just', 'surface', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'follow', 'type', 'narrative', 'formula', 'portrayal', 'born-again', 'Christians', 'border', 'dangerously', 'stereotypical', 'presence', 'story', 'intriguing', 'counterpoint', 'lesbian', 'love', 'affair', 'forefront', 'film', 'also', 'visually', 'stunning', 'sequence', 'group', 'worshippers', 'carry', 'massive', 'wooden', 'cross', 'top', 'hill', 'way', 'reclaiming', 'valley', 'Jesus.Press', 'Blunt', 'are', 'excellent', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'core', 'story', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'America', 'equally', 'effective', 'brother', 'who', 'Mona', 'own', 'way', 'new-found', 'religious', 'extremism', 'ironically', 'functions', 'wall', 'preventing', 'showing', 'love']",N/A

928542,A1ARHZTPIWG49I,B000AM6OVW,"Sara Watson ""Ms. Konstrue""","[88, 97]","Mona is crazy with boredom in her tiny village and overcome by the new distance between Phil, her born-again brother, and herself.  The mumblings of Phil's prayer meetings saturate the walls of The Swan, the old family pub where she and her brother live alone.  Mona pushes herself on an old motorless bike down the neighboring hills.  Lying by the side of the road, in the grass, seemingly injured, with her bike cast of to one side, she is found by a dark haired girl on a beautifully groomed horse.  From her saddle, the girl asks if Mona's injured.  ""Nah, just resting,"" Mona explains, barely raising her head.  The simplicity of the answer piques the girl's curiosity, and after introducing herself, Tamsin invites Mona to visit her at the manor where she lives.  After a breakup with a married boyfriend, and some very  depressing car sex, Mona decides to take Tamsin up on her offer.""I'm home for the summer. I was kicked out. They told my mother I'm a bad influence on people,"" says Tamsin, eyeing Mona, with the hint of a game in her eye.  Playing lady of the manor, she gives Mona a whirling and off-handed tour of her mansion, accompanied by  melodramatic schoolgirl explanations of Nietzche and other philosophers. In response to Mona's sad life story--no father, a mother killed by cancer, and her born-again brother--Tamsin offers up her sister, Sadie, who has recently died from annorexia.  The girls' reactions are marked.  Tamsin offers no solace for Mona's loss, a seeming shrug that indicates Mona's dreary life is to be expected of a villager, while upon hearing of Sadie, Mona's eyes widen and she gasps a genuine ""I'm sorry.""  Tamsin just measures the response, contemplating how she will play it.  The contrast between the girls is superb.  Tamsin's pale skin and hollow eyes, and languid motions, contrasted with Mona's messy auburn hair, strong features, freckled skin, and abrupt energy.  Tamsin often comments on music and worldviews she's sure her village friend has never encountered.  It's overtly patronizing.  Yet Mona is no simpleton, and flings her own equally potent and emotionally honest answers at Tamsin's sly questions.  When asked what she's intends to do with herself, she glibly answers something to the effect of: ""Work in an abattoir, marry a loser, get pregnant, and pump out a thousand children.""  Tamsin can only raise an eyebrow, while Mona grins at her grim possibilities.  The disparity between their classes is a draw and they both appear appreciate what they see as innate cruelty or strength in the other (Mona's hatred of her brother's Christianity, and Tamsin's cool world view).  It's a strange love story of sorts.  Or maybe a passion story, since love is a complicated subject within this movie.Mona is the focal point.  As the girls become closer she gives more of herself to the friendship.  Her tight fists relax, and she laughs more.  Meanwhile the already self-assured Tamsin sees  Mona's raw moments of beauty, with a caustic mix of jealousy and admiration in her eyes, coupled with a sense of accomplishment.  This is never better revealed then when the girls are alone at the manor and Tamsin flings her gorgeous castoff clothes for Mona to try on.  Mona dances clumsily, but uninhibited, in front of the mirror, awed by how pretty the dresses are, and suddenly aware of how pretty she might be.  Nathalie Press as Mona and Emily Blunt as Tamsin are wonderful young actors. Their eyes and motions speaking volumes.Pawel Pawlikowsky has an eye for the dull, and often, depressing beauty of Yorkshire--monochromatic hills of sun bleached wheat, occasionally marred by flowering heather, the dreary majesty of Tamsin's ivy cloaked manor, and the shade drenched woods that provide refuge for Mona.  It gives the film a sense of weight.  And his treatment of the love between the girls is realistic: curiosity, possession, lust, and cruelty.  The dialogue is simple and candid.  And the ending has a beautiful brutality.

Phil, just released from prison, returns home having `found God' and transforms the family pub into a revival hall. He starts to have meetings, trying to transform the lives of people in the small Yorkshire town. Mona meets Tamsin (Emily Blunt), the daughter of a wealthy family. They form a friendship, teaching each other about their lives, sharing secrets, exploring together.""My Summer of Love"" is a very good film. Many things about it are fairly ambiguous, peaking your attention. For instance, it isn't immediately clear when the film is taking place. Everything in the little town in Yorkshire, England is slightly old-fashioned. Very few cars are seen. The two girls dress in slightly hippy-ish clothes. No cell-phones, plasma televisions or computers are in evidence. But I don't think it is actually set in the late 60s. I don't think the film is trying to be a period piece. But because it is ambiguous about this, the film gives itself a certain amount of dramatic license, allowing us to believe in the relationship between the two girls.As the two girls grow closer, they begin to affect each other's lives in ways that are very natural. Each is clearly bored. Tamsin mentions early on that she was expelled from boarding school. She is ""a bad influence"". Because she is bored, is a bad influence, and has more resources than Mona, she begins to change the life of her friend. First they are friends, sharing laughs and time, and adventures. But as their relationship unfolds, they become closer and share love, declaring that they will never separate.Mona is a less complex character on the surface. She follows Tamsin's lead, presumably to the ends of the Earth. A captive audience for Tamsin, the stronger personality, Mona follows because she wants to escape her brother's newfound religion. As her character develops, we sense that she is perhaps stronger than she let on, maybe even steering the relationship to meet her needs.The two girls become lovers, but the film is not about them being Lesbians. It is about the bond they build and share, and how that bond is threatened. Both girls are probably seventeen and they share experiences like any normal teenage girl or boy would share them. With intensity. As if they were the last experiences they were ever to have. With all of their heart.There is a lot of emotional power in the film. Mona doesn't really believe that her brother has ""found God"". It is merely another scheme he has come up with. This makes him all the more unbearable to her. Later, when he comes to Tamsin's house to find her, Tamsin tries to seduce him.
