Wow, what a performance!  She apparently even plays without some teeth.  I've seen her in &#34;Dances With Wolves&#34; and &#34;Black Robe&#34;, and I wish I could find more of her.  She deserves an Oscar.The only weakness of the film is a miscast (and unimpressive) Michael J. Fox.

761448,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,B0000A2ZR5,Bomojaz,"[13, 14]","Rip Torn plays a gritty old logger who just wants to keep his forest and trout streams in tact but is suddenly pitted against Michael J. Fox and a corporation that wants to build a big dam that will take them all away. The movie is commendable for not making the dam-builders horrible monsters and Torn the epitome of moral righteousness: the former want to bring modern services to remote areas and the latter is not an example of political correctness. Tantoo Cardinal plays Torn's wife, and she is perhaps the biggest asset in the movie; she is a spunky and sensitive actress. The storyline is a strong one (it's set during the 1920s), and the photography is stunning. Made on a tight budget, the production makes up for cut corners with sincerity of purpose. Pretty good movie, all around.",4,Fair and believable,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,793,"['Rip', 'Torn', 'gritty', 'old', 'logger', 'who', 'just', 'keep', 'forest', 'trout', 'streams', 'tact', 'suddenly', 'pitted', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'corporation', 'build', 'big', 'dam', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'commendable', 'not', 'making', 'dam-builders', 'horrible', 'monsters', 'Torn', 'epitome', 'moral', 'righteousness', 'former', 'want', 'bring', 'modern', 'services', 'remote', 'areas', 'latter', 'not', 'example', 'political', 'correctness', 'Tantoo', 'Cardinal', 'Torn', 'wife', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'asset', 'movie', 'spunky', 'sensitive', 'actress', 'storyline', 'strong', 'one', 'set', '1920s', 'photography', 'stunning', 'Made', 'tight', 'budget', 'production', 'up', 'cut', 'corners', 'sincerity', 'purpose', 'Pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'around']",Where the Rivers Flow North
