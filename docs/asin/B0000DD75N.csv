778238,A3AFLQVLVBS688,B0000DD75N,"""aaspence4""","[6, 6]","The Trip is about a closeted-republican, played by Larry Sullivan, who finds his true love in a democratic activist.  The movie starts off chronicling their love and lives together, and it's sweet, endearing, and oftentimes funny.  It's when their lives are absolutely perfect together that some catastrophic happens and drives them apart after years of being together.  They are re-united many years later for a life changing trip.This movie is very sweet and very good.  You can't help but smile and feel happy when their relationship is at its best.  It's only toward the end, when the movie becomes serious, that it trips up.  The seriousness does work but becomes underminded with the final scene when a young teenager comments, &quot;it's the greatest love story.&quot;  It's not the greatest love story, but it's a good one. The chemistry between the leads is fantastic, and Larry Sullivan is very cute and funny in the role.  It seemed to have been made specifically for him.  The Trip is definitely a movie to see.",4,"Sweet, Endearing, and Funny",1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,1023,"['Trip', 'closeted-republican', 'played', 'Larry', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'true', 'love', 'democratic', 'activist', 'movie', 'chronicling', 'love', 'together', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'oftentimes', 'funny', 'when', 'lives', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'together', 'catastrophic', 'happens', 'apart', 'years', 'being', 'together', 'are', 're-united', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'life', 'changing', 'trip.This', 'movie', 'very', 'sweet', 'very', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'feel', 'happy', 'when', 'relationship', 'best', 'only', 'end', 'when', 'movie', 'serious', 'up', 'seriousness', 'work', 'underminded', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'young', 'teenager', 'comments', 'quot', 'greatest', 'love', 'story.', 'quot', 'not', 'greatest', 'love', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'fantastic', 'Larry', 'Sullivan', 'very', 'cute', 'funny', 'role', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'specifically', 'Trip', 'definitely', 'movie', 'see']",N/A

778240,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0000DD75N,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[6, 9]","19 year old Tommy  meets 24 year old writer Alan at a party in 1973.  There is a definite ""spark"" of interest between the two, and Tommy gives Alan his number so he can ""interview"" him for an upcoming book.  When Alan calls and invites him for dinner, Tommy is surprised to meet Alan's lover Beverly, a ditzy hippie, and to find out that Alan is a  Republican and staunch Nixon supporter.  Tommy wisecracks his way through what would otherwise be a really tedious evening. (Tommy: ""So what do you two have planned on the menu, a menage-a-trois?"" Beverly: ""No, Alan hates French food."") In time, Beverly breaks up with Alan. and the spark between him and Tommy eventually ignites (after some funny false starts) and they become a couple.Fast forward to four years later, as Anita Bryant launches her anti-gay campaign, and the couple is still going strong, until a rich older man, Peter, who was attracted to Alan, tries to drive a wedge between them by resurrecting an anti-gay book which Alan had written in his closeted Republican days.  Alan is afraid to tell Tommy about it, but it eventually is revealed, and results in Tommy moving out.The film moves ahead again to 1985, when Alan has turned into a prominent gay activist in the Los Angeles area, and living with Peter, who was conveniently nearby to console him after the breakup (Alan remains in the dark about how Peter orchestrated it).  Beverly (Alan's ex) reappears to convince Alan to going back to Tommy, who is living in Mexico, but Alan fights his urge to do so. When they finally do reunite, 12 years after they first got together, they have a rather eventful ""road trip"" driving back to the US.This independent film is a low budget masterpiece.  The cinematography, writing/direction (Miles Swain, who says he based it on an ""urban legend""), makeup (the characters actually seem to age over the 12 years), music (lots of period music from the 70's and '80s will have you singing along, with news photos of gay demonstrations added), and the acting is all first rate.  Special kudos to Jill St John as Alan's mother, who steals the show (and other things), Sirena Irwin as Beverly, and the two leads, Larry Sullivan (Alan) and Steve Braun (Tommy). Alexis Arguette plays the stereotypical queeny...friend, and Julie Brown (""Earth Girls Are Easy"") as a [sleazy] lesbian receptionist.  David Mixner, a gay activist, appears as himself.Only negative I can bring up is some contrived dialogue toward the end.  The film covers serious subject matter in a realistic and emotional way, but never loses the good humor that is part of life, including under adversity.  The film is a ""keeper"" for my personal library, and I believe you'll agree.  Nominated for several awards at GLBT film festivals nationwide.

Certain to make you laugh ""out loud"" and cry tears of joy and tears of pain.  The movie follows the lives of 2 opposites, Alan and Tommy from their meeting in the early 70's through the 1980's.  Inside the story line are interwoven glimpes of our very short gay and lesbian human rights history - many through actual images, voice and video impacting our world during the period including the Nixon years, Carter, Anita Bryant, Reagan and eventually AIDS.  A love story and history lesson unfold quickly in this well acted and directed film.  A MUST for your collection.  As someone now in their 30's, this is a trip down memory lane, as I recall the times reflected upon.  For those younger, a lesson on the battles already fought and won, and those we need to keep fighting.  For those older, probably an even more impacting film.

The main characters are funny and endearing in many ways, but just a little flat.

Boy finds he likes boy, boy doesn't want to like boy, boy resists liking boy, boy meets boy, boy loves boy.  The first character, Alan, is a YR and a journalist who wants to expose the evils of that evil he has inside of him, and invites a young activist Tommy to do an interview.  The rest, as they say, is history.  There are lots of campy one-liners as indeed there has to be in any gay film like this.

I haven't watched this movie in years and just pulled it out today. I'm a bit surprised as to my original review as to why I was a bit harsh with this movie. I've always had an affection for this flick! I'm leaving the original review up modifying it significantly here. ""Older and wiser"" and a lot more movies under my belt! Yes, I still think the wigs are terrible! Anyone watching Sonny (Freddie Smith) and Will (Chandler Massey) on ""Days of our Lives"" will see the correlation in their story in Alan and Tommy. Yes, the ending still gives me an emotional reaction that I don't have with most movies. Alan's emotional scene in the car when Tommy passes away crying that he couldn't lose him as he just got him back."" Wow! One doesn't see scenes like this very often. Anyone who has their hearts on their sleeves and a romantic at heart... this movie will touch you greatly! My original review follows:First, my favorite scene in this movie doesn't involve any of the fictional storyline, but watching the footage of Anita Bryant taking a much deserved pie in the face. The idea behind this movie has a lot of promise and the cast of actors to pull it off. The main actors, Larry Sullivan (Alan) and Steve Braun (Tommy), have a nice chemistry together. However, they and the rest of the cast are constantly hampered by a contrite and uneven script and the worst wigs that play a constant distraction while watching the movie. There are some funny and serious moments in this film that shine, but, unfortunately, not enough. The ""main"" part of the movie- the trip- doesn't come until the end and that storyline is too abbreviated and does get to be a bit unbelievable in a short sub-plot with a Mexican police officer. I was left with an uneasy feeling and question at the end. What happened to Tommy's body? Did Alan bury it in Mexico? Did he throw it over the cliff- as Alan appears to be gazing down at ""something"" while standing at the edge? Or did Alan make the effort to bring Tommy ""home""?This script and flick could have been more potent if the movie had extended Alan and Tommy's drive through Mexico and the movie played prior events in their lives together in flashbacks. The strength of this movie is Tommy and Alan's relationship and when they break up, the plot seems to wander a bit. As affecting- and unexpected- as Alan and Tommy's last scene together was, the movie would have had more of an emotional impact had they made it back to the United States before their ultimate departure from each other.The actual historical footage of the gay rights movement through the '70's and '80's is as interesting to watch as the movie itself. A longer shoot time and bigger budget would have improved the overall power of this film. Kudos to the cast though! Larry Sullivan, Steve Braun, Alexis Arquette (""I Think I Do""), Julie Brown, and Jill St. John do make the best of what is given to them. For their talent and effort, I do give this film a recommendation to see as. ""The Trip"" does a wonderful job of conveying some ""life lessons"" about love; commitment; family; being true to yourself; and consequences for actions, both good and bad. I just had higher hopes with this cast and this premise for the movie.

I do, however, want to say that I do not think that it is deserving of all the praise it has recieved.  The character development was rather poor, and the plot was threadbare, but it did provide some enjoyment.  It was light, and full of laughter, and obviously did not take itself too serriously.  I would recomend renting or watching this movie on pay-per-view before purchasing it.  The major complaint I have with this movie is that it did not build the relationshi between the characters, and it is impossible to understand some of the actions done by the characters without some type of development.  I think there was potential there, but not a lot of follow through.  More like a last minute effort at throwing things together.

778250,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B0000DD75N,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[5, 6]","After re-watching the film a second time -with the commentary on - I was struck on how the movie resembled too much like late 1970's and early 80's TV shows. Director Miles Swain talks about the film stock they used -which was near the same they used during the era. He talked on the limitations of working on an indie film (how one location home was redressed many times to represent other locales) -something that seems to run through the fabric of these films in general. He also mentioned how -probably very unintentionally- how veteran character actor's Ray Parker and James Handy roles became almost ""Dynasty"" villains. Looking back, then, The Trip becomes nothing more than any other gay themed film of the last few years. Which doesn't mean the movie is not bad, just an amicable attempt at rising above the narcissism that perpetuates most films of this genre.  So I don't hate it, and sometimes you can't, because the movie's leads work so well together. Both Larry Sullivan's Alan and Steve Braun's Tommy bring a fresh of the breath air to their roles, and since their chemistry works, you almost want to follow them through to the end. However, the meandering plot sometimes does get in the way, and from the time that Alan and Tommy split you can figure out where the film will find its ending. Which is to say, not a strike against it, but the emotional contribution is suddenly gone. So, toward the end, you feel you're being manipulated -will they make it across the border or not? Raise you hand if you can't figure it out?Still, I enjoyed the backdrop of the film, exploring the gay movement between 1973 and 1984, from Anita Bryant to the Reagan era (I kind of ignored a lot of that stuff, as I was a gay teen at the time, and was hiding deep in the closet). The archival footage helped enhance the story, giving it a little more depth. And the always and very underrated Julie Brown shines in an oh to brief cameo, and Alexis Arquette -the gay indie version of Parker Posey -does a good job of playing Jack McFarland from Will & Grace (or is that the other way around?). Sernia Irwin is wonderful as Beverly, who really goes through more of a transformation anyone, but it's Jill St. John who camps it up, and delivers a funny -if stereotypical -portrayal as Alan's mom Mary. She steals every scene she's in, but if every mother were like her when they figure out their sons are gay and doesn't bat an eyelash at it, we would all be better off.But the centerpiece to this film is Sullivan -channeling Scott Bakula during his Quantum Leap years (during the gas station sequence in Mexico, the dialogue exchange between Alan and Tommy reminded me of Sam arguing with Al) - and Braun. They work wonderful together and seem very comfortable as gay lovers (on the commentary, Sullivan does seem to go out of his way to assert his heterosexuality, while Braun remains ambiguous -though I'm left with the impression he is straight. Damn). And while that is not enough to hang your film on, it does help cover up some of the flaws of the script and Parker's ""Dynasty"" style villain. And because these two actors work so well together, it's still worth a risk.Miles Swain's attempt is admiral, as he is obviously attempting to say something about the lives of gay men during the mid to late 70's and the beginning of the Plague Years. It's only halfway successful, but a good try.Meanwhile, I did enjoy the documentary, as I kind of like the silly sense of humor it takes on, and the 10 deleted scenes are worth a look (with the commentary on, of course). There is the films obligatory trailer, of course, and a handful of other trailers for other TLA film releases which will have me at the video store a couple more times (hello, can't wait for Latter Days).",4,Cover Me,1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,3771,"['re-watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'commentary', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'movie', 'resembled', 'too', 'much', 'late', '1970', 'early', '80', 'TV', 'shows', 'Director', 'Miles', 'Swain', 'talks', 'film', 'stock', 'used', '-which', 'was', 'same', 'used', 'era', 'talked', 'limitations', 'working', 'indie', 'film', 'how', 'one', 'location', 'home', 'was', 'redressed', 'many', 'times', 'represent', 'other', 'locales', '-something', 'run', 'fabric', 'films', 'general', 'also', 'mentioned', 'how', '-probably', 'very', 'unintentionally-', 'how', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Ray', 'Parker', 'James', 'Handy', 'became', 'almost', 'Dynasty', 'villains', 'Looking', 'back', 'then', 'Trip', 'nothing', 'more', 'other', 'gay', 'themed', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Which', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'amicable', 'attempt', 'rising', 'narcissism', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movie', 'leads', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'Larry', 'Sullivan', 'Alan', 'Steve', 'Braun', 'Tommy', 'bring', 'fresh', 'breath', 'air', 'roles', 'chemistry', 'almost', 'want', 'follow', 'end', 'However', 'meandering', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'get', 'way', 'time', 'Alan', 'Tommy', 'split', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'ending', 'Which', 'say', 'not', 'strike', 'emotional', 'contribution', 'suddenly', 'gone', 'So', 'end', 'feel', ""'re"", 'being', 'manipulated', 'make', 'border', 'not', 'Raise', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'backdrop', 'film', 'exploring', 'gay', 'movement', '1973', '1984', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'Reagan', 'era', 'kind', 'ignored', 'lot', 'stuff', 'was', 'gay', 'teen', 'time', 'was', 'hiding', 'deep', 'closet', 'archival', 'footage', 'helped', 'enhance', 'story', 'giving', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'always', 'very', 'underrated', 'Julie', 'Brown', 'shines', 'oh', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', '-the', 'gay', 'indie', 'version', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Jack', 'McFarland', 'Will', 'Grace', 'other', 'way', 'Sernia', 'Irwin', 'wonderful', 'Beverly', 'who', 'really', 'more', 'transformation', 'anyone', 'Jill', 'St.', 'John', 'who', 'camps', 'up', 'funny', '-if', 'stereotypical', '-portrayal', 'Alan', 'mom', 'Mary', 'scene', 'mother', 'were', 'when', 'figure', 'out', 'sons', 'are', 'gay', ""n't"", 'bat', 'eyelash', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'better', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'Sullivan', '-channeling', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'years', 'gas', 'station', 'sequence', 'Mexico', 'dialogue', 'exchange', 'Alan', 'Tommy', 'reminded', 'Sam', 'arguing', 'Al', 'Braun', 'work', 'wonderful', 'together', 'seem', 'very', 'comfortable', 'gay', 'lovers', 'commentary', 'Sullivan', 'seem', 'go', 'way', 'assert', 'heterosexuality', 'Braun', 'ambiguous', ""'m"", 'left', 'impression', 'straight', 'Damn', 'not', 'enough', 'hang', 'film', 'help', 'cover', 'up', 'flaws', 'script', 'Parker', 'Dynasty', 'style', 'villain', 'two', 'actors', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'still', 'worth', 'risk.Miles', 'Swain', 'attempt', 'admiral', 'obviously', 'attempting', 'say', 'something', 'lives', 'gay', 'men', 'mid', 'late', '70', 'beginning', 'Plague', 'Years', 'only', 'halfway', 'successful', 'good', 'try.Meanwhile', 'did', 'enjoy', 'documentary', 'kind', 'silly', 'sense', 'humor', '10', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'look', 'commentary', 'course', 'films', 'obligatory', 'trailer', 'course', 'handful', 'other', 'trailers', 'other', 'TLA', 'film', 'releases', 'will', 'have', 'video', 'store', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'hello', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Latter', 'Days']",N/A

So many of these independent little films that deal with important historical remembrances and social issues lack the funds for a wide theatrical release and PR. Unfortunate though that may be, releasing the DVD/VHS format for home consumption is bound to drive the messages so well presented here into the forefront of our thinking - especially with the increasing specter of AIDS burgeoning around the globe.THE TRIP is an examination of the 1970s and 1980s and while it is a fine love story between two men at opposite ends of the political spectrum, it does not come across as a 'gay-only' film. Credit Miles Swain for bringing out not only a re-creation of the drugged out, hallucinatory 70s and the development of the effects 'post-Stonewall' on gay activism, but also including important film clip reminders of the Nixon/Johnson/Reagan era with its Anita Bryants/Harvey Milks/AIDS devastation. In this setting Swain introduces an intelligent gay man named Tommy (Steve Braun) who encounters a closeted confused 'Republican misfit' Alan (Larry Sullivan) and collide with great humor in the presence of the very funny Beverly (Sirena Irwin). Alan slowly opens the closet door and he and Tommy become lovers in a solid dignified relationship. Alan is a young novelist and during his closeted years wrote a book on homosexuality in a less than friendly light. Once with Tommy, Alan manages to prevent the book's being published only to have the dragon raise its ugly head four years later. Tommy leaves, Alan opines, and then with the ever present entries of Beverly and Alan's ex-chorus girl wise mother (in a memorable performance by the beautiful Jill St. John) Alan discovers Tommy is in Mexico dying of AIDS. In a last attempt to regain his real love and mend past hurts, Alan goes to Mexico where Tommy has secluded himself. The title THE TRIP references an unfulfilled early promise of Alan and Tommy taking a Road Trip and it is this trip by car from Mexico back to the USA that ends the story.In keeping with the authenticity of the time frames, the stars are hampered in the first half of the film with outrageous long hair wigs and clothes that make them seem caricatures at first. But as with all of the cast (including Alexis Arquette in a fine cameo) the acting is strong enough to carry us with their transformation to the fine looking people they are. This film has many hilarious moments that serve to relieve the tension from the sad moments and in the end, despite all of the reminders of the mistakes of history, we are left with a beautifully tender love story - one the brings back (for this viewer) some of the best parts of the classic film MIDNIGHT COWBOY.

It's about a young man in college named Alan, who is a straight republican writing a book about homosexuality. Tommy is an openly gay man who is trying to change people's perception about homosexuality and move its rights into the mainstream. They ultimately fall for each other, and Alan decides not to publish his book when he realizes that he is gay too. That was in 1973 when they met, and 4 years later, the book gets published against his wishes, and it pushes Tommy and Alan apart. Tommy finds out that Alan is the one who wrote the book. In 1984, Alan gets a message from Tommy, that he is sick and wants to see him to bring him to his doctor in Texas. Alan is living with another man, who he learns was the one who revealed that Alan was the one who wrote the book, which in turn caused a breakup between Tommy and Alan.

It had dialogue that didn't make you wince, actors who could actually act (and very well at that), and direction that almost bordered on professional. Most importantly though, the film was actually romantic in it's own sort of way. However, this isn't a romantic comedy; rather, it's a travelogue of sorts concerning two young men and how the politics of the early 70's through mid 80's affected their relationship. It has plenty of serious moments along with a surprising amount of humorous moments, and it's the uneven balance of these two that is really the only flaw in the film (well, that and a rushed ending).

778261,A3RO6CB4EU8DRA,B0000DD75N,James Head,"[9, 9]","Miles Swain's THE TRIP (2002) is yet another small gem that is worth seeing, but most people know so little about because of its low budget and even lower publicity.Alan (Larry Sullivan) and Tommy (Steve Braun) meet and fall in love in the early 1970s, but they couldn't be much different.  The story focuses around the problems of that era via Alan's position as a writer who initially claims to dislike homosexuals.  Tommy is just the opposite, a gay-rights activist with a strong spirit and a soft heart.  As the two become closer and closer, the story revolves around their trials and tribulations in an era that was perhaps less accepting than today.The young cast here makes a generally strong performance, with particularly notable funny-girls played by Jill St. John and Sirena Irwin.  Their interactions are generally believable, but the story tends to meander here and there, losing its focus and power from time to time.And while the story is somewhat predictable, the ending is even more so.  Don't get me wrong -- this film is worth a look -- but don't be surprised if you're left with a little nagging sense that things could have been done just a little differently.  All-in-all, this is a touching and different film that will create a fondness in you for the characters and their (mis)adventures in life.

778262,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B0000DD75N,James Morris,"[8, 11]","I wish I could get as worked up over this film as everyone else seems to be. I wanted to like it, I really did. From the moment I heard all the great word of mouth, I was expecting a superior experience. I collect films with gay content, and at this writing I have nearly 400 gay-themed films, mostly on DVD.  I get quite excited when word of mouth causes me to anticipate a really good gay cinematic experience.  I was grossly let down by The Trip.  This review will contain some ""spoilers"", so if you don't want to know any plot details, stop reading now.Maybe I expected too much, but as it stands, I had several problems with this picture. First of all, I really liked the premise, but I wanted a bit more - the film should have been at least 30 minutes longer. I found the script terribly uneven, and even though the humor sustained my interest, the situations often didn't come through as terribly real. I resented the fact that, after Tommy dumps him, Alan spends more time with Peter (the ""bad guy"") than the two main characters were together to begin with - certainly plausible, but not very satisfying. It also seemed a but unrealistic for two people that age to have a four year affair, break up, and still be pining for each other seven years later - after all, they were two young hunks in their prime. My experience at that age taught me that they both probably would have gone through several different affairs during that period, and possibly even forgotten each other completely. The film offers no idea of what their life was like during the years they were apart, except for a glimpse of the domestic life of Alan and Peter. And unless I missed something, the airport scene was the first indication that Tommy was ill, and that scene (and the scenes in the desert) just didn't ring true.If Tommy had lived in Mexico for seven years as stated, he shouldn't have been nave enough to allow Alan to drive him across the desert with $20 between them. And why should they, when the airline tickets they were refused boarding passes for should have gotten them a cash refund of several hundred dollars? That particular plot hole annoyed the hell out of me.Their ""adventures"" in the desert, especially the gas station episode and the police car scene, were totally unbelievable. I also felt that Alan's mother, as played by Jill St. John, was way too over-the-top - the alcoholic / kleptomaniac routine was so undignified that she came off to me as clownish rather than funny. And there is no explanation of how Alan's mother gets so chummy with his ex-girlfriend (who he went out with for such a short time).And finally, it may be bit picky, but as a young gay activist myself in NYC during the same period, I can tell you that I for one would not have been caught dead in 1973 with hair as long as Tommy's. 1968? Sure - but by 1973, almost everyone I know had shed their extra long locks for something more resembling what the guys had in the 1977 segments, and by 1977 all my friends were wearing their hair quite short. A number of people have touted this film as the greatest gay romantic film yet, but I liked Trick, Maurice and especially Big Eden far better. One last thing - the producers of this film clearly expected a hit among gay audiences - it seems to me that if they'd spent just a little more on the budget, and thought the script out just a little more carefully, it would have worked much better. Despite my many misgivings, I did enjoy it for what it was worth, and I will still recommend it, but I think it could have been twice the picture that it is.",3,Disappointed Me Greatly,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,3585,"['wish', 'could', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'film', 'everyone', 'else', 'be', 'wanted', 'like', 'really', 'did', 'moment', 'heard', 'great', 'word', 'mouth', 'was', 'expecting', 'superior', 'experience', 'collect', 'films', 'gay', 'content', 'writing', 'have', 'nearly', '400', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'mostly', 'DVD', 'get', 'quite', 'excited', 'when', 'word', 'mouth', 'causes', 'anticipate', 'really', 'good', 'gay', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'was', 'grossly', 'let', 'down', 'Trip', 'review', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'plot', 'details', 'stop', 'reading', 'now.Maybe', 'expected', 'too', 'much', 'had', 'several', 'problems', 'picture', 'First', 'really', 'liked', 'premise', 'wanted', 'bit', 'more', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'longer', 'found', 'script', 'terribly', 'uneven', 'even', 'humor', 'sustained', 'interest', 'situations', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'terribly', 'real', 'resented', 'fact', 'Tommy', 'dumps', 'Alan', 'more', 'time', 'Peter', 'bad', 'guy', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'together', 'begin', 'certainly', 'plausible', 'not', 'very', 'satisfying', 'also', 'seemed', 'unrealistic', 'two', 'people', 'age', 'have', 'four', 'year', 'affair', 'break', 'up', 'still', 'be', 'pining', 'other', 'seven', 'years', 'later', 'were', 'two', 'young', 'hunks', 'prime', 'experience', 'age', 'taught', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'several', 'different', 'affairs', 'period', 'possibly', 'even', 'forgotten', 'other', 'completely', 'film', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'years', 'were', 'apart', 'glimpse', 'domestic', 'life', 'Alan', 'Peter', 'missed', 'something', 'airport', 'scene', 'was', 'first', 'indication', 'Tommy', 'was', 'ill', 'scene', 'scenes', 'desert', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true.If', 'Tommy', 'had', 'lived', 'Mexico', 'seven', 'years', 'stated', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'nave', 'enough', 'allow', 'Alan', 'drive', 'desert', '20', 'why', 'should', 'when', 'airline', 'tickets', 'were', 'refused', 'boarding', 'passes', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'cash', 'refund', 'several', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'particular', 'plot', 'hole', 'annoyed', 'hell', 'me.Their', 'adventures', 'desert', 'especially', 'gas', 'station', 'episode', 'police', 'car', 'scene', 'were', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'also', 'felt', 'Alan', 'mother', 'played', 'Jill', 'St.', 'John', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'alcoholic', '/', 'kleptomaniac', 'routine', 'was', 'so', 'undignified', 'came', 'off', 'clownish', 'rather', 'funny', 'explanation', 'how', 'Alan', 'mother', 'so', 'chummy', 'ex-girlfriend', 'who', 'went', 'out', 'such', 'short', 'time', '.And', 'finally', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'picky', 'young', 'gay', 'activist', 'NYC', 'same', 'period', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'dead', '1973', 'hair', 'as', 'long', 'Tommy', '1968', 'Sure', '1973', 'almost', 'everyone', 'know', 'had', 'shed', 'extra', 'long', 'locks', 'something', 'more', 'resembling', 'what', 'guys', 'had', '1977', 'segments', '1977', 'friends', 'were', 'wearing', 'hair', 'quite', 'short', 'number', 'people', 'have', 'touted', 'film', 'greatest', 'gay', 'romantic', 'film', 'yet', 'liked', 'Trick', 'Maurice', 'especially', 'Big', 'Eden', 'far', 'better', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'producers', 'film', 'clearly', 'expected', 'hit', 'gay', 'audiences', ""'d"", 'spent', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'budget', 'thought', 'script', 'out', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'carefully', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'many', 'misgivings', 'did', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'will', 'still', 'recommend', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'twice', 'picture']",N/A

It's also a biopic of gay life, as it shows real footage from Anita Bryant having a pie thrown in her face (I watched that a few times over and over), protests over Harvey Milk's murder, and AIDS marches to name a few. All of the footage is well picked and relevant.The love story is a touching one. Personally, I found Larry Sullivan (who played the character of Alan) a bit awkward when trying to display embarrassment or discomfort. But as the movie progressed, and the character grew, I found him more than capable. Steve Braun (Tommy) was terrific from beginning to end, and the only question regarding him that I have is: what was he doing living in Mexico? I must have missed something.Alan and Tommy's lives together morphed from: disagreeable opponents to lovers to separated but in love to ... well, that I can't say much about.There are a few surprises in the movie, nothing earth shattering, and the understated climax was appreciated.

While it falls somewhat short of that lofty goal, it is still an enjoyable tale. Alan, a young closeted conservative republican, meets gay activist Tommy at a party in 1973. Against all odds, the two fall in love and begin their life together. Four years later, Peter, a jealous older man, manipulates their lives in order to break them up. Alan turns to Peter for comfort and spends the next seven years in a closeted, controlling relationship with him. In 1984, Tommy sends word to Alan that he is sick and would like to see him again. With encouragement from his friends and family, Alan leaves Peter to reunite with Tommy in Mexico, where the two former lovers set out on an eventful road trip.Set against a backdrop of dramatic historical events, the movie could have been powerful and moving. Instead, it glosses over much of that rich history with flashes of vintage newsreel, and the story suffers from too many shifts and mood-swings. Writer/Director Miles Swain tries to blend humor and drama, but the results are uneven at best. The lead actors, Larry Sullivan as Alan and Steve Braun as Tommy, are quite good and they even have some evidence of chemistry. Jill St. John shines as Alan's accepting mother.

778273,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B0000DD75N,Libretio,"[8, 8]","THE TRIP(USA - 2002)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: StereoThe relationship of a free-spirited gay activist (Steve Braun) and a conservative closet-case (Larry Sullivan) is tested to breaking point during the political turbulence of the 1970's and reaches a bittersweet conclusion during the Reaganite 80's, when AIDS begins to decimate the gay community.Writer-director Miles Swain makes his feature debut with this warm-hearted comedy-drama, which ploughs a far-reaching furrow through two decades of gay liberation. As the opposites who attract each other against their better judgment, Braun (EVERYBODY'S DOING IT) and Sullivan (FORBIDDEN CITY) are perfectly matched, and both young men are profoundly altered by their burgeoning love for one another, while an eccentric supporting cast spins a magical web around them (including former Bond girl Jill St. John [DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER] as Sullivan's daffy, kleptomaniac mother, veteran character actor Ray Baker [WHAT LIES BENEATH] as the scheming politician who covets Sullivan for his own bed, Sirena Irwin [TV's ""Stripperella""] as a bubble-headed blonde who is forced to step aside as the two main men in her life begin to fall in love with each other, and the ubiquitous Alexis Arquette [I THINK I DO] as an activist more interested in bedding guys than changing the world).The fads and fashions of ages past are exploited to the hilt by costume designers Kristen Anacker and Cherie Sevilla Granger and art directors David Touster and Donna Willinsky, while the changing political landscape is charted through a series of contemporary news clips (set your player to 'repeat' for the glorious moment when Anita Bryant is ambushed during a live TV broadcast!). Best of all, the romance between Braun and Sullivan is depicted with heartfelt sincerity, making their final scenes together all the more tender and poignant.For all its good intentions, however, the movie is weakened by a significant flaw: Despite Swain's clever screenplay (loaded with fruity one-liners), his depiction of the activism which is supposed to fire Braun's spirit is both underwritten and underplayed, resulting in a narrative imbalance. Braun is a little too laidback and carefree to be entirely convincing as the passionate, dedicated activist suggested by Swain's script, and while he pays regular lip service to his liberal convictions, his muted portrayal fails to convey the zest and forcefulness which characterized the gay liberation movement of the 1970's. Braun does his best with the material - he and Sullivan give fine performances in their own right - but his character lacks the sheer dynamism that might have elevated proceedings to a whole new level of achievement. Despite its flaws, however, THE TRIP is one of the most romantic gay films to emerge from independent US cinema in many years, and is heartily recommended. Lovely music score by Steven Chesne.TLA's fabulous DVD presentation includes a commentary by Swain, Braun, Sullivan and Irwin, during which they reminisce about shooting at Falcon's Lair in Beverly Hills (Rudolph Valentino's former home), and the challenges of producing such an ambitious project on a limited budget. They go out of their way to praise the contributions of experienced players like Baker, St. John and Art Hindle, and Swain describes how he petitioned Bruce Springsteen directly in order to use his song 'Cover Me' on the soundtrack (it would have been too expensive to acquire the tune through official channels). A trailer is included, along with deleted scenes and a short 'Making of' featurette. Oh, and watch out for the bloopers reel, during which - amongst other things - Braun is obliged to repeat an especially rude line of dialogue over and over again, not only for technical reasons, but because it sounds so darn sexy when he says it...",4,Tears and laughter in heartfelt romantic drama,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,3844,"['TRIP', 'USA', '2002', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'StereoThe', 'relationship', 'free-spirited', 'gay', 'activist', 'Steve', 'Braun', 'conservative', 'closet-case', 'Larry', 'Sullivan', 'tested', 'breaking', 'point', 'political', 'turbulence', '1970', 'bittersweet', 'conclusion', 'Reaganite', '80', 'when', 'AIDS', 'decimate', 'gay', 'community.Writer-director', 'Miles', 'Swain', 'feature', 'debut', 'warm-hearted', 'comedy-drama', 'far-reaching', 'furrow', 'two', 'decades', 'gay', 'liberation', 'opposites', 'who', 'attract', 'other', 'better', 'judgment', 'Braun', 'EVERYBODY', 'DOING', 'IT', 'Sullivan', 'FORBIDDEN', 'CITY', 'are', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'profoundly', 'altered', 'burgeoning', 'love', 'one', 'eccentric', 'supporting', 'cast', 'magical', 'web', 'including', 'former', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Jill', 'St.', 'John', '[', 'DIAMONDS', 'ARE', 'FOREVER', ']', 'Sullivan', 'daffy', 'kleptomaniac', 'mother', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Ray', 'Baker', '[', 'WHAT', 'LIES', 'BENEATH', ']', 'scheming', 'politician', 'who', 'Sullivan', 'own', 'bed', 'Sirena', 'Irwin', '[', 'TV', 'Stripperella', ']', 'bubble-headed', 'blonde', 'who', 'forced', 'step', 'aside', 'two', 'main', 'men', 'life', 'begin', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'ubiquitous', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', '[', 'THINK', 'DO', ']', 'activist', 'more', 'interested', 'bedding', 'guys', 'changing', 'world', 'fads', 'fashions', 'ages', 'past', 'are', 'exploited', 'hilt', 'costume', 'designers', 'Kristen', 'Anacker', 'Cherie', 'Sevilla', 'Granger', 'art', 'directors', 'David', 'Touster', 'Donna', 'Willinsky', 'changing', 'political', 'landscape', 'charted', 'series', 'contemporary', 'news', 'clips', 'set', 'player', ""'repeat"", 'glorious', 'moment', 'when', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'ambushed', 'live', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'Best', 'romance', 'Braun', 'Sullivan', 'depicted', 'heartfelt', 'sincerity', 'making', 'final', 'scenes', 'together', 'more', 'tender', 'poignant.For', 'good', 'intentions', 'however', 'movie', 'weakened', 'significant', 'flaw', 'Swain', 'clever', 'screenplay', 'loaded', 'fruity', 'one-liners', 'depiction', 'activism', 'supposed', 'fire', 'Braun', 'spirit', 'underwritten', 'underplayed', 'resulting', 'narrative', 'imbalance', 'Braun', 'little', 'too', 'laidback', 'carefree', 'be', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'passionate', 'dedicated', 'activist', 'suggested', 'Swain', 'script', 'regular', 'lip', 'service', 'liberal', 'convictions', 'muted', 'portrayal', 'fails', 'convey', 'zest', 'forcefulness', 'characterized', 'gay', 'liberation', 'movement', '1970', 'Braun', 'best', 'material', 'Sullivan', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'own', 'right', 'character', 'sheer', 'dynamism', 'might', 'have', 'elevated', 'proceedings', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'achievement', 'flaws', 'however', 'TRIP', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'gay', 'films', 'emerge', 'independent', 'US', 'cinema', 'many', 'years', 'heartily', 'recommended', 'Lovely', 'music', 'score', 'Steven', 'Chesne.TLA', 'fabulous', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'commentary', 'Swain', 'Braun', 'Sullivan', 'Irwin', 'reminisce', 'shooting', 'Falcon', 'Lair', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Rudolph', 'Valentino', 'former', 'home', 'challenges', 'producing', 'such', 'ambitious', 'project', 'limited', 'budget', 'go', 'way', 'praise', 'contributions', 'experienced', 'players', 'Baker', 'St.', 'John', 'Art', 'Hindle', 'Swain', 'describes', 'how', 'petitioned', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'directly', 'order', 'use', 'song', 'Me', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'expensive', 'acquire', 'tune', 'official', 'channels', 'trailer', 'included', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'short', ""'Making"", 'featurette', 'Oh', 'watch', 'out', 'bloopers', 'reel', 'amongst', 'other', 'things', 'Braun', 'obliged', 'repeat', 'especially', 'rude', 'line', 'dialogue', 'over', 'again', 'not', 'only', 'technical', 'reasons', 'so', 'darn', 'sexy', 'when']",N/A

778276,A1NIMHZNYMGNUL,B0000DD75N,Mark  Durand,"[4, 12]","But the writer (Miles Swain) asks a great deal of the faithful viewer. There is a tremendous smarminess that permeates this script. So much so that it's very easy to envision the writer behind an ancient Smith Corona typewriter smoking a cigarette through a holder wearing an ascot and a smoking jacket and plastered on the face, a cheesy smile while hacking out this garbage.Very little here works. Steve Braun, who stars as Tommy the gay activist, is a pure delight and wonderful. His performance is the only bright spot in this film. His co-star Larry Sullivan who plays Alan, on the other hand is just awful. In his defense, part of the problem is the script, but his thoroughly unlikable character swings with a thespian pendulum that goes from Jerry Lewis to Bruce Campbell. He plays a closeted Republican who falls in love with a gay activist. His level of self loathing in this work makes the film difficult to watch at times until he goes into some of the gay Jerry Lewis shtick, then it just becomes pathetic.The film is presented as a period piece and so much of the times frames are off that forgiveness is way too much to ask of the viewer.It takes so very long to get to THE TRIP, that we have forgotten the title of the film and frankly we no longer care.WARNING .........I'm going into Roger Ebert mode now and will spoil things!!!  So beware if you don't want anything revealed!!!!The writer asks us to buy a Republican who steals a Mexican police car, Buries his dead ex boyfriend in the middle of nowhere in Mexico, ( which makes me wonder what he told Tommy's parents when he got to the final destination, ""Hi Mom hi Dad, I planted your kid in the desert"" )  Then somehow he gets across the border back to the States, writes about it and makes a load of cash off the event.  What happens to Alan when the film ends would have been much more interesting than the film we are asked to swallow.

The Trip follows two gay men through young adulthood into early middle age.  One a fully realized gay young man living in truth to himself with honor without shame.  This first young man was doing what he could as a gay activist from the 1970's onward to champion causes of gay rights, HIV awareness and diversity.  The other gay man was a conflicted deeply closeted homosexual chap from one of those hellish super religious conservative homes where father rules with an iron fist and every aspect of waking life is lived daddy's straight arrow conservative way or no way.On his own and away from his militaristic thought police father at home the young seemingly conservative republican gay man starts writing the typical gay bashing exceedingly homophobic book his ultra conservative Dad would love.  The book is shelved at the time of its writing as not ripe for its time.  Through many plot twists and the passing of time the young conservative breaks the chains of his homophobic thinking and finds a gay friend who becomes in time a rtoom mate and soul mate for 4 years.  The two gay lovers dream some day of taking an adventurous trip together but it remains a pipe dream for now.Time marches on finally in the days of Anita Bryant and vile rampant homophobiia the moment is now right for publication of the ugly homo-hating book written in his more unenlightened times, poison words of a hardcore closet case who no longer exists.  Needless to say rlease of this totally homophobic book strains the love the conservative and the gay activist have for each other.  Time marches on, life situations change, intriques happen and life fortunes of some in our story rise as others fall.I won't give up the rest of the story but it is ALL GOOD!  Needless to say events conspire to insure the two lovers eventually get to take their adventurous trip that has become a matter of life, death and love in its most profound sense.  The ending is bitter sweet the kind of ending that stays with you long after the credits roll.  This movie leaves you with a wound in your heart that feels both good and bad at the same time.  This Trip offers an awesome wisdom born of the deepest pain yet I enjoyed the Journey even if its ending was bitter sweet.  The Trip wins my Howl of triumph tinged with sorrow.  This was a painful movie to watch but I am a much better man for my experience of its like and for that I give Thanks.",5,A Bitter Sweet Love Gay Themed Story,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,2529,"['Love', 'story', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'IF', 'ONLY', 'basic', 'premise', 'Trip', 'Trip', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'young', 'adulthood', 'early', 'middle', 'age', 'One', 'fully', 'realized', 'gay', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'truth', 'honor', 'shame', 'first', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'could', 'gay', 'activist', '1970', 'onward', 'champion', 'causes', 'gay', 'rights', 'HIV', 'awareness', 'diversity', 'other', 'gay', 'man', 'was', 'conflicted', 'deeply', 'closeted', 'homosexual', 'chap', 'one', 'hellish', 'super', 'religious', 'conservative', 'homes', 'where', 'father', 'rules', 'iron', 'fist', 'aspect', 'waking', 'life', 'lived', 'daddy', 'straight', 'arrow', 'conservative', 'way', 'way.On', 'own', 'away', 'militaristic', 'thought', 'police', 'father', 'home', 'young', 'seemingly', 'conservative', 'republican', 'gay', 'man', 'writing', 'typical', 'gay', 'bashing', 'exceedingly', 'homophobic', 'book', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'Dad', 'would', 'love', 'book', 'shelved', 'time', 'writing', 'not', 'ripe', 'time', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'passing', 'time', 'young', 'conservative', 'chains', 'homophobic', 'thinking', 'gay', 'friend', 'who', 'time', 'rtoom', 'mate', 'soul', 'mate', '4', 'years', 'two', 'gay', 'lovers', 'dream', 'day', 'taking', 'adventurous', 'trip', 'together', 'pipe', 'dream', 'now.Time', 'marches', 'finally', 'days', 'Anita', 'Bryant', 'vile', 'rampant', 'homophobiia', 'moment', 'now', 'right', 'publication', 'ugly', 'homo-hating', 'book', 'written', 'more', 'unenlightened', 'times', 'poison', 'words', 'hardcore', 'closet', 'case', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'Needless', 'say', 'rlease', 'totally', 'homophobic', 'book', 'love', 'conservative', 'gay', 'activist', 'have', 'other', 'Time', 'marches', 'life', 'situations', 'change', 'intriques', 'happen', 'life', 'fortunes', 'story', 'rise', 'others', 'fall.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'rest', 'story', 'ALL', 'GOOD', 'Needless', 'say', 'events', 'conspire', 'insure', 'two', 'lovers', 'eventually', 'get', 'take', 'adventurous', 'trip', 'become', 'matter', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'most', 'profound', 'sense', 'ending', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'kind', 'ending', 'long', 'credits', 'roll', 'movie', 'wound', 'heart', 'good', 'bad', 'same', 'time', 'Trip', 'awesome', 'wisdom', 'born', 'deepest', 'pain', 'yet', 'enjoyed', 'Journey', 'even', 'ending', 'was', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'Trip', 'wins', 'Howl', 'triumph', 'tinged', 'sorrow', 'was', 'painful', 'movie', 'watch', 'am', 'much', 'better', 'man', 'experience', 'like', 'give', 'Thanks']",N/A
