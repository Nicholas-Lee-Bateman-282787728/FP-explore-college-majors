I loved not only the songs and the band's performances, but Bill's and Bobby's on-stage show and (sometimes) joking around will make this a keeper for your concert collection. Some of their jokes made me laugh out loud... maybe they were rehearsed, but were still well done and got a good chuckle from me.This is the best of 1980s technology, maybe the cameras weren't that good back in the day, but it's a good show on stage.

737022,ASM7DZRYULUXI,B00008AOR6,"Jean T. Gilliland ""Jatg""","[1, 1]","In retrospect, this 1983 concert (filmed at The Roxy in Hollywood) by Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield--together forever known as the Righteous Brothers--represents the beginning of a 21-year-journey that would end suddenly, tragically, and much too soon in 2003 when ""little Brother"" Bobby Hatfield died suddenly while on tour, mere months after having been inducted into the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, in a cermony during which they gave a stellar performance of ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" (the only other quality post-reunion performance footage commercially available).  For that reason alone, this DVD is invaluable to Righteous Brothers fans as a keepsake.Despite the presence of several celebrities in the audience, including acclaimed songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, the concert itself is a low-key, intimate affair. In their early forties when this show was filmed, Medley and Hatfield have lost none of their vocal power or range, despite their voices having naturally matured and, in Hatfield's case, perhaps deepened half an octave.  Not to worry though--he may have had to work harder but he can still reach the high notes in ""Unchained Melody"".  The Brothers fearlessly alter melody lines, and the baritone-to-tenor-to-baritone-and-back-again vocal interplay between the two men is as arousing as ever; they milk that for all it's worth in a steamy rendition of ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"".  The Brothers joyfully cover their heroes Ray Charles, and Sam and Dave, and take the crowd back to their earliest days with the r'n'b-inspired hits from their underrated pre-Spector era catalog.Between songs, the playful banter between the Brothers, and between Brothers and audience, is relaxed and fun.  It's easy to see why they continued to tour almost continuously for the next twenty years, and this show is a reminder of why their fans have remained so loyal.The video and sound quality isn't up to contemporary digital standards, but that should detract only the most spoiled technocentric fan.  Otherwise, relax and enjoy.",4,A must for serious RB fans!,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,2056,"['retrospect', '1983', 'concert', 'filmed', 'Roxy', 'Hollywood', 'Bill', 'Medley', 'Bobby', 'Hatfield', 'together', 'forever', 'known', 'Righteous', 'Brothers', 'beginning', '21-year-journey', 'would', 'end', 'suddenly', 'tragically', 'much', 'too', 'soon', '2003', 'when', 'little', 'Brother', 'Bobby', 'Hatfield', 'died', 'suddenly', 'tour', 'mere', 'months', 'having', 'been', 'inducted', 'Rock', ""n'Roll"", 'Hall', 'Fame', 'cermony', 'gave', 'stellar', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'Lost', 'Lovin', 'Feeling', 'only', 'other', 'quality', 'post-reunion', 'performance', 'footage', 'commercially', 'available', 'reason', 'alone', 'DVD', 'invaluable', 'Righteous', 'Brothers', 'fans', 'keepsake.Despite', 'presence', 'several', 'celebrities', 'audience', 'including', 'acclaimed', 'songwriters', 'Barry', 'Mann', 'Cynthia', 'Weil', 'concert', 'low-key', 'intimate', 'affair', 'early', 'forties', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'Medley', 'Hatfield', 'have', 'lost', 'none', 'vocal', 'power', 'range', 'voices', 'having', 'naturally', 'matured', 'Hatfield', 'case', 'perhaps', 'deepened', 'octave', 'Not', 'worry', 'though', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'work', 'harder', 'can', 'still', 'reach', 'high', 'notes', 'Unchained', 'Melody', 'Brothers', 'fearlessly', 'alter', 'melody', 'lines', 'baritone-to-tenor-to-baritone-and-back-again', 'vocal', 'interplay', 'two', 'men', 'as', 'arousing', 'ever', 'milk', 'worth', 'steamy', 'rendition', ""'ve"", 'Lost', 'Lovin', 'Feeling', 'Brothers', 'joyfully', 'cover', 'heroes', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Sam', 'Dave', 'take', 'crowd', 'back', 'earliest', 'days', 'r', 'n', 'b-inspired', 'hits', 'underrated', 'pre-Spector', 'era', 'catalog.Between', 'songs', 'playful', 'banter', 'Brothers', 'Brothers', 'audience', 'relaxed', 'fun', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'continued', 'tour', 'almost', 'continuously', 'next', 'twenty', 'years', 'show', 'reminder', 'why', 'fans', 'have', 'remained', 'so', 'loyal.The', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', ""n't"", 'up', 'contemporary', 'digital', 'standards', 'should', 'detract', 'only', 'most', 'spoiled', 'technocentric', 'fan', 'Otherwise', 'relax', 'enjoy']",N/A
