1660669,A27F1WYCM6IEYH,B00DRCYAK4,Colten,"[0, 2]","As the series edged towards upset and drama in season 6, the series starts to become tense and difficult to watch. While the sixth season had a few powerful moments, the seventh season is unnecessary. The DVD offers fine audio/video quality, although little in the way of extras. Not recommended aside from fans who are looking to complete their collection of the series. Speaking of that, given Gene's history of marketing products, I'd be surprised if there was not a whole series set in a giant Kiss-themed box and somehow the discs - which are top-loaded - roll down a giant tongue.",1,"""Family Jewels"" worked well as a sitcom-ish look at the ""reality"" of Gene Simmons.",1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,586,"['series', 'edged', 'towards', 'upset', 'drama', 'season', '6', 'series', 'become', 'tense', 'difficult', 'watch', 'sixth', 'season', 'had', 'few', 'powerful', 'moments', 'seventh', 'season', 'unnecessary', 'DVD', 'fine', 'audio/video', 'quality', 'little', 'way', 'extras', 'Not', 'recommended', 'aside', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'complete', 'collection', 'series', 'Speaking', 'given', 'Gene', 'history', 'marketing', 'products', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'whole', 'series', 'set', 'giant', 'Kiss-themed', 'box', 'somehow', 'discs', 'are', 'top-loaded', 'roll', 'down', 'giant', 'tongue']",Gene Simmons Family Jewels: The Final Season
