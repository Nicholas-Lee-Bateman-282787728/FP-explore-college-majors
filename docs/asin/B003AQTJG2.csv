1334870,AK88POC4RCEWE,B003AQTJG2,Ben,"[25, 32]","Julie Delpy writes, directs and stars in ""The Countess"", a tale loosely based on the infamous Hungarian Countess Erzebet Bathory (also known as Elisabeth Bathory).The director wanted the audience to look at the life and tribulations of the countess through a female lens, while trying to banish all those perceptions of Bathory being evil into something that has nothing to do with witchcraft and the dark side at all, but it is actually the countess descents into madness because of her lover and her enemies.I think Julie Delpy has achieved that and she is perfect in her role as the normal-turned-to-a-madwoman Countess Erzebet Bathory. You can see she loves life, her subjects and after the mourning of her husband's passing, she does seem normal until she meet Istvan Thurzo (Daniel Br&uuml;hl). She fall madly in love with him although he is much, much younger than her.Still, Istvan loves her too. And that's when the problem starts as people begin to talk and Istvan's father (William Hurt as Gyorgy Thurzo) whom earlier tries to win the heart of the countess but failed now has a very intricate and evil plans to ruin the countess. From here on you can see how these plans drive the countess to the edge of madness.I applaud Miss Julie Delpy for her great works in this film. Very underrated in the festival circuits, sadly. This movie is very talky, but the reward when the film finishes tastes as fresh as the young virgin's blood.",5,the price of love,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,1442,"['Julie', 'Delpy', 'directs', 'stars', 'Countess', 'tale', 'loosely', 'based', 'infamous', 'Hungarian', 'Countess', 'Erzebet', 'Bathory', 'also', 'known', 'Elisabeth', 'Bathory', '.The', 'director', 'wanted', 'audience', 'look', 'life', 'tribulations', 'countess', 'female', 'lens', 'trying', 'banish', 'perceptions', 'Bathory', 'being', 'evil', 'something', 'nothing', 'do', 'witchcraft', 'dark', 'side', 'actually', 'countess', 'descents', 'madness', 'lover', 'enemies.I', 'think', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'achieved', 'perfect', 'role', 'normal-turned-to-a-madwoman', 'Countess', 'Erzebet', 'Bathory', 'can', 'see', 'life', 'subjects', 'mourning', 'husband', 'passing', 'seem', 'normal', 'meet', 'Istvan', 'Thurzo', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'hl', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'much', 'much', 'younger', 'her.Still', 'Istvan', 'too', 'when', 'problem', 'people', 'begin', 'talk', 'Istvan', 'father', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Gyorgy', 'Thurzo', 'whom', 'earlier', 'tries', 'win', 'heart', 'countess', 'failed', 'now', 'very', 'intricate', 'evil', 'plans', 'ruin', 'countess', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'plans', 'drive', 'countess', 'edge', 'madness.I', 'applaud', 'Miss', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'great', 'works', 'film', 'Very', 'underrated', 'festival', 'circuits', 'sadly', 'movie', 'very', 'talky', 'reward', 'when', 'film', 'finishes', 'as', 'fresh', 'young', 'virgin', 'blood']",The Countess

The Countess that killed many girls and noble alike for their blood to keep young. This movie isn't about vampires, it's a historical movie about her life and times.A lot of people have a misunderstanding of the medieval times. The movie did a great job representing the time. You can see that in her time women had rights and spoke their minds, the people in her time, didn't act that much different from us. You also got to see that the royals had less freedoms than the peasants. You could relate to any of the people in the movie. You get to see that Erzs&eacute;bet was human as anyone else. She had many affairs with women and men. To the people that think homosexuality is newly invited thing. Think again! It's been around since forever.The acting was superb. I do not know how historical accurate this movie about her life is, because there are some that don't think she did those crimes, and it all was made up to ruin her. I never found her that interesting, to kill with unjust reasoning as she did, just turns me off. But this movie makes you be the judge of her.The movie portrays a great ruler, a very powerful woman that spiewhirls down to a very weak woman, who's obsess in staying young. The movie shows her lunatic quite well, to how she sees what she thinks the blood is doing to her, to what everyone sees. In the end her obessiness vanity is her downfall. I think her punishment was quite fitting for her, which I will not tell. Does this make me want to read about her? Yes.

The film is based on the true history of the woman known as The Blood Countess, but after viewing this film it is obvious that the actual figure on whom the story is based was a brilliant political mind, a woman of noble breeding who could read and write in four languages, who once widowed was able to successfully defend her lands from the warring Turks and exact control over the reigning Hungarian King Matthias. But back to the history of the character as written by Delpy.  'Countess Elizabeth B&aacute;thory de Ecsed (B&aacute;thory Erzs&eacute;bet in Hungarian) (1560 - 1614) was a countess from the renowned B&aacute;thory family of Hungarian nobility. She is considered the most prolific female serial killer in history and possibly the most prolific of any gender. She and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls, with one witness attributing to them over 650 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Erzs&eacute;bet herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610, however, she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle, where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later. Later writings about the case have led to legendary accounts of the Countess bathing in the blood of virgins in order to retain her youth.'The film opens with voice over by Istv&aacute;n Thurz&oacute; (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) who relates the story of his only love. We are privy to the strange behaviors of the young Erzs&eacute;bet who had a sadistic streak and was at birth promised to be the bride of Ferenc N&aacute;dasdy (Charly H&uuml;bner). She became a beautiful woman and Erzs&eacute;bet (Julie Delpy) married General N&aacute;dasdy, gave birth to children, and together they were the power couple of Hungary.  When N&aacute;dasdy dies, Erzs&eacute;bet meets and falls passionately in love with Istv&aacute;n Thurz&oacute; (Daniel Br&uuml;hl), a many 19 years her junior, but Istvan's father Gy&ouml;rgy Thurz&oacute; (William Hurt) prevents Istvan from remaining with Erzs&eacute;bet.  Left alone Erzs&eacute;bet remains a powerful warrior, dallies with the sadomasochistic Dominic Vizakna (Sebastian Blomberg), but fears her young lover will forget her if she ages.  She discovers that the blood from virgins will restore her youth and thus begins the serial killings to support her vanity.  As questions of debts owed to her by the King there is an investigation of her personal history led by Gy&ouml;rgy Thurz&oacute;  and without proper trial she is condemned to house arrest in darkened sealed rooms in her own Csejte Castle where her fate is sealed.The film is beautifully designed, costumed, photographed and scored, and Delpy manages to pace her story credibly and well.  For this viewer there is an absence of gritty passion that would make the history more indelible: Delpy and the remainder of the cast fail to create fiery on-screen chemistry that would have brought a sense of stronger impetus to the heinous acts that occur. But as a piece of rarely known history it is a fascinating film about a strong woman of the past and the impact she had on her country ... and on legends!

1334885,A2I2Y5S3C6PSWC,B003AQTJG2,Hello Earth!,"[2, 3]","The movie itself is very well done, historically well that depends on just how well the viewer is familiar with the history of Hungary, and their knowledge about the characters portrayed in the film.Count Ferencz Nadasdy, Erzsebeth's husband was a feared War-Lord, and a General who fought the Turks, and supported the Habsburg King, but was not a blood thirsty person who sat on top of Turkish corpses and drank wine!  Nor was he so arrogant towards the King, as portrayed in the film!! Yes, he was extremely rich, powerful, and the King owed him a lot of money, for services rendered on the behalf of the Crown. The King's Treasury was unable to fund and pay for the wages of the soldiers to fight the Turks, and Count Nadadsy loaned the sums to the Crown used his own resources to pay for cost of war.Count Gyorgy Thurzo, was the Palentine, Viceroy of the Kingdom of Hungary, or what was left of Hungary during the Turkish occupation and constant wars. Thurzo was a shrewd, power and money hungry person with great political influence at the Court of the Habsburg King. Thurzo was not from the old noble stock, but gained his nobility through marriage and of commerce.Countess Erzsebet Bathory, was old nobility. Her relatives included the Chief Justice of Hungary, the King of Poland (Istvan Bathory), and the Prince of Transilvania. She was also protestant and not catholic. She was extremely wealthy on her own, and when she married the Count Nadasdy, their combined wealth made them the largest landowners and the wealthiest nobles in Hungary at the time.Erzsebet Bathory, was no saint for sure, she was intelligent, head strong, fearless, and very well educated when females usually were not. She was also a loving mother. She had five children with her husband, two died at very young age, which was very common in those days. Her marriage was arranged and was not based upon love, but to keep the families wealthy and powerful. Count Nadasdy was away most of the time fighting the Turks after his death she was even more isolated than before. While she was no raving beauty, she needed a man in her love life, and had several lovers.  Was she vain and only worried about her fading beauty? Aren't most females? They certainly keep all the cosmetic companies and plastic surgeons very rich!!! This was before such; she tried and used other methods such as herbs and herb baths to keep her skin supple.In reality there was a power struggle, between the Crown (Habsburgs) and the anti-Habsburg Hungarian leaders, Catholics and Protestants,  the Habsburg Crown against the Turks and a few other factions thrown into this toxic mix! Let's not forget a bit of greed, envy, vanity and such sins.What is the truth? Was she a blood sucking, deranged murderer who had young virgins killed in order to bathe in their blood? Or she was innocent powerful, head strong wealthy protestant woman (who secretly supported her nephew in an anti Habsburg rebellion, anti catholic) who was by all these traits dangerous to the Crown, who was trialed unjustly not even front of a Court, but by a signed order by the catholic King, obtained by the Palentine for their own personal gain!She was above the Law.  She had the ""Pallos Jog"" a term which reserved for extremely high and old nobility in Hungary. She had the right to kill any of her servants or even lesser nobility without any punishment who lived on her lands, as they were her property.By having a judgment and warrant against her signed by the King, the King did not had to repay all the monies that he owed to the family and she forfeited some of her lands to the Crown, given to Thurzo, and the remaining went to her son.  The Crown witnesses and accusers for the trial were her servants. These servants were uneducated and full of superstitions, and their testimony by the way, were obtained by torture. They would say anything including that she practiced witchcraft, drank blood, bathed in blood and they saw her killing young girls, she was a lesbian, a devil lover and etc. Thus a myth of her was fabricated and it was left to the superstitious ignorance which was so rampant to spread, with some well place propaganda by the Palentine, to this day. To all who do not know the reality she remains a monster, a blood sucking vampire. While in reality she was more of a tragic character who lived in a loveless relationship while married, she could had marry again but she did not wanted to marry any lesser nobility to give her immense wealth away. She was too wealthy, too powerful, too head strong for her own good, with a large dose of vanity about her aging body. Was she sadistic, mean? She was distant and she was above the Law, she knew that, but she loved her own children, and could show affection towards other children, as this was shown in the movie, sort of.The myth states that she was walled into a room. However, that was not the case. She was confined to her castle at Csejte, accused of being a monster, where she died shortly at the age of 54.However, one thing that was absolutely correctly stated in the movie ""History is tale told by the victors"" and the victors in this case were the Crown and the Palentine, Count Thurzo.",4,"Very interesting, well done movie but not quite accurate!",1341446400,"07 5,

1334889,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B003AQTJG2,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 2]","Julie Delpy wrote, produced, directed and starred in this perhaps somewhat-fictionalized historical account of the Countess Erzebet Bathory (1560-1614), an infamous, noble Hungarian widowed by her warlord Count.  This historical figure has been known as the Blood Countess and Countess Dracula, has been compared to Vlad III (Vlad the Impaler), and was loosely associated with witchcraft.From early childhood through marriage, and leading to the death of her husband, Erzebet (Julie Delpy) is painted with all the makings of a ""typical"" noblewoman with ""typical"" white-people-problems of the time.  We see the potential for both compassion and cold sociopathy in the future of this powerful and highly intelligent woman.In her late thirties Erzebet meets and fancies Istvan (Daniel Br&uuml;hl), a young noble and the son of Count Gyorgy Thurzo (William Hurt) whose recent advances she denied.  Young Istvan is quite sincerely taken with Erzebet, as is she with him.  But she finds herself transfixed on his fine skin and, ill-comparably, her aging skin (as she is nearly twenty years his senior).  Little did she know that Gyorgy would use her love for Istvan against her for years to come.After promises to be together, Erzebet waits for Istvan.  She becomes obsessed with ""looking worn and old"" and resigns herself to continuous fasting and prayer until Istvan answers her.  Later, actions of self loathing, self mutilation, and bondage fuel her descent into madness.  After some provocative suggestions from a vamp-like nobleman and a random household accident, she learns to find comfort in the rejuvenating properties of virgins' blood.  Her young handmaid plays the scapegoat of this psychosis as she is periodically drained.  As time passes, Erzebet's addiction to sanguineous cosmetics increases and so follows the body count with her state of mania.The film is presented with a strong feministic tone in support of Erzebet's integrity and actions despite her psychosis, as if told by Erzebet as an autobiography.  Delpy was fantastic.  Much as with Anonymous, an admirable job was done with a limited (i.e., non-Blockbuster) budget.  The cinematography and wardrobe were fantastic.  The set design should be noted for effort, but it takes a big budget to properly emulate the grandeur of nobility in period films.Lovers of this dark, murderous period piece should very much delight in Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (2007).",4,"Sanguineous, sincere, and psychotic!

We do get the basic facts and unlike ""Bathory' which paints her as not a serial killer , this is probably more accurate.  The times were very dark indeed. the Austrian Hungarian empire was in a 200 year war basically with the turks who were out to conquer Europe. At the same time witch burnings, and the inquisition was in full force.  It was just a truly monstrous age of terror.  The husband of bathory was one of the empires greatest warriors and he is depicted that way. We do get a more sober type of countess here. In legend she has black masses and human sacrifices , but the reality is probably much more like this. She thinks blood makes her younger so she kills many young women to get their blood. It makes more sense than the sensational black masses and devil worship scenario. Whatever the truth , we do get to see a powerful woman that was hated for it. If she hadn't gone wacko she'd would be remembered for her greatness , not for her evil.  I think the lead actress nailed the cold countess perfectly , who is a sociopath and a product of her times. Only she is a true nightmarish figure of history even for her sinister age.  I don't understand the one star reviews complaining that this is violent sick movie. EH?

1334935,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B003AQTJG2,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 2]","The Countess has a great premise in making the viewers visualize the story of Countess Elizabeth Bathory also called ""The Blood Countess"" and was said to be an inspiration for Dracula. Bathory's story is a fascinating one and I think what it makes it even more interesting is that we will likely never know the whole story and the truth (there's even the possibility that she was framed). Still, centuries after she died and committed atrocities rumors persist about Erzebet Bathory: did she commit those crimes? Approximately how many young virgins were killed? Obviously it's not a ""nice"" story; in fact it's a rather dark and evil one if you must know the truth.  The Countess is very much French actress Julie Delpy's brainchild for the most part as she wrote, directed and starred in its lead role.I don't know what viewers were expecting given that this film is obviously more of an independent release than a major release one, the acting in The Countess is a tad dry but I don't think it's awful; the performances are not so bad for a relatively low budget movie. Obviously the movie is not historically accurate and is more of a re-imagining of Elizabeth's tale. I can understand why to complains but I can't recall many movies that tackle the tale of Bathory and this one while not superb is not awful by any means.  filmmaking wise it was a good move and shows a more human aspect to it that justifies the murders. I thought Julie Delpy made a brilliant Bathory in some ways and she portrays her as very cold and intelligent woman yet she is also mysterious and reserved as you would imagine but there's also the part of her that loved and still loves; the part that hurts when her heart was broken. Love was integrated in the movie as the reason she committed the crimes (with her accomplices of course) Although some are complaining that she's not acting as evil or possessed as they would've liked but obviously this isn't the Elizabeth Bathory they wanted to give to viewers this wasn't the angle they had in mind for her. The way I see it they wanted to show a more human angle to her and less folklore fantasy that have accompanied her tale for centuries now. But there's just that something that doesn't make her give a truly great performance, it's as if she's holding back or doing too much and there's very little I liked that they didn't go with the predictable bathing in blood thing, in the movie she is not seen bathing in blood although she does put her hands in it and put it on her face. To Delpy's credit it is a complicated role to portay and I thought she still did a good job. They would have done well to explore things like Elizabeth's childhood further and her education being that she knew many languages, how she tortured others (but in The Countess they show accomplices using a device that I don't think Bathory ever used as it seems she preferred to inflict the punishment herself, however, that would have been interesting to see) and her taking over where her husband left off for instance.I think most of us would expect a more savage and ruthless Elizabeth Bathory from this film but instead what were getting here is a more psychological and perhaps more complicated approach to her. I must say I enjoyed the film but to be honest the running time is a bit short for a film on one of the greatest true horror stories the world has known. The Countess runs at an hour and 35 minutes and while it covers a lot of territory and most of what is important I thought it would have strongly beneficiated from at least an added 30 minutes or even perhaps potentially an hour. They could have explored her childhood more and developed certain aspects and elements further because at the end I felt it was short for such a story. Overall it doesn't end up being THE definitive film on the story of Countess Bathory and maybe that will come someday but its best we have so far and it's very enjoyable and not the worst independent film I have seen. I have had a fascination for Countess Elizabeth for some time now and although the film is not perfect it's certainly a good imagining of her story and her romance and the result is enjoyable. As a fictionalized account of Elizabeth Bathory it works well but some of the acting left a little something to desire and I was left with the feeling that the movie ended up being too short as I already mentioned. Did I like The Countess? Yes, but I didn't ""love"" it. If you have even a light interest in the Blood Countess, this is an interesting film although it is neither essential nor required viewing. ***",3,She sacrificed all for love... and sacrificed others for beauty,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,4588,"['Countess', 'great', 'premise', 'making', 'viewers', 'visualize', 'story', 'Countess', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'also', 'called', 'Blood', 'Countess', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'inspiration', 'Dracula', 'Bathory', 'story', 'fascinating', 'one', 'think', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'will', 'likely', 'never', 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'truth', 'even', 'possibility', 'was', 'framed', 'Still', 'centuries', 'died', 'committed', 'atrocities', 'rumors', 'persist', 'Erzebet', 'Bathory', 'did', 'commit', 'crimes', 'Approximately', 'how', 'many', 'young', 'virgins', 'were', 'killed', 'not', 'nice', 'story', 'fact', 'rather', 'dark', 'evil', 'one', 'must', 'know', 'truth', 'Countess', 'very', 'much', 'French', 'actress', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'brainchild', 'most', 'part', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred', 'lead', 'role.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'viewers', 'were', 'expecting', 'given', 'film', 'obviously', 'more', 'independent', 'release', 'major', 'release', 'one', 'acting', 'Countess', 'tad', 'dry', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'awful', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'more', 're-imagining', 'Elizabeth', 'tale', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'complains', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'many', 'movies', 'tackle', 'tale', 'Bathory', 'one', 'not', 'superb', 'not', 'awful', 'means', 'filmmaking', 'wise', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'more', 'human', 'aspect', 'murders', 'thought', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'made', 'brilliant', 'Bathory', 'ways', 'very', 'cold', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'yet', 'also', 'mysterious', 'reserved', 'would', 'imagine', 'also', 'part', 'loved', 'still', 'part', 'when', 'heart', 'was', 'broken', 'Love', 'was', 'integrated', 'movie', 'reason', 'committed', 'crimes', 'accomplices', 'course', 'are', 'complaining', 'not', 'acting', 'evil', 'possessed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'wanted', 'give', 'viewers', 'was', ""n't"", 'angle', 'had', 'mind', 'way', 'see', 'wanted', 'show', 'more', 'human', 'angle', 'less', 'folklore', 'fantasy', 'have', 'accompanied', 'tale', 'centuries', 'now', 'just', 'something', ""n't"", 'make', 'give', 'truly', 'great', 'performance', 'holding', 'back', 'doing', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'little', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'predictable', 'bathing', 'blood', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'seen', 'bathing', 'blood', 'put', 'hands', 'put', 'face', 'Delpy', 'credit', 'complicated', 'role', 'portay', 'thought', 'still', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'explore', 'things', 'Elizabeth', 'childhood', 'further', 'education', 'being', 'knew', 'many', 'languages', 'how', 'tortured', 'others', 'Countess', 'show', 'accomplices', 'using', 'device', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Bathory', 'ever', 'used', 'preferred', 'inflict', 'punishment', 'herself', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'taking', 'where', 'husband', 'left', 'off', 'instance.I', 'think', 'most', 'would', 'expect', 'more', 'savage', 'ruthless', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'film', 'instead', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'here', 'more', 'psychological', 'perhaps', 'more', 'complicated', 'approach', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'be', 'running', 'time', 'bit', 'short', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'true', 'horror', 'world', 'known', 'Countess', 'hour', '35', 'minutes', 'lot', 'territory', 'most', 'what', 'important', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'strongly', 'beneficiated', 'least', 'added', '30', 'minutes', 'even', 'perhaps', 'potentially', 'hour', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'childhood', 'more', 'developed', 'certain', 'aspects', 'elements', 'further', 'because', 'end', 'felt', 'was', 'short', 'such', 'story', 'Overall', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'being', 'THE', 'definitive', 'film', 'story', 'Countess', 'Bathory', 'maybe', 'will', 'come', 'someday', 'best', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'worst', 'independent', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'had', 'fascination', 'Countess', 'Elizabeth', 'time', 'now', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'good', 'imagining', 'story', 'romance', 'result', 'enjoyable', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'well', 'acting', 'left', 'little', 'something', 'desire', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'too', 'short', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Did', 'like', 'Countess', 'Yes', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'have', 'even', 'light', 'interest', 'Blood', 'Countess', 'interesting', 'film', 'essential', 'required', 'viewing', '***']",The Countess
