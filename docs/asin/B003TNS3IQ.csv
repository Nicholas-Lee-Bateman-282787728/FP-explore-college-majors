1362286,A31A9GENAJYD64,B003TNS3IQ,David M. Rossi,"[0, 0]","The story portrays a socialite, rich woman who meets an Alaskan gold prospector and their struggles to make a life in the harshness of the Alaskan frontier. When her son goes missing and her husband goes off to find him, the woman undergoes the greatest test of her entire life, as for months she fends for herself, deals with injuries and has a baby.While the movie is good and does an excellent job at keeping your interest, even if you hadn't seen on the credits that this is a family channel movie, you'd know it as it's quite obviously a low budget cable movie. One can't help but wonder what might have transpired for the story had there been a bigger budget. Perhaps we could have also seen her husband and son's struggle to survive after they became lost, since it's mentioned at the end that her husband had even worse injuries and an even greater difficult path to survival with only her son to help keep them both alive. I certainly would have enjoyed seeing that right alongside the woman's struggle rather than ONLY seeing her difficulties.Also, if the husband and son had such a perilous experience and it was the son who kept the husband alive, why at the end does the son look like he's just been playing in the snow for a couple hours? His leather fringe jacket had a couple more fringe strands broken off than before, but that's it. Otherwise he looked fine, while the husband looked like death warmed over. But hey, it's a made for cable movie, so there's bound to be inconsistencies. 3.25 stars",3,Decent wilderness survival tale,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,1514,"['story', 'socialite', 'rich', 'woman', 'who', 'Alaskan', 'gold', 'prospector', 'struggles', 'make', 'life', 'harshness', 'Alaskan', 'frontier', 'When', 'son', 'missing', 'husband', 'find', 'woman', 'greatest', 'test', 'entire', 'life', 'months', 'herself', 'deals', 'injuries', 'baby.While', 'movie', 'good', 'excellent', 'job', 'keeping', 'interest', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'credits', 'family', 'channel', 'movie', ""'d"", 'know', 'quite', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'cable', 'movie', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'transpired', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'bigger', 'budget', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'husband', 'son', 'struggle', 'survive', 'became', 'lost', 'mentioned', 'end', 'husband', 'had', 'even', 'worse', 'injuries', 'even', 'greater', 'difficult', 'path', 'survival', 'only', 'son', 'help', 'keep', 'alive', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'right', 'woman', 'struggle', 'rather', 'ONLY', 'seeing', 'difficulties.Also', 'husband', 'son', 'had', 'perilous', 'experience', 'was', 'son', 'who', 'kept', 'husband', 'alive', 'why', 'end', 'son', 'look', 'just', 'been', 'playing', 'snow', 'couple', 'hours', 'leather', 'fringe', 'jacket', 'had', 'couple', 'more', 'fringe', 'strands', 'broken', 'off', 'before', 'looked', 'fine', 'husband', 'looked', 'death', 'warmed', 'made', 'cable', 'movie', 'bound', 'be', 'inconsistencies', '3.25', 'stars']",N/A
