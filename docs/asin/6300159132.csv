Note, though, if you're on the fence about picking up Geneon's bare-bones 2005 release, that Amazon's reporting of a 1.33:1 framing is inaccurate; the print appears to be the same in terms of picture quality (from the UCLA Film and Television Archive), running time (118 mins.) and aspect ratio (1.85:1) as Image's 2001 version (also currently out of print but much pricier).  4 stars each for content and presentation.",4,Geneon's print is widescreen,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,765,"['Little', 'Acre', 'likeable', 'Southern-gothic', 'Depression-era', 'drama', 'full', 'eccentric', 'characterizations', 'occasional', 'over-emoting', 'not', 'unsuitable', 'genre', 'melting', 'pot', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'brought', 'vividly', 'life', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'directors', 'time', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'Deal', '73', 'Cid', 'Note', 'though', ""'re"", 'fence', 'picking', 'up', 'Geneon', 'bare-bones', '2005', 'release', 'Amazon', 'reporting', '1.33:1', 'framing', 'inaccurate', 'print', 'be', 'same', 'terms', 'picture', 'quality', 'UCLA', 'Film', 'Television', 'Archive', 'running', 'time', '118', 'mins', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'Image', '2001', 'version', 'also', 'currently', 'print', 'much', 'pricier', '4', 'stars', 'content', 'presentation']",N/A

It is instead a 1:85 Wide Screen aspect ratio, and the pristine print, restored by UCLA, is presented in its uncensored 118 minutes. However, and unfortunately, it is NOT ANAMORPHIC, so if you have a big Flat Screen, you're in for a big disappointment: you'll get a nice widescreen image surrounded by a lot of empty black space. Unforgivable for such a ""recent"" re-release. I suppose that explains the low price. I have no idea if the original DVD release on Image Entertainment is anamorphic, but to my great surprise, all of Image Entertainment DVDs I've purchased as far back as 2001 fill my entire 55"" flat screen. I guess we'll have to wait for Criterion to do this one justice though it will be a pricier disc.As to the film itself, it's not for everyone. It is a satire on old time religion with a cast of rather unpleasant characters, and though it's beautifully restored, the print tends to look kind of inky most of the time. In its day it was considered ""daring"" by some and ""salacious"" by others. By today's standards, however, it is quite tame.

197727,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300159132,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 7]","Erskin Caldwell (1903-1987) was hardly in the same league with William Faulkner or Tennessee Williams, but like both those authors he drew his tales from the sordid side of southern life--and in the process created two novels that had unexpected popular resonance: the 1932 TOBACCO ROAD and the 1933 GOD'S LITTLE ACRE. Both presented remarkably trashy portraits of rural southern farming families steaming with depraved sexuality, coarse humor, and nasty habits. Southerners were outraged by the portrait, but to their chagrin the wider world took the books as gospel truth. TOBACCO ROAD was a massive success first as a novel, then as a play, and finally as a film--but GOD'S LITTLE ACRE, published on its heels (and partly due to several high profile censorship cases) would go on to become the single best-selling novel of all time, a position it would hold until 1966 and the advent of Jacqueline Susann's VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.Although the book is actually tame by today's standards, Hollywood didn't dare consider it until the production code began to crumble in the late 1950s--and even then no mainstream studio would touch it. Even so, the film is surprisingly competent in a technical sense, well directed, well acted, and receiving superior production values. No fewer than three Oscar-worthy individuals were involved in the production: screenwriter Ben Maddow, who was nominated for the THE ASPHALT JUNGLE; cinematographer Ernest Haller, who was nominated on seven occasions and received the award for no less than GONE WITH THE WIND; and composer Elmer Bernstein, who received a total of eleven nominations and received the award for THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE. Although director Antony Mann was not quite in this league, he was nonetheless a notedly compent director, and the cast included no less than Robert Ryan, Aldo Ray, and a host of rising stars including Tina Louise, Jack Lord, and Michael Landon.Even so, it is still GOD'S LITTLE ACRE and there's nothing that can be done about that. Ty-Ty (Robert Ryan) is a farmer who has spent fifteen years digging for gold (a treasure is said to be buried on the farm land) instead of tilling the soil. In consequence the family is dirt poor. His son Buck (Jack Lord) has married sexy Griselda (Tina Louise, with plenty of cleavage crammed into thin dresses); his daughter Rosamund (Helen Wescott) has married Bill Thompson (Aldo Ray.) Trouble is that Griselda is hot for Bill and he for her, and both Buck and Rosamund know it to their sorrow. And then there is daughter Darlin' Jill (Fay Spain), a three-alarm slut crazy for just about any man she can get out of his pants, including the albino (Michael Landon) Ty-Ty kidnaps because--well, it's a long story. Add in a subplot about closed mills and the union movement, a whole heap of longing gazes, and dialogue about grits and pork fat and there you are, right in the middle of GOD'S LITTLE ACRE.The first fifteen minutes or so are actually superior in a technical sense. Bernstein's score and title song are memorable and quickly snatch you into the opening sequence of Ty-Ty and his sons digging for gold, interrupted first by Griselda, interrupted second by visitor Pluto (Buddy Hackett), and then a burst of memorable scenes: Ty-Ty's explanation about ""God's Little Acre,"" eating watermelon in the kitchen, the decision to kidnap an albino, and a very amusing and naughty incident in which Darlin' Jill forces lustful Pluto to pump a little cool water into her outdoor bath. But thereafter the film goes wrong.The basic problem is that everyone in the story is a half-wit with a funny name, and in between bouts of half-witted stupidity they sit around and lust over each other in a down home on the farm sort of way. The story is too ridiculous to be taken seriously, but that is precisely what everyone connected with the film does; it soon becomes ponderous and then commits the unforgiveable sin of being dull. In the end, we're left with a bunch of people we think should be locked up lest they reproduce. They sit around all the holes in the farm land and wonder what went wrong. So too do we. Even so, it's better than the badly written book; casually recommended on that basis and for the score and cinematography.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Grits and Pork Fat,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,4260,"['Erskin', 'Caldwell', '1903-1987', 'was', 'hardly', 'same', 'league', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'authors', 'drew', 'tales', 'sordid', 'side', 'southern', 'life', 'process', 'created', 'two', 'novels', 'had', 'unexpected', 'popular', 'resonance', '1932', 'TOBACCO', 'ROAD', '1933', 'GOD', 'LITTLE', 'ACRE', 'Both', 'presented', 'remarkably', 'trashy', 'portraits', 'rural', 'southern', 'farming', 'families', 'steaming', 'depraved', 'sexuality', 'coarse', 'humor', 'nasty', 'habits', 'Southerners', 'were', 'outraged', 'portrait', 'chagrin', 'wider', 'world', 'took', 'books', 'gospel', 'truth', 'TOBACCO', 'ROAD', 'was', 'massive', 'success', 'first', 'novel', 'then', 'play', 'finally', 'film', 'GOD', 'LITTLE', 'ACRE', 'published', 'heels', 'partly', 'due', 'several', 'high', 'profile', 'censorship', 'cases', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'single', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'time', 'position', 'would', 'hold', '1966', 'advent', 'Jacqueline', 'Susann', 'VALLEY', 'THE', 'DOLLS.Although', 'book', 'actually', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'Hollywood', 'did', ""n't"", 'dare', 'consider', 'production', 'code', 'began', 'crumble', 'late', '1950s', 'even', 'then', 'mainstream', 'studio', 'would', 'touch', 'Even', 'so', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'competent', 'technical', 'sense', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'receiving', 'superior', 'production', 'values', 'fewer', 'three', 'Oscar-worthy', 'individuals', 'were', 'involved', 'production', 'screenwriter', 'Ben', 'Maddow', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'THE', 'ASPHALT', 'JUNGLE', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'occasions', 'received', 'award', 'less', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'composer', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'who', 'received', 'total', 'eleven', 'nominations', 'received', 'award', 'THOROUGHLY', 'MODERN', 'MILLIE', 'director', 'Antony', 'Mann', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'league', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'notedly', 'compent', 'director', 'cast', 'included', 'less', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'Aldo', 'Ray', 'host', 'rising', 'stars', 'including', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Michael', 'Landon.Even', 'so', 'still', 'GOD', 'LITTLE', 'ACRE', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Ty-Ty', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'farmer', 'who', 'spent', 'fifteen', 'years', 'digging', 'gold', 'treasure', 'said', 'be', 'buried', 'farm', 'land', 'instead', 'tilling', 'soil', 'consequence', 'family', 'dirt', 'poor', 'son', 'Buck', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'married', 'sexy', 'Griselda', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'plenty', 'cleavage', 'crammed', 'thin', 'dresses', 'daughter', 'Rosamund', 'Helen', 'Wescott', 'married', 'Bill', 'Thompson', 'Aldo', 'Ray', 'Trouble', 'Griselda', 'hot', 'Bill', 'Buck', 'Rosamund', 'know', 'sorrow', 'then', 'daughter', 'Darlin', 'Jill', 'Fay', 'Spain', 'three-alarm', 'slut', 'crazy', 'just', 'man', 'can', 'get', 'pants', 'including', 'albino', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Ty-Ty', 'kidnaps', 'because', 'well', 'long', 'story', 'Add', 'subplot', 'closed', 'mills', 'union', 'movement', 'whole', 'heap', 'longing', 'gazes', 'dialogue', 'grits', 'pork', 'fat', 'are', 'right', 'middle', 'GOD', 'LITTLE', 'ACRE.The', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'actually', 'superior', 'technical', 'sense', 'Bernstein', 'score', 'title', 'song', 'are', 'memorable', 'quickly', 'snatch', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Ty-Ty', 'sons', 'digging', 'gold', 'interrupted', 'first', 'Griselda', 'interrupted', 'second', 'visitor', 'Pluto', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'then', 'burst', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Ty-Ty', 'explanation', 'God', 'Little', 'Acre', 'eating', 'watermelon', 'kitchen', 'decision', 'kidnap', 'albino', 'very', 'amusing', 'naughty', 'incident', 'Darlin', 'Jill', 'forces', 'lustful', 'Pluto', 'pump', 'little', 'cool', 'water', 'outdoor', 'bath', 'thereafter', 'film', 'wrong.The', 'basic', 'problem', 'everyone', 'story', 'half-wit', 'funny', 'name', 'bouts', 'half-witted', 'stupidity', 'sit', 'around', 'lust', 'other', 'down', 'home', 'farm', 'sort', 'way', 'story', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'precisely', 'what', 'everyone', 'connected', 'film', 'soon', 'ponderous', 'then', 'unforgiveable', 'sin', 'being', 'dull', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'bunch', 'people', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'lest', 'reproduce', 'sit', 'holes', 'farm', 'land', 'wonder', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'So', 'too', 'do', 'Even', 'so', 'better', 'badly', 'written', 'book', 'casually', 'recommended', 'basis', 'score', 'cinematography.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Original erotic tone of the Caldwell's novel was soften for this screen version, though overall atmosphere tranfered well for the motion picture for us to feel the southern heat and passionate lives of a Georgia farmers.Robert Ryan plays Ty Ty, the obsessed gold digging patriarch who almost led his family members to a total tragedy. Here, Ryan proves himself as an effective stage actor (He really was an active stage actor also.) by demonstrating a powerful, almost caricature like portrait. He diffuses character's laughter, anger, sorrow and regret with a perfectly balanced emotion through out the film. Some thought that the role of Ty Ty was not suitable for Ryan who used to play dark characters with serious intensions, but probably nobody could play the role better than him, because from many prospects, Ty Ty is a quite complex figure. It is so unfair to think that Ryan was never nominated for Oscar with his great performances from the great films like THE SET-UP, ON DANGEROUS GROUND, CLASH BY NIGHT, INFERNO, MEN IN WAR, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, BILLY BUDD, THE ICEMAN COMETH or this.Neither director Anthony Mann got no reputation for directing GOD'S LITTLE ACRE. Many saw him as an effective Western director, but he was more than that. He respected F.W. Murnau and loved Greek mythology. His sense of scenery and dramatic way of expressions are no comparison to the others. He saw the action was prominent way for effective story telling. He put every creativities to GOD'S LITTLE ACRE that the film actually possesses pure pictorial beauty of the southern land, remarkably intelligent tragicomedy flair, full of actions with symbolism, and the deep observation of human nature.

197733,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6300159132,T O'Brien,"[24, 25]","Released in 1958, Anthony Mann's God's Little Acre caused a scandal in theaters and was even banned in many places.  Now 50 years later, the DVD format lets viewers see what they may have missed.  In 1930s rural Georgia, Ty Ty Walden and his family live on a farm, barely scraping by.  Ty Ty was told by his great grandfather there's gold buried on the farm, and he's convinced it's still there.  Helped out by his sons, he's been digging for 15 years without luck.  The gold story serves as a jumping off point for the rest of the story, the relationships and dynamics of Ty Ty's family.  Directed by Anthony Mann, this is a beautifully shot movie, in more ways than one, as the story of the Walden family develops.  The relationships are real, the love and hot believable as Ty Ty tries to find the gold while also continuing to be able to live.  It's not a well-known movie, but it's an enjoyable movie, if for nothing else than to see what all the scandal was about.  It seems tame compared to movies now, but you can see why it caused a stir.In what's really an ensemble cast, Robert Ryan gives one of his best performances as Ty Ty Walden, the family patriarch trying to keep his family together, all the while searching for his great grandfather's gold.  Ryan pulls off the dramatic and comedic scenes equally well throughout, especially the scenes with the cross on his farm's God's little acre.  Aldo Ray plays Will Thompson, Ty's son-in-law who's been out of a job for six months since a mill closed.  Will married Ty's daughter Rosamund (Helen Westcott) but really loves Griselda, married to Ty's son Buck.  They have a history together, and it's their scenes together that caused a stir upon the movie's release.  Tina Louise of Gilligan's Island fame shows off what a good actress she is in her first movie role as Griselda, the beautiful wife of Buck who still has feelings for Will.  Mann puts Louise on display throughout, and she looks more beautiful here than any of her Ginger Grant days.  Jack Lord and Vic Morrow are very good as Ty's sons, Buck, the jealous husband who worries his wife doesn't love him, and Shaw, the younger son still growing up.  Buddy Hackett has a funny part as Pluto Swint, a local man running for sheriff who's fallen in love with Ty's youngest daughter, Darling Jill (Fay Spain).  Also worth mentioning is Michael Landon as Dave Dawson, an albino who Ty is convinced will lead them to the gold.The DVD doesn't have any special features, but the movie looks great in a widescreen presentation, Ernest Haller's cinematography never looked better.  This isn't a great movie, but it's positives heavily outweight the negatives.  So for a good story with great performances from Robert Ryan and Tina Louise, check out God's Little Acre!",3,"Scandalous in the 1950s, still worth a watch",1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,2778,"['Released', '1958', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'God', 'Little', 'Acre', 'caused', 'scandal', 'theaters', 'was', 'even', 'banned', 'many', 'places', 'Now', '50', 'years', 'later', 'DVD', 'format', 'viewers', 'see', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'missed', '1930s', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'Ty', 'Ty', 'Walden', 'family', 'live', 'farm', 'barely', 'scraping', 'Ty', 'Ty', 'was', 'told', 'great', 'grandfather', 'gold', 'buried', 'farm', 'convinced', 'still', 'there', 'Helped', 'out', 'sons', 'been', 'digging', '15', 'years', 'luck', 'gold', 'story', 'serves', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'rest', 'story', 'relationships', 'dynamics', 'Ty', 'Ty', 'family', 'Directed', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'movie', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'story', 'Walden', 'family', 'relationships', 'are', 'real', 'love', 'hot', 'believable', 'Ty', 'Ty', 'find', 'gold', 'also', 'continuing', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'not', 'well-known', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'see', 'what', 'scandal', 'was', 'about', 'tame', 'compared', 'movies', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'caused', 'stir.In', 'what', 'really', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Ty', 'Ty', 'Walden', 'family', 'patriarch', 'trying', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'while', 'searching', 'great', 'grandfather', 'gold', 'Ryan', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'equally', 'well', 'especially', 'scenes', 'cross', 'farm', 'God', 'little', 'acre', 'Aldo', 'Ray', 'plays', 'Will', 'Thompson', 'Ty', 'son-in-law', 'who', 'been', 'job', 'six', 'months', 'mill', 'closed', 'Will', 'married', 'Ty', 'daughter', 'Rosamund', 'Helen', 'Westcott', 'really', 'Griselda', 'married', 'Ty', 'son', 'Buck', 'have', 'history', 'together', 'scenes', 'together', 'caused', 'stir', 'movie', 'release', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'fame', 'off', 'what', 'good', 'actress', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'Griselda', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Buck', 'who', 'still', 'feelings', 'Will', 'Mann', 'Louise', 'display', 'more', 'beautiful', 'here', 'Ginger', 'Grant', 'days', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Ty', 'sons', 'Buck', 'jealous', 'husband', 'who', 'wife', ""n't"", 'love', 'Shaw', 'younger', 'son', 'still', 'growing', 'up', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'funny', 'part', 'Pluto', 'Swint', 'local', 'man', 'running', 'sheriff', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'Ty', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Darling', 'Jill', 'Fay', 'Spain', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Dave', 'Dawson', 'albino', 'who', 'Ty', 'convinced', 'will', 'lead', 'gold.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'special', 'features', 'movie', 'great', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'cinematography', 'never', 'looked', 'better', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'positives', 'heavily', 'outweight', 'negatives', 'So', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'performances', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'Tina', 'Louise', 'check', 'out', 'God', 'Little', 'Acre']",N/A
