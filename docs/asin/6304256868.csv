He's a tremendous actour....when he bothers to reads the script. Of course here, he has no speaking lines. Should have been a give-away.Several friends of mine and I suffered this absolutely bizarre film together. We now have a club going. Whenever we see anything in a film now that seems disconnected from the storyline, or flat out makes no sense, we look at each other and say, ""Ah!The silver shoe."" This refers to the almost completely unexplained appearance of a oversized silver lame shoe, casually floating down a stream. Brandon Frasier's expression at that moment- complete and utter confusion- is perhaps the best single description of the entire film. That's how it is likely to make the watcher feel.There is nothing deep here. Someone's trying to convince the watcher that because it is arcane, the film has meaning. It does not. And it brooks no apologies for it either. Don't waste your time, unless you just have too much on your hands.

For two-thirds of its length, &quot;Darkly&quot; is fascinating and compelling, though with noticeably less humor than the earlier film.  Where &quot;Darkly&quot; falls down badly is its finale, which is all too predictable and action-heavy. The quirky postlude doesn't work at all; the surrealism feels unmotivated and heavy-handed -- Symbolism with a capital S.Despite the flaws, there is much to admire here.

The couple is living in the forest to escape being looked down upon in town for not being married?  Darkly used to belong to a religious sect/cult in which his parents were killed, again by those vicious ""local townspeople"".  So when and where is this taking place?  100 years ago?  Can't be - everything looks modern.  Then we got this Quaker of a character in Darkly Noon, who falls in love with the woman, Calley.  Calley's man, Clay, actually goes along with her idea to have him stay with them.  Bad idea.Now, if your can get past some of the silliness in the basic set-up of the story, you may be able to enjoy the lush beauty of the forest and the valley where it all takes place.  Brendan Fraser does a reasonable job as the repressed and stuttering Darkly Noon.. Darkly's a bit of a nut-job at times, though still likable in a way.  You can't completely blame him after all.  Calley's always in the skimpiest of halter tops and short skirts, driving poor Darkly mad!Later he meets an older woman and fellow wack-job also living in the forest not far from Calley and her husband, who turns out to be Clay's mother, and who holds Calley responsible for the death of her husband and for stealing her mute boy away from her.  She gives Darkly the idea that Calley is a witch.  Darkly in an attempt to deal with his conflicting emotions embarks on a course of nightly mutilations.  Yes, good old Darkly is slowly losing what's left of his mind.. and we get to sit through it - yay!  Later, we're even treated to a visit by Darkly's dead parents who ask him if he's been eating properly, saying his prayers and oh yeah, have you killed that darn witch yet?Viggo Mortenson does a great job of the boyfriend Clay, the only one with any sense in this movie.

409929,A2FELGF4SKTFMA,6304256868,L. Argiri,"[3, 4]","Well, at least it grows on me. I like Philip Ridley's movies because they usually feature Viggo Mortensen, along with the kind of imagery that my brain produces on its own when it's feeling creative.  Go into one of his films, and you're where the id and its lawless hankerings define the world and tell the story. You can best savor The Passion of Darkly Noon if you don't allow yourself to go all left-brained and analytical, because this is not a narrative wedded to factuality, and its psychological realism is selective.I heard somewhere that Passion was filmed in the mountains of Germany, but the setting is supposed to be the mountains of North Carolina, with which I am personally familiar.  So I can vouch that up there it doesn't get protractedly, viciously hot as depicted in the film, but the heat's there for a reason, as symptom and provocateur of unhinged behavior. As the film opens, it's deranging hot, suffering hot; sunlight falls with a punishing coppery sheen on all surfaces, and faces and other exposed areas are slick and oily with sweat. Young Darkly Noon (Brendan Fraser) is a dazed wanderer, the sole survivor of a cult.  Apparently the cult's neighbors have gotten sick and tired of the cult in their midst and slaughtered the cult members.  Darkly has narrowly escaped this conflagration and fled into the countryside.After collapsing on the road, Darkly is brought to one of the few homes in the area and taken in by Callie (Ashley Judd), whose lover Clay (Mortensen) is off on one of his occasional extended camping trips in the woods.Despite the remoteness of her little homestead and the fact that she's alone there (and lacks a telephone to call for backup - many of the modern conveniences don't figure in this story) Callie takes Darkly in. We learn that the people ""in town"" regard Callie as a witch, and it's easy to believe that she's a disrupting force in the same way as Winona Ryder's character in The Crucible: the best-looking and most overtly sensuous woman in a small, insular, ignorant place has often been at risk for such accusations.  Judd's Callie is innocently, pathologically fearless, going in her minimal nightgown to check on her sick guest; one can believe she doesn't really mean to incite him.  It's easy to accept Callie as sensual but not vain; her armpits are furry, her golden hair appears to have been hacked with nail scissors, so her often-backlit head resembles a ragged yellow chrysanthemum.  Perhaps she does all that she does in a kind of catlike ease within her own skin, not to incite or gratify anyone else.On her own turf, secure in her convictions, she believes that she controls the situation far more than she actually does.Skimpily clad, cheerleader legs bare to there, Judd's Callie pads and paces languorously, and once Darkly is awake to notice, he's so riled he can barely say a word to her without stuttering.  When Callie discovers that he grew up in a cult and thinks sex is a sin, she endeavors to change his ground-in Christian cultic convictions for her easygoing neopagan views.  She won't use his name, nicknames him ""Lee,"" and lectures him earnestly, as adult to idiot child: ""Lee, I want to talk to you...""  She tries to coax him into a hot spring and, when he refuses, strips to her slip and has her soak with him as a half-delighted, half-consternated watcher.  Fraser's face is a study, rubbery and twitchy and somehow unfinished-looking; his changeable eyes continually fight it out between the need to look and the fear of looking. His big body is carried in a childlike way, if you can imagine a six-foot-four, vastly-physically-ill-at-ease child; his stutter is impenetrable.  But only until Darkly decides how he should deal with Callie, and then his stride smoothes out, his speech attains perfect fluency.Callie's arrogance, her assumption that showing Darkly a more comfortable approach to life means that he will/should accept that approach, is an innocent arrogance.  Really, it's rather like the Bush Administration's apparent idea that other cultures don't exist in any consequential way and should greet forced reform with open arms and instant compliance-only Callie means well. She also means well when Clay returns and she coaxes Clay to let Darkly join their family.Now, in real life, I don't believe for a minute that any female that hot thinks for one single moment that she can bring a young, sex-starved, heterosexual male into the ""family"" of herself and her lover, with whom she's obviously besotted, and expect the arrangement to work out fine for all involved.  However, in the world of the film, Callie does expect exactly that.  She's wrong; something really, really nasty ensues; her fragile little house gets burned down; poor Clay, while defending her from her psychotic charity case, sustains enough injuries to sideline a whole football team. I will say that one of the star turns in this film is done by Mortensen just before the denouement.  At that point, Clay and Callie are deep in some very delightful, semi-rough foreplay, and Clay, in a daze of arousal, is confronted by his rampaging guest, and within a second or so is in full combat mode, fighting for Callie's life and his own. It's a fierce, fabulous scene, with a genuine startle-and-flinch factor that I value - believable, legitimate, genuinely frightening film violence.",5,This one grows on you...,1132444800,"11 20,

409933,A215TKDDK1SLXU,6304256868,Rachel,"[3, 3]","Wow! I can honestly say that ""The Passion of Darkly Noon"" is the most gloomy and disturbing film I have ever seen.The plot is a very melancholy one. Darkly Noon is a young Christian man whose life is torn apart when intruders invade his cult's dwelling, killing his parents. He finds his shelter in the house of a youthful couple, Callie and Clay. From the day he meets her, Darkly is smitten by Callie, and swiftly becomes insane as he realizes how unavailable she is. After he ventures into the nearby forest, Darkly hears from multiple sources that Callie is a witch who plays with men's minds, and that she and Clay are living in sin. He decides to take Callie and Clay's punishment into his own hands.Brendan Fraser's performance simply cannot be expressed in words. It is phenomenal and heartbreaking. From the first seconds of the film, you know that Darkly is in deep trouble. His downward spiral into psychopathy is throughly creepy.I'm not sure if Ashley Judd was the right actress for this role. She plays her part well, but someone else probably could have done a better job.I cannot give an appropriate age for when someone will be able to watch this movie, because it is different for everyone. What I can say is, if you are going to watch this film, you MUST be mature and be prepared to see explicit, graphic images: corpses, stabbing, shooting, self-mutilation.

409935,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6304256868,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","&lt;strong>The Passion of Darkly Noon&lt;/strong> (Philip Ridley, 1995)Ah, 1995. I vaguely remember all the teenaged girls swooning over this movie back in the day. I assume it had something to do with Brendan Fraser's naked backside, which appears briefly. This is back when both Fraser and a deliciously sensual Ashley Judd's stars both eclipsed that of their co-star, an already well-traveled, but not yet A-list, actor named Viggo Mortensen. (In fact, it was the trifecta of this film, &lt;em>The Prophecy&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>Albino Alligator&lt;/em>, all released in 1995-96, that really propelled Mortensen into the public consciousness in a way he hadn't been previously. Then along came Peter Jackson, and the rest is history.) Because of all the fangirl-worship, I always pushed this one onto the backburner when it came to actually sitting down and checking it out; I shouldn't have.As we open, Darkly Noon (Fraser), the only son of a now-deceased strictly religious couple, regains consciousness in the woods. (Given his injuries, I think we are to assume there was some sort of vehicular accident; we find out later what really went down.) He finds his way to a dirt road and stumbles down it for a while, eventually almost getting hit by Jude (&lt;em>Apollo 13&lt;/em>'s Loren Dean), a delivery guy who's one of the only people from the nearby town who is willing to interact with a couple of local outcasts, Callie (Judd) and her currently-absent boyfriend Clay (Mortensen). Jude drops him there, and Callie nurses him back to health. Darkly has never met anyone quite like Callie, overtly sensual and free-spirited; it doesn't take long before his religious beliefs are butting heads with his attraction to her. This is exacerbated when Clay comes home, and then even further when Darkly, on a walk in the woods, meets Roxy (&lt;em>Twin Peaks&lt;/em>' Grace Zabriskie), who has quite a grudge against Callie...I'm pretty sure Ridley (&lt;em>Heartless&lt;/em>) wanted this movie to feel like a dream, despite the realist nature of the cinematography (nothing is ever in soft focus here, and as Captain Peacock was wont to say, ""thank heaven for &lt;em>that&lt;/em>.""). It's the only way to pass off some of the movie's sillier scenes (more than once I was put in mind of that annoying blowing plastic bag in &lt;em>American Beauty&lt;/em>) and still like it as much as I did. The acting is impeccable all around, the movie is usually well-paced (there are a couple of early scenes that drag like Ashley Judd's shift over her nipples), and the subject matter is just crazy all the way around. Did I mention Lou Myers (&lt;em>A Different World&lt;/em>) doing his best Garrett Morris impersonation as the town's undertaker/ex-preacher? Fun stuff indeed. *** ",4,Worth revisiting.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2769,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Passion', 'Darkly', 'Noon', 'lt', '>', 'Philip', 'Ridley', '1995', 'Ah', '1995', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'swooning', 'movie', 'back', 'day', 'assume', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'naked', 'backside', 'briefly', 'back', 'when', 'Fraser', 'deliciously', 'sensual', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'stars', 'eclipsed', 'co-star', 'already', 'well-traveled', 'not', 'yet', 'A-list', 'actor', 'named', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'fact', 'was', 'trifecta', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'Prophecy', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Albino', 'Alligator', 'lt', '>', 'released', '1995-96', 'really', 'propelled', 'Mortensen', 'public', 'consciousness', 'way', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'previously', 'Then', 'along', 'came', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'rest', 'history', 'fangirl-worship', 'always', 'pushed', 'one', 'backburner', 'when', 'came', 'actually', 'sitting', 'down', 'checking', 'should', ""n't"", 'have.As', 'open', 'Darkly', 'Noon', 'Fraser', 'only', 'son', 'now-deceased', 'strictly', 'religious', 'couple', 'consciousness', 'woods', 'Given', 'injuries', 'think', 'are', 'assume', 'was', 'sort', 'vehicular', 'accident', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'down', 'way', 'dirt', 'road', 'down', 'while', 'eventually', 'almost', 'getting', 'hit', 'Jude', 'lt', '>', 'Apollo', '13', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Loren', 'Dean', 'delivery', 'guy', 'who', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'nearby', 'town', 'who', 'willing', 'interact', 'couple', 'local', 'outcasts', 'Callie', 'Judd', 'currently-absent', 'boyfriend', 'Clay', 'Mortensen', 'Jude', 'there', 'Callie', 'back', 'health', 'Darkly', 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'quite', 'Callie', 'overtly', 'sensual', 'free-spirited', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'butting', 'heads', 'attraction', 'exacerbated', 'when', 'Clay', 'home', 'then', 'even', 'further', 'when', 'Darkly', 'walk', 'woods', 'meets', 'Roxy', 'lt', '>', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'lt', '>', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'who', 'quite', 'grudge', 'Callie', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Ridley', 'lt', '>', 'Heartless', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'wanted', 'movie', 'feel', 'dream', 'realist', 'nature', 'cinematography', 'nothing', 'ever', 'soft', 'focus', 'here', 'Captain', 'Peacock', 'was', 'wont', 'say', 'thank', 'heaven', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'only', 'way', 'pass', 'off', 'movie', 'sillier', 'scenes', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'put', 'mind', 'annoying', 'blowing', 'plastic', 'bag', 'lt', '>', 'American', 'Beauty', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'still', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'around', 'movie', 'usually', 'well-paced', 'are', 'couple', 'early', 'scenes', 'drag', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'shift', 'nipples', 'subject', 'matter', 'just', 'crazy', 'way', 'Did', 'mention', 'Lou', 'Myers', 'lt', '>', 'Different', 'World', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'doing', 'best', 'Garrett', 'Morris', 'impersonation', 'town', 'undertaker/ex-preacher', 'Fun', 'stuff', 'indeed', '***']",Passion of Darkly Noon VHS
409936,A38G64S5VMRI1P,6304256868,Robert Graves,"[2, 5]","The Passion of Darkly Noon is a strange, mesmerizing film that you can't help but get sucked into when you turn it on. It stars Brendan Frasier, Ashley Judd and an early role from Aragorn - Viggo Mortensen, sporting the same scruff and locks as he did in LOTR. The film is permeated with bizarre imagery, very much dream-like, as another review noted.To me the film deals with the repression of feelings. Darkly Noon, the Brendan Frasier lead, was raised in a cultish Christian community which was pillaged by nearby townsfolk - they killed all of the cult, leaving only Darkly Noon alive. He finds his way onto Ashley and Viggo's ranch where they invite him to stay.From here we see Darkly try to express his sexual feelings for Ashley, feelings which he was never allowed to express as a normal boy developing into a man, and he expresses them in the most horrific ways. The only way he knows how to appropriate his new feelings of lust is by hurting himself - using barbed wire, glass, etc. - and eventually others. It's a powerful statement that feelings left unexpressed (or rather, disallowed to express) will still evince themselves in one way or another, sometimes in very bad ways.We also learn that Brendan Frasier is a great actor and it's unfortunate he always chooses roles like Dudley Dooright and George of the Jungle.

409938,APDPA11IZPYLN,6304256868,"Sheila Chilcote-Collins ""Sheila Renee Chilcot...","[5, 6]","Written and directed by little-known, Phillip Ridley (The Reflecting Skin), 1995's &quot;The Passion Of Darkly Noon&quot; is an almost ethereal Grimm's twisted fairy-tale that turns quicky into spiraling jealousy, self-mutilation, pyschosis and death.A confused young man, Darkly Noon (Brendan Fraser) stumbles into a forest clearing and is picked up off the road and taken to a farmhouse inhabited by a mute carpenter, Clay (ViggoMortensen) and his beautiful but very hirsute lover, Callie (a Clorox blonde, hairy armpitted, scantily dressed and very sweaty, Ashley Judd).We discover that Darkly has fled from a strict religious commune/cult which has been ransacked by local rednecks who have shot and killed his parents.While Clay is away, Callie will play and so, Callie decides to &quot;take in&quot; Darkly as one of the family.  Darkly lives in the loft of the barn, spies on Callie, lusts after Callie and after Darkly does some &quot;spanking the monkey&quot; in the hayloft while watching her, he is just about to make his move when Clay arrives back home.  Darkly is immediately enraged with passion, lust, jealousy and most with religious contempt and righteous indignation!  He inflicts pain upon himself, has visions in the woods, and finally has a religious experience that leads him to some &quot;very un-Christianlike&quot; behavior to say the least, smiting everyone in his path.This film is not for everyone. Even fans of Frazer and Mortensen won't approve because they both play roles that are far from their normal typecasting.  Although everyone turns in decent performances some viewers might be disappointed.  But hey!  If you like Ashley Judd, barbed wire and hairy armpits this will be right up your alley!Happy Watching!",4,Ridley's Surreal Film Plus The Hairy Armpits Of Ashley Judd!,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,1747,"['Written', 'directed', 'little-known', 'Phillip', 'Ridley', 'Reflecting', 'Skin', '1995', 'quot', 'Passion', 'Darkly', 'Noon', 'quot', 'almost', 'ethereal', 'Grimm', 'twisted', 'fairy-tale', 'quicky', 'spiraling', 'jealousy', 'self-mutilation', 'pyschosis', 'death.A', 'confused', 'young', 'man', 'Darkly', 'Noon', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'forest', 'clearing', 'picked', 'up', 'road', 'taken', 'farmhouse', 'inhabited', 'mute', 'carpenter', 'Clay', 'ViggoMortensen', 'beautiful', 'very', 'hirsute', 'lover', 'Callie', 'Clorox', 'blonde', 'hairy', 'armpitted', 'scantily', 'dressed', 'very', 'sweaty', 'Ashley', 'Judd', '.We', 'discover', 'Darkly', 'fled', 'strict', 'religious', 'commune/cult', 'been', 'ransacked', 'local', 'rednecks', 'who', 'have', 'shot', 'killed', 'parents.While', 'Clay', 'away', 'Callie', 'will', 'play', 'so', 'Callie', 'quot', 'take', 'quot', 'Darkly', 'one', 'family', 'Darkly', 'loft', 'barn', 'spies', 'Callie', 'Callie', 'Darkly', 'quot', 'spanking', 'monkey', 'quot', 'hayloft', 'watching', 'just', 'make', 'move', 'when', 'Clay', 'back', 'home', 'Darkly', 'immediately', 'enraged', 'passion', 'lust', 'jealousy', 'most', 'religious', 'contempt', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'pain', 'visions', 'woods', 'finally', 'religious', 'experience', 'quot', 'very', 'un-Christianlike', 'quot', 'behavior', 'say', 'least', 'smiting', 'everyone', 'path.This', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'Even', 'fans', 'Frazer', 'Mortensen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'approve', 'play', 'roles', 'are', 'far', 'normal', 'typecasting', 'everyone', 'decent', 'performances', 'viewers', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'hey', 'like', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'barbed', 'wire', 'hairy', 'armpits', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'Happy', 'Watching']",Passion of Darkly Noon VHS

It's well acted and fairly dark, and the rap up after the climax of the movie was odd but not annoying in a big let down kind of way. It is definetely worth watching especially to break the chain of predictable and pop culture kinds of movies. The overall construction of the movie is certainly different but that's part of what makes it enjoyable. It does take an extreme look at repression but also it runs through many plot possibilities to wonder about. The actions aren't as much of the story as the things underneath the dialogue and setting, the things that they don't show. That is where a lot of the story and interest really is. It less like a novel based script and more like a long short story based one. But as worthwhile as this movie is, I definetely would say it wouldn't be on most people's favorites to re-watch list. You may watch it twice or even three times but I doubt It's one you'd want to have in stock for a rainy day. Not a must have. So Rent it first!
