It's mildly engaging but slight entertainment.  DeNiro seems to be sleepwalking through his role of nerdy cop.  Bill Murray does not really stretch himself in the gangster role.  We only view him as a menacing presence because the story tells us so.  Uma Thurman is adequate in her role of DeNiro's prize for saving Murray's life, but there is nothing here to suggest the range that she showed in later work.

337469,A102ZVRQ4ZTX5Q,6302814308,"""dose2000""","[9, 13]","1st off let me say I have alot of trouble with the reviewer whomsaid that &quot;Cape Fear&quot; &quot;really hurt DeNiro's career.&quot;To me nothing could be further from the truth! I also disagreedvehemently with the 'professional critics' whom said things aboutDeNiro's performance in &quot;Cape Fear&quot; like the one whom said DeNiro's performance was &quot;overboard&quot; &amp; that, &quot;He was chewing theprop scenery, up, with his over the top performance.&quot;This is ridiculous, and DeNiro's performance as the unstopableMax Cady, to me is one of his finest performances! But to the review:I always thought &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; was a great film &amp; a great vechicle for the great DeNiro...&amp; a superb performance!What a novel idea to switch roles from DeNiro's 'always'(seemingly)playing the hated bad guy, &amp; allowing him to play a somewhat cowardly policeman, &amp; to have thesimilarly always used for comedy, Bill Murray play the underworld figure!DeNiro's work as that other than a 'tough guy' or 'mobster' was always dismissed by 'critics' &amp; film goer's until his roles in films  &quot;Meet The Parents&quot; or &quot;Analyze This&quot;. I knew DeNiro could play ANY role in a great way ever since I saw the early film &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot;(where DeNiro plays a sickly southernboy baseball catcher)or an even earlier film that 'apparently&quot; NOONE else saw, &quot;The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight&quot;, a low budget film based on the Jimmy Breslin novel, that DeNiro actually saves!!The plot of &quot;Mad Dog &amp; Glory&quot; is a solid one, and gets2 fineactors(DeNiro &amp; Murray)to play roles the viewer's are unacustomedto seeing them in! I thought DeNiro's Mad Dog was brilliant, as was Murray's 'gangster! Also, Ms. Thruman's role is very good as is that of David Caruso(who's career has really been mostly in the tank after he left &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, a curse that seems to followeveryone that leaves!(Just look at Kim Delaney-Nick Tuturro-Jimmy Smits, to name a few!) Caruso's part of the tough as nailspartner to Mad Dog is 1 of his best!This is another of my many favorite films by Mr. DeNiro, and there are ALOT of them out there. Unfortunately DeNiro, much like his friend &amp; cohort director Martin Scorsese,often have had their great performances &amp; directorial jobs, slighted by thesnobbish &quot;Academy Award&quot; people! That's not that big a deal because this is usually offset by both winning awards from either the Cann Film Festival, or NY &amp; L.A. film critics awardsalong with others!If you love a good story, &amp; fine acting check out &quot;Mad Dog &amp; Glory&quot; it's a film worthy of praise. I'd give you my list of other great film performances by DeNiro, &amp; films by Scorsese, but we be here all day!

337472,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,6302814308,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[2, 10]","Dont let the catchy title and blockbuster cast of robert deniro, uma thurman, and bill murray fool you, this is a bad movie from 1993. yes despite this talent of stars, the movie is a big let down for fans of deniro's and thurmans. however bill murray gives perhaps one of his comedic/dramatic performances ever. in fact not surprising  as far deniro goes though, his performance is bloody awful. some people say an actor acts ""effortlessly"" when he gives a good performance, however in deniro's case that seems to be opposite as their is hardly any acting all. however, this stems from the fact that most of the characters in mad dog and glory are utterly weak and pathetic, with the exception of murray.In fact i still found the movie hard to watch despite murray's performance. the plot of the movie is that bumbling cop (deniro) name mad dog doobie stumbles onto a robbery in progress. he sees a man holding up a liquor store with a tall man (murray) as the hostage. murray's character is a riot, telling mad dog to blow away the sucker like dirty harry.Mad dog doesn't and the assailant escapes, though i believe he is captured later on though that isn't relevant here.Murray's character as we learn is a top and tough mafia boss named frank milo. milo is quite a character almost larger than life, he demands respect and if you cross him your dead.milo though loves mad dog as he has just saved his life in this holdup. milo knowing that mad dog is a cop (although not a good one) offers his services as a mafia boss to mad dog.Dobie refuses using one of the few morals he has, however milo comes up with another proposition, he wants to be dobie's ""friend"". lol in fact he wont take no for an answer.dobie accepts for the mean time, not seeing any harm in that.Milo eventually introduces the lame brain cop to his new girl ""Glory"" (Uma Thurman) an attractive woman who we learn is Milo's main squeeze, however better put, she is a prostitute, she is one of many objects that Milo owns"".When Dobie sees Glory and Milo offers ""Glory's"" services (i.e sex). Dobie refuses. It seems this cop actually lives up to his mom of being clean unlike other corrupt cops or is he?(Some possible spoilers)Well not exactly, despite Dobie's claim that he is a good cop and he is sworn to upload the law, he breaks his own rules and laws and decides to ""borrow"" Glory. When he is through with the companionship, he agrees to give her up.Trouble is he doesn't. When Milo comes looking for Glory an altercation erupts that basically sets up the conflict and what happens in the rest of the movie. Milo wants Glory back at any price. He is willing do anything including messing up Dobie's life to do it.I actually made that sound more interesting that it really is. ""Mad Dog and Glory"" is essentially a part black comedy and part dramatic film. Problem is I wasn't really in the areas I should of probably because of the set of repugnant characters on screen no matter how dysfunctional and stupid they are.A cop who despite his own morals decides to break them when it suits em, doesnt obviously appeal to me or audience. Glorys character despite being the ""victim"" of sorts doesn't always come out. In a couple of scenarios her reactions dont have the reactions that a victim would have.However as far as performances go I definitely think Uma Thurman did a much better job and any good critic could see that as her character is much more complex that Deniro's.A woman whose caught in the middle of the bad situation and whose life depends on what she'll do next is pretty interesting. However the Glory character despite isn't as well developed as that. She gives in too easily to intimidation and greed instead of firmly making a decision one way or other.Now the Milo character (Bill Murray) is great, in fact this character is hilarious as hell, despite his presence of being a Mafia boss, who can kill anyone at will and get away with it, hes extremely funny and clever. During one point, he fools the donut eating precint where Dobie works into thinking that he is a ""baker"" and that he is an old friend of Dobie's. LOL During other instances, he sends it goons to do his dirty work against Mad Dog in such a vile pathetic way that it's almost a joke. Murray is great as this character, for his performance the movie is worth watching.However again, ""Mad Dog and Glory:"" is still a heavily flawed film, you kinda what your gonna get in the film and Deniro's utterly, weak, spineless and hypocritical character almost leave you feeling dry and bitter by the end of the film. Hell you want this character to die by the end of the film. It's awful, one of a long string of weak characters that Deniro would play in the 1990's up until ""Analyze This"".The movie was directed by John McNaugton if you never of him that's because he's not that good. Hes made a dozen or so films however only really two stand out in my mind ""Wild Things"" (1998) and ""Henry Portrait of A Serial Killer"" (1986) with Michael Rooker which is by far the scariest and best movie about serial killers in general (forget about that trash called ""Monster"" with Charlize Theron) this movie is the real thing.Uma Thurman of course is hot , she's sizzling ever since she and Quentin Tarantino, did ""Kill Bill"" everyone seems to be hopping on the Uma Thurman bandwagon, yet a couple of years they were writing her of after she a couple of flops like ""The Avengers"".

337473,AIOXMENE1HBR7,6302814308,GreatMovieCriticRobertfromUS,"[0, 6]","""mad dog and glory"" don't let the catchy title and blockbuster cast of robert deniro, uma thurman, and bill murray fool you, this is a bad movie from 1993. yes despite this talent of stars, the movie is a big let down for fans of deniro's and thurmans. however bill murray gives perhaps one of his comedic/dramatic performances ever. in fact not surprisingas far deniro goes though, his performance is bloody awful. some people say an actor acts ""effortlessly"" when he gives a good performance, however in deniro's case that seems to be opposite as their is hardly any acting all. however, this stems from the fact that most of the characters in mad dog and glory are utterly weak and pathetic, with the exception of murray.In fact i still found the movie hard to watch despite murray's performance. the plot of the movie is that bumbling cop (deniro) name mad dog doobie stumbles onto a robbery in progress. he sees a man holding up a liquor store with a tall man (murray) as the hostage. murray's character is a riot, telling mad dog to blow away the sucker like dirty harry.Mad dog doesn't and the assailant escapes, though i believe he is captured later on though that isn't relevant here.Murray's character as we learn is a top and tough mafia boss named frank milo. milo is quite a character almost larger than life, he demands respect and if you cross him your dead.milo though loves mad dog as he has just saved his life in this holdup. milo knowing that mad dog is a cop (although not a good one) offers his services as a mafia boss to mad dog.Dobie refuses using one of the few morals he has, however milo comes up with another proposition, he wants to be dobie's ""friend"". lol in fact he wont take no for an answer.dobie accepts for the mean time, not seeing any harm in that.Milo eventually introduces the lame brain cop to his new girl ""Glory"" (Uma Thurman) an attractive woman who we learn is Milo's main squeeze, however better put, she is a prostitute, she is one of many objects that Milo owns"".When Dobie sees Glory and Milo offers ""Glory's"" services (i.e sex). Dobie refuses. It seems this cop actually lives up to his mom of being clean unlike other corrupt cops or is he?(Some possible spoilers)Well not exactly, despite Dobie's claim that he is a good cop and he is sworn to upload the law, he breaks his own rules and laws and decides to ""borrow"" Glory. When he is through with the companionship, he agrees to give her up.Trouble is he doesn't. When Milo comes looking for Glory an altercation erupts that basically sets up the conflict and what happens in the rest of the movie. Milo wants Glory back at any price. He is willing do anything including messing up Dobie's life to do it.I actually made that sound more interesting that it really is. ""Mad Dog and Glory"" is essentially a part black comedy and part dramatic film. Problem is I wasn't really in the areas I should of probably because of the set of repugnant characters on screen no matter how dysfunctional and stupid they are.A cop who despite his own morals decides to break them when it suits em, doesnt obviously appeal to me or audience. Glorys character despite being the ""victim"" of sorts doesn't always come out. In a couple of scenarios her reactions dont have the reactions that a victim would have.However as far as performances go I definitely think Uma Thurman did a much better job and any good critic could see that as her character is much more complex that Deniro's.A woman whose caught in the middle of the bad situation and whose life depends on what she'll do next is pretty interesting. However the Glory character despite isn't as well developed as that. She gives in too easily to intimidation and greed instead of firmly making a decision one way or other.Now the Milo character (Bill Murray) is great, in fact this character is hilarious as hell, despite his presence of being a Mafia boss, who can kill anyone at will and get away with it, hes extremely funny and clever. During one point, he fools the donut eating precint where Dobie works into thinking that he is a ""baker"" and that he is an old friend of Dobie's. LOL During other instances, he sends it goons to do his dirty work against Mad Dog in such a vile pathetic way that it's almost a joke. Murray is great as this character, for his performance the movie is worth watching.However again, ""Mad Dog and Glory:"" is still a heavily flawed film, you kinda what your gonna get in the film and Deniro's utterly, weak, spineless and hypocritical character almost leave you feeling dry and bitter by the end of the film. Hell you want this character to die by the end of the film. It's awful, one of a long string of weak characters that Deniro would play in the 1990's up until ""Analyze This"".The movie was directed by John McNaugton if you never of him that's because he's not that good. Hes made a dozen or so films however only really two stand out in my mind ""Wild Things"" (1998) and ""Henry Portrait of A Serial Killer"" (1986) with Michael Rooker which is by far the scariest and best movie about serial killers in general (forget about that trash called ""Monster"" with Charlize Theron) this movie is the real thing.Uma Thurman of course is hot , she's sizzling ever since she and Quentin Tarantino, did ""Kill Bill"" everyone seems to be hopping on the Uma Thurman bandwagon, yet a couple of years they were writing her of after she a couple of flops like ""The Avengers"".

337476,AEWNMBHW42GGE,6302814308,John R. Bridell,"[1, 9]","MAD DOG AND GLORY rather proves that Oscars--two for De Niro- can carry a movie a long way. Robert De Niro demonstrates how well he needed to act in a movie that never got out of the gate.  At least De Niro was cast well as a police photographer.  He played that role truthfully and effectively.  However, the thesis that De Niro saved the life of Bill Murry, allegedly feared gangster, fell flat on its' face as I saw the action. I did not see De Niro save Murray's life. De Niro bantered some conversation with a holdup man who held a gun on Murray. The robber finally ran out of nasty things to say and  fled in a panic. Well, after this the story was alternatively slow and boring, or the action was incredulous. I was enticed to see the film because of its' twist; the mobster giving the cop Uma Thurman as a friend? housekeeper? playmate? cultural companion? for a week.Uma wasn't sure why she was a gift leaving her no alternative except to jump into the sack with De Niro. From that point of action the movie took off with the speed of a snail. We see several altercations that have little relationship to the plot. In all the plot was juvenile and the dialogue was juvenile. Bill Murray, miscast as a gangster,needed about 20 more years of practice before he could have perfected the role.",2,Oscars can carry a movie a long way,1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,1298,"['MAD', 'DOG', 'AND', 'GLORY', 'rather', 'Oscars', 'two', 'De', 'Niro-', 'can', 'carry', 'movie', 'long', 'way', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'how', 'well', 'needed', 'act', 'movie', 'never', 'got', 'gate', 'least', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'cast', 'well', 'police', 'photographer', 'played', 'role', 'truthfully', 'effectively', 'However', 'thesis', 'De', 'Niro', 'saved', 'life', 'Bill', 'Murry', 'allegedly', 'feared', 'gangster', 'fell', 'flat', 'face', 'saw', 'action', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'De', 'Niro', 'save', 'Murray', 'life', 'De', 'Niro', 'bantered', 'conversation', 'holdup', 'man', 'who', 'held', 'gun', 'Murray', 'robber', 'finally', 'ran', 'nasty', 'things', 'say', 'fled', 'panic', 'Well', 'story', 'was', 'alternatively', 'slow', 'boring', 'action', 'was', 'incredulous', 'was', 'enticed', 'see', 'film', 'twist', 'mobster', 'giving', 'cop', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'friend', 'housekeeper', 'playmate', 'cultural', 'companion', 'week.Uma', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'gift', 'leaving', 'alternative', 'jump', 'sack', 'De', 'Niro', 'point', 'action', 'movie', 'took', 'off', 'speed', 'snail', 'see', 'several', 'altercations', 'have', 'little', 'relationship', 'plot', 'plot', 'was', 'juvenile', 'dialogue', 'was', 'juvenile', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'miscast', 'gangster', 'needed', '20', 'more', 'years', 'practice', 'could', 'have', 'perfected', 'role']",N/A
337477,A2YQ5O6XV23543,6302814308,Kevin H. Dudley,"[18, 18]","The opening scene of director John McNaughton's 1993 low-key-comedy Mad Dog and Glory is quite deceiving. We witness some kind of a drug deal happening in a car, followed by one of the guys getting a bullet in the head spraying his brains all over the passenger side window.I immediately double-checked the DVD box to make sure this was listed as a comedy. But I stuck with the movie and that opening scene really doesn't have much to do with the overall plot and instead serves as an introduction to the main character, a police photographer named Wayne ""Mad Dog"" Dobie (played in brilliantly understated fashion by Robert DeNiro).The movie is quite funny at times, and is very low key and relaxed in its pacing. The film doesn't boast what I would call a ton of laugh-out loud moments, but it has a gentle and relaxed sense of humor that is natural and quite refreshing in this day and age of in-your-face gross out comedies.The film involves Wayne (or Mad Dog as he's called by his friends/co-workers), who is a police photographer who really would like to be a true artist someday instead of a policeman. While in a seedy convenience store one night, he ends up saving mob boss Frank Milo's (Bill Murray) life when a thug holds up the store and almost shoots Frank.Frank says that he will show his appreciation for what Mad Dog did for him, and ends up inviting him to Frank's club that he runs as sort of a cover for his mob organization. While in the club, Mad Dog meets the beautiful waitress Glory (a radiant Uma Thurman), who accidentally spills scalding hot coffee on Mad Dog's hand. Disgusted by her clumsiness, Frank scolds her in front of Mad Dog and says that he'll make it up to him in the near future. His way of doing that is by sending Glory to stay with Mad Dog for a week as sort of a present (since Mad Dog is a pretty lonely guy). Glory is a naive woman who has ended up being in some sort of debt to Frank, as he sort of ""owns"" her. She immediately makes it known to Mad Dog that she's not a prostitute, but instead wants to just be good company for him. Mad Dog ends up falling madly in love with her, as she does with him, and when the week is up he refuses to let Glory go back to Frank. Things get interesting when Frank comes looking to get her back in a most laid back and hilarious fashion. (Bill Murray is brilliant.)What I found most interesting about this movie is that it's a unique mixture of styles. While there are some elements of a love story, the romantic aspect isn't played up nearly as much as it could have been. The movie also has some surprising outbursts of violence that strike a perfect balance between being intense and extremely funny. One interesting thing, is that other than Frank's club, we don't see him in action that much, but instead we hear about stuff that he's doing and/or done in the past. The story about why Glory is in debt to him is actually quite chilling. The movie has a quirky feel to it that was refreshing and genuinely entertaining. I was constantly not sure about what was going to happen next. There is one fairly strong sex scene between Uma and DeNiro, but it fits in with the story and actually has a point in the overall proceedings.I particularly liked the scenes in which Mad Dog is trying to keep secret from his co-workers the fact that he's accidentally befriended a mob boss and was given Glory as a ""present"" from Frank.The whole cast does superb work. Robert DeNiro and Bill Murray play their characters in hilarious understated fashion. Uma Thurman manages to come across as naive, sexy and extremely sweet and really gives the character of Glory a lot of depth and substance. People who seem to always unjustly write Uma off as not being able to act would do well to check out her nuanced performance in this film. One of the funniest characters in the movie though is David Caruso (ex. NYPD Blue) as Mad Dog's best friend and overzealous co-worker. His fist fight with one of Frank's goons in Mad Dog's apartment near the end of the movie is one of the comic highlights of the film.The film has a very laid back feel to it. Nothing is rushed and scenes are given as much time as they need to expand. There were a few instances near the beginning where I thought that the film felt just a tiny bit lethargic, but it wasn't nothing that greatly diminished my enjoyment of the movie.Director John McNaughton brings a light, but gritty touch to the proceedings and manages to make a couple of shifts in tone smooth and not jarring. Compare this movie to some of his other films like underrated Wild Things and the infamous Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and it's really quite striking how he managed to bring a proper light touch to the script. He really shows how deep his directorial talents can go.This is one of those little, unheard-of films that entered and exited theaters without hardly a sound back in 1993. It's truly an underrated gem that is worth checking out especially to see the wonderful ensemble acting by the entire cast. If it's a really quick, snappy in-your-face comedy that you're wanting to see, Mad Dog and Glory will disappoint. But if you're wanting to check out a realistic, refreshingly low-key and original comedy that will keep a steady smile on your face throughout (after you get through the violent beginning), than I highly recommend this film.Mad Dog and Glory is rated R and contains sexual content, nudity, violence and strong language.",5,"Unique, funny and refreshingly low-key.",1130889600,"11 2,

337479,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302814308,Reviewer,"[5, 10]","This is one of those films that pretty much defies genre or category, inasmuch as it falls into any and all from which you may want to choose.  So pick a label and stick it on; whichever you decide upon will work, because ""Mad Dog and Glory,"" directed by John McNaughton, is going to be received and interpreted differently by all who see it, and that determination will be directly derived from personal experience and frame of reference.  There are those who will find this film hilarious, while others will see it as a somewhat disconcerting drama, and it's all subjective; there is no right or wrong to it.  And in the end, it really won't make any difference, as this is decidedly not a film to compel one toward contemplation once it's over, and for the simple reason that this is basically a character study of characters it's hard to care about.  Which pretty much negates any ""mulling over"" one typically may be wont to engage upon following a film.  Suffice to say, this one's a mixed bag; it definitely has it's moments (of course, that's a ""given""-- this is, after all, a ""De Niro,"") and it's entertaining to a point.  But in the final analysis, once the screen goes dark, there isn't much about it you're apt to remember once the sun and moon have changed places overhead.Wayne Dobie (Robert De Niro) is a veteran Chicago P.D. detective, but be advised, he is no ""Dirty Harry.""  His specialty is taking photographs of crime scenes, and he has not, in fact, drawn his gun in fifteen years.  His life is mundane, he lives alone and he is satisfied if not content with his chosen career.  He's a clean cop who lives a clean life and makes the most of what he has.  But virtually overnight all of that changes when Wayne inadvertently does a solid for a guy named Frank Milo (Bill Murray).Milo is a small time hood, a loan shark, who fancies himself a ""mob boss,"" and though he has achieved some success in his ""field,"" he suffers from delusions of grandeur that have made him more of a legend in his own mind than anything else.  And he manifests that fantasy by having box seats for Sox games and owning his own comedy club where he features himself doing stand-up:  Frank Milo, gangster/comedian.  And when he finds himself indebted to Wayne, he tells him through the largess of his ego that he can be the ""expediter of your dreams,"" and proceeds to send his new detective friend a ""present.""  It's a gift, however, that puts Wayne in something of a compromising position.  Frank Milo, though, is not a man to take ""no"" for an answer.  So for Wayne, a guy just trying to get on with his life, it's a dilemma; and because of the peculiar circumstances involved, it's one to which there is no easy solution.  Still, it's not going to go away on it's own, so Wayne is going to have to figure it out.  And soon.Director McNaughton was obviously challenged by this screenplay by Richard Price, and like his main character, Wayne, it apparently became something of a dilemma for him.  In his defense, it must be said that it's understandable, as this is an example of a high concept idea that looks good on paper, but needs some real vision to successfully translate it to the screen.  And that's where McNaughton comes up short.  He just couldn't find the hook, that special something that would've made it all jell, and quite frankly, except for the actors involved, this one would've had a shelf life of about a minute-and-a-half.  While the outcome of the whole business isn't necessarily predictable (right down to the wire there's a couple of ways it can go), much of what happens is inevitable, like the showdown between Wayne and Milo.  Getting there, meanwhile, is a journey nearly as boring as Wayne's life.One of the premiere actors in the history of the cinema, Robert De Niro has the ability to get into a character's skin like no one else, and his portrayal of Wayne is certainly no exception.  That De Niro can add nuance to such a nondescript character is a true affirmation of his talent.  Wayne is something of a study in contradiction; on a deeper level, he's an extremely conflicted individual-- he has the heart of an artist, but his primary need is the security his job as a cop affords him.  All of which De Niro conveys impeccably.  Still, there's nothing unusual about Wayne or his situation.  Take a poll of the people of the world and you'll find that MOST of them want to be one thing, but make their living doing something else.  Add to that the fact that, while Wayne is likable enough, there's nothing about him that's going to evoke much empathy or make you sympathize with him.  In the grand scheme of things, his problems are simply too insignificant to get worked up about.  And it must be noted that it points up what a brilliant performance this is from De Niro; his Wayne is exactly who he's supposed to be, and it's hard to be interested in a guy who is basically uninteresting and common.As for Murray, playing Milo stone-faced and straight cannot alter the fact that Murray is an intrinsically funny guy.  Initially, casting him in this role seems almost inspired, and he gives a good enough performance; but this character hangs on him like a bad suit.  He has his moments, but the bottom line is, if it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit, and the best tailor in the world couldn't have helped him.In supporting roles, there are some noteworthy performances turned in by David Caruso (Mike), Uma Thurman (Glory), Mike Starr (Harold) and Kathy Baker (Lee), but it's not enough to make ""Mad Dog and Glory"" memorable cinema.",3,Less Than Riveting
