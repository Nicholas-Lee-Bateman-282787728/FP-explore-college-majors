It is outlandish and has it's moments a story of David and Goliath with the Greens and Grains vs the giant Super Value Mart. The cast worked well together and it shows every episode is filled with great content almost like a live action South Park there is nothing sacred with the comedy. From a water stain of Jesus to ever constant sexual tension. I would recommend this show to anyone 18 and over not for the children, but if you work in the grocery industry you will appreciate this great comedy.",4,Funny off beat Comedy!,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,583,"['Being', 'grocery', 'business', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'found', 'quite', 'funny', 'outlandish', 'moments', 'story', 'David', 'Goliath', 'Greens', 'Grains', 'vs', 'giant', 'Super', 'Value', 'Mart', 'cast', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'episode', 'filled', 'great', 'content', 'almost', 'live', 'action', 'South', 'Park', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'comedy', 'water', 'stain', 'Jesus', 'ever', 'constant', 'sexual', 'tension', 'would', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', '18', 'not', 'children', 'work', 'grocery', 'industry', 'will', 'appreciate', 'great', 'comedy']",10 Items or Less - Seasons 1 & 2

I don't get cable television, so I'm not on a first run basis with many of the shows that are not on basic cable. In my opinion, I'm not missing much, but 10 Items or Less is exceptional. If you like The Office, you're probably going to like, if not love, 10 Items or Less. If you like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, you're probably going to like, if not love, 10 Items or Less. If you feel like The Office has lost its spark, that the relationships between the characters are no longer believable, or that the characters themselves have become unlikable, then 10 Items or Less is good for what ails you. If you think that It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has turned its main characters into psychopaths that you are no longer laughing with, but wondering why they're not in prison, then 10 Items or Less will give you flawed, yes; deluded, yes, but nonetheless a cast of characters that are as endearing as they are funny.

I bought this on an Amazon impulse spree, and do not regret it in the least.  Painfully funny at times, and intelligently stupid (think of a lighter/less cynical sibling to The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm, ... paced more in line with Arrested Development, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), the series should easily make it onto non-laugh track comedy lovers' lists.",5,"Definite ""Brilliant but Cancelled"" candidate",1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,460,"['many', 'had', 'heard', 'show', 'had', 'not', 'caught', 'episodes', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'impulse', 'spree', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'least', 'Painfully', 'funny', 'times', 'intelligently', 'stupid', 'think', 'lighter/less', 'cynical', 'sibling', 'Office', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'paced', 'more', 'line', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'series', 'should', 'easily', 'make', 'non-laugh', 'track', 'comedy', 'lovers', 'lists']",10 Items or Less - Seasons 1 & 2
1153256,A3MS0KUOYHIQK4,B0016BWAE6,Mint910,"[8, 8]","Ok, this show is HILARIOUS! I never used to like sitcoms but now they are some of my favorite shows and this one is no exception. About 95% of the show takes place in a grocery store between the employees and manager. I don't know what to say besides it's really funny!This program is really original for a few reasons. According to the special features all the dialogue is improvised. The plot isn't but the dialogue is! And it's hilarious! Also, when the actors came in to audition for the show they didn't really know what it was, some of them assumed it was a reality show. So they walk in and are handed a job application for a grocery store to fill out, and turns out that's how their characters were created, off of that job application!I loved all the characters and actors they all bring something hilarious to the show. From the overly friendly but sort of unrealistic manager, to the awkward stock boy, to the manager of the rival big box grocery store. These people riff off each other so well!The seasons are very short, each fitting on one dvd packaged together for purchase.

Anyone that worked retail will get a kick out of this and I think it is appealing to the masses. It definitely stays in my personal collection. I put it away for a year and laugh again .
