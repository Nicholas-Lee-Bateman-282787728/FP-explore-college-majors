The adversaries Segal faces in this are possibly the best portrayed of any of his films.Under Siege is as high action as many Segal movies but doesn't manage to intertwine the personal dynamics as well as some movies however that's more than redeemed in Fire Down Below where community adversity comes to the fore in a movie that finds itself in environmental injustice and corruption in the legal system. The minister is particularly well played in this as is the beekeeper.Above the Law is another play of government corruption which is a regular undercurrent in Segal movies. This time its focused around the CIA and rouge internal operations - it's a good movie if you want to think about who watches the watchers.As a group they all are better than average movies from the standpoint of sets, storyline, acting and composition.If you enjoy action movies or Segal in particular its very unlikely you will be disappointed.At the price point it's hard to fault this set, delivered quickly and as ordered.",4,Standard Segal - good entertainment for the price,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,1194,"['DVD', 'set', 'four', 'movies', 'cover', 'period', 'could', 'be', 'Segal', 'best.The', 'Glimmer', 'Man', 'possibly', 'best', 'group', 'nice', 'action', 'also', 'good', 'interpersonal', 'dynamics', 'adversaries', 'Segal', 'are', 'possibly', 'best', 'portrayed', 'films.Under', 'Siege', 'as', 'high', 'action', 'many', 'Segal', 'movies', ""n't"", 'manage', 'intertwine', 'personal', 'dynamics', 'as', 'well', 'movies', 'however', 'more', 'redeemed', 'Fire', 'Down', 'Below', 'where', 'community', 'adversity', 'fore', 'movie', 'environmental', 'injustice', 'corruption', 'legal', 'system', 'minister', 'particularly', 'well', 'played', 'beekeeper.Above', 'Law', 'play', 'government', 'corruption', 'regular', 'undercurrent', 'Segal', 'movies', 'time', 'focused', 'CIA', 'rouge', 'internal', 'operations', 'good', 'movie', 'want', 'think', 'who', 'watches', 'watchers.As', 'group', 'are', 'better', 'average', 'movies', 'standpoint', 'sets', 'storyline', 'acting', 'composition.If', 'enjoy', 'action', 'movies', 'Segal', 'particular', 'very', 'unlikely', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.At', 'price', 'point', 'hard', 'fault', 'set', 'delivered', 'quickly', 'as', 'ordered']","4 Film Favorites: Steven Seagal (Above the Law, Fire Down Below, The Glimmer Man, Under Siege)"

In addition, they are both among his most acclaimed pictures (as a matter of fact, they're practically the only ones that weren't trashed by critics).""The Glimmer Man"" and ""Fire Down Below"", however, are a completely different matter: they're the last films that Seagal starred in before his contract with Warner Bros. ended, and are among the most critically-maligned features of his pre-DTV career.Since this is a representative package, I wonder what the latter two films are doing in this collection; seeing as the discs were compiled by Warner Bros., I can't understand why ""Hard To Kill"", ""On Deadly Ground"", or ""Under Siege 2"" weren't chosen from the WB library to complete the set, since those films are generally recognized as better Seagal-starring pictures.In addition, the special features of all of the films are limited: theatrical trailers and production notes are included, but no interviews, behind-the-scenes featurettes, or commentaries are afforded to this album.What we have here are the barest of essentials: two great Seagal films, two so-so ones, and that's it. While any Seagal is better than none, an alternative box-set also released by WB featuring ""Under Siege"", Under Siege 2"", ""Above The Law"", and ""Hard To Kill"" beats this collection out on anything except price.",3,"Seagal Is Good, Selection Not So",1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,1691,"['Being', 'fan', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'not', 'nature', 'disregard', 'something', 'as', 'impassive', 'collection', 'films', '4-movie', '2-disc', 'compilation', ""'m"", 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Siege', 'Law', 'are', 'necessities', 'Seagal', 'assortment', 'Siege', 'highest-earning', 'film', 'feature', 'best-known', 'Law', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'addition', 'are', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'pictures', 'matter', 'fact', ""'re"", 'practically', 'only', 'ones', 'were', ""n't"", 'trashed', 'critics', 'Glimmer', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Down', 'Below', 'however', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'matter', ""'re"", 'last', 'films', 'Seagal', 'starred', 'contract', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'ended', 'are', 'most', 'critically-maligned', 'features', 'pre-DTV', 'career.Since', 'representative', 'package', 'wonder', 'what', 'latter', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'doing', 'collection', 'seeing', 'discs', 'were', 'compiled', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Hard', 'Kill', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'Siege', '2', 'were', ""n't"", 'chosen', 'WB', 'library', 'complete', 'set', 'films', 'are', 'generally', 'recognized', 'better', 'Seagal-starring', 'pictures.In', 'addition', 'special', 'features', 'films', 'are', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'production', 'notes', 'are', 'included', 'interviews', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'commentaries', 'are', 'afforded', 'have', 'here', 'are', 'barest', 'essentials', 'two', 'great', 'Seagal', 'films', 'two', 'so-so', 'ones', 'Seagal', 'better', 'none', 'alternative', 'box-set', 'also', 'released', 'WB', 'featuring', 'Siege', 'Siege', '2', 'Law', 'Hard', 'Kill', 'collection', 'out', 'anything', 'price']","4 Film Favorites: Steven Seagal (Above the Law, Fire Down Below, The Glimmer Man, Under Siege)"

1093329,A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP,B000U1ZV6C,"Sebastian Sanjurjo ""mr.movie expert""","[6, 7]","This DVD bundle includes 4 of Segal's best movies. They are the same transfers from the crappy early Warner DVD's. Though, at least here you get them cheaper. It brings Under Siege on one side, you flip the DVD and you have Glimmer Man on the other side of the disc. On the second disc you have Above The Law, you flip that disc and you have Fire Down Below. They all come in 1:85,16X9 widescreen anamorphic. The picture quality is average on most of them. They are all in 5.1 surround except Above The Law which is in Mono.{Above The Law} (1988)- R- Disc 1 Side 1The Story of the movie is a bit confusing for an action movie. As a matter of fact a review said "" it contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers""(Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times=1988) and its true the movie is in a way unoriginal but it manages to be fresh by keeping the audience thinking and observing who is working for whom. The movie commences in Vietnam with the character of Nico Toscanni, he is recruited by the C.I.A to assist as an observant. Then we see the character as a cop investigating a drug ring. And it seems that everyone Nico busts comes out of jail quickly. Instead of being defended he is asked to back off. So it is obvious something is up...but what? The rest I leave to you to find out. Its a clever story that even though it's been used in various action movies of the 80's and 90's it still brings in a an extra punch. A must own by any Seagal enthusiasticMY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5-------------------------------------------------------------------------{Fire Down Below} (1997)-R- Disc 1 Side 2Segal plays Jack Taggart, an agent of the Environmental Protection Agency; and like ""On Deadly Ground"" Segal has a thing for protecting people from rich industrialist, that only have one thing in mind...to make more money. Taggart arrives in a small town in Kentucky, he posses as a carpenter, interested only in fixing peoples porches and houses. But as we all know Segal is undercover and is ready for some action. In this small town in eastern Kentucky, Someone is dumping toxic waste down the mountains...now that's a big no-no. Taggart begins to question people of the town, if they know of anyone that is involved with the dumping; no one of course can help because they are being watched, and even if they could they're too chicken....So you know what that means..That's right, Seagal is goanna have to save the day from cowards that cant stand up for themselves.MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5--------------------------------------------------------------------------Under Siege-(1992)-R- Disc 2, Side 1Seagal plays Casey Rayback...he is a cook for battleship USS Missouri. Rayback has to prepare a meal for a special surprise party for The Captain (Patrick O'Neal) but the surprise is the new arrivals, which seem like musicians and caterers but in fact are invaders that are planning to overtake the ship to steal its arsenal of nuclear Tomahawk cruise missiles. The overtaking went as planned, the people on board are taken as hostage.But...they didn't plan on the cook. Aside from being a cook he is an Ex petty officer/Navy seal who has been given medals many times and is an expert in martial arts and his specialty is counter-terrorism...oh boy..The bad guys chose the wrong ship to overtake. The movie is filled with great lines, and some quirky humor. This is Seagal while he still was the champ. Worth owning, for sure.MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5-------------------------------------------------------------------------The Glimmer Man-(1996)-R- Disc 2, Side 2In Glimmer Man Seagal plays Jack Cole, an Ex government intelligence operative known as ""The Glimmer Man,"" because he could move so quickly and quietly that his victims would only see a glimmer before they died. in fact that is so BS, Segal moves slower than his previous movies here, his gut is beginning to grow and his acting is stale and wooden. anyhow back to the movie, Cole is assigned to work with An L.A. police detective named Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans) they are both on the look for a serial killer known as the ""Family Man"" he is given that name because...well he kills families; and aside from killing them he tortures and crucifies them after their deaths. After a string of murders the killer gets personal, he kills Coles wife..and you know what that means...that's right...its payback time, but it seems that this killings are beginning to get weird, there is a copycat making the murders look like ""the Family Man""....now the question is Who is the killer, the ""family man or the copycat?Along with these psychos we have a local crime boss doing dealings with the Russians, somehow it's all connected and don't expect a clever twist because there really isn't. I give them credit for adding some suspense here and there, but Segal doesn't belong in this movie, he feels out of place. The only good actors in this movie are Keenen Ivory Wayans and Brian Cox.MY PERSONAL RATING: 2  OUT OF 5-------------------------------------------------------------------------EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE
