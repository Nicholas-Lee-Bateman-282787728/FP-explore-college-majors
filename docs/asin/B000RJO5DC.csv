Rossi,"[2, 4]","With teen movies about geeks in high school just trying to catch a break and be at least tolerated, some movies excel (Can't Buy Me Love, Three O Clock High, Pretty in Pink, and the stellar 10 things I Hate About You) some are reasonably acceptable (She's All That, Jawbreaker)and then there are those that try really hard but end up just as geeky as their star nerd. Full Of It falls into this final category. While the movie does have it's moments of clever fun, the whole thing is ruined by a young and talented actor (Pinkston) who injects way too much slapstickiness into his role. He is giddily foppish at best and hopelessly silly at worst. Still, the film does have a certain charm in it's message, although the viewer shouldn't have to feel like they are watching a three stooges movie to get it. 2.25 stars",2,definitely full of it,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,816,"['teen', 'movies', 'geeks', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'trying', 'catch', 'break', 'be', 'least', 'tolerated', 'movies', 'excel', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'Three', 'O', 'Clock', 'High', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'stellar', '10', 'things', 'Hate', 'are', 'reasonably', 'acceptable', 'Jawbreaker', 'then', 'are', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'as', 'geeky', 'star', 'nerd', 'Full', 'final', 'category', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'clever', 'fun', 'whole', 'thing', 'ruined', 'young', 'talented', 'actor', 'Pinkston', 'who', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'slapstickiness', 'role', 'giddily', 'foppish', 'best', 'hopelessly', 'silly', 'worst', 'Still', 'film', 'have', 'certain', 'charm', 'message', 'viewer', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'three', 'stooges', 'movie', 'get', '2.25', 'stars']",Full Of It

1082190,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000RJO5DC,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","**/2Sam Leonard is a 17-year-old pipsqueak who looks more like an incoming freshman than an outgoing senior.  Newly arrived at Bridgeport High, Sam suffers the slings and arrows of abuse and ridicule on a daily basis - until, that is, he figures out that the way to get the ""cool"" kids to like him is to concoct elaborate fabrications about virtually every aspect of his really quite humdrum life.  The problem is that one day all the lies he has been telling mysteriously start coming true - with decidedly disastrous results for Sam and all those around him.  In true parabolic fashion, Sam is finally forced to concede that honesty may in fact be the best policy when it comes to winning friends, influencing people and getting what one really wants out of life.""Full of It"" is a bush-league morality tale that uses magical realism to make its point.  Yet, while youngsters may be amused by some of the wish-fulfillment aspects of the plot and even edified by the little lessons about life that Sam learns along the way, concerned parents should note that a certain overall sleaziness in the tone may make this less than ideal viewing for the average pre-teen.  Adults, on the other hand - whether sleazy or not - will be pretty much unengaged by the whole thing.  Though, if the truth be told, the movie does have a few genuinely clever moments scattered amidst all the distasteful and dull ones, as well as a denouement that really is pretty darn funny.As Annie, the sole member of the student body who befriends Sam, Kate Mara (memorable as Heath Ledger's daughter in ""Brokeback Mountain"") brings such a transcendent warmth and depth to her character that she seems to be performing in a whole other movie entirely (one can almost sense the actress's impatience at bursting the bonds of the material so she can move onto better things).  Ryan Pinkston is somewhat less impressive as the benighted Sam, though he does have a certain boyish charm that comes across well on screen.",2,"clever idea, mediocre execution",1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,1984,"['**/2Sam', 'Leonard', '17-year-old', 'pipsqueak', 'who', 'more', 'incoming', 'freshman', 'outgoing', 'senior', 'Newly', 'arrived', 'Bridgeport', 'High', 'Sam', 'slings', 'arrows', 'abuse', 'ridicule', 'daily', 'basis', 'out', 'way', 'get', 'cool', 'kids', 'like', 'concoct', 'elaborate', 'fabrications', 'virtually', 'aspect', 'really', 'quite', 'humdrum', 'life', 'problem', 'one', 'day', 'lies', 'been', 'telling', 'mysteriously', 'start', 'coming', 'true', 'decidedly', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Sam', 'true', 'parabolic', 'fashion', 'Sam', 'finally', 'forced', 'concede', 'honesty', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'best', 'policy', 'when', 'winning', 'friends', 'influencing', 'people', 'getting', 'what', 'one', 'really', 'life', 'Full', 'bush-league', 'morality', 'tale', 'magical', 'realism', 'make', 'point', 'youngsters', 'may', 'be', 'amused', 'wish-fulfillment', 'aspects', 'plot', 'even', 'edified', 'little', 'lessons', 'life', 'Sam', 'way', 'concerned', 'parents', 'should', 'note', 'certain', 'overall', 'sleaziness', 'tone', 'may', 'make', 'less', 'ideal', 'viewing', 'average', 'pre-teen', 'Adults', 'other', 'hand', 'sleazy', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'unengaged', 'whole', 'thing', 'Though', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'genuinely', 'clever', 'moments', 'scattered', 'distasteful', 'dull', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'denouement', 'really', 'pretty', 'darn', 'funny.As', 'Annie', 'sole', 'member', 'student', 'body', 'who', 'Sam', 'Kate', 'Mara', 'memorable', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'daughter', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'such', 'transcendent', 'warmth', 'depth', 'character', 'be', 'performing', 'whole', 'other', 'movie', 'entirely', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'sense', 'actress', 'impatience', 'bursting', 'bonds', 'material', 'can', 'move', 'better', 'things', 'Ryan', 'Pinkston', 'somewhat', 'less', 'impressive', 'benighted', 'Sam', 'have', 'certain', 'boyish', 'charm', 'across', 'well', 'screen']",Full Of It
