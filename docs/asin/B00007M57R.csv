Fazion Love was Suge Knight, Merlin wasw 2Pac, Rashaan Nall was BIggie, Toni Braxton was Faith and Sharissa was Lil Kim. The only person was missing was Puffy. If you know the story behind them and you have the movie.Aside from that you have a very well done movie that shows how ""fueds"" can get started with simple mistakes. What makes the DVD worth getting is the Merlin Santana tribute. It's about the only one since he was a quick sentence in so called Black Magazines. The DVD is about hte only place where you will hear Merlin's rap skills since he was notable to release any of his four rap albums before his death.",4,Doesn't this remind of something?,1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,696,"['watching', 'movie', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'were', 'talking', 'Fazion', 'Love', 'was', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'Merlin', 'wasw', '2Pac', 'Rashaan', 'Nall', 'was', 'BIggie', 'Toni', 'Braxton', 'was', 'Faith', 'Sharissa', 'was', 'Lil', 'Kim', 'only', 'person', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'Puffy', 'know', 'story', 'have', 'movie.Aside', 'have', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'how', 'fueds', 'can', 'get', 'started', 'simple', 'mistakes', 'What', 'DVD', 'getting', 'Merlin', 'Santana', 'tribute', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'quick', 'sentence', 'so', 'called', 'Black', 'Magazines', 'DVD', 'hte', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'will', 'hear', 'Merlin', 'rap', 'skills', 'was', 'notable', 'release', 'four', 'rap', 'albums', 'death']",Play'd

Merlin Santana was a great actor and it seems a human being as well. He lights up the screen with his looks and charisma as the egotistical Mayhem, and The lead actor in the film gives a good performance as well, If you are a hip hop fan you need this one in the collection.",4,Play'd not being Play'd ENOUGH!!!!,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,384,"['film', 'very', 'much', 'underatted', 'indie', 'film', 'film', 'period', 'very', 'powerful', 'emtotional', 'Merlin', 'Santana', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'human', 'being', 'as', 'well', 'up', 'screen', 'looks', 'charisma', 'egotistical', 'Mayhem', 'lead', 'actor', 'film', 'good', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'hip', 'hop', 'fan', 'need', 'one', 'collection']",Play'd
