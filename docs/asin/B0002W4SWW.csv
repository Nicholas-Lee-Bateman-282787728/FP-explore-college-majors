847688,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002W4SWW,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 2]","Nominated for 9 Golden Globes and 34 Emmys, including 2 for Outstanding Comedy Series, Home Improvement was the number one family-friendly comedy for most of the 1990's decade. Created by three writers who worked on wide range of sitcoms, such as The Cosby Show (1984) and Roseanne (1988), Home Improvement is one of a number of 1990's smash hit sitcoms built around a lead character who stars as a stand-up comic in real life. Some of the other series include Seinfeld (1990), The Drew Carey Show (1995), Everybody Loves Raymond (1996), and King Of Queens (1998) among others. One of the trailblazers in this area, Home Improvement ranked in the Top 10 among Nielsen-rated shows for seven of its eight seasons (it ranked #11 in Season 7). One notable tidbit of trivia is that Sears was approached to sponsor the show which would've put Craftsman tools in the hands of Tim ""The Toolman"" Taylor (as opposed to the fictional ""Binford"" brand), but Sears rejected the offer because they feared Tim Allen's prior conviction on a drug charge might be interpreted as unfriendly to families (funny, since Home Improvement later fell under the moniker of the Walt Disney Company)...Home Improvement centers around the life of Tim Taylor (Tim Allen), a home improvement expert who hosts his own local TV show ""Tool Time"" on cable access. Tim and his wife Jill (Patricia Richardson) live in a house in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan with their three boys Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), and Mark (Taran Noah Smith). On ""Tool Time,"" Tim is flanked by the flannel-clad, easy-going Al Borland (Richard Karn) who is often the butt of Tim's jokes and harbors a neurotic tendency toward perfectionism. At home, Tim's numerous domestic missteps lead him to continuously seek the advice of his well-traveled, near-perfect neighbor Wilson (Earl Hindman), whose lower face is never seen (only his eyes)... Marked by Tim's abundant clumsiness as a home improvement guru and his inept ability to display sensitivity toward his wife, Home Improvement is a classic sitcom that relies on formulaic episodes of slapstick humor and zinging one-liners. It's a formula that works, but grows tiresome as the show progresses...The Home Improvement (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere in which Jill goes to a job interview after telling Tim not to mess with the dishwasher. But Tim inevitably ruins the dishwasher when his attempt to super-charge it goes awry. When the job interviewers pass her over, Jill returns home dejected, and Tim only makes things worse - leaving room for a bit of Wilson advice to save the day for Tim... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Flying Sauces"" in which the K&B; Construction guys show off their jobsite cooking skills on Tool Time while Tim and Jill plot revenge on their eldest boys, and ""What About Bob?"" in which Tim cheats in a Tool Time trivia contest in order to beat guest Bob Vila...Below is a list of episodes included on the Home Improvement (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1

847692,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B0002W4SWW,D. C. Obraztsov,"[0, 0]","Home Improvement is based around Tim Taylor (Tim Allen), a husband and father of three who has his own day-time television show called ""Tool Time"" (guess what that's about) with his pudgy and lovable sidekick, Al Borland (Richard Karn), who Tim loves to make fun of. Jill Taylor (Patricia Richardson) is Tim's intelligent and witty wife, and his three boys are Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), an environmentalist and hilarious jokester, Brad (Zachery Ty Bryan), the jock and popular guy, and Mark (Taran Noah Smith), the youngest of the three and the ""goth"" boy. There is also Wilson Wilson, the Taylor's quirky and genius neighbor, who gives at least one the Taylor's advice in every episode. Inspired by one of Tim Allen's neighbor as a child, we never get to fully see Wilson's face.Home Improvement has always stood out amongst all the dozens of hopeless sitcoms out there. While it is sometimes guilty of using cliches and overdone topics to revolve a show around, it manages to turn it from the same old thing to a fresh, clever, and hilarious episode. While it isn't the most realistic or unique sitcom out there, it's special because it is quality, good 'old ""family fun,"" that you can just pop in to brighten up your spirits. It's neat to watch the whole series in a row, because it's so interesting to see how the family evolves over time. In the first season Brad is getting into trouble at an arcade, and in the last season he's getting busted for smoking pot. But somehow Home Improvement has always managed to keep the same ""feel"" to it. Lots of shows seem to break away from what they once were. You can watch an episode from the first season and then one from the last and the characters and writing just seem completely and utterly different. But with Home Improvement, you always feel like you're watching the same family on tv, no matter how much they've evolved and changed.

Yet he always winds up destroying something or injuring himself. . He knows a lot about tools but isn't the best at using them.He also gets in trouble with his wife in pretty much every episode. When he does that he goes over to see his nextdoor neighbor Wilson for advice. We only see half of Wilson's face at a time in each episode which is also pretty funny. Tim's partner Al who wears plaid and is a mamma's boy also gets some laughs. The show is always fun mostly because of Tim Allen though. No one could play this goofy and loveable guy in love with cars and tools better than he does. So eventhough his kids on the show got older it still could've gone on without them. Not like they were the strength of the show anyway. His chemestry with Patricia Richardson as his wife Jill was always strong. The kids do get some laughs I guess but as years went on I think they got annoying. If you threw them in college and just made it Tim, Jill, Al and Wilson's show it still would've been great.",4,One of the best shows ever!,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,1246,"['always', 'loved', 'show', 'wish', 'was', 'still', 'tv', 'now', 'Anyway', 'time', 'coming', 'out', 'dvd', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Tim', 'Toolman', 'Taylor', 'expert', 'tools', 'fixing', 'stuff', 'even', 'own', 'tv', 'show', 'always', 'up', 'destroying', 'something', 'injuring', 'lot', 'tools', ""n't"", 'best', 'using', 'them.He', 'also', 'trouble', 'wife', 'pretty', 'much', 'episode', 'When', 'see', 'nextdoor', 'neighbor', 'Wilson', 'advice', 'only', 'see', 'half', 'Wilson', 'face', 'time', 'episode', 'also', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Tim', 'partner', 'Al', 'who', 'plaid', 'mamma', 'boy', 'also', 'laughs', 'show', 'always', 'fun', 'mostly', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'one', 'could', 'play', 'goofy', 'loveable', 'guy', 'love', 'cars', 'tools', 'better', 'So', 'kids', 'show', 'got', 'older', 'still', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Not', 'were', 'strength', 'show', 'anyway', 'chemestry', 'Patricia', 'Richardson', 'wife', 'Jill', 'was', 'always', 'strong', 'kids', 'do', 'get', 'laughs', 'guess', 'years', 'went', 'think', 'got', 'annoying', 'threw', 'college', 'just', 'made', 'Tim', 'Jill', 'Al', 'Wilson', 'show', 'still', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great']",Home Improvement: Season 1

847704,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0002W4SWW,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[14, 15]","Home Improvement was on the air at a time when sitcoms were a good source of bread and butter for network television. During its prime, Home Improvement made its share of money for ABC, as the show appealed to a broad audience, from kids to adults.The complete first season of Home Improvement takes us back to the very beginning of the show. We meet Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor, the host of a local cable home improvement show, his wife Jill and their three kids. While much of the show dealt with the television show, the prime focus was on the family aspect of Tim's life and how it affected his work and vice versa.Stand-up comedian Tim Allen brought the character of Tim Taylor to life. His observations about everyday life, along with his penchant for getting himself into fine messes, usually involving ""more power,"" made for some interesting situations. While Tim is by no means a stupid guy, he quite often misinterprets advice given to him by his neighbor Wilson, or the meaning of any number of things that his wife says. Somehow he always manages to get everything to work out the way it needs to. If only life were so easy.Patricia Richardson stars as Tim's wife Jill. She is the perfect co-star for Allen. While she can stay in the background as he goes off on his antics, she is also quite capable of stepping into the spotlight with some great jokes of her own. As the only woman in a house full of males, she finds herself constantly outnumbered, but usually manages to get her way.Zachery Ty Bryan, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Taran Noah Smith star as the Taylors' three kids. Through the years viewers got to watch the kids grow and got to see how their parents influenced them as they grew up. Looking back, the kids look incredibly young in this very first season. It is amazing just how much older they look at the end of the show. The kids have some great moments, mainly with the older two picking on their younger brother, but the focus of the show is the family, and if the kids do something wrong, the parents are there to try to teach them right from wrong.Richard Karn stars as Al, Tim's assistant and Earl Hindman stars as Wilson. Both characters provide some great supporting parts and it is interesting to see all the ways that the show's powers that be find to hide Wilson face, which is never fully visible. The show also started the career of Pamela Anderson, who was Lisa, the original Tool Time girl.Two of the show's producers provide commentary on a number of episodes, and the commentary is quite interesting and a good addition to the set. This set is worth the purchase for anyone who remembers the good days of television sitcoms.",4,"Klaus, some music please",1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2670,"['Home', 'Improvement', 'was', 'air', 'time', 'when', 'sitcoms', 'were', 'good', 'source', 'bread', 'butter', 'network', 'television', 'prime', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'made', 'share', 'money', 'ABC', 'show', 'appealed', 'broad', 'audience', 'kids', 'adults.The', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'back', 'very', 'beginning', 'show', 'meet', 'Tim', 'Tool', 'Man', 'Taylor', 'host', 'local', 'cable', 'home', 'improvement', 'show', 'wife', 'Jill', 'three', 'kids', 'much', 'show', 'television', 'show', 'prime', 'focus', 'was', 'family', 'aspect', 'Tim', 'life', 'how', 'affected', 'work', 'vice', 'versa.Stand-up', 'comedian', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'brought', 'character', 'Tim', 'Taylor', 'life', 'observations', 'everyday', 'life', 'penchant', 'getting', 'fine', 'messes', 'usually', 'involving', 'more', 'power', 'made', 'interesting', 'situations', 'Tim', 'stupid', 'guy', 'quite', 'often', 'advice', 'given', 'neighbor', 'Wilson', 'meaning', 'number', 'things', 'wife', 'Somehow', 'always', 'get', 'everything', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'only', 'life', 'were', 'so', 'easy.Patricia', 'Richardson', 'stars', 'Tim', 'wife', 'Jill', 'perfect', 'co-star', 'Allen', 'can', 'stay', 'background', 'off', 'antics', 'also', 'quite', 'capable', 'stepping', 'spotlight', 'great', 'jokes', 'own', 'only', 'woman', 'house', 'full', 'males', 'constantly', 'outnumbered', 'usually', 'get', 'way.Zachery', 'Ty', 'Bryan', 'Jonathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'Taran', 'Noah', 'Smith', 'star', 'Taylors', 'three', 'kids', 'years', 'viewers', 'got', 'watch', 'kids', 'grow', 'got', 'see', 'how', 'parents', 'influenced', 'grew', 'up', 'Looking', 'back', 'kids', 'look', 'incredibly', 'young', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'amazing', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'older', 'look', 'end', 'show', 'kids', 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'mainly', 'older', 'two', 'picking', 'younger', 'brother', 'focus', 'show', 'family', 'kids', 'do', 'something', 'wrong', 'parents', 'are', 'there', 'try', 'teach', 'right', 'wrong.Richard', 'Karn', 'Al', 'Tim', 'assistant', 'Earl', 'Hindman', 'Wilson', 'characters', 'provide', 'great', 'supporting', 'parts', 'interesting', 'see', 'ways', 'show', 'powers', 'be', 'find', 'hide', 'Wilson', 'face', 'never', 'fully', 'visible', 'show', 'also', 'started', 'career', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'who', 'was', 'Lisa', 'original', 'Tool', 'Time', 'girl.Two', 'show', 'producers', 'provide', 'commentary', 'number', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'quite', 'interesting', 'good', 'addition', 'set', 'set', 'purchase', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'days', 'television', 'sitcoms']",Home Improvement: Season 1

As most fans by now know, most if not all shows are edited down when put into syndication. Usually, a couple of minutes are trimmed. This, as well as the second and presumably all seasons sets of ""Home Improvement"" feature unedited shows as they originally aired. This is important, because over the course of a season's worth of episodes, about two episode's worth of running time is cut when two minutes are clipped from each episode.Visually, this set looks as good as it possibly could. Early 90's videotape. It sounds just fine as well.The rest of the extras aren't much. The three commentary tracks are pretty interesting. They're a bit dry, but very informative overall. It's a shame they couldn't put more commentaries on this set. There were no commentaries for the second season set.The ""Loose Screws"" montage is not really an extra, as it simply slices up little bits of footage from the actual episodes.Apart from perhaps offering more extras (more commentaries, documentaries, etc.), this set is perfect.

Everyone can laugh and no ones gets feelings hurt.Seinfeld is the only ""normal"" person on his show.  Everyone else is crazy, wierd or just a looser.  His jokes are all about other people and the stupid things they do.  He is only firends with them to be sure he is always the ""coolest"" guy in the group...Drew Carry, was pretty much an Ohio version of Seinfeld...BUT, Home Imporovement was all about making fun of Tim Allen and his Character Tim ""the Toolman"" Taylor.

Here's a description of the episodes on this set:""Pilot"" - Tim wrecks the dishwasher, while trying to give it more power;  Jill gets a job interview""Mow Better Blues"" - Mark breaks a tool of Tim's, which Jill was told to stay away from""Off Sides"" - Tim hires a magician as a babysitter""Satellite on a Hot Tim's Roof"" - Tim installs a satellite dish;  one of Jill's teachers visits""Wild Kingdom"" - Tim hears some weird noises in the basement""Adventures in Fine Dining"" - Tim bets Jill that he can teach their kids some table manners""Nothing More Than Feelings"" - Tim tells his Tool Time audience that his wife drove with the oil light on;  the other guys say that their wives don't respect their tools""Flying Sauces"" - The K & B Construction guys show how to make hot gourmet meals while on the job, on Tool Time;  Brad and Randy tell Mark that Brad, Randy, and their parents are aliens""Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble"" - Tim puts another sink in their bathroom""Reach Out and Teach Someone"" - Tim does a Tool Time episode for women to teach plumbing;  Brad worries that he's going to do bad on a test at school""Look Who's Not Talking"" - At a presentation for the Library Association:  Jill gets stage fright""Yule Better Watch Out"" - Tim competes in a neighborhood Christmas light competition;  Brad and Randy tell Mark that Santa Claus is dead""Up Your Alley"" - Tim and Jill go bowling;  the kids get in trouble at a local arcade""For Whom the Belch Tolls"" - Jill doesn't want an old college friend of Tim's to stay with them""Forever Jung"" - Karen comes to visit;  Jill teaches Brad to dance""Jill's Birthday"" - Tim buys Jill a lifetime membership to a health club;  after wasting all their money, Brad and Randy put together a scheme to get Mark's money""What About Bob?"" - Tim competes against Bob Vila in a trivia game;  Randy pulls a prank on a nerd at school""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" - Tim's boss has Tim and Jill go camping to promote some new camping gear.  The problem is that they had a romantic weekend planned instead""Unchained Malady"" - Tim throws away a chain letter;  Randy gets dared to do a trick on his bike""Birds of a Feather Flock to Taylor"" - Jill tells Tim that he's a bad listener (happens to me all the time);  Brad and Randy try to get Mark to eat a worm""A Battle of Wheels"" - Tim lets Al host Tool Time;  Tim accidently breaks some of Jill's pottery""Luck Be a Taylor Tonight"" - Jill's sister and Al ruin Tim's poker night""Al's Fair in Love and War"" - Tim wants to read Jill's old diary;  Al tries to ask a girl out""Stereo-Typical"" - Tim and Jill argue over stereo volumeSo buy this set, my favorite segments were always the Tool Time scenes of the episodes.

Today, re-runs of this show are still shown on televison, and ""Home Improvement"" has even found some new viewers.  I have loved this show since I was seven years old, and I remember watching every episode every night.  Years later, this show still kicks, and it is a miracle to see that ""Home Improvement"" has finally made it's way to DVD.  This DVD has three discs, and there are eight episodes on each disc.  Yes, all the laughs are here.  All the grunts are here.  But most importantly, all of the great episodes which were all made during season one are all here.  There is no behind the scenes look at the show, and there are no interviews with the cast members, but there are two commentaries on disc one and one commentary on disc two, and on disc three, there is ""Loose Screws"", a certain thing from this show where people talked about how much they loved Al, Tim with his kids, Wilson giving advice to his neighbors, and seveal other features (there are nine ""Loose Screws"") which are all pretty funny. Also, if you purchase this DVD, a free 2005 calendar that has a picture of Pamela Anderson comes with it. Before I got this DVD, I had seen every season one episode, and it is great not just to have them all on DVD, but to get to watch them anytime I want to.  Hope they release a season two DVD!",5,"""Home Imporvement"" is finally on DVD............",1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,1392,"['Ever', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'came', '1991', 'millions', 'people', 'have', 'watched', 'Today', 're-runs', 'show', 'are', 'still', 'shown', 'televison', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'even', 'found', 'new', 'viewers', 'have', 'loved', 'show', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'remember', 'watching', 'episode', 'night', 'Years', 'later', 'show', 'still', 'miracle', 'see', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'finally', 'made', 'way', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'three', 'discs', 'are', 'eight', 'episodes', 'disc', 'Yes', 'laughs', 'are', 'here', 'grunts', 'are', 'here', 'most', 'importantly', 'great', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'here', 'scenes', 'look', 'show', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'disc', 'one', 'one', 'commentary', 'disc', 'two', 'disc', 'three', 'Loose', 'Screws', 'certain', 'thing', 'show', 'where', 'people', 'talked', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'Al', 'Tim', 'kids', 'Wilson', 'giving', 'advice', 'neighbors', 'seveal', 'other', 'features', 'are', 'nine', 'Loose', 'Screws', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Also', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'free', '2005', 'calendar', 'picture', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'got', 'DVD', 'had', 'seen', 'season', 'one', 'episode', 'great', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'DVD', 'get', 'watch', 'anytime', 'want', 'Hope', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'DVD']",Home Improvement: Season 1
