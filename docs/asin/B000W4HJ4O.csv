1106998,A1KR00LVURBZTA,B000W4HJ4O,D. A. Donahue,"[2, 2]","I have been a fan of Robert Wagner and the various movies and shows he has been in; but this movie was a let down.  It appeared to be produced in a choppy and sloppy fashion and did not live up to the standards of movies and shows that he has been a part of.  I would not reccommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Robert Wagner, nor would I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of family Christmas movies.  I gave it 2 stars as it was a family and Christmas movie and did star Robert Wagner and that can be considered a gift of the Holiday Season soon to be upon us.",2,A Let Down,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,572,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'various', 'movies', 'been', 'movie', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'appeared', 'be', 'produced', 'choppy', 'sloppy', 'fashion', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'movies', 'been', 'part', 'would', 'not', 'reccommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'would', 'reccommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'family', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'was', 'family', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'did', 'star', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'gift', 'Holiday', 'Season', 'soon', 'be', 'upon']",N/A
