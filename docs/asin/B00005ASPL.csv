578662,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B00005ASPL,Adam,"[1, 3]","The serial isn't a bad idea, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The Doctor and his companions Paulie and Ben land the South Pole where an international space command center is run by a stereotypical American general and the Doctor and companions are confined as a twin Planet of Earth appears and the Cybermen launch their invasion.There was something interesting things going on but until the end of the second episode, this had little to do with even the companions. Paulie at one point hangs around to make coffee while the Doctor faints for an entire episode and does or says very little in each episode with the exception of one impassioned speech on emotion in Episode 2.  In addition, the whole resolution to the problem of the Cybermen is really weak.The serial does have some things working for it. There's mystery in the first two episodes, and Ben does have some good action in part 3 with a terrific cliffhanger to wrap that up. And Episode 4 features the first regeneration with the Doctor urging them to &#34;keep warm&#34; as a final charge before going to the TARDIS and changing into Patrick Troughton.This is a somewhat mediocre serial. The DVD earns three stars through its interesting extras including featurettes on what it means to be a companion and on three of the Doctor's male companions including Frazier Hines. The DVD also includes some vintage TV footage including three minutes of an interview of a testy William Hartnell by an equally testy interviewer, and a 9 minute retrospective from 1973 celebrating the Doctor's 10th Anniversary and hosted by an actor who played a companion.",3,First Doctor Sleeps Gently Into the Night,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,1628,"['serial', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'execution', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'Paulie', 'Ben', 'land', 'South', 'Pole', 'where', 'international', 'space', 'command', 'center', 'run', 'stereotypical', 'American', 'general', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'are', 'confined', 'twin', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'Cybermen', 'launch', 'invasion.There', 'was', 'something', 'interesting', 'things', 'going', 'end', 'second', 'episode', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'even', 'companions', 'Paulie', 'one', 'point', 'hangs', 'make', 'coffee', 'Doctor', 'faints', 'entire', 'episode', 'very', 'little', 'episode', 'exception', 'one', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'emotion', 'Episode', '2', 'addition', 'whole', 'resolution', 'problem', 'Cybermen', 'really', 'weak.The', 'serial', 'have', 'things', 'working', 'mystery', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Ben', 'have', 'good', 'action', 'part', '3', 'terrific', 'cliffhanger', 'wrap', 'up', 'Episode', '4', 'first', 'regeneration', 'Doctor', 'urging', '34', 'keep', 'warm', '34', 'final', 'charge', 'going', 'TARDIS', 'changing', 'Patrick', 'Troughton.This', 'somewhat', 'mediocre', 'serial', 'DVD', 'three', 'stars', 'interesting', 'extras', 'including', 'featurettes', 'what', 'be', 'companion', 'three', 'Doctor', 'male', 'companions', 'including', 'Frazier', 'Hines', 'DVD', 'also', 'vintage', 'TV', 'footage', 'including', 'three', 'minutes', 'interview', 'testy', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'equally', 'testy', 'interviewer', '9', 'minute', 'retrospective', '1973', 'celebrating', 'Doctor', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'hosted', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'companion']",N/A

578667,A2OLW9CB7K11A2,B00005ASPL,"B. Mah ""Bill""","[3, 4]","The Tenth Planet is a historical moment in Doctor Who's television history. It is the story that featured the very first appearance of the Doctor's second best villains (under the Daleks), the Cybermen. More so, it is also the final story to feature William Hartnell as the Doctor, and features the very first regeneration sequence. The Tenth Planet was never aired in Canada and the United States due to the missing fourth episode. This video release marks its debut for North America.The Tenth Planet, a four part story, originally aired on BBC1 back in October 1966 during the early run of the series' fourth season. Patrick Troughton would take over as the second Doctor for the rest of that season, but William Hartnell starred in that season's first two stories, &quot;The Smugglers&quot; and &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;.The Tenth Planet is not the best story, but still very much entertains the viewer, making you forget its lack of quality in story. The Cybermen's appearance does look very primitive to today's standards, but back then it was very scary in a way and still puts a scare in me still. The surviving first three episodes have been remastered by the Doctor Who Restoration Team under the BBC's watch. This story is also infamous for its missing fourth episode (thanks to BBC's famous &quot;junking&quot; of Dr. Who episodes during the 1970s, there are still 109 episodes missing and all may be gone forever), but the regeneration scene still exists in the BBC Archives. The Restoration Team have wonderfully reconstructed episode 4 with the various photo telesnaps, the few surviving clips of episode 4 from someone's 8 mm recording off from TV, blended with the surviving audio soundtrack. There is also some brief text rolling on the bottom of the screen to further the story's plot when needed (this reconstruction is better than &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot; video's reconstruction of episodes 2 and 3 from a few years back).All in all, The Tenth Planet is an entertaining story, and seeing William Hartnell's last performance as the Doctor really was a treat to watch, although he is not featured in episode 3. In a way, we only get to see his Doctor's last appearance in episodes 1 and 2, and a bit from the reconstructed episode 4. Hartnell and the rest of the cast put in remarkable performances. The regeneration scene at the end is a shock to watch!To all Doctor Who fans, get yourself a copy of The Tenth Planet added to your video collection.

578668,A33ENJGEER9S81,B00005ASPL,Bruce Bender,"[1, 2]","There are a lot of Doctor Who stories that are undeniably classics and I think all Doctor Who fans know which ones they are. However, I do not think that the introduction of a companion is a classic story because DW fan has his or her own favorite companion. So I think there is only one story that is a double classic and that is The Tenth Planet because it not only introduces the Cybermen, but also has the Doctor altering his appearance for the first time.First, the introduction of the Cybermen. Their introduction was written by KIt Pedler and Gerry Davis as a warning on the potential abuses of technology, particuarly in its uses in medicine. Here, the Cybermen, with their singsong voices and human hands are the creepiest I've ever seen them, since future versions of them make them mostly look completely robotic and it's not until their return in the new series that they regain that creepiness.Second, the altering of the Doctor's appearance. We already knew the Doctor was an alien, but by casting a new actor to play the Doctor when William Hartnell left the show, the producer emphasized not only the Doctor's alien nature, but also gave succeeding actors playing the Doctor the chance to make their mark on the show by adding their own interpretation of the Doctor's character and making the Doctor a very complex person.So if you haven't bought this story, please buy it because it is an integral part of the mythology of Doctor Who.",5,Doctor Who's only double classic is out on DVD.,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,1451,"['are', 'lot', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'are', 'undeniably', 'classics', 'think', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fans', 'know', 'ones', 'are', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'introduction', 'companion', 'classic', 'story', 'DW', 'fan', 'own', 'favorite', 'companion', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'double', 'classic', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'not', 'only', 'Cybermen', 'also', 'Doctor', 'altering', 'appearance', 'first', 'time.First', 'introduction', 'Cybermen', 'introduction', 'was', 'written', 'KIt', 'Pedler', 'Gerry', 'Davis', 'warning', 'potential', 'abuses', 'technology', 'particuarly', 'uses', 'medicine', 'Here', 'Cybermen', 'singsong', 'voices', 'human', 'hands', 'are', 'creepiest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'future', 'versions', 'make', 'mostly', 'look', 'completely', 'robotic', 'not', 'return', 'new', 'series', 'regain', 'creepiness.Second', 'altering', 'Doctor', 'appearance', 'already', 'knew', 'Doctor', 'was', 'alien', 'casting', 'new', 'actor', 'play', 'Doctor', 'when', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'left', 'show', 'producer', 'emphasized', 'not', 'only', 'Doctor', 'alien', 'nature', 'also', 'gave', 'succeeding', 'actors', 'playing', 'Doctor', 'chance', 'make', 'mark', 'show', 'adding', 'own', 'interpretation', 'Doctor', 'character', 'making', 'Doctor', 'very', 'complex', 'person.So', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'story', 'please', 'buy', 'integral', 'part', 'mythology', 'Doctor', 'Who']",N/A

578672,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005ASPL,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 6]","December 1986.  Isolated Antarctica, full of snow, snow, and more snow.  Ideal place to have Snowcap Tracking Station, a military base under International Space Command.  While tracking the progress of spacecraft Zeus IV, several things happen.  One, loss of power in the fuel cells and some gravitational force prevents Zeus IV from reentry.  Two, a new planet is seen inbetween Mars and Venus.  Three, the Doctor, Ben, and Polly land at the base.The new planet looks familiar, as many of the land masses look like Earth's, only upside down--Polly has a big deal claiming to recognize Malaysia.  It turns out that this world was a twin of Earth, Mondas, which left millions of years ago.  Now nearly drained of energy, it has returned to regain its energy--from Earth.The Cybermen are clearly supposed to be a menace, but they do look laughable.  One author described them as someone dressing up with kitchen implements at a jumble sale.  However, their spaceships are more impressive than the paper-plate like ones in the second Cyber story, The Moonbase.  Two human-like aspects of these primitive Cybermen can be seen.  One, they have names.  Two, their bare hands are still human.The use of emotions to the ruthlessly logical Cybermen is a big point here.  Polly's concern for the astronauts, ""they're people and they're going to die"" is responded with:  ""I do not understand you.  There are people dying all over your world, yet you do not care about them.""  Another time, they say, ""Our brains our just like yours, with certain weaknesses have been removed. ... You call them emotions, do you not?"" and ""We have freedom from disease, protection against heat and cold. ... do you prefer to die in misery?""  A clip from here is used in the Earthshock story (1982), where the Doctor asks a Cybermen, ""Emotions--love, pride, hate, fear--have you no emotions, sir?""General Cutler is one of the nastiest characters ever to appear in a Who story, though not as much as Professor Stahlman (Inferno).  He's gruff, has a harsh voice, puts the safety of his astronaut son above all other priorities, and takes a page from another general, Jack D. Ripper of Dr. Strangelove, in wanting to use the Z-bomb.  When the Doctor tells him, ""I don't like your tone [of voice]"" the General shoots back, ""Well I don't like your face or your hair.""  Fortunately, the time travelers gain a friend in Barclay, the Australian physicist, as an ally.Ben's resourcefulness, real assertiveness and Cockney accent give him a credible and visible role here.  Yet, he expresses regret when he has to kill a Cybermen ready to kill him, crying out, ""You didn't give me an alternative!""  Polly has a thankless time in comparison, but at least she's nice to look at.  Pity more of her stories aren't available anymore.By the time William Hartnell's last Doctor Who story aired, he was a very ill man and in Episode 3, he collapses and is taken to his bunk.  That's all we see of him until he pops back up for Episode 4.Speaking of which Episode 4 of this story was stolen from the BBC vaults and never returned, but a combination of photo stills, some of them publicity shots of the Doctor, surviving film footage, and the complete audio soundtrack help make this four-parter as complete as it possibly can.  It still works.When this was first aired, viewers in Britain witnessed an event more historical than the first appearance of the Daleks--William Hartnell (First Doctor) regenerated into Patrick Troughton (Second Doctor).  It's thus legendary for this reason, as well as introducing the Cybermen, but it still stands out on its own as a reasonably good story in the Doctor Who canon.",4,A reasonably good end to the Hartnell era.,1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,3661,"['December', '1986', 'Isolated', 'Antarctica', 'full', 'snow', 'snow', 'more', 'snow', 'Ideal', 'place', 'have', 'Snowcap', 'Tracking', 'Station', 'military', 'base', 'International', 'Space', 'Command', 'tracking', 'progress', 'spacecraft', 'Zeus', 'IV', 'several', 'things', 'happen', 'One', 'loss', 'power', 'fuel', 'cells', 'gravitational', 'force', 'prevents', 'Zeus', 'IV', 'reentry', 'Two', 'new', 'planet', 'seen', 'inbetween', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'Three', 'Doctor', 'Ben', 'Polly', 'land', 'base.The', 'new', 'planet', 'familiar', 'many', 'land', 'look', 'Earth', 'only', 'upside', 'down', 'Polly', 'big', 'deal', 'claiming', 'recognize', 'Malaysia', 'out', 'world', 'was', 'twin', 'Earth', 'Mondas', 'left', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'nearly', 'drained', 'energy', 'returned', 'regain', 'energy', 'Earth.The', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'clearly', 'supposed', 'be', 'menace', 'do', 'look', 'laughable', 'One', 'author', 'described', 'someone', 'dressing', 'up', 'kitchen', 'implements', 'jumble', 'sale', 'However', 'spaceships', 'are', 'more', 'impressive', 'paper-plate', 'ones', 'second', 'Cyber', 'story', 'Moonbase', 'Two', 'human-like', 'aspects', 'primitive', 'Cybermen', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'One', 'have', 'names', 'Two', 'bare', 'hands', 'are', 'still', 'human.The', 'use', 'emotions', 'ruthlessly', 'logical', 'Cybermen', 'big', 'point', 'here', 'Polly', 'concern', 'astronauts', ""'re"", 'people', ""'re"", 'going', 'die', 'responded', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'are', 'people', 'dying', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'time', 'say', 'brains', 'just', 'yours', 'certain', 'weaknesses', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'call', 'emotions', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'freedom', 'disease', 'protection', 'heat', 'cold', 'do', 'prefer', 'die', 'misery', 'clip', 'here', 'used', 'Earthshock', 'story', '1982', 'where', 'Doctor', 'Cybermen', 'Emotions', 'love', 'pride', 'hate', 'fear', 'have', 'emotions', 'sir', 'General', 'Cutler', 'one', 'nastiest', 'characters', 'ever', 'appear', 'Who', 'story', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Professor', 'Stahlman', 'Inferno', 'gruff', 'harsh', 'voice', 'safety', 'astronaut', 'son', 'other', 'priorities', 'page', 'general', 'Jack', 'D.', 'Ripper', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'wanting', 'use', 'Z-bomb', 'When', 'Doctor', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'tone', '[', 'voice', ']', 'General', 'shoots', 'back', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'face', 'hair', 'Fortunately', 'time', 'travelers', 'gain', 'friend', 'Barclay', 'Australian', 'physicist', 'ally.Ben', 'resourcefulness', 'real', 'assertiveness', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'give', 'credible', 'visible', 'role', 'here', 'Yet', 'regret', 'when', 'kill', 'Cybermen', 'ready', 'kill', 'crying', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'alternative', 'Polly', 'thankless', 'time', 'comparison', 'least', 'nice', 'look', 'Pity', 'more', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'available', 'anymore.By', 'time', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'last', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', 'aired', 'was', 'very', 'ill', 'man', 'Episode', '3', 'taken', 'bunk', 'see', 'back', 'up', 'Episode', '4.Speaking', 'Episode', '4', 'story', 'was', 'stolen', 'BBC', 'vaults', 'never', 'returned', 'combination', 'photo', 'stills', 'publicity', 'shots', 'Doctor', 'surviving', 'film', 'footage', 'complete', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'help', 'make', 'four-parter', 'as', 'complete', 'possibly', 'can', 'still', 'works.When', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'viewers', 'Britain', 'witnessed', 'event', 'more', 'historical', 'first', 'appearance', 'Daleks', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'First', 'Doctor', 'regenerated', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'Second', 'Doctor', 'thus', 'legendary', 'reason', 'as', 'well', 'introducing', 'Cybermen', 'still', 'out', 'own', 'reasonably', 'good', 'story', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'canon']",N/A
578673,A2SN0CRV5EY58V,B00005ASPL,Darrin Lanchbury,"[9, 22]","Let me point out that I was born in Britain and grew up a fan of Doctor Who.  I should also point out that I own nearly every book based on the TV stories and most of the videos.  Being a mere 33 years old I wasn't even I twinkle in my dad's eye when The Tenth Planet was originally screened and due to the loss of episode 4, I wasn't expecting to ever see it.  I was lucky enough to buy the Target paperback of the story writen by the script writer, Gerry Davis.  The book was excellent and in my mind's eye I created the most evil race of cybermen ever to terrorise our planet... and that's the problem.Story:  The doctor lands at the North Pole and finds himself taken inside an American space tracking center.  While he is there a space capsule in orbit is lost and a second capsule faces destruction due to the presence of a rougue planet that looks exactly like Earth.  Soon the base has visitors from Earth's twin planet Mondas - the Cybermen.  Mondas has run out of energy and plans to drain all the power from Earth.  The cybernetic population of Mondas also plans to take the population of Earth with then and convert them into Cybermen.  Thankfully the Doctor stops them with the help of his companions, but back in the TARDIS he collapses and starts to change...This episode is really for die-hard fans ONLY.  Anyone half interested in Doctor Who who buys this by chance is likely to never buy another tape again.  While the restoration of the tape is excellent on episodes 1, 2 and 3, the first Cyberman design looks like someone had an accident in the kitchen with some pots and pans and some crazy glue.  Worst still are the voices of the cybermen which sound like a mono-sylablistic choir boy suffering from a ruptured bladder.  Their facial expressions when they speak had me cringing in my chair and my hand was hovering near the &quot;stop&quot; button on my VCR remote.  THIS was terrifying in the 60's?  I don't think so... but then I was barely there.Time for some praise now.  The restoration of episode 4 is excellent considering that the full print no longer exists.  Instead of the terrible efforts of &quot;Invasion&quot; and &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot;, the soundtrack is left on the tape and existing video clips and telesnaps are inserted where possible to guide you through the action.  The regeneration sequence remains intact and shows William Hartnell changing into Patrick Troughton.  If the BBC decides to re-release stories with missing episodes on DVD then I hope the repeat this process.  The only better option I can think of is to use a professional animation team to provide a cartoon version of the missing pieces... but that would probably be too expensive.For real fans, this episode is a must have, but like &quot;Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, the images Gerry Davis implants in your imagination when you read the paperbacks were way above the budget of the 1960's BBC effects team.  I'm not sure if I'll ever take this tape of the shelf again for another viewing.",2,DOESN&quot;T STAND UP TO THE TEST OF TIME,997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,3009,"['Let', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'born', 'Britain', 'grew', 'up', 'fan', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'own', 'nearly', 'book', 'based', 'TV', 'stories', 'most', 'videos', 'Being', 'mere', '33', 'years', 'old', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'twinkle', 'dad', 'eye', 'when', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'was', 'originally', 'screened', 'due', 'loss', 'episode', '4', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'ever', 'see', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'buy', 'Target', 'paperback', 'story', 'writen', 'script', 'writer', 'Gerry', 'Davis', 'book', 'was', 'excellent', 'mind', 'eye', 'created', 'most', 'evil', 'race', 'cybermen', 'ever', 'terrorise', 'planet', 'problem.Story', 'doctor', 'North', 'Pole', 'taken', 'inside', 'American', 'space', 'tracking', 'center', 'there', 'space', 'capsule', 'orbit', 'lost', 'second', 'capsule', 'destruction', 'due', 'presence', 'rougue', 'planet', 'exactly', 'like', 'Earth', 'Soon', 'base', 'visitors', 'Earth', 'twin', 'planet', 'Mondas', 'Cybermen', 'Mondas', 'run', 'energy', 'plans', 'drain', 'power', 'Earth', 'cybernetic', 'population', 'Mondas', 'also', 'take', 'population', 'Earth', 'then', 'convert', 'Cybermen', 'Thankfully', 'Doctor', 'help', 'companions', 'back', 'TARDIS', 'change', 'episode', 'really', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'ONLY', 'Anyone', 'half', 'interested', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'who', 'chance', 'likely', 'never', 'buy', 'tape', 'again', 'restoration', 'tape', 'excellent', 'episodes', '1', '2', '3', 'first', 'Cyberman', 'design', 'someone', 'had', 'accident', 'kitchen', 'pots', 'pans', 'crazy', 'glue', 'Worst', 'still', 'are', 'voices', 'cybermen', 'sound', 'mono-sylablistic', 'choir', 'boy', 'suffering', 'ruptured', 'bladder', 'facial', 'expressions', 'when', 'speak', 'had', 'cringing', 'chair', 'hand', 'was', 'hovering', 'quot', 'stop', 'quot', 'button', 'VCR', 'remote', 'THIS', 'was', 'terrifying', '60', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'then', 'was', 'barely', 'there.Time', 'praise', 'now', 'restoration', 'episode', '4', 'excellent', 'considering', 'full', 'print', 'no', 'longer', 'Instead', 'terrible', 'efforts', 'quot', 'Invasion', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ice', 'Warriors', 'quot', 'soundtrack', 'left', 'tape', 'existing', 'video', 'clips', 'telesnaps', 'are', 'inserted', 'where', 'possible', 'guide', 'action', 'regeneration', 'sequence', 'intact', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'changing', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'BBC', 're-release', 'stories', 'missing', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'then', 'hope', 'repeat', 'process', 'only', 'better', 'option', 'can', 'think', 'use', 'professional', 'animation', 'team', 'provide', 'cartoon', 'version', 'missing', 'pieces', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'too', 'expensive.For', 'real', 'fans', 'episode', 'must', 'have', 'quot', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'quot', 'images', 'Gerry', 'Davis', 'implants', 'imagination', 'when', 'read', 'paperbacks', 'were', 'way', 'budget', '1960', 'BBC', 'effects', 'team', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'take', 'tape', 'shelf', 'again', 'viewing']",N/A

But the thing that grates most on me are the majority of the guest actors.

578678,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B00005ASPL,Happy Reader,"[29, 31]","It's 1986. Two astronauts in the Zeus IV space capsule relay photos back to their base, code-named Snowcap, buried under the Antarctic snow. Everything is going smoothly until one of the soldiers at Earth base looks through his periscope to the snowstormed continent surface and sees - a pretty woman!It's Polly! She, Ben and the Doctor just landed in the TARDIS, and decided to explore. In short order, soldiers appear from a hatch and take our trio down into the buried base. They're at the South Pole Base of International Space Command, and the suspicious C.O., General Cutler, doesn't buy their story of landing in ""a sort of spaceship"".However, the General has more to worry about. The Doctor informs him that a 10th planet has appeared. Not only is its gravitational pull affecting Zeus IV, but it is draining the power from the capsule, endangering the astronauts.Before you can say ""cyber-bully"", three robot-like aliens infiltrate and take over the base. Their leader, Krail, explains that the new planet is Mondas, their home. ""Eons ago, our planets were twins. We drifted away from you on a journey to the edge of space. Now we have returned.... We are called Cybermen.... We were exactly like you once, but our cybernetic scientists realized that our race was getting weak.""The news only gets worse, as Krail continues: ""The energy of Mondas is nearly exhausted and now returns to its twin and will gather energy from Earth... until it is all gone.... Everything on Earth will stop.""  But never fear, the cybermen will save some of the humans - to take back to Mondas for conversion into cybermen.If ever the Doctor was needed to save Earth, this is it. Unfortunately, at the beginning of Episode 3, the Doctor collapses. It's time for humans to step up and save themselves.""The Tenth Planet"" is a four-part serial that first aired in October 1966.  It is not the best of Classic Dr. Who, but it is famous (among Whovians) for showing the very first regeneration of a Time Lord. It's supposed to take place in the then far-future of 1986!The video for Episode 4 has been long lost, though the BBC does have a full audio track. ""The Tenth Planet"" was issued on VHS in 2001. For the VHS, episode 4 was reconstructed using ""telesnaps"", a combination of still photos, the few existing clips and the surviving audio soundtrack.The November, 2013, 2-disc DVD release of ""The Tenth Planet"" is the 1st time this series has been on DVD. Both video and sound are fully restored and English subtitles are available throughout. The four episodes (including animation) aggregate to 93 minutes of highly anticipated Whovian viewing. This series is worth buying just to see how the Cybermen first looked - basically white stockings over their heads with tinny voices.For this DVD release, Episode 4 will be animated, and synched with the original audio track, by Planet 55 Studios, the same company that animated ""Reign of Terror"".[Added after my DVD was received and viewed: I think the animated episode turned out great. The Cybermen, in particular, look fantasic. The animation has a modern graphic novel-style feel to it that I like. The regeneration at the very end is also totally animated; they did not try to fuse in the short video of the regeneration that survives.The sound may have been restored for all four episodes, but I thought it was still pretty fuzzy for most except the animated episode.]Trivia: This is the only Cyberman episode where individual cybermen have names. In the next Doctor Who serial, ""The Power of the Daleks"", Troughton's first as the Doctor, he describes himself as ""renewed"". The term regeneration isn't used until ""Planet of the Spiders"" (1974), which was Jon Pertwee's last Doctor Who serial.The Commentary Track is extra #5 on Disc 1. I thought it was very good. Toby Hadoke moderates. Commentators include Christopher Matthews (plays radar technician), Anneke Wells (plays Polly), Gregg Palmer aka Donald Van Der Maaten (plays two Cybermen, Shav and Gern), Earl Cameron (94 years-old! plays the astronaut Williams), Alan White (plays the astronaut Shultz) and Christopher Dunham (plays R/T technician). There are also excerpts from Hadoke's interview with Peter Kindred (designer).Cameron says: ""It was slightly surprising that they should have a black astronaut at that time. The world has changed a lot since then. We're going back about fifty years ago, of course.""During the scenes with the astronauts moving slo-mo, Anneke talks about a show with astronauts 3 years before the first real moon landing: ""One of the things that I loved when we worked on this, was that we were so proud because we had Kit Pedler. He knew exactly how the suits should be, how the movements should be. He was our resident whiz kid, beause he was probably the only person at the BBC at the time, who actually had the knowledge of what was going on within the space circles, which was completely fresh. Now, you know, we expect to see these things, but in those days, we'd never seen anything like it. We were terribly proud of it.""It was humorous (though maybe not to him), when Gregg Palmer states that he is NOT the American actor, Gregg Palmer, who had a small part in a Star Trek episode. Wikipedia had it wrong for a long time, but now with this release, perhaps that will remain corrected.The Cybermen suits were very warm. Palmer: ""That's why one of the Cybermen fainted."" In watching my DVD the first time, I missed it. Second time through (with the commentary), I finally saw it. When the 2nd wave of Cybermen land, in episode 3, they approach the base in a line trudging through the snow. Towards the left side, one faints just before the scene cuts.Disc 1 Bonus Extras:1. ""Frozen Out: The Making of the Tenth Planet"" (29 minutes) Commentators include Anneke Wills, Earl Cameron, Reg Whitehead (plays Cybermen Krail and Jarl), Peter Kindred and Shirley Coward (vision mixer). This has a very interesting look at the gamble the producers took trying to continue the show with an actor replacing William Hartnell, who was much loved by audiences.Shirley worked on the regeneration sequence and talks about the process. Anneke says, ""We thought it was blooming magic!""2.  Episode 4 VHS Reconstruction (24 minutes) From the 2000 VHS release. The clips used were 8 mm film recordings made by fans and a 16mm film clip of the regeneration itself, which survived because it was used in a 1973 episode of the ""Blue Peter"" TV show (see disc 2, extra 12). These were included the 2004 DVD ""Lost in Time: Collection of Rare Episodes: The William Hartnell Years"".  The regeneration clip was also released as a special feature on the DVD releases of ""The Three Doctors"" and ""Castrovalva"". All clips are very short, but you do get to see William Hartnell collapse to the floor and be flooded by a bright light as his face changes to that of Patrick Troughton.3.  Photo Gallery (3.5 minutes)4.  PDF Materials: Radio Times Listing5.  Audio Options. A Commentary track is available for episodes 1-3, but not the animated episode 4.6.  Information Text by Stephen James Walker. This is available on only episodes 1-3. Tidbits I didn't notice on my own. ""In his final story, William Hartnell's Doctor dons clothes like those worn in his first episode: cloak, scarf and Astrakhan hat.""7.  Coming Soon Trailer for the 2014 DVD release of ""The Moonbase"". Whoo Hoo!!Disc 2 Bonus Extras:7.  ""Points West: William Hartnell Interview"" (3 minutes) A few months after ""The Tenth Planet"" aired in 1966, William Hartnell was interviewed by BBC Bristol for an episode of ""Points West"". He was touring in a children's Christmas pantomime titled ""Puss in Boots"" and is filmed in his dressing room. Cementing his image as a grumpy old man, for me, he speaks disparagingly of pantomime actors, making it clear that he is not one of them!8.  ""Doctor Who Stories: Anneke Wills"" (13 minutes) This interview was originally aired in 2003 as part of ""Story of Doctor Who"". She is frank about saying that Hartnell was difficult to work with and Troughton was lovely to work with.9.  ""The Golden Age"" (16 minutes) Dominic Sandbrook examines whether or not Doctor Who had a Golden Age, or are we just remembering with rose-colored glasses.10. ""Boys! Boys! Boys!"" (19.5 minutes) This is a casual interview with Peter Purves (plays Steven Taylor), Frazer Hines (plays Jamie McCrimmon) and Mark Strickson (plays Vislor Turlough). They were companions to the 1st, 2nd and 5th Doctors.11.  ""Companion Piece"" (24 minutes) Commentators include William Russell (plays Ian Chesterson), Elisabeth Sladen (plays Sarah Jane), Louise Jameson (plays Leela), Nicola Bryant (plays Peri), Arthur Darvill (plays Rory), Nev Fountain (writer), Joseph Lidster (writer) and Dr. Tomas Charmorro-Premuzic (psychologist). The topic of this feature is what it takes and what it costs to be a Doctor Who companion.It starts off with a photo montage of companions over the years, and in the middle is a funny video clip of Sarah Jane in ""The Hand of Fear"" (1976) talking to herself and getting as irate as she ever has: ""I must be mad. I'm sick of being cold and wet and hypnotized left, right and center. I'm sick of being shot at, savaged by bug-eyed monsters. Never knowing if I'm coming or going or BEING. And boy am I SICK of that sonic screwdriver!""Fountain muses: ""If they [companions] did react normally, if Dr. Who was real, they'd be screaming and wetting themselves and creeping and hiding, as far in the ship as they possibly could - by story two!""12.  ""Blue Peter: Doctor Who's Tenth Anniversary"" (9 minutes) This 1973 segment of the children's show had clips from six Doctor Who series, including William Hartnell's regeneration in ""The Tenth

578679,A2XWBYHQY5MG9,B00005ASPL,Ian D. Smith,"[25, 27]","Make no mistake: Doctor Who fans are well justified in purchasing this video. The first appearance of the wonderful Cybermen and the final regular appearance of the legendary William Hartnell is now finally available to own and the reconstruction of the missing final episode is superb. But what has been overlooked for all these years is the fact that the actual plot concocted by the talented Gerry Davis and Kit Pedler is hardly amazing. The storyline has all the requisite misunderstandings and escapes and diabolical schemes, but very little of it is executed with any real enthusiasm. Until the Cybermen arrive the first episode is surprisingly slow, with many scenes involving two incredibly dull actors portraying two incredibly lifeless astronauts in trouble. Things are not helped by a hammy performance by the actor portraying General Cutler, whose road to madness is unconvincing to say the least. While William Hartnell gives a bravura performance, he is not entirely essential to the story and is even absent from all of Part 3, which is disappointing considering it is the last complete episode of the First Doctor's era. This leaves Michael Craze, Anneke Wills and the guest cast to carry much of 'The Tenth Planet,' and the story is listless as a result.But there are still enough good elements to recommend this video. The early Cybermen are a fascinating creation both on paper and in their conception. Sandra Reid's innovative costumes are quite impressive given DW's limited resources, and the one-time only sing-song voices created by Roy Skelton and Peter Hawkins are decidedly creepy. William Hartnell gives a dignified performance, and while his screentime is limited, he does get off a few choice lines of dialogue.The reconstruction of Part 4 is excellent, seamlessly integrating an audio track with telesnaps, subtitles, the few clips that remain of the episode (including of course, the regeneration sequence at the end), and a few subtle visual effects that enhance the experience.Overall, 'The Tenth Planet' is certainly worth buying, for its many DW firsts and for nostalgia. While there are many elements to the story which are underwhelming, in the end at least the combination of Cybermen and William Hartnell's last hurrah prove to be worth all the hype. As the Cybermen would (and do) say, 'Resistance -is- useless.'",3,"A Must For Fans, But Over-Hyped",1006041600,"11 18, 2001",2001,2353,"['Make', 'mistake', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fans', 'are', 'well', 'justified', 'purchasing', 'video', 'first', 'appearance', 'wonderful', 'Cybermen', 'final', 'regular', 'appearance', 'legendary', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'now', 'finally', 'available', 'own', 'reconstruction', 'missing', 'final', 'episode', 'superb', 'been', 'overlooked', 'years', 'fact', 'actual', 'plot', 'concocted', 'talented', 'Gerry', 'Davis', 'Kit', 'Pedler', 'hardly', 'amazing', 'storyline', 'requisite', 'misunderstandings', 'escapes', 'diabolical', 'schemes', 'very', 'little', 'executed', 'real', 'enthusiasm', 'Cybermen', 'arrive', 'first', 'episode', 'surprisingly', 'slow', 'many', 'scenes', 'involving', 'two', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'actors', 'portraying', 'two', 'incredibly', 'lifeless', 'astronauts', 'trouble', 'Things', 'are', 'not', 'helped', 'hammy', 'performance', 'actor', 'portraying', 'General', 'Cutler', 'road', 'madness', 'unconvincing', 'say', 'least', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'bravura', 'performance', 'not', 'entirely', 'essential', 'story', 'even', 'absent', 'Part', '3', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'last', 'complete', 'episode', 'First', 'Doctor', 'era', 'Michael', 'Craze', 'Anneke', 'Wills', 'guest', 'cast', 'carry', 'much', ""'The"", 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'story', 'listless', 'result.But', 'are', 'still', 'enough', 'good', 'elements', 'recommend', 'video', 'early', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'fascinating', 'creation', 'paper', 'conception', 'Sandra', 'Reid', 'innovative', 'costumes', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive', 'given', 'DW', 'limited', 'resources', 'one-time', 'only', 'sing-song', 'voices', 'created', 'Roy', 'Skelton', 'Peter', 'Hawkins', 'are', 'decidedly', 'creepy', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'dignified', 'performance', 'screentime', 'limited', 'get', 'off', 'few', 'choice', 'lines', 'dialogue.The', 'reconstruction', 'Part', '4', 'excellent', 'seamlessly', 'integrating', 'audio', 'track', 'telesnaps', 'subtitles', 'few', 'clips', 'remain', 'episode', 'including', 'course', 'regeneration', 'sequence', 'end', 'few', 'subtle', 'visual', 'effects', 'enhance', 'experience.Overall', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'certainly', 'worth', 'buying', 'many', 'DW', 'firsts', 'nostalgia', 'are', 'many', 'elements', 'story', 'are', 'underwhelming', 'end', 'least', 'combination', 'Cybermen', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'last', 'hurrah', 'prove', 'be', 'hype', 'Cybermen', 'would', 'do', 'say', ""'Resistance"", '-is-', 'useless']",N/A

578682,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B00005ASPL,Jason A. Miller,"[29, 32]","Whether you grew up watching &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as it was first broadcast in the UK, or in endless 1980s US PBS reruns, &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; is one of those stories you were dying to see again and again.  Annoyingly, you couldn't, because the BBC destroyed all prints of the fourth and final episode, and the story was thus &quot;incomplete&quot; and never re-aired.The recent BBC releases of stories featuring William Hartnell, the First Doctor, have been exemplary, and this VHS continues the trend.  The first 3 episodes of &quot;Tenth Planet&quot; -- long seen only on dim, bootlegged, Nth generation copies of the original -- are nearly pristine.  Episode 4 is reconstructed using existing still photos, the audio track, and a few well-used video effects which serve to add to the pictures, not detract from them.  (It's heartening to note that for this story, the &quot;restoration&quot; team did not seek to alter the existing footage by replacing scenes with outtakes, or digitally &quot;correcting&quot; old special effects, as was done with the ill-advised &quot;The Five Doctors -- Special Edition&quot;)The seminal moment here is the First Doctor's death, and subsequent regeneration into another Doctor, another actor.  Using 8mm film footage, this video presents the complete regeneration, and it's wonderful to watch.  The sequence is an innovative bit of studio-bound 1960s TV direction and is most impressive.The story itself doesn't hold up perfectly -- it was, after all, made 35 years ago and will come across as archaic, no matter how it's packaged and presented -- but most &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans should be willing to overlook the inherent flaws and enjoy the story on its own terms.  &quot;Tenth Planet&quot; offers a rare look at &quot;adult&quot; monsters and ethnic diversity in a &quot;children's&quot; show, and of course it's the first appearance of the Cybermen villains, whose popularity persists to this day.Regardless of what you think of the story itself, the existence of this video satisfies one of the greatest wishes of all &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans.  Add to that the obvious care that went into recreating the lost Episode 4, and you have one of the most significant, appealing DW video releases of all time.",5,"A new body, at last!",996364800,"07 29, 2001",2001,2266,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'quot', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'quot', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'UK', 'endless', '1980s', 'US', 'PBS', 'reruns', 'quot', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'quot', 'one', 'stories', 'were', 'dying', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'Annoyingly', 'could', ""n't"", 'BBC', 'destroyed', 'prints', 'fourth', 'final', 'episode', 'story', 'was', 'thus', 'quot', 'incomplete', 'quot', 'never', 're-aired.The', 'recent', 'BBC', 'releases', 'stories', 'featuring', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'First', 'Doctor', 'have', 'been', 'exemplary', 'VHS', 'trend', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'quot', 'long', 'seen', 'only', 'dim', 'bootlegged', 'Nth', 'generation', 'copies', 'original', 'are', 'nearly', 'pristine', 'Episode', '4', 'reconstructed', 'using', 'existing', 'still', 'photos', 'audio', 'track', 'few', 'well-used', 'video', 'effects', 'serve', 'add', 'pictures', 'not', 'detract', 'heartening', 'note', 'story', 'quot', 'restoration', 'quot', 'team', 'did', 'not', 'seek', 'alter', 'existing', 'footage', 'replacing', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'digitally', 'quot', 'correcting', 'quot', 'old', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'done', 'ill-advised', 'quot', 'Five', 'Doctors', 'Special', 'Edition', 'quot', 'seminal', 'moment', 'here', 'First', 'Doctor', 'death', 'subsequent', 'regeneration', 'Doctor', 'actor', 'Using', '8mm', 'film', 'footage', 'video', 'complete', 'regeneration', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'sequence', 'innovative', 'bit', 'studio-bound', '1960s', 'TV', 'direction', 'most', 'impressive.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'perfectly', 'was', 'made', '35', 'years', 'ago', 'will', 'come', 'archaic', 'matter', 'how', 'packaged', 'presented', 'most', 'quot', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'quot', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'willing', 'overlook', 'inherent', 'flaws', 'enjoy', 'story', 'own', 'terms', 'quot', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'quot', 'rare', 'look', 'quot', 'adult', 'quot', 'monsters', 'ethnic', 'diversity', 'quot', 'children', 'quot', 'show', 'course', 'first', 'appearance', 'Cybermen', 'villains', 'popularity', 'day.Regardless', 'what', 'think', 'story', 'existence', 'video', 'one', 'greatest', 'wishes', 'quot', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'quot', 'fans', 'Add', 'obvious', 'care', 'went', 'recreating', 'lost', 'Episode', '4', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'appealing', 'DW', 'video', 'releases', 'time']",N/A
578683,A2DDBYKXF1N0D5,B00005ASPL,Jero Briggs,"[1, 2]","Says William Hartnell's Doctor in one of his final scenes, and he was right! It may have been the end of an era as William Hartnell was leaving the role, but as this story makes clear it's far from over. This story marks the first appearance of the Cybermen who would return in many latter stories and lots more during the Patrick Troughton era, and this episode also features the first regeneration ever!It's a pitty that the final episode didn't survive, but the reconstruction of it was brilliant, and you do get a few surviving clips - including the Doctor's regeneration scene which is perfectly intact. When watching it, it feels as if you were actually watching the original episode itself. It hardly feels as if it's missing at all.The story is top notch. The Doctor and his companions, Ben and Polly, arrive at the South Pole Tracking station late in 1986 just as a routine space mission starts going wrong. Soon a new planet suddenly appears out of nowhere and starts approaching Earth fast. The planet is almost identical to Earth in almost every aspect. It is Mondas - Earth's long lost twin that drifted away to the edge of the galaxy millions of years ago. It's inhabitants were advanced humanoids who were dying out, and to survive, they replaced their body parts with cybernetic parts. Eventually emotions were removed and the ruthless Cybermen were born. Now Mondas is dying out as well so the Cybermen have returned to their twin to drain its power so that Mondas will live and the Earth will die. The humans that are not killed will be turned into Cybermen. It's just great.The only let down is that you don't see much of the Doctor in this story due to the fact that Hartnell was very ill at the time. But when he does make an appearance, he sure does make his presence known. His preformance is excellent, and his final regeneration scene was a very well done piece and is truly iconic. You also learn a lot more about the Cybermen history in this story than any other in the entire series.

The travelers have arrived at an arctic, military run space station in the year 1986.  Fascinating to see how the folks at or working for the BBC in the '60's imagined what space travel would look like in 20 years.  They obviously couldn't have imagined the advances in technology that would exist in a mere two decades.  Even the cybermen, former humans who have technologically adapted themselves so as to have superior strength and no emotions, bear bulky technology, have difficulty speaking anything like normal humans, and are surprisingly easy to defeat.  Yet they are, at the same time, if one uses one's imagination, as terrifying as the Borg of Star Trek Next Generation and even more alien than the Vulcans.  Even the Cybermen's claim that &quot;resistance is useless&quot; seems to predict the Borg.Technically speaking, this series is a little rough, particularly the sound, so careful viewing is required.  But in many ways, it seems a more modern series of episodes than some of the later ones, as it still seems to be a realistic view of a remote space station, and the general who runs it, although seemingly a bad caricature of John Wayne, represents all too well the kind of cowboy American thinking to which many people can still relate to all too well!  The sets are wonderfully realistic and claustrophobic, and the existence of a national agency run by a Swiss man whose native language is French seems a precursor of how in the future the world would need to work together more as one body and those bodies would not necessarily be run by England and America.I agree with the other reviewers that it would have been nice to see more of William Hartnell in his last episode, but it's kind of exciting to see the first regeneration in the show, even though it's in the lost episode which is mostly just audio of the show over stills, with descriptive information in text at the bottom of the screen.  By the time of the last episode, however, one is so into the story that it's easy to ignore the fact that it isn't playing out with full video.If you're new to Dr. Who, this isn't the place to start, but for Who fans, this is really a must episode as it's not only a well-told story, but has the first appearance of the Cybermen and the first regeneration.  It's a fitting final episode for William Hartnell, who really remains the quintessential Doctor.  He may not be everyone's favorite (personally I find Tom Baker much more fun and warm), but he's what the creators had in mind and every other Doctor draws from him.",4,"A 5 star for true fans, for everyone else a 3",1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,2935,"['usual', 'older', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'later', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'ignore', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'use', 'imagination', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'one', 'better', 'episodes', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'era', 'not', 'mention', 'intriguing', 'look', 'hopes', 'fears', 'America', 'then', '1966', 'burgeoning', 'space', 'program', 'technological', 'advances', 'travelers', 'have', 'arrived', 'arctic', 'military', 'run', 'space', 'station', 'year', '1986', 'Fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'folks', 'working', 'BBC', ""'60"", 'imagined', 'what', 'space', 'travel', 'would', 'look', '20', 'years', 'obviously', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'imagined', 'advances', 'technology', 'would', 'exist', 'mere', 'two', 'decades', 'Even', 'cybermen', 'former', 'humans', 'who', 'have', 'technologically', 'adapted', 'so', 'have', 'superior', 'strength', 'emotions', 'bear', 'bulky', 'technology', 'have', 'difficulty', 'speaking', 'anything', 'normal', 'humans', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'easy', 'defeat', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'one', 'imagination', 'as', 'terrifying', 'Borg', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'even', 'more', 'alien', 'Vulcans', 'Even', 'Cybermen', 'claim', 'quot', 'resistance', 'useless', 'quot', 'predict', 'Borg.Technically', 'speaking', 'series', 'little', 'rough', 'particularly', 'sound', 'so', 'careful', 'viewing', 'required', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'modern', 'series', 'episodes', 'later', 'ones', 'still', 'be', 'realistic', 'view', 'remote', 'space', 'station', 'general', 'who', 'seemingly', 'bad', 'caricature', 'John', 'Wayne', 'too', 'well', 'kind', 'cowboy', 'American', 'thinking', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'still', 'relate', 'too', 'well', 'sets', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'realistic', 'claustrophobic', 'existence', 'national', 'agency', 'run', 'Swiss', 'man', 'native', 'language', 'French', 'precursor', 'how', 'future', 'world', 'would', 'need', 'work', 'together', 'more', 'one', 'body', 'bodies', 'would', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'run', 'England', 'America.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'last', 'episode', 'kind', 'exciting', 'see', 'first', 'regeneration', 'show', 'even', 'lost', 'episode', 'mostly', 'just', 'audio', 'show', 'stills', 'descriptive', 'information', 'text', 'bottom', 'screen', 'time', 'last', 'episode', 'however', 'one', 'so', 'story', 'easy', 'ignore', 'fact', ""n't"", 'playing', 'out', 'full', 'video.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'Dr.', 'Who', ""n't"", 'place', 'start', 'Who', 'fans', 'really', 'must', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'well-told', 'story', 'first', 'appearance', 'Cybermen', 'first', 'regeneration', 'fitting', 'final', 'episode', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'who', 'really', 'quintessential', 'Doctor', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'personally', 'find', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'warm', 'what', 'creators', 'had', 'mind', 'other', 'Doctor', 'draws']",N/A
578686,A37UPPF989N4EB,B00005ASPL,"JKO ""A Doctor Who Viewer""","[4, 4]","Barring any wonderful future surprises, I think the release of The Tenth Planet wraps up the William Hartnell era of Doctor Who on DVD; and indeed at the time of it's first broadcast in October 1966, it wrapped up the Hartnell era period. Alas, this historically significant episode (possibly as important to the canon as Hartnell's opening story three years earlier) hasn't survived in the archives in it's entirety. Crucially, episode 4 is the one that's been lost (or more likely destroyed) and so the last episode to feature the first Doctor and the first ever regeneration of the leading role, is lost to TV history. Whereas most of the missing Doctor Who episodes were wiped once their overseas sales potential was exhausted, it's not entirely clear that that's the reason this four part story is incomplete. It seems that when BBC children's show 'Blue Peter' borrowed the episode to celebrate the show's tenth anniversary, the master print mysteriously disappeared. Even if that isn't true, it's thanks to 'Blue Peter' that the closing seconds of episode 4, with the transformation of Doctor One into Doctor Two, have survived at all.Once again, BBC Video have opted to recreate the missing episode, using animation synched to the surviving soundtrack. Once again, it's a bit hit and miss how it's turned out, but generally, this may be the best attempt at animation they've achieved so far. The characters are very well drawn and very naturally animated. The backgrounds are all very much in sync with the surviving material and the detail is excellent. However, just as with the animation for The Reign Of Terror, they've got a bit over zealous with the animation detail. The faces and hair of the characters are just a bit overdone. In order to create shades, tones and shadow, they've just got a bit too carried away. They've reigned in the temptation to jump the camera cuts as quickly as they did before, but it still doesn't feel that it's paced at the same speed as the live action episodes 1-3. It's just a little too fast. It is nonetheless a huge improvement on both Reign of Terror and The Ice Warriors. A really good attempt to recreate something that otherwise would be lost.There is an enjoyable commentary for the three surviving episodes, but nothing added to the animated episode 4 at all. Not even on screen production notes. It's a little disappointing there's no commentary, but in all honesty, everyone still alive who could contribute does so in the accompanying documentary and stand alone interviews, so the likelihood would have been the commentary would be repetitive or completely redundant. It's thus totally forgivable for it to be omitted. The one minor criticism for the reproduction of the three surviving episodes is that once again, the picture has been cleaned and enhanced to a state way beyond it's original transmission format. It's now just too good. As a result, we can clearly see the eyes of the actors playing the Cybermen and worse, the sellotape holding their helmets together is on full, vivid display. 405 line TV definition in monochrome would never have picked either of these things up at the time. We want the best for the DVD's of course, but applying modern technology to ancient video tape does have it's drawbacks.It's not that great a story in the Dr Who canon, despite it's historical significance (the debut of The Cybermen is also hugely noteworthy in DW history) but it's by no means the worst of the late Hartnell adventures. Rumours abound that a couple more of his stories are about to be rediscovered, but until that is either confirmed or denied, this is the end of the Hartnell DVD era.

One must applaud the work done to get this particular story out given the missing fourth most crucial episode. Given the abysmal treatment of the actual show by the BBC originally in dumbing it down and finally disposing of it, it is a credit to them that they have devoted so much care, time and attention to the delivery of the shows on VHS and DVD formats.As readers of my reviews will know by now, I often refer to the educational mission of the BBC in it's original charter. This story is no exception. The Hartnell years, more than any other, were characterised by the inclusion of new versions of historical events as well as being more overly likely to bring in new scientific developments or moral issues.In this story we discover that the Cybermen originated on the planet Mondas, shown as being an inverse of earth, which was earth's twin planet until it's orbit changed. In order to survive the inhabitants of the planet developed cybernetic techniques, firstly to replace body parts and laterto replace the brain where emotional centres were removed as they were unneccesary. Ultimately, life - but not as we know it - continued but in the process the Mondians lost their humanity. Readers might recall the larger than life movie version of Darth Vader in the Star Wars epics.It is this which makes the Cybermen so meanacing, the fact that their decisions are made on the basis of logic alone and where they have no other concerns than purely practical matters. Given that the first heart transplants had only recently been undertaken by Christian Barnard in South Africa, it seems a remote concern for the time but indicates the seriousness with which the debate about such things was conducted.Over thirty years later the sing-song voices of the Cybermen seem a little dated and they, of all the Doctor's adversaries, seemed to change the most throughout the years. This was certainly a weakening of their particular situation but some good Cybermen stories followed such as the 'Tomb of the Cybermen' soon to be available on DVD.For a finale, this was one of Hartnell's greatest performances as the Doctor. The crotchety old man at the start of the Doctor Who programmes had turned the role into one in which he had stature and commanded respect. It is a testimony to the man that he could turn his last show as the Doctor into such a vintage, virtuoso performance.",5,A warning for humanity,1025654400,"07 3, 2002",2002,2677,"['William', 'Hartnell', 'first', 'Doctor', 'adventure', 'originally', 'broadcast', '8', 'October', '29', 'October', '1966', 'Cybermen', 'dramatic', 'adventure', 'also', 'departure', 'Hartnell', 'show', 'first', 'ever', 'Timelord', 'regeneration.So', 'much', 'packed', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'One', 'must', 'applaud', 'work', 'done', 'get', 'particular', 'story', 'given', 'missing', 'fourth', 'most', 'crucial', 'episode', 'Given', 'abysmal', 'treatment', 'actual', 'show', 'BBC', 'originally', 'dumbing', 'down', 'finally', 'disposing', 'credit', 'have', 'devoted', 'so', 'much', 'care', 'time', 'attention', 'delivery', 'shows', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'formats.As', 'readers', 'reviews', 'will', 'know', 'now', 'often', 'refer', 'educational', 'mission', 'BBC', 'original', 'charter', 'story', 'exception', 'Hartnell', 'years', 'more', 'other', 'were', 'characterised', 'inclusion', 'new', 'versions', 'historical', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'more', 'overly', 'likely', 'bring', 'new', 'scientific', 'developments', 'moral', 'issues.In', 'story', 'discover', 'Cybermen', 'originated', 'planet', 'Mondas', 'shown', 'being', 'inverse', 'earth', 'was', 'earth', 'twin', 'planet', 'orbit', 'changed', 'order', 'survive', 'inhabitants', 'planet', 'developed', 'cybernetic', 'techniques', 'firstly', 'replace', 'body', 'parts', 'laterto', 'replace', 'brain', 'where', 'emotional', 'centres', 'were', 'removed', 'were', 'unneccesary', 'Ultimately', 'life', 'not', 'know', 'continued', 'process', 'Mondians', 'lost', 'humanity', 'Readers', 'might', 'recall', 'larger', 'life', 'movie', 'version', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'Star', 'Wars', 'epics.It', 'Cybermen', 'meanacing', 'fact', 'decisions', 'are', 'made', 'basis', 'logic', 'alone', 'where', 'have', 'other', 'concerns', 'purely', 'practical', 'matters', 'Given', 'first', 'heart', 'transplants', 'had', 'only', 'recently', 'been', 'undertaken', 'Christian', 'Barnard', 'South', 'Africa', 'remote', 'concern', 'time', 'seriousness', 'debate', 'such', 'things', 'was', 'conducted.Over', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'sing-song', 'voices', 'Cybermen', 'seem', 'little', 'dated', 'Doctor', 'adversaries', 'seemed', 'change', 'most', 'years', 'was', 'certainly', 'weakening', 'particular', 'situation', 'good', 'Cybermen', 'stories', 'followed', 'such', ""'Tomb"", 'Cybermen', 'soon', 'be', 'available', 'DVD.For', 'finale', 'was', 'one', 'Hartnell', 'greatest', 'performances', 'Doctor', 'crotchety', 'old', 'man', 'start', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'had', 'turned', 'role', 'one', 'had', 'stature', 'commanded', 'respect', 'testimony', 'man', 'could', 'turn', 'last', 'show', 'Doctor', 'such', 'vintage', 'virtuoso', 'performance']",N/A
578689,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B00005ASPL,Little Roy Blue,"[6, 7]","I have mixed feelings about ""The Tenth Planet."" It's a famous Doctor Who serial because it introduced two key pieces of the show's mythology: the sinister Cybermen, and the concept that the Doctor can ""regenerate"" into a new body (which means, in practical terms, a new actor). So it's an important serial, and pretty well made too.But alas, I don't really like this specific type of Who story. It takes place in a space control center, meaning that much of the dialogue is boring technical stuff. (For example: ""Zeus four, this is Snowcap. Do you read me? Over."" ""Reading you strength three, Snowcap. Go ahead."" ""Correct course by ten degrees. Over."") The supporting characters are also, for the most part, dull official types and soldiers who don't come alive in the same way as characters in a Robert Holmes or John Lucarotti script.That said, the script does a good job of introducing and explaining the Cybermen - compelling villains who long predated Star Trek's rather similar Borg. Unlike some reviewers, I actually like the Cybermen's mummy-like costumes and weird, high-pitched voices in this serial. They also have unusually interesting dialogue; like the Daleks, they ultimately evolved into catchphrase-spouting bores, but here they actually have personalities.As for the DVD itself...it's very well done. Key special features include a making-of documentary, a fun interview with Who actress Anneke Wills, and (best of all) an animated presentation of the serial's fourth episode, which is lost in its original form. Several lost Who episodes have been animated before, but I think this is the best one yet; the animation is fairly fluid, the character likenesses are good, and several of William Hartnell's characteristic gestures are neatly captured.Speaking of Hartnell, this was his final appearance as the Doctor. It's not a great way for him to go out, since he has a small role and missed appearing in episode three on account of being sick. And unfortunately, Anneke Wills is the only person to be extensively interviewed about Hartnell on the DVD, and she (understandably) didn't really like him. So both the serial and the DVD aren't exactly great tributes to the First Doctor.On the other hand, Hartnell gives a good performance in the few scenes where he's featured, demonstrating that he was truly one of the great Doctors. Like Tom Baker, he bowed out in a story that was weirdly uncharacteristic of his era...but overall, his body of work in the part was impressive.",4,Strong DVD; pretty good story,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,2495,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'famous', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'introduced', 'two', 'key', 'pieces', 'show', 'mythology', 'sinister', 'Cybermen', 'concept', 'Doctor', 'can', 'regenerate', 'new', 'body', 'practical', 'terms', 'new', 'actor', 'important', 'serial', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'too.But', 'alas', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'specific', 'type', 'Who', 'story', 'place', 'space', 'control', 'center', 'meaning', 'much', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'technical', 'stuff', 'example', 'Zeus', 'four', 'Snowcap', 'Do', 'read', 'Reading', 'strength', 'three', 'Snowcap', 'Go', 'ahead', 'Correct', 'course', 'ten', 'degrees', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'most', 'part', 'dull', 'official', 'types', 'soldiers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'alive', 'same', 'way', 'characters', 'Robert', 'Holmes', 'John', 'Lucarotti', 'script.That', 'said', 'script', 'good', 'job', 'introducing', 'explaining', 'Cybermen', 'compelling', 'villains', 'who', 'long', 'predated', 'Star', 'Trek', 'rather', 'similar', 'Borg', 'reviewers', 'actually', 'Cybermen', 'mummy-like', 'costumes', 'weird', 'high-pitched', 'voices', 'serial', 'also', 'have', 'unusually', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'Daleks', 'ultimately', 'evolved', 'catchphrase-spouting', 'bores', 'here', 'actually', 'have', 'personalities.As', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Key', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'fun', 'interview', 'Who', 'actress', 'Anneke', 'Wills', 'best', 'animated', 'presentation', 'serial', 'fourth', 'episode', 'lost', 'original', 'form', 'Several', 'lost', 'Who', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'animated', 'think', 'best', 'one', 'yet', 'animation', 'fairly', 'fluid', 'character', 'likenesses', 'are', 'good', 'several', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'characteristic', 'gestures', 'are', 'neatly', 'captured.Speaking', 'Hartnell', 'was', 'final', 'appearance', 'Doctor', 'not', 'great', 'way', 'go', 'out', 'small', 'role', 'missed', 'appearing', 'episode', 'three', 'account', 'being', 'sick', 'unfortunately', 'Anneke', 'Wills', 'only', 'person', 'be', 'extensively', 'interviewed', 'about', 'Hartnell', 'DVD', 'understandably', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'serial', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'great', 'tributes', 'First', 'Doctor.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Hartnell', 'good', 'performance', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'featured', 'demonstrating', 'was', 'truly', 'one', 'great', 'Doctors', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'bowed', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'weirdly', 'uncharacteristic', 'era', 'overall', 'body', 'work', 'part', 'was', 'impressive']",N/A

578691,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B00005ASPL,Matthew Kresal,"[5, 6]","Watching the Tenth Planet some four plus decades after its original broadcast makes for some interesting viewing for any Doctor Who fan. This is for two reasons the first because of its legendary status it has in Doctor Who fandom because it contains two of the elements of the show's longevity: the Cybermen and the Doctor's ability to regenerate. The other is reason is to view it from the production values of the time and its realization of those two items of interests to fans. In fact it's those values that make this an interesting story to view. So how does The Tenth Planet actually rank so to speak?This was William Hartnell's final Doctor Who story and judging from this story's three surviving episodes (and episode four reconstruction on this VHS release) his time had come. Whether it was by design in the script or the fact that Hartnell was ailing, the first Doctor does very little in his final story. In fact the first Doctor's final story consists almost entirely of him being either a captive or (as in the case of episode three) being unconscious. It's a shame really considering that Hartnell shows that even in his final story he is still capable of bringing authority to his Doctor with the emotions speech to the Cybermen in episode two. As I said it is a shame that the first Doctor can only react to the events around him and not be more proactive like in earlier stories.The upside to the underwhelming Hartnell is that the companions get to shine. In particular Michael Craze gets to show some chops as Ben. This is no more evident then in fighting a Cyberman in episodes two or episode three where he in fact becomes the focus of the episode.  Anneke Willis plays up her role as 60's secretary Polly for the most part though even she gets some good scenes like the scene with her and others in the tracking room talking to the Cybermen in episode two. While Hartnell might not have shinned very brightly in this story his companions sure did.The supporting cast though is a mixed bunch. There is Robert Beatty's pompous and over the top General Cutler, who kills any realism of him being a military officer and more like a walking talking clich&eacute;. On the upside there is David Dodimead's wonderful Doctor Barclay who is as underplaying and believable in his role as Beatty is over the top. That in fact makes Dodimead the best of the supporting cast. While the supporting cast is mainly a group of really nameless technicians there is another group of supporting cast that stands out: the Cybermen.These Cybermen may look rather silly physically with their cloth faces and car lights attached to their heads but there is potential in them that would later be realized and it is in fact these Cybermen's voices that really stand out some four plus decades later. These Cybermen may also lack the physicality of later stories likeDoctor Who - The InvasionorDoctor Who - Earthshock (Episode 122)but one should keep in mind that these Cybermen are a product of their time. That said, while the Cybermen would have better stories later in the 60's (especiallyDoctor Who - The Tomb of the CybermenandDoctor Who - The Invasion) they make a striking debut here.In fact it is the Cybermen and the regeneration that raise up this whole story. Without both of them I suspect this would be just another average 1960's ""Doctor / companions / supporting cast all under attack"" story. Looking at the writing of this story in terms of both plotting and dialogue there is  really little stand out material except the dialogue introducing the Cybermen's background and lack of emotions in episode two.  While it is not a bad story by any means it lacks many elements of the ""classic stories"".So how does The Tenth Planet hold up? Well it has an underwhelming final show by the first Doctor, a good showing by his companions,  a mixed supporting cast, the first appearance of the Cybermen, the first regeneration and an average script. It is true that while The Tenth Planet doe shave some stand-out elemnts it is not a classic story. In fact is rather average in many ways and a little undeserving of its legendary status in my opinion. In short: average but not great.",3,"A ""Legendary"" End To The First Doctor?",1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,4187,"['Watching', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'four', 'decades', 'original', 'broadcast', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'legendary', 'status', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fandom', 'two', 'elements', 'show', 'longevity', 'Cybermen', 'Doctor', 'ability', 'regenerate', 'other', 'reason', 'view', 'production', 'values', 'time', 'realization', 'two', 'items', 'interests', 'fans', 'fact', 'values', 'make', 'interesting', 'story', 'view', 'how', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'actually', 'so', 'speak', 'was', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'final', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', 'judging', 'story', 'three', 'surviving', 'episodes', 'episode', 'four', 'reconstruction', 'VHS', 'release', 'time', 'had', 'come', 'was', 'design', 'script', 'fact', 'Hartnell', 'was', 'ailing', 'first', 'Doctor', 'very', 'little', 'final', 'story', 'fact', 'first', 'Doctor', 'final', 'story', 'almost', 'entirely', 'being', 'captive', 'case', 'episode', 'three', 'being', 'unconscious', 'shame', 'really', 'considering', 'Hartnell', 'even', 'final', 'story', 'still', 'capable', 'bringing', 'authority', 'Doctor', 'emotions', 'speech', 'Cybermen', 'episode', 'two', 'said', 'shame', 'first', 'Doctor', 'can', 'only', 'react', 'events', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'proactive', 'earlier', 'stories.The', 'upside', 'underwhelming', 'Hartnell', 'companions', 'get', 'shine', 'particular', 'Michael', 'Craze', 'show', 'chops', 'Ben', 'more', 'evident', 'then', 'fighting', 'Cyberman', 'episodes', 'two', 'episode', 'three', 'where', 'fact', 'focus', 'episode', 'Anneke', 'Willis', 'up', 'role', '60', 'secretary', 'Polly', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'good', 'scenes', 'scene', 'others', 'tracking', 'room', 'talking', 'Cybermen', 'episode', 'two', 'Hartnell', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'shinned', 'very', 'brightly', 'story', 'companions', 'sure', 'did.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'though', 'mixed', 'bunch', 'Robert', 'Beatty', 'pompous', 'top', 'General', 'Cutler', 'who', 'realism', 'being', 'military', 'officer', 'more', 'walking', 'talking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'upside', 'David', 'Dodimead', 'wonderful', 'Doctor', 'Barclay', 'who', 'underplaying', 'believable', 'role', 'Beatty', 'top', 'fact', 'Dodimead', 'best', 'supporting', 'cast', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mainly', 'group', 'really', 'nameless', 'technicians', 'group', 'supporting', 'cast', 'out', 'Cybermen.These', 'Cybermen', 'may', 'look', 'rather', 'silly', 'physically', 'cloth', 'car', 'lights', 'attached', 'heads', 'potential', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'realized', 'fact', 'Cybermen', 'voices', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'four', 'decades', 'later', 'Cybermen', 'may', 'also', 'lack', 'physicality', 'later', 'stories', 'likeDoctor', 'Who', 'InvasionorDoctor', 'Who', 'Earthshock', 'Episode', '122', 'one', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'product', 'time', 'said', 'Cybermen', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'stories', 'later', '60', 'especiallyDoctor', 'Who', 'Tomb', 'CybermenandDoctor', 'Who', 'Invasion', 'make', 'striking', 'debut', 'fact', 'Cybermen', 'regeneration', 'raise', 'up', 'whole', 'story', 'suspect', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'average', '1960', 'Doctor', '/', 'companions', '/', 'supporting', 'cast', 'attack', 'story', 'Looking', 'writing', 'story', 'terms', 'plotting', 'dialogue', 'really', 'little', 'stand', 'out', 'material', 'dialogue', 'introducing', 'Cybermen', 'background', 'lack', 'emotions', 'episode', 'two', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'means', 'many', 'elements', 'classic', 'stories', 'how', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'hold', 'up', 'Well', 'underwhelming', 'final', 'show', 'first', 'Doctor', 'good', 'showing', 'companions', 'mixed', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first', 'appearance', 'Cybermen', 'first', 'regeneration', 'average', 'script', 'true', 'Tenth', 'Planet', 'doe', 'shave', 'stand-out', 'elemnts', 'not', 'classic', 'story', 'fact', 'rather', 'average', 'many', 'ways', 'little', 'undeserving', 'legendary', 'status', 'opinion', 'short', 'average', 'not', 'great']",N/A
