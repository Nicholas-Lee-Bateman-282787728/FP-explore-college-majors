After her father-in-law tires to rape her, her husband begins to question the mental state of his wife.  With the help of his father he finds a doctor willing to medicate her into submission and into a mental hospital.  Only after some horrific experiences does he being to realize the truth of what he has done to the woman he loves.As TV movies go this was below average. The plot was choppy and slow moving.  And their contempt for the mental health system is so obvious you have to think the screenwriter was trying to get back as his shrink does.  If this really based on a true story then there should have been some epilogue to cover what happened to the snake pit the lead was condemned to.",2,Made for TV and should have stayed there.,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,792,"['Trite', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'Victoria', 'Principal', 'woman', 'trying', 'be', 'perfect', 'housewife', 'father-in-law', 'tires', 'rape', 'husband', 'question', 'mental', 'state', 'wife', 'help', 'father', 'doctor', 'willing', 'medicate', 'submission', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Only', 'horrific', 'experiences', 'being', 'realize', 'truth', 'what', 'done', 'woman', 'TV', 'movies', 'go', 'was', 'below', 'average', 'plot', 'was', 'choppy', 'slow', 'moving', 'contempt', 'mental', 'health', 'system', 'so', 'obvious', 'have', 'think', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'shrink', 'really', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'epilogue', 'cover', 'what', 'happened', 'snake', 'lead', 'was', 'condemned']",Dancing in the Dark
