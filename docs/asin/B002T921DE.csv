1287869,A33WATQKA3FARE,B002T921DE,Carl Peterson,"[63, 63]","As someone who saw George on his U.S. 25LIVE tour in 2008, I can say that this blu ray does a great job of reproducing the live experience. The video and audio are fantastic!VIDEO: All the vibrant colors of the light show are brilliantly reproduced. The wide variety of camera angles have been well edited together, giving you a sense of the show from every seat in the house while keeping it visually interesting. For you videophiles out there, very occasionally, there is a little macroblocking as the camera pans across the LED wall, but this is not distracting or prevalent.AUDIO: I was concerned by some negative comments about the sound on this recording, but I was pleasantly surprised by the audio. I had to switch from the stereo track to the DTS-HD track, but after that, the audio was great. It might be a little bass-heavy, but that is how the performance was originally engineered, and it never interferes with the vocals or the other instrumentals. I suspect other reviewers' concerns are caused by the live performance nature of the show. At any rate, I can say that it sounds like the original show, and I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.SONG SELECTION: Just about every song you'd want to hear at a George Michael retrospective is here. I personally would have traded a few of the songs from his ""Patience"" album for older hits (I Want Your Sex), but I don't begrudge his wanting to perform recent work in front of an audience. It is also fun to see the inflatable parody of George W. Bush that was understandably omitted from the U.S. tour. The following is the disc's set list:WAITING (REPRISE)FASTLOVEI'M YOUR MANFLAWLESS (GO TO THE CITY)FATHER FIGUREYOU HAVE BEEN LOVEDAN EASIER AFFAIREVERYTHING SHE WANTSONE MORE TRYA DIFFERENT CORNERTOO FUNKYSHOOT THE DOGJOHN AND ELVIS ARE DEADFAITHSPINNING THE WHEELFEELING GOODROXANNEMY MOTHER HAD A BROTHERAMAZINGFANTASYOUTSIDECARELESS WHISPERFREEDOM '90Bonus TracksPRECIOUS BOXJESUS TO A CHILDFIRST TIME EVERBONUS FEATURES: The 42 minute documentary is a bit fluffy and silly, but it gives a nice taste of the European tour. It's nice to have the crew behind his performances introduced, even if we don't really learn more than their names. It's especially interesting to see the little changes he made to his set list for specific locations.In summary, if you're a George Michael fan, you should definitely pick this up. It's likely the only performance you'll get on home media from George Michael, and it's a great one. On blu ray, it looks and sounds fantastic.",5,"Saw it in person, enjoyed the blu ray almost as much",1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,2530,"['someone', 'who', 'saw', 'George', 'U.S.', '25LIVE', 'tour', '2008', 'can', 'say', 'blu', 'ray', 'great', 'job', 'reproducing', 'live', 'experience', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'fantastic', 'VIDEO', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'light', 'show', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'reproduced', 'wide', 'variety', 'camera', 'angles', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'edited', 'together', 'giving', 'sense', 'show', 'seat', 'house', 'keeping', 'visually', 'interesting', 'videophiles', 'there', 'very', 'occasionally', 'little', 'macroblocking', 'camera', 'LED', 'wall', 'not', 'distracting', 'prevalent.AUDIO', 'was', 'concerned', 'negative', 'comments', 'sound', 'recording', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'audio', 'had', 'switch', 'stereo', 'track', 'DTS-HD', 'track', 'audio', 'was', 'great', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'bass-heavy', 'how', 'performance', 'was', 'originally', 'engineered', 'never', 'vocals', 'other', 'instrumentals', 'suspect', 'other', 'reviewers', 'concerns', 'are', 'caused', 'live', 'performance', 'nature', 'show', 'rate', 'can', 'say', 'original', 'show', 'found', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable.SONG', 'SELECTION', 'Just', 'song', ""'d"", 'want', 'hear', 'George', 'Michael', 'retrospective', 'here', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'traded', 'few', 'songs', 'Patience', 'album', 'older', 'hits', 'Want', 'Sex', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'wanting', 'perform', 'recent', 'work', 'front', 'audience', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'inflatable', 'parody', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'was', 'understandably', 'omitted', 'U.S.', 'tour', 'following', 'disc', 'set', 'list', 'WAITING', 'REPRISE', 'FASTLOVEI', 'YOUR', 'MANFLAWLESS', 'GO', 'TO', 'THE', 'CITY', 'FATHER', 'FIGUREYOU', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'LOVEDAN', 'EASIER', 'AFFAIREVERYTHING', 'SHE', 'WANTSONE', 'MORE', 'TRYA', 'DIFFERENT', 'CORNERTOO', 'FUNKYSHOOT', 'THE', 'DOGJOHN', 'AND', 'ELVIS', 'ARE', 'DEADFAITHSPINNING', 'THE', 'WHEELFEELING', 'GOODROXANNEMY', 'MOTHER', 'HAD', 'BROTHERAMAZINGFANTASYOUTSIDECARELESS', 'WHISPERFREEDOM', 'TracksPRECIOUS', 'BOXJESUS', 'TO', 'A', 'CHILDFIRST', 'TIME', 'EVERBONUS', 'FEATURES', '42', 'minute', 'documentary', 'bit', 'fluffy', 'silly', 'nice', 'taste', 'European', 'tour', 'nice', 'have', 'crew', 'performances', 'introduced', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'learn', 'more', 'names', 'especially', 'interesting', 'see', 'little', 'changes', 'made', 'set', 'list', 'specific', 'locations.In', 'summary', ""'re"", 'George', 'Michael', 'fan', 'should', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'likely', 'only', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'get', 'home', 'media', 'George', 'Michael', 'great', 'one', 'blu', 'ray', 'fantastic']",N/A
1287870,A3F6O9EE6JOTH1,B002T921DE,Chad E. Munn,"[0, 0]","I will say, right off, that I am a huge fan of GM. Having said that though- I think it's completely unbiased to say that this was a phenomenal concert. I never had the chance to see GM in concert when I was a teenager and Faith was THE ONLY music that mattered, but I got to see George on this 25 Tour in Atlanta, GA. This was as George was just starting to get sick and while he may not have felt his best, he sounded perfect. I don't say that lightly but I say it honestly; George was just beyond imagination that night. His energy, his pitch, his entire show- just brilliant. He filmed this concert less than two weeks later and you can hear that he sounds a little under the weather. Even with that being an issue- there's no way to rate this a 4 star. I've seen the concert 5 or 6 times since I bought it and I love it each time. It's a time machine that moves me right back to the night I saw him in concert- only much closer. If you're a fan of the man and the music, I can't think of a song that you'd want to hear that isn't in this concert. Maybe ""Waiting for that Day"" or ""Cowboys and Angels"", but there would be a problem fitting it into a wonderfully arranged set. Heck- Fantasy was in here!The one thing I will say- the ""I'd Know Him A Mile Off"" was a bit more of a ""guy with a camera/behind the scenes"" type extra and NOT a typical documentary. Sorry David, but you know what it was and what it wasn't.The last issue that I'd add is the sound. It's not perfect. I've discovered that the entire production sounds better in Stereo than in Surround Sound. Odd, but it helps to fill up the video better than the Surround Sound that somehow sounded 'flat'. It's not a big issue once I found a way around it- but as great as the picture is (especially in Blu vs. DVD), I wish the sound was just as stellar.Don't hesitate to buy this on Blu Ray. If you only have DVD- get it. It's such an amazing concert and the ONLY official one we've got. This is a remarkable talent and this tour showed why George is one of this generation's most amazing talents- not to be missed by anyone who made it through the 80's and 90's.

1287874,AX7SB9H8ZAF3U,B002T921DE,"Fernando Vega ""Little Nando""","[1, 1]","George Michael was a favorite as I was growing up. Every time he was on tour, I never got to see him. I was either too young or did not have the means.  When I found out he was going on tour and coming to San Diego, California, I was too excited. It was Amazing that I was finally going to see him live. A big treat was that he was kicking off this 25LIVE World Tour here in my hometown San Diego. Tuesday, June 17th 2008 proved to be one of the best nights in my life. One of the best concerts I have attended.  I was there with 2 of my sisters and thoroughly enjoyed this performance.  The songs I really enjoyed are : Fast Love, Flawless [Go to the City], of course, Everything She Wants, Too Funky, Spinning the Wheel, the hopeful song, Amazing and the classic melancholic Careless Whisper. Two more Amazing treats besides opening night in San Diego, were 2 bonus songs. George Michael decided that the U.S. would get the remix version of Amazing, Wow! How awesome is that? The other song was Kissing a Fool. This was so cool for me. This song took me back in time to my Military days and reminded me of my first infatuation. The sound in the Stadium was superb and the Blu-ray does a great job of keeping that sound just as it was inside the thunderous stadium. I bought two copies, one for a sister who attended with me and one for myself. As soon as my other sister who attended with us goes Blu, I will get her a copy. I did much research on price for this Blu-ray and Amazon was by far the best price anywhere. As bonus material, this comes with a Documentary as well as a 4 page insert booklet.It has 3 audio options to choose from, I am sure you will find the one that satisfies you. The quality of the video, the graphics and everything about this concert will blow you away. I highly recommend this milestone concert to any person who was ever inspired or touched by one of George Michael's songs. True fans and new fans will not be disappointed with this concert. You get the highest quality for your money. Fans that could not make it to one of his shows can truly enjoy and feel the ambiance of this show. The energy was Amazing and the memory will linger. Hope this helps other fans to stop thinking about buying this, just click to buy. This is worth every penny. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

In China, LIVE AID, On a concert on Disney in the 1990's, but, I just don't think he is that great live..I've never seen him in concert in an arena, but what I've seen on film--he just doesn't impress live on these performances I've mentioned, nor on this 1st ever live full concert dvd...The set list was OKAY--would have wanted more songs from Older and Faith, but...It's just through the concert, he seems to depend too much on his background singers and audience participation than singing the songs himself...And he never stays with the same style when he sings live as the songs were originally recorded--I will say, that many of the songs musicly sounded close to the studio versions...And he'd sing like back to back versions of the same song--but with different arrangements (remixed/ like with I'm your Man and Spinning the Wheel--when he could have fit in maybe another song or two in the setlist)--The lighting and the stage is also just too busy on this concert---I thought I'd have a seizure watching all these LCD lights all over the place!The best I ever heard/seen George Michael live was when he did the MTV Unplugged in 1996...I had to buy many import Singles/EP releases to get those songs from the show to add to my collection and wish he would release THAT concert on DVD--for that's the only memorable live performance I've seen him do...To watch George Michael ""Perform"", I'll stick to watching his 25 Music Video DVD collection...It's sad when you think a musician/band doesn't sound that good live when you attend a concert, but I think it's even WORST when they dissappoint on a live cd or dvd where the musician can actually have the opportunity to tweak and overdub the product in a studio.....And not for nothing, but doesn't George now resemble Clair's Father on the TV show Heroes?...Whatever--Again, if you want a great George Michael DVD, I'd say skip this one and go with the 25 Music Video Collection--Better setlist of songs, better footage and you can have a fun nostalgic trip watching videos from the WHAM! and FAITH era videos from the 1980s!",2,Why doesn't George Michael hardly ever sound good live?,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,2322,"['loved', 'George', 'Michael', 'WHAM', 'FANTASTIC', 'pop', 'music', 'genious', 'great', 'songs', 'various', 'genres', 'produces', 'instruments', 'outstanding', 'voice', '.on', 'studio', 'recordings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'George', 'Michael', 'sing', 'live', 'WHAM', 'China', 'LIVE', 'AID', 'concert', 'Disney', '1990', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'great', 'live..I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'concert', 'arena', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'impress', 'live', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', '1st', 'ever', 'live', 'full', 'concert', 'dvd', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'OKAY', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'more', 'songs', 'Older', 'Faith', 'just', 'concert', 'depend', 'too', 'much', 'background', 'singers', 'audience', 'participation', 'singing', 'songs', 'never', 'same', 'style', 'when', 'live', 'songs', 'were', 'originally', 'recorded', 'will', 'say', 'many', 'songs', 'musicly', 'sounded', 'close', 'studio', 'versions', ""'d"", 'sing', 'back', 'back', 'versions', 'same', 'song', 'different', 'arrangements', 'remixed/', ""'m"", 'Man', 'Spinning', 'Wheel', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'maybe', 'song', 'two', 'setlist', 'lighting', 'stage', 'also', 'just', 'too', 'busy', 'concert', '-I', 'thought', ""'d"", 'have', 'seizure', 'watching', 'LCD', 'lights', 'place', 'best', 'ever', 'heard/seen', 'George', 'Michael', 'live', 'was', 'when', 'did', 'MTV', 'Unplugged', '1996', 'had', 'buy', 'many', 'import', 'Singles/EP', 'get', 'songs', 'show', 'add', 'collection', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'THAT', 'concert', 'DVD', 'only', 'memorable', 'live', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'watch', 'George', 'Michael', 'Perform', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'watching', '25', 'Music', 'Video', 'DVD', 'collection', 'sad', 'when', 'think', 'musician/band', ""n't"", 'sound', 'good', 'live', 'when', 'attend', 'concert', 'think', 'even', 'WORST', 'when', 'dissappoint', 'live', 'cd', 'dvd', 'where', 'musician', 'can', 'actually', 'have', 'opportunity', 'tweak', 'overdub', 'product', 'studio', 'not', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'George', 'now', 'resemble', 'Clair', 'Father', 'TV', 'show', 'Heroes', 'Again', 'want', 'great', 'George', 'Michael', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'say', 'skip', 'one', 'go', '25', 'Music', 'Video', 'Collection', 'Better', 'setlist', 'songs', 'better', 'footage', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'watching', 'videos', 'WHAM', 'FAITH', 'era', 'videos', '1980s']",N/A
