Another problem I experienced was that occasionally, there wouldn't be a subtitle; this only happened once or twice though, nothing too big.  The biggest problem though, was that in episodes 22 and 23, there was no Japanese audio, both tracks were in English.  Maybe this is just my DVD player, but I doubt it.

We're introduced to Ukyo Kuonji, okonomiyaki master and yet another fiancee to Ranma.  Personally, I can't stand her, but oh well.  It does seem that Kelly Sheridan does a pretty good starting job for the anime, but then again, she did have some extra time to get Ukyo's voice right(she previously did her voice in a few Ranma OVAs and movies).  Still, I do like Hitomi Tsuru a bit better(who's also Meryl in Trigun and Bulma in the Dragonball series)  This also happens to be the only season that doesn't have any mutli-part episodes.  Not one.  The English cast finally seems to be mastering the voices, even Sarah Strange, which is a bit upsetting, since this was also the final season in which she did Ranma's English voice, as Richard Cox(Inu-Yasha, X-Men Evolution, Mobile Suit Gundam, Zoids) did the voice afterwards.  I think this is the best season of Ranma yet, although season 6 is my personal favorite.  It's definitely worth watching, but like other people said, watch out for the defective disk 5, which has English-dubbing only for the 22nd and 23rd episodes!",5,Farewell to Sarah Strange,1068163200,"11 7, 2003",2003,1120,"['Well', 'major', 'change', 'season', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Ukyo', 'Kuonji', 'okonomiyaki', 'master', 'yet', 'fiancee', 'Ranma', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'oh', 'well', 'seem', 'Kelly', 'Sheridan', 'pretty', 'good', 'starting', 'job', 'anime', 'then', 'again', 'did', 'have', 'extra', 'time', 'get', 'Ukyo', 'voice', 'right', 'previously', 'did', 'voice', 'few', 'Ranma', 'OVAs', 'movies', 'Still', 'do', 'Hitomi', 'Tsuru', 'bit', 'better', 'who', 'also', 'Meryl', 'Trigun', 'Bulma', 'Dragonball', 'series', 'also', 'be', 'only', 'season', ""n't"", 'have', 'mutli-part', 'episodes', 'Not', 'one', 'English', 'cast', 'finally', 'be', 'mastering', 'voices', 'even', 'Sarah', 'Strange', 'bit', 'upsetting', 'was', 'also', 'final', 'season', 'did', 'Ranma', 'English', 'voice', 'Richard', 'Cox', 'Inu-Yasha', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', 'Zoids', 'did', 'voice', 'afterwards', 'think', 'best', 'season', 'Ranma', 'yet', 'season', '6', 'personal', 'favorite', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'other', 'people', 'said', 'watch', 'out', 'defective', 'disk', '5', 'English-dubbing', 'only', '22nd', '23rd', 'episodes']",Ranma 1/2 - Hard Battle - The Complete Third Season
