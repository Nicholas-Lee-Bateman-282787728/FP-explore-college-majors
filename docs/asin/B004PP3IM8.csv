1423689,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004PP3IM8,B. E Jackson,"[3, 3]","Brotherhood is a MAGNIFICENT movie!  It completely satisfies my desire for suspense.  It's only 75 minutes long, and yet, it contains more excitement than I EVER would have imagined.  It's about a college fraternity that, in order for the members to be initiated, they have to rob convenience stores in the middle of the night.  However... one thing after another goes wrong.I really don't want to spoil *too* much here, since the storyline flows more like a chain reaction of events.  One thing leads to another.  I'll mention just ONE part since it serves as the basis of the story- the fraternity group actually kidnaps the young man working the cash register at the store.  That's all I really want to mention.  Trust me, I'm doing you a favor by not mentioning anything more as far as plot advancement is concerned!I can guarantee you this- this is one mighty well-written and elaborate storyline.  You almost want to feel sorry for these college kids because they constantly find themselves in one crappy situation after another.  They're forced to use every bit of their creativity to try and evade getting caught in all the horrible things that go wrong.  Sometimes their plans are executed flawlessly, other times... they find themselves in situations where quick-thinking is absolutely critical.I'm surprised, amongst all the confusion and chaos (and trust me, the ENTIRE 75-minute ride is chaotic) that these kids are actually able to come up with good suggestions so nobody (especially the cops) won't suspect anything.  Perhaps the ending is a bit of a disappointment since I was hoping... well, I was hoping for something else.  I'm also surprised that there's frequently periods of rational and constructive arguing taking place between all the boys.  Really amazing aspect there because in reality, young adults are hardly ever that level headed.  Not when they've just committed a crime.  Then again they *are* in college so that means they must be intelligent at least to *some* extent.Overall, it's exciting and TOTALLY worth watching.

One of the brothers (whose name I couldn't tell you, since the characters are all so flat and indistinct) actually has a sense of morality and fights his peers in an effort to do the right thing, but he is--of course--over-ruled.

Frank (Jon Foster) is the president of a college fraternity who takes a special pride in berating his brothers and terrorizing new pledges. Frank decides to cap off Hell Week by demanding a special show of loyalty -- each prospective frat member is given a gun and ordered to rob a convenience store. What the pledges don't know is a house brother is supposed to follow them and keep them from using the gun, but Kevin (Lou Taylor Pucci) ends up at the wrong store and no one is there to stop him from pulling his gun. Kevin is shot by Mike (Arlen Escarpeta), the store's night clerk, and when the wounded man returns to the frat house, another pledge, Adam (Trevor Morgan), tries to convince Frank to get him to a doctor before he bleeds to death. Frank, however, doesn't want himself or the house implicated in the incident; instead, he sends Adam to the store to bring back Mike and clear away any evidence. Adam discovers that Mike is someone he knew from high school who isn't intimidated by him and has no interest in helping him clear up the mess Frank has made.

1423693,AFRZL05D54MPM,B004PP3IM8,JWolf,"[5, 5]","OVERVIEW:  Directed by Will Canon and co-written by Doug Simon, the 2010 thriller, ""Brotherhood,"" explores the dangers of the group-think phenomenon occurring in the fictional fraternity house, Sigma Zeta Chi.  Inspired by a friend's stories and 1970s exploitation films, Canon debuted his premiere movie, ""Brotherhood,"" at the 2010 SXSW Film Festival; the film was released in March of 2011 for select theaters.  Critics have generally criticized the film for ""lack of credibility;"" nuts-and-bolts aside, audiences have found the movie to be highly captivating and suspenseful.My first time watching ""Brotherhood,"" I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it; upon investigation, I realized it was a fairly low-budget film from a first-time filmmakers--this information only added to the movie's shock-value because I found the movie itself to be brilliantly paced with excellent cinematography.  I'm a sucker for a good thriller, so when a screenplay manages to incorporate a ""didn't-see-THAT-coming"" twist, I can't help but add it to my collection.  On top of everything else, this is one of the first fraternity life depictions I've ever seen that comes close to representing the `real' Greek system and how easily corrupted it can be.STARRING ROLES:  Trevor Morgan as Adam, Jon Foster as Frank, Arlen Escarpeta as Mike, Lou Taylor Pucci as Kevin, Jennifer Snipes as Emily, Jesse Steccato as Bean, Jeff Gibbs as Officer Jennings, Luke Sexton as Graham, and Meyer deLeeuw as Collin.AWARDS:&#9642;  2010 SXSW Film Festival--Audience Award&#9642;  2010 Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival--Audience Award&#9642;  2010 New Hampshire Film Festival--Grand Jury Prize&#9642;  The ""New York Times""--NYT Critics' Pick&#9642;  2010 Dallas International Film Festival--Audience Award&#9642;  2010 Gotham Awards--nominated for Festival Genius Audience AwardSUMMARY:Adam and Kevin are among the freshmen pledges for the Sigma Zeta Chi fraternity; their initiation test, led by senior member Frank, is to rob a convenience store of Frank's choosing.  In reality, the pledges are not meant to go through with the heist; it is merely a prank to test their commitment to the fraternity.  A problem arises when the senior member in charge of preventing the pledges from actually holding a ""stick-up"" mistakenly goes to the wrong gas station.Without anyone there to stop them, Kevin and Adam perform a real heist, leading the store's clerk, Mike, to shoot Kevin in the shoulder.  Frank and Adam manage to retrieve Kevin from the scene and take him back to the house for medical attention.  Because Adam knew the store's clerk in high school, Frank orders him to return to the gas station with Graham and use his rapport to tidy-up any loose ends.  Mike is unwilling to cooperate with the frat brothers' cover-up, so Adam and Grahams take him back to the house as their hostage.Back at the house, the brothers of &#931;&#918;&#935; are frantically trying to conceal Kevin's blood-loss from the cops and his sister, Emily (a Sorority Sister).  The remainder of the film deals with the lengths to which a `brotherhood' will go to stick together as well as the group's inability accept the repercussions of their actions.  The ending scene is beautifully masterful; in contrast to the fast pacing of the previous scenes, the film slows down, demonstrating how easily self-awareness can evade an individual when that individual has traded his identity for that of a group's.  Just after dawn of the following morning, the sun sheds light on what turns out to be a marvelous twist--one that finally manages to reconnect the boys of the Sigma Zeta Chi fraternity house with the consciousness of the real world.",5,Captured By Suspense,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,3681,"['OVERVIEW', 'Directed', 'Will', 'Canon', 'co-written', 'Doug', 'Simon', '2010', 'thriller', 'Brotherhood', 'dangers', 'group-think', 'phenomenon', 'occurring', 'fictional', 'fraternity', 'house', 'Sigma', 'Zeta', 'Chi', 'Inspired', 'friend', 'stories', '1970s', 'exploitation', 'films', 'Canon', 'debuted', 'premiere', 'movie', 'Brotherhood', '2010', 'SXSW', 'Film', 'Festival', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'March', '2011', 'select', 'theaters', 'Critics', 'have', 'generally', 'criticized', 'film', 'lack', 'credibility', 'nuts-and-bolts', 'aside', 'audiences', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'highly', 'captivating', 'suspenseful.My', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'Brotherhood', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'investigation', 'realized', 'was', 'fairly', 'low-budget', 'film', 'first-time', 'filmmakers', 'information', 'only', 'added', 'movie', 'shock-value', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'brilliantly', 'paced', 'excellent', 'cinematography', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'good', 'thriller', 'so', 'when', 'screenplay', 'incorporate', ""didn't-see-THAT-coming"", 'twist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'add', 'collection', 'top', 'everything', 'else', 'one', 'first', 'fraternity', 'life', 'depictions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'close', 'representing', 'real', 'Greek', 'system', 'how', 'easily', 'corrupted', 'can', 'be.STARRING', 'ROLES', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'Adam', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'Frank', 'Arlen', 'Escarpeta', 'Mike', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'Kevin', 'Jennifer', 'Snipes', 'Emily', 'Jesse', 'Steccato', 'Bean', 'Jeff', 'Gibbs', 'Officer', 'Jennings', 'Luke', 'Sexton', 'Graham', 'Meyer', 'deLeeuw', 'Collin.AWARDS', '9642', '2010', 'SXSW', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Audience', 'Award', '9642', '2010', 'Sidewalk', 'Moving', 'Picture', 'Festival', 'Audience', 'Award', '9642', '2010', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', '9642', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'NYT', 'Critics', 'Pick', '9642', '2010', 'Dallas', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Audience', 'Award', '9642', '2010', 'Gotham', 'Awards', 'nominated', 'Festival', 'Genius', 'Audience', 'AwardSUMMARY', 'Adam', 'Kevin', 'are', 'freshmen', 'pledges', 'Sigma', 'Zeta', 'Chi', 'fraternity', 'initiation', 'test', 'led', 'senior', 'member', 'Frank', 'rob', 'convenience', 'store', 'Frank', 'choosing', 'reality', 'pledges', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'go', 'heist', 'merely', 'prank', 'test', 'commitment', 'fraternity', 'problem', 'when', 'senior', 'member', 'charge', 'preventing', 'pledges', 'actually', 'holding', 'stick-up', 'mistakenly', 'wrong', 'gas', 'station.Without', 'anyone', 'there', 'stop', 'Kevin', 'Adam', 'perform', 'real', 'heist', 'leading', 'store', 'clerk', 'Mike', 'shoot', 'Kevin', 'shoulder', 'Frank', 'Adam', 'manage', 'retrieve', 'Kevin', 'scene', 'take', 'back', 'house', 'medical', 'attention', 'Adam', 'knew', 'store', 'clerk', 'high', 'school', 'Frank', 'orders', 'return', 'gas', 'station', 'Graham', 'use', 'rapport', 'tidy-up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Mike', 'unwilling', 'cooperate', 'frat', 'brothers', 'cover-up', 'Adam', 'Grahams', 'take', 'back', 'house', 'hostage.Back', 'house', 'brothers', '931', '918', '935', 'are', 'frantically', 'trying', 'conceal', 'Kevin', 'blood-loss', 'cops', 'sister', 'Emily', 'Sorority', 'Sister', 'remainder', 'film', 'deals', 'lengths', 'brotherhood', 'will', 'go', 'stick', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'group', 'inability', 'repercussions', 'actions', 'ending', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'masterful', 'contrast', 'fast', 'pacing', 'previous', 'scenes', 'film', 'down', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'easily', 'self-awareness', 'can', 'evade', 'individual', 'when', 'individual', 'traded', 'identity', 'group', 'Just', 'dawn', 'following', 'morning', 'sun', 'sheds', 'light', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'marvelous', 'twist', 'one', 'finally', 'reconnect', 'boys', 'Sigma', 'Zeta', 'Chi', 'fraternity', 'house', 'consciousness', 'real', 'world']",Brotherhood

I probably went through all possible emotions while watching this low-budget indie piece: tension, shock, disgust, horror, bewilderment, and I was literally sitting at the edge of my seat, as a matter of fact I almost fell of the couch a few times, even had to get up a occasionally and walk around because certain scenes got me so mad.Does that mean the actors did an terrific job for making me go through all these stages? I believe so! Were the circumstances shown in a realistic way? I want to say no, but unfortunately I believe that people might really act this reckless, crazy and careless, without wondering or worrying about any consequences. And what's worse, I am sure many people get away with it, just because their parents have a lot of influence. I wasn't born nor raised in the United States, and I know very little about hazing and how fraternities work, but this movie gives the impression that fraternities consists of rich, spoiled, racist, stupid wannabe- thug Caucasians.The whole movie I thought there is gonna be another twist like the whole scenario is actually a prank, just because Jon Foster was acting kind of weird, and it came off as he was trying to hide something. Turns out he was just trying to hide the fact the he can't act that well, I guess.Brotherhood is not a milestone in movie history, it doesn't have the most creative plot, and especially the racial sub plot seemed a little forced - yet still very upsetting, I know it p!$$eD me off - but it left a bitter effect on me, wondering how I would have reacted in such a horrible situation at this young age?",3,Hazing Gone Terribly Wrong,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,1955,"['might', 'like', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Set', 'Off', '1996', 'was', 'out', '2008', 'Long', 'Story', 'Short', 'What', 'harmless', 'hazing', 'routine', 'control', 'causing', 'everyone', 'involved', 'have', 'worst', 'night', 'live.Review', 'movie', 'only', '78', 'minutes', 'long', 'minute', 'nerve-', 'wrecking', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'probably', 'went', 'possible', 'emotions', 'watching', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'piece', 'tension', 'shock', 'disgust', 'horror', 'bewilderment', 'was', 'literally', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'matter', 'fact', 'almost', 'fell', 'couch', 'few', 'times', 'even', 'had', 'get', 'up', 'occasionally', 'walk', 'certain', 'scenes', 'got', 'so', 'mean', 'actors', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'making', 'go', 'stages', 'believe', 'so', 'Were', 'circumstances', 'shown', 'realistic', 'way', 'want', 'say', 'no', 'unfortunately', 'believe', 'people', 'might', 'really', 'act', 'reckless', 'crazy', 'careless', 'wondering', 'worrying', 'consequences', 'what', 'worse', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'get', 'away', 'just', 'parents', 'have', 'lot', 'influence', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', 'raised', 'United', 'States', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'hazing', 'how', 'fraternities', 'work', 'movie', 'impression', 'consists', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'racist', 'stupid', 'wannabe-', 'thug', 'Caucasians.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'thought', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'twist', 'whole', 'scenario', 'actually', 'prank', 'just', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'was', 'acting', 'kind', 'weird', 'came', 'off', 'was', 'trying', 'hide', 'something', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'hide', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'well', 'guess.Brotherhood', 'not', 'milestone', 'movie', 'history', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'creative', 'plot', 'especially', 'racial', 'sub', 'plot', 'seemed', 'little', 'forced', 'yet', 'still', 'very', 'upsetting', 'know', 'eD', 'off', 'left', 'bitter', 'effect', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'reacted', 'such', 'horrible', 'situation', 'young', 'age']",Brotherhood

That is the question posed in Brotherhood, the debut film from Writer/Director, Will Cannon. This was a short, fast-paced film, that was quite enjoyable, if not somewhat less than believable. With this film, Cannon shows the power fraternities have and shows the importance of fitting in at college, while asking the question is it worth it no matter the cost? The cast was a fun one for me, as its made up almost entirely of former child actors. Trevor Morgan and Jon Foster are the leads and while they play the complete opposites of one another, they also manage to give performances that are complete opposites as well. Morgan was intense and really had you buying into the story, even the parts that were pure Hollywood. Foster on the other hand was as annoying as an actor could be, if I could have gotten off the couch and slapped him, I would have. Brotherhood isn't going to win any awards, but it's an entertaining story that is far from predictable, with a cast of people you're not used to seeing all grown up, drinking, and throwing the F bomb around. It's a short film that cuts through the bull and gets right to it's point, that part was a real change of pace, but personally I could have done without unbelievable Hollywood element that was added to it in certain places. This is a good film, with a clear message, which should have been as real as possible, but there is an element of Hollywood involved and it really does take away from an otherwise entertaining film.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1691,"['When', 'fraternity', 'play', 'prank', 'several', 'pledges', 'something', 'wrong', 'leading', 'chaotic', 'night', 'can', 'work', 'together', 'fix', 'problems', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'worse', 'question', 'posed', 'Brotherhood', 'debut', 'film', 'Writer/Director', 'Will', 'Cannon', 'was', 'short', 'fast-paced', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'somewhat', 'less', 'believable', 'film', 'Cannon', 'power', 'fraternities', 'have', 'importance', 'fitting', 'college', 'asking', 'question', 'matter', 'cost', 'cast', 'was', 'fun', 'one', 'made', 'up', 'almost', 'entirely', 'former', 'child', 'actors', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'are', 'leads', 'play', 'complete', 'opposites', 'one', 'also', 'manage', 'give', 'performances', 'are', 'complete', 'opposites', 'well', 'Morgan', 'was', 'intense', 'really', 'had', 'buying', 'story', 'even', 'parts', 'were', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'Foster', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'as', 'annoying', 'actor', 'could', 'be', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'off', 'couch', 'slapped', 'would', 'have', 'Brotherhood', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'entertaining', 'story', 'far', 'predictable', 'cast', 'people', ""'re"", 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'grown', 'up', 'drinking', 'throwing', 'F', 'bomb', 'around', 'short', 'film', 'bull', 'right', 'point', 'part', 'was', 'real', 'change', 'pace', 'personally', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'unbelievable', 'Hollywood', 'element', 'was', 'added', 'certain', 'places', 'good', 'film', 'clear', 'message', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'real', 'possible', 'element', 'Hollywood', 'involved', 'really', 'take', 'away', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'film']",Brotherhood

A simple job of trying to cover up the prank ends up snowballing into something that could ruin the lives of all involved. I was extremely surprised by this movie.  I immediatly got sucked in and was engrossed the entire time.  It begins with a van of pledges staging robberies until one gets shot.  The night gets progressively worse as they try to fix more and more problems that occur.  Talking about this too much I will end up giving something away, and this is a movie that will have you on the edge of your seat through most of it.  Every once is a while a movie comes along that surprises you so much that you can't stop talking about it to others and this is one of those movies. Watch this movie, you won't be dissapointed.  I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Yes, I think I would.*Also try - Sorority Row & Twelve",4,"Surprisingly good movie about a frat initiation that goes bad,and just keeps getting worse and worse.I really liked it.I say B+",1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,971,"['How', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'join', 'frat', 'initiation', 'prank', 'wrong', 'pledge', 'shot', 'are', 'worried', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'jail', 'simple', 'job', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'prank', 'up', 'snowballing', 'something', 'could', 'ruin', 'lives', 'involved', 'was', 'extremely', 'surprised', 'movie', 'immediatly', 'got', 'sucked', 'was', 'engrossed', 'entire', 'time', 'van', 'pledges', 'staging', 'robberies', 'one', 'shot', 'night', 'progressively', 'worse', 'try', 'fix', 'more', 'more', 'problems', 'occur', 'Talking', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'giving', 'something', 'away', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'most', 'once', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'others', 'one', 'movies', 'Watch', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed', 'give', 'B+.Would', 'watch', 'again', 'Yes', 'think', 'would', '*Also', 'try', 'Sorority', 'Row', 'Twelve']",Brotherhood

Gera ""deal hound""","[9, 10]","I generally see IMDB as a pretty good source for finding new movies to watch and with an average rating of 6, I wasn't expecting much from Brotherhood. Boy, was I wrong.  This is one intense movie. WOW!!!!  The acting is surprisingly good and although the dialogue isn't brilliant, its very appropriate and believable in this context.  If you go into this from the perspective of an average viewer, I don't think that you'll be disappointed.  In fact, like me, you may be pleasantly surprised.To summarize... it's a great movie.
