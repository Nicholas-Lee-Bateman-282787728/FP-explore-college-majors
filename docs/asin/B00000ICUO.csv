503297,A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3,B00000ICUO,Brian Reaves,"[28, 30]","As a single father, I really appreciated this movie's viewpoint on raising a child from dad's point of view.  Too many movies make the dad look like some free-swinger while the mom in the divorce is this abused single woman working two jobs to keep her kids fed.  This movie shows reality: that sometimes it's the mom who walks away from it all and dad has to step in and become both parents.  This movie was great, and the characters were well-developed.  The story was true-to-life, with things going good, and things going bad sometimes.  Vince Vaughn was great, and Monica Potter showed a great depth in her character as the mom who leaves one day without reason, and now wants back into her son's life 18 months later.  Joey Lauren Adams is nice as the girlfriend, but her voice gets annoying kind of quickly (sorry, Ms. Adams).  All in all, a great movie and definitely one worth owning.",5,An excellent &quot;dad&quot; movie,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,893,"['single', 'father', 'really', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'viewpoint', 'raising', 'child', 'dad', 'point', 'view', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'make', 'dad', 'look', 'free-swinger', 'mom', 'divorce', 'abused', 'single', 'woman', 'working', 'two', 'jobs', 'keep', 'kids', 'fed', 'movie', 'reality', 'mom', 'who', 'away', 'dad', 'step', 'become', 'parents', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'characters', 'were', 'well-developed', 'story', 'was', 'true-to-life', 'things', 'going', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'bad', 'sometimes', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'great', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'showed', 'great', 'depth', 'character', 'mom', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'reason', 'now', 'back', 'son', 'life', '18', 'months', 'later', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'nice', 'girlfriend', 'voice', 'annoying', 'kind', 'quickly', 'sorry', 'Ms.', 'Adams', 'great', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'worth', 'owning']","A Cool, Dry Place VHS"
503298,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00000ICUO,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[12, 12]","'A Cool Dry Place' to me is a very underappreciated film.  It all but slipped under the radar and recieved little if any attention, but that's a shame, a huge shame.  This film has always been one I enjoyed, but recently having seen it four times in the past month (it's played on TV almost every day) it's really grown into one of my personal favorite films.  Vince Vaughn pulls out a brilliant performance, far more serious than most of his recent films, and he taps into something I've never seen in him before.  Vaughn I think has hit some bad luck, for he's actually a pretty good actor he's just not given near enough credit where credit is due, and here is a prime example of due credit.  Vaughn plays a single father, recently single, as he struggles to raise his young son (Bobby Moat).  Not able to balance his career as an attorney and fatherhood he decides to leave his practice and move to Kansas where he coaches basketball and meets a lovly woman played by the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams.  As there relationship developes Vaughn's ex-wife (Monica Potter) shows up to reclaim her place causing devision and turmoil in his life once again, and when offered an opportunity to take the position of a lifetime working for a law office in Dallas Texas he's faced with a crossroads...does he play working man or father.  This is a brilliant look at fatherhood and the sacrifices one makes for his family.  Beautiful story that leaves you with a lot of tears and a lot of heart.",5,One of my personal favorite films,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,1486,"['Cool', 'Dry', 'Place', 'very', 'underappreciated', 'film', 'slipped', 'radar', 'recieved', 'little', 'attention', 'shame', 'huge', 'shame', 'film', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'recently', 'having', 'seen', 'four', 'times', 'past', 'month', 'played', 'TV', 'almost', 'day', 'really', 'grown', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'films', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'out', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Vaughn', 'think', 'hit', 'bad', 'luck', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'just', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'here', 'prime', 'example', 'due', 'credit', 'Vaughn', 'single', 'father', 'recently', 'single', 'raise', 'young', 'son', 'Bobby', 'Moat', 'Not', 'able', 'balance', 'career', 'attorney', 'fatherhood', 'leave', 'practice', 'move', 'Kansas', 'where', 'basketball', 'lovly', 'woman', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Joey', 'Lauren', 'Adams', 'relationship', 'Vaughn', 'ex-wife', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'up', 'reclaim', 'place', 'causing', 'devision', 'turmoil', 'life', 'once', 'again', 'when', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'take', 'position', 'lifetime', 'working', 'law', 'office', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'faced', 'crossroads', 'play', 'working', 'man', 'father', 'brilliant', 'look', 'fatherhood', 'sacrifices', 'one', 'family', 'Beautiful', 'story', 'lot', 'tears', 'lot', 'heart']","A Cool, Dry Place VHS"

Vince  Vaughn is one of the most talented and versatile actors today, and he sure  shows it in this little film that I'm sure alot of people missed.  His  character is so sweet, and I think he did an excellent job portraying a dad  who is raising his son singlehandedly.  He was so charming and just a pure  delight to watch as Russ, an attorney who's wife abandoned him and his son.  If you are a fan of Vaughn's in any way shape or form, watch this movie,  you won't be disappointed! The storyline kept me interested enough, but it  was Vince that really kept me hooked in.  It was a little predictable and  slow in some parts. Vaughn and Joey Laury Adams have a great chemistry  together on screen.  I did enjoy the performance of Bobby Moat, who played  Calvin, Russ's son.  This was a charming little film that seemed to be  overlooked.  It's a definite must see for Vince Vaughns' fans.",4,VAUGHN IS AT HIS BEST....,967420800,"08 28, 2000",2000,1036,"['watched', 'Cool', 'Dry', 'place', 'cable', 'been', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Today', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'whole', 'movie', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'versatile', 'actors', 'today', 'sure', 'little', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'alot', 'people', 'missed', 'character', 'so', 'sweet', 'think', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'dad', 'who', 'raising', 'son', 'singlehandedly', 'was', 'so', 'charming', 'just', 'pure', 'delight', 'watch', 'Russ', 'attorney', 'who', 'wife', 'abandoned', 'son', 'are', 'fan', 'Vaughn', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'watch', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'storyline', 'kept', 'interested', 'enough', 'was', 'Vince', 'really', 'kept', 'hooked', 'was', 'little', 'predictable', 'slow', 'parts', 'Vaughn', 'Joey', 'Laury', 'Adams', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'screen', 'did', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'Bobby', 'Moat', 'who', 'played', 'Calvin', 'Russ', 'son', 'was', 'charming', 'little', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'overlooked', 'definite', 'must', 'see', 'Vince', 'Vaughns', 'fans']","A Cool, Dry Place VHS"

The attorney is devastated and moves with the child to a rural area to become a basketball coach. Joey Lauren Adams is  his baby sitter and they fall in love.  She is beautiful but you will fall  in love with her voice, which should be recorded and placed in a time  capsule as the most fascinating voice of the time. Then you get even agrier  at the wife who shows up one day, for trouble making and trying to get the  son back. She gets her husband in bed and then tells him she never really  loved him.  They break up for good the next day, and mom runs off with the  kid. The baby sitter finds out about the brief tryst because he is honest  enough to admit it. Does she dump him? Well, she is understandably angry  and walks out.  He decides to go back to a big law firm, and now you are  really angry at everybodyBut happiness takes over when the child comes  back to his father, the father quits the new job before he really started  and goes back to the cool, dry place and the young girl, who talked him  into getting the son back. She makes up with him and how could he fail to  cement his love with Joey Lauren Adams and her wonderful voice.The film  is done excellently, even though the above description may seem  superficial.

503306,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,B00000ICUO,R. A Rubin,"[2, 4]","This film, made in the late 90's, highlights a newcomer, Vince Vaughn.  Frankly, I've missed his stuff till he showed up in the National Enquirer dating Jenn Aniston.  Recently I saw Thumbsucker, where he had a minor part, a be-glassed school teacher and chess coach. Then the Wedding Crasher thing happened and we saw a kind of motor mouth, gen-x, comic.  Well that quick retort was foreshadowed in A Cool, Dry Place.  There's a wonderful manliness and sensitivity in Vaughn's acting that's tough to project simultaneously.  Think Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. We can hardly blame Joey Lauren Adams from falling for him instantaneously.  Hell, I'd marry him.  Er, okay, maybe not.Therefore, a reluctant dad loses his high-powered attorney job because he needs to rush home and relieve the baby sitter.  Mom had taken a hike, finding a man better than Vince.  Hmm not too believable, but that's the plot.  The kid is cute, dad is cute, and new girlfriend is red-hot cute, but then mom shows up. Thereafter the drama goes for tears.
