372831,A1GPDE0SVI2EUP,6303400396,"Alan Majeska ""Alan Majeska""","[5, 5]","This 1972 series is an excellent drama based on the Italian Renaissance man Leonardo da Vinci's life, with many of his inventions and paintings profiled and explained in detail.  The camera work is excellent, and the locations where this was filmed - I presume in northern Italy - create an authentic atmosphere.  Costumes, props, and acting are all first rate.  This was originally a co-production between a Chicago TV company and one in Milan, Italy, and the actors are Italian, but there are English overdubs, which are sometimes noticeable, but not distracting, at least not so to me.Philippe Leroy, an actor I've never encountered before, plays Leonardo da Vinci as an adult.  He shows the serious, at times almost dour side of Leonardo the genius, constantly involved in an invention or painting.  Leonardo has a huge burden for the inventions he creates, and terrific commitment to the princes and dukes he serves.  One wonders in our more egalitarian age if the royalty Leonardo worked for felt a similar sense of commitment to him.The narrator interjects different theories about Leonardo's life and inventions, attempting to dispel some myths which arose over the 5 centuries since Leonardo's time (he died in 1519, in the service of the French King Frances, considered an enemy by many of the Italian princes, and Leonardo was a native Italian.)  One such myth is that Leonardo, considered a ""King"" in a sense because of his genius, died in the arms of the King of France, since proven to be more legend than real event.I bought this VHS series in 1990, and have enjoyed it from time to time ever since.  Picture, color and sound quality are all very good.  Highly recommended for students of history, Renaissance painting, or anyone who likes biographies of great men of history, of which Leonardo was an excellent example: serving humanity with his genius.",5,An excellent drama based on Leonardo da Vinci's life,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,1869,"['1972', 'series', 'excellent', 'drama', 'based', 'Italian', 'Renaissance', 'man', 'Leonardo', 'Vinci', 'life', 'many', 'inventions', 'paintings', 'profiled', 'explained', 'detail', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'locations', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'presume', 'northern', 'Italy', 'create', 'authentic', 'atmosphere', 'Costumes', 'props', 'acting', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'originally', 'co-production', 'Chicago', 'TV', 'company', 'one', 'Milan', 'Italy', 'actors', 'are', 'Italian', 'are', 'English', 'overdubs', 'are', 'sometimes', 'noticeable', 'not', 'distracting', 'least', 'not', 'so', 'me.Philippe', 'Leroy', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'never', 'encountered', 'plays', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'adult', 'serious', 'times', 'almost', 'dour', 'side', 'Leonardo', 'genius', 'constantly', 'involved', 'invention', 'painting', 'Leonardo', 'huge', 'burden', 'inventions', 'terrific', 'commitment', 'princes', 'dukes', 'One', 'more', 'egalitarian', 'age', 'royalty', 'Leonardo', 'worked', 'felt', 'similar', 'sense', 'commitment', 'him.The', 'narrator', 'interjects', 'different', 'theories', 'Leonardo', 'life', 'inventions', 'attempting', 'dispel', 'myths', 'arose', '5', 'centuries', 'Leonardo', 'time', 'died', '1519', 'service', 'French', 'King', 'Frances', 'considered', 'enemy', 'many', 'Italian', 'princes', 'Leonardo', 'was', 'native', 'Italian', 'One', 'such', 'myth', 'Leonardo', 'considered', 'King', 'sense', 'genius', 'died', 'arms', 'King', 'France', 'proven', 'be', 'more', 'legend', 'real', 'event.I', 'bought', 'VHS', 'series', '1990', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'time', 'ever', 'Picture', 'color', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'students', 'history', 'Renaissance', 'painting', 'anyone', 'who', 'biographies', 'great', 'men', 'history', 'Leonardo', 'was', 'excellent', 'example', 'serving', 'humanity', 'genius']",Life of Leonardo Da Vinci 3pc  VHS

But, considering that this release by Questar is pointlessly a cut up, BASTARDIZED version of the original mini-series (which can still be had in its entirety on VHS, also from Questar), I am forced to focus more on what's wrong with this particular release, rather than extoll the astonishing merits of the wonderful film. Please avoid this version at all costs, and if you can, get the full version on VHS. Questar has cut out some of the best moments of this film series for no valid reason I can discern - maybe just to save 2 bucks on the overall package price. They have done great damage to this film, by removing, amongst other key scenes, the important in-story narrator. This element added much charm and charisma to an already fasicinating film - and was one of the many reasons it is, in its original form, so enchanting. Removing the in-story narrator also necessitated removing some key speculations concerning important areas of Leonardo's life and thought.

The device of having the narrator himself step into the scenes to give context and anecdotal information works very well in counterpoint to the dramatic illustrations of episodes in his life.

372835,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6303400396,Charles Ashbacher,"[9, 12]","For many years, I have considered Leonardo Da Vinci to be the most talented person who ever lived and this series of videos reinforces that belief. While the dialog and many circumstances are based on little more than conjecture, the story does give you an indication of the amazing talent that was loaded into just one man. Since it has been reproduced so many times, it easy to forget that ""The Last Supper"" covers an entire wall. The magnitude and detail of the painting are even more impressive when you understand that. It also increases your disgust when you realize how it has been treated down through the centuries.His talents as a thinker, inventor and engineer are just as impressive. Many of his ""inventions"" were centuries ahead of their time, anticipating many devices such as the submarine and tank. While none were actually constructed, many of the design principles were sound and it took many people to regenerate his revolutionary ideas.The tapes also give you detailed insight into the political and economic structure of southern Europe at that time. Northern Italy was the center of the Renaissance, and the city states were economically powerful but militarily weak nations. Ruled by wealthy people who would not have had that kind of political power in earlier centuries, that wealth was spent in the support of court artists so that they could create works to enhance the prestige of the rulers. While this placed substantial resources at the disposal of the artist, it also made them subject to the fickle political winds that were constantly blowing across northern Italy.His service to deposed rulers made him politically suspect and he was forced to relocate several times during his life. I had never realized that the famous Mona Lisa had been moved so many times. One can only speculate on what his accomplishments would have been had his travels been reduced. It was also new to me that he was once brought up on anonymous charges of heresy, which could have led to his being executed as a heretic.One of the greatest artists of all time, Leonardo was also one of the great observers, seeing many things that no one else did. Using these observations as a model, he cataloged and invented many things that were centuries ahead of their time. Had he completed it, his books on human anatomy and painting would no doubt still be in use. Leonardo Da Vinci could have achieved a significant place in history in many different areas, together they make him the most talented of all time and these tapes will help you understand the man and the world he lived in.

372837,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303400396,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","It's unfortunate that the first thing many people would think of today at the mention of Da Vinci's name is the fictitious Da Vinci code rather than, say, the Mona Lisa.  I think this presentation's subtitle is absolutely correct when it names Da Vinci ""the most brilliant mind in history.""  Artist, scientist, architect, military designer - he was all of these and more.  The Life of Leonardo Da Vinci covers the Maestro's complete life over the course of four and a half hours and then throws in five impressive bonus features on top of that.  Philippe Leroy gives an impeccable performance in the starring role, backed up by a cast of hundreds against a backdrop of more than 90 locations in Italy.  Produced in 1972, the production looks its age, but it also shows the care and respect with which it was filmed.We really don't know all that much about much of Da Vinci's life.  It sounds a little funny when the film points this out and then goes on to dramatize it all, anyway.  Clearly, though, what was put on film here was the result of meticulous research.  Of course, probably the greatest treasure trove of history is the remaining collection of Da Vinci's notes, which provide early sketches of some lost works, a record of Da Vinci's incredible inventions, and a record of his anatomical studies of the human body.  Truly he was a man hundreds of years ahead of his time, coming up with the original ideas for the tank, an underwater breathing apparatus, the helicopter, the parachute, the machine gun, etc.  Tragically, many of his notes and sketches were lost to history, as were some of his artistic creations.  Many might be surprised to learn that we have only eleven completed pieces of Da Vinci artwork today.  This film takes you through the creation of all of those masterpieces - plus some that have been lost or were never finished.Da Vinci was a truly fascinating man, and this film does an excellent job communicating his isolation from the rest of the world.  He was an illegitimate child who never really had a home of his own.  In his prime, he sojourned between his native Florence and Milan, forced to flee on several occasions when the constantly shifting tides of military power among the Italian city states shifted or when France invaded.  In his later years, he was forced to suffer the abuse of the hot-tempered upstart Michelangelo, before finally finding some sanctuary in France in his last days.I think the film does quite a fair job of dramatizing Da Vinci's life.  Many biographical treatments resort to sensational charges concerning the mysterious legal troubles that fueled his original exit from Florence and indulge in unfounded speculations of homosexuality.  Everything here is based as accurately as possible on what history tells us.  Da Vinci's biggest problem was that he was really too brilliant.  Forever fascinated with nature, he found himself distracted all too often from other work he was doing, and his meticulous methods required great patience on the part of his clients.  He could go days without touching a brush, yet he was working all the same - unlike any other artist, Da Vinci's art pieces were ""written"" as well as painted.  He studied every facet of horses and how they moved, for example, before attempting to make a bronze horse sculpture.Da Vinci was not only the most brilliant mind in history, he was also probably history's most brilliant failure.  Besides the number of commissioned works he never completed, some of his works were plagued with problems: his Battle of Anghiari mural was ruined as the result of a failed experiment with drying the oil-based paint, for example.  Even his marvelous fresco of The Last Supper began suffering cracks shortly after its completion.  Seeing both his successes and his failures recreated on the screen, one gets a much deeper appreciation of the man and his humanity.  It's not really a happy story, as Da Vinci suffered many wrongs in his life and was never really given the respect he deserved (even his grave was desecrated and his bones hurled into a mass burial pit by foreign invaders several years after his death).Besides the feature film, the DVD also includes five short bonus features: The Rise of Renaissance Italy, Leonardo's Masterpieces, Da Vinci's Inventions, The Maestro vs. Michelangelo, and The Works of Two Great Masters: A Timeline.  The whole presentation brings Da Vinci to life in as realistic a way as possible, and that makes The Life of Leonardo Da Vinci a masterpiece of sorts in and of itself.",5,Brings the quintessential Renaissance man back to life,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,4545,"['unfortunate', 'first', 'thing', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'today', 'mention', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'name', 'fictitious', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'code', 'rather', 'say', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'think', 'presentation', 'subtitle', 'absolutely', 'correct', 'when', 'names', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'most', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'history', 'Artist', 'scientist', 'architect', 'military', 'designer', 'was', 'more', 'Life', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Maestro', 'complete', 'life', 'course', 'four', 'half', 'hours', 'then', 'five', 'impressive', 'bonus', 'features', 'top', 'Philippe', 'Leroy', 'impeccable', 'performance', 'starring', 'role', 'backed', 'up', 'cast', 'hundreds', 'backdrop', 'more', '90', 'locations', 'Italy', 'Produced', '1972', 'production', 'age', 'also', 'care', 'respect', 'was', 'filmed.We', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'much', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'life', 'little', 'funny', 'when', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'then', 'dramatize', 'anyway', 'Clearly', 'though', 'what', 'was', 'put', 'film', 'here', 'was', 'result', 'meticulous', 'research', 'course', 'probably', 'greatest', 'treasure', 'trove', 'history', 'remaining', 'collection', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'notes', 'provide', 'early', 'sketches', 'lost', 'works', 'record', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'incredible', 'inventions', 'record', 'anatomical', 'studies', 'human', 'body', 'Truly', 'was', 'man', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'coming', 'up', 'original', 'ideas', 'tank', 'underwater', 'breathing', 'apparatus', 'helicopter', 'parachute', 'machine', 'gun', 'etc', 'Tragically', 'many', 'notes', 'sketches', 'were', 'lost', 'history', 'were', 'artistic', 'creations', 'Many', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'have', 'only', 'eleven', 'completed', 'pieces', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'artwork', 'today', 'film', 'creation', 'masterpieces', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'were', 'never', 'finished.Da', 'Vinci', 'was', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'man', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'communicating', 'isolation', 'rest', 'world', 'was', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'home', 'own', 'prime', 'sojourned', 'native', 'Florence', 'Milan', 'forced', 'flee', 'several', 'occasions', 'when', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'tides', 'military', 'power', 'Italian', 'city', 'states', 'shifted', 'when', 'France', 'invaded', 'later', 'years', 'was', 'forced', 'suffer', 'abuse', 'hot-tempered', 'upstart', 'Michelangelo', 'finally', 'finding', 'sanctuary', 'France', 'last', 'days.I', 'think', 'film', 'quite', 'fair', 'job', 'dramatizing', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'life', 'Many', 'biographical', 'treatments', 'resort', 'sensational', 'charges', 'concerning', 'mysterious', 'legal', 'troubles', 'fueled', 'original', 'exit', 'Florence', 'indulge', 'unfounded', 'speculations', 'homosexuality', 'Everything', 'here', 'based', 'as', 'accurately', 'possible', 'history', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'too', 'brilliant', 'Forever', 'fascinated', 'nature', 'found', 'distracted', 'too', 'often', 'other', 'work', 'was', 'doing', 'meticulous', 'methods', 'required', 'great', 'patience', 'part', 'clients', 'could', 'go', 'days', 'touching', 'brush', 'yet', 'was', 'working', 'same', 'other', 'artist', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'art', 'pieces', 'were', 'written', 'as', 'well', 'painted', 'studied', 'facet', 'horses', 'how', 'moved', 'example', 'attempting', 'make', 'bronze', 'horse', 'sculpture.Da', 'Vinci', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'most', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'history', 'was', 'also', 'probably', 'history', 'most', 'brilliant', 'failure', 'number', 'commissioned', 'works', 'never', 'completed', 'works', 'were', 'plagued', 'problems', 'Battle', 'Anghiari', 'mural', 'was', 'ruined', 'result', 'failed', 'experiment', 'drying', 'oil-based', 'paint', 'example', 'Even', 'marvelous', 'fresco', 'Last', 'Supper', 'began', 'suffering', 'cracks', 'shortly', 'completion', 'Seeing', 'successes', 'failures', 'recreated', 'screen', 'one', 'much', 'deeper', 'appreciation', 'man', 'humanity', 'not', 'really', 'happy', 'story', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'suffered', 'many', 'wrongs', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'respect', 'deserved', 'even', 'grave', 'was', 'desecrated', 'bones', 'hurled', 'mass', 'burial', 'pit', 'foreign', 'invaders', 'several', 'years', 'death', 'feature', 'film', 'DVD', 'also', 'five', 'short', 'bonus', 'features', 'Rise', 'Renaissance', 'Italy', 'Leonardo', 'Masterpieces', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Inventions', 'Maestro', 'vs.', 'Michelangelo', 'Works', 'Two', 'Great', 'Masters', 'Timeline', 'whole', 'presentation', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'life', 'realistic', 'way', 'possible', 'Life', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'masterpiece', 'sorts']",Life of Leonardo Da Vinci 3pc  VHS

He seemed to be someone who was good at many things but only wanted to do things that he was interested in and he often left things unfinished.What was unique about da Vinci was the combination of artistic and scientific interests.  He seemed to have basically unlimited energy and curiousity.Leonardo was in some ways very fortunate because he was held in the very highest esteem by some rich people.  The king of France treated him almost like royality.  Here's a guy who would think nothing of sending thousands of soldiers into a human meat grinder but yet he felt that Leonardo was one of the greatest men that ever lived.Leonardo was treated very well by the standards of the day and he always seemed to have money.  A lot of these guys he worked for were killers including the guy he put on all those pagents for.  That was also the guy who's young ambitious wife died as fate eventually always returns sadness to the cruel and greedy.Leonardo had his hard times also and really never had a home until old age.  I think he had a hard time fitting his intense interests into the primitive social structure of the times.Were he alive today da Vinci would most likely be a surgeon or scientist or at least he would try to become these things.Leonardo came close to being burned at the stake for something he would say and get involved in some 500 years in the future.  Something that exists outside of time.But fortunately he is remembered for his great spiritual paitings, especially The Last Supper which miraculously has somehow survived after beginning to deteriorate soon after it was finished due to using the wrong types of paiting methods.He tried to create a gigantic oil painting on a wall and he treated the wall like a gigantic canvas.Plato: Apology",5,Comprehensive And Serious Study Of Leonardo,975888000,"12 4, 2000",2000,2048,"['video', 'set', 'lot', 'historical', 'perspective', 'strange', 'life', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'who', 'was', 'question', 'one', 'weirdest', 'people', 'who', 'ever', 'lived.It', 'difficult', 'really', 'compare', 'anyone', 'else', 'such', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'generally', 'considered', 'geniuses', 'today', 'seemed', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'many', 'things', 'only', 'wanted', 'do', 'things', 'was', 'interested', 'often', 'left', 'things', 'unfinished.What', 'was', 'unique', 'da', 'Vinci', 'was', 'combination', 'artistic', 'scientific', 'interests', 'seemed', 'have', 'basically', 'unlimited', 'energy', 'curiousity.Leonardo', 'was', 'ways', 'very', 'fortunate', 'was', 'held', 'very', 'highest', 'esteem', 'rich', 'people', 'king', 'France', 'treated', 'almost', 'royality', 'Here', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'think', 'nothing', 'sending', 'thousands', 'soldiers', 'human', 'meat', 'grinder', 'yet', 'felt', 'Leonardo', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'men', 'ever', 'was', 'treated', 'very', 'well', 'standards', 'day', 'always', 'seemed', 'have', 'money', 'lot', 'guys', 'worked', 'were', 'killers', 'including', 'guy', 'put', 'pagents', 'was', 'also', 'guy', 'who', 'young', 'ambitious', 'wife', 'died', 'fate', 'eventually', 'always', 'sadness', 'cruel', 'greedy.Leonardo', 'had', 'hard', 'times', 'also', 'really', 'never', 'had', 'home', 'old', 'age', 'think', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'fitting', 'intense', 'interests', 'primitive', 'social', 'structure', 'times.Were', 'alive', 'today', 'da', 'Vinci', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'surgeon', 'scientist', 'least', 'would', 'try', 'become', 'things.Leonardo', 'came', 'close', 'being', 'burned', 'stake', 'something', 'would', 'say', 'get', 'involved', '500', 'years', 'future', 'Something', 'time.But', 'fortunately', 'remembered', 'great', 'spiritual', 'paitings', 'especially', 'Last', 'Supper', 'miraculously', 'somehow', 'survived', 'beginning', 'deteriorate', 'soon', 'was', 'finished', 'due', 'using', 'wrong', 'types', 'paiting', 'methods.He', 'tried', 'create', 'gigantic', 'oil', 'painting', 'wall', 'treated', 'wall', 'gigantic', 'canvas.Plato', 'Apology']",Life of Leonardo Da Vinci 3pc  VHS

372847,A2K3UTNW0783U6,6303400396,Phillip Kay,"[10, 10]","Leonardo was not appreciated in his own time. He was sidelined, persecuted and many of his works destroyed. A similar fate has befell this documentary. I saw this film in the 70s. It was shown on Australian TV (where I live) and I thought it then, and probably still do, the greatest TV film I have ever seen. Leonardo, I believe, excelled his contemporaries in the range of his discoveries, and I believe he excells our contemporaries in the same way: this is a man whom to see as a precursor of 20th century science is to belittle. Castellani's film now exists in three versions. To save other viewers the trouble of the research, following is what I have found out about each version.""The Life of Leonardo da Vinci"" was a 1971 Italian TV production directed by Renato Castellani, a famous and critically esteemed director of the time. It tapped into a moment of patriotic fervour in Italy and was funded by the Italian government to an unprecedented extent, becoming the most expensive production made in Italy up to that time. It was produced in the same way that Hollywood epics are fabled to be, with on location shoots at every place Leonardo was known to have lived or visited, and with a 'cast of thousands'. Meticulous care was taken with costumes and sets, without exception both luxurious and authentic. Particular care was also taken with casting. An innovative and appropriately experimental approach (for the time) saw the casting of a famous TV personality, Giulio Bosetti, as a modern dress narrator, strolling onto the historical sets to give a modern day perspective of the events depicted.The original Italian version is available on a 3 DVD set. It has an Italian soundtrack and Italian subtitles, but no English, I presume to avoid competing with versions released in English speaking countries. If you understand Italian, this is the preferred version. It runs at the original broadcast time of 320 minutes.The English language distribution rights for the film were secured by Questar Inc of Chicago, a specialist distributor of historical and other documentary material. Questar released a version on VHS videotape which dropped the Italian soundtrack for a (very well) dubbed English one. This version is still available for those not adverse to videotape. It is on a set of 3 videocassettes and runs for 270 minutes.Questar Inc also released a DVD version of the film. This version has been shortened and is on 2 DVDs. Removed is all the material featuring Giulio Bosetti as the modern dress narrator, which would have also meant shortening some of the scenes on which he makes a commentary. Presumably the editors thought viewers would be puzzled by the sight of a modern narrator stepping out from an historical set (forget the contribution of structuralist film critics and the impact of Jean-Luc Goddard on cinema - this is supposed to be an historical epic, right?). The film survives this blundering butchery, it's that good. The dubbed soundtrack is slightly out of synch though. Somewhat unforgivably, Questar lifted the film specs from their video release and describe it as running at 270 minutes. There is no mention of any cuts. As a compensation, 5 short documentaries of 5-10 minutes each are included on the second disk. The film's running time is 230 minutes (total time including extras is back to 270 minutes).This is the only version English speakers who prefer disk format can see Castellani's film. Even Japanese viewers have to watch this version (with Japanese subtitles). I think people who care about film, about Leonardo, who object to false advertising and concealed censorship, should object, but doubtless I'm in the minority.Worth looking for is a 2004 BBC documentary, ""Leonardo da Vinci"", a 3 episode, 160 minute film which features spectacular photography, reconstructions and testing of some of Leonardo's machines (and some insights about them never before appreciated), location shoots, dramatic re-enactments, readings from the Notebooks and commentary by scholars.

One can almost instantly feel the graininess even when the film presentation is of a higher quality, which this one is. Our image was very good but doesn't have that pristine silken feeling one finds today or in many films that date back to the 1940's.The sets and costume designs are authentic and a visual treat. The subject matter is more visual and entertaining than thought provoking. The film treads on the 'safe' side of da Vinci's life. But when a man has such complexity and genius, even that is enough. We never found ourselves board or wanting to take a break. It is entertaining enough to watch in one sitting, of course with the usual breaks.Everything da Vinci like everything Shakespeare or Beethoven or Mahler should be viewed. When historical figures are presented to the Modern audience, some of the spaces will have to be filled in with educated probabilities and possibilities. This is very much the case with da Vinci. Much of his life is unknown. I think the producers of this film did a credible job in fleshing out da Vinci's life. I would have liked more in-depth footage on his intellectual and sexual life, even if only speculation, as long it is credible and relevant to what made this great man tick and bleed and exceed.I highly recommend this to all lovers of da Vinci and those who simply want to learn and open their minds. One word of caution though. On disc 2, episode 4, there is a slight glitch. The disc freezes and has to be manipulated to fast forward. It's a minor problem. It is a manufacturing problem, as it was on both our original and replacement copy, in the exact same place.
