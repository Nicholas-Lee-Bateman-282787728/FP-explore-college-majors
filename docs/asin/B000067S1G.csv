703775,A2GARPSATCEW4S,B000067S1G,Amazon Customer,"[7, 16]","The third season of the Sopranos was a season of searching. I think that the story was basically wrapped up at the end of season 2 and the producers and writers had to come up with new story lines to carry the series. They come up with a new adversary for Tony, who I don't think is as focused or as threatening as Jackie was. They try to increase the focus on Meadow, to limited effectiveness. Christopher, who I think is one of the best characters on the show, gets much less air time and I think that's a mistake. While the first two seasons managed to balance both of Tony's ""families"", I don't think they were as successful at the juxtapositioning of his responsiblities in season 3.Don't get me wrong, I still think it's the best show on television, but it's not as strong as the previous seasons. I remember thinking that the best thing about the season opening 2 hour episode was how they blended ""Every breath you take"" with ""Peter Gunn"". That should not be the thing that is the most memorable from the show. Unlike the previous seasons, they suffer from a lack of focus. It felt like they were feeling their way around for a story. They left so many loose ends, to be worthy of a soap opera, not a drama.Anyway, I'll be picking it up anyway and I've got my fingers crossed that season #4 will return the series to its former glory.",3,Paradise Lost,1022112000,"05 23, 2002",2002,1342,"['third', 'season', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'season', 'searching', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'basically', 'wrapped', 'up', 'end', 'season', '2', 'producers', 'writers', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'story', 'lines', 'carry', 'series', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'adversary', 'Tony', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'focused', 'as', 'threatening', 'Jackie', 'was', 'try', 'increase', 'focus', 'Meadow', 'limited', 'effectiveness', 'Christopher', 'who', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'show', 'much', 'less', 'air', 'time', 'think', 'mistake', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'managed', 'balance', 'Tony', 'families', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'as', 'successful', 'juxtapositioning', 'responsiblities', 'season', '3.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'think', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'previous', 'seasons', 'remember', 'thinking', 'best', 'thing', 'season', 'opening', '2', 'hour', 'episode', 'was', 'how', 'blended', 'breath', 'take', 'Peter', 'Gunn', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'thing', 'most', 'memorable', 'show', 'previous', 'seasons', 'suffer', 'lack', 'focus', 'felt', 'were', 'feeling', 'way', 'story', 'left', 'so', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'be', 'worthy', 'soap', 'opera', 'not', 'drama.Anyway', ""'ll"", 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'season', '4', 'will', 'return', 'series', 'former', 'glory']",N/A
703776,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000067S1G,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Again, I struggled with penning these reviews because the series is really just too brilliant for words.  With each passing season `The Sopranos' perfected itself and left us with utter brilliance time and time again.  Each plot twist was so intricately woven into itself, so expertly crafted and engineered and most importantly delivered with such gusto and bravado that it feels so silky smooth against our eyes.  If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times, there is no television show before or after that has ever nor will ever amount to the effortless excellence that was `The Sopranos'.  Now, season three is lauded as one of if not the best season `The Sopranos' has ever experienced, and while I can't say that I wholeheartedly agree (I'm torn really since they were all so good) I can understand why there is so much love for this particular season.  Sadly we lost Nancy Marchand but we gained so much that her absence does not leave the void that could be expected.With the passing of Livia Soprano some worries are set at ease but some serious inconveniences take their place.  Tony can rest easy that his mother won't flip on him to the feds but with her gone his sister soon moves into her home and starts demanding and expecting things that Tony is not ready to give her.  Janice moves herself into her mothers home all but manually removing Svetlana, the Russian nurse Tony hired to take care of his ailing mother, from the home.  Janice continues to make problems for Tony with her actions, but Tony also has issues a little more close to home to contend with.  His daughter Meadow has a new boyfriend, an African American boy named Noah whom Tony cannot accept.  He has no desire to see his daughter making a life with a non-Italian, especially not an African American (and part Jewish) boy.  Differences of opinion cause Tony and Meadow to clash on more than one occasion and threaten to destroy their relationship.  This also causes Tony to suffer more of his blackouts and a startling discovery is made as to the root cause of them.There are changes that take place within the business as well.  Christopher finally gets his `made man' status but soon realizes it's not as glamorous as he expected.  He starts butting heads with Paulie and continues to do so throughout the season.  An episode in particular placing Christopher and Paulie lost in the wilderness in pursuit of a botched hit really fleshes out their tense relationship.  His promotion also affects Adriana, who at this point is working for Artie Bucco at his restaurant.  With Christopher prompting her to quit Artie is left to deal with his emotions and true feelings for Adriana.  With the end of his tense and unhealthy marriage he struggles with letting someone like Adriana out of his life.  There's also the issue of Ralph Cifaretto.  Ralph really becomes an essential character throughout this season, mostly because of his temper and his ability to illicit pure unadulterated loathing from the audience.  Ralph begins dating Rosalie Aprile, the late Jackie Aprile's widow.  Ralph's sporadic and uncontrolled actions though cause Tony to distance himself despite the families close relationship to Rosalie and to her son Jackie Jr.  An incident involving Ralph's stripper girlfriend alone nearly brings Tony to the point of murder.This season also introduces us to Johnny Sack, a New York City mob boss who's moved into town.  As the seasons progress his relationship with Tony will grow, but at his arrival Tony is curious and maybe even skeptical of his presence.The season brings a lot of turmoil and new revelations throughout the Soprano `family' in every meaning of the word.  Meadow grows as she leaves for collage and her relationships with both Noah and eventually Jackie Jr. are tested.  Jackie Jr. himself becomes the cause of most of Tony's grief as he struggles with a commitment he made to the boys late father and protecting his business and his family.  Jackie Jr. is insistent on being part of what his father helped helm but Tony refuses to allow him to ruin what he has going for him.  He wants him to finish school and get a respectable job and although Jackie Jr. agrees to try he fails to deliver.  Tony's relationships with women outside his marriage also take a turn for the more adventurous.  He finds himself a new girlfriend in Gloria Trillo, a fellow patient of Doctor Mefli's who also happens to be a Mercedes Benz saleswoman.  She's fun and exciting not to mention utterly gorgeous, but she is a little crazy and this puts a strain between her and Tony.  Tony's relationship with Doctor Melfi also takes a turn and this is apparent more in Melfi than it is in Tony.  When she is brutally attacked while leaving her office she becomes introverted and afraid and when given the opportunity to have someone like Tony take care of the problem her eyes say it all.  I won't go into much detail, but when you see it you'll know what I mean.  She is changing, especially in her feelings towards Tony and what he does, and this becomes very apparent.The acting again this season is beyond brilliant.  James Gandolfini is again at the top of his game delivering Tony to us with such conviction and true vigor.  I swear with each passing year he got better and better.  Why he doesn't have seven Emmys to his name is beyond me.  Edie Falco, Larraine Bracco and Aida Turturro all shine this season, especially Turturro as Tony's meddlesome sister, but its Annabella Sciorra who really takes the cake for me here.  Her performance was just so memorable.  That, and she is unforgettably beautiful.  Jamie-Lynn Sigler ups her game here and only continues to shine as the seasons come and go, and towards the end of this season Robert Iler is also given a chance to grow.  Michael Imperioli is perfect here, as is Dominic Chianese and Tony Sirico, but those are give-ins.  Joe Pantoliano really delves in his character of Ralph, and does so brilliantly, and Sharon Angela is fantastic as Rosalie.  Vincent Curatola's Johnny Sack eventually becomes close to my favorite character on the show, and in this season he has his moments, but his true genius comes in seasons to follow.  John Ventimiglia does a great job as Artie, and I feel I must mention his as I have failed to do so in my previous reviews.  His character keeps growing with each passing season, but it's here that he really begins to flourish.I could go on and on but who has the time to really read all I have to say.  Just know that season three is a definite high point in the evocative series known as `The Sopranos'.  The get everything right and deliver non-stop thought provoking entertainment that is sure to enjoy just about everyone.  There is really nothing negative to say about this show for from its conception till its death (is it really `dead'?) it has proved to be nothing short of spectacular.  Until season fours review, I hope this has proved helpful.",5,Without doubt the greatest show to ever grace the small screen...three's a charmer...,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,6951,"['Again',

Nominated for countless Emmy's, and winner of at least four in every one of its seasons except Season 2 (in which it carried home one), The Sopranos has cemented itself as one of the elite shows in television history...Golden Globe performer James Gandolfini plays the title role of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged father of two, loving husband, and successful businessman. But contrary to a typical sitcom, Tony finds himself irritated by his kids Anthony and Meadow (Robert Iler and Jamie Lynn Sigler), he cheats on his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and the business organization responsible for his success is the mafia (of which he is the local boss). All the confusion in Tony's life leads to massive amounts of stress, prompting him to regularly visit a therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) - one of the few outsiders he trusts. Following a classic prime time soap opera format, quite similar to the hit TV show Dallas, The Sopranos provides audiences with a glimpse into the life and times of a mafia boss, where we find out that being a mob kingpin isn't the glamour life often portrayed in the movies...The Sopranos (Season 3) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood"" in which the Soprano family continues their daily routine, completely unaware that the FBI is plotting an intricate scheme to bug their house. Meanwhile, Tony begins some plotting of his own when Patsy begins asking too many questions about his brother's death... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Fortunate Son"" in which Tony learns that his panic attacks are partly due to genetics and past events from his childhood, and ""He is Risen"" in which Tony's problems with Ralphie bubble to surface when Ralphie doesn't get the promotion he hoped for...Below is a list of episodes included on The Sopranos (Season 3) DVD:Episode 27 (Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood)Episode 28 (Proshai, Livushka)Episode 29 (Fortunate Son)Episode 30 (Employee of the Month)Episode 31 (Another Toothpick)Episode 32 (University)Episode 33 (Second Opinion)Episode 34 (He is Risen)Episode 35 (The Telltale Moozadell)Episode 36 (To Save Us All from Satan's Power)Episode 37 (Pine Barrens)Episode 38 (Amour Fou)Episode 39 (Army of One)The DVD Report",5,A truly great series...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2611,"['Sex', 'City', 'HBO', 'original', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'took', 'world', 'storm', 'late-1990s', 'cutting', 'edge', 'drama', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'cross', 'Godfather', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'sitcom', 'family', 'show', 'provided', 'unique', 'experience', 'niche', 'audience', 'quickly', 'developed', 'barrage', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'Nominated', 'countless', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'least', 'four', 'one', 'seasons', 'Season', '2', 'carried', 'home', 'one', 'Sopranos', 'cemented', 'one', 'elite', 'television', 'history', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performer', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'title', 'role', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'middle-aged', 'father', 'two', 'loving', 'husband', 'successful', 'businessman', 'contrary', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'Tony', 'irritated', 'kids', 'Anthony', 'Meadow', 'Robert', 'Iler', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Sigler', 'wife', 'Carmela', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'business', 'organization', 'responsible', 'success', 'mafia', 'local', 'boss', 'confusion', 'Tony', 'life', 'massive', 'amounts', 'stress', 'prompting', 'regularly', 'visit', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Jennifer', 'Melfi', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'one', 'few', 'outsiders', 'Following', 'classic', 'prime', 'time', 'soap', 'opera', 'format', 'quite', 'similar', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Dallas', 'Sopranos', 'audiences', 'glimpse', 'life', 'times', 'mafia', 'boss', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'being', 'mob', 'kingpin', ""n't"", 'glamour', 'life', 'often', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Mr.', 'Ruggerio', 'Neighborhood', 'Soprano', 'family', 'daily', 'routine', 'completely', 'unaware', 'FBI', 'plotting', 'intricate', 'scheme', 'bug', 'house', 'Meanwhile', 'Tony', 'plotting', 'own', 'when', 'Patsy', 'asking', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'brother', 'death', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Fortunate', 'Son', 'Tony', 'panic', 'attacks', 'are', 'partly', 'due', 'genetics', 'past', 'events', 'childhood', 'Risen', 'Tony', 'problems', 'Ralphie', 'bubble', 'surface', 'when', 'Ralphie', ""n't"", 'get', 'promotion', 'hoped', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '27', 'Mr.', 'Ruggerio', 'Neighborhood', 'Episode', '28', 'Proshai', 'Livushka', 'Episode', '29', 'Fortunate', 'Son', 'Episode', '30', 'Employee', 'Month', 'Episode', '31', 'Toothpick', 'Episode', '32', 'University', 'Episode', '33', 'Second', 'Opinion', 'Episode', '34', 'Risen', 'Episode', '35', 'Telltale', 'Moozadell', 'Episode', '36', 'Save', 'Us', 'All', 'Satan', 'Power', 'Episode', '37', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'Episode', '38', 'Amour', 'Fou', 'Episode', '39', 'Army', 'One', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Nothing interferes with my seeing my newly purchased set.  It was true for sets one and two and now three. The first episode is a bit weak as it involves federal agents wiring Tony's house but after that the series takes off with a roar. There is so much good stuff going on that is would take a journal to catalogue them all.  However, here are some of the highlights. Tony's mother's funeral is an incredible study of how death can sanctify even the most vile of people.  However, the wake becomes a festering point where only so much hypocrisy can survive before exploding. Carmella seeks separate psychiatric help and that is my favorite scene in the whole series.  Her psychiatrist is the one and only person to turn down Soprano money in the series, saying that the reason he won't accept payment is that it is blood money. He says that she has to hear and understand that she is living on blood money and that is the root of her problems. Now she will not be able to say she never heard that truth.  The daughter Meadow becomes involved with a young man also connected to the Soprano crime family but only on the farthest reaches of it.  His stepfather, however, is key to Tony's entire organization.  Tony's sister Janet steals her late mother's caregiver's artificial leg to get some LP records back from her. Janet essentially is coming to replace the mother in the series but she engrafts a West Coast flakiness onto the inner rotten core, a very unusual combination of character traits but it works.  Once again, the Sopranos manages to capture the women in this setting better than any previous crime family saga. These women are not doormats.  There is a lot going on in each and every one of them and I find them even more fascinating than the men in the series.  Tony's psychiatrist is back too with trauma of her own to handle and she is tempted to let Tony handle her problem for her in his usual violent manner.  If you can resist this series, you are a stronger person than I.

703791,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B000067S1G,Chris Fung,"[11, 12]","If you want a summary of the plot, read the other reviews, this is a little thought peice on the reasons why viewers have such a ""mo fo"" (Tonese for ""amour fou"") relationship with this series.First of all, I agree that this season carried on with the best parts of the first two seasons, but its darker and maybe even wearier in tone than the last two. This is (in my humble opinion) one of the great things about this series as TV drama: the characters are on long enough temporal arcs that they can undergo serious changes in character and temprament in a thoroughly convincingly human way. And it is to the writers' directors' and actors lasting credit that they make it convincing, engaging and utterly compelling.  This is ensemble dramatic work at its absolute best.One example is Tony himself.  In the first two seasons you see his charismatic side at work brilliantly.  He's on his way up and his brutality and ambition are juxtaposed against his native intelligence and charm in a thoroughly captivating manner.By the third season, the viewer can sense Tone's increasing sense of being burdened by his past actions.  He has gained weight, and is becoming more and more irascible, even as the immediate problems in his life (his mother and the loose cannon Richie Aprile) meet their appropriate fates.Rather than conflicts between characters (though there is plenty of that, with the grating Ralfie and the N-Syncly boorish Jackie Jr. as major examples), it is really Big Pussy's betrayal and the Family's response to it that stands like a looming ghost over Tony, Paulie and Silvio.  Try as they might in their various ways to bluff and bluster their way past what has happened, its clear that that whole incident has pulled each of these men closer to a psychological abyss.Silvio is no longer the ever affable ""man about town"". The episode set in the strip club was chilling in its intensity and in its casual revelation of Silvio's ruthless side. Even more disturbing, the formerly poised and level-headed Paulie has become territorial, mean-spirited and querelous perhaps even to the point of defection.  Treachery and despair lurk in the corners of this season of the Sopranos like drunken bigoted relatives at a wedding. Even Christopher (rapidly evolving from youthful idiot to a more stable and likeable character) feels the ripples of this new turn in the series' arc.On a more human level, Carmela, Meadow and Anthony Jr. also struggle with their own disaffections and problems with their involvement in ""the thing"" leading to confrontations by turns, comic, disturbing and wrenching with Tony's dark side.  Perhaps most pitiable is poor old Artie whose personal life just seems to hit rock after rock with no end in sight. He seems utterly bereft of any of the support the others gain from each other, and thus apparently at least, doomed.Tony himself is deep in the woods of his own psyche. For my money, one of the most disturbing scenes comes in the Christmas episode where he struggles to show his appreciation for the stolen ""Billy Bass"" innocently given to him by an Meadow while at the same time being overwhelmed by the toy's resemblance to his imagined reincarnation of Big Pussy as a dead fish on a fishmonger's display.  Rage and terror play across his face and writhe into nervous good humor and ""seasonal gratitude"". James Gandolfini deserves every cent he earns as an actor for that one scene alone.This season has turned the violence of the show inward on its protagonists. By sprinkling levity (as others have noted most obviously during the episode directed by Steve Buscemi - with shades of ""Fargo"", ""Twin Peaks"" and ""A Simple Plan""- , but also in slyer moments such as Furio's intimidation of an arrogant doctor -""You gotta bee onna your hat"" is now one of my favorite lines-, the archival footage of the OJ trials, and the appearance of a bland and annoying rock band called ""The Miami Relatives"") through this dark vision, the series maintains its dramatic integrity and its hold on the audience.I have not experienced any series that has been able to hold my attention and satisfy my taste for intelligent human drama like ""the Sopranos"" and that is why this DVD series gets 5 stars.  Hey I'd give it fifty if I could, but I have to send some of them up the food chain.",5,I gotta bad feeling about this one Tone,1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,4311,"['want', 'summary', 'plot', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'little', 'thought', 'peice', 'reasons', 'why', 'viewers', 'have', 'mo', 'fo', 'Tonese', 'amour', 'fou', 'relationship', 'series.First', 'agree', 'season', 'carried', 'best', 'parts', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'darker', 'maybe', 'even', 'wearier', 'tone', 'last', 'two', 'humble', 'opinion', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'series', 'TV', 'drama', 'characters', 'are', 'long', 'enough', 'temporal', 'arcs', 'can', 'undergo', 'serious', 'changes', 'character', 'temprament', 'thoroughly', 'convincingly', 'human', 'way', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'lasting', 'credit', 'make', 'convincing', 'engaging', 'utterly', 'compelling', 'ensemble', 'dramatic', 'work', 'absolute', 'best.One', 'example', 'Tony', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'see', 'charismatic', 'side', 'work', 'brilliantly', 'way', 'up', 'brutality', 'ambition', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'native', 'intelligence', 'charm', 'thoroughly', 'captivating', 'manner.By', 'third', 'season', 'viewer', 'can', 'sense', 'Tone', 'increasing', 'sense', 'being', 'burdened', 'past', 'actions', 'gained', 'weight', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'irascible', 'even', 'immediate', 'problems', 'life', 'mother', 'loose', 'cannon', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'meet', 'appropriate', 'fates.Rather', 'conflicts', 'characters', 'plenty', 'grating', 'Ralfie', 'N-Syncly', 'boorish', 'Jackie', 'Jr.', 'major', 'examples', 'really', 'Big', 'Pussy', 'betrayal', 'Family', 'response', 'looming', 'ghost', 'Tony', 'Paulie', 'Silvio', 'Try', 'might', 'various', 'ways', 'bluff', 'bluster', 'way', 'what', 'happened', 'clear', 'whole', 'incident', 'pulled', 'men', 'closer', 'psychological', 'abyss.Silvio', 'no', 'longer', 'ever', 'affable', 'man', 'town', 'episode', 'set', 'strip', 'club', 'was', 'chilling', 'intensity', 'casual', 'revelation', 'Silvio', 'ruthless', 'side', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'formerly', 'poised', 'level-headed', 'Paulie', 'become', 'territorial', 'mean-spirited', 'querelous', 'perhaps', 'even', 'point', 'defection', 'Treachery', 'despair', 'lurk', 'corners', 'season', 'Sopranos', 'drunken', 'bigoted', 'relatives', 'wedding', 'Even', 'Christopher', 'rapidly', 'evolving', 'youthful', 'idiot', 'more', 'stable', 'likeable', 'character', 'ripples', 'new', 'turn', 'series', 'more', 'human', 'level', 'Carmela', 'Meadow', 'Anthony', 'Jr.', 'also', 'struggle', 'own', 'disaffections', 'problems', 'involvement', 'thing', 'leading', 'confrontations', 'turns', 'comic', 'disturbing', 'wrenching', 'Tony', 'dark', 'side', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'pitiable', 'poor', 'old', 'Artie', 'personal', 'life', 'just', 'hit', 'rock', 'rock', 'end', 'sight', 'utterly', 'bereft', 'support', 'others', 'gain', 'other', 'thus', 'apparently', 'least', 'doomed.Tony', 'deep', 'woods', 'own', 'psyche', 'money', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'where', 'show', 'appreciation', 'stolen', 'Billy', 'Bass', 'innocently', 'given', 'Meadow', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'toy', 'resemblance', 'imagined', 'reincarnation', 'Big', 'Pussy', 'dead', 'fish', 'fishmonger', 'display', 'Rage', 'terror', 'play', 'face', 'writhe', 'nervous', 'good', 'humor', 'seasonal', 'gratitude', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'cent', 'actor', 'one', 'scene', 'alone.This', 'season', 'turned', 'violence', 'show', 'inward', 'protagonists', 'sprinkling', 'levity', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'most', 'obviously', 'episode', 'directed', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'shades', 'Fargo', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'also', 'slyer', 'moments', 'such', 'Furio', 'intimidation', 'arrogant', 'doctor', 'got', 'ta', 'bee', 'hat', 'now', 'one', 'favorite', 'lines-', 'archival', 'footage', 'OJ', 'trials', 'appearance', 'bland', 'annoying', 'rock', 'band', 'called', 'Miami', 'Relatives', 'dark', 'vision', 'series', 'dramatic', 'integrity', 'hold', 'audience.I', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'series', 'been', 'able', 'hold', 'attention', 'satisfy', 'taste', 'intelligent', 'human', 'drama', 'Sopranos', 'why', 'DVD', 'series', '5', 'stars', 'Hey', ""'d"", 'give', 'fifty', 'could', 'have', 'send', 'up', 'food', 'chain']",N/A

The only weak link I see is the Dr. Melfi character, portrayed by Lorraine Bracco. I feel she is just too formal and stiff. She seems unnatural in a show that shines with entirely believable characters.One highlight of this season is Tony's affair with Gloria (Annabella Sciorra). I feel Sciorra most convincingly depicts an attractive and emotionally unstable woman who is seduced by Tony's power and wealth. It seems she wants a lot of commitment from a man who has none to offer.Episode Eleven, Pine Barrens, is an absolute classic.

703795,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B000067S1G,darragh o'donoghue,"[274, 297]","The third series of 'The Sopranos' consolidates the brilliance of the first two, rather than taking it in any radically new directions.  The characters, their relationships and their environment are so strong; the dramatic irony between our sympathy with and enjoyment of these people, and our knowledge of their brutal and unhypocritically presented crimes, is so complex, that any blatant originality merely for the sake of it would be a betrayal.But, because the central components are so strong, there is plenty of room for play - in the way narratives are set up to encourage then defy expectations; in the interplay with canonical gangster texts, especially 'The Godfather'; in the consistently creative use of music - for mood and to emphasise character, yes, but also to create ironic distance, to add montages of 'commentary' over the stories, to connect apparently disparate scenes, to add a depth of texture.  Because it is in texture that 'The Sopranos' has really developed - the recklessly confident film-making; the layered scripts; the rich dialogue; and the knowing acting combine to create programmes of truly, yes, operatic density.There are a number of new plot developments in this series - Meadow goes to Columbia University; the FBI (in a supremely funny handful of episodes) attempt to bug the Sopranos; the Russian mafia grow in menacing importance; Janice takes up with a Christian musician; Anthony Jr. becomes increasingly unmanagable at school and at play, but proves an unexpectedly skilful footballer; Ralph (Joe Pantoliano) replaces Richie Aprile as the major made-guy thorn in Tony's side; Carmela feels increasingly guilty about her mob-financed luxury; Tony begins an affair with a beautiful, smart, successful car saleswoman (Anabella Sciorra) who has even more mental problems than he.  Most crucial for the series is the role of Jackie Aprile Jr., college-mitching son of Tony's former mob boss and best friend, who wants to see some of the criminal action, and starts dating Meadow as a spectacularly misjudged entree.  The major weakness of the second series - the tokenistic continuation of the Dr. Melfi framing scenes long after they've outrun their dramtic usefulness - is corrected by both bringing the psychotherapist (dangerously) closer to Tony's life, and by having Carmela join in the sessions, to comic effect.There is a brooding, elegiac feel to the series, with Tony thinking not just about his mother, but his dead friends, Pussy's actions in the last series, and the future possibilities open to the younger generation.  If nothing else, Series 3 boasts the best-ever episode of 'The Sopranos', directed by one Steve Buscemi, which begins farcically, with Paulie and Christopher accidentally killing an irate Russian, and bungling the disposal of his body in a snow-wasted forest; before turning into a nightmare, as they lose their bearings after the corpse runs off, and they are stranded in the middle of nowhere.  Loosened from the secure ties and identity-affirmation of family and Family, the episode brilliantly encapsulates what's at stake in the series, as unforgettably as the immortal 'Seinfeld' episode when the quartet can't find their car in the shopping mall car park.",5,A series that just gets better and better.,1021852800,"05 20, 2002",2002,3238,"['third', 'series', ""'The"", 'Sopranos', 'brilliance', 'first', 'two', 'rather', 'taking', 'radically', 'new', 'directions', 'characters', 'relationships', 'environment', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'sympathy', 'enjoyment', 'people', 'knowledge', 'brutal', 'unhypocritically', 'presented', 'crimes', 'so', 'complex', 'blatant', 'originality', 'merely', 'sake', 'would', 'be', 'betrayal.But', 'central', 'components', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'plenty', 'room', 'play', 'way', 'narratives', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'encourage', 'then', 'defy', 'expectations', 'interplay', 'canonical', 'gangster', 'texts', 'especially', 'Godfather', 'consistently', 'creative', 'use', 'music', 'mood', 'emphasise', 'character', 'yes', 'also', 'create', 'ironic', 'distance', 'add', 'montages', ""'commentary"", 'stories', 'connect', 'apparently', 'disparate', 'scenes', 'add', 'depth', 'texture', 'texture', 'Sopranos', 'really', 'developed', 'recklessly', 'confident', 'film-making', 'layered', 'scripts', 'rich', 'dialogue', 'knowing', 'acting', 'combine', 'create', 'programmes', 'truly', 'yes', 'operatic', 'are', 'number', 'new', 'plot', 'developments', 'series', 'Meadow', 'Columbia', 'University', 'FBI', 'supremely', 'funny', 'handful', 'episodes', 'attempt', 'bug', 'Sopranos', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'grow', 'menacing', 'importance', 'Janice', 'up', 'Christian', 'musician', 'Anthony', 'Jr.', 'increasingly', 'unmanagable', 'school', 'play', 'unexpectedly', 'skilful', 'footballer', 'Ralph', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'major', 'made-guy', 'thorn', 'Tony', 'side', 'Carmela', 'increasingly', 'guilty', 'mob-financed', 'luxury', 'Tony', 'affair', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'successful', 'car', 'saleswoman', 'Anabella', 'Sciorra', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'mental', 'problems', 'Most', 'crucial', 'series', 'role', 'Jackie', 'Aprile', 'Jr.', 'college-mitching', 'son', 'Tony', 'former', 'mob', 'boss', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'see', 'criminal', 'action', 'dating', 'Meadow', 'spectacularly', 'misjudged', 'entree', 'major', 'weakness', 'second', 'series', 'tokenistic', 'continuation', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'framing', 'scenes', 'long', ""'ve"", 'outrun', 'dramtic', 'usefulness', 'corrected', 'bringing', 'psychotherapist', 'dangerously', 'closer', 'Tony', 'life', 'having', 'Carmela', 'join', 'sessions', 'comic', 'brooding', 'elegiac', 'feel', 'series', 'Tony', 'thinking', 'not', 'just', 'mother', 'dead', 'friends', 'Pussy', 'actions', 'last', 'series', 'future', 'open', 'younger', 'generation', 'nothing', 'else', 'Series', '3', 'best-ever', 'episode', ""'The"", 'Sopranos', 'directed', 'one', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'farcically', 'Paulie', 'Christopher', 'accidentally', 'killing', 'irate', 'Russian', 'bungling', 'disposal', 'body', 'snow-wasted', 'forest', 'turning', 'nightmare', 'lose', 'bearings', 'corpse', 'are', 'stranded', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Loosened', 'secure', 'ties', 'identity-affirmation', 'family', 'Family', 'episode', 'brilliantly', 'what', 'stake', 'series', 'as', 'unforgettably', 'immortal', ""'Seinfeld"", 'episode', 'when', 'quartet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'car', 'shopping', 'mall', 'car', 'park']",N/A

703801,A1L0HZI35HF8OF,B000067S1G,Eric V. Moye,"[4, 7]","This is still among the best TV out there.  Why H.B.O. has kept us waiting more than a year is a mystery to me (maybe they were tired of winning so many Oscars?).  This release is timed, it appears to coincide with the new season commencing in November.The inconsistency felt by the main characters mirrors our feelings about them, and for me it is what makes them so incredibly compelling.  We sympathize (at least, I do) with them on the one hand while disapproving of their choices with the other.  The complexity for me is they key; the lines between good and evil are clear in my mind, but blurred in each of the characters surrounding patriarch Tony.  It does present any number of paths (not just the clear right and wrong) that he, his family and supporters may choose.Others have discussed the major themes in the season.  Richie Aprile is gone, his Father still wanting to hold onto the reins of power.  Richie's son, meanwhile, eschews a life of college for a life following in the family footsteps.  One bane of Tony's existence is gone but not forgotten (his Mother, who, through the magic of television is with us just one more time), and another, his sister Janice (and somnambulist mooching boyfriend) take her place.  A.J. has become a stud football player but almost overnight becomes a loser in school (almost headed to a Military Academy for the struggling adolescent).  Tony's shrink, Dr. Melfi gets him involved with anther patient who is more in need of an army of shrinks than Tony, his Mother, his sister and all of New Jersey.What makes the show work as it does is their interplay.  As but one example, the F.B.I. has a huge initiative aimed at taking down the Family.  Meadow, after seeming years of angst decides upon Columbia University.  These two end up hilariously intertwined (when will the suits realize that TV is actually funnier WITHOUT a laugh track?)  when the effort to bug the Soprano household ends up getting her dorm conversations and little else.But, a couple of the characterizations have run their course for me.  Meadow really tired me out two years ago, and has not improved herself.  Her life is so totally ruined, all because of her mean old Dad.  At least Carmella acknowledges the cognitive dissonance in her life (OK, maybe a priest AND a shrink of her own do help). Meadow is sufficiently self centered to blame him for ruining her high school graduation night because that is also the night when the Feds to come to the house to arrest him!  I kinda wish she had gone off to school in Burma, and we only see her through an occasional post card.  Ditto with Tony's new foil, Ralph Cifaretto.  One more scene with him, and I will want to join the Mob just so that I may blow his brains out.  Actually the best would be for that testosterone and coke-laden Christopher Molasanto to try and whack him, and letting them end up killing reach other!I may be guilty of expectations too high, but this Season left me a bit underwhelmed.  I think too many loose ends were left.  Given the buildup, we could have had a three hour season finale.  It should have explained what happened to the Russian that Paulie and Christopher ended up trying to kill (and his Boss, who was a Soprano ""ally"").I would have had Furio Giunta (the young enforcer who came back with Tony from the old country, who has become my favorite character) kill the unkillable Russian and his Boss, and then brutalize the kid who raped Dr. Melfi (how could they EVER leave that thread as they did?).  How about some  realization for either A.J. or Meadow that the life ends for too many folks like it did for Jackie Aprile, and an awful lot of bitter comes with the sweet they have perceived as entitlement?Great writing, though.  Don't take my word for it: go to the ""memorable quotes"" link (the censors probably would remove most of them from this review anyway.  Given what we did have this season, it would have been great TV for almost any other show (N.Y.P.D.-Blue should be so filled with compelling stories). But for this show, were we have come to expect nothing less, it left me wanting to tie up more.  I am not sure we need a ""Who shot J.R.?"" like another reviewer suggests, but the end of season left too much to be resolved for my particular tastes.  I guess that will make this upcoming season all the better.",5,"Very good, but not as good as seasons one and two",1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,4339,"['still', 'best', 'TV', 'there', 'Why', 'H.B.O', 'kept', 'waiting', 'more', 'year', 'mystery', 'maybe', 'were', 'tired', 'winning', 'so', 'many', 'Oscars', 'release', 'timed', 'coincide', 'new', 'season', 'commencing', 'November.The', 'inconsistency', 'felt', 'main', 'characters', 'mirrors', 'feelings', 'what', 'so', 'incredibly', 'compelling', 'sympathize', 'least', 'do', 'one', 'hand', 'disapproving', 'choices', 'other', 'complexity', 'key', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'clear', 'mind', 'blurred', 'characters', 'surrounding', 'patriarch', 'Tony', 'present', 'number', 'paths', 'not', 'just', 'clear', 'right', 'wrong', 'family', 'supporters', 'may', 'choose.Others', 'have', 'discussed', 'major', 'themes', 'season', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'gone', 'Father', 'still', 'wanting', 'hold', 'reins', 'power', 'Richie', 'son', 'meanwhile', 'life', 'college', 'life', 'following', 'family', 'footsteps', 'One', 'bane', 'Tony', 'existence', 'gone', 'not', 'forgotten', 'Mother', 'who', 'magic', 'television', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'sister', 'Janice', 'somnambulist', 'mooching', 'boyfriend', 'take', 'place', 'A.J', 'become', 'stud', 'football', 'player', 'almost', 'overnight', 'loser', 'school', 'almost', 'headed', 'Military', 'Academy', 'struggling', 'adolescent', 'Tony', 'shrink', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'involved', 'anther', 'patient', 'who', 'more', 'need', 'army', 'shrinks', 'Tony', 'Mother', 'sister', 'New', 'Jersey.What', 'show', 'work', 'interplay', 'one', 'example', 'F.B.I', 'huge', 'initiative', 'aimed', 'taking', 'down', 'Family', 'Meadow', 'seeming', 'years', 'angst', 'decides', 'Columbia', 'University', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'hilariously', 'intertwined', 'when', 'will', 'suits', 'realize', 'TV', 'actually', 'funnier', 'laugh', 'track', 'when', 'effort', 'bug', 'Soprano', 'household', 'up', 'getting', 'dorm', 'conversations', 'little', 'else.But', 'couple', 'characterizations', 'have', 'run', 'course', 'Meadow', 'really', 'tired', 'out', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'improved', 'life', 'so', 'totally', 'ruined', 'mean', 'old', 'Dad', 'least', 'Carmella', 'cognitive', 'dissonance', 'life', 'OK', 'maybe', 'priest', 'shrink', 'own', 'do', 'help', 'Meadow', 'sufficiently', 'self', 'centered', 'blame', 'ruining', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'night', 'also', 'night', 'when', 'Feds', 'come', 'house', 'arrest', 'kinda', 'wish', 'had', 'gone', 'off', 'school', 'Burma', 'only', 'see', 'occasional', 'post', 'card', 'Ditto', 'Tony', 'new', 'foil', 'Ralph', 'Cifaretto', 'One', 'more', 'scene', 'will', 'want', 'join', 'Mob', 'just', 'so', 'may', 'blow', 'brains', 'out', 'Actually', 'best', 'would', 'be', 'testosterone', 'coke-laden', 'Christopher', 'Molasanto', 'try', 'whack', 'letting', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'reach', 'other', 'may', 'be', 'guilty', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'Season', 'left', 'bit', 'underwhelmed', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', 'left', 'Given', 'buildup', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'three', 'hour', 'season', 'finale', 'should', 'have', 'explained', 'what', 'happened', 'Russian', 'Paulie', 'Christopher', 'ended', 'up', 'trying', 'kill', 'Boss', 'who', 'was', 'Soprano', 'ally', '.I', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Furio', 'Giunta', 'young', 'enforcer', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'Tony', 'old', 'country', 'who', 'become', 'favorite', 'character', 'kill', 'unkillable', 'Russian', 'Boss', 'then', 'brutalize', 'kid', 'who', 'raped', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'how', 'could', 'EVER', 'leave', 'thread', 'did', 'How', 'realization', 'A.J', 'Meadow', 'life', 'too', 'many', 'folks', 'did', 'Jackie', 'Aprile', 'awful', 'lot', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'have', 'perceived', 'entitlement', 'Great', 'writing', 'though', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'go', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'link', 'censors', 'probably', 'would', 'remove', 'most', 'review', 'anyway', 'Given', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'TV', 'almost', 'other', 'show', 'N.Y.P.D.-Blue', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'filled', 'compelling', 'stories', 'show', 'were', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'nothing', 'less', 'left', 'wanting', 'tie', 'up', 'more', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'need', 'Who', 'shot', 'J.R.', 'reviewer', 'end', 'season', 'left', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'resolved', 'particular', 'tastes', 'guess', 'will', 'make', 'upcoming', 'season', 'better']",N/A

This weekend, we had a Sopranos-Fest and watched the entire season in two sittings. While there were of course some truly exceptional episodes (in both writing and direction,) this season seemed to lack a strong dramatic driving force; there is much vague disgruntlement amongst the troops, and inexplicable actions on many peoples' parts. Still the relationships between the players remain as tangible and compelling as always, and perhaps that's more the point of the season, rather than dramatic developments. The strong relationships between characters is one of my favorite things about this show, but I did feel that there weren't many climactic points in this season. Still, the strength of the show pulls it through.There is the usual humor (subtle and laugh-out-loud,) and James Gandolfini is absolutely brilliant, as always; we've all come to know Tony so well, and Gandolfini absolutely *lives* in that character. Likewise, the other cast members do an outstanding job.  Meadow's development is particularly interesting this season, as she goes off to college, tries new paths, and even falls in love.Joey ""Pants"" is a welcome addition to the cast, and does a fabulous job playing the psychotic and manipulative Ralphie.I particularly enjoyed the episodes remembering Big [word], and tracing back when it was that he first flipped for the FBI, and the one directed by Steve Buscemi (which had a great homage to ""Miller's Crossing."")The season finale doesn't have any ""cliffhanger"" aspects per se, but there are some interesting questions left open that sort of buzz around in my head like noisy little flies; how will Tony ""save"" Anthony Junior? How far will Paulie's anger take him? Will Meadow seek help for her problem? When and how will Ralphie get his come-uppance? Is Christopher truly as disillusioned as he seems? Sadly, I'll have to wait until season four is released on DVD to find out.

The first season was brilliant, but the second seemed transitional, at best.  The talking fish, the side trip to Italy, the mini-rise and major fall of Richie Aprile--season II didn't seem to add up to all that much.  It was still better than 90% of whatever else is on television, but the question remained, was the bloom of the rose, had the Sopranos gone flat?The third season laid all doubts to rest.  In short, it was the best season yet.  Emmy winner Edie Falco got the screen time she unaccountably failed to get in the second season.  The sub-plot involving Melfi's rape and subsequent inner turmoil was much more solid dramatically than anything the writers came up with for Lorraine Bracco in the series' sophomore year.  And while some have complained that the loose cannon storyline involving Ralphie Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano) was a replay of the Richie Aprile storyline, it was actually a much more satisfying plotline (better developed with more twists--didn't Ralphie's doom seem inevitable after he ""disrespected the Bing""? Well, surprise!).  Aida Turturro's Janice is used to better effect this season.  And the storyline involving Meadow and her two profoundly different romances was just about perfect.  And how about Christopher and Paulie lost in the Pine Barrens?  A classic episode.And of course, James Gandolfini was just great.  Never a false note.  When you consider all the two-bit thug roles Gandolfini was consigned to prior to taking on this master thug role (and role of a lifetime) as Tony Soprano,  well, you're just grateful that this remarkable actor finally found a project that allowed him to demonstrate his full range.About the only thing Sopranos 3 lacked was Nancy Marchand (except in that awkward digitally generated scene in episode 2).  That couldn't be helped, of course, but her absence was at least somewhat compensated by marvelous turns by all the other female leads (and I would include new comer/special guest star Annabella Sciorra among them).I stopped getting cable two years ago, so I had to wait until the third season became commercially available to see it.  I had read plenty of good things about year 3 and was looking forward it.  Turns out it was well worth the wait.  Word on the fourth season is that it's a lot weaker.  I've learned to reserve judgment myself, but it does seem possible that the even numbered  years may prove to be, as noted above, ""transitional"" and less powerful dramatically.  If so, the planned fifth and final season, scheduled for 2003 or 2004 may still take the series out with a bang...

Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1""","[2, 2]","The thing that strikes me most about this season as opposed to the previous two seasons is that the tone is far darker.  One of the big themes is the dark pall cast over the entire family follwing the events of the last episode of the second season.  The absence of some of the more interesting chracters of the previous two seasons; like Big Pussy, Richie and of course, Livia creates a bit of a vacuum that's difficult to get used to.  Fortunately, the series stays afloat by working harder and smarter than the previous two seasons.While the series has lost a lot of it's humor, it's gained a lot of subtlety and complexity.  A lot of the characters that were window dressing in previous episodes now have something to say and do rather than fill stereotypes.  A lot of the best performances come from unexpected players or walk-ons.  Tony's new love affair provides one of the better twists and the best performance of the season from Annabella Sciorra.  While not ""as funny"" as the previous seasons, there are a few episodes which are absolutely hysterical.  The best single episode of the entire series is ""The Pine Barrens"" directed by Steve Buscemi (directors commentray included).  This one is almost worth the price of the entire set.I also think one of the big differences between this season and the prvious two is that it's not as self-contained.

703823,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000067S1G,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[1, 2]","The third season of ""The Sopranos"" continued on with its splendid storytelling, brilliant acting, and top-notch directing. Season three had at least one new challenge for writer/creator David Chase: dealing with the character of Tony's evil mother Livia. Chase originally had Livia written into the first several episodes of season three. Then Nancy Marchand, the actress who played Livia, died of lung cancer in June 2000. ""The Sopranos"" lost a dear member of the family, and Chase had to go back and re-write those episodes. In the second episode of season three (titled ""Proshai, Livushka""), Marchand made a cameo appearence as Livia with the help of previous existing footage and special effects. Then she dies, and the entire Soprano clan come together for her funeral. This is a good episode, even though the scene where Livia comes in for one last moment looks awkward. But Chase wanted to give Marchand and her character a fitting tribute to one of their own. ""The Sopranos"" also lost another regular cast member: Vincent Pastore, who played Tony's dear friend Pussy (and got whacked at the end of season two). Season three introduced a couple of new characters. Joe Pantoliano came on to portray unstable mobster Ralph Cifaretto; Annabella Sciorra guest starred in the latter episodes of season three as Gloria Trillo, a car saleswoman who Tony starts having an affair with; and Jason Carbone as Jackie Aprile Jr., son of the late mob boss Jackie Aprile Sr., who was always getting in trouble, which constantly aggravated Tony. Season three of ""The Sopranos"" featured some very strong episodes, including the fourth episode (""Employee of the Month""). This is the episode in which Tony's shrink Dr. Melfi gets raped, and features the best acting that Lorraine Bracco has done on the show. But probably the most talked about episode from season three without a doubt has got to be the eleventh, ""Pine Barrens"". To this day I still keep hearing people talk about this episode, in which two of Tony's wiseguys (Christopher and Paulie) get lost in the woods after unsuccessfully trying to whack a Russian mobster. This is a great episode, and is worth seeing just to watch the great acting by Michael Imperioli (Christopher) and Tony Sirico (Paulie). The third season of ""The Sopranos"" received 22 Emmy nominations, and won James Gandolfini and Edie Falco their second Emmys for Best Actor and Actress in a Drama Series. It also won an Emmy for the second time in the writing category for the episode ""Employee of the Month"".""The Sopranos"" season three is an absolute winner.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[8, 8]","As compelling as the first two seasons were, season three is even more compelling, which is at odds with what I'd heard from several different people.  Series creator David Chase obviously had to continue and even further improve on the intriguing and suspenseful saga that is the &quot;family&quot; life of New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano and he and the rest of the cast and crew did that quite successfully with this particular season.The entire season is set up quite beautifully with them giving a larger role to the Jackie Aprile Jr. character and them showing what Tony tried to do to keep the kid out of the business and harms way and of course, Joe Pantoliano's role as Ralph is brilliant in the conflict it creates between him and Tony.Every one of the actors and actresses deserve every award and accolade they've received for their performances in this brilliant season.  The ever beautiful Annabella Sciorra makes a very poignant and compelling guest appearance and her acting skills shine through in this role.I highly recommend not only this third season DVD set but every one that is available; you will be hard pressed to find a more compelling and intriguing series on television today that covers the material that the Sopranos does with such ease.Episode recaps:Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood - I truly enjoy how they begin every season with Tony walking down his driveway to get the paper and looking &quot;around.&quot;  In this brilliantly written season opener, FBI Agent Harris concocts a bold scheme to get a bug in Tony's basement where he holds &quot;private&quot; business meetings.Proshai, Livushka - Tony no longer has to worry about his mother ratting him out with the Feds when she passes away and the shows creators come up with a digital masterpiece to give Tony and Livia one final scene; meanwhile, Tony meets Meadow's new boyfriend from college and is not exactly pleased with his heritage.Fortunate Son - Christopher soon discovers that being a &quot;made&quot; guy isn't all it's cracked up to be as finds himself behind in payments to Paulie plus he allows Jackie Aprile Jr. to help him on a heist which doesn't exactly make Tony happy; Janice moves into Livia's house and immediately has a problem with the Russian housekeeper; Anthony discovers some leadership skills and something &quot;else&quot; on the football field.Employee of the Month - Ralph Cifaretto is starting to become a major problem for Tony; Dr. Melfi faces a major personal crisis which makes you wish she'd chosen differently at the end of the episode; Svetlana calls on the Russian mob to help with her conflict with Janice and Tony cannot help but wonder why Johnny Sack has moved to Jersey.Another Toothpick - Bobby Baccilieri Sr. comes out of retirement to make a hit against the wishes of his son and Junior; Christopher insists that Adrianna quits her job at Arties restaurant and Arties finds he must confront his feelings between both Adrianna and his wife Charmaine and Carmela is now taking a more active role in Tony's therapy.University - Ralph's behavior comes into even further question by Tony when Ralph has a volatile relationship with one of the strippers from Bada Bing; Meadow and Noah's relationship becomes strained due to her mentally instable roommate.Second Opinion - Tony convinces Junior to seek a second opinion; Carmela sees a different shrink and Christopher finds himself being even further humiliated at the hands of Paulie and his probationary period.He is Risen - Tony and Ralph's relationship becomes even further strained despite Johnny's &quot;efforts&quot; but Ralph's luck is about to change; Jackie Jr. and Meadow become involved, much to Tony's pleasure and Tony meets Gloria (Annabella Sciorra) at Dr. Melfi's office.The Telltale Moozadell - Tony meets Gloria at the Mercedes dealership and their relationship becomes a lot more interesting; Christopher gives Adrianna a night club; Anthony Jr. gets into some serious trouble at school and Tony has a serious conversation with Jackie Jr. about his relationship with Meadow....To Save us All from Satan's Power... - Tony is haunted by the ghosts of Christmas past; Janice has a new boyfriend and a music &quot;career&quot; and Furio and Tony pay a surprise visit upon a Russian who roughed up Janice.Pine Barrens - This episode has to be one of the most hilarious episodes of the entire series as Paulie and Christopher go to collect from a Russian and Paulie's mouth sets off the Russian and they &quot;whack&quot; him and take him to the woods but soon find out he's not dead and they end up lost in the woods; Tony's relationship with Gloria takes a very unexpected turn for him.Amour Fou - Ralph tells Jackie Jr. about how his father became a made guy and Jackie Jr. decides to attempt to follow in his fathers' footsteps and everything falls apart for him and Tony discovers that his relationship with Gloria is very similar to that which he had with his mother.The Army of One - Tony begins to seriously reconsider his practices as the head of two families; Anthony Jr. gets himself expelled from school and Tony tries to send him to a military school; Jackie Junior's attempt to become a made guy puts him at odds with the business and Meadow is

703831,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B000067S1G,L.A. Scene,"[3, 6]","By the time ""The Sopranos"" entered its third season, it had solidified its standing as a ""weekly event"".  There aren't many television shows in the 50+ years of television history that can be put into this category.  A ""weekly event"" show basically has everyone talking about the episode the next day.  In the 1980s, shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" were ""weekly events"".  In the 1990s, ""Seinfeld"" would take emerge as the show that would become a ""weekly event"".  As Seinfeld wound up, another show would soon take that title into the 21st century - that show being HBO's ""The Sopranos"".  The first two seasons of the show not only established a show of high entertainment value, but a show that also was of high quality.  Season 3,  ""The Sopranos - The Complete Third Season"" does have some very good episodes, it does take a slight notch down from the first two years.The show focuses on an organized Italian-American crime family that is based in North Jersey.  The main character of the show is Tony Soprano played brilliantly by James Gandolfini.  Tony is the head of the fictional DiMeo crime family.  On the show, we see Tony try to balance his ""work"" in the DiMeo crime family with his home life.  Tony also suffers from panic attacks and depression and therefore sees a psychiatrist - Dr. Jennifer Melfi (played by Lorraine Bracco).The problem I see with Season 3 is that it starts out slow.  While Season 2 started out a bit slow, Season 3 even has a slower start that lasts longer.  The opening episode involving the FBI wiretapping Tony Soprano's house is probably the weakest episode that aired throughout the 2+ seasons the show has been on.  At the same time, three of the strongest episodes to date are also included in this season:  ""...To Save Us All From Satan's Power..."" (The Christmas Episode); ""Pine Barrens"" (a Classic in which Christopher Moltisanti and Paulie Walnuts get lost in the Pine Barrens of South Jersey); and ""Amour Fou"" (the penultimate episode of the season).  The other point is that the Season's final episode is very weak.Here are some of the key storylines from Season 3:1-Tony and Carmela's marriage continues to endure great strain.  Things get more complicated during this season when Tony begins a torrid affair with a Mercedes Saleswoman Gloria Trillo (played by Annabella Sciorra).2- Christopher Moltisanti (played by Michael Imperioli) becomes a ""Made Man"".  Upon his entrance into the ""inner circle"", he begins to butt heads to the ""Captain"" he reports into - that being Paulie Walnuts (played by Tony Sirico).3- Joe Pantoliano joins the case as Ralph (Ralphie) Cifaretto.  Ralphie is a sarcastic character who is dating the widow of former DiMeo Crime Boss Jackie Aprile.  Ralphie plays a ""Made Man"" in the family and seeks a promotion to ""Captain"".  At the same time he is causing ""fits"" for Tony Soprano.  At times I found Pantoliano's character irritating.4-Dr. Jennifer Melfi is raped in Episode 4.  For the first two years, I feel this has been the most misused character on the show.  Although this crime provides an opportunity to expand Melfi's character, the producers once again do not take advantage of this.5-Tony and Carmela's daughter, Meadow Soprano (played by Jamie-Lynn Sigler) goes off to Columbia University.  She begins dating an African American Jewish Student (Noah Tannenbaum) and then the son of the late Jackie Aprile (Jackie Aprile, Jr.).  Both of these situations are going to also cause ""fits"" for Tony Soprano.6-Jackie Aprile Jr.(played by Jason Cerbone) begins to play a more prominent role on the show.  In addition to dating Meadow, he is also going to be involved with drugs while being influenced by his mother's boyfriend, Ralphie Cifaretto.  Despite causing ""fits"" for Tony, Tony will feel loyal to Jackie Jr. because of the relationship he had with Jackie Sr.7-As mentioned above, the FBI will start a wiretapping effort on Tony.  While this is the focus of the weak season opener to Season 3, this plot just seems to hit a dead-end as the season goes on. At the end of Season 2, Tony was arrested for counterfeit airline tickets - but this too goes nowhere during this season.8-Uncle Junior (played by Dominic Chianese) remains under house arrest as he awaits his day in court to battle the Federal Charges he is facing.  His health problems continue as he begins a battle with Stomach Cancer.9-Actress Nancy Marchand who played Tony's mother Livia passed away before Season 3.  As a result the character of Livia also dies, but not before some creative use of technology to have one more episode with Livia (even after Marchand's death).10-Anthony Soprano Jr. (played by Robert Iler) finds success on the Football field, but continues to get himself into trouble.Here are some other points to consider from Season 3:- Despite some weaker storylines, James Gandolfini really emerges during this season.  He provides some of his best acting during the season.- Paulie Walnuts has always been one of the better characters.  Next to Gandolfini's performances, it is Sirico's performance of Paulie that is second best..- Bobby ""Bacala""'s role expands during this year.  Bacala's portrayal of ""Santa Claus"" is hysterical.  This season also features a guest appearance from Burt Young as Bobby's father.- Vito Spatafore (played by Joseph R. Gannascoli) also begins to see an expanded role.As for the DVD packaging - besides the usual extras, one thing I really liked was how there was a brief textual synopsis provided on the screen before playing the episode.  Overall, I do think ""The Sopranos"" took a step down when comparing it to the previous two years.  However, watching Season 3 is still good enough to be categorized as a ""television event"".  Plus the three episodes mentioned above stack up among the show's best overall.  Overall, this is a very good and entertaining set - highly recommended.",4,"Still a Television Event, but a slight notch down from Seasons 1 and 2",1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,5892,"['time',

703832,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000067S1G,Lawyeraau,"[36, 37]","If you are looking at this review, you probably already have the first and second season. All I can tell you is that the third season is as good, if not better, than the first and second. This is truly one of the best series ever to have graced the television screen. Leave it to HBO to have come up with such an engaging, well-written, well-acted, and totally addictive series.There are some major plot developments this season. Starting off slowly, the first episode chronicles the synchronized, often comical efforts of the FBI, which is trying to get an electronic surveillance bug in place in the Soprano's household. The season then heats up considerably from thereon.Livia Soprano, Tony's wicked mother and a canker in her children's lives, dies, bringing daughter Janice back from where she had fled, after she had bumped off her manic boyfriend, Richie Aprile, last season. Janice returns with a narcoleptic, musician boyfriend who is the antithesis of Richie. As always, Janice likes to stir up trouble, and her mother Livia's wake and funeral services are fertile country for her new machinations and self-importance. When she tries to stir up trouble with Livia's one legged, Russian caregiver, which leaves the caregiver searching for her missing prosthetic leg, however, Janice soon discovers that she has gone too far, and her chickens come home to roost with a vengeance.Meadow, the Soprano's daughter and eldest child, a college student at Ivy League Columbia University, gets a new boyfriend, Noah Tannenbaum. He is handsome, intelligent, and articulate, and Tony hates him on the spot for reasons the viewer will quickly discern, as Tony pulls no punches with Noah. This will create a certain amount of tension between father and daughter, and an estrangement ensues. When Noah breaks her heart, Jackie Aprile, Jr. is waiting in the wings with her parent's blessing, and Meadow goes from the frying pan into the fire.Anthony Soprano, Jr., the Sopranos' other angst ridden teenager and youngest child, who has turned out to be an unexpected gridiron wonder, is also sowing his wild oats, getting himself in deep trouble at school, much to his parents' anger and dismay. When Anthony, Jr. continues in this vein, there is a big surprise in store for him, causing him to undergo a major life change. He is not, however, the only Soprano family member to do so.Tony finds himself head over heels with Gloria, another of Dr. Melfi's patients. A Mercedes car salesperson, Gloria, the new light of Tony's life, is gorgeous, passionate, and a totally loose cannon. She will cause quite a bit of conflict for Tony as their affair heats up, as Gloria likes to fight fire with fire. Gloria has to watch out that she, herself, does not get burned.Carmela, Tony's long suffering and patient wife, being only human, finds her thoughts increasingly absorbed by Tony's henchman, Furio, the sexy, pony tailed Italian. The problem is that Furio, too, is experiencing deep feelings for Tony's wife, a situation that can only become increasingly dangerous for all concerned. How Furio and Carmela handle their feelings and resolve this potentially dangerous development is of great interest.Dr. Melfi herself undergoes great personal angst this season, following her violent rape at the hands of a stranger. A very conflicted Dr. Melfi finds herself on the edge of taking a path from which there can be no return. This season also finds Dr. Melfi doing husband/wife tag team counseling with both Tony and Carmela, a venture that provides some comic relief and gives rise to potential conflict of interest.Meanwhile, Jackie Aprile, Jr., Tony's godson and Meadow's new main squeeze, the deceptively soft spoken and good looking son of the late mob boss, Jackie Aprile, Tony's best friend, is up to no good. Lying through his teeth about everything to everyone, he is misguided by his seriously unstable step-father, mob made man Ralph Cifaretto, who is busy plying both sides of the coin. It seems that Ralph, dissatisfied with the role to which he has been relegated within the family, is doing Tony dirty, going against his wishes at every turn, and the situation with Jackie, Jr. is no exception, a situation that will culminate in heartbreak for all concerned.Back at the ranch, Tony's other henchmen seem to have their own troubles. Corrado &quot;Uncle Junior&quot; Soprano, the nominal boss of the family, who is kept in check by his nephew Tony, is busy battling cancer and a federal prosecution. Young Christopher Moltisanti, Tony's nephew, gets his long desired promotion, and is told to report to Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gaultieri. Christopher soon finds out that with Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; business is business. Meanwhile, Christopher gets involved in a sideline that bodes ill for him and his fiancee.When Tony sends a resentful Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot;, accompanied by Christopher, on a mission that should have been that of another, Christopher sees an unexpected side of Paulie. When the mission, involving a member of the Russian mob, goes bad at the hands of an angry Paulie, Christopher discovers that Paulie may not be as stand up a guy as Christopher thought. While this is a terrific episode, very funny in a macabre sort of way, it also cleverly sets up Paulie in a new light for future developments. This particular episode, one of my favorites, is a feather in the cap of actor Stephen Buscemi, who directed it.These are just some of the highlights of the third season. There is so much more! The writing continues to be intelligent, and the story lines are as well thought out and engrossing as ever. The performances are uniformly stellar. The late, great actress, Nancy Marchand, whose portrayal of the venomous Livia Soprano was a feather in her cap, left a legacy of memories, having died after creating such a memorable character. She will sorely be missed. This third season's attempt to bridge her death and use existing footage and computer effects to create a dialogue between Livia and Tony, however, was misguided, as its effect is a tad ghoulish, as well as disturbing.  Nonetheless,  I absolutely love this series!",5,BADA BING...BADA BOOM...,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,6159,"['are', 'looking', 'review', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'first', 'second', 'season',

703835,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000067S1G,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 4]","Just watched a full thirteen hours of this just-released DVD.  Wow!This series just keeps getting better and better.  In spite of being involved in a violent lifestyle, each character comes across as very human.  I relate to them all.  And somehow, the writing is so good that I feel I'm right there, a member of the family.  These episodes fit together beautifully, and are part of the great mosaic that has been delighting viewers for the past three years.  I just recently became an HBO subscriber and actually saw only one or two episodes before the season ended.  But I'm all caught up now, after also viewing Seasons One and Two on DVD and can't wait to watch it week by week as the Season Four begins.One of the things I love most about the series is the depth of understanding the writers have of human nature.  The action of the story is true to the personalities of each character.  And afterward I can understand why their hard choices could only go one way, given who they are.  For example, there is a brutal rape episode in which the viewer wonders what will happen next.  Afterwards, however, because of previously established characterizations, I could understand that the episode couldn't have concluded in any other way.  There is also a humanization of one of the girls who work at the strip club, changing forever the viewer's perception of the realities of the trade.I've come to love Carmela with all her soul searching about her role of a Mafia wife.  And of course there is Tony with all his humanity, and some very erotic scenes with a seemingly sophisticated new lady friend.  Their relationship sparks and then disintegrates quite quickly and the attraction followed by repulsion was easy to understand.  Tony's children and his family life keep getting more interesting.  Meadow is at college now and has to deal with new relationships while still tied to the familiar.  And A.J. is showing signs of the same kind of panic attacks that affect his father. Tony's mother dies in the first episode and what follows regarding his sister's Janet's reaction is exactly the kind of scatterbrained nonsense mixed with cruelty that we've all come to expect from her.Tony's Mafia family is still true to what we've come to expect.  This year it's Ralphie we all love to hate. And then there's Jackie Jr. whose stupidity leads to tragedy. Tony still has feelings of guilt about previous acts of violence.  But I just love the fact that there are flashbacks instead of some of the silly dream sequences that appeared in episodes during the first two years.As a total package, this third year gets another super high recommendation.

I returned my copy, complained and they sent a replacement... of the same. I complained by phone, they apologized, returned my money and ended the case. I still do not have Season 3 with subtitles.

703855,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000067S1G,P Magnum,"[2, 2]","The third season of The Sopranos is marked by a violent streak throughout the season.  The year starts off slowly with the first episode revolving around the Feds trying to place a bug in the Soprano household.  It really is a wasted hour.  The second episode is also slow, revolving around the death of the family matriarch, Livia (due to the passing of the great Nancy Marchand).  Being that the first season of the show and really the basis of the show are Tony's struggles with the psychological abuse his mother placed on him, the show doesn't really spend much time with the incident.  But after the first two episodes, the season gets on role.  The new year introduces Joe Pantiliano as Ralphie Cifaretto, who has a nasty mean streak, a perverse obsession with the film Gladiator and a big problem with Tony.  The season's violent streak involves powerful episodes revolving around the rape of Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco has never been better in her portrayal of how a rape can scar one both physically and emotionally), Ralphie viscously beating and killing his stripper girlfriend (in the same episode Silvio smacks the girl around for skipping out on work), a man get savagely beat with a golf club, we learn that Tony had his first panic attack after witnessing his father chop off the finger of the butcher, Mr. Satriale and Tony comes to blows with his new girlfriend Gloria (played by Annibella Sciorra) that is one of the most intense and gripping scenes in the show's history.

703857,A2KE9VDX8GCAKE,B000067S1G,"""purplo""","[10, 11]","The third season of HBO's acclaimed Sopranos continues the established tradition of this film-quality television series.  The Sopranos are a fairly normal suburban New Jersey family except that the father, Tony, is the head of an organized crime organization.  In the third season, Tony's mother Livia dies (as did the actress that portrayed her, Nancy Marchand), daughter Meadow goes off to Columbia University, son Anthony, Jr. struggles to stay in high school, and Tony's mobster friends continue with their regular business ventures.  James Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony is always at the heart of the series' success.  He is able to pull off the difficult task of being likeable as a suburban father while simultaneously cheating on his wife and killing people.  People I know who don't usually care for onscreen sex, violence, and foul language are irrestibly drawn to this series because of its compelling performances, professional direction and screenwriting, and long-spanning story arcs.  There is a large cast of supporting characters whose stories progress as the audience becomes more familiar with them, as in a daytime soap opera.  Of course, some of them get whacked.  Actually, the third season has considerably less killing and nudity than the first two.  But the profanity continues in full force.  This is not material suitable for the kiddies.  To me the best aspect of the content of this series is the way it examines the themes of integrity, responsibility, and especially loyalty.  There is a perverse sense of justice when a disloyal mobster is ""disappeared"" by the collective efforts of his mob family.  The DVD extras are very slight.  The featurette is very short but does offer a chance to hear the actor who portrays Furio speak without his Italian accent.  The audio commentaries by actor/screenwriter Michael Imperioli, director (better known as an actor, though not of Sopranos) Steve Buscemi, and creator David Chase are among the least informative I have ever heard.  Buscemi, one of my favorite actors, is entirely too humble and deferential to the set-in-place Sopranos powers-that-be to deliver any sort of authority on his commentary.  But despite the lack of substantive DVD extras, this package is well worth watching to those who like competently delivered episodic television.  But do definitely start with the first season!",4,Oddly compelling despite subject matter,1041033600,"12 28, 2002",2002,2369,"['third', 'season', 'HBO', 'acclaimed', 'Sopranos', 'established', 'tradition', 'film-quality', 'television', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'are', 'fairly', 'normal', 'suburban', 'New', 'Jersey', 'family', 'father', 'Tony', 'head', 'organized', 'crime', 'organization', 'third', 'season', 'Tony', 'mother', 'Livia', 'did', 'actress', 'portrayed', 'Nancy', 'Marchand', 'daughter', 'Meadow', 'Columbia', 'University', 'son', 'Anthony', 'Jr.', 'stay', 'high', 'school', 'Tony', 'mobster', 'friends', 'continue', 'regular', 'business', 'ventures', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'portrayal', 'Tony', 'always', 'heart', 'series', 'success', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'difficult', 'task', 'being', 'likeable', 'suburban', 'father', 'simultaneously', 'cheating', 'wife', 'killing', 'people', 'People', 'know', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'care', 'onscreen', 'sex', 'violence', 'foul', 'language', 'are', 'irrestibly', 'drawn', 'series', 'compelling', 'performances', 'professional', 'direction', 'screenwriting', 'long-spanning', 'story', 'arcs', 'large', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'stories', 'progress', 'audience', 'more', 'familiar', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'course', 'get', 'whacked', 'Actually', 'third', 'season', 'considerably', 'less', 'killing', 'nudity', 'first', 'two', 'profanity', 'full', 'force', 'not', 'material', 'suitable', 'kiddies', 'best', 'aspect', 'content', 'series', 'way', 'themes', 'integrity', 'responsibility', 'especially', 'loyalty', 'perverse', 'sense', 'justice', 'when', 'disloyal', 'mobster', 'disappeared', 'collective', 'efforts', 'mob', 'family', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'slight', 'featurette', 'very', 'short', 'offer', 'chance', 'hear', 'actor', 'who', 'Furio', 'speak', 'Italian', 'accent', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'actor/screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'director', 'better', 'known', 'actor', 'not', 'Sopranos', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'creator', 'David', 'Chase', 'are', 'least', 'informative', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Buscemi', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'entirely', 'too', 'humble', 'deferential', 'set-in-place', 'Sopranos', 'powers-that-be', 'deliver', 'sort', 'authority', 'commentary', 'lack', 'substantive', 'DVD', 'extras', 'package', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'like', 'competently', 'delivered', 'episodic', 'television', 'do', 'definitely', 'start', 'first', 'season']",N/A

Her fellow-shrink husband is on her case about treating a gangster. And to top it off, she's attacked in her office building parking garage. Then the scumbag gets busted but walks on an evidence blunder. Although no one ever comes out and says it, she gives off unmistakeable vibes that she'd love to ask Tony to have the slimeball whacked!

703872,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B000067S1G,"the one and only ""david""","[11, 12]","The Sopranos, season 3, continues the story of Tony Soprano, a New Jersey mob boss who has to deal with all the hassels of organized crime as well as being the father of two kids and living in a tested marriage lifestyle. The thrid season does have its moments, and there are a lot of twists that made me want to continue on to season 4 and beyond...Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood: An FBI agent named Agent Harris and his team construct a plan to bug the Soprano's household while everyone inside are away. This requires extensive planning from everyone, including tailing all the members of the Soprano household, even the maid, and planning when the right exact time is to set up a bug in the house. Meanwhile Tony is watching for any suspicious behavior from Patsy Parisi, a brother whose twin was killed and who was an ally of Uncle Junior.Proshai Livushka: Tony is worried that his mom is going to rat on him to the Feds, but fortunately for him that never happens because Livia passes away. Despite her last wishes to not have a huge reception or funeral, Janice [Tony's sister] returns to throw a giant send-off. Meanwhile Meadow has a new boyfriend named Noah, who is both African American and Jewish, and Tony makes his own feelings for their relationship very clear, and it does not please Meadow one bit.Fortunate Son: Christopher finally becomes a made man, but soon realizes its not all glamour and glory. Janice moves into her mother's house, but realizes that the Russian nurse, Svetlana, has been given a valuable record collection. Tensions mount after Svetlana refuses to give the collection to Janice. Meanwhile Tony and Dr. Melfi finally began to make headway in figuring out just what is causing Tony's panic attacks.Employee of the Month: A man named Ralph, who took over the late mob boss Jackie Aprile's garbage business, is dating Jackie's widow and has endeared himself to Jackie's son, Jackie Jr. However he and Tony do not get along very much. However the real story is with Dr. Melfi, who becomes the victim of a very serious crime. Janice and Svetlana's feud comes to head with the introduction of the Russian mafia, and Tony can't help but wonder why a New York City mob boss, Johnny Sack, has come to town.Another Toothpick: A retired hit man named Bobby ""Bacala"" Baccilieri comes out for one last hit against the wishes of his son and Uncle Junior and ends up in a bloody and violent gunfight. Christopher convinces his girlfriend, Adriana, to quit her job at Artie's restaurant, which leads to some questionable antics by Artie. Carmela is now actually taking Tony's therapy sessions with him, which leads to some awkward moments in Dr. Melfi's office. Also Tony fixes a speeding ticket, but soon regrets his decision.University: Ralph is having a seriously violent relationship with a stripper that leads to a moment of violence between him and Tony in a parking lot. Meadow's relationship with Noah is put to the test when her needy roommate starts hanging around them all the time as they try to cheer her up.Second Opinion: Tony wants Uncle Jr. to get a second opinion about him possibly having cancer. Carmela takes Dr. Melfi's advice and starts seeing a shrink. Meanwhile Christopher has to continue to deal with embarrassing situations with Paulie regarding with him being a made man now, and finally Tony has a ""chat' with the wife of the late former friend of the family.He Is Risen: Tony's feud with Ralph soon starts to escalate after taking Ralph's invitation to come to Thanksgiving away. Ralph, upset at how he is being treated, goes to New York crime boss Johnny Sack for help. Meanwhile Meadow and Jackie Aprile Jr. soon realize they have a lot more in common than they thought and start dating. Also Tony sees a beautiful patient of Dr. Melfi's and generously gives up his appointment so the other patient can see Dr. Melfi instead.The Telltale Moozadell: Tony has a  new woman, a Mercedes saleswoman, and takes her all over the place in style. Christopher gives Adrianna her own club, while he and Furio are the two partners behind the scenes, but there are problems with drug dealing in the club which Furio takes care of. Also Anthony Jr. is caught vandalizing his school, but the punishment given to him from the school leaves Carmela a little puzzled. And finally Tony gives Jackie Jr. a serious talk about treating Meadow with respect.To Save Us All from Satan's Power...: Tony catches Jackie Jr. at a club with a woman who is not Meadow, and wants to ""talk"" to Jackie Jr. about it. Its Christmas time and for the first time in a long time there is no Santa to play for the kids coming to visit to get presents, so everyone points the finger at someone else to play Santa. Tony is also haunted by the memory of one of his former best friends, who he took out at the end of season two, and his memories only double after a Christmas present from Meadow.Pine Barrens: After losing a victim in the South Jersey wilderness, Paulie and Christopher struggle with injuries, hunger, extreme cold, and no idea if they will survive the night. Meadow starts to get a suspicion that Jackie Jr. is cheating on her, which leads to a surprising ending. Also, Tony's new mistress Gloria may have some hidden problems, problems that are surprisingly similar to another woman of Tony's past...Amour Fou: Jackie Jr. hears a tale from Ralph about how his own father became a made man and decides to rob a local card game. This decision may turn out to be his very last...Meanwhile Tony finds it harder and harder to spend time with Gloria, but after she threatens to tell Carmela all about their secret relationship, Tony has to figure out what to do with her. Meanwhile Carmela has had a huge guilt trip because of how she lives and where the money comes to pay for all her gifts from Tony and decides to confess to a priest.The Army of One: Anthony Jr. gets in trouble yet again at his school, so the decision is made to send him to military school to put some discipline into him. Also there is another death in the family that results in everything falling apart. Paulie is upset because Ralph owes him money, so they have a sit down to discuss things, and finally the entire family gathers in Artie's restaurant where Uncle Jr. makes his return to the family in full swing...This is still one of the greatest shows ever made. Each season is worth watching again and again. I will continue to review each season until I have finished the whole series. Season3, much like 1 and 2 that I have already reviewed, is highly recommended...",5,The Sopranos only gets better...,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,6571,"['Sopranos', 'season', '3', 'story', 'Tony',
