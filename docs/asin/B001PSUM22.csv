Worth watching in either the dubbed or the subtitled version. Dubbing is very good, keeping the spirit and humor of the series. I'll say it's not spectacular, but it is above average. Voice acting is excellent, especially ""Mone"" who manages to convey her meaning throughout the series with only the word mone as dialog.

1229769,ADTFUJS8HJN16,B001PSUM22,"Hajime Takai ""Fox_FX""","[26, 27]","Yumeria is a 12 episode (300+ minutes) series that follows Tomokazu Mikori, your basic loser who admits that he is a pervert. On his 16th birthday, he falls asleep, only to enter a world where he meets Mone, a young girl who will alter past and future events. It is now up to Tomokazu to save those he cares about from the Faydoom, evil creations in the dream world that are trying to invade the waking world. If he fails, all will be lost and the future devastated. Whats a 16 year old, perverted-loser to do?The series was pretty good and I found that the trailor that I viewed before I bought it didn't do the series justice. Yes, Tomokazu is a pervert in the series, but not to the extent that the trailor put him as, being as some people understandably don't like perverts. The story also reminded me somewhat of the Matrix in that it spans two worlds, where an event in one will affect the other. This is also one of those series where you have to watch in order to understand everything that is going on and as this story style, as previous reviewer put, ""sucks you in"". Even with a complex storyline, the pieces do fit in an easy to understand way (once you see it), like with me I caught myself saying ""Oh that's why so and so did such and such"". The story also makes indirect, outside references to other anime series such as Sailor Moon and Sister Princess, these two being ones that I could pick out right away.Character design and special affect design was outstanding. I would go as far as to say that the people who worked on these affects are some of the best, if not the greatest, from what I've seen so far. The characters were cute, and if not, then visually appealing in that they catch your eye. The designers who worked on the characters also deserve some recognition because I could not find one character, and this includes stand-in characters, that did not look fantastic.Keep in mind that the series does focus around a kid that is a bit of a pervert so there are some sexual references and hardly any nudity, if you  would consider these few parts nudity. As with other series that I've seen that involve such topics, it works with the series and just adds to the comedy.Overall, the series was filled with laugher(alot of it I might add)and jaw dropping action that literally made me keep watching. As I said with the Maburaho review, this is another series that could have been made longer because the story is so good and detailed that people would have kept watching. For anyone that is looking for another addition to their collection or beginning a collection, this is a must have.

1229770,AK019BF9HMELY,B001PSUM22,"Jay F. Grissom ""JF""","[2, 2]","I could see this appealing to a young (teenage male) audience.I had seen some pretty mediocre reviews for this online at other sites. Then I saw some great reviews here and decided to buy it...I've been betrayed by the reviews here a couple times... and I thought this would be different but it wasn't.It isn't remarkable... there is plenty of fan service... but this holds little else of value in my opinion.It is pretty middle of the road anime. When it was over my wife and I were not excited to see a follow up if there is one...So here is my breakdown:1) The art: Pretty average. It reminds me of stuff you would see from a low budget project. Compared to the cover art it lacks considerably. The production quality isn't the highest I've seen when it comes to the art.2) The audio: I really enjoy bubbly anime soundtracks so I found that to be the best part of this anime. The audio is fun and playful so I really liked it... The audio is why I bumped this from 2 stars to 3.3) The Boxset: Again pretty average the back particularly suggests some fan service and this does well in that department. The fan service isn't so ""in your face"" that you are offended but they lay it on pretty thick. The box is pretty standard. It does however look good in your collection.4) The Characters: The depth in the character development is done pretty well. But it follows the standard harem anime formula. One Lolita-type, One Mature and Sexy, One very young and playful, and two that you are closer to being at odds for the affection of the target male.They do make some effort to give you the back story for each character and that part is done pretty well... again another one of those items pushing this from 2 stars to 3.Each of the female characters has a unique characteristic that make them attractive in their own way. One is soft spoken and needs the ""night in shining armor"". While the other plays out a motherly roll. Etc... Etc... They all have characteristics that appeal to men in one way or another.The plot and story are pretty much there to showcase the girls... and there are some plot twists that are obvious from the moment you start watching the first disc. REALLY obvious plot twists... it is almost insulting to your intelligence.Again this isn't meant to challenge your intellect or bring any new paradigms to the anime viewer... it simply is very average work.Not bad... not good...Just OK.",3,I wanted to like it.

As it turns out all the girls that he meets in the dream world either live with him or go to school with him. This may be a good chance for Tomokazu to score. He might just get lucky.The story is pretty flimsy. I honestly can't remember all the details of the plot, but this anime is still a pretty solid title I think.

1229773,AFV2584U13XP3,B001PSUM22,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]",The series was for the most part a nice light-hearted semi-harem anime with a touch of action drama though the drama part didn't really pan out for me.  The series main Tomokazu Mikuri a high school under achiever usually picked on by his home room teacher and for the most part not a big ladies man either though he lives with a couple of attractive females who though family by name or not related by blood.  The more dramatic story plot part of the series can get very confusing at times unless you really listen to what the character is telling in the narration but even then it feels a little weak for the story plot they planned for in the series.  None of the characters are unlikable but neither are any of them very memorable either as you just can't seem to take the drama in the series very seriously to begin with.  The voice cast by both the subbed and dubbed actors/actresses did their roles well so no complaints on that part and the animation for the most part was very good too though the soundtrack was at time 50/50 but not the worse by far.  The series is still worth checking out and getting if you can for under $30.00 dollars if it goes above that price I suggest checking a few episodes online just to be sure if you still want to get it....,4,Enjoyable Series But Not A Very Memorable One Either,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1265,"['series', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'nice', 'light-hearted', 'semi-harem', 'anime', 'touch', 'action', 'drama', 'drama', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'pan', 'out', 'series', 'main', 'Tomokazu', 'Mikuri', 'high', 'school', 'achiever', 'usually', 'picked', 'home', 'room', 'teacher', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'big', 'ladies', 'man', 'couple', 'attractive', 'females', 'who', 'family', 'name', 'not', 'related', 'blood', 'more', 'dramatic', 'story', 'plot', 'part', 'series', 'can', 'get', 'very', 'confusing', 'times', 'really', 'listen', 'what', 'character', 'telling', 'narration', 'even', 'then', 'little', 'weak', 'story', 'plot', 'planned', 'series', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikable', 'are', 'very', 'memorable', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'drama', 'series', 'very', 'seriously', 'begin', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'actors/actresses', 'did', 'roles', 'well', 'so', 'no', 'complaints', 'part', 'animation', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'time', '50/50', 'not', 'worse', 'far', 'series', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'getting', 'can', '30.00', 'dollars', 'price', 'suggest', 'checking', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'still', 'want', 'get']",Yumeria: Complete Collection

Then his 16th birthday comes and is yet another dull day in his life, but when he goes to sleep, he finds himself in a strange world.  After looking around, he sees a giant monster and a little girl with wings doing battle with one another.  The girl falls from the sky and Tomokazu saves her and using a power (that's currently unknown to him) recharges the girl so she can defeat the monster.Upon waking, the girl from his dream is laying in bed with him.  Tomokazu has inherited a special power, and that power is to save the everyday world and the dream world from fierce monsters made from the dark thoughts and feelings of people; bent on destroying both worlds.  Tomokazu with Mone (the girl from his dreams) as well as childhood friend Mizuki, Kuyou, Neneko/Neito, Megumi, and a mysterious person known as Silk to defend both worlds from destruction.  But they can only defend both worlds while they are asleep.I'll leave my little preview at that because I don't really want to give away too much of the story for those who are interested in purchasing this anime.
