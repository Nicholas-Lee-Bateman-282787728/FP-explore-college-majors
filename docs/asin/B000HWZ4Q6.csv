1017312,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B000HWZ4Q6,Alanna Evans,"[0, 0]","This is NOT a sequel to the Fox and the Hound, rather this is a story that takes place somewhere in the middle of that movie.Tod and Copper stumble upon a country fair in their quaint country town and through a matter of circumstance, Copper ends up being a ""star"" of the Singin Strays singing dog group.  This leads to turmoil within the band, as one of their own talented divas gets ousted in favor of the newcomer, as well as Tod becomes depressed as he gets pushed to the background as Copper rises to stardom (at the fair though, of course).  This keeps enough conflict to make the movie an exciting journey, told through rich characters, beautiful bright animation, a cornucopia of great country music performed by professional stars from the heartland, memorable voice acting and a decent story to tie it all together.It's great to see Copper and Tod back together again in their ""puppy/cubhood"" - something that was perhaps not fleshed out enough in the first film.  Yet the real stars of the show are Cash (voiced by Patrick Swayze) and the diva dog Dixie voiced by Reba McEntire.  These two have spunk and fire and its great seeing them banter back and forth in their personal and professional relationships (which naturally intertwine).The great music, slapstick comedy and friendly characters make this a fun watch for children of all ages.  I purchased it when my three year old seemed interested in it from the commercials and previews on other DVDs and it became an unlikely hit for the whole family.Two thumbs up and four stars.  One star removed because the story could have been tightened up a bit, but other than that, this is a surprisingly solid effort from Disney.",4,A Great Mid-quel!,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,1686,"['NOT', 'sequel', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'rather', 'story', 'place', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'movie.Tod', 'Copper', 'stumble', 'country', 'fair', 'quaint', 'country', 'town', 'matter', 'circumstance', 'Copper', 'up', 'being', 'star', 'Singin', 'Strays', 'singing', 'dog', 'group', 'turmoil', 'band', 'one', 'own', 'talented', 'divas', 'ousted', 'favor', 'newcomer', 'as', 'well', 'Tod', 'depressed', 'pushed', 'background', 'Copper', 'stardom', 'fair', 'course', 'enough', 'conflict', 'make', 'movie', 'exciting', 'journey', 'told', 'rich', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'bright', 'animation', 'cornucopia', 'great', 'country', 'music', 'performed', 'professional', 'stars', 'heartland', 'memorable', 'voice', 'acting', 'decent', 'story', 'tie', 'together.It', 'great', 'see', 'Copper', 'Tod', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'puppy/cubhood', 'something', 'was', 'perhaps', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'first', 'film', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'Cash', 'voiced', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'diva', 'dog', 'Dixie', 'voiced', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'two', 'have', 'spunk', 'fire', 'great', 'seeing', 'banter', 'back', 'forth', 'personal', 'professional', 'relationships', 'naturally', 'intertwine', '.The', 'great', 'music', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'friendly', 'characters', 'make', 'fun', 'watch', 'children', 'ages', 'purchased', 'when', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'seemed', 'interested', 'commercials', 'previews', 'other', 'DVDs', 'became', 'unlikely', 'hit', 'whole', 'family.Two', 'up', 'four', 'stars', 'One', 'star', 'removed', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'up', 'bit', 'other', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'effort', 'Disney']",N/A

I thought at first this was the second generation, but no, apparently this is some alternate universe, or perhaps what happened before Copper was taken away to the winter cabin to learn hunting. In any case, it is the summertime, because the county fair is open.In fact, the bulk of the action takes place at the county fair. There is a singing dog troupe called the Singing Strays, ""owned"" by a guy with a banjo and a broken down old bus. Their big hope is that a talent scout from the Grand Ole Opry is expected today. He and his escort, a girl scout working on a merit badge, provide a good bit of the slapstick style humor of the movie.But things go wrong when the constant bickering between the male lead (Cash) and the female lead (Dixie) results in Dixie quitting and/or Cash firing her. It's not quite clear which is which, but it is clear that pride is the main problem. Anyway, while watching the rest of the troupe attempting to do their performance without Dixie, Copper starts singing along, and they discover he's really good. Also, being a cute little pup doesn't hurt with his pupularity. (Sorry.) Cash invites Copper to join the band, and tells Tod he can be in the entourage.Of course, Dixie does her best to sabotage Copper's performance, because she really wants her job back, and she's clearly still in love with Cash. And it turns out he's still in love with her, too. But that pride thing . . .It's fun and funny, although not as good, either story-wise or visually, as the first movie.

I hated seeing Tod and Copper grow up, but still the movie was great.  When I saw that they would remain young in the 2nd movie, I was very anxious to see it.Unfortunately, I don't think they spend enough time on the two main characters, Tod and Copper.  And the plot is off for it to be a sequel.  The main character is now a dog named Dixie. This is Reba McIntyre's character and she does do a great job.The storyline goes that Copper tries his hand at being a singing celebrity and he spends all his time with some singing dogs instead of Tod.  So Tod and Copper don't interact as much, which I thought was the best part of the first movie, because they acted like kids and they were sooooo cute.Tod and Copper were just not as cute in this movie as they were in the first.Reba and Trisha's singing voices were the highlights.  I was excited that Jeff Foxworthy was in the movie, because he makes cute characters, but his character was too minor for him to have an effect.Bambi II was excellent and I thought that the Fox and the Hound 2 would follow that same excellence but it didn't.

So you have to pretend this happened sometime in the middle of their lives when Copper wasn't trying his best to kill his supposed friend Tod the fox.  Logic aside, this is really just an excuse to cash in on the name recognition of the first film.  It's a jaded attempt by the Disney folk to make as much money as possible while putting out cheap knockoffs promising continuations of their favorite films.  They do this with alarming regularity because they know there will be people like me who will take a chance that this will be every bit as good as the first film and therefore a joy to behold.  Since I didn't like the first film, chances are I wasn't going to like this one any better.  Weirdly though, I actually did like it a bit more (mainly because the gun happy old coot wasn't in it as much and wasn't trying to shoot every living thing in sight).  Instead, the story focuses on Copper's need to be in the spotlight.  He takes the place of an obnoxious diva Dixie (voiced by Reba McEntire), who naturally wants her job back once she sees how easily she can be replaced.  While the songs are marginally better than the ones in the first film, these too are instantly forgettable.  There was less killing, less of a need for killing, and more fluff in this sequel.

Twenty-five years later, the sequel was made and the decision was to pair it with the country music market.  That choice has worked magic, bringing a lively soundtrack to a great romp of a tale that plays off the original characters and situations in a way that makes it feel like only days have passed instead of years.Country music legends Reba McEntire and Jeff Foxworthy head up the cast of voice talent.  They're joined by Patrick Swayze, who even joins in on some of the songs.Although this time out the tale feels a little too familiar (two friends busted up by one friend's drive for fame), the fun that came alive in THE FOX AND THE HOUND strikes again.  The chases that occur throughout the film are a delight to watch.  One thing always leads to another, and chaos just builds and builds till Tod and Copper look around in shock at all they've unwittingly destroyed.  The camaraderie between the two is great, and Reba and Patrick's addition to the cast is well done for the most part.The only thing that slows the movie down somewhat is the deepening of the relationship issues between Dixie (Reba McEntire) and Cash (Patrick Swayze).  That subplot comes on a little too strong and steals too much of the movie occasionally.THE FOX AND THE HOUND 2 is definitely a keeper, one that belongs on the family DVD shelves.  Sometimes sequels don't equal the originals, but this one comes close, and it provides a whole new musical sound that is heartwarming and makes you want to get up and dance.

1017339,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B000HWZ4Q6,unicornelia,"[11, 13]","For once I was expecting total disappointment and got better than I ever would have hoped for. Yes, this is a ""midquel,"" but once you've seen the (incredible) first you can sort of imagine where these events might fit in. This has its own climax and all, but the plot fits within the original's parameters. It might not make 100% sense, but to go back and do something like this is pretty tough. It's all right.So, what's good about The Fox and the Hound 2? Much more than anyone expects. First, the obvious animation. It, and the scenery, are wonderful. Bright, bold, shiny, fresh colors, detailed and true-to-the-first backdrops. Very expressive characters who are just delightful to watch--the way the dogs move is fantastic and well done. Obviously the animation is not perfect; it never is in ANY animated film. There will always be flawed frames. As you would have expected for a Disney sequel, it is inconsistently good--but, ESPECIALLY for a Disney sequel, it remains excellent overall. But for a Disney sequel of all things, this certainly seems top-knotch.As to the country music, well, even if you're not normally a fan, there is nothing to dislike about the movie's songs. Particularly ""Good Doggie, No Bone."" (Great song. Like ""Streets of Gold,"" it's sung to a young animal to educate them about something [it's really about herself, and what she's learned the hard way about relationships and being 'at the top.'] And ain't that what life is, too, though? ""It's all, `Good doggie,' but no bone!"") They're nicely done by stars from the heart of country music, as explained on the DVD bonus feature.And the story? Surprisingly great too; good dialogue, witty and humorous bits, good character development. None, or very little of, the usual sequel hokiness and cheese I'd anticipated. The story of the county fair and Singin' Strays band is actually very believable, and at least the concept fits into the down-homey, rural environment of the Fox & the Hound setting. There are so many highlights it's hard to remember them all, but the scene near the end, in which the group performs for a jolly talent scout outside a quaint, old-fashioned diner comes to mind for one. The setting just helps to make the story work; that little diner is so cute, and so perfect for the scene.I'm still dismayed to see sneak peeks for Cinderella 3 and The Little Mermaid 3 on the DVD, but at least this movie gives me hope that somebody still may know what they're doing making these sequels. Then again, this movie was almost tailored directly to me. More than anything I am a sucker for singing and dancing dogs: show me a film centered around that, and you've got me. I like to imagine a world where everyone's a dog and there are musicians along the lines of the Singin' Strays anyway, but even without such a love for this type of thing, you can appreciate the movie. It stands well enough on its own. But I'm saving the best parts for last.Yes, it's pretty original; far from perfect, of course, but I won't run down all of the weaker points because as with any sequel, there are many. However, they don't drag down the big picture. Tod and Copper are naturally your young and precious main characters, but Chief, Widow Tweed and Amos Slade haven't been left out--or ruined, either. Chief is especially well- animated and a good source of humor (and kinda resembles Tramp.) The one character, though, who in my opinion really makes the movie great--in fact she makes the movie--is Dixie. When I first saw her and Cash on the cover, my impression was: `OMG! It's Dodger and Rita from `Oliver and Company' redone!' Because Cash's bandana HAS to be an homage to Dodger. And Dixie has that same sort of look as Rita, perhaps somewhat more polished (which is my favorite 'look' in the world and when I see such a character, it's instant Favorite)--seriously, she's her cover-art twin.Well, turns out Dixie is something like the country cousin of Sasha LaFleur, another sequel-starring performer and Rita-type. (There's a proud little tradition of animated Saluki-like dogs, of which Rita, Sasha, & Dixie are the main representatives, which I have adored with a strong passion since childhood!) Dixie also has her similarities with Georgette, the Oliver & Company Poodle. A force to be reckoned with and of course the love interest of Cash, she's the most interesting character. Thanks to show business, her and Cash's relationship is a very rocky road. Visually Dixie, like her predecessors, is an amazing character to watch; the way she moves and dances just perfectly captures how you'd want to look if you were a dog--at least, how I would! She steals every scene she's in, & has an awesome personality that includes a devious streak, and I'm glad she's such a central character. Her song is probably the best part of the film. In fact, this movie probably should have been a separate, Singin Strays-centric non-sequel. So to wrap up, this movie basically blew me away--two thumbs up just for stunning me.",5,Surprisingly good.,1165881600,"12 12, 2006",2006,5005,"['once', 'was', 'expecting', 'total', 'disappointment',
