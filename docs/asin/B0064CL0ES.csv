My daughter likes most of the songs, but is not as interested in it as the first one. I definitely love ""Head Shoulders Knees and Toes,"" ""Colors of the Rainbow,"" ""If You're Happy and You Know It,"" ""Eat 'Em All Up,"" and ""If All the Little Raindrops."" I'd recommend that parents take sneak previews of the DVD on youtube before buying it.",3,"Good, but not as great as the first",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,448,"['graphics', 'are', 'as', 'beautiful', 'ones', 'first', 'DVD', 'difference', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'catchy', 'daughter', 'most', 'songs', 'not', 'as', 'interested', 'first', 'one', 'definitely', 'love', 'Head', 'Shoulders', 'Knees', 'Toes', 'Colors', 'Rainbow', ""'re"", 'Happy', 'Know', 'Eat', 'All', 'Up', 'Little', 'Raindrops', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'parents', 'take', 'sneak', 'previews', 'DVD', 'youtube', 'buying']",N/A

I already have both dvds for my daughter since she's been born and she's now 2 and she still loves to watch them. Now she's starting to sing along and so are we. I can say its become a staple in our house and when our friends have a new one its what we purchase for the babys always.

The music is more soothing than Volume 1 so it is almost like a bedtime story. I have notice no matter what time of day it looks sleepy afterwards so this is great before nap time too!,5,Great before bedtime,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,253,"['youngest', 'excited', 'listen', 'watch', 'DVD', 'bed', 'music', 'more', 'soothing', 'Volume', '1', 'almost', 'bedtime', 'story', 'have', 'notice', 'matter', 'what', 'time', 'day', 'sleepy', 'afterwards', 'great', 'nap', 'time', 'too']",N/A

1509248,A3M0CGBW9D3AFU,B0064CL0ES,MoRuemerz,"[0, 0]","I originally was hearing a sound distortion on this DVD in the voice tracks. The GiggleBellies folks were awesome and corresponded with me to get more information, and they replaced the DVD and send an envelope to reclaim the old one. After a lot of comparative examination, I found that the original played perfectly on my laptop, and had the greatest distortion on my LG television that had ClearVoice II technology (voice enhancement). I am guessing the distortion on the other two televisions may have been an &#34;unemphasized&#34; feature of those TV's to enhance voices...but I found I could turn off the ClearVoice II and the music and voice tracks were true and fun. I really appreciated the excellent service and care the GiggleBellies folks took to address my issue and look forward to their next Volumes! This 2nd Vol also features the endless loop of play...which is handy for some parents-- though I enjoy my baby &#34;announcing&#34; with her slight whimper that the last song is playing and I choose to restart it for her or to give her something different for variety.",5,Great DVD and Great Service!,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1085,"['originally', 'was', 'hearing', 'sound', 'distortion', 'DVD', 'voice', 'tracks', 'GiggleBellies', 'folks', 'were', 'awesome', 'corresponded', 'get', 'more', 'information', 'replaced', 'DVD', 'send', 'envelope', 'reclaim', 'old', 'one', 'lot', 'comparative', 'examination', 'found', 'original', 'played', 'perfectly', 'laptop', 'had', 'greatest', 'distortion', 'LG', 'television', 'had', 'ClearVoice', 'II', 'technology', 'voice', 'enhancement', 'am', 'guessing', 'distortion', 'other', 'two', 'televisions', 'may', 'have', 'been', '34', 'unemphasized', '34', 'feature', 'TV', 'enhance', 'voices', 'found', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'ClearVoice', 'II', 'music', 'voice', 'tracks', 'were', 'true', 'fun', 'really', 'appreciated', 'excellent', 'service', 'care', 'GiggleBellies', 'folks', 'took', 'address', 'issue', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'Volumes', '2nd', 'Vol', 'also', 'endless', 'loop', 'play', 'handy', 'parents', 'enjoy', 'baby', '34', 'announcing', '34', 'slight', 'whimper', 'last', 'song', 'playing', 'choose', 'restart', 'give', 'something', 'different', 'variety']",N/A
