In the Special section, David Kemper reviews each episode and I found this both valuable and entertaining. I enjoyed this special feature more than any other in the 3 seasons out so far. David presents an excellent, concise review that is well delivered. I wish they would have had him do the same for the previous 2 seasons. David and his observations are the garnish on another outstanding season for Farscape.",5,Season 3 Wrap,1066348800,"10 17, 2003",2003,531,"['Farscape', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'series', 'start', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'intended', 'dark', 'season', 'David', 'Kemper', 'Special', 'section', 'David', 'Kemper', 'episode', 'found', 'valuable', 'entertaining', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'feature', 'more', 'other', '3', 'seasons', 'out', 'so', 'far', 'David', 'excellent', 'concise', 'review', 'well', 'delivered', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'same', 'previous', '2', 'seasons', 'David', 'observations', 'are', 'garnish', 'outstanding', 'season', 'Farscape']",N/A

I won't spoil anything by telling you how the cliffhanger occurs, but I would recommend you have collection 1 of season 4 handy. You will want to get right on with the story. Farscape equals and surpasses many of the scifi series that have cluttered TV over the ages. It has the production value of a major studio series, great settings and locations, and apparently spares no expense in delivering excellence to the viewer. I've always been a fan of all 5 Star Trek series and Farscape is just as good and sometimes better. The writing is fantastic, the acting is first rate, and the plot twist are intricate and deeply layered.",5,Just keeps getting better,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,729,"['Season', '3', 'was', 'where', 'series', 'really', 'got', 'interesting', 'delved', 'very', 'intense', 'story', 'arcs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'telling', 'how', 'cliffhanger', 'would', 'recommend', 'have', 'collection', '1', 'season', '4', 'handy', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'right', 'story', 'Farscape', 'equals', 'many', 'scifi', 'series', 'have', 'cluttered', 'TV', 'ages', 'production', 'value', 'major', 'studio', 'series', 'great', 'settings', 'locations', 'apparently', 'expense', 'delivering', 'excellence', 'viewer', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', '5', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'Farscape', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'sometimes', 'better', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'plot', 'twist', 'are', 'intricate', 'deeply', 'layered']",N/A

Bernabo,"[10, 11]","Season 3 of &quot;Farscape&quot; began with Aeryn Sun dead, but she was brought back to life by Zhaan (who then proceeded to die), so that we are basically able to end up the season right where we started, with another traumatic separation for Crichton and Aeryn.  However, before we get to this season's cliffhanger, there are some major plot lines to be resolved regarding Scorpius and Crichton's plan to take him down once and for all:Episode 63, &quot;I-Yensch, You-Yensch&quot; (Written by Matt Ford, Aired January 21, 2002) begins with Dargo and Rygel actually meeting with Scorpius to negotiate immunity for Moya's crew in exchange for Crichton aiding Scorpius in his wormhole research.  To establish good faith, the principle parties get to wear I-Yensch bracelets, which make you feel the pain of the other person: hit Crichton in the head and Scorpius will goes reeling.  In this episode, the negotiators get to find out how much fun this can be for themselves.  Meanwhile, Talyn, who has become increasingly paranoid, fires on a hospital ship and kills 6,000 innocents.  Crais recommends shutting down Talyn and basically resetting him, but neither Talyn nor Moya are receptive to the idea.  This episode is a solid one, setting up the first of several key elements for the final story arc.  (4 Wormholes)Episode 64, &quot;Into the Lion's Den, Part 1: Lambs to the Slaughter&quot; (Written by Richard Manning, Aired January 24, 2002) begins with one of those sights we never thought we would see: Crichton, Aeryn and Crais being welcomed aboard Scorpius' command carrier.  However, while Crichton and Scorpius begin working on wormholes, Moya's crew begins searching for a way to destroy the vessel if the effort to sabotage the program does not work.  Meanwhile, Crais and Aeryn meet up with some old friends.  (4 Wormholes)Episode 65, &quot;Into the Lion's Den, Part 2: Wolf in Sheep's Clothing&quot; (Written by Rockne S. O'Bannon, January 28, 2002) has Crichton's efforts going nowhere, making him decide the only thing left to do is to destroy Scorpius' command carrier.  The But Crais has been getting too familiar with some of the Peacekeepers and apparently has his own plans for Talyn.  Meanwhile, a new arrival tries to pull rank on Scorpius with regards to the wormhole project and the agreement with Moya's crew.  This forces Crichton to find a way to destroy the vessel right now.  A couple of major plot threads are resolved in this episode in quite an unexpected way, making this penultimate episode as important as the grand finale.  (5 Wormholes)Episode 66, &quot;Dog With Two Bones&quot; (Written by David Kemper, January 31, 2002) takes it title from Aesop's fable of the dog crossing a bridge with a bone in its mouth.  The main story line has to do with Moya visiting the final resting place of the Leviathans before the crew splits up and goes their separate ways.  Crichton is envisioning a future in which he takes Aeryn back to earth and they have a wedding, attended by all of his family and friends, from both Earth and Moya's crew.  The comic sight of D'Argo at the wedding reception contrasts with the parting of the crew and one of those jaw dropping discoveries that has you eager to find out what happens in Season 4 (5 Wormholes).Clearly the dominant thread of Season 3 was the relationship between Crichton and Aeryn, which went through several cycles of death and separation.  When you consider how many television series &quot;jump the shark&quot; once the male and female leads get together romantically, you have to be impressed with how &quot;Farscape&quot; finds a way of complicating the relationship between these two.  Even though we end up essentially at the end of the season where we were at the beginning with these two, you cannot accuse this show of having just tread water during Season 3, which was the best to that point.",5,The fantastic Season 3 of &quot;Farscape&quot; comes to a close,1068163200,"11 7, 2003",2003,3884,"['Season', '3', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'began', 'Aeryn', 'Sun', 'dead', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'Zhaan', 'who', 'then', 'proceeded', 'die', 'so', 'are', 'basically', 'able', 'end', 'up', 'season', 'right', 'where', 'started', 'traumatic', 'separation', 'Crichton', 'Aeryn', 'However', 'get', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'are', 'major', 'plot', 'lines', 'be', 'resolved', 'regarding', 'Scorpius', 'Crichton', 'plan', 'take', 'down', 'once', 'Episode', '63', 'quot', 'I-Yensch', 'You-Yensch', 'quot', 'Written', 'Matt', 'Ford', 'Aired', 'January', '21', '2002', 'Dargo', 'Rygel', 'actually', 'meeting', 'Scorpius', 'negotiate', 'immunity', 'Moya', 'crew', 'exchange', 'Crichton', 'aiding', 'Scorpius', 'wormhole', 'research', 'establish', 'good', 'faith', 'principle', 'parties', 'get', 'wear', 'I-Yensch', 'bracelets', 'make', 'feel', 'pain', 'other', 'person', 'hit', 'Crichton', 'head', 'Scorpius', 'will', 'reeling', 'episode', 'negotiators', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'Meanwhile', 'Talyn', 'who', 'become', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'fires', 'hospital', 'ship', '6,000', 'innocents', 'Crais', 'shutting', 'down', 'Talyn', 'basically', 'resetting', 'Talyn', 'Moya', 'are', 'receptive', 'idea', 'episode', 'solid', 'one', 'setting', 'up', 'first', 'several', 'key', 'elements', 'final', 'story', 'arc', '4', 'Wormholes', 'Episode', '64', 'quot', 'Into', 'Lion', 'Den', 'Part', '1', 'Lambs', 'Slaughter', 'quot', 'Written', 'Richard', 'Manning', 'Aired', 'January', '24', '2002', 'one', 'sights', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'see', 'Crichton', 'Aeryn', 'Crais', 'being', 'welcomed', 'Scorpius', 'command', 'carrier', 'However', 'Crichton', 'Scorpius', 'begin', 'working', 'wormholes', 'Moya', 'crew', 'searching', 'way', 'destroy', 'vessel', 'effort', 'sabotage', 'program', 'not', 'work', 'Meanwhile', 'Crais', 'Aeryn', 'meet', 'up', 'old', 'friends', '4', 'Wormholes', 'Episode', '65', 'quot', 'Into', 'Lion', 'Den', 'Part', '2', 'Wolf', 'Sheep', 'Clothing', 'quot', 'Written', 'Rockne', 'S.', ""O'Bannon"", 'January', '28', '2002', 'Crichton', 'efforts', 'going', 'nowhere', 'making', 'decide', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'do', 'destroy', 'Scorpius', 'command', 'carrier', 'Crais', 'been', 'getting', 'too', 'familiar', 'Peacekeepers', 'apparently', 'own', 'plans', 'Talyn', 'Meanwhile', 'new', 'arrival', 'tries', 'pull', 'rank', 'Scorpius', 'regards', 'wormhole', 'project', 'agreement', 'Moya', 'crew', 'Crichton', 'find', 'way', 'destroy', 'vessel', 'right', 'now', 'couple', 'major', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'resolved', 'episode', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'way', 'making', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'as', 'important', 'grand', 'finale', '5', 'Wormholes', 'Episode', '66', 'quot', 'Dog', 'Two', 'Bones', 'quot', 'Written', 'David', 'Kemper', 'January', '31', '2002', 'title', 'Aesop', 'fable', 'dog', 'crossing', 'bridge', 'bone', 'mouth', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'do', 'Moya', 'visiting', 'final', 'resting', 'place', 'Leviathans', 'crew', 'up', 'separate', 'ways', 'Crichton', 'envisioning', 'future', 'Aeryn', 'back', 'earth', 'have', 'wedding', 'attended', 'family', 'friends', 'Earth', 'Moya', 'crew', 'comic', 'sight', ""D'Argo"", 'wedding', 'reception', 'contrasts', 'parting', 'crew', 'one', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'discoveries', 'eager', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Season', '4', '5', 'Wormholes', '.Clearly', 'dominant', 'thread', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'relationship', 'Crichton', 'Aeryn', 'went', 'several', 'cycles', 'death', 'separation', 'When', 'consider', 'how', 'many', 'television', 'series', 'quot', 'shark', 'quot', 'once', 'male', 'female', 'leads', 'get', 'together', 'romantically', 'have', 'be', 'impressed', 'how', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'way', 'complicating', 'relationship', 'two', 'Even', 'end', 'up', 'essentially', 'end', 'season', 'where', 'were', 'beginning', 'two', 'can', 'not', 'accuse', 'show', 'having', 'just', 'tread', 'water', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'best', 'point']",N/A
