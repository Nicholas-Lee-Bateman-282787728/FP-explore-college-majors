Ishii could have used a trusted friend insisting that he cut his favorite parts.The story he is mostly charming, but suffers from too many subplots. In fact pretty much everything is a subplot because there are so many characters. As a result none of the pieces ever get fully developed. Without giving away the end, it's unfortunate that the resolution of one of these subplots winds up acting as a deus ex machina for all the others.Paradoxically, while the movie was overly long, the story of Haruno family would have made a great 13-part series.

I watch a lot of foreign film, especially Japanese.  This was a nice treat.  It is very quirky, but at it's core it is a story about a family that is odd, appears broken, but in a way they seem to make it work.  Each of the characters is likable and enjoyable in their own way.I wouldn't say this is up to the of level of Tokyo Sonata, Who's Camus Anyway, or Man Walking on Snow, but it's a nice film that has good acting and talented directing.

1070362,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000PE0H0E,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[10, 11]","In comparison to his rough and tumble indie-feeling gangster flick, Samehada Otoko to Momoji Onna, despite having little or no plot, Ishii Katsuhito's Ocha No Aji is a more serene offering, with humour that alternates between subtle, visual, and wacky, drama, and quirky visuals.  He introduces us to the Harunos, a family of five living in a nice house in the Tochigi Prefecture countryside.The parents seem normal enough, anime artist mother Yoshiko trying to make a comeback, while her husband Nobuo is a hypnotist.  The cute six-year old Sachiko is plagued by a giant double of herself that appears from time to time.  Sometimes it is seen as a head popping out of the ground;  other times, it gazes at her, lying on the playground looking in the classroom.  One wonders if it symbolizes her fears.The oldest child Hajime is a first year high school student who has a fear of women due to two incidents and the moving away of a classmate he wanted to confess his love to.However, he is given a new lease on hope with the appearance of Suzuishi Aoi, a transfer student from Tokyo.  His adolescent hormones are recharged, to the point that he bikes like a demon all the way back home instead of parking it near the train station like he normally does.  Though low-key and shy, Hajime's my favourite character.  It's simply heart-warming to see his joy when he finds a way to get closer to Aoi, by joining the go club, and when he waves at Aoi in the soaking rain--after swiftly tossing his umbrella before the bus door closes.To say the grandpa is eccentric is like saying Bill Gates is rich.  An old man with a funny face and a quiff of white hair standing up, he uses a tuning fork to make sure he is in tune, makes funny martial arts like poses as well as impromptu songs, and at one point, does a duet with Yoshiko's brother Ikki, an anime artist with a pudding bowl haircut, wearing cheesy Vegas style suits and singing a song titled ""Yamayo!""--""Oh Mountain,"" the song's only lyric.  Anything he does easily prompts a laugh.Veteran actor Asano Tadanobu plays Uncle Ayano, a sound mixer who has come to the countryside to relax, but also to come to some closure with an ex-girlfriend.  He tells his nephew and niece about his first outdoor sh^t in the forest as a kid, which somehow led to the ghost of a scary-looking yakuza to haunt him.  Upon hearing how Ayano's doing a backflip led to the vanishing of the ghost, Sachiko thinks maybe that's the way to get rid of her double.  There is a perfectly rational explanation for Ayano's story, which adds to the hilarity element.  More hilarious is his reaction to the ""Yamayo"" song.  The look on his disgusted face is like, ""My god, this is so effed up,"" and he later says of Grandpa and Ikki, ""They look like perverted aliens from another planet.""The appearance of Sachiko's double, the train coming out of Hajime's forehead, and two otakus who ride the train wearing ridiculously bulky costumes are just a few visual wonders in this film.  If Suzuishi Aoi is familiar, that's because it's Anna Tsuchiya, who played the biker Ichigo in Shimotsuma Story--a.k.a. the inappropriately titled Kamikaze Girls.  She's quieter in this film, with more of a natural beauty.  Supporting roles include Anno Hideaki, best known for directing the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime.Trivia:  the station where Hajime and his father get off is Terauchi Station on the Moka Line.  That is five stops from where I live!  The place where Ishii shot his movie is Motegi City, whose station is the terminus of the Moka Line.  Yet the train used is not the Moka train, but something specially designed for the movie.  And the narrator of the film also has a role, as Mr. Haruno's patient at his clinic, and she's quite funny.Maybe the rich refreshing flavour of green tea one savours is why this odd but pleasant film is titled such, because it sure refreshed me!",5,Tastes....refreshing!,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,3892,"['comparison', 'rough', 'tumble', 'indie-feeling', 'gangster', 'flick', 'Samehada', 'Otoko', 'Momoji', 'Onna', 'having', 'little', 'plot', 'Ishii', 'Katsuhito', 'Ocha', 'No', 'Aji', 'more', 'serene', 'offering', 'humour', 'subtle', 'visual', 'wacky', 'drama', 'quirky', 'visuals', 'Harunos', 'family', 'five', 'living', 'nice', 'house', 'Tochigi', 'Prefecture', 'parents', 'seem', 'normal', 'enough', 'anime', 'artist', 'mother', 'Yoshiko', 'trying', 'make', 'comeback', 'husband', 'Nobuo', 'hypnotist', 'cute', 'six-year', 'old', 'Sachiko', 'plagued', 'giant', 'double', 'herself', 'time', 'time', 'Sometimes', 'seen', 'head', 'popping', 'ground', 'other', 'times', 'lying', 'playground', 'looking', 'classroom', 'One', 'fears.The', 'oldest', 'child', 'Hajime', 'first', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'fear', 'women', 'due', 'two', 'incidents', 'moving', 'away', 'classmate', 'wanted', 'confess', 'love', 'to.However', 'given', 'new', 'lease', 'hope', 'appearance', 'Suzuishi', 'Aoi', 'transfer', 'student', 'Tokyo', 'adolescent', 'hormones', 'are', 'recharged', 'point', 'demon', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'instead', 'parking', 'train', 'station', 'normally', 'low-key', 'shy', 'Hajime', 'favourite', 'character', 'simply', 'heart-warming', 'see', 'joy', 'when', 'way', 'get', 'closer', 'Aoi', 'joining', 'go', 'club', 'when', 'Aoi', 'soaking', 'rain', 'swiftly', 'tossing', 'umbrella', 'bus', 'door', 'closes.To', 'say', 'grandpa', 'eccentric', 'saying', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'rich', 'old', 'man', 'funny', 'face', 'quiff', 'white', 'hair', 'standing', 'up', 'tuning', 'fork', 'make', 'sure', 'tune', 'funny', 'martial', 'arts', 'like', 'poses', 'as', 'well', 'impromptu', 'songs', 'one', 'point', 'duet', 'Yoshiko', 'brother', 'Ikki', 'anime', 'artist', 'pudding', 'bowl', 'haircut', 'wearing', 'cheesy', 'Vegas', 'style', 'suits', 'singing', 'song', 'titled', 'Yamayo', 'Oh', 'Mountain', 'song', 'only', 'lyric', 'Anything', 'easily', 'prompts', 'laugh.Veteran', 'actor', 'Asano', 'Tadanobu', 'Uncle', 'Ayano', 'sound', 'mixer', 'who', 'come', 'countryside', 'relax', 'also', 'come', 'closure', 'ex-girlfriend', 'nephew', 'niece', 'first', 'outdoor', 'sh^t', 'forest', 'kid', 'somehow', 'led', 'ghost', 'scary-looking', 'yakuza', 'haunt', 'hearing', 'how', 'Ayano', 'doing', 'backflip', 'led', 'vanishing', 'ghost', 'Sachiko', 'maybe', 'way', 'get', 'rid', 'double', 'perfectly', 'rational', 'explanation', 'Ayano', 'story', 'hilarity', 'element', 'More', 'hilarious', 'reaction', 'Yamayo', 'song', 'look', 'disgusted', 'face', 'god', 'so', 'effed', 'up', 'later', 'Grandpa', 'Ikki', 'look', 'perverted', 'aliens', 'planet', 'appearance', 'Sachiko', 'double', 'train', 'coming', 'Hajime', 'forehead', 'two', 'otakus', 'who', 'ride', 'train', 'wearing', 'ridiculously', 'bulky', 'costumes', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'visual', 'wonders', 'film', 'Suzuishi', 'Aoi', 'familiar', 'Anna', 'Tsuchiya', 'who', 'played', 'biker', 'Ichigo', 'Shimotsuma', 'Story', 'a.k.a', 'inappropriately', 'titled', 'Kamikaze', 'Girls', 'quieter', 'film', 'more', 'natural', 'beauty', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'include', 'Anno', 'Hideaki', 'best', 'known', 'directing', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'anime.Trivia', 'station', 'where', 'Hajime', 'father', 'get', 'off', 'Terauchi', 'Station', 'Moka', 'Line', 'five', 'stops', 'where', 'live', 'place', 'where', 'Ishii', 'shot', 'movie', 'Motegi', 'City', 'station', 'terminus', 'Moka', 'Line', 'train', 'used', 'not', 'Moka', 'train', 'something', 'specially', 'designed', 'movie', 'narrator', 'film', 'also', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Haruno', 'patient', 'clinic', 'quite', 'funny.Maybe', 'rich', 'refreshing', 'flavour', 'green', 'tea', 'one', 'savours', 'why', 'odd', 'pleasant', 'film', 'titled', 'such', 'sure', 'refreshed']",The Taste of Tea

But for a person, like myself, who has lived many years in Japan and reveres what is unique, transcendent and life-changing about this amazing country, this film is not only nothing like Japan, but it is an all out slur against it's natives and culture.  Nothing in this film resembles the real Japanese life or the true overall spirit of the Nihonjin people.  Please, if you want a Japanese movie that captures their best and their Oriental spirituality, look rather to ""Cherry Blossoms"" or the recent ""Departures"" (English version of the title).

I went in with zero expectation, how I think all movies should be viewed but of course that is not realistic, and was absorbed and delighted by it the entire time.I feel not the need to tell you about the plot because if you're interested in the movie you've probably already read up on it, but just know that each actor plays their part brilliantly and with charm (with special props to Tatsuya Gashuin and Maya Banno who played the grandfather and daughter, respectively). I've heard some plot complaints coming from other reviewers and while the movie is a tad waiver-y the subplots and personal missions of each of the five family members are enthralling and not only tie together in the end but left me feeling enlightened. At the risk of being dramatic, I even found the movie inspiring.The setting of the movie is absolutely beautiful; in a quaint, rural community all of the cinematography is admirable and adds to the rustic simplicity which the movie contains. Many scenes reminded me of the animated movie ""My Neighbour Totoro"" and being a fan of that movie made ""The Taste of Tea"" feel even more special.The film has a definite originality to it and I doubt there is anything else quite like it around. Each character is quirky but none to the point of irritability or where they feel like caricatures. I was in fact charmed with the entire family.The movie has a few sad moments but overall is not to be taken seriously. There are many funny scenes, one in which I actually burst out laughing, and the actions and mannerisms of the family members kept the movie consistently fresh. Some of the things that happen are absurd so I think it is important to remember to not take things too seriously.The movie is an extremely endearing, poignant case study on a rural Japanese family, packed with humor, drama, quests to better one's self and above all an eccentric gusto which carries the movie throughout.

Family consists of artists, visual and musical and the head of the family happens to be a hypnotist who enhances their imagination with unexected hypnotic sessions.  Each family member is going thru significant changes in life.  Mom, who is animator is trying to get back into workforce, young boy is coming of age is hopelessly falling in love with very pretty newcomer girl into his class, young girl is lethargic in her attempt to rid of her giant imaginary ghost who seems to be following her everywhere.  Their uncle, a sound mixer, is having difficult time of letting go of the girl who has married someone else.  As they all go thru their days, the grandfather, seemingly senile is singing along, playing hide an seek with his granddaughter and preparing his new musical score for his nephew's birthday.  We see beauty of nature all around them: rice fields, butterflies, wild flowers, greenery of trees in the the mountains.  And then one day, as gradfather dies, in his room his family finds animation books about each family member.  It is amazing to learn that the way the old man saw them is the way they saw themselves during critical moments in their lives.  Beautiful film about little moments in life that make family members feel close to each other and make us all appreciate life in all its beauty.  This is film for sophisticated and mature viewers.

1070371,A11BZ39QSLERNI,B000PE0H0E,T-Rexx,"[4, 4]","The taste of tea (AKA Cha no aji) is a Japanese movie which, during the first five minutes of watching it, provides a feeling of uncertainty. What am I watching? Is that funny? Is that just plain bad? And then the magic operates, largely due to the beauty of the scenery, the credibility of each and every actor, the soothing effect of the slow rhythm of the whole ""action"". Then, enjoyment, pleasure and even laughs succeed the initial feeling of uncertainty as the plot starts making sense and the characters each get to expose their personality more plainly.The story is simple at first. It's about a Japanese family of 4+2: the overactive and somewhat distant parents, the young and very lonely daughter, the immature and shy teen boy, the deranged grandfather and the lazy -yet creative- lost uncle.What the viewer realizes after a while is that, although all of the characters physically live together in their daily life, they each follow their own path, share little together and hardly know each other at all. After a while though, they start sharing something in common through the least expected, weirdest character of them all and get to open up to each other in a beautiful, blossoming fashion.Action seekers, don't stop here.

1070372,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000PE0H0E,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[8, 8]","A movie about ""Nothing""---but there is something. THE TASTE OF TEA is the handiwork of Katsushito Ishii, the director of the acclaimed cult hit ""Party 7"" and ""Funky Forest: First Contact"". Now, I'll go straight to the point, this film is about family, anime, a boy's young love, a young girl's journey through childhood, with very simple execution. If you're looking for a movie with a steadfast destination, then this movie may not be for you or if you want to use puns, not your cup of tea. However, this film is a grand display of Ishii's directorial skills, the man just knows how to tell a story and gets everything right.A summer in the lives of the quirky Haruno clan, who passes the unhurried days trying to realize their ambitions. In a small town just North of Tokyo, a dedicated mother (Satomi Tezuka) attempts to revive her anime career with the aid of Grandpa who assumes the poses, her hypno-therapist hubby (Tomokazu Miura) has no choice but to back her decision and supports the family financially. Meanwhile, their eldest son (Takahiro Sato) feels the allure of teenage love and their 6 yr.-old daughter (Maya Banno) grapples with a pesky, gigantic doppelganger. Brother Asano (Tadanobu Asano) wants to be a successful sound mixer.Remember the show ""Seinfeld"" that pronounces itself as a show about ""nothing"", well, Ishii has taken that phrase to the next level. The film's beauty is the manner on which it is structured with  body languages, facial expressions and mumblings as its main vehicle in expressing its ideas. While its main premise is simple, it has the uncanny ability to say a lot without even saying a word. From the young girl who plays peek-a-boo with Grandpa, to the times when the teenager plays ""Go"" with his father and Uncle while the mother discusses posture and cool stances for her anime feature. A lot of it are ""little things"", sequences of everyday family matters but the film expresses a lot through its whimsical and episodic style. The word ""Mosaic"" is truly fitting for this film, since it is truly composed of diverse elements and formulas.There's a Yakuza ghost with feces on his head whose tale is told by the boy's uncle, the giant egg, the goal of the ""perfect"" back flip, all these factors contribute to the family's amazing chemistry through interaction. The characters are so interesting and their characteristics mesh so well that if you take away one, the other characters would have to react differently. This is truly a great sign of excellent storytelling, when the characters take a life of their own and the plot (or lack of) can really breath. The family has become one breathing entity because of its direction.The film is not a drama; nothing really major happens but it promotes an emotional reaction. It is not a comedy, yet, I found myself laughing quite a lot from its sequences. The film is not really telling a tale but it is more about memoirs, reflections and the clan's everyday routine. It's a bit long at 2 hours and 17 minutes, but with its eccentric characters and meandering storyline, the film will envelope you with its charm and its bright whimsical humor will undoubtedly put a smile on your face and will keep you locked in for its entirety. Even with its slower-paced moments, Ishii will draw you in with its warmth and joyful emulation will never bore you.""The Taste of Tea"" is rightfully named. Sometimes bizarre and odd, whimsical and episodic, with subtleties about life's meaning. To some Tea tastes flat and just tastes like flavored water, to some its variety of flavors add a lot of satisfaction to our taste buds. Tea can also be sometimes sweet and at the same time bitter. The film's execution has plenty of capacity for humor, and its humor is universal and won't get lost in its translation. ""The Taste of Tea"" is about Life's fulfillment, that lies in the pursuit of individual goals and these goals need not be huge or life-changing to provide a feeling of joy. Happiness is in the little things and appreciation for things we usually ignore is what true fulfillment is really about.[...]",4,"A Movie about ""Nothing""...But There's Something!",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,4089,"['movie', 'Nothing', '-but', 'something', 'TASTE', 'OF', 'TEA', 'handiwork', 'Katsushito', 'Ishii', 'director', 'acclaimed', 'cult', 'hit', 'Party', '7', 'Funky', 'Forest', 'First', 'Contact', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'go', 'straight', 'point', 'film', 'family', 'anime', 'boy', 'young', 'love', 'young', 'girl', 'journey', 'childhood', 'very', 'simple', 'execution', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'steadfast', 'destination', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'want', 'use', 'puns', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'However', 'film', 'grand', 'display', 'Ishii', 'directorial', 'skills', 'man', 'just', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'everything', 'right.A', 'summer', 'lives', 'quirky', 'Haruno', 'clan', 'who', 'unhurried', 'days', 'trying', 'realize', 'ambitions', 'small', 'town', 'just', 'North', 'Tokyo', 'dedicated', 'mother', 'Satomi', 'Tezuka', 'revive', 'anime', 'career', 'aid', 'Grandpa', 'who', 'poses', 'hypno-therapist', 'hubby', 'Tomokazu', 'Miura', 'choice', 'back', 'decision', 'family', 'financially', 'Meanwhile', 'eldest', 'son', 'Takahiro', 'Sato', 'allure', 'teenage', 'love', '6', 'yr.-old', 'daughter', 'Maya', 'Banno', 'pesky', 'gigantic', 'doppelganger', 'Brother', 'Asano', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'be', 'successful', 'sound', 'mixer.Remember', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'show', 'nothing', 'well', 'Ishii', 'taken', 'phrase', 'next', 'level', 'film', 'beauty', 'manner', 'structured', 'body', 'languages', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mumblings', 'main', 'vehicle', 'expressing', 'ideas', 'main', 'premise', 'simple', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'say', 'lot', 'even', 'saying', 'word', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'peek-a-boo', 'Grandpa', 'times', 'when', 'teenager', 'Go', 'father', 'Uncle', 'mother', 'posture', 'cool', 'stances', 'anime', 'feature', 'lot', 'are', 'little', 'things', 'sequences', 'everyday', 'family', 'matters', 'film', 'lot', 'whimsical', 'episodic', 'style', 'word', 'Mosaic', 'truly', 'fitting', 'film', 'truly', 'composed', 'diverse', 'elements', 'Yakuza', 'ghost', 'feces', 'head', 'tale', 'told', 'boy', 'uncle', 'giant', 'egg', 'goal', 'perfect', 'back', 'flip', 'factors', 'contribute', 'family', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'interaction', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'interesting', 'characteristics', 'mesh', 'so', 'well', 'take', 'away', 'one', 'other', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'react', 'differently', 'truly', 'great', 'sign', 'excellent', 'storytelling', 'when', 'characters', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'plot', 'lack', 'can', 'really', 'breath', 'family', 'become', 'one', 'breathing', 'entity', 'direction.The', 'film', 'not', 'drama', 'nothing', 'really', 'major', 'happens', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'not', 'comedy', 'yet', 'found', 'laughing', 'quite', 'lot', 'sequences', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'telling', 'tale', 'more', 'memoirs', 'reflections', 'clan', 'everyday', 'routine', 'bit', 'long', '2', 'hours', '17', 'minutes', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'meandering', 'storyline', 'film', 'will', 'envelope', 'charm', 'bright', 'whimsical', 'humor', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'will', 'keep', 'locked', 'entirety', 'Even', 'slower-paced', 'moments', 'Ishii', 'will', 'draw', 'warmth', 'joyful', 'emulation', 'will', 'never', 'bore', 'Taste', 'Tea', 'rightfully', 'named', 'Sometimes', 'bizarre', 'odd', 'whimsical', 'episodic', 'subtleties', 'life', 'meaning', 'Tea', 'tastes', 'flat', 'just', 'tastes', 'flavored', 'water', 'variety', 'flavors', 'add', 'lot', 'satisfaction', 'taste', 'buds', 'Tea', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'sometimes', 'sweet', 'same', 'time', 'bitter', 'film', 'execution', 'plenty', 'capacity', 'humor', 'humor', 'universal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'lost', 'translation', 'Taste', 'Tea', 'Life', 'fulfillment', 'pursuit', 'individual', 'goals', 'goals', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'huge', 'life-changing', 'provide', 'feeling', 'joy', 'Happiness', 'little', 'things', 'appreciation', 'things', 'usually', 'ignore', 'what', 'true', 'fulfillment', 'really', 'about.', '[', ']']",The Taste of Tea
1070373,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000PE0H0E,Zack Davisson,"[5, 5]","It is hard to put a finger on what exactly is so great about ""The Taste of Tea"" (""Cha no Aji""). There is no real story to speak of, the movie drifts from one bizarre instance to another, and becomes just a hodge-podge of small vignettes vaguely connected by a circumstance of family.  A bit like real life, I suppose, but without the bleeding ghosts and giant girls.What ever it is, ""The Taste of Tea"" is a great flick.  Director Ishii Katsuhito (Party 7) has put together a modern version of an Ozu film, focusing on tiny family dramas that anyone could encounter and making them the focus.  No grand drama, no heroes and villains, just life.  Everything focuses around the Haruno family, with each member having a story to tell.  Effects are used to create the surreal atmosphere, but never overpower the story.  An American equivalent would beBig Fish, which also combines the nostalgic with the surreal.The ensemble cast is pure quality, each of them stars of the Japanese film industry.  Asano Tadanobu (Kakihara fromIchi the Killer) plays a younger brother who needs time with his family to recuperate from lost love. Tezuka Satomi (Isola) plays the mother, a woman who has given up her career as an animator to raise her family, but wants to break back in now that her children are older.  Gashuin Tatsuya (Spirited Away) is amazing as the unhinged grandfather, a man with an artist's soul and the innocence of a child.  Anno Hideaki, creator ofNeon Genesis Evangelion, even pops in for a cameo role.The scenery of rural Japan is also beautifully filmed, and is enough to make you nostalgic for it even if you have never been there.  All the sites and sounds are perfect, with vivid colors crisp and alive.  I have spent some time in rural Japan, and ""The Taste of Tea"" made me want to chuck my job, pack a suitcase, and head back to the mountains and rice fields and just soak up the lifestyle.This limited edition of the DVD is worth getting picking up over the regular one if you can.
