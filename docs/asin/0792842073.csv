147492,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,0792842073,Adi Adler,"[0, 0]","This is a good movie, based on a true story of a nun who helpes a guy on death row, giving him all the support she can - whether it's legal or moral - until he is executed. Even though Helen Prejean's original book is against capital punishment, this movie tries to show all sides of an execution. There are the obvioius ones: the murderer, the families of the victims and the suffering of the victims themselves. But we also get to see some other sides: the reactions of the people working in the jail such as the jailers and the jail's minister, and what the family of the murderer is going through.There are 2 major faults in this movie: one is that even though the movie is trying to be objective but it is obviously against the capital punishment, like the novel it is based on. The second fault is that we get only very vague impressions about Helen's life - they are too vague, and not only do they not contribute to the movie, they only left me with more confused than before.But a great cast, and a good commentary by Tim Robbins make up for these faluts.",4,A Very Good movie...,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,1064,"['good', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'nun', 'who', 'guy', 'death', 'row', 'giving', 'support', 'can', 'legal', 'moral', 'executed', 'Even', 'Helen', 'Prejean', 'original', 'book', 'capital', 'punishment', 'movie', 'show', 'sides', 'execution', 'are', 'obvioius', 'ones', 'murderer', 'families', 'victims', 'suffering', 'victims', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'other', 'sides', 'reactions', 'people', 'working', 'jail', 'such', 'jailers', 'jail', 'minister', 'what', 'family', 'murderer', 'going', 'are', '2', 'major', 'faults', 'movie', 'one', 'even', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'objective', 'obviously', 'capital', 'punishment', 'novel', 'based', 'second', 'fault', 'get', 'only', 'very', 'vague', 'impressions', 'Helen', 'life', 'are', 'too', 'vague', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'contribute', 'movie', 'only', 'left', 'more', 'confused', 'before.But', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'commentary', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'make', 'up', 'faluts']",N/A

However, Sean Penn's portrayal of Matthew Poncelet absolutely blew me away.  I was also impressed at the level of impartiality that they were able to attain in presenting the story.  Ultimately, the story is presented from the perspective of an abolitionist, Catholic nun; naturally, there will be an underlying anti-death penalty sentiment.  However, as the director, Tim Robbins was phenomenal at presenting the storylines of the victims' families.  In fact, battling between her beliefs and seeing the pain that innocent people have endured is a serious conflict that Sister Helen deals with throughout the entire movie.To me, the beauty in this story isn't the friendship that forms between Sister Helen and a death row inmate -- it's the last minute humanity that we see from Matthew which comes from a stubborn nun who refuses to give up on him.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I have read the book and found it be exceedingly better.

147497,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792842073,Andrew Ellington,"[14, 15]","This movie wrecked me.Seriously, it tore out my heart and stomped on it.  `Dead Man Walking' is one of those movies that ravages an individual because it leaves bias at the door and forces you to witness two sides of a devastating story.  I feel about this film as I do about `4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days' for both films take a situation that one would have a firm opinion about and causes you to seriously doubt yourself.  With `4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days' it was abortion, and while I am wholeheartedly against the act it forced me to understand why some would be for it, and it brought me a to a dark and lonely place I never want to revisit.  `Dead Man Walking' is very similar but maybe even with a more savage result.  This film takes on the subject of the death penalty and asks us to contemplate whether or not it is humane.  Instead of forcing us a preordained answer, `Dead Man Walking' allows the audience to see both sides of the situation and decide for themselves what they think is just and fair.`Dead Man Walking' took everything I believed in and destroyed it.When `4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days' was through I was weak emotionally, but I still stood firm to my beliefs on the subject.  When I was through with `Dead Man Walking' I had no idea what I believed anymore because I found myself trying to justify each stance on the matter.  I still am trying to grapple with my feelings.`Dead Man Walking' (a slang term used in reference to a death row inmate in route to the death chamber) focuses on Matthew Poncelet, a convicted murderer trying to get his death sentenced exchanged for a life sentence.  He writes to Sister Helen Prejean for her help in the process, and when his appeal is denied he asks her to be his spiritual adviser during the week leading up to his execution.  She agrees, despite the pressure she has from the community and the victims families to separate herself from this man.  The film takes us into the relationship between these two people and slowly and subtly lets us inside their minds.  Matthew swears he was nothing more than a witness to the horrific events that placed him on death row yet Sister Prejean is trying to help him take responsibility for his actions so as to gain Christ's forgiveness.What could have proved itself nothing more than a sappy preachy film about inhumane/humane (depending on your stance) acts of justice becomes so much more thanks to the brilliant performances by the entire cast, the two leads in particular.  Susan Sarandon is one of our greatest working actresses, and she always succeeds in impressing me, but this is probably her finest performance (and Oscar agreed).  Not only that, but this may very well be one of the finest performances by any actress, ever.  As Sister Helen Prejean she truly grabs hold of this woman's soul, her inner demons and her beauty within.  She is so raw, so human and real that one can't help but fall into her plight and stand beside her strength.  Her final scenes with Penn devastate me and caused me to burst into tears.  Those scenes were of course only strengthened by the power that is Sean Penn.  As Matthew Poncelet, Penn creates a monster that is so real and so human that we can't help by sympathize with him.  It was about half way through the film that it hit me, what Penn was successfully doing.  He was creating a man that I could understand.  We think about the act and the crime and the horror behind it all and we are quick to hate and cry out for justice, but quite like `A Clockwork Orange', `Dead Man Walking' asks the question if we have the right, as humans, to decide just what that justice should entail.The final moments of `Dead Man Walking' hit me like a freight train.  Coupling the heartbreaking final moments of Poncelet's life with flashbacks of his horrendous crime leaves the viewer in distress and torn between two wide ranges of thinking.  This was probably the smartest direction Tim Robbins could have gone for it accomplishes what he set out to do, create a film without bias that addresses both side of the coin.  Sure, the harrowing performances by R. Lee Ermey, Celia Weston and Robert Prosky as the parents of Poncelet's victims help give us a perspective into their feelings on the matter, but it is the ending that really twists the knife.  By feeding us the initial crime and the inevitable justice at the same time we are flooded with emotions as we cringe at the sight of Poncelet taking innocent lives in such a brutal fashion and then shiver in misery as we watch his life taken from him in what is considered a `humane' fashion.  The ending result is one of pain and emotional exhaustion.I cannot say that I would not want this same form of justice done if anyone hurt my daughter.  Most likely I would be campaigning for a more drastic and harsh form of torment to be done that individual.  I think that is why this film haunts me so much, because I am a father.  As I watch this movie and begin to sympathize with this man I feel guilty because I would never want someone to sympathize with a man that hurt my own daughter.  Having said that I wholeheartedly agree with Penn's final devastating words, that killing is wrong no matter who is doing it.  This rift in my own feelings may very well be the reason I consider this to be one of the finest films ever made, for it addresses those same contradictions with intelligence and honesty.",5,"Honest,

Many arguments and counterarguments later an average person still forms his impression based upon some or the other personal experience. Someone who has no strong religious belief or who has not suffered -directly or indirectly- from any criminal act would arguably find herself in a dilemma as to which side to take.`Dead Man Walking' gives the audience an unbiased insight into the social issue of capital punishment. A subtly crafted script, brilliant performances by Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon and a delicate portrayal of events that lead to the execution of Sean Penn - for a brutal double crime of raping and killing - and most compellingly, the act of execution itself - gives the audience a first-hand exposure to the trauma experienced by those involved.It is indeed a very fine line. To kill or not to kill - that is the question. Why and who kills - is not the echoing thought you are left with. Instead you are haunted by the question - is it right to end a life regardless of who, when, why, how? Sean Penn's last words suggest otherwise. He has lived in a state of denial while not confessing, and probably in his self-delusion convincing himself that he too was a victim of a bigger act of serendipity. Eventually, he breaks down in an uneventful moment and accepts his crime before Susan Sarandon - the nun who has done everything she could to give him a fair chance. He subsequently apologizes to the parents of the victims just before his execution. In an enthralling climatic episode, the scenes of the brutal and shameless crime are brilliantly juxtaposed to the sophisticated act of execution. The breathtaking cathartic moments of this episode leave the audience with the big question - is taking a life right? Regardless of who does it.A must watch movie that leaves us with an issue to ponder over.",5,Capital issue,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,1936,"['Countries', 'people', 'ideologies', 'world', 'have', 'forever', 'debated', 'justifiability', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Many', 'arguments', 'counterarguments', 'later', 'average', 'person', 'still', 'impression', 'based', 'other', 'personal', 'experience', 'Someone', 'who', 'strong', 'religious', 'belief', 'who', 'not', 'suffered', '-directly', 'indirectly-', 'criminal', 'act', 'would', 'arguably', 'find', 'dilemma', 'side', 'take.', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'audience', 'unbiased', 'insight', 'social', 'issue', 'capital', 'punishment', 'subtly', 'crafted', 'script', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'delicate', 'portrayal', 'events', 'lead', 'execution', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'brutal', 'double', 'crime', 'raping', 'killing', 'most', 'compellingly', 'act', 'execution', 'audience', 'first-hand', 'exposure', 'trauma', 'experienced', 'involved.It', 'indeed', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'kill', 'not', 'kill', 'question', 'Why', 'who', 'kills', 'not', 'echoing', 'thought', 'are', 'left', 'Instead', 'are', 'haunted', 'question', 'right', 'end', 'life', 'regardless', 'who', 'when', 'why', 'how', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'last', 'words', 'suggest', 'otherwise', 'lived', 'state', 'denial', 'not', 'confessing', 'probably', 'self-delusion', 'convincing', 'too', 'was', 'victim', 'bigger', 'act', 'serendipity', 'Eventually', 'down', 'uneventful', 'moment', 'accepts', 'crime', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'nun', 'who', 'done', 'everything', 'could', 'give', 'fair', 'chance', 'subsequently', 'parents', 'victims', 'just', 'execution', 'enthralling', 'climatic', 'episode', 'scenes', 'brutal', 'shameless', 'crime', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'juxtaposed', 'sophisticated', 'act', 'execution', 'breathtaking', 'cathartic', 'moments', 'episode', 'leave', 'audience', 'big', 'question', 'taking', 'life', 'right', 'Regardless', 'who', 'it.A', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'issue', 'ponder', 'over']",N/A
147499,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792842073,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 3/04, 5/14Rate: 65/14: To keep it in perspective, if Dead Man Walking featured a trashy-looking death row inmate, with bad skin and hair, ready to be executed and is asking for sympathy even though he has committed heinous acts, would the film be watchable? No. We just don't care and want him to be dead. The sooner, the better. That's the problem I have with the film because of Sean Penn's appeal. Of course, it takes him, his Elvis hair, his colorful fake tattoos, and his icy blue eyes to draw in the viewers and make them think that it is a fascinating film about a cool looking guy. That's the allure of a Hollywood produced picture. But I didn't care for his character at all. I think the religion stuff (clearly, a heavy buffer) was getting in the way too much for me to feel strongly in either way. Anyway, I consider Dead Man Walking to be the best work that Susan Sarandon, an overrated actress, has ever done in her career. She displays a perfect set of emotions for her character, and she does very well at key moments. My favorite scene, although a red herring, is the one when she gets stopped by the cop for speeding. One winning feature of Dead Man Walking is the walkthrough of the actual death penalty phase which can be thought of as Execution 101 for most viewers. Where Dead Man Walking fails the most is that it doesn't accomplish all that much but maybe to drum up some worthless support against the death penalty (and why?). The conversations between the nun and Sean Penn, another overrated actor, are hollow and have no substance whatsoever. Ditto for hers with the victims' families which are also typical and predictable. One thing that is strikingly peculiar about any murder is that the murderer gets more attention for the nature of the crimes committed but so little of the victims' lives. And that's what happened in the film.

Writer-director Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays. Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture. The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film. Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.  Of course, no film is 100% unbiased, especially when it comes to such serious issues as these, but I liked it. Features one of the most chilling and realistic scenes of an execution ever to be captured on celluloid. Based on the book by Helen Prejean (the real-life nun, who appears briefly outside the prison during a candlelight vigil scene).",4,Well done,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,1038,"['Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'deals', 'one', 'nun', 'struggle', 'help', 'convicted', 'death', 'row', 'inmate', 'come', 'terms', 'imminent', 'execution', 'Writer-director', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'something', 'very', 'difficult', 'film', 'care', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'Penn', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'dominate', 'film', 'aspect', 'imaginable', 'play', 'complicated', 'chess', 'match', 'times', 'eventually', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'end', 'picture', 'fact', 'Sarandon', 'Robbins', 'are', 'openly', 'death', 'penalty', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'film', 'strong', 'opinion', 'subject', 'unforgettable', 'motion', 'picture', 'made', 'well', 'performed', 'well', 'two', 'leads', 'course', 'film', '100', '%', 'unbiased', 'especially', 'when', 'such', 'serious', 'issues', 'liked', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'execution', 'ever', 'be', 'captured', 'celluloid', 'Based', 'book', 'Helen', 'Prejean', 'real-life', 'nun', 'who', 'briefly', 'prison', 'candlelight', 'vigil', 'scene']",N/A

But the story is so incredibly depressing that I simply cannot give it more than three stars. If anyone can see this film and continue to support the death penalty, I don't want to know about it.Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarondon) got a letter from a prisoner on death row, Matthew Porcelet (Sean Penn). She answered, and he asked her to come visit him. His family never came to visit him. So she did. He asked her to try to get him a lawyer, so she did.Understand, this was not an innocence project. He and another man raped and murdered a young woman and murdered her boyfriend, leaving their bodies in the woods to be found a week later. But the older man got a life sentence, while Matthew got a death sentence. It was honestly speculated that the older man had more money, or his family did, and could hire a better lawyer. As Matthew himself pointed out, there are no rich men on death row.So Sister Helen embarks on a project to try to get him an appeal, a pardon from the governor, something. She goes to visit his family and those of both the victims. All I have to say on the matter is make sure you have a full box of tissues before you start this one.One reason I got depressed with this movie is that Helen is, after all, a nun. After Matthew asks her to formally be assigned as his spiritual advisor, the chaplain (a stuffed shirt) advises her that it is her responsibility to try to get him to confess his sins and seek forgiveness. So some of the most emotional scenes are about religion.I used to be a supporter of the death penalty myself, but I have changed my mind. I used to feel the death penalty was actually less cruel than keeping a person locked up in prison literally all his life. Now my idea is we should give the worst criminals life without possibility of parole and an option for suicide. If in fact death is less cruel, then let them choose that for themselves. Give them a capsule and let them decide when and whether to take it.",3,"It Will Make You Think, and Probably Make You Cry",1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2039,"['generally', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'one', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'so', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'anyone', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'continue', 'support', 'death', 'penalty', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'it.Sister', 'Helen', 'Prejean', 'Susan', 'Sarondon', 'got', 'letter', 'prisoner', 'death', 'row', 'Matthew', 'Porcelet', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'answered', 'asked', 'come', 'visit', 'family', 'never', 'came', 'visit', 'did', 'asked', 'try', 'get', 'lawyer', 'did.Understand', 'was', 'not', 'innocence', 'project', 'man', 'raped', 'murdered', 'young', 'woman', 'murdered', 'boyfriend', 'leaving', 'bodies', 'woods', 'be', 'found', 'week', 'later', 'older', 'man', 'got', 'life', 'sentence', 'Matthew', 'got', 'death', 'sentence', 'was', 'honestly', 'speculated', 'older', 'man', 'had', 'more', 'money', 'family', 'did', 'could', 'hire', 'better', 'lawyer', 'Matthew', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'rich', 'men', 'death', 'row.So', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'project', 'try', 'get', 'appeal', 'pardon', 'governor', 'something', 'visit', 'family', 'victims', 'have', 'say', 'matter', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'full', 'box', 'tissues', 'start', 'one.One', 'reason', 'got', 'depressed', 'movie', 'Helen', 'nun', 'Matthew', 'formally', 'be', 'assigned', 'spiritual', 'advisor', 'chaplain', 'stuffed', 'shirt', 'responsibility', 'try', 'get', 'confess', 'sins', 'seek', 'forgiveness', 'most', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'are', 'religion.I', 'used', 'be', 'supporter', 'death', 'penalty', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'used', 'feel', 'death', 'penalty', 'was', 'actually', 'less', 'cruel', 'keeping', 'person', 'locked', 'up', 'prison', 'literally', 'life', 'Now', 'idea', 'should', 'give', 'worst', 'criminals', 'life', 'possibility', 'parole', 'option', 'suicide', 'fact', 'death', 'less', 'cruel', 'then', 'let', 'choose', 'Give', 'capsule', 'let', 'decide', 'when', 'take']",N/A

If you were pro death penalty (as I staunchly am) before viewing this movie, you'll probably remain that way.  And vice versa.Under the tender guidance of director Tim Robbins, the cast and crew bring this emotionally charged story to life.  Far from being biased or bigoted, it is refreshing in its neutrality.  Views from each sides of this topic are presented and discussed deeply.  Remittingly unsentimental, it is a truly graphic and gut wrenching illustration of suffering and sickening waste of life, for there are no real winners in this story.  There are only losers.  How horrendously and horrifically sad that stark fact is.Susan Sarandon won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in this film, and no wonder; she breathes vulnerability and compassion into a character who so easily could have been depicted as a pious bible basher.  She literally BECOMES Sister Helen Prejean, and one tends to forget that she is merely an actress playing a role.  That is how realistically convincing she is.  But Sean Penn, (seemingly in his element as a bad boy) as Matthew Poncelet, initially simply reeks of evil and barbarity, and such is his talent as an actor that he manages to imbibe into this seemingly unredeemable specimen an air of humanity and sympathy.  He dominates every scene in which he appears, and he deserves five stars, kudos, plaudits, and then some for this performance.  He too, BECOMES his character, and his performance as the creepy Poncelet is the most chilling and evocative portrayal of a murderer since Anthony Hopkins's magnum opus Hannibal Lecter from &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot;  In that instance, Hopkins deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar.

Poncelet first seeks Sister Helen's help in filing his appeal and obtaining legal representation.  She is at his side through all the legal proceedings, and once Poncelet's chances for clemency are exhausted, she then helps him prepare for the execution by giving him spiritual guidance.  Sister Helen must also try and allay the hurt and betrayal felt by the parents of the children that Poncelet was convicted of murdering.This movie's greatest strength is the tremendous performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.  Both were given Academy Award nominations for their roles, and Sarandon actually won the Oscar for Best Actress.  I would have given this movie a 5 star rating, but I wasn't completely satisfied with the way in which the friendship between Sister Helen and Matthew Poncelet developed.  In movies where two people from opposite walks of life come together for a given purpose, both usually walk away a little wiser and with a broader perspective.  Sean Penn's character showed these changes, but Susan Sarandon's character was the same at the end of the movie as it was at the beginning.  According to this movie, Sister Helen had learned nothing valuable or life-altering from her friendship with Matthew Poncelet.When it first came out, this movie generated a great deal of public discussion about the death penalty.  Those who support capital punishment believe that, in theory, there are certain crimes so heinous that those who commit them should be required to forfeit their life as restitution.  This movie shows the huge difference between theory and reality.  I think people might change their minds about capital punishment once they see that carrying out this theory requires strapping a guy onto a gurney, sticking a needle into his arm, and injecting him with lethal chemicals.  I'll probably think about this movie for a long time to come, and it's entirely possible that it may sway my opinion on the death penalty.Regardless of your stance on this controversial subject, this movie is guaranteed entertainment, and a definite must-see!",4,An Outstanding Movie With Stirring Performances,1042675200,"01 16, 2003",2003,2475,"['Regardless', 'stance', 'death', 'penalty', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'perhaps', 'exactly', 'what', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'great', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'nun', 'named', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'Prejean', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'rapist', 'named', 'Matthew', 'Poncelet', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'scheduled', 'be', 'executed', 'lethal', 'injection', 'State', 'Louisiana', 'Poncelet', 'first', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'help', 'filing', 'appeal', 'obtaining', 'legal', 'representation', 'side', 'legal', 'proceedings', 'once', 'Poncelet', 'chances', 'clemency', 'are', 'exhausted', 'then', 'prepare', 'execution', 'giving', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'must', 'also', 'try', 'allay', 'hurt', 'betrayal', 'felt', 'parents', 'children', 'Poncelet', 'was', 'convicted', 'murdering.This', 'movie', 'greatest', 'strength', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'were', 'given', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'roles', 'Sarandon', 'actually', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'satisfied', 'way', 'friendship', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'Matthew', 'Poncelet', 'developed', 'movies', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'opposite', 'walks', 'life', 'come', 'together', 'given', 'purpose', 'usually', 'walk', 'away', 'little', 'wiser', 'broader', 'perspective', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'character', 'showed', 'changes', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'was', 'same', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'beginning', 'According', 'movie', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'had', 'learned', 'nothing', 'valuable', 'life-altering', 'friendship', 'Matthew', 'Poncelet.When', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'generated', 'great', 'deal', 'public', 'discussion', 'death', 'penalty', 'who', 'support', 'capital', 'punishment', 'believe', 'theory', 'are', 'certain', 'crimes', 'so', 'heinous', 'who', 'commit', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'forfeit', 'life', 'restitution', 'movie', 'huge', 'difference', 'theory', 'reality', 'think', 'people', 'might', 'change', 'minds', 'capital', 'punishment', 'see', 'carrying', 'out', 'theory', 'strapping', 'guy', 'gurney', 'sticking', 'needle', 'arm', 'injecting', 'lethal', 'chemicals', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'think', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'entirely', 'possible', 'may', 'sway', 'opinion', 'death', 'penalty.Regardless', 'stance', 'controversial', 'subject', 'movie', 'guaranteed', 'entertainment', 'definite', 'must-see']",N/A
147505,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0792842073,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","This is an interesting movie that explores the concepts of capitol punishment. The movie claims to be neutral, but it does seem to be against it.Very quickly, Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) is visiting Sean Penn who is sentenced to die for having a part in killing 2 teenagers. Sarandon tries to be compassionate, but she realizes that Penn at the very least has issues. She is trying to get Penn to believe in Jesus (seeing that his days are numbered). Penn denies responsibility for the deaths of the teenagers, so Sarandon does everything within her power to see that he gets fair chances of appeals. Needless to say, the parents of the victims just want Penn executed. (This begins an interesting subplot that will come full circle.)Penn may have gotten some miles in his pleas, but he makes the DUMB mistake of praising Adolf Hitler on television. Granted, innocent people have been arrested and executed, but Penn has now shown his 'issues' on television for all to see. Needless to say, Sarandon is annoyed.Perhaps due to Penn's acting abilities, we come to care about his character despite his crimes and mental issues. We then see that his execution is inevitable, and Sarandon has to go through the difficult job of being at Penn's side to the end. The methods of execution start to look cold and calculating. And we start to wonder what gives us the right to take the life of even a criminal. We can see that Sarandon gets little help from those she should. While the Prison Chaplain coldly says: ""The Old Testament says 'an eye for an eye,' Sarandon bitterly counters it: ""What about the NEW Testament where Jesus says: 'A man is greater than his worst sin?'""There is some release of tension as Penn has a moment with his family. Once he confesses his guilt, the writer does not allow our newly won sympathy for Penn to slack for a moment. It will in fact increase right up until the end. Sarandon's arguably strongest moment is when she tells Penn to just keep his eyes on her face as sentence is carried out. In a way, Penn does have a final triumphant moment when he can honestly say: ""Killing is wrong, whether it's me who does it, or your government."" In other words, Penn has shown his executioners as well as others that they have become what they accused him of being.If you are for capitol punishment, you are probably not going to like this movie.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[2, 3]","Director Tim Robbins' adaption of Sister Helen Prejean's book of her own denunciation of capital punishment is a probing and intelligent analysis of whether capital punishment serves or denies justice in a society where support for the death penalty hovers near the 80 percent mark. The complexities of the hotly debated issues that make up the pros and cons of state-sanctioned death are posited here, and the film doesn't come up with any clear answer one way or the other. But ""Dead Man Walking"" doesn't set out to answer that question. Instead, it focuses on one condemned murderer's unsteady walk to a gurney where he is to meet his final judgment and how one woman helps him accept responsibility for his guilt and accept his fate with the help of the faith she nurtures in him. Susan Sarandon nailed a Best Actress Oscar for her sensitive but practical portrayal of the nun who turns spiritual advisor to Sean Penn's condemned character. Looking every bit like someone capable of murder, Penn basks in one of the best performances of his career in an Oscar-nominated tour de force, and the unlikely Sarandon-Penn combination is subtly electrifying. In the end, director Robbins may be asking us to reassess our own position on capital punishment, and his film is a provocative and educational tool to use in starting that re-examination.",4,Capital punishment: Just or not?,1040256000,"12 19, 2002",2002,1344,"['Director', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'adaption', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'Prejean', 'book', 'own', 'denunciation', 'capital', 'punishment', 'probing', 'intelligent', 'analysis', 'capital', 'punishment', 'serves', 'denies', 'justice', 'society', 'where', 'support', 'death', 'penalty', 'hovers', '80', 'percent', 'mark', 'complexities', 'hotly', 'debated', 'issues', 'make', 'up', 'pros', 'cons', 'state-sanctioned', 'death', 'are', 'posited', 'here', 'film', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'clear', 'answer', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'answer', 'question', 'Instead', 'one', 'condemned', 'murderer', 'unsteady', 'walk', 'gurney', 'where', 'meet', 'final', 'judgment', 'how', 'one', 'woman', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'guilt', 'accept', 'fate', 'help', 'faith', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'nailed', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'sensitive', 'practical', 'portrayal', 'nun', 'who', 'spiritual', 'advisor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'condemned', 'character', 'Looking', 'bit', 'someone', 'capable', 'murder', 'Penn', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'Oscar-nominated', 'tour', 'force', 'unlikely', 'Sarandon-Penn', 'combination', 'subtly', 'electrifying', 'end', 'director', 'Robbins', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'reassess', 'own', 'position', 'capital', 'punishment', 'film', 'provocative', 'educational', 'tool', 'use', 'starting', 're-examination']",N/A

147511,A2GYX971VETQBV,0792842073,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[12, 13]","DEAD MAN WALKING is one of the most powerful films I have seen in a long time.  In terms of pure ""guts,"" this film takes the cake.  Watching it just makes me wonder why Tim Robbins doesn't step up to the director's plate more often.  This film is a testament to good filmmaking: great technique, beautiful shots, outstanding performances, and the avoidance of clich&eacute;.  DEAD MAN WALKING, as its name suggests, tells the moving story of Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a nun who winds up responding to an inmate's (Sean Penn) cry for help and soon finds herself in over her head.  What follows is an emotional journey: an exploration of the death penalty that refuses (at every turn) to drop into ideology and formula.And let me tell you why.  Most films that deal with the philosophy behind the death penalty tend to ""choose sides.""  On the one hand, the state is depicted as a fickle body that mercilessly puts innocent men to die, while the victim's families stand around and revel in watching the convicted man fry.  DEAD MAN WALKING has its share of politics and angry victims, but the victims are fleshed out, given back story, and deliver a deep emotional impact on the film.  On the other hand, the death penalty can be handled by as a necessary arm of justice, allowing us all to breathe easy at night knowing that one more killer is off the streets.  But DEAD MAN WALKING refuses to take up this line either.  Instead, the film becomes a well-balanced exploration of the issues surrounding crime and punishment.  In the end, the film evolves into an exploration of the possibility of redemption, quite apart from any issues concerning justice.Not enough can be said about Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.  Their performances are simply stunning.  Sarandon plays a real nun, rather than the cardboard figure portraits of the clergy I am used to seeing in a film.  Her performance breathes and her journey allows the audience to follow her path, providing us with an emotional trajectory.  Sean Penn, once again, proves that he is pretty much the best actor working right now.  His performance is incredible.  As in most of his recent roles, you forget you're watching Penn: the character comes through.  In particular, the last twenty minutes of the film are incredibly heart-wrenching.  You just have to see the film to understand.DEAD MAN WALKING is a fine film and one that I don't hesitate to give five stars.  I will soon be adding it to my DVD collection.

It was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  This true story was adapted into movie brilliantly.  The emotional impact is present in every scene and every word.  The hardcore impact is present from the moment Sister Helen meets Matthew, a death row inmate recently given his execution date, to the end.  Such intensity keeps audience interested the whole time.  This also opens the debate about death row in the US.  The ensembe was lead by Tim Robbins in his directorial debut.  He wonderfully created every scene with his own emotional impact, which is clearly expressed.  Susan Sarandon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her portrayal of Sister Helen (the real Sister Helen is seen in the candlelighting memorial).  Her research of the events and the people is prevelant.  This is one of her career bests.  Sean Penn's portrayal of Matthew earned his place as a serious actor; therefore, placing him many steps ahead from where he was before.  His heart and soul is poured into every scene, namely his breaking down scenes.  Both actors' own emotional impact makes this movie a more unforgettable experience.  Bruce Springsteen's theme song, also called ""Dead Man Walking"", is a great song and performance to represent such a powerful movie.

147517,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0792842073,D. Litton,"[7, 8]","&quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; tells the true story of one Sister Helen Prejean, a uniquely compassionate nun who goes on an emotionally taxing journey with a man who, after being on Death Row for six years, is scheduled to die within a week of their first meeting. What she will encounter on this journey will be an experience unlike anything she has ever encountered, as she must try to bring him to the realization that he must atone for his crimes in order to receive God's salvation.This is, without a doubt, one of the best films of 1995, as well as any year. The film has courage and strength, as well as portraying both of these qualities in its characters, who are given room and time to develop the story on their own terms. It inspires feelings about so many different issues on many complex levels, while never really taking a side on any of these issues. The movie is what you make it out to be: is he a guilty man? Does he only want redemption because of his impending death? Or has he truly changed?The movie takes its time in allowing us to decide this, beginning with Sister Helen's life among the people she teaches in a black neighborhood, where she lives. From the beginning, we know that she is not a prejudice person, nor does she allow her religious beliefs to get in the way of helping people, which is evident in her action of responding to a letter from a Death Row convict named Matthew Poncelet, whose crimes include rape and murder. As she begins having meetings with him, she only feels that she is doing what her calling requires: helping those who would seek salvation in their quest to find it.She gets more than she bargained for by meeting Poncelet, whose mustache and goatee, sleek hair and tattoos, and objective language practically scream the word &quot;criminal.&quot; During their first meetings, the audience will practically feel the tension between the two characters, especially as Poncelet begins using his foul terms in the presence of Prejean, who never flinches but is noticeably uncomfortable with his language. But she presses on, first diving into his political views, but then realizing that in order for her to be able to get through this without falling apart, she will need to focus on getting him to confess his part in the crime and take responsibility for his sins.This is done with some of the most powerful acting performances I've ever seen in a film. Susan Sarandon is totally convincing as Sister Helen, who is portrayed as timid on the outside but posesses a strong will and determination to accomplish what she has sought out to do. Her kind nature and caring heart are the perfect contrast for Sean Penn, who brings a terrific balance of contempt and sorrow to the character of Poncelet. This is one of his best performances ever, portraying the convict as cold and heartless in the face of his crimes, but once alone with Sister Helen, he has no where to hide.The movie also dives into an even more emotional turmoil: the impact that a murder has on the families of the victims and the criminals. Sister Helen visits both the family of Poncelet, and the families of the murder victims, all of whom feel intense emotion and sadness over the crimes. Poncelet's mother feels a strong sense of sadness over the situation her son has gotten himself into, blaming it on the influence his older friend had on him. The parents of the murder victims, who are at first contemptuous of Sister Helen, tell their side of the story in such a way that Sister Helen, as well as the audience, becomes torn not over who to believe, but who to feel more sympathy for. It becomes a tug-of-war of sorts, where in one instance we feel remorse for one side, then the other, but very rarely both. It focuses so much on one point at a time that we forget about everything else but the conversation going on at present.The movie also has a lot to say about how we as a society act in terms of different beliefs about capital punishment. The entire plot of the movie centers around the countdown to Poncelet's death, with the victims' parents and their supporters crying out for the death penalty, while Sister Helen and Poncelet's lawyer try desperately to stop it from happening in hopes that she may be able to turn his life around. I felt such a sense of mortal disgust at the final sequences of the film, during the scene of the execution, in which the victims' parents and others gather to converse before watching Poncelet's execution. The movie builds up so emotion before this final scene that one cannot help but feel some contempt for those who would even wish to see such an event take place.

I truly believed that if someone committed such a heinous crime as taking the life of another person, then they deserved to die.What  &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; did for me was never challenge that belief, or  try to dissuade me through debate. What it did was present one of the most  well-rounded, emotional films that asked the questions I never asked myself  when considering this punishment.I was very leary of seeing this film  because I didn't want to sit through two hours of being preached at by a  one-sided liberal point of view. What ended up happening was because Sister  Helen Prejean struggled with everything herself, I began to struggle too.  Because she had the courage to deal both with this hideous, racist criminal  and the victims understandable embittered families, I began to deal with  them too. After watching this film, I began to doubt my own stance, finally  recognizing that death for death is no just punishment.That's not to say  you will reach such a conclusion. The movie doesn't suggest anything of the  sort. What the movie does is present to us the confusing array of pieces,  and we, as individuals, and as a society, need to construct the puzzle as  we see. But we must not hide from the hard facts of executions, we must not  anesthesize ourselves to the horror of what we inflict on these prisoners.  The movies suggests that we see the entire picture before making our own  judgment calls.The performances of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn are some  of the best I've seen in any film recently.

147527,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,0792842073,Jason N. Mical,"[2, 3]","Dead Man Walking is a rare gem of a movie.  Based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Sister Helen Prejean, three-time Nobel Prize nominee and noted death penalty activist, the movie follows Sister Helen's spiritual, philosophical, and emotional journey as she acts as a spiritual advisor to a prisoner on Louisiana's Death Row.The film opens with Prejean accepting the position, not knowing what to expect, and continues with her harrowing personal journey as she meets the prisoner she has been corresponding with, the families of the prisoner's victims, and the lawmen involved both in his arrest and his incarceration.Dead Man Walking isn't simple bleeding-heart propaganda, and truly shines because the film - like Prejean's wonderful book - refuses to take the easy way out.  Writer/director Tim Robbin's script gives equal time to both sides of this divisive issue, and trivializes neither by compacting tense, emotions into sound bites and bumper-sticker philosophy, which is what happens all too frequently in movies that pretend to be &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;meaningful.&quot;Deciding where one stands on any philosophical and ethical issue is never an easy decision, and Dead Man Walking takes that path of discovery and truly gives it its fair due.  The film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, but does take a rather anti-capital punishment stance towards the end, as the main character begins to from her opinions.Dead Man Walking is as fine a piece of filmmaking as anyone can ask, with excellent preformances all around (Sarandon won a Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Prejean).  The death penalty is not a simple issue, since it taps into some of our rawest emotions; it is one thing to sit in a classroom and debate, or form an &quot;ethic&quot; based upon reading a book, and quite another to face the person that raped and killed your daughter or son, mother or father, brother or sister.  This film is complicated enough to wrestle with that issue and come out as a shining example of the level of thought that can go into one production.People expecting easy answers, propaganda, or re-affirmation of their point of view shouldn't watch.  Those who are interested in a layered piece of human experienced universalized, Dead Man Walking is highly recommended.",5,A movie without easy answers or bumper-sticker philosophies,983059200,"02 25, 2001",2001,2323,"['Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'rare', 'gem', 'movie', 'Based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'Prejean', 'three-time', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'nominee', 'noted', 'death', 'penalty', 'activist', 'movie', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'spiritual', 'philosophical', 'emotional', 'journey', 'spiritual', 'advisor', 'prisoner', 'Louisiana', 'Death', 'Row.The', 'film', 'Prejean', 'accepting', 'position', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'harrowing', 'personal', 'journey', 'prisoner', 'been', 'corresponding', 'families', 'prisoner', 'victims', 'lawmen', 'involved', 'arrest', 'incarceration.Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', ""n't"", 'simple', 'bleeding-heart', 'propaganda', 'truly', 'shines', 'film', 'Prejean', 'wonderful', 'book', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'Writer/director', 'Tim', 'Robbin', 'script', 'equal', 'time', 'sides', 'divisive', 'issue', 'compacting', 'tense', 'emotions', 'sound', 'bites', 'bumper-sticker', 'philosophy', 'what', 'too', 'frequently', 'movies', 'pretend', 'be', 'quot', 'deep', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'Deciding', 'where', 'one', 'philosophical', 'ethical', 'issue', 'never', 'easy', 'decision', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'path', 'discovery', 'truly', 'fair', 'due', 'film', 'viewer', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'take', 'rather', 'anti-capital', 'punishment', 'stance', 'end', 'main', 'character', 'opinions.Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'as', 'fine', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'anyone', 'can', 'ask', 'excellent', 'preformances', 'Sarandon', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'portrayal', 'Prejean', 'death', 'penalty', 'not', 'simple', 'issue', 'rawest', 'emotions', 'one', 'thing', 'sit', 'classroom', 'debate', 'form', 'quot', 'quot', 'based', 'reading', 'book', 'quite', 'face', 'person', 'raped', 'killed', 'daughter', 'son', 'mother', 'father', 'brother', 'sister', 'film', 'complicated', 'enough', 'wrestle', 'issue', 'come', 'out', 'shining', 'example', 'level', 'thought', 'can', 'go', 'one', 'production.People', 'expecting', 'easy', 'answers', 'propaganda', 're-affirmation', 'point', 'view', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'layered', 'piece', 'human', 'experienced', 'universalized', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn give riveting performances as the main characters in this film.  Penn stars as Matthew Poncelet, a man sentenced to die for committing two brutal murders.  Sarandon stars as Sister Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun who begins corresponding with Poncelet and finally goes to the prison to meet him.  What she encounters is a hardened criminal who shows no remorse for his crimes, and even places blame on the system for locking him up, all the time claiming his innocence and insisting he was merely a bystander.  Prejean tries to break through Poncelet's thick exterior and help him realize that he is indeed responsible for his crimes and he should seek forgiveness, both from God and the victims' families.I was struck by the way the film showed the change in Poncelet as his execution date neared.  Gone was the rough exterior, replaced by a person who has finally accepted his fate and his mistakes.

147532,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,0792842073,J. Michael Click,"[1, 3]","A double tour de force from writer-director Tim Robbins.  After condensing the autobiographical novel in which anti-death penalty proponent Sister Helen Prejean movingly recounted her experiences counseling condemned murderers in Louisiana, Robbins provides a fascinating counter-balance by giving equal emphasis to pro-death penalty advocates as represented by the victim's families.  The result?  A mature, gripping screenplay that doesn't pretend to provide glib answers to the many difficult questions it raises.Such a powerful script demanded careful casting decisions, and Director Robbins scored a series of coups, assembling a roster of actors at the peak of their talents.  Susan Sarandon, a consistently fine actress, glows with inner conviction as Sister Helen, searching to apply spiritual truths in the unfamiliar realm of Death Row.  Sarandon's Oscar-winning performance is given an added measure of power by Sean Penn's wrenching portrait of composite killer Matthew Poncelot.  Penn is at once loathsome yet pitiable, brutal yet oddly vulnerable; his carefully nuanced performance is the embodiment of Sarandon's line about every person being &quot;better than their worst act&quot;.  Able support is offered by R. Lee Ermey, Celia Weston, and (especially) Raymond J. Barry as the parents of Penn's teen-aged victims; this trio's raw pain is extremely difficult to reconcile with the compassion that Penn's character tends to demand of the audience.The DVD presentation of this modern classic is beautifully rendered, offering crisp, clear sound and sharp visuals.  The carefully composed camera shots are best appreciated in the film's original widescreen aspect ratio.

I recently re-watched it because a friend of mine had expressed an interest in seeing it and because I have been doing sort of an informal study of redemption in the arts.I disagree with those who say that Dead Man Walking presents an objective view. Just look who is in front of and behind the camera: Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn- three of the Poster-People of the Hollywood Far-Left. The focus of the film is clearly Sister Helen Prejean, (the film is based upon her book of the same name.) Indeed, the best part about ""Dead Man Walking"" is watching her wander quite unwittingly into a storm of hate and all-consuming sadness when she started out merely wanting to give a dying man some comfort in his final days, regardless of the means and motive of his death.Still, because she is so obviously against Matthew Poncelet's execution she can definitely not be considered a neutral party.It is certainly true that the victim's families are given a powerful voice, especially that of Clyde Percy, played with seething perfection by R. Lee Ermey.While Sean Penn's performance, (like most of his work) is brilliant, I can say unequivocally that Matthew Poncelet remains a thoroughly dislikable human-being to the very end, he only disavows his Nazi beliefs when it becomes clear that they are a contributing factor to his execution.  Worse, his belated confession of already well-established guilt is the very definition of ""too little, too late"", this is only compounded when he says ""I think killin' is wrong, whether it's me or y'all, or the government that's doin' it."" He follows that astoundingly hypocritical statement with an address to the victims, ""I hope my death brings you some peace.""  Doesn't anyone remember that he is simply repeating Prejean's words, and that those words were prompted by Pocelet's defiant declaration that he ""had a few words for Clyde Percy"".  Worse still is the presentation of the execution itself, the images of Poncelet's death are juxtaposed with images of his crime, which I am assuming (given the rest of the film, and the POVs of its creators) is meant to suggest some sort of perverse similarity between the two. It had the opposite effect on me, seeing those two events set side-by-side convinced me beyond doubt that the right course was taken.

This is the story about the humanity of man and being judged by one's worst deed...or as the trailer puts it:  about looking into the eyes of a killer and finding the heart of a man.  Adapted from the best-selling non-fiction book, this film puts forth a valid arguement of why capital punishment is not the answer for society's worst of the worst.  Sean Penn sits on Death Row in Louisiana, awaiting his execution for a brutal rape and double murder, a crime for which his partner got life behind bars.  Susan Sarandon, a nun, comes to meet with him and her eyes are opened up as the days tick down towards his scheduled execution.  Becoming his spiritual advisor in the final days, she sees the mechinations and procedures set in place for putting a human being to death.  She also meets the people who are involved in the process, those who oppose the punishment, and those who favor it, like the victims' families.  She must now find a way to understand the pain felt by both sides of the case and help Penn's character come to terms with what is happening to him in the hopes that he might then be able to find God before his time is up.  This powerful film can serve as a teaching tool about capital punishment and it can be enjoyed and talked about within the privacy of one's home...or it can just be enjoyed.  Both Sarandon and Penn give terrific performances as they spend almost the entire film sperated by bulletproof barriers inside the prison.  Their intamacy must be felt without the two of them ever touching one another and both actors pull that off successful.

It would have been truly interesting and I am sure also life affirming to listen to her experiences in those dark days back then. But Tim Robbins film is a powerfully moving experience that tells a very painful but gloriously touching recounting of what happened during those depressing, dark and freightening days she spent with Poncelet on death row. An average woman of faith who cared enough to take an interest in a man who commited terrible crimes. She her self had never been involved in something so hopelessly dark and painful, but she was used in a wonderful way to help bring peace to the convicted killer and the families who suffered the loss of loved ones at his hands. Sean Pean and Susan Sarrandon give astonishing heartfelt performances that are rarely seen in cinema. Especially Penn who clearly was so deeply over-taken by this character that it must have been deeply emotionally draining experience to go through.

This movie follows their relationship as they grow closer and closer to eachother until it can go no further.  Prejean, a loving, empathetic, and helpful woman is inspiring and amazing.  She battles her own personal struggles alone so as to continue helping Poncelet as much as she possibly can.  Poncelet is, at first, a harsh living example of brutality, mistakes, and most of all, regret and redemption.  Never swallowing his pride, he continually tries to convince those around him that he is innocent, he never killed anyone, and that although he was wrongly convicted, he is not afraid to die, and realizes there are no alternatives.  Just when you think he is as abrasive as he can get, there are some rapid twists in his opinions and actions, and finally, a tear is shed for a man who made a hellacious mistake, a man who feels sorrow for someone other than himself for once, and a man who finally opens up and lets someone in rather than playing the role of a hardened inmate.  The acting is phenomenal (in both lead and supporting roles as well; keep an eye out for a then-nobody Jack Black as Poncelet's brother), the script is impressively simple, yet complex, and this movie is brilliant.

147557,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0792842073,Reviewer,"[4, 5]","In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick.  And to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not.  At the heart of ""Dead Man Walking,"" directed by Tim Robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand.  And it is what this film is actually all about:  Forgiveness.  Real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.Director/screenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in God.  As chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola.  Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience.  And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience.  Through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.For her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began).  Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization.  It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career.Turning in a career-best performance, as well, is Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost out to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in ""Leaving Las Vegas).  Perfect for the part in every way, Penn has quite simply never been better, before or since.  He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here.  Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact.  It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things.  And that's the strength of Penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul.  A terrific performance, and -- as good as Cage was in ""Vegas""-- Penn should have received the Oscar for it.In another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Poncelet's victims.  With limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface.  Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet).  It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what Robbins has accomplished with ""Dead Man Walking.""  Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness.  For, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work.  And it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her.",5,Emotionally Involving Drama

147559,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,0792842073,Shashank Tripathi,"[6, 7]","That's the penitent outcry of a hard-boiled criminal awaiting the chair.No mean feat to make such a heartfelt film on a sensitive subject (capital punishment, with religious undertones) without being preachy or lopsided. I can think of several movies that have reached for similar heights (Life of David Gale, Rampage, Vigilante) but Dead Man Walking is probably the only one that pulls it off with so much sanity and compassion.Our protagonist (Sean Penn in probably the role of his life, other than Mystic River) is on his final leg on death row for an allegedly racially-instigated rape and murder of a young woman and her boyfriend. Sister Helen (Sarandon) is a nun called upon to console and befriend the man in hopes to evoke remorse for his dastardly act, and hence redemption according to the Catholic faith.Doing thus, she soon becomes the viewers' eyes; we see events as she experiences them, facts revealed as she discovers them. She visits not only the callous inmate but also his victims' families. Interacting with them takes her into their world, which she finds is seething with anger.We understand this of course given the gravity of the crime, but this is where the script excels, it's not a strident, single-minded indictment of a murderer. The raped girl's family are a loving folk yet viciously spiteful of the rapist, with a near-maniacal thirst for revenge. At one point, the father shrieks, ""I could kill the beast with my own bare hands."" Lines blur here about who the ""beast"" is.Sarandon and Penn won their deserved accolades but the true winner here is the story for showing us the harrowing realities of executions. The dialogue is subtly witty and has interesting takes on big issues. At one stage, a prison guard says to a nun, ""You know what the bible says, an eye for an eye"". The nun says, "" You know what else the Bible ask for death as a punishment? For adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, trespass upon sacred grounds, profane in a sabbath and contempt to parents."" An educated nun with an open mind. Truly refreshing.The film is unequivocal in its position on the death penalty (against it), but never forces it. Pro-death penalty folks will hardly change their mind after this film, but it won't drive them screaming from the theater either. It may not be for everyone, but it has its heart and head in the right place.Very, very moving, thought-provoking stuff.

147562,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0792842073,Themis-Athena,"[63, 66]","""Sister, I won't ask for forgiveness; my sins are all I have,"" sings Bruce Springsteen in this movie's title song while the end credits roll over the screen - giving voice once more to Matthew Poncelet and the men portrayed in Sister Helen Prejean's nonfiction account on which this movie is based; that angry ""white trash,"" those men who are ""God's mistake,"" as one victim's father says, inconsolable over the loss of his daughter; those men locked up in high security prisons for unspeakable crimes which many of them claim they didn't commit.  And Matt Poncelet (Sean Penn) is just such a guy; locked in bravado and denial, he proclaims his innocence and would rather take a lie detector test on the day of his execution ""so my momma knows I didn't do this"" than own up to his responsibility.With Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), we first learn about the crime which landed Poncelet on death row - the rape-murder of a couple on lovers' lane - from the account she receives when she starts writing to him and eventually agrees to visit him in prison.  It is, as she will soon learn, a story that anti-death penalty advocates are all too familiar with; a story of unequal access to lawyers and of two defendants, each blaming all guilt for their crime exclusively on the other, regardless what truly happened.  And as long as she is assured that even if Poncelet would have a new trial he wouldn't go free (as an accomplice, under Louisiana state law he would receive a lifetime prison sentence), Sister Helen is willing to help him find a lawyer and, when the date for his execution is set, try to obtain a reprieve.But it does not end there, as she soon finds out; and one of this movie's greatest strengths is the way in which it portrays all sides of the moral issues involved in the death penalty.  There are the victims' families, a stunning 70% of which break up after the murder of a child, and who are forever stuck with the unloving last words spoken to their loved ones and the memory of all the little homely details reminding them of their loss.  There are the prison guards and nurses, trying to see executions as ""part of their job"" - with varying success.  There are the politicians, barking slogans on TV; promising to ""get tough on sentencing, get tough on lenient parole boards, get tough on judges who pass light sentences.""  There are the convicts' families, marginalized as a result of their brothers' and sons' acts, particularly if they refuse to condemn them publicly.  (""Now I'm famous,"" Poncelet's mother comments bitterly on the dubious celebrity status she has attained as a result of a TV show about Matt.  ""A regular Ma Barker!"")  And there is the death penalty itself, shown in all its chilling, graphic, clinical detail, here in its allegedly most humane form: lethal injections, which tranquilize the muscles while the poison reaches the convict's lungs and heart - ""his face goes to sleep while his inside organs are going through Armageddon,"" Poncelet's attorney says at his pardon board hearing.  ""It was important to us to show all sides of the issue,"" explains director Tim Robbins on the DVD's commentary track, ""not to be satisfied with soundbites, and to present the reality ... Ultimately, the question is not who deserves to die, but who has the right to kill.""At the heart of the story are two radically different individuals:  Sister Helen, who has grown up in an affluent, loving family; and Matthew Poncelet, the convicted killer.  And their portrayal is this movie's other great strength: without either of them, this film would not have been half as compelling.  Both Sarandon and Penn deliver Academy Award-worthy performances.  (Sarandon did win her long overdue Oscar, Penn lost to Nicolas Cage for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" - this would have been an occasion where I would have favored a split award.)  Gradually, very gradually we see them get to know each other; and as they do, the visual layers separating them in the prison visiting room are peeled away.  Yet, even after he has learned to accept Sister Helen as a human being (not without attempting to come on to her as if she were not a nun - director Tim Robbins's way of dispelling the notion that they might fall in love, as is so often the case in the more cliched versions of this type of story), Poncelet insists that his participation was limited to holding one of the victims down, but that it was his accomplice who raped and killed them both.  And even days before his execution, he is still looking for ""loopholes"" in the bible, as Sister Helen admonishes him, seeing redemption as a free ticket into heaven instead of a means of owning up to his responsibility.  (""I like that,"" he comments when she quotes Jesus's ""the truth shall make you free.""  ""So I pass that lie detector test, I'm home free."")  Only in his final hour, he slowly, gradually gives up the protective layers of his bravado and lays bare his raw nerve and innermost anguish.  And while he speaks, finally, in a complete flashback, we, the viewers, see what really happened that dark and lonely night in the woods, and what all the previous partial flashbacks have not revealed.""It is easy to kill a monster, but hard to kill a human being,"" Poncelet's attorney once explains; and Tim Robbins echoes that sentiment on the commentary track.  Yet, this movie is not about romanticizing a brutal killer, any more than it is about demonizing his victims.  It is, first and foremost, an attempt to bring a complete perspective to one of contemporary America's most pressing problems, and to find a way past sorrow and hate and move towards the future.  And even if you're still for the death penalty after having watched it - don't claim ignorance as to what is involved.Also recommended:Dead Man Walking: An Eyewitness Account Of The Death Penalty In

And he couldn't shortchange them.  And he doesn't.  The pain the parents of the victims feel is real.  And the crime that starts it all is not forgotten.What surprised me re-watching the movie is how deeply religious the film is.  It's hard to imagine you could miss it in a movie about a nun, but this might be one of the most deeply religious movies ever made.  Tucked inside this movie about the death penalty is a movie about forgiveness.  And the movie doesn't shortchange that, either.  It's easier to forgive sins in the abstract; sins against others.  And the movie acknowledges that.  But at the end of the day comes down solidly on the power of forgiveness and necessity of coming to terms with sins against us for peace of mind in our own lives.",5,Outstanding,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,1026,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'returned', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'last', 'night.Robbins', 'think', 'understood', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'effective', 'movie', 'death', 'penalty', 'had', 'take', 'arguments', 'death', 'penalty', 'proponents', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'shortchange', ""n't"", 'pain', 'parents', 'victims', 'feel', 'real', 'crime', 'not', 'forgotten.What', 'surprised', 're-watching', 'movie', 'how', 'deeply', 'religious', 'film', 'hard', 'imagine', 'could', 'miss', 'movie', 'nun', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'deeply', 'religious', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Tucked', 'movie', 'death', 'penalty', 'movie', 'forgiveness', 'movie', ""n't"", 'shortchange', 'easier', 'forgive', 'sins', 'abstract', 'sins', 'others', 'movie', 'end', 'day', 'down', 'solidly', 'power', 'forgiveness', 'necessity', 'coming', 'terms', 'sins', 'peace', 'mind', 'own', 'lives']",N/A

It is the story of Sr Helen Prejean who meets a man who has been on Death Row for six years and had only less than a week to live. The movie depicts her compassionate journey with him to the end. The powerfully simple script without any dramatic twists and the compelling characters brillaintly acted out by Oscar winner Susan Sarandon along with Sean Penn, make this a memorable movie of all time.

147565,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,0792842073,"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor""","[2, 3]","It is rare for a movie to portray without attempt to sway, to take on a heavyweight topic  without melodrama, to delve into religion without preaching, to handle a matter of political explosiveness without being didactic. Dead Man Walking is that kind of rare.Susan Sarandon, portraying Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn, portraying the killer rapist whose spiritual guidance she takes into her hands, both give truly remarkable performances in this award-winning movie based on fact. Called to give succor to this unrepentant criminal on death row, Sarandon brings to life a nun's struggle to be a true Christian - that is, to reach out to the lowest of the low, the soul so dark it may be beyond anyone's reach or compassion but God's. Penn is utterly convincing in his role, bringing to the screen the damaged ugliness of a murderer's evil heart, as well as his final moments of anguish that finally allow real feeling to surface. Sarandon won an Oscar for her performance; both deserved the honor.Capital punishment is (and should be) debated by many. Dead Man Walking masterfully shows all sides of a many-sided issue. There is no right, there is no wrong in this movie. But there is also no looking away. The crime that led to the criminal's execution is horrible beyond description, but it is effectively and powerfully revealed, image by image, torment by torment, throughout the entire movie. No one wins in this movie, all lose. All suffer, and it is impossible to say whose suffering is the greatest. All mothers here suffer a daily excruciation, whether she is the mother of a killer or the mother of a murdered child. Can anyone say whose suffering is greater? Hatred and forgiveness are poignantly shown, and both can be understood, neither of these emotions are out of place.Director Tom Robbins has allowed his viewer to be one of intelligence. He forces no perspective, he makes no judgement. He allows the viewer to see, to feel for all or for no one, and perhaps to know nothing more than the hopelessness of a situation where so many lives are affected, damaged forever. Who deserves what-is not the most important issue tackled. But if one question alone is raised, it is this: does anyone, one man or an entire government, have the right to kill? On whatever side, or no side, the viewer's opinion falls, the movie is no less powerful from any perspective.",5,Winning movie in which all lose...,1052092800,"05 5, 2003",2003,2380,"['rare', 'movie', 'portray', 'attempt', 'sway', 'take', 'heavyweight', 'topic', 'melodrama', 'delve', 'religion', 'preaching', 'handle', 'matter', 'political', 'explosiveness', 'being', 'didactic', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'kind', 'rare.Susan', 'Sarandon', 'portraying', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'Prejean', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'portraying', 'killer', 'rapist', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'hands', 'give', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'award-winning', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'Called', 'give', 'succor', 'unrepentant', 'criminal', 'death', 'row', 'Sarandon', 'life', 'nun', 'struggle', 'be', 'true', 'Christian', 'reach', 'out', 'lowest', 'low', 'soul', 'so', 'dark', 'may', 'be', 'anyone', 'reach', 'compassion', 'God', 'Penn', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'role', 'bringing', 'screen', 'damaged', 'ugliness', 'murderer', 'evil', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'moments', 'anguish', 'finally', 'allow', 'real', 'feeling', 'surface', 'Sarandon', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'deserved', 'honor.Capital', 'punishment', 'should', 'be', 'debated', 'many', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'masterfully', 'sides', 'many-sided', 'issue', 'right', 'wrong', 'movie', 'also', 'looking', 'away', 'crime', 'led', 'criminal', 'execution', 'horrible', 'description', 'effectively', 'powerfully', 'revealed', 'image', 'image', 'torment', 'torment', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'movie', 'lose', 'suffer', 'impossible', 'say', 'suffering', 'greatest', 'mothers', 'here', 'suffer', 'daily', 'excruciation', 'mother', 'killer', 'mother', 'murdered', 'child', 'Can', 'anyone', 'say', 'suffering', 'greater', 'Hatred', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'poignantly', 'shown', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'emotions', 'are', 'place.Director', 'Tom', 'Robbins', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'be', 'one', 'intelligence', 'perspective', 'judgement', 'viewer', 'see', 'feel', 'one', 'perhaps', 'know', 'nothing', 'more', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'are', 'affected', 'damaged', 'forever', 'Who', 'what-is', 'not', 'most', 'important', 'issue', 'tackled', 'one', 'question', 'alone', 'raised', 'anyone', 'one', 'man', 'entire', 'government', 'have', 'right', 'kill', 'side', 'side', 'viewer', 'opinion', 'movie', 'less', 'powerful', 'perspective']",N/A
