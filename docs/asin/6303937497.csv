It is set apart by the marvelous acting of Tommy Lee Jones who so very well conveys his feelings of confusion and guilt after being intimate with a woman he loves.  Although, David Strathairn, appears very briefly he is excellent, as usual, and draws you in to wanting to know more about this character, his life, his inner most feelings, and his strength, which is apparent by the dignity he portrays in dying. I thought the screenplay was very good, and wish it were a book, so I could really feel everyone's emotions.  This was really a magnificent piece of acting by Jones, who was so readable, by putting his feelings right out there.  It was too bad, there were no flashbacks with David Strathairn, as his too brief appearance was saddening.  He, I think, is too overlooked in his craft.  His ability to make himself believable, in any part he takes on is truly amazing.  In 'Broken Vows', he draws you in as he is the first actor to really appear, and the camera, doesn't leave his face and his mesmerizing eyes.  it draws you in, and he dies, almost immediately.  Annette O'Toole is adequate as the love interest, but I would have expected a deeper love interest for Jones.  I don't want to give away the ending, which is the only plausable finale.  I highly recommend it, not for the storyline but the truly good and convincing acting.  It sets the movie apart from others with the same theme.",3,"Distraught, Unfaithful, Priest",1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,1542,"['was', 'sort', 'typical', 'story', 'priest', 'who', 'love', 'doubts', 'beliefs', 'needs', 'time', 'understand', 'how', 'really', 'set', 'apart', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'conveys', 'feelings', 'confusion', 'guilt', 'being', 'intimate', 'woman', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'very', 'briefly', 'excellent', 'usual', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'character', 'life', 'inner', 'most', 'feelings', 'strength', 'apparent', 'dignity', 'dying', 'thought', 'screenplay', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'wish', 'were', 'book', 'could', 'really', 'feel', 'everyone', 'emotions', 'was', 'really', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'acting', 'Jones', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'readable', 'putting', 'feelings', 'right', 'there', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'too', 'brief', 'appearance', 'was', 'saddening', 'think', 'too', 'overlooked', 'craft', 'ability', 'make', 'believable', 'part', 'truly', 'amazing', ""'Broken"", 'Vows', 'first', 'actor', 'really', 'appear', 'camera', ""n't"", 'leave', 'face', 'mesmerizing', 'eyes', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'adequate', 'love', 'interest', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'deeper', 'love', 'interest', 'Jones', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'only', 'plausable', 'finale', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'storyline', 'truly', 'good', 'convincing', 'acting', 'movie', 'apart', 'others', 'same', 'theme']",Broken Vows VHS

TLJ is holding himself back trying not to be a stronger character. There are many loose ends, is the murderer caught? Do the lovers get together? What does the accused murderers homosexuality have to do with the story, and does he get off? I think the stories subject matter is very strong but needed to be more focused on temptation and guilt of a wayward priest and less on solving a seemingly simple murderwhich the cop couldn't figure out, but only took the priest and ex-girlfriend 2 scenes to solve. Good to watch if your a TLJ fan but not a very good story overall.",3,too many loose ends,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,678,"['am', 'fanatical', 'TLJ', 'fan', 'so', 'bought', 'DVD', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'broken', 'acting', 'be', 'forced', 'TLJ', 'holding', 'back', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'stronger', 'character', 'are', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'murderer', 'caught', 'Do', 'lovers', 'get', 'together', 'What', 'accused', 'murderers', 'homosexuality', 'have', 'do', 'story', 'get', 'off', 'think', 'stories', 'subject', 'matter', 'very', 'strong', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'focused', 'temptation', 'guilt', 'wayward', 'priest', 'less', 'solving', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'murderwhich', 'cop', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'only', 'took', 'priest', 'ex-girlfriend', '2', 'scenes', 'solve', 'Good', 'watch', 'TLJ', 'fan', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'overall']",Broken Vows VHS

390774,A3ELSU1SHRX09Y,6303937497,skunktrain,"[8, 9]","I liked this film. However, I can see why it might offend some devout Catholics.  So - if you are a devout Catholic, you have been warned.It has a quiet way about it, as it leisurely goes through the story of this gentle priest, coming to a crossroads of his life. It is more character oriented - it's not an ""action"" film, or really even a ""mystery"" film (even though the murder mystery is what moves the plot along).Supporting actors are great - and there is a wonderful jazz score by Charles Gross. Check out actor David Straithairn (sp?) in a small part (as the murder victim) in the beginning of the film. Other familiar faces will crop up as well, like Frances Fisher, (the mom in ""Titanic"").This is a definite departure from the Tommy Lee Jones we have all become used to (in the '90s and beyond). If you are a big Jones fan (like I am) you might want to see this film.I also wanted to point out: a previous reviewer was confused about many facets to this story.  The murder mystery *is* solved, there is nothing ambiguous about it.  (...)Just enjoy the movie - all will be revealed.",4,Excellent early Tommy Lee Jones effort.,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,1090,"['liked', 'film', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'might', 'offend', 'devout', 'Catholics', 'So', 'are', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'have', 'been', 'warned.It', 'quiet', 'way', 'leisurely', 'story', 'gentle', 'priest', 'coming', 'crossroads', 'life', 'more', 'character', 'oriented', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'really', 'even', 'mystery', 'film', 'even', 'murder', 'mystery', 'what', 'plot', '.Supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'wonderful', 'jazz', 'score', 'Charles', 'Gross', 'Check', 'out', 'actor', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'sp', 'small', 'part', 'murder', 'victim', 'beginning', 'film', 'Other', 'familiar', 'will', 'crop', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'Frances', 'Fisher', 'mom', 'Titanic', '.This', 'definite', 'departure', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'have', 'become', 'used', ""'90s"", 'are', 'big', 'Jones', 'fan', 'am', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'film.I', 'also', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'was', 'confused', 'about', 'many', 'facets', 'story', 'murder', 'mystery', '*is*', 'solved', 'nothing', 'ambiguous', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'revealed']",Broken Vows VHS
