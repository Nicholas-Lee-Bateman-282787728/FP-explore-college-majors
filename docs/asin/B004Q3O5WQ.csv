Successful newlywed couple boards a geeky friend who hooks up with a hot babe.  The hot babe is using the geek to get closer to the newlywed male who is also fairly geeky and break up his marriage with his wife who is pretty much of a bee-otch.  The hottie is psycho, has killed before, and seems to enjoy doing it.  Except for the poor cat, there is nothing really great or moving about this lousy, predictable film.  The fact that none of the actors is recognizable should also give you a clue as to just how bad it is.  Thankfully, the movie is short.  Unfortunately, it seems like it goes on forever.  You've already seen a million versions of Fatal Attraction, so why subject yourself to one of the worst?

1423895,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,B004Q3O5WQ,rareoopdvds,"[1, 1]","The setup is simple: two newlyweds, Mitch and Jen (Welzbacher and Prikyl) bought a house they cannot afford, so they offer a room to rent for Mitch's college buddy Danny (Lusk). He moves in and things are fun for the two guys while Jen gets her dream kitchen (she is a chef). Danny, who is looking for a girlfriend decides to go online for a date and suddenly, a hot young tramp Blair shows up in the scene.That was about the first 15 minutes. It pretty much makes no sense from here on out. The first actions and words uttered by Blair, and you already know where the movie is going. Her motives are so transparent, why no one in the film picked this up is a remarkable feat of creating the stupidest characters ever committed to film.The simple fact that Danny never checked to see if it was ok to have guests come over or stay the night. This might be forgivable on the premise that he pays rent, so should be somewhat privileged, but at least pre-empt the owners of the house, no? Wheres the common courtesy? The following morning, Blair is cooking breakfast for everyone in frilly panties. Why does Jen not say anything? Like ""get dressed please?!"" So in the course of the next 30-45 minutes, we are treated to two of the most spineless homeowners I have ever seen. Not only do neither of them take ownership of their home, but they let her do whatever she wants at any given moment. To the point that Mitch even invites her to stay at the house (I will spare the spoilers for just that sake).Jen has half a brain. But thats it. Mitch might have the other half. Together, however, there is still something not whole. Anytime Mitch is in Blair's presence, he looks like suddenly goes into a trance, as if Blair is a witch. And I dont mean that in a descriptive way. I think if Blair just asked for the keys to the house, she would have saved everyone a world of trouble because Mitch and Jen would have probably just handed them over.There are so many problems in this story, but the basic fact that the Mitch and Jen are so permissive lets them get whats coming to them.I gave it two stars as I thought the production values were pretty good for this kind of film. The acting flails between decent to terrible. The general tension and directing is competent. If the director has a better script and actors with the same budget, perhaps something better would have shown up.",2,"Sure Thing, You Want My House?

1423897,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004Q3O5WQ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[4, 4]","The main problem I have with this movie is the plot spoilers. The movie starts out with kids playing in a nice neighborhood with ominous music playing in the background while an unseen person is washing blood off a rather large kitchen knife. We then regress 3 months. The review compares this to Roommate and Hand that Rocks the Cradle as the DVD box shows us a female in shorts holding a bloody knife behind her back. So we already know the plot and the killer is Blair (Mayra Leal), that is if your IQ is high enough to make an ""X"" for your name.Our happy young suburban couple Mitch and Jen (Craig Welzbacher and Sarah Prikryl), invite portly college buddy Danny (Matt Lusk) to live with them. Danny meets a girl, Blair, on the Internet who is too good to be true, especially one who jumps into bed with a dweeb like Danny on first meeting. Jen clearly doesn't like her and suspects something isn't right. Mitch can't take his eyes off her panty clad butt. Mitch is a successful surgeon who has a nice home living the American Dream and has all the stress to go with it. Jen works constantly as a chef and doesn't have the time to take care of her man and now has competition in her own home. Do we have enough stress yet? From a writers point of view I think Myra plays her hand too soon with her snarky remarks.Not as good as other movies in this genre.  I find it hard to believe that someone as fine looking as Myra has a hard time finding someone who owns a nice home with a pool. My cat has stopped sleeping in her box.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Mayra Leal who Graduated from the University of Houston with a bachelor's degree in Advertising/Public Relations with a Minor in Mathematics in 2009 can only find work exposing herself in ""B"" movies.)",3,I LOVE YOUR HOUSE,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,1750,"['main', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'movie', 'out', 'kids', 'playing', 'nice', 'neighborhood', 'ominous', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'unseen', 'person', 'washing', 'blood', 'rather', 'large', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'then', 'regress', '3', 'months', 'review', 'Roommate', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'DVD', 'box', 'female', 'shorts', 'holding', 'bloody', 'knife', 'back', 'already', 'know', 'plot', 'killer', 'Blair', 'Mayra', 'Leal', 'IQ', 'high', 'enough', 'make', 'X', 'name.Our', 'happy', 'young', 'suburban', 'couple', 'Mitch', 'Jen', 'Craig', 'Welzbacher', 'Sarah', 'Prikryl', 'invite', 'portly', 'college', 'buddy', 'Danny', 'Matt', 'Lusk', 'live', 'Danny', 'girl', 'Blair', 'Internet', 'who', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'bed', 'dweeb', 'Danny', 'first', 'meeting', 'Jen', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'like', 'suspects', 'something', ""n't"", 'right', 'Mitch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'panty', 'clad', 'butt', 'Mitch', 'successful', 'surgeon', 'who', 'nice', 'home', 'living', 'American', 'Dream', 'stress', 'go', 'Jen', 'constantly', 'chef', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'take', 'care', 'man', 'now', 'competition', 'own', 'home', 'Do', 'have', 'enough', 'stress', 'yet', 'writers', 'point', 'view', 'think', 'Myra', 'hand', 'too', 'soon', 'snarky', 'remarks.Not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'someone', 'fine', 'looking', 'Myra', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'someone', 'who', 'nice', 'home', 'pool', 'cat', 'stopped', 'sleeping', 'box.F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Mayra', 'Leal', 'who', 'Graduated', 'University', 'Houston', 'bachelor', 'degree', 'Advertising/Public', 'Relations', 'Minor', 'Mathematics', '2009', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'work', 'exposing', 'B', 'movies']",Playing House

High production values, great casting, good script, superb acting.It's a fairly typical premise I suppose--newly-married couple (Sarah Prikryl and Craig Wezelbacher) has friend of groom (Matt Lusk) move in to offset expenses; he hooks up with a mysterious smoking-hot girl (Mayra Leal) whom he met online. The four major players all perform admirably, Lusk a bit behind the other three and Prikryl without question the best of the four. Never have heard of any of these newcomers but they all know what they're doing in their parts. Despite being lustily gorgeous, Leal is great--in that she at the same time both creeps you out and turns you on. She's got some real acting chops and isn't there just to get naked. She does (FINALLY), but it fits well  within the script and doesn't at all feel gratuitous.There also is a fantastic turn by Shelley Calene-Black as a private investigator.

1423899,A7D607LPOKWYD,B004Q3O5WQ,TJ Brown,"[0, 0]","No apologies, I really liked this one. Never been a fan of the ""slasher movie""  but I think I would be if Mayra Leal was doing the slashing in them.I can get on board with the litany of complaints regarding this film sprinkled throughout the reviews - clunky acting, quite the predictable plot and result, the outlandishly unrealistic behaviors of the characters involved.  But that said it flowed fine, I had a good time, and it did not overstay its welcome. I'll admit to adding an extra star cause Mayra Leal was holding the knife and not some sort of handyman called in to fix the roof, but I did like this overall. And in the end I found myself rooting for who i was supposed to be rooting for, which is an accomplishment as for most of the movie I wanted the innocent to suffer.This was harmless fun and I would watch it again and share it with others, but more cause it was a sorta campy without trying to be campy slasher flick with a stunner up to all kinds of no good than cause it was a gripping and tense thriller. Though at times there were elements of that too.So dont go in expecting too much - not sure how you would, considering the package and description of things - and you just may enjoy the watch.

1423900,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B004Q3O5WQ,Tony Heck,"[1, 3]","""I really do love you house, it's amazing. I want it.""  When newlyweds Mitch (Welzbacher) and Jen buy thier first house they have trouble paying the mortgage.  After asking Mitch's best friend Danny to move in they think they will have the time of thier lives.  When Danny brings home new girl friend Blair (Leal), the lives of all take a drastic turn.  This is a strange movie to review.  The movie itself is actually pretty good and makes you feel tense almost all the way through.  The Blair character is very creepy (think of Sharron Stone is basic instinct, but more psycho.)  One huge problem with the movie is that the acting is so bad that it almost distracts from the movie.  Some of the scenes are a little over the top, but they fit the movie.  For a B rate horror movie with no known actors this is actually a pretty pleasent surprise, just don't expect to see them in a lot of stuff (I wouldn't be surprised to see the girl playing Blair to be on an MTV reality show though, she is a few steps above the ""Jersey Shore"" but definate ""Real World"" material.)  Overall if you can get past the acting this is actually a very good thriller, one of the better ones in a while.  I give it a B- (the - because of the acting).Would I watch it again? - I don't think I will.*Also try - Basic Instinct & The Roommate",4,A surprisingly good and tense thriller.
