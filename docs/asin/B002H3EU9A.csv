I think he brought the movie down instead of enhanced it.And though I am familiar with and like most of the cast this movie could have been way better.... The writing, the plot, even the dancing was kind of weak.Personally I think some of the beginning weeks of dancing with the stars are more entertaining than this whole movie.

I agree that the story line is very typical, BUT I thought the movie was enjoyable to watch. The acting was fine, the characters likable. It is abit unfortunate that competition dancers were portrayed as so idiosyncratic, but the inclusion of complete dance segments more then made up for that.If you enjoy watching dance movies and love Ballroom and/or west coast swing this is really worth buying.
