I wasn't expecting LORD OF THE RINGS here, or even DRAGON SLAYER, so I entered with low expectations.Some people think video games are better forms of entertainment and artistic expression than films. I'm not sympathetic to this view. Anyone who claims this is simply expressing an ignorant and sophomoric mentality. But watching BEOWULF I would say that sometimes a video game can be ""better"" than the movie. These days the line between some movies and video games strictly in terms of visual style has been erased. I don't care that much for the look of BEOWULF, but by video game standards it's cool. It's plastic and feels incomplete. The nerds that crafted the digital picture did do a decent job of fleshing out Angelina Jolie, however. I want to say I have seen this style of animation done better elsewhere, but where I can't recall. I think a traditional style of animation would have served this classic mythological tale much better. I give them credit for the generous helpings of blood and guts and some of the earthy depictions of people in the Dark Ages.

King Hrothgar speaks to his thanes and throws coins to his men to celebrate the victory and share the loot. Suddenly a wind blows out the lights. A monster invades the room to attack and kill the warriors. ""What was that?"" ""Grendel."" How can they rid themselves of this monster? A ship lands on the shore. Beowulf and his men have come to kill the monster. Others have tried and failed. The king offers a gold horn as a reward for killing Grendel.There is a knock at the door. Grendel bursts in and begins to kill the warriors. Beowulf finds a weak spot, then tears off an arm. Is this the end of Grendel? The fallen warriors are put in a barge and pushed out to sea. But Grendel's mother takes her revenge on the men. Beowulf is given an ancestral sword to slay the monster. The glow of the gold horn lights the way. What does Grendel's mother offer to Beowulf? Beowulf returns without the sword and the gold horn. King Hrothgar declares Beowulf to be his heir. Time passes, Beowulf wins battles but ages. One day the lost gold horn is found in an unholy place. What does it mean?Then a dragon attacks a village and burns it. Beowulf and his warriors must defend the land. Beowulf goes to the dragon's lair.

J Velarde,"[0, 0]","Beowulf is a great movie, I think it's the future of animation, when I saw this on the big screen I was blown away with this movie, great scenes and from time to time you forgot you were watching an animated movie.Using the same technique as in ""The Polar Express"" but better, director Robert Zemeckis capture the live performance of actors like Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright Penn and Angelina Jolie among others. On the movie ""Polar Express"" it was a bummer seeing Tom Hanks on almost every scene, here we enjoy a really good movie done in a proper way.The script is good, but the visuals is what captures you from the start.However my complain is on the extras, there are a lot of featurettes, some are very interesting, even if they are really short. The problem is a movie like this deserves commentary from the director which is nowhere to be found. Also there is little input on how Angelina Jolie delivered such a powerful character as Grendel's mother.There are deleted scenes, but they are more like incomplete scenes with no texture. I think it was kinda rip off.This DVD claims it has more intense scenes not seen in theaters, but the scenes are inserted on the full movie, there is no option to see the theatrical release and the director's cut, you only guess there are more scenes on there but you aren't really not sure because there are no commentaries.Buy it for the movie itself, still delivers !",4,Great movie.

Having read the epic poem myself I was impressed by this cinematic retelling. I didn't see it in the theater, so my review is of the director's cut. It is funny how some reviewers write about the destruction, or dishonor that this version does to the classic. I disagree. This postmodern version of the story makes explicit everything that is implicit in the actual text. The sins of the father theme is elevated to the foreground of the narrative. The flawed character of the hero is very well defined and serves the purpose of the story, illuminating the actual text for me. The seductive qualities of Grendel's mother were well served by the figure of the very sexy Jolie. The pathetic and sympathetic portrayal of Grendel was the best part. The CGI was great except for the facial expressions. They were a bit restrained, almost wooden. It is very much like Miller's 300. I think it would have been better had there been live actors mixed in with the CGI like in 300.

1126159,A10UGG54QNH71L,B0010V5SW8,"Alex S ""Blurb""","[4, 6]","It's not surprising that ""Beowulf"" is infused with a healthy dose of sarcasm. After all, the screenplay is written by Neil Gaiman (the sly English fantasy writer of the cult fave ""Sandman"" graphic novels) and Roger Avary (co-writer of ""Pulp Fiction""). To expect a straightforward narrative from them is like adding E to your girlfriend's drink and then expecting her to act normal in front of your parents.  Throw in director Robert Zemeckis to the combination (he of ""Roger Rabbit"" and ""Back to the Future"" fame), and there's no way things can go wrong, right?Almost. Apart from the subtle mockery of the fantasy genre and the 'heroic quest' staple that runs through ""Beowulf""'s plot (the hero proclaims numerous times, in a gruff voice, flexing his biceps, that he is Beowulf, ""here to kill your mon-stah"" - the irony is evident), there's unfortunately not that much originality in the film. Once I realized, half-way through it, that the story wasn't going to expand beyond its 700 A.D. source's - the poem's - limitations, I got a bit depressed.  The self-aware winks certainly enliven the material, but there's no escaping the fact that it's a straightforward, simple tale, no matter how hard one tries to spice it up visually.That's not to say ""Beowulf"" isn't worth a look. It's got spectacular eye-candy. The people look much more realistic than they did in the uncanny ""Polar Express"". Several sequences particularly stun with the wild imagination on display: the heroic Geatsman defending King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) Danish court from the horrific mon-stah Grendel (Crispin Glover); fighting off mon-stahs of the sea; encountering the sexy mon-stah that looks just like Angelina Jolie... with a tail, and heels instead of feet; or fighting off a mon-stah dragon at the end (I clearly love saying mon-stah).I liked the ferocity with which the film plunges into its gratuitous violence (the MPAA has got to be crazy to give this film the PG-13 stamp: limbs are flying all over the place!) I liked the gloomy, ancient tone. I liked how Beowulf is ultimately portrayed as a man as weak as the rest of us, letting his horniness overshadow the stoic bravery, surrendering to Angie's sexuality. The satire is all Gaiman, the mixture of humor and violence is pure Avary.And yet, despite all the bombast, ""Beowulf"" left me unfulfilled. Perhaps it's because of my affinity towards the writers (Gaiman in particular), and the fact that my expectations were so high. I remember reading an article, in which Gaiman remarked upon his conversation with Zemeckis. It went something like this: Gaiman wasn't sure whether to include a super-expensive sequence in the script. He called Zemeckis, who told him to go ahead and write whatever he wanted, because there was nothing that could cost more than $1 mil. a minute to shoot.Maybe it's the money that got to them. So pumped by the opportunity to impress visually, it's almost like they forgot that there has to be a truly spectacular story to supplement the top-notch imagery.",3,I... AM...

Sure, it's a cartoon, but it's so much more than just a cartoon.  I personally enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  Yes, it's campy but intentionally so, and yes it is a bit extreme, but that's where all the fun lies.  I will admit that I totally prefer my actors in live action mode, and I would have loved to see this `in living color' so-to-speak.  I think that all the actors used are talented and would have done a phenomenal job in their respective roles.  Ray Winstone is a brilliant actor, even if he is not widely known, and while he is not physically a specimen like that of Beowulf (he's more on the `beefy' side) I still would have loved to see him take it on in the flesh.I am dying now to get my hands on the actual poem.The film follows the warrior Beowulf as he slaughters the monster known as Grendel, a monster that proved to be a curse for King Hrothgar.  When Beowulf attempts to kill Grendal's revenge seeking mother he is seduced by her beauty and falls captive to her curse.  That curse follows Beowulf well into his rule as King and serves as the catalyst for a most epic battle that pits father against son.I can't say that I'm fresh on all the details of the poem that spawned this film, I still need to watch this a couple more times and, as I mentioned, get my hands on the classic itself, but I can say that it is a most interesting story indeed.  Director Robert Zemeckis delivers a solid action adventure film that is thrilling as much as it is entertaining.  The battle scenes are memorable and engrossing, especially the final dragon battle that is nothing short of mesmerizing.  Beowulf's battle with Grendal is done well also, even if it recalls certain comical moments from `Austin Powers'.The acting is decent, as decent as can be expected.  The only actor who is really required to do much acting at all is Winstone, and he pulls his weight.  Angelina Jolie dons that horrible accent from `Alexander' once again, but she's only on the screen twice and both times you won't be listening to the words coming out of her mouth.  Anthony Hopkins does a mean drunk, and John Malkovich is funny as the bitter Unferth.  Robin Wright Penn is a little dead and fails to really deliver anything close to a performance here.  It's hard to judge since the film is, in the end, a cartoon.  While the eyes are undoubtedly human the facial expressions are one-note most of the time.  `Ratatouille' is a better example of expressive animation.In the end ""Beowulf' is a lot of fun even if it isn't perfection.  I rather enjoyed the campiness of the film; I thought it added a comical edge I wasn't expecting.  This is not a film for children by any means.  It is littered with gore, nudity and innuendos.  I'm floored it remained PG-13 and it truly pushes the boundaries to an extreme.  For you adults though, `Beowulf' is where you should look for a guilt free (or is it guilty) good time.",4,A guilty pleasure that embraces its camp and delivers the goods...,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,3089,"['was', 'excited', 'seeing', 'movie', 'while', 'so', 'was', 'released', 'friends', 'decided', 'call', 'guy', 'night', 'throw', 'back', 'beers', 'watch', 'Beowulf', 'Sure', 'cartoon', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'cartoon', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'Yes', 'campy', 'intentionally', 'so', 'yes', 'bit', 'extreme', 'where', 'fun', 'will', 'admit', 'totally', 'prefer', 'actors', 'live', 'action', 'mode', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'living', 'color', 'so-to-speak', 'think', 'actors', 'used', 'are', 'talented', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'even', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'not', 'physically', 'specimen', 'Beowulf', 'more', 'beefy', 'side', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'take', 'flesh.I', 'am', 'dying', 'now', 'get', 'hands', 'actual', 'poem.The', 'film', 'warrior', 'Beowulf', 'monster', 'known', 'Grendel', 'monster', 'proved', 'be', 'curse', 'King', 'Hrothgar', 'When', 'Beowulf', 'kill', 'Grendal', 'revenge', 'seeking', 'mother', 'seduced', 'beauty', 'captive', 'curse', 'curse', 'Beowulf', 'well', 'rule', 'King', 'catalyst', 'most', 'epic', 'battle', 'father', 'son.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'fresh', 'details', 'poem', 'spawned', 'film', 'still', 'need', 'watch', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'mentioned', 'get', 'hands', 'classic', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'interesting', 'story', 'indeed', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'solid', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'thrilling', 'as', 'much', 'entertaining', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'memorable', 'engrossing', 'especially', 'final', 'dragon', 'battle', 'nothing', 'short', 'mesmerizing', 'Beowulf', 'battle', 'Grendal', 'done', 'well', 'also', 'even', 'certain', 'comical', 'moments', 'Austin', ""Powers'.The"", 'acting', 'decent', 'as', 'decent', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'required', 'do', 'much', 'acting', 'Winstone', 'weight', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'horrible', 'accent', 'Alexander', 'once', 'again', 'only', 'screen', 'twice', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'listening', 'words', 'coming', 'mouth', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'mean', 'drunk', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'funny', 'bitter', 'Unferth', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'little', 'dead', 'really', 'deliver', 'anything', 'close', 'performance', 'here', 'hard', 'judge', 'film', 'end', 'cartoon', 'eyes', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'human', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'one-note', 'most', 'time', 'Ratatouille', 'better', 'example', 'expressive', 'end', 'Beowulf', 'lot', 'fun', 'even', ""n't"", 'perfection', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'campiness', 'film', 'thought', 'added', 'comical', 'edge', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'not', 'film', 'children', 'means', 'littered', 'gore', 'nudity', 'innuendos', ""'m"", 'floored', 'remained', 'PG-13', 'truly', 'boundaries', 'extreme', 'adults', 'Beowulf', 'where', 'should', 'look', 'guilt', 'free', 'guilty', 'good', 'time']",N/A

The suits are quite curious, the scanning sessions, the magnificent concept art, etc. The only extras that aren't that interesting are the cut scenes (they don't add a lot to the story and they are in an embrionary state of imaging development).Why didn't I gave it a 5 star rating?Although I understand the concept of adaptation, this one went a little to far (SPOILER WARNING):Beowulf King of the Danes???

1126173,A1RVYSEJCY9BJS,B0010V5SW8,A. Thomas,"[3, 3]","""We men are the monsters now.""Robert Zemeckis's ""Beowulf"" has, I think, been grossly misunderstood. The popular consensus appears to be that it is another mo-cap failure, all exaggerated, adolescent, computer-generated violence with zero substance. While the film certainly has its flaws, the visual effects techniques employed to create it have apparently blinded many to its rather clever deconstruction of the Beowulf story.Now, it's inarguable that the original poem is a treasured literary classic, but what some of the more ""academic"" reviews either don't seem to grasp or conveniently choose to ignore is that the poem is over a thousand years old and is an entirely different medium to the modern blockbuster; literature is an individual experience, interpreted through the prism of the reader's - or listener's, if hearing an oration - imagination while film is a defined, temporal experience intended for a mass audience. What works in one can be disastrous in another.The key obstacle in adapting ""Beowulf"" is the narrative structure. The story is split between three battles: Grendel, Grendel's mother, and the Dragon. Classical three-act structure, you say? Not quite. There's a fifty year gap between the last two acts. Furthermore, Beowulf himself is a static character, an idealized hero without flaw. These present no real issue in poetic verse, but in a film that is expected to flow smoothly from narrative point A to narrative point B in two hours or less, a static protagonist will bore the audience and such an enormous time shift will seem unjustified.Therefore, writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary strove to accomplish with their adaptation what any good adaptation ought to do -- find a new reason to tell this ancient tale. They asked questions: why won't Grendel attack Hrothgar? Because no one else actually saw what happened in the cave with Grendel's mother, what if what Beowulf recited isn't the truth? These questions led to a deconstruction of the original narrative where Beowulf is an unreliable narrator and he and the characters suffer from the all-too human traits of greed, pride, lust, and envy. Now, the long gap between the final acts is motivated through exploring Beowulf's regret at the decisions he's made in his life that now tie into the confrontation with the Dragon. The conceit is that this version is the ""original"" version of the story before it became what we now know in the poem.The beauty of this conceit is that it makes the nature of storytelling itself one of the film's themes. Beowulf is presented as an exaggerating braggart and even an outright liar concerning his early exploits. After Beowulf is crowned and they perform his ""song"" decades later, the depiction of Grendel's disarming corresponds to the bare-handed version in the original poem and not the mechanically-assisted version we saw take place earlier in the film; the story has evolved to be bolder and more heroic than the reality. The implication is that this same change has happened to the rest of the story over time, the character's flaws were lost and he became the idealized hero of the poem. (This is also hinted at the film's treatment of Christianity as a rising religion among a rowdy pagan culture, closer to historical reality of the time the poem is set, while the poem of course portrays its heroes as good Christian men.)The introduction of character flaws into the narrative provides room for character development and greater psychological reality over the course of the film narrative, but it also ties into the theme of storytelling and sets up the ambiguous ending, which I won't spoil here. Why do we tell the stories of heroes such as Beowulf? Why are they so idealized? The answer is so that we mere mortals may be inspired by these stories to overcome our flaws, to avoid the mistakes of the past, and to hope for a better future. This is the position that Wiglaf (and the audience) is left in at the end of the film: is he doomed to succumb to temptation and corruption like those who came before him, or can the tale and memory of those such as Beowulf give him the strength and courage to resist?It's a new and interesting layer to the story, providing greater dimension and expressing an interesting, meta-textual perspective on the poem - a companion, not a replacement. There's more to cover here - too much, really - but hopefully it's apparent that there is indeed more to this film than what meets the eye.Is the film a masterpiece? No. For all the intelligent choices made in the adaptation, the execution seems a bit off. Post-""300"", the soundtrack is sprinkled with distorted electric guitar riffs to let the teenage boys know that, no, really, this story is COOL. During Beowulf's fight with Grendel, the constant and convenient coverage of his genitals quickly becomes an annoying joke. The animation, while often breathtakingly detailed and beautiful, occasionally looks dull and lifeless; the heightened realism of the motion-capture movements highlights some of the faults of the rendered character designs and lighting. Lastly, while going all-digital has freed up Zemeckis's camera to create some mind-bogglingly creative and awesome shots, he does have a tendency to go over-the-top and his direction calls attention to itself; a tad more restraint could have made this film a classic. As is, it's solid entertainment.The Blu-ray itself showcases exemplary picture and sound, as well as a couple of hours of documentaries and deleted scenes, all presented in high definition. It's not a Criterion-worthy package, but it gets the job done and is worthwhile.If you can accept that the poem is the poem and the film is the film, this disc is highly recommended.",4,Absolutely NOT

If it were a normal movie taking place in Viking society with characters named other names and they ended it this way, that would be great; but once again someone had to go take a perfectly good classic and use the ""brand name"" to sell a story that bore only loose relation to the original tale.

1126175,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B0010V5SW8,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[1, 1]","This is not Beowulf, the classic poem which has been so beautifully translated by Seamus Heaney - or written for children by Michael Morpunga (sp) - however as a version of Beowulf displaying the strength, bravado, and weaknesses of Beowulf and the grim nature of Danish and Geat kingdoms, this is an extraodinary telling.I wondered how much Neil Gaiman had in the telling - certainly through Zemeckis, this version has a great deal of humanity, as well as humour. I really enjoyed it as arip roaring tale. I certainly wouldn't have bothered watching it at all if I hadn't caught part of it on the telly - after that I had to seek out the DVD.I thought the animation would be distracting, and it does have a flatness to it - but it also allows the telling of the story with its fantasy elements, to develop beautifully.In this version the boastful, strong but hearty Beowulf is travelling from Geatland to the Danish kingdom of Hrothgar's where the meadhall Heoror has been plagued by a Hell-born monster - Grendel. For 14 years Grendel has ruled the hall and the land of the Danes by night. Hrothgar, an old king with a young wife, has had no answer to it.In the early stages Beowulf boasts of his feats of strength - killing sea monsters and so on - and his crew and men mock him but not to his face. In fact Beowulf, like many egotists seems completely ignorant of their laughter and their inside knowledge that his boasts are inflated.Key elements in the story are changed. Grendel is altered from a Hell-born beast intent on destroying pleasure, happiness and all that is good and essentially godly - he is a simple creature - he seems to be simply motivated by hunger and simple stupidity rather than hate.Beowulf defeats him, naked - and the scenes leading up to the fight are some of the most hilarious - with handily placed drinking cups and so on to conceal his anatomy - a bit reminscent of Austin Powers movies.After the defeat the movie departs from the original story of Beowulf almost completely. However the re=written story has an immensely powerful theme - and is very reminiscent of King Arthur tales, of weakness and power. Interesting that both Arthur and Beowulf are similar in time, set around the 5th and 6th centuries. Now the King Hrothgar kills himself and Beowulf takes over the kingdom - yet you see that his fate begins to echo that of Hrothgar's.The question of what or who is Grendel and his mother - and how did they get there is answered in this story - and the Mallory 'Wheel of time' style telling of the story brings things into a full cycle. It is a very clever motif and development.The actors used for the characters, Ray Winstone, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich especially do an extraodinary job - and the animation was extremely well done.I am really in awe of this movie.

An even more realistic Hrothgar voiced by Anthony Hopkins (Bobby). John Malkovich (Burn After Reading) as Unferth. Ray Winstone (The Departed) as the dominating Beowulf. And the sexiest woman alive, Angelina Jolie (Wanted) as Grendel's deceptive mother. I mean, what a cast! This is what great films are made of. And the realism of the computer animation in terms of how they resembled the actual actors was astonishing ...which begged a pretty big question: WHY NOT SIMPLY FILM BEOWULF WITH LIVE ACTION AND NOT ANIMATION?!Cost was probably an issue, but with the $150 million budget I think they could've done a fine live action film. In 2005 Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarson proved it could be done with his very nicely doneBeowulf & Grendelstarring Gerard Butler (300). With comparable run times (103 minutes to 114 minutes) and Beowulf & Grendel's much lower budget (I believe it was around $75 million), it can be done and done well if you have the inclination. But, for whatever reason, director Robert Zemeckis (Monster House) decided to shoot it this way.It may sound as if I'm bashing animated films in general, which I'm not. There are some really great ones out there (Finding Nemo,Hoodwinked, etc.), so animation can be pulled off if care is taken to present it as such. But with Beowulf, it seems they were trying to mix live action with animation in order to produce some sort of hybrid ...which simply didn't work for me. It might for some and that's fine, but, if you're going to show realistic characters that look like the actual actors, why not simply do live action? It's so maddening!It was nice, however, to see some care taken with the source material (namely Neil Gaiman's reimagining of the epic poem by the same name). Beowulf had some shady dealings and it was refreshing to see this brought out in the story and not simply showing him as some flawless hero.Still, if you're into animation, this one might not work for you.

Mine is Strength... and Lust... and Power! I AM BEOWULF!Easily the best line from a movie that I can remember and this is one of the many reasons why I gave this film a 5 star rating.For those who aren't familiar with the notion of Beowulf, let me fill you in and give you the lowdown of where it all came from. Beowulf is an epic poem without an author, thought to have been written some time between the 8th and the 11th Century. The story of the film seems to follow the poem quite accurately but I must be honest that I haven't read the full poem myself.The Movie: Beowulf, an arrogant man who is known as the hero of Geats, comes to defend a Danish mead hall from a relentless monster known by them as Grendel. Grendel is a 20 foot tall beast that can be described only as a freak of nature and after killing most of Beowulfs most loyal men Beowulf manages to take down the monster. After the battle Beowulf questions the king about Grendels father who the king says ""you wont have to worry about the father"" it is Grendels mother who he must now go after to free the kingdom of its curse. When Beowulf finds the lair of Grendels mother we learn she is a temptress who uses her sexual seduction and god like beauty to tempt Beowulf with a bargain he can't refuse. Give me another son and I will make you king.Foreword a few years and we are shown a very different Beowulf, he is beaten and broken, he has lost all excitement from the battles and challenges he faced before he was king. We see him confronted by an enemy soldier who challenges Beowulf to a fight, Beowulf confronts this soldier and tells him ""You can't kill me, I'm already dead.""The Review: At the risk of telling you too much, I will stop there but let me tell you what I thought of the movie. This is made entirely in CG which I found unbelievable to say the least as this is once again a leap ahead in this type of animation. At times I felt myself questioning whether they had filmed some parts in live action and had animated the CG around it. I was shocked to find out that, no this film is 100% CGI and it truly is spectacular although at times a let down. There are parts where you think ""Wow that has to be real"" but then there are parts where you say to yourself ""Oh Come On that just looks stupid."" Blended together however the scenes do work well.The voice cast is amazing. Ray Winstone, who delivered the best line in the movie (Shown Above) Anthony Hopkins & Angelina Jolie are just 3 huge names that lend their voices to this film. I have a sneaky feeling also that Angelina may have lent a bit more to this movie than just her voice.This is a surprisingly good movie that seemed to have a bit more emotion in it than I had expected, and the inclusion of what seemed to be excerpts from the original poem into the script, made it all the more special.Overall a brilliant movie and although my review refers to the Blu-Ray version which isn't available in the US just yet I would still recommend you get it. If you wait for the Blu-Ray version however, you will enjoy it that little bit more.",5,Cool!!!,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,3179,"['am', 'Ripper', 'Tearer', 'Slasher', 'Gouger', 'am', 'Teeth', 'Darkness', 'Talons', 'Night', 'Mine', 'Strength', 'Lust', 'Power', 'AM', 'BEOWULF', 'Easily', 'best', 'line', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'gave', 'film', '5', 'star', 'rating.For', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'notion', 'Beowulf', 'let', 'fill', 'give', 'lowdown', 'where', 'came', 'Beowulf', 'epic', 'poem', 'author', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'time', '8th', '11th', 'Century', 'story', 'film', 'follow', 'poem', 'quite', 'accurately', 'must', 'be', 'honest', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'full', 'poem', 'myself.The', 'Movie', 'Beowulf', 'arrogant', 'man', 'who', 'known', 'hero', 'Geats', 'defend', 'Danish', 'mead', 'hall', 'relentless', 'monster', 'known', 'Grendel', 'Grendel', '20', 'foot', 'tall', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'only', 'freak', 'nature', 'killing', 'most', 'Beowulfs', 'most', 'loyal', 'men', 'Beowulf', 'take', 'down', 'monster', 'battle', 'Beowulf', 'questions', 'king', 'Grendels', 'father', 'who', 'king', 'wont', 'have', 'worry', 'father', 'Grendels', 'mother', 'who', 'must', 'now', 'go', 'free', 'kingdom', 'curse', 'When', 'Beowulf', 'lair', 'Grendels', 'mother', 'learn', 'temptress', 'who', 'sexual', 'seduction', 'god', 'beauty', 'tempt', 'Beowulf', 'bargain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'Give', 'son', 'will', 'make', 'king.Foreword', 'few', 'years', 'are', 'shown', 'very', 'different', 'Beowulf', 'beaten', 'broken', 'lost', 'excitement', 'battles', 'challenges', 'faced', 'was', 'king', 'see', 'confronted', 'enemy', 'soldier', 'who', 'Beowulf', 'fight', 'Beowulf', 'soldier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', ""'m"", 'already', 'dead', 'Review', 'risk', 'telling', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'stop', 'there', 'let', 'tell', 'what', 'thought', 'movie', 'made', 'entirely', 'CG', 'found', 'unbelievable', 'say', 'least', 'once', 'again', 'leap', 'ahead', 'type', 'animation', 'times', 'felt', 'questioning', 'had', 'filmed', 'parts', 'live', 'action', 'had', 'animated', 'CG', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'film', '100', '%', 'CGI', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'times', 'let', 'down', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'think', 'Wow', 'be', 'real', 'then', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'say', 'yourself', 'Oh', 'Come', 'just', 'stupid', 'Blended', 'together', 'however', 'scenes', 'do', 'work', 'well.The', 'voice', 'cast', 'amazing', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'who', 'delivered', 'best', 'line', 'movie', 'Shown', 'Above', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'are', 'just', '3', 'huge', 'names', 'lend', 'voices', 'film', 'have', 'sneaky', 'feeling', 'also', 'Angelina', 'may', 'have', 'lent', 'bit', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'voice.This', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'emotion', 'had', 'expected', 'inclusion', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'excerpts', 'original', 'poem', 'script', 'made', 'more', 'special.Overall', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'review', 'refers', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', ""n't"", 'available', 'US', 'just', 'yet', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'get', 'wait', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'however', 'will', 'enjoy', 'little', 'bit', 'more']",N/A

Mom""","[0, 0]","This definitely not the early proto-English epic Beowulf that featured somewhere during the first couple of weeks of my ""Intro to English Literature Part 1"" course that I remember from yea these many years ago; the one that covered everything up to about the 18th Century. And it is not quite as risible as it appeared from the movie trailer - I mean, a daemonic Angelina Jolie,  starkers and rising from the depths of a subterranean pool and seducing Ray Winstone as he undoubtedly wishes he was? No, this is not what I remember from sophomore English Lit, but it's not half bad, considered on its own terms. Visually, this is as different a movie as just about anything recently produced for the big screen; it's what a video game, or a graphic novel would look like, if the producer only had an unlimited budget. And it does work, briskly paced and imaginatively staged - this may be the future of a certain sort of fantasy movie, generating an elaborate, consistent and richly detailed `look' and special effects from a computer program, rather than from matte paintings, painted cheesecloth and sculptured Styrofoam. It's not anything like this - but it will pass a Saturday evening as well as much else and probably better than most, especially of your household contains teenage males. Amazingly, Neil Gaiman had much to do with this, as a writer. This is the second film he has scripted that I have watched and reviewed lately and enjoyed- much  against initial expectations. If a coincidence, make of it what you will.The extras on this DVD disc - all about how that look was created and generated are almost more interesting than the movie itself, even if they do somewhat spoil the magic. How they did it, and looking at the bare set, the weird `motion capture' suit, and the wire-frame and weighted props - it's almost as fascinating as the movie itself, even  if it does strip away most of the magic.  It raises without meaning to, some uncomfortable questions for the producers of Hollywood epics in the next couple of decades. Namely; what use will producers have for impossibly perfect flesh-and-blood-top-of-the-food-chain actors, when you can take perfectly able but lesser and perhaps not so good-looking actor and with the click of a mouse make them look as good as you want and as fit as you need.",3,Enjoyable on it's own terms,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2318,"['definitely', 'not', 'early', 'proto-English', 'epic', 'Beowulf', 'featured', 'somewhere', 'first', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Intro', 'English', 'Literature', 'Part', '1', 'course', 'remember', 'yea', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'one', 'covered', 'everything', 'up', '18th', 'Century', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'risible', 'appeared', 'movie', 'trailer', 'mean', 'daemonic', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'starkers', 'rising', 'depths', 'subterranean', 'pool', 'seducing', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'undoubtedly', 'was', 'No', 'not', 'what', 'remember', 'sophomore', 'English', 'Lit', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'considered', 'own', 'terms', 'Visually', 'as', 'different', 'movie', 'just', 'anything', 'recently', 'produced', 'big', 'screen', 'what', 'video', 'game', 'graphic', 'novel', 'would', 'look', 'producer', 'only', 'had', 'unlimited', 'budget', 'work', 'briskly', 'paced', 'imaginatively', 'staged', 'may', 'be', 'future', 'certain', 'sort', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'generating', 'elaborate', 'consistent', 'richly', 'detailed', 'look', 'special', 'effects', 'computer', 'program', 'rather', 'matte', 'paintings', 'painted', 'cheesecloth', 'sculptured', 'Styrofoam', 'not', 'anything', 'will', 'pass', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'else', 'probably', 'better', 'most', 'especially', 'household', 'teenage', 'males', 'Amazingly', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'writer', 'second', 'film', 'scripted', 'have', 'watched', 'reviewed', 'lately', 'enjoyed-', 'much', 'initial', 'expectations', 'coincidence', 'make', 'will.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'disc', 'how', 'look', 'was', 'created', 'generated', 'are', 'almost', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'even', 'do', 'somewhat', 'spoil', 'magic', 'How', 'did', 'looking', 'bare', 'set', 'weird', 'motion', 'capture', 'suit', 'wire-frame', 'weighted', 'props', 'almost', 'as', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'even', 'strip', 'away', 'most', 'magic', 'meaning', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'producers', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'next', 'couple', 'decades', 'Namely', 'what', 'use', 'will', 'producers', 'have', 'impossibly', 'perfect', 'flesh-and-blood-top-of-the-food-chain', 'actors', 'when', 'can', 'take', 'perfectly', 'able', 'lesser', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'good-looking', 'actor', 'click', 'mouse', 'make', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'want', 'as', 'fit', 'need']",N/A
1126187,AB34G6VKP28L,B0010V5SW8,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","Beowulf is the oldest known legend in the English language, adapted from a series of what we can only presume was the Norse mythology of the hero that inspired such figures as King Arthur. The original poem is somewhat tedious and disjointed, and this recent film is only partially like it, filling in the story and making some major changes in order to promote it toward modern audiences.The kingdom belonging to King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is being terrorized by a violent half-demon by the name of Grendel (Crispin Glover), whose sensitivity to noise makes him particularly wrathful against the shouting and carrying on that transpires in the local mead house. Leaving devastation and rampant bodies in his wake, he threatens the lives and livelihoods of all, and Hrothgar desires to find a man capable of defeating him. His hero comes in the form of Beowulf (Ray Winstone), known for his acts of astounding courage and the defeat of numerous sea monsters and other devils of the northern world. Respected by his men and feared by his enemies, it does not take him long to cast his eye on Hrothgar's beautiful but emotionally distant wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).In a climactic battle that leaves carnage rampant in its wake, Beowulf wounds Grendel enough that he is forced to crawl back into his cave and perish in the arms of his mother, a water demon (Angelina Jolie). Her rage is absolute and only hours after Beowulf has been claimed as a hero, honored by the people and given the gift of a magnificent golden horn, she returns to extract vengeance for her son's murder, leaving him no choice but to hunt her down and defeat her as well. But once in her cave of wonders, Beowulf comes to discover that the lure of absolute can be stronger than anything he has before encountered.When I first saw images from the film, I wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me, because it was not immediately apparent that this was a live-action animated feature. This may be a trend that takes off in future years, since computer technology has come so far that they are now capable of making realistic human images, and in that sense Beowulf is an absolute masterpiece. There are moments when the computer animation is not fully rendered (the horses look the most fake, but all of the humans, dragons, and other CGI creatures are absolutely astounding) but most of it left me with my mouth open, because visually it is magnificent. Sometimes the characters look almost human, their facial expressions are so real. Other reviewers have remarked that it's impossible for a cold 3D image to convey true emotion, and to a degree, this is true, but Beowulf is not meant to invoke any magnificent response in its audience other than excitement, so it's ultimately forgivable.The film I rented was the director's cut, which I have since learned does not differ much from the theatrical release other than in terms of blood spatter.

So why the animation. If Lord of the rings can pull of such magnificent imagery in a real movies I fail to see reason why Beowulf couldn't have. The story is of the old english epic Beowulf and his adventures. Though I don't recollect Beowulf having an affair with Grendel's mother but I think it was put in to put the spotlight on Angelina Jolie (playing Grendel's mother).. Of course Grendel the monster looked underfed, oozing with gooey stuff... and the battle did not etch any lasting memory. Somehow the film in my mind ended up being more of an Angelina Jolie playing the seductress and the focus being shifted from the real protagonist. And also I think the directors took too much license when they got a son thrown in as a result of a successful seduction of Beowulf by Grendel's mother (in reality Grendel's mother gets killed).

1126190,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0010V5SW8,Chris Pandolfi,"[79, 96]","Written around 700 AD and being of unknown authorship, ""Beowulf"" may be one of the purest fantasies ever told--it was one of the first to tell the story of a warrior who fought demons and a dragon. In the hands of director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, the story transcends what we might have envisioned when reading the epic poem. This latest film adaptation is a triumph of classic storytelling, giving us a both hero to root for and monsters to be afraid of; it's a story told in the language of entertainment, having the power to capture its audience with compelling characters and breathtaking visuals. It's an honest to goodness fable that tells it like it is, completely free of long-winded setups and complicated details.Relying on the same motion capture technique he utilized in ""The Polar Express,"" Zemeckis has crafted an entirely computer generated film that has an appropriately surreal look. This is especially true of the characters, which exist in a gray area between the realistic and the fantastic; they don't look phony by any means, but they're not completely authentic, either. I suppose part of this can be blamed on the limits of computer technology, which still isn't able to fool an audience despite major advances. The thing is, I don't think the film should have looked too realistic, simply because it's telling an unrealistic story. ""Beowulf"" is a purely imaginative piece, and as such, the film needed a purely imaginative look. Zemeckis chose to make the entire thing one big special effect--there are no individual effects that enhance live-action scenes.Taking place in the sixth century, Ray Winstone voices the title character with the perfect mix of pride, arrogance, and youthful impulsiveness. He also gives Beowulf a hard-edged masculinity that's just as expected as it is clich&eacute;. Upon hearing that a monster is terrorizing a Danish kingdom, Beowulf and his Geat men come to the rescue. His motives are purely ego driven--he only wants to fight in glorious battle and be remembered for it. Stories of his past battles make this clear because they're all so dramatic, downright boastful. Basically, it's obvious that he's exaggerating practically everything he says to make himself look more like a hero. All arrogance aside, he does believe himself capable of killing the creature that attacked the mead hall of the drunken, disgraced King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and the quiet, suspicious Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).This creature is Grendel (Crispin Glover), a character that, like Frankenstein's Monster, is hideous yet pathetic. He's a grotesque sight to behold: he's massive, hunched over, and deformed, bearing little if any resemblance to a human being. His soft, pitiful voice--which speaks in a Scandinavian tongue--is pretty much his only connection to the rest of us. Here's a character that's truly nightmarish in appearance. And when his anger is added to the mix, it gets even worse; he loses control at the sounds of merrymaking, forcing him to retreat from his cave and attack the mead hall. As he breaks through the wooden door, the orange flames in the fire pit become a cold blue that engulf everything surrounding it. Beowulf is able to lure Grendel back by making his men sing, after which the two engage in fierce combat. Because Grendel has no armor or weapons, Beowulf decides to ""fight him on equal terms"" by stripping completely naked. How this was necessary, I have no idea, but I guess it doesn't really matter.It's only after the battle is finished that Beowulf learns of Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), a seductive water demon whose feminine curves are accented by shifting slivers of gold paint. Her hair ends as a living, tentacle-like ponytail, and her feet are naturally high heeled. When Beowulf first meets her, he carries a golden horn given by Hrothgar as a gift; in the presence of Grendel's mother, the horn glows like molten metal, just as the water she emerges from becomes a phosphorescent blue. In this strange yet magically erotic atmosphere, she temps Beowulf with promises of fame and fortune. At what price, no one can say, but considering how fiercely protective she was of her son, I think it's safe to assume that it'll be quite high.When the film flashes forward by a number of years, signs of Beowulf's age are not the only differences--his views on glory, battle, and fame have changed, forcing him to wonder if his years of arrogance were worth it. At one time, he would scream, ""I am Beowulf!"" at the drop of a hat, but now, there doesn't seem to be any reason to do that anymore. It doesn't help that he's keeping a big secret, one he's held onto for many years. The arrival of a monstrous fire-breathing dragon brings his past back up to the surface, and he must face it whether or not he's ready to.But to face his past is to redefine what it means to be a hero. The young Beowulf believed it was all about winning battles, but the older Beowulf begins to feel that there's something more to it, something that doesn't rely on physical brute force and bloodshed. In Zemeckis' film, Beowulf is just like any character on a Hero's Journey: he matures as his quest nears its end. He looks back on what he's been through and is able to draw strength from it. This well-established narrative formula is one of the things that make ""Beowulf"" an incredibly enjoyable film; it follows the most basic rules of fantasy storytelling, which is both necessary and effective. This movie thoroughly accomplishes what it set out to accomplish--it's an engaging, exciting, and highly artistic vision, made with style and precision.

In this case, this telling of part of the Beowulf saga is entertaining as long as you throw out your purism. What I liked were the action sequences. The casting is exceptional. Through voice and some of the movement, you sense the humanity of real life. (Ray Winstone is sexy enough to make that animation convincing.)  Some of the images are very poetic animation even in some of the horror.However, you have to adjust for the botox look of faces and gestures.  In action, that most famous of unnamed characters, Grendel's mother, is left mostly to our imagination. I hope that Barbie-doll nude in really high heels is meant to be an avatar insulting the intelligence of the characters and not the viewer. Jolie's voice is very immotive and accents exotically.

1126192,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0010V5SW8,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","Robert Zemeckis, like James Cameron, likes to use special effects only to help support the story rather than the effects becoming the showpiece. Well, he used to be anyway since, aside from Cast Away, he seemed more focused on advancing the technology but not really worrying if the story's badly written, sluggish or just not emotionally involving. Case in point: The Polar Express, which was a beautiful looking film which suffered from zombie-looking eyes and stiff movements. Beowulf is at least more story-centered but it's still not as involving, even with all the flash and pop.A creature named Grendel has been terrorizing a village and small kingdom and they ask for a hero to come and slay the monster. In comes Beowulf, a legendary hero who's not humble and noble but almost overconfident. With the King wanting the creature dead and the Queen showing affection for Beowulf, he must slay any demons that come his way and possibly deal with his own.The process used to make Beowulf is a more advanced version of ""motion capture"" which essentially puts actors in a suit filled with small balls that many cameras read and scan into computer and make a digital model of you so whatever you do, your digital you does as well. That gives CG animators freedom to have whatever kind of character model, whether creature, strong, alien over the performance you give. But after the Polar Express, the aim was more photorealistic but met with criticisms such as rather soulless-looking eyes and stiff movements, particularly in the face.Beowulf has even more advanced detail and realism but there's still something...""off"" about it, like you can just tell it's not right. Either they just wanted a different look to live action or duplicate it I don't know but it's hard to completely immerse yourself into the film since you're constantly going ""that looks like Angelina Jolie but....not"". Then again, the story's not really involving and doesn't really have a narrative drive to it with the climax just happening without much buildup (it's not just a problem with men but apparently movies about heroes as well I guess). Gone are the days of Back to the Future and Roger Rabbit where the visuals helped support the narrative; now it seems like it doesn't matter what narrative it is as long as it gives them a chance to use the visuals.I'd recommend seeing Beowulf mainly for the visuals alone, especially if you have an HD-equipped television and you can go up to 1080i or even the HD-DVD version.

I mean, Have some sympathy for the Devil, man: I'm talking about poor, twisted, mewling, scarred, warped, stretched, folded, spindled and mutilated Grendel, the cave-dwelling monster that gets Robert Zemeckis's eye-popping ""Beowulf"" off to its high-octane start.It's the end of the age of High Magic and the beginning of the Age of Man: so the skalds in the ale-halls sing---and with the latter comes the fact that it's damned near impossible where a man-eating monster can't get a decent night's sleep.Jeez. What's a Monster to do when the horn-helmed rowdies three valleys and a mountain range over won't shut up? Yeah, true, you gotta fight for yer right to party, but you also gotta fight for your right to a good night's sleep.So demonstrating that all Politics is really Local, Grendel (conjured up to whiney, howling, shockingly terrifying surreality by the immortal Crispin Hellion Glover) ambles on in to Ye Olde Meade Hall and shows 'em a face only a Mother could Love. I've had nights back in grad school like that, only I didn't fling people across the dorm. Might have been cathartic.Whatever it is, it means that a) it soon gets really tough to hire good help at Heorot's Olde Meade Hall; b) business starts jumpin' for the local Undertaker! and c) King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins clothed in his CGI birthday suit, baby!), unlike Tina Turner, needs another hero before the Danish party-scene starts lookin' like Beirut.Happily, a Geat NEEDS TO EAT! Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone, who trades his yellow speedo from ""Sexy Beast"" for a little chainmail and horned helm here) that is, hero of the Geats, and a dude with a great singin' voice! He hoists his vorpal sword in hand and does a little bedding down in Ye Olde Mead Hall, and it's not long before Grendel comes calling for a little late-night Danish Doorbell Ditching and the rest, as they say, is History (which can soon be said for Grendel as well).But remember what I said about Grendel having a face only a Mother could love? Well, he does. And so this particularly tall Tale gets Taller and sports---well, a Tail.Now: Bobby Zemeckis sexed up the million-year old Anglo-Saxon borefest (reputedly ""Beowulf"" may be older than John McCain!) with a little help from comics visionary Neil Gaiman: the storytelling here is really what we needed way back in junior high, when hormones were racing and the turgid tale before us was not. The pace is sheer, supple, and enormously satisfying---very primal.But you really go check out ""Beowulf"" for one thing: you're seeing the Future, baby, and it works. I saw ""Beowulf"" in 3-D on an IMAX screen and the effect---true three-dimensional cinema---made me purr: I now understand George Lucas and James Cameron's fascination with the possibilities of 3-D film.It's a truly immersive experience, an insurgent rush that airdrops the viewer into the film, a lush, living landscape all the more pregnant with possibility and menace, and the revolutionary possibilities for this new medium became immediately apparent from the brilliant, jaw-dropping tracking shot back and away and over the Danes Mead Hall, up over a wintry and sleeping landscape, to the craggy lair of a drowsing Ogre.The technology is all the more ingeniously deployed in a film like Beowulf, where you're huddling in the smokey Mead Hall while some huge and furious Thing batters against the doors, or clutched on the back of a rat between a falcon's claws flying high above a winter landscape, or perched oozily behind one of Grendel's scabby, suppurating ears. I found myself reaching out into space like a giddy cat to touch the rusty, finely honed spearpoint of a halberd made real in three dimensions, or to grab at a chestful of baubles and booty tossed my way across a trestle table.And speaking of a chestful of booty, Angelina Jolie (Grendel's Mama)can slink into my Meade Hall any ol' time; couple that with Zemeckis's rabble-rousing envelope pushing (ripping! shredding!) technology, a lean, mean, & provocative storyline that delves into the murkier territory of the ancient Legend, and Ray Winstone opening up a vorpal can of Anglo-Saxon throwdown (new ""Beowulf"" tagline: ""GEAT IS MURDER!""), and ""Beowulf"" is a real Dragonslayer that is almost embarrassingly and compulsively watchable.JSG",5,"Back in the Days when ""Getting some Tail""

On top of that, Crispin Glover's Grendel is incoherent (and I get it; he's speaking High German, but could we at least have some English subtitles?).

Despite its flaws, BEOWULF is grand fun and nonstop, thrilling entertainment.  The visuals (especially when the action is animated) are awe-inspiring; this is a very well-crafted film.  And--poem or no poem--the vision of a nude Angelina Jolie, complete with stiletto heels and a long ponytail tapered to a curling spear, emerging from that pool of water is more effective than Viagra.Boasting the voices (and body suits) of some serious celebrities, this film includes the contributions of Ray Winstone, the great Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, and Brendan Gleeson.  Can't go wrong with a cast of heavyweights like that, and this film doesn't.

Too many reviewers write it off because it doesn't follow a rather old and boring poem, which yes I have read.I personally find this new story better. I find the characters more multidimensional, and the overall plot more interesting.So what makes this movie better than other animated films we've seen? It has to be the intangibles people do not often talk about. The directing, editing, cinematography (or the animation equivalent), choreography, sound editing, and musical score are all top notch, and all the best I've ever seen in an animated feature.The acting is very good as well, Robin Wright Penn, is probably the weak point, but all the other players do well. Granted, the motion capture technology Robert Zemeckis is pioneering doesn't get every facial twitch, but it gets most now. I wonder if many of the negative reviewers realize the faces were actually performances as caught by motion capture technology.I won't even comment at how good the graphics were, that some people went into the film thinking it was live action should tell you that, but I think as a society we've gone beyond judging animation based on how real it looks. What is more important? The story, they directing, or how real it looks? We like movies like ""300"" which look unreal on purpose.I originally saw this film in IMAX 3d, and that was a great experience, but I've also seen in on the small screen a few times and it still holds up. Don't believe the negative reviewers, some people will hate anything that isn't live action, and some people will never accept a Beowulf movie that doesn't stick to the original one dimensional poem. But if you want to be entertained, and have an appreciation for the skills of a director, you should watch this. I think, if the story was exactly the same, the actors exactly the same, and the directing/camera shots/settings/angles/action choreography were all the same, but it WAS live action (and maybe not called Beowulf to not offend the literature snobs) it would have been universally lauded.

So short and sweet it is for yours truly.When I first saw this film, I was reminded of the thundering rendition of the epic poem often read by J.R.R. Tolkien to his students. I felt a bit of that sense of rousing ancient fun here. The vocal talents are quite stunning: Sir Anthony Hopkins hasn't done this well in years. Unlike another reviewer, I cannot fathom how Sir Anthony's voice was ""muffled"" by the CGI. That observation is a first for film review!Also, this is one of the few movies in existence in which I find John Malkovich remotely interesting. He's quite riveting - as is Crispin Glover, who gets some juicy Anglo-Saxon lines as Grendel. My wife asked what language he was speaking, and it was the most enjoyable thing of all to inform her Grendel speaks English. It's Old, but it's English. My wife is an English teacher.The story, the animation: I can see no flaw in what was done here. The characters are beautifully done, and the grotesque nature inherent in this type of thing is much less glaring than it was in POLAR EXPRESS, which gave me vertigo.

We've seen it done over and over again. But, for those who love the story the way it was intended, it seems silly to ruin it, unless it is for a compelling purpose, none of which was here in Beowulf. Imagine going to see your favorite band and having them singing your favorite song a completely different way, with different lyrics, and then still maintain it was the same song. This is what it is like to sit through the ""Hollywoodized""  film version of Beowulf. I'm a purest in some respects, but can put up with some reasonable additions and deletions and adjustments for particular works--consider the newer version of Great Expectations, as an example. Still, I think that the basic idea of this film was doomed from the start. It would have been better off had this movie not been called Beowulf.Probably what irks me most about this film is Zemeckis' idea that the poem was ""boring"" and that ""he didn't understand it"", something he refers to in the making of Beowulf in the extras.  I don't understand the motivation to make a film version of a book when you have little interest in the book. He did say he found interest in the screenplay version, but that seemingly kills the integrity of the story. Like one reviewer said, he had no business making this film. His disregard for the real story is evident when Beowulf goes to meet (ahem... kill) Grendel's mother, for example. It just seems ludicrous for him to have even been involved, especially when the potential to make a good movie was there.And, don't get me wrong. This film did have some good qualities. Although Beowulf is a vastly different character in the film, there are moments where he does carry on a heroic and noble persona.  There are intense moments in battle, and the special effects are quite amazing in many respects. Cool effects can only go so far, though.Over all,  this was a film with a lot of potential that sold out to make money or please ""eye candy"" enthusiasts. It winds up being just another one of the many dumbed-down versions of a story. Zemeckis went a little too far with his freedom of interpretation.

Authors must have done some research and they have done it well.The plotline is very simple but not silly and the many well executed action scenes are aptily counterpointed by more intimate ones where the basic needs and flaws of human beings are highlighted, first and foremost the choice of Beowulf to give in to the demon's allurement. This is too very faithful to what I consider to be the spirit of that distant age as are the final scenes when we see Beowulf reach out for the beautiful (and dying) demon son he has just slaughtered or when we see Angelina -the demoness- Jolie kiss for the second and last time the man she may have really loved.With the only exception of an Angelina Jolie in her prime who could have possibly outshone any animated replica of herself the other actors profit from the animation device. First and foremost Ray Winstone who, in the film, is simply gorgeous: it's far too easy to forget we are not facing a real body there. Beowulf, even in his old age, is nearly as alluring as the demoness, this effect being the sum of a competent actor (Winstone) given the body and charm of a world class model, which is quite an interesting possibility.All in all a good film: possibly too difficult and gloomy to please kids and simpler audiences but well scripted, well acted and entertaining.",3,can be fun,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,2032,"['admit', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'much', 'film', 'bought', 'bargain', 'price', 'much', 'came', 'out', 'dvd', 'just', 'see', 'state', 'art', 'animation', 'adventure', 'stories', 'not', 'mention', 'amateur', 'linguist', 'specialised', 'Germanic', 'languages', 'was', 'also', 'ready', 'have', 'shut', 'ears', 'eyes', 'brain', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'appalled.Well', 'got', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.In', 'strange', 'elusive', 'way', 'film', 'portray', 'rather', 'faithfully', 'what', 'imagination', 'depicted', 'Germanic', 'world', 'X', 'century', 'whereabouts', 'know', 'know', 'Beowulf', 'older', 'who', 'primitive', 'rough', 'not', 'entirely', 'devoid', 'cultural', 'refinement', 'queen', 'songs', 'cruel', 'violent', 'not', 'illogical', 'Authors', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'have', 'done', 'well.The', 'plotline', 'very', 'simple', 'not', 'silly', 'many', 'well', 'executed', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'aptily', 'counterpointed', 'more', 'intimate', 'ones', 'where', 'basic', 'needs', 'flaws', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'highlighted', 'first', 'foremost', 'choice', 'Beowulf', 'give', 'demon', 'allurement', 'too', 'very', 'faithful', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'spirit', 'distant', 'age', 'are', 'final', 'scenes', 'when', 'see', 'Beowulf', 'reach', 'out', 'beautiful', 'dying', 'demon', 'son', 'just', 'slaughtered', 'when', 'see', 'Angelina', '-the', 'demoness-', 'Jolie', 'kiss', 'second', 'last', 'time', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'really', 'loved.With', 'only', 'exception', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'prime', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'outshone', 'animated', 'replica', 'other', 'actors', 'profit', 'animation', 'device', 'First', 'foremost', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'who', 'film', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'forget', 'are', 'not', 'facing', 'real', 'body', 'there', 'Beowulf', 'even', 'old', 'age', 'nearly', 'as', 'alluring', 'demoness', 'effect', 'being', 'sum', 'competent', 'actor', 'Winstone', 'given', 'body', 'charm', 'world', 'class', 'model', 'quite', 'interesting', 'possibility.All', 'good', 'film', 'possibly', 'too', 'difficult', 'gloomy', 'please', 'kids', 'simpler', 'audiences', 'well', 'scripted', 'well', 'acted', 'entertaining']",N/A

1126222,A1IT9VY8Z9RG92,B0010V5SW8,"G. D. Williams ""gareth37""","[5, 6]","Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut)The quest for immortality has burned in the heart of the human soul since time began on this planet of limitations.  From the ancient past, the hero song of glory can be heard today if time is taken to listen to the aged wind melodies which sing about us.The retelling of the Beowulf saga fits in with the current emphasis on legends and heroes that the current society seeks to find.  This seeking, at its essential core, is discovering a link to the past, perhaps a heritage lost in the current system of K-12 or the complexity of our techno existence.In many ways Beowulf is a tale loaded with sadness and eventuality.  Fate can be a cruel taskmaster for a hero.  Most heroes of ancient lore did not get the Princess in the end and live happily ever after.  These epoch stories are not children's fairytales.  They deal with the essentials of the human soul in conflict with good and evil.There is an undertone of sadness for the first two acts. King Hrothgar is a tragic figure.  He is introduced as a drunken king with a young wife who loathed him.  The reason is revealed later on in the movie.  His death is a necessity born in his youth by those decisions that a young hero foolishly made.Beowulf's arrogance is only overshadowed by his prowess as a warrior.  His boasting is a mixture of actual fact and pure fantasy. Self promotion was not a stranger to Beowulf.He did not care for gold.  His quest was glory, and thereby songs and stories of his exploits would give him the immortality which life did not afford to a human on this planet.  The afterlife was a vague, uncertain realty.Beowulf and his men walk into the story without any idea what they would be facing.  To them Grendel is just another monster for heroes to dispatch to the forgotten regions where monsters go at death.Every hero needs a companion who is a true friend.  A true friend accepts the hero with all of his faults. Wiglaf is such a friend.The fight with Grendel, a creature part human and part demon, demonstrates that even the bravest heroes are destined for disappointment.  Beowulf's defeat of Grendel is a shallow victory.  The receipt of the golden dragon horn from King Hrothgar was an enchanted treasure which concealed a deadly curse.Beowulf had to face Grendel's mother, a water demon, whose beauty was only known to those who had succumbed to her carnal snares.  Beowulf was a hero, but he was always a mortal man.In act three, Beowulf must face a creature born of a moment lost in time.  He realized that the curse concealed in the golden dragon horn had to end with him, or it would continue from generation to generation.  In many ways the ancient hero knew when the time for his death was on the horizon.Before he and Wiglaf rode off to face the dragon, he said to Wealthow, his queen and wife, to remember him not as a hero or king, but a man--a mortal man scarred by human weaknesses. The man, who once loved her with all of his heart, was the memory that he wanted her to hold in her arms at night, especially during the long nights to come without him.The battle of Beowulf and the dragon is one of the best fight sequences that I have ever seen.  The old warrior must call from his inward being every ounce of what the songs and stories told of him--to be the hero of the legends once more in order to save his queen and his people.  He did rise to the challenge.The ending of the hero is always an emotional journey for the viewer of these movies.  You have invested your time and money into watching this presentation of these new story tellers of our age.Beowulf rewards this investment.The ending, as the sun sets, is one of the most insightful moments for Wiglaf.  I will not say more except that everyone must face that moment sometime in life--""temptation, sadness and indecision"" as my son-in-law stated as we finished the movie. My daughter did not care for the movie.This version of the movie is not suitable for children.  It is an adult tale with many adult themes.

It is set in Scandinavia in the late 5th century, and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of Anglo-Saxon literature. In the poem, Beowulf has defeats three main enemies:[1] Grendel - a very large troll[2] Grendel's mother[3] A Great DragonThe third battle takes place 50 years after the first two. At this time, he has become king of the Geats, unfortunately in this battle he is fatally wounded.An Animated Marvel:This film is an animated using motion capture techniques. The animators did an excellent job in making all the actors, monsters and sets look very realistic. This film is one of the most life-like animations that are available; this alone makes the movie a collector's piece.The Action:The action unfolds quickly, as the immoral behavior of a king come back to haunt him. Grendel is a vicious man-eating troll that hates the sound of merrymaking and puts an abrupt stop to it.Enter Beowulf, who's mission in life seems to be to seek out and destroy monsters that threaten humankind. Strangely enough, he baits Grendel, and awaits him complete naked. The action is fast paced and the fighting is brutal and gory at times.There are some surprises and the level of action is taken to even higher heights as he battles the dragon in the climax of this film.Conclusion:Excellent graphical content, acceptable storyline, and lots of action.",4,Bee Wolf or Bee Hunter (meaning of Beowulf),1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1464,"['Historic', 'Origins', 'film', 'broadly', 'based', 'Old', 'English', 'heroic', 'epic', 'poem', 'title', 'name', 'set', 'Scandinavia', 'late', '5th', 'century', 'commonly', 'cited', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'works', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'literature', 'poem', 'Beowulf', 'defeats', 'three', 'main', 'enemies', '1', ']', 'Grendel', 'very', 'large', 'troll', '[', '2', ']', 'Grendel', 'mother', '[', '3', ']', 'A', 'Great', 'DragonThe', 'third', 'battle', 'place', '50', 'years', 'first', 'two', 'time', 'become', 'king', 'Geats', 'unfortunately', 'battle', 'fatally', 'wounded.An', 'Animated', 'Marvel', 'film', 'animated', 'using', 'motion', 'capture', 'techniques', 'animators', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'making', 'actors', 'monsters', 'sets', 'look', 'very', 'realistic', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'life-like', 'animations', 'are', 'available', 'alone', 'movie', 'collector', 'piece.The', 'Action', 'action', 'quickly', 'immoral', 'behavior', 'king', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'Grendel', 'vicious', 'man-eating', 'troll', 'sound', 'merrymaking', 'abrupt', 'stop', 'it.Enter', 'Beowulf', 'who', 'mission', 'life', 'be', 'seek', 'out', 'destroy', 'monsters', 'threaten', 'humankind', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'Grendel', 'complete', 'naked', 'action', 'fast', 'paced', 'fighting', 'brutal', 'gory', 'are', 'surprises', 'level', 'action', 'taken', 'even', 'higher', 'heights', 'dragon', 'climax', 'film.Conclusion', 'Excellent', 'graphical', 'content', 'acceptable', 'storyline', 'lots', 'action']",N/A

The CGI and the 3D process was near-perfect and enhanced the film greatly.

1126227,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0010V5SW8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 5]","BEOWULF isn't exactly subtle. In the annals of barbaric Sword & Sorcery, subtlety doesn't much enter into the picture.  BEOWULF is over-the-top, gruesome, and violent. And that's just the way we like our Beowulf. The story, written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary and adapted from the ancient, anonymous epic poem, begins in 507A.D. as a kingdom in Denmark is beset by the giant demon Grendel. Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), the beleaguered old monarch, sends out the word far and wide, calling for a hero to vanquish Grendel. Then comes Beowulf of Geatland (Sweden), brawny, fearless, and indomitable, who, in the midst of his swaggering and name boasting, manages to slay the demon. So, it seems, the curse is lifted and it's all good and gravy in the land of the Danes. But no one knew about Grendel's vengeful mother...or, as Beowulf vehemently asks: ""Must I hack down a whole family tree of demons?!"" Well, yes.As a guy, it's hard not to like this flick. It's action packed, with monsters and beautiful women and lots of testosterone-generating activity. And it's all animated. With today's sophisticated technology and the bar being constantly raised, we've all come to expect a certain standard of quality. Yet, even as jaded as I am, there's no denying that the animation in BEOWULF is worth marveling at. It's a mindboggling, painstaking work of cinema, and it does right with this oldest of adventure stories.Robert Zemeckis, who brought us the fabulous-looking but soulless Christmas fableThe Polar Express (Widescreen Edition), brings the same dazzling CGI animation to BEOWULF. In fact, his ""performance capture"" technology - which is basically a live action performance that's been digitally captured and enchanced by CGI - is even more realistic now and, in BEOWULF, wonderfully evokes a sense of grandeur and myth and a feel for time and place. I don't know too much about the process, but, man, do I like it. And this technique is simply perfect for this sort of larger-than-life storytelling as Grendel, his monstrous but seductive mother, and other mythical creatures are brought to vivid life. Oh, there are still moments when we're reminded that this technology still hasn't been perfected, as the camera catches a character engaged in a weird facial expression (for some reason, Queen Wealthow has a lot of these) or in the middle of some awkward movement. But these are infrequent moments. Instead, a lot of the scenes are simply breathtaking.On a side note, it shouldn't be a surprise that the story of Beowulf, with its grand, melodramatic themes, has even carved its way into the world of opera. The film mines several of these elements: power, in the vigor of youth and in the weight of the crown; ambition and temptation; loss and tragedy, redemption and regret. Love's in there, too, somewhere. So, in the midst of the carnage and chest-thumping, there are actually moments of introspection.As the bold and bombastic hero, Ray Winstone brings it - the commanding presence, the cool confidence, the fire. In real life a doughy 5'10"" fella, Ray would've found it very challenging to physically play the warrior's warrior. But, thanks to ""performance capture"" we get to enjoy watching a mighty-thewed 6'6"" Beowulf and have Ray's amazing voice and acting talent shine thru. Initially, I did feel that Beowulf was being depicted as too much a one-note character, all glory, no depth. But his character did begin showing layers following his confrontation with Grendel's mother in the cave.With a larger than life lead character, it's sometimes iffy for the supporting actors to make their mark. But veteran big time actors Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich do add texture to the film, while Robin Wright-Penn, whom I haven't seen in a while, turns in a surprisingly good performance as Queen Wealthow. Crispin Glover adds depth to Grendel, a tortured soul, and even makes you feel sorry for the monster, even if you can't really  understand what the hell he's saying (apparently, it's in Old English). Angelina Jolie steals the show as Grendel's mother, who just 2 seconds ago shoved Jessica Rabbit and COOL WORLD's Holli Would off their perches as the hottest animated girls. I happen to find her accent very alluring.Ultimately, BEOWULF is a truimph in sweeping spectacle with just a touch of character study, and that's as it should be. This film is brutal and rowdy and visually compelling and will appeal to the barbarian at heart. This is Beowulf slaying monsters and downing mead, not Beowulf doing the crossword and sipping tea. Before Conan, before John Carter of Mars or Elric of Melnibone, before the Lord of the Rings, Beowulf made his mark. Now I'm not saying he inspired Conan and company, but Beowulf's story has been around for a thousand years and has been rooted in our public consciousness for so long that, well, you know what, maybe he did.",5,"""I've come to kill your monster!""",1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,4882,"['BEOWULF', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'subtle', 'annals', 'barbaric', 'Sword', 'Sorcery', 'subtlety', ""n't"", 'much',

1126230,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0010V5SW8,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","Beowulf is a magical piece of literature. And it's a good idea to keep some of the Anglo-Saxon original text. The director tries all he can to make the setting and costumes and psyche of these people realistic for the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ when Denmark was still believing in the Nordic Gods, Odin first of all, and before the arrival of Christianity at the beginning, after its arrival at the end. Interesting too to change the tale slightly to make the two half into one logic, the second half being the sequence of the first. Interesting too to use the magic of these old days and hence have some supernatural beings and events. It is true Grendel, his mother and the dragon were supernatural alright. But instead of making explicit the references to the giants and pre-human species surviving in total exclusion, instead of making explicit the reference to the runes brought to human beings by Odin himself, the director chooses a sexual line, from beginning to end. Then the monster is the son of the local Danish king and the mother who does not have a name but is a gorgeous woman disguising some kind of witch, a sorceress who has little difficulty mesmerizing the local king with promises of power into providing her with a son who will eventually be the scourge of the country and will have to be killed.  Hence Grendel is the ""son"" of the local king when Beowulf arrives in Denmark and the dragon will be the ""son"" of Beowulf himself. He will kill Grendel, then tame the mother by giving her a son, and finally kill that very son, the dragon. This addition kills something in the tale. Beowulf is the obvious Christianization of traditional Nordic tales and sagas in Anglo-Saxon territory in the seventh to ninth centuries. This is present in the film, but the sexual dimension of these monsters goes against this Christianization since it states that every generation will have to live under the menace of a monster produced by the fornication of the previous king with the supernatural woman, as if such pagan facts could survive in front of the Christian faith. This rewriting of the tale is thus for a modern audience, what's more for a young audience. This is quite clear in the electronic and computer game conception of the fights.  And this young audience does not care for all these religious things, including Christianity, and they can very easily imagine Christ having dinner with a dragon and being served by some unicorn. Dropping that dimension of believing and even faith that the saga originally had transforms the story into some kind of post-modern fantasy for a world that does not believe in anything and where believing has been transformed into some kind of personal private matter whereas it was a public communion with the whole society through its common rites and fears and hopes. Then the end of the film is the promise of a third monster, whereas the end of the saga was a final stop to the existence of all monsters.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",4,Unfaithful iconoclastic fantasy,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,3089,"['Beowulf', 'magical', 'piece', 'literature', 'good', 'idea', 'keep', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'original', 'text', 'director', 'can', 'make', 'setting', 'costumes', 'psyche', 'people', 'realistic', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'centuries', 'Christ', 'when', 'Denmark', 'was', 'still', 'believing', 'Nordic', 'Gods', 'Odin', 'first', 'arrival', 'Christianity', 'beginning', 'arrival', 'end', 'Interesting', 'too', 'change', 'tale', 'slightly', 'make', 'two', 'half', 'one', 'logic', 'second', 'half', 'being', 'sequence', 'first', 'Interesting', 'too', 'use', 'magic', 'old', 'days', 'hence', 'have', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'events', 'true', 'Grendel', 'mother', 'dragon', 'were', 'supernatural', 'alright', 'instead', 'making', 'explicit', 'references', 'giants', 'pre-human', 'species', 'surviving', 'total', 'exclusion', 'instead', 'making', 'explicit', 'reference', 'runes', 'brought', 'human', 'beings', 'Odin', 'director', 'sexual', 'line', 'beginning', 'end', 'Then', 'monster', 'son', 'local', 'Danish', 'king', 'mother', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'name', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'disguising', 'kind', 'witch', 'sorceress', 'who', 'little', 'difficulty', 'mesmerizing', 'local', 'king', 'promises', 'power', 'providing', 'son', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'scourge', 'country', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'killed', 'Hence', 'Grendel', 'son', 'local', 'king', 'when', 'Beowulf', 'Denmark', 'dragon', 'will', 'be', 'son', 'Beowulf', 'will', 'kill', 'Grendel', 'then', 'mother', 'giving', 'son', 'finally', 'kill', 'very', 'son', 'dragon', 'addition', 'something', 'tale', 'Beowulf', 'obvious', 'Christianization', 'traditional', 'Nordic', 'tales', 'sagas', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'territory', 'seventh', 'ninth', 'centuries', 'present', 'film', 'sexual', 'dimension', 'monsters', 'Christianization', 'generation', 'will', 'have', 'live', 'menace', 'monster', 'produced', 'fornication', 'previous', 'king', 'supernatural', 'woman', 'such', 'pagan', 'facts', 'could', 'survive', 'front', 'Christian', 'faith', 'rewriting', 'tale', 'thus', 'modern', 'audience', 'what', 'more', 'young', 'audience', 'quite', 'clear', 'electronic', 'computer', 'game', 'conception', 'fights', 'young', 'audience', 'not', 'care', 'religious', 'things', 'including', 'Christianity', 'can', 'very', 'easily', 'imagine', 'Christ', 'having', 'dinner', 'dragon', 'being', 'served', 'unicorn', 'Dropping', 'dimension', 'believing', 'even', 'faith', 'saga', 'originally', 'had', 'transforms', 'story', 'kind', 'post-modern', 'fantasy', 'world', 'not', 'believe', 'anything', 'where', 'believing', 'been', 'transformed', 'kind', 'personal', 'private', 'matter', 'was', 'public', 'communion', 'whole', 'society', 'common', 'rites', 'fears', 'hopes', 'Then', 'end', 'film', 'promise', 'third', 'monster', 'end', 'saga', 'was', 'final', 'stop', 'existence', 'monsters.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",N/A

""Beowulf"" would work as a normal actor film with CGI for special effects too, as all the actors that were involved with this film were truly first rate, but I got to admit, I love the CGI in this movie!

Man's regret for being weak, as his greed turns on him, & the ones he loves, & maybe the oldest truth of them all, once you have everything, there is nothing more to look forward to, but boredom, you are back where you started. ""Beowulf"" uses all these themes to great success, as it is a well written film, filled with top notch actors like, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Ray Winstone, Brendon Gleason, Crispin Glover, John Malkovich, & Robin Wright. These actors make this film come to life!As I said earlier, the more I watch this film, the better it gets. I just got the Blu-ray version, & it is absolutely perfection! This film looks better than almost any I've seen. It was truly made for Blu-ray! Colors are vibrant! Images are crystal clear! The sound is great! Grendel looks amazing, & all the characters are spot on visually.In a world full of CGI movies for 10 year olds, ""Beowulf"" stands out as an adult movie for all us grownups with a ten year old still inside, but also a film that speaks to the adult.

Being written in ancient English, it's impossible for most people to understand it at all.  It's like another language. But I do think the script was fantastic. I think they mostly honored the original story.  I especially liked that Grendel spoke his lines to his Mother in Ancient English, probably exact quotes from the original book.I also appreciated the direction.  From the very first scene, the suspense begins.  The drama is solid.  The adventure feels real. 'If 3D is required to enjoy this CGI film, then I hope it is available in 3D soon.

Speaking of demons, Angelina Jolie, in a few brief moments, offers one of the most beguiling ones I've come across (However, some potential viewers, especially those with young children, may find her scenes a bit too intense, sexually speaking.). The CGI-inspired animation is absolutely incredible, yielding almost realistic, three-dimensional versions of not only the major characters, but of the supporting cast as well (One of the most remarkable transformations is that of Hopkins as the elderly, fat Danish King Hrothgar.). Indeed, this CGI animation compares quite well with CGI done for real-live action fantasy films such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""300"".

Hrothgar sends out a call for heroes to come and fight the demon and Beowulf shows up to accept the challenge.  He and his men spend the night in the hall and Beowulf ends up taking on the monster virtually single-handed.  Grendel's mother, also a demon, retaliates and Beowulf goes to confront her.  This is where the story begins to diverge significantly from the original epic as Beowulf is seduced by her beauty and promises of fame and fortune and then must deal with the consequences later in life.The strength of this movie lies in the voice acting.  Anthony Hopkins, Brendan Gleeson, and John Malkovich are particularly strong and well suited to their parts.  The greatest weakness to the film was the decision to use all CGI, even motion capturing all of the actors.  Many scenes looks cheap and fake, even though they would have been easy to do using sets and live action.  The characters have waxy faces and often move stiffly and jerkily, and often seem unnatural.  The story changes were apparently an attempt to make the tale more tragic and more personal but the wisdom was questionable.  This Beowulf is no longer a hero, just a fraud.This is not a great movie, but it isn't bad for someone looking for simple action fare.  As long as you can set aside the odd look of the CGI characters, the action scenes look pretty good.

They did not understand it.  They also seemed to have missed a lot of it's detail.  It would appear that all they really got of the original story is that Beowulf kills a bunch of monsters.  The result is a movie that is not really based on the book outside of some names and dead monsters.Hrothgar is menaced by a monster named Grendel.  Beowulf shows up to kill it.  He then confronts Grendel's mother (nameless in this version) and finally a dragon.  This all accomplished through a cgi-enhanced cast of very talented actors.  That is the film's best selling point.  There is excellent acting in this film even if the story is pretty thin.  The extras provide a very good look into the thoughts and ideas that made this movie.Many people have know this story to some degree thanks to the school systems.  The main thing people remember is that Beowulf holds onto Grendel's arm until the arm is torn off.  This is not in this movie.

1126260,A3VX58UK0J9NJJ,B0010V5SW8,J. S. Lang,"[2, 2]","Director Robert Zemeckis claims he found the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf `boring' when he read it in junior high, and that he intended this film to be decidedly not boring, and thus supplied with ample gore and fornication.  Well, he did succeed in making a non-boring film, though whether the fornication adds much to it is debatable.For those not familiar with the plot of the poem, here it is in a nutshell: In medieval Denmark, the court of the chieftain Hrothgar is ravaged by a man-eating monster named Grendel.  Beowulf, a Swede, arrives with his band of brave thanes (knights), and Beowulf defeats Grendel in hand-to-hand combat.  Hrothgar showers Beowulf with honor, but soon after Grendel's equally vicious mother goes on a killing spree, so Beowulf has to kill her too.  Years later, back in his homeland, the honored Beowulf does one more valiant deed, ridding his land of a dragon, but dying in the process.Thus far the old epic and the Zemeckis film agree.  But this is the 21st century, after all, and you can't just film a classic `as is.'  This is `revisionist' Beowulf.  It turns out Grendel is also the son of Hrothgar, a kind of bloodthirsty payoff for Grendel's mother giving Hrothgar the semi-magical gold drinking horn that bestows prosperity and honor on whoever possesses it.  Grendel's mother, in the form of the seductive Angelina Jolie, likewise seduces Beowulf when he comes to killer but, years later, Beowulf learns that she bore his son--the dragon that he has to dispatch.  In this version, Grendel's mother is a kind of female Satan, tempting brave men to father children by her, then letting those children wreak havoc later on.  It's an interesting twist on the story, and, frankly, a rather silly one--after all, Beowulf, when she seduces him, is already young, handsome, brave, and honored by all--so what is she offering that he doesn't already have, pray tell?Revisionism aside, there is the sex factor.  The two male script-writers apparently have the mental and sexual development of eighth-grade boys, never passing up an opportunity to refer to sex or, even more often, the male crotch.  We never forget that they learned one Old English word to include in the script--`swive' (same as the F word)--and we hear it repeatedly.  Beowulf's thanes are obsessed with seducing the buxom women in Hrothgar's court, and in his famous battle with Grendel, Beowulf chooses to be nude--for no good reason other than holding the audience's attention, wondering if he is ever going to show us a full frontal view (he doesn't), since we're given lots of back views.  In the original poem, Beowulf does indeed take off his armor and lay aside his sword to fight Grendel, for the monster is protected by a magic spell from all weapons.)  In his aerial battle with the dragon at the film's end, Beowulf shows as much concern with dodging things that menace his groin as in killing the dragon.  (Rather like a medieval version of the usual crotch-punishing scenes on America's Funniest Home Videos.) We're also given an unnecessary view of Hrothgar's fat, bare (and computer-generated) behind.  Forgive me for sounding like a stodgy adult here, but this is really low-level scripting, something to make MTV-lobotomized boys snicker.Now the good news: it really is a fairly interesting and watchable action film.  You may know already that what you see on screen was mostly generated via computer, not by live actors.  Ray Winstone, a 50ish actor with a beer gut, gets morphed via the computer into the young, blond, muscled-up (and sometimes nude) Beowulf.  Essentially this is animation that looks awesomely real, and we can thank the techies for giving us an eyeful.  The actors--Winstone, Anthony Hopkins as Hrothgar, Brendan Gleeson as Beowulf's faithful friend Wiglaf--basically just lend their voices, not their faces and bodies to the story.  If you watch the bonus features and see just how little of the action was done by live actors, you'll wonder why they didn't just release it as animation.  But again, it is highly watchable, and some of the action scenes are impressive, particularly the last segment with the fire-breathing dragon.  And the ending is wonderful--the dead Beowulf put out to sea in a burning boat, as in the epic--but here there is a kind of O. Henry twist that makes it even more interesting.Obviously this is not a chick flick, it's an adventure that will appeal mostly to men--or, more accurately, to boys of all ages.  Due to the language and the sexuality, I can't recommend it for kids, although it's probably no worse than prime-time television.  Men in the mood for an action flick can enjoy it, allowing themselves to admit a few mild groans over the juvenile sexuality of it all.",3,Sexing Up an Anglo-Saxon Epic,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,4749,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'found', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'epic', 'poem', 'Beowulf', 'boring', 'when', 'read', 'junior', 'high', 'intended', 'film', 'be', 'decidedly', 'not', 'boring', 'thus', 'supplied', 'ample', 'gore', 'fornication', 'Well', 'did', 'succeed', 'making', 'non-boring', 'film', 'fornication', 'much', 'debatable.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'plot', 'poem', 'here', 'nutshell', 'medieval', 'Denmark', 'court', 'chieftain', 'Hrothgar', 'ravaged', 'man-eating', 'monster', 'named', 'Grendel', 'Beowulf', 'Swede', 'band', 'brave', 'thanes', 'knights', 'Beowulf', 'defeats', 'Grendel', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'Hrothgar', 'showers', 'Beowulf', 'honor', 'soon', 'Grendel', 'equally', 'vicious', 'mother', 'killing', 'spree', 'so', 'Beowulf', 'kill', 'too', 'Years', 'later', 'back', 'homeland', 'honored', 'Beowulf', 'one', 'more', 'valiant', 'deed', 'ridding', 'land', 'dragon', 'dying', 'process.Thus', 'far', 'old', 'epic', 'Zemeckis', 'film', 'agree', '21st', 'century', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'film', 'classic', 'as', 'revisionist', 'Beowulf', 'out', 'Grendel', 'also', 'son', 'Hrothgar', 'kind', 'bloodthirsty', 'payoff', 'Grendel', 'mother', 'giving', 'Hrothgar', 'semi-magical', 'gold', 'drinking', 'horn', 'prosperity', 'honor', 'Grendel', 'mother', 'form', 'seductive', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'likewise', 'seduces', 'Beowulf', 'when', 'killer', 'years', 'later', 'Beowulf', 'bore', 'son', 'dragon', 'dispatch', 'version', 'Grendel', 'mother', 'kind', 'female', 'Satan', 'tempting', 'brave', 'men', 'father', 'children', 'then', 'letting', 'children', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'later', 'interesting', 'twist', 'story', 'frankly', 'rather', 'silly', 'one', 'Beowulf', 'when', 'already', 'young', 'handsome', 'brave', 'honored', 'what', 'offering', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'pray', 'tell', 'Revisionism', 'aside', 'sex', 'factor', 'two', 'male', 'script-writers', 'apparently', 'have', 'mental', 'sexual', 'development', 'eighth-grade', 'boys', 'never', 'passing', 'up', 'opportunity', 'refer', 'sex', 'even', 'more', 'often', 'male', 'crotch', 'never', 'forget', 'learned', 'one', 'Old', 'English', 'word', 'include', 'script', 'swive', 'same', 'F', 'word', 'hear', 'repeatedly', 'Beowulf', 'thanes', 'are', 'obsessed', 'seducing', 'buxom', 'women', 'Hrothgar', 'court', 'famous', 'battle', 'Grendel', 'Beowulf', 'be', 'nude', 'good', 'reason', 'other', 'holding', 'audience', 'attention', 'wondering', 'ever', 'going', 'show', 'full', 'frontal', 'view', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'given', 'lots', 'back', 'views', 'original', 'poem', 'Beowulf', 'indeed', 'take', 'off', 'armor', 'lay', 'aside', 'sword', 'fight', 'Grendel', 'monster', 'protected', 'magic', 'spell', 'weapons', 'aerial', 'battle', 'dragon', 'film', 'end', 'Beowulf', 'as', 'much', 'concern', 'dodging', 'things', 'menace', 'groin', 'killing', 'dragon', 'Rather', 'medieval', 'version', 'usual', 'crotch-punishing', 'scenes', 'America', 'Funniest', 'Home', 'Videos', ""'re"", 'also', 'given', 'unnecessary', 'view', 'Hrothgar', 'fat', 'bare', 'computer-generated', 'Forgive', 'sounding', 'stodgy', 'adult', 'here', 'really', 'low-level', 'scripting', 'something', 'make', 'MTV-lobotomized', 'boys', 'snicker.Now', 'good', 'news', 'really', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'watchable', 'action', 'film', 'may', 'know', 'already', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'was', 'mostly', 'generated', 'computer', 'not', 'live', 'actors', 'Ray', 'Winstone', '50ish', 'actor', 'beer', 'gut', 'morphed', 'computer', 'young', 'blond', 'muscled-up', 'sometimes', 'nude', 'Beowulf', 'Essentially', 'animation', 'awesomely', 'real', 'can', 'thank', 'techies', 'giving', 'eyeful', 'actors', 'Winstone', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hrothgar', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Beowulf', 'faithful', 'friend', 'Wiglaf', 'basically', 'just', 'lend', 'voices', 'not', 'bodies', 'story', 'watch', 'bonus', 'features', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'action', 'was', 'done', 'live', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'release', 'animation', 'again', 'highly', 'watchable', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'impressive', 'particularly', 'last', 'segment', 'fire-breathing', 'dragon', 'ending', 'wonderful', 'dead', 'Beowulf', 'put', 'out', 'sea', 'burning', 'boat', 'epic', 'here', 'kind', 'O.', 'Henry', 'twist', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.Obviously', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'adventure', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'men', 'more', 'accurately', 'boys', 'ages', 'Due', 'language', 'sexuality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'kids', 'probably', 'worse', 'prime-time', 'television', 'Men', 'mood', 'action', 'flick', 'can', 'enjoy', 'allowing', 'admit', 'few', 'mild', 'groans', 'juvenile', 'sexuality']",N/A
1126261,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0010V5SW8,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 3]","When I was in high school we had to read the story of Beowulf during one of my English courses, and it was required reading which meant I wasn't all that excited to get into the story. Now, I have to admit that based on what we read and how we did it in my class, it was done by group reading (which meant different vocal inflections that seemed to improve upon or possibly take away from what was being read aloud at any given time), I wasn't too impressed by the story, and had therefore forgotten most of it. So, when I read that acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis (""Castaway"") was helming a film adaptation of the epic story, I was unexcited by the prospect. However, that attitude quickly changed when I saw the previews to the movie and was able to see just how cool they were making the story appear, and the digital effects employed to bring the live actors to life in a CGI way looked truly outstanding. Sadly, I didn't get a chance to see ""Beowulf"" in theaters, but I made sure that when the movie arrived on DVD that I added it to my ever-growing movie collection, even though I hadn't already seen it. However, before I rushed out to purchase the movie, I was a little unsure about just how much I would actually enjoy it. When it was initially released to theaters, the movie had received fairly mixed reviews from critics, some said it was terrific and mind-blowing, while others felt it was too fake and lacking drive and content; however, my friends and family that saw the movie all enjoyed it so I ignored the critics that hated it, and took a chance.""Beowulf"" is the story of a Danish kingdom ruled by King Rothgar (Anthony Hopkins) who finds both his kingdom and his people under attack by the monstrous Grendel (Crispin Glover). Hearing of the attacks and hoping to gain plenty of glory and reward, the heroic Beowulf (Ray Winstone) leads his band of warriors into battle in hopes of destroying the dreaded beast. After successfully ridding the land of Grendel, Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and her temptations of Beowulf may spell further disaster and despair for the kingdom and its newfound hero.Wow, this was an extremely entertaining and action packed movie that grabs you from the very beginning and doesn't really let up until the very end. The story is full of action, suspense, some humor, and even a little digital nudity (which is kind of weird). The overall scope of the story seems pretty close to what little I do actually remember from reading it in high school; although I did read that for the most part, the details of the movie deviate to varying degrees from the original story, apparently director Robert Zemeckis wasn't too big of a fan of the original story and wanted numerous elements revised or removed.The actors were all excellent in their individual roles, even though we never actually saw the real actors; their digital counterparts seemed capable and were given their motions through motion capture devices that were used with the real actors to record their actual movements. So, even though they never appeared on screen, their physical performances remained intact. Each of the digital actors closely resembled the actor that was playing the role, except for two of the characters whose outward appearances were drastically different from real life. The monster Grendel only had minute similarities to actor Crispin Glover (""Willard"") that portrayed him, and Ray Winstone's (""The Departed"") title character, Beowulf, was much leaner, muscular, and younger than the veteran actor voicing him and acting out his physical movements.For some reason, and I can't really understand why, unless it's just a desire to push the envelope of technology further, director Robert Zemeckis has made two films in a row that featured all CGI versions of the actual actors he hired to play the parts. It's strange, that he takes this approach, because the actors still act out their roles, but instead of being in costume they have little motion capture devices stuck on various parts of their skin-tight body suits for the computers to record each of their movements and translate that into the CGI character that will be onscreen. Zemeckis' first attempt at an all CGI enhanced live-action movie was the incredibly boring ""The Polar Express"" starring Tom Hanks. The technology was pretty impressive when that film was made a few years ago, but the actors did look a little zombie-like because their eyes didn't have any semblance of life to them, and their facial expressions seemed wooden. For ""Beowulf"" the technology seems to have advanced by leaps and bounds in the overall physical performance of the characters, the movements seem less wooden; although there are a few times where certain movements look oddly stiff, but the biggest improvement was made in the faces of the characters. Gone are the zombie-like, almost dead eyes, and the stiffly unimpressive facial expressions, and in their place are lifelike faces that in some instances could easily fool someone into believing it was the actual actor onscreen and not a digital counterpart.As much as I enjoyed ""Beowulf"" I did have one minor gripe with the movie. The movie boasts such impressive action and suspense that it feels like you hardly get a chance to catch your breath, which is fine with me, I enjoy it when a movie seems to move at break-neck speed. However, there is a point in the movie where I guess the writers, or maybe it was the director, wanted to kind of slow down the proceedings just a little bit, possibly out of fear that they may be losing their audience by going too quickly (though that was not the case in my experience). When this slower moment hits (occurring shortly after Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother) it feels strangely out of place, and really drags the movie down for its entire five or ten minute span, however long the breather in the pacing actually lasted I'm not entirely sure, but thankfully the respite was mercifully short and the movie's pace picked right back up as if it had never slowed down one iota.. I don't know why that down time occurred in the movie, and maybe that was one part from the original story that actually remained in the picture, which may explain why it felt different from the rest of the movie, but director Robert Zemeckis seemed to have no problem getting the movie to regain its momentum, and the rest of the movie proceeded along as if that brief low point had never happened.The visually stunning film ""Beowulf"" is a thoroughly entertaining and action-packed epic thrill ride, which I believe captures the essence of the original story of Beowulf, while giving it a somewhat modern polish that makes for an incredibly enjoyable movie experience.""Beowulf"" is available in PG-13 and unrated editions both contain violence and brief nudity.",4,A Visually Stunning

This 2007 all CGI version deviates considerably from the original story's truest and perhaps even its most enduring elements.  The villain Grendel is portrayed as if we have the opportunity to sympathize with him.  I remember upon his first attack in this film thinking that the Grendel from the epic poem would never have been so bold as to attack while his enemies were not asleep.  Never would he come face to face with King Hrothgar on his throne.  He is a cowardly and vile monster.  I also remember studying Beowulf and thinking that this is the ultimate pagan hero.  Courageous even if to a fault, boisterously politicizing himself to the gods by listing off each of his own unearthly tasks, challenging any evil no matter what it may be, even if it looks exactly like a naked Angelina Jolie.  Most of all, he was to be a shining example of pride and honesty.  It's funny, until now I never realized how I may have idolized Beowulf during my High School readings but just like those young pagan lads a thousand years ago listening to tales of the great warrior around a giant bonfire, I guess in a way I did and still do.  The Beowulf we get here is tricked and tormented and his time as king is essentially based on deception.  He is flawed in ways that make him less a hero.There is something to admire in that fearless definition of heroism held up high in the original tale.  Something even more endearing about this ultimate clash between good and evil.  Something got lost in the transition from ancient Anglo-Saxon scribes to the capable pens of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, who wrote the solid but fundamentally flawed screenplay.  Their writing makes for a great popcorn movie but I'm quite sure English scholars are not so impressed.  In fact, this will definitely not and should not be shown by teachers or professors to compliment the study of this epic poem.Still, Beowulf as a film is a back-to-back feast for the eyes.  It is a beautiful film and I also believe its style to be a worthy standard to uphold for other action filmmakers in the years to come.  I was worried right off that bat that Beowulf would be a two-hour video game cut scene, but it manages to transcend that judgement with time.  The characters may be quasi-cartoon but they still hold more spirit than many cartoons have the ability to by far.  Ray Winstone is Beowulf and his demeanor is nearly perfect.  Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich, as Hrothgar and Unferth respectively, both shine through their computerized characters more than enough.  Both actors bring the overall performances in this film to attention, as both are just that good at their craft.  Crispin Glover manages Grendel fantastically and the Grendel here is quite visually satisfying considering I've never had a strong enough imagination to picture Grendel myself based on the descriptions in literature.  Angelina Jolie is certainly good enough for her role, as flawed as it may be.  Grendel's mother is actually the character changed most of all, but as a separate villain from the epic poem, the character is not only crucial to Gaiman and Avery's story, but actually quite effective.  Oh yes, and what epic film with bearded warriors would be complete without everyone's favorite brute from the early middle ages, Brendan Gleeson (as Wiglaf)?!Overall, it is a tribute in some ways to the great story but on the other hand the way it sacrifices the purity of its characters just to create a convenient story, a gripping visual style, and a well-packaged blockbuster troubles me enough to only give a slight recommendation.  Also, wait for this on blu-ray if you want it (if it ever comes in that format), I really can't see any reason not to unless you need it right away.

1126263,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,B0010V5SW8,Keith Mirenberg,"[0, 0]","I rate Beowulf at four stars overall. I purchased Beowulf for under $5.00 as a pre-screened DVD, and started out a complete innocent. I had never seen coming attractions, and was totally unaware of anything about this film. In fact, I purchased the movie ignorant of the ambitious computer graphics effort and totally judged this book by its fine realistic looking DVD cover.I was not too surprised, however, to learn by watching this DVD that Beowulf was an all CGI affair. Then I suddenly noticed a main character that looked just like Anthony Hopkins (my favorite actor) as well as other characters that looked very familiar. Once the unmistakably beautiful Angelina Jolie appeared, I realized something was going on that might be important to the future of cinema.This film was a fairly successful effort to produce a movie in which the animated screen appearance of many characters was based on the actual actor. I at first thought that it represented the first efforts to produce a computer animated film without the use of actors, but only their images and voices.After watching the informative documentary on the making of the film I learned that the actual actors were vital and motion capture techniques (e.g., latest remake of King Kong) were used to produce these very realistic images. Although this falls far short of a time which will permit films to made by CGI which do not require actors to perform for any single role, Beowulf did not require set designers to actually build full scale sets or be limited to what could be actually be constructed.Actors who wish to participate in such future productions will permit detailed laser scanned 3D computer maps to be made of their faces and entire body and stored in data bases which will include: generic motion capture recordings including eye motions, the unique body language of a particular actor (I noticed Anthony Hopkin's body language before his face), as well as voice spectrographs for speech. Once high speed computer algorithms and CGI effects evolve sufficiently, these celebrity actors (or their estates after their death) could simply be paid a cost effective royalty for their franchise and reserve more of their valuable time for actual performances during special film productions or theater.In this way we will be able to see our favorite actors continue their screen appearances during their entire life and well after their death (if market rules permit), and once CGI computer techniques become cheap enough, increase the number of productions that celebrities can appear in for a small fraction of the normal production cost.",4,Beowulf - A technological experience and good flick,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",2008,2613,"['rate', 'Beowulf', 'four', 'stars', 'overall', 'purchased', 'Beowulf', '5.00', 'pre-screened', 'DVD', 'started', 'out', 'complete', 'innocent', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'coming', 'attractions', 'was', 'totally', 'unaware', 'anything', 'film', 'fact', 'purchased', 'movie', 'ignorant', 'ambitious', 'computer', 'graphics', 'effort', 'totally', 'judged', 'book', 'fine', 'realistic', 'looking', 'DVD', 'cover.I', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'surprised', 'however', 'learn', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Beowulf', 'was', 'CGI', 'affair', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'noticed', 'main', 'character', 'looked', 'just', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'favorite', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'looked', 'very', 'familiar', 'unmistakably', 'beautiful', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'appeared', 'realized', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'might', 'be', 'important', 'future', 'cinema.This', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'successful', 'effort', 'produce', 'movie', 'animated', 'screen', 'appearance', 'many', 'characters', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'actor', 'first', 'thought', 'represented', 'first', 'efforts', 'produce', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'use', 'actors', 'only', 'images', 'voices.After', 'watching', 'informative', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'learned', 'actual', 'actors', 'were', 'vital', 'motion', 'capture', 'techniques', 'e.g.', 'latest', 'remake', 'King', 'Kong', 'were', 'used', 'produce', 'very', 'realistic', 'images', 'far', 'short', 'time', 'will', 'permit', 'films', 'made', 'CGI', 'do', 'not', 'require', 'actors', 'perform', 'single', 'role', 'Beowulf', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'set', 'designers', 'actually', 'build', 'full', 'scale', 'sets', 'be', 'limited', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'actually', 'be', 'constructed.Actors', 'who', 'wish', 'participate', 'such', 'future', 'productions', 'will', 'permit', 'detailed', 'laser', 'scanned', '3D', 'computer', 'maps', 'be', 'made', 'entire', 'body', 'stored', 'data', 'bases', 'will', 'include', 'generic', 'motion', 'capture', 'recordings', 'including', 'eye', 'motions', 'unique', 'body', 'language', 'particular', 'actor', 'noticed', 'Anthony', 'Hopkin', 'body', 'language', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'spectrographs', 'speech', 'Once', 'high', 'speed', 'computer', 'algorithms', 'CGI', 'effects', 'evolve', 'sufficiently', 'celebrity', 'actors', 'estates', 'death', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'paid', 'cost', 'effective', 'royalty', 'franchise', 'reserve', 'more', 'valuable', 'time', 'actual', 'performances', 'special', 'film', 'productions', 'theater.In', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'favorite', 'actors', 'continue', 'screen', 'appearances', 'entire', 'life', 'well', 'death', 'market', 'rules', 'permit', 'once', 'CGI', 'computer', 'become', 'cheap', 'enough', 'increase', 'number', 'productions', 'celebrities', 'can', 'appear', 'small', 'fraction', 'normal', 'production', 'cost']",N/A

I have heard alot of people complaining they hated this movie because they left out or totally changed certain parts of the story. But you got to remember the book or poem in this case is always better than the movie version of it.So what I have to say is if you read the poem before seeing the movie try and look at this movie as a story that here to entertain you and not a movie based on the poem. You might actually like it better if you are not comparing it to the poem.

It's good to see domestic animation take a route that is obviously far from the kid/family oriented animation we generally see. Make no mistake about it, this is definitely no kids movie.Their actual take on the Beowulf legend is quite interesting. It certainly did go over the top at times, particularly in the earlier portion of the film. It can certainly lead to some eye rolling moments, but it doesn't effect the enjoyment of the film to negatively. At times it really feels as though they were trying a little too hard to toss in adult themes and those led to many of the eye rolling moments present in the film.The animation can be distracting at times, no doubt, but it is still quite well done. The most significant complaint I have isn't that it's creepy, like others, but rather that their animation of horses really didn't seem to be very good at all.

You know, when all of the interest is centered on one party making a grandiose speech or striking a vain attitude, and then, from a corner where you least expect it, you hear the sound of one person clapping extremely slowly--one clap at a time--as they stride forward towards the unctuous one, clapping sarcastically Tim says, though I would perhaps call it the ""ironic clap.""  Done well this is always the highlight of any movie that employs it, and we've all seen quite a few.  Well, the screenwriters of BEOWULF must love this device for the ""sarcastic clap"" gets used three times--a record in any movie, be it animated or live action!  John Malkovich was born to enact the ""sarcastic clap"" and he does so perfectly in this film.As for the scenes in which Robin Wright Penn and Alison Lohman stand side by side, wife and mistress, mourning over where did they go wrong with their man, to me they proved that like so many of us, Beowulf's screenwriters got many of their dramatic effects from the musical CHESS, written by Tim Rice and Bjorn and Benny from ABBA.  All ABBA fans remember the song ""I Know Him So Well,"" a duet for wife and mistress in which each boasts how she was the one to know the guy the best, and each then is forced to admit, he didn't really care for either of us!

Beowulf, the new king is young and getting himself into the same trouble as the previous king; then he is old and making out with some girl young enough to be his daughter--of which he has none, or sons...of the queen that is. We miss his whole life. Where is his relationship with the queen and its deterioration? Not even one love scene? Did she withdraw from him for the same reason she had done so from the previous king? And what? Russell Crowe wasn't available? Who the hell is Ray Winstone? If you want to know why this movie HAD to be CGI, please look at this picture of him! [...] Get the F out of here. What (or whom) did he do to get the lead in a movie about a big, strong, hero man with Medieval buns of steel? Zemeckis, the director, says he specifically chose Winstone after hearing him do Henry VIII, and that he IS Beowulf. Talk about a tin ear. Compared to Gerard Butler's resonant, ""Tonight we dine in hell!"" Winstone's thin, weak and unconvincing ""I am Beowulf,"" is almost funny. Winstone is the ?ultimate Beowulf?? Did Zemeckis SEE Troy? Pitts voice was a little girly, true, and Eric Bana is well, banal in seemily every circumstance, but have you seen either one of these men? Was the budget so low that Zemeckis could use technical wizardry to turn Winstone into Pitt's Achilles, but not to resurrect Mel Gibson? Admittedly a little long in the tooth now, but certainly the progenitor of the half-man/half-beast by any standard. Or Hugh Jackman couldn't buff up in a pinch?

1126276,A3IHBZ11SOGZQ8,B0010V5SW8,lexo1941,"[1, 2]","...To paraphrase a line from the actual poem.  I was only mildly curious about 'Beowulf' when we rented it.  Being a fan of the poem, I was interested to see what this surreal cast (Ray Winstone?  John Malkovich??  Angelina Jolie???) were going to make of it.  I expected it would be camp fun.  Instead, it was unexpectedly grand, epic, and rather moving.  I gather Robert Zemeckis hates the poem, which suits my idea of him as an ignorant schmuck who doesn't recognise good material when he sees it, and enables me to give all the credit for the story to both the Beowulf-poet himself and to Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, who wrote the screenplay.They've only really done one thing to the story to make it a fully-fledged Hollywood movie, and I won't give it away here but it makes a certain kind of sense, and certainly makes for a more satisfying movie than the original poem would have been if they'd just left it as it was.  Those who didn't like this film but haven't read the poem might be surprised to learn that there are passages of dialogue that have been lifted almost word-for-word from the original, such as when John Malkovich's cynical and snobbish counselor Unferth challenges Beowulf about a swimming contest that he (Beowulf) had lost.  The CGI acting is a lot better than some people seem to think - Robin Wright Penn's character in particular is remarkably expressive and touching.  And despite what the Amazon editorial says, Angelina Jolie's is not like a rubber doll, but actually slightly more realistic-looking than Angelina Jolie herself (I think they toned down the lips a bit).There's some top-class smiting, enjoyable turns from Anthony Hopkins as the complacent king Hrothgar (nicely expanding on hints in the original story) and Brendan Gleeson as Beowulf's hairy sidekick Wiglaf, yet another in Brendan Gleeson's line of memorably hairy sidekicks.Oh yeah, and that accent that nobody can seem to figure out?  It's Welsh.  At least, Hopkins is doing Welsh, so Wright does the same thing, closely followed by most of the serving wenches and Alison Lohman as Beowulf's girlfriend (although by the time it gets to her it's just gone kind of weird).  Meanwhile, Gleeson is doing inner Dublin, Winstone is doing East End of London and Malkovich is just doing Malkovich.  But who cares?  Crispin Glover's dialogue is entirely in Old English and his mother appears to be from Serbia.  Just sit back and enjoy.'Beowulf' is underrated.  The story is in most important respects faithful to the original and, where it isn't, comments intelligently upon it from a distance of a thousand years.  I'm not totally convinced that it wouldn't have been as good if they'd done it as a mixture of live action and animation, but then they'd have had a whole cast and crew freezing their knees off in Denmark somewhere and the production would have been less happy all round.I love the poem but it makes sense on its own terms as a poem; it wouldn't be as good a movie if you just filmed it.

Every scene is designed to pop, each bloodied lance, or spurt of drool, or lashing claw will jerk you back in your seat.  And, miracle of miracles, the glasses, once removed, don't leave behind the optical ache that was caused (in me, at least) by the typical blue-red lenses.  Oh, the swoops through snow-crusted limbs!  Oh, the spinning vertigo of a mid-air dragon battle!  Oh, how sumptuously do Jolie's lovely lady lumps rise, laminated in what looks like golden pancake syrup!Other than neat-o special effects and about as much titillation as you can get in something rated PG-13 (the moral of the story seems to be that even the most powerful and bravest men are no match for a strategically nude Angelina Jolie), does the movie have much to offer?The story, to anyone familiar with ""classic"" literature, is your typically post-modern retread of the hero-legend Beowulf.  Aging king?  Natch.  Unearthly monster?  Check.  Young, proud warrior?  Ditto.  Complex internal struggles?  Eh, well, not so complex, but, yeah, they're there.  People interested in authenticity, in whether the film stays true to the original tale, will be delighted to know that there's a lot here you can complain about.  Light up the blogs!The rest of you will probably be entertained.  The movie capitalizes on the captured-movement technology employed fruitlessly in ""The Polar Express.""  The humans are still the least realistic thing about the movie, but they have a bit more fluidity to their expressions than you'd expect.  Character actors, like Hopkins and Malkovich, bring a handsome amount of energy to their parts (the portly King Hrothgar and his right-hand weasel, Unferth, respectively).  Others don't fare so well.  I didn't recognize Robin Wright Penn until halfway through the movie (her Queen Wealthow seems to have lockjaw), and Jolie (as Grendel's morphic mother) relies exclusively on that pursed, come-hither look she's perfected over the years (she could probably get a patent on it).  But who's looking at her face?  (She puts the [ahem] back in ""classic!""  Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!)The story tries to explore all the avenues of misunderstood pain (Grendel's monstrous motivations are pitiable and make him less a villain than a tragic figure) and natural human weaknesses (the dragon has a single weakness above its heart; Beowulf's weakness is a little further south).  The exploration is fun although a bit too thorough; the movie runs about fifteen minutes longer than it needs to.That's okay.  Gaiman's script is as florid as everything else Gaiman has ever written (Roger Avary, Tarantino's long-time artistic foil, is co-writer).  Zemeckis's directing is as scrumptuous as (most) everything else he's ever directed.  And, like I said, even when the story gets long in the tooth, 3-D viewers can still amuse themselves with the perfect roundness of the pebbles, the layered beauty of technology, and Jolie's smooth, flawless, perfectly arrayed ...Uh.

1126284,A17BUUBOU0598B,B0010V5SW8,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[36, 45]","Beowulf is a new version of a classic tale.  The animation style really comes to life when seen in Imax 3D.  This is one movie worth seeing in the theatre and owning in HD.There are three groups who will want to see Beowulf no matter what reviewers think: those who loved the Polar Express (same creators, same animation style), those who love mythology and war movies, and those who love Angelina Jolie.  And yet the real reason to see this movie should attract a much wider audience: this is a visually stunning ""video game"" on the movie screen.  While any new take on a classic tale will upset purists, this movie is worth suspending disbelief for the entertainment value.Visual EffectsThe animation of the film is very ""cartoon"" and ""video game like.""  While that may not satisfy those who are looking for entirely realistic CGI effects, it is an artistic form that is very compelling when seen in Imax 3D.  Clearly, the technology will improve in future movies.  Regardless, the creativity and artistry of this movie should be appreciated for what it is.There are many 3D elements that leap out at viewers.  If they added smells and water spray it would be very similar to some Disney World 3D movies.  My only curiousity is how (if at all) they plan on making the 3D experience available to home viewersThe MusicThe score is very well put together and complements the movie experience.  There is a lot of driving heart pounding composition, almost operatic in nature.  And there are also soft pensive songs.  In any case, the music is also well appreciated in a theatre, and sets this version apart from previous ones all on its own.Beowulf SoundtrackActing and DirectionThe acting is really well tailored for the film, in as much as CGI can be.  Really, this is an accomplishment in direction and film editing.  You will find yourself asking, ""who is that actor who plays Beowulf?""  And when you see Ray Winstone in real life, you will be even more amazed.  Robing Wright Penn as the queen and Anthony Hopkins as the king give the most classic expressive performances of the group.  And unfortunately for the Jolie fans out there, her role is somewhat minor in the scope of this movie.The StoryThose who read Beowulf will leave with a certain feeling of ""Huh?"" after seeing this movie.  The story has been changed, but in a purposeful way.  It is true that Beowulf comes across as more vulnerable than in the original accounts.  In the end, I defer to the creators.  They have created a different version of this story that should be appreciated on it's own.  Purists aside, it's an interesting take on the tale.Overall, this is a great entertainment movie.

1126285,A2FHQVL4ZG0E1O,B0010V5SW8,"MartinP ""MartinP""","[0, 0]","Despite scathing criticism of his ""Polar Express"", Robert Zemeckis seems determined to establish himself as the founding father of a new way of filmmaking: fully computer generated movies that are based on real actors and real acting, who are transformed into digital characters that are supposed to be indistinguishable from live ones. Obviously, the technique offers interesting possibilities: average built Anthony Hopkins can be turned into a tubby little king, and tubby Ray Winstone into a Men's Health cover model (including a remarkable propensity to take off his clothes). Angelina Jolie's lips and bosom can be bloated into shapes way beyond the reach of silicone without so much as touching a syringe. The CG-characters blend more naturally into their CG-surroundings than has ever been seen in films that put real actors in CG worlds.However, we are still a very long way off from creating CG-actors that look like the real thing. Joints, mouths and eyes are dead give-aways. The slug-like lips and strangely non-symmetrical mouths were particularly distracting. Skin is too smooth, lacking the underlying definition of the myriad muscles and tendons in a real human. Emotional expressions, which depend on so many almost imperceptible details, remain firmly stuck in crude cartoon mode. So basically, what we get is a rather morbid looking cast, like a group of rubber zombies, and a distinct sense of estrangement settles on the viewer when watching their antics. Half the time I was waiting for Shrek to walk in.However, the star of the show is not Shrek, but Grendel, who is something like Gollum's big, violent, mentally retarded brother. He's horrible and touching at the same time, which is a real accomplishment, and he is no doubt the one original creation worth watching Beowulf for. Be warned that he thinks of biting off and chewing somebody's head as a light afternoon snack. Several scenes are pretty gory, but the overall artificiality of the movie effectively precludes any sense of shock.The story is simple enough: heroic Beowulf liberates the Danes from the curse of Grendel, only to fall himself into the same trap that caused the problem in the first place, the trap being Grendel's buxom ma combined with the hero's lack of control over his hormonal impulses. Demons, sea monsters and a dragon provide occasion for satisfying fantasy spectacle. The action moves along at a nice pace, though its motivation is not always clear. The result is sometimes hilarious: Beowulf's nude fight with Grendel must rank as one of the great moments of comedy in recent animation - not altogether inadvertently it seems, for the way his genitals are cleverly kept out of sight is a thinly disguised retake on Bart's naked skateboard ride in ""Simpsons, the Movie"".The design of the movie is of the kind the regular moviegoer is by now quite overfed (if not simply fed up) with. It is generally well done, but don't expect anything you haven't seen before. And unfortunately, CG surf, fire and smoke look as unconvincing as the humans do.

1126286,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B0010V5SW8,maskedgamer,"[0, 0]","First off I want to say I had no idea this movie was animated. I immediately almost turned off my television as soon as I saw that. Computer animated movies just never seem to be able to express a level of realism that brings the story to life. After watching the first opening scenario of Beowulf I was bit skeptical, but after a while I was able to put that aside and enjoy the story.The story of Beowulf if you remember from english class is an epic poem about a legendary hero who is fearless and conquers all before him. In the poem if I can remember correctly Beowulf is a mans man, he isn't so easily tainted. His greatest reward is the victory from a good challenge. The Beowulf in this film is only half that in the story. He is a courageous godlike character, but he still has the weaknesses of a man. The greatest tale I remember from Beowulf is the story of Grendel and his mother. This movie is pretty much that story but hollywoodfied.It is its own story in a sense because it samples bits and pieces from the original story, but honestly that doesn't make the film bad at all. Unless your going to nit pick at everything and honestly expect someone to produce a word for word movie on Beowulf it be about 36 hours long... have 18 movies in the entire series, and by the time it was done it be 2030. The movie was just made in good fun to rival at movies like 300! It's an action packed adventure story with a character that can be familiarized with. I for one having read the original poem and watched this movie was able to enjoy them both. Just make sure you know how the real story of Beowulf and Grendels mother goes.Now on to the movie itself. I think it really suprised me. There were times when the animation looked extremely cheap, but then there were times when it blew you away like the scene with Grendel, his mother aka (Angelina Jolie), and that epic battle against the dragon make this movie worth watching. The fight with the dragon was done amazingly well, and didn't make you feel like it was just endless special CGI effects. It was over the top as any endng should be, but done just right in this one. The story was as good as it could be. The original poem is sort of complex, and I can't see it being adapted to younger audiences and people everywhere without it being made into an understandable movie like this. Aside from the scene with Angelina Jolie (who didn't like that?) and some other scenarios... I can't see that this movie was made to be all that serious. It's for mid to younger audiences. 300! was a gory movie for grown adults, and Beowulf is pretty much a 300ish movie kids can watch.Overall as I said earlier the movie is great. Worth renting to check it out it is a sword swinging action flick after all so to speak. Now if your one of those nit pickers and you just can't handle a silverscreen version of any book or in this case poem to movie. Stay out the video store, and out the movie theater for that matter... you will never be satisfied, as what nit picker ever truly is?",4,Not what you'd expect but still turned out pretty good.,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,3033,"['First', 'off', 'want', 'say', 'had', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'animated', 'immediately', 'almost', 'turned', 'off', 'television', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Computer', 'animated', 'movies', 'just', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'express', 'level', 'realism', 'story', 'life', 'watching', 'first', 'opening', 'scenario', 'Beowulf', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'while', 'was', 'able', 'put', 'aside', 'enjoy', 'story.The', 'story', 'Beowulf', 'remember', 'english', 'class', 'epic', 'poem', 'legendary', 'hero', 'who', 'fearless', 'conquers', 'poem', 'can', 'remember', 'correctly', 'Beowulf', 'mans', 'man', ""n't"", 'so', 'easily', 'tainted', 'greatest', 'reward', 'victory', 'good', 'challenge', 'Beowulf', 'film', 'only', 'half', 'story', 'courageous', 'godlike', 'character', 'still', 'weaknesses', 'man', 'greatest', 'tale', 'remember', 'Beowulf', 'story', 'Grendel', 'mother', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'hollywoodfied.It', 'own', 'story', 'sense', 'bits', 'pieces', 'original', 'story', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'bad', 'going', 'nit', 'pick', 'everything', 'honestly', 'expect', 'someone', 'produce', 'word', 'word', 'movie', 'Beowulf', 'be', '36', 'hours', 'long', 'have', '18', 'movies', 'entire', 'series', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'be', '2030', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'made', 'good', 'fun', 'rival', 'movies', '300', 'action', 'packed', 'adventure', 'story', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'familiarized', 'one', 'having', 'read', 'original', 'poem', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'real', 'story', 'Beowulf', 'Grendels', 'mother', 'goes.Now', 'movie', 'think', 'really', 'suprised', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'animation', 'looked', 'extremely', 'cheap', 'then', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'blew', 'away', 'scene', 'Grendel', 'mother', 'aka', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'epic', 'battle', 'dragon', 'make', 'movie', 'watching', 'fight', 'dragon', 'was', 'done', 'amazingly', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'was', 'just', 'endless', 'special', 'CGI', 'effects', 'was', 'top', 'endng', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'just', 'right', 'one', 'story', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'original', 'poem', 'sort', 'complex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'adapted', 'younger', 'audiences', 'people', 'everywhere', 'being', 'made', 'understandable', 'movie', 'Aside', 'scene', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'scenarios', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'serious', 'mid', 'younger', 'audiences', '300', 'was', 'gory', 'movie', 'grown', 'adults', 'Beowulf', 'pretty', 'much', '300ish', 'movie', 'kids', 'can', 'watch.Overall', 'said', 'earlier', 'movie', 'great', 'Worth', 'renting', 'check', 'sword', 'swinging', 'action', 'flick', 'so', 'speak', 'Now', 'one', 'nit', 'pickers', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'silverscreen', 'version', 'book', 'case', 'movie', 'Stay', 'video', 'store', 'movie', 'theater', 'matter', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'satisfied', 'what', 'nit', 'picker', 'ever', 'truly']",N/A

1126293,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0010V5SW8,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","By now, everyone knows about Beowulf, if only because they were forced to read it in high school.  Judging from the audio track of the DVD, some folks clearly resented having to read the ""boring"" heroic saga of a man who rips a troll's arm off with his bare hands, slays its monstrous mother, becomes king, and later dies fighting a dragon.There's some odd defensiveness about Beowulf from the directors.  This movie isn't JUST going to be about Beowulf, it will have a tightly wrapped story from beginning to end!  It won't JUST be about a hero slaying monsters, it will be about father and son guilt, mother and son pride, and the lies they tell each other!  There won't JUST be actors, there will be beautifully rendered superbly animated avatars! It won't JUST be a movie, it will be a movie in 3-D!For the most part, it works.  Beowulf and the king who hires him to slay Grendel are at times drunken louts and macho warriors.  Grendel isn't just a disgusting monster, he's a piteous troll-child that throws a deadly tantrum.  And Grendel's mother?  Mmm, Grendel's mother is a delicious golden-skinned incubus who actually sprouts high heels (because, hey, human isn't her real form anyway so why not?) and a slinky tail. Gone is the random moment when Beowulf finds the sword that will slay Grendel's mother just laying around in her treasure horde, a situation I always found a little lazy on the part of the mysterious author. Replacing the somewhat jumbled juxtaposition of heroic mythology and Christian values is a tale of men tempted by lust and greed who go on to father the demons that ultimately destroy them.The three-dimensional effects are lost on my television, a problem that's going to only become more prevalent as movie theaters give up trying to compete with DVDs and switch to gimmicks like 3-D.  This makes some scenes more amusing than exciting, like when a flagpole juts towards the screen at the viewer.The computer graphics, while breathtaking, seem to be almost beside the point.  Yes, it's great that we have Jolie in all her near-naked glory.  But why bother recreating her in CGI at all?  When you watch the making-of docs, the actors acted with props, right down to Crispin Glover tossing dolls around as Grendel.  Was that really necessary?  Do we really care how realistically a warrior swings a lamp (a weighted prop, in case you're wondering) or Grendel tears a man in two?Perhaps the most grating attribute of the DVD is the insistence that Beowulf was ""boring.""

He sends out messages far and wide that ""anyone who can kill the beast will be greatly rewarded"".

1126299,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0010V5SW8,mirasreviews,"[2, 4]","""Beowulf"" is a graphic, animated interpretation of the oldest extant Anglo-Saxon poem about a heroic savior who saves a kingdom from evil monsters. In Denmark, 507 AD, the realm of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is harassed by the giant demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), who slaughters and consumes even the stoutest soldiers at will. The King offers half the gold in his kingdom to any man who can rid them of Grendel's menace. Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes from across the seas to take up the challenge. But even a man who slays Grendel may be no match for the demon's mother.This isn't the Beowulf of lore. The film follows the poem only loosely, just as the characters' appearances are vaguely inspired by the actors who portray them. This new ""Beowulf"" alters its themes to suit very different sensibilities than an medieval audience would have. That's what legends are for, so I can't object. Screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary approached the story with the idea of incorporating some elements that the monks who preserved the legend for generations might have edited out. As director Robert Zemeckis said, ""It's all about eating, drinking, killing, fornicating.""The story is compelling, but the animation sometimes gets in the way. This is motion-capture animation, which records the movements of the actors but leaves their features to artists' imaginations. Ray Winstone is looking delightfully buff. But the characters' jerky movements look more like stop-motion, causing some action scenes to resemble a Gumby brawl. ""Beowulf"" can't decide if it wants to look real or fake and so juxtaposes the two for an unpleasant effect. But the actor's voice performances are strong and very capable of carrying the film. I do wish the animation were more consistent, or at least interesting, however.The DVD (Paramount 2008 Director's Cut): There are 6 featurettes, 6 deleted scenes, and a theatrical trailer. ""A Hero's Journey: The Making of Beowulf"" (24 min) explains and demonstrates the motion capture technique. Actor Ray Winstone allows us to watch while his face is fitted with electrodes and he dons his mocap suit. We watch several scenes being filmed and observe various aspects of the actors' experiences working in motion capture. ""Beasts of Burden: Designing the Creatures of Beowulf"" (7 min) discusses the appearance of Grendel, his Mother, and the Dragon.""The Origins of Beowulf"" (5 min) interviews writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, Robert Zemeckis, and producer Steve Starkey about the adaptation. ""Creating the Ultimate Beowulf"" (2 min) is about creating the iconic leading man using a great character actor and mocap animation. ""The Art of Beowulf"" (5 min) discusses the ideas behind some design elements. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, Spanish.

First off, the animation: I think it's well-done, and whether or not it was a good directorial choice is something on which I have no opinion. It is what it is, and as far as I'm concerned, it worked well.There are many complaints about such elements as nudity, rude jokes, Beowulf's boastfulness and ""silly"" chest-pounding dialogue. Some people are clearly lacking imagination as they seem unable to see beyond their 21st-century Christianized perspective. Nudity was no big deal to our heathen ancestors. Bawdiness was a large part of their humor, just as it is much of ours today. There are many bawdy jokes and riddles surviving in Old English. Human nature doesn't change that much. These elements of the movie are all perfectly accurate. This was a time and place where a king might retain a professional ""fartist"" in his mead-hall, who entertained the men with his skillful control of flatulence!!! Be glad the movie kept things as low-key and tame as it did!!!Boasting was also a cultural practice that was taken very seriously, and public boasts about future accomplishments could be considered binding before the gods; failure to achieve them was shameful and required some kind of debt-payment (known as ""scyld""). Beowulf's boastfulness should be seen within cultural context; it is actually highly ritualized, not simply the product of his own ego.Someone complained of Angelina Jolie's accent that it wasn't ""pre-Anglo-Saxon Old English"". First, there is no such thing as ""pre-Anglo-Saxon Old English""; Old English developed from the combined tongues of the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians when they invaded the British Isles. Second, as far as I know, none of us living today was around to hear what an ""Old English accent"" actually sounded like, if there even was such a unified thing (unlikely, given the variety of accents spoken throughout England today). Third, the poem is set in Denmark, not England. And fourth, the character is not a member of any human society, she is a sea-troll. Who knows what a sea-troll's accent sounds like?As for the storyline - the story of Beowulf was told orally long before it was written down and concretized in one form, so the license with the story seems quite appropriate to me, and a good way of updating the themes to resonate more with the complexities of our time.And, humor and drama CAN coexist, people.

And the CG ""actors"" were no better than the ""Final Fantasy"" movie done a decade ago. While the faces were ok the feet and hands looked cartoonish.The second strike was the deviation from the story.

1126310,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B0010V5SW8,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[1, 2]","When I was but a callow freshman my mother, an archetypal Danish monster*, meaning well, made me sign up for a Mediaeval English Literature class. At the time this aggrieved me, but despite myself I enjoyed it immensely, and especially the really old bits - derived from Icelandic and Old High German, prominent among themSnorri Sturluson's sagasin which people ritually burn each other and the anonymous Danish legendBeowulf. It's a great story, even in itsoriginal old English(which considerably pre-Chaucer, so tough if you have trouble navigating the vowel shift), and - being the archetypal ""confronting the Monster"" story - ideal fodder, you would think, for a cinematic treatment.And in recent times, it has had more than its fair share. Derek Jacobi and Ralph Fiennes have narrated a 30 minute animated version; Gerard Butler and a bunch of Canadians endured gales and abysmal weather in Iceland to make an earnest and frugal but, in truth,not especially imaginative versionin 2005. And there's this one.Well, you certainly couldn't mark this one down for not being imaginative. First the positives: the cast, as announced, is astounding, numbering amongst them Anthony Hopkins (Hrothgar), Ray Winstone (Beowulf), John Malkovich (some other guy) and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's Mother. Yes: you read that right: Brad Pitt's wife (as she then was) plays one of the most famous monsters in the history of literature. Short of aCharlize Theron turn as an Eileen Wurnostype character, that has to be one of the most extraordinary pieces of miscasting since they put Keanu Reeves inMuch Ado About Nothing.Unless, of course, the film-makers have been so imaginative that they've completely re-imagined the part of Grendel's mother. I hope it won't be considered poor sport of me to let on that they have.And the script is witty and the screenplay and staging - while frequently indulging in 3D effects for the hell of it, as 3D movies tend to do - is impressive. Grendel (junior) is well rendered and achieves surprising empathy for an entirely digital performance. I think he also speaks in Old High German, and is portrayed not as merriment-resenting curmudgeon (as in the original) but as having a very nasty ear infection!Now the negatives. Beowulf is designed as an onscreen rendering of a graphic novel (in old fashioned lingo, a comic), so do not come to this expecting a faithful or reverent iteration of the film. The plot has been significantly revised, although for the most part thoughtfully and cleverly, albeit conducted at breakneck speed, and with lashings of gore. Then again, it would be difficult to depict as much dismembering the story requires (even in its original state) without a fair bit of splatter.But the biggest thing to note is that (being produced by thePolar Expressteam) Beowulf is entirely digital - not just acted in front of blue screens, but fully animated, likeShrek; the actors have been completely re-rendered. In some cases this works well (Hrothgar): I dare say portly cockney geezer Ray Winstone was absolutely chuffed to be presented as a 6 foot 5 inches of rippling Geatish hunk; but the remainder of the characters do have an unfortunate Shrek-ish sort of bearing and their movements aren't especially convincing (particularly the horses, which all look rather stumpy and ponyish). Ultimately I found this immensely distracting to the point where it spoiled what otherwise would have been a tremendous film.There's a place for the technical wizardry, as Peter Jackson has ably demonstrated; but when it becomes the principal point of the film something is bound to have been lost.Olly Buxton*Joking about my mum being a Danish monster.

I paid four bucks for mine at the video store -- it was pre-played and in like-new condition.The technical stuff is that this film/DVD IS in widescreen and runs for 114 minutes. The film is un-rated (IMDB has it at PG-13, mostly for some mild nudity and sexual scenes which aren't very graphic.) There has been a lot of digital enhancement of this film, particularly to punctuate the action scenes and this feature has been well-done throughout. You might characterize it as semi-animation but it's not cartooney in any way and looks very realistic.WARNING: MINOR SPOILER HEAD!THE STORY: The time is 507 A.D. where Beowulf is a mighty heroic and pagan warrior who comes to the aid of the King of Denmark whose kingdom is plagued with periodic raids by the demon-monster Grendel. Grendel, a pathetic and violent gigantic creature who has a taste for human flesh and blood, is soon dealt with by Beowulf but Grendel's ""mother"" is much more formidable and she's really ticked off that Beowulf snuffed her offspring. The final two-thirds of the film deals with that conflict as well as with Beowulf's mercenary exploits.This 2007 film is loosely based upon the anonymous epic poem (written sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries) of the same title. The story is considered very important to Anglo-Saxon literature. In both the poem and the film Beowulf overcomes various mythical creatures which threaten humanity.I first saw this film, having borrowed the DVD from the local public library -- this was an inferior version, rendered in full-screen which I do not recommend. Watching this movie in the widescreen version on a widescreen television is a must.The two big stars include Ray Winstone as Beowulf (also terrific inHenry VIII) and Anthony Hopkins (a little known youthful performance here:War & Peace (1972)) as Hrothgar. The movie also stars John Malkovich and Angelina Jolie. The casting is excellent and the cinematography is equally terrific.While this film doesn't quite compare in magnificence toThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)I still thought it was even a little better thanEragon (Widescreen Edition).In any case, this fine film earned my highest rating.",5,Note the red graphics on the packaging -- a terrific film!

I didn't have high hopes, mainly because most of the 100% CGI adult oriented films have been lackluster at best.  But being a huge fan of the epic poem of Beowulf, how could I not watch it.I have found myself amongst the ""leave it"" crew.  The CGI was very good, but like all CGI, everyone moved just a hair too slowly, everyone appears to be ""creeping"" about.  All of the CGI characters were made to look exactly like the actors who voiced them so they might as well have just used real actors.  My main issue with this isn't the film itself, but rather that they turned the epic hero into such a louse that I was thrilled to death when he met his demise (if you didn't know he died, go back to 8th grade and read the poem)Certainly the true Beowulf, had he existed, would have been a flawed character, but they made him a loud mouthed, lying, bragging, womanizing buffoon of a man, easily duped and with little loyalty or ability to love.  He was so despicable to me that I almost didn't watch the end of the film.  Then the change in the story in regards to Grendal's mother and the Dragon... I know it was to tie everything in together but I would have been much happier had they stayed a little closer to the story that managed to survive for over a thousand or so years.  I know, let's remake the Odyssey and make Odysseus a pedophile! I know that's a bit extreme but that is how I felt after watching this travesty.  Had it not bore the name of Beowulf then I might have been able to tolerate this film.

1126325,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0010V5SW8,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[12, 16]","I absolutely adore CGI, moreso when CGI attempts to imitate real life. Having studied the original text of Beowulf for about five minutes, many years ago, I remember being decidedly underwhelmed by the epic poem - it just didn't capture my imagination - but I thought, well, the trailer for this movie looks astounding, and the moviemakers will probably have made some story changes to the original to lend it a more movie-friendly aspect.Sadly, none of the above really applies to this movie version of ""Beowulf"".Judging this as a movie in its own right, irrespective of the original poem, it's not very good. The first problem is with the visuals: Zemeckis' direction is excellent, really tense and exciting - but what he's showing us in these tense and exciting shots sort of looks a bit like a high-end episode of ""Thunderbirds"". It strikes me as most odd that they can make demons ooze slime and fire and water mimic reality to perfection... ...but they can't manage some simple facial animation? Mouths don't open properly, facial expressions are decidedly under-animated and many movements are glaringly out-of-place in their artificiality. Oh, and Grendel's mother: golden blow-up doll with organic stiletto heels and gravity-ignoring bosoms? What a joke.But stop! I hear you cry - this IS a cartoon, right?Wrong. ""Beowulf"" is trying its damnedest to look like reality: but when the sub-par Shrek The Third-style townspeople come along, the illusions of beautiful lighting and exquisitely crafted sets shatter, and we're very much aware that, at least visually, we're being cheated out of a proper connection with these characters.A sidebar: How is seeing a human penis, taken in context with the rest of the human body in motion, more upsetting than a malformed yellow pus-oozing demon tearing a screaming human being in half? I don't know the answer to that, but clearly Zemeckis thinks he does: and clearly, he took a good long look at the opening scenes of Austin Powers 2 before storyboarding the Beowulf-Grendel fight sequence in the banquet hall. The strategically-placed swords, soldiers, shadows and other assorted battleground debris to mask Beowulf's nudity actually just looks comical, and really tears the dramatic worth out of this most important of battle scenes. Badly done...Annihoo, onto the script: or what passes for a script in ""Beowulf"". The dialogue here is a sort of mishmash of archaic English, Danish and modern American English, produced in an array of U.S., British, Irish and Danish accents, and it's horribly jarring on the ears. The script itself is standard B-movie action fare (Neil Gaiman was accompanied by Silent Hill's Roger Avary, it's no surprise that parts of it are decidedly sub-par), and the plot, given the limited frame in which it has to work, is straightforward enough: vanilla, there are no surprises and few highs or lows with which to engage the viewer.The voice talents of the actors are neither brilliant nor awful.""Beowulf"" is very much a one-trick pony. When it's good, it's because of Zemeckis' breathtaking panoramas and some very well-shot battle sequences. When it's bad, and it is mostly bad, it's because of substandard character animation and some tacky, predictable scripting.If you're going to see it, see it on the big screen.

For some reason, it never fails to remind me just how saintly they must be in order to honor this status in life. Heroes must be public servants, in sense of duty, honor, and lifestyles. But it does not always work out that way, especaily with heroes of the distant past in origin. There are surprisingly a great amount of heroes who, in real life, were nothing short of despicable in conduct. That is why it is so drastically easy to condemn the heroes of today, because they live with fault in the public eye. Beowulf is such a man. A hero, true, but human nonetheless. And so lies the tale of a human who conquered the unconquerable, by using his animal instincts rather than sane negotiations for the good of mankind. This leaves alot of room for internal animal instinct showmanship, as the movie BEOWULF demonstrates in vast eagle eye splendor.The production is first rate, and the accomodating score lifts it to perfection, so much so, it rates right up there with movie classics. It's movements are slow, which is a sheer welcome pleasure after being bombarded by fast moving PIXAR animation, that feels it is a moral sin ro think between scenes. If the animation figures puts you off, then the revolutionary puppets in Thunderbirds must have drove you crazy.

BEOWULF is stunning in crystal clear, ultra sharp Imax 3D with its big wattage surround sound.  An epic adventure that has an incredible sense of mood and time and place. And a terrific, rousing score.However, what's missing is the heroic heart of this most ancient of English tales in a world where the friction between paganism and the liberation of primitive Christianity.Wonder why the screenwriters decide to suck the life blood from Beowulf and instead offer a not so subtle Christian-bashing subtext and a hero so flawed that he loses his legendary worth.And the final fight of a redemption-challenged hero with his own offspring is a bizarre, perhaps ludicrous, take on the original story.  As is Wiglaf's lingering temptation with a seductive Grendel.Even our 13 year old son, no doubt the target demographic for this film, was also disappointed with the movie.  He's read the poem and asked ""Why Wiglaf didn't throw an axe at Grendel's mom in the end.  Has Wiglaf learned nothing being Beowulf's best buddy all his life?"" Apparently not.Check out the movie in 3-D if you can find it. Or even see it on DVD if you must, then read Seamus Heaney's translation or better yet, listen to his amazing narrative CD.In our age of religious conflict, is it possible to have a flawed but morally principled hero who will risk all for not for the glory and the fame and the fortune, but to remove the evil that has befallen an enemy?That's the real question.

The poor animation quality of the film, however, forces me to downrate this otherwise excellent film.  Too bad because the story, both where it parallels the Anglo-Saxon classic and even where it diverges from it, is well worth watching.Hrothgar, as we all known, has a serious problem.  The monster, Grendel, raids his hall and slaughters his thanes.  Here we are let into the mystery and fear that our Anglo-Saxon ancestors regarded the misty unknown of the fen and marsh.  The film story diverges from the ancient tale in numerous important ways.  The poem is from the 7th Century, BEFORE the Angles, Saxons, Frisians, Jutes etc. actually invaded England in any significant way.  The story in this sense, although an Anglo-Saxon classic, is entirely pre-English, a memory of previous mysterious times.  The screenwriters take major liberties with the basic story.  They turn the story into a Viking tale.  Hrothgar and his savior, Beowulf, are thoroughly Viking figures making declarations about Norway, Denmark, Iceland [not 'discovered' by the Vikings until around 900 A.D.] and even Vinland [not discovered by the Vikings until around 1,000 AD.No problem.  We are actually far more familiar with the 'Vikings' than we are with pre-Viking Danes, Geats and Saxons, so the story strikes more chords in our memory.  Beowulf is the same boasting, vainglorious character that he is in the original tale...BUt...we are let into the 'secret' that Beowulf embellishes his stories plenty.  For you see, Beowulf, despite his strength, courage and beauty, is a very flawed hero just as was his predecessor, Hrothgar.Grendel is both terrible and wonderful.  Born of man and a shape-shifting witch, Grendel is huge, twisted and horrible.  Excluded from the society of men, he roams the trackless fen in helpless, moaning, weeping misery.  His pain is turned into hatred, violence and murder.  He slaughters Hrothgar's happy, reveling men.  If he can't be happy, himself, he will deprive others of happiness and life.  An interesting and brilliant touch is to put an old language in his throat--probably Old English or Old Norse [similar].Another brilliant touch is Beowulf's temptation by Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie.  The magnificent nude witch seduces Beowulf with promises of fame, eternal life, kingship, wealth, women and, especially, HER.  Beowulf is Christ in the Wilderness tempted by Satan.  Beowulf is Odysseus tempted by the witch, Circe.  Beowulf, however, is no Christ or Odysseus.

1126337,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B0010V5SW8,Royce Callaway,"[0, 1]","This is a good film -- a little draggy at times but the animation and 3D special effects make it more than worthwhile.  The first half of the film follows the story of Beowulf fairly closely in its interpretation of the story.  Grendel is a monstrous monster.  Hrothgar seems a little weaker than portrayed in the story but the original Beowulf is short on details and plot so clearly something had to be done -- hence the Queen is introduced and Hrothgar is cursed through his sexual intercourse with Grendel's mother. These are all additions to the story along with the water demon mother. The fact that Beowulf had supernatural strength is never mentioned so his epic wrestling match with Grendel comes across as weird and the nudity as gratuitous but this actually follows the story. I will say that this sequence is some of the weakest animation and reminded me of Yoda in his classic duel with Duku(sp).  Grendel is more pathetic and sad in this movie but still remains grotesque and evil.  Even though the original story has been bent and added to it still is a good movie, Beowulf was the braggart supperhero as described in the original but he truly was heroic there. The sea monsters were added clearly for the special effects although Beowulf does brag that he killed them in the original story.  The Vikings and the Mead Hall really brought the story to life and were a good interpretation of how it must have been and certainly follows the description in the original.  In this version Beowulf succumbs to temptation and lives a life based on a lie so his heroism is tarnished and he never redeems it because he only kills the spawn of Grendels mother.  In the original story of course he kills the Dragon who is Grendels mother.  So the movie deviates dramatically from the original story but like 300, it is action packed, exciting, great special effects, and overall a good movie, but students shouldn't rely on this for a book report.

Then again, I only read theCliffs Notes, so I guess that I can't really speak first hand...but Director Robert Zemekcis probably can and does in the DVD extras.Blood. Evisceration. Decapitation. Sex. Oh...the horror! I watched the unrated version of the film, and I can only imagine what they had to chop out of this excellent movie in order to get a PG-13 for the theaters.What a pleasant surprise Beowulf (unrated) was on several fronts.First, as we sat down to watch, I had no idea that Zemeckis was at it again with live action/motion capture-animation (as he did withThe Polar Express). The technology for Beowulf is even better than it was for The Polar Express, because it was often hard to tell that you were seeing animation. The pleasant surprise here was how much I still enjoyed this 'cartoon' of sorts.Second, this movie was genuinely frightening at times. The story starts in 500-something AD with the hideous monster Grendel attacking a small Danish kingdom gathering hall. Did I say attacking? I meant *violently* attacking. And remember, this looks very real at times...not like a 'cartoon' at all. The first scene drove my youngest out of the room on her own will not to return; my middle guy often shielded his eyes; and my 9 year old thought it was 'wicked'. The rest of the story is that of Beowulf's quest to rid the kingdom of the cursed monster, its mother and the consequences (and rewards) of failure to do so (correctly...or should I say ethically).Finally, well, it was just a great movie!The cast includes animation over computer generated images of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn, and Crispin Glover (among some other notables that I've neglected to note). I rarely watch extras on a DVD, but the 23-minute 'making of' for Beowulf is worth it; you get to see some of the cast in their ""computer suits"" and you also get some amazing looks at just how Beowulf was put together.Fans of fantasy and folklore should not pass on this DVD.

The battle with Grendel is preserved, as is Beowulf's final duel with the dragon, but Grendel's mother plays a very different role than the sea hag of legend. Portrayed by Angelina Jolie, who is rendered even more ""voluptuous"" than she is in real-life, Grendel's mother is more a siren than a monster, seducing one hero after another with her beauty and golden promises.All of this serves to create the necessary character ""arc"" for Beowulf to follow, something which is missing from the original legend's depiction of Beowulf as paragon of masculine virtue. While the update adds a layer of depth to the lead character it also creates a few weak links elsewhere. Chief among these is Beowulf's sudden inheritance of Hrothar's entire kingdom, including his wife, the queen. These shortcomings are overshadowed by the fantastic special effects and glorious action sequences, and overall the new material renders the story more mature and makes the ending more satisfying for modern audiences.The film is entirely computer animated which gives the film the freedom to dwell in the realm of fantasy. The characters are rendered in extraordinary detail, although you will notice a few unnatural  movements here and there. Occasionally the liberties taken with the special effects seem absurd, Grendel's mother for instance, has feet with a natural set of stiletto heels growing from the soles.

I read it in ninth grade and visualized every moment of it as though watching grand cinema (for frames of reference, watch the Id Monster attack in Forbidden Planet, and tell me it doesn't seem inspired by the battles in the Mead Hall in Beowulf).  This lusty, violent version serves best as an adaptation, getting some of the look right but taking too many liberties with both the plot and the look of Grendel and its mother.  I don't find them an improvement.  While Beowulf was a classic hero -- strong, courageous, sacrificing -- he is more of a swaggering loudmouth in this version.  A great captain in the poem, here he is reduced to the dirty, long-haired guy who rides a Harley Davidson and picks fights with strangers in bars.  To me, classic heroes are harder to pull off than the angsty, imperfect ones we have today, and maybe that's why they're avoided so often in modern cinema (and also so completely tedious).  As a standalone with no connection to the poem, Beowulf could work, as it's reasonably well crafted and paced, but as a film of an epic poem, it leaves too much to be desired.

The rest of this review will focus solely upon actual video and audio quality of the blu ray.VIDEO....Deliberately so, the film uses a rich and warm color palate highly CGI'd throughout the film.  The CGI is not just for the many special effects but the actors themselves have had a cartooning filter placed upon them for an animated look.  The blacks do go deep and contrast is quite excellent even in the softer and darker scenes.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the low 30's.  At no point did I see any artifacting or resolution noise.  Being wholly CGI, you wouldn't expect any film issues since all is digital and, with this film on Blu Ray, you don't get any.Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV  monitor you are using and its accompanying  home theater processor and speakers.  I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.AUDIO....The film does default to a lossy audio codec so before watching the film, go to 'Set Up' and change the audio setting to the lossless 5.1 Dolby True HD audio setting.  The audio does make decent use of your surround system with all encompassing audio soundtrack.  However, there is really not a whole lot of discreet channeling to the individual front or rear speakers.  There is some but not as much as I expected.EXTRAS...There are plenty of quality extras included on the disc; there are various 'Making of' docs focusing upon special fx creation, costuming, the art of making and producing the film, some deleted scenes in HD and more.  Also included is an Ultra Violet version of the theatrical release.  I would rather have the choice to download to iTunes as I really do not like UV but it is what it is.While I am glad I found this for only 7.99, I do not think I will be watching it too often nor using it for a demo disc to show off my theater.  I do hope that this review has been of some HELP  to you in deciding your purchase.  All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the actual disc and not redundant summaries and acting opinions.Thanks for reading.Okay folks, as much as I hate UV, I went to log in  and download the film any way.

First off, Zemekis has taken way too much liberty with the source material (the portrayal of Grendel's mom and some other less needed story elements).  Beowulf's relations with Grendel's mom is very inaccurately portrayed, along with the final revelation in the film which is really not present in the original story.  In order to flesh out and pad a relatively straight forward story of a hero, Zemekis has managed to create a wasted opportunity with extraneous plot none-sense.Beyond that, this film still suffers from the zombie-eye cg puppet syndrome ailing all of the director's motion captured films (though less creepy than the now famous Polar express).

1126362,A3B87UZLPCF0HW,B0010V5SW8,"Tanis ""Tanis Yvonne Somerville""","[6, 7]","Based on the anonymous 700AD poem, Beowulf tells the story of the titular hero (Winstone) who lands in Denmark in 507AD to rid the country of its scourge - the monster Grendel (Crispin Glover). Beowulf slays Grendel, but his attempt to kill its mother (Jolie) comes unstuck when her beauty muddies his clarity. Zemeckis picks up where he left off with 2004's The Polar Express and delivers a fascinating looking animated film (this reviewer was lucky enough to see it in Scotland where the screening was in 3D but unfortunately this won't be the case everywhere). Where the story is thin on the ground, Zemeckis's visuals more than make up for it and the film is a treat from start to finish. The 12A rating is puzzling, however, as ultra violence (including dismemberment), nudity and a genuinely freaky-looking monster are all to the fore. Maybe the fact that Beowulf is animation swayed the IFCO, but the characters are so realistic - Gleeson looks like Gleeson, Hopkins looks like Hopkins, Jolie looks like Jolie but, oddly, Winstone looks like Sean Bean - it certainly goes some way to blur the lines between fantasy and reality.

1126363,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B0010V5SW8,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[1, 1]","Anyone who knows me has heard me rant in regards to last year's Beowulf. A huge fan of the original epic (I've done several papers on it) and an even bigger fan of Neil Gaiman's work, I was looking forward to the movie more than anything else in its timeframe of release. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver.The story of Beowulf is simple enough, and anyone who has taken a middle school English class knows how it goes, so I won't bore you with the details. Suffice it to say that Beowulf is a big bad warrior full of talk, and through a series of events finds himself killing the monster Grendel. Told that he now has to slay Grendel's mother--the last monster--Beowulf sets off, but finds that it's not as easy as it sounds and is seduced by the promise of everlasting glory and riches. Years go by, and Beowulf's land continues to prosper, until finally in his old age he's forced to confront the monster he succumbed to long ago in order to save himself and his people.It's the most traditional of the hero archetypes, and Gaiman did an admirable job of adapting it to film. In the same regard, though, Beowulf is a film that just can't possibly capture our imagination after hearing the original tale. The imagery in the epic isn't fleshed out enough (like Lord of the Rings) to easily translate to the screen, and thus our mental imagery of Beowulf's journey will forever be the truest one.That being said, Beowulf is still a good movie, and the most impressive visual specimen I've ever seen. Zemeckis went above and beyond any CGI film to date, and Beowulf is so close to being real that many people will swear it is even after knowing it was CGI. (My friends didn't know it was animated from the trailers until I told them it was when we went to see it.) It's a poetically beautiful event that the oldest English tale is now the newest technological feat in film. In addition to being breathtaking eyecandy, the Beowulf DVD features some of the better special features I've seen in quite a while. After watching DVDs like Death at a Funeral and other recent movies with special features consisting purely of a gag reel and trailers, it's a breath of fresh air.Most of the special features are short (only two are longer than 5 minutes), but they all provide a pivotal look into the world behind the movie, and the technology behind the film. There's a thing to educate people on Beowulf, The Art of Beowulf, and a short feature on designing the creatures featured in the film. Most importantly, though, is A Hero's Journey: The Making of Beowulf. This documentary showcases how they made the film, and the painstaking methods behind it. Anyone considering animated films child's play will do well to watch this featurrette. The mocap sessions are awesome, and seeing the actors realize that they'll have to not only read their lines -- but act them out -- for virtual characters is priceless.One thing I'd like to note at the end of this review is the uncensored director's cut portion of the DVD. While watching the movie I noticed absolutely nothing new or changed from the theatrical release I saw twice. A friend claimed that a scene or two was a few seconds longer, but I'm still not too convinced. If you expect tons of extra scenes and carnage, look elsewhere, because this is more or less the movie as seen in theaters last year.CONTENT - 2.5/5The movie itself is mediocre at best. As an exercise of technological achievement it's fantastic; as a modern take on the classic Beowulf tale it's no better than Beowulf vs. Grendel.VIDEO - 5/5Is it as amazing as seeing it in 3D? Nah. Of course not. It's still the most impressive animated feature I've ever seen though, bar none. The CGI is breathtaking, and it's astounding how far we've come since Toy Story. If you haven't seen it, check Beowulf out to at least see the future of filmmaking and where we'll be going.AUDIO - 5/5The 5.1 sound is breathtaking, even if the voice acting isn't that great. Beowulf truly is an audio and visceral treat to behold for fans of films or those with a big TV and speakers set up.EXTRAS - 4/5The documentary behind the making of Beowulf is great, and the rest is good enough. When you get a documentary good enough to watch even if you didn't enjoy the movie, that's when you know you've done a good job.REPLAY - 2.5/5If you love it, you'll watch it again, much like I've watched 300 several times already. For most people though Beowulf is a once-and-done treat, watched for the advance in movie technology and ignored later for the lack of a good coherent narrative compared to the source material.OVERALL - 4.5/5The movie is lacking, but everything else about the Beowulf DVD more than makes up for it. Awesome video and audio, awesome extras, and spectacular computer animation make an otherwise TV-only movie worth at least a rent. For fans of 300 and other similar movies, this is a must-own.",5,Watch it for the spectacle and technical achievement,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,4904,"['Anyone', 'who', 'heard', 'rant', 'regards',

1126364,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B0010V5SW8,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[6, 9]","Like the beating bass that runs throughout the musical score of Robert Zemekis' adaptation of Beowulf, the computer animated epic will get your blood pumping. While not a flawless film, Beowulf has accomplished something great. Not only has Zemekis proved that animation can transcend audiences, assaulting viewers with its fiery adult content, but with Beowulf he proves that there are still new discoveries to be found in filmmaking.Adapted from the Seventh century epic poem, Beowulf (Ray Winstone) tells the story of a legendary Viking hero who arrives on Danish shores to purge the kingdom of a horrid monster, Grendel (Crispin Glover). However Grendel is far from the darkest creature plaguing the countryside, and Beowulf soon encounters a being far more manipulative, promising through its treacherous evil hedonistic pleasures of lust, riches, strength and power. Like King Hagarth before him, Beowulf's greed plunges the kingdom into misery and darkness, forcing the unrelenting warrior to atone for his sins in order to protect what he holds true in his heart.The challenge facing screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery seemed monumental. Translating the dense, highly symbolic tale into mainstream, popcorn entertainment will most likely cause 7th grade English teachers to cringe, but with their tight adaptation and Zemeckis' brilliant vision, Beowulf comes to life in a way that not only anyone can enjoy, but will leave audiences absolutely astounded.Structurally the film doesn't flow as smoothly as other modern epics, like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy; in fact the film's opening is rather jerky. It isn't until the first appearance of the title character that the narrative begins to settle, after which point the picture becomes as grand as the legend it was based on.While the performances are solid, especially Ray Winstone's captivating presence as Beowulf, one can't help but feel there was something lost in translation after the layer of computer animation was applied to the actors. While Zemeckis has honed his technology, correcting many of the mistakes found in Polar Express, there is one thing the motion capture process has still not been able to capture, and that is the emotive presence of an actor's eyes.While a stage performance requires projection of emotion, film is far more capable of capturing the subtleties of human expression. However it seems that each character in Beowulf possesses no life behind their brilliantly illustrated eyes, seeming more like something out of Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum than living, breathing characters.However, the real heart of Beowulf doesn't get its pulse from its otherwise fine animation, but rather the brilliant and imaginative use of the third dimension. Like the mythical warrior, audiences should fight their way to see this film in digital, 3D projection. Being the first film to truly be designed from the ground up to take advantage of new 3D technology, Beowulf will leave audiences floored. This is not your parent's 3D; this is something wholly new, and seeing a seasoned filmmaker like Zemeckis take advantage of the extra dimension is a joy for anyone who has ever found pleasure in going to the movies.A visual masterpiece that will tantalize audiences with its stunning presentation, Beowulf makes up for its narrative flaws by creating an experience the moviegoer has never seen before. If Beowulf accomplishes nothing else, it will inevitably spark the imaginations of filmmakers both young and old, opening an avenue for an exciting new chapter in cinematic history.- Joe Russo, [...]",4,Beowulf Movie Review,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,3601,"['beating', 'bass', 'musical', 'score', 'Robert', 'Zemekis', 'adaptation', 'Beowulf', 'computer', 'animated', 'epic', 'will', 'get', 'blood', 'pumping', 'not', 'flawless', 'film', 'Beowulf', 'accomplished', 'something', 'great', 'Not', 'only', 'Zemekis', 'proved', 'animation', 'can', 'transcend', 'audiences', 'assaulting', 'viewers', 'fiery', 'adult', 'content', 'Beowulf', 'are', 'still', 'new', 'discoveries', 'be', 'found', 'filmmaking.Adapted', 'Seventh', 'century', 'epic', 'poem', 'Beowulf', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'story', 'legendary', 'Viking', 'hero', 'who', 'Danish', 'shores', 'purge', 'kingdom', 'horrid', 'monster', 'Grendel', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'However', 'Grendel', 'far', 'darkest', 'creature', 'plaguing', 'countryside', 'Beowulf', 'soon', 'being', 'far', 'more', 'manipulative', 'promising', 'treacherous', 'evil', 'hedonistic', 'pleasures', 'lust', 'riches', 'strength', 'power', 'King', 'Hagarth', 'Beowulf', 'greed', 'kingdom', 'misery', 'darkness', 'forcing', 'unrelenting', 'warrior', 'atone', 'sins', 'order', 'protect', 'what', 'true', 'heart.The', 'challenge', 'facing', 'screenwriters', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'Roger', 'Avery', 'seemed', 'monumental', 'Translating', 'dense', 'highly', 'symbolic', 'tale', 'mainstream', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'cause', '7th', 'grade', 'English', 'teachers', 'cringe', 'tight', 'adaptation', 'Zemeckis', 'brilliant', 'vision', 'Beowulf', 'life', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'will', 'leave', 'audiences', 'absolutely', 'astounded.Structurally', 'film', ""n't"", 'flow', 'as', 'smoothly', 'other', 'modern', 'epics', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'fact', 'film', 'opening', 'rather', 'jerky', ""n't"", 'first', 'appearance', 'title', 'character', 'narrative', 'begins', 'settle', 'point', 'picture', 'as', 'grand', 'legend', 'was', 'based', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'especially', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'captivating', 'presence', 'Beowulf', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'there', 'was', 'something', 'lost', 'translation', 'layer', 'computer', 'animation', 'was', 'applied', 'actors', 'Zemeckis', 'honed', 'technology', 'correcting', 'many', 'mistakes', 'found', 'Polar', 'Express', 'one', 'thing', 'motion', 'capture', 'process', 'still', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'capture', 'emotive', 'presence', 'actor', 'eyes.While', 'stage', 'performance', 'projection', 'emotion', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'capable', 'capturing', 'subtleties', 'human', 'expression', 'However', 'character', 'Beowulf', 'life', 'brilliantly', 'illustrated', 'eyes', 'seeming', 'more', 'something', 'Madame', 'Tussaud', 'Wax', 'Museum', 'living', 'breathing', 'characters.However', 'real', 'heart', 'Beowulf', ""n't"", 'get', 'pulse', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'animation', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'imaginative', 'use', 'third', 'dimension', 'mythical', 'warrior', 'audiences', 'should', 'fight', 'way', 'see', 'film', 'digital', '3D', 'projection', 'Being', 'first', 'film', 'truly', 'be', 'designed', 'ground', 'up', 'take', 'advantage', 'new', '3D', 'technology', 'Beowulf', 'will', 'leave', 'audiences', 'floored', 'not', 'parent', '3D', 'something', 'wholly', 'new', 'seeing', 'seasoned', 'filmmaker', 'Zemeckis', 'take', 'advantage', 'extra', 'dimension', 'joy', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'found', 'pleasure', 'going', 'movies.A', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'tantalize', 'audiences', 'stunning', 'presentation', 'Beowulf', 'up', 'narrative', 'flaws', 'creating', 'experience', 'moviegoer', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Beowulf', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'inevitably', 'spark', 'imaginations', 'filmmakers', 'young', 'old', 'opening', 'avenue', 'exciting', 'new', 'chapter', 'cinematic', 'history.-', 'Joe', 'Russo', '[', ']']",N/A

1126367,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0010V5SW8,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 21]","I didn't buy ""Beowulf"" for one minute.Director Robert Zemeckis, who built his career making enjoyable films like ""Back to the Future"", ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""Forrest Gump"", has been exploring the realm of computer animated films recently. He has even gone so far as to develop new technology so he can more convincingly capture actors portraying the characters he then has animated. His first foray into this field was ""The Polar Express"" in which Tom Hanks played a number of characters and all of the children in the film looked like soulless zombies. In ""Monster House"", the technology was used to better effect because the characters were highly stylized and looked like animated characters. They weren't trying to be real, so we buy into the scenario more readily. Now with ""Beowulf"", Zemeckis' uses Ray Winston, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn, Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich to portray various characters in this completely computer generated universe. The characters look like the actors playing them, but they still move with the jerky movements common to video game characters and they still have that soulless zombie look in their eyes. My question is if you are going to go to the trouble to try to make Ray Winston look like Ray Winston (with the use of a body double), and Angelina Jolie look like Angelina Jolie, why not just use the actors in front of animated backgrounds, ala ""Sin City"" or ""300""?It's strange that Zemeckis, who began his career making such fun and enjoyable films, starring personable actors (Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner) now chooses to make completely lifeless films using a technology replacing the very likable actors with pale facsimiles of themselves (Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright Penn).The story begins with a party in a remote Danish kingdom. King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) are having a celebration, but the king has become very inebriated and seems to disgust his younger wife. Their merriment causes the great beast Grendel (Crispin Glover) to awake, his head pounding with the noise, a noise he must stop, so he attacks the village, killing many. Distraught, Hrothgar hopes for a miracle and promises his kingdom to whoever can slay Grendel. Enter Beowulf (Ray Winston and a body double). Beowulf treks to Grendel's lair and slays him, but now he has to deal with Grendel's mother, a dangerous beast who takes the form of a beautiful woman (Angelina Jolie) who vows revenge. She tempts Beowulf and they eventually battle. When Beowulf returns, Hrothgar makes him king, as promised, and gives him Wealthow as his wife. Then Beowulf must deal with other forces.Much like ""Sin City"" and ""300"", the use of computer animation is a really great method of recreating a land and time long ago. In this case, the filmmakers use this technology to create the remote, snowy Danish vistas of yesteryear. And the work is interesting to look at. Remote huts and community buildings look interesting and add some interest to the story. These same sets would cost a fortune to recreate and would probably not look as authentic as they do in this film, so creating them with CGI is a necessity.But because much of this film takes place in caves, or on snowy plains, the film retains a `cartoony' look, resembling a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Really, some of the scenes in the film look like the background keeps repeating. This is not a good thing when a film is trying to be hyper-realistic.Zemeckis has spent a lot of time developing technology to make this type of filmmaking more realistic. Basically, they put an actor in a suit covered with tiny transmitters. They film the actor acting out a scene. They import the scene into a computer and the computer tracks these tiny emitters as the actor moves. This allows the animator to add clothes, costumes, backgrounds, while the movement of the character remains `natural'. Zemeckis has developed this technology to add facial expressions to the mix, something they were previously only able to do in limited doses. Unfortunately, it didn't work very well in ""Polar Express"", making all the children resemble zombies. In ""Monster House"", it was better. In ""Beowulf"", the facial expressions are a bit blank again. The characters certainly look like the actors they are playing, but the expressions seem a little off, the eyes a little vacant. I really think this has to do with the fact these are real actors playing the characters. The technology seemed to work in ""Monster House"", but that was because the characters were less realistic and cartoonier. In the two films where the characters are supposed to be more realistic, they appear more like avatars in a video game. Speaking of avatars, James Cameron is reportedly developing his own technology for his next film, ""Avatar"", due in 2009.Equally important are the character's body movements. In ""Beowulf"", the characters seem to move stiffly and even in a jittery fashion at some points. It just isn't convincing and makes everything seem more like a videogame. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was an ad for a Wii game.Okay, let's put these things aside for a moment and address the story. The main conflict, the battle between Anjelina Jolie's character and Ray Winstone's happens in the second act. This leaves a lot of time, too much time, for the story to meander and try to paint a picture of Beowulf and a younger woman (Allison Lohman) having an affair, while Wealthow (Penn) looks on. Yawn. Then, the filmmakers seem to realize they need to have a climatic ending and throw in another battle. At this point, it just makes the film seem long. Too long.The 3-D technology has improved greatly. Disney is doing some interesting things with this technology and has made a new film ""Meet the Robinsons"" and re-released ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" with this technology. These new films look like they are truly 3-D, gone are the lines and shadows we used to have when this technology was first introduced in the mid 50s. There was a trailer for the first live-action 3-D film using this technology, next summers ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" starring Brendan Fraser. It looks like an interesting idea, but the clips they showed in the trailer make the actors look flat as they traverse a 3-D landscape, much like the characters in Zemeckis' ""Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"".Film wouldn't be where it is today without filmmakers experimenting and creating things like Panavision, THX, Roadshow presentations, 3-D and CGI to enhance their own films. Because of these advancements, we have had the pleasure of watching new films that could one day be considered classics, films like ""Sin City"", ""300"" and ""Batman Begins"". Without the development of the water creature in ""The Abyss"", we would never have had the amazing special effects used to create the Terminator in ""Terminator 2."" In a way, the work of Ray Harryhausen on films like ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" led to the amazing special effects used in ""The Matrix"". It seems difficult at this point to imagine, but perhaps, perhaps, one day the work Zemeckis is currently putting into these films and this technology may one day lead to some enjoyable, memorable films.But right now, we have ""Beowulf"", which is anything but. Enjoyable and memorable that is.",1,Interesting Idea - But Not A Great Movie - Far From It,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,7376,"['did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Beowulf', 'one', 'minute.Director', 'Robert',

1126368,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B0010V5SW8,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[13, 18]","More likeFinal Fantasy - The Spirits Withinthan300, Beowulf is the latest entry into the new geek-cinema-dom. That's to say that it comes to the screen looking like an adolescent's fantasy of medieval times, complete with operatic bellowing ala ""300"" and goofy menacing monsters likeThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but offering none of the virtues of either. Instead, you get a few barely recognizable actors offering voice talents (Ray Winstone, Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins) as plastic looking simulacrums from motion capture animation constructs their characters.As in ""Final Fantasy,"" these characters look more like plastic He-Man and Barbie dolls, lacking much for facial expression and skin features. ""But it's a cartoon,"" you doth protest? Well, yes and no. The animators here went to great pains to make this look like live action. Like most prominent CGI features nowadays, star talent is given headline status and much ado is made over Angelina Jolie. She plays Grendel's Mother, who tricks Beowulf into his eternal rule over the Danes. (Except in the original poem, she's dead before the story gets this far.) She is also a CGI-artist's wet dream, emerging from the water with just a touch of gold dripping from her enhanced chest like some exaggerated Bond Girl. It screams of testosterone wankesterisms on the part of the animator who turned the character into an image from a bad Frank Frazetta painting.And that about sums up everything about ""Beowulf."" The animation is aimed directly to the crowd that thinks the Halo and Doom games are the ultimate in realism, and made by directors that (much like the almost as dreadfulTroy, which at least kept the actors human) think a centuries old story needs to be deconstructed because a modern audience probably could care less about that stuffy ancient literature.There is also something else bent about ""Beowulf."" The violence is graphic and even disturbing (like the soldier that Grendel tears in half), yet a naked Beowulf - even an animated one - goes though all sorts of ridiculous machinations to not display his endowment? C'mon already, even Bart Simpson bared it, and at least his preposterous barricades were funny. There have not been this many wiener-blockers in a single take since Austin Powers. With all the raging hyper-violent testosterone flying about this movie (and the scene in question) this reeks of cop-out. It may be a movie all about Beowulf The Brave, but this contradiction heralds it as a movie made by Robert Zemeckis the Coward.You want to see this done right? SeeBeowulf & Grendel, a live action film starring (oddly enough) 300's Gerard Butler. It is everything ""Beowulf"" is not; subtle, populated by humans, not garish, taking a few liberties with the story yet leaving the core intact. Zemeckis should have been chained to a chair and forced to watch this version before embarking on yet another failed realization of an historical epic.",2,Wulf Howler,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,2939,"['More', 'likeFinal', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Withinthan300', 'Beowulf', 'latest', 'entry', 'new', 'geek-cinema-dom', 'say', 'screen', 'looking', 'adolescent', 'fantasy', 'medieval', 'times', 'complete', 'operatic', 'bellowing', 'ala', '300', 'goofy', 'menacing', 'monsters', 'likeThe', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Trilogy', 'offering', 'none', 'virtues', 'Instead', 'get', 'few', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'offering', 'voice', 'talents', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'plastic', 'looking', 'simulacrums', 'motion', 'capture', 'animation', 'characters.As', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'characters', 'look', 'more', 'like', 'plastic', 'He-Man', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'lacking', 'much', 'facial', 'expression', 'skin', 'features', 'cartoon', 'doth', 'protest', 'Well', 'yes', 'animators', 'here', 'went', 'great', 'pains', 'make', 'look', 'live', 'action', 'most', 'prominent', 'CGI', 'features', 'nowadays', 'star', 'talent', 'given', 'headline', 'status', 'much', 'ado', 'made', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Grendel', 'Mother', 'who', 'Beowulf', 'eternal', 'rule', 'Danes', 'original', 'poem', 'dead', 'story', 'far', 'also', 'CGI-artist', 'wet', 'dream', 'emerging', 'water', 'just', 'touch', 'gold', 'dripping', 'enhanced', 'chest', 'exaggerated', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'testosterone', 'wankesterisms', 'part', 'animator', 'who', 'turned', 'character', 'image', 'bad', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'painting.And', 'sums', 'up', 'everything', 'Beowulf', 'animation', 'aimed', 'directly', 'crowd', 'Halo', 'Doom', 'games', 'are', 'ultimate', 'realism', 'made', 'directors', 'much', 'almost', 'dreadfulTroy', 'least', 'kept', 'actors', 'human', 'think', 'centuries', 'old', 'story', 'be', 'deconstructed', 'modern', 'audience', 'probably', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'stuffy', 'ancient', 'also', 'something', 'else', 'bent', 'Beowulf', 'violence', 'graphic', 'even', 'disturbing', 'soldier', 'Grendel', 'half', 'yet', 'naked', 'Beowulf', 'even', 'animated', 'one', 'sorts', 'ridiculous', 'machinations', 'not', 'display', 'endowment', ""C'mon"", 'already', 'even', 'Bart', 'Simpson', 'bared', 'least', 'preposterous', 'barricades', 'were', 'funny', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'many', 'wiener-blockers', 'single', 'take', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'raging', 'hyper-violent', 'testosterone', 'flying', 'movie', 'scene', 'question', 'reeks', 'cop-out', 'may', 'be', 'movie', 'Beowulf', 'Brave', 'contradiction', 'movie', 'made', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Coward.You', 'want', 'see', 'done', 'right', 'SeeBeowulf', 'Grendel', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'starring', 'oddly', 'enough', '300', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'everything', 'Beowulf', 'not', 'subtle', 'populated', 'humans', 'not', 'garish', 'taking', 'few', 'liberties', 'story', 'yet', 'leaving', 'core', 'intact', 'Zemeckis', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'chained', 'chair', 'forced', 'watch', 'version', 'embarking', 'yet', 'failed', 'realization', 'historical', 'epic']",N/A
1126369,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0010V5SW8,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","Beowulf uses the same style of motion-capture animation that Director Robert Zemeckis employed in The Polar Express. The film is based upon the epic Saxon poem, written around the 8th century. While it has become a national treasure in England, its setting and characters are actually Scandinavian. The film is only loosely based on the poem although I doubt there are many who have read the epic, as it's a bit of a laborious read, even with a modern translation.The film opens in Heorot, the great hall of Danish King Hrothgar. The aged, rotund King (Hopkins) and his men are celebrating a victory in battle. Hrothgar stumbles about drunkenly, and near naked. His men sing the praises of their King but their exuberance is interrupted by the arrival of the monster Grendel who literally crashes the party, killing nearly everyone on the hall yet strangely unwilling to fight Hrothgar, even when challenged. The King offers half his fortune to any man who can kill Grendel but none who venture to haunted moors where the beast lives, ever return.The legendary hero Beowulf (Winstone) arrives with a company of his soldiers and promises to slay the giant. He is not all bravado as he succeeds in his task but is faced with the even more daunting task of slaying Grendel's unnamed mother (Jolie).The first impression of Beowulf's character in the film is that he is, frankly, a bit of a prick. He's arrogant and prideful, and loves to boast about his deeds. He's not above hitting on Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) even when the King is nearby. He even lies through his teeth about killing Grendel's mother although the King sees through the lie and knows what truly happen when the hero encountered the demonic she-creature. Ultimately though, Beowulf does redeem himself. With Hrothgar having no heir, he proclaims that Beowulf will be the new King upon his death. Many years later, an aged Beowulf must be the hero one more time to rescue his kingdom from a fire-breathing dragon, the latest offspring of Grendel's mother.The motion-capture in Beowulf is leagues ahead of Polar Express.  While Express was a fantasy and could be excused for a lot of whimsy, this film had to go for a grittier, more realistic look.  Everything from the character's movements and facial expressions to the lighting and shadows, and depth of texturing was breathtaking.  In particular, the Grendel character was perhaps the most intriguing.  He is a broken, twisted, and deformed monster.  Every moment of his pitiful life is painful.  Even the mirthful singing of Hrothgar's men was torment to his ears.  Crispin Glover plays the role of Grendel with spastic ingenuity.  Jolie was just creepy no matter how #D animated naked she happened to be...Hopkins seemed to relish his role King, gleefully prancing about in the opening scenes much to the embarrassment of his Queen.  Brendan Gleeson also stood out as Beowulf's second-in-command, Wilglaf.  The fine Irish character actor always brings a strong presence to every performance.Certain liberties were taken with the script.  In the original tale Beowulf returns to his homeland where he becomes King as opposed to taking Hrothgar's crown.  As pointed out in one of the featurettes, this was done to forward the continuity of the film.  And while I understand that a film does need conflict and all, I just didn't like the attempt to make Beowulf a flawed hero.It's not a perfect, or even great film.  There's not a lot of time expended in developing characters, particularly Grendel's mother who we learn almost nothing about.  It's an exciting film, bloodier than one may think and visually arresting.  While the motion-capture process will never replace actual live film, in moderation and with the right material, they can be first-rate entertainment.

1126373,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0010V5SW8,Tom Benton,"[2, 3]","BEOWULF may be the most mis-advertised movie of the year.  The ads made it look like a CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) adventure for young adults, some sort of 300 for kids.  Actually, Robert Zemeckis' spin on the classic medieval adventure tale of heroism is a grotesque and frightening picture.It's also the most intense PG-13 in recent memory; probably the fact that it appears to be an animated movie saved it from an R rating.  It shouldn't have, though, because the more adventurous parents taking their kids to see the courageous Beowulf slay the dragon are going to feel like slaying themselves when they see the horrifying, shrieking Grendel (voiced by Crispin Glover), who rips apart most of the villagers in the astounding opening sequence, or when Grendel's mother, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Angelina Jolie, emerges naked from a pool, her naughty bits very, very thinly disguised by specklings of gold.  This is not the bedtime story your parents told you when you were young.  This is the nightmare that came after it.Truthfully, adults may get more out of the film than children.  It's as much a hopelessly grim morality tale as it is a twisted adventure.  While the kids may be swept away to a land which even Tim Burton would rather avoid, the older members of the audience will be more focused upon the perverse, alienating sexuality which fuels the film.  With this in mind, Jolie is perfectly cast: it's entirely believable that no man can resist her, since, after all, she is among the most gorgeous women who ever lived.  That's why it's all the more terrifying when virtually every man in the movie gives in to her without hesitation - because one can't help but wonder if anyone could resist her.  If there's a message behind BEOWULF, it's that we're all slaves to our own erotic fantasies.  How's that for a new take on the story?It's actually Jolie's naked body which steals the film, although the motion-capture animation was seeking this effect.  The animation has its pros and cons.  On the downside, the film would probably be taken a little more seriously if it was genuine live-action; but on the upside, the animation, which is only a few steps away from looking wholly real, adds a darker sense of fantasy to an already pitch-black picture.  Many have begun proclaiming this motion capture technology as the future of the entertainment industry: after all, one can utilize shots impossible with live-action footage, or age an actor effortlessly and realistically.  Zemeckis is on that boat: he made his first all-CGI picture in 2004, THE POLAR EXPRESS, and he has shown little desire to return to live-action photography.  With this totally-CGI technology, literally anything is possible.  That'll be an exciting thought for some, and a terrifying one for others.Most of the characters look exactly like the actors that portray them, with the exception of Ray Winstone (playing Beowulf), who looks considerably less rough n' buff in reality.  That doesn't mean he can't roar like a beast, which he does incessantly throughout the film.  Backing him up: Robin Wright Penn as his queen, slender and angelic, and Anthony Hopkins as the king, who has a dark secret.  It's amazing that the CGI imagery can even capture that wise, tired glint in his eye.  Brendan Gleeson plays as his noble and loyal sidekick (last seen in HARRY POTTER as Mad-Eye Moody) and John Malkovich plays a priest, dryly, of course.  Lastly, Alison Lohman plays Beowulf's guilty, dedicated human mistress.The script, written by noted sci-fi/fantasy writer Neil Gaiman and Quentin Tarantino's old pal Roger Avary (with whom he co-wrote PULP FICTION), has been circulating since 1997, not because it isn't good but because it's not so good without a visual director to bring it to life.  That the director is the man who brought us FORREST GUMP, BACK TO THE FUTURE, and CAST AWAY might seem strange - until one considers some of his other projects, like 1992's black comedy DEATH BECOMES HER, or his frequent involvement with the classic HBO horror series TALES FROM THE CRYPT and the feature-film adaptation of the series, 1996's BORDELLO OF BLOOD.  Despite his knack for creating wonderfully uplifting and good-natured pictures, Zemeckis has always dabbled in darkness.  In BEOWULF, he's through dabbling.  He's not peering into the forest anymore; he's walking right into the middle of it and setting up camp in the shadows.At times, though, the shadows are so dark, it's hard to see much else.  When our hero is being seduced without a fight by the mother of all monsters, one thinks not of the scene and what it means so much as how utterly hopeless and bleak this film is.  The original tale was an adventure story, and a relatively simple one at that: the monster Grendel terrorizes a village, Beowulf slays him, Beowulf slays the monster's mother, Beowulf becomes a king and years later must slay a dragon.  Writers Avary and Gaiman turn it into a morality tale, and then director Zemeckis transforms it into a nightmare.  Those thinking Beowulf is a serious SHREK, or even a tuned-down LORD OF THE RINGS or NARNIA-style adventure, are bound to be horrified: Beowulf has more in common with Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD trilogy than those films.BEOWULF also shares a connection with the recent SIMPSONS MOVIE, as well as, of all things, MELROSE PLACE.  During his thrilling confrontation with Grendel, Beowulf strips himself of all his clothing (""We shall fight as equals,"" he says, because after all, Grendel doesn't shop at the Gap), his genitalia concealed by an impressive variety of objects - much as Bart Simpson's own privates were in THE SIMPSONS MOVIE, and also much like Heather Locklear's pregnant stomach was through the sixth season of MELROSE PLACE.That's about as light as the film gets, though.  Robert Zemeckis takes the medieval legend and turns it into a Grimm fairytale.  One can put the blame for the disturbing sexuality of the picture on the writers, the director, and to a lesser degree, Angelina Jolie (did she ask to give Aphrodite a run for her money?); the new twists in the story can be attributed to Neil Gaiman, and the bloody violence no doubt comes from Roger Avary (who last wrote the similarly-eerie SILENT HILL).  If BEOWULF was advertised correctly, it probably wouldn't anywhere near as riveting as it actually is.  But thanks to misleading ads, BEOWULF ranks as one of the most pleasantly surprising, violatingly disturbing, and refreshingly original films of the year.",4,Hungry like the Beowulf,1196380800,"11 30,

1126374,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0010V5SW8,trashcanman,"[36, 51]","""Beowulf"" is the most ambitious and awe-inspiring fantasy film to emerge in the considerable wake ofThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy-barring300which isn't entirely fantasy. It's a very adult animated movie that pushes the PG-13 rating to it's breaking point with overt sexual references, brutal violence, and abundant nudity. It is also the most impressive bit of computer animation I've ever had the pleasure of viewing and hopefully you didn't miss it on the big screen.""Beowulf"" is, of course, based on the poem of the same name and has been filmed several times before, most recently with Gerard Butler in the lead role inBeowulf & Grendel. Like so many modern film interpretations of classic myths, that film minimized the supernatural fantasy aspects and tried to make the story more realistic (see: boring). This adaptation will have none of that as we are treated to an etheral she-demon, toothy sea monsters, an utterly grotesque troll, and the most impressive dragon sinceDragonslayerover two decades ago. Along with animation that often leaves you gaping in awe at the film's beauty and the extreme onscreen carnage, there is little for me not to love about this adaption.The performances are well done all around. The CG was animated over the actions of onscreen actors including Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and Anthony Hopkins. While a bit is certainly lost in the translation with a few characters' faces seeming rather stiff at times, the end result is more than a little bit impressive.  So many films mix CG and live action nowadays that viewers have had to learn to ignore the obvious line between the two, but in making this an entirely CG affair, the look remains seamless throughout and it's easier to get lost in the first rate action sequences.  The only thing really lacking storywise is emotional depth in the love story between Beowulf and his queen. But that is a tiny complaint in an ocean of awesome.The story is a suprisingly emotional spin on the stone classic which pits the heroic-yet-fallible warrior, Beowulf, against monsters that are products of -if not representations of- human weakness. The monster Grendel is a wretched and pitiful creature whose eardrums are outside of his head, making the sounds of the villagers' merrymaking painful and driving him berserk. King Hrothgar puts out a reward which Beowulf arrives to collect and as the plot thickens the classic story receives a new perspective that drives the drama to a new, rather ironic level. The end result is a nicely foreshadowed sequence of events that leads to Beowulf being crowned as king. But just as each of the beasts the hero faces have a vital weakness so does he, and the day of reckoning for his dalliances does come.The music is as epic and memorable as the story itself and the visuals -as stated and restated- are top notch.  The new spin on the old story gives a fresh perspective on a literary classic, as though the poem is but a third-person recounting of the events we witness in the film passed down and altered by time.  Clever.  I'd love to see more classic mythological stories get this kind of treatment.  The director's cut DVD features some extra gore and that's about it, but it's good enough for me to recommend that version.  It also comes with a small comic book, some interesting ""making of"" stuff, and some other typical bonus materials, mostly dealing with casting and story conception.  The production art that's shown is very cool and the trailer for ""Iron Man "" is on there too.  Nothing earth-shattering, but certainly adequate.Animation should not be just for kids, and neither should this film genre.  This is the sort of film that shows just how far CG has come in such a short time.  I can't wait to see what animation will look like a decade form now. How ""Beowulf"" got away without an ""R"" rating in the theaters is a mystery to me, but I'm just thrilled that it slipped through because I wouldn't change a thing. Except for maybe the fist-sized dragon heart; that was just silly.

Unfortunately its' strikingly, vivid visuals are almost too stunning and magnificent for its' own good.I am sure many of you were forced to read the graphic story in a high school English class, and even though I am told it departs from the story so much, I will not go into great detail about the plot. It's main premise is a demon Grendel is terrorizing a village and the King calls for a hero to kill it, offering half the gold in his kingdom. Enter Beowulf who comes from afar to the rescue, but gets sidetracked by Grendel's mother. How could you not get sidetracked by a digitally-manipulated nude Angelina Jolie.I was so sad after watching this because I really wanted to like it. There were several things that made this so awful. The script was so horribly dry and dull that it took the life out of the characters. Also I felt that the animators spent so much time and effort on the close-ups of the actor's face (primarily Beowulf's), but not enough on their movement and action. The moment the characters would make any movement I felt like I was watching a glorified computer game, and I almost expected to see a digital scoreboard appear.Now some of the good points: The cast is a first rate ensemble including Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Ray Winstoned, and Brenan Gleeson. The other point that made this film tolerable was the fact that you have never seen anything like this before one screen. The animation is so original that for a while you will be simply delighted just to watch just for the visual grandeur, but that fades off rather quickly. This actually causes the downfall as you are so enthralled by the animation that you loose sight of the story and characters. It almost seemed like the filmmakers were so excited with their new technology that they got lost in the animation forgetting the story, script, and characters.After I watched Beowulf I thought about the amount of time and money ($150 million) they spent producing it, and I felt it would have been so much better if they had simply shot it real life and made it into an exciting blockbuster adventure rather than a two hour, computer game look-alike animated epic.",2,I AM [desperately trying to be] BEOWULF!!!!,1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,2337,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Zemekis', 'who', 'brought', 'spectacular', 'Polar', 'Express', 'now', 'thousand-year-old', 'vicious', 'Viking', 'story', 'Beowulf', 'Unfortunately', 'strikingly', 'vivid', 'visuals', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'stunning', 'magnificent', 'own', 'good.I', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'were', 'forced', 'read', 'graphic', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'class', 'even', 'am', 'told', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'plot', 'main', 'premise', 'demon', 'Grendel', 'terrorizing', 'village', 'King', 'hero', 'kill', 'offering', 'gold', 'kingdom', 'Enter', 'Beowulf', 'who', 'afar', 'rescue', 'sidetracked', 'Grendel', 'mother', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'sidetracked', 'digitally-manipulated', 'nude', 'Angelina', 'Jolie.I', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'watching', 'really', 'wanted', 'were', 'several', 'things', 'made', 'so', 'awful', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'horribly', 'dry', 'took', 'life', 'characters', 'Also', 'felt', 'animators', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'close-ups', 'actor', 'face', 'primarily', 'Beowulf', 'not', 'enough', 'movement', 'action', 'moment', 'characters', 'would', 'make', 'movement', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'glorified', 'computer', 'game', 'almost', 'expected', 'see', 'digital', 'scoreboard', 'good', 'points', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'ensemble', 'including', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Ray', 'Winstoned', 'Brenan', 'Gleeson', 'other', 'point', 'made', 'film', 'tolerable', 'was', 'fact', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'one', 'screen', 'animation', 'so', 'original', 'while', 'will', 'be', 'simply', 'delighted', 'just', 'watch', 'just', 'visual', 'grandeur', 'rather', 'quickly', 'actually', 'downfall', 'are', 'so', 'enthralled', 'animation', 'loose', 'sight', 'story', 'characters', 'almost', 'seemed', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'so', 'excited', 'new', 'technology', 'got', 'lost', 'animation', 'forgetting', 'story', 'script', 'characters.After', 'watched', 'Beowulf', 'thought', 'amount', 'time', 'money', '150', 'million', 'spent', 'producing', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'simply', 'shot', 'real', 'life', 'made', 'exciting', 'blockbuster', 'adventure', 'rather', 'two', 'hour', 'computer', 'game', 'look-alike', 'animated', 'epic']",N/A
1126378,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0010V5SW8,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","Everybody knows the heroic story of Beowulf. I read it many years ago in a modern English version, but you notice the difference between the original poem and this adaptation. Robert Zemeckis-directed film version is actually not about the three battles between Beowulf and Grendel, his mother and Dragon, but about what really happened to the protagonist, who is here described as a more vulnerable and flawed hero. Perhaps writer team Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery (especially the former) could have added more elements, but at least I found the script is pretty good. But of course, you cannot use it as CliffsNote.But I somehow didn't like the picture itself very much. (Let me add hurriedly that I watched it in a traditional 2-D theater.) Not that the film's actions are unexciting. The actions including flying Dragon and fierce, terrifying, zombie-like Grendel are simply great, but the movements of some characters in some scenes look still very awkward like the ones you see in video games.I think I know what Robert Zemeckis is trying to prove and the images are improved compared with ""The Polar Express"" where Tom Hanks often looked like a frozen undead, but some people would ask themselves why this film, or any other films using techniques such as motion capture for that matter, should be shot like this. Why making some actors' body look fatter than they really are (see Anthony Hopkins for instance), or thinner than they are (Ray Winstone looks like Sean Bean at first sight)? Why not cast Sean Bean instead? Probably time will tell the answer.The best part is, of course, Angelina Jolie as Grendel's alarmingly sexy mother with a tail, but perhaps you have already know that.

1126379,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0010V5SW8,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[7, 8]","The story of Beowulf is the oldest story of the English language. It's an epic story about a heroic man who seems capable of doing supernatural deeds.  When I was a senior in high school I read Beowulf for the first time and loved the story and themes the story was about.  I enjoyed reading the story even more years later in college when I had an opportunity to read a few portions in the original Old English.  I enjoyed the story just as much a few later when I read Semus Heaney's translation soon after it was published.  The story is a grand one and is an archetype of a grand heroic epic.  One would think that someone would use the story to write a great script and make a great movie.  Several film adaptations have been made of the story, but none of them have been very good.  Most of them have attempted to add their own twist on the story and in doing so ruin the essence of the epic nature of the story (the closest film adaptation of the story is THE 13TH WARRIOR with Antonio Banderas and Beowulf isn't even a character).  Therefore, I was very excited to learn that Robert Zemeckis (BACK TO THE FUTURE, FORREST GUMP, CASTAWAY) was making a new animated version of the story using his new ground-breaking CGI process.  When I learned that Neil Gaiman was one of the screenwriters, I became even more interested in the movie.  However, like many films released in 2007, BEOWULF just didn't live up to the hype.The setting is in a remote part of Denmark sometime during the Dark Ages.  King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), his wife Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn), and his subjects are having a major celebration triumphing the completion of the new mead hall, Heorot.  Hrothgar becomes heavily inebriated as do his men and the beginnings of an orgy ensue.  But the celebration has awakened a giant monster, Grendel (Crispin Glover), from his peaceful slumber.  Grendel barges into Heorot and no one is able to stop him.  The people flee and Heorot is sealed shut.The story fast-forwards to the arrival of Beowulf (Ray Winston).  Beowulf has come to slay the beast Grendel and bring peace to Hrothgar's kingdom.  Beowulf fights the monster naked and as the creature flees he traps its arm in a door and removes it.  It appears that life can return to normal, but there is something rotten in the state of Denmark:  Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie) lives and seeks revenge for the death of her son.  Traveling with his faithful companion Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson), Beowulf tracks the monster to the cave where she resides.  The creature isn't exactly like he imagined.  Beowulf is tempted and has to make a choice.  Beowulf learns a terrible secret while in the cave.Years later, Beowulf is now an old man and King of the Danes.  He is married to Wealthow and they have no children.  They love each other, but Beowulf if full of vices and has had many mistresses.  The kingdom has grown and become strong.  But a new evil in the form of a dragon threatens that prosperity.  Beowulf has to face the creature and make amends with his past.Most of the discussion about BEOWULF has been about the animation.  Some people love it, some think it is terrible.  There's no doubt that the film further pushes the envelope of the use of technology in filmmaking.  I found the animation to be incredible realistic, almost too much so.  At times the film seemed to be a surreal dream.  Also, the characters eyes don't convey much emotion and therefore at times it feels like one is watching an extended video game sequence rather than an entire movie.  Despite that, I was neither impressed by the animation nor turned off by it.What disappointed me about the movie was the story.  For example, the film turns Grendel's mother into a beautiful woman that seduced Hrothgar and attempts to seduce Beowulf.  Beowulf is supposed to kill her, not sleep with here.  I was also disappointed in the death of Hrothgar and Beowulf becoming King of the Danes.  In the original story, Beowulf returns to his own people and becomes their King. He fights off giants and invaders and lives a very happy life and brings prosperity to his kingdom.  When the dragon comes, everyone but Wiglaf forsakes him and because he seems to always do the right thing, he tracks the creature to it's lair and fights it.  No major film version of Beowulf has ever told the story the way it was originally told.  BEOWULF could have, but instead decided to ""update"" the story with a ""modern"" approach.  Beowulf in this movie is a hero, but he is not an epic hero.  Instead, he's watered down with lustful longings, lying boasts, jealous cravings, and greed-filled dreams.  One of the reasons I always liked the story of Beowulf is because he is a character that one wants to try to be like; at times his life seems inhuman, but he is an ideal, a person to pattern one's life after.  BEOWULF takes all of that away from Beowulf and makes the character just an ordinary man who happens to be really, really strong.Other than the perhaps the animation, the most impressive thing about the movie is the music.  The instrumentals are full of majesty and the vocal numbers, especially those sung by Robin Wright Penn, are full of wistful longing.The film is rated PG-13, but should have been rated R.  There's lots of graphic violence, many overt sexual allusions, and even some full frontal nudity.Overall, BEOWULF tries to be ground-breaking movie that is the penultimate film adaptation of the classic story, but instead is just an expensive imitation like all the movie versions that have come before.",3,True Heroes Apparently Don't Exist,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,5561,"['story',

(It's the oldest piece of written English that survives.) The myth is from so long-ago-and-far-away that it's hard going, even in a good translation (such as the Heany). And I don't object to the way the storyline has been altered to make the tale more dramatically coherent. (The screenwriters have the decency to admit it's ""their version"".)But the use of motion capture renders much of the film almost risible. Flesh is annoyingly ""plastic-y"" and devoid of texture (despite the intentional capture of such texture), except in close-ups -- the naked Hrothgar looks like a vinyl action figure, reminiscent of Stinky Pete in ""Toy Story 2"". Worse, the motion-rendering software has no trouble with rapid or abrupt movement, but slower movements look ""rubbery"". This system is roughly at the point hand-drawn animation of humans was 80 years ago. ** The ""suspension of disbelief"" needed for motion capture to be convincing is not currently possible. The overall effect is of plastic puppets running around on an artificial stage. One wonders why Gollum was so well-done, and the characters in this film are so poor.It's also difficult to forget that the ultra-studly Beowulf is voiced by the overweight, not-very-attractive Ray Winstone. If you like movies with naked CGI characters, you'll probably like this one. But there's little else to recommend it.* She's played Alexander's mother. Wonder how long it'll be before she plays Abraham Lincoln's mother?** Things got better a few years later. Note Snow White's dancing with the dwarfs.

My condolences to the purists: this telling speaks to today's generation.What's of this generation is great. Star power includes Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and scripting by Neil Gaiman. The animation (yes, it's animation) represents the very best of this generation too. Jolie has voice credits, but she clearly gave a lot more than her voice to the animators. Ditto Hopkins, who transformed expertly into Hrothgar - computerized alchemy explored the ridiculous idea that Hopkins could ever be dumpy, but did so convicingly. Fussy bits, hair and beard among them, set this animation ahead of others, but so do the other aspects of cinema and artistry. Today's best animation comes up short of reality, but this comes right up to the best of today's animation.The story itself survived largely intact. Specialists (I can name one) will be disappointed - but they always are. The graphic novel might be the literary form of the emerging generation, and this speaks directly in that idiom as only computer animation can. Even with that, real tensions with real ambiguities come through. The odd logic of senior wife protecting junior doxy and vice versa gives a little to think about, even if only a little.If you want the grandest of comic books, you came to the right place. After a thousand years of telling, maybe more, this story still fits well between the covers of today's comics. Then, once comic-fied, it becomes the grandest of comic-book movies.

1126387,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0010V5SW8,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","2007's ""Beowulf"" is an animated film version of the epos featuring motion-capture technology which films real-life actors (Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn) and places them into the animated picture. Although this is a ""cartoon"" it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture, featuring ultra-brutal violence and open sexual situations & dialogue (BOTH the rated and unrated versions).The film has the same characters as the epic poem -- Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon -- and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's ""sea hag"" mother and the dragon; other than this the film strongly deviates from the classic poem. Needless to say, don't watch this if you're a Beowulf purist -- you'll be both offended and disappointed.However, if you don't mind the animation or a re-imagining of the epic story and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, I recommend catching ""Beowulf."" It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching this version and 2005's ""Beowulf & Grendel"" back-to-back; the latter film is a live-action version featuring Gerard Butler in the titular role and filmed on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland (seriously, it's worth viewing just for the stunning location photography). This Gerard Butler version omits the third Act with the dragon and adds a Nordic witch character, effectively played by Sarah Polley.One of the main statements of the 2007 animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend, which has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero in this version but this isn't true. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't a hero, what is? Okay, so he exagerrates his past exploits and has a weakness for babes, what else is new?I should add here that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title (""What We Need Is A Hero"" -- Tracks 1 & 4 on the soundtrack cd) and the two versions of ""A Hero Comes Home"" (the first is the shorter/simpler version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits).[SPOILER ALERT! The rest of this review explores the meanings behind the story and gives away important plot elements]I'll be honest with you, although I was entertained the first time I saw ""Beowulf"" I came away from it thinking ""Huh?"" This version makes King Hrothgar the father of Grendel and Beowulf the father of the dragon, making it absurd in a what-were-they-thinking way, but also highly creative. Whether you see it one way or the other -- or both -- depends on the individual and how you look at it.Viewing the picture a second time, I was intent on figuring it out and gleaning the moral(s) of the story. The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.Other points include:- The mistakes of your past will inevitably come back to haunt you.- Apart from redemption, the ""sins of the fathers"" will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally!).- Even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws.- Deal with and put to rest your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt & shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead (see the final paragraph below).- Offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter the cost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak.- Men are easily entranced by a beautiful babe, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions.- A beautiful woman can turn a man into a loaf of bread.- The importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.Some things to think about: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is he able to morph back-and-forth at will? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?Some criticize that Beowulf is no longer a Christ-figure in this account, which isn't accurate. Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only ""weeping martyrs,"" ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer, who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in ""Beowulf"" was created via Beowulf and is later revealed as a hideous dragon.All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even ultra-heroes like Beowulf, which -- again -- is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about ""weeping martyrs"" is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement (see below). Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, ""KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!"" Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invunerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending proves he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality, my friend.
