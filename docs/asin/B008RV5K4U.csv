The one thing I loved when I read the original graphic novel was the amazing thought boxes, the inner turmoil that Bruce was going through as he fought his way back. So many scenes of this movie needed those thoughts. Every time a scene would come up I could hear those thoughts in my head as they appeared in the book.

1575085,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B008RV5K4U,Ace-of-Stars,"[0, 2]","Managed to preview this latest installment of the Batman animated features prior to its official DVD release, and again we find a story based on a classic DC graphic novel... yet not just any graphic novel, but the one which was the first step in breathing fresh new life into the Batman franchise when the character and his surrounding mythology were hemorrhaging and trying to remain relevant for a new generation of comic book fans as well as for American moviegoers whose only experience with the Batman was a campy television show from the 1960s.""THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS"" translates the original DC graphic novel by Frank Miller over to the ""animation"" realm and does quite a successful job at remaining faithful to the original source material, which is certain to be a huge plus for the many hardcore ""purists"" who were enthralled with Miller's ""non-continuity"" imagination piece.However, this rendition of the story does (in my opinion) have two very serious flaws:The first flaw is the ""artwork."" The drawn characters are not smooth, flowing and graceful, but rather rough, bulky and clumsy. Of course, this is supposed to be ""deliberate"" on the animators' part, as they are clearly attempting to mimic the pencil art style of Miller's original drawings... but what works well within the ""printed pages"" feels extremely awkward when making the transition to animated video. So while the story itself keeps us engrossed, the ""visual"" style always manages to keep us slightly off-kilter.The second and biggest flaw is the garsh-horrible Voice-Directing and Voice-Acting. Peter Weller (""ROBOCOP"") supplying the voice for Bruce Wayne [slash] Batman does almost nothing to rescue the vocal performances! The way the voice actors deliver their lines of dialog are so nerve-gratingly amateurish that it sounds like a stage production being performed by any typical Junior-High School drama club. Even with the awkward & foreign colloquialisms of this ""fantasy future world,"" there's really no excuse for such wooden & stilted (and utterly ""EXPRESSIONLESS"") line delivery: it is as if this particular band of actors really did not care about their work, but were instead merely stepping up in front of a microphone for no other purpose than to draw a paycheck just so they could cover their next rent & utilities payments.These demerits aside however, the fact that the story and the very concept of The Batman ""rising"" out of retirement (if you'll pardon the pun) is enough to keep the viewer totally involved speaks well of it as a solid ""package,"" and DC is to be commended for finally bringing this top fave of fanboys everywhere to join the ranks of so many other impressive ""DCAU"" features, and it stokes the flames of anticipation for the as yet unreleased ""Part 2"" in this saga.",4,The Dark Knight Rises...

1575087,A1NMHU4RJZO1GW,B008RV5K4U,A. Hollett,"[19, 28]","Let me preface this review by saying that I read the original graphic novel series many years ago. I understand that such a work as done by Frank Miller could be difficult to translate into an animated film simply because of the nature in which it was written and the way in which the artwork was constructed. All in all, while I did feel some disappointment with this film, I did find it to be an entertaining re-telling of Frank Miller's original work. It seemed to hold the proper tone that Miller was trying to capture in that an aging Batman has to contend with a society that no longer wants his presence as well as his age handicapping his abilities.One thing that did bother me was the lack of ""voice-over"" narration by Batman as seen in the graphic novel. While the lack of this narration did not detract from the film and it's impact, I think there would have been an even stronger impact upon viewers if we could hear those intimate, calculating, emotional thoughts that Batman had during each encounter. A perfect example is when he first comes back onto the scene and is climbing a rope to reach the bad guys. One bad guy says that Batman has to be old by now. In response to this, the Batman voice-over says, ""Old enough to need to use my legs to climb a rope"". This occurs in the comics, not the film, but I think it really allows the audience a peek into the mindframe and mindset of Batman while he engages in his crime-fighting activities. As I said, it is not a mood-killer that it was left out of the film, but I do think the creative team behind the film kind of missed out on a very good opportunity to really suck the audience of the film into the mind of Batman.Another thing that bothered me was the voice casting for Batman/Bruce Wayne. Yes, Peter Weller did a fine job with this, and I give him his due credit for giving life to an aging Batman. I also understand why the creative team might have wanted to not utilize the legendary Kevin Conroy (the one and only true voice for Batman from the animated series of the 90's, the Justice League animated series, the animated movie between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and the Arkham video games) for the voice in an effort to open up people's minds to the concept of more than one person being able to bring Batman to life. Unfortunately, I feel like the creative team missed the boat a bit on this one. For anyone who ever watched the animated series from the 90's, you may recall that they did a storytelling episode that actually made use of Frank Miller's graphic novel. In specific, they showed a scene that blended Batman's initial attack against the Mutants with his final fight against the Mutant's leader in which he utter's the infamous expression, ""This isn't a trash heap, it's an operating table, and I'm the suregon."" In this instance, the creative team behind the animated series made, in my opinion, an absolutely genius decision to utilize Michael Ironside (""Jester"" from the film Top Gun) as the voice of Batman. I really and truly wish the team behind the Dark Knight Returns movie had decided to retain his voice or, if they had indeed tried to go that route, that Mr. Ironside had accepted any offer to do said voice for this film. While Peter Weller certainly exemplified the cold and dark visage of Batman, Michael Ironside, in just a ten minute clip, truly seemed to epitomize the dark, gritty, dangerousness of a Batman who, while having grown older, has also become a lot more calculating and deadly with his experiences. It was a truly missed opportunity.Overall, I was generally happy with the film and look forward to seeing how they put the rest of Miller's story into film in part 2, particularly the verbal back and forth and eventual combat between Batman and Superman.",3,"Good movie, questionable creative and voice casting choices",1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,3783,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'read', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'understand', 'work', 'done', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'could', 'be', 'difficult', 'translate', 'animated', 'film', 'simply', 'nature', 'was', 'written', 'way', 'artwork', 'was', 'constructed', 'did', 'feel', 'disappointment', 'film', 'did', 'find', 'be', 'entertaining', 're-telling', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'original', 'work', 'seemed', 'hold', 'proper', 'tone', 'Miller', 'was', 'trying', 'capture', 'aging', 'Batman', 'contend', 'society', 'longer', 'presence', 'as', 'well', 'age', 'handicapping', 'abilities.One', 'thing', 'did', 'bother', 'was', 'lack', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'Batman', 'seen', 'graphic', 'novel', 'lack', 'narration', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'film', 'impact', 'think', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'stronger', 'impact', 'viewers', 'could', 'hear', 'intimate', 'calculating', 'emotional', 'thoughts', 'Batman', 'had', 'encounter', 'perfect', 'example', 'when', 'first', 'back', 'scene', 'climbing', 'rope', 'reach', 'bad', 'guys', 'One', 'bad', 'guy', 'Batman', 'be', 'old', 'now', 'response', 'Batman', 'voice-over', 'Old', 'enough', 'need', 'use', 'legs', 'climb', 'rope', 'comics', 'not', 'film', 'think', 'really', 'audience', 'peek', 'mindframe', 'mindset', 'Batman', 'crime-fighting', 'activities', 'said', 'not', 'mood-killer', 'was', 'left', 'film', 'do', 'think', 'creative', 'team', 'film', 'kind', 'missed', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'opportunity', 'really', 'suck', 'audience', 'film', 'mind', 'Batman.Another', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'voice', 'casting', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Yes', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'give', 'due', 'credit', 'giving', 'life', 'aging', 'Batman', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'creative', 'team', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', 'not', 'utilize', 'legendary', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'one', 'only', 'true', 'voice', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', '90', 'Justice', 'League', 'animated', 'series', 'animated', 'movie', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Arkham', 'video', 'games', 'voice', 'effort', 'open', 'up', 'people', 'minds', 'concept', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'being', 'able', 'bring', 'Batman', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'feel', 'creative', 'team', 'missed', 'boat', 'bit', 'one', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'watched', 'animated', 'series', '90', 'may', 'recall', 'did', 'storytelling', 'episode', 'actually', 'made', 'use', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'graphic', 'novel', 'specific', 'showed', 'scene', 'blended', 'Batman', 'initial', 'attack', 'Mutants', 'final', 'fight', 'Mutant', 'leader', 'utter', 'infamous', 'expression', ""n't"", 'trash', 'heap', 'operating', 'table', ""'m"", 'suregon', 'instance', 'creative', 'team', 'animated', 'series', 'made', 'opinion', 'absolutely', 'genius', 'decision', 'utilize', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'Jester', 'film', 'Top', 'Gun', 'voice', 'Batman', 'really', 'truly', 'wish', 'team', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'movie', 'had', 'decided', 'retain', 'voice', 'had', 'indeed', 'tried', 'go', 'route', 'Mr.', 'Ironside', 'had', 'accepted', 'offer', 'do', 'said', 'voice', 'film', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'certainly', 'exemplified', 'cold', 'dark', 'visage', 'Batman', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'just', 'ten', 'minute', 'clip', 'truly', 'seemed', 'epitomize', 'dark', 'gritty', 'dangerousness', 'Batman', 'who', 'having', 'grown', 'older', 'also', 'become', 'lot', 'more', 'calculating', 'deadly', 'experiences', 'was', 'truly', 'missed', 'opportunity.Overall', 'was', 'generally', 'happy', 'film', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'put', 'rest', 'Miller', 'story', 'film', 'part', '2', 'particularly', 'verbal', 'back', 'forth', 'eventual', 'combat', 'Batman', 'Superman']",N/A

For the most part the film stays true to the story arc. It isn't a scene-for-scene/line-for-line representation, but it does capture Mazzuchelli's art, mood and style quite well. The fight scenes are fantastic.The soundtrack is brooding and takes some noticeable cues from Hans Zimmer's musical scores. I enjoyed it and would even buy a few tracks if they were available in mp3.Peter Weller's low, brawny, full-bodied voice was a perfect choice for Batman. Gordon's performance was a little disappointing and a little wooden in places. The slang from the mutants sounded pretentious and unnatural at times, but the filmmakers did the best they could with Miller's writing. Frank Miller just doesn't have very good ear for dialogue.Overall, this is excellent for a cartoon though and an improvement on previous batman animations I've seen. And this IS a cartoon intended for teens and adults. I wasn't expecting some of the violence from the comic to be carried into the cartoon.

(the second or third Batman, the original universe started as an adult in the 30s)I think DC made some trade offs for a PG-13 rating and to skip over a dated work.

In the book you never see Commissioner Gordon's right hand man, Merkel-- and here he's just a regular generic policeman.  In the book Batman isn't sure it's really Harvey committing the new Two Face Crimes while in this there's no question.More of a mistake was the screenwriter's decision to re-write Frank Miller's dialogue-- WHY?  Why adapt a work rightfully admired by so many and then change crucial dialogue exchanges?  The amazing interplay in the first scene between Gordon and Bruce Wayne becomes a chance to summarize all of what's wrong with Gotham-- we already get it-- Gotham's a hell hole and Batman is retired, Miller handled this scene so much more effectively.Even the opening scene, which in the book is hard to understand just what is going on but is explained when you get to the end of the sequence was brilliant.  Here it's dumbed down and spoon fed to us as if they were concerned that the audience would be confused for even a half second.They made an admirable attempt at capturing the art of Frank Miller-- and for the most part it works, but I wish they had used black instead of the constant gray on the characters which makes it look like Anime (not an insult to those people who like it) but this would have been so much better if there were heavy blacks like we saw in the 60s with the classic JONNY QUEST.The Voice actors are solid-- but there's still an element of people holding back--which can happen when you record each session separately in front of a microphone and don't have other actors to react to.  Peter Weller is in fine form as Batman, but sometimes it just feels flat.The actor playing Commissioner Gordon verges on cartoony delivery which is often distracting.  Gordon should have been a commanding presence in this, instead he's a little goofy at times.Overall, while I'm glad they did the adaption, and kudos for making it two parts instead of trying to jam this epic story into 85 mins, why the changes WB?  Miller's script was perfect as it was.The average modern Batman fan whose never read the series will likely find this an exciting well done bit of animation, but to the die-hard Dark Knight fans (and yes Daniel, this came first long before the Christopher Nolan films) I think you'll be slightly let down as to what might have been.",3,Brilliant Graphic Novel - A Decent Adaption,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,2647,"['agree', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'internal', 'monologue', 'Batman', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'crucial', 'establishing', 'mood', 'story', 'choosing', 'not', 'use', 'was', 'mistake.While', 'think', 'using', 'lot', 'panels', 'original', 'works', 'fantastically', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'use', 'complete', 'storyboard', 'book', 'never', 'see', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Merkel', 'here', 'just', 'regular', 'generic', 'policeman', 'book', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'sure', 'really', 'Harvey', 'committing', 'new', 'Two', 'Face', 'Crimes', 'question.More', 'mistake', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'decision', 're-write', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'dialogue', 'WHY', 'Why', 'adapt', 'work', 'rightfully', 'admired', 'so', 'many', 'then', 'change', 'crucial', 'dialogue', 'exchanges', 'amazing', 'interplay', 'first', 'scene', 'Gordon', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'chance', 'summarize', 'what', 'wrong', 'Gotham', 'already', 'get', 'Gotham', 'hell', 'hole', 'Batman', 'retired', 'Miller', 'handled', 'scene', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'effectively.Even', 'opening', 'scene', 'book', 'hard', 'understand', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'explained', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'sequence', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Here', 'dumbed', 'down', 'spoon', 'fed', 'were', 'concerned', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'confused', 'even', 'half', 'second.They', 'made', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'capturing', 'art', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'most', 'part', 'wish', 'had', 'used', 'black', 'instead', 'constant', 'gray', 'characters', 'look', 'Anime', 'not', 'insult', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'were', 'heavy', 'blacks', 'saw', '60s', 'classic', 'JONNY', 'QUEST.The', 'Voice', 'actors', 'are', 'solid', 'still', 'element', 'people', 'holding', 'back', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'record', 'session', 'separately', 'front', 'microphone', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'actors', 'react', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'fine', 'form', 'Batman', 'just', 'flat.The', 'actor', 'playing', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'verges', 'cartoony', 'delivery', 'often', 'distracting', 'Gordon', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'commanding', 'presence', 'instead', 'little', 'goofy', 'times.Overall', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'adaption', 'kudos', 'making', 'two', 'parts', 'instead', 'trying', 'jam', 'epic', 'story', '85', 'mins', 'why', 'changes', 'WB', 'Miller', 'script', 'was', 'perfect', 'average', 'modern', 'Batman', 'fan', 'never', 'read', 'series', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'exciting', 'well', 'done', 'bit', 'animation', 'die-hard', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'fans', 'yes', 'Daniel', 'came', 'first', 'long', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'films', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'slightly', 'let', 'down', 'as', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A

I am happy to report I have been proven wrong; this is an excellent film that remains very faithful to Miller's bleak vision of the Darknight Detective. It's also one that, unlike a lot of similiar projects, actually justifies its own existence, at least in my opinion. How is that, you ask? Well, when I read the original graphic novel in the 80s, I recall thinking, ""This is superhero film noir."" Now that it's a movie, it actually IS a film noir (okay, technically it's a neo-noir, but you know what I mean), and quite a good one to boot; I think that's pretty neat.A couple of minor critiques: First, the filmmakers decided to eliminated almost all of the narration from the original comic here. Normally, this would be a valid aesthetic decision; however, I feel that it works against the film here, as it deprives the work of one of its most explictly noirish elements and most (although not all) of its best lines. Secondly, although this film , unlike many of the other DC Universe Animated Movies, is quite easily understandable to the non-fanboy viewer, there is some discussion in the film of Jason Todd (aka the second Robin) that may be  confusing to the neophyte. Fortunately, this is quite easily rectified by a quick perusal of the graphic novelBatman: A Death in the Family, to which I commend you.My rating: 4 1/2 stars (out of 5).

When the issues were released in a collected edition later that year, the story title for the first issue was applied to the series as a whole.

I loved The Dark Knight, Inception, and pretty much everything he has done...until now. I thought this film was entirely too long and stretched out. Even Christian Bale seemed like he was bored to tears for most of the movie. Instead of having him be out for vengeance after Rachel's death Nolan decides to have him retire? Um, no. That's not how Batman would react. You're thinking of Edward Cullen, Mr. Nolan. Anyway after that it's nothing but teleporting Bruce Wayne, heavy handed plot points, and a villain who sounds like he's doing a Sean Connery impression through a wrapping paper tube. You want to know what else was ridiculous? The freaking bomb that is supposed to blow up Gotham. First, it's some green energy crap but it has a timer on it for some reason. Second, why did Bane wait six FREAKING months to have it blow up? Yea, sure, he said it was to torture Bruce Wayne. Whatever, if you accept that logic then thats your problem. If Nolan had cut all of that out though this would have been a much stronger film. No magical back healing. No magic teleporting back to Gotham. No long drawn out scenes where he tries to climb some stupid wall (i get that it was supposed to be some turning point for bruce wayne but it took up like 30 minutes in a movie that was already way too long).

Joined by Carrie Kelly, a young female Robin, Batman takes to the streets to end the threat of the mutant gangs that have overrun the city. After facing off against his two greatest enemies, the Joker and Two-Face, for the final time, Batman finds himself in mortal combat with his former ally, Superman, in a battle that only one of them will survive.I'll admit, I was a little displeased with Batman: Year One. What worked so well for the ""Year One"" comic was exactly what didn't work for the animated feature. Even though it was faithful to Frank Miller's work, something about it was just amiss. Still, I purchased it and added it to my collection. Yes, I recommend it to everyone as well but I wasn't completely happy with it. Which brings me to the new Warner Premiere/DC Universe animated feature, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1. I must admit, this is one time that Bruce Timm and Co. got it all right. This adaptation completely nails the tone and atmosphere of the book. What amazes me is how they don't shy away from the explicit themes from the comic book, like Rape, Murdering Children and the like. Course, if you'll notice from most of the Warner Premiere animated features, things aren't too explicit yet they do deal with more adult themes. This particular tale reminded me of the Spawn Animated series to a certain extent, in utilizing the shadows and darkness to create a very ambient and dark tone. Peter Weller & Ariel Winter do a great job as The Dark Knight and his sidekick, Robin.I like how Warner Premiere and DC Comics keep bringing animated versions of DC's greatest works and I hope that they continue the trend.

1575108,A3TY1B54GNRM1B,B008RV5K4U,"B. Newby ""spikescreed""","[5, 6]","I just finished watching ""The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1"" and I give it an enthusiastic thumbs up. Given Bruce Timm's recent work, which I have not enjoyed, I was leary about this one. I haven't been a huge fan of Batman animation since the 90s, excepting ""Under the Red Hood"". But having him as producer, Jay Oliva as director (who did Iron Man and Dr. Strange, two of my favorite of the Marvel animations), and Andrea Romano back in voice direction (from the 90s Batman animated series), it all worked out.I'm always concerned when watching animation if the voice actors are someone I know well from live action. Will I be able to separate their voice from their face and buy their performance in the animation? I'll admit, I started this movie having trouble doing that with Gordon (David Selby of Dark Shadows) and Batman/Wayne (Peter Weller of Robocop). As it went on though, I got into it and really took to them in their roles. My only reservation, and it is the same with virtually every non-Kevin Conroy performance of Batman, is that actors playing Batman often neglect to make separate voices for Batman and Bruce Wayne. In the comics, Bruce wants to keep Batman's persona separate and doing the voice is one of the most important features of that. My only problem with Weller's performance is that he uses the same voice for Batman as for Wayne. It put me off a little, as it always does.I like that this movie moved away from the graphic novel in spots, adding and subtracting scenes and dialogue according to what worked for the movie instead of just staying slavishly true to the novel. My big problem with the movie adaptation of ""Batman: Year One"" was that it stayed too close to the novel and what worked in the comic book medium didn't translate as well into the animated movie version. With ""DK Returns"", the filmakers negotiate their way through this problem with grace, making sure that you know you aren't just watching a motion comic. This is an adaptation as much as the word can imply, staying as true as it needs to the source material while trying to be its own thing. Even knowing what was going to happen, I was still in suspense at all the right spots, particularly during the first fight between Batman and the Mutant Leader. Waiting for Robin to intervene had me on the edge of my seat and I think it was well done.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of darker takes on Batman's character, a la Frank Miller. I also believe this movie would appeal to anyone who was a fan of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" given Timm's and Romano's roles in making this movie.Side note: The funny thing about watching this is that now that it is in film format, I feel like I'm watching an abridged version of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" which took much of its material from this novel. It is neat to make comparisons on how the source material was used for each and how it applies to each version of the Batman universe.Anyhow, I'm now really looking forward to the 2nd part. I'll buy it once both parts are available, just in case they do a special edition which combines both films into one.

I personally felt that there were plenty of other great Batman adaptations. I also had slightly lower expectations for the film since I felt that many of the more recent DC offerings were slightly rushed or disappointing. After watching the film though I have to say that I was pretty blown away. I think the movie is better than the comic book. The film is simply outstanding. The voice acting was great and the music was some of the coolest music that I have ever heard in an animated film. It really sets the mood perfectly. Some people have complained that the film removed some of Batman's inner dialogue and that the story was padded to divide it up into two films. I couldnt disagree more. The story is paced perfectly and it would have been impossible to fit both parts into one movie.  Also, having the inner dialogue wouldnt have worked as well in a film version. It works better for a comic book.  What makes this a better adaptation than the comic book is the hard hitting action and violence. Its hard to feel the impact of the fight scenes in the comic book but in the movie its brutal and fun to watch. This movie has got it all: great voice acting, great story, brutal action, a very dark Batman which we all love, and some fantastic music that really takes it to another level.Bottom line: If you are slightly interested in the movie but have been disappointed by some of the recent DC animated movies I strongly recommend that you pick this up or at least rent it.

1575114,A1N00127IDBHD6,B008RV5K4U,CConn,"[6, 7]","It probably should be considered sacrilege to be a Batman fan and not be absolutely gaga over The Dark Knight Returns, but, strangely, I never was a giant fan of Fran Miller's grim take on Batman's future. Don't get me wrong, it's a good story, and one of the better Batman tales out there, but I never quite regarded it as definitive or superior to the many other worthwhile takes on Batman. Amazingly however, TDKR Part 1 did what very few film adaptations are ever able to do and - in many ways - improved upon and surpassed it's source material.The changes are immediately apparent. While the film opens in the exact same way as the comic, gone is the hard boiled noir inner monologues that gave the original comic it's Sin City-esque tone, gone is the constant drone of newscasters and polipsy babbling, and in its stead is little more than the grim, dark adrenaline of Bruce Wayne pushing its racer to its limit, as a musical score that blends Hans Zimmer with John Carpenter plays quietly in the background.The newscasters pop up soon enough - make no mistake, no story beats are missed or forgotten about - but the subtle tweaks in its presentation turns the film from a definitively noir, comic booky experience, into something even more sinister and brutal. It's still unmistakably Batman, but with it, comes the slick and eery overtones of 80s sci-fi and the ultra-violent twinge of the 80s actioneer. Being an animated film with a running time of scarcely 76 minutes, it's obviously not quite up to par with Blade Runner, and RoboCop, and the original Terminator, but it without question borrows heavily from those pieces to create a strangely iconic, strangely unique 80s futurist vision of Batman.Which, if you've read the comic, I'm sure you'll say it's what it always has been. The source material definitely lends itself to that sub-genre that was burgeoning in Hollywood when Frank Miller first penned the comic back in 1986, but again, it's only enhanced and improved by the film crew's creative decisions and direction.Outside of its overall presentation, the next overwhelming strength for the film, is the characterization of Batman himself. After reading the comic, I was hardly sold on the grizzled, militaristic Batman that Frank Miller made famous, but on film, and voiced phenomenally by Peter Weller (of RoboCop fame, ironically), the over the top characterization of the comic is, once again, transmuted into something much cooler, sleeker and simply exuding 80s cool and bravado.To say that Batman is at his best - his coolest, his most violent, his most broken and intriguing - would not be a wholly incorrect statement to make. While I positively love Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman, and while I respect the detail in which Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale explored their Batman's psyche, Weller's Batman has a fierceness that both of those interpretations lacked. He is, to be blunt, a bad ass. More RoboCop, John McClaine, Snake Pliskin than the wounded soul that Keaton and Bale were.The final striking aspect of the film, honestly has to be its direction and overall sublety of its screenwriting. During the opening act of the film, we're treated to several moments of Bruce Wayne's inner demons and his continued obsession with his parents death in several flashbacks and hallucinatory episodes that deliver that age old psychosis of Batman in possibly the most sophisticated yet troubled way I've yet seen on film.On top of this surprisingly mature writing is a level of direction and shot selection that I've seldom seen in animated, direct-to-video filmmaking. It's balantly obvious that director Jay Olivia truly strove to make a movie that is more than just an hour-long marketing ploy. He really seemed to want to make something truly special and individual to the series of DC Animated movies; a love letter to the original work, to the action films of our collective, 80s childhoods, to Christopher Nolan's recent entries, and, of course, to the character himself.All in all, this care, attention to detail and talent in adaptation, acting, and direction imbibes The Dark Knight Returns with a level of quality and maturity that is rarely seen in this genre of film.",5,"Brutal, mature, and bleeding future-'80s cool",1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,4221,"['probably', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'sacrilege', 'be', 'Batman', 'fan', 'not', 'be', 'absolutely', 'gaga', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'strangely', 'never', 'was', 'giant', 'fan', 'Fran', 'Miller', 'grim', 'take', 'Batman', 'future', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'good', 'story', 'one', 'better', 'Batman', 'there', 'never', 'quite', 'regarded', 'definitive', 'superior', 'many', 'other', 'worthwhile', 'Batman', 'Amazingly', 'however', 'TDKR', 'Part', '1', 'did', 'what', 'very', 'few', 'film', 'adaptations', 'are', 'ever', 'able', 'do', 'many', 'ways', 'improved', 'surpassed', 'source', 'material.The', 'changes', 'are', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'film', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'comic', 'gone', 'hard', 'boiled', 'noir', 'inner', 'monologues', 'gave', 'original', 'comic', 'Sin', 'City-esque', 'tone', 'gone', 'constant', 'drone', 'newscasters', 'polipsy', 'babbling', 'stead', 'little', 'more', 'grim', 'dark', 'adrenaline', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'pushing', 'racer', 'limit', 'musical', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'quietly', 'background.The', 'newscasters', 'pop', 'up', 'soon', 'enough', 'make', 'mistake', 'story', 'beats', 'are', 'missed', 'forgotten', 'subtle', 'tweaks', 'presentation', 'film', 'definitively', 'noir', 'comic', 'booky', 'experience', 'something', 'even', 'more', 'sinister', 'brutal', 'still', 'unmistakably', 'Batman', 'slick', 'eery', 'overtones', '80s', 'sci-fi', 'ultra-violent', 'twinge', '80s', 'actioneer', 'Being', 'animated', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'scarcely', '76', 'minutes', 'obviously', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'RoboCop', 'original', 'Terminator', 'question', 'borrows', 'heavily', 'pieces', 'create', 'strangely', 'iconic', 'strangely', 'unique', '80s', 'futurist', 'vision', 'Batman.Which', ""'ve"", 'read', 'comic', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'say', 'what', 'always', 'been', 'source', 'material', 'definitely', 'sub-genre', 'was', 'burgeoning', 'Hollywood', 'when', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'first', 'penned', 'comic', 'back', '1986', 'again', 'only', 'enhanced', 'improved', 'film', 'crew', 'creative', 'decisions', 'direction.Outside', 'overall', 'presentation', 'next', 'overwhelming', 'strength', 'film', 'characterization', 'Batman', 'reading', 'comic', 'was', 'hardly', 'sold', 'grizzled', 'militaristic', 'Batman', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'made', 'famous', 'film', 'voiced', 'phenomenally', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'RoboCop', 'fame', 'ironically', 'top', 'characterization', 'comic', 'once', 'again', 'transmuted', 'something', 'much', 'cooler', 'sleeker', 'simply', 'exuding', '80s', 'cool', 'bravado.To', 'say', 'Batman', 'best', 'coolest', 'most', 'violent', 'most', 'broken', 'intriguing', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'wholly', 'incorrect', 'statement', 'make', 'positively', 'love', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'portrayal', 'Batman', 'respect', 'detail', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'explored', 'Batman', 'psyche', 'Weller', 'Batman', 'fierceness', 'interpretations', 'lacked', 'be', 'blunt', 'bad', 'ass', 'More', 'RoboCop', 'John', 'McClaine', 'Snake', 'Pliskin', 'wounded', 'soul', 'Keaton', 'Bale', 'were.The', 'final', 'striking', 'aspect', 'film', 'honestly', 'be', 'direction', 'overall', 'sublety', 'screenwriting', 'opening', 'act', 'film', ""'re"", 'treated', 'several', 'moments', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'inner', 'demons', 'continued', 'obsession', 'parents', 'death', 'several', 'flashbacks', 'hallucinatory', 'episodes', 'deliver', 'age', 'old', 'psychosis', 'Batman', 'possibly', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'yet', 'troubled', 'way', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'film.On', 'top', 'surprisingly', 'mature', 'writing', 'level', 'direction', 'shot', 'selection', ""'ve"", 'seldom', 'seen', 'animated', 'direct-to-video', 'filmmaking', 'balantly', 'obvious', 'director', 'Jay', 'Olivia', 'truly', 'strove', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'hour-long', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'really', 'seemed', 'want', 'make', 'something', 'truly', 'special', 'individual', 'series', 'DC', 'Animated', 'movies', 'love', 'letter', 'original', 'work', 'action', 'films', 'collective', '80s', 'childhoods', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'recent', 'entries', 'course', 'character', 'himself.All', 'care', 'attention', 'detail', 'talent', 'adaptation', 'acting', 'direction', 'imbibes', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'level', 'quality', 'maturity', 'rarely', 'seen', 'genre', 'film']",N/A

It's about a two and half hour ride on  the bus so it breaks it up a bit for me.Inside the flea market there is a dealer who sells Hot Wheels, car stereos and new movies. Many of which have not come out on video or the theaters yet.Being a Batman fan, I was looking forward to the animated version of the classic story by Frank Miller. As my luck would have it,  the dealer had the movie on DVD for sale at his table. Suffice it to say, I was all too excited.Then, things got worse. I left my wallet back at the community center when I was in the bathroom. It must of fell off when I took off my shoes and favorite pair of corduroys.  The guy said he would be there till five so I would need to hurry.Just missing the bus, I had to wait an hour. The bus ride was two hours long because that is the full route it takes to get back to the community center located two blocks from the flea market. Gratefully, when arrived at the center, they had my wallet and corduroys and suggested I keep them together on my person.When I got back to the flea market, the dealer was pulling down the cage over his table, but I was able to stop him as I yelled.Even though he said he didn't have any change, I do feel that I got a good deal on the movie.Finally, I made it home and went straight way to the tv mounted on the cooler in the corner of the living room to watch the movie.To be honest, I wanted to like this movie, heck, I wanted to love it. However, I can't in good conscience do or say either. In fact, I have found myself even more polarized as I write this from my Tandy desk top computer.Most of the time, I could not hear what was being said, and the rest of the time the video quality was about as good as when I would try to watch scrambled Cinemax late at night on my grandma's tv.They must of realized this and gave up because the movie just ends.

With Bruce Timm on board, I was sure they could do it justice.  Does it live up to what I consider the best Batman story ever told?  Well.... Yes and no.Ever since the Batman Animated series, whenever I read a Batman comic, I can only hear one voice. To me Kevin Conroy is the definitive voice of Batman.  I'm not sure why he hasn't been utilized in a lot of these DC comic movies or in the Young Justice series.  Every recent animation has me saying ""It would be better with Kevin Conroy!""  I tried not to let this get to me, but this Batman sounds a lot like Bane in the new Batman movie.  That or Billy Zane holding in a huge dump!Let me start with the positives!  DC animated movies always have stellar animation.  This is no exception.  They mimic the comic style of the source material perfectly.  It was exhilarating seeing Frank Miller's pencils come to life.  The art is definately the high point.  The script does a very good job adapting the comic.  There are extra scenes and it is out of order a little from the comic, but all in all it was very good.This movie left me excited for the conclusion!  I'm glad they did it justice and spread it over 2 movies so they can cover everything.  This is a great way to introduce people to The Dark Knight Returns and hopefully they go and read the comics.  His Batman Year One was integral to the recent Batman Movies.  300 and Sin City movies were incredibly well done and it was all due to staying true to the source material.  This is a lesson all movie makers need to take note of.  Just use the source material and don't ""Michael Bay"" your movie!  This is something this movie should have done.Something started bothering me half way through and I couldn't put my finger on it.  It was only until my girlfriend start asking me: ""why would Batman do this or that? ""What is he thinking?"" ""What does that mean?"" that it hit me.  There was no patented Frank Miller inner monlogue in the script!  I have read the comic hundreds of times and I think because of this, I was correcting it on my own.  The Sin City movie nailed it, this movie ignored it.This is as close to having a movie adaptation you are ever going to see, it's just to bad that they screwed up on something so crucial.  If you can ignore the bad voice acting for Batman and forgive the lack of inner monologue (or fill it in yourself) this is definately worth checking out!

1575137,A2FYVMYJAUOH34,B008RV5K4U,"David S,","[0, 0]","The original ""Dark Knight Returns"" graphic novel re-defined the concept of the term ""superhero"" while it paid hommage to the classic tale of the gallant champion who hangs up his sword/gun/weapon of choice to live a peaceful life only to find out that it doesn't fit him nor does it benefit the world that he lives in. This movie adaptation picks up the essence of that story but I felt that something was deeply missing when Bruce Wayne's/Batman's internal thoughts were removed during the creation of this film.While I can't honestly say that I loved the finished product, I can't say that I hate it either. It's true to the essence of the printed page but it could have been TRUER if the filmakers focused on ALL of the words as well as the images of the original story. ""Sin City - The Movie"" is living proof that it could be done and it was a purer interpretation of a comic book masterpiece than THIS film was! Perhaps the creators of this project should have watch THAT film to see how Frank Miller tells a story with words as powerfully as he does with pictures and revealing that two mediums, words and pictures, working together can be far more effective than one in the right hands!As a child, I've owned Classic Illustrated Comics/Golden Records combination packs of several literary classics, ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""The Time Machine"" among them. I enjoyed listening to the records while I was reading the comics and appreciated the adapted stories even more as a result of using this method. Perhaps using a similar technique, read the original book while watching the film, is the best way to enjoy the central story rather than just watching it on the screen. At least a new viewer would understand why Bruce Wayne's story nearly ended in the opening act, what he was thinking during his tense battle scenes and why this film was made in the first place while a fan of the graphic novel can re-read it while enjoying a well-presented soundtrack and moving pictures!Just a thought.",3,Consider reading the graphic novel WHILE you're watching this film...,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2000,"['original', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'graphic', 'novel', 're-defined', 'concept', 'term', 'superhero', 'paid', 'hommage', 'classic', 'tale', 'gallant', 'champion', 'who', 'up', 'sword/gun/weapon', 'choice', 'live', 'peaceful', 'life', 'only', 'find', 'out', ""n't"", 'fit', 'benefit', 'world', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'up', 'essence', 'story', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'deeply', 'missing', 'when', 'Bruce', ""Wayne's/Batman"", 'internal', 'thoughts', 'were', 'removed', 'creation', 'film.While', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'loved', 'finished', 'product', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'hate', 'true', 'essence', 'printed', 'page', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'TRUER', 'filmakers', 'focused', 'ALL', 'words', 'as', 'well', 'images', 'original', 'story', 'Sin', 'City', 'Movie', 'living', 'proof', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'was', 'purer', 'interpretation', 'comic', 'book', 'masterpiece', 'THIS', 'film', 'was', 'Perhaps', 'creators', 'project', 'should', 'have', 'watch', 'THAT', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'story', 'words', 'as', 'powerfully', 'pictures', 'revealing', 'two', 'mediums', 'words', 'pictures', 'working', 'together', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'one', 'right', 'hands', 'child', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'Classic', 'Illustrated', 'Comics/Golden', 'Records', 'combination', 'packs', 'several', 'literary', 'classics', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'Time', 'Machine', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'records', 'was', 'reading', 'comics', 'appreciated', 'adapted', 'stories', 'even', 'more', 'result', 'using', 'method', 'Perhaps', 'using', 'similar', 'technique', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'watching', 'film', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'central', 'story', 'rather', 'just', 'watching', 'screen', 'least', 'new', 'viewer', 'would', 'understand', 'why', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'story', 'nearly', 'ended', 'opening', 'act', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'tense', 'battle', 'scenes', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'fan', 'graphic', 'novel', 'can', 're-read', 'enjoying', 'well-presented', 'soundtrack', 'moving', 'pictures', 'Just', 'thought']",N/A

Someone needs to strike back at the criminals, and reawaken the social consciousness. There is a rumbling in Bruce Wayne's soul... something that he's locked away is teeming to get out.The Graphic Novel, The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller is quite possibly the greatest Batman story of all time. Fans have been begging for an adaptation since the mid-90s. Whatever the final product was, fans would hold it to the highest of standards. As a result, it becomes difficult to view the film and not see everything they left out.I knew they'd have to soften it a little, at his best Frank Miller's pen is like a sledgehammer, knocking the wind out of you every chance he gets. I knew they'd have to sand down that edge. If it was just going to be a direct translation of the book, why even make a movie, you can just read the book. I know these things. But the biggest flaw in the adaptation is they excised the narration from the book. I know Narration doesn't ""work"" in a visual medium, but by removing the narration completely, I really feel they cut out the heart and soul of the original work.The result is no matter how well the rest is executed, it feels a bit hollow.But, if you're part of the group that was never exposed to the source material, then you're going to see Batman like you've never seen him before. An old man dispensing vigilante justice, striking back at misguided youths, and wrestling the power away from corruption and giving it back to the people. The only work he's ever done.I'm not going to be critical of the voice cast. I'm not going to demand they cast Kevin Conroy in everything. Peter Weller is fine by me, and I like the girl from Modern Family as Carrie.I wanted to give this Blu-ray a 4.5 out of 5, but I'm disappointed in the special features.""Her Name Is Carrie... Her Role is Robin"" - A 12-minute featurette about Carrie Kelly, the firs female Robin and other girl characters.""Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story"" - A 1-Hour Documentary about Bob Kane, creator of Batman, which was already included in Batman: Gotham Knight (which I already own).2 Episodes from Batman the Animated Series: Two-Face, part 1 and part 2. Which might be the only way to get theses episodes on Blu-ray for a long time.Sneak Peak at Batman: The Dark Knight Retuns (part 2). Still LOOKS good, and I can't wait to hear Michael Emerson as the joker. He really pulls off an Old Joker in the preview.A digital comic and trailers pad out the disk.No commentary and a documentary I already own. And they didn't get Frank Miller to appear anywhere at all. I don't hate the movie, but I stand by that it's missing the charm of the original. Every fan of Batman should watch this, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Because the feature feels hollow and the special features don't save it, I give it overall 4-out-of-5.

I fear the end result may be a less-dense arching plotline, especially as most of the political commentary was removed from this chapter (presumably as it won't be relevant until the second) but there's still more than enough pulp to go around. While the storyline is doggedly faithful (indeed, most of the dialog is copied verbatim from the source), the artwork is both influenced by and notably distanced from Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's amazing work on the printed page.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","In the early 1980's, comics veteran Frank Miller penned what many critics claim is one of the greatest graphic stories ever.  It was called THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and it told the story of an old and gray Bruce Wayne.  He'd long ago given up being the Batman - not because of any one reason in particular, though there was an obvious combination of events that culminated in Wayne hanging up the cape - and the streets of Gotham City quickly regressed into lawlessness.  Alleys once safe were now havens for murder, theft, and rape.  Based on the title alone, the reader knew that it was only a matter of time before Wayne threw off whatever reservations he had about serving his cause.  It was only a matter of circumstance before the Batmobile's engines were fueled once more, and, then, the dark night would belong once more to the Dark Knight.Warner Bros. recognized a good thing, and, based on the reaction to Miller's work, studio executives immediately authorized creative folks to begin thinking about a Batman movie franchise - something that had long been in limbo - and ... well, the rest really is history.  1989 saw Timothy Burton's BATMAN movie, loosely playing in the same dark, gothic style introduced in Miller's earlier work.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few, modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Bruce Wayne has grown old.  Batman has retired.  It's been ten years since the Bat has been on the streets, dispensing whatever form of justice he deemed necessary, and Gotham City has suffered because of it.  On the verge of his retirement, Commissioner Gordon faces a new threat - a crazy army of street toughs calling themselves `The Mutants' want the policeman's head on a silver platter - and only the return of the cape and the cowl can bring about an end to the madness.  But ... what will Batman's return mean for the city-at-large?For the record, I've been reading Batman comics since the early 70's - yes, kiddies, I'm that old - but I was never that huge a fan of Miller's tale.  I thought it was inspired.  I thought it was ground-breaking.  I even thought it was a tale worth telling.  But Miller had incorporated some artistic and political messaging throughout much of TDKR's that just didn't tickle my fancy.  I much preferred the first half of his epic - the one detailing Wayne's more personal discover that he couldn't sit by and watch himself and Gotham decay any longer - as opposed to the second half, which dipped into heavy political allegory.Thus, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 1) is just what the doctor ordered.  It explores exactly those elements that rung my bell back in the 80's when I first read the story.  It's an excessively faithful adaptation, even incorporating Miller's ongoing `talking heads' storytelling of having news anchors, pundits, and pop culture psychologists sounding off on the state of affairs - the story within the story.  These are high personal stakes - ones that pit Wayne against himself as much as they do any physical adversary - and that's why the reward is so great.  Plus, there's an underlying element - a wonderful hint at things-to-come - because everyone knows that the Batman's return will prompt a parade of the lunatic criminal element to follow suit.I'd be remiss if I didn't point out how stunning the voice work was in Part 1.  Peter Weller (of ROBOCOP fame) does a masterful job balancing out Bruce Wayne and Batman; he sounds perfect in the part, bringing with it the stellar mix of wisdom and enthusiasm one can imagine the playboy millionaire might possess at this ripe age.  And I was surprised how much I quickly took to ABC TV's MODERN FAMILY star, Ariel Winter, as Carrie Kelley, the next incarnation to don the suit of Robin, the Boy (now `girl') Wonder.  There's a delightful blend of youthful ignorance back up by just the right smidgen of contemporary snarkyness to pull it off, and Ms. Winter deserves accolades.THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 1) is produced by Warner Premiere, DC Entertainment, and Warner Bros. Animation.  DVD distribution is being handled through Warner Home Video.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds exceptional.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  It's a direct-to-DVD-DC-movie, and, so far as this reviewer is concerned, their track record is solid enough to make this worth a single view.  THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS (Part 1) is the best part of Frank Miller's THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.  It's a smart adaptation - faithful as it could be - and it shows how one could easily imagine an aging Bruce Wayne refusing to accept anything less from himself, the Batman, and Gotham City.  Plus, the vocal talents are some great, inspired choices, giving these characters the needed dimension to bring animation to life.  Beware the Bat, indeed ... especially when he gets older.",5,"Thank Goodness, THE DARK KNIGHT Is Back!",1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,5106,"['early', '1980', 'comics', 'veteran', 'Frank', 'Miller',

That being said, my favorite story arch is The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. I first read it about 4 or 5 years ago, and I have been hard pressed to find a better graphic novel. It's dark, emotional, and provocative. Bruce Wayne is not a nice man, and he is finally at his breaking point. I always wanted an adaptation of this graphic novel, but with some hesitation. I knew that an adaptation would be easy to mess up, so this is why I approached this film with a lot of apprehension. I am happy to report that the crew over at DC has done a bang up job of bringing my favorite Batman graphic novel to life. Peter Wellers does a fantastic job of portraying an old and grizzled Batman, and Ariel Winter is great as Robin. The animation is top-notch, and the music is amazing. All in all, this film is worthy of carrying the title of The Dark Knight Returns. I am glad that they decided to split it up into 2 parts. A 90-minute or 2 hour adaptation would have had to sacrifice many things from the graphic novel, and that would have hurt the integrity of the source material. Highly recommended to Batman fans, and highly recommended to fans of the original graphic novel.

1575152,A295L7HFVKQPTO,B008RV5K4U,EO,"[0, 1]","Just like the elder Gotham cop tells the rookie, you're in for a show!  Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was and still is one of the best Batman stories ever told...period.  To see it very faithfully adapted for DC's animated movies is great.  Plus, they are trying to condense this story into the usual 65-70 minutes they do normally for their recent movies; they are making it longer to fully tell this tale the way it should be told.Granted, I feel they could've just produced a long 2 hour animated movie in one package instead of making us wait.  But in a way that's half the fun...leave them wanting, even begging, for more!  Which is what this story did in the first place when it came out.  This story almost single handedly turned Batman into DC's number one superhero.  Which I think is cool even being an overall Superman fan.  Speaking of the Man of Steel...Superman kind of becomes the bad guy in this story.  He's still technically on the side of right but he's a pawn, a puppet to be used at the beck and call of the government...which Supes allowed to happen!  Batman's presence is seen as a black hole on the ""law & order"" of the times in this story.  Superman is called in to stop him, and seems to agree why!  Before this story, Supes and Bats were always portrayed as close friends.  Miller turned that notion upside down and inside out.  He made a good point showing that while both heroes stand up against evil; their views on how to do it are completely different.I'm happy to see this story come to life and see the action.  The only thing better would be a live action version.  Ultimately this is no doubt going to be one of the gems in the DC Animated Movie crown.  I'd even like to see them do the sequel, ""The Dark Knight Strikes Again"", even though that story wasn't as good but it is the conclusion to the story.

From the moment I heard that Peter Weller would voice Batman/Bruce Wayne, I had very high hopes.

It's not a disappointment - it leaves us wanted to watch Part Two RIGHT THEN. Flawless execution.The special features are not up to par. Other reviewers have cited the fact that this graphic novel CHANGED the way we read the Batman comics forever. It's not just a tagline, it's truth. So I have to agree that I would love to see a few retrospectives on this sparking bit of social commentary. Maybe it'll get released with the next volume.And most surprisingly, we see a 'sneak peak' into the 'up-coming' Superman/Batman ""Public Enemies. Really? Didn't that come out like two year's ago?Despite the ball being fumbled behind the scenes, the feature it self is breath-taking, shocking, and awesome.

After the release of ""Batman: Year One,"" the only logical choice for the Caped Crusader's next solo animated feature was evident. It was time for Frank Miller's other beloved and critically acclaimed graphic novel to be adapted for the screen.Frank Miller's ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" not only had an effect on the entire comic book industry, it influenced director Tim Burton to make a serious film adaptation based on the super hero that turned into a multi-billion dollar franchise. Many fans and historians would say it is responsible for the popularity of comic book movies today.It's been ten years since Batman's last appearance in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne has retired the cape and cowl for a life of tedium and drinking. He meets occasionally with Commissioner Gordon for drinks and to talk about the state of the world. Gordon knows Wayne's secret and is one of his only confidants.Bruce begins having horrible nightmares about his parents' deaths and witnesses Gotham City digress even further into the depths of depravity at the hands of a new criminal syndicate calling themselves the Mutants. He's driven to suit up once again to take on the homicidal maniacs and show the citizens of Gotham City that they need not live in fear any longer.""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1"" is the best animated feature film DC and Warner Premiere have released. There's no other way of putting it. It feels epic and holds a cinematic flare that the other entries in the DC animated super hero movie franchise haven't accomplished. That's not to say they aren't good or worthy of praise. However, this takes the medium to a whole new level.The animation is top notch and, although it doesn't mimic Frank Millers artwork for the book, there's a certain respect towards the unique style of the illustrations reflected in the film. Batman is larger than life and as bulky as the Hulk, but isn't quite as ""abstract"" as Miller's interpretation of him in the graphic novel. This is as close to a perfect representation of the book as I can imagine.My only complaint is that there are a few spots where the plot jumps around a bit and gets a little hard to follow. They jump from one thing to the next so quickly with brief or no explanation. The viewer is left to just keep up and embrace the fast pacing once the movie gets rolling.Peter Weller does a wonderful job bringing an older and weary Bruce Wayne to life. When he hits the streets for the first time in ten years, you can hear the satisfaction in his voice at re-embracing his long-forgotten mission of ridding the streets of Gotham City of the filth and crime that overtakes it.The Blu-ray version of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1"" consists of quite a few treats for fans. There's a sneak peek of Part 2 and ""Batman / Superman: Public Enemies."" Two featurettes are included entitled ""Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story"" and ""Her Name is Carrie... Her Role is Robin."" There are also two bonus cartoons from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" featured.

Roby,"[3, 3]","I have really been liking the new DC animated movies that have been coming out over the past couple years, I think they do an exceptionally good job on the Batman movies. When this one came out I had to pick it up.For those not aware, or that savvy, when it comes to the Batman Comics(myself included) this movie is based upon the pivotal and epic graphic novel/run of Batman comics, with the same title, written by the renowned Frank Miller (Sin City, 300, ...etc) . I personally have not read the entire collection, but it is pretty well known that this story, released in the mid to late 1980's, was one of the pivotal works, that brought Batman back into the public eye, and really helped to re-define the character. After this story was released, the ""Adam West Batman"" of the 1960s was finally set to rest, and the gritty/dark Batman mythos took the forefront in public's mind. This story set the stage for the Tim Burton films, and their dark setting. In addition, this story was released at the time where comic books were making their shift from child to more mature audiences: this story solidified that.This story is about the return of Batman, after retirement, to once again clean the streets of Gotham City. Unlike most Batman stories this movie does not really include many members of the ""Rogues Gallery"" but focuses on his clash with some new villains. I do not want to give away too much of the story for those who have not read or watched the story, but it is pretty cool to see a Batman story set in setting not so familiar to most Batman fans. Due to the size of the story, DC has decided to release this story in two separate movies. While this might piss some people off, I think it was a pretty good move, and kept them from skimping over the details and content, in order to meet the format. The story is very engaging, and lets the viewer see characters in a very different yet familiar wayLike most current DC animated movies, the animation has a anime' influenced style. I would not say that I really enjoyed the animation, but you can see that the some of the original ""Frank Miller"" look was kept. I personally would have preferred the movie be almost a complete Frank Miller graphic novel brought to life, but I am not sure if that would have marketed well. In short, I think DC settled for a nice middle ground, when bringing this story to life.The only complaint I really have with this DVD is the special features. We do get a sneak peak into part 2 of this series, which is cool, but besides some trailers, not much is offered, maybe because this is a one disc version of the movie, and maybe they will release a two disc version with more stuff. I would have really like to see a documentary on the original graphic novel, highlighting it's influence on the world of comics, included with this DVD.",4,Another great DCU movie for the teenage/adult viewer.,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,2834,"['have', 'really', 'been', 'liking', 'new', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'out', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'think', 'do', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'job', 'Batman', 'movies', 'When', 'one', 'came', 'had', 'pick', 'up.For', 'not', 'aware', 'savvy', 'when', 'Batman', 'Comics', 'included', 'movie', 'based', 'pivotal', 'epic', 'graphic', 'novel/run', 'Batman', 'comics', 'same', 'title', 'written', 'renowned', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Sin', 'City', '300', 'etc', 'personally', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'entire', 'collection', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'story', 'released', 'mid', 'late', '1980', 'was', 'one', 'pivotal', 'works', 'brought', 'Batman', 'back', 'public', 'eye', 'really', 'helped', 're-define', 'character', 'story', 'was', 'released', 'Adam', 'West', 'Batman', '1960s', 'was', 'finally', 'set', 'rest', 'gritty/dark', 'Batman', 'mythos', 'took', 'forefront', 'public', 'mind', 'story', 'set', 'stage', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'dark', 'setting', 'addition', 'story', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'where', 'comic', 'books', 'were', 'making', 'shift', 'child', 'more', 'mature', 'audiences', 'story', 'solidified', 'that.This', 'story', 'return', 'Batman', 'retirement', 'once', 'again', 'clean', 'streets', 'Gotham', 'City', 'most', 'Batman', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'include', 'many', 'members', 'Rogues', 'Gallery', 'clash', 'new', 'villains', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'watched', 'story', 'pretty', 'cool', 'see', 'Batman', 'story', 'set', 'setting', 'not', 'so', 'familiar', 'most', 'Batman', 'fans', 'Due', 'size', 'story', 'DC', 'decided', 'release', 'story', 'two', 'separate', 'movies', 'might', 'piss', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'move', 'kept', 'skimping', 'details', 'content', 'order', 'meet', 'format', 'story', 'very', 'engaging', 'viewer', 'see', 'characters', 'very', 'different', 'yet', 'familiar', 'most', 'current', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'animation', 'anime', 'influenced', 'style', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'animation', 'can', 'see', 'original', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'look', 'was', 'kept', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'movie', 'be', 'almost', 'complete', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'graphic', 'novel', 'brought', 'life', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'marketed', 'well', 'short', 'think', 'DC', 'settled', 'nice', 'middle', 'ground', 'when', 'bringing', 'story', 'life.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'really', 'have', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'do', 'get', 'sneak', 'peak', 'part', '2', 'series', 'cool', 'trailers', 'not', 'much', 'offered', 'maybe', 'one', 'disc', 'version', 'movie', 'maybe', 'will', 'release', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'more', 'stuff', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'documentary', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'highlighting', 'influence', 'world', 'comics', 'included', 'DVD']",N/A

1575167,A35IJCX9BALIM2,B008RV5K4U,G B Busby,"[0, 0]","This happens to be a fairly faithful adaptation of the acclaimed graphic novel.  There are some differences but nothing that would ruin the experience as a whole.  The fact that it has a PG-13 rating isn't much of an issue or handicap, there are only a few things that have been toned down from the graphic novel.  I'm not totally convinced that without the toned down moments that the movie would have received an R rating, but it would probably have been too close for producers, etc.The biggest issue I have is that the graphic novel was broken up into two films, bleh.  This one covers the graphic novel up to the conclusion of the mutant gang storyline.It does have some other issues though that should be mentioned with the voice casting and direction.Peter Weller does an adequate job as Bruce Wayne/Batman but for some reason the almost monotone gravitas of his voice doesn't seem to matchup with the animation style on screen.  I don't blame Weller for this, that fault lies squarely at the directors doorstep.  Beyond that, and in all truthfulness, the remaining supporting voice cast is irrelevant.  I wonder if the studio could have sprung a for a few extra bucks to hire some other celebrities (at least enough for the B or C list level of celebrity).There is also the occasional blunder, the one that stands out most glaringly in my mind is this, after Batman has come out of retirement and is chasing three crooks into an abandoned building, he turns to the two pursuing police officers and yell's &#34;These men are mine!&#34;, at least in the graphic novel.  In the movie it's just a statement told with less emotion the a quarterly economic report for lower Albania.  This manages to miss the mark on two levels, failing to translate the scene adequately from the graphic novel and at the same time manages to fail as a scene from a film perspective.The film version also removes one of the more controversial moments from the film that was in the graphic novel.  Specifically when Batman rescues the kidnapped child from the mutants he does not pursue the same resolution in the film that he does in the graphic novel (I've been purposefully vague on this point to avoid spoilers in either the film or the graphic novel) needless to say, they went the PG-13 route completely.",4,"A Good Adaptation, but not without flaws",1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,2294,"['be', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'acclaimed', 'graphic', 'novel', 'are', 'differences', 'nothing', 'would', 'ruin', 'experience', 'whole', 'fact', 'PG-13', 'rating', ""n't"", 'much', 'issue', 'handicap', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'graphic', 'novel', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'convinced', 'toned', 'down', 'moments', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'R', 'rating', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'close', 'producers', 'etc.The', 'biggest', 'issue', 'have', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'broken', 'up', 'two', 'films', 'bleh', 'one', 'graphic', 'conclusion', 'mutant', 'gang', 'storyline.It', 'have', 'other', 'issues', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'voice', 'casting', 'direction.Peter', 'Weller', 'adequate', 'job', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'reason', 'almost', 'monotone', 'gravitas', 'voice', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matchup', 'animation', 'style', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Weller', 'fault', 'squarely', 'directors', 'doorstep', 'Beyond', 'truthfulness', 'remaining', 'supporting', 'voice', 'cast', 'irrelevant', 'wonder', 'studio', 'could', 'have', 'sprung', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', 'hire', 'other', 'celebrities', 'least', 'enough', 'B', 'C', 'list', 'level', 'celebrity', 'also', 'occasional', 'blunder', 'one', 'out', 'most', 'glaringly', 'mind', 'Batman', 'come', 'retirement', 'chasing', 'three', 'crooks', 'abandoned', 'building', 'two', 'pursuing', 'police', 'officers', 'yell', '34', 'men', 'are', 'mine', '34', 'least', 'graphic', 'novel', 'movie', 'just', 'statement', 'told', 'less', 'emotion', 'quarterly', 'economic', 'report', 'lower', 'Albania', 'miss', 'mark', 'two', 'levels', 'failing', 'translate', 'scene', 'adequately', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'time', 'manages', 'fail', 'scene', 'film', 'perspective.The', 'film', 'version', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'controversial', 'moments', 'film', 'was', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Specifically', 'when', 'Batman', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'mutants', 'not', 'pursue', 'same', 'resolution', 'film', 'graphic', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'purposefully', 'vague', 'point', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'film', 'graphic', 'novel', 'needless', 'say', 'went', 'PG-13', 'route', 'completely']",N/A

The comic is a masterpiece and you can tell that the filmmakers realize this. This film takes the comic and stretches it a bit further into what you'd expect to come out of Warner Bros animated Batman film. It really is an even more comprehensive story, if that is even possible. The comic is 4 issues of absolute greatness. The thing to note is that this film is only the first part of the story, which is really the first two issues of the comic.

1575180,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008RV5K4U,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 7]","I have a comic vlog on YouTube in which I discuss mostly each week's comic releases, but occasionally I throw in a subject video about this or that, and one that I felt that I was compelled to do was one about the year 1986, or as I call it, The Year That Changed Comics Forever. You had two major releases in the same year. One was Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' WATCHMEN, which for the first time, really introduced the deconstruction of the superhero to the comic book world, and holds the spot for the only comic book to be considered one of Time Magazine's Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century. The other was from a very popular writer/artist who had come from an extraordinary run on DAREDEVIL to DC Comics in 1985 with a strange and wonderful avant-garde fusion of a dystopian future blended with ancient Eastern mythology called RONIN. This still-young artist then, in 1986, decided to create a future vision of one of DC's most beloved and iconic characters that was brutal, dark, uncompromising and socially conscious. That man was Frank Miller, and that book that he created is one of the undisputed masterpieces in Comic Book history: BATMAN - THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS starts with a simple premise: It's the future, and it has been exactly ten years to the day that Gotham City and the world had their last sighting of Batman. And although it's not explicitly discussed, it is due to a few different things; the main reason being the implied death of a partner, and the other (and this is only an assumption) being that all of Batman's rogue's gallery as well as all elements of organized crime have either left Gotham, are behind bars or dead, or are in Arkham Asylum. So we have Bruce Wayne, a somewhat empty shell of a man trying his best to enjoy his retirement. We also have Commisioner Jim Gordon, facing his own mandatory retirement. The two are friends moreso than they ever were before because Gordon now knows that Bruce was Batman. This future is far from perfect though. The criminals of this era are products of a very new generation. They call themselves The Mutants, and they are not a gang of unruly kids; they are thrill-seeker killers that run around the city butchering children and nuns and anyone they want to show their depravity. Bruce, still a haunted man, and still very much an obsessive man, can no longer continue to ignore the threat they pose. And on a storm-toss'd night, suddenly The Batman reappears to wage his one-man war on crime.Now, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is far more than that description. It is epic in its scale of emotional storytelling arcs and the amount of characters it has; it's epic in its battles; it's epic because it needs to be. A return of Batman after a 10-year absence requires something of such a grand scale that a mere 70-odd minutes would not be enough to contain it. So the adaptation by Bob Goodman and the direction by Jay Oliva smartly divided this into two segments and this film is Part One, which covers the first two chapters (THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS; THE DARK KNIGHT TRIUMPHANT) of Miller's four-chapter tale. And sometime in 2013, we'll get Part Two. Unlike the previous Miller adaptation to be made by DC Animated, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, which was compact enough to be parsed into about 70 minutes of film, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is frankly too large for that.Now, many of the less-than-or-moderately-positive reviews of this film from people who are fans of the source material are upset because they feel the film waters down so many of the elements of the savagery and biting social commentary that made the book into what it is. And I can totally understand and appreciate that point of view. There was stuff in the film that wasn't in the book and vice versa. There were lines of dialogue from the book I desperately wanted to hear the gruff voice of Peter Weller, playing Bruce Wayne/Batman, say on screen. But for the most part, they kept a great deal of the brutality in, like the scene with The Mayor and The Mutant Leader is the one that sticks out heaviest in my mind. There are moments of instantly recognizable panel composition from the book, including the immortal image of a silhouetted Batman brightly backlit by a lightning bolt. Much of the stylized street slang of the Mutants is present.But film, live-action or animated, is a much different animal than comics. Comics can offer so many different styles of narrative. Such as internal monologue that you can read into the mind of your characters, giving you insight, and while that's great on the page, it can really hurt your momentum in a film. Oliva ignores almost all of the internal monologue, except for a pretty glaring scene in which he decides to use it. That moment is very important, but because we are treated to the internal monologue there, the viewer who is familiar with the source material wants more, leading to the aforementioned disconnect. It really proves the old chestnut of how you can please some people some of the time, but you can't please everyone all the time.From a casting standpoint, Andrea Romano (who's been at this game for decades) assembles a list of great voice actors that are largely character actors that have appeared in some films and a lot of television. Weller is spot-on perfect. He has just enough of the world-weariness, but enough of the gravelly intonation that makes Batman a true bad@$$. David Selby, of shows like the original DARK SHADOWS and FALCON CREST, does an excellent job as the aging Gordon. Wade Williams, who has been in just about every television show from the 90's through today (and was even the Warden of Blackgate prison in Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) does a commendable job as the ""rehabilitated"" Harvey Dent. The real standouts here for me were young actress Ariel Winter as the voice of Carrie Kelley aka Robin and Michael McKean (THIS IS SPINAL TAP, and was even Perry White in TV's SMALLVILLE) as psychologist Bartholomew Wolper. Winter gives the youthful energy and strength that Carrie needs, and McKean gives the right air of pompous superiority as Wolper.The animation style doesn't totally ape that of Miller, but it certainly shows its influence with its heavy use of almost cube-like faces and enormous hulking bodies that give the characters that even-larger-than-life aesthetic. Occasionally, in particular with vehicle sequences, the movement gets bogged down by CGI, which can be really jarring. But the fight and action choreography is very fluid and the big fights are very brutal.DC Animated Films, under the auspices of mastermind Bruce Timm, have made quite a name for themselves since 1992, when BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES first premiered. That groundbreaking series made way for what is now considered the DC Animated Universe. They've recently been releasing a slew of nearly full-length animated films based on either some of the more famous characters or some extremely popular comic book story arcs, from characters like WONDER WOMAN and GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT or GREEN LANTERN: EMERALD KNIGHTS (which are not from a specific story arc) to SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES, JUSTICE LEAGUE DOOM, BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, THE NEW FRONTIER, and SUPERMAN VS. THE ELITE. These have worked to varying degrees of success, but THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART ONE is one of the more successful attempts at bringing something to the screen that is something of an impossible undertaking. They know that there are legions of fans that consider DKR their ""Batman Bible"", and trying to please all of them by simply translating the book page-for-page would have been a disaster. You have to have enough surprising moments in the film that will keep the audience on its toes, or you might as well do a motion comic.My main complaint with this film is that I don't know how successful it will be as a storytelling experience unless you're familiar with the source material. I think that there's too much included that, just from a style standpoint, is really going to be confusing for fresh eyes to see it. I have faith in the audience, but I think that the only reason that I'm giving this four instead of five stars is because I don't think that newcomers to this tale will be able to get as much out of it as they should because of its very faithful adaptation.As it is, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART ONE should please longtime fans of the comic, but might not appeal to the newer fans as much as the Nolan Batman films have been able to do.",4,An almost-impossible task surprisingly well-executed.,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,8514,"['have', 'comic', 'vlog', 'YouTube', 'discuss', 'mostly', 'week',

The adaptation of Year One was very bland and rushed and they made many changes that made no sense to me. The acting was sub par and the animation and music did not come close to matching the feel of the comic.I'm relieved that TDKR part I doesn't share the same problems as the Year One adaptation. This one almost feels like a high quality theatrical film and not at all like a straight-to-dvd flick. Like Year One, This isn't a panel for panel accurate adaptation, but the changes they made here aren't as silly. For example, The Mutant Leader grins when he sees his gang gathered, just before Batman tackles him. That is not in the comic, but I thought that was a pretty nice touch. I'm also glad this was split into two parts because it needed to be.The voice acting was top-notch. Peter Weller was perfectly cast as an older Bruce/Batman. Conroy would have felt out of place here so I'm glad they went with Weller. Same goes for the rest of the cast, great performances. The music was my favorite part of this because it has a very 80s feel. It also sets the mood of the film so nicely, as a score should. There's even a scene where Bruce is passing some gang members who are blasting 80s pop from a boombox. The one downside for me is the animation, It's well animated and the simplified Miller designs are great, but it's a tad bright in some places and too colorful in others. For the most part, this movie looks very much like an animated version of Miller's classic graphic novel. So this still gets 5 stars from me.

Some character design was lacking...but that is the sole criticism I can give it (other than the terrible cover art, which should have been the iconic silhouette against the lightning). I knew the guys at DC knew full well that if they fouled this up, it would be a big mistake. They also knew to get the full scope of this story, they would have to do two features.

Maines ""Web developer""","[0, 0]","I understand that they needed a longer running time to go into detail with this story, but did they really have to separate the parts into separate products?  I feel like these movies were rushed and meant to serve as cash cows.  That said, if you have the funds to watch both parts, you should enjoy them.  Part 1 was very gritty and somewhat similar in its premise to the Dark Knight Rises film released around the same time, but in my opinion, Dark Knight Returns is better in every way.[ALERT:  Potential spoilers below!]Basically, Bruce Wayne has retired from being Batman, and it has been ten years since the Batman was last seen.  The Justice League was disbanded a long time ago, around the time Batman retired.  The city of Gotham is just as terrible as ever due to a gang calling themselves The Mutants.  Harvey Dent (2-Face) is let out of a mental hospital only to go missing.  The Joker is seemingly brain-dead, not eating on his own, not talking, not laughing, sitting in the same mental hospital Harvey left.  The Batman returns to find Harvey and save him from his old ways.  The Mutants also get a wake-up call.In my opinion, Dark Knight Returns is much like Batman Beyond, except without all the futuristic gadgets and a new Batman suit.  It is also a lot more gritty than Batman Beyond.  In many ways, Dark Knight Returns is better for being more believable than the films.  Batman doesn't run around with tons of high-tech vehicles, and his suit does not protect him at all.  He doesn't come off as a millionaire.  He uses his wits and combat training to defeat all his villains.  That said, he has a tank, a motorcycle, a glider, smoke pellets, his classic grappling hook, and a few other devices.  He just does not come off as rich as he does in the live action films, because he uses technology sparingly.Overall, part 1 is great and very enjoyable.  However, you will want to see part 2 right after it.  Replay value is somewhat high, because it is always fun to see society's reaction to the Batman making his initial appearance.  It is also fun to see the female Robin make her appearance in animated form.  Part 2 has the Superman scenes, which are much more fun to watch, but the story of part 1 is top notch.",4,Prefer both parts in one long experience rather than 2 separated products.,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,2236,"['understand', 'needed', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'go', 'detail', 'story', 'did', 'really', 'have', 'separate', 'parts', 'separate', 'products', 'feel', 'movies', 'were', 'rushed', 'meant', 'serve', 'cash', 'cows', 'said', 'have', 'funds', 'watch', 'parts', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Part', '1', 'was', 'very', 'gritty', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'premise', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'film', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'opinion', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'better', 'way', '[', 'ALERT', 'Potential', 'spoilers', ']', 'Basically', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'retired', 'being', 'Batman', 'been', 'ten', 'years', 'Batman', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'Justice', 'League', 'was', 'disbanded', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'time', 'Batman', 'retired', 'city', 'Gotham', 'just', 'as', 'terrible', 'ever', 'due', 'gang', 'calling', 'Mutants', 'Harvey', 'Dent', '2-Face', 'let', 'mental', 'hospital', 'only', 'go', 'missing', 'Joker', 'seemingly', 'brain-dead', 'not', 'eating', 'own', 'not', 'talking', 'not', 'laughing', 'sitting', 'same', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Harvey', 'left', 'Batman', 'find', 'Harvey', 'save', 'old', 'ways', 'Mutants', 'also', 'get', 'wake-up', 'call.In', 'opinion', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'much', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'futuristic', 'gadgets', 'new', 'Batman', 'suit', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'gritty', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'many', 'ways', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'better', 'being', 'more', 'believable', 'films', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'run', 'around', 'tons', 'high-tech', 'vehicles', 'suit', 'not', 'protect', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'millionaire', 'wits', 'combat', 'training', 'defeat', 'villains', 'said', 'tank', 'motorcycle', 'glider', 'smoke', 'pellets', 'classic', 'grappling', 'hook', 'few', 'other', 'devices', 'just', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'as', 'rich', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'technology', 'sparingly.Overall', 'part', '1', 'great', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'However', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'part', '2', 'right', 'Replay', 'value', 'somewhat', 'high', 'always', 'fun', 'see', 'society', 'reaction', 'Batman', 'making', 'initial', 'appearance', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'female', 'Robin', 'make', 'appearance', 'animated', 'form', 'Part', '2', 'Superman', 'scenes', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'story', 'part', '1', 'top', 'notch']",N/A

1575208,A2A6DO8NC7VTSQ,B008RV5K4U,"J. Wan ""wanchob""","[0, 0]","This is the first of a two part animated translation of Frank Miller's classic work, The Dark Knight Returns.For fans of the original comic, the animation adopts most of the key concepts and visual motifs. It is also quite faithful to the plot and nuances. So if you are looking for a ""faithful"" adaptation this rises to expectations.If you are unfamiliar with that work, it can be a bit tricky. The fundamental part of the legend and myth of Batman are well known so the film makers and Frank Miller can be forgiven in not exploring the background except where it fits their fundamental themes about obsession and finding a meaning to one's life. The story of the rich young man who is scarred by crime as a child and who dedicates his life to fighting crime using his wealth and devoting his life to this end is generally well known. The book and film asks the basic question: what happens after a life time is spent fighting crime and now Batman is an old man? What has he got to show for his efforts? Is the world a better place? Has he made any difference other than to beat up a lot of thugs and crooks?The details about particular villains, key plot themes (like the Batcave, Batmobile, Dick Grayson, and Jason Todd) and relationships (James Gordon, Selina Kyle)are assumed. If you are unclear as to who is Two-Face, Catwoman, and such, you can figure it out with careful viewing and listening to the context of the dialog but frankly that is like reading about the end of Hercules without knowing about the 12 Labors or Mysterious Island without 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and how it affected Captain Nemo. The production values are excellent with smooth animation and the action scenes are well done and faithful to the original comic. The voice acting is also excellent - not the same cast found in the superb Batman: The Animated Series but it is still very well done.SPOILERThe comic and movie points out that one man, even when he is the Batman, can only do so much by himself. He must somehow change the world around him in some lasting way if he is to have any positive legacy. The obsession of Batman forces him to tie up loose ends in the present and the past. The present is manifest in the form of the Mutants, a gang based on raw power and brutality with no subtlety. The past is represented by Two-Face and the Joker. Two-Face, (once Harvey Dent, close friend of Bruce Wayne) forces Bruce to accept that there are some things his good efforts can't fix. The Joker is his classic foe - the irrational psychopath. Batman grasps and easily can deal with rational foes - their actions are predictable and motivations understandable. Counter measures can therefore be taken. The Joker doesn't fit and just wants to play and Batman is the ideal foil. The comic and movie leads us to conclude that Batman can do a lot to help stop rational crime but irrational behavior can't always be treated/cured and by definition may have no sane solution.The world is larger than just Gotham City and when national and international politics intrude, it brings Superman into conflict. Finally Batman accepts that he has not only grown old and can't fight on as he once did, he has to engage the greater world outside of Gotham. To make his life meaningful and leave changes that are lasting he'll have to take on the world's problems. For Batman fans, it leaves the irony that he becomes very similar to his legendary enemy, Ra's al-Ghul. His intentions are clearly better and he isn't willing to see the deaths of millions to achieve his ends, but the final scene of him creating a secret organization working towards his aims and goals while keeping to the shadow and training successful generations to take on the struggle cannot be an accident. Frank Miller must have meant this as a final point and does it nicely with the subtle parallelism with Ra's al-Ghul.",5,Excellent movie - excellent translation of the comic,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3870,"['first', 'two', 'part', 'animated', 'translation', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'classic', 'work', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns.For', 'fans', 'original', 'comic', 'animation', 'most', 'key', 'concepts', 'visual', 'motifs', 'also', 'quite', 'faithful', 'plot', 'nuances', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'expectations.If', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'tricky', 'fundamental', 'part', 'legend', 'myth', 'Batman', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'so', 'film', 'makers', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'not', 'exploring', 'background', 'where', 'fundamental', 'themes', 'obsession', 'finding', 'meaning', 'one', 'life', 'story', 'rich', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'scarred', 'crime', 'child', 'who', 'life', 'fighting', 'crime', 'using', 'wealth', 'devoting', 'life', 'end', 'generally', 'well', 'known', 'book', 'film', 'basic', 'question', 'what', 'life', 'time', 'spent', 'fighting', 'crime', 'now', 'Batman', 'old', 'man', 'What', 'got', 'show', 'efforts', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'made', 'difference', 'other', 'beat', 'up', 'lot', 'thugs', 'crooks', 'details', 'particular', 'villains', 'key', 'plot', 'themes', 'Batcave', 'Batmobile', 'Dick', 'Grayson', 'Jason', 'Todd', 'relationships', 'James', 'Gordon', 'Selina', 'Kyle', 'are', 'assumed', 'are', 'unclear', 'who', 'Two-Face', 'Catwoman', 'such', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'careful', 'viewing', 'listening', 'context', 'dialog', 'frankly', 'reading', 'end', 'Hercules', 'knowing', '12', 'Labors', 'Mysterious', 'Island', '20,000', 'Leagues', 'Sea', 'how', 'affected', 'Captain', 'Nemo', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'smooth', 'animation', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'faithful', 'original', 'comic', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'excellent', 'not', 'same', 'cast', 'found', 'superb', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'done.SPOILERThe', 'comic', 'movie', 'points', 'out', 'one', 'man', 'even', 'when', 'Batman', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'must', 'somehow', 'change', 'world', 'lasting', 'way', 'have', 'positive', 'legacy', 'obsession', 'Batman', 'forces', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'present', 'past', 'present', 'manifest', 'form', 'Mutants', 'gang', 'based', 'raw', 'power', 'brutality', 'subtlety', 'past', 'represented', 'Two-Face', 'Joker', 'Two-Face', 'once', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'close', 'friend', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Bruce', 'accept', 'are', 'things', 'good', 'efforts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fix', 'Joker', 'classic', 'foe', 'irrational', 'psychopath', 'Batman', 'grasps', 'easily', 'can', 'deal', 'rational', 'foes', 'actions', 'are', 'predictable', 'motivations', 'understandable', 'Counter', 'measures', 'can', 'therefore', 'be', 'taken', 'Joker', ""n't"", 'fit', 'just', 'play', 'Batman', 'ideal', 'foil', 'comic', 'movie', 'conclude', 'Batman', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'help', 'stop', 'rational', 'crime', 'irrational', 'behavior', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'treated/cured', 'definition', 'may', 'have', 'sane', 'solution.The', 'world', 'larger', 'just', 'Gotham', 'City', 'when', 'national', 'international', 'politics', 'intrude', 'Superman', 'conflict', 'Finally', 'Batman', 'not', 'only', 'grown', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'once', 'did', 'engage', 'greater', 'world', 'Gotham', 'make', 'life', 'meaningful', 'leave', 'changes', 'are', 'lasting', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'world', 'problems', 'Batman', 'fans', 'irony', 'very', 'similar', 'legendary', 'enemy', 'Ra', 'al-Ghul', 'intentions', 'are', 'clearly', 'better', ""n't"", 'willing', 'see', 'deaths', 'millions', 'achieve', 'ends', 'final', 'scene', 'creating', 'secret', 'organization', 'working', 'aims', 'goals', 'keeping', 'shadow', 'training', 'successful', 'generations', 'take', 'struggle', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accident', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'must', 'have', 'meant', 'final', 'point', 'nicely', 'subtle', 'parallelism', 'Ra', 'al-Ghul']",N/A

1575212,A13VBXAMKNK95X,B008RV5K4U,Kerick Howlett,"[0, 0]","This movie is based off the Frank Miller novel of the same name, where Batman comes out of a long ten year retirement only to return into a Gotham City over ridden by a madness with a bloodthirsty gang known as The Mutants. However, the world is more cynical and cut-throat than most DC Comic Book stories. Half the people are glad that there is once again a Dark Knight lurking in the shadows to strike fear into the hearts of criminals, while the other half consider him as a fascist that is a criminal of not just breaking 'n' entering and batter, but also the civil rights of the very criminals he hunts. He must also fight an even more deranged and even suicidal Two-Face that has now started scratching both sides of his infamous coins, and he must also fight the Mutant leader, a strong brute monster of a man with razor sharp teeth in the prime of his youth, while the Dark Knight is now probably in his late 50's or early 60's.There is a lot going on in this movie, but it is all perfectly pace; not too fast or not too slow. I think that is why they broke it down into two parts so that they can avoid repeating the mistake of &#34;Superman: All-Star&#34;. The adventure and story is gritty, gothic, and dark, everything you'd expect from a story about the Cape Crusader. So if you're looking for a DC Comic Book animated movie that is not at all targeted to kids, this is for you! The animation is flawless and spectacular, and with the high-definition of blu-ray it looks incredible, even if it is indeed animation. Even though there aren't any big names that I recognize in this, all the voice acting is fantastic nonetheless. And throughout the movie there are little Easter Eggs throughout the movie that you may only recognize if you're an avid DC Comic reader.Needless to say, I think this is Warner Bros. DC Animation's finest work that can only be topped by Part Two that about immediately follows the timeline of this movie. I definitely recommend buying this movie!

Batman The Dark Knight Returns was believable beginning to end(am referring to parts 1&2)  Unfortunately I watched them in reverse order, as in my friend put them in the caracelle DVD player in the wrong order and I actually thought I was watching 1 when I was watching two.  When I watched one I quickly realized it was before the holicost and was disappointed the ending  had been spoiled for me.  Anyhow, these are great movies, if your fortunate and have the oppertunity to watch them in order.  Part One deals with the mutants and part two with the holicost. The Joker appears briefly in part two in full action, in one he's only a vegetable.  I didn't think I'd be impressed with any animated movie beyond the 1980's but I was pleased with this.  The voice actors weren't all a bunch of kids, in fact, Batman's voice was very mature and so were all the rest.  The writing and acting were mature, not like Superman Unbound which was as bad as most stuff is today.  BTDKR is extremely violent and that is the way I like it, for that is the way of the world of crime fighting and it should be depicted as such.  I loved it! Just like the graphic novel come to life!

BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART 1... Very satisfied in some regards, a bit bummed and underwhelmed in others. Strongest when it's focusing on Cary Kelly/Robin (despite one painfully bad bit of voice acting) and when dealing with the mutants. As with any film adaptation of a book I love, the question I have to ask myself isn't so much ""Is it as good as the book?"" (these things must be judged on their own merits and all that) but rather ""If I didn't know the source material, would I still even get it?"" Leaning towards: If you want a solidly fun, badass Batman movie, you got it... These yearly animated Batman features have been a joy, and this is a welcome addition. But if you're not familiar with Frank Miller's graphic novel, you'd be forgiven for not understanding why this is considered one of the BEST BATMAN STORIES EVER TOLD. As such, last year's BATMAN: YEAR ONE was way more satisfying, I dare say a cut above two out of three of Nolan's movies in many respects. This one, though, loses a LOT of impact and meaning for lack of Batman and Gordon's voice-over narration... Some visual sequences, for lack of it, became cases of ""Why are we even lingering on this/why is this even here?"" or (such as in flashback to parents' murder) ""Haven't we seen this in EVERY OTHER screen Batman? What's this depiction add?"" Inexplicable abridgments left the Two-Face subplot feeling almost superfluous... Harvey and his history are barely established enough for us to care that he falls straight back into crime, and there's zero suspense about whether or not he will. The more button-pushing controversial aspects are softened around the edges, but still very much present and not nearly as watered/dumbed down as I'd feared. Peter Weller has a fine Batman voice, except a bit too ""zen old wise man,"" not enough ""Psycho-Bats"" edge. Some key smaller scenes are rearranged a bit, in a ways that actually work really well. So does the split into two movies, actually. The fight with the mutant leader makes a fitting build-up/action-climax. Moving a certain cameo to the tale-end cliffhanger was a stroke of genius. Left me far more psyched for Part Two than I might otherwise have been... a reminder that this is, after all (much like Kill Bill) only the first half, and we won't truly have it in perspective 'til we're able to watch both halves.In the context of DC's animated Batman films so far, this felt weirdly as though it was trying to be more of a piece with UNDER THE READ HOOD than YEAR ONE, which isn't necessarily bad, just... weird (the Christopher Drake score - which realizes it's own tuneful Batman theme, despite still trying way too hard to sound like Zimmer/Shore in places - is a big tipoff).",3,Really three 1/2 stars...

Dark Knight Returns part one and two are based Frank Miller's famous comic of the same name. The Dark Knight Returns along with Watchmen is hailed as one of the best comics ever written. I can see why people think that way. Dark Knight Returns is not my favorite Batman but I do respect it and Watchmen. They both dealt with many heavy themes that not to many comics at the time would touch, and they were very dark as well.This review will be on The Dark Knight Returns Part 1. The film revolves around this gang known as the mutants. This gang is wreaking havoc in Gotham, and the police are powerless. At the same time you have an aging Bruce Wayne, who has retired, observing these terrible acts of crime. Ultimately he forces himself back into the game. The story revolves around Batman and his new sidekick, Carrie Kelly a.k.a. Robin, taking back Gotham from the mutants.I really enjoy this film. I do not like these films as much as the animated series or Nolan's Batman films, but I still highly enjoy them. Batman is awesome and more brutal than ever. Despite being old Batman kicks a lot of ass and is very brutal as well. Like Bruce Greenwood in Under the Red Hood, Peter Weller's voice took some getting used to, but it grew on me.The character Carries Kelly surprised me a bit. I've never been that big a fan of Robin. In most incarnations I find him annoying like in Batman and Robin. However, this Robin was not annoying, and can be useful. Although she does not get a whole lot to do in this film, she does have her moments. Ariel Winter did a nice job voicing Carrie.The rest of the voice cast did a good job as well. The art took some getting used to. It is not as appealing to the eyes as other DC animated works. At least they did not use the art from the comic. However, the art grew on me over time. The animation is very smooth which made for some good action. The action is awesome and very well animated. The score was also decent.Overall this and Part 2 is a faithful adaptation to a great comic.

Batman vs. Harvey Dent2. Batman vs. the Mutant gang3. Batman vs. the Joker4. Batman vs. SupermanThis DVD adapts issues 1 and 2 above.Miller's story from 1986 is one of the two DC miniseries (the other being Watchmen) that unfortunately led comics into the so-called ""Dark Age"" of the 90's, when comics had the dark, gritty feel of these books while neglecting to include what actually made these two series great: realistic (well, for comics), adult, intelligent plot-lines, deep characterization, and philosophical/political speculations.  One of the things that made this series (along with Watchmen) unique in its time was that it asked questions like ""why do super-heroes really do what they do?  Are they really ""good"" guys?  Are they, maybe, a little messed-up in the head?""  It began the ""de-construction"" of super-heroes, and made it impossible to look at them the same naive way again.The story features a Bruce Wayne in his 50's who's been ""retired"" as Batman for the past 10 years.  The release of Harvey Dent (previously known as ""Two-Face"") from prison, coinciding with an increase in crime in Gotham city (largely involving a huge street gang calling themselves ""the Mutants"" (an X-Men reference?)) prompts Batman to come out of retirement.  This inspires a young teenage girl, Carrie, to become a new Robin, who will join Batman in his new war on crime.  Towards the end of the film, you'll see the most intense ""Batmobile"" ever seen.The movie does a reasonably good job adapting the story, but it didn't knock my socks off, hence the 4 stars.  I think Peter Weller (Batman/Bruce) and Ariel Winter (Robin/Carrie) did fairly well as the voice actors.  Michael Emerson (Ben from ""Lost"") as the Joker only gets a line or two, but I think he'll do a good job in part 2 (to be released Winter of 2013?)  The artwork does a somewhat good job of matching Miller's work (at one point you get the iconic silhoutte with lightning flash from the book's cover), but it's a little too colorful in comparison with the graphic novel (dark and gritty, people!)  The CGI merges somewhat well with the cell animation, but it's a little distracting.  And yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, practically all the ""interior dialogue"" (and consequently a lot of the best lines) are gone.Single-Disc DVD extras:-Unskippable (but fast-forwardable) previews for ""Thunderstruck"" and a miscelleneous group of DC animated features-Sneak Peek of The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2-Sneak Peek of Superman/Batman Public Enemies: This is an old clip that speaks of the film as if it weren't already available.-Trailers for ""Thundercats"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and an ad for DC Comics online.Rated PG-13 for violence.  It can be pretty brutal, and I think they had to tone it down a little from the original book to keep it below an R rating.If you're in a hurry to find out what happens next, you can read the original graphic novel.(Note: Let's just not even talk about Miller's sequel ""The Dark Knight Strikes Back."")",4,One of the better DC animated adaptations,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,3135,"['4', 'starsOne', 'better', 'DC', 'animated', 'adaptationsBased', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'classic', '4', 'part', 'mini-series', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', ':1', 'Batman', 'Harvey', 'Dent2', 'Batman', 'Mutant', 'gang3', 'Batman', 'Joker4', 'Batman', 'SupermanThis', 'DVD', 'issues', '1', '2', 'above.Miller', 'story', '1986', 'one', 'two', 'DC', 'miniseries', 'other', 'being', 'Watchmen', 'unfortunately', 'led', 'comics', 'so-called', 'Dark', 'Age', '90', 'when', 'comics', 'had', 'dark', 'gritty', 'feel', 'books', 'neglecting', 'include', 'what', 'actually', 'made', 'two', 'series', 'great', 'realistic', 'well', 'comics', 'adult', 'intelligent', 'plot-lines', 'deep', 'characterization', 'philosophical/political', 'speculations', 'One', 'things', 'made', 'series', 'Watchmen', 'unique', 'time', 'was', 'asked', 'questions', 'why', 'do', 'super-heroes', 'really', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Are', 'really', 'good', 'guys', 'Are', 'maybe', 'little', 'messed-up', 'head', 'began', 'de-construction', 'super-heroes', 'made', 'impossible', 'look', 'same', 'naive', 'way', 'story', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', '50', 'who', 'been', 'retired', 'Batman', 'past', '10', 'years', 'release', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'previously', 'known', 'Two-Face', 'prison', 'coinciding', 'increase', 'crime', 'Gotham', 'city', 'largely', 'involving', 'huge', 'street', 'gang', 'calling', 'Mutants', 'X-Men', 'reference', 'Batman', 'come', 'retirement', 'young', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Carrie', 'become', 'new', 'Robin', 'who', 'will', 'join', 'Batman', 'new', 'war', 'crime', 'end', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'most', 'intense', 'Batmobile', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'adapting', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'hence', '4', 'stars', 'think', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Batman/Bruce', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'Robin/Carrie', 'did', 'fairly', 'well', 'voice', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'Ben', 'Lost', 'Joker', 'only', 'line', 'two', 'think', ""'ll"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'part', '2', 'be', 'released', 'Winter', '2013', 'artwork', 'somewhat', 'good', 'job', 'matching', 'Miller', 'work', 'one', 'point', 'get', 'iconic', 'silhoutte', 'lightning', 'flash', 'book', 'cover', 'little', 'too', 'colorful', 'comparison', 'graphic', 'novel', 'dark', 'gritty', 'people', 'CGI', 'somewhat', 'well', 'cell', 'animation', 'little', 'distracting', 'yes', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'practically', 'interior', 'dialogue', 'consequently', 'lot', 'best', 'lines', 'are', 'gone.Single-Disc', 'DVD', 'extras', '-Unskippable', 'fast-forwardable', 'previews', 'Thunderstruck', 'miscelleneous', 'group', 'DC', 'animated', 'features-Sneak', 'Peek', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Returns', 'Part', '2-Sneak', 'Peek', 'Superman/Batman', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'old', 'clip', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'already', 'available.-Trailers', 'Thundercats', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'ad', 'DC', 'Comics', 'online.Rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'think', 'had', 'tone', 'down', 'little', 'original', 'book', 'keep', 'R', 'rating.If', ""'re"", 'hurry', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next', 'can', 'read', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Note', 'Let', 'just', 'not', 'even', 'talk', 'Miller', 'sequel', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Strikes', 'Back']",N/A
1575256,A1RMVTKK7AZSE4,B008RV5K4U,Nolan P. Smith,"[0, 0]","The newest animated feature from DC Entertainment is one of its most anticipated releases, and for good reason. It was The Dark Knight Returns that turned the comic world on its head in the 80&#8242;s. The stark reality, the darkness, even for the Dark Knight, was darker than ever. Batman vs the Mutants. Batman vs The Joker. Batman vs Superman. The storyline is epic, but how did the first part of this animated retelling do: did it do the cowl justice?Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is considered one of the greatest comics of all time, and I agree completely. So, I was overjoyed and a little worried when I heard that it was becoming a two part animated feature. What would they change? What would they ""dumb down""? Would it still feel like The Dark Knight Returns? The answer, I am happy to report, is yes. Part 1 has the look and feel of Frank Miller's classic, and fans really can't ask for more.The story takes place in a world where Batman has been retired for 10 years...and before people moan about ""it's ripping off Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Rises"", remember that this came out in the 80&#8242;s as a comic, back before Joseph Gordon-Levitt was even seeing Angels in the Outfield. Bruce is a shell of a man: cold, out of place, and seeking an end. That all changes when he realizes the rise of the deadly mutants in Gotham, which makes him realize that The Batman is needed. Peter Weller, best known for his starring role in Robocop 1 and 2, voices the aging dark knight, and he does a superb job of doing so. All the voice talents really step it up a notch and create something special, something masterful.Now, what about the violence? Was it toned down? Not by much, thankfully. We still see what happens during a meeting with the Mayor and the Mutant Leader, we see the knock down, drag out fight between Bruce and the Mutant Leader, and we see the new, female Robin, who is this time the young Carrie Kelly. All the parts that made the book for me are present here: the newscasters, the odd speaking mutant gang, the massive and intimidating Bruce Wayne and his ""Batmobile"". For me, this is the best animated film DC has made to date, and that's saying something. I cannot wait for part two, to see The Joker, Clark Kent, Green Arrow, and the Anti-Superman Armor Batman.

Many of the Batman movies have lifted elements of the the original Frank Miller graphic novel.  It doesn't disappoint me as a fan.  In fact, the movie condensed what could have been very long scenes of internal dialogue.  It moves along at a quick pace and is faithful to the source material.  I can't wait for part II.  Peter Weller portrays a 55 year old Batman very accurately.  This Batman doesn't have the physical agility he used to. He has a harder time keeping up, because of his years fighting crime.  It's these scenes that humanized the character and made him realistic.  It's why I loved the graphic novel in the first place.  It deals with aging and coping with change.

1575273,A194GQYVY9HXUP,B008RV5K4U,Ray-Review,"[2, 5]","I will start right off the bat (no pun intended) that I have never read the original adaption of the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller, so the story in this movie is entirely new material to me. As a casual Batman fan, I have enjoyed many different stories and movies of the Batman from different decades. As far as film, I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman The Animated Series, Batman The Mask of the Phantasm and the latest DC Animated film Batman: Under the Red Hood, which was one of the BEST animated Batman films I've seen in a while. I've heard universally that ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is one of the (if not THE) greatest batman story ever written, so making an animated film based on that story should not be surprising, but again I have never read the graphic novel so I can't compare and contrast between the film and novel. I am here merely to critique THIS film, and personally I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be. The Dark Knight Returns is part 1 of 2 movies of the great novel, and part 1 was a decent experience. I found the story to be quite intriguing from beginning to end and seeing what the characters such as Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon have been up to. Bruce Wayne has retired from the cape and cowl for about 10 years and in that time Gotham City has turned into a living hell, where the city has been overrun by a group of criminals called the Mutants committing all sorts of murders like it was nothing. Even crimes such as prostitution and molestation are shown in the movie, and I gotta say this is probably the darkest Batman film I've ever seen. I like the theme of the story, but the pace was very very bad. I feel that this movie could've easily been a 2 hour movie if done correctly, because the events in this movie do not flow as well as other movies with a 75 minute time limit do. I felt the movie was a bit rushed, especially in the beginning of the film. I don't know if the Novel depicted the story like this, but there was just too much going on that it was hard to follow for the first 10-20 minutes or so. Back stories of the Mutants was very vague; they didn't touch upon how the Mutants were established in the first place, especially the leader. The mutants purpose are simple, they follow the leader's orders because he is the biggest and strongest of the city, so naturally he takes over Gotham and corrupts the young and ignorant minds while the Batman is absent. It bothers me that this amount of violence has been occurrinng for so long, and it takes this this long for Bruce Wayne to come back, but once he does come back it's great.The voice acting was my primary hatred for the film. A lot of the voice acting lacked real human emotions or any urgency. I would say I liked about half of the voice acting, Peter Weller (Robocop) was decent as an older Bruce Wayne, but I felt that Kevin Conroy would've done a much better job if he reprised his role as THE voice acting Bat. Commisioner Gordan sounded whiny, but halfway through the movie his voice grew on me. The mutant's leader sounds like a generic villain thug you would expect to hear from any cartoon today. The Mutant Gang themselves sounded like punk kids, which they are, so it didn't bother me as much. The Newscasters were one of the voices that I completely despised, but I acknowledged their purpose. Some of the newscasters were sarcastic and implied some humor, but none of it connected with me. The voices I HATED THE MOST would have to be the voice of female Robin and the voice of the Joker (even though his appearance was short). I really wished Mark Hamill would have returned to do Joker, or even at least John DiMaggio from Under the Red Hood, but this new guy doesn't capture the menacing and twisted Joker I have grown to love. Ariel Winter as Robin....okay I guess my hatred for the character is deeper than just the voice, I guess I just hate everything about the character. I am not sexist in any way, I have no problem with Robin being a girl, but the way they portrayed her in the movie couldn't possibly be any worse. Her motivation to become Robin was forced terribly, there was no point in the movie where she expressed any interest in becoming Robin or helping innocent people, she kind of just became Robin on a whim. The scenario she was in during the film was she and a friend were jumped by the Mutants during the middle of the night, and Batman just so happened to be there and save them, however I didn't sense any urge to fight from Carrie's character during that moment, she just sorta stood there. So I guess she just got inspired to become Robin from there on after seeing what Batman did? Does it sound Stupid? Yes. In that logic, practically ANY KID saved from Batman can become Robin if they wanted to, and in this fictional world, I'm pretty sure there are plenty of Kids that have FAR more potential to become the next Robin. But allow me to continue...During the film, when she was transitioning to become Robin, she was jumping from building to building doing flips and complex aerial movements without any proper training or any background information that hinted she had the ability to do such things in the first place. Dick Grayson (the first Robin) was a gifted gymnast in the circus, Jason Todd (the 2nd Robin) was trained FIRST by Bruce Wayne himself so the physics of their abilities were justified, but Carrie Kelley was just RANDOM. If her character was better in the graphic novel, than I guess the producers just did a BAD job portraying her character in this movie.I have to give credit to the animation. I am not a big fan of American animation, especially DC's animation. Most of their films are so bland with barely any attention to details to characters or environment. While some of their flaws are still present in this movie, such as texture less buildings, I have to say that their animation team did a far better job with this film. Most of Batman's movements are smooth and believable, while some (punching through hard concrete and jumping from 10 story buildings without being hurt) leave a lot to be desired. The fight scenes are good for the most part, once again, if Batman has the ability to punch through concrete with ease, I don't see why it was so difficult to defeat ONE oversized mutant. I appreciated that they choreographed the fights  well, and Batman literally breaks every bone possible to someone at one point which was pretty awesome to watch.I don't know what is going to happen in Part 2, but I hope the writers and producers do a better job with the voice acting and pacing in the next movie. I still enjoyed Part 1 despite it's many many flaws, but if Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is labeled as the greatest Batman story ever written, than this movie did a horrible job of convincing me. I have to wait for Part 2 to give my full opinion on that statement.",3,The Dark Knight Returns in a 2-Part Epic,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,6890,"['will', 'start', 'right', 'bat', 'pun',

So, I was stoked when I found out they were making it into an animated film.  Naturally, I pre-ordered my copy, so I got it via UPS today.  It was really cool of Amazon to ship it ""early"" so that it was on my doorstep on the day of its release.For starters, this is not the same as the graphic novel, but it's close.  Obviously, much of the ""text"" is missing, mostly the stuff dealing with Bruce's and other characters' interior dialogues.  They could have had the movie constantly narrated to include this text, but I hate constant narration, so I'm glad they didn't.  And, since it wasn't narrated, some of the interior dialog text has been changed into things the characters say, others are just expressed through actions.  Either way, it gets the point across without a constant narration.  Aside from that change, there are a few other minor changes.  Some parts are missing, mostly smaller parts, stuff that's not necessary to move the story along.  Some parts have even been moved to different parts of the story, I guess to change the flow slightly.  And there's a bit of added dialog that wasn't in the original comic.  Aside from those few minor changes, the story is mostly the same as the graphic novel.  People who are gung-ho about the movie makers sticking to the source material exactly will be disappointed by this, but I have no issues with it.  I thought the story came across well.Animation wise, this film is along the lines of the other animated DC shows and films, which is to say it's good.  The comic has more detail to it but, when you consider how many times something has to be drawn in a comic VS how many times it has to be drawn in an animated movie, it's easy to say why they did this.The voice acting was good.  I'm a big fan of Kevin Conroy as Batman, but Peter Weller did a great job.  So did everyone else.

So big in fact that this is a review of part 1 of this new DCAU film.'The Dark Knight Returns' was the comic that changed the comic book world forever with a story that was so brash and dark, the camp and classic good vs. evil was shattered. I always knew that there would be an animated film down the road and now it is finally here. I made sure to read the first two parts of the entire comic before I purchased this film and it was good to do so. The film adaption of this story is so beautiful with a few small subtile differences which are barely noticiable especially if you haven't read the origonal material in a while. The changes don't destroy the film at all because they stuck very close to it and really made it work. The voice cast was great. It took a while for me to warm up to Peter Weller voicing Batman, because I know that Kevin Conroy and even Bruce Greenwood would have been able to voice Batman in this film just as well. Still, he did a great job and the rest of the cast inclucing Ariel Winter, Gary Anthony Williams, Michael McKeon all contributed wonderfully. The action is just as intense in the film. The punches are earthshattering the faceoffs are hard hitting and intense and nothing is held back in the slightest. One thing I love about WBs DCAU is the fact that these are real fans putting together shows and movies with the comic fan in minds. Making sure it is something that makes the viewer happy, but also seeing how far they can push the bar in the world of animation as well as showing that animation can be for adults as well as kids.Of course, 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 1' will not be perfect until the second half is released, but I am definitely going to be one of the first in line to pick it up and complete the story. I am actually hoping that this will not be the last of the 'dream/big' projects in the DCAU film library. I would love Crisis on Infinate Earths', 'Blackest Night' and especially 'Kingdom Come'.

(Imagine Crisis On Infinite Earths being done like this...that would take up 4 to 6 parts in an adequate adaptation!)Anyway, I like the choice of Peter Weller, best known for the main character of ""RoboCop"", voicing Batman, which seems rather suitable for the grim and gritty world he has to face after his retirement and watching the world (and Gotham City) go to hell all around him. Batman just can't stop being Batman, and in times that are more brutal he has to be prepared and change with the times, not to mention handle the fact that he isn't the spry young man he once was. I like Carrie Kelley being Robin, which gives the Batman and Robin relationship more of a father and daughter relationship, given that her own parents are more interested in getting high than raising a child. The whole first part is basically Batman dealing with the leader of the Mutants and Harvey Dent released from Arkham with a whole new face, yet is unable to escape the monster he has become from years of being Two-Face.The animation and artwork is excellent, as a sort of mix between the original comic book style and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies.

1575321,A2ZFHK015YXP6U,B008RV5K4U,Wild1138,"[0, 0]","If you are a Batman comic book fan, there is a good chance you read Frank Millers ""The Dark Knight Returns"", as it was a groundbreaking story of it's time. Bruce Timm (the creator of Batman: The Animated series) drew great inspirtation from this graphic novel, so it seemed obvious that he would adapt this story at some point. And now we finally have Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1. So, being a huge fan of this story, did years of waiting for an adaptation pay off?Fortunately, the answer is yes! Although I liked it, my problem with the Batman: Year 1 film was the information being cramed into 1 film. But, making Dark Knight Returns 2 parts was a smart move. Every inch of the graphic novels first half is explored in this film, and I couldn't have asked for more.So, the story of Dark Knight Returns is identical to the comic. If you are NOT familiar with the comic, this is the synopsis: Batman retired after the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and 10 years later, Gotham is worse than ever. A new gang (called the Mutants) is almost in total control of Gotham, and the City is just as bad as it was in Bruce Waynes early years. After the dissaperance of a reabilitated Harvey Dent, the time has come, and Bruce Wayne must become Batman again, and take the mutants down, along with the aid of a new Robin. However, the reaperance of Batman will come at a price, as his return will awaken old enemies (who we will see in Part 2).THE POSITIVES:-The animation is solid. Although the style isn't quite the same as the comic, the character designs are still almost identical to the source material. I was pleased with most of the animation.-The action was fantastic. Every peice of action from the comic is put on film, and then expanded upon.-The voice actors all do a good job. No one here is bad at all. Peter Weller isn't spectacular, but is still a good Batman.-Alot of credit here should be given to Jay Olivia, the director. What can I say, he is extremely faithful to the source material, and his editing and directing are brilliant. They picked the perfect scene for the ending, which is a great cliffhanger that got me VERY excited for Part 2.-The pacing is great. It's easy to follow along, I never got bored, and I didn't want it to end when it did.THE NEGATIVES:-Like I said, Peter Weller is a good Batman, and everyone else does a good job. However, lets not forget that they are all newcomers, and there are some lines of dialogue that seem, ackward, and other scenes where it sounds like they are reading their lines for the first time. But, there is room for improvement, so im glad they didn't do Part 1 and 2 at the same time.-Although the animation is great for most of the film, the opening seems bland. If you havn't seen the other DC animated films, you won't notice. But, if you have, then you probably know that they do a great job with their detail, and how they take their time with some scenes. However, with this film, some scenes just seem really bland, namely the opening. The animation improved over the course of the film, but the begining just didn't seem, finished. It was still great overall, but not in line with some of their other films at times. But again, there is room to improve in Part 2.-The only character who seemed to lack development is the new Robin, Carrie Kelley (yes, Robin IS a girl in this story, but a completely different character). But, I won't complain that much simply becaude she has just as much development as the comic. That was my only complaint about the comic, though. If there is one thing that I felt they could have expanded from comic to film, it would be her backstory.My complaints with the film are really just nitpicks though, I just had to list my problems (as few as they were). Overall, the Dark Knight Returns Part 1 is how you make a good, faithful adaptation. The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I need to be fair and judge both parts as one film. I need to wait for Part 2 to see if they did make a solid, true adaptation overall.

As in the original source material, I can see why it's so acclaimed, though it's not to my personal taste.

1575331,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B008RV5K4U,Zack Davisson,"[87, 114]","For years, shows likeBatman: The Animated SeriesandBatman: The Brave and the Boldhave given us tantalizing glimpses at an animated adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreakingBatman: The Dark Knight Returns. If you had asked me what comic I most wanted to see adapted into The DC Animated Universe, it would have been without question ""The Dark Knight Returns."" Now finally, close to thirty years after its publication, I finally get my wish.And it is ... disappointing.""The Dark Knight Returns"" is one of the greatest American comics ever published. That isn't idle praise. Frank Miller tapped deep into the collective unconsciousness to deliver a myth that continues to be an influence to this day. It is an incredible work of art. And DC had to have known that they needed to treat the story with a little more reverie. I am actually confused at how it got such a poor treatment. There are so many problems with this release, from the main film to the bonus features.First off, and most obvious, is the decision to split the film into two parts. There is nothing behind that but money. DC knows they have a hot property on their hands, so they want to sell it to you twice. But, ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is still only a 4-issue comic, only slightly longer thanBatman: Year Onewhich was adapted to a single film. In order to justify the two-parter, they pad the story. Every scene of dialog is stretched just a little bit further. All of the conversations have just a few more lines thrown in, a few more long pauses. Not only is this awkward, but it completely throws off the pacing of the story. The scene with Commissioner Gordon and Bruce Wayne sharing a drink occupies half a page in the comic, but here it is stretched out into minutes of dialog. And not good dialog. Boring dialog.And the bizarre thing is, they cut out much of the actual great dialog already in the comic--or monologue in this case. All of Bruce Wayne's internal monologue, the very thing that drives the story, that gives depth and meaning to the dystopian landscape, that makes ""The Dark Knight Returns"" rise above, has been removed. All of his comments on his body, on the weight of age--gone. That famous scene where he does the back-kick? ""There are seven working defenses from this position. Three of them disarm with minimal contact. Three of them kill. One of them ... hurts."" Yeah, we still get that scene, but without the play-by-play. Just Batman kicking the guy behind him.I really don't understand how that decision could have been made. Was there a meeting? Did someone propose ""Hey! You know all of that great, famous monologue in ""The Dark Knight Returns? "" The stuff everyone quotes when they talk about the book? Why don't we just nix that and write a few more scenes of Wayne and Gordon having drinks?""Seriously ...And the voice acting. I had the same problem with ""Batman: Year One,"" which looked great but just didn't have strong voice actors. Peter Weller does Batman, and I think he pulls it off well. Everyone else though ... Ariel Winter doing Carrie Kelly just doesn't sound right. She sounds like a pampered rich kid, with no edge or spirit. And all of the other voices; I know Miller put in some dialog that is hard to pull off. The Mutant-speak isn't exactly normal English. But these actors sound like a bunch of frat guys doing a parody of ""gangster talk."" It sounds so forced and fake, like they don't believe a word they are saying. When a killer steps up behind you and says ""I need you mommie. Make me feel safe."" it should send a chill down my spine, not a chuckle.Art and animation-wise, things look decent. They didn't try to imitate Miller's style at all, but I am OK with that. I think they could have been more creative with the television cut-scenes, and more moody with their use of shadows, as well as making better use of some of the visual impact of the comic. Gone is the iconic scene of Batman holding the flag-covered corpse of the General. Gone is the scene towards the end of Harvey Dent's face ""matching."" But all in all, the animation is solid, and if this were just a regular Batman animated show I would give it full marks.Now the bonus features (and I am talking about the Blu-Ray here). This is another ""What were they thinking?"" moment for me. There is almost nothing here about ""The Dark Knight Returns."" The Carried Kelly feature is cool, talking about a female Robin. But where is the ""Frank Miller and Batman"" featurette? Where is the ""1986: The Year that Changed Comics"" short? Or something like that. Something to show the impact and gravity of the comic they are adapting. Instead there is an (admittedly interesting) piece on ""Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story."" What? Bob Kane? Umm, that's cool and all, but Bob Kane had nothing to do with this.I have the 25th Anniversary leather-bound edition of ""The Dark Knight Returns,""  and it is filled with newspaper articles and stories about the impact the comic had, the firestorm of press it created, how it directly lead to the creation of Tim Burton'sBatmanfilm. There is a wealth of material available. I am always amazed at how little effort DC spends on these bonus features to lead people back to the source comics. It's like they don't want to acknowledge Miller's contribution at all, or how this single comic revolutionized the industry. Maybe they are scared of leading people to the original ""Dark Knight Returns""  because then they will see what a poor adaptation this is.Instead we get ""The Bob Kane Story."" Which again, is admittedly cool. It's funny how all of these comics professionals try to tip-toe around the truth, and bite their tongues to keep from shouting out ""Bob Kane was a jerk!"" It's even funnier than not all of them succeed. And to hear Stan Lee call someone an egotistical, self-promoting gasbag without even a trace of irony is hilarious. But still, this is ""The Dark Knight Returns.""  I want to hear about Frank Miller.  I want to hear about THIS comic.And the two ""Batman: The Animated Series"" episodes included: They are about Two-Face. That's cool. But why not ""Legends of the Dark Knight""  from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" or ""The Battle of the Superheroes""  from ""Brave and the Bold"" that featured scenes from ""Dark Knight Returns?"" I don't get it. Even the cover of this DVD.  Why didn't they use the famous cover from the comic? Sigh ...Am I getting Part 2? Of course I am getting Part 2. Am I going to be disappointed? Yes.  That seems to be par for the course nowadays.",3,The Dark Knight Mediocre,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,6503,"['years', 'likeBatman', 'Animated', 'SeriesandBatman', 'Brave', 'Boldhave', 'given',
