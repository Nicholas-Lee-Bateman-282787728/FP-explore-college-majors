I bought his DVD's so I could work on dancing on the days when I'm not taking a class.  And most of these (not all) are already a review for me.  BUT I must say that some of his explainations for some of the steps involved are MUCH better than I've heard before.  He gives great instructions and shows more than once how to do the dance.  I love ethe picture in a picture in the lessons.  I only wish I could take some real lessons from him, I bet that would be a blast!Now as far as the music goes, some folks will be dissapointed that he doesn't actually use the music that one would normally use to dance the dances he teaches.  I'm going to make a wild guess and say that it would be very expensive for him to get a license for each of the dances and would make the cost of the DVD go way up.  I can live with the music he provides.  I do wish that he'd make a point of telling us on each dance what music is usually used for that dance, he did that a time or two, but I don't think with each dance.I would recommend his DVD's to anyone, I think that anyone could pop this DVD into their player and be dancing before more than an hour was up!  He'a a good teacher for sure.",5,Great way to brush up or learn to line dance,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,1315,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'line', 'dancing', 'couple', 'months', ""'m"", 'having', 'blast', 'take', '2', 'classes', 'week', ""'m"", 'going', 'pretty', 'good', 'pace', 'bought', 'DVD', 'so', 'could', 'work', 'dancing', 'days', 'when', ""'m"", 'not', 'taking', 'class', 'most', 'not', 'are', 'already', 'review', 'BUT', 'must', 'say', 'explainations', 'steps', 'involved', 'are', 'MUCH', 'better', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'great', 'instructions', 'more', 'once', 'how', 'do', 'dance', 'love', 'ethe', 'picture', 'picture', 'lessons', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'take', 'real', 'lessons', 'bet', 'would', 'be', 'blast', 'Now', 'as', 'far', 'music', 'folks', 'will', 'be', 'dissapointed', ""n't"", 'actually', 'use', 'music', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'use', 'dance', 'dances', ""'m"", 'going', 'make', 'wild', 'guess', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'expensive', 'get', 'license', 'dances', 'would', 'make', 'cost', 'DVD', 'go', 'way', 'up', 'can', 'live', 'music', 'do', 'wish', ""'d"", 'make', 'point', 'telling', 'dance', 'what', 'music', 'usually', 'used', 'dance', 'did', 'time', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'dance.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'think', 'anyone', 'could', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'be', 'dancing', 'more', 'hour', 'was', 'up', ""'"", 'good', 'teacher', 'sure']",Line Dance 101: A Quick Start Guide to Line Dancing

920203,A1WUCPUBJ6O2NZ,B000A3I3HE,Justin Blade,"[5, 5]","I just finished learning the entire DVD of dances and variations and I must say throughout Shawn is an excellent instructor giving back and side views of the moves and dances so you don't have to reverse what you're doing but can move naturally with him. Also, unlike what the most negative reviewer said - you certainly do get to dance every dance to at least a 2 minute piece of music, not including the ""prelude"" before (doing it without music) and build up he does throughout the entire teaching linking recently learnt moves to the building dance. There is also a Full Review section for doing all the dances and moves in a more aerobic style session and the practice for the last dance ""Slappin' Leather"" is included after that session rather than in the end of it's section (unlike the rest).

If they would have added a dance session for every kind of dance, I would have felt like I got my money's worth.
