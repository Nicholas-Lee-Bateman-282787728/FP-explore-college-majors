I wanted to see this film because Hiddles was the voice of a young Captain Hook, and he SINGS! Oh god I just faint whenever I hear his section of &#34;The Frigate That Flies&#34;!But the story isn't about the pirates of Neverland. It's about the fairies of Pixie Hollow. The gang: Tinkerbell, Vidia, Iridessa, Rosetta, Fawn and Silvermist, returns and this time they have to rescue some blue pixie dust from a renegade fairy named Zarina (who's voiced by Christina Hendricks of &#34;Mad Men&#34; fame). But Zarina's talent is mixing dust colors for different fairy talents and she's got a few tricks up her sleeves. Can Tink and the gang stop her? Can they redeem her? What's Captain Hook plan for the blue dust?This very film made me a fan of the Disney Fairies. After watching it, I went to Netflix to watch the other titles in the Disney Fairies mythos: &#34;Tinkerbell&#34;, &#34;Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure&#34;, &#34;Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue&#34; and  &#34;The Secret of the Wings&#34;. I even went to YouTube to watch all the shorts (I've already read the books). And I loved them all. I realized that I'm more of a Disney Fairy girl than a Disney Princess girl, especially after being disappointed by &#34;Brave&#34; and &#34;Frozen&#34;.

To be honest, I doubt that I would have actually perceived the way I conducted my childhood for so many years. Sure, there were signs here and there leading up to the undeniable realization of things being different, but only in hindsight was I able to see those. Life was pretty ""normal"" prior to that.After all, living within such a conservative all-American (predominately) small town Southern Baptist close nit community here Georgia, I never had reason to question the ""charmed"" life I was able to live.

""A man's man"" was he.Only later did I find out how literal that was.I had two dads.It wasn't until the impressionable age of sixteen that I made the harsh discovery while walking in on my 'mom' in the bathroom as she stood in front of the toilet wher dress hiked up. In what seemed like time stopped with the only sound heard was that of running faucet water as we blankly stared into one another's eyes. What could I say when 'mom' was not really 'mom' but a 'dad.'From there, I was left with few options, fight, flight or fold. I decided to fold. We never talked about that morning.

This movie is the fifth in the DisneyFairies collection and I'm most certain with such a overwhelmingly loved response from fans both young and old, it won't be the last.  This movie we found to be non-stop full of action and fun songs from those fancifully fun fairy friends.  The story obviously centers highly on pirates  and most of the adventure takes part on the high seas! I thought the imagery looked very good!**Spoiler Alert **My nearly six year old daughter really liked everything about the movie and has watched it many times. I will have to say it was quite a treat to learn all about dust keeper fairy Zarina and what choices made turned her to becoming a pirate fairy. And if you remember, pirates aren't really thought highly upon in the world of Tinkerbell. In fact, this spunky fairy gets tangled up with a pirate we will all come to learn it Captain Hook himself! Tinkerbell and her friends set off on a mission to set things right and oh what an adventure that was! The tick-tock-croc even makes an appearance! Speaking of which, there's a whole bonus feature about crocodiles that we found to be quite educational as it was fun! Even I learned a thing or two! Other bonuses included a few shorts, sing-a-long songs, and more!We would highly recommend checking The Fairy Pirate out! Any lover of Tinker Bell and the Disney Fairy movies are sure to be pleased.

Zarina steals the blue pixie dust, Tinker Bell and her friends get it back and Zarina then throws her potionlike dust she made at them and switches their talents which adds comedy to the whole thing.

1683776,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B00H5RYIBI,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[2, 3]","In his book about the Pixar challenges and triumphs, Creativity Inc., Ed Catmull describes how the role of the &#34;Brain Trust&#34; in making the best films possible -- and their record speaks for itself. As part of Disney, Pixar has inspired their &#34;Story Trust,&#34; which is actually mentioned on one of the bonus features.Clearly this system, while not infallible, works, because The Pirate Fairy has one of the tightest and fastest paced stories of not just the Disney Fairies series, but direct to video films in general. Of all the Fairies films, this one ranks alongside my favorite in the series, Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue.But you'll notice that &#34;Tinker Bell&#34; does not appear in the title. Perhaps it's because the Disney Fairies franchise has proven so strong, it alone can carry a film, with Tinker Bell as almost a supporting character.The star of this film is the title character, an inquisitive, ADD fairy named Zarina who, in a strangely Breaking Bad kind of plot, uses her talents as a chemist (or &#34;alchemist&#34;) to use the -- yes -- &#34;blue&#34; pixie dust to create a line of multi-purpose dusts. When her plans cause chaos and she is chastised, she turns to a life of piracy on the high seas.Christina Hendricks (Joan Holloway-Harris on Mad Men), turns in her third vocal performance for animation, preceded by Goro Miyazaki's From Up On Poppy Hill and as Lois Lane in All-Star Superman.

1683793,ARNJPFM578D6C,B00H5RYIBI,John,"[0, 0]","I&#8217;ve never really liked the original Disney Peter Pan animated movie.  Peter was mostly self-involved, the Lost Boys were ignorant thugs, and Tinker Bell was vain, vindictive, jealous, bi-polar, and perhaps slightly psychotic.  All the females in Neverland (including Indians, mermaids, fairies, and Wendy) were enthralled with Peter Pan but the best a girl could strive to be was his surrogate mother.  I felt sorry for Captain Hook by the end of it.The original animated Tinker Bell is probably best remembered as a beautiful example of character design and animated fluidity and expressiveness.  Her elevation to Disney mascot, however, seemed more like a corporate board room decision.  Then came the new Tinker Bell series in new(ish) computer animation.  They had to get it right out of the gate and almost forget the personality tics of first popular incarnation of Tinker Bell.  They did that and did it very well.I&#8217;ll give this newest movie four stars because it still maintains emotional resonance and effective story pacing&#8230; and because I find it hard to kick a project that&#8217;s so much better than most of the dreck out there, even if it&#8217;s starting to falter compared to the previous episodes in the series.  This one is dark, with the first attempts at actually killing a fairy by an antagonist (if you don&#8217;t count the hawk in the first movie&#8230; and, well, the cat and rats).  Tinker Bell is far from the focus&#8230; in fact she doesn&#8217;t have much to do except exposition for the audience.  It also seems like the animation is missing something.  The character animation looked a little &#8220;simpler&#8221;.  The biggest problem is the approach of the Peter Pan storyline.  This Tinker Bell would never fit that original movie treatment no matter how they wedge her in and if Peter Pan ever appears, even as a baby, that&#8217;ll be the end of our interest.",4,Good but they might have to right the boat.,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,1916,"['8217', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'original', 'Disney', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'animated', 'movie', 'Peter', 'was', 'mostly', 'self-involved', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'were', 'ignorant', 'thugs', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'was', 'vain', 'vindictive', 'jealous', 'bi-polar', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'psychotic', 'females', 'Neverland', 'including', 'Indians', 'mermaids', 'fairies', 'Wendy', 'were', 'enthralled', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'best', 'girl', 'could', 'strive', 'be', 'was', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'end', 'it.The', 'original', 'animated', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'beautiful', 'example', 'character', 'design', 'animated', 'fluidity', 'expressiveness', 'elevation', 'Disney', 'mascot', 'however', 'seemed', 'more', 'corporate', 'board', 'room', 'decision', 'Then', 'came', 'new', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'series', 'new', 'ish', 'computer', 'animation', 'had', 'get', 'right', 'gate', 'almost', 'forget', 'personality', 'tics', 'first', 'popular', 'incarnation', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'did', 'did', 'very', 'well.I', '8217', 'give', 'newest', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'still', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'effective', 'story', 'pacing', '8230', 'find', 'hard', 'kick', 'project', '8217', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'dreck', 'there', 'even', '8217', 'starting', 'falter', 'compared', 'previous', 'episodes', 'series', 'one', 'dark', 'first', 'attempts', 'actually', 'killing', 'fairy', 'antagonist', 'don', '8217', 'count', 'hawk', 'first', 'movie', '8230', 'well', 'cat', 'rats', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'far', 'focus', '8230', 'fact', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'exposition', 'audience', 'also', 'animation', 'missing', 'something', 'character', 'animation', 'looked', 'little', '8220', '8221', 'biggest', 'problem', 'approach', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'storyline', 'Tinker', 'Bell', 'would', 'never', 'fit', 'original', 'movie', 'treatment', 'matter', 'how', 'wedge', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'ever', 'even', 'baby', '8217', 'be', 'end', 'interest']",N/A

First, we have Zarina, voiced by Mad Men's Christina Hendrick's, a fairy who fancies herself something of a scientist, despite the admonishment of her superior in the fairy dust production center.  What if dust were a different color?  What might the possibilities be?  Scolded for her progressive thinking, she enlists Tinker Bell, herself a bit of a rogue, for help, & Zarina seems vindicated with the progress she's made until things go horribly wrong in Pixie Hollow.  She flees in shame.We see Zarina again, hair untamed, leggy & a bit more wise to the ways of the world, and now in league with a band of pirates.  She has returned to Pixie Hollow to steal the blue fairy dust to help the pirates in their plundering ways, as presumed leader of their group.  Yet things are not quite what they seem.Zarina puts the majority of Pixie Hollow to sleep, save for Tinker Bell & her friends, who go off in pursuit of her, until Zarina unveils her new skill set & switches their pixie powers.  Chaos ensues.  Zarina is eventually surprised to learn that the cabin boy on the ship, young James, is really the Captain, eventually, Captain Hook!  He betrays her & throws her into the sea.Fortunately, her pixie pals have not forgotten her & rescue her & the dust, foiling the pirates' plans & sending the Captain, fleeing from an infant crocodile, into a fateful meeting with one Mr. Smee.All in all, this really is the best of the series, and while I can see the appeal of casting a name like Tom Hiddleston in the role of the young Hook, I wonder why they didn't go with Corey Burton, who has been voicing Hook for years in other Disney productions & sounds very much like the man who originated the role in the 1953 film.

Tom Hiddleston (James Hook character) and Angelica Houston (Queen Clarion character) are also among the multiple actors/actresses that give their voices to this animated movie. This movie involves the character of Zarina eventually uses her pixie dust gifts to help out a group of pirate men after being forbidden from working with pixie dust. Zarina succeeds into putting many of the Pixie Hollow residents to sleep at the Four Seasons festival. She then carefully chooses this event to harness the magical blue pixie dust.

Except this time, there is no option to import the Blu-ray 3D version from the U.K. since it is still in theaters, assuming there will be a region-free U.K. Blu-ray 3D at all as there is for Frozen.If you want to watch it in 3D at home in the U.S., you have to pay thirty-five dollars on VUDU, which under the best of circumstances still isn&#8217;t going to be like watching it on Blu-ray.  I do like VUDU, but this is not a fair solution at this high price.So, will it be released later?  Is this a typical Disney double-dip money grab?  Only greedy Disney marketing execs know, but their recent bizarre decisions on U.S. Blu-ray 3D releases is annoying to say the least.  3D is here to stay and dominates the brick and mortar theater multiplexes, so this just seems like another way to get dedicated Disney fans to pay multiple times for the same film in an even shorter time period than has previously been the case with improved quality re-releases on DVD / Blu-ray / Blu-ray 3D over the past two decades.For those not enamored with 3D either at home or in the theater, I feel truly sorry for your inability to see what others can see, as this is about as close to the Star Trek Holodeck as the average consumer can get.  Maybe you're watching it on a cheap TV?  See it on a 4K passive 3D set in 1080p and you'll be hooked.  The format is truly phenomenal and doesn't cost much more for the studio to include the 3D disc in the package as has been done for years.  This just smacks of avarice, plain and simple.  Will I rebuy this in 3D if it finally gets re-released?  Yes, of course, but the marketing paradigm is still a disturbing new trend from the Disney corporate juggernaut.The Pirate Fairy film itself is probably a great product based on the previous films in this series, especially given that the Secret of the Wings in 3D was just wonderful, so no stars will be docked here for the content as we haven't been disappointed yet by any of the Disney Fairy films.  However, horrid treatment of the American consumer by Disney, as usual.
