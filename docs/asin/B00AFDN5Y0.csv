1609940,A25FAJE4T2C6LU,B00AFDN5Y0,Aaron J. Krohn,"[6, 9]","Shoot me!!What can I say?As many of you know, I'm an ageing white hetero male....who lives for SEX!!And the sex scenes in ""A Perfect Ending"" by Nicole Conn are HOT, baby, HOT!!I'm telling you, I think Barbara Niven (who plays Rebecca, a 50'ish straight wife and mother) had a REAL orgasm when she bedded down with high-priced call girl ""Paris"" (played by an exotic erotic Jessica Clark)that first time!!No, really!!After seeing (and HEARING!!!) it...well, there goes Meg Ryan's claim to fame!!  (Remember ""When Harry Met Sally""??  In the deli??)Ms Conn, who produced the ""longest kiss in cinema history"" in ""Elena Undone"", now can lay claim (I believe!) to THE most sustained erotic and pulse-pounding lesbian sex episode in a mainstream movie!!!Okay, now that I got THAT off my chest, let me tell you a bit about the REST of the movie!!(After my breathing returns to normal!!)One reviewer thinks this has too much ""heterosexual"" activity.I could sort of understand that, since Nicole Conn is known for her excellent ""lesbian movies"", such as ""Claire of the Moon"", ""Cynara:Poetry in Motion"", and ""Elena Undone"".One problem, however.Except for a couple of very brief scenes of call girl Paris ""doing her thing"" with some male clients, there AIN'T no heterosexual sex in this movie!!Not even Rebecca with her husband, played by John Heard!Okay, from the top!Rebecca, as noted, is married with (3) children. (One of them is my namesake, thank you!!)But her sex life ain't too great, as she tells her lesbian friends (Yes, straights CAN be friends with gays and lesbians, and not catch it!!) she's ""never ever"" had an orgasm, and has never known great passion.(BTW, one of her friends is played by ""Elena Undone"" vet, Mary Wells, who was ""Wave"" in ""Elena""! Another ""Elena"" vet in this movie is Gary Weeks (He was ""Barry"" in ""Elena""!), who plays a doctor here.)It's suggested she go to a WOMAN to try to heat up her sex life!!Ms Conn shows her comedic turn with the first few encounters between Rebecca and Paris (and another call girl).She freaks out when Paris starts to put the make on her!!It's pretty funny!!But eventually, things settle down a bit.That is, until they get between the sheets!! (See beginning of this review!)I won't go much further, because some things emerge that drastically alter what each imagined might happen.Ms Niven is so INSIDE her character, you really believe she's a ""novice"", as Morgan Fairchild, who plays ""Valentine"", the ""Madame"" who sent Paris to Rebecca, writes on the appointment memo!!And Jessica Clark reminded me somewhat of Necar Zadegan, who played ""Elena"".They each exude a ""foreign"" quality, with a European undercurrent of sensual eroticism, that completely mesmerizes Rebecca....as she did ME!!Sooooooo seductive!!About ""Paris"", she's also a struggling artist, who does ""pointillist"" paintings.  Pointillism was made famous by Georges Seurat during the Impressionist period in, you guessed it, PARIS (France)!!The ending (which came way too soon!!!) is unexpected, and.......! Sorry, this is where my review ends.  You'll have to see ""A Perfect Ending"" to find out for yourself if, indeed, ""A Perfect Ending"" HAD a perfect ending.When watching it, have a couple of tissues handy!!And DO watch it!!You won't be sorry!!",5,"Was ""Rebecca's"" orgasm REAL?",1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,3262,"['Shoot', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'many', 'know', ""'m"", 'ageing', 'white', 'hetero', 'male', '.who', 'SEX', 'sex', 'scenes', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Ending', 'Nicole', 'Conn', 'are', 'HOT', 'baby', 'HOT', ""'m"", 'telling', 'think', 'Barbara', 'Niven', 'who', 'Rebecca', ""50'ish"", 'straight', 'wife', 'mother', 'had', 'REAL', 'orgasm', 'when', 'bedded', 'down', 'high-priced', 'call', 'girl', 'Paris', 'played', 'exotic', 'erotic', 'Jessica', 'Clark', 'first', 'time', 'No', 'really', 'seeing', 'HEARING', 'well', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'claim', 'fame', 'Remember', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'deli', 'Ms', 'Conn', 'who', 'produced', 'longest', 'kiss', 'cinema', 'history', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'now', 'can', 'lay', 'claim', 'believe', 'most', 'sustained', 'erotic', 'pulse-pounding', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'episode', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'Okay', 'now', 'got', 'chest', 'let', 'tell', 'bit', 'REST', 'movie', 'breathing', 'returns', 'normal', 'One', 'reviewer', 'too', 'much', 'heterosexual', 'activity.I', 'could', 'sort', 'understand', 'Nicole', 'Conn', 'known', 'excellent', 'lesbian', 'movies', 'such', 'Claire', 'Moon', 'Cynara', 'Poetry', 'Motion', 'Elena', 'Undone', '.One', 'problem', 'however.Except', 'couple', 'very', 'brief', 'scenes', 'call', 'girl', 'Paris', 'doing', 'thing', 'male', 'clients', 'AI', ""N'T"", 'heterosexual', 'sex', 'movie', 'Not', 'even', 'Rebecca', 'husband', 'played', 'John', 'Heard', 'Okay', 'top', 'Rebecca', 'noted', 'married', '3', 'children', 'One', 'namesake', 'thank', 'sex', 'life', 'ai', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'Yes', 'straights', 'CAN', 'be', 'friends', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'not', 'catch', 'never', 'ever', 'had', 'orgasm', 'never', 'known', 'great', 'passion', 'BTW', 'one', 'friends', 'played', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'vet', 'Mary', 'Wells', 'who', 'was', 'Wave', 'Elena', 'Elena', 'vet', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Weeks', 'was', 'Barry', 'Elena', 'who', 'doctor', 'here', 'suggested', 'go', 'WOMAN', 'try', 'heat', 'up', 'sex', 'life', 'Ms', 'Conn', 'comedic', 'turn', 'first', 'few', 'encounters', 'Rebecca', 'Paris', 'call', 'girl', '.She', 'out', 'when', 'Paris', 'put', 'make', 'pretty', 'funny', 'eventually', 'things', 'settle', 'down', 'bit.That', 'get', 'sheets', 'See', 'beginning', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'further', 'things', 'emerge', 'drastically', 'alter', 'what', 'imagined', 'might', 'happen.Ms', 'Niven', 'so', 'INSIDE', 'character', 'really', 'believe', 'novice', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'who', 'Valentine', 'Madame', 'who', 'sent', 'Paris', 'Rebecca', 'appointment', 'memo', 'Jessica', 'Clark', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'Necar', 'Zadegan', 'who', 'played', 'Elena', 'exude', 'foreign', 'quality', 'European', 'undercurrent', 'sensual', 'eroticism', 'completely', 'Rebecca', 'did', 'ME', 'Sooooooo', 'seductive', 'Paris', 'also', 'struggling', 'artist', 'who', 'pointillist', 'paintings', 'Pointillism', 'was', 'made', 'famous', 'Georges', 'Seurat', 'Impressionist', 'period', 'guessed', 'PARIS', 'France', 'ending', 'came', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'unexpected', 'Sorry', 'where', 'review', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'Perfect', 'Ending', 'find', 'out', 'indeed', 'Perfect', 'Ending', 'HAD', 'perfect', 'ending.When', 'watching', 'have', 'couple', 'tissues', 'handy', 'DO', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry']",A Perfect Ending

By the time the end credits roll on Nicole Conn's latest idea for a lesbian story, you will have sat through an overdose of heterosexual sex, heterosexual relationships, and heterosexual lovemaking. It actually opens with a call girl, the mysterious Paris (Jessica Clark), helping a man get his S&M; freak on, followed by a scene where she's giving another john a hand job. The plot in a nutshell: a wealthy middle-aged married woman, Rebecca (Barbara Niven), has never experienced an orgasm or passionate feelings and she's determined to know what both feel like. Solution? Hire a high-end call girl for the moan and groan. However, even though they both make merry in the homosexual hay, it's important to note that neither the client nor the prostitute considers herself a lesbian. There are intermittent scenes of a doctor informing an unidentified patient about the advancement of terminal cancer and to prepare for the inevitable. [um, gee, who can it be?] The dialogue is bromidic and tedious, the acting sometimes stiff, and the plot all too predictable. But in the end you will have seen sufficient girl-on-girl action to make the 3 hours...I mean, 105 minutes...bearable. Finally, I dont know what world Nicole Conn lives in, but her lesbian vision would be much improved if she understood her lesbian audience and the nature of a homosexual human. There are millions of lesbians who have never had sex with men, nor think about having sex with men, and more who deserve to see a lesbian-theme movie without depictions of romance and sex between men and women thrown into it.(BTW: The photoshop of Niven (blonde) on this DVD cover is hilarious.

So, her lesbian friends who feel bad about her, wants her to contact Valentina (portrayed by Morgan Fairchild), who runs a high-priced escort service.  They recommend that a woman can help her achieve an orgasm and may be much better than what her husband can give her.

Mason is planning to give his wife a number of stocks in his will and everything to his three sons.  Rebecca's husband does not want to acknowledge Jessica as a daughter and include her in the will.  We learn that Mason had molested his step-daughter Jessica when she was younger and Rebecca feels that Mason owes their daughter something. But Mason refuses.Tired of the tension within her family, Rebecca decides that she's going to go through with the escort service and once again makes a call, and this time, she gets Sylvie (a woman her age) but once again, Rebecca is not ready and the two get into an argument and Sylvia tells Rebecca that she is uptight and that she should give Paris a try, as Paris can give her what she wants.And so, after backing out twice, Rebecca decides to give Paris a try.  And while it seems that Rebecca is about to back out of it again for a third time, she decides to go for it and she begins seeing Paris, who is able to give her an orgasm but also introducing her to sexual pleasure that she had never felt before.But it also instills confidence within Rebecca and wanting to give her daughter happiness.  As for Paris, we get to learn more about her backstory and why she has these memories of her and her boyfriend.And as Rebecca's sexual life with Paris is at its best and realizing she has a connection with her, Rebecca has a secret that her family and Paris are unaware of.  A secret that will change the lives of Rebecca and the people she is close with, forever.VIDEO & AUDIO:""A Perfect Ending"" is presented in 16:9 and 5.1 Surround Sound with closed captioning.  Picture quality is good as one can expect on DVD and with cinematographer Tal Lazar and filmmaker Nicole Conn also editing the film, she knew the shots that she wanted to get on screen.

Featuring a sexy, elegant love scene and captivating, visual pointillism that makes this film standout from other LGBT films out there!""A Perfect Ending"" is a film about one woman who has not felt sexual pleasure.  A family matriarch of having to take care of the interests of their four children and having a husband who cares about nothing but his business, but a family secret that she and her husband keeps, that torments her each and everyday.What happens when a wealthy housewife who has never felt true pleasure, meets a young woman who is able to give her just that.  With a newfound confidence and experiencing sexual passion that she has never felt before, all should seem right for the protagonist, Rebecca.  But unfortunately, she keeps a secret that will change the lives of those close to her, forever.Nicole Conn portrays the characters gently and uses pointillism, with extreme closeups until focused and giving a viewer a chance to see the true details of life that others probably do not see and eventually seeing a bigger picture.The film has also one of the longest sex scenes between two women that I have ever seen in a commercial film.  There is a gentleness in the way the scenes were shot, believable and romantic, it's definitely a memorable scene from the film, as we see how life changes for Nicole by her new discovery in life, but also knowing that she needs to make things happen with the life that she has.  But made interesting with the twists and turns that take place toward the end of the film.  It' s a wonderful journey for the primary characters of this film and the title ""A Perfect Ending"" fits with the film perfectly.I felt that casting is important and because we see Barbara Niven, an actress known for her work on soap operas taking on a role, that I never expected to see her in, she did a wonderful job, especially Jessica Clark. Both women were able to make their scenes seem believable but also sexy and elegant.  But Barbara Niven still looks incredible and Jessica Clark is an actress that I hope we see more of in the near future.  And Morgan Fairchild still looks incredible and also John Heard playing the jerk husband, it was great to see both talents in this film.The DVD features the extended love scene but also six behind-the-scene featurettes with interviews with Barbara Niven, Jessica Clark, Morgan Fairchild and filmmaker Nicole Conn and more.Overall, ""A Perfect Ending"" is a beautiful, romantic drama from filmmaker Nicole Conn that features a wonderful performance by Barbara Niven and Jessica Clark and one of the sexiest love scenes that I have ever seen in an LGBT film.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 2]","While a lot of lesbian films have contrived plots that are nothing more than excuses to showcase sapphic love, this claim cannot be made for this movie.  Barbara Niven plays a middle aged woman who is in a listless marriage.  With the efficacy of adding some fun to her life, 2 lesbian friends of her's talk her into hiring an escort girl.  It's supposed to be a middle aged escort girl, but a young vivacious woman (played by Jessica clark) shows up instead.Such is the story of a woman's search for love & finding it in the most unexpected places.  A young lady being intimate with a woman who is old enough to be her mother is quite unconventional......but it also offers some of the best girl/girl scenes I've ever seen!  THIS film is why I prefer softcore girl/girl movies to hardcore ones;  we get sensual passion, love and softness that's altogether lacking in most porn flicks.If you're looking for a lesbian movie that ALSO has a compelling storyline, then this DVD should be @ the top of your list.

What I expected to see was a passionate love story about an unhappy, sexually unfilled middle aged married straight woman who falls in love with a gorgeous call girl (what I imagined to be a lesbian version of Pretty Woman.) What I got instead was seeing a stepdad rape his daughter; not enough character development of the leads (especially Paris the call girl); some red herrings on the what was really going on with 'Rebecca', and a very sad and depressing ending (which is the exact opposite of ""A Perfect Ending"" imho.)  I wasn't expecting an unhappy ending, which is not 'A Perfect Ending' in my bookWhile I adored the (1) love scenes; (3) the incredibly gorgeous Jessica Clark who plays Paris the call girl; and (3) the divine Barbara Niven who plays Rebecca, the cliched script, direction, and over-loud soundtrack for this film couldn't overcome its assets.I am very happy I rented this film so I didn't have to buy a $20 DVD that I never would have watched after the 1st showing.

She's lovely and doesn't really look her actual age, but she's definitely older.  (Watch the trailer.)This is not a high quality flick. Let's face it, it's a Nicole Conn product (Claire of the Moon, Elena Undone)... I did find it kind of awful, but still her least cheesiest effort thus far-- even if she did sabotage the f@!!*!!g ending!!!  I watched the whole thing without turning it off, so I'll just call it a flawed but guilty pleasure. It also helped that I didn't actual buy it, lol.I actually liked the uptight, older woman storyline who seeks out a high-end call girl for her first orgasm. Though she requests a woman her own age, the smoldering, late 20s Paris (Jessica Clark) shows up at her door instead. The clear age difference was kinda sexy and sad at the same time. The aging housewife, though wealthy and well-preserved, still looks much older than Paris and feels insecure... her vulnerability is endearing (however badly acted). I did like the aging beauty who never before explored passion theme. I just don't understand how someone this conservative and uptight has close lesbian friends.  And I will say that Barbara Niven in her younger days was a stunning beauty (hotter than Jessica Clark even, as far as my tastes go)... but boy was the filming and lighting harsh on her in this film at times and I'm hoping that was for some alignment with the theme.  However, Niven is a beauty even today and I've seen her looking 10x more beautiful and younger in recent youtube clips.Sure it was kinda slow and full of implausibilities, the script and acting below average, a few too many hetero imageries and crazy long close ups on pointless objects, and the ending was awful and depressing (why did I rate this 3 stars?! lol)... but these leads were beautiful together and had some enticing chemistry. The hotel scenes were the best part of the movie. And I loved the whole blonde and dark, exotic beauty mix. Hot leads is one credit I gotta hand over to Conn.  But an ending like this drops us right back in time when lesbians aren't allowed to have a happy ending in love... and I kinda resent that. Really. What was the point of THAT?!And is Jessica Clark hot or what??  And is it not even hotter that she is openly gay in real life??

It isn't easy to look at yourself in the mirror, noticing all the wrinkles and changes that accompanies age, but to show the world takes a very brave, self-assured woman.  She has nothing to worry about, she is still beautiful, regardless of her age.  Jessica Clark is stunning.  I watched True Blood and had no idea she played Lilith.

Veteran filmmaker Nicole dropped everything to consider that situation and ""A Perfect Ending"" gave us the answer.  High-class call girl (played by the gorgeous Jessica Clark) is recruited to help a high-strung older society woman (sexy Barbara Niven) discover just what she's never known before she loses her chance.  This is another treasure from Ms Conn who brought us 1992's ""Claire of the Moon"" and 2010's ""Elena Undone,"" and we are eternally grateful that she shares these gems with us.  She truly loves to show the lesbian community its true light:  We share the same joys, and shoulder the same burdens, as our straight friends, and many more factors connect us than divide us.  As with all Soul Kiss films, you will get your money's worth in palpable heat on the screen but the secondary plot concerns family situations many of us have endured (myself included).  Yes, the story could have avoided the lesbian angle by having a male going to a female prostitute and the same basic truths would have been revealed, but we would have missed out on some really powerful performances by the leads and all the supporting players.  And if you want a real bonus, check out the featurettes.  Nicole always makes me feel like I'm taking a film appreciation class when I watch them.I would recommend this film to anyone who wonders if there's anything more out there for them, and certainly to my fellow tribe members for obvious reasons (I mean, the two leads AND Morgan Fairchild?

1610015,A35BXRP0S6J5RX,B00AFDN5Y0,Temis Clark,"[1, 1]","Personally... I feel this movie marks the beginning of an era in many aspects... I've watched hundreds of movies (both gay and straight), series, books - you name it... but never had the opportunity to put my hands into such a brilliant piece of work. Nicole Conn somehow manages to bring to life a deeply emotional, highly erotic film to life that somehow caresses your soul and evokes the most intimate emotions from your very core.In an time where being gay is either acclaimed or condemned but not necessarily accepted as if it was completely normal, Nicole finds a way to bring her characters on screen as thus what they are doing was the most natural thing in the world (not that I'm saying that it's not, at least not for many)... I've read some reviews where people state they feel this story didn't feel real etc.... to them I need to say in real life, I've seen things WAY crazier and I am not even 30, so the story seemed pretty natural to me. I believe this movie is great for anyone gay or straight, young or old who somehow feel stuck as if there is nothing more to life - opportunities show up when we least expect them to, and if we're not ready to be brave and jump out there and grab them when they show up, then it will be shame we are not living our life by the fullest.Chemistry between Barbara (Niven) and Jessica (Clark) is so amazing, you won't be able to help feeling mesmerised by their interactions and the energy they expel with every exchange. I've seen this movie 5 times since I got it 6 days ago, and simply can't get tired of it. Every time I see it I find something new. Nicole is so focused in detail that probably makes it impossible to get the whole picture of her work the first time around, so it is recommended you keep on seeing it LOL.Barbara is perhaps the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen on screen or real life, and she's simply magnificent in portraying the transition of her character throughout the movie where she not only shows how much of a professional and amazing actress she is, but also the fact that there still ARE great roles for women over 40. She will be often heard quoting on camera this was her role of a lifetime, and she might just be right -- not necessarily for her since I'm sure she will find other great roles to portray, but for the rest of us. There is a very thin line between what is erotic and what is pornographic, and somehow they found a way to make this film a piece of art.I've known Barbara for a while from her previous work but it was not until recently after watching this movie that I started following her on social media, and as was surprised to find a human being so compassionate, full of love and understanding that she almost hypnotises you with every word, and as she keeps saying on an on probably every time she has a keyboard available to write, a mic or a camera in front of her: ""Never settle for less than perfect and don't give up 5 minutes before the miracle!"" -- and I think this overall message is what A Perfect Ending was trying to project, and managed to.And yes, you've guessed right. If Barbara decides to reconsider and comes out of the closet, I will definitely ask her to marry me LOL.PLEASE note - If this review was helpful to you, and / or if you'd seen previous soul kiss films and love them, please make sure to visit their page and donate. There piece of work is like nothing I've ever seen before and it would be a shame they'd have to stop due to funding. I am just including this in my review, because I did not know about this and recently came to find out while surfing their site. If we all unite, we can make things possible for them, and ensure great films for us all...

Rosa ""celluloid526""","[1, 2]","Spoiler alert..as if there could be such a thing.***I have often wondered why the best stories, the ones with true grit seem to give up in the end. The Perfect Ending is not so much about a Fairy Tale perfect ending as it is that all is right with the world in the end. Formulaic to romantic drama...they never end up together...this is not a romantic comedy. So why is it a perfect ending? When you can leave this life the way you want to leave it, in the hands of those you love and advocate for... that is perfect. I just regret the sacrifice always being present. I wanted to see the perfect ending...Paris and Rebecca together. But that is not where the writers have taken us, so we must find perfection elsewhere.I loved the characters in this film even though they could have had more definition. Is it important to understand why Paris chooses a life of a call girl especially when she is as talented as she is? Guilt and derailed happiness brings her to that decision? Hmmm? Rebecca is unfulfilled and duty bound. You feel her angst and her frustration and her longing. Safely, I can say that I have seen just about every movie related to lesbians and their struggles. Elena Undone,for example, was great in that we had this passion that was captured quite nicely but I have never cried watching someone understand, for the first time, what it feels like to finally ""feel""...I did for Rebecca and again for Paris. Very moving.Did we need some of the sub themes attempted? Maybe not. We could have had the same issue with Rebecca's daughter not being her husband's child and addressed the conflicts without the whole rape thing. Not sure why it was important.  We already hate the husband because he is void of compassion for his wife. Could have redirected that to more definition of Paris and the choice.I have seen many movies that have stretched a thin story into 90+ minutes and this one had so much crammed together that we want to know more and are left sad never knowing. Paris is an interesting character...let's see the prequal... The Art of Paris.All in all I enjoyed this film.

The sex scenes were beautifully done and the dreamlike, abstract nature of Paris' demons were thought provoking.  One needs to watch it more than once to better understand the symbolism involved.  Jessica Clark has a surreal voice which captivated me to no end.  I've watched it several times, each time enjoying it more.  I saw a comment about it being too &#34;artsy&#34; which at first I agreed with, but then watching it again I appreciated it.  Maybe my being an &#34;older&#34; woman made me see it from a different perspective.  I now would entertain the thought of being involved with a much younger woman. Given that this is an independent film company, I took that into account in the positive with the 5 star rating.",5,Watch it!,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,867,"['was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'far', 'fetched', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'sensual', 'sexy', 'nature', 'Paris', 'was', 'what', 'gravitated', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'beautifully', 'done', 'dreamlike', 'abstract', 'nature', 'Paris', 'demons', 'were', 'thought', 'provoking', 'One', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'better', 'understand', 'symbolism', 'involved', 'Jessica', 'Clark', 'surreal', 'voice', 'captivated', 'end', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'time', 'enjoying', 'more', 'saw', 'comment', 'being', 'too', '34', 'artsy', '34', 'first', 'agreed', 'then', 'watching', 'again', 'appreciated', 'Maybe', 'being', '34', 'older', '34', 'woman', 'made', 'see', 'different', 'perspective', 'now', 'would', 'entertain', 'thought', 'being', 'involved', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'Given', 'independent', 'film', 'company', 'took', 'account', 'positive', '5', 'star', 'rating']",A Perfect Ending
