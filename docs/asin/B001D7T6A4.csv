1179516,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001D7T6A4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[8, 9]","Have you ever wondered about what goes through the minds of people who had only a few minutes left in their life before a tragedy?This question is explored through an uplifting and touching film which was the #1 rated Hallmark film in 2007.The film stars ""General Hospital"" Daytime Emmy award winner Genie Francis who plays the part of Peyton MacGruder, a newspaper columnist, who is on the verge of losing her job due to low readership.On that same day, a flight crashes in the ocean and while she sits alone on the rocks near the ocean, she finds burnt wreckage and floating along the wreckage and stuck between the rocks is a plastic bag with a note.From that moment on, Peyton knows that she needs to write a story to keep her job, improve her readership and what best than to write an ongoing column about finding out who the writer was and find the person who the letter was written for.But during the process of writing the column, the note seems to have a positive affect for the people affected by the death of a love one on that flight but also through the journey of writing these columns and meeting these people, it opens up old wounds for Peyton and for her to confront emotions she has harbored inside her broken heart.Also starring in the film is actor Ted McGinley (""Hope & Faith"") who plays a fellow award winning sportswriter who helps Peyton by giving her advice, encouragement but most of all, his loving heart.VIDEO:The film is featured in 1:75:1 anamorphic widescreen.  A lot of the scenes are shot indoors but for a Holiday film, a good touch of winter and everything looks pretty good.AUDIO:Audio is presented in English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The majority of the film is dialogue-based.  Audio is clearly heard.  No major use of surround sound or audio direction to certain channels in this type of film but nor is it really needed.SPECIAL FEATURES:The DVD features two special features:* ""Notes from the Novelist: A Conversation with Angela Hunt""* ""Playing Peyton with Genie Francis""I found the interview with Angela Hunt to be quite informative.  As a Christian woman, it was great to hear in her perspective of why the story was written and what she did to make sure her ideals and beliefs were featured in the storyline.  And the message the storyline brings.The second featurette featuring actress Genie Francis talking about playing the part of Peyton MacGruder but the biggest part of all is Genie talking about one of the most controversial situations that involved her back in the 80's as one of the major stars (especially her storyline) during the ""Luke and Laura"" years of ""General Hospital"" and explaining how she left it all because of what a co-worker told her.  And while leaving the soap opera during her storyline's peak and by making an impulse decision to leave at the age of 19 because of anger, she hurt many people in the process.She goes on to explain about the note and it's message of forgiveness.  And that for her playing the part, just having to go through the pain back then as an actress but then finding enlightenment through playing the part of Peyton MacGruder.I'm sure it was not easy for her too talk about it and the fact that she fully discusses it openly was a surprise but how it ties into her role and her appreciation for the film and also working with Ted McGinley was worth watching.  A very cool special feature!""The Note"" is such as uplifting and touching film.  I was very touched by the storyline and especially watching both Genie Francis and Ted McGinley in the film.Before watching the film, the first thing that went in my head was Genie Francis...Laura of ""General Hospital"" and Ted McGinley from ""Happy Days"" and ""Married With Children"" and other comedic roles.But growing up and watching Genie Francis, it's so great to see her acting again and playing an authoritative but yet an emotional role.  She did a great job with this role and I hope to see more of her in the future.  As for Ted McGinley, it was great to see him in a serious role and both had awesome chemistry together onscreen.And again, going back to the film, sure one can expect a tearjerker from a Hallmark film.  But I was very much impressed by the message of the film and the overall touching storyline.We hear so much about tragedy, especially with yearly news of those affected by 9/11.  Also, perhaps in our own personal lives, we may know of someone affected by tragedy or perhaps tragedy has hit closer to hom and even hit us hard.  There is a lot of questions that can run through someone's head and in this case, if one had a few minutes left of life, knowing that they may die, if you had a message to write, who would you write it to and what would you write?In this film, the message is clear and simple but without spoiling it for you, I think anyone watching this film can truly appreciate the endearing message once revealed in the end.The timing of this DVD is not only great for the holidays but for someone experiencing some sort of pain within their lives, the positive message in this film is quite touching.All in all, a film that truly touches the soul!  Definitely worth watching!",4,"A message that comes clear to the viewer that in life and sometimes through tragedy, there is always hope!",1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,5152,"['Have', 'ever',

At the same time an airplane goes down and Payton happens upon a note in a Ziploc bag.  Her column takes off as she writes about her search for the person that the note had been written to.  All she knows is the note was written to someone called ""T"".The real story from the movie and the column is the persons involved, surviving family that may be the person written to when the writer on the doomed airplane made his hasty written statement.

Another writer, played by Ted McGinley, decides to assist Payton, but has some of his own reasons to get close and personal.  And there is more than romance that he discovers in the columnist Payton.  She has her own history, baggage, struggles, that perhaps the note was a miracle for her.A good twist of a couple or three different plots which end in enough surprise to grant this Christmas related movie 5 stars.  Don't let the Christmas time of the plane accident and the aftermath deter you from watching this movie in July or September or any month.  It's not really a Christmas movie, it just happened to take place in December.  Recommended viewing.Taken from the book by Angela Hunt. Subtitles are available.  There is also a nice special feature with a conversation with the book's author.

It was done at Christmas time and God's Christmas miracle through a note left behind.  It touched every life that heard the message left in the note and changed hearts and brought healing.  I personally asked God for some miracles of my own from seeing this movie in 2008 at Christmas time on 12-7-10.  I asked him for six miracles for family and friends in hurting places that needed God's attention and work.  He gave me all six miracles by that Christmas 12-25-10 what a blessing to hear all the wonderful news in answer to my prayers.  I may even write a book about what God is doing in answer to those prayers even today.  Buy all means buy it for family and friends for Christmas or birthday or anytime.

1179526,A37DGB3816NA18,B001D7T6A4,John L. Williams,"[6, 15]","""the Note"" is a wonderful idea that is well transformed to the small screen as a potentially moving inspiring Christmas story. What could have been a heavy handed weepie that clobbers you with it's uplifting message of renewal and dealing with tragedy is instead well executed by a gifted director & well written translation. Unfortunately, it nearly comes undone with a major miscasting of Genie Francis in the lead role. Not a moment of truth comes through her overwrought, dreadful performance. She brings everything that may work with Soap Opera acting to a telefilm without taking into regard the difference in the writing and performance technique needed. As a result she is woefully out of play with the other actors who have adopted a more naturalistic acting technique. By the end of it, I felt rather cheated out of a good film. It reminded me of why A CHRISTMAS WISH with Debbie Reynolds & Neil Patrick Harris works so well and this one didn't. In A Christmas Wish each actor was in tune to a sensitve script, light direction and dealing with sentiment without falling into sentimentality. Much of ""the Note"" follows the same technique except for the performance of Ms. Francis. It is an illustration of how one performance can damage a film & almost destroy it, even when every other element works well. I loved to give the film 5 stars and her 1 star. If she were only a supporting character, her damage would not be so severe. But as the lead, she is almost the iceberg that sinks the majestic ship.

I know that is in direct contrast to what so many have said, but it was my honest reaction. I do not watch soap operas or today's sitcoms, so I have no history with either of the lead characters--I just based my feelings on what I saw in this movie and I had a hard time believing they would end up together.Another comment, about the ""edited movie"" review. That is what actually convinced me to buy this. I had heard that when first aired on TV the movie was clean, but contained multiple uses of the Lord's name as an exclamation, so I had avoided it.
