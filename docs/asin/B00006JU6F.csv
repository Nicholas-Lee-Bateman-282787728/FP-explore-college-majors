The problem is that you have some of Sullivan's most delicious music wedded with one of Gilbert's weakest and most dated libretti. To be honest, I was not looking forward to watching this production.  In the main, the Brent Walker series can be pretty painful for the dedicated Savoyard; and I figured the ""Ida"" would be a total disaster.Imagine my surprise!  A wonderful cast makes this entry one of the most charming in the series and is certainly as good an ""Ida"" as we're ever likely to get on video. Ida's opening solo, ""Minerva! Oh hear me!"" is one of those pieces I usually sleep through, but Nan Christie in the title role makes the music come alive. The rest of the performers are uniformly wonderful both in voice and delivery.  Even American import Frank Gorshin refrains from hamming it up as King Gama and delivers a performance worthy of Martyn Green.All in all this DVD is a real treasure - a little known work beautifully preserved for repeated viewings!",5,"A charming, lovely &quot;Princess Ida&quot;",1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,1053,"['quot', 'Princess', 'Ida', 'quot', 'certainly', 'one', 'least', 'known', 'Savoy', 'Operas', 'problem', 'have', 'Sullivan', 'most', 'delicious', 'music', 'wedded', 'one', 'Gilbert', 'weakest', 'most', 'dated', 'libretti', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'production', 'main', 'Brent', 'Walker', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'painful', 'dedicated', 'Savoyard', 'figured', 'Ida', 'would', 'be', 'total', 'disaster.Imagine', 'surprise', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'entry', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'series', 'certainly', 'as', 'good', 'Ida', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'get', 'video', 'Ida', 'opening', 'solo', 'Minerva', 'Oh', 'hear', 'one', 'pieces', 'usually', 'sleep', 'Nan', 'Christie', 'title', 'role', 'music', 'come', 'alive', 'rest', 'performers', 'are', 'uniformly', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'delivery', 'Even', 'American', 'import', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'hamming', 'up', 'King', 'Gama', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Martyn', 'Green.All', 'DVD', 'real', 'treasure', 'little', 'known', 'work', 'beautifully', 'preserved', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

Princess Ida certainly is as strong a work as the more frequently performed ones. Several friends and I watched this together, and we all enjoyed it. Frank Gorshin performs very well as the crusty old King/father of Princess Ida. The choreography was especially good in not only moving the story forward but assisting with characterization. The costumes and sets contribute to that fairy tale quality of this story. A real bonus is that all the words to the songs are printed in the booklet that arrives with the DVD so if you miss a bit of dialogue you can look it up. All of the performers sing and act well. Princess Ida is great fun! I've watched it twice now, and I know it will be one that I'll be looking forward to probably at least once each year.",4,Great Fun,1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,863,"['Prior', 'purchase', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'G', 'H', 'more', 'popular', 'works', 'Mikado', 'Pirates', 'Penzance', 'Princess', 'Ida', 'certainly', 'strong', 'work', 'more', 'frequently', 'performed', 'ones', 'Several', 'friends', 'watched', 'together', 'enjoyed', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'very', 'well', 'crusty', 'old', 'King/father', 'Princess', 'Ida', 'choreography', 'was', 'especially', 'good', 'not', 'only', 'moving', 'story', 'forward', 'assisting', 'characterization', 'costumes', 'sets', 'contribute', 'fairy', 'tale', 'quality', 'story', 'real', 'bonus', 'words', 'songs', 'are', 'printed', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'so', 'miss', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'can', 'look', 'up', 'performers', 'sing', 'act', 'well', 'Princess', 'Ida', 'great', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'now', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'probably', 'least', 'once', 'year']",N/A

Delightfully cast, excellently costumed, tiny abridgements in the dialogue done with taste. I found the bow to Tennyson -- framing it as an amateur production done in a high-class English country house in 1890 -- was enhancement rather than distraction.

718893,A1COIS9GP4WDIB,B00006JU6F,Sheryl Zettner,"[0, 2]","This musical has so much potential for being hilarious, but the lady who plays Princess Ida in this version was so intent on proving she could wallow in the high notes that she doesn't bother to enunciate anything she is singing. In short, she's pretty much impossible to understand when she is singing.This is kind of a pet peeve of mine with modern G&S; sopranos. They don't seem to give a shit about the brilliance behind W.S. Gilbert's lyrics, as long as they can show off their high pitched vibrato.I saw one comment before posting here that was implying that Gilbert was poking fun at feminism, but I don't really think that is true. What he was poking fun at was what happens when you take any philosophy to its unnatural conclusion. And songs like ""A Lady Fair of Lineage High"" hardly imply a sexist bias.Just the other day I was reading one of his earlier pieces called ""No Cards,"" where an older feminist type woman totally outwits the men who think they are more clever than her, and it was quite clear who the heroine was in that story. So I really don't see Gilbert as a sexist in any shape or form. On the contrary, I think he was just playing around with some of the intellectual themes of the day--one of which was the position of women in society.However, I think the way this production was performed makes it almost look like it was poking fun at the women characters, and I think part of that was just casting such a weak lead for Princess Ida.Another mistake in this production was superimposing the backdrop audience of men and women. Maybe the director thought that would be clever, but it made the scenes noisy.Also, the hyper-choralization of the group singing made it difficult to follow the lyrics. Five women singing something simultaneously is perhaps comprehensible, but when you have 20-30 singing something, following the lyrics is next to impossible. If I were casting this, I would have cropped the number of people on stage at any one time to 10 or less.In short, I hope someone else re-produces this in video format, but finds some modern equivalent to Julie Andrews to play the lead, so people can actually understand the words.",2,Lead Female Singer Ruins This,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,2165,"['musical', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'being', 'hilarious', 'lady', 'who', 'Princess', 'Ida', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'intent', 'proving', 'could', 'wallow', 'high', 'notes', ""n't"", 'bother', 'enunciate', 'anything', 'singing', 'short', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'understand', 'when', 'singing.This', 'kind', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'modern', 'G', 'S', 'sopranos', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'give', 'shit', 'brilliance', 'W.S', 'Gilbert', 'lyrics', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'show', 'off', 'high', 'pitched', 'vibrato.I', 'saw', 'one', 'comment', 'posting', 'here', 'was', 'implying', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'poking', 'fun', 'feminism', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'true', 'What', 'was', 'poking', 'fun', 'was', 'what', 'when', 'take', 'philosophy', 'unnatural', 'conclusion', 'songs', 'A', 'Lady', 'Fair', 'Lineage', 'High', 'hardly', 'imply', 'sexist', 'other', 'day', 'was', 'reading', 'one', 'earlier', 'pieces', 'called', 'No', 'Cards', 'where', 'older', 'feminist', 'type', 'woman', 'totally', 'men', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'more', 'clever', 'was', 'quite', 'clear', 'who', 'heroine', 'was', 'story', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Gilbert', 'sexist', 'shape', 'form', 'contrary', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'around', 'intellectual', 'themes', 'day', 'one', 'was', 'position', 'women', 'society.However', 'think', 'way', 'production', 'was', 'performed', 'almost', 'look', 'was', 'poking', 'fun', 'women', 'characters', 'think', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'casting', 'such', 'weak', 'lead', 'Princess', 'Ida.Another', 'mistake', 'production', 'was', 'superimposing', 'backdrop', 'audience', 'men', 'women', 'Maybe', 'director', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'clever', 'made', 'scenes', 'noisy.Also', 'hyper-choralization', 'group', 'singing', 'made', 'difficult', 'follow', 'lyrics', 'Five', 'women', 'singing', 'something', 'simultaneously', 'perhaps', 'comprehensible', 'when', 'have', '20-30', 'singing', 'something', 'following', 'lyrics', 'next', 'impossible', 'were', 'casting', 'would', 'have', 'cropped', 'number', 'people', 'stage', 'one', 'time', '10', 'less.In', 'short', 'hope', 'someone', 'else', 'video', 'format', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'play', 'lead', 'people', 'can', 'actually', 'understand', 'words']",N/A
