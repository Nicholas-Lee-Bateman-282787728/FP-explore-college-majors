1161783,A1NR6THMWS2JZO,B00197YZ8G,Volunteer of America,"[7, 8]","Have always regrded the British Royals as having outstayed their welcome a bit - especially the younger generation - but I must say that this concert,  celebrating the Queen's 50th year of Queendom, is really quite moving and positive. Most of the Brit (and some US favorites) pop establishment appears - Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey look fabulous! - but for some not-very-mysterious reason the Stones are absent, not sure why David Bowie isn't there. But there's Rod, and Eric, and Paul, and of course Elton, and it's a pleasure to see them all lined up through the course of a very long day.My favorite moment is Rod launching into All You Need Is Love, and then Eric and Paul dedicating While My Guitar to George. The Royals come out and chat with all the performers like old friends, and the crowd is waving little Union Jacks for a change instead of being soccer hooligans. Lots of younger stars too, not my generation, but the whole DVD is a happy occasion and well worth watching.",5,It was a nice Party,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,987,"['Have', 'always', 'regrded', 'British', 'Royals', 'having', 'outstayed', 'welcome', 'bit', 'especially', 'younger', 'generation', 'must', 'say', 'concert', 'celebrating', 'Queen', '50th', 'year', 'Queendom', 'really', 'quite', 'moving', 'positive', 'Most', 'Brit', 'US', 'favorites', 'pop', 'establishment', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Shirley', 'Bassey', 'look', 'fabulous', 'not-very-mysterious', 'reason', 'Stones', 'are', 'absent', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'David', 'Bowie', ""n't"", 'there', 'Rod', 'Eric', 'Paul', 'course', 'Elton', 'pleasure', 'see', 'lined', 'up', 'course', 'very', 'long', 'day.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'Rod', 'launching', 'All', 'Need', 'Love', 'then', 'Eric', 'Paul', 'dedicating', 'My', 'Guitar', 'George', 'Royals', 'come', 'out', 'chat', 'performers', 'old', 'friends', 'crowd', 'waving', 'little', 'Union', 'Jacks', 'change', 'instead', 'being', 'soccer', 'hooligans', 'Lots', 'younger', 'stars', 'too', 'not', 'generation', 'whole', 'DVD', 'happy', 'occasion', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']","Party at the Palace: Queen's Golden Jubilee / Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Queen, Rod Stewart, Annie Lennox, Tom Jones, Opus Arte"
