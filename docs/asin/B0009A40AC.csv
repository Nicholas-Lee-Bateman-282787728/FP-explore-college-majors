902899,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009A40AC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","You would be hard pressed to find a horror film more ineptly made than this one.  The Slaughterhouse Massacre is embarrassingly wretched from start to finish, spilling even more clich&eacute;s than blood.  The stupidity of the whole thing is actually a little hard to believe; you would think even the most amateurish of filmmakers would do one thing right, just by accident, but not these guys.  If there's a human being walking around on this earth that could actually take any enjoyment from this movie, I sincerely hope I never meet him.The movie starts out with a hot and bothered young blonde begging her boyfriend to take her to the slaughterhouse because nothing turns her on more than the blood and stench of poor slaughtered animals.  You can guess what happens.  Then, things get confusing because another murder is mentioned, one which led a group of guys to come and murder the suspect, Marty Sickle.  The killer's body was never found, though, so the legend is that you can bring Sickle back to life if you go to the slaughterhouse and recite a silly little poem.  Enter our main characters: Justin, the incredibly stupid football jock and Stacey, the reasonably hot chick that loves him (despite the fact he isn't exactly faithful to her), Justin's even dumber sidekick Bobby and his girlfriend Tina (who actually thinks going to the slaughterhouse and trying to raise a dead killer back to life sounds like fun).  Potential viewers, prepare for your mind to be rotted by egregious overacting in a college classroom, the lamest college party in history, characters so one-dimensional and annoying you would actually consider killing them yourself, incredibly bad special effects, and a killer lacking any presence whatsoever.All of the available evidence suggests that no thought whatsoever went into the making of this movie.  Seriously, the sickle-wielding killer is named Marty Sickle, and there's a pothead character named Stoner.  Then there's the fact that this slaughterhouse, which has been abandoned for ten long years, still has electricity.  Oh, and did you know that animal blood doesn't dry up at all if you keep it in an open bucket for ten years?  Or that you should make as much noise as possible when trying to hide from a deranged killer?  Or that an unconscious person with a bum leg can still walk as long as someone holds on to her?Believe me - I haven't even begun to plumb the inept stupidity of this movie.  This cinematic atrocity currently sports a 13 percent approval rating on a certain tomato-related site, and I'm seriously considering opening an investigation into how the rating on there can be even that high.  The Slaughterhouse Massacre is an utter travesty of a horror movie.",1,I would rather be a cow in a slaughterhouse than to have to watch this tripe again,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,2726,"['would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'ineptly', 'made', 'one', 'Slaughterhouse', 'Massacre', 'embarrassingly', 'wretched', 'start', 'finish', 'spilling', 'even', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'blood', 'stupidity', 'whole', 'thing', 'actually', 'little', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'think', 'even', 'most', 'amateurish', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'right', 'just', 'accident', 'not', 'guys', 'human', 'being', 'walking', 'around', 'earth', 'could', 'actually', 'take', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'never', 'meet', 'him.The', 'movie', 'out', 'hot', 'bothered', 'young', 'blonde', 'begging', 'boyfriend', 'take', 'slaughterhouse', 'nothing', 'more', 'blood', 'stench', 'poor', 'slaughtered', 'animals', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'confusing', 'murder', 'mentioned', 'one', 'led', 'group', 'guys', 'come', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Marty', 'Sickle', 'killer', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'though', 'legend', 'can', 'bring', 'Sickle', 'back', 'life', 'go', 'slaughterhouse', 'recite', 'silly', 'little', 'poem', 'Enter', 'main', 'characters', 'Justin', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'football', 'jock', 'Stacey', 'reasonably', 'hot', 'chick', 'fact', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'faithful', 'Justin', 'even', 'dumber', 'sidekick', 'Bobby', 'girlfriend', 'Tina', 'who', 'actually', 'going', 'slaughterhouse', 'trying', 'raise', 'dead', 'killer', 'back', 'life', 'sounds', 'fun', 'Potential', 'viewers', 'prepare', 'mind', 'be', 'rotted', 'egregious', 'overacting', 'college', 'classroom', 'lamest', 'college', 'party', 'history', 'characters', 'one-dimensional', 'annoying', 'would', 'actually', 'consider', 'killing', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'killer', 'lacking', 'presence', 'whatsoever.All', 'available', 'evidence', 'thought', 'whatsoever', 'went', 'making', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'sickle-wielding', 'killer', 'named', 'Marty', 'Sickle', 'pothead', 'character', 'named', 'Stoner', 'Then', 'fact', 'slaughterhouse', 'been', 'abandoned', 'ten', 'long', 'years', 'still', 'electricity', 'Oh', 'did', 'know', 'animal', 'blood', ""n't"", 'dry', 'up', 'keep', 'open', 'bucket', 'ten', 'years', 'should', 'make', 'much', 'noise', 'possible', 'when', 'trying', 'hide', 'deranged', 'killer', 'unconscious', 'person', 'bum', 'leg', 'can', 'still', 'walk', 'as', 'long', 'someone', 'Believe', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'begun', 'plumb', 'inept', 'stupidity', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'atrocity', 'currently', 'sports', '13', 'percent', 'approval', 'rating', 'certain', 'tomato-related', 'site', ""'m"", 'seriously', 'considering', 'opening', 'investigation', 'how', 'rating', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'high', 'Slaughterhouse', 'Massacre', 'utter', 'travesty', 'horror', 'movie']",Slaughter House Massacre
902900,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0009A40AC,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE MASSACREHave you ever seen the cover of a movie and been sold on it just by looking, have you ever actually read the quotes on said cover and actually believed what they said? Have you ever done all of these things and then been completely let down, well if you have chances are you watched this movie. The look of this movie and what it said on the case had made me a believer at the time, wish I could take that feeling back.This flick is your typical Slasher film but without all of the fun stuff, well they tried but it just doesn't work. The film follows a group of high school teens [of course] in Texas [hate the stereotypes] who are out partying one night and decide to take a trip to the local slaughterhouse where they say the ghost of a killer lives. Aside from all the typical things here it sounds like it can be a fun throwback to the 80's right? I thought so to but it quickly becomes your average low budget killer flick, well average would be entertaining.The movie falls into the ""oh it is comical"" area but then you realize even as bad as it seems it isn't even bad funny. The acting here is just straight up wooden and there is no getting around it, at times one or two of these kids seem like they are entertaining but that can't even save it. I mean there is literally the typical stoner guy and his name is stoner, really. The killer here has the right kinda twisted/hick look that could make him scary but his obvious mistakes take away from it. Seriously he literally throws windmill like strikes when he is swinging on these kids so it is easy for the actors to duck it. He also is very slow when throwing these and is off like crazy, at least in other flicks the kill attempts look like the killer is trying. Also while there was some promise at first with the gore I was waiting for a massacre that never came.Now of course it is possible that I am being a bit to harsh because I was tricked into expectations, and there are a few good things going on here. For one is the first ten minutes or so of this flick, any body wanting some naked females will love the opening here. You not only get all kinds of tops off but full frontal as well, and even a good sex scene, also some girl on girl. Sure it isn't enough to save the movie but at least it is something, also regardless of the horrible stereotypes it is set in Texas. Any time a movie is set in Texas or Maryland I am a fan of that at least.There is a quote on the front cover that says ""more frightening than the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", I don't know which one of the many they meant but all of those films are way better than this. I hate writing reviews like this because I know a lot of work went into making these movies and who knows this may have been the best they could do at the time. If that is the case then I commend all involved in making this film happening and going further than all of these [internet critics] have. It is with that said that I will check out some other stuff by writer/director/star Paul Gagn&eacute;, maybe as his career has progressed so has he, ""Blood Predator"" here I come.",2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MASSACRE,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,3117,"['SLAUGHTERHOUSE', 'MASSACREHave', 'ever', 'seen', 'cover', 'movie', 'been', 'sold', 'just', 'looking', 'have', 'ever', 'actually', 'read', 'quotes', 'said', 'cover', 'actually', 'believed', 'what', 'said', 'Have', 'ever', 'done', 'things', 'then', 'been', 'completely', 'let', 'down', 'well', 'have', 'chances', 'are', 'watched', 'movie', 'look', 'movie', 'what', 'said', 'case', 'had', 'made', 'believer', 'time', 'wish', 'could', 'take', 'feeling', 'back.This', 'flick', 'typical', 'Slasher', 'film', 'fun', 'stuff', 'well', 'tried', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'teens', '[', 'course', ']', 'Texas', '[', 'hate', 'stereotypes', 'who', 'are', 'out', 'partying', 'one', 'night', 'decide', 'take', 'trip', 'local', 'slaughterhouse', 'where', 'say', 'ghost', 'killer', 'typical', 'things', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'throwback', '80', 'right', 'thought', 'so', 'quickly', 'average', 'low', 'budget', 'killer', 'flick', 'well', 'average', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining.The', 'movie', 'oh', 'comical', 'area', 'then', 'realize', 'even', 'as', 'bad', ""n't"", 'even', 'bad', 'funny', 'acting', 'here', 'just', 'straight', 'up', 'wooden', 'getting', 'times', 'one', 'two', 'kids', 'seem', 'are', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'save', 'mean', 'literally', 'typical', 'stoner', 'guy', 'name', 'stoner', 'really', 'killer', 'here', 'right', 'kinda', 'twisted/hick', 'look', 'could', 'make', 'scary', 'obvious', 'mistakes', 'take', 'away', 'Seriously', 'literally', 'windmill', 'strikes', 'when', 'swinging', 'kids', 'easy', 'actors', 'duck', 'also', 'very', 'slow', 'when', 'throwing', 'crazy', 'least', 'other', 'flicks', 'kill', 'look', 'killer', 'trying', 'Also', 'was', 'promise', 'first', 'gore', 'was', 'waiting', 'massacre', 'never', 'came.Now', 'course', 'possible', 'am', 'being', 'bit', 'harsh', 'was', 'tricked', 'expectations', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'here', 'one', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'flick', 'body', 'wanting', 'naked', 'females', 'will', 'love', 'opening', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'kinds', 'tops', 'full', 'frontal', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'good', 'sex', 'scene', 'also', 'girl', 'girl', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'least', 'something', 'also', 'regardless', 'horrible', 'stereotypes', 'set', 'Texas', 'time', 'movie', 'set', 'Texas', 'Maryland', 'am', 'fan', 'quote', 'front', 'cover', 'more', 'frightening', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'many', 'meant', 'films', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'hate', 'writing', 'reviews', 'know', 'lot', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'movies', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'time', 'case', 'then', 'commend', 'involved', 'making', 'film', 'happening', 'going', 'further', '[', 'internet', 'critics', ']', 'have', 'said', 'will', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'stuff', 'writer/director/star', 'Paul', 'Gagn', 'eacute', 'maybe', 'career', 'progressed', 'so', 'Blood', 'Predator', 'here', 'come']",Slaughter House Massacre
902901,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B0009A40AC,Grindhouse and Horror,"[0, 0]","This is a cheap digital video slasher flick that was probably filmed with a mini DV camcorder. It's about a small group of people in a slaughterhouse encountering some psycho who has returned from the dead. There's a flashback murder scene earlier on in the film. After this, you're going to have to wait awhile until the next death. The films slow pacing and lack of violence until the latter portions of the movie might disappoint some slasher fans. The movie doesn't have any extreme gore, but it has some cheap but decent kills; and a few of these deaths consist of some really cheap CGI effects. Some slasher fans may want more gore in this one. It does, however, deliver in terms of sex and nudity with good looking women. There's a lesbian sequence at a party, as well as full nudity and some hard R rated sexual stuff. The entire thing is really easy to follow, so you don't have to worry about paying attention to it. Some will like the film but others won't because it's amateurish, cheap, and it drags in parts; if they picked up the movies pace, it would've been much better. Despite some problems, I thought it was a fun film. At least it earns its R rating.The DVD is in widescreen, but it's not anamorphic.

902902,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0009A40AC,Micheal Hunt,"[7, 9]","This films Australian release title is ""Sickle""...but I call it SUCKle. If you ever see this POS Garbage, you will agree, or want to name it much worse things.The plot is about a group of unsupervised misfit teenagers who go to a slaughterhouse where ten years ago a guy named Sickle killed someone and was killed in return. A bunch of kids go up there ten years later and do a magic chant to bring him back, and then he starts stalking them in a building they cant escape from. (ZZZZzzzzzzzz)This movie sucks to high heaven. I was bored stupid from the beginning to the end. The idea for the thing could have worked, but EVERYTHING about this movie was done wrong. The acting is terrible, the lighting is pathetic, the score doesn't work, the sound department is so stupid they think a car backing up slowly on gravel make's a skidding/burnout noise and the editing draws out the longest most boring scenes imaginable, not to mention inserts absolute crap for no reason other than it makes this thing seem to go on forever and ever, getting more boring by the minute. Should you find yourself watching this for some ungodly reason, and you think about turning it off, for the love of god, do it!!! Trust me, it DOES NOT GET BETTER.The only people I would recommend this DVD to would be to student film makers who wanna see a perfect example of how NOT to make a movie. Overall there is not one single thing in this entire film that I can say anything positive about. The worst thing in the entire movie is a lesbian scene at a party that goes for about 5 minutes that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie at all. It has no tie in, no reason to be there, and has absolutely nothing or anything to do with the plot. It's just a party where 2 chicks start making out and stripping, in the middle of the main room at a party! It goes from a bad Z-grade horror movie to a - Z grade soft porno scene, then back to a bad minus Z grade movie.WARNING: Don't think it would be interesting to see this useless lesbian make out scene, it's not... it doesn't match the film at all, nor is it in anyway sexy. My theory on this is that it must be this directors first movie, and it shows how much they need to learn about editing, cutting things down, and improving the scene because it's just too long and boring and it needs more gore then just showing shadows. The director obviously told two girls he was going to make a movie, and promised they could be in it. So he gets them to make out, films it, got off, got a clearer head, and shot the rest of the movie.This movie is terrible, you'd have to be seriously f****d in the head or have a seriously low I.Q to enjoy this movie. Everything is bad about this film. Every category there is in making a movie right is done badly with this film that tries too hard to be a Friday The 13th / Scream / I know what you did last summer combination that does not come off as anything but a try-hard rip off.My advice to whoever put this thing together... figure out what the cutting room floor is about, pick up the pace and you might have got a half star from me. I only give it a 1 star here 'cause Amazon doesn't give an option for minus stars a a rating. This one, is the worst film I have ever seen in my life, and I would still complain if Amazon did have a minus stars rating, as it would not go low enough to rate this movie.This is the worst film of 2005.Rent it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you...and for the love of Pete, DON'T EVER BUY IT.... it's not so bad it's laughable.2013 EDIT:My opinion has not changed at all on this film. Even 8 years later, this is still the worst movie I have ever seen. And I am outrages, disgusted and shocked so much that I wanna puke that I have just seen that this film, no, this absolute piece of monkey feces' (to say it nicely) is about to released on BluRay. WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO????? Those poor innocent blank bluray discs did nothing at all to anyone, or anything. But now their playback life is doomed to being nothing but entombed in plastic wrapper for the rest of it's existence, praying no one attempts to watch was forcibly tattooed onto it's stomach, only to become a Frisbee or some bored persons weird inspirational thought to see if you can roller skate on a bluray disc. Think of the poor and innocent blank blurays that have to suffer to have SUCKkle imprinted onto them. I don't know what the word for inhumane for a plastic disc is, but if you see them with SUCKle on it, do them a favor, put them out of their suffering and burn them to a crisp. The discs would want it that way.",1,sUckle aka The Worst Movie Ever Made.,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,4604,"['Australian', 'release', 'title', 'Sickle', 'call', 'SUCKle', 'ever', 'see', 'POS', 'Garbage', 'will', 'agree', 'want', 'name', 'much', 'worse', 'things.The', 'plot', 'group', 'unsupervised', 'misfit', 'teenagers', 'who', 'go', 'slaughterhouse', 'where', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'guy', 'named', 'Sickle', 'killed', 'someone', 'was', 'killed', 'return', 'bunch', 'kids', 'go', 'up', 'there', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'do', 'magic', 'chant', 'bring', 'back', 'then', 'stalking', 'building', 'cant', 'escape', 'ZZZZzzzzzzzz', 'movie', 'high', 'heaven', 'was', 'bored', 'stupid', 'beginning', 'end', 'idea', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'EVERYTHING', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'wrong', 'acting', 'terrible', 'lighting', 'pathetic', 'score', ""n't"", 'work', 'sound', 'department', 'so', 'stupid', 'think', 'car', 'backing', 'up', 'slowly', 'gravel', 'make', 'skidding/burnout', 'noise', 'editing', 'draws', 'longest', 'most', 'boring', 'scenes', 'imaginable', 'not', 'mention', 'inserts', 'absolute', 'crap', 'reason', 'other', 'thing', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'ever', 'getting', 'more', 'boring', 'minute', 'Should', 'find', 'watching', 'ungodly', 'reason', 'think', 'turning', 'off', 'love', 'god', 'do', 'Trust', 'NOT', 'GET', 'BETTER.The', 'only', 'people', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'student', 'film', 'makers', 'who', 'wan', 'see', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'NOT', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'thing', 'entire', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'anything', 'positive', 'worst', 'thing', 'entire', 'movie', 'lesbian', 'scene', 'party', '5', 'minutes', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'tie', 'reason', 'be', 'there', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'anything', 'do', 'plot', 'just', 'party', 'where', '2', 'chicks', 'start', 'making', 'out', 'stripping', 'middle', 'main', 'room', 'party', 'bad', 'Z-grade', 'horror', 'movie', 'Z', 'grade', 'soft', 'porno', 'scene', 'then', 'back', 'bad', 'minus', 'Z', 'grade', 'movie.WARNING', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'useless', 'lesbian', 'make', 'scene', 'not', ""n't"", 'match', 'film', 'anyway', 'sexy', 'theory', 'must', 'be', 'directors', 'first', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'need', 'learn', 'editing', 'cutting', 'things', 'down', 'improving', 'scene', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'boring', 'more', 'gore', 'then', 'just', 'showing', 'shadows', 'director', 'obviously', 'told', 'two', 'girls', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'promised', 'could', 'be', 'make', 'out', 'films', 'got', 'off', 'got', 'clearer', 'head', 'shot', 'rest', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'terrible', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'seriously', 'f****d', 'head', 'have', 'seriously', 'low', 'I.Q', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Everything', 'bad', 'film', 'category', 'making', 'movie', 'right', 'done', 'badly', 'film', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'Friday', '13th', '/', 'Scream', '/', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'last', 'summer', 'combination', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'anything', 'try-hard', 'rip', 'off.My', 'advice', 'whoever', 'put', 'thing', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'about', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'might', 'have', 'got', 'half', 'star', 'only', 'give', '1', 'star', 'here', ""'cause"", 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'give', 'option', 'minus', 'rating', 'one', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'would', 'still', 'complain', 'Amazon', 'did', 'have', 'minus', 'rating', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'low', 'enough', 'rate', 'movie.This', 'worst', 'film', '2005.Rent', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'love', 'Pete', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'EVER', 'BUY', 'IT', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'laughable.2013', 'EDIT', 'opinion', 'not', 'changed', 'film', 'Even', '8', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'outrages', 'disgusted', 'shocked', 'so', 'much', 'wan', 'na', 'puke', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'absolute', 'piece', 'monkey', 'feces', 'say', 'nicely', 'released', 'BluRay', 'WHAT', 'WORLD', 'COMING', 'TO', 'poor', 'innocent', 'blank', 'bluray', 'discs', 'did', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'anything', 'now', 'playback', 'life', 'doomed', 'being', 'nothing', 'entombed', 'plastic', 'wrapper', 'rest', 'existence', 'praying', 'one', 'watch', 'was', 'forcibly', 'tattooed', 'stomach', 'only', 'become', 'Frisbee', 'bored', 'persons', 'weird', 'inspirational', 'thought', 'see', 'can', 'roller', 'skate', 'bluray', 'disc', 'Think', 'poor', 'innocent', 'blank', 'blurays', 'have', 'suffer', 'have', 'SUCKkle', 'imprinted', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'word', 'inhumane', 'plastic', 'disc', 'see', 'SUCKle', 'do', 'favor', 'put', 'suffering', 'burn', 'crisp', 'discs', 'would', 'want', 'way']",Slaughter House Massacre

902904,A3UAIEHXTUT85G,B0009A40AC,"S. Boone ""TheatreX""","[4, 5]","So Lion's Gate slaps a list price of $29 on this?  Amazing the juevos people have these days.  Considering what a horror this movie is, that absolutely amazes me.  We have the usual stoned and drunk teenagers, oversexed and under-brained, and out for a good time.  So of course they go to see where Mr. Sickle the slaughterhouse worker was killed 10 years ago & he comes back to wreak havoc like a recycled Freddy Krueger or something.  We have a long long scene where two chicks feel each other up while partygoers stand and watch, whee.  Is it a rule to put bi/lesbian scenes in stupid horror movies these days?  One would think so.  Anyway back to the marginally more interesting part:  some dude called Stoner is enlisted to show up at the slaughterhouse & dress like the killer to scare the chicks, he gets mad (or stoned, hard to tell) and decides not to do it.  During the course of the movie he smokes enough weed to immobilize a small country but still remains conscious, or at least what passes for concious in this movie.  The viewer may have problems remaining conscious though.  One almost decent effect has one hapless idiot ""split"" but I saw that already in Ichi the Killer & it was done much better & is a movie more worthy of your attention.  Let's not forget the one chick that's sort of the ""heroine"" of the movie, she of the strident personality that also announces to her boyfriend that she's pregnant, so of course he shoves her head first out a tiny window to go for help.  But help isn't coming, not for the teens nor for the viewer.  A truly pathetic piece of garbage and I guess I ""took one for the team"" on this.

In situations like this several people wonder into an area that have stories about them but they don't believe them. One by one they get picked off until just one survives and kill the bad guy. Still I will keep on watching them hoping for something different. I like movies where even the main character gets done in too. Less predictable that way. .,2,Horror Movies,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,417,"['liked', 'movie', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'was', 'predictable', 'situations', 'several', 'people', 'wonder', 'area', 'have', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'One', 'one', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'just', 'one', 'survives', 'kill', 'bad', 'guy', 'Still', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'hoping', 'something', 'different', 'movies', 'where', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'done', 'too', 'Less', 'predictable', 'way']",Slaughter House Massacre
