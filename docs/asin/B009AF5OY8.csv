I found the Lewis/Hobson romance (hinted at in the past season or so) a bit rushed and thought another episode length could've been used to develop things a bit better but the main parts of the episodes are well worthwhile.I'd read online in the British paper &#34;The Telegraph&#34; that this would be the end, Kevin Whately saying Lewis was of retirement age and that he & costar Laurence Fox both wanted to move on- he was open to &#34;one-offs&#34; so maybe we'll get more Lewis yet.The British edition has no extras other than subtitling, doesn't look like the U.S. will either.I'll be buying the U.S. release in Blu ray, I'm sure it'll look great, I know the stories are and the location Oxford area locations always are!",4,"4, not 3, episodes would've been better&#8230;still worth buying",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1088,"['bought', 'UK', 'DVD', 'release', 'last', 'February', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'months', 'later', 'here', 'rate', 'PBS', 'showing', 'things', 'might', 'get', 'U.S.', 'release', 'first', 'too', 'was', 'hurry', 'see', 'good', 'British', 'TV', 'think', 'last', 'Lewis', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'what', 'U.S.', 'called', '34', 'Season', 'Five', '34', 'not', 'much', 'complain', 'here', 'found', 'Lewis/Hobson', 'romance', 'hinted', 'past', 'season', 'so', 'bit', 'rushed', 'thought', 'episode', 'length', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'develop', 'things', 'bit', 'better', 'main', 'parts', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'worthwhile.I', ""'d"", 'read', 'online', 'British', 'paper', '34', 'Telegraph', '34', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'saying', 'Lewis', 'was', 'retirement', 'age', 'costar', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'wanted', 'move', 'on-', 'was', 'open', '34', 'one-offs', '34', 'so', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'Lewis', 'British', 'edition', 'extras', 'other', 'subtitling', ""n't"", 'look', 'U.S.', 'will', 'either.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'U.S.', 'release', 'Blu', 'ray', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'look', 'great', 'know', 'stories', 'are', 'location', 'Oxford', 'area', 'locations', 'always', 'are']",Lewis - Series 6 [NON-U.S.A.

The romantic in me greatly enjoyed seeing movement in the &#34;Push me, Pull me&#34; relationship between Lewis and Laura Hobson. It rang very true that Lewis is stepping out of his guilt-nurtured clinging to his wife and on to seeing new possibilities for his life. The stories here stand well on their own as mysteries.I also happened to be able to see the third episode and then view the final Morse episode &#34;The Remosrseful Day&#34; as I had ordered the 25th anniversary collection from Amazon and had a visitor who had seen all the but that final episode so we played it. The writers of the current Lewis series very nicely come full circle and wrote a script that brings the unfinished business in Morse and Lewis' relationship to a closer relationship between Lewis and Hathaway. That pairing of stories is very nice. Again I applaud Colin Dexter's creation of characters as a mystery series that brings the amateur detective of the Agatha Christie vein to the professional police detective and bridges the older style detective fiction with the modern police procedural to create a very satisfying story form. The writers and creators who have taken the characters further and added Hathaway to the mix have kept the spirit and brilliance of the original without feeling the need to totally change the style and characters.

1589854,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B009AF5OY8,FYI,"[87, 90]","This last collection was released as ""Lewis: Series Seven"" in the U.K. (available via Amazon U.K.); here it will be released as ""Series Six."" Sadly, although vague promises have been proffered that more spin-offs may someday be made, this is the last venture for the superb duo of Kevin Whately as Detective Inspector Robert Lewis, and Laurence Fox as D.S. James Hathaway. The series balances their relationship, each with his own strengths, no egos running amuck. Kevin Whately brings depth and drollery to his characterization of the widowed Lewis, whilst Laurence Fox as Hathaway adds wry humor as an ex-seminarian with issues of his own. Fox is gifted with a remarkable voice that would not go amiss in other ventures. Clare Holman as Dr. Laura Hobson adds another rich dimension with her elegant intelligence. Rebecca Front is great as the formidable ""Mum,""  Chief Superintendent Innocent. Of course, it's a treat to meander through Oxford's beautifully filmed spires, cobbled streets, and nearby countryside. The tensions between upper-class academics and regular citizens of Oxford are examined.Each of the three episodes is feature-length, total running time is approximately 266 minutes; English subtitles; but no Specials! The three episodes:Down Among the FearfulCramped in rooms in his Oxford college with his wife and baby, psychology student Reuben Beatty leads a double life, moonlighting as a psychic. He hopes to make more money for his young family, but these aspirations are dashed when he is found mysteriously murdered after a session; his wife has no idea what her husband has been up to. Lewis and Hathaway investigate the world of psychic mediums in Oxford, not all is easily explained through rational means. Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Hobson subtlety seems to recognize that her feelings for the kind and jocular Lewis have deepened.The Ramblin' BoyAll goes awry after a party at a local big-shot's (Peter Davison) mansion. At the mortuary, bodies appear to be getting mixed-up, whilst an old philandering colleague of D.I. Lewis, Chief Superintendent Martin Cornish, has gone missing. The narrative expands from the environs of Oxford, to Bosnia. The best part of this is that it shows Hathaway off on a ""sabbatical,"" searching for meaning by volunteering in poverty-stricken areas. One story-thread follows a suspicious female professor who has a bad history with men, who is overly obsessed with the girlfriend of another suspect, the ""ramblin' boy,"" who is failing university. His father has serious booze issues, and was present at the party that started the mystery. The relationship between Laura and Robbie deepens, over delicious take-out.Intelligent DesignBeautifully filmed, in a loving ode to Oxford, this last mystery resolves loose threads; it's s worthy send-off. We're back in traditional Morse/Lewis habitat now, with power-hungry Oxford Dons, gleaming science laboratories, and voraciously ambitious students. A man is released from prison, soon to meet a grisly end. Turns out he is a highly accomplished Oxford scientist who thoroughly disliked his holier-than-thou wife, and that he had killed a young girl in a drunk driving accident. In true ""Lewis"" style, a la Morse, during construction, a dessicated body is found in the Church attic where the murdered man's wife is Reverend. Meanwhile, Lewis considers retirement, in order to spend more time with his family and on his relationship with Dr. Hobson. Hathaway is disgusted by his own growing cynicism towards all suspects. All concludes at a familiar table at a pub, with pints at sunset.

For six (6) seasons I have really enjoyed the British mystery series of ""Lewis"" that are set in England in Oxford.  For six (6) seasons the PBS series of ""Lewis"" has provided greatly written, directed and acted murder/mysteries that are shown without gratuitous violence and/or without extreme and jarring ""special effects"".  Season six (6) continues the aforesaid qualities.  Season six (6) has three (3) superbly written mysteries that are wonderfully directed and acted by Kevin Whatley as Lewis and by his ""side-kick"" Sergeant James Hathaway--fabulously acted by Lawrence Fox.  Those two are so good at solving this season's mysteries that involve death by powerful animal drugs, a fake clairvoyant, mysterious/unknown body cremated to cover illegal drug trade, death by one's own car, etc.  (Be advised that Hathaway appears in only two episodes appearing only briefly in the second episode)  Lewis and Hathaway solve the mysteries without any screaming and without much high tech help; the mysteries, once again, are solved just by good ""old fashioned"" sleuthing.  Hathaway and Lewis complement each other so well in Season six (6)--Lewis is near to retirement with a touch of cynicism plus new romance in his life and Hathaway being still very young and rather eager to ""do good"" and wondering ""what to do next"" with his life.I will truly miss this British series because it has entertained so very well.",5,"""Lewis"" mysteries will be sorely missed by me",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1568,"['became', 'fan', 'character', 'Lewis', 'when', 'was', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'long-suffering', 'side-kick', 'wonderful', 'long', 'running', 'Morse', 'mystery', 'series', 'six', '6', 'seasons', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'British', 'mystery', 'series', 'Lewis', 'are', 'set', 'England', 'Oxford', 'six', '6', 'seasons', 'PBS', 'series', 'Lewis', 'provided', 'greatly', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'murder/mysteries', 'are', 'shown', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'and/or', 'extreme', 'jarring', 'special', 'effects', 'Season', 'six', '6', 'aforesaid', 'qualities', 'Season', 'six', '6', 'three', '3', 'superbly', 'written', 'mysteries', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'directed', 'acted', 'Kevin', 'Whatley', 'Lewis', 'side-kick', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'Hathaway', 'fabulously', 'acted', 'Lawrence', 'Fox', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'solving', 'season', 'mysteries', 'involve', 'death', 'powerful', 'animal', 'drugs', 'fake', 'clairvoyant', 'mysterious/unknown', 'body', 'cremated', 'cover', 'illegal', 'drug', 'trade', 'death', 'one', 'own', 'car', 'etc', 'Be', 'advised', 'Hathaway', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'appearing', 'only', 'briefly', 'second', 'episode', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'screaming', 'much', 'high', 'tech', 'help', 'mysteries', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'solved', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'sleuthing', 'Hathaway', 'Lewis', 'complement', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'Season', 'six', '6', 'Lewis', 'retirement', 'touch', 'cynicism', 'new', 'romance', 'life', 'Hathaway', 'being', 'still', 'very', 'young', 'rather', 'eager', 'do', 'good', 'wondering', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'life.I', 'will', 'truly', 'miss', 'British', 'series', 'entertained', 'so', 'very', 'well']",Lewis - Series 6 [NON-U.S.A.

1589872,A168U519Q8TKZC,B009AF5OY8,James B. Casey,"[3, 4]","Veteran actors Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox portray Detective Inspector Lewis and Sergeant Hathaway in what may be the final three mysteries of the expertly written and brilliantly performed series that began with a pilot in 2005 as a sequel to the extremely popular Inspector Morse series (1987-2000).  In many respects, the chemistry and working relationship between the affable and efficient Inspector Lewis and the thoughtful, intellectual Sergeant Fox was more affirming and less caustic than that between the grumpy, brilliant Morse and his more steady side kick Sergeant Lewis.  Set in the beautiful, captivating ancient city and colleges Oxford University, the mysteries during the period from 2005 to 2013 have retained their intelligence, depth and twists that keep mystery buffs guessing while incorporating the new technology and relevance to an age of wireless communications and smartphones.  All three episodes in this set offer clever, well crafted mysteries.  The final one -- Intelligent Design -- shows Lewis move towards relaxing and fulfilling retirement and happy marriage to Dr. Hobson in a much more satisfying conclusion than the lonely, anguished death of Morse in Remorseful Day.  Great as it was, the Morse series starring the incomparable John Thaw has been ably succeeded and possibly even surpassed by the Inspector Lewis series.  Given that Lewis, Hathaway and Hobson are alive and well at the end of this series, a revival is at least possible.  (Kevin Whately, born February 6, 1951, is now age 62. Suitable retirement age?

1589892,A28YDMI499J1X9,B009AF5OY8,J. Janssen,"[2, 2]","By now most are aware that Season Six includes the finale  of ""Inspector Lewis"".  Whether they sporadically continue the episodes as specials (as was done with ""A Touch of Frost"") is unknown, but for now it appears the Morse themed homage to Oxford will continue with ""Endeavour"" and Lewis will be allowed to gracefully retire and set up housekeeping with Dr. Laura.These episodes represent a departure from the rather mundane scripts of the last several years.  From the outset they deviated from Colin Dexter's characterization of the Oxford Police by launching the cast into a protracted campus police role where just about every investigation was focused on the colleges.  I'm not sure why this creative decision was made but the episodes soon became repetitive, at times pretentious,  and certainly not worthy of the sequel status PBS had appended to it.  By contrast, the Morse episodes were diverse and only a few dealt with the colleges directly.  It was much more likely to find  Morse and then DS Lewis out of the academic environment dealing with known criminals, the landed gentry, or troubled townies. For some inexplicable reason the Lewis producers turned the time honored Oxford social tension of ""town and gown"" into all gown and no town.  That, and the inability of the writers to develop Lewis into a dominant lead character limited the episodes to be a pleasant but shallow police procedural rather than the personality driven drama of it's predecessor.  In these final episodes the writing is still weak and too much time is wasted showing Lewis and Hathaway strolling across the same college courtyards they seem to cover in every film, but there's a certain thematic diversity that's been lacking in previous seasons.  They still didn't resolve the ""is he or isn't he gay"" tease on Hathaway, but at least they seem to have solidified Lewis as a soon to be happy pensioner.In a literary trilogy the middle novel often represents a difficult transition from the initial story arc to something new and different.  Perhaps with ""Endeavour"" they'll be able to bring the Morse saga full circle and create a video trilogy worthy of the Dexter novels.  Regardless, Lewis Season 6 stands on it's own as a fitting denouement to a story line and title character many of us have known for over 25 years (or 38 years if you first met Lewis in print).

1589972,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B009AF5OY8,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","Series 6 of ""Inspector Lewis"" is expected to be its last, so the writers have taken the opportunity to tie up some loose ends, even if the series does end up in the air and leave us not quite believing that there will be no more. Detective Inspector Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) and Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox) are back for three episodes. The plotlines are less conspicuously academic than in previous series, only tangentially connected to Oxford University. That diminishes ""Inspector Lewis"" unique flavor a bit, but I'm happy to report that, in two out of three episodes, the culprits have tangible, believable motives, rather than being motivated to murder by bizarre neuroses. There is little attention paid to the relationship between the two detectives, as has been a common theme in previous seasons. Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman) also returns as the series down-to-earth police pathologist. The writing suffers from its typical plot holes and coincidences, but the mysteries are generally entertaining -with the exception of ""The Ramblin' Boy"", which is poorly written. Series 6 in the US is Series 7 in the UK. The episodes are:In ""Down Among the Fearful"", practicing psychic Randolf James (Edwin Thomas) is found dead in his office, having been injected with a barbiturate and then a paralytic, so he was well aware that he was dying. James specialized in communicating with the dead, and, upon investigation, turns out to be a psychology graduate student by the name of Ruben Beatty conducting an experiment on why people cling to religious and paranormal views of the world. The list of suspects extends to disgruntled clients who may have found out that James was a fraud, rival psychics Frank McLean (Dominic Mafham) and the troubled Justine Skinner (Beatie Edney), and Beatty's colleagues at the university, including Vicki Walmsley (Tuppence Middleton), who fears for her life but is reluctant to tell Lewis or Hathaway why. The murderer has a goofy motive, but the episode is otherwise entertaining.""The Ramblin' Boy"" finds DS Hathaway on vacation, while DI Lewis investigates a misplaced corpse at home. Lewis has a temporary partner, the ambitious but inexperienced DC Alex Gray (Babou Ceesay). The embalmed corpse of an elderly man is found in the woods. He died of natural causes and was thought to have been cremated, leading Lewis to suspect that someone else's body was in the casket. Wealthy businessman Peter Faulkner (Peter Davison) is an investor in the funeral parlor, and his wife is recently rumored to have run off with a police officer, Jack Cornish (Mark Powley), which makes Lewis suspect that Cornish was the victim. But there is another murder and Liam Jay (Taron Egerton), a young man who works at the funeral parlor, seems to know something. This mystery has too many characters, is convoluted and difficult to follow, and relies upon everyone incriminating themselves.In ""Intelligent Design"", Prof. Richard Seager (Stephen Churchett), just released from prison after serving a sentence for vehicular manslaughter, is murdered when someone runs over him with his own car. The obvious suspect is Rachel Cliff (Crystal Leaity), the distraught sister of Seager's victim. But Seager left a mysterious message carved into the car's paint before he died, and his wife Martha (Alison Steadman), a vicar, lied to Lewis and Hathaway about their relationship. Seager was involved in research on Alzheimer's disease, and his fellowship at the university was revoked on account of his criminal conviction. Dr. Stella Drew (Miranda Raison) was promoted into his place, providing her with a motive for murder. Her husband, Carl (Ariyon Bakare), is a high school chemistry teacher and tutor to Rachel Cliff's boyfriend. The murderer has a credible motive in this one, even if it is not quite satisfying.",4,"Last Season of ""Lewis"" Not Its Best or Worst, but Generally Entertaining Mysteries.",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,3852,"['Series', '6', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'expected', 'be', 'last', 'writers', 'have', 'taken', 'opportunity', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'even', 'series', 'end', 'up', 'air', 'leave', 'not', 'quite', 'believing', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Robbie', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'Hathaway', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'are', 'back', 'three', 'episodes', 'plotlines', 'are', 'less', 'conspicuously', 'academic', 'previous', 'series', 'only', 'tangentially', 'connected', 'Oxford', 'University', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'unique', 'flavor', 'bit', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'culprits', 'have', 'tangible', 'believable', 'motives', 'rather', 'being', 'motivated', 'murder', 'bizarre', 'neuroses', 'little', 'attention', 'paid', 'relationship', 'two', 'detectives', 'been', 'common', 'theme', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Dr.', 'Laura', 'Hobson', 'Clare', 'Holman', 'also', 'series', 'down-to-earth', 'police', 'pathologist', 'writing', 'suffers', 'typical', 'plot', 'holes', 'coincidences', 'mysteries', 'are', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'exception', 'Ramblin', 'Boy', 'poorly', 'written', 'Series', '6', 'US', 'Series', '7', 'UK', 'episodes', 'are', 'Down', 'Fearful', 'practicing', 'psychic', 'Randolf', 'James', 'Edwin', 'Thomas', 'found', 'dead', 'office', 'having', 'been', 'injected', 'barbiturate', 'then', 'paralytic', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'was', 'dying', 'James', 'specialized', 'communicating', 'dead', 'investigation', 'out', 'be', 'psychology', 'graduate', 'student', 'name', 'Ruben', 'Beatty', 'conducting', 'experiment', 'why', 'people', 'cling', 'religious', 'paranormal', 'views', 'world', 'list', 'suspects', 'extends', 'disgruntled', 'clients', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'James', 'was', 'fraud', 'rival', 'psychics', 'Frank', 'McLean', 'Dominic', 'Mafham', 'troubled', 'Justine', 'Skinner', 'Beatie', 'Edney', 'Beatty', 'colleagues', 'university', 'including', 'Vicki', 'Walmsley', 'Tuppence', 'Middleton', 'who', 'life', 'reluctant', 'tell', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'why', 'murderer', 'goofy', 'motive', 'episode', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'Ramblin', 'Boy', 'DS', 'Hathaway', 'vacation', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'misplaced', 'corpse', 'home', 'Lewis', 'temporary', 'partner', 'ambitious', 'inexperienced', 'DC', 'Alex', 'Gray', 'Babou', 'Ceesay', 'embalmed', 'corpse', 'elderly', 'man', 'found', 'woods', 'died', 'natural', 'causes', 'was', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'cremated', 'leading', 'Lewis', 'suspect', 'someone', 'else', 'body', 'was', 'casket', 'Wealthy', 'businessman', 'Peter', 'Faulkner', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'investor', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'wife', 'recently', 'rumored', 'have', 'run', 'off', 'police', 'officer', 'Jack', 'Cornish', 'Mark', 'Powley', 'Lewis', 'suspect', 'Cornish', 'was', 'victim', 'murder', 'Liam', 'Jay', 'Taron', 'Egerton', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'know', 'something', 'mystery', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'convoluted', 'difficult', 'follow', 'relies', 'everyone', 'incriminating', 'themselves.In', 'Intelligent', 'Design', 'Prof.', 'Richard', 'Seager', 'Stephen', 'Churchett', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', 'sentence', 'vehicular', 'manslaughter', 'murdered', 'when', 'someone', 'own', 'car', 'obvious', 'suspect', 'Rachel', 'Cliff', 'Crystal', 'Leaity', 'distraught', 'sister', 'Seager', 'victim', 'Seager', 'left', 'mysterious', 'message', 'carved', 'car', 'paint', 'died', 'wife', 'Martha', 'Alison', 'Steadman', 'vicar', 'lied', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'relationship', 'Seager', 'was', 'involved', 'research', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'fellowship', 'university', 'was', 'revoked', 'account', 'criminal', 'conviction', 'Dr.', 'Stella', 'Drew', 'Miranda', 'Raison', 'was', 'promoted', 'place', 'providing', 'motive', 'murder', 'husband', 'Carl', 'Ariyon', 'Bakare', 'high', 'school', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'tutor', 'Rachel', 'Cliff', 'boyfriend', 'murderer', 'credible', 'motive', 'one', 'even', 'not', 'quite', 'satisfying']",Lewis - Series 6 [NON-U.S.A.

1589980,A3TD5ZIKOPE8BP,B009AF5OY8,Nicholas D. Gough,"[0, 0]","As with the rest of the stories about Morse or Lewis, this entire run of many episodes from ITV and Masterpiece (PBS) is top notch. It will be missed, as the gentleness and humanistic attitudes of Lewis and Hathaway are a peek into how any of us would handle such roles on a police force. The interaction of these characters is almost as legendary and just as warm and thoughtful as was the relationship between Morse and Lewis. I find the final scene of Lewis and Hathaway sitting next to the water and the boats gliding by, each sipping from pints of ale most appealing and indicative of how each may have felt seeing their characters leave the Oxford police force. I wonder if each actor had some mixed feelings in this scene. It was not only the end of their character's employment with the police, but also the end of the program with each going off on their own to continue their careers in other ""endeavours"" (pun intended).As a lead-in to the newest peek into this world of police work in Oxford, we now have ""Endeavour"" to satisfy our interest in the characters since it was Morse who began it all... he was assigned Lewis as his DS and then the Morse episodes and long-running program began to pique our interests and grip us with great stories and productions and acting.I was expecting the traditional Morse Code theme at the very end of the last episode of ""Lewis"", but it sadly never occurred.I am sure that everyone involved in all of the Morse/Lewis productions were sad to not only see John Thaw pass away, but to see the end to each program. They had a great run and should be very proud of their work as it will live on for a very long time.All this being said, I just now learned of new seasons for ""Inspector Lewis"". While this is great news, it is hard to imagine how the production team were able to arrive at a process of keeping these characters on the police force, especially since each character had been so vocal on moving onto another phase of their lives. So... onto Series 7 & 8 and beyond... I cannot wait to see these on PBS here in the States. If you are confused, it appears the programs are labelled differently for Amazon. I will need to check this out, as in reality, it appears that what is listed as Season 6 (which this last episode is a part of) could actually be Season 7. Off to play detective, I guess. :-)AHA!!

I have exhausted all of the American stuff that I can stomach and for one or two, repeated the series, before I discovered Brit TV through MI5. After a series is finished, I sometimes have a sort of emotional hole where that series had taken up space in my attention. Nothing, absolutely nothing has created the kind of hole that the end of Morse and now the end of Lewis produces. I feel as though I am on the edge of 'mourning' my loss of any more opportunities to experience these phenomenal interactions and story lines. I have no words for what exactly it is that gives these shows their power albeit some of it is the aimed for demographic which I fit. I've never really felt 'groupie' for anything except maybe my Marine Corps, but having watched the penultimate episode and facing the very last episode of Lewis, I am feeling a sadness of a level that seems absurd for a vicarious television experience, but there it is. This may just be a side effect of binging behavior but I will watch the last episode as though I were sitting at the bedside of a friend in the final asymptote to zero. Sigh. Watch this series at your own emotional risk and I will go out and look for a life. But, surely and especially if you are accustomed to American TV, Morse and Lewis, as unlikely as it will seem at first, will stealthily creep up on you and somehow reach into your heart. I haven't investigated why they stopped. Maybe Laurie (Laurence Fox's family nickname and how the hell do I know that?) wanted something different. Oh well...I suppose now I just sit around looking like a dog being shown a card trick. Enjoy...Post apocalyptic addendum: If you think you might like Lewis (and Hathaway), do the whole thing. Watch Lewis mature as a detective under the wing of Morse first. I've watched people have this kind of, hmmm, strange experience becoming emotionally involved in some media thing but this is my first time. ""A true saga"" said in a deep, resonant voice. The depth of the writing, I suppose, but I'm not a critic nor even sure exactly what I mean by 'the depth of the writing'. Deftness of the writing works too so a choice of nuance anyway. Barrington's tonal tapestries certainly contributed. Maybe just the rush of the intense media binge, softened only by the glow of Tom Jefferson's favo(u)rite plant, watching one's life pass zoned out in front of a computer. Still, good story.

1590070,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B009AF5OY8,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","This is the last season of ""Inspector Lewis"", one the best British crime procedurals to grace television. I have so enjoyed this atmospheric and intelligent show, with Kevin Whately portraying beloved DI Robbie Lewis working in the academic town of Oxford, England. Fans of ""Inspector Morse""Inspector Morse 25th Anniversary Collectionwill know DI Lewis as the long-suffering DS Lewis who worked for DCI Morse (John Thaw). Morse remains an iconic TV series in the annals of British television, but I have a special fondness for ""Inspector Lewis"" possibly because I loved seeing how much DI Lewis has grown into his own consummate detective and have greatly enjoyed the banter between Lewis and his underling, the gifted and cerebral, Cambridge-educated DS James Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).For those new to ""Inspector Lewis"", I'd recommend watching this stellar series beginning with Season One as the characters evolve quite a bit over the course of the seasons and this is especially so in the case of the relationship between DI Lewis and DS Hathaway, from a certain wariness and awkwardness to one of grudging respect and affection, and a genuine friendship between the two men.There is much to recommend this series to the discerning viewer - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast including, pathologist and love interest Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman), and Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent (Rebecca Front).In this last season, there are three episodes:Down Among the Fearful - when the body of a psychic named Randolph James is discovered in his rented office space, the detectives discover that the psychic was actually a psychologist Reuben Beatty who was debunking afterlife theories. Both Lewis and Hathaway try to unmask the truth behind the murdered man's double life but find they are making little headway until Hathaway finally uncovers a clue. This is not one of my favorite episodes in the series but it kept my interest nevertheless.The Ramblin' Boy - An old colleague of Lewis, Chief Supt. Jack Cornish, goes missing while a body turns up. The case is a curious one since the discovered body turns out to be the remains of a man that has already been embalmed! Hathaway is not in on the case until the very end as he is away on leave, working on a charity-based project in Kosovo, although Lewis manages to rope him in to help out in the end. There's also the usual student and faculty politics centering around the university, and how all this is related makes for an engaging episode. In the midst of his investigations Lewis, who is temporarily assisted by the affable DC Gray, begins to make some progress in his budding romance with pathologist, Dr. Laura Hobson. I loved this episode for many reasons but primarily because viewers finally get to see Lewis and Hobson make a serious go at romance and also there's a surprising revelation towards the end (by DC Gray) that will have long-term fans of the show get all misty-eyed.Intelligent Design - this last episode is also one of the best of the series. Lewis and Hobson get more serious amidst the backdrop of a perplexing case. A professor of chemistry at Oxford who was recently released from prison (for the death of a young girl while he was driving under the influence) is found murdered outside his home, a victim of homicide. The list of suspects grows longer as another gruesome discovery is made. The body of a young Korean exchange student who went missing 15 years ago shows up when part of the college undergoes renovation. Are the two deaths linked? I found this to be a riveting episode as it is so well-written and the list of suspects makes it even more interesting. Also, this final episode sees Lewis and Hobson begin to make some serious long-term decisions regarding their relationship while Hathaway struggles with his inner self regarding his own future in the force.To sum it up, I will miss both DI Lewis' casual observances of life and the motives that drive people to commit the most heinous crimes, and of course, the divine DS Hathaway's cerebral takes on various subjects, not to mention the enjoyable banter between the two, who have become beloved characters to fans of the series. It is a pity there are only three episodes this final season, but I wish both actors the very best in their future endeavors.",5,"The end is here, but it was a blast while it lasted!",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,4379,"['last', 'season', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'crime', 'procedurals', 'grace', 'television', 'have', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'atmospheric', 'intelligent', 'show', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'portraying', 'beloved', 'DI', 'Robbie', 'Lewis', 'working', 'academic', 'town', 'Oxford', 'England', 'Fans', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Inspector', 'Morse', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Collectionwill', 'know', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'long-suffering', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'who', 'worked', 'DCI', 'Morse', 'John', 'Thaw', 'Morse', 'iconic', 'TV', 'series', 'annals', 'British', 'television', 'have', 'special', 'fondness', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'possibly', 'loved', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'grown', 'own', 'consummate', 'detective', 'have', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'banter', 'Lewis', 'underling', 'gifted', 'cerebral', 'Cambridge-educated', 'DS', 'James', 'Hathaway', 'Lawrence', 'Fox', '.For', 'new', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'stellar', 'series', 'beginning', 'Season', 'One', 'characters', 'evolve', 'quite', 'bit', 'course', 'seasons', 'especially', 'so', 'case', 'relationship', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'DS', 'Hathaway', 'certain', 'wariness', 'awkwardness', 'one', 'grudging', 'respect', 'affection', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'two', 'much', 'recommend', 'series', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'picturesque', 'Oxford', 'literary', 'references', 'riveting', 'plots', 'not', 'mention', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'pathologist', 'love', 'interest', 'Dr.', 'Laura', 'Hobson', 'Clare', 'Holman', 'Chief', 'Superintendent', 'Jean', 'Innocent', 'Rebecca', 'Front', 'last', 'season', 'are', 'three', 'episodes', 'Down', 'Fearful', 'when', 'body', 'psychic', 'named', 'Randolph', 'James', 'discovered', 'rented', 'office', 'space', 'detectives', 'discover', 'psychic', 'was', 'actually', 'psychologist', 'Reuben', 'Beatty', 'who', 'was', 'debunking', 'afterlife', 'theories', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'try', 'unmask', 'truth', 'murdered', 'man', 'double', 'life', 'are', 'making', 'little', 'headway', 'Hathaway', 'finally', 'clue', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'series', 'kept', 'interest', 'nevertheless.The', 'Ramblin', 'Boy', 'old', 'colleague', 'Lewis', 'Chief', 'Supt', 'Jack', 'Cornish', 'missing', 'body', 'up', 'case', 'curious', 'one', 'discovered', 'body', 'out', 'be', 'remains', 'man', 'already', 'been', 'embalmed', 'Hathaway', 'not', 'case', 'very', 'end', 'away', 'leave', 'working', 'charity-based', 'project', 'Kosovo', 'Lewis', 'rope', 'help', 'out', 'end', 'also', 'usual', 'student', 'faculty', 'politics', 'centering', 'university', 'how', 'related', 'engaging', 'episode', 'midst', 'investigations', 'Lewis', 'who', 'temporarily', 'assisted', 'affable', 'DC', 'Gray', 'make', 'progress', 'budding', 'romance', 'pathologist', 'Dr.', 'Laura', 'Hobson', 'loved', 'episode', 'many', 'reasons', 'primarily', 'viewers', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Lewis', 'Hobson', 'make', 'serious', 'go', 'romance', 'also', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'end', 'DC', 'Gray', 'will', 'have', 'long-term', 'fans', 'show', 'get', 'misty-eyed.Intelligent', 'Design', 'last', 'episode', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'Lewis', 'Hobson', 'get', 'more', 'serious', 'backdrop', 'perplexing', 'case', 'professor', 'chemistry', 'Oxford', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'death', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'driving', 'influence', 'found', 'murdered', 'home', 'victim', 'homicide', 'list', 'suspects', 'grows', 'longer', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'made', 'body', 'young', 'Korean', 'exchange', 'student', 'who', 'went', 'missing', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'up', 'when', 'part', 'college', 'undergoes', 'renovation', 'Are', 'two', 'deaths', 'linked', 'found', 'be', 'riveting', 'episode', 'so', 'well-written', 'list', 'suspects', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'Also', 'final', 'episode', 'sees', 'Lewis', 'Hobson', 'begin', 'make', 'serious', 'long-term', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'relationship', 'Hathaway', 'inner', 'regarding', 'own', 'future', 'force.To', 'sum', 'will', 'miss', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'casual', 'observances', 'life', 'motives', 'drive', 'people', 'commit', 'most', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'course', 'divine', 'DS', 'Hathaway', 'cerebral', 'various', 'subjects', 'not', 'mention', 'enjoyable', 'banter', 'two', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'beloved', 'characters', 'fans', 'series', 'pity', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'final', 'season', 'wish', 'actors', 'very', 'best', 'future', 'endeavors']",Lewis - Series 6 [NON-U.S.A.
