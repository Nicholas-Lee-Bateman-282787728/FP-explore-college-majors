There is definitely a lot of information on these, but she does so much talking in between moves that you lose interest. She may do 2 figure 8's and then stop and talk for 5 minutes. I would not say this is a good warm up nor is it good for a belly dance workout. If you sit down with a notepad and take notes on what she says it's good info, but again, a lot of talking. For what she actually does in moves, it could have been put on one DVD and called it good. For as little as I've used it, it wasn't worth the money.",3,Too much talking,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,638,"['have', 'never', 'really', 'used', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'however', 'looked', 'several', 'times', 'am', 'just', 'overall', 'disapointed', 'definitely', 'lot', 'information', 'so', 'much', 'talking', 'moves', 'lose', 'interest', 'may', 'do', '2', 'figure', '8', 'then', 'stop', 'talk', '5', 'minutes', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'good', 'warm', 'up', 'good', 'belly', 'dance', 'workout', 'sit', 'down', 'notepad', 'take', 'notes', 'what', 'good', 'info', 'again', 'lot', 'talking', 'what', 'actually', 'moves', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'one', 'DVD', 'called', 'good', 'as', 'little', ""'ve"", 'used', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'money']",From A to Zoe tribal fusion set

You get 4 disc that will keep you occupied for a long time with her wealth of information, techniques and combos.  The DVDs are setup in chapters so you can easily break up your practice.Zoe breaks down her techniques quite well and then drills.  Zoe moves onto combos which Zoe clearly explains with practice after.  Zoe's signature techniques, moves and gestures are covered.  Example of just some of her techniques covered are: flutters (great explanation and breakdown), her acclaimed Zoe ""hits"", different traveling moves with layering, feather fans.  This is 1st DVD I have (and I have many belly dance) that covers feather fans!  She also includes bonus teaching of her workshops and a tribal makeup tutorial!  She has a couple lovely performances included throughout DVDs!On Zoe's hit section, she explains ""hits"" and the difference between pop, locks and hits.She covers her signature ""release and recoil"". She follows each of this explanations with drills then progresses to combos with practice for the combos.The only thing that could be improved is Zoe and team NOT using mainly that same song throughout all 4 DVDs.You can tell Zoe and her team put an EXTREME amount of effort into this DVD collection.

The voice over was going while she was doing the movements. But there was no breakdown. For instance while in  the lunge she says to keep the pelvic tucked., that should  have been stated before going into the movement. This warm-up will work who it works for.Posture;The posture section was great. I really believe great posture makes the movements all the more beautiful.Traveling stepsExplained ,-I really liked the information presented in this section. She talks about different ways to travel and why filling out your stage is good. I like the look of al of the traveling steps that were demonstrated. I also liked them because the could be utilized in a variety of belly dance styles.Practice; I like the fact that she switched sides, so you are forced to work both sides. But in no way with that short practice time are you going to ingrain these movements. Be prepared to drill on your own.  She does two speeds slow and full time. I like the fact that you can visually see her get into posture before each  set of movements.Flutters: Her explanation was decentCombinations: Both combinations start with a short demonstration then into explanations. The explanations move fast.Combination 1ExplainedSlow speedAdvanced LevelCombination 2ExplainedPracticeI enjoyed the second combinationExtra'sWorkshop: I am happy that she is stressing posture and she doe on here as well.And I enjoyed this workshop as well.

There is hardly any movement breakdown given.Even intermediate student s will struggle. It will be up to the individual if you want to go for it or not.I liked the DVD for the posture tips and workshops. The majority of the combinations I did not like neither did I care for the performances. For a cheeky girls production I thought the back drop would be a little better. Zoe can also be a little chatty. She is a bit nervous at first and it shows. She seems a little jittery and breathless in the beginning.For me the DVD was just okay. I do believe that if you stick with it, it will condition you for this kind of tribal fusion and for dancers already in this style I think this would be an excellent DVD to add to your library . Again my favorite parts were workshops and that to me is not worth $40.00.Overall though it is hard to rate this DVD anything lower than a 4 when you get 4 full DVD'S. My rate would be a 3.8. I will take this DVD from another angle though,since this is for the serious belly dancer and that is-would it give someone who wanted to advance their dance results and that answer is YES!!...3 stars for instruction3 stars for set5 stars for content3 stars for practice sessions5 stars for workshops",4,Is It worth it?,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,3793,"['Disk', 'One', 'IntroductionWarm', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'instruction', 'went', 'fast', 'was', 'kind', 'follow', 'bouncing', 'butt', 'voice', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'doing', 'movements', 'was', 'breakdown', 'instance', 'lunge', 'keep', 'pelvic', 'tucked.', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'stated', 'going', 'movement', 'warm-up', 'will', 'work', 'who', 'for.Posture', 'posture', 'section', 'was', 'great', 'really', 'believe', 'great', 'posture', 'movements', 'more', 'beautiful.Traveling', 'stepsExplained', '-I', 'really', 'liked', 'information', 'presented', 'section', 'different', 'ways', 'travel', 'why', 'filling', 'out', 'stage', 'good', 'look', 'al', 'traveling', 'steps', 'were', 'demonstrated', 'also', 'liked', 'could', 'be', 'utilized', 'variety', 'belly', 'dance', 'styles.Practice', 'like', 'fact', 'switched', 'sides', 'are', 'forced', 'work', 'sides', 'way', 'short', 'practice', 'time', 'are', 'going', 'ingrain', 'movements', 'Be', 'prepared', 'drill', 'own', 'two', 'speeds', 'slow', 'full', 'time', 'fact', 'can', 'visually', 'see', 'get', 'posture', 'set', 'movements.Flutters', 'explanation', 'was', 'decentCombinations', 'combinations', 'start', 'short', 'demonstration', 'then', 'explanations', 'explanations', 'move', 'fast.Combination', '1ExplainedSlow', 'speedAdvanced', 'LevelCombination', '2ExplainedPracticeI', 'enjoyed', 'second', ""combinationExtra'sWorkshop"", 'am', 'happy', 'stressing', 'posture', 'doe', 'here', 'well.And', 'enjoyed', 'workshop', 'as', 'well', 'leg', 'workout', 'sureCreditsSubtitulos', 'en', 'virtually', 'breakdown', 'movements', 'here', 'geared', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'dancers.2ND', 'DiskHITSExplainedSlow', 'practiceFull', 'speedCOMBINATION', '1COMBINATION', '2COMBINATION', '3All', 'combinations', 'are', 'followed', 'slow', 'practice', 'then', 'full', 'speed', 'StrentheningSuperman-pilates', 'Awareness-Foot', 'strengthening', 'balanceEach', 'one', 'followed', 'practice', 'sessionEXTRAFeather', 'fans', 'brief', 'history', 'themFollowed', 'practice', 'sessionPerformanceDisk', '3Initiating', 'movementThere', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'tips', 'initiating', 'movement', 'different', 'parts', 'body.PracticeCombination', '1Combination', ""2Extra'sWorkshopPerformanceCreditAn"", 'option', 'pick', 'Spanish', 'subtitlesDISK', '4LayeringPractice', 'layeringCombinationSlow', 'practiceFast', 'practiceCombination', 'shimmyEXTRASMake-up', 'tutorialExtended', 'practice-Drills', 'interruption/This', 'drills', 'disk', '1', 'downward.CreditsThis', 'DVD', 'not', 'beginners', 'hardly', 'movement', 'breakdown', 'given.Even', 'intermediate', 'student', 's', 'will', 'struggle', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'individual', 'want', 'go', 'not.I', 'liked', 'DVD', 'posture', 'tips', 'workshops', 'majority', 'combinations', 'did', 'not', 'did', 'care', 'performances', 'cheeky', 'girls', 'production', 'thought', 'back', 'drop', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'Zoe', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'little', 'chatty', 'bit', 'nervous', 'first', 'little', 'jittery', 'breathless', 'beginning.For', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'do', 'believe', 'stick', 'will', 'condition', 'kind', 'tribal', 'fusion', 'dancers', 'already', 'style', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'add', 'library', 'Again', 'favorite', 'parts', 'were', 'workshops', 'not', 'worth', '40.00.Overall', 'hard', 'rate', 'DVD', 'anything', 'lower', '4', 'when', 'get', '4', 'full', 'DVD', 'rate', 'would', 'be', '3.8', 'will', 'take', 'DVD', 'angle', 'serious', 'belly', 'dancer', 'is-would', 'give', 'someone', 'who', 'wanted', 'advance', 'dance', 'results', 'answer', 'YES', '3', 'stars', 'instruction3', 'stars', 'set5', 'stars', 'content3', 'stars', 'practice', 'sessions5', 'stars', 'workshops']",From A to Zoe tribal fusion set

And I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money on this disc, knowing I may never be at her level, and knowing that I'm not really into her popping style, which she does so amazingly (among other styles).  Well -  I'm really glad I got this disc. Though most of this material IS waaaayy beyond my level - I can say with confidence after just 40 minutes of disc 1, it's worth every penny. This DVD is NOT geared to teaching basic moves -- it's assumed you know them -- but it's still enriching for beginners. Well, let me take that back. There is some ""raw beginner"" material -- fluttering, posture, and some of the travelling. But it's really geared to teaching how to connect and approach moves, and perform them. It's kind of the glue that keeps moves together and also elevates them. The piece on posture is awesome, as is the warmup!!!! ... Many layers here for anyone really interested in the artistry of the dance. I'm looking forward to Disc 3, where she talks about how she powers/initiates movements. I definitely recommend this for any dancer, even if it's beyond you. This DVD gives something unique, and much to aspire to. I have a new appreciation for her unique artistry and talent, as a teacher, and a dancer.
