1460234,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B005GM38NI,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[4, 5]","Openly-gay Tommy (Ian Novick) has had a crush on hunky Daniel (Jon Prescott) ever since their college days, when Daniel was the star of their lacrosse team.  Years later, he spots Daniel in a sports bar, engages him in conversation and - many beers later - manages to get him in his bed, which Daniel claims is a first for him.  Unfortunately, he follows that up by explaining that he considers himself straight, and is engaged to marry a wonderful girl, Jen (Margaret Anne Florence).  Disappointed, Tommy makes it a point to ""run into"" Daniel (and often Jen) on several occasions, testing to see if the feelings he felt for Daniel, which he seemed to share to some extent, might make him change his mind about the marriage.Writer/Director Caytha Jentis presents an engaging and emotional, yet very realistic, portrayal of a young man who has repressed his attraction to other men for so long, he has no idea how to deal with the feelings he experiences with the person who truly might be ""The One"" for him.  There is significant heartache along the journey, and == SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT== much less than a ""happily ever after"" ending, which some viewers have complained about in their reviews. Hey, life does throw some nasty curve balls once in a while, and you're not always going to be able to hit one out of the stadium.  I give the writer credit for taking the difficult, but likely more realistic, path here. == END OF SPOILER ALERT == The acting was quite good, and, despite an indie budget, I had no beef with the production quality.

1460235,A2W1FEPSD6EOCI,B005GM38NI,cinephile,"[0, 0]","There is much to be said for this film.  It is deep and filled with lots of unexpected turns.  I specially enjoyed this film because it dives into the realm of real raw emotion-just the way people feel and think.  The way the main character is conflicted about his values vs his true emotions mixed with societal/family expectations was developed very well.  The film is also a very intelligent, well crafted piece of real life and about how things work out due to unforseen circumstances.  It is also a cautionary tale of what happens when you allow true relationships to  linger for too long without really showing the way you feel.  People, as with life, move on, so the message to the story is clear.  Do not take people for granted because once that relationship that was special is gone, it is hard to regress back to how things were.  In short, &#34;The One&#34; is about living life to the fullest with all of its consequences.

The leads are hunky, the acting is okay, and it's all nicely shot, but that's where the positives end.  The characters are depressingly shallow and the story is a queasy collation of unhealthy gay fantasy, laced with internalised homophobia.  Tommy scores the hitherto straight jock and instantly decides he's ""The One"".  There's nothing in the script to suggest this is about anything other than Daniel being ""straight""/virginal and (sorta, kinda) hot.  (Gay seduces Straight fantasy - check).  Our ""hero"" then pursues his quarry relentlessly, inviting him on a weekend away under false pretences, befriending his fianc&eacute;e, pretending to be straight to go on a double date with the newlyweds - and never stopping to wonder if any of this might be morally questionable, or evidence of a serious lack of self-esteem.  Yet we're supposed to like this guy, and then like Daniel when he starts to succumb.  I don't think so.I'm sure there are still guys who'll find all of this a turn on.

1460239,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B005GM38NI,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[10, 13]",".......almost all of us.  Read on to find out how).This isn't as well done as ""Shelter"".....nor quite as good as ""Latter Days (Unrated Edition)"".....BUT it's not far off their markA CAST OF ENGAGING CHARACTERS (making up the Devilish and Age-old TRIANGLE):- Tommy Miller (Guy #1) - (played by: Ian Novick) ---- To date, a smaller parts actor.  Yet, this film shows he merits so much more....if nothing else, for the cute hunkiness and honesty he brings to Tommy....a Guy who grabs our hearts....a Guy who's In Pursuit.  ""T"" is Open...he's Out...knows the man he wants....and he takes us along on the joyride to get him.  He's an upfront Guy, who tells it like it is.  A Mister Personality....most definitely deserving of that capital ""P"".  Of our two male lead characters, Tommy's ""The One"" you're most likely to fall for.  And you will have a ball while doing so.- Daniel (Guy #2) - (played by: Jon Prescott) ---- Lots of TV series work....yet with a plum film role in 2010's gay-related, ""Howl"", playing the James Franco character's oft-time lover.  Here, in this story, he's playing the built and pretty Daniel....an emotionally torn man, suffering a severe case of ""Closetophobia"".  Perhaps now's a good time for the question:  WHO is the love of this man's life?  Is it the fiance and wife-to-be?  Or is it, perhaps....what's that Guy's name, again?  Oh, and you should watch for what is, to me, the somewhat puzzling way in which Prescott plays this role:  facially expressive with other characters in the film.....BUT, strangely, almost always detached looking / fairly expressionless in his scenes with Tommy.AN ASIDE ABOUT DANIEL ---- Did ANY of you out there, having seen this film, realize how very many guys Daniel's life represents?  A man, like so many of us, who becomes engaged...marries and fathers a child....all the while never facing up to who he is, sexually.  How many of us are living this kind of life, one which Family...Society...expects of us?  A life which is not really our own...not who we really are?  Should it be at all surprising how many of us are Daniels- Jen (The One Stuck in the Middle) - (played by: Margaret Anne Florence) ---- Quite a bit of TV work...with 3 or so lesser movies thrown into the mix.  Jen is a pert and pretty gal, as both fiancee and bride.  A level headed woman, very much in love with her man.  YET, she's a someone who unknowingly comes to meet and grow quite friendly with ""The Other Man"".  In doing so, Florence pulls it off in a most believable manner.  Even though you and I are watching her through guys' eyes....she'll MAKE us deeply feel both her happiness and her despair.  Be prepared.A LAST THOUGHT (I told you at the beginning to watch for this):- For those of you UNhappy with the way in which this film SEEMINGLY ends....in a less than romantic way (yes, I've looked at your reviews and displeasure here and there)....just read on.- Aaah, yes.  So, Tommy...Our Mister Upfront Guy.  See...right about here is where you movie watchers should be remembering...recalling that really important thing he's already told us (more than once).  What?  What is it, you ask?  ....THAT HE IS IN LOVE...IN TRUE LOVE...(something he's also told the object of his affection).  SO...you doubters out there....put all such thoughts aside.  For there is NO way in which a man like the Tommy we've come to know...with his depth of feelings...would just walk away from ""The One"".  From that person who he just learned has again become available.  NO way in which a caring sort like Tommy would leave another man waiting at the altar.  Unless.....UNLESS he has very definite plans to reenter the life of ""The One"" (though he may wait a bit...just to make a Someone squirm).  And if you think otherwise about this, then ""T"" has, indeed, Totally Faked you out.  So....BUCK UP!...CHEER UP!......in the REAL ending of this film, you're going to get exactly what you were hoping for.  HAPPY viewing!PS:  You might want to try these 3 great little REGION 2 DVDs (probably for more mature Gays):  ""Four More Years  Fyra r till  4 More Years  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Sweden]""  ///  ""He Is My Girl  La folle histoire d'amour de Simon Eskenazy (He's My Girl  Ma mec &agrave; moi (O trelos erotas tou Simon Eskenazy  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom]""  ///  ""Different From Whom?

Unfortunately, the moments when you can laugh are really seldom. It's more drama.In a few words - it's yet another story about a guy who has problems with his own sexuality, thus he hurts everybody around.What I liked the most about this film, was the actress who played mother of the main gay character.There are parts in the screenplay that sound and look quite fake (for example the ending scenes, or the scenes with french rap music in background (he????french rap???).On the other hand, knowing the ability of US cinema makers to create real gay-theme nightmares, ""The one"" isn't entirely bad.",3,Just average - misleading cover!,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,709,"['Well', 'start', 'misleading', 'cover', 'Judging', 'actors', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'must', 'be', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'moments', 'when', 'can', 'laugh', 'are', 'really', 'seldom', 'more', 'drama.In', 'few', 'words', 'yet', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'problems', 'own', 'sexuality', 'thus', 'everybody', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'mother', 'main', 'gay', 'are', 'parts', 'screenplay', 'sound', 'look', 'quite', 'fake', 'example', 'ending', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'french', 'rap', 'music', 'background', 'french', 'rap', '.On', 'other', 'hand', 'knowing', 'ability', 'US', 'cinema', 'makers', 'create', 'real', 'gay-theme', 'nightmares', 'one', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'bad']",The One

I thought the acting was well done and the story was interesting and I was anxious to see how it would end.  I will not give any spoilers but I think the director must have run out of money or something and had been reading too many Stephen King novels and thought - wow I should end this movie like most of his books and just stop where I am right now.
