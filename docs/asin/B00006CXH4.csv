711807,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00006CXH4,Alistair McHarg,"[15, 22]","In the wrong hands, even the astonishing can be dull.  What Tobias Schneebaum did transcends our wildest imagination - an act of pure daring and liberty.  A dyed-in-the-wool NYC egghead, painter, and amateur anthropologist, he shed the trappings of society as we know it and lost himself in primitivism - not once but twice.  His first episode was in Peru, in the 50's.  Walking alone in the jungle, Schneebaum simply ""fell in"" with a headhunting tribe called the Amarekaire and lived as they did for a year.  This involved cannibalism, participating in a murderous rampage, and multiple homosexual encounters - which suited him nicely, since he was already ""out.""  (Indeed it must be observed that Mr. Schneebaum's instinct for finding primitive cultures that actively practice homosexuality is unswerving.)Returning home, Schneebaum became something of a minor celebrity, and we see clips of him telling his mind-boggling tale on talk shows, college campuses, and cruise ships.  Not content with one such experience, he repeated his feat in Papua New Guinea, where he lived among the Asmat, another headhunting tribe who, as luck would have it, practice a rather enthusiastic form of multiple-partner homosexuality, (in addition to participating in heterosexuality for purposes of procreation).That Schneebaum survived these surreal escapades is stunning, but a great story is not a great movie, and Keep The River On Your Right is just dreadful.  The central problem, beyond the various inadequacies of its directors, David and Laurie Shapiro, is the man himself, Tobias Schneebaum.  Schneebaum is on camera a lot, we are subjected to his lugubrious, plodding, and thoroughly insipid delivery ad nauseum until secretly we wish the cannibals had put him on the menu.  It is as if Schneebaum's ability to blend in with these headhunting tribes, so thoroughly foreign to his own culture, came about as the result of an absolute lack of personality, character, will, or self.  There is something disturbing, even creepy, about Schneebaum's passivity, he is able to watch the Amarekaire headhunters slaughter a rival tribe, and participate in the event, because ""that's what they did.""Schneebaum's adventures may thrill, Schneebaum does not.  This kills the picture because the aging Schneebaum, 78 when we meet him, is the film's centerpiece.  That his adventures are useless from an anthropological standpoint is totally ignored, in much the same way that Grizzly Man ignores the way Timothy Treadwell put the bears in danger while risking his own life.  All that remains to redeem this film is some nice location footage from New Guinea and Peru.  Sadly, Keep The River On Your Right fails here too.  Instead of giving viewers a sense of what these otherworldly experiences must have looked and felt like, we see ragged remnants.  Watching a toothless retired headhunter in a Mickey Mouse T-shirt, Bermuda shorts, and flip flops watching I Love Lucy re-runs piped in from a satellite dish may tell us a lot about how totally insane our world is, but it tells us nothing about Mr. Schneebaum's experience.Perhaps the greatest value of the film is that it will give you a newfound respect for screenwriters, actors, cinematographers, and actual directors.  In the hands of professionals, the astounding truth of Tobias Schneebaum might have been revealed, instead of the dreary facts.",2,More Than Just Another Gay New Yorker Gone Native Cannibalism Picture,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,3383,"['wrong', 'hands', 'even', 'astonishing', 'can', 'be', 'dull', 'What', 'Tobias', 'Schneebaum', 'did', 'transcends', 'wildest', 'imagination', 'act', 'pure', 'daring', 'liberty', 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'NYC', 'egghead', 'painter', 'amateur', 'anthropologist', 'shed', 'trappings', 'society', 'know', 'lost', 'primitivism', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'Peru', '50', 'Walking', 'alone', 'jungle', 'Schneebaum', 'simply', 'fell', 'headhunting', 'tribe', 'called', 'Amarekaire', 'lived', 'did', 'year', 'involved', 'cannibalism', 'participating', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'multiple', 'homosexual', 'encounters', 'suited', 'nicely', 'was', 'already', 'out', 'Indeed', 'must', 'be', 'observed', 'Mr.', 'Schneebaum', 'instinct', 'finding', 'primitive', 'cultures', 'actively', 'practice', 'homosexuality', 'unswerving', 'Returning', 'home', 'Schneebaum', 'became', 'something', 'minor', 'celebrity', 'see', 'clips', 'telling', 'mind-boggling', 'tale', 'talk', 'shows', 'college', 'campuses', 'cruise', 'ships', 'Not', 'content', 'one', 'such', 'experience', 'repeated', 'feat', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'where', 'lived', 'Asmat', 'headhunting', 'tribe', 'who', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'practice', 'rather', 'enthusiastic', 'form', 'multiple-partner', 'homosexuality', 'addition', 'participating', 'heterosexuality', 'purposes', 'procreation', 'Schneebaum', 'survived', 'surreal', 'escapades', 'stunning', 'great', 'story', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Keep', 'River', 'Right', 'just', 'dreadful', 'central', 'problem', 'various', 'inadequacies', 'directors', 'David', 'Laurie', 'Shapiro', 'man', 'Tobias', 'Schneebaum', 'Schneebaum', 'camera', 'lot', 'are', 'subjected', 'lugubrious', 'plodding', 'thoroughly', 'insipid', 'delivery', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'secretly', 'wish', 'cannibals', 'had', 'put', 'menu', 'Schneebaum', 'ability', 'blend', 'headhunting', 'tribes', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'foreign', 'own', 'culture', 'came', 'about', 'result', 'absolute', 'lack', 'personality', 'character', 'will', 'something', 'disturbing', 'even', 'creepy', 'Schneebaum', 'passivity', 'able', 'watch', 'Amarekaire', 'headhunters', 'slaughter', 'rival', 'tribe', 'participate', 'event', 'what', 'did', 'Schneebaum', 'adventures', 'may', 'thrill', 'Schneebaum', 'not', 'picture', 'aging', 'Schneebaum', '78', 'when', 'meet', 'film', 'centerpiece', 'adventures', 'are', 'useless', 'anthropological', 'standpoint', 'totally', 'ignored', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Grizzly', 'Man', 'way', 'Timothy', 'Treadwell', 'put', 'bears', 'danger', 'risking', 'own', 'life', 'redeem', 'film', 'nice', 'location', 'footage', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Peru', 'Sadly', 'Keep', 'River', 'Right', 'fails', 'here', 'too', 'Instead', 'giving', 'viewers', 'sense', 'what', 'otherworldly', 'experiences', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'felt', 'see', 'ragged', 'remnants', 'Watching', 'toothless', 'retired', 'headhunter', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'T-shirt', 'Bermuda', 'flip', 'flops', 'watching', 'Love', 'Lucy', 're-runs', 'piped', 'satellite', 'dish', 'may', 'tell', 'lot', 'how', 'totally', 'insane', 'world', 'nothing', 'Mr.', 'Schneebaum', 'greatest', 'value', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'newfound', 'respect', 'screenwriters', 'actors', 'cinematographers', 'actual', 'directors', 'hands', 'professionals', 'astounding', 'truth', 'Tobias', 'Schneebaum', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'instead', 'dreary', 'facts']",N/A

Tobias Schneebaum,recently ""out"" of the closet,decides to go into the wilderness. He blends in with their ways, even when it means participating in tribal warfare and eating human flesh. Among the Asmat,bisexual relations are common, but Tobias prefers the company of men,and finds a boyfriend when going native.""Keep the River On Your Right"" is a fascinating character study. Schneebaum romanticizes non-Western culture to the point he's okay with cannibalism. He is alienated from the West,so for him all non-Western cultures are good by default. His multiculturalism blinds him to things that are objectively wrong.Some might draw parallels between Tobias' gayness and cannibalism.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 2]","This interesting if somewhat aimless and meandering documentary takes us into the life of Tobias Schneebaum, an openly gay artist, anthropologist, and author who spent a year in his early career with a tribe of cannabalistic Peruvian natives. Now well into his 70's, Mr. Schneebaum is convinced by a group of independent filmmakers to return to the jungle and see if anything of this once interesting tribe still exists.Juxtaposed alongside this story is the life of Mr. Schneebaum, showing his family, his art, and his brief shot into the Hollywood spotlight after the news of his tasting of human flesh comes out.Some of the filming of this documentary is startling. Seeing Peruvian ruins and the amazing rainforests were certainly spectacles to be reckoned with. But the off-beat glimpses into cannibalism were so short and unengaging that I felt the title of the film to be misleading (""Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale"").

711811,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00006CXH4,Chris Luallen,"[2, 2]","Tobias Schneebaum was a talented young painter whose life was transforned when he went to Peru on a Fulbright scholarship in 1955. Tobias ended up visiting a Catholic mission in the Amazon and from there began a jungle trek to find the cannibalistic Harakambuts. Tobias lived with the tribe for 7 months and even went with them on a violent raid of an enemy tribe where he observed people being killed in warfare. He also participated in a Harakambut ritual which involved the eating of human flesh. Upon his return to the modern world Tobias found himself unable to paint but he continued to follow his interest in primal societies, also spending substanial time with the Asmat tribe of New Guinea.This documentary recounts Tobias' previous experiences while also taking him back to Peru and New Guinea to visit the tribal societies he had once lived with. The movie also juxtaposes Tobias' life in Manhattan with the life and culture of the tribes. For example, an Indonesian circumsison ritual is depicted as is Tobias' attending of a family celebration on a Jewish holiday. I especially loved the part which showed a New Guinea man, in full tribal regalia, attending an auction to sell tribal art to New York collectors. Tobias translated that the man was enjoying his trip because he liked the culture of New York. Talk about being a ""stranger in a strange world"" - just amazing!. Still the point seemed to be that the the core qualities we share as fellow human beings are so much stronger and deeply rooted than the superfical differences that separate us.But really this doc is less an in-depth anthropological study than a celebration of the incredible life of Tobias Schneebaum. Though he gave up painting, Tobias continued throughout his life to exemplify the attitude and perspective of an artist, as he searched endlessly for the  type of life force and vitality that he experienced most intensely while livng with the Harakambut and Asmat peoples. I found him to be a fascinating, even heroic, character and hope that other people are able to enjoy the same level of pleasure and insight that I did with this great documentary.",5,Extraordinary Life Experiences Of A Brillant Artist,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,2141,"['Tobias', 'Schneebaum', 'was', 'talented', 'young', 'painter', 'life', 'was', 'transforned', 'when', 'went', 'Peru', 'Fulbright', 'scholarship', '1955', 'Tobias', 'ended', 'up', 'visiting', 'Catholic', 'mission', 'Amazon', 'began', 'jungle', 'trek', 'find', 'cannibalistic', 'Harakambuts', 'Tobias', 'lived', 'tribe', '7', 'months', 'even', 'went', 'violent', 'raid', 'enemy', 'tribe', 'where', 'observed', 'people', 'being', 'killed', 'warfare', 'also', 'participated', 'Harakambut', 'ritual', 'involved', 'eating', 'human', 'flesh', 'return', 'modern', 'world', 'Tobias', 'found', 'unable', 'paint', 'continued', 'follow', 'interest', 'primal', 'societies', 'also', 'spending', 'substanial', 'time', 'Asmat', 'tribe', 'New', 'Guinea.This', 'documentary', 'recounts', 'Tobias', 'previous', 'experiences', 'also', 'taking', 'back', 'Peru', 'New', 'Guinea', 'visit', 'tribal', 'societies', 'had', 'once', 'lived', 'movie', 'also', 'Tobias', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'life', 'culture', 'tribes', 'example', 'Indonesian', 'circumsison', 'ritual', 'depicted', 'Tobias', 'attending', 'family', 'celebration', 'Jewish', 'holiday', 'especially', 'loved', 'part', 'showed', 'New', 'Guinea', 'man', 'full', 'tribal', 'regalia', 'attending', 'auction', 'sell', 'tribal', 'art', 'New', 'York', 'collectors', 'Tobias', 'translated', 'man', 'was', 'enjoying', 'trip', 'liked', 'culture', 'New', 'York', 'Talk', 'being', 'stranger', 'strange', 'world', 'just', 'amazing', 'Still', 'point', 'seemed', 'be', 'core', 'share', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'stronger', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'superfical', 'differences', 'separate', 'us.But', 'really', 'doc', 'less', 'in-depth', 'anthropological', 'study', 'celebration', 'incredible', 'life', 'Tobias', 'Schneebaum', 'gave', 'up', 'painting', 'Tobias', 'continued', 'life', 'exemplify', 'attitude', 'perspective', 'artist', 'searched', 'endlessly', 'type', 'life', 'force', 'vitality', 'experienced', 'most', 'intensely', 'livng', 'Harakambut', 'Asmat', 'peoples', 'found', 'be', 'fascinating', 'even', 'heroic', 'character', 'hope', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'enjoy', 'same', 'level', 'pleasure', 'insight', 'did', 'great', 'documentary']",N/A

711815,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00006CXH4,Linda Linguvic,"[31, 41]","Originally released as &quot;Once I was a Cannibal&quot;, this is a documentary about Tobias Scheenbaum, a 78 year old gay man, who traveled to New Guinea and Peru in the fifties and has some weird and wild tales to tell.  Mr. Scheenbaum lives in Manhattan, gives lectures about his travels at museums and tourist ships and has written several books about his experiences.  Now, filmmakers David and Laurie Shapiro have created this film which has won several awards among independent filmmakers.  They travel back to New Guinea and Peru with him and the audience sees that many of the people of these regions remember Mr. Scheenbaum with affection.  One of the New Guinea men used to be his lover. Then, they travel back to Peru, where Mr. Scheenbaum recalls going on a hunt with the tribesmen that resulted in murder and cannibalism.  And, yes, he did sample a bit of human flesh.Mr. Scheenbaum is articulate and witty and a good storyteller.  He's speaks openly about his homosexuality and there is a lot of introspection about his experience of cannibalism.  He's written several books on the subject and we see film clips from excerpts from talk shows he's been on through the years.  While I found the movie interesting, I had a big problem with it.  It's all about Mr. Scheenbaum.  It's not about the people of New Guinea or Peru.  I guess I was hoping for an anthropological film.  I wanted to know more about the tribe in New Guinea than the fact that Mr. Scheenbaum had male lovers.  I wanted to know what the meaning of cannibalism had in the rituals of the people of Peru.  I wanted to know about both these tribes' religious customs, marriage rituals, burial practices, etc.  In short, I wanted to take my own trip into the rainforest and learn about the way of these people.Alas, this was not to happen.  This was a film about Tobias Scheenbaum and his own filters through which he viewed his experiences.  It's all about him, not the people he came in contact with.  And that, to me was the weakness of the film.  I just wish that some filmmakers would want to do a film about the fast-disappearing non-literate cultures of the world without making it a celebration to the enlightening experiences of an American.  There's stuff out there about the real people in New Guinea and Peru that is indeed worthwhile to film. This is a not a bad film for what it is.  There's nice film footage of New Guinea and the rainforest.  The documentary techniques are professional. And the viewer comes away with some insights into the persona of Tobias Scheenbaum.

711817,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00006CXH4,mirasreviews,"[16, 18]","In 1955, Manhattan artist Tobias Schneebaum traveled to Peru on a Fulbright scholarship. He visited a remote Dominican mission, where he allowed curiosity about the local tribespeople to lure him into the jungle. He spent seven months in the jungle with the Amarekaire people (now called Harakambut), who were cannibals, and was presumed dead. But he emerged from the jungle no longer interested in an artist's career, deciding to pursue anthropology instead. In 1969, he wrote a book, &quot;Keep the River on Your Right&quot;, about his experiences in the Amazon jungle. Schneebaum went on to live among the headhunting Asmat of New Guinea, as well. The extraordinary thing is that these cultures accepted him. This film tells the story of Tobias Schneebaum's unusual adventures in his own words and takes him back to Peru, at the age of 78, to find the tribespeople whom he had not seen in 45 years.It's difficult to know how to rate this film, because it is a poorly crafted film about an interesting subject. The film's nonsensical organization obstructs most of the narrative. Its camera work leaves something to be desired. &quot;Keep the River on Your Right&quot; starts out in the present, then flashes back to some point in the recent past when Schneebaum visited the Asmat people in New Guinea, with whom he had lived in the 1970s. Then we learn about his life as an artist in New York. Then about his childhood. At the film's halfway point, we still have no idea where his infamous Peruvian adventure, from which the film takes its name, fits in or how Schneebaum came to be such a dogged adventurer. The second half is better. Schneebaum returns to Peru at the filmmakers' urging to recount his experience of 45 years before and to search for any Amarekaire who might remember him. Returning to scenes of past trauma, film crew in tow, has somehow become fashionable among documentary filmmakers. Tobias Schneebaum is a mild-mannered man who is afraid of dead mice but fearless among cannibals and headhunters who were strangers to him. His story is interesting, even if &quot;Keep the River on Your Right&quot; makes it difficult to follow.The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes, a photo gallery, sketches by Tobias Schneebaum, a &quot;Jungle Journey&quot; book excerpt, a Tobias Schneebaum biography, and a bio of the filmmakers. There are 9 deleted scenes, most of which are not actually new scenes, but slightly more footage of scenes that were in the movie. They're not worth watching. The Photo Gallery features 10 photographs, some of which are of Schneebaum in his youth before he went to Peru. &quot;Jungle Journey&quot; is a children's book written in 1959 by Mary Britton Miller, inspired by Schneebaum's jungle experience, which he illustrated.

I thought I would learn of his original adventure, I thought I would get insights into the extraordinary people of the amazon with footage of the mountains and the rain forest.  Scheenbaum walked past Machu Pichu to get to the headwaters of the Amazon(he walked from the wrong side obviously not through Brazil).  But we dont see this in the film.  Lets talk about what we do see:The film opens with elderly Scheenbaum talking to a class at a museum.  Then it talks a little about his book that turned the world's attention to him.  Then we follow him to east Asia where he speaks on a cruise about cannibals in east Asia.A terrible film, an awful documentary.  Inexcusable this film!  How could the directors get away with having a movie that says it will tell the sotry of this odd dimented individual and yet tells no story at all.  A total farce! We see NOTHING of the amazon, yet the film bills itself as Scheenbaum's return to the people he orignally 'went native' with.Much emphasis is made of the fact that Scheenbaum is gay and that he found gay natives where ever he went.  This is an interesting side note but the film emphasized this aspect to much.  Who cares that he was homosexual?  I was interested in the cannabalism.  The film bills itself as a story of 'modern day cannabalism' yet their is no story and we learn NOTHING of this.  We only learn about Scheenbaum's boring eveyrday life and his homoerotic(or so he thinkgs) escapades with natives in east Asia.A TERRRIBLE BILKING OF THE AUDIENCE, watch this film with no expectation to see anything on the cover or any of the description on the back and then you might be happy.Seth J.

And reducing him to the gay, feminine, non aggressive catagory,as being the only way he could be accepted into the tribe is just pure horse sh**. It only brings about the pure ignorance of what most people think 'gay' is...If  Schneebaum wanted to prove that to be left to their natural inklings a tribe would run the gambit of sexual desires and he participated in the homosexual rite's does not mean that  homosexuality was not there... and the most the other anthropologist's could come up with was; ""he didn't keep a therapeutic distance"" from the people he was studying.It was in the Amazon Valley that something happened to Tobias, was it the raid on the other village and the killing of that tribe, or was it the eating of human flesh, had he almost gone over the brink. He was a painter until that experience and after, he never painted again. As far as the cannibal part, and why he did it, who knows as Tobias cannot come up with a logical answer, and as far as judging him for doing it, one must face his own demons in a situation that brought him to the brink. Had he gone to far,did the jungle cast him out?It is a strange movie, but, although the subject matter is off the scale, it was entertaining. And one must give Tobias a nod for having the fortitude to go back and face his demons, and stare them down.
