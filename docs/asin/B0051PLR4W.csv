1437165,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B0051PLR4W,ajsteele,"[3, 4]","Wrecked opens with a man trapped in a car and his predicament seemingly never ends until he frustratingly frees himself from the vehicle. You now watch him crawl through the woods as dream sequences make the viewer question if anything interesting will happen. A dog shows up but we never know if he is real. I don't want to be a spoiler (if that is actually possible with this film)so I will only say that the bits and pieces we were given as to his dilemma finally become one longer dream sequence that suddenly explains it all.Wrecked is just that, wrecked. Adrian Brody is a good actor but not so much that one wants to stare almost endlessly at his face. The film relies on long maddening camera shots that produce nothing of interest. Brody trapped in the car at the beginning goes on so long that some may actually bail out of the movie. If a film relies on basically one character, it is helpful if you can find something about him you like to root for his survival. Brody is unlikeable throughout, and the fact that we may believe he is a ruthless criminal doesn't help.What keeps you watching is the question of what it's all about. I don't believe this film reached the theatres for a reason, few can sit through it's laborious acts. Human survival is the lure and it's portrayal flops. Brody looks like he could have gotten pnemonia playing this part and all for an empty film....and a paycheck. You may never know if the filmmakers thought they had something here or if they simply wanted to create a low budget direct to Red Box profit generator.

I must say I had no trouble at all staying engaged with it. The character is likable, and the setting is perfect for the storyline. The makeup job they did on Adrien was incredibly accurate, and his performance was quite convincing. I thought the cinematography was effective, as it provided the proper angles to capture the moment, as well as enhance the mood of the scene. It was a well balanced plot, full of questions and intrigue. This movie is not for people who prefer a rapid pace and special effects to keep them interested. This is more for the folks who like a cerebral film. There was only one thing I would have changed about the ending, but it really wasn't big enough to ruin anything, and I still found the ending to be a satisfying conclusion to the tale.

1437175,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0051PLR4W,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","Wrecked is basically a one-man show, and I must say Adrien Brody turned in a terrific performance as that one man (he does his own stunts, actually eats a worm, and even supplies the voice his character hears on the radio).  Some say the movie is slow and perhaps confusing at times, but I say nay; you couldn't possibly convey the physical ordeal - nor the emotional roller coaster -this character endures in a mere half hour, nor would the ending be as effective as it most certainly is.  I was prepared to say I really liked this movie as it moved toward its conclusion, and then the ending turned my like into love.  It does require some patience on the part of the viewer, but Wrecked is a really, really good movie.Brody's character wakes up to the grim reality of being trapped in a car deep within a ravine.  He looks like he went ten rounds with Muhammad Ali, and his badly injured leg is trapped underneath the dashboard.  Looking around, he finds an empty driver's seat, a dead man in the back seat, and another body a short distance away from the car.  He doesn't know who he is or how he got there - but it's obvious that he was in one hell of a crash.  Whatever road the car was on isn't even in sight.  If he's going to survive, he has to free himself from the wreckage and somehow find help in the most isolated and dangerous of woodland situations.  As the days and nights progress, he begins having short flashbacks about his past and finds other clues to his identity, the meaning of which is further sharpened by periodic hallucinations.  If the plot sounds pretty basic, it is - but it is by no means simple.  You'll just have to take my word on that.I found this to be a rather gripping emotional story, thanks largely to Brody's marvelous performance (as well as some fine work from a wonderful canine actor).  There are even some tender moments thrown into the mix with all of the fury and seeming futility of his character's struggles.  You the viewer join the character in trying to piece together his identity, and that great unknown creates emotional friction because you aren't completely sure you should be rooting for his ultimate survival.  As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing slow, simplistic, or boring about this film at all.  I loved it.",5,Simplistic and boring?

Sitting in the back seat is a corpse, and another one lies in the forest about twenty feet from the car.  (You know this much by reading the movie's own description.) The next *20 minutes* of the movie are spent on watching Man wondering where the hell he is, trying to extricate himself from the car (his leg is pinned), cursing at his situation, and just looking around. Watching water evaporate is more engaging.""Man"" finally manages to free himself from the car, and the next *60 minutes* (yes, one whole hour) is spent doing little more than watching him crawl around the forest.  (His leg is wounded from the accident and he can't walk.) Man is in the forest for (if I counted correctly) five full days, and with the exception of rain water that he drinks on day two, we see him eat almost nothing, and opportunities for water are few and far between.  Yet in spite of the severe lack of sustenance and hydration, Man is still able have the strength to do all that crawling around.  And this is to say nothing of his leg wound, which by now surely would have become infected and caused him even greater difficulty.He comes upon a dead man in a cave of sorts, and the viewer is left utterly clueless as to who he is and how he met his fate.  He periodically encounters a woman who, as it turns out, is just a hallucination, but when you find out who the woman actually is (at the very end of the movie), you are left completely baffled as to why she says the things she does to Man and why she is portrayed the way she is.  There are also a few flashbacks that are not really flashbacks which do little more than to further confound the viewer's understanding of what the actual events are that led to Man's predicament.  Only at the very end of the movie are those events revealed, and then the movie ends abruptly.My daughter, who watched the movie with me, and I sat for a few moments in silence at the movie's end.  We were pondering if the movie really did end the way it did (or were we, too, hallucinating?), and we were also left momentarily speechless that the whole affair was so bad.In all fairness, Brody's acting was good, and he does succeed in generating a level of pathos with the viewer.  However, given the other considerations surrounding his performance (i.e., the plot, the monotony, etc.), it's hard to recommend this movie.  Were it not for Brody's acting, I would have certainly given this movie one star.Save yourself the money and the 91 minutes of your life and skip this one.",2,A waste of 91 minutes of my time.,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,2905,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible', 'movie', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'Haywire', 'see', 'review', 'Wrecked', 'Haywire', 'rented', 'movie', 'Red', 'Box', 'rental', 'machine', '1.28', 'feel', 'was', 'robbed.The', 'movie', 'Brody', 'character', 'listed', 'end', 'simply', 'Man', 'regaining', 'consciousness', 'wrecked', 'car', 'sitting', 'middle', 'woods', 'Sitting', 'back', 'seat', 'corpse', 'one', 'forest', 'twenty', 'feet', 'car', 'know', 'much', 'reading', 'movie', 'own', 'description', 'next', '*20', 'minutes*', 'movie', 'are', 'spent', 'watching', 'Man', 'wondering', 'where', 'hell', 'trying', 'extricate', 'car', 'leg', 'pinned', 'cursing', 'situation', 'just', 'looking', 'around', 'Watching', 'water', 'evaporate', 'more', 'engaging', 'Man', 'finally', 'free', 'car', 'next', '*60', 'minutes*', 'yes', 'one', 'whole', 'hour', 'spent', 'doing', 'little', 'more', 'watching', 'crawl', 'forest', 'leg', 'wounded', 'accident', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'Man', 'forest', 'counted', 'correctly', 'five', 'full', 'days', 'exception', 'rain', 'water', 'day', 'two', 'see', 'eat', 'almost', 'nothing', 'opportunities', 'water', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'spite', 'severe', 'lack', 'sustenance', 'hydration', 'Man', 'still', 'able', 'have', 'strength', 'do', 'crawling', 'around', 'say', 'nothing', 'leg', 'wound', 'now', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'infected', 'caused', 'even', 'greater', 'difficulty.He', 'dead', 'man', 'cave', 'sorts', 'viewer', 'left', 'utterly', 'clueless', 'who', 'how', 'met', 'fate', 'periodically', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'just', 'hallucination', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'woman', 'actually', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'completely', 'baffled', 'why', 'things', 'Man', 'why', 'portrayed', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'flashbacks', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'further', 'confound', 'viewer', 'understanding', 'what', 'actual', 'events', 'are', 'led', 'Man', 'predicament', 'Only', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'events', 'revealed', 'then', 'movie', 'abruptly.My', 'daughter', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'sat', 'few', 'moments', 'silence', 'movie', 'end', 'were', 'pondering', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'end', 'way', 'did', 'were', 'too', 'hallucinating', 'were', 'also', 'left', 'momentarily', 'speechless', 'whole', 'affair', 'was', 'so', 'bad.In', 'fairness', 'Brody', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'succeed', 'generating', 'level', 'pathos', 'viewer', 'However', 'given', 'other', 'considerations', 'surrounding', 'performance', 'i.e.', 'plot', 'monotony', 'etc', 'hard', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Were', 'not', 'Brody', 'acting', 'would', 'have', 'certainly', 'given', 'movie', 'one', 'star.Save', 'money', '91', 'minutes', 'life', 'skip', 'one']",Wrecked

1437187,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B0051PLR4W,MadMacs,"[11, 15]","Reboots are a double-edged sword.On one edge is the depressing realization that Hollywood has genuinely run out of ideas. Using their business model, they've completely crushed all original thought and ingenuity from within. When 'Swimming With Sharks' came out, I was amused at what I believed to be satire. Turns out it was a documentary in disguise. I really shouldn't be surprised, not really. The so-called progressive herd mentality that exists there today in 2011 tends to foster the worst types of misguided hardcore entrenched mindsets, not the least of which results in dead creativity.On the other edge is that they're quite adept at taking an older product and spiffying up with a bit of modern polish and adding a sharper tack. Taking something old-n-rusty and making it look and feel new again is a genuine talent, and it's one I appreciate, even if it's essentially parasitic.Such is the case with 'Wrecked' - an engaging reboot of the classic 1953 movie 'Inferno' starring Robert Ryan. I tried to locate an Amazon Product Link, unfortunately it has yet to find a commercial release, so you'll have to take my word that this production is indeed a reboot.So what happens when you awake trapped in terrible car wreck - and you have absolutely no clue how or why you're there? Bloody, injured, dead bodies laying around, and apparently you're the only survivor. It's a clever twist on the original screenplay. And adding traumatic amnesia adds a dramatic flair, as Brody's character has to struggle with the loss of his very identity in an effort to understand his predicament.Like the original, this film tells the story of a man who has to survive in the desolate wilderness with a severe injury and no hope of rescue. Your only chance is what you yourself bring to the table; what resources, knowledge and internal strength that you carry within.Interestingly, the filmmakers removed treacherous would-be-killers and replaced them with the unknowns of nature. Truth be told, I'd rather face the killers. Natural predators are infinitely more terrifying than some thug. With a murderer you're dealing with humanity; certainly it's not the best of humanity, but at least rage, jealousy, fear or envy are emotions and rationalizations one can understand. Even a paid assassin has professionalism as a justification. But when you're facing a natural threat, it's just following what's in its nature, which I find so much more coldly threatening. The axiom 'nothing personal' takes on a truly grim and terrifying visage.An excellent film and one, like the character himself, you need to endure to receive the reward of revelatory knowledge.Personal Note: Adrien Brody has, in my mind, supplanted Daniel Day Lewis and Gary Oldman as the chameleon actor of choice. Deservedly so, his range is truly amazing. His performances border on a word I avoid like the plague - magical. But bleep me, that's the word that fits. I will never forget his work as a mentally retarded young man in 'The Village' or as one of the funny dysfunctional brothers in 'The Darjeeling Limited'. Despite the familiar contours and shape, I'm always amazed to discover what new face I'm watching.

However, his performance alone just doesn't supply enough of a reason to spend time on this film.""Wrecked"" doesn't provide the kind of catharsis that some other films, showing lone individuals struggling against wilderness odds, have provided. I'm thinking of such superior movies as ""Inferno"" starring Robert Ryan.Nor does Brody show the resourcefulness that would keep us engaged, learning survival skills along the way. Brody's character doesn't exercise much ingenuity in coping. So we aren't left with any sense of triumphing against daunting odds.  There's no celebration of survival, in the way movies such as ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" inspire. The viewer of ""Wrecked"" won't feel infused with gratitude for being alive after heroic struggle.Most of the interest of this story rests in Brody's flashbacks as he tries to piece together who he is and how he ended up in a crashed car in the middle of the woods.

1437200,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0051PLR4W,trebe,"[0, 1]","Wrecked (2010) features a man (Adrien Brody) who recovers consciousness in a car that has crashed in a wooded area, and finds himself trapped inside, with only a hazy recollection of how he may have arrived there.  As events unfold, some things become clearer, as the man who has no name, regains some memory.  He also hallucinates however, so you can't always believe what you see.Awaking in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that has crashed, the man finds that his head is bleeding and his legs wedged in under the dashboard.  Through the partially broken windshield, the body of another man lying in the woods is visible, and there is also a dead man in the back seat.  Searching the car, the man finds a revolver, and later imagines that he has been discovered by a woman (Caroline Dhavernas).Eventually, the man is able to force his way out of the vehicle, and splint his apparently fractured leg.  He finds bags stuffed with cash in the trunk, and also makes friends with a large dog.  After recovering enough to travel, he crawls off into the woods to try and find help.  You would assume that a road is nearby above where the car rests, but the man heads in a different direction.  In another questionable move, he attempts to cross a river, and is swept away, coming ashore far downstream.Featuring a nice mix of adventure, mystery, and fantasy, Wrecked is very slow burn that manages to be a mostly interesting watch, while manipulating its audience.  In an intriguing role, where he is in front of the camera for nearly the entire movie, Adrien Broady comes off as fairly credible.  The presence of the dog provides a reason for the man to speak, so he doesn't appear as someone who habitually talks to himself.  You soon come not to trust everything you see, as the fantasy segments keep you off balance, and certain developments, like the appearances of a hungry cougar, and the discovery various objects including a cell phone and several corpses, push the limits of believability.While perhaps not a movie that you will want to revisit often, Wrecked is still worth a watch, for Adrien Brody's semi-edgy performance.

1437201,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0051PLR4W,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","In ""Wrecked"" Adrien Brody plays an unnamed man, who finds himself trapped inside a mangled car, left alone in a ravine. Because of the shock, it seems, the man, injured and covered in blood, remembers nothing about what happened, or even his name. I must quickly add that you shouldn't expect a ""thriller,"" however, at least in a conventional sense. The film's tone is more like that of an experimental indie film like Gus Van Sant's ""Gerry"" without dialogues.Yes, the film opens somewhat like ""Buried,"" but I find it hard to pinpoint what genre ""Wrecked"" falls into. The film's pace is very slow as a thriller. Some may compare this with Jack London stories, but he is a gifted storyteller, which the film is simply not. Apparently Brody's character sees ""things"" - I refuse to reveal what they are - whether or not they are products of his hallucinations, I frankly don't know. To me they all just look random and pointless.Director Michael Greenspan (his feature debut) goes for realism, taking extremely long time to show the situation under which Adrien Brody's character has to suffer (including a Tiny Tim rendition of ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips""), but relies too much on the actor's skills (which are considerable, I admit) and the deserted atmosphere of the wilderness. As a result, despite some realistic descriptions of the protagonist's struggles for survival, and one Buster Keaton-like incredible stunt (done by the star himself), to me watching ""Wrecked"" was a very tedious experience.Sit through the film with patience and you will know that everything (well, almost everything) fits in the right place with its rather flat ending.
