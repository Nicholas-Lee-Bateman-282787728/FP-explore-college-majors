COLD COMES the NIGHT is grimly riveting and constantly leaves you wondering what will happen next. Some layers, twists, and reversals, but it's still very easy to follow and, therefore, may be a little too episodic and simple for some tastes.CCN has a minimalistic low-budget appeal to it. We don't know a whole lot about the various players in the smaller town Mid-Atlantic setting. Nevertheless, it shows us all we really need to know. Violent, disturbing, but without cheap schlocky gore. I kept thinking, ""This is how real murders must look and, especially, sound."" Alice Eve gives a plain yet memorable performance as Chloe, a tough but compassionate single mother who manages a sleazy motel where all the trouble starts. The other actors do likewise in their roles. The script and cinematography are similarly real. Nice ending. Good, fitting soundtrack too.

McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[0, 0]","With the monster hit that was Breaking Bad, and the fame that Brian Cranston gained from the acclaimed hit television show that he wouldn't choice a mediocre B level thriller with a poorly meaningless named title like Cold Comes the Night as his first post-Breaking Bad film. It's not that Cold Comes the Night is a terrible film or even a bad one, but Cold Comes the Night is a poorly scripted film that is predictable, and is only remotely saved by its cast.The script is predictable in its mediocrity with Alice Eve playing Chloe a down on her luck single mother with a heart of gold running a small motel barely making ends meet, and reluctantly allowing prostitution and drugs to be operated in her motel as she is trying to get enough money find a new home, and keep social services from taking her daughter Sophia from her. Enter John a low level mob currier and Toba (Brian Cranston) the still deadly, but nearly blind and over the hill mob currier who are traveling across country with a package, and end up checking into Chloe's motel. After an incident leaving John dead the package that Toba and John were carrying goes missing and Toba turns to Chloe for help getting what belongs to him back.Everyone can see where things are going as the film is clearly predictable in what will happen. What keeps Cold Comes the Night from being a dismal B film are the performances by the stars. The beautiful Alice Eve gives on of her best acting performance as Chloe the struggling single mother who is struggling trying to take care of her daughter, and in Toba she sees a way out of the endless struggle of trying to keep her and Sophia clothed, fed, and with a roof over their heads. While not his best performance like Cranston has given in Argo and Breaking Bad, Brian Cranston still gives a gritty performance as the nearly blind over the hill mob currier who has nothing else in his life, but the job. His performance is even more remarkable by the fact he's always wearing sunglasses as Toba is trying to mask his blindness. Cranston gives the quiet soft spoken Toba life with his words, facial expressions, and mannerisms as Toba slowly softens his heart as he journeys with Chloe. Logan Marshall-Green also gives a deep performance as Billy the corrupt cop especially in the dark scene in his house with Toba, Chloe, and his wife, and in the climax which was gripping.The Cold Comes the Night certainly isn't going to blow anyone away with its predictable script along with its snail dragging first act, but Cold Comes the Night definitely isn't a bad thriller that is saved by wonderful performances by Brain Cranston, Alice Eve, and Logan Marshall-Green, and the final act that is engrossing and riveting that gives fire and life to this otherwise poorly done thriller. Cold Night the Night might not have been Cranston's best post Breaking Bad film, but the film was still decent, and will hold fans of the actor over until this summer's Godzilla.",3,"While Cold Comes the Night doesn't hold up to other thrillers like Collateral, and Dead Man Down with its poorly writen and pred",1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,2962,"['monster', 'hit', 'was', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'fame', 'Brian', 'Cranston', 'gained', 'acclaimed', 'hit', 'television', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'choice', 'mediocre', 'B', 'level', 'thriller', 'poorly', 'meaningless', 'named', 'title', 'Cold', 'Comes', 'Night', 'first', 'post-Breaking', 'Bad', 'film', 'not', 'Cold', 'Comes', 'Night', 'terrible', 'film', 'even', 'bad', 'one', 'Cold', 'Comes', 'Night', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'film', 'predictable', 'only', 'remotely', 'saved', 'cast.The', 'script', 'predictable', 'mediocrity', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'playing', 'Chloe', 'down', 'luck', 'single', 'mother', 'heart', 'gold', 'running', 'small', 'motel', 'barely', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'reluctantly', 'allowing', 'prostitution', 'drugs', 'be', 'operated', 'motel', 'trying', 'get', 'enough', 'money', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'keep', 'social', 'services', 'taking', 'daughter', 'Sophia', 'Enter', 'John', 'low', 'level', 'mob', 'currier', 'Toba', 'Brian', 'Cranston', 'still', 'deadly', 'nearly', 'blind', 'hill', 'mob', 'currier', 'who', 'are', 'traveling', 'country', 'package', 'end', 'up', 'checking', 'Chloe', 'motel', 'incident', 'leaving', 'John', 'dead', 'package', 'Toba', 'John', 'were', 'carrying', 'missing', 'Toba', 'Chloe', 'help', 'getting', 'what', 'back.Everyone', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'film', 'clearly', 'predictable', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'What', 'Cold', 'Comes', 'Night', 'being', 'dismal', 'B', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'stars', 'beautiful', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'Chloe', 'struggling', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'struggling', 'trying', 'take', 'care', 'daughter', 'Toba', 'way', 'endless', 'struggle', 'trying', 'keep', 'Sophia', 'clothed', 'fed', 'roof', 'heads', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'Cranston', 'given', 'Argo', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Brian', 'Cranston', 'still', 'gritty', 'performance', 'nearly', 'blind', 'hill', 'mob', 'currier', 'who', 'nothing', 'else', 'life', 'job', 'performance', 'even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'fact', 'always', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'Toba', 'trying', 'mask', 'blindness', 'Cranston', 'quiet', 'soft', 'spoken', 'Toba', 'life', 'words', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'Toba', 'slowly', 'heart', 'Chloe', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'also', 'deep', 'performance', 'Billy', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'especially', 'dark', 'scene', 'house', 'Toba', 'Chloe', 'wife', 'climax', 'was', 'gripping.The', 'Cold', 'Comes', 'Night', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'going', 'blow', 'anyone', 'away', 'predictable', 'script', 'snail', 'dragging', 'first', 'act', 'Cold', 'Comes', 'Night', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thriller', 'saved', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Brain', 'Cranston', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'final', 'act', 'engrossing', 'riveting', 'fire', 'life', 'otherwise', 'poorly', 'done', 'thriller', 'Cold', 'Night', 'Night', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Cranston', 'best', 'post', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'decent', 'will', 'hold', 'fans', 'actor', 'summer', 'Godzilla']",Cold Comes the Night

Zwick,"[1, 2]","After flying high for five brilliant seasons on TV's ""Breaking Bad,"" Bryan Cranston lands with a thud on the big screen in ""Cold Comes the Night,"" a murky and undistinguished indie crime drama written by Tze Chun, Osgood Perkins and Nick Smith and directed by Chun. It's unclear what the overall purpose of the movie is; we just know that it's a ""serious"" work because nobody ever smiles and the sun never comes out.Chloe (Alice Eve) is a streetwise single mom who runs a motel where the local prostitutes and drug dealers regularly come to transact their business and sell their wares. Indeed, the locale is so questionable that child services is threatening to take Chloe`s daughter away from her if she doesn`t hightail her to a more appropriate place toot sweet. One of the motel's guests is a half blind hit man named Topo (Cranston) who finds himself stuck at the place after his assistant/nephew is involved in a double homicide and some important money goes missing. Topo suspects that Chloe may know the whereabouts of the loot, but the spunky Chloe figures she has little to lose in a high stakes gamble with fate. And thus the game is on...Eventually, so many bodies have piled up at Chloe's little roadside establishment that even the Bates Motel starts looking like a wiser lodging option for any weary traveler passing through the region.Cranston spends most of his time growling and scowling, while continually dropping his articles in a vain attempt at a Russian accent (although even that isn't done with any real consistency). It's a bit like Walter White (albeit with hair) playing at being Gus Fring - though with little of the complexity or charm of either of those two ""Breaking Bad"" characters.

This already makes viewers of the film enter their viewing experience with high expectations of what the movie should be like prior to even seeing the opening credits.  Fans of the hit AMC series will expect a violent, in control, aggressive, yet likable character portrayal from Cranston, and a story that is deep enough to reach down under the skin of audience and keep their focus throughout the duration of the feature length film.  Well, the movie does most of that.The film succeeds at doing several things quite well but falls short in other areas.  For example, the characters in the film are fairly likable, with perhaps a few exceptions where the character was not given the proper screen time or script to fully develop into a more in depth role.  However, the main characters presented in &#34;Cold Comes the Night&#34; are easy to relate to; the audience can feel either complete empathy for them or hatred for how sinister certain characters' actions are perceived.  The ability to either completely like or hate a particular character is a testament of the level of writing and acting depicted within &#34;Cold Comes the Night&#34;.However, just because the characters are likeable and portrayed in a high quality and dignified manner does not necessarily mean that the plot is without error.  The plot is rather basic and focuses simply around $100,000 that everyone simply wants their hands on at all costs.  People die from one scene to another, all as a result of the money being seen by yet another individual who has decided to try to take the money for him/herself.  The simplicity of this plot may deter a lot of would be viewers and may persuade them into disliking the film on that premise alone, however, I think the pros of &#34;Cold Comes the Night&#34; definitely outweigh the cons.In the end, &#34;Cold Comes the Night&#34; is an entertaining thriller with plenty of action and does a good job of keeping the audience guessing and on their toes.  The simplistic plot can be overlooked by the actors' skills and the end result is a decent action thriller with plenty of suspense and drama that warrants a rental at the very least.",4,Entertaining Thriller Despite Its Flaws,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,2310,"['34', 'Cold', 'Night', '34', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'depict', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'portrayal', 'Walter', 'White', '34', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '34', 'already', 'viewers', 'film', 'enter', 'viewing', 'experience', 'high', 'expectations', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'prior', 'even', 'seeing', 'opening', 'credits', 'Fans', 'hit', 'AMC', 'series', 'will', 'expect', 'violent', 'control', 'aggressive', 'yet', 'likable', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Cranston', 'story', 'deep', 'enough', 'reach', 'down', 'skin', 'audience', 'keep', 'focus', 'duration', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'Well', 'movie', 'most', 'that.The', 'film', 'doing', 'several', 'things', 'quite', 'well', 'short', 'other', 'areas', 'example', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'fairly', 'likable', 'perhaps', 'few', 'exceptions', 'where', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'proper', 'screen', 'time', 'script', 'fully', 'develop', 'more', 'depth', 'role', 'However', 'main', 'characters', 'presented', '34', 'Cold', 'Night', '34', 'are', 'easy', 'relate', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'either', 'complete', 'empathy', 'hatred', 'how', 'sinister', 'certain', 'characters', 'actions', 'are', 'perceived', 'ability', 'completely', 'hate', 'particular', 'character', 'testament', 'level', 'writing', 'acting', 'depicted', '34', 'Cold', 'Night', '34', '.However', 'just', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'portrayed', 'high', 'quality', 'dignified', 'manner', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'plot', 'error', 'plot', 'rather', 'basic', 'simply', '100,000', 'everyone', 'simply', 'hands', 'costs', 'People', 'die', 'one', 'scene', 'all', 'result', 'money', 'being', 'seen', 'yet', 'individual', 'who', 'decided', 'try', 'take', 'money', 'him/herself', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'may', 'deter', 'lot', 'would', 'be', 'viewers', 'may', 'persuade', 'disliking', 'film', 'premise', 'alone', 'however', 'think', 'pros', '34', 'Cold', 'Night', '34', 'definitely', 'outweigh', 'cons.In', 'end', '34', 'Cold', 'Night', '34', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'plenty', 'action', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'audience', 'guessing', 'toes', 'simplistic', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'actors', 'skills', 'end', 'result', 'decent', 'action', 'thriller', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'drama', 'warrants', 'rental', 'very', 'least']",Cold Comes the Night

Alice Eve is believable as a woman who will do anything to save her daughter. Cranston tries his best to be a creepy tough guy but comes off as being flat. This is a movie that had potential but again became another generic &#34;let's get my money or else&#34; movie. Overall, not horrible but the movies Cash and Pressed were much better. I give this a B-.",3,"Had potential but became a generic ""let's get my money or else"" movie.
