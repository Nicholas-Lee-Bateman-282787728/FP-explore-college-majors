Trying to watch it as a stand alone movie would not be practical, as the first episodes of the series contain all the character development, and develope the story. The negative reviews sadly did just this, watching only the movie. What they did was open a book half way through it, then complain the characters weren't developed and you know nothing about the story. The movies end without explaining because it was already explained, and there is another movie coming out to tie up the loose ends in this one. Please, do not pick up the movie believing you can watch it without watching the series. If you loved the series, you will love the movie. It picks up where it left off and moves on, and the end (just like the series) leaves you wanting more. Luckily, the next movie is coming soon.

""Paradise Lost"" will be the last part of the series. I liked the TV series, it had a very unique premise and was gorgeous looking. The movie still looks fantastic, but it feels like it's treading water until it can reach it's conclusion in the next movie.The movie picks up six months after the end of the TV series with Saki in New York looking for Takizawa. There's very little to say without resorting to spoilers. Will Saki find Taki? Will Taki return to Japan? Were you born yesterday?Nothing happens. Or it feels like nothing happens.The TV series felt like a long movie. Ironically, the movie feels like a long episode. Again, the plot is so thin, I can't say anything without it being a spoiler.The problem with series like these is that it can feel like ""in for a penny, in for a pound."" You already got the series, you're going to talk yourself into spending money on the movies. But, if you're one of those people that HASN'T bought the TV series, and you're waiting to see if the whole series is worth owning, this movie doesn't automatically put ""Eden of the East"" into the ""must buy"" pile. Unless ""Paradise Lost"" caps the series off with something great, I think Eden is going to be a middling ""maybe"" show.Lastly, I have to complain about the packaging. This is a Blu-Ray, but it comes in a DVD box. So, when I stand this next to the TV series, they don't match. There's currently no option to get this in a blu-ray box.

1407547,AKH54WVWXATR4,B004GZZGW2,Jake Taylor,"[1, 1]","I decided to buy and look into this anime (and its two feature-length movie continuations) for two reasons: one, the animation looked gorgeous, and two, the plot sounded very intriguing and original. While I can say that it did fulfill both of those expectations, it didn't quite reach the heights it seemed like it could have.I won't spoil anything here and I won't bother giving a plot synopsis because you can read it on here already; what I will say is that the mysteries are all enticing at first, but like so many mysteries, the answers don't live up to the questions. After learning the truth behind the plot, I was excited for where the show could go with it, but it... didn't, really.The plot sort of fumbles along without really taking advantage of the tools it's set up, and in the end it leaves you feeling unsatisfied. The two sequel movies are absolutely necessary if you care at all about the story or closure, but even with them you'll probably feel disappointed. This is simply my opinion, however - you may find something here that I didn't.On the plus side, the characters are pretty great (except for the protagonist during &#34;King of Eden&#34;, who is very lacking in personality for that movie only for reasons that will be clear if you watch it), and their interactions are very real. The mystery, while it lasts, is intriguing enough to keep you watching to learn more, even if you're ultimately unsatisfied with the denouement. The animation and artwork are beautiful and the music is good enough.Overall, I think that Eden of the East is worth a watch for those curious, but not worth a purchase unless you just really take to it. It's an entertaining enough ride, but at the end of the day it never reaches the heights or importance of &#34;Ghost in the Shell&#34; despite purporting to be similar, and so it's best enjoyed as one would enjoy something like the &#34;Bourne&#34; movies - an entertaining but ultimately shallow experience that's fun while it lasts, but leaves little impact.",3,Had Potential,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2019,"['decided', 'buy', 'look', 'anime', 'two', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'continuations', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'animation', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'two', 'plot', 'sounded', 'very', 'intriguing', 'original', 'can', 'say', 'did', 'fulfill', 'expectations', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'seemed', 'could', 'have.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'giving', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'can', 'read', 'here', 'already', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'mysteries', 'are', 'enticing', 'first', 'so', 'many', 'mysteries', 'answers', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'questions', 'learning', 'truth', 'plot', 'was', 'excited', 'where', 'show', 'could', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'really.The', 'plot', 'sort', 'fumbles', 'really', 'taking', 'advantage', 'tools', 'set', 'up', 'end', 'feeling', 'unsatisfied', 'two', 'sequel', 'movies', 'are', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'care', 'story', 'closure', 'even', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'simply', 'opinion', 'however', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'here', ""didn't.On"", 'plus', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'great', 'protagonist', '34', 'King', 'Eden', '34', 'who', 'very', 'lacking', 'personality', 'movie', 'only', 'reasons', 'will', 'be', 'clear', 'watch', 'interactions', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'learn', 'more', 'even', ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'unsatisfied', 'denouement', 'animation', 'artwork', 'are', 'beautiful', 'music', 'good', 'enough.Overall', 'think', 'Eden', 'East', 'watch', 'curious', 'not', 'purchase', 'just', 'really', 'take', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'ride', 'end', 'day', 'never', 'heights', 'importance', '34', 'Ghost', 'Shell', '34', 'purporting', 'be', 'similar', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'would', 'enjoy', 'something', '34', 'Bourne', '34', 'movies', 'entertaining', 'ultimately', 'shallow', 'experience', 'fun', 'little', 'impact']",N/A

1407551,A61B8N6588SCY,B004GZZGW2,"JPL ""Avid Gamer, Anime, Manga and Movie Enthu...","[0, 0]","After watching the original series, I became a huge fan of Eden of the East and could not wait until I saw the two theatrical movies to finish off the series: ""The King of Eden"" and ""Paradise Lost.""This movie, ""The King of Eden"" takes place 6 months after the end of the original series. Saki sets out to find Takizawa who has gone missing since his wish to become King of Japan and once again erasing his memories. All Saki  has to go on is a message that Takizawa left on his Selecao cell phone for her - that she will always find him at their ""special place"" (or that place where they travelled together according to the English Subs) which in her interpretation leads her to New  York City. Meanwhile, the Eden of the East search site has exploded in popularity since the missle attacks and our Neets are now running a full fledged corporation. However, as a result of the missile attacks and Takizawa's request to become King, Japan is in a state of unrest economically and politically.During this journey, we revisit our familiar Selecaos trying to win the game in the own unique ways while being introduced to a new, and in my opinion annoying Selecao who serves no purpose to progressing the game's intent. Personally I would have loved to see the Supporter come out and waste him! We also witness another side to  Juiz who seems to have more personality and dare I say opinion when corresponding than the previous series. I do not want to give too much away so I will let you see the entire movie to understand what is going on...which takes me to my biggest gripe: The movie's overall plot progression and lack of understanding. The original series was a thinking person's anime that set us up with the major characters early and then slowly began to peel away the questions we might have asked with each Selcao we came across. Nothing was ever spelled out for us but there was just enough mystery to get us to the next episode while progressing the plot and having us figure out Takizawa's purpose and what was going on with this game. However, the first hour of this film sometimes drags tremendously for me.The search for Takizawa tends to be drawn out a bit while hearing about the political climate of Japan and trying to understand the peculiar actions of the other Selecao (you will  understand when you see it). When our hero finally turns up again, it seems to be a little too convenient in the plot.  In addition, I found myself scratching my head as to ""why is he doing that"" or ""how did they get to be here"" and 'doesn't this setting seem familar?"" To me, the most interesting parts came from the Eden of the East crew trying to support Saki on her quest and then the final 10 minutes of the movie where the plot gets a sudden shot of adrenaline which takes us to the  conclusion...which really is an open door ending for the final movie delivering more questions than answers.I will say that the Bluray looks fantastic with Funimation delivering a very nice dub. The Japanese comes through clearly as well with crisp subtitles. I do suggest watching both the English and Japanese as  there are minor ""reversions"" that Funimation does in the translation to allow it to work for English speaking audiences. The extras are made up of trailers and tv spots but the special one is the movie ""Air Communication"" which was an edited version of the original series complete with commentary by the Eden of the East computer gang. It is only in Japanese with English subs but I tell you it is worth it. It supplies a beautiful refresher before the movies as well as explaining even more information. Definiltey a must see!Personally, I am giving this release a 3 out of 5 mainly because of the inclusion of Air Communication and the fact the Bluray looks and sounds beautifully. The feature film however was a lot to be desired in its pacing and overall execution. It is not a horrible movie, however, I feel the restrictions of a movie instead of say 6 or 7 episodes did not allow for the explanation of mystery that I adored from the first series...especially since the first hour was so under utilized before drop kicking us into the ending. Of course, there is one movie left so hopefully it will deliver on a overall satisfying conclusion.NOBLESSE OBLIGE!",3,"If you are a fan of the series, you might find this movie lacking",1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,4273,"['watching', 'original', 'series', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'Eden', 'East', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'saw', 'two', 'theatrical', 'movies', 'finish', 'off', 'series', 'King', 'Eden', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'movie', 'King', 'Eden', 'place', '6', 'months', 'end', 'original', 'series', 'Saki', 'out', 'find', 'Takizawa', 'who', 'gone', 'missing', 'wish', 'become', 'King', 'Japan', 'once', 'again', 'erasing', 'memories', 'Saki', 'go', 'message', 'Takizawa', 'left', 'Selecao', 'cell', 'phone', 'will', 'always', 'find', 'special', 'place', 'place', 'where', 'travelled', 'together', 'according', 'English', 'Subs', 'interpretation', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Meanwhile', 'Eden', 'East', 'search', 'site', 'exploded', 'popularity', 'missle', 'attacks', 'Neets', 'are', 'now', 'running', 'full', 'fledged', 'corporation', 'However', 'result', 'missile', 'attacks', 'Takizawa', 'request', 'become', 'King', 'Japan', 'state', 'unrest', 'economically', 'politically.During', 'journey', 'revisit', 'familiar', 'Selecaos', 'trying', 'win', 'game', 'own', 'unique', 'ways', 'being', 'introduced', 'new', 'opinion', 'annoying', 'Selecao', 'who', 'purpose', 'progressing', 'game', 'intent', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Supporter', 'come', 'out', 'waste', 'also', 'witness', 'side', 'Juiz', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'personality', 'dare', 'say', 'opinion', 'when', 'corresponding', 'previous', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'let', 'see', 'entire', 'movie', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'movie', 'overall', 'plot', 'progression', 'lack', 'understanding', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'thinking', 'person', 'anime', 'set', 'up', 'major', 'characters', 'early', 'then', 'slowly', 'began', 'peel', 'away', 'questions', 'might', 'have', 'asked', 'Selcao', 'came', 'Nothing', 'was', 'ever', 'spelled', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'enough', 'mystery', 'get', 'next', 'episode', 'progressing', 'plot', 'having', 'figure', 'out', 'Takizawa', 'purpose', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'game', 'However', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'sometimes', 'tremendously', 'me.The', 'search', 'Takizawa', 'be', 'drawn', 'out', 'bit', 'hearing', 'political', 'climate', 'Japan', 'trying', 'understand', 'peculiar', 'actions', 'other', 'Selecao', 'will', 'understand', 'when', 'see', 'When', 'hero', 'finally', 'up', 'again', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'plot', 'addition', 'found', 'scratching', 'head', 'why', 'doing', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'be', 'here', ""n't"", 'setting', 'seem', 'familar', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'came', 'Eden', 'East', 'crew', 'trying', 'support', 'Saki', 'quest', 'then', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'where', 'plot', 'sudden', 'shot', 'adrenaline', 'conclusion', 'really', 'open', 'door', 'ending', 'final', 'movie', 'delivering', 'more', 'questions', 'answers.I', 'will', 'say', 'Bluray', 'fantastic', 'Funimation', 'delivering', 'very', 'nice', 'dub', 'Japanese', 'through', 'clearly', 'as', 'well', 'crisp', 'subtitles', 'do', 'suggest', 'watching', 'English', 'Japanese', 'are', 'minor', 'reversions', 'Funimation', 'translation', 'allow', 'work', 'English', 'speaking', 'audiences', 'extras', 'are', 'made', 'trailers', 'tv', 'spots', 'special', 'one', 'movie', 'Air', 'Communication', 'was', 'edited', 'version', 'original', 'series', 'complete', 'commentary', 'Eden', 'East', 'computer', 'gang', 'only', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subs', 'tell', 'beautiful', 'refresher', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'explaining', 'even', 'more', 'information', 'Definiltey', 'must', 'see', 'Personally', 'am', 'giving', 'release', '3', '5', 'mainly', 'inclusion', 'Air', 'Communication', 'fact', 'Bluray', 'beautifully', 'feature', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'pacing', 'overall', 'execution', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'however', 'feel', 'restrictions', 'movie', 'instead', 'say', '6', '7', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'explanation', 'mystery', 'adored', 'first', 'series', 'especially', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'so', 'utilized', 'drop', 'kicking', 'ending', 'course', 'one', 'movie', 'left', 'so', 'hopefully', 'will', 'deliver', 'overall', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.NOBLESSE', 'OBLIGE']",N/A

1407553,A2AVHD6ZEYOORK,B004GZZGW2,Lily,"[0, 1]","So as a fan of this series I was greatly anticipating this. In fact I checked on this way too many times. In the end I ended up watching it on Netflix and then buying it. The presentation is great, the movie is amazing. Minus the ending. I will not spoil much if anything in this review.So for all those who have seen the series I suggest that maybe you shouldnt watch the movies. Create your own ending, I can't completaly stick with this due to the fact that I have yet to see Paradise Lost. I can't wait for that either!! I continued to watch this because I adore Akira Takizawa.The movie goes around the fact that Saki is looking for Taki. Eden is now fully operational and almost everybody uses it!!! It's a huge corporation now. Saki goes out of her way to look for Taki often buying tickets to go back to the place where they first met due to his last message to her. Remember people?!?! He left her his phone when he erased his memory again!!! I really wish he'd stop doing that...Anyways despite Takizawa erasing his memory for the second time, he still tries to remember his past with his mother. Which leads to some really cute scenes with Taki and Saki. If you want to look at this is in a literal sense, then you really shouldnt be watching anime, let alone Eden XD. You know Taki, he's easy going and kind with his funny little attitude. So naturally when he meets Saki again, he's just like he was the last time she saw him, minus the fact that he doesnt know her. Saki uses an excuse and the two set off togeather, him believing that he is who she says he is because of the picture that he took of them.Along the way we finally meet a new member. In my opinion he's useless and lame and very unecessary, but then again this series is constantly surprising me. Also we find out each member has a Juiz, and each Juiz has a different personality. To me I believe his is just a jerk, Taki's sounds like it's ready to seduce him, and the Johnny hunter's is wonder why she has stopped cutting people's Johnnys off.All and I all I loved it, but I strongly STRONGLY suggest that you wait until Paradise Lost comes out, because of the ending. The ending is why it gets 4 stars.

You get the movie King of Eden on DVD, Air Communication Film on DVD also on the same DVD are some extras. You also get King of Eden and Air Communication on Blu-Ray and the extras included on that disc. So you get 1 Blu-Ray, 2 DVDS, and the extras that come on each disc respectively.
