I particularly liked seeing Scott and Simmons in dramatic roles, since I have previously only seen them in comedies.Complex subject. At times I definitely questioned the message about women, but by the end of the movie, it's clear that all of these ""betrayers"" are equally flawed. Both the acting and great directing made for a movie that struck me as emotionally deep, and also intellectually stimulating. Somewhat depressing yes, but I enjoyed it and didn't come away feeling depressed.

Definitely NOT a film for the youngsters.It's about one brother who completely obsesses over his brothers girlfriend... however his obsession isn't exactly natural or normal.  He's a VERY strange guy and comes off like a lunatic one moment, and completely friendly and relaxed the next.  It's safe to assume he's got some issues upstairs.The relationship that develops between him and his brother is pretty weird as well- he criticizes his brother and yet, there's never any fighting or hostile feelings.  No angry or disagreeable feelings ever develop like you *think* they will.Then throw in the fact the father soon enters the picture and has his OWN highly unusual personality as well and... the Vicious Kind is definitely a different style of storytelling than you're probably used to.The girlfriend constantly gets criticized for being trampy and someone who's out to destroy her boyfriends fragile state of mind, but... I really don't wanna spoil the storyline by revealing too much information here!Just know everything revolves around the one guy and his obsession with his brothers girlfriend.The humor comes in the way of VERY disrespectful and sexually-related jokes that are quite strong, but honestly, these jokes feel almost right in some offbeat kind of way.

1298804,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B002XUBE0U,Elisabeth,"[13, 22]","*** REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ***This is a story about a young man named Peter, who's also a virgin, who brings his girlfriend home to meet his family for Thanksgiving. What Peter doesn't know is that soon after, he's going to get betrayed by 3 people who claim to love him. Here's a list of the 3 people who betray Peter :BETRAYER # 1 -- His brother CalebCaleb sees himself as protective of Peter by constantly telling him how women are whores who'll cheat on a man if given the chance.  He clearly hates women and yet, stalks Peter's girlfriend until she agrees to have sex with him.So not only does he have sex with his brother's girlfriend (which is cruel), but he does this soon after his brother confesses to him that he's in love and wants to lose his virginity to her (which is incredibly cruel).Caleb shows what a coward he is by splitting when Peter's girlfriend reveals she lost her virginity to him...as well as by never confessing to Peter that he slept with his girlfriend.We're given many reasons why we should sympathize with Caleb: he's upset his mom cheated, he's upset his dad cheated, he's upset his ex cheated.  He also says horrible, vicious things to people, but since he immediately follows it up with an apology, we're supposed to believe he's a good guy after all.  Sure he's a misogynist, but he's a misogynist with a heart of gold.But Caleb is just too self-absorbed and too hate-filled to have a heart.BETRAYER # 2 -- His girlfriend EmmaAt first, Emma appears like a sweet and loving girlfriend, but then proves anything but by flirting with Caleb behind Peter's back. After Peter professes his love for her and requests to lose his virginity to her, she accepts it. However, Peter's awkward in bed and can't perform. Instead of sympathizing that he's new at this (and apparently, so is she), she acts annoyed, but plasters a fake smile anyway.She then masturbates, thinking about Caleb. Soon after, she has sex with Caleb behind Peter's back (which is cruel) and then takes Peter's virginity immediately afterward (which is incredibly cruel).After cheating with Caleb, she shows no remorse and instead, wants to talk intimately with Caleb. They even share a big smile afterwards. It's only when Caleb splits after learning she lost her virginity to him does she start to get mad. She then goes back to Peter, never confessing what she's done behind his back (proving she's just as big a coward as Caleb is).BETRAYER # 3 -- His father DonaldDonald shows his creepiness by inappropriately flirting with Emma (so it's not just Caleb who's after her).  But his real creepiness is revealed when he confesses to Emma that he misled his sons into believing he and their mom divorced because their mom cheated on Donald...when really, it was Donald who cheated on their mom.  He holds up this lie even after their mom died of cancer!Later on, Donald finds out Caleb slept with Emma and threatens to tell Peter. Caleb threatens back saying if Donald tells about Caleb's affair, then Caleb will tell about Donald's affairs. The two strike a deal to keep Peter in the dark to save their own skins. And the movie ends with Donald and Caleb bonding over this lie.No one in this movie seems to care about Peter's best interest.  Instead, they only care about preserving their own self-interest.I kept expecting these characters to redeem themselves, but they never do. I wasn't sure what message I'm supposed to glean from this movie. Early in the film, Caleb says all women will cheat if given a chance to do so...and sure enough, when Emma is given the chance to cheat, she does, and with Caleb no less. So does that mean the misogynist was right? All women really are whores?What a hateful message to send and the happy ending is really only happy for these 3 betrayers who get away with lying.",1,A virgin gets betrayed by 3 people who claim to love him,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,3812,"['***', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', '***This', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Peter', 'who', 'also', 'virgin', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'Thanksgiving', 'What', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'know', 'soon', 'going', 'get', 'betrayed', '3', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'love', 'Here', 'list', '3', 'people', 'who', 'betray', 'Peter', 'BETRAYER', '1', 'brother', 'CalebCaleb', 'protective', 'Peter', 'constantly', 'telling', 'how', 'women', 'are', 'whores', 'who', ""'ll"", 'cheat', 'man', 'given', 'chance', 'clearly', 'women', 'yet', 'stalks', 'Peter', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'sex', 'him.So', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'sex', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'cruel', 'soon', 'brother', 'confesses', 'love', 'lose', 'virginity', 'incredibly', 'cruel', '.Caleb', 'what', 'coward', 'splitting', 'when', 'Peter', 'girlfriend', 'lost', 'virginity', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'confessing', 'Peter', 'slept', 'girlfriend.We', ""'re"", 'given', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'should', 'sympathize', 'Caleb', 'upset', 'mom', 'cheated', 'upset', 'dad', 'cheated', 'upset', 'ex', 'cheated', 'also', 'horrible', 'vicious', 'things', 'people', 'immediately', 'up', 'apology', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'good', 'guy', 'Sure', 'misogynist', 'misogynist', 'heart', 'gold.But', 'Caleb', 'just', 'too', 'self-absorbed', 'too', 'hate-filled', 'have', 'heart.BETRAYER', '2', 'girlfriend', 'EmmaAt', 'first', 'Emma', 'sweet', 'loving', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'anything', 'flirting', 'Caleb', 'Peter', 'back', 'Peter', 'love', 'requests', 'lose', 'virginity', 'However', 'Peter', 'awkward', 'bed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'perform', 'Instead', 'sympathizing', 'new', 'apparently', 'so', 'annoyed', 'fake', 'smile', 'anyway.She', 'then', 'thinking', 'Caleb', 'Soon', 'sex', 'Caleb', 'Peter', 'back', 'cruel', 'then', 'Peter', 'virginity', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'incredibly', 'cruel', '.After', 'cheating', 'Caleb', 'remorse', 'instead', 'talk', 'intimately', 'Caleb', 'even', 'share', 'big', 'smile', 'afterwards', 'only', 'when', 'Caleb', 'learning', 'lost', 'virginity', 'start', 'get', 'mad', 'then', 'back', 'Peter', 'never', 'confessing', 'what', 'done', 'back', 'proving', 'just', 'as', 'big', 'coward', 'Caleb', '.BETRAYER', '3', 'father', 'DonaldDonald', 'creepiness', 'inappropriately', 'flirting', 'Emma', 'not', 'just', 'Caleb', 'who', 'real', 'creepiness', 'revealed', 'when', 'Emma', 'misled', 'sons', 'believing', 'mom', 'divorced', 'mom', 'cheated', 'Donald', 'when', 'really', 'was', 'Donald', 'who', 'cheated', 'mom', 'up', 'lie', 'even', 'mom', 'died', 'cancer', 'Later', 'Donald', 'out', 'Caleb', 'slept', 'Emma', 'tell', 'Peter', 'Caleb', 'back', 'saying', 'Donald', 'Caleb', 'affair', 'then', 'Caleb', 'will', 'tell', 'Donald', 'affairs', 'two', 'strike', 'deal', 'keep', 'Peter', 'dark', 'save', 'own', 'skins', 'movie', 'Donald', 'Caleb', 'bonding', 'lie.No', 'one', 'movie', 'care', 'Peter', 'best', 'interest', 'Instead', 'only', 'care', 'preserving', 'own', 'self-interest.I', 'kept', 'expecting', 'characters', 'redeem', 'never', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'message', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'glean', 'movie', 'Early', 'film', 'Caleb', 'women', 'will', 'cheat', 'given', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'sure', 'enough', 'when', 'Emma', 'given', 'chance', 'cheat', 'Caleb', 'less', 'So', 'mean', 'misogynist', 'was', 'right', 'women', 'really', 'are', 'whores', 'What', 'hateful', 'message', 'send', 'happy', 'ending', 'really', 'only', 'happy', '3', 'betrayers', 'who', 'get', 'away', 'lying']",N/A
1298805,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002XUBE0U,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Who knows? Maybe some movie viewers need to see really screwed up people to realize there are those out there worse off than themselves.Here's the scoop. Caleb is way down over a break-up with his girl. He needs to pick his younger brother, Peter, and Peter's girlfriend up from the train station and get them to dad's house for Thanksgiving. He can't join them because he's on the outs with dad. Somehow he and Pete's girl, Emma, develop a fascination for one another and things get sticky.This is a way cool indy flick. It's an interesting situation peppered with interesting characters. Caleb is so strung out over his break-up he vacillates between being incredibly rude and then apologizing for being incredibly rude. His brother Peter is a babe in the woods. He's a virgin and thinks he loves Emma. Emma likes him well enough but is already hiding things from him and is really horny over Caleb. Dad is more than a bit on the crude side and might not be on the level with his boys on why mom left. The pot begins to boil.This is all writing and acting. It's set in Norfolk West Virginia and the winter setting sets a feeling of isolation and loneliness experienced by the four main characters. Caleb gets the most screen time and his behavior helps keep things on edge because the viewer simply does not know what he'll do next. Adam Scott does a fine job as Caleb. He's 180 degrees from his character in ""Parks and Recreation."" J.K. Simmons is always good. This is the first starring roles I've seen for Brittany Snow and Alex Frost. Both do a stand-up job. Vittorio Brahm plays the somewhat challenged J.T., Caleb's work buddy. He doesn't get a lot of screen time but he's a memorable character. I'm not familiar with the director Krieger's previous works but he has two movies in the works and I'd be really interested to see what he's up to.The production values are good enough to make this work. Nothing gets in the way. Everyone, on both sides of the camera, does a fine job.

Throughout the film you will ask yourself, ""who is this guy and what the hell is his problem?"" Adam Scott played well as the angsty older brother Caleb, who is fixated on his brother's girlfriend for the fact that she looks exactly like his ex-girlfriend.  He watches Emma (Brittany Snow) from afar and visions the past scenes of his ex around him. He goes as far as harassing her inside a grocery store.  If Brittany Snow actually got slapped, I applaud her for it. That whole grocery store scene was my favorite. Caleb's brother, Peter, doesn't leave much of an impression. He is looking to lose his virginity to Emma, but later Caleb gets under Emma's skin, and Emma and Caleb end up doing the nasty before Peter can get any action. Emma has weird looking pajamas in this awkward sex scene. Poor Peter is lied to by everyone who claims to care about him. Caleb has such a negative overview on women, he is constantly warning Peter that women are all whores. Caleb's character is unpleasant, and hypocritical.

1298809,AM6QHTYPZ62UT,B002XUBE0U,Ray Cassavaugh,"[3, 5]","Do not even glance at reviews which spoil the plot twists or reveal the outcome.  If I had known how this would end, it would have ruined the entire film for me. It is not an outrageous surprise, just an intellectual twist that made the movie much more worthwhile than I expected it to be.If you prefer movies with some thought behind them and which develop into a satisfying ending without cliche, this little gem is for you.  I bought it for Brittany Snow, who is a very nice little actress with talent.  She really goes against type in this so-called ""dark comedy."" And, to take nothing away from her abilities, she is really outclassed in this film.  I saw her as Brittany Snow playing a part. Not so with any of the other major cast.  For all I could tell, they may have been the real people they portrayed.Acting, directing, screen play and virtually everything else about this low-key drama (I did not see much comedy, dark or otherwise.) were all superb. You think it's a love story about a guy and a girl or even two brothers and a girl. You can believe that all the way to the end, and then you realize, not to give too much away, the story is not really about the guy and the girl or even the two brothers and the girl.  It is much deeper than that and the final 2 scenes make you wonder at how cleverly the screen writer and the actors have led you along to a not completely unpredictable ending but to an ending that finishes the movie just perfectly.I was afraid about 5 minutes before the end that this would turn out to be another one of those awful movies that makes me write my own ending, because none of the expected plot developments were coming to any conclusion.  In fact they seemed to be going nowhere except up in the air. Then POW, right in the kisser. In two short scenes everything we really need to know is exposed and resolved, deftly. At that point the movie became art, and not entertainment. I am amazed.If you like dark comedy, this ain't it. If you like sappy love triangles, this ain't it. If you like low-key genius and don't mind it mixed with intense family drama, some sex, and some predictability (a little) this is it. It's a movie that leaves room for discussion and thought.

In the small picture it looked like Ashton Kutcher was in it. When I pulled it up to see more information about it, I didn't see his name in the list of cast members. But I saw where it had one several Independent Spirit Awards. So with me being a big independent film fan I thought I'd give it a chance and watch it.I was engaged from the first scene. When I first saw Adam Scott in it, all I could think about was Derek from Step Brothers. He honestly surprised me, though. He has some serious acting range in this movie. He plays his character so well that you forget all about his unforgettable role as Derek. He's now Caleb, a very bitter construction worker who seems to view all women as vicious and cruel whores. His brother, Peter, is dating Emma (played by Brittany Snow); a sweet young woman with jet black hair and a smoking habit that she tries to hide. But Adam Scott is still able to pull of his comedy genius as his cold and dark humor really puts a smile on your face once you get to know the character and realize he's harmless.Caleb is driving his brother and his girlfriend to his father's house for Thanksgiving. But Caleb and his father don't get along and haven't spoken in almost a decade. Caleb drops Peter and Emma off and then goes and stays in a motel. Caleb has pretty bad insomnia which stresses him out and makes him prone to sudden outbursts of anger. He is very comical but in a dark and subtle way. He becomes infatuated with Emma and most of the story is the interaction between her and Caleb. One of the most memorable quotes from the movie occurs when Caleb is contemplating having sex with Emma even though she is still dating his younger brother, Peter. Something about how he doesn't want to hurt his brother but he doesn't know any other way to teach him a lesson about how harsh women can be. It's certainly a very deep scene.It's difficult to find a good drama with real-world humor. The dialogue between Caleb and everyone he meets always has this cold, humorous, and subtle message. It's definately a must-see.",5,Surprisingly entertaining with tons of dark humor,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2169,"['65279', '65279', '65279', '65279', 'was', 'scrolling', 'movies', 'one', 'day', 'Netflix', 'came', 'movie', 'small', 'picture', 'looked', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'was', 'When', 'pulled', 'up', 'see', 'more', 'information', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'name', 'list', 'cast', 'members', 'saw', 'where', 'had', 'one', 'several', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Awards', 'So', 'being', 'big', 'independent', 'film', 'fan', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'chance', 'watch', 'it.I', 'was', 'engaged', 'first', 'scene', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'Derek', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'honestly', 'surprised', 'though', 'serious', 'acting', 'range', 'movie', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'forget', 'unforgettable', 'role', 'Derek', 'now', 'Caleb', 'very', 'bitter', 'construction', 'worker', 'who', 'view', 'women', 'vicious', 'cruel', 'whores', 'brother', 'Peter', 'dating', 'Emma', 'played', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'sweet', 'young', 'woman', 'jet', 'black', 'hair', 'smoking', 'habit', 'hide', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'still', 'able', 'pull', 'comedy', 'genius', 'cold', 'dark', 'humor', 'really', 'smile', 'face', 'once', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'realize', 'harmless.Caleb', 'driving', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'father', 'house', 'Thanksgiving', 'Caleb', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'almost', 'decade', 'Caleb', 'Peter', 'Emma', 'off', 'then', 'motel', 'Caleb', 'pretty', 'bad', 'insomnia', 'out', 'prone', 'sudden', 'outbursts', 'anger', 'very', 'comical', 'dark', 'subtle', 'way', 'infatuated', 'Emma', 'most', 'story', 'interaction', 'Caleb', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'movie', 'when', 'Caleb', 'contemplating', 'having', 'sex', 'Emma', 'even', 'still', 'dating', 'younger', 'brother', 'Peter', 'Something', 'how', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'brother', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'way', 'teach', 'lesson', 'how', 'harsh', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'certainly', 'very', 'deep', 'scene.It', 'difficult', 'find', 'good', 'drama', 'real-world', 'humor', 'dialogue', 'Caleb', 'everyone', 'always', 'cold', 'humorous', 'subtle', 'message', 'definately', 'must-see']",N/A

The family angst story of two brothers interested in the same woman aggravated by bad dad relations sounds old, but the acting carries through very believably and the DVD quality turned out solid.The Connecticut locations add a relevant blandness to these characters' dysfunctional relationships and mommy/daddy issues, but Adam Scott shines through in what I would consider his break-out performance (he got some kudos for the lame filmAugust, and usually most recognized as being that bad brother in Step Brothers). Brittany Snow was given some notice for her bold and slightly forward role here, but I think she broke that barrier withOn the Doll. I like what everyone showed here, so even though it gets slow a few times and does not explain all of the character outbursts, it should keep the discerning indie viewer entertained.The picture and sound quality are adequate and showed no real shortcomings. The supplements include:* Behind the scenes, 16:19 minutes. Director interviews spliced with too much clip footage, but he gives a thorough background on creation and actor support in making this film.* Deleted scenes, 5 totaling 6:30 minutes. Four of them have optional commentary. Glad they were cut.* Extended scenes, 5 totaling 16 minutes. Worth the watch if you REALLY liked the acting.* Two commentaries, one with director solo and one with him and Scott.English and Spanish subs, 5.1 English only.",4,"Great performances, decent DVD",1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,1492,"['indie', 'flew', 'radar', 'doubt', 'watch', 'family', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'interested', 'same', 'woman', 'aggravated', 'bad', 'dad', 'relations', 'old', 'acting', 'very', 'believably', 'DVD', 'quality', 'turned', 'out', 'solid.The', 'Connecticut', 'locations', 'add', 'relevant', 'blandness', 'characters', 'dysfunctional', 'relationships', 'mommy/daddy', 'issues', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'shines', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'break-out', 'performance', 'got', 'kudos', 'lame', 'filmAugust', 'usually', 'most', 'recognized', 'being', 'bad', 'brother', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'was', 'given', 'notice', 'bold', 'slightly', 'forward', 'role', 'here', 'think', 'broke', 'barrier', 'withOn', 'Doll', 'like', 'what', 'everyone', 'showed', 'here', 'so', 'even', 'slow', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'explain', 'character', 'should', 'keep', 'discerning', 'indie', 'entertained.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'adequate', 'showed', 'real', 'shortcomings', 'supplements', 'include', '*', 'scenes', '16:19', 'minutes', 'Director', 'interviews', 'spliced', 'too', 'much', 'clip', 'footage', 'thorough', 'background', 'creation', 'actor', 'support', 'making', 'film', '*', 'Deleted', 'scenes', '5', 'totaling', '6:30', 'minutes', 'Four', 'have', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Glad', 'were', 'cut', '*', 'Extended', 'scenes', '5', 'totaling', '16', 'minutes', 'watch', 'REALLY', 'liked', 'acting', 'Two', 'commentaries', 'one', 'director', 'solo', 'one', 'Scott.English', 'Spanish', 'subs', '5.1', 'English', 'only']",N/A
