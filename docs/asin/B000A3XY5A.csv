920243,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000A3XY5A,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 10]","""Crash"" is a clever and groundbreaking movie.  The story takes place in Los Angeles and weaves several situations involving prejudice and anguish; each character is usually portrayed as a victim and a villain at the same time. The movie seamlessly takes all of these people with their diverse backgrounds and their situations and brings them together so skillfully that any criticism of the movie being ""contrived"" seems provincial.  To reflect on any of the scenarios is unnecessary and perhaps a spoiler, for this movie is meant to be savored.  The acting is realistic; the action is riveting; and the story is marvelous.At the risk of damning with faint praise, I knew upon seeing this DVD, that it would win an Oscar for best film editing, but it obviously has more assets going for it than that.  After seeing essential films like ""Mississippi Burning,"" I felt that ""Crash"" has filled a need:  It correctly diagnosis our societal ills, but it also provides us with a way out of our human condition.  It transcends it by showing us our better angels, and it does so in a way that is plausible and not at all sentimental.  However, this film is no mere sociology class; it is fine entertainment.  It is entertainment which provides anguish and catharsis, which is what the best entertainment does.Perennial commentary has been fixated upon the Oscars.  While ""Brokeback Mountain"" was groomed to win Best Picture, it was a matter of choosing between apples and oranges. (By the way, I want the reader to know that I don't think you are ""phobic"" if you prefer ""Crash"" to ""Brokeback Mountain,"" and I am mortified by those who do.  It is a rash judgment, and rash judgments are what ""Crash"" is all about. ""BBM"" fans should see this film without prejudice and vice-versa.)  (I also predicted that the picture that won Best Oscar would be regarded like ""Ordinary People"" of 1980, and the loser like ""Raging Bull"".  There is such loyalty for each movie and great merits for both.)",5,Can't We All Get Along?,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1976,"['Crash', 'clever', 'groundbreaking', 'movie', 'story', 'place', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'several', 'situations', 'involving', 'prejudice', 'anguish', 'character', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'victim', 'villain', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'seamlessly', 'people', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'situations', 'together', 'so', 'skillfully', 'criticism', 'movie', 'being', 'contrived', 'provincial', 'reflect', 'scenarios', 'unnecessary', 'perhaps', 'spoiler', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'savored', 'acting', 'realistic', 'action', 'riveting', 'story', 'risk', 'damning', 'faint', 'praise', 'knew', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'would', 'win', 'Oscar', 'best', 'film', 'editing', 'obviously', 'more', 'assets', 'going', 'seeing', 'essential', 'films', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', 'felt', 'Crash', 'filled', 'need', 'correctly', 'societal', 'ills', 'also', 'way', 'human', 'condition', 'showing', 'better', 'angels', 'so', 'way', 'plausible', 'not', 'sentimental', 'However', 'film', 'mere', 'sociology', 'class', 'fine', 'entertainment', 'entertainment', 'anguish', 'catharsis', 'what', 'best', 'entertainment', 'does.Perennial', 'commentary', 'been', 'fixated', 'Oscars', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'groomed', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'was', 'matter', 'choosing', 'apples', 'oranges', 'way', 'want', 'reader', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'are', 'phobic', 'prefer', 'Crash', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'am', 'mortified', 'who', 'do', 'rash', 'judgment', 'rash', 'judgments', 'are', 'what', 'Crash', 'BBM', 'fans', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'prejudice', 'vice-versa', 'also', 'predicted', 'picture', 'won', 'Best', 'Oscar', 'would', 'be', 'regarded', 'Ordinary', 'People', '1980', 'loser', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'such', 'loyalty', 'movie', 'great', 'merits']",Crash

It also gives us complete well rounded characters that we can understand even if we don't live in their world.Nothing gets resolved in this movie.  With maybe the exception of one character (the locksmith) all are flawed.  The movie does little if any preaching and really just entertains while portraying stories that make us examine our beliefs.  Some consider it a racist movie but I think it just tries to entertain rather than make a political point.  Thats why it is such a good movie.

Wow, somebody in Hollywood discovered racism!This movie plays like a high-school senior treatise on American racial stereotyping. It cleverly uses reverse stereotypes to give the audience ""aha"" moments, but that doesn't diminish the puppet-master morality play atmosphere that reduces characters down to two-dimensional symbols.The ""cross-cut"" scripting technique, which magically intersects the lives of unrelated people, is really getting old and particularly heavy-handed here. If you want to see movies that handle racism elegantly, try Watermelon Man or Hollywood Shuffle. They succeed with humor where Crash fails with drama.Plenty of good performances by plenty of good actors are wasted in this tutorial. If only those actors and performances could have found their way into movies about believable people. Racism can't be approached as a single theme in an issue-oriented movie any more than love or death could. Racism is part of the psychological profile of every person on the planet, and as such, should present organically from inside characters, not top down from a studio executive who, in a fleeting moment of social awareness and responsibility, decides to cash in (or Crash in) on the concept.",3,Tragic Crash Caught On Film!

920271,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000A3XY5A,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","The first time I saw `Crash' I quickly labeled it a masterpiece, so much so that when it defeated the goliath that was `Brokeback Mountain' for the Best Picture Oscar I actually defended it during the onslaught of disapproval.  After a second viewing though I have a very different opinion of the film.  I still enjoy `Crash' to a degree but I began to notice things this second time around that for some odd reason didn't bother me during the first viewing.  I just want to say that I am a person who believes in subtleties, especially when you're trying to make something believable and or relatable.  When approaching the controversial subject of race relations one needs to use tact and discernment, not to avoid stepping on toes but to make the situations realistic.  That is my biggest issue with `Crash'.  It is far too blunt and outlandish with its racist propaganda it paints every occurrence throughout the day to be a race related issue, and we all know that that is just not the case.  The script never allows the audience to soak up the real issues because we are too focused on the overly contrived scenarios.I may be able to get behind the idea or concept that each and every human, at least in the America's, has a sliver of ingrown racism.  This of course is due to the ever popular tradition of stereotyping and the heavy push the media gives to cementing those stereotypes into our heads.  It's a sad predicament, but it's one that everyone is for the most part aware of.  That said it was a shame that Paul Haggis couldn't have approached this film with a little more grace so as to make his statement truly affective.  If he had just reigned in his constant barrage of racial slurs and stereotypes himself then maybe I could have walked away from this film feeling like it would make an impact, open some eyes maybe, but in the end I don't feel it could do that.The film features interwoven stories of a group of LA inhabitants who just so happen to experience racism around every corner.  You have a District Attorney and his wife who are car jacked by two young African American's.  You have a black cop and his Hispanic partner who uncover a murder of a black police officer by a white undercover cop.  You have a Mexican locksmith and a Persian store owner who have an altercation regarding a door as well as a black television producer and his wife who are antagonized and harassed by a racist white cop and his reluctant partner.  And then there are suspicious Chinese men with a van.  The lives of all these people are presented in a hodgepodge of racially tense scenes, most of which are ridiculously unbelievable.There are a few scenes that are realistically portrayed and it's within those scenes that `Crash' gets its point across.  When Cameron (the television director) is approached by his boss to reshoot a scene where the African American actor appeared too smart it was a subtle yet powerful portrayal of the media's opinion of a race in general.  It's a shame they went and messed that up with having Cameron go on a tantrum that was both irrational and utterly unconvincing.  There are also scenes that are turned into more than they really are.  When Cameron and his wife Christine are accosted by Officer Ryan Christine turns her husbands reaction to the situation into a black white thing as in ""you're not black enough to defend me"" when in actuality his reaction was more a ""you're not man enough to defend me"".  It has nothing to do with race whatsoever.  He was chicken, didn't want to ruffle feathers.  If the couple had been white it would have been the same thing, a husband allowing another man to molest his wife so as not to wind up incarcerated.It's apparent to me that Paul Haggis was just trying way too hard and this subject should not be a difficult one to approach since it is an apparent problem, but it's within the subtleties that this becomes relatable and most importantly believable.As someone has mentioned already, the Academy got this movie all backwards, rewarding it for a ridiculously clich&eacute;d script and handing it the Oscar for being pretty much an uneven and heavy-handed film but ignoring altogether the brilliant acting that made this film palatable.  In fact I can honestly say that this film deserved so much more than just one acting nomination for the entire cast really delivered, and they had to, for it's not like the script was helping them any.  Matt Dillon may be the apparent standout, and I was so happy to see him get the nomination since he truly deserved it, but he is far from the only deserving cast member.Don Cheadle is a brilliant actor and he infuses equal parts drama and humor to make his performance memorable.  Both Ludacris and Larenz Tate are excellent as the two young thugs who steal the car in the beginning that starts the whole downward spiral.  In fact their conversations about racism itself are some of the highlights of the film.  Michael Pena also delivers wonderfully here as Daniel, the lock locksmith.  His performance or at least his character is probably the most moving of the film and he is the center for one of the most heart wrenching scenes in the film.  Both Sandra Bullock and Thandie Newton deliver here but I'd give the leg up to Bullock who really sinks her teeth into her performance.  It's a much more reserved and quiet performance as apposed to Newton's more eccentric performance.  They both are good but Newton comes off a little uneven in parts.  I am not a fan of Howard in the least and his flip out just killed all the joy I was actually finding in the subtleties of his performance.  Sadly Brendan Fraser and Jennifer Esposito aren't given too much to work with, but they do well with what they are given.In the end I can't say that I hate this film but I can say that it did not deserve the amount of praise it received in the end.  In fact if this movie had not won the Oscar I probably would have given it a slightly higher rating, but when you are declared Best Picture of the year then you have to reach a certain amount of dignity and a level of perfection that the remaining nominees had failed to attain.  `Crash' did not do that.  In fact I can personally think of three fellow nominees who deserved the big prize over `Crash', all of which reached those heights.",3,"Sadly it crashes and burns, never really addresses what it

Bowen,"[0, 1]","First I'd like to quote another reviewer who said, ""...there are so many coincidences of characters running into each other at key moments in the story is just wasn't believable."" I'm not sure how it is not believable that the characters in a movie crossed paths. It's not coincidence... it is a story which focuses on a number of characters who cross paths... that's kind of the point. I'm not sure why so many people rated the film so low; even if you don't completely love it, it in no way deserves a 1-star rating. Anyway, the movie displays a lot of stereotypes which in this situation I think is perfect to illustrate the main theme of racism. Racism stems from stereotypes so to say that this movie was wrong for using stereotypes would be to say that the movie was wrong to bring the subject of racism to the public eye. I think this is just one of those movies that has become popular to hate, although there's really no reason to hate it other than the fact that it was so successful.",5,A very moving film,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,994,"['First', ""'d"", 'like', 'quote', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'coincidences', 'characters', 'running', 'other', 'key', 'moments', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'not', 'believable', 'characters', 'movie', 'crossed', 'paths', 'not', 'coincidence', 'story', 'number', 'characters', 'who', 'cross', 'paths', 'kind', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'rated', 'film', 'so', 'low', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'love', 'way', '1-star', 'rating', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'lot', 'stereotypes', 'situation', 'think', 'perfect', 'illustrate', 'main', 'theme', 'racism', 'Racism', 'stereotypes', 'so', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', 'using', 'stereotypes', 'would', 'be', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'wrong', 'bring', 'subject', 'racism', 'public', 'eye', 'think', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'become', 'popular', 'hate', 'really', 'reason', 'hate', 'other', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'successful']",Crash
920273,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B000A3XY5A,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[8, 18]","Crash is one of the greatest films ever made. Quite an accusation to make as the opening sentence of a review you say? Well this time you CAN believe the hype. For once, I honestly agree with the Academy's choice for Crash as the picture of the year. Crash is an emotionally riveting expose' from beginning to end. A true chronicle of the ways race and discrimination shapes our lives. With displays of breath taking courage and emotional turmoil, Crash delivers on every aspect a film should deliver on. Leaving the viewer with a changed heart and a thought filled mind.Crash follows it's incredible cast through a 36 hour period in which all of the characters are faced with issues of racial hate and stereotypes. I know...It sounds like some kind of after school TV special. But the pure emotional carnage and the expertly written and acted script pull this film into the realm of having historical significance. Coming in at just under two hours in length, Crash displays an amazing amount of meaning into a considerably short period of time.The acting is pure perfection. Paul Haggis directs with such a sheer intensity that leaves you struck and truly caring for each and every character and gives you a little spot for yourself in the movie. What I mean by this is that you do not simply believe that you are watching a scripted film, but that you are a witness to all of these events as they are occurring. You don't just relate yourself to one of the characters, but all of them, because all of them hold a piece to the puzzle of humanity.I love the dynamics of the film as well. The film starts with all of the characters having a certain hypocritical superiority complex. While they are all quick to defend their own race for people that are prejudice to them, they are even more quick to discriminate against someone else. But what really set the greatness of the movie into my mind, were the changes the characters go through within the story. They all realize that underneath all of our differences are undiscovered truths and a bond that all human species are inherited with. The ending also leaves the audience conflicted. Both heart-breaking and joyful emotions are drawn from the end. Which left me feeling a exotic mix of emotions that I have not used in a long time.Every actor in this film is a supporting actor. There is no real starring role. Though, that is one of the things I love about the film. There may not be a starring role, but the starring role is divided into all of the supporting roles, creating a monster of acting perfection. Paul Haggis really has made a point though. If everything is made equal, things are a lot better. Could their be a hidden meaning even in the amount of screen time each actor got?Hands down this was the film of the year. Maybe even one of the best movies of all-time. It left me speechless and emotional. Crash displays true substance and teaches everyone a lesson that even the most radical of racial activist can not deny. When life is boiled down to it's one true meaning, when color and demographics are thrown out the window, and religious differences are discarded of, we all only have one thing. And that is life its self. The meaning of life is life itself...huh, what a concept. If only we lived in utopia, where all are nights were slept soundly and all are differences were forgotten. Then maybe we really all could start to live.5 OUT OF 5",5,We Are All People,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,3416,"['Crash', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'accusation', 'make', 'opening', 'sentence', 'review', 'say', 'Well', 'time', 'CAN', 'believe', 'hype', 'once', 'honestly', 'agree', 'Academy', 'choice', 'Crash', 'picture', 'year', 'Crash', 'emotionally', 'riveting', 'expose', 'beginning', 'end', 'true', 'chronicle', 'ways', 'race', 'discrimination', 'shapes', 'lives', 'displays', 'breath', 'taking', 'courage', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'Crash', 'delivers', 'aspect', 'film', 'should', 'deliver', 'Leaving', 'viewer', 'changed', 'heart', 'thought', 'filled', 'mind.Crash', 'incredible', 'cast', '36', 'hour', 'period', 'characters', 'are', 'faced', 'issues', 'racial', 'hate', 'stereotypes', 'know', 'kind', 'school', 'TV', 'special', 'pure', 'emotional', 'carnage', 'expertly', 'written', 'acted', 'script', 'pull', 'film', 'realm', 'having', 'historical', 'significance', 'Coming', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'length', 'Crash', 'amazing', 'amount', 'meaning', 'considerably', 'short', 'period', 'time.The', 'acting', 'pure', 'perfection', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'such', 'sheer', 'intensity', 'struck', 'truly', 'caring', 'character', 'little', 'spot', 'movie', 'What', 'mean', 'do', 'not', 'simply', 'believe', 'are', 'watching', 'scripted', 'film', 'are', 'witness', 'events', 'are', 'occurring', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'relate', 'one', 'characters', 'hold', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'humanity.I', 'dynamics', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'characters', 'having', 'certain', 'hypocritical', 'superiority', 'complex', 'are', 'quick', 'defend', 'own', 'race', 'people', 'are', 'prejudice', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'quick', 'discriminate', 'someone', 'else', 'what', 'really', 'set', 'greatness', 'movie', 'mind', 'were', 'changes', 'characters', 'go', 'story', 'realize', 'differences', 'are', 'undiscovered', 'truths', 'bond', 'human', 'species', 'are', 'inherited', 'ending', 'also', 'audience', 'conflicted', 'heart-breaking', 'joyful', 'emotions', 'are', 'drawn', 'end', 'Which', 'left', 'feeling', 'exotic', 'mix', 'emotions', 'have', 'not', 'used', 'long', 'time.Every', 'actor', 'film', 'supporting', 'actor', 'real', 'starring', 'role', 'Though', 'one', 'things', 'love', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'starring', 'role', 'starring', 'role', 'divided', 'supporting', 'roles', 'creating', 'monster', 'acting', 'perfection', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'really', 'made', 'point', 'everything', 'made', 'equal', 'things', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'Could', 'be', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'even', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'actor', 'got', 'down', 'was', 'film', 'year', 'Maybe', 'even', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'all-time', 'left', 'speechless', 'emotional', 'Crash', 'displays', 'true', 'substance', 'everyone', 'lesson', 'even', 'most', 'radical', 'racial', 'activist', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'When', 'life', 'boiled', 'down', 'one', 'true', 'meaning', 'when', 'color', 'demographics', 'are', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'religious', 'differences', 'are', 'discarded', 'all', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'life', 'self', 'meaning', 'life', 'life', 'huh', 'what', 'concept', 'only', 'lived', 'utopia', 'where', 'are', 'nights', 'were', 'slept', 'soundly', 'are', 'differences', 'were', 'forgotten', 'Then', 'maybe', 'really', 'could', 'start', 'live.5', 'OUT', '5']",Crash
920274,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000A3XY5A,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 5]","Today, many movies and television shows exist in order to offend, such as South Park and Family Guy.  They insult religion, ethnicities, and even the different genders.  Shock value is used to either teach a lesson or just plain have fun with the audience who would never think that anyone would say such things.  Crash is different.  The almost non-stop racial remarks in this movie aren't in good fun; they are meant to be taken seriously, as if real people would (and probably do) say/do the things that the characters in this movie do.  Crash shows us just how deeply ingrained racism is in our world even if we choose not to acknowledge it, and it does so without mercy.Crash takes place over the course of about 36 hours.  The movie begins toward the end, as we meet Det. Graham (Don Cheadle) and his partner, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) at a crime scene.  Graham makes a few remarks about racism and life in LA, then we are taken back to the previous day, and a diverse group of characters are introduced to us.  Farhad (Shaun Toub) is a Persian convenience store owner who relies on his daughter to translate most of his conversations into English.  Due to his poor grasp on the language, many things that people tell him get lost in translation.  Anthony (Ludacris) is a young black man who constantly complains about how black people are treated in LA by both white and black people.  His friend/partner Peter (Larenz Tate) tries to argue with him, but Anthony usually wins.  After a profound speech about how they are misunderstood, the pair carjacks an SUV from the Los Angeles District Attorney and his wife.  Rick (Brendan Fraser), the DA is a nice enough guy, but when it comes to politics, he tends to display a little ""reverse racism"".  He is way too concerned about how black people will respond to the carjacking.  His wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), on the other hand, is a high-strung racist who doesn't hold back when she thinks she has someone figured out.  Two other police officers soon enter the mix while searching for the DA's car.  Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) is a blatant racist and abuses the badge whenever he is in a low-risk situation.  However, when life is at stake, he tends to be a pretty good cop.  His partner, Hanson (Ryan Phillipe), detests him for his racist behavior.  Hanson is a rookie who (I hate to say this) is still naive and idealist.  The duo pull over Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), a very affluent black couple, and Ryan has his way with the subdued Cameron.  Finally, there's Daniel (Michael Pena), a Hispanic locksmith who, on the same night, has an unfortunate encounter with both Farhad and Karen.The cast of characters is very large, which in turn causes many interesting overlaps.  Different characters move in and out of the lives of each other, causing many misunderstandings, fights, and embarassments.  With few exceptions, every character at some time or another, shows that racism has nearly permeated our entire culture.  The characters that are openly racist can sometimes do good things for the people they claim to hate, while other characters who try to be moral can sometimes be subconsciously racist.  I can think of only one major character who never showed a racist side, however, due to the beliefs of someone else, was put in a bad situation.One of the best things about this movie is that it is so hard to watch.  Some of the things that people say are just so terrible that one doesn't want to ever think about them.  But I guess that this story had to be told sometime, and the writers and actors do a wonderful job with pure hatred.  The characters act and react the way their real-life counterparts would, while none of the characters are actual stereotypes.  The actors do a great job with this film, even Ludacris, who is a rapper, not an actor.  One reason for the great performances may be that the actors had a lot of passion for this project (Bullock even paid for her plane ticket out of her own pocket just so that she could be in this movie).This movie is not for the weak of heart, and not everyone may be ready/prepared to hear what it has to say.

I recall years ago seeing sandra bullock captioned on a variety of media outlets and i must say here her performance is all too good, of course i shouldnt be surprised but i was for some reason at what a good actess and good performance she turns in. The film is about media tensions and profiling and in one early scene which typifies what's wrong in city life she tees off at her d.a. husband about gangs chasing them,which may be the result of her d.a. husband and who he associates and where there contration in the city lies....very good scene. The car scenes and crash hark back to an early david cronenberg film,and also in one scene where a woman is cupped by an officer,showing racinal tensions between officer and husband,and showing attachment disorders in investigators. Later this same officer goes to all extents,rescuing woman from capsized car,but he really doesnt do anything for the guy and it is the woman who caused sexual disorderin car. These are very complex scenes set up,of a relationship of three people which goes way off base. There is also a scene near end of film of killed officer,innocent man being framed,and then scenes with sandra bullock at film's end falling apart angry at world and spouse and not being able to make sense of life...but does this make any sense. Interesting note in arguement between black couple they bring up,the show cosby show. This was a black show typifying white life which was why though very popular not many people liked it,or saw it as not really typifying the reality of black life,and its spinoff was it ""a life of one's own"" i'm not sure. The problem with the film is the city is in a mess since they often aid the wrong people,for a large variety of reasons not only racism,orexpectations and constructs.The key to understanding so much in film,and this film,is the good performance by sandra bullock which let mesee many things,and where the actual problems in this city are,a film that works on many levels,a film of los angelesbut probably typical of many cities,and the stars talk of being around chicago and new york.

I wouldn't speculate about its truthful depiction of American life 'cos I've never been to the U.S. therefore I guess I have no right to judge. I can only rely on other reviewers' opinions regarding this matter. Besides the movie looks rather truthful.It has a structure of multiple characters with different story-lines each that collide suddenly when we wouldn't expect them to. Certainly this way of telling a story isn't new at all in cinema, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that director Paul Haggis (who was mainly working for TV and a couple of years back wrote the screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby"" by the way) brilliantly sliced contemporary society showing all of us how rotten and corrupted it is from the inside. What's more important is that Haggis was quite impartial doing this - I didn't see any edification and preachment in the film. And that served it good because had it been didactic and preachy it would seem pretentious and pompous. Haggis doesn't make any visible conclusions here, he just shows the people their alienation, anger, spite, selfishness and racism and lets them make their own conclusions.Conclusion I made watching ""Crash"" is that human relationship is a very fragile and delicate thing. We can live in peace if we want but one single spark is enough to ignite the whole thing, and we won't be able to put it out. We have to try to respect those who surround us no matter what and be tolerant. That's the number one rule for mankind if it wants to see its next century. Don't do to others what you wouldn't want them to do to you - and we might live happily ever after. And it applies to small things also. I met people saying some racist stuff and in turn I was saying: ""You're a racist"". And they were answering: ""No, I'm not, I don't wish anything bad for folks with another skin color. I just don't want them near me"". And that, I should say, IS the racism. Because everything starts with some insignificant and petty things.By the way here I am starting to sound didactic and preachy myself (unlike Haggis' film). So I'd better stop.

920284,A3KI9ZHXNGCKHH,B000A3XY5A,Antonio Cunha Silva,"[10, 14]","2 and 1/2 StarsI will be honest and serious on my comments about Crash.I have seen it last summer and bought the DVD last year as well as the soundtrack by Mark Isham.Paul Haggis is an interesting person - he must be - just because he had written also Million Dollar Baby by one of my favourite directors, Clint Eastwood. So I was excited to saw this movie.It's good and with some - not all - believable characters - fabulous Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton.A good story line! Some interesting camera angles for a first movie experience from Paul Haggis. But I had seen ""this story"" in Theatres along the years: Lantana, Magnolia, The 24th Hour and so on...But - really - this movie, although great, is not Art in Cinema. It should'nt had won the Oscar for Best Picture. Crash is not the most significant movie of 2005.Obviously, and for those who love cinema - I mean real love for the movies - KNOWS that Brokeback Mountain were the most obvious choice. It was so obvious that I just cannot believe it had lost that missing prize (the Only one!). It happens to be that Brokeback Mountain, just to remember, had won THE Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival, 4 Golden Globes, 4 BAFTAS, The Director's Guild of America among many others + 3 Oscars (same number as Crash) including Best Director (Crash misses it too!). You know, ALL of this meant something! Crash did not won none of the above listed prizes!Art in filmmaking = Great directing. Period. Brokeback Mountain IS an unforgettable story ALSO brilliantly played by 3 Oscar nominees with a miraculous sensibility. What more can I say. I do not believe in people who say Crash is better than BM. Just don't. The Academy is more and more old. Sadly! And I think they will regret forever that Brokeback Mountain didn't won that only and missing prize. Though the movie lingers on in my heart.Crash is a story from Los Angeles. The Oscars were given in Los Angeles. And the movie ends with an almost ""hollywood ending"". Everything was correct and explained to the viewer. Why?Crash won Best Picture just because of the old fashioned prejudice from the ""Academy"". I really thought it was extinguish! Yes! How fool am I! The ""Academy"" MUST BE - SHOULD BE ahead of its time. But it's not!

920285,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000A3XY5A,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 2]","Crash is a great movie. Few modern movies can impact a person as powerfully as this movie did, and Crash does that and more. You can't just watch this movie. You think about it, and wonder what if. What if you were in a situation like the ones the people in this film were? What if you were the recipient of some harsh and blunt racism? What if you reacted the way that these people do to racism? Questions that are, in the end, purely relevant in today's world... questions that have and probably, sadly, always will be relevant.Crash is about L.A., a huge city full of all kinds of different people, and what happens when these people are forced to deal with each other. The odd thing is it's the one thing that tears us apart as a society that brings these characters together: racism. The movie follows many different people as they live through two days in the city, while also handling and dishing out their own personal forms of hatred. The cast is huge, and the stories themselves are powerful and merciless. Where one man learns a lesson, another loses a loved one. Where one person gets a second chance, another loses everything in one dramatic moment. The sad thing is is that a lot of the hatred is based on simple stereotypes and ignorance, and the people in this story go from ignorance to knowledgeable, and are left with the option of whether they should continue to hate, or decide otherwise.From start to finish, the theme of this movie is clear, and you're kind of left breathless with how harshly that theme is presented. You feel for the characters who are the objects of the racism, while you're also forced to understand the people who give out that racism. It's a constant, emotional swing; there are times when you're shouting at the screen and there are times when your eyes sting with tears. It's easy to be affected by the happenings in Crash.For anyone looking for a good, modern movie to watch, pick this up and place all your sensitivities aside. Crash is a movie of pure relevance that should be seen by everyone.

It is for that very reason that the film is about hatred and hope, violence and redemption.  Perhaps most poignantly, it is filled with all the complexity of modern life and provides no easy answers.You will be left speechless.  All of the actors, most well known, play roles that are against their ""types"" of roles and it is for this reason that it is perhaps so impacting and believable.

920291,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000A3XY5A,Austin Somlo,"[0, 2]","Viewed: 2/06Rate: 62/06: Crash is an overrated movie with a couple of very good performances. The racism is too overflowing in this film in a city that is very diverse. Too many subplots hurt this film because they left a lot of questions unanswered. Actually, perhaps the acting of some players did hurt the film because they were overdoing the emotions. Take Sandra Bullock, she is constantly screaming all the time, but looking at her to perform it, I felt embarrassed to do so. Crash was more like ""let's take tough issues and stare them in the eye,"" and at the same time, the message being sent is becoming quite silly. Feeling like more of many TV shows in one segment of a movie, Crash failed to fill the gaps to deliver a completeness. Let's move on to the couple of very good performances. Terrence Howard was real and incredible in his role. He reminded me a lot of Benicio Del Toro. Interestingly, watching Crash felt like watching Traffic, where much of everything was too similar, except Traffic gave the more completeness feel, although the film per se wasn't good. Anyway, Terrence Howard is a good contender for the Best Supporting Actor award. Finally, the best part in this movie is from one man. It's been twenty plus years since he first started out, and finally, he gets an Academy Award nomination. That's Matt Dillon who deserved it the most. This is a great performance, easily one of the best of his career. What made Matt Dillon so good in Crash is how he was completely submerged into the character of a seemingly racist police officer who isn't racist, troubled, and psychotic. He is who he is. Meanwhile, Crash offered a few intense scenes, making a big difference in the story telling, but to look at the bigger picture, a lot is already missing out.",3,Matt Dillon Is the Greatest.,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1780,"['Viewed', '2/06Rate', '62/06', 'Crash', 'overrated', 'movie', 'couple', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'racism', 'too', 'overflowing', 'film', 'city', 'very', 'diverse', 'Too', 'many', 'subplots', 'hurt', 'film', 'left', 'lot', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'Actually', 'perhaps', 'acting', 'players', 'did', 'hurt', 'film', 'were', 'overdoing', 'emotions', 'Take', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'constantly', 'screaming', 'time', 'looking', 'perform', 'felt', 'embarrassed', 'do', 'so', 'Crash', 'was', 'more', 'let', 'take', 'tough', 'issues', 'stare', 'eye', 'same', 'time', 'message', 'being', 'sent', 'becoming', 'quite', 'silly', 'Feeling', 'more', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'one', 'segment', 'movie', 'Crash', 'failed', 'fill', 'gaps', 'deliver', 'completeness', 'Let', 'move', 'couple', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'was', 'real', 'incredible', 'role', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Interestingly', 'watching', 'Crash', 'felt', 'watching', 'Traffic', 'where', 'much', 'everything', 'was', 'too', 'similar', 'Traffic', 'gave', 'more', 'completeness', 'feel', 'film', 'se', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'Anyway', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'good', 'contender', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'award', 'Finally', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'one', 'man', 'been', 'twenty', 'years', 'first', 'started', 'out', 'finally', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'deserved', 'most', 'great', 'performance', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'career', 'What', 'made', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'so', 'good', 'Crash', 'how', 'was', 'completely', 'submerged', 'character', 'seemingly', 'racist', 'police', 'officer', 'who', ""n't"", 'racist', 'troubled', 'psychotic', 'who', 'Meanwhile', 'Crash', 'offered', 'few', 'intense', 'scenes', 'making', 'big', 'difference', 'story', 'telling', 'look', 'bigger', 'picture', 'lot', 'already', 'missing', 'out']",Crash
920292,A1R602SXNGOMJ4,B000A3XY5A,A. Vegan,"[2, 6]","""Crash"" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.The all-encompassing theme of the film is racism, and it is dealt with bluntly, honestly, and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it.A talented ensemble drives the film, sharing almost equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), , Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Pe&ntilde;a (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls -- alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care -- to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breath the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life.In the end, everyone is flawed, the racism is inescapable, and the audience feels a twinge of sympathy for just about everyone.",4,Crash of Emotions,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,1687,"['Crash', 'complex', 'movie', 'simple', 'premise', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', '8', 'main', 'characters', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'supporting', 'walks', 'life', 'races', 'lives', 'intersect', 'point', 'one', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'yet', 'alienated', 'point', 'breaking', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'come', 'together', 'things', 'explode.The', 'all-encompassing', 'theme', 'film', 'racism', 'dealt', 'bluntly', 'honestly', 'reservation', 'single', 'character', 'participates', 'perpetuation', 'ugly', 'cycle', 'also', 'suffers', 'it.A', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'drives', 'film', 'sharing', 'almost', 'equal', 'amounts', 'screen', 'time', 'folks', 'who', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'had', 'full', 'attention', 'time', 'were', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'TV', 'director', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'patrol', 'cop', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'rich', 'housewife', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'detective', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'locksmith', 'five', 'gave', 'deeply', 'deeply', 'felt', 'performances', 'portraying', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'personal', 'situations', 'giving', 'souls', 'alone', 'yearning', 'searching', 'world', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'shells', 'imperfect', 'people', 'actors', 'triumph', 'little', 'moments', 'human', 'contact', 'glance', 'embrace', 'pause', 'smile', 'wince', 'things', 'breath', 'film', 'life', 'simple', 'visuals', 'give', 'profundity', 'beautifully', 'illustrated', 'small', 'scene', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'Jean', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'maid', 'begun', 'realize', 'problems', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'two', 'black', 'guys', 'who', 'car', 'jacked', 'own', 'life.In', 'end', 'everyone', 'flawed', 'racism', 'inescapable', 'audience', 'twinge', 'sympathy', 'just', 'everyone']",Crash

Ostensibly this is a latticework of interconnected stories, ala Robert Altman, but Haggis has little of the naturalness that Altman brought to bear. Every plot twist and ""reveal"" is exactly what you think it will be: this film has no genuine surprises, just as its characters have no genuine motivations.

He would have us think that black car thieves are philosophers and have a code of honor. He would make us believe white racist cops would be allowed to openly exist in the LAPD. What Paul Haggis does in CRASH is ram his own white liberal guilt down our throats and tells us to like it. He tries to compose a giant irony-fest in which everyone's lives are seemingly interconnected, and what goes around comes around.His irony isn't even subtle, but overt and predictable. He seems to have seen all three hours of MAGNOLIA too many times and tried to come up with his own version. He trades the rain of frogs at the end of MAGNOLIA for a snow storm in L.A. He plays on the same themes of death, failure and everyone needing to help one another despite biases. He purposely wants us to feel guilty that we have ever shared the same thoughts as the characters. I don't buy it, Mr. Haggis.There are obvious stretches in credulity which make the film difficult to watch:1. The Los Angeles County District Attorney has a driver. He would not have been carjacked.2. No police officer I know would EVER pick up a hitchhiker, late at night, I don't care what color he/she is. This part of the movie is shameless manipulation.3. It is wrong for Haggis to infer that Matt Dillon's character could get away with behavior that is clearly against LAPD policy. These matters are thoroughly investigated and for the most part the officer is considered guilty until proven innocent. Many officers have been suspended for less than what Dillon's character does while an investigation is pending.4. I do not believe for a second that Ludacris would not have shot Terrence Howard when the carjacking went awry. There is no honor among thieves. Bottom line is to get the vehicle, and anyone who gets in the way is eliminated. People have been killed for less than a vehicle. Portraying a car thief as not really a violent person is wrong.5. When Sandra Bullock whined to her Hispanic maid, ""You're the best friend I have,"" I threw up in my mouth a little. Puh-leeze!.6. No cop would say something so pretentiously pseudo-existentialist like, ""I think we crash into each other just to feel something."" DUMB!!!I know, I know...""It's only a movie.""

But Crash does so in such an unrealistic and untruthful way that it is impossible to take seriously or learn anything from.Below is part of Erik Lundegaard's article for msnbc.com.  I obviously did not write it, but I agree with it 100% and could not have said it better myself:This is the worst best picture winner since ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" in 1952. It may be worse than that. ""Greatest Show"" was a dull, bloated romance set against the backdrop of a three-ring circus but at least it didn't pretend to be important. ""Crash"" thinks it's important. ""Crash"" thinks it's saying something bold about racism in America.But what is it saying?That we all bear some form of racism. That we all ""stereotype"" other races. That, when pressured, racist sentiments spill out of us as easily as escaped air.Here's my take. Yes, we all bear some form of racism - that's obvious. Yes, we all ""stereotype"" other races in some fashion - that's obvious. (Particularly obvious in the Los Angeles of ""Crash,"" where so many characters are stereotypes.) But, no, we don't easily give voice to our racist sentiments. And that's why ""Crash"" rings so false.Last month I wrote an article on the best picture nominees (called  ""Anything But `Crash'"") in which I talked about how the most potent form of racism in this country is no longer overt but covert. Once upon a time, yes yes yes, it was overt, which is another reason why ""Crash"" sucks.

Put a little pressure on somebody and they blurt simplistic racist sentiments. Right in the face of someone of that race.Worse, none of it feels like sentiments these characters would actually say. It feels like sentiments writer/director Paul Haggis imposed upon them to make his grand, dull point about racism, when a more telling point about racism might have emerged if he'd just let them be. ""Crash"" is like a Creative Writing 101 demonstration of what not to do as a writer. To the Academy this meant two things: Best screenplay and best picture.The Sandra Bullock/Ludacris sceneA few readers objected to my column last month - and will no doubt object to this one. They felt ""Crash"" taught them something important about race. More's the pity. They said they learned that even good people do bad things, and even bad people have moments of compassion. Sorry they didn't already know this. They felt like ""Crash"" was a movie the average person could support. ""Average,"" I guess, is the key word here.Some agreed with me that the most potent form of racism today is covert rather than overt; but they added that this was a movie, after all, not a book, and in a movie you can't show characters thinking.Ah, but you can. Paul Haggis even did it in ""Crash"" - in the scene where Sandra Bullock's character grabs her husband's arm as two black men approach. Her move toward her husband is silent and instinctive, and Ludacris' character suspects she does what she does because he's black, and she's scared of him, but he has no evidence. We only get the evidence later, from her, when she argues with her husband about the Latino locksmith. And even this scene is handled ineptly. She should have argued with her husband upstairs, away from the help. But Haggis wanted her to complain about the Latino locksmith within earshot of the Latino locksmith - because apparently that's how we all do it. Lord knows if I don't trust someone because of their race and/or class I raise my objection within earshot of them. Doesn't everyone?The main point is that you can dramatize our more covert forms of racism. But here's how bad ""Crash"" is. Even though the Bullock/Ludacris scene is one of the more realistic scenes in the movie, it is still monumentally simplistic. I have a white female friend who lives close to the downtown area of her city. Usually she walks home from downtown. If she does this after dark, and two men are walking towards her, she'll cross to the other side of the street to avoid them. But if the two men are black? She won't do this, because she's afraid of appearing racist. That's how much of a conundrum race is in this country. ""Crash"" didn't begin to scratch that surface.Losing JimSo why did it win?There are rumors that older Academy members shied away from even viewing ""Brokeback Mountain"" for the usual homophobic reasons. Lionsgate also pushed ""Crash"" on Academy voters; it handed out a record number of DVDs and advertised heavily. I don't know which explanation bothers me more. All I know is I feel sick. It feels like the '72 Olympic basketball finals, when the Russians cheated and won; it feels like the '85 World Series when a blown call in game six tilted the balance towards the Royals. It feels like the good guys wuz robbed.My friend Jim is more interested in the Academy than anyone I know who isn't involved in the industry. (He's a chauffeur in Seattle.) By early summer he's already talking up possible nominees. The discussion reaches a fever pitch in November and December when the prestige pictures are rolled out and critics make their ""best of"" announcements. He goes to see these films. He talks about them. He actually cares.Not anymore.""Crash's"" win did him in. The Academy, he said afterwards, ""is not a serious body of voters who vote rationally. If they're influenced by a DVD sales pitch, they're not worth my time.""Are they worth anyone's time? Once again, they showed themselves susceptible to something other than a legitimate search for ""the best."" Once again, marketing appears to have won. The Academy is 78 years old and acting every bit of it, and last night they took another doddering step towards irrelevancy.",1,"Gets points for trying, but fails miserably",1142121600,"03 12,

In style it is very reminisce of the great director Robert Altman at his best.Crash takes us on a journey of self examination that is both thought provoking and disturbing.  Many see ""Crash"" as a movie about racism, certainly thats true but I believe it more about racial/ethnic misunderstanding.(i.e. the Storekeeper and the Locksmith) Still there is more, the film also address our famliy relationships and more importantly our fears.If the film has a short coming its it rather negitive characterization of LAPD and other authority figures. I know its a popular opinion but it detracts from what I feel is ""otherwise insightful and balanceed film"". I also have a small concern that some negitive stereotypes maybe reforced (in the mind of the viewer) rather than disproved as some characters rant familiar but false slogons.Postscipt:I have found interesting the polarization found in most of theses reviews. I have come to believe that we all are ""not talking or listening to each other"". It comes to mind that that is the moral of the whole movie. ( i.e. Don Cheadle opening line: ""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you.""...""I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""There is also the element of controversy that I don't understand.This would have been a very non-controversal film not all that long ago.

920308,A3AF8P0GINFADV,B000A3XY5A,Black Barbie,"[2, 4]","""Crash"" is one of those films that you hear about with thunderous hype, knowing that it is controversial; at the eye of its' storm is race. This multi-character film deals with racism in the western world, using the USA as its' background. Various characters such as the disillusioned black cop Graham (Don Cheadle), the anxious and assuming Jean (Sandra Bullock) and the multi-faced director Cameron (Terrence Howard) are a few of the diverse personalities that make up this rich and intense race relations study.There are many reasons why this film works (all of the actors' memorable performances) and listing them would be futile because once you see it, you will know! However, I think that the main point about this film that elevates it beyond a run of the mill race film hoping to get viewers is the fact that it breaks away from stereotypes as the characters are laced with hypocrisy, immense personal struggle and loss. It doesn't make scapegoats out of certain characters nor does it let you emphasise with one character over another. It lets you look into their lives and more importantly, it raises important questions over the race debate in today's modern world -- for example, the tough and unrelenting script gives us a stark look into the life of one of the memorable characters Farhad (Shaun Toub) who suffers due to the intense political climate of today, thus showing that ""Crash"" is more than just a film about the struggles between blacks and whites in the States.Go see this film -- it is a 3-dimensional film on the emotional level and undoubtedly thought provoking.",5,Captivating,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,1591,"['Crash', 'one', 'films', 'hear', 'thunderous', 'hype', 'knowing', 'controversial', 'eye', 'storm', 'race', 'multi-character', 'film', 'deals', 'racism', 'western', 'world', 'using', 'USA', 'background', 'Various', 'characters', 'such', 'disillusioned', 'black', 'cop', 'Graham', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'anxious', 'assuming', 'Jean', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'multi-faced', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'are', 'few', 'diverse', 'make', 'up', 'rich', 'intense', 'race', 'relations', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'actors', 'memorable', 'performances', 'listing', 'would', 'be', 'futile', 'once', 'see', 'will', 'know', 'However', 'think', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'run', 'mill', 'race', 'film', 'hoping', 'get', 'viewers', 'fact', 'away', 'stereotypes', 'characters', 'are', 'laced', 'hypocrisy', 'immense', 'personal', 'struggle', 'loss', ""n't"", 'make', 'scapegoats', 'certain', 'characters', 'let', 'emphasise', 'one', 'character', 'look', 'lives', 'more', 'importantly', 'important', 'questions', 'race', 'debate', 'today', 'modern', 'world', 'example', 'tough', 'unrelenting', 'script', 'stark', 'look', 'life', 'one', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Farhad', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'who', 'due', 'intense', 'political', 'climate', 'today', 'thus', 'showing', 'Crash', 'more', 'just', 'film', 'struggles', 'blacks', 'whites', 'States.Go', 'see', 'film', '3-dimensional', 'film', 'emotional', 'level', 'undoubtedly', 'thought', 'provoking']",Crash

How often we forget that looking the part isn't the same as acting the part.A middle-aged woman who dresses provocatively in public - is she sleazy, or does she suffer from low self-esteem and feels this is the only way she'll be appreciated?Someone who is well-dressed, drives an expensive car, wears expensive jewelry, etc.  Is s/he rich, or desperately in debt, trying to appear rich?A youth who wears loose pants and a backward ballcap - is he a criminal, or just trying to fit-in at school so he won't get bullied like all the other smart kids?Personally, thanks to my job, I tend to notice teenage boys/young men in the street and assume they're up to no good. I even got a part-time job with teens to remind myself that not all youth are bad. It worked. There are plenty of good kids out there.This movie reminds us that despite the way a person looks and all your previous history with ""their kind"", the person's skin colour, clothing, way of speaking, etc. does not define who they are. Our behaviour defines us - and that IS something we can control.I sometimes point the frown of judgment back on myself and try to imagine what others assume of my character, based on my job, the way I dress, etc.  Chances are that they're quite wrong.I'm giving this movie 4 stars but only because of the lengthy non-speaking shots where the camera flicks from one scene to another with mood music playing.

This movie was lousy, boring, too simplistic, and too emotional. It's funny but  last semester one of my instructors decided to show ""Crash"" to the entire class because she thought it would be a ""good learning tool"" about how racism affects the lives of everybody. Of course everyone in the class was eager to see it- anything but hearing a lecture. So after the movie was over, everyone in the class talked about how deep the movie was and that the movie made them more aware of racism. First of all, this movie was about exaggerated stereotypes and I don't know how anyone could learn about racism by watching a Hollywood film  within the protective walls of a classroom. If my classmates wanted to learn more about racism, all they needed to do was go volunteer or work  for 1+ years in a minority community and talk with the people. But no- it's soooo much easier to watch ""Crash"" and then say you've been enlightened to the evils of racism.

And I'm glad I did.The story is about an interlinking section of lives between people of varying ethnicity, working backgrounds, and class and how one little event can effect the lives of those they've never met.Racism rears its ugly head early and often in the film, and does so in the bright light of day. Nothing is hidden or candy-coated for the audience. And all of the characters have depth and emotion and love and hate and fear and hope balled up inside themselves.A cop, who cares for his ailing and aging father in a very loving way, is also a bigot and uses his power as a policeman to exact revenge on those (i.e. African Americans) he sees as causing many of his and his father's problems.A district attorney who gets his SUV car-jacked one night, tries not to stereotype those black men who stole it, but also has to deal with what ""the black vote"" will think when this news comes out. He also has to handle the sudden panicky fear his wife feels toward any minorities they meet (including their long-time, hispanic housekeeper).A hispanic man who installs locks for a living must deal with the prejudices people feel toward him because of some gang tatoos that peek out from underneath his clothing. But he's also a loving father with a little girl at home who fears that something bad will happen to her; they used to live in a very tough neighborhood where gunshots were a common sound. The scenes with this father and daughter never ceased to grip me, especially when some of the girl's fears appear to be coming true.A Persian immigrant who owns a store must fight to understand and to be understood in a land where he feels hatred at every corner because of the Sept. 11th attacks. And he responds in kind by buying a gun to protect his store's property, much to the dismay of his wife and daughter....And the list of characters go on, each event folding over and effecting the others. It's an awesome spectacle to behold, and the end is like a piece of interpretive art. There's no definitive message to hang on to other than that we're humans, flawed and greatness in equal quantities.The all-star cast was also pretty impressive: Sandra Bullock, Brendan Frazier, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Daniel Dae Kim, etc.I've read some other reviews here that comment on the ""sterotyping"" of the racist characters. But that is completely and utterly untrue. The fact that the characters often knew the stereotypes surrounding them, and commented on these, helped bring the screenplay to an entirely different level. And if, as a viewer, you felt offended by the film, you might want to ask yourself why that is.Although the film uses race to deliver the message of hate, fear, and shallowness, the ending is surprisingly up-beat as some (but not all) of these great characters grow internally.",4,Racism and Fear in All of Us,1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,2951,"['initial', 'dark', 'qualities', 'surrounded', 'opening', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'made', 'wonder', 'wanted', 'continue', 'watching', 'did', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.The', 'story', 'interlinking', 'section', 'lives', 'people', 'varying', 'ethnicity', 'working', 'backgrounds', 'class', 'how', 'one', 'little', 'event', 'can', 'effect', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met.Racism', 'ugly', 'head', 'early', 'often', 'film', 'so', 'bright', 'light', 'day', 'Nothing', 'hidden', 'candy-coated', 'audience', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'emotion', 'love', 'hate', 'fear', 'hope', 'balled', 'up', 'inside', 'cop', 'who', 'ailing', 'aging', 'father', 'very', 'loving', 'way', 'also', 'bigot', 'power', 'policeman', 'exact', 'revenge', 'i.e', 'African', 'Americans', 'causing', 'many', 'father', 'problems.A', 'district', 'attorney', 'who', 'SUV', 'car-jacked', 'one', 'night', 'not', 'stereotype', 'black', 'men', 'who', 'stole', 'also', 'deal', 'what', 'black', 'vote', 'will', 'think', 'when', 'news', 'out', 'also', 'handle', 'sudden', 'panicky', 'fear', 'wife', 'feels', 'minorities', 'meet', 'including', 'long-time', 'hispanic', 'housekeeper', 'hispanic', 'man', 'who', 'locks', 'living', 'must', 'deal', 'prejudices', 'people', 'feel', 'gang', 'tatoos', 'peek', 'out', 'clothing', 'also', 'loving', 'father', 'little', 'girl', 'home', 'who', 'something', 'bad', 'will', 'happen', 'used', 'live', 'very', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'gunshots', 'were', 'common', 'sound', 'scenes', 'father', 'daughter', 'never', 'ceased', 'grip', 'especially', 'when', 'girl', 'fears', 'appear', 'be', 'coming', 'true.A', 'Persian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'store', 'must', 'fight', 'understand', 'be', 'understood', 'land', 'where', 'hatred', 'corner', 'Sept.', '11th', 'attacks', 'kind', 'buying', 'gun', 'protect', 'store', 'property', 'much', 'dismay', 'wife', 'daughter', 'list', 'characters', 'go', 'event', 'folding', 'effecting', 'others', 'awesome', 'spectacle', 'behold', 'end', 'piece', 'interpretive', 'art', 'definitive', 'message', 'hang', 'other', ""'re"", 'humans', 'flawed', 'greatness', 'equal', 'quantities.The', 'all-star', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Brendan', 'Frazier', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'etc.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'comment', 'sterotyping', 'racist', 'characters', 'completely', 'utterly', 'untrue', 'fact', 'characters', 'often', 'knew', 'stereotypes', 'surrounding', 'commented', 'helped', 'bring', 'screenplay', 'entirely', 'different', 'level', 'viewer', 'felt', 'offended', 'film', 'might', 'want', 'ask', 'why', 'film', 'race', 'deliver', 'message', 'hate', 'fear', 'shallowness', 'ending', 'surprisingly', 'up-beat', 'not', 'great', 'characters', 'grow', 'internally']",Crash

There are way too many characters, every single one of them based on racial stereotypes and its misconceptions. One never really learns the core essence of any of the characters, other than what they think of other races. Incidentally, almost every race is represented in this film. If they were going to attempt to include every race, I am puzzled as to why they left out the Eastern and Native American Indians...The plot, if it can be called a plot, is unrealistic and contrived. Throughout the film, there is constant buildup of events leaving the audience sitting through all of the movie on the edge of their seats with no clear resolution in sight. I find this manipulative and couldn't wait for the movie to just end already. The movie just adds tension upon tension and its climax is only just barely reached towards the end when, oh yeah, the vast amount of characters in this movie pass through each other's lives. Wow. Deep. There is nothing new to learn in this movie that cannot be learned from the news or just observing daily life.Sadly to say, stereotypes is a sad fact of life that won't be leaving anytime soon until society becomes less privileged and more equal for everybody. Basing a movie soley on stereotypes is plain boring. There is no story in it. I suggest watching the original, Amores Perros, or 21 Grams. They're highly more entertaining, although gruesome.

920318,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000A3XY5A,Boss Fan,"[1, 4]","3/07/06Why am I not surprised to see all the (overly) venomous things being spewed out at this film just hours after its ""upset"" Oscar win?  I don't think any of the people who are saying things like ""I wanted to burn this film,"" felt quite that strongly in their dislike for this movie before Sunday night, and I'd also bet most of them would never have even bothered to write a review until this ""atrocity"" of a win occurred.  All of a sudden, though, this movie is the worst thing to happen to cinema since ""Howard the Duck.""Well, besides the fact that many of you arguing such things can't even manage to write a coherent sentence to get your point across (""I did not saw this movie and I don't plan to,"" writes one reviewer; a) that is poor grammar and doesn't make much sense and b) what then are you doing writing a review?), the others that do have valid reasons could still stand to relax.  Only one movie a year can win best picture.  It won't always be the one you want.The Oscars have disappointed me more times than I can count in the past:  How does ""Forrest Gump"" win over ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The English Patient"" over ""Fargo,"" ""Shakespeare in Love"" over ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Gladiator"" over ""Traffic,"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" over ""Mystic River?""  The fact is all the movies nominated usually deserve to be (and often many do that aren't, see ""A History of Violence"" this year), but only one can walk away with that gold man.  We all have our opinions on which film it should be. In the past 15 years or so I've only supported the wins for ""Unforgiven,"" ""Braveheart,"" and ""Million Dollar Baby.""  ""Forrest Gump"" is a fine film, and ""Lord of the Rings"" was amazingly conceived, but was ""Gump"" as groundbreakingly original and revitalizing to American cinema as ""Pulp Fiction?""  Was ""LOTR"" as emotionally draining and quietly haunting as ""Mystic River?""  The answer, no matter if you liked these films or not, is 'no.'  But the Academy voters saw it fit to award the other films.  At least in the case of ""Brokeback"" and ""Crash"" the two movies are worthy competitors, both dealing with tough topics and aspiring to be more than just movies (if they succeed or not is in the eye of the beholder), and a win for one over the other does not mean the Academy is out of touch and awarding the ""safer"" movie.  I knew on Monday morning I was going to hear all this crap about the Oscars being homophobes and not ready to deal with a movie as tough and liberal as ""Brokeback Mountain."" It's a cop out.  To lose to ""Crash"" is to lose to a movie about racism, violence and our personal demons; a movie that questions its characters true inner beliefs and feelings; if they really are the people they think they are. That hardly sounds to me like an Academy that is out of touch or afraid to recognize a movie that deals with controversial topics, just playing it safe.Also; I am laughing my ass off at all you people who keep saying that you are done with the Oscars, this is the final nail in their coffin, and you now realize they are a joke and out of touch, etc.; what rock have you people been living under?  You're just fed up now?! I just listed ten years of Oscar misses!  And to the people who keep talking about ""Magnolia"" and other movies ""Crash"" ""ripped-off,"" hey, ""Speed"" is ""Die Hard"" on a bus - and still an excellent movie!  (And for the record:  ""Magnolia"" sucked!)And to reviewer ""Moviebuff Layne,"" I respect your attempt to be somewhat fair and balanced in what you said here, noting you hadn't seen the film and comparing it to ""Brokeback"" on a technical, award-winning level, however, the fact remains you have not seen it, and you are exactly the kind of person I am referring to when I point out reviewers who are trying to turn their disappointment over their favorite movie losing into a witch hunt for prejudices against gays. You also shoot your self in the foot because you acknowledge in your ""Brokeback"" review the movie hit home for you because you are gay.  That hardly makes you fair and balanced in your view of the better film and by that logic, should a person who has been racially persecuted be able to bash Oscar as racist had ""Brokeback"" won?  And to say homophobia is a bigger issue than race in this country is a pretty radical statement.  I'm sure anyone who's experienced racism, as you may have experienced sexual persecution, would disagree.  You are the close-minded individual ""Crash"" was made for. You say you planned to see ""Crash;"" do so, and then give us your two cents.I also think these issues and ideas are bigger than the issue of gay love.  If you want to be equal about gay love then, fine, we're just talking about a love story with ""Brokeback,"" a well-done, moving one, but a love story just the same.  If it would have been about two male and female cowboys would it have gained the same notoriety; or would the gay community embrace it as the best movie of the year?  Would we even be comparing these two movies?  ""Crash's"" issues are bigger than any love story, gay or straight, and the answer's are tougher.  It is the more complex, challenging film.  Not all of us are struggling with budding homosexuality, but we are all struggling with our own personal prejudices.  If you think you're not, then you probably are more than any one else.  And that is ""Crash's"" ultimate message.That said; is ""Crash"" a well made film, does it have all the cheesy moments people have mentioned, are the performances good, is the dialog labored, are there better movies out there, etc?  Hey, it's all in the eye of the beholder.  Enough Academy voters obviously thought on a whole it was a special, meaningful and potent film.  But if you don't, that's fine.  But don't make the Academy out to be homophobes because the movie you liked better didn't win.The one criticism I can not tolerate is that ""Crash"" is a racist movie.  I don't know where in the hell this idea came from, but only the most self-righteous person, who thinks they are bias free, and that any exploration of some possible truism stereotypes furthers racism can truly believe this.  I am a white male who truly hates the idea of being politically correct just for the sake of being politically correct.  And I think racism works both ways, and that all races are guilty of it, just as they are all guilty of many of the stereotypes they have been labeled with.  To the white people who think they are being preached to:  you just don't get it.  To the minorities that thinks it reinforces stereotypes:  The NAACP awarded ""Crash"" best movie of the year.  If any organization was going to sniff out a racist movie, they would have been it.  Not only did they not find it racist, they also called it the best movie of the year.  `Nuff said.Maybe it's the hype that has some of you baffled as to this film's greatness.  I first saw this movie nearly a year ago with free passes to an advanced screening and wasn't expecting any thing and I was blown away.  To watch it grow and build its deserved audience was exciting and to watch the inevitable backlash build was depressing.I guess what it comes down to is the quality of the film.  This review forum has turned into an Oscar point/counterpoint, but we should still remember to review the film on its own terms (hard as it may be now).  Forget the awards and the backlash.  Most movies are either overrated or underrated (had ""Brokeback"" won, we'd have the exact opposite sentiments on this page from people who felt ""Crash"" was robbed).  I'm not giving ""Crash"" 5 stars.  It is a great film full of great ideas.  It deserves more than just to call it a good movie and I definitely think people should see it (even if they don't like it), but, as one Amazon reviewer said, it makes you think but is not perfect. As much as it made me think, there are plenty of movies that affected me more and haunted me more deeply.  But that's like saying something is not a great movie - or the best of the year - because it doesn't stand up to the best of some other year.  Of this year's nominees, ""Crash"" was the right choice.Oh, and lets stop calling it an upset.  I know ""Brokeback"" was predicted in most circles to win, but we are acting like ""Crash"" stole the award or something, as if it never had a chance.  I don't know how many top ten lists that I saw list ""Crash"" over ""Brokeback,"" and for as many critics that loved them, both films had an equal amount of detractors.  Those shocked by ""Crash's"" win just underestimated how close of a race this was.  Don't bitch cause you're expectations weren't met.  If anything, the Oscars, generally a predictable night (especially after months of award shows leading up to them) could use more surprises, upsets and close races.  Last year was something of a nail-biter for ""Aviator"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" fans (it's hard to recall now, but they won equal amounts of Awards, and ""Aviator"" took the Golden Globe), but somewhere along the line ""Baby"" gained momentum and pulled ahead (good).  The same thing happened this year.  Both years, the Oscars were better for it.",4,Whoa!  Let the 'Broke'-backlash begin.

920323,A1Y1PO0Z1312Q3,B000A3XY5A,Brandon Wilkening,"[49, 67]","I have to admit that I was slightly biased against this film even before I watched it, because I really liked Brokeback Mountain and couldn't imagine that another film could be more worthy than that one of winning the Oscar. That said, I did try to keep an open mind when watching Crash, and it just didn't work for me.A number of things turned me off. First, I thought that the dialogue was unrealistic and contrived. In the special features the writers claimed that they were trying to present situations and interactions between people that would make the viewers uncomfortable and force them to confront their own prejudices. It did make me uncomfortable, not so much due to the realism of the situations portrayed in the movie, but simply because of the awkwardness of the dialogue. In this movie, racism is not a subtle sentiment that lurks beneath the surface. Instead, racism is right there, just waiting to be acted upon in response to the slightest provocation.The first part of the movie basically consists of people being set off by the slightest misunderstandings and resorting to ridiculous racial slurs. A white gun store owner unleashes a tirade of racial invective against a Persian man who takes too long to decide what type of gun he wants. There is a fender bender between a Chinese woman and a Latino woman, who immediately engage in a war of racial slurs before they even have time to assess the damage. This same Chinese woman later curses at a nurse because she asks if the woman can speak English after she barges into the hospital in search of her husband shouting his name at the top of her lungs. There were so many misunderstandings and unfortunate events that could have been avoided if people would just speak in calm voices and resist the temptation to yell.Maybe this was the point that the movie was trying to make, that people need to chill out and evaluate their own prejudices before acting. And the unfortunate events that occurred were supposed to allow the characters to reflect on these prejudices and ultimately redeem themselves. However, the redemption that the characters did experience seemed artificial to me. What are we supposed to make of the scene where Matt Dillon's racist cop character saves the life of a black woman whom he had earlier molested? Has he been redeemed by this experience? Why? Surely in his 10-year cop as an LA cop he has had other opportunities to help African Americans in similarly extreme circumstances. If so, are we supposed to believe that only an event so extreme as saving another person's life offers the opportunity for introspection? What lesson has the Persian store owner learned after he almost commits a horrific crime?  After the incident, he has a tearful conversation with his daughter in which he spouts some babble about a guardian angel, but has he learned to stop flying off the handle every time he is provoked? I was similarly unconvinced by Sandra Bullock's character's sudden conversion to a decent person after her Latino maid cares for her after an injury. In none of these instances is it really clear what these characters have learned. Overall, I just didn't feel as if these movie brought any sort of fresh new perspective to the difficult issue of race. If anything, the film makes me want to rewatch Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, which offers a much more intense and realistic portrait of racial relations.",2,Not the best film dealing with racism out there,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,3415,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'slightly', 'biased', 'film', 'even', 'watched', 'really', 'liked', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'worthy', 'one', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'said', 'did', 'try', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'Crash', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.A', 'number', 'things', 'turned', 'off', 'First', 'thought', 'dialogue', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'contrived', 'special', 'writers', 'claimed', 'were', 'trying', 'present', 'situations', 'interactions', 'people', 'would', 'make', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'force', 'confront', 'own', 'prejudices', 'did', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'due', 'realism', 'situations', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'simply', 'awkwardness', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'racism', 'not', 'subtle', 'sentiment', 'surface', 'Instead', 'racism', 'right', 'there', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'acted', 'response', 'slightest', 'provocation.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'basically', 'people', 'being', 'set', 'off', 'slightest', 'misunderstandings', 'resorting', 'ridiculous', 'racial', 'slurs', 'white', 'gun', 'store', 'owner', 'tirade', 'racial', 'invective', 'Persian', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'long', 'decide', 'what', 'type', 'gun', 'fender', 'bender', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'Latino', 'woman', 'who', 'immediately', 'engage', 'war', 'racial', 'slurs', 'even', 'have', 'time', 'assess', 'damage', 'same', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'later', 'nurse', 'woman', 'can', 'speak', 'English', 'hospital', 'search', 'husband', 'shouting', 'name', 'top', 'lungs', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'misunderstandings', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'people', 'would', 'just', 'speak', 'calm', 'voices', 'resist', 'temptation', 'yell.Maybe', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'people', 'need', 'chill', 'out', 'evaluate', 'own', 'prejudices', 'acting', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'occurred', 'were', 'supposed', 'allow', 'characters', 'reflect', 'prejudices', 'ultimately', 'redeem', 'However', 'redemption', 'characters', 'did', 'experience', 'seemed', 'artificial', 'What', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'scene', 'where', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'racist', 'cop', 'character', 'life', 'black', 'woman', 'whom', 'had', 'earlier', 'molested', 'Has', 'been', 'redeemed', 'experience', 'Why', 'Surely', '10-year', 'cop', 'LA', 'cop', 'had', 'other', 'opportunities', 'help', 'African', 'Americans', 'similarly', 'extreme', 'circumstances', 'so', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'only', 'event', 'so', 'extreme', 'saving', 'person', 'life', 'opportunity', 'introspection', 'What', 'lesson', 'Persian', 'store', 'owner', 'learned', 'almost', 'horrific', 'crime', 'incident', 'tearful', 'conversation', 'daughter', 'babble', 'guardian', 'angel', 'learned', 'stop', 'flying', 'off', 'handle', 'time', 'provoked', 'was', 'similarly', 'unconvinced', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'character', 'sudden', 'conversion', 'decent', 'person', 'Latino', 'maid', 'cares', 'injury', 'none', 'instances', 'really', 'clear', 'what', 'characters', 'have', 'learned', 'Overall', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'brought', 'sort', 'fresh', 'new', 'perspective', 'difficult', 'issue', 'race', 'anything', 'film', 'want', 'rewatch', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'racial', 'relations']",Crash

Every character has a flaw (or many flaws), some seemingly unforgivable.  Each character also has good and something irrefutably redeemable about them--just like the rest of us.  While Crash focuses mainly on racial prejudice and all that goes along with that, it also simply shines a light on how humans relate and treat each other as friends, parents, lovers, enemies.  Crash somehow managed to show many of man's darker aspects of his psyche in a way that makes you see your own, while giving hope about the resilience of human nature and the laughter that can only come through life and all the good and bad it has to offer.

920328,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B000A3XY5A,Brian,"[7, 10]","My most vivid memory from the 2005 Academy Awards has to be the reaction Jack Nicholson gave the entire live crowd upon reading the winner for Best Picture. Everyone there was clearly expecting ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Walk The Line"" to carry off that award. But, they didn't, and Nicholson's shocked expression spoke sheer volumes to that effect. I don't even think he was expecting to find ""Crash"" written anywhere inside that envelope.The fact is, nobody listening was expecting to hear him announce it either.Why? Because, quite simply, ""Crash"" did not deserve to win Best Picture.Don't get me wrong. This film was certainly very well acted and well-intentioned. But, haven't we all seen this exact same story done countless times before? I can think of at least five other race-related films that were far more deserving of the gushing accolades Paul Haggis received for this release. His depiction of modern-day Los Angeles is so unrealistically off the mark and behind the times. This is not to say that racism no longer exists within that city or across this nation, because it obviously does. But, come on, let's get real! Do asian americans or citizens of middle eastern descent honestly speak or represent themselves as stereotypically as they do within the context of this motion picture?

920331,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000A3XY5A,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 4]","""Crash"" is a very entertaining movie that combines multiple ""stories"" into one film. This motion picture examines racial and ethnic stereotypes and it is politically incorrect to the extreme. The characters depicted in this film have many prejudices that they hold dear and they have no problem openly expressing how they feel.Several different stories are told in this film and they all focus on the controversies and problems of stereotyping certain individuals. There are people in this movie who hold prejudices against blacks, Hispanics, women, and other groups. They are put to the test several times where they have the opportunity to shake off some of these negative feelings about other people. Sometimes, they successfully remove the negative mindset. Other times, the feelings of prejudice are compounded further.One of the many great things about this movie is its lack of predictability. I won't say too much here, because I don't want to give the film away. But there are many moments where the film seems like it is slowing down and getting a little repetitive with all the racial talk, then out of nowhere, something hits you like a ton of bricks. It happens more than once, and it adds greatly to the movie's appeal.Another asset of this film is its all- star cast that includes (among others) Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, and Sandra Bullock. Everyone in this movie excels on the big screen and the director did a fine job with his timing and the emotions he elicits from this great cast of Hollywood actors and actresses. They all contribute top- notch performances to this film.""Crash"" is a thinking person's film and among its many strong points, this is probably the one that matters most. After watching it, I ended up discussing the film's finer points with others who had watched it with me. We discussed the topic of racism and stereotyping; how easily this way of thinking can manifest itself in most any person; how it can adversely affect one's life; and how difficult it is to eliminate. Any film that can make you think the way this movie does is a film worth watching. And I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great, creative, thought- provoking cinema.",5,"Different Attitudes Come Smashing Together in ""Crash""",1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,2188,"['Crash', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'multiple', 'stories', 'one', 'film', 'motion', 'picture', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'extreme', 'characters', 'depicted', 'film', 'have', 'many', 'prejudices', 'hold', 'dear', 'have', 'problem', 'openly', 'expressing', 'how', 'feel.Several', 'different', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'film', 'focus', 'controversies', 'problems', 'stereotyping', 'certain', 'individuals', 'are', 'people', 'movie', 'who', 'hold', 'prejudices', 'blacks', 'Hispanics', 'women', 'other', 'groups', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'several', 'times', 'where', 'have', 'opportunity', 'shake', 'off', 'negative', 'feelings', 'other', 'people', 'Sometimes', 'successfully', 'remove', 'negative', 'mindset', 'Other', 'times', 'feelings', 'prejudice', 'are', 'compounded', 'further.One', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'lack', 'predictability', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'film', 'away', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'slowing', 'down', 'getting', 'little', 'repetitive', 'racial', 'talk', 'then', 'nowhere', 'something', 'hits', 'ton', 'bricks', 'more', 'once', 'greatly', 'movie', 'appeal.Another', 'asset', 'film', 'all-', 'star', 'cast', 'others', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'director', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'timing', 'emotions', 'great', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'actresses', 'contribute', 'top-', 'notch', 'performances', 'film', 'Crash', 'thinking', 'person', 'film', 'many', 'strong', 'points', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'watching', 'ended', 'up', 'discussing', 'film', 'finer', 'points', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'watched', 'discussed', 'topic', 'racism', 'stereotyping', 'how', 'easily', 'way', 'thinking', 'can', 'manifest', 'most', 'person', 'how', 'can', 'adversely', 'affect', 'one', 'life', 'how', 'difficult', 'eliminate', 'film', 'can', 'make', 'think', 'way', 'movie', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'creative', 'thought-', 'provoking', 'cinema']",Crash

Magnolia deftly fused seemingly disparate emotional life situations of different characters, and at the end (with the music slowly evolving to not unlike a sad denouement but with closure and purpose), every character realizes that they are all part of the big circle of life.  The ending of Magnolia involves a weird scene of falling animals, shocking and at the same time, mysterious, like the movie that it portrays.'Crash' on the other hand is more hard-core and deals mainly with the interaction of races in the proverbially diverse Southern California.  We see the interaction of everyday people with cops, high power politicians with cops and everyday people, minorities that mingle with the society and how the seemingly 'white' establishment view them, when they are backed into a corner, or how the same establishment uses them to further their own agendas.  'Crash' is a rich 'melting pot' of hidden norms that can only excite people who live in diverse neighborhoods.  While it allows racial situations to provide closure, the movie seems trite, seems forced, and seems almost preachy (check Ludacris' almost incessant banterings).  We have cops who redeem themselves, but we also have cops who cause more pain in the process of helping these 'misguided' minorities.Race relations is a powerful agenda, and Crash uses it to the extreme.  Sometimes, it does overdo and overkill the obvious, and we are left wondering whether we live in such a disparate country of cultures or are we merely pawns to racial hysteria and we are left blind to the minority struggle of having 'to belong'.Go see ""Magnolia"" and compare the movie styling.

Instead, it is a complex and multi-faceted reflection on multicultural urban America.First, we see a wonderful ensemble cast coursing through Los Angeles isolating themselves from all but those most closest to them. Going from house to car and back again, they ignore those who are different from them and could care less about their ignorance. It's easier and less work for them to rely on stereotypes and hypocrisy than to involve themselves with those they are forced to encounter as individuals.Second, This is not a movie about white racism or black and white relations. Instead it deals with the bigotry and prejudices which exists within all ethnic groups. Whites have fear and contempt for blacks. Blacks have animosity for Asians. Asians look down on Westerners. Etc.What makes this an exceptionally well made and acted movie is the way it treats the issue of racism and alienation. Nothing is simple, not even racism. Ludicrous and Lorenz Tate gripe about the way young black men are seen as thugs right before they carjack Sandra Bullock. Ryan Phillipe plays a cop who can no longer deal with his partner's (Matt Dillon) racist attitude which is escalating with the increased stress and pressure from having to cope with a dying father and lousy medical care. However, in the end it is the ""racist"" cop who risks his life to save a black woman (Thandie Newton), while the other cop, in a seperate scene, falls back upon latent prejudices and fears which he very self-righteously didn't think he had for the black man.This is the kind of movie which forces you to confront the bigotry that is not only inside you but in that guy walking by you or standing next to you in line. It makes you realize the baggage we carry from childhood about everybody who looks differently from us and vice versa.

The acting is spectacular and the whole movie is some of the best drama I have ever seen. In fact I can find only one fault with it, and that is replayability. That is only because it is so realistic that when I walk down the street here in Washington D.C. I can see the same issues. Forgive me if this realism is not something I want to see in a movie on a regular basis. It stares me in the face everyday and I am not blind. This is a great movie to see once, but not something I would go back and review on a regular basis. So I highly recommned it for a rental but you need to be a great fan of drama and the darker side of human nature and society to be a steady watcher. I'm guessing this is like the ""Butterfly Effect"" in showing how what one person does can impact many other lives and our mental conditioning based on not only what we are taught but what we learn first hand. One excellent example is the case of the white girl grabbing her husbands arm and moving closer to him when two black men approach them on the street. She has been taught that they are more likely to attack them because of what she hears on the media and from her social group. The irony is they do in fact attack them and reinforce her fear. What is almost funny is the black mens conversation before they attack and one is resentful that the girl draws away from them before in fact they commit the kind of crime that they are stereotyped or profiled for. Just a great job of showing how we are foolish and not so foolish for developing our defense mechanisms when dealing with others. What is truly bold is showing that whites are not the only racist. Racism runs in all colors and cultures and this movie shows that. It gives examples of how some will complain about how they are treated and then be hypocritical and degrade another race and culture. It puts us in touch with the fact that we ""ALL""  need to get beyond the hypocrisy if we are going to work out the problems that are truly important like overcoming the violence and especially killing. I personally will take someone stereotyping me and calling me names over being shot any day thank you very much. Four more shot here on the street yesterday.

You'll be glad you did.By the time this year's Academy Awards took place, this was the only one of the five films nominated for Best Picture that I had not seen. ""Brokeback Mountain"" was the sentimental favorite as well as my own personal fave, natch. Yet I had been hearing vague rumblings that if any film was going to pull off an upset, ""Crash"" would be the one to do it. Sure enough, that's what happened, and after watching this film at last, I understand why.One cannot overlook the importance of storytelling in a film, and unfortunately ""Brokeback Mountain,"" as moving as it was, was hampered by a rather slender story.

920343,A2FNA5903D9E6Y,B000A3XY5A,Carol Toscano,"[4, 8]","Though we are all familiar with prejudices in one form or another (honestly, we all have something), I think that the overload of steady prejudicial events in the film might be overwhelming to some viewers (however realistic the events are in different contexts).  What I think this film captures best is the isolation of modern life that we all experience from time to time (or more regularly for others).  I think the people in LA, in general, experience more isolation in their daily lives than in other places in the country (not that we don't experience it in New York City as well - it's just that in NYC, it's in a different form - mostly by choice).  The first time I ever went to LA, I was shocked that at 10 p.m. on a Friday night, the streets were virtually empty, that you absolutely needed a car to get anywhere, that there wasn't much interaction amongst people just walking around on the street in the downtown area.  It was very different to me than what I was used to (and I'm guessing that people from out of New York City might have some opinions about New York too).Though there is a decent amount of individual redemption in the film, something that struck me (that I haven't seen any other recent reviewer mention) is that the words ""I'm sorry"" are spoken only three times of the course of the entire film.  Officer Ryan says it twice (once to the HMO lady - actually he says he apologizes, not technically ""I'm sorry"" in that instance - because he needs something from her and once for saying the f-word while trying to pull Thandie Newton's character out of the burning SUV).  The only other time is when Thandie Newton's character says it to her husband for her reaction to his behavior (or lack of) while they are being harassed and molested by Officer Ryan.  From a writing standpoint, I thought that it was really insightful and smart to show redemption in ways that don't require words like ""I'm sorry.""  Though many people would choose the burning car scene as the most powerful and emotionally redemptive scene, for me, there are two other scenes that recognize redemption in a more intimate, less public format (because I think that true redemption comes from within).  In one scene, Sandra Bullock's character tells her maid she's the best friend she has.  And in another, Officer Ryan takes care of his very ill father (the scene where he kisses his father on the head).As for the burning SUV scene, I was impressed mostly by the how the scene looked - how realistic the sun setting in the west looked in the background and its affect on the viewer.  For me, the sunset reflecting off of the dusty windshield reminded me of early morning driving east and the sun hitting the glass a certain way and no matter what you do - visor, sunglasses - you can't fight it.  There's this hazy blur that takes over at sunrise and sunset and that, combined with the orange of the flames and the subtly sun-silhouetted (and terrified) Thandie Newton gives a very authentic feel to the scene.  Not to mention that the light also makes Officer Ryan look a lot more severe and intense than he appears in any other scene in the film.  You can see every line in his face, every detail - not many actors would do that - it's visually remarkable.To end, this is a noteworthy film with some uncomfortable observations about modern life.

You need the larger at the base before you reach the top.  It is also how you build a plausible story.In this film we learn that most white cops are bad, most black people are paranoid, and most prejudices are suddenly caught like a flu bug, instead of built over through one's life from childhood to adulthood.  The cast is great but the script gets so out of control that none of it even seems realistic.  Bullock's character can be seen as plausible, but then again it tries to build larger plots from a rant she has in the kitchen about the repairman's tattoos.

920345,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000A3XY5A,C. B Collins Jr.,"[8, 13]","This is a great film which I would strongly recommend. It is actually a very brave film because it is willing to deal with the issues of racial tension, bias and stereotyping, and the violence that can result.There are several important themes and I want to comment on several of them.First, violence comes in many shapes. This film does a wonderful job of showing the range of violence.  We see violence to self in an addicted African American mother who can't control her teenage son. We see homicidal violence when an Iranian almost kills a little Latina girl or when an off-duty Anglo police officer accidentally kills an adolescent African American car thief. We see everyday violence when an African American claims agent for an HMO refuses to help an elderly white man in pain because his racist son gets confrontive with her. We see deep long lasting violence as this police officer humiliates a wealthy African American TV executive and his wife, putting a strain on their relationship that could end their marriage. Sandra Bullock plays a cold upper-class woman who commits violence through class oppression and demeaning comments to her well-meaning Latina maid. A group of Chinese illegal immigrants are left for hours in a locked truck and are almost sold as slaves. A public relations campaign manager is willing to frame a white police officer for murder of an off-duty crack using Black police officer to make the district attorney look pro-Black by prosecuting him. Violence can be planned or spontaneous. Violence can be overt or covert. Violence can be against the body or the soul. Violence can be against an individual or a people. This film is full of violence, showing some of the roots and some of the consequences.Second, we resort to stereotypes when we are under pressure. Matt Dillion is almost crazy with concern for his elderly father in chronic pain who can't get proper services from his HMO, so he erupts at the African American claims officer and when he is shut off, he seeks revenge on a wealthy Black couple. Shaun Toub plays an Iranian shop keeper who when vandalized with anti-Islamic graphetti and loses his business, attempts to kill the Latino locksmith with whom he argued the day before. Ryan Phillippe pays a liberal police officer who panics and kills an adolescent Black delinquent he picked up as a hitch hiker.Third, life catches us sometimes at our best and sometimes at our worst. Matt Dillion and Terrance Dashon Howard are incredible actors as they show this in a white police officer and a Black TV executive. Dillion gropes Howard's beautiful wife after stopping them for no reason - demeaning the husband in front of his wife and demeaning the wife in front of the husband. However later, Dillion rescues the wife, Thandie Newton, from a burning car, putting his own life at risk. Howard absorbs the insult of seeing his wife groped but is driven to the edge by his TV show Director (Tony Lanza)and then finally goes over the edge when two Black car thieves try to car jack him. Ryan Phillippe is caught at his best, resisting his police partner's influence and calming Howard down when he has become homicidal with rage. Yet even Ryan, set up as a liberal clear headed hero, commits a terrible accidental crime becuase of snap judgement assumptions.Fourth, the film tells us we can be at our best when we work across the sterotype and attribute goodness and badness to individuals at specific points in time, not to entire lives and to entire races or peoples.I gave this film 5 stars for outright bravery.",5,Brave film-making,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,3563,"['great', 'film', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'actually', 'very', 'brave', 'film', 'willing', 'deal', 'issues', 'racial', 'tension', 'bias', 'stereotyping', 'violence', 'can', 'result.There', 'are', 'several', 'important', 'themes', 'want', 'comment', 'several', 'them.First', 'violence', 'many', 'shapes', 'film', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'range', 'violence', 'see', 'violence', 'self', 'addicted', 'African', 'American', 'mother', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'teenage', 'son', 'see', 'homicidal', 'violence', 'when', 'Iranian', 'almost', 'little', 'Latina', 'girl', 'when', 'off-duty', 'Anglo', 'police', 'officer', 'accidentally', 'adolescent', 'African', 'American', 'car', 'thief', 'see', 'everyday', 'violence', 'when', 'African', 'American', 'claims', 'agent', 'HMO', 'help', 'elderly', 'white', 'man', 'pain', 'racist', 'son', 'confrontive', 'see', 'deep', 'long', 'lasting', 'violence', 'police', 'officer', 'wealthy', 'African', 'American', 'TV', 'executive', 'wife', 'putting', 'strain', 'relationship', 'could', 'end', 'marriage', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'cold', 'upper-class', 'woman', 'who', 'violence', 'class', 'oppression', 'demeaning', 'comments', 'well-meaning', 'Latina', 'maid', 'group', 'Chinese', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'are', 'left', 'hours', 'locked', 'truck', 'are', 'almost', 'sold', 'slaves', 'public', 'relations', 'campaign', 'manager', 'willing', 'frame', 'white', 'police', 'officer', 'murder', 'off-duty', 'crack', 'using', 'Black', 'police', 'officer', 'make', 'district', 'attorney', 'look', 'pro-Black', 'prosecuting', 'Violence', 'can', 'be', 'planned', 'spontaneous', 'Violence', 'can', 'be', 'overt', 'covert', 'Violence', 'can', 'be', 'body', 'soul', 'Violence', 'can', 'be', 'individual', 'people', 'film', 'full', 'violence', 'showing', 'roots', 'consequences.Second', 'resort', 'stereotypes', 'when', 'are', 'pressure', 'Matt', 'Dillion', 'almost', 'crazy', 'concern', 'elderly', 'father', 'chronic', 'pain', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'proper', 'services', 'HMO', 'African', 'American', 'claims', 'officer', 'when', 'shut', 'off', 'revenge', 'wealthy', 'Black', 'couple', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'Iranian', 'shop', 'keeper', 'who', 'when', 'vandalized', 'anti-Islamic', 'graphetti', 'business', 'attempts', 'kill', 'Latino', 'locksmith', 'whom', 'argued', 'day', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'liberal', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'panics', 'adolescent', 'Black', 'delinquent', 'picked', 'up', 'hitch', 'hiker.Third', 'life', 'catches', 'sometimes', 'best', 'sometimes', 'worst', 'Matt', 'Dillion', 'Terrance', 'Dashon', 'Howard', 'are', 'incredible', 'actors', 'show', 'white', 'police', 'officer', 'Black', 'TV', 'executive', 'Dillion', 'Howard', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'stopping', 'reason', 'demeaning', 'husband', 'front', 'wife', 'demeaning', 'wife', 'front', 'husband', 'However', 'later', 'Dillion', 'wife', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'burning', 'car', 'putting', 'own', 'life', 'risk', 'Howard', 'insult', 'seeing', 'wife', 'groped', 'driven', 'edge', 'TV', 'show', 'Director', 'Tony', 'Lanza', 'then', 'finally', 'edge', 'when', 'two', 'Black', 'car', 'thieves', 'try', 'car', 'jack', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'caught', 'best', 'resisting', 'police', 'partner', 'influence', 'calming', 'Howard', 'down', 'when', 'become', 'homicidal', 'rage', 'even', 'Ryan', 'set', 'up', 'liberal', 'clear', 'headed', 'hero', 'terrible', 'accidental', 'crime', 'becuase', 'snap', 'judgement', 'assumptions.Fourth', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'when', 'work', 'sterotype', 'attribute', 'goodness', 'badness', 'individuals', 'specific', 'points', 'time', 'not', 'entire', 'lives', 'entire', 'races', 'peoples.I', 'gave', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'outright', 'bravery']",Crash
920346,A1MVLC8E5WJDD3,B000A3XY5A,C. Boerger,"[36, 50]","With some movies, I can tell within the first minute or two that I am going to hate them. Crash is one of those movies, it commits two of the cardinal sins of filmmaking right off the bat. Sin number one: lousy new age music that tries to be spiritual and meaningful, as if to inform the viewer, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FILM. Sin number two: the movie starts with a laughably bad voiceover, an inane attempt at profound philosophy, always a sign that a movie takes itself far too seriously(trust me on this, folks, I used to write bad screenplays in my spare time, I'm as guilty as anyone of this amateur's mistake, but I was never nominated for an Oscar). In this case, it's Don Cheadle speculating that people in Los Angeles intentionally get in car wrecks in order to experience contact with others. That's right, it's not bad driving, it's some existential search for connection. Apparently people in New York never have automobile accidents because, as a pedestrian culture, they brush up against other people on a daily basis. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Unfortunately, the first couple of minutes is a harbinger of things to come. Crash is one of the worst films I've ever seen.In the early '90's, the great Robert Altman made Short Cuts, a brilliant, jarring and subversive look at present day angst, ennui, malaise, anomie, and any other fashionable term you can come up with to describe disaffection and emotional chaos. The film was set in Los Angeles and culminated in an earthquake, which was a great metaphor for entropy as well as a method for tying all the disparate characters together through a common experience. A few years later, P.T. Barnum, excuse me, P.T. Anderson ripped off Short Cuts with Magnolia. Magnolia was terribly over the top, but what it lacked in subtlety it at least partially made up for in chutzpah. For instance, instead of an earthquake, Anderson threw in a biblical shower of frogs. Magnolia wasn't a very good film, but at least it had enough style to compensate for its screaming characters and heavyhanded analysis of human nature. Now we have Crash, yet another film about lost and lonely Los Angeleans meandering about, their lives intersecting through a series of coincidences. Instead of an earthquake, or frogs, we get a snowstorm to wrap things up, the purity of snow signifying hope, get it? Well, the third time is not the charm. Crash is a hand me down of a hand me down, watered down Altman by way of Anderson by way of Paul Haggis, only Haggis ups the ante by making his film about race relations, which is part of the problem in reviewing this film.See, I think that one of the reasons this film is so highly acclaimed is that critics are afraid to puncture a movie that earnestly tackles an important issue. Make no mistake, racism IS an important issue, TOO important to be reduced to a bunch of one-dimensional characters, bad dialogue and contrived situations, all neatly wrapped up and delivered in a package so obvious it wears its self-importance on its sleeve. An issue as complex as racism needs a movie just as complex, because racism,and racial mistrust, are insidious things, they internalize themselves while spreading, hiding instead of expressing themselves openly in every single word of dialogue. But try telling that to Haggis. Racism is all his people talk about, and, in effect, his film comes off as one long, boring public service announcement.But you can tell that Haggis thinks Crash is a great, arty and important film. He certainly wants it to be. He went to the P.T. Anderson school of drama and dialogue, apparently, because Crash is loaded with scenes of people screaming at each other, using the F-word at least once in every sentence. Sheltered screenwriters(and movie critics) who spend their whole lives watching movies(most of which are bad) think that this makes a film gritty and realistic. It doesn't. It just makes the movie shrill and annoying. None of these people are real, therefore the situations are unreal, therefore the social commentary is diluted. Haggis shortchanges the subject of racism by attempting to explore it in such a trivial context.Still, the hype machine rolls on. Crash was even nominated for best picture(probably because the Academy is populated by a bunch of guilt-ridden Los Angeleans). If it wins, it might well be the worst film ever to get the award, even worse than Titanic, Gladiator and Shakespeare In Love.Crash isn't daring, it's the exact opposite, totally safe, and its lionization has set back the cause of serious-minded, socially-conscious filmmaking at least a couple of decades.",1,Utter nonsense,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,4604,"['movies', 'can', 'tell',

920347,A38F6UBQJI9QG1,B000A3XY5A,"C. Copeland ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 3]","Genre: DramaGenre Grade: A+Final Grade: A+This movie was brilliant, breathtaking, and simply beautiful. Paul Haggis should be considered a master in the ranks of Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) and Clint Eastwood (Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby). Haggis actually wrote the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby which proved he had incredible talent at writing. But in his first stab at directing since 1993 (he was an unknown then) he showed us he knows how to paint a tragic picture of humanity and show us characters that have real issues.The acting was incredible, especially from Sandra Bullock (whom I hope searches out more serious roles in the future - she was brilliant), Ryan Phillippe, Thandie Newton (Oscar-worthy performance), Terrance Howard, and suprisingly enough - Ludacris (yeah, the rapper). He gave a great performance in this film and I hope he continues his movie career.This film focuses on the subject of racism, and is the best film to do so since American History X. It throws so many punches at so many ethnic groups and so many racial tensions in this country that it brings itself above being just an enjoyable (though painful) film, but it is an important film that we could all learn a lesson from.As you probably noticed, I gave this film an A+, which is something I don't hand out lightly. The only thing that I could say negatively about this film is its extreme similarities to Magnolia (which ultimately is still a greater film than Crash only because of its bizarre yet poetic madness , which this film lacks). Both films center around coincidences and what brings people together, and both films have unusual things falling from the sky at the end of the film. However, it didn't feel like he was stealing. If anything I think Haggis was paying tribute to Magnolia, but he gave this film his own personal touch and gave a new and unique story that makes us all wish we understood the world a little better.I recommend this film to everyone, I think mainstream audiences have the capacity to enjoy this film because of its mainstream feel. I will caution though, this film has some extremely disturbing scenes and some very harsh characters and plot points.",5,Best Film of 2005 (So Far)...,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,2209,"['Genre', 'DramaGenre', 'Grade', 'A+Final', 'Grade', 'A+This', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'breathtaking', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'master', 'ranks', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Haggis', 'actually', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'proved', 'had', 'incredible', 'talent', 'writing', 'first', 'stab', 'directing', '1993', 'was', 'unknown', 'then', 'showed', 'how', 'paint', 'tragic', 'picture', 'humanity', 'show', 'characters', 'have', 'real', 'issues.The', 'acting', 'was', 'incredible', 'especially', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'whom', 'hope', 'searches', 'out', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'future', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'suprisingly', 'enough', 'Ludacris', 'yeah', 'rapper', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'film', 'hope', 'movie', 'career.This', 'film', 'subject', 'racism', 'best', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'so', 'many', 'punches', 'so', 'many', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'so', 'many', 'racial', 'tensions', 'country', 'being', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'painful', 'film', 'important', 'film', 'could', 'learn', 'lesson', 'from.As', 'probably', 'noticed', 'gave', 'film', 'A+', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'hand', 'out', 'lightly', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'say', 'negatively', 'film', 'extreme', 'similarities', 'Magnolia', 'ultimately', 'still', 'greater', 'film', 'Crash', 'only', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'poetic', 'madness', 'film', 'films', 'center', 'coincidences', 'what', 'people', 'together', 'films', 'have', 'unusual', 'things', 'falling', 'sky', 'end', 'film', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'stealing', 'anything', 'think', 'Haggis', 'was', 'paying', 'tribute', 'Magnolia', 'gave', 'film', 'own', 'personal', 'touch', 'gave', 'new', 'unique', 'story', 'wish', 'understood', 'world', 'little', 'better.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'think', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'have', 'capacity', 'enjoy', 'film', 'mainstream', 'feel', 'will', 'caution', 'film', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'very', 'harsh', 'characters', 'plot', 'points']",Crash

I pointed to movies that had received Academy Award nominations in the last several years to indicate that this standard no longer reflects what it used to. Many nominated movies are indeed very good, but an Academy Award nomination it seems ought to go to movies that are truly exceptional and highly impactful.Crash is an exceptional movie. You will certainly be unable to watch it without discussing it excitedly and thoroughly afterwards. There are excellent reviews written here to tell you what this movie is about. I will not do that here. I however choose to highlight brilliant writing, superb acting and wonderful directing (reminiscent of the work done by Paul Thomas Anderson in Magnolia). The vignettes are rich, deep and beautifully woven together.Crash is highly impactful. You may find youself questioning ""what is racism""? You will be forced to see how extreme prejudice can coexist with abundant compassion and courage. It can be uncomfortable to reflect upon. Not unlike the uncomfortable combination of extreme violence and belly shaking comedy that are produced in some moments during Quetin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Furthermore, Crash may make you think about the importance of moderation. Must you always say what you feel and think? What is the right balance so that you do not go through life choosing never to express yourself? For the one character that did exercise moderation in Crash, look at the irony in terms of what was forced into his life that was certainly not of his choosing. So is moderation enough?I echo the sentiments of one reviewer when she says that she hopes that this film will inspire film makers to produce work of this caliber. This is high art! Not everyone has the ability to produce something like this. However, I hope that the Academy of Motion Pictures recognizes Crash by nominating it  for the best picture award. It might inspire the few that have this level of talent to produce extraordinary work and it will recognize the film Crash and Director Paul Haggis for brilliance.",5,Exceptional movie making,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2162,"['was', 'talking', 'wife', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'how', 'felt', 'quality', 'impact', 'movies', 'was', 'diminishing', 'time', 'pointed', 'movies', 'had', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'indicate', 'standard', 'longer', 'what', 'used', 'Many', 'nominated', 'movies', 'are', 'indeed', 'very', 'good', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'ought', 'go', 'movies', 'are', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'highly', 'impactful.Crash', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'unable', 'watch', 'discussing', 'excitedly', 'thoroughly', 'afterwards', 'are', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'written', 'here', 'tell', 'what', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'here', 'however', 'choose', 'highlight', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'superb', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'directing', 'reminiscent', 'work', 'done', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Magnolia', 'vignettes', 'are', 'rich', 'deep', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'together.Crash', 'highly', 'impactful', 'may', 'find', 'questioning', 'what', 'racism', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'see', 'how', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'can', 'coexist', 'abundant', 'compassion', 'courage', 'can', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'reflect', 'upon', 'Not', 'uncomfortable', 'combination', 'extreme', 'violence', 'belly', 'shaking', 'comedy', 'are', 'produced', 'moments', 'Quetin', 'Tarantino', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Furthermore', 'Crash', 'may', 'make', 'think', 'importance', 'moderation', 'Must', 'always', 'say', 'what', 'feel', 'think', 'What', 'right', 'balance', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'life', 'choosing', 'never', 'express', 'one', 'character', 'did', 'exercise', 'moderation', 'Crash', 'look', 'irony', 'terms', 'what', 'was', 'forced', 'life', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'choosing', 'moderation', 'enough', 'echo', 'sentiments', 'one', 'reviewer', 'when', 'film', 'will', 'inspire', 'film', 'makers', 'produce', 'work', 'caliber', 'high', 'art', 'Not', 'everyone', 'ability', 'produce', 'something', 'However', 'hope', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Pictures', 'Crash', 'nominating', 'best', 'picture', 'award', 'might', 'inspire', 'few', 'have', 'level', 'talent', 'produce', 'extraordinary', 'work', 'will', 'recognize', 'film', 'Crash', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'brilliance']",Crash

But this movie fails on too many levels to be considered a great film, much less a worthy Oscar winner.The movie is far too contrived and artificial, especially the way the same characters keep meeting up in extreme circumstances. For example, the racist white cop (Matt Dillon) sexually gropes a black woman (Thandie Newton) one evening and then the very next day he saves her life in a car accident. How likely is that? Los Angeles is a big city after all and contrived plot devices like this are simply weak and unskilled filmmaking. Also the characters come across more as racial symbols rather than real people. The characters dialogue is very forced and not at all the way normal people communicate in daily life.I especially had a problem with the way certain characters were developed. For instance, Terrence Howard plays an educated, successful black TV director who goes from being an ""Uncle Tom"" to an ""Angry Black Man"" during the course of the movie. Why is it that intelligent, middle class black males are so often depicted as ""sellouts"" who have to ""de-masculate"" themselves in order to make it in mainstream society? Many strong, well educated black men succeed as doctors, lawyers, engineers and college professors without having to turn into gutless phonies. But instead our media and society choose to depict all the failures - the gang bangers, crack heads and prisoners - as more authentically ""black"". To me this is the worst sort of racist drivel and it's a shame this movie only serves to further promote these false stereotypes. Also the Iranian business owner (Shaun Toub) is shown to be a confused, angry immigrant who lashes out in violence at that which he doesn't understand.

920359,A2S0PELQX7R57K,B000A3XY5A,"Chris Stoner ""Bibliophile""","[1, 2]","For those who think that this movie is just saying, ""Hey, racism is bad,"" they are truly missing the point.  If CRASH has a message, it would be something like ""Racism is complicated"" or ""Racism is inescapable"" or ""Racism isn't only for white folks.""  But even those ideas fall short.  CRASH is less a message film than a character study writ large.  It presents a number of characters from various racial and class backgrounds, and then lets them develop before the audience's eyes.  None of the characters is simple.  No matter how flat or one-sided they may seem to be at any point in the film, each is given one or more moments to change unexpectedly and show additional facets to their personality.Sandra Bullock's character is a perfect example.  If there was ever any doubt that Bullock could do ""serious"" work as well as she does screwball comedy, this film easily dispels it.  Bullock's character seems to fall too easily into the stereotype of the upper-class racist WASP, leveling prejudice at any minority who crosses her path. She is utterly dislikable; in fact, that is the point.  Bullock, along with Matt Dillon's character, are set up early to be the film's idealogical villains.  But as the narrative progresses, we see these characters in greater depth, with new contexts.  Just as the films ""heroes"" begin to show weaknesses and moral failings, the ""villains"" gain potentially noble traits.  By the time we get near the end of the film and witness Bullock clutching at her housekeeper and confessing her lonliness, we can feel the sadness of her limited life.  We don't have to like her, and most viewers probably won't but ""liking"" her or not again misses the point.  The point is that life isn't so easily divided into heroes and villains.We all have blind spots and prejudices.  We all have the capacity for nobility, and for debasement.  We all struggle for connection and to be understood.  CRASH insists that every one of its characters be seen at their best and at their worst.  It doesn't solve anything, or even offer ideas for a solution; that's why CRASH isn't really a message film.  Rather it creates a world where characters aren't classifiable as ""good"" people or ""bad"" people.  A complicated world where people have to be met where they are at, by viewers who are forced to confront where they are at.  This sort of blatent honesty is uncomfortable for many, but it's important in the complicated, multifaceted world we live in.",5,A Complex and Intelligent Look at the Intricacies of Race and Class,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,2464,"['who', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'saying', 'Hey', 'racism', 'bad', 'are', 'truly', 'missing', 'point', 'CRASH', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'Racism', 'complicated', 'Racism', 'inescapable', 'Racism', ""n't"", 'only', 'white', 'folks', 'even', 'ideas', 'fall', 'short', 'CRASH', 'less', 'message', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'writ', 'large', 'number', 'characters', 'various', 'racial', 'class', 'backgrounds', 'then', 'develop', 'audience', 'eyes', 'None', 'characters', 'simple', 'matter', 'how', 'flat', 'one-sided', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'point', 'film', 'given', 'one', 'more', 'moments', 'change', 'unexpectedly', 'show', 'additional', 'facets', 'personality.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'character', 'perfect', 'example', 'was', 'ever', 'doubt', 'Bullock', 'could', 'do', 'serious', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'film', 'easily', 'Bullock', 'character', 'fall', 'too', 'easily', 'stereotype', 'upper-class', 'racist', 'WASP', 'leveling', 'prejudice', 'minority', 'who', 'path', 'utterly', 'dislikable', 'fact', 'point', 'Bullock', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'character', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'early', 'be', 'film', 'idealogical', 'villains', 'narrative', 'progresses', 'see', 'characters', 'greater', 'depth', 'new', 'contexts', 'Just', 'films', 'heroes', 'begin', 'show', 'weaknesses', 'moral', 'failings', 'villains', 'gain', 'potentially', 'noble', 'traits', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'film', 'witness', 'Bullock', 'clutching', 'housekeeper', 'confessing', 'lonliness', 'can', 'feel', 'sadness', 'limited', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'most', 'viewers', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'liking', 'not', 'again', 'point', 'point', 'life', ""n't"", 'so', 'easily', 'divided', 'heroes', 'villains.We', 'have', 'blind', 'spots', 'prejudices', 'have', 'capacity', 'nobility', 'debasement', 'struggle', 'connection', 'be', 'understood', 'CRASH', 'one', 'characters', 'be', 'seen', 'best', 'worst', ""n't"", 'solve', 'anything', 'even', 'offer', 'ideas', 'solution', 'why', 'CRASH', ""n't"", 'really', 'message', 'film', 'world', 'where', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'classifiable', 'good', 'people', 'bad', 'people', 'complicated', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'be', 'met', 'where', 'are', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'where', 'are', 'sort', 'blatent', 'honesty', 'uncomfortable', 'many', 'important', 'complicated', 'multifaceted', 'world', 'live']",Crash

Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito are detectives who are sleeping together and investigating the shooting of a black cop by a white cop. Brendan Fraser is the DA who is car jacked and Sandra Bullock his uppity wife who is angry at the world. There is the middle eastern family trying to make a living running a small store and then it is broken into and vandalized. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton are a well-off black couple who are pulled over for no reason by Matt Dillon's racist cop. There are other stories as well and they all criss-cross throughout the movie.One of the problems is how often they criss-cross. That kind of thing works in a screw-ball comedy, but not necessarily in a very serious, message movie like this. It all seems like a set-up in the end. Also sometimes the message is delivered a little heavily, like the film makers felt they needed to shout, 'this is the message, pay attention'.

920367,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000A3XY5A,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","Crash will probably go down in history as not the film that won Best Picture 2005 but the worst Best Picture winner ever, in close competition with Around the World in 80 Days. For many, it's a socially important film and deserved its accolades, especially since it had a kind of indie-film feel with small budgets and a more performance-geared approach rather than big effects. In the end it's probably a film that shouldn't have won(I would've gone with Munich) but it's not a bad film nonetheless, it's just several flawed at times upset by some memorable scenes.In probably one of the most credibility stretching 24 hours I've ever seen, a whole host of people are somehow interwoven in L.A and they all have one thing in common: they all have to deal with racism in one form or another. You get 2 policemen, a TV director and his wife, 2 philosophy wannabe black guys, a D.A and his wife, 2 cops/lovers and many others that are somehow connected to other. Guy 1 hangs out with guy 2 who has to deal with woman 1 who's married to guy 1. By the end of it, you think everyone is going to get into a reunion.I would like the film's view on racism if it didn't shoot itself in the foot half the time. One scene, a black guy is ranting about a girl who flinched at seeing them walking towards them, however she was just cold, but he thinks she saw gangmembers. Well this would have weight if they didn't just carjack the couple 5 minutes later. Or the mexican locksmith who has to deal with a stubborn store owner only to not have insurance covered when the store's broken into. The film is saying ""see? racism is the problem there"" but I know better: it was a moronic store owner who didn't see the forest for the trees.It does have some memorable scenes though. The scene with a police officer saving a woman's life in a soon-to-be fireball car is cool as well as the ""cloak"" scene involving a fired gun and a young girl, but it's mainly for Michael Pena's performance, and not for the kind of contrived feel of it. They're a bit too similar as they're basically music-only with dialogue cut completely out but they're effective scenes anyways. And it's great to see Jennifer Esposito in her um, slightly full glory, although Don Cheadle may not be your ideal bed partner.Speaking of which, the cast is excellent but the performances are slightly marginal at best. They seem to exist to get the anti-racism messages across and they become merely vehicles to show off society's dark side. They're not really characters or people, except some of the cast works. But with such a big cast you're expecting a bit more than characters firing off every racist comment and slur you can think of. In fact, Ludacris' character seems like a spokesperson for anti-racism. I kept getting reminded the entire time of Mr Mackey from South Park and his ""drugs are bad, mmkay?"" speech.

There were like 5 guys in there, and none of us was the same race.  Needless to say our blood started to boil immediately at the sight of an 'other', and the tension in the room became enormous.  We were in the middle of a bloodbath in less than a minute.  I have little recollection of the next few minutes, until I found myself sitting in the midst of an enormous pile of blood and limbs-- the racial hatred was so intense that I blacked out, more or less.  Me and one other guy were still alive, the other 3 torn limb from limb.  The black xenophobic hatred was not dissipated at all, but we rested briefly, feeding on the flesh of out mangled enemies, preparing for our final bout for racial supremacy.  Then, as I sucked the blood from one of my victims via the carotid artery I glanced over the scattered pile of DVDs and noticed a number of copies of Paul Haggis' 'Crash' scattered about the floor.  I'd seen this movie, but more or less forgotten about it.  Seeing it now I was filled with insight and deep sorrow.  I dropped the corpse, than stood up and let out a primal scream of despair.  This aroused my enemy, and he discarded his meal  and bared his bloody maw at me.  I fell to my knees and gasped ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS NOT HOW PAUL HAGGIS WANTS US TO BEHAVE!!!!!!! RACISM IS BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""  I feared my impending death, though I was calm with my final epiphany before my eternal slumber.  I waited for my doom, then looked at my former enemy again; he was in tears.  He had seen 'Crash' as well, and now he understood.  Understood all, late, yes late, but not too late.

Middleton,"[1, 5]","When watching this film, two thoughts came to mind, first the Buddhist metaphor for life, that is to say, existence is a large tapestry, and we the threads of the tapestry, intertwined and interconnected, and that any of our actions, can affect the whole. The other thought was the early 90's film, Six Degrees of Separation; a young Will Smith plays the prostitute con man, affecting the lives of a wealthy Manhattan family. The premise being that none of us are separated more than six degrees, and that our actions or non-actions has a ripple effect to others, perhaps those we've never met. In other words, we are all connected. Crash has many other themes, including violence in modern society fuelled by the constant undercurrent of racism. It is understandable why this film was so controversial upon its release, as it is pretty hard-edged, and explores a few touchy issues that are topical and will continue to be so in the future.The film begins with Don Cheadle, a police detective, commenting that the people in L.A. never make contact or touch each other because they're always travelling by car, -""separated by glass and steel""- and communication only occurs when their vehicles crash into each other. There's been a car pile-up on the freeway and his partner is having a heated argument with an Asian woman. The scene changes and we see two relatively well-dressed, young African- Americans, having an intelligent conversation about racism. They are walking through a predominately white upper-class suburb in L.A., one of the men observe that the white people around them appear to be scared of them, and that they are the one's who should be scared, when the other asks, ""So why aren't we scared?"" ""Because we have guns!"" Suddenly both pull out pistols and commit a car jacking, the victims just happen to be the District Attorney of L.A. and his wife.The story continues focusing on the lives of a Persian storeowner and his family, an African-American television director and his beautiful wife; a Mexican American locksmith; a racist cop and his rookie partner and a Korean couple whose activities in the film is revealed at the end and is quite surprising.Paul Haggis wrote and directed this film and cleverly connects the characters lives, where their individual actions, either directly or indirectly has a great effect on their respective views of themselves and the people around them. In other words, despite living behind ""glass and steel"", our lives are destined to collide.As I believe this film is a realistic view of modern urban life, for the most part, however, is a tragedy, because despite existing side by side, we continue to be alienated, though connected as human beings, affecting each other personally, and forced to communicate only through fear, violence and...unexpected collision.Crash is an excellent film.",5,When souls collide...,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,2852,"['When', 'watching', 'film', 'two', 'thoughts', 'came', 'mind', 'first', 'Buddhist', 'metaphor', 'life', 'say', 'existence', 'large', 'tapestry', 'threads', 'tapestry', 'intertwined', 'interconnected', 'actions', 'can', 'affect', 'whole', 'other', 'thought', 'was', 'early', '90', 'film', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'young', 'Will', 'Smith', 'prostitute', 'con', 'man', 'affecting', 'lives', 'wealthy', 'Manhattan', 'family', 'premise', 'being', 'none', 'are', 'separated', 'more', 'six', 'degrees', 'actions', 'non-actions', 'ripple', 'effect', 'others', 'perhaps', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'connected', 'Crash', 'many', 'other', 'themes', 'including', 'violence', 'modern', 'society', 'fuelled', 'constant', 'undercurrent', 'racism', 'understandable', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'controversial', 'release', 'pretty', 'hard-edged', 'few', 'touchy', 'issues', 'are', 'topical', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'so', 'future.The', 'film', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'police', 'detective', 'commenting', 'people', 'L.A.', 'never', 'make', 'contact', 'touch', 'other', ""'re"", 'always', 'travelling', 'car', 'separated', 'glass', 'steel', 'communication', 'only', 'when', 'vehicles', 'crash', 'other', 'been', 'car', 'pile-up', 'freeway', 'partner', 'having', 'heated', 'argument', 'Asian', 'woman', 'scene', 'changes', 'see', 'two', 'relatively', 'well-dressed', 'young', 'African-', 'Americans', 'having', 'intelligent', 'conversation', 'racism', 'are', 'walking', 'predominately', 'white', 'upper-class', 'suburb', 'L.A.', 'one', 'men', 'observe', 'white', 'people', 'appear', 'be', 'scared', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'scared', 'when', 'other', 'asks', 'So', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'scared', 'have', 'guns', 'Suddenly', 'pull', 'out', 'pistols', 'commit', 'car', 'jacking', 'victims', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'District', 'Attorney', 'L.A.', 'wife.The', 'story', 'focusing', 'lives', 'Persian', 'storeowner', 'family', 'African-American', 'television', 'director', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Mexican', 'American', 'locksmith', 'racist', 'cop', 'rookie', 'partner', 'Korean', 'couple', 'activities', 'film', 'revealed', 'end', 'quite', 'surprising.Paul', 'Haggis', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'cleverly', 'connects', 'characters', 'where', 'individual', 'actions', 'either', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'great', 'effect', 'respective', 'views', 'people', 'other', 'words', 'living', 'glass', 'steel', 'lives', 'are', 'destined', 'collide.As', 'believe', 'film', 'realistic', 'view', 'modern', 'urban', 'life', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'tragedy', 'existing', 'side', 'side', 'continue', 'be', 'alienated', 'though', 'connected', 'human', 'beings', 'affecting', 'other', 'personally', 'forced', 'communicate', 'only', 'fear', 'violence', 'unexpected', 'collision.Crash', 'excellent', 'film']",Crash

920372,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B000A3XY5A,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[5, 14]","'Crash' is an interesting experiment in film making, not only because of its script but also because of how the director created this genre bending film, and by that I mean that it's not your ordinary drama, which is a positive development in the right direction.  However, its theme and the subsequent handling of it created quite a bit of controversy, essentially splitting people's views of it down the middle.  I think the reason why a lot of people don't like 'Crash' is because of its context and directorial style. At times it feels like we're watching a theater play in which characters are pouring their hearts out in monologues, some type of narration purely for the sake of the audience, and then all of a sudden it turns around and gets back to reality, which was kind of a bizarre mix of atmosphere and mentality.What I liked about 'Crash' was that the characters seemed like real people, not some typical Hollywood cardboard cutouts, and even though some of the scenarios seemed a little far fetched, at the same time they were plausible and served as great tools to explore the depths of racial tensions, inequalities and preconceived notions that all of us have to a certain extent about people from different ethnic backgrounds. This film broke down some of those barriers and exposed a little bit of the truth that none of us are who we seem to be, and that we shouldn't be too quick to judge people based on a few random circumstances or chance encounters, because we're all more complicated than the first impression that we get of someone.Matt Dillon's character in particular was fascinating because on one side he was this racist, chauvenistic pig who abused his authority in the most despicable ways, yet at home he was dealing with an ailing father and perhaps some of his misdeeds was him projecting his fears, doubts and frustration onto those around him. Obviously nothing can excuse his actions, but later on he kind of redeems himself in the most ironic of circumstances and as the movie progresses we get to learn that there was a deeper side to him, that he wasn't as much of a scumbag that the audience was initially led to believe. Even in the most overt monster there can lie genuine love and kindness and perhaps most importantly one act commited by a human does not define them into one stereotypical role, but rather the sum of their actions and thoughts displays a better picture of their true nature.'Crash' is a different film, and definitely not the best film that I've seen, however the performances were quite good, they were believable, and I felt for many of the characters with a myriad of emotions. It wasn't a cut and dry film where the line was drawn between good and bad, it was morally and socially ambiguous, and that was the point, to make the audience think more about these issues, re-evaluate ourselves and our points of view of how we approach stereotypes in our everyday life. The film has a powerful message and for me I finished the film with a little more insight into human nature, and for any film to achieve that, it gets high marks from me.",5,'Crash' Is A Hit With A Major Impact,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,3106,"[""'Crash"", 'interesting', 'experiment', 'film', 'making', 'not', 'only', 'script', 'also', 'how', 'director', 'created', 'genre', 'bending', 'film', 'mean', 'not', 'ordinary', 'drama', 'positive', 'development', 'right', 'direction', 'However', 'theme', 'subsequent', 'handling', 'created', 'quite', 'bit', 'controversy', 'essentially', 'splitting', 'people', 'views', 'down', 'middle', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'Crash"", 'context', 'directorial', 'style', 'times', ""'re"", 'watching', 'theater', 'play', 'characters', 'are', 'pouring', 'hearts', 'out', 'monologues', 'type', 'narration', 'purely', 'sake', 'audience', 'then', 'sudden', 'around', 'back', 'reality', 'was', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'mix', 'atmosphere', 'mentality.What', 'liked', ""'Crash"", 'was', 'characters', 'seemed', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'even', 'scenarios', 'seemed', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'same', 'time', 'were', 'plausible', 'served', 'great', 'tools', 'explore', 'depths', 'racial', 'tensions', 'inequalities', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'have', 'certain', 'extent', 'people', 'different', 'ethnic', 'backgrounds', 'film', 'broke', 'down', 'barriers', 'exposed', 'little', 'bit', 'truth', 'none', 'are', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'quick', 'judge', 'people', 'based', 'few', 'random', 'circumstances', 'chance', 'encounters', ""'re"", 'more', 'complicated', 'first', 'impression', 'get', 'someone.Matt', 'Dillon', 'character', 'particular', 'was', 'fascinating', 'one', 'side', 'was', 'racist', 'chauvenistic', 'pig', 'who', 'abused', 'authority', 'most', 'despicable', 'ways', 'yet', 'home', 'was', 'dealing', 'ailing', 'father', 'perhaps', 'misdeeds', 'was', 'projecting', 'fears', 'doubts', 'frustration', 'Obviously', 'nothing', 'can', 'excuse', 'actions', 'later', 'kind', 'redeems', 'most', 'ironic', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'get', 'learn', 'was', 'deeper', 'side', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'scumbag', 'audience', 'was', 'initially', 'led', 'believe', 'Even', 'most', 'overt', 'monster', 'can', 'lie', 'genuine', 'love', 'kindness', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'one', 'act', 'commited', 'human', 'not', 'define', 'one', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'rather', 'sum', 'actions', 'thoughts', 'better', 'picture', 'true', 'nature', 'different', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'however', 'performances', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'were', 'believable', 'felt', 'many', 'characters', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'was', ""n't"", 'cut', 'dry', 'film', 'where', 'line', 'was', 'drawn', 'good', 'bad', 'was', 'morally', 'socially', 'ambiguous', 'was', 'point', 'make', 'audience', 'think', 'more', 'issues', 're-evaluate', 'ourselves', 'points', 'view', 'how', 'approach', 'stereotypes', 'everyday', 'life', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', 'finished', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'insight', 'human', 'nature', 'film', 'achieve', 'high', 'marks']",Crash

These personal issues by and large are based on racial discord present in the diversified populace of metropolitan Los Angeles.Haggis uses his many actors to create situations fraught with irony and pathos to make us aware of the racial profiling that we normally practice on a daily basis.  He uses his film to point out the danger created when we judge people based on preconceived notions regarding race, creed and persuasion.The talented Don Cheadle who produced the film is effective as Detective Graham Waters who unwittingly winds up investigating the disappearnace and subsequent murder of his younger runaway brother.

The Los Angeles Guilty White Liberal has got to be the dumbest form of humanity going, even moreso than the inbred hillbilly. You know who I mean: the latte sipping crowd that brought you such critically lauded trash as The Hours, which plumbed every arts clich&eacute; imaginable; Monster, which revealed Feminazism's worst side (i.e.- murdering men is ok if the murderer disingenuously claims all men are bad rapists); or Million Dollar Baby, which proved that white trash are probably the only social group still open for out and out mockery. That last piece of tripe, incidentally, was penned by Paul Haggis, the man who wrote and directed this past year's Academy Award winning film of the year, Crash.... Perhaps the most ridiculous, and humorous, moment comes in a cameo where television actor Tony Danza plays a tv star who wants his black costars to sound more `black', so tells the black tv director to reshoot a scene. No one, in this day and age, is so clueless as to risk a lawsuit by speaking that way in public, yet the trio of fawning Left Wing dimwits comment on Danza's `subtle villainy', as if needing to display not a one of them has a clue as to the word's actual definition. Yet, cluelessly written scenes like that abound, and the fact that everyone associated with this film is clueless of them is telegraphed in the film's very first scene, where Cheadle ludicrously intones that people `crash into each other' just to feel something. Wow! Great concept for a title. Here's a better one: The Idiots Guide To Racism. Oh, wait, trademark infringement.The fact is, although most human beings are idiots, in relation to their emotions, their idiocy is born of complexity, which only makes real world idiocy as racism so vexing and puzzling. But, instead of focusing on the vexing motives of people's bigotry, Haggis shows the shallowness of his understanding of bigotry, not the shallowness of bigotry itself, as well as his utter lack of ambiguity and realism in portraying his characters, their actions, and motivations. This film was two hours of pure movie hell, and one of the worst films ever made; and not in that schlocky Robot Monster nor Plan 9 From Outer Space way that can endear as years pass. It's especially so, considering that a bumper sticker would have sufficed to convey its trite message. I could literally go on for several more pages, detailing every ridiculous and phony thing in this film, and still not fully convey how truly atrocious watching this film was. It should be reviled as being every bit as bigoted and truly `full of hatred' for humanity, as anything Rush Limbaugh, or his ilk, ever uttered. That no one in Hollywood recognized this real `truth' unfortunately explains why this country is where it is right now, and why racism is not the problem, merely a symptom of the real ill.",1,Ugh,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2993,"['Just', 'when', 'think', 'Right', 'Wing', 'run', 'nation', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'smarter', 'other', 'sort', 'human', 'beings', 'am', 'proved', 'wrong', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Guilty', 'White', 'Liberal', 'got', 'be', 'dumbest', 'form', 'humanity', 'going', 'even', 'moreso', 'inbred', 'hillbilly', 'know', 'who', 'mean', 'latte', 'sipping', 'crowd', 'brought', 'such', 'critically', 'lauded', 'trash', 'Hours', 'plumbed', 'arts', 'clich', 'eacute', 'imaginable', 'Monster', 'revealed', 'Feminazism', 'worst', 'side', 'i.e.-', 'murdering', 'men', 'ok', 'murderer', 'disingenuously', 'men', 'are', 'bad', 'rapists', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'proved', 'white', 'trash', 'are', 'probably', 'only', 'social', 'group', 'still', 'open', 'out', 'mockery', 'last', 'piece', 'tripe', 'incidentally', 'was', 'penned', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'past', 'year', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'film', 'year', 'Crash', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'humorous', 'moment', 'cameo', 'where', 'television', 'actor', 'Tony', 'Danza', 'tv', 'star', 'who', 'black', 'costars', 'sound', 'more', 'black', 'so', 'black', 'tv', 'director', 'reshoot', 'scene', 'one', 'day', 'age', 'so', 'clueless', 'risk', 'lawsuit', 'speaking', 'way', 'public', 'yet', 'trio', 'fawning', 'Left', 'Wing', 'comment', 'Danza', 'subtle', 'villainy', 'needing', 'display', 'not', 'one', 'clue', 'word', 'actual', 'definition', 'cluelessly', 'written', 'scenes', 'abound', 'fact', 'everyone', 'associated', 'film', 'clueless', 'telegraphed', 'film', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'Cheadle', 'ludicrously', 'people', 'crash', 'other', 'just', 'feel', 'something', 'Wow', 'Great', 'concept', 'title', 'Here', 'better', 'one', 'Idiots', 'Guide', 'Racism', 'Oh', 'wait', 'trademark', 'infringement.The', 'fact', 'most', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'idiots', 'relation', 'emotions', 'idiocy', 'born', 'complexity', 'only', 'real', 'world', 'idiocy', 'racism', 'vexing', 'puzzling', 'instead', 'focusing', 'vexing', 'motives', 'people', 'bigotry', 'Haggis', 'shallowness', 'understanding', 'bigotry', 'not', 'shallowness', 'bigotry', 'as', 'well', 'utter', 'lack', 'ambiguity', 'realism', 'portraying', 'characters', 'actions', 'motivations', 'film', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'pure', 'movie', 'hell', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'schlocky', 'Robot', 'Monster', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'way', 'can', 'endear', 'years', 'pass', 'especially', 'so', 'considering', 'bumper', 'sticker', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'convey', 'trite', 'message', 'could', 'literally', 'go', 'several', 'more', 'pages', 'detailing', 'ridiculous', 'phony', 'thing', 'film', 'still', 'not', 'fully', 'convey', 'how', 'truly', 'atrocious', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'should', 'be', 'reviled', 'being', 'bit', 'bigoted', 'truly', 'full', 'hatred', 'humanity', 'anything', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'ilk', 'ever', 'uttered', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'recognized', 'real', 'truth', 'unfortunately', 'why', 'country', 'where', 'right', 'now', 'why', 'racism', 'not', 'problem', 'merely', 'symptom', 'real', 'ill']",Crash

920381,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B000A3XY5A,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 2]","Based on his screenplay with Robert Moresco, Paul Haggis makes what is essentially his feature film debut with a thoroughly involving drama of disparate characters in a series of seemingly unrelated events in and around Los AngelesOne evening culminates in a car accident being investigated by police and a grim discovery for one of the detectives.  Flashback to the day before as a dozen characters deal with urban survival.  A couple of idealistic, black youths carjack an upper class couple who turn out to be the district attorney and his shallow wife.  A proud, Persian shop keeper and his wife struggle to keep their business open and safe.  A locksmith, who is Hispanic, is also a loving, protective father to his precious five year old daughter.  A repressed movie director and his combative wife are pulled over by an aggressive, angry cop and his younger, moral partner.  These are people who are haunted by guilt and fear as they strive for some kind of happiness.  As events unfold, each set of characters is affected by an apparently random act by another group which has long lasting consequences for all of them.To detail exactly what happens will spoil a delicate web of plotlines that are mutually supporting one another in almost operatic fashion.  Haggis, who adapted the heartbreaking gem, ""Million Dollar Baby"" (and honed his writing skills on many a television series), has devised an intricate, multi-layered morality play on a grand scale.  Borrowing liberally from the story structures of his contemporaries like Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"") and veterans like Robert Altman (""Nashville""), he masters the form with surprising ease and to the audience's edification.  He does not dumb down the script but rather treats his audience with intelligence.  The dialogue is on occasion wordy and blatant commentary while other times the words carry a bite and sting as they ring true to the human condition.  Any edgier dialogue would start to become Tarantino like.  Although there are several references to racial intolerance and conflict, these serve as more of a springboard to broader ideas and relationships.Haggis wisely avoids clich&eacute;s thus keeping the events and actions fresh and original.  When a scene looks like it will end expectedly, something different happens to change its direction in interesting ways.  None of the characters is truly good or evil; instead they are full blooded characters who yearn for a better life while tarnished by their current affliction be it economic, physical, or emotional.  Just when you think the film will go down a dark path with tragic results, it throws another wrinkle to keep you guessing and pleasantly surprise you.  And when tragedy does strike, it happens in an unexpected, ironic way.Don Cheadle is part of a well cast group of emsemble players, many of whom reduced their payscales to take on what amounted to be supporting work.  It doesn't hurt if the script is as strong and well conceived as this one.  Cheadle is excellent as the detective who tries to help his mother and his often absent brother. Brandon Fraser and Sandra Bullock play the D.A. and his wife.  Terrence Dashon Howard and Thandie Newton play a glamorous Hollywood couple who must confront racial and emotional issues.  Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe are the policemen whose portrayals begin on opposite ends of the moral spectrum and wind up switching places.  Special mention goes to Michael Pena as the locksmith.The city scenes are photographed with a gritty realism and the music, predominantly led by New Age composer Mark Isham, lends a dreamlike, aura to the film's mood.  All the major storylines are followed through by movie's end with hardly a loose end.  It is ironic that the film is reminiscent of a lesser, 1970's made-for television drama, ""Smashup on Interstate 5"".There are times early in the film that one thinks it will degenerate into a racially charged statement, but it never loses course.  The roles both large and small seem more than sketches after awhile.  You care about what happens to all of them, even the more criminal elements because they are real people.  The film plays like a mosaic or puzzle of fragments and pieces that slowly but satisfyingly come together.  Although there are more than a couple of coincidental events and incidents including car accidents that link many of the characters, the improbable happenings are easy to forgive since we are in the hands of a good storyteller.  These chance encounters serve as a catalyst or storytelling device to propel the story further.Crash is an ambitious film with lofty goals that it attains with great frequency.  Haggis should be commended for weaving an ambitious tapestry of lives and fate without resorting to easy, simplistic answers.",4,Real People Collide in crash,1115337600,"05 6,

920383,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B000A3XY5A,Dai-keag-ity,"[5, 7]","I liked Crash, but I think it came within a whisker of being purposely manipulative, and I'll say for sure that it went for the quick gratification of easy praise rather than taking a few more chances and truly breaking into courageous new ground on the subject of racial issues. Had it done that, I'd have no problems ranking this as a five-star modern masterpiece.In my opinion Crash's saving grace had less to do with what it tried to say and more to do with how it was said. By that I mean its slick, successful use of what was almost a single time-warping plot branching out and weaving in its many interconnecting edges was far more interesting in its complexity than what was actually happening within the movie itself. And unlike every film that's employed this ""layered"" technique in the last dozen years, I didn't get the feeling it was either ripping off or paying homage to Pulp Fiction: Crash found its own identity.As for its message (and make no mistake, this wasn't just storytelling, it had a message) to be honest I found that at times exploitive. Plus that whole defining theme of how strangers deliberately cause car wrecks in order to meet people and gain human contact? That was not only implausible, it wasn't even explored within the movie, just mentioned and left dangling. The situations, characters and events in Crash employed caricatures and broadly-painted stereotypes without any real complexity to them. We were treated to individuals straight out of mass market fiction: the bigoted cop with his moment of personal salvation; the angry white-collar black man; the flimsy, self-showcasing DA; the wronged white woman who lashed out; the Asian who can't drive; the persecuted Muslim, etc etc etc. Not once did the filmmakers go out on a limb and present a person in a role generally considered foreign to stereotypes of his or her ethnicity. There is also the question of whether a project like Crash explores sensitive social issues, or feeds the beast of racism, particularly, perhaps, by lending a sense of justification to an existing extra-racial persecution complex common among all Americans today.Crash certainly entertains with top-notch acting and its polished story that makes you extremely interested in how it is all going to come out, but in the end it has little to teach us about our own perceptions of others or about the private lives of those who share this county with us.

Although they viewpoints people have in this movie may not be correct, they are still justified at least in their minds.  We have Rick (Fraser) & his wife Jean (Bullock) who are robbed by two black men, Anthony (played by Ludacris in a role I'm floored he pulled off) & Peter (played by Larenz Tate who once again proves he has talent beyond recognition).  This only intesifies the fear and unhappiness that Jean is already experiencing in her life.  Sandra Bullock plays this role flawlessly and I'm only upset to the fact that her role is shortend and more lead time would have been wanted.  You see, Anthony and Peter work for some ""red-neck"" as he puts it.  They steal cars and he sells them.  Anyways, Anthony has a view I've seen alot, the view that everyone is out to get the black man.  He sees everything as a finger pointing at him and he sees everyone, white or even black females, as wanting to put him down.  Peter seems to have a more balanced view.  Theres one scenerio.  Next is Farhad (Shaun Toub) who is a Pershian store owner who is buying a gun with his daughter for protection from the neighborhood.  There are words thrown between Farhad and the store owner and eventually Farhad is thrown out and his daughter makes the purchase.  You can see the way these people are treated all because of an incident (9-11) not involving themselves but a people they are linked to.  You have Cameron (Howard) and his wife Christine (Newton in her best role yet) who are harrased by Officer Ryan (Dillon in an amazing turn as a racist cop).  You can see the hatred in his eyes and when he explains his fathers condition your almost in tears.  This movie shows how each of these situations is interwtined and how these people are affected by they're suroundings, and hopfully how they will be changed by their experiances.  The most gripping plotline to me revolves around a locksmith (Michael Pena) and his family and how they are involved in a heartwrenching sequence involving Farhad.  Graham (Don Cheadle) & Ria (Esposito) are parters (homicide) and lovers and are involved in a case involving a white officer who shot and killed a black officer, both cops undercover and it appears the black cop may have been on coke and crooked.  The question comes into play, do you prosicute a white cop whos killed three other black officers (all claimed in self defence) or do you let him off because he may be telling the truth?  What would you do, especially if you were a black man who may or may not feel that white people as a whole take advantage and or put down the balck man.  Ryan Phillepe (it's nice to see him in a film) plays Officer Hanson, Dillons partner who is outraged by his partners blatand racism, but is faced with a battle of conscence when alone with Peter (Tate) in one of the most hearwrenching scenes in movie history.  I don't want to give too much away involving the outcomes of these charactors, just know that when the television goes black you will have a lot to think about, that being whether your white or black, asian, hispanic or Arab...our nation, our country as a whole places these steriotypes over each other, and as this movie shows sometimes we put them on ourselves instead of just being who we are and accepting each other for who they are.

A Persian shop keeper (""They think we're Arabs!""), a Hispanic locksmith, two black hoodlums, a wealthy black film director, redneck white trash, a despicable suburban white couple, a naive white rookie cop, and other ethnic typecasts are all trapped in stereotypes that they project on to others, paranoia (not all of which is unjustified), bigotry, and mutual misunderstanding. In this film good people are bad and bad people are good, and most everyone is a mixture of the two. A corrupt cop who molested a woman he apprehended later rescues her from a burning vehicle with professionalism, bravery and genuine compassion: ""You think you know who you are,"" he tells a younger cop, ""but just wait a few years."" He rages at a black HMO clerk but at home tenderly cares for his dying father. Accidental encounters and random events ""crash"" these fallible human beings into one another in a world void of all political correctness.

920389,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000A3XY5A,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","Crash serves up 31 flavors of racism via interlocking vignettes recounting two days in the lives of very different complete strangers.  I was a little leery of this film going in, partly because I don't particularly care for some of the cast members and partly because the prospects of making a serious film about racism without resorting to stereotypes or preaching to the audience seemed rather low.  I needn't have worried.  Sure, Sandra Bullock annoyed the heck out of me every second she was on the screen, but the movie works - powerfully and effectively.  The secret would seem to be a complete disregard for political correctness.  If you want to say something about racism, you can't dance around the issue, and thankfully the writer of this film knew that.I won't go into much detail about the plot or the characters, except to say that a wide range of races and cultures are represented here - and the racism that is portrayed on screen works both ways.  Furthermore, the characters are by no means stereotypical and often do things you don't really expect them to do.  There was a time or two when I said to myself that no one would ever come out and say what a particular character just said, but maybe I'm wrong about that.  Those lines, though, show just how foolish and ugly racism is.  To some extent, we can at least see where a few characters are coming from, thanks to little references back to experiences they've had.  I think the real strength of the story, though, is the level of nuance built into these vignettes.  Consciously doing certain things in order not to appear racist, for purely personal reasons of self-interest, is no better than committing an overt act of prejudice, and this film brings that fact out rather effectively.  It also reminds us that even the most hateful of men and women are still human beings with their own problems.There are some pretty powerful moments spread throughout this film: the heroics of an otherwise hateful cop and the angelic little girl scenes, for example, give us moments of pure cinematic magic.  Other moments surprise us, effectively denying us the ability to ever get truly comfortable with what we are seeing onscreen.  Lives are changed, some for better, some for worse - and the mixed signals at the end really just reinforce the points the story was trying to make.  Are these temporary changes?  Will life just go on as it always has, tainted by hate and mutual suspicion?  Any movie that leaves you asking such poignant questions has to be called a real success.",4,"A challenging, risky film that succeeds on many levels",1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,2546,"['Crash', 'up', '31', 'flavors', 'racism', 'interlocking', 'vignettes', 'recounting', 'two', 'days', 'lives', 'very', 'different', 'complete', 'strangers', 'was', 'little', 'leery', 'film', 'going', 'partly', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'cast', 'members', 'partly', 'prospects', 'making', 'serious', 'film', 'racism', 'resorting', 'stereotypes', 'preaching', 'audience', 'seemed', 'rather', 'low', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'Sure', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'annoyed', 'heck', 'second', 'was', 'screen', 'movie', 'powerfully', 'effectively', 'secret', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'complete', 'disregard', 'political', 'correctness', 'want', 'say', 'something', 'racism', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'issue', 'thankfully', 'writer', 'film', 'knew', 'that.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'detail', 'plot', 'characters', 'say', 'wide', 'range', 'races', 'cultures', 'are', 'represented', 'here', 'racism', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'works', 'ways', 'Furthermore', 'characters', 'are', 'means', 'stereotypical', 'often', 'do', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'do', 'was', 'time', 'two', 'when', 'said', 'myself', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'what', 'particular', 'character', 'just', 'said', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'lines', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'foolish', 'ugly', 'racism', 'extent', 'can', 'least', 'see', 'where', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'coming', 'thanks', 'little', 'references', 'back', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'think', 'real', 'strength', 'story', 'level', 'nuance', 'built', 'vignettes', 'Consciously', 'doing', 'certain', 'things', 'order', 'not', 'appear', 'racist', 'purely', 'personal', 'reasons', 'self-interest', 'better', 'committing', 'overt', 'act', 'prejudice', 'film', 'fact', 'rather', 'effectively', 'also', 'even', 'most', 'hateful', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'still', 'human', 'beings', 'own', 'problems.There', 'are', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'moments', 'spread', 'film', 'heroics', 'otherwise', 'hateful', 'cop', 'angelic', 'little', 'girl', 'scenes', 'example', 'give', 'moments', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'Other', 'moments', 'surprise', 'effectively', 'denying', 'ability', 'ever', 'get', 'truly', 'comfortable', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'onscreen', 'Lives', 'are', 'changed', 'better', 'worse', 'mixed', 'signals', 'end', 'really', 'just', 'reinforce', 'points', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'Are', 'temporary', 'changes', 'Will', 'life', 'just', 'go', 'always', 'tainted', 'hate', 'mutual', 'suspicion', 'movie', 'asking', 'such', 'poignant', 'questions', 'be', 'called', 'real', 'success']",Crash

I absolutely agree with David Edelstein's 'Slate' review: ""Haggis wants to distill all the resentment and hypocrisy among races into a fierce parable. But the old-fashioned carpentry (evocative of '30s socially conscious melodrama) makes this portrait of How We Live Now seem preposterous at every turn. A universe in which we're all racist puppets is finally just as simpleminded and predictable as one in which we're all smiling multicolored zombies in a rainbow coalition.""Right after I watched `Crash', my first impression was: What if the Mayor of Los Angeles set up a meeting with some movie studio heads and said, ""You know something, this city is getting just too crazy & overpopulated, and we really need to do something about it.  How about making an `anti-infomercial' for our town that depicts this place as unsavory, freakishly hostile, and all-around reprehensible & uninhabitable as possible?""If you don't happen to think this movie is shallow, I'd just like to point out what a perfect match it would make in a flashy DVD 2-pak right alongside 'Falling Down,' with Michael Douglas taking his ludicrous Alienated-White-Man `agenda' out on the big, bad & oh so unjust metropolis!  Seriously - `Crash' is that ridiculous movie's unofficial sequel, only with a fractured, quasi-Altmanesque story structure that is teeth-gnashingly contrived in its hokey setups and payoffs.  This is melodrama of such spectacular grandiosity and pomposity that it must make executive producers of daytime soap operas scarlet-faced and shuddering with envy.Still, I will wager anyone who's interested that 'Crash' is going to be the big upset at this year's Oscars & win Best Picture instead of `Brokeback Mountain' - it's just melodramatic & `controversial' and `tough-minded' and `hard-hitting' enough to be considered `serious movie-making'...when very unfortunately it is only what PASSES for serious movie-making these days.And while we're on the subject - what in the world is up with Tony Danza's cameo as the mega-racist Second Coming Of Satan!?

The commercials emphasized Sandra Bullock, America's sweetheart, as a foul mouthed, mean spirited, rich, rigid, racist white woman, and Ludicrous as a witty, charismatic, black carjacker.""Oh, no,"" I thought, ""just what we need. More Hollywood Limousine Liberal one-dimensional pablum about how we should just all get along. Another 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'"" A funny thing happened, though. Many acquaintances, from a variety of backgrounds, approached me to urge me to see the film. They were moved by this movie in a way that I haven't seen people be moved by a movie in years.Then, when ""Crash"" won the Academy Award for best picture, I thought, okay, I need to see this, even if just as a cultural artifact.Boy, was I surprised. ""Crash"" was nothing like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" except in that it has a great cast.The script is sharp and fast and literate. Characters manage to say memorable things without sounding artificial (for the most part.) I miss Joe Mankiewicz. I miss great scripts. ""Crash"" is a treat for fans of language.The cast is just, plain, unbelievably fine. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza -- who would have guessed that these stars could have done the kind of intensely moving work that they do here? Matt Dillon gave a performance, and created a character, that I will simply never forget.Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, and Loretta Devine are also great, but not as surprising, because they don't play against type. The actors playing a Persian shop keeper and his daughter, a locksmith ... Each performance is stunning, perfect, moving.Terrence Howard ... what can I say? I'm running out of words. Terrence Howard was exquisitely moving.Ryan Phillipe. Keith David.Just, standing on my chair, applauding. This movie gave me a whole new appreciation of acting as a profession.""Crash"" consists of one stunning moment after another that wrenches both with its realness and its artistic merit. I've lived some of those moments: a father reassures his daughter with a tale of a protective cloak; a woman embraces someone whom she suddenly recognizes as a friend; a man says he doesn't want to apologize any more; a son tries to help his ill father.Most movies would be lucky to create one such scene.Some have argued that the movie is contrived. To those folks I'll report: movies *are* contrived. See, Matt Dillon is not actually a police officer ...I didn't find one moment of ""Crash"" to be unbelievable. We've all had moments of coincidence that defied chance. That's why the word ""synchronicity"" exists.Others objected that the movie is preachy. I've really got to wonder about the lives of the folks who found this movie preachy. I live in a very multicultural, multiracial world. Events like those in ""Crash"" happen in the world I inhabit. Unlikely allies do form. People do sell out. Deals are cut. Rescues are made, and lives are lost.How is depicting these realities on screen ""preachy""?I'm wary of overuse of words like ""preachy"" and ""manipulative"" in film reviews. They tend to be used by people who like movies shot through gauze in the South of France where the only thing that happens is that Charlotte Rampling gazes off soulfully into the distance.I think many, too, had a problem with what is on screen in ""Crash."" The white supremacist bad guy everyone is primed to hate is revealed to be a complex human being. Blacks are not depicted as blameless; some steal, are rude, and make racist comments. I think that that bit of reality will disturb some movie goers.Some argued that the movie ends too neatly. I didn't see any neat ending. In the end, there is life, and there is death, and mere chance separates the two. The final sounds in the movie are a new racial confrontation beginning.The film's sheer artistry, and its soundtrack, make all the horror it exposes bearable. This movie left me exhilarated. If we can produce movies like this, maybe we can learn to all just get along.",5,"Brilliant Script, Surprising Performances, Unforgettable Moments",1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,4042,"['remember', 'watching', 'TV', 'commercials', 'Crash', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'theaters', 'commercials', 'emphasized', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'America', 'sweetheart', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'mean', 'spirited', 'rich', 'rigid', 'racist', 'white', 'woman', 'Ludicrous', 'witty', 'charismatic', 'black', 'carjacker', 'Oh', 'thought', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'More', 'Hollywood', 'Limousine', 'Liberal', 'one-dimensional', 'pablum', 'how', 'should', 'just', 'get', 'along', ""'Guess"", 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'Many', 'acquaintances', 'variety', 'backgrounds', 'approached', 'urge', 'see', 'film', 'were', 'moved', 'movie', 'way', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'people', 'be', 'moved', 'movie', 'years.Then', 'when', 'Crash', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'picture', 'thought', 'need', 'see', 'even', 'just', 'cultural', 'artifact.Boy', 'was', 'surprised', 'Crash', 'was', 'nothing', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Dinner', 'great', 'cast.The', 'script', 'sharp', 'fast', 'literate', 'Characters', 'manage', 'say', 'memorable', 'things', 'sounding', 'artificial', 'most', 'part', 'miss', 'Joe', 'Mankiewicz', 'miss', 'great', 'scripts', 'Crash', 'treat', 'fans', 'language.The', 'cast', 'just', 'plain', 'unbelievably', 'fine', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Tony', 'Danza', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'stars', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'kind', 'intensely', 'moving', 'work', 'do', 'here', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'gave', 'performance', 'created', 'character', 'will', 'simply', 'never', 'forget.Don', 'Cheadle', 'Ludicrous', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'not', 'surprising', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'type', 'actors', 'playing', 'Persian', 'shop', 'keeper', 'daughter', 'locksmith', 'performance', 'stunning', 'perfect', 'moving.Terrence', 'Howard', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'running', 'words', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'was', 'exquisitely', 'moving.Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'Keith', 'David.Just', 'standing', 'chair', 'applauding', 'movie', 'gave', 'whole', 'new', 'appreciation', 'acting', 'profession', 'Crash', 'one', 'stunning', 'moment', 'realness', 'artistic', 'merit', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'moments', 'father', 'daughter', 'tale', 'protective', 'cloak', 'woman', 'someone', 'whom', 'suddenly', 'friend', 'man', ""n't"", 'want', 'apologize', 'more', 'son', 'help', 'ill', 'father.Most', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'create', 'one', 'such', 'scene.Some', 'have', 'argued', 'movie', 'contrived', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'report', 'movies', '*are*', 'contrived', 'See', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'not', 'actually', 'police', 'officer', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'moment', 'Crash', 'be', 'unbelievable', ""'ve"", 'had', 'moments', 'coincidence', 'defied', 'chance', 'why', 'word', 'synchronicity', 'exists.Others', 'objected', 'movie', 'preachy', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'wonder', 'lives', 'folks', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'preachy', 'live', 'very', 'multicultural', 'multiracial', 'world', 'Events', 'Crash', 'happen', 'world', 'inhabit', 'Unlikely', 'allies', 'do', 'form', 'People', 'do', 'sell', 'out', 'Deals', 'are', 'cut', 'Rescues', 'are', 'made', 'lives', 'are', 'lost.How', 'depicting', 'realities', 'screen', 'preachy', ""'m"", 'wary', 'overuse', 'words', 'preachy', 'manipulative', 'film', 'reviews', 'tend', 'be', 'used', 'people', 'who', 'movies', 'shot', 'gauze', 'South', 'France', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'off', 'soulfully', 'distance.I', 'think', 'many', 'too', 'had', 'problem', 'what', 'screen', 'Crash', 'white', 'supremacist', 'bad', 'guy', 'everyone', 'primed', 'hate', 'revealed', 'be', 'complex', 'human', 'being', 'Blacks', 'are', 'not', 'depicted', 'blameless', 'steal', 'are', 'rude', 'make', 'racist', 'comments', 'think', 'bit', 'reality', 'will', 'disturb', 'movie', 'goers.Some', 'argued', 'movie', 'too', 'neatly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'neat', 'ending', 'end', 'life', 'death', 'mere', 'chance', 'two', 'final', 'sounds', 'movie', 'are', 'new', 'racial', 'confrontation', 'beginning.The', 'film', 'sheer', 'artistry', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'horror', 'bearable', 'movie', 'left', 'exhilarated', 'can', 'produce', 'movies', 'maybe', 'can', 'learn', 'just', 'get', 'along']",Crash

At home, Jean voices her suspicions regarding the honesty of the Hispanic locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena) who returns home to his young daughter upset and frustrated.

Crash is not entertaining and I couldn't figure out the message (if there was one).  Perhaps the message is that racism still exists in America.  So who doesn't know that already?  There were too many characters in this movie and no hero or person that we could identify with.  What WERE the critics thinking?  Makes you wonder sometimes how the critics can sometimes be so far out of touch with what the public likes.  Makes me begin to wonder why we even listen to the critics, as they too often get it wrong.

920404,A1KISYZSUGHL5P,B000A3XY5A,David Romano,"[3, 9]","I'd give this three and a half stars.  The main reason is that there were just too many scenes which went a bit over-the-top.For example, Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who pulls over an African-American couple and sexually assaults the wife while ""patting her down"".  Then later in the film, after we've been subjected to his attempts to explain his racism to another African American woman, he arrives on the scene of an accident and lo and behold has to save the woman he molested.  OK, could we be any more dramatic?  Or predictable?And other scenes like it.  The young idealistic cop who shoots a young African American man (he picked up a hitch hiker why?); the Persian who tries to take out his frustrations on the Hispanic locksmith who fixed his lock the night before (was I the only one who knew the daughter bought him blanks?!?); the Asian man who is dealing in Thai slavery; the African-American thieves who swear they will never ever steal from ""one of their own"" ending up in a situation where they, lo and behold, steal from one of their own.I think this was a good idea for a film.  I think, overall it was very well excecuted, and well-acted.  The short narrative style of the film worked for me.  But it was too over-the-top, too predicable, and too determined to prove, that in their own way, everyone is a racist.The best character for me?  Jean (Sandra Bullock, in a thankfully less glamourous and less comedic role than I'm used to seeing her in).  Why?  because she represents what many of us think.  After being carjacked with her husband, she goes into full rant mode.  At one point, she goes on about how if you're racist, and you genuinely feel that way, you can't express it because you are then inherently a bad person, whether or not you are/are not correct, and look where that got her... carjacked.  Whether she is right or wrong isn't the issue, though.  It's all about political correctness.We have become so politically correct that we cannot face our own inner feelings because, as this movie tries to show, we all have our prejudices, and they always lead to something bad.  With the exception of the all-accepting locksmith who moved from the barrios to make a better life for his daughter, no one gets out of this film unscathed (and his unscather was just really dumb and demeaning!).I agree with several reviewers that the only thing missing was a militant gay man, but I also agree with Lost Highways (yes a special mention).  The movie claims to be about race, but when I look back, the characters I associated with the most, and felt the most for, were the women.

The cast is very good, indeed, but this is not a movie; it is a collection of scenes, vignettes, scraps of scenes put together with a heavy-handed theme called racism. This film has been compared favorably to Altman's ""Shortcuts,"" a favorite among Los Angeles cynics, but what that film had going for it besides its director was the writing which came from Raymond Carver, a master of the short story. Racism is a good subject, of course, but racism as seen from the point of view of embittered victims is propaganda. There is nothing even hinted at regarding the real racism that affects Angelenos, which is the racism of one minority against the other. What of the deadly conflict between black and Latinos in LA? That is ignored in favor of the racism of the past when LA was ruled by whites. Ain't so no more, but the filmmakers are too white themselves to see this. Don Cheadle and the rest of the cast turn in signature performances, but left alone without real stars, these very able character actors are shown to be far less capable than one might have expected. The fact is they can't carry the weight of this material. Two years on, this film is hard to remember.

If nothing else, this is added evidence of just how politically correct the voters are that decide such matters.  Crash is merely a modestly OK production that normally would not be released to the general public.  No, this a cappuccino theater experience usually marketed to yuppie left wingers.  It would have had a run of no more than a month---and then sent to the video stores.  Few people would be aware of its existence.  The script writing of Crash reminds me of the efforts of an immature college student who is convinced that the United States remains a very racist nation.None of the story lines ring true.  The Matt Dillon white racist cop character, for instance, hasn't existed in this country since the late 1950s.  There is no way that a Los Angeles police officer in the 21st century dares to sexually fondle a woman during a non-threatening traffic stop.  Crash is a collection of hyperbolic vignettes created merely to entertain those left of center ""elites"" who are ideologically committed to the notion that America's racial relations have not dramatically improved in the last fifty years.

920407,A9VD20X239FSR,B000A3XY5A,"Dean Backus ""Hi! How are you today?""","[15, 19]","A great cast and good intentions make most of this film go down easily--too easily.  Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard do sterling work in this tale of culture clashes, prejudices, and coincidences in Los Angeles, and scene by scene the film is gripping with some amazingly powerful and poignant moments.  However, the script's desire to throw stereotypes up on the screen, while brave, is also its weakness: too many of the overwhelmingly large number of speaking parts are, in fact, stereotypes, and no amount of happy wish-fulfillment or well-intentioned scenes that come across as patronizing (an injured Bullock embracing her Latina housekeeper and telling her she's her best friend) can paper over the fault lines the film purports to examine.  Cheadle, as he was in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" is the throughline of the movie, and his knockout final scene with his mother has a dramatic punch and ambiguity that the rest of the movie needs; too often, it feels like something that would've been incendiary in the mid-90's after Rodney King and O.J. (especially if Spike Lee had tackled it), but now seems simultaneously overwrought and tame.  You'll admire the performances (a deserving SAG win), but the more you think about the movie as a whole, the more it seems too tidy--and putting it up against the brainy ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and the shattering ""Brokeback Mountain,"" it's flaws are even more apparent, especially the awful video quality.  It's a water-cooler ""buzz"" film right now (thanks to the Oscar idiocy), but how it will stand up over time is a very big question mark--it was #36 in Entertainment Weekly's year-end critic's roundup, and #56 in PREMIERE'S.  (""Brokeback"" and ""Good Night"" were #2 and #3, respectively.)

Not the deep kind of thinking that ""I Heart Huckabees"" or ""Royal Tenenbaums"", or even ""Rushmore"" made you do. It is not the movie that makes you feel bad about yourself like ""Sideways"" (although a great movie, it made you think about the bad things you do, didn't it?), but it does make you feel like the experiences happening to these characters are hapenning to you. Perhaps it is that the characters are set up so well that we feel as if we know them, or maybe it is how intimately the movie is shot. The movie is filmed with each character either leaning against or near the camera, and the movie stays away from the rather cliched act of looking into the camera and talking (""Alfie"", or even a good movie like ""High Fidelity""). This may seem annoying to people, and you may say ""Why would I want to see people leaning on the camera?!"" Well, it's done in a very artsy way. The characters talk to one another, and it seems that it is rare that two characters involved in a conversation are in the same frame. The movie is also admirable for not running on too long. It runs a curt 103 minutes, and it feels like it's about an hour. On a completely different note, the movie has some great action scenes. Not the kind of action scenes that a dumb movie like ""xXx: State Of The Union"" would have, things blowing up and people getting shot, but scenes of action that have characters crashing their cars into each other. There are no incredible gun fights, gun violence, but no twenty minute gun fights. There's no fantastic samurai sword fights (no, there's no Uma in a yellow jumper thing). What there is is a good, no, great, movie that dabbles into the rather risque subject of racism. There can be a movie like ""White Chicks"" that makes fun of racism, but it is hard to be serious about the subject without being blasted by people and critics. The movie at times is funny, but not overly funny. It's more of a dark comedy/drama. A very dark comedy. The kind of accidic humor that ran rampantly through Alexander Payne's ""Election"" and Todd Solondz's ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"". Writer/director Paul Haggis finally makes a film that people notice. Yes, he did make the inferior ""Million Dollar Baby"", or more commonly known to me as the following three: ""Maggie Fitzgerald We Love You: A Musical"", ""Oh Lord Where Did My Tongue Go?"" "" or my personal favorite ""Thanks Mrs. Unlicensed Chripractor Whose Name Sounds Like A Bad Beer, That's The Way To Step On My Neck! Oww! Too Hard!"" But what I'm saying is that I'm glad to see that he has finally made a movie that people are recieving so well. Not everybody like ""M$B"", but many seem to love this movie. Some are taking the message of the movie too seriously. It's a movie about people changed by their actions, and by the end of the movie they are better people. They will never be great people, or honest people like you or me, but they have learned a lesson and they slowly learn to be kinder to people.""Crash"", which takes place over a 36 hour period, is about fourteen people who are, to some varying degree, racist. Jean (Sandra Bullock), and her husband Rick (Brendan Fraser) walk along a downtown street late at night. Passing a couple of African American me, Jean inadvertantly takes Rick's arm. They assume it an act of racism, and soon carjack the couple. The friends, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate), are nice guys, but at some point they ended up doing the wrong thing, and now they have to do more wrong stuff to cover the last thing. We are more or less forced to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jean and Rick, who is the District Attorney, are a nice couple, a rather rich couple, but Jean is rather hard to put up with. When installing locks on their house, a Latino locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pina), takes a little too long installing the locks for Jean. She asks when he'll be done, then goes to her husband and starts yelling about he will go out and give their house key to his ""homies"", and that they'll be ransacked by morning. A parralel plot line follows two cops, Hansen (Ryan Phillippee) and Ryan (Matt Dillon). Ryan is a racist, and when the call comes in to pull over a black Navigator, Ryan pulls over the wrong one just because an interracial couple is fornicating. The couple, Christine (Thandie Newton) and Cameron (Terrence Dashon Howard), were in fact conoodling, but Ryan takes it one step further, fondling Christine under the guise of feeling her down to make sure she has no weapons. Cameron, a TV director, has to deal with racism even at his work place, like when Tony Danza tells him that an African American character in the show ""Does not sound black enough"". Another plot line folllows Graham (Don Cheadle) and his partner/girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Espiosito). Graham, a police investigator, can never seem to get Ria's race correct. The movie actually starts out with Graham and Ria getting in a car accident and Graham investigating a murder. Graham's mother is always asking him to bring his brother home. His brother has not been seen for a while, and Graham, although worried about him, does not play into his mothers fears, probably to calm her. A lesser plot line, one that could have been deleted completely, is about a Persian store owner and his family, and his purchasing of a gun to protect himself. The most didturbing scene in the movie revolves around his character, but the whole sequence is still needless and rather stupid.Even though the subplot about the Persian store owner is the worst thing in the movie, except for that one very interesting and stirring scene, it does not diminish the films impact. The movie is interesting without being too terribly violent. It works on more intensity than constant action. There is one truely intense scene with a character stuck in a car that is overturned and about to catch fire, and a cop has to save her. The whole scene is much better than it sounds, and is much more intense than I can do justice to. If you have any soul, any compassion for other people, and any view of good, no, great, movies, you have to see this. Yes there is alot of language. Yes there is nudity. Yes there is violence. But what ther is not is a manipulative story line. Even if you hate all three of those things, still see this movie. Even if you hate it, even if you know you'll hate it, you need to see this movie. Get up and see this movie. Now! Go! But if you are not yet convinced, know that after you see this movie you will, like the characters, be a little bit of a better, no, greater, person.Rated R for Language, Violence, Nudity, And Sexual

920411,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000A3XY5A,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 15]","Crash was a surprise winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 2006.  It's a message movie and the Academy obviously liked the message.  The message is that racial intolerance is untenable if you really stop to think about it and see people from some point of view other than your own.What makes this work is a brilliant conception and adroit direction by John Haggis, a believable script by Haggis and Robert Moresco, and fine film editing by Hughes Winborne.  All three won Oscars.  They were able to preach, as it were, without preaching.  By putting people in positions of racial and ethnic irony, they show us that racial prejudice is absurd.  We see events that could happen to anyone regardless of race or ethnicity.  We also see that supposed stereotypical behavior that we may hold against another race or ethnic group is sometimes exactly what we do themselves.  The movie points to the truth that everybody is prejudice in one way or another.The story itself is about several people whose lives accidentally come together (""crash"") in the ethnically and racially diverse, sprawling City of the Angels.  There are two young black guys who could pass for UCLA students (they think since they're in the Westwood area) who hijack the SUV of an LA politico, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) as he and his wife Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) are driving home.  There's a double irony here because one of the guys is complaining that people are afraid of them because they're black in a white neighborhood even as they move toward the hijacking!  Later we meet the mother of one of the black guys whose brother Graham (Don Cheadle) is an LAPD detective who tells his mother he's bedding a white woman, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) who he thinks is Mexican, oblivious of the fact that her parents are from Puerto Rico and El Salvador!There's quite a bit of this ironic confusion about race and ethnicity in the movie, the point being people tend to see others as stereotypes of skin color and language without really being aware of who that person is as an individual.  A Persian shopkeeper is thought of as Arab.  Hindus are thought to be Muslim.  Thais are Chinese.  Ignorance is the basis of racial and ethnic prejudice, is part of Haggis's message.  And he's right.One of the most beautiful sequences in the movie begins when Shereen (Marina Sirtis) buys some bullets in a gunshop for her father, the Persian shopkeeper.  (Pay attention to those bullets!)  Later we see Daniel (Michael Pena) talking to his daughter Lara (Ashlyn Sanchez) who is hiding under her bed because she is afraid of the bullets that used to go off in her old neighborhood.  Daniel gives her his invisible, impenetrable cloak to wear to protect her, taking it off and putting it around her.  Later when the Persian shopkeeper comes hunting Daniel because he thinks Daniel tore up his store, Lara runs to protect her dad who no longer has the impenetrable cloak!  I won't tell you want happens.  You have got to see the sequence yourself.Matt Dillon plays a racially prejudice cop who could pass for a young and less sophisticated real life ex-LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman of O. J. Simpson trial infamy.  He is the central character in another interesting sequence beginning with his groping shakedown of a black man's wife.The stories meld together in a way that reflects how Los Angeles is a cultural melting pot--or is it a salad bowl?  The stories that intertwine bring out the underlining preconceptions and prejudices of the people of that salad bowl (or melting pot) in a way that is more effective than a dissertation or documentary might be.  Yes, there is some contrivance, but I think it's fair to write that off as poetic license.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that although it won the Best Picture Oscar it only cost about $6-million to make.  It's one of the most original films I've seen in quite a while and one of the most effective.",5,"Remarkable take on the clash of cultures in L.A,",1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,3926,"['Crash', 'was', 'surprise', 'winner', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', '2006', 'message', 'movie', 'Academy', 'obviously', 'liked', 'message', 'message', 'racial', 'intolerance', 'untenable', 'really', 'stop', 'think', 'see', 'people', 'point', 'view', 'other', 'own.What', 'work', 'brilliant', 'conception', 'adroit', 'direction', 'John', 'Haggis', 'believable', 'script', 'Haggis', 'Robert', 'Moresco', 'fine', 'film', 'editing', 'Hughes', 'Winborne', 'three', 'won', 'Oscars', 'were', 'able', 'preach', 'were', 'preaching', 'putting', 'people', 'positions', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'irony', 'show', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'absurd', 'see', 'events', 'could', 'happen', 'anyone', 'regardless', 'race', 'ethnicity', 'also', 'see', 'supposed', 'stereotypical', 'behavior', 'may', 'hold', 'race', 'ethnic', 'group', 'sometimes', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'movie', 'points', 'truth', 'everybody', 'prejudice', 'one', 'way', 'another.The', 'story', 'several', 'people', 'lives', 'accidentally', 'come', 'together', 'crash', 'ethnically', 'racially', 'diverse', 'sprawling', 'City', 'Angels', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'black', 'guys', 'who', 'could', 'pass', 'UCLA', 'students', 'think', ""'re"", 'Westwood', 'area', 'who', 'hijack', 'SUV', 'LA', 'politico', 'Rick', 'Cabot', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'wife', 'Jean', 'Cabot', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'are', 'driving', 'home', 'double', 'irony', 'here', 'one', 'guys', 'complaining', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', ""'re"", 'black', 'white', 'neighborhood', 'even', 'move', 'hijacking', 'Later', 'meet', 'mother', 'one', 'black', 'guys', 'brother', 'Graham', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'LAPD', 'detective', 'who', 'mother', 'bedding', 'white', 'woman', 'Ria', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'who', 'Mexican', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'parents', 'are', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'El', 'Salvador', 'quite', 'bit', 'ironic', 'confusion', 'race', 'ethnicity', 'movie', 'point', 'being', 'people', 'tend', 'see', 'others', 'stereotypes', 'skin', 'color', 'language', 'really', 'being', 'aware', 'who', 'person', 'individual', 'Persian', 'shopkeeper', 'thought', 'Arab', 'Hindus', 'are', 'thought', 'be', 'Muslim', 'Thais', 'are', 'Chinese', 'Ignorance', 'basis', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'prejudice', 'part', 'Haggis', 'message', 'right.One', 'most', 'beautiful', 'sequences', 'movie', 'when', 'Shereen', 'Marina', 'Sirtis', 'bullets', 'gunshop', 'father', 'Persian', 'shopkeeper', 'Pay', 'attention', 'bullets', 'Later', 'see', 'Daniel', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'talking', 'daughter', 'Lara', 'Ashlyn', 'Sanchez', 'who', 'hiding', 'bed', 'afraid', 'bullets', 'used', 'go', 'off', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'Daniel', 'invisible', 'impenetrable', 'cloak', 'wear', 'protect', 'taking', 'off', 'putting', 'Later', 'when', 'Persian', 'shopkeeper', 'hunting', 'Daniel', 'Daniel', 'tore', 'up', 'store', 'Lara', 'protect', 'dad', 'who', 'longer', 'impenetrable', 'cloak', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'want', 'happens', 'have', 'got', 'see', 'sequence', 'yourself.Matt', 'Dillon', 'racially', 'prejudice', 'cop', 'who', 'could', 'pass', 'young', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'real', 'life', 'ex-LAPD', 'Det', 'Mark', 'Fuhrman', 'O.', 'J.', 'Simpson', 'trial', 'infamy', 'central', 'character', 'interesting', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'groping', 'shakedown', 'black', 'man', 'wife.The', 'stories', 'meld', 'together', 'way', 'how', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'cultural', 'melting', 'pot', 'salad', 'bowl', 'stories', 'intertwine', 'bring', 'out', 'underlining', 'preconceptions', 'prejudices', 'people', 'salad', 'bowl', 'melting', 'pot', 'way', 'more', 'effective', 'dissertation', 'documentary', 'might', 'be', 'Yes', 'contrivance', 'think', 'fair', 'write', 'off', 'poetic', 'license.Perhaps', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'movie', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'only', 'cost', '6-million', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'one', 'most', 'effective']",Crash
920412,A49NPU6LNZE3V,B000A3XY5A,Derelique,"[4, 6]","All I heard about was how great this movie was.  It seemed all of the movie critics were raving about how powerfully it communicated a message that we all need to hear.  I wasn't even sure what this movie was about until I started watching it, I just knew it was supposed to be great.  Well, now I have seen the movie and I am still unsure of what the message was.  You may think I am an idiot because I didn't find the point totally obvious, but we are all entitled to our own opinions.  The first thing I noticed about the movie is that the dialogue was slightly corny.  I am not sure if it was the words they were speaking, or the actors themselves.  Several times I felt the ""power"" of the movie was being compromised by the ridiculous acting and script.  I did appreciate what the movie was trying to do.  Having a little bit of a background in sociology I thought that Crash at least tried to show us that making generalizations about people based on their physical appearance is wrong.  However, I also feel that this movie managed to somehow propagate several stereotypes.  I was confused as to who was good in this movie and who was bad.  Then I realized that there is no good and bad, there is only the confusion of trying to figure it out.  Most movies are black and white(pardon the pun) when it comes to deciding who to root for. (...following may give away certain plot points...assuming you can actually call it a plot) I do applaud this movie for at least showing us all the shades of grey.  Is the Matt Dillon cop bad because he fondled the attractive black woman, or is he good because he saved her life?  Is the other cop good because sticks up for minorities, or is he bad because he shoots one?  What is the message we are supposed to take from this?  Crash raised several questions in my mind that I think are good to think about and talk about.  Few movies can actually achieve that.  Therefore, even though this movie kind of stunk, it does have its redeeming qualities.  I have to comment on the gentleman who feels that all police officers should have to watch this movie.  Does it really do that good of a job at teaching ethics to cops? Or, did he just want them to see the proper technique for a reach-around?  Anyways, go rent this movie and see it for yourself before forming your opinion.  Regardless of your true opinion you better tell everyone you loved it, so you won't be accused of being a racist by all the white folks that were truly inspired by this powerful movie.",2,Overrated Film,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,2506,"['heard', 'about', 'was', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'seemed', 'movie', 'critics', 'were', 'raving', 'how', 'powerfully', 'communicated', 'message', 'need', 'hear', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'started', 'watching', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'Well', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'am', 'still', 'unsure', 'what', 'message', 'was', 'may', 'think', 'am', 'idiot', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'point', 'totally', 'obvious', 'are', 'entitled', 'own', 'opinions', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'was', 'slightly', 'corny', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'words', 'were', 'speaking', 'actors', 'Several', 'times', 'felt', 'power', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'compromised', 'ridiculous', 'acting', 'script', 'did', 'appreciate', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'Having', 'little', 'bit', 'background', 'sociology', 'thought', 'Crash', 'least', 'tried', 'show', 'making', 'generalizations', 'people', 'based', 'physical', 'appearance', 'wrong', 'However', 'also', 'feel', 'movie', 'managed', 'somehow', 'propagate', 'several', 'stereotypes', 'was', 'confused', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'who', 'was', 'bad', 'Then', 'realized', 'good', 'bad', 'only', 'confusion', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'pardon', 'pun', 'when', 'deciding', 'who', 'root', 'following', 'may', 'give', 'away', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'assuming', 'can', 'actually', 'call', 'plot', 'do', 'applaud', 'movie', 'least', 'showing', 'shades', 'grey', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'cop', 'bad', 'fondled', 'attractive', 'black', 'woman', 'good', 'saved', 'life', 'other', 'cop', 'good', 'sticks', 'up', 'minorities', 'bad', 'one', 'What', 'message', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'Crash', 'raised', 'several', 'questions', 'mind', 'think', 'are', 'good', 'think', 'talk', 'Few', 'movies', 'can', 'actually', 'achieve', 'Therefore', 'even', 'movie', 'kind', 'stunk', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'have', 'comment', 'gentleman', 'who', 'police', 'officers', 'should', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'teaching', 'ethics', 'cops', 'did', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'proper', 'technique', 'reach-around', 'Anyways', 'go', 'rent', 'movie', 'see', 'forming', 'opinion', 'Regardless', 'true', 'opinion', 'better', 'tell', 'everyone', 'loved', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'racist', 'white', 'folks', 'were', 'truly', 'inspired', 'powerful', 'movie']",Crash

The ensemble cast features actors such as Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock actually returning to acting and showing a range I didn't know they had. Most surpising in the film was Chris ""Ludacris Bridges"" as Anthony, he stills almost every scene he's in, and while his performance isn't Oscar worthy it shows that he's one to watch.

This resulted in rioting in African-American neighborhoods, which cost one caucasian truck driver his life (wrong place, wrong time)and ruined many a business in the area (many owned by Koreans and Asians).

From the opening scene of a car collison, the film unfolds to weave several stories to form an intricate web of inter-related events involving the beautifully drawn characters. The basis of the story might have been racial discrimination and stereotyping but beneath this surface, it's really an emotionally-charged collision of unearthed feelings, contradictive thoughts and the emotional freedom that people sometimes deny themselves by refusing to confront reality. Several of the heart wrenching scenes are so beautifully shot that the viewer is almost transposed into the movie itself.Although most of the actors have minimal screen time due to the various stories, the acting is consummate. Don Cheadle is shaping to be a great character actor as his display of emotions is so intense that you feel him. Ludacris, the rapper (whose music I couldn't care less), also shows promise in his big screen debut.For me, I identify most with Sandra Bullock's character, a heavily repressed and unhappy socialite who was robbed at gunpoint with her husband (Brendan Fraser). When her character said, ""I am upset but it's not because of the carjack. I wake up feeling like this every morning. I am angry but I don't know why."" And she falls off the stairs shortly after, only to arrive at the realization of the people and things that matter most.I am deeply surprised by how well the little stories intertwine so flawlessly to present a thought-provoking film. Certainly one of my three favorite movies of 2005 following Closer and Sommersturm (Summer Storm).I urge everyone to see Paul Haggis' Crash and experience 2 hours of feeling again.

We don't rush around here from one racial conflict to the next, really we don't.But Crash isn't concerned with being realistic, or a slice of life. Crash is a film designed to talk about racism, or, rather, to bring racism up, shove our faces in it, and force *us* to talk about it. And it does that very well.Crash brings together characters of different backgrounds and ethnicities whose lives only briefly intersect; usually, when they do, they react to one another based on the most easily noticable differences--race. The movie is well-acted, well-written and well-directed. You might think that--well, it's about racism, so I know that it's going to be straight-forward and present racists as evil and the oppressed as heroic, etc. But, it's not so. Crash has a great deal more sophistication than that, as displayed in the very opening scene where two young black males are complaining how people act afraid of them just because they're young black males... just before they carjack a passing couple. Surprises abound in this movie, and everyone is shown to have virtues and flaws.I've noted that some earlier reviewers complain of the ""preachiness"" of the film, but I can't disagree more. Crash doesn't tell us what to do--it doesn't tell us who is right, who wrong, or even why. It simply says ""we have a problem and it looks like: *this*"" and then leaves us to sort it all out.And because it does this in an inventive, enjoyable and compelling way, I say it is a great film.",5,"Raises Questions Worth Raising, Well",1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,1647,"['Being', 'person', 'born', 'raised', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'good', 'deal', 'Crash', 'place', 'must', 'report', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'rush', 'around', 'here', 'one', 'racial', 'conflict', 'next', 'really', ""don't.But"", 'Crash', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'being', 'realistic', 'slice', 'life', 'Crash', 'film', 'designed', 'talk', 'racism', 'rather', 'bring', 'racism', 'up', 'shove', 'force', '*us*', 'talk', 'very', 'well.Crash', 'brings', 'together', 'characters', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'ethnicities', 'lives', 'only', 'briefly', 'intersect', 'usually', 'when', 'do', 'react', 'one', 'based', 'most', 'easily', 'noticable', 'differences', 'race', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'well-written', 'well-directed', 'might', 'think', 'well', 'racism', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'straight-forward', 'present', 'racists', 'evil', 'oppressed', 'heroic', 'etc', 'not', 'so', 'Crash', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'sophistication', 'displayed', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'young', 'black', 'males', 'are', 'complaining', 'how', 'people', 'act', 'afraid', 'just', ""'re"", 'young', 'black', 'males', 'just', 'carjack', 'passing', 'couple', 'Surprises', 'abound', 'movie', 'everyone', 'shown', 'have', 'virtues', 'flaws.I', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'earlier', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'preachiness', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'Crash', ""n't"", 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'right', 'who', 'wrong', 'even', 'why', 'simply', 'have', 'problem', '*this*', 'then', 'sort', 'out.And', 'inventive', 'enjoyable', 'compelling', 'way', 'say', 'great', 'film']",Crash

It takes on the topic of racism head-on, kind of like a wrecking ball hitting an abandoned building.  In doing so, it offers a trenchant insight into the core of what it is to be human.Instead of being told in a straightforward, linear path, the story is like an omelet that's all mixed up.  It tells how the lives of various people in L.A. are intertwined.  From all walks of life, some of the people are good people, some are bad people and some are REALLY bad people.  As such, the film has a sort of surreal quality about it, and the subtle but effective soundtrack assists to enhance this aspect.Unlike most movies, the film really lacks ""leading"" and ""supporting"" actors.  Virtually all of the characters in the movie could be relegated to one or the other.  It's good that it draws from a strong ensemble of actors / actresses to pull it off, including Sandra Bullock, Brendan Frasier, Ryan Phillipe, Matt Dillon & Don Chaedle.  It's also interesting to note that Bullock, normally America's sweetheart, plays the most unlikable character I've ever seen her portray.Ultimately, the message of the movie is pretty simple, and it is this.  Black people need to grow up.  White people need to grow up.  Hispanics need to grow up.  Middle Eastern Americans need to grow up.  In short, we ALL need to start acting like grown-ups.  That said, the power of the message can only be conveyed by watching the film itself.

I was exceedingly upset after watching the movie not for the plot but for how the filmmaker decided to showcase ""all"" (used very loosely) ethnicities (I WILL NOT USE THE TERM ""RACE"").  I do not want to go too much into why it was disappointing TO ME because some of the specific instances in the movie may give some of it away.  I will say that Asians/Pacific Islanders may be offended if they see under the surface of the movie and discover that Hollywood doesn't like Asians/Pacific Islanders, unless they are used in martial arts movies and, more specifically, if they are female (why are asian/islander women rarely ""coupled"" with asian/islander men in American movies, TV, commercials, etc?  America's fetish for Asian women, perhaps?)  Also, does the ""you all look alike"" joke ever get too old?  It's getting ridiculous...I gave it 2 stars because the rest of it was watchable and it did spark enough of a reaction out of me to be upset.  That and I did very much relate to Don Cheadle's character (great actor).  Although I will say that a lot of the instances where the characters interact are very unrealistic (you'll just have to watch it to see what I mean).I've said enough....I'm getting upset again. But before I close, I will say that on a sociological standpoint, you have to watch films/movies like this one with a shrewd and sensitive eye and not take what it has to offer at face value.  If you think outside of the context of the movie then you MAY understand what I am trying but I'm not expecting it.  But then again, listening to what others had to say induced high hopes which then led to my disappointment so take it or leave it.",2,"Why I despise ""Hollywood""",1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,2000,"['had', 'been', 'hearing', 'long', 'time', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'seeing', 'film', 'may', 'finally', 'get', 'whole', 'ethnic-tension-in-a-film', 'right', 'Sad', 'say', 'was', 'EXTREMELY', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'mostly', 'did', 'not', 'equally', 'cover', 'ethnicities', 'fairly', 'opinion', 'most', 'especially', 'Asians', 'was', 'exceedingly', 'upset', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'plot', 'how', 'filmmaker', 'decided', 'showcase', 'used', 'very', 'loosely', 'ethnicities', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'USE', 'THE', 'TERM', 'RACE', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'why', 'was', 'disappointing', 'TO', 'ME', 'specific', 'instances', 'movie', 'may', 'give', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'Asians/Pacific', 'Islanders', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'see', 'surface', 'movie', 'discover', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'like', 'Asians/Pacific', 'Islanders', 'are', 'used', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'more', 'specifically', 'are', 'female', 'why', 'are', 'asian/islander', 'women', 'rarely', 'coupled', 'asian/islander', 'men', 'American', 'movies', 'TV', 'commercials', 'etc', 'America', 'fetish', 'Asian', 'women', 'perhaps', 'Also', 'look', 'joke', 'ever', 'get', 'too', 'old', 'getting', 'ridiculous', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'rest', 'was', 'watchable', 'did', 'spark', 'enough', 'reaction', 'be', 'upset', 'did', 'very', 'much', 'relate', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'great', 'actor', 'will', 'say', 'lot', 'instances', 'where', 'characters', 'interact', 'are', 'very', 'unrealistic', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'mean', '.I', ""'ve"", 'said', 'enough', '.I', ""'m"", 'getting', 'upset', 'again', 'close', 'will', 'say', 'sociological', 'standpoint', 'have', 'watch', 'films/movies', 'one', 'shrewd', 'sensitive', 'eye', 'not', 'take', 'what', 'offer', 'face', 'value', 'think', 'context', 'movie', 'then', 'MAY', 'understand', 'what', 'am', 'trying', ""'m"", 'not', 'expecting', 'then', 'again', 'listening', 'what', 'others', 'had', 'say', 'induced', 'high', 'hopes', 'then', 'led', 'disappointment', 'so', 'take', 'leave']",Crash
920431,A2MB7ZIINKGPY1,B000A3XY5A,"D. Steinmetz ""dwsteinme""","[5, 10]","Much like another reviewer (Knusper), I began watching this film with some reservations. I'm thinking it would be nothing more than a mass-produced Hollywood race flick with the tried-and-true ""blame it all on whitey"" bottom line. But this stunning motion picture is not like that at all. It's a complex snapshot of modern race relations in America. And so many times, while watching the film, you find yourself asking the question: How would I respond if I were in that situation? How do I feel watching these racially charged episodes play out on the screen?A good example would be the love scene (if you can call it that) between Don Cheadle's character and the lovely Jennifer Esposito. No doubt a sexually explicit scene featuring a fair-skinned woman getting her shag on with a black male is bound to get a reaction. I confess to some uncomfortable feelings myself, then wondered how other audience members reacted to the same scene. How many African-American women felt betrayed, perhaps even angry that a successful black man would choose to be with a Caucasian instead of a 'more deserving' black woman? How many whites watched that with open-jawed disbelief, shocked that such an attractive woman would want to be with 'just a black guy', confident that she would be better off with a 'nice white man'? Yeah, this film gets to you like that, which is exactly what I liked about it. It makes you think. A refreshing departure from the usual stream of mindless sex and violence that normally flows from Tinseltown.Just an interesting sidebar: Jennifer Esposito's character in the film presents herself as a Latina mix, but in real life, she was born in New York to parents of Italian heritage. Another interesting note...the media darling for the 2005 Academy Awards was the gay cowboy love story ""Brokeback Mountain"", which, with 8 nominations, was favored to win for Best Picture. I haven't seen BM and don't need to...not my cup of tea. But I just don't see how a movie about two sheepherders having a gay fling could hold a candle to ""Crash"". The Academy did the right thing in giving the Best Picture honor to this masterpiece.The entire cast was outstanding, but in particular: Matt Dillon as the racist cop.. snobbish, uppity housewife Sandra Bullock, who seems to think everyone is beneath her..Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard, as the upper-crust black couple. Suprisingly, two characters in the film who seem to be open-minded enough..at least in the beginning...to escape the pitfalls of racist behaviour, end up being the movie's two most tragic victims..Ryan Phillippe and Larenz Tate.I just can't identify with others here who gave this film low marks, accusing it of being 'contrived', 'preachy' or 'heavy-handed'. Yes it was 'contrived', all movies are. It takes months, sometimes years, to hammer out a storyline and script for a film like this. As for 'preachy' and 'heavy-handed', oh yeah. This film packs an important message, which may have been part of the problem: Some folks don't like being preached to (usually because they think they already know it all), even if it's a valuable message that needs to be heard: You can't always judge a book by its cover, OR a person by their skin color.",5,A knock-out film.,1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,3225,"['Much', 'reviewer', 'Knusper', 'began', 'watching', 'film', 'reservations', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'mass-produced', 'Hollywood', 'race', 'flick', 'tried-and-true', 'blame', 'whitey', 'bottom', 'line', 'stunning', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'complex', 'snapshot', 'modern', 'race', 'relations', 'America', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'watching', 'film', 'find', 'asking', 'question', 'How', 'would', 'respond', 'were', 'situation', 'How', 'do', 'feel', 'watching', 'racially', 'charged', 'episodes', 'play', 'out', 'screen', 'good', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'scene', 'can', 'call', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'lovely', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'No', 'doubt', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'scene', 'featuring', 'fair-skinned', 'woman', 'getting', 'shag', 'black', 'male', 'bound', 'get', 'reaction', 'confess', 'uncomfortable', 'feelings', 'then', 'wondered', 'how', 'other', 'audience', 'members', 'reacted', 'same', 'scene', 'How', 'many', 'African-American', 'women', 'felt', 'betrayed', 'perhaps', 'even', 'angry', 'successful', 'black', 'man', 'would', 'choose', 'be', 'Caucasian', 'instead', ""'more"", 'deserving', 'black', 'woman', 'How', 'many', 'whites', 'watched', 'open-jawed', 'disbelief', 'shocked', 'attractive', 'woman', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'black', 'guy', 'confident', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', ""'nice"", 'white', 'man', 'Yeah', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'liked', 'think', 'refreshing', 'departure', 'usual', 'stream', 'mindless', 'sex', 'violence', 'normally', 'Tinseltown.Just', 'interesting', 'sidebar', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'character', 'film', 'Latina', 'mix', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'born', 'New', 'York', 'parents', 'Italian', 'heritage', 'interesting', 'note', 'media', 'darling', '2005', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'gay', 'cowboy', 'love', 'story', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', '8', 'nominations', 'was', 'favored', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'BM', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'two', 'sheepherders', 'having', 'gay', 'fling', 'could', 'hold', 'candle', 'Crash', 'Academy', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'giving', 'Best', 'Picture', 'honor', 'masterpiece.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'outstanding', 'particular', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'racist', 'cop..', 'snobbish', 'uppity', 'housewife', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'who', 'think', 'everyone', 'beneath', 'her..Thandie', 'Newton', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'upper-crust', 'black', 'couple', 'Suprisingly', 'two', 'characters', 'film', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'open-minded', 'enough..at', 'least', 'beginning', 'escape', 'pitfalls', 'racist', 'behaviour', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'movie', 'two', 'most', 'tragic', 'victims..Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Larenz', 'Tate.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'others', 'here', 'who', 'gave', 'film', 'low', 'marks', 'accusing', 'being', ""'contrived"", ""'heavy-handed"", 'Yes', 'was', ""'contrived"", 'movies', 'are', 'months', 'sometimes', 'years', 'hammer', 'out', 'storyline', 'script', 'film', ""'preachy"", ""'heavy-handed"", 'oh', 'yeah', 'film', 'important', 'message', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'problem', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'preached', 'usually', 'think', 'already', 'know', 'even', 'valuable', 'message', 'be', 'heard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'person', 'skin', 'color']",Crash

920442,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000A3XY5A,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","This omnibus fable is as provocative as its daring concept - thirty-six successive hours of hostile, racially charged activity intertwining diverse characters in contemporary Los Angeles - and contains some powerful acting. But at the end of it all, I was left rather hollow by the experience. Steeped in allegory with scenes that start with a key assumption (either on the character's part or ours) and end with some unexpected redemption, the novelty of first-time director Paul Haggis' 2005 film is initially powerful but gets wearing over its running time.Haggis ambitiously presents a multi-ethnic city full of unremorseful anger - where the inhabitants without exception eye each other with suspicion and ignorance to the point where the familiar epithets fly. Much of the early dialogue is uncomfortable to hear at first, but Haggis and co-screenwriter Bobby Moresco derive the shock value from the innate familiarity one has with the pent-up feelings expressed in such an unfettered and sometimes blackly humorous manner. The intense honesty of the dialogue is the film's chief virtue, as it is rare for Hollywood to acknowledge any race problem in its backyard. More often, filmmakers pontificate about it from an antiseptic soapbox (consider ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" as a prime example).A labyrinth plot has been constructed entirely out of the fabric of humanity torn mercilessly by racism, and the travails of over a dozen interconnecting characters make for quite a chess game. An ambitious young and white DA and his ice-cold wife are the victims of a carjacking at gunpoint that leads the wife into a state of hostile paranoia. She has the locks changed at their house by a Latino whom she myopically suspects is a gang member. In truth, the locksmith is a devoted family man who must face daily prejudices in his customer-oriented job. The carjackers are two young, seemingly educated black men who commit the crime out of an uncontrollable rage.A black TV director faces the humiliation of seeing his wife groped by a racist white cop, while his young, nave partner watches with equal helplessness. A Persian store owner, constantly labeled an Arab, has his daughter help him buy a gun for protection. A black detective, saddled with his drug-addicted mother and criminal brother, is partnered professionally and personally with a Latina, as they to solve the mystery of a dead body in the road. They all collide in ways that are alternately compelling and manipulative.Most of the acting is stellar, but accommodating the complex plot with an expansive cast does not allow much screen time on an individual basis. Cast against type are two actors more famous for their light comedy roles - Brendan Fraser and an especially unsympathetic Sandra Bullock as the DA and his wife. With this brief role, actually with one confrontation scene, Bullock may just have overcome the hurdle that constantly befalls Meg Ryan - her perky likeability has convincingly been subverted by a sharper, nastier edge of anger. I hope she does more such adventurous work in the future. Michael Pe&ntilde;a plays the locksmith with dignity and provides one of the film's most primal moments when an angry customer blindly seeks restitution from him. Larenz Tate and a particularly impressive Ludacris play the carjackers with intelligence and fury.Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton sharply delineate a marriage where they straddle precariously between their black identities and the white power base that keeps them living in style. Matt Dillon does some of his best work in the challenging role of the racist cop, while a surprisingly effective Ryan Phillippe embodies the moral ambiguity of Dillon's partner with &eacute;lan. As the detective, Don Cheadle - who also served as producer - provides the authority to bring it all together. Even an out-of-character Tony Danza shows up in a cameo as a racist actor complaining that another actor is not sounding ""black"" enough.But there is an evolving contrivance to the story, especially toward the end when plot threads are sewn up in an almost too circular fashion. For example, there is no denying the power of scenes such as the second encounter between Dillon's and Newton's characters or the revelation of the dead body's identity, but there is also a sense of parable that undercuts the credibility of the situations. The fates of key characters seem to follow a similarly moralizing pattern as previously deplorable bigots show their courage and compassion under emotional duress or dyed-in-the-wool liberals tap almost too easily into their inner misogynist. Everything just seems too neatly thought out to make the movie truly transcendent.The DVD is surprisingly skimpy on extras - a throwaway introduction by Haggis, a by-the-numbers making-of featurette that focuses more on how the actors desperately wanted to be part of the film, a music video and several trailers that I fast-forwarded through. Haggis, Moresco and Cheadle  provide concise though informative commentary on an alternate audio track.",3,Truthful Anger Expressed Through Stellar Acting But Thwarted by Contrivance,1129075200,"10

At first, I thought it was slow getting started, and I got kind of bored.  When the grocery store of the Persian family was trashed, I turned it off because I thought there was enough foreshadowing to conclude that either the locksmith or his daughter were about to be harmed.  I absolutely cannot stand to see children hurt in movies like this, or bad things happen to their parents...The next day, I decided I wanted to see what happens, so I started watching where I left off and was very glad that I finished it.  There are too many story lines and connections between characters for me to get into describing them in great detail, but I think this is one of those movies where there's a little of each of us in at least one of the characters.  I just think this is a movie that everyone should see.  It shows how even people who think themselves to not be prejudice at all may still have a little bit of it them, it just takes one instance for it to be brought to the surface.  And it shows that sometimes when we suspect we should be cautious in a situation, our fears are very much valid and we should feel comfortable acting accordingly.Stereotyping and prejudice are all around us.  Whether you're on the giving or the receiving end of it, it's there.  This movie shows you how wrong or how right people can be when they decide to judge others by their race/ethnic origin.

920451,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B000A3XY5A,Emily Todd,"[4, 18]","I remember when I saw Paul Haggis's latest film ""Crash"" early last summer.  It had a bit of buzz but not much but my best friend and I were so intrigued by the preview that we decided to give it a go and saw it one June evening at our favorite theater in Union Square in New York City.By the time the credits began to roll and the lights slowly brightened, we sat there in stunned, bewildered silence; tears silently streaming down our faces.  We both concurred that we had just seen one of the most emotionally distressing, powerful, and moving films ever.  We were flat-out exhausted from the onslaught of raw emotion and utter truth about the state of our society.  ""Crash"" is a film in which both cars and lives slam powerfully and unforgivingly into each other, leaving the victims to sort out the mess. Following the lead of movies such as ""Magnolia,"" one of my favorite films, ""Crash"" chisels its mosaic from angry urban encounters and in-your-face confrontation. This is not a movie in which emotions simmer below the surface; they're quickly brought to a full, dangerous boil that may prove to be simply too much for some audience members to bear; this is NOT a film to be watched casually.The incredibly large cast of over fifteen characters includes such familiar faces as Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito, Ludacris, Larenz Tate, and Loretta Devine, is black, white, Latino, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian. The characters are cops, criminals, victims, and innocent bystanders, but in Haggis' world no one is innocent of the sin of intolerance. As in many ensemble films they often have existing connections that are revealed late in the game, and they divide and recombine in unexpected, often improbable, ways.The film opens with racial hostility right out as Kim Lee (Alexis Rhee) has rear-ended a car carrying Detectives Graham (Cheadle) and Ria (Esposito), and a disagreement over who's at fault leads to an ugly dispute in which Ria mocks Kim's accent and her height and Kim accuses Ria of being an illegal and tells her to go back to Mexico. We then move to a scene in a gun shop, where the middle-aged white owner (Jack McGee) accuses Farhad (Shaun Toub), a Persian convenience-store owner, and his daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh) of being terrorists. Two young black men (Ludacris and Tate) have a debate about unfair treatment and stereotyping but then proceed to carjack some rich white folks (Fraser and Bullock) who seem intimidated by them. While any one of these scenes could work fine on its own, the cumulative effect is awfully repetitive, and the implication that everyone in L.A. is virulently and outspokenly racist hurts Haggis' credibility. Sure, nearly everyone harbors some racial prejudice, but most of us express it a bit more subtly, if at all. Making it so overt so quickly rather than building up to it makes us feel overwhelmed and preached at.The film progresses through a tight series of such confrontations, many of which may seem familiar - the sheer volume guarantees that anyone who's ever experienced racism firsthand, from either side or as a bystander, will feel a bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Though the quick sketching of the characters leaves little room for complexity, it speeds up the process of making us identify and empathize with them, so that when they get in over their heads we feel a sense of involvement. As circumstances push several characters to their breaking points, the film sets up anxious, potentially explosive situations that could go a number of different ways, then makes us squirm while they develop. There's surprising tension and even moments of real elation. Few situations turn out the way we're set up to expect; one life is saved due to a character's bad intentions while another is lost because of good ones; though some ""surprise"" reversals are telegraphed too far in advance.While Haggis' writing lacks subtlety, he's a great actors' director. The performances are uniformly excellent, and there are surprises from some of the most familiar cast members. Phillippe, though cast predictably as the idealistic male ingenue, delivers an unusually grounded, unmannered performance. Bullock, who is so associated with her comedic roles that we may underrate her dramatic skills, has a smart, impassioned monologue that starts with her anger at the men who carjacked her and those around her who've let her down but winds up being about her constant, low-simmering rage; it suggests that rather than being the proximate cause of her fury, the black and Latino characters she lashes out at are merely handy targets for her unacknowledged dissatisfaction with her own life. Even better is the scene between a black television director and his wife (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) that offers a rare glimpse into the conflicts between and within educated, successful African-Americans. After an unwarranted police stop, she's enraged about his refusal to intervene when a cop used the pretense of frisking her to feel her up, even stroking her crotch. She rails against what she sees as cowardly Uncle-Tomism while he insists that he acted the only way he could, that when a white man has the power there's no way to win, so you do what you must to survive.  The film is at its best in moments like these, when Haggis downplays his self-imposed obligation to educate and allows the actors to explore their characters a bit. There's some great stuff there between all the object lessons; if only there were fewer of those to slog through. Like too many filmmakers taking on a large subject, Haggis seems to feel that he has to address it comprehensively. He explores virtually every imaginable permutation of racism, showing that resentment breeds resentment, that those who feel oppressed by the stereotyping they face don't hesitate to do the same to others, nor do they necessarily grasp the irony. He posits that institutionalized racism can force a person to turn against others like himself, as when a black police sergeant (Keith David) covers up racial profiling and harassment by a man in his command so as to keep his own record clean. A corrupt system can corrupt those who must work in it, but overreaching ambition, too, has its dangers.",5,"""You think you know who you are.

To all the writers, directors, producers, actors and anyone involved in this film and to God (seriously) for giving them such inspiration, wisdom and guidance on a delicate topic made so amazingly geniously! This film is truly, a MUST see, just as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" is one of those types, so is this one! Everyone over the age of 18 needs to see this!

920454,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B000A3XY5A,Erica Anderson,"[2, 3]","Director/writer Paul Haggis follows up ""Million Dollar Baby"" with ""Crash"", a gritty film on racial stereotypes. The film takes place in Los Angeles, a hotbed for racial tension over the years from the Rodney King beating and to a recent violent showdown that led to one unarmed man dying. The story revolves around a handful of characters who do are complete strangers to each other but they in some odd way have a connection to each other. The events that occurs in the film is in a 24 hour setting.The film begins with rapper Ludacris as Anthony and Larenz Tate as They carjack Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Rick's (Brandon Frasier)Navigator so they can sell the car to a chop shop for cash. Frankly the film should have found other actors to play Jean and Rick. I have yet to see a convincing performance from Sandra Bullock and Brandon Frasier in this lifetime.Matt Dillion plays veteran cop officer Ryan who just happens to be a racist cop. Ryan Phillipe plays his partner officer Hanson who doesn't stand up to officer Ryan. When they hear about the carjacking they come across another Navigator but in the car is Christine (the lovely Thandie Newton) and her husband Cameron (Terrance Howard). Their confrontation leaves Christine feel violated while her husband feels helpless and scared because he didn't come to his wife's aid. Officer Ryan later has another confrontation with a black woman named Shaniqua (Loretta Devine)because of his father who is ailing and he feels that his father isn't getting the adequate treatment.Then there is the Persian store owner who runs a corner market with his wife. He buys a guy to protect the store. There is a failure of communication between him and the hispanic locksmith who came to fix the lock at his store. I loved this particular story. This was probably the most convincing story in the film. Excellent performances as well.Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito play detectives who just happens to be lovers. Frankly I found Jennifer Esposito as Ria laughable. She was as 'convincing' as a detective as Cindy Crawford was convincing as a lawyer in ""Fair Game"". Don Cheadle as Graham was excellent to say the very least. His performance was intense. I liked the portrayal of his relationship with his mother played by Nona Gaye.The language used in the film was definitely strong and at times made me uneasy which is good. There should be more films like ""Crash"" that makes the filmgoer uncomfortable and later think. ""Crash"" is easily the best drama I have seen this year so far. The message of racial stereotypes and how easy it is for everyone of every race to make generalizations about people of other ethnicities.

Definitely.But ""Crash"" rises above the pitfalls of similar films, dealing with racial and cultural barriers beyond black and white, avoiding stereotypes while still admitting they exist.  The director deftly threads a number of stories together.  Although this may seem overwhelming at first, it quickly pulls together into an engrossing tale.  The acting is flat-out amazing.  Five or six actors deserve awards for their performances, but they may cancel each other out at Oscar time.  The screenplay is brilliant.  It will receive an Oscar nomination, I have no doubt.I knew this would be a ""heavy"" film.  As I watched, I found my heart twisting into knots.  And yet, somehow, the director makes sure to give us moments to catch our breath without losing the story's pace.  Scenes that seemed to lead to inevitable consequences often surprised me, with redemptive moments for a number of the characters.  Not all works out for good, but the movie left me feeling uplifted and challenged at the same time.Can we learn to appreciate others' differences?

People spout off bigoted and evil nonsense, and then, ironically, some of them turn out to be justified!  I also learned that good communication skills are vital when trying to speak to a shopkeeper whose lock you are trying to fix.  If it turns out that he needs a whole new door, but you've replaced his lock anyway, actually taking him over to show him the new lock you've installed and how he still may want to replace his door could avoid a long and pointless screaming match.  Visual aides always help.I learned that spending a lot of camera time focused on a 60 year old man trying unsuccessfully to make wee-wee in a closet-sized bathroom causes a viewer to squint and look away, eventually to become involved in picking at his or her fingernails.There was a very pleasant scene between a father and his 5 year old daughter in which he gave her what he claimed was an invisible bullet deflecting cloak that was given to him by a fairy.  I thought that was good, because then the movie would have to kill one of them.  Either the dad, for irony's sake, or the child, so we could all be sad when she looked at her dad and said, ""But the fairy told you a bullet couldn't hurt me.""  I wondered if it would be pathos or irony?  Irony or pathos?  My tears were eager to flow, either way.I never found out, because after 51:03 into the film, I couldn't take anymore.  I'll try and get back to it later, to find out if there's any hope for Los Angeles and social justice.  In the meantime, I'm left looking at the second disc in my WideScreen Two Disc Deluxe Edition, and I'm wondering what could have been encoded on this bit of plastic instead of interviews with Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon?

920461,A150QZUUQAN21X,B000A3XY5A,Fallout Girl,"[4, 6]","Wow, where to begin? The opening scenes of Crash made me roll my eyes and hate it. Back in the day I had a neighbor (a white female) who believed that there was no such thing as a non-racist white person, and that we should all pay some sort of tax to the black people for our continuing racism towards them. Well, the beginning of Crash seemed like it was filmed by that exact kind of illogical, paranoid, guilt-tripped person. To add to that, I live in New York City, considered by many to be the most obnoxious place on earth. I've lived here for 15 years, and I'm yet to hear someone - anyone! - making fun of a black person for riding a bus, or because their name is ""Snaniqua"". I've never seen a Chinese person yell anything about ""those %&$(@& Mexicans"". I currently live in a multicultural neighborhood where Italian, Arab, Chinese, Latin American and Russian people co-exist without racial bias. I've lived next to about five Arab-run delis for years, and none of them has ever been vandalized. Maybe L.A. is different, but somehow I find it hard to believe.That said, the stereotypes in the beginning of Crash made me wonder whether it was worth my time to continue with it. I was sure it would end up being a 1-star movie for me. However, as the movie unfolded, it became something completely different, and ended up making a tremendous impact on me. I'm not normally a fan of those overblown dramas that Hollywood loves to push as ""important"" and ""groundbreaking"", but Crash was a surprisingly well done, beautiful and moving film that touched something deep inside my heart. People who believe this movie is about racism are wrong. It's about humanity that we all share, regardless of skin color or background. Racism is nothing but veneer, an excuse people use to find faults in others. And when push comes to shove, for most of us it's nearly not as strong as what connects us all as human beings.

That goes for the movie too. It thinks it knows what it is, but I'm not so sure.This incident, which is supposed to be the worst ""racist"" act in the movie, shows that the filmmakers may have wanted to talk about one thing, but they wound up talking about something else too.Supposedly it's about race in the United States, and it is. Every scene, every sentence almost, has the characters seeing the world across ""racial"" divides: white/black, Iranian/white, white/Hispanic, black/Chinese, Iranian/Arab, Chinese/Thai, and more. We're repeatedly shown characters who are discriminated against, but who find excuses to treat other minorities as though they were less than human.But while watching all these characters you get pounded with another message too - - women are things. In this movie a woman's so-called race is often just another epithet used against her. What really makes her less than human is that she's female.A man tells his mother on the phone he can't talk because he's ""f*****g a Mexican."" They're both police detectives - - and partners. She asks how she can be Mexican when one of her parents was Puerto Rican and one Salvadoran. She also asks, ""What kind of man says something like that to his mother?"" It turns out his mother has dementia and doesn't remember anything he says or does, but that surprise (which supposedly humanizes the male detective) doesn't make saying it like that any less degrading to his partner.A white cop pulls an affluent black couple over and feels up the wife while making the husband beg to be let off with a warning instead of being arrested. She's just an object the cop uses against the husband, a way of saying,  ""I can violate your property - - or you - - any time I want."" Even the wife thinks of herself this way. Later she tells her husband she was outraged ""for you."" (I wonder if most women going through that kind of humiliation would feel worse about how it made their husbands feel than how it made them feel.)The Los Angeles district attorney and his wife (both white) are car-jacked by two blacks, Anthony and Peter. Back home, Mrs. District Attorney yells at her husband about changing the locks on their house again in the morning because she doesn't trust the Hispanic locksmith ""with prison tattoos"" working on the door now. She screams at her husband, ""You're not listening to me!"" For her husband she's just an attractive appendage for campaign appearances. (Thin, with long dark hair, Sandra Bullock makes you think of the ""First Lady"" of California.)The district attorney's wife suspects he's having an affair with an aide (who's black) and glances between the two make it look like she's right. After the D.A.'s wife has fallen down the stairs and almost killed herself, she talks to her husband on the phone. It looks like he and his aide have just had a tryst. He lets his aide know her place in his life by telling his wife he loves her in front of the aide.The D.A.'s wife tells her Hispanic maid (who she treated like crap but who was the only one there to take her to the hospital), ""You're the only friend I've got."" We're supposed to see a domestic and an employer from different races, but what strikes you is two human beings who have something very important in common - - they're both women - - who need each other to survive.Only one male character in this film - - the locksmith - - has a decent relationship with women. He tries to protect his little girl (physically, by moving to a neighborhood with less crime, and psychologically, by giving her something that also protects her from her fears).Big plot twist below.Crash has one of the most unbelievable coincidences I've ever seen in what was supposed to be a serious film and not a comic book movie. The white cop who molested the black woman in front of her husband comes on a traffic accident (the next day) where that woman is pinned under her car about to be blown up by leaking gasoline. He's the only one who can save her. At first she resists, screaming, ""Not you!"" But then, seeing she's about to die, she begs for his help. He pulls out his knife (could we get any more Freudian here?) and tells her how he's going use it to cut her loose. He saves her, she's grateful, and the white audience can let themselves sympathize with this character again. And if we can forgive him for what he's done, we can forgive ourselves for the things we're ashamed of.There are two things I liked about Crash. First, the acting. Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Chris Bridges, and Thandie Newton are great. Big stars like Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock get to do something more than the idiotic comedies they're usually in. (Sandra Bullock has the best scene I've seen her in for years.) Tony Danza (I didn't even recognize him until halfway through the scene) gets to play both an unpleasant and (for a change) an intelligent character. Jennifer Esposito (usually stuck playing a bride of Dracula or a neo-noir gun moll) is another intelligent actor. It's easy to see why the actors wanted to be in this movie.And if most Hollywood movies weren't crap based on ""graphic novels,"" we'd get to see more of the kind of interesting characters actors like Gloria Grahame used to play. It's dispiriting to see writers and directors of films like Following and Memento pretending that the world needs another Batman movie. (""No, really. This time we're going to get to the psychological core of the Dark Knight."") Even Quentin Tarantino treats his material more honestly, and more like the real world, despite all the swords and philosophizing assassins.The other thing I liked is that after two hours of people crashing into each other there was a little hope at the end. The car-jacker Anthony has a chance to make a lot of money by selling some illegal Thai immigrants he finds locked in a van he stole (a lot of them near-naked women destined for the sex trade). Instead he turns them loose in Chinatown, and spends his own money to buy them food (with a racist remark to the ""Chinaman"" he gives the money to). Anthony's a hood, but not a hypocrite, and he's not going to make money from slavery.As he tells them to get out of the truck, he prepares them for life in the United States: ""This is America. Chop chop. Time is money.""",3,"""You think you know who you are.""",1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,6392,"['what', 'veteran', 'white', 'cop', 'who', 'just', 'sexually', 'molested', 'black', 'woman', 'stopped',

The main problem with this movie is that it tries way too hard to push the racism issue over and over again to the point of nausea. This isn't a film that lets you decide on your own about anything: it beats you over the head with it, and, just to make sure, hits you again.Watching the movie, there was one thought that continued to come into my mind: Could a movie be more stereotypical or prototyped? All the characters have some racism agenda on their minds or in their lives. We have the two thugs who don't believe they have been given a chance in society. We have the white racist cop. We have the two white yuppie-wannabes. We have the foreign store clerk. Can this movie pick out a few more stereotypes to throw at us?There are so many issues that irked me about this film. I know that we should not take everything we see at face-value in a film, but this film was so overtly blunt and forceful about it's theme of racism that it really got quite annoying. There literally is no shred of subtleness in this film: we know exactly what the characters seemingly are about. Another annoyance was the absolute preposterous circumstances and situations that seemingly arise again and again, namely the coincidence of the white racist cop (Matt Dillon) saving the black woman who he just happened to abuse the night earlier during a traffic stop.The characters were so one-dimensional it is hard to comprehend how this film received so many accolades. For the record, Sandra Bullock's character was one of the most nauseating characters I've seen in a while.I found myself rolling my eyes at the ridiculousness of it all. Then again, Hollywood seemingly has a knack for this.The biggest problem is that this movie got the big prize, the picture of the year. If it hadn't been nominated, maybe it could have a sleeper that everyone got behind and talked about.

Another car rear ended them, though, and Esposito's character begins exchanging racial epithets with the older Asian woman who drove the other car as Cheadle walks over to the crime scene. From there, the film flashes back to yesterday and the events leading up to the homicide. These two days are racially tense, violent, thought-provoking and, at times, incredibly sweet. Through chance meetings, each of the characters crosses the paths of the others, learning of each other's prejudices and dealing with their own. This large ensemble cast works incredible magic using an intelligent, racially charged script from writer/director Paul Haggis (who also wrote the script for Million Dollar Baby). And when I say large ensemble cast: Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Loretta Divine, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Marina Sirtis (for all you fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation), Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Ludacris, Daniel Dae Kim (for the fans of Lost), Tony Danza, and Terrence Dashon Howard.

It just sounded so stupid and self-important, I had to check it out.  And midway thru the film I was a little concerned; it was ridiculously single-minded and repetitive and populated with shallow cardboard cutout characters, but it wasn't as offensively stupid as I'd anticipated.  It was a solid C movie at that point.  Fortunately, 'Crash' went COMPLETELY to hell in the second half with a bunch of hopelessly implausible, utterly asinine and unintentionally comic episodes.  Let me assure you, the second half of this movie is one long guffaw.  I anticipated being angry at this film, but it's almost charmingly moronic and cheap.  Almost.  I *am* angry, however, at the people who are labeling this a great film.  I particularly enjoy Roger Ebert's defense he wrote for it a while ago, where he's just short of saying that yes, it is an utterly moronic, hopelessly manipulative piece of junk, but it has GOOD INTENTIONS!!! dammit, so take your damn medicine!  I especially love the great language people use to rename the worst aspects of `Crash':  These aren't shallow, cliched characters, they're `archetypes', this movie isn't a bunch of simplistic, contrived scenarios, it's a series of `parables'. (Yeah, 20 parables, each of which has exactly the same message.  And parables aren't exactly known for their dramatic value either.  And finally, parables are at least vaguely symbolic; these scenarios aren't)  Of course, they've gotta do this, cause if they described it accurately it'd sound like a terrible film, sound like the sorta film they'd all pan if it weren't a VERY IMPORTANT FILM!!!!!  The critics are correct, however, in saying that most of the performances are excellent, but the movie is just too idiotic and manipulative allow this to really help any.  In a way it makes it worse, to see these people put the effort into such an absurd farce of a film.Yes, this movie does contain the thrilling, shocking message that RACISM IS BAD!  People think this movie is gonna reduce racial tension?  Give me a frickin' break.  First of all, no movie ever really changes anyone, and second, it doesn't even really make any sort of intelligible statement.  People are racist, the film says, and that makes bad things happen, or it at least makes bad things happen in the hilarious fantasy land of 'Crash', where everyone is a raving lunatic.  That is absolutely all their is to it.  There is no real discussion of racism in this film whatsoever.  But, surprisingly, it isn't the shallow, heavy handed message which gets to me.  It's the fact that in order to facilitate this supposed message they created some of the most dramatically lame scenes imaginable.This movie doesn't really have a plot, actually, it's mostly just a pile of random scenes and coincidences.  I don't mind this in and of itself, really, but most of the individual scenarios prove to be very stupid, and again, exactly the same.  The characters are absurdly flat and simplistic, though they do all show a tendency to behave in a manner utterly inconsistent with that which we saw earlier: The ravingly racist cop risks his life to save a black woman in a staggeringly melodramatic scene, (the scene where the movie really went to hell, by the way); the calm, arguably cowardly black man flips out and takes on a couple of armed thieves and whole pack of cops and so on.  The film has a ton of characters, so they couldn't have fleshed them out much, but Haggis doesn't even seem to try.But, again, up until the midpoint the film is just kinda stupid and simple-minded, but not really offensively bad.  It's repetitious, as it's just people being racist or complaining about racism and so on, but it's still all right.  But then when Haggis tries to make things come together, oh my god!  The second half of this film has 3 major climactic scenes which are just unbearable, the latter 2 of which are amongst the weakest scenes of all-time.  First we've got the aforementioned  racist cop and black woman whom he molested earlier scene.  This scene is just so amusing because it's unbelievably operatic, as if I care about either of these losers.  Let `em burn.  The real rock-bottom centerpiece of the film, the scene that really earns it the resounding F, is the confrontation between Daniel and the Iranian shop owner.  I don't wanna specifically spoil it, but this is by far the most manipulative scene I can think of in any film I've ever seen.  I could see where it might be going, and I thought, no, no way Haggis thinks this little of me.  No way he'd use such a low, obvious tactic, such easy, forced emotion.  And then he actually does it, and what's more he shot it in such an over the top fashion that I actually laughed aloud at the climactic, supposedly tragic moment.  And then, after all that, he uses a ridiculous cop out, unwilling to go through with the forced emotional manipulation that he just thrust on the audience.  Seriously, this scene is so bad that I wanna hit Paul Haggis in the face.  He deserves it.  And then we've got another major scene where Phillipe's character picks up a hitchhiker that is just so stupidly, contrived, and all based on the sort of bullsh*t movie miscommunication that never happens in the real world that it just really makes me angry.  (And it also involves characters behaving in a way utterly incosistent with what we've seen earlier.)  Shortly thereafter the movie just ends, kinda randomly, what with it's not having a central plot or anything, and thank god.  The rest of the film was just kind of foolish and inconsequential, but man, that stuff just really irritates me.  How about you get to work on a `Walker: Texas Ranger' film Haggis. (Which he created, amusingly enough.)  You ain't prepared to deal with serious topics.Uhh, what a pathetic joke this film is.  Just when you thought mainstream film criticism couldn't get any more ridiculous they go around declaring this laughable PC pap one of the best films of the year.

920480,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B000A3XY5A,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[7, 10]","When Paul Haggis was 47 years old, in 2000-he walked away from a lucrative career as a television writer-and he began to court the 900 lb behemoth of Feature Films. He bought up the rights for some boxing short stories-and out of that MILLION DOLLAR BABY emerged golden. But prior to that-he and his partner, Bobby Moresco, developed CRASH. Haggis was originally slated to direct BABY, but CRASH was still in post-production-and the rest is Eastwood and Oscars.The movie opens up with a crash-that we don't hear, like a silent scream. Don Cheadle does a remarkable job as Detective Graham Waters. After the accident, he wanders into a crime scene-that had jammed up the road. He recognizes the body. Fade out-prologue as epilogue-and it worked well. Perhaps, Haggis was inspired, in part by Cronenberg's 1996 film, CRASH-a car crash sexy cult film. It postulated that there is a connection between the violence of a car crash and the passion of the sexual act.This new film is a Robert Altman-like cross-cutting storyline kind of film-juggling several characters and several scenarios-that at some point all touch each other. Cheadle's character surmised that the is so little sense of touch in the big city-that people just have to crash into each other in order to induce it. It is about prejudice-racism, sexism, elitism, and several other kinds. It is about being too many millions in a small space-about the madness of urban cohabitation.Matt Dillon gave one of his best performances as Sgt. Ryan, LAPD-as a conflicted patrol officer that presented the world is hard shell, his arrogance, and his abuse of his constabulary position. Perhaps the streets made him that way-cost him a marriage and friends. But he, also, had a heightened sense of duty that could seem impervious to danger-and an earnest willingness to perform those duties. This film elevates Dillon to a new dramatic status.Sandra Bullock played Jean Cabot-the snotty trophy wife of LA's District Attorney. Her conceit and judgmental manner left her few redeeming qualities-but like many others in the film, circumstances dictated that she ultimately behave in a way contrary to our first impression of her. Brendan Fraser played DA ""Rick"" Cabot. He found just the right amount of good looks, political machinations, and insincerity posting as sincerity-and poor ethnic attitudes buried behind closed doors. Thandie Newton gave a powerful performance as Christine-the light-skinned loud-mouthed wife of a black TV director. Terrence Howard played Cameron-the black TV director. He did a terrific job of conveying the torment of having to face his own tokenism. His frustration and anger nearly costs him his life when he has a mixed-up run in with the LAPD. This strong principal performances were well supported by Ryan Phillipe, Larenz Tate, Ludacris, Michael Pena, Shaun Toub, William Fichtner, Jennifer Esposito, Keith David, and Tony Danza.I found this film to be audacious and fearless-and tremendously thought-provoking and entertaining-as well as ambitious.

Does he say anything? Nope.  Just gets in a huff and walks away.  He takes a job for an Iranian shopkeeper who accuses him of ripping him off when he says the door needs fixed.  He is called for everything but does our modern day saint complain?  Nope.  Then said shopkeeper thinking he has broke into his shop goes round with a gun, aims it at him and shoots his daughter!  Does he complain?  Nope just hugs his daughter and wails!Now you or me (or any normal person)  Some nut comes round to your house and shoots your kids do you. A. call the police B. Red mist descends and pick up the nearest blunt instrument and go for him or C. Have a cry about life in general.  Seems if you are Hispanic according to this film you do C.Then we have the Latin maid who is treated worse than an animal by same white middle class woman who when has an accident calls on her to help (which she of course does)Again any normal person A. Step over the evil old bag and leave her there B. Call an ambulance if you can be bothered C. Do everything you can to help because hey, that's your position in life.Seems Hispanics have replaced that old 'loyal black servant' of 1950s movies.Then we have the Hispanic lady who is racially abused by her own boyfriend.  Does she A. Get dressed tell him to f off and die B. Punch him as hard as possible in the face nope C. Goes for a cry in the bathroom.The point of all this is this film is just as bigoted as the bigots it is trying to examine.

920483,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000A3XY5A,Grady Harp,"[8, 11]","and the only time they come into contact is by crash'.  And with these words Paul Haggis tears open the box of CRASH, one of the most searingly vital and important films of the year.  This is a film that explores prejudice, racism, fear, hate, bigotry, random violence and all of those barriers we people of the cities have erected to isolate ourselves from the miscegenated world in which we live.  In Haggis' hands every possible form of miscommunication based on ignorance and transference of self-loathing is woven together in a story that mixes Caucasian, African American, Asia, Persian, Hispanic conflicts and lifestyles and the concurrent disruption of world views gone wrong into a pungent story of tragedy and collision.Every character in this well-crafted script eventually confronts every other character in ways that are at times coincidental, at times, tangential, and at other times the direct result of prior confrontations.  African Americans bully each other over their own prejudices, Caucasians belittle their Hispanic workers and are the first to point the finger at the 'tattooed gangsters' who in reality are innocent tradesmen, Persians terrorized on their property immediately aim their hate at other minority suspects, redneck racist policemen thrash out at African Americans in response to their own personal family demons that have eroded their outlook and extend that venom to the most innocent of the rookie cops who metamorphose into like habits.  Every form of prejudice and hate is encountered and none of the characters is free from being both the perpetrator and the victim.  It is as though the Golden Rule of 'Do unto others as you would have others do unto you' has been hideously transformed into a reason for violence.Each member of this extraordinary ensemble acting team is outstanding form those with the largest parts to those whose presence is fleetingly meaningful.  And some of the actors heretofore know as B actors rise to the level of brilliance under Haggis' knowing direction.  Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard (here is a star!), Thandie Newton, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Larenz Tate, Loretta Devine (extraordinary!), Beverly Todd, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Pena (who delivers the most affecting scene in the film), Shaun Toub, Yomi Perry, Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Tony Danza, William Fichtner - indeed, the list of the entire cast should be included in the kudos.People leave the theater stunned, tearful, informed, and incredulous, so great is the impact of this film.  Much or that impact is aided by the brilliantly creative cinematography of James Muro and Dana Gonzales and by the powerful musical score by Mark Isham.  This is quite simply one of the finest films of the year by anyone's standards.  For those critics who descry Haggis' lack of providing 'Redemption' for the characters, this viewer would take offense: every character is altered either tangentially, directly, or referentially by the tightly woven tapestry that is CRASH.  Recommended for everyone to see, internalize, and begin to make changes on our planet.  Grady Harp, July 05",5,"'In LA, people don't touch.

It's a fast-moving, character piece following a dozen or so denizens of L.A. focusing on race and the subtle, and also less subtle, interplay between them as they are involved in car crashes, police investigations and personal relationships. Different types of racism are profiled from overt, outright hatred to more nuanced, but powerful, forms like institutional bias.Odious characters are partially redeemed, seemingly `good' people commit the worst atrocities. No one is spared in this brilliant script as personal and social tragedies fly by thick and fast. The mess that is Los Angelean life is put under the microscope and each act requires a mental dance to figure out the ethics of the many protagonists. Fittingly enough, there's no ""black or white"" only many varying shades of grey.Paul Haggis' direction is similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's in Magnolia, but due to its core message and convincing characters instead of stereotypes it exceeds Magnolia by a long way. Compare and contrast Magnolia's rain of frogs with Crash's snow flurry as a uniting element towards the end. The frogs symbolise the random, unpredictable turns of life, whereas the snow can be taken in many different ways; oppressive, cold, beautiful, all-encompassing, dangerous. It's even an important factor in many car collisions. The way the characters connect is also all too believable even in a city where famously no-one meets each other in the street.While there are no concrete answers proposed to this deeply-entrenched mess of a situation there are hints that focusing on and enjoying each other's humanity rather than fixating on ethnic make-up is the only way to gain any kind of personal freedom and improve the situation. While this may be a little clich?d, the consequences of ignoring this message are clearly depicted and are enough to force even the most passive viewer to examine their own ideas.This is one of the best films I've seen in a long while. Impressively, for a movie that tackles such complex subject matter, it still remains highly watchable, moving and not one bit `preachy' or patronising.

Other reviewers have explained very well who the characters are and give good overviews on what kinds of things happen in this film so I won't repeat what was said and will concentrate on what I've got out of this film.Although I don't regard this film as a masterpiece, it's one of the more poignant films I've seen on the issue of race in a long time.  It's not as poignant as ""American History X"" but I think it's a film that makes us think more about how we perceive things.  All of the characters in this film who seemed to espouse certain extreme views all had very serious problems that they were dealing with in their personal lives.  ""Misery loves company"" and race is one of those things that seem to empower different people.  The film showed that when many of us feel weak, vulnerable, impotent, hurt, etc. we look for things to impower us which so many times happens to be race.  Which leads me to the premise that people who are truely happy with themselves and their lives have no reason to show any animosity towards anyone or anything.  There was one character in this film who seem to have that quality.It's healthy to stand up for injustice, but when one just does things with the intention to hurt somebody because they are hurt, it becomes counter productive.  Mean-spirited and spiteful attacks (whether verbal or physical) do nothing but show others how miserable the perpetrators are.  We must constantly remind ourselves that there is nothing empowering about resorting to physical or verbal violence when we can't deal with our own problems.  In fact, it's my opinion that one who resorts to mean-spirited and spiteful attacks show not only that they are very miserable people, but that they are also impotent (no pun intended, but that may very well be the case as well :-) ).",4,excellent film... thought provoking and poignant,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,1872,"['one', 'lastest', 'films', 'issue', 'race', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'give', 'good', 'overviews', 'what', 'kinds', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'will', 'concentrate', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'film.Although', 'do', ""n't"", 'regard', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'more', 'poignant', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'issue', 'race', 'long', 'time', 'not', 'as', 'poignant', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'think', 'film', 'think', 'more', 'how', 'perceive', 'things', 'characters', 'film', 'who', 'seemed', 'espouse', 'certain', 'extreme', 'views', 'had', 'very', 'serious', 'problems', 'were', 'dealing', 'personal', 'lives', 'Misery', 'company', 'race', 'one', 'things', 'seem', 'empower', 'different', 'people', 'film', 'showed', 'when', 'many', 'feel', 'weak', 'vulnerable', 'impotent', 'hurt', 'etc', 'look', 'things', 'impower', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'race', 'Which', 'premise', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'truely', 'happy', 'lives', 'have', 'reason', 'show', 'animosity', 'anyone', 'anything', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'quality.It', 'healthy', 'stand', 'up', 'injustice', 'when', 'one', 'just', 'things', 'intention', 'hurt', 'somebody', 'are', 'hurt', 'counter', 'productive', 'Mean-spirited', 'spiteful', 'attacks', 'verbal', 'physical', 'do', 'nothing', 'show', 'others', 'how', 'miserable', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'must', 'constantly', 'remind', 'nothing', 'empowering', 'resorting', 'physical', 'verbal', 'violence', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'own', 'problems', 'fact', 'opinion', 'one', 'who', 'mean-spirited', 'spiteful', 'attacks', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'very', 'miserable', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'impotent', 'pun', 'intended', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'case', 'as', 'well']",Crash

Written and directed by Paul Haggis, who did the screenplay for MILLION DOLLAR BABY, CRASH is a richly layered and nuanced commentary on race in America. Almost no group gets left out, whites, blacks, Asians, latinos, Persians. Then we have characters from different strata of our society-- upper middle class whites: (Brendan Frazer is a well-off district attorney in LA who is interested in only one thing: staying in office; and working-class whites: Matt Dillon in an outstanding performance plays an LA racist cop whose father is old and poor, suffering from a chronic kidney infection and cannot change his HMO physician. The blacks are just as varied. Some characters are upper middle-class-- Terrence Howard is a TV producer-- to LA detectives (Don Cheadle) to black street types whose occupation is carjacking and robbery.What makes this movies amazing and one you'll want to see again is that the director takes an unflinching look at racism in this country, all kinds of it; and nobody gets off scot-free. He makes it more than a cut and dried, black and white issue. There are no heroes here, and even racists sometimes can do something right. Asians discriminate against other Asians. A racist white woman's best friend turns out to be her Latino maid. A black man tells his mother he is sleeping with a white woman rather than say she is Mexican-- which she isn't really-- because it will offend his mother more. This movie goes a long way in supporting my theory that unfortunately many minorities discriminate against all other minorities.I knew I was viewing a complex work of art when scenes that made me mildly uncomfortable brought uproarious laughter from the two men sitting behind me who were of a different race.This is one of the best movies you'll see this year.",5,One Of The Best Movies Of The Year,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,1855,"['What', 'happened', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'supposed', 'make', 'movies', 'good', 'Written', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'who', 'did', 'screenplay', 'MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'BABY', 'CRASH', 'richly', 'layered', 'nuanced', 'commentary', 'race', 'America', 'Almost', 'group', 'left', 'out', 'whites', 'blacks', 'Asians', 'latinos', 'Persians', 'Then', 'have', 'characters', 'different', 'strata', 'society', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'whites', 'Brendan', 'Frazer', 'well-off', 'district', 'attorney', 'LA', 'who', 'interested', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'staying', 'office', 'working-class', 'whites', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'LA', 'racist', 'cop', 'father', 'old', 'poor', 'suffering', 'chronic', 'kidney', 'infection', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'HMO', 'physician', 'blacks', 'are', 'just', 'varied', 'characters', 'are', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'TV', 'producer', 'LA', 'detectives', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'black', 'street', 'types', 'occupation', 'carjacking', 'robbery.What', 'movies', 'amazing', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'director', 'unflinching', 'look', 'racism', 'country', 'kinds', 'nobody', 'scot-free', 'more', 'cut', 'dried', 'black', 'white', 'issue', 'are', 'heroes', 'here', 'even', 'racists', 'sometimes', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'right', 'Asians', 'discriminate', 'other', 'Asians', 'racist', 'white', 'woman', 'best', 'friend', 'out', 'be', 'Latino', 'maid', 'black', 'man', 'mother', 'sleeping', 'white', 'woman', 'rather', 'say', 'Mexican', ""n't"", 'really', 'will', 'offend', 'mother', 'more', 'movie', 'long', 'way', 'supporting', 'theory', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'minorities', 'discriminate', 'other', 'minorities.I', 'knew', 'was', 'viewing', 'complex', 'work', 'art', 'when', 'scenes', 'made', 'mildly', 'uncomfortable', 'brought', 'uproarious', 'laughter', 'two', 'men', 'sitting', 'who', 'were', 'different', 'race.This', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year']",Crash

Well, it ends out being an excellent, powerful and intense movie definitely in my top 5 of all time after Frailty, American History X and Ghost World. As most of you probably already know, this movie is about Los Angeles and a group of people there that will collide with one another. There's a large variety of them including the rich and powerful, poor, cops, and foreigners. At the start of the movie, there was only one that I liked, and in the end, I liked more. But then there were the some that you had no feelings about and others that you dissliked. This movie is so powerful because I connected with the characters. I had different feelings towards each one and that made me have mixed reactions to all that happens to them. I would burst out crying at one moment and have no feelings if something of the same nature would happen to another character. The movie does give ope though, offering change anf showing that the characters here can change and may have reasons for the way they acted.There's the businessman (Brendan Fraiser) and his hotshot, cocky wife (Sandra Bullock). There's the two criminals who like to steal cars. There's the cop (Matt Dillon) that seems to be evil and horrible but in the end, he was one of the few good people. There's his partner (Ryan Philippe) who is too good to be with a partner like Matt Dillon's character. There's the locksmith (Michael Pena) that is feared by people because he's  ""gonna sell copies of keys to his homies"". But he is in reality a kind loving and caring family man, that I was always connected to. I feared for him and felt like he was my friend. He is the best person in the movie and the way he is treated by Sandra Bullock shows the world's racism. There's the Iraqui salesman who fears for his shop and has loving and caring daughter. He also is a character that I pitied and liked. And in the end, he was another one I really liked. There's the detective (Don cheadle) who prefers sleeping with women than listening to his mother. For once, you don't really like him!And then, there's the married couple, one almost white, the other balck facing troubles. They were characters that I seriously never liked or connected with and that were other examples of the cocky rich.Buy this gem please, tell your friends the fuss is for real! Watch it as it's by far the best movie of the year and one of the best ever. It's a very dad movie showing our world the way it really is.

It's 1-1/2 stars out of four at *best.*  Like so much of Hollywood's social commentary, it says much more about the race and class ideologies of the people who made the movie than it does about the society it attempts to portray.  I'm not saying it doesn't have its moments, but the manner in which race and class issues were addressed were mostly phony, shallow and stereotyped.  At its heart, the movie is just silly, paradoxically made even sillier by its achievement as Best Picture.Also, basic plotting and storytelling is ignored.

Using unexplained coincidences to goose the plot may have been acceptable for 19th century readers, but I think 21st century audiences expect and deserve better.  When you look at how films like ""Magnolia"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" dealt with intersecting stories, you're looking at at least journeymen screenwriters, who are thoughtful enough to overcome this problem.  Not in Crash, oh no.  Just stick with the clumsy plot devices right to the end.  One cop saves the life of a woman he felt up the night before.  His partner, in a different part of town, saves the life of her husband.  The husband is carjacked by a robber whose partner is shot by the police officer he met the night before.  A cop investigates his own brother's death.

All these stories are very well packed into a 24-hour period. It is an intricate plot which is set to play in Los Angeles but can take place in any other big city. It is about racism in general and prejudice. I see this movie as a collection of events which can happen but not so close together in such a short period of time. The whole story is not something that might occur in reality, although each single event could be reality. The story is intended to show there is some good in most people. Most of the negative traits, bad behavior, wrong attitudes or malicious deeds of the different characters are mostly the result of previous bad experiences for which each single individual isn't necessarily responsible. I think the movie is pretty well made if you keep those facts in mind. Otherwise the whole thing will certainly appear way overblown. There is all over good acting. The actors have been very well chosen and fit the characters they play. Sandra Bullock as the spoiled rich housewife is just brilliant. There is some bias against guns in the plot although it is never the guns that kill it's the people. The dialogues are well written and sometimes amusing.

It's a story about the deluded, the damaged, the proud and broken pieces in all of us and how we project them on each other and interpret them when projected upon us. A powerful concept that's executed extremely well with an all-star cast and an impeccable production.The movie follows the story of several characters of different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds through the course of a couple of days. As the events unfold, paths are crossed and and at times end as lives change course and souls seek reasons that make sense of it all.The ensemble cast is superb. Matt Dillon delivered a stellar performance playing a racist cop with a soft, caring side. Ryan Phillippe was also great playing a straight, clean-cut cop that makes a bad turn down the road. Ryan's character, to me, represents the collective American psyche that absorbs tension and conflict on daily basis as a result of simple human interactions and keeps them locked inside until they fester and burst in a split second changing everything.The soundtrack is worth getting as well. ""In The Deep"" by Bird York is ever haunting and the Stereophonics' ""Maybe Tomorrow"" is just an excellent song with relevant lyrics.The movie doesn't try to answer any questions.

It really is a very well made drama, and an impressive directorial debut from Haggis, who obviously learned a lot from his collaborative work with Clint Eastwood - Crash is nearly as dark and gritty as anything the master had done. A cast of second rate Hollywood stars and B-list character actors - which includes Matt Dillon (who hadn't had a truly impressive dramatic role in more than a decade), Don Cheadle (who made his breakthrough the very same year with Hotel Rwanda), Brandon Frasier and Sandra Bullock among many others works surprisingly well together, and the film is a strong and professionally made drama with some very good dialogue and excellent atmospheric cinematography.Crash is good, but it doesn't have what it takes to be truly great, and I wouldn't take anyone calling it one of the most important films of the year very seriously. The Altman-ish mish-mash of characters whose separate stories interact in surprising ways has become overtly fashionable in Hollywood in recent years, and sometimes it seems to me like the main objective is to avoid the nuisance of developing interesting individual characters; in fact, not one character in Crash - including Cheadle's and Dillon's, both of whom give undeniably remarkable performances - is interesting enough to be considered a main character, and I found myself completely detached from all of them. The film tries to get across a message about the racial tension in America - and some of the images and stories are definitely shocking, moving and effective, but the message is ultimately vague, and it often seems like a pale and weak imitation of Spike Lee. At any rate it never at any moment manages to be half as powerful and potent as anything Spike had made.Crash is definitely a good drama that's worth your time, but it's not one of the best or most interesting films of the year. At its best it's as good as the weakest of Clint Eastwood's films - and if you've watched his films then you know that's high praise.

After watching the film and reading the reviews from Amazon reviewers, I decided to put my two cents in.  I thought the acting from all the actors and actresses were incredible.  Even from Sandra Bullock, she seems to act like an air head in most of the movies she's in, but in this movie I thought she did a pretty good job.  Now, there were some reviewers that critcize this movie here and there, but overall I'm glade that I saw this movie.  Sure, the script could have been better, but I think the director was trying to get a message across.  The message is that all of us, no matter what race, sex or age need to be more sensitive to others around us.  We need to watch what we say and what we do.  Spoiler ahead!  And, don't just jump to conclusions about things, hence towards the last part of the movie about a lock smith and the guy who blamed him for the robbery (this was my favorite part), and went to the lock smith house to kill him. This movie may not have been scripted perfectly, but I highly respect the director and producer for having the guts to put this movie out, and putting out a message that ofcourse this was nothing we have not heard or seen before, but putting out the message to just remind us to just watch how we treat one another.

We are about to be introduced to many people in the city who are strangers now, but their lives are about to intertwine within the next 24 hours.  As we follow one person to the next in Los Angeles, each life touches another.Jean (Sandra Bullock) and Rick (Brendan Fraser) are walking down the sidewalk having a disagreement.  She sees two black guys up ahead.  The black guys talking amoung themselves about the white couple decide to car-jack them with their guns.  They steal the car, but left Jean and Rick uninjured.  What they do not know is that Rick is the District Attorney.Back at home, Jean is furious.  She disapproves of the hispanic locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena) because of his looks and tattos.  She thinks he belongs to a gang and might sell the keys to his gang friends.  Not true!  Daniel is not part of a gang.  He has a daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez) and a wife (Karina Arroyave) at home. Officer Ryan (Matt Dillion) on patrol catches a black couple, Cameron (Terence Howard) and Christine (Thandie Newton) in a sexual act while driving.  He pulls them over and frisks the woman throughly for knives and a gun.  Christine did not like the cop body searching her in the private area.

The film is an attempt to make us all, especially us White people, feel guilty about how racist and bigoted we are.One example of such bigotry shown in the film is the making fun of how Chinese speak English.

Contrived plots, mediocre acting, stale writing and poor directing seems to be the norm.Yet, Crash suffers none of these artistic or technical ills.I was a bit leery of seeing so many big names together. Many times these ensemble casts equal a very ""Hollywood-y"" movie.Not so for Crash.Brendan Fraser and Matt Dillon, two actors I'm not very big on, were supberb in this film. Don Cheadle, while not giving a performance on par with Hotel Rwanda, was convincing. Sandra Bullock, another actress I'm not a a big fan of, was excellent as the uptight, angry socialite who is, esentially, friendless. Thandie Newton was utterly convincing as was the actor her played her husband.The actor that really stood out to me, however, was Michael Pena. Pena played Armando ""Army"" Renta in FX's The Shield--sidekick to officer Shane Vendrell. In Crash, Pena plays a locksmith. The storyline about this hardworking locksmith--which includes moving his wife and daughter to a safer neighborhood, encountering racism from a Persian store owner, and endowing his daughter with a magic, invisible ""impenetrable fairy cape"" was utterly gut wrenching.Of course, most of the stories in this movie evoked strong emotions in me. I even recognized *gasp* some racist attitudes that I, myself, unknowingly harbored. I was horrified at how we treat our fellow humans. Yet, most of us do the best we can--and no individual is 100% good or 100% bad. We're a mixture.And Crash brilliantly portrays the mixture that we are. Matt Dillon's chracter (a member of LAPD) goes from groping a black woman during a pull over, to attempting to save her life in a car crash, to standing over his cantankerous father while he's sitting on the pot--in major pain over some undiagnosed prostrate ailment (that the HMO won't grant coverage for in terms of seeing a specialist to help him).Crash is about racism, about choices, and about consquences.

Crash is a film about lives in the balance, another LA montage (Short Cuts, Magnolia) but probably the best so far. It weaves together its separate strands and disparate characters into a frighteningly beautiful patchwork, a fully grown up film about conflicted people and people in conflict. The subtext of Crash is intercity racial tension, but this never becomes a theme, rather it seems an inevitable and natural backdrop to the story, or indeed to any story set in a contemporary American city, and most especially in LA. A white racist cop who is also a loving son turns out to be a genuine hero. A good, non-prejudiced rookie cop winds up committing a murder. A young back hood railing against ""[...]"" stereotyping ends up becoming one himself. An angry young professional woman struggling to separate prejudice from common sense in stereotyping criminal types by their race and appearance winds up all alone with her anger. A pathological, revenge-driven Persian shop owner, sick and tired of being harassed and type-cast as an Arab, begins acting like a terrorist.Crash offers up a dozen or so such characters wrestling with their identity and placement inside the melting pot of America as it nears boiling point. Paul Haggis' film doesn't reduce questions of racial prejudice to mere ideology or political incorrectness, however, which in the world of movies-by-numbers is something of a miracle. Instead he allows prejudice simply to exist, without judging it, an integral part of the life of his characters and the substance of their world. If everyone is racist, he seems to say, then no one is. Prejudice is inevitable when different races are forced to live together without any real means of interrelation. It's human instinct to distrust what is different from ourselves, after all, and the film isn't afraid to show how sometimes prejudice can even be justified (though it also makes it clear that most of the time it isn't). The biggest problem, Haggis may be suggesting, is when these natural feelings of suspicion or hostility towards others are denied verbal or emotional expression, and so can fester and grow until they come out in acts. Hence, ""crash.""In Crash, the cracker cop (Matt Dillon) seems utterly irredeemable in his first scene, yet by the end of the movie he has become one of the most sympathetic characters in a film filled with sympathetic characters (even the deranged Arab, uh, Persian, invokes pity). Of course, sympathetic doesn't necessarily mean likeable, although Hollywood movies never seem to acknowledge that there is a difference, and that audiences don't have to admire or envy a character in order to relate to him. Haggis doesn't let us judge the Dillon character, for example, by his beliefs. He forces us to stay with him and witness his many other sides. The same woman he humiliates, the cracker cop later rescues from a horrible death. Haggis is intent on showing that people are complex beings, and infinitely greater than the sum of their beliefs, prejudices, and actions.Crash is one of the very few truly adult movies to come out of Hollywood so far this millennium. Its characters are observed not through the narrow crack of Hollywood's conceit, but from the full 360 degrees of a creative imagination. They aren't just given token shadings, these people are nothing but shadings. Haggis never makes the mistake of letting us think we know these people (or that he does), and he never allows us to judge them based on what little we see of them, since every new thing we see contradicts whatever we've seen before. The film seems consciously designed to this end, to remind us of the futility of judging others before all the evidence is in, and of the fact that it never really is. Without a full picture of ""the facts,"" any judgment at all is simply prejudice. Or, as Jimmy Stewart counseled Katherine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story:""The time to make up your mind about people is never.""",4,Beautiful Patchwork,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,4296,"['idea', 'urban', 'violence', 'simply', 'way', 'alienated', 'city', 'folk', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', 'other', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'original', 'thoughts', 'floating', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Crash', 'distinguished', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Crash', 'movie', 'filled', 'original', 'thoughts', 'making', 'doubly', 'regrettable', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'original', 'title', 'Crash', 'film', 'lives', 'balance', 'LA', 'montage', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'Magnolia', 'probably', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'together', 'separate', 'strands', 'disparate', 'characters', 'frighteningly', 'beautiful', 'patchwork', 'fully', 'grown', 'up', 'film', 'conflicted', 'people', 'people', 'conflict', 'subtext', 'Crash', 'intercity', 'racial', 'tension', 'never', 'theme', 'rather', 'inevitable', 'natural', 'backdrop', 'story', 'indeed', 'story', 'set', 'contemporary', 'American', 'city', 'most', 'especially', 'LA', 'A', 'white', 'racist', 'cop', 'who', 'also', 'loving', 'son', 'out', 'be', 'genuine', 'hero', 'good', 'non-prejudiced', 'rookie', 'cop', 'up', 'committing', 'murder', 'young', 'back', 'hood', 'railing', '[', ']', 'stereotyping', 'up', 'becoming', 'one', 'angry', 'young', 'professional', 'woman', 'struggling', 'separate', 'prejudice', 'common', 'sense', 'stereotyping', 'criminal', 'types', 'race', 'appearance', 'winds', 'up', 'alone', 'anger', 'pathological', 'revenge-driven', 'Persian', 'shop', 'owner', 'sick', 'tired', 'being', 'harassed', 'type-cast', 'Arab', 'acting', 'terrorist.Crash', 'up', 'dozen', 'so', 'such', 'characters', 'wrestling', 'identity', 'placement', 'melting', 'pot', 'America', 'boiling', 'point', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'film', ""n't"", 'reduce', 'questions', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'mere', 'ideology', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'however', 'world', 'movies-by-numbers', 'something', 'miracle', 'Instead', 'prejudice', 'simply', 'exist', 'judging', 'integral', 'part', 'life', 'characters', 'substance', 'world', 'everyone', 'racist', 'say', 'then', 'one', 'Prejudice', 'inevitable', 'when', 'different', 'races', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'together', 'real', 'means', 'interrelation', 'human', 'instinct', 'distrust', 'what', 'different', 'ourselves', 'film', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'how', 'sometimes', 'prejudice', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'justified', 'also', 'clear', 'most', 'time', ""n't"", 'biggest', 'problem', 'Haggis', 'may', 'be', 'suggesting', 'when', 'natural', 'feelings', 'suspicion', 'hostility', 'others', 'are', 'denied', 'verbal', 'emotional', 'expression', 'so', 'can', 'fester', 'grow', 'come', 'out', 'acts', 'Hence', 'crash', 'Crash', 'cracker', 'cop', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'utterly', 'irredeemable', 'first', 'scene', 'yet', 'end', 'movie', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'film', 'filled', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'even', 'deranged', 'Arab', 'uh', 'Persian', 'invokes', 'pity', 'course', 'sympathetic', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'likeable', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'never', 'seem', 'acknowledge', 'difference', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'admire', 'envy', 'character', 'order', 'relate', 'Haggis', ""n't"", 'let', 'judge', 'Dillon', 'character', 'example', 'beliefs', 'stay', 'witness', 'many', 'other', 'sides', 'same', 'woman', 'cracker', 'cop', 'later', 'horrible', 'death', 'Haggis', 'intent', 'showing', 'people', 'are', 'complex', 'beings', 'infinitely', 'greater', 'sum', 'beliefs', 'prejudices', 'actions.Crash', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'truly', 'adult', 'movies', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'far', 'millennium', 'characters', 'are', 'observed', 'not', 'narrow', 'crack', 'Hollywood', 'conceit', 'full', '360', 'degrees', 'creative', 'imagination', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'given', 'token', 'shadings', 'people', 'are', 'nothing', 'shadings', 'Haggis', 'never', 'mistake', 'letting', 'think', 'know', 'people', 'never', 'judge', 'based', 'what', 'little', 'see', 'new', 'thing', 'see', 'contradicts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'consciously', 'designed', 'end', 'remind', 'futility', 'judging', 'others', 'evidence', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'full', 'picture', 'facts', 'judgment', 'simply', 'prejudice', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'counseled', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'time', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'people', 'never']",Crash

The story begins with a touching philosophical summery of modern life in a large metropolis of America. Don Cheadle, in what is likely to become a classic role for him, gives a most inspiring performance as a Los Angeles policeman in search of meaning. In his role as an investigative officer , he searches for the murderer of his brother and a victim of a gunshot shooting. While he makes his rounds of the city, he attempts to hold his family together while all around him, other people are struggling with theirs. Each life is laced with personal stereotypical barriers which prompts others to collide with them. Each suffers through their own brand of racial bigotry and in turn allows the viewer to see themselves in this fascinating mirror of life. This is drama at it's best.  Memorable performances from Matt Ryan, Billy Gallo, and Ryan Phillippe as Hanson, highlight this amazing collection of stories.

The emotional punch this delivers reminds me and restores me faith in thinking that movies like this can still be made. The performances are flawless, (even Sandra Bullock, who I generally can't stand) the plot weaves in and out perfectly and the soundtrack is devastating.Racism is a scary thing, and this movie amazingly gives you all the myths, hype, violence, and stereo-types we've all come to hear about these days.

The story begins and ends on a desolate road after a nighttime car crash. Don Cheadle and his Hispanic partner/lover (Jennifer Esposito) start the film by recovering from a rear-end collision involving an Asian character who is not seen again until 3/4 of the way through the film. The film backtracks several days, then follows Cheadle and a half-dozen other characters until they come full circle to the same roadside, and an unexpected discovery.Artistic styling aside, the film scrapes away the layers of politeness that usually veil racist and ethnic suspicions. A white liberal yuppie DA and his wife (Brendan Fasier and a self-controlled Sandra Bullock) deal with a crime by freaking out at the young Hispanic man who comes to change the locks. An Iranian shopkeeper is certain that his is being cheated, and arms himself against perceived enemies. A bigoted LAPD cop (fabulous Matt Dillon) may be a black women's best friend when trouble strikes. A couple of blacks walking through a white shopping district complain bitterly about stereotyping, all the while planning a heist. Irony (sometimes rather obvious) abounds, as members of oppressed races spout the most vile, ignorant and bigoted claims about each other, and about themselves.Director Paul Haggis sees his film as a way to deal with racism by exposing it to the open air.

First off let me explain to anyone who has not seen this movie that there are some good actors in this film with good performances... for such a lousy script, many times they made something out of complete non scenes. So it has that going for it, and that's where it stops.  the plot is completely ridiculous, that people would run into one another at just the right time in a city the size of LA...come on. Ok, I'll suspend disbelief and let that one go, then there is the script, ouch!  The dialog was so heavy handed it was like it was written by someone who once read a book about racism and never really encountered real people of different races and how they reacted to them in real social situations.  There were moments in this film where i audibly cried out, ""are you kidding me?"" No one talks like this or about this stuff in this manner, it just doesn't happen.  Real people don't act like this, fake Hollywood snobs might but not working America..  This movie was trying to be profound and say something about racism in America and all it said to me was the writer needs to get off his laptop and experience real people and not just the coked out, privileged, white, Hollywood elite he's been rubbing elbows with. This was like a 2 hour PSA.  I believe, a decade from now, no one will be looking back at this as a great Oscar winner, it will go as unmentioned as Marisa Tome's Oscar for my cousin Vinnie.  I found this film to not only be  poorly written and directed but found it quite insulting to me.  Racism is never talked about like this, it's swept under the rug, or joked about or talked about it a serious way when ""those people"" aren't around.  I'm not an expert on race relations and not a perfect soul who doesn't have my own little biases and prejudices about other races.

920528,A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,B000A3XY5A,Jeff Pearlman,"[4, 13]","I finally saw this last night and am still awestruck from the experience.  It was amazing!  Some dazed throwaway dialogue from Don Cheadle's character in the first scene is meant to guide us:  this isn't so much (at all?) about a car crash as it is about the way people's lives, and attitudes, crash into each other and set other things in motion.I will try to keep anything ""spoiler"" in nature towards the end.  The movie's title also refers to the way it ""crashes"" your initial expectations about the characters.  If you're reading this you know by now of the horrible, racist thing Matt Dillon does to an upscale black couple in an early scene.  But he's later humanized as you see him suffering all night with...of all things...a constipated father.  He's still a jackass as he insults HMO manager Loretta Devine, but it's more than that.  In his eyes, his dad's life and business were ruined by affirmative action, and the results literally keep him up nights.  And then he risks his life to save the same lady he humiliated the night before.  Manipulative in hindsight but in the context of the movie it's perfect.Admittedly I was watching between midnight and two after working way later than I planned, but I was crying at the result of the vandalized store clerk's attack on the tattooed guy and his sweet little girl.  SPOILER ALERT--and when we saw that the ""red box"" of bullets the clerk's savvy daughter bought for him were blanks!  Notice I didn't say whether I was crying with sorrow or joy at the attack!  (And later, during the credits when I saw lovely Marina Sirtis' name, I cried with joy.  I had to skip around to find she was the clerk's wife.)More irony in the way we were led to believe there'd be a car crash involving everybody only to see this is about people's lives crashing into and affecting each other:  how about what happens to Ryan Phillipe's character?  We all wanted him to DO SOMETHING to stop that icky Matt Dillon feel-up scene, then felt his frustration when his black supervisor blocked him from turning Dillon in, cheered at his heroic save of...a character I won't specify...who happened to be armed...from trigger-happy cops, then felt shock and dismay when he overreacted and did something awful and irrevocable in his last scene.In trying not to spoil the plot, that last paragraph necessarily glosses over the interest of many analysts whose concern will ultimately decide whether ""Crash"" is to be an all-time classic or a relative failure that dangerously mishandles the vital topics of racism and race relations.  In other words, are the interests of minorities properly addressed?  Is any group being made to look too blameworthy for the way things are?  I felt properly uncomfortable at the way people were treating each other in the first third of this movie.  We were all supposed to.  The makers set scenes up that showed several people in their worst light.  The pig of a gun salesman is an obvious choice, but don't overlook Sandra Bullock's spoiled rich WASP character.  She launches into an ugly racist rant when her emotions were raw.  But at the end, what is she doing?  Finding her ""best friend"" of ten years was (like her) too self absorbed to help her and realizing her long-suffering Hispanic housemaid who came through for her--again--was her real best friend.  Brilliant.I'm afraid some may be right in concluding that the couple tormented by the Dillon character fail to overcome their status as victims.  This despite (or because of) Terrence Howard's actions in a later car scene, because those he stands up to successfully are also black, and he is clearly not at his best (reduced to bare, cornered emotion) when confronted by more white people (again being sensitive to spoiling anything).  However, the dialogue between Howard and his wife (is it obvious I don't know who plays her though she's great?) is, in my view, excellent and deftly addresses how Dillon's actions especially burn the psyche because of their color.Back to the entertainment value now:  How about Ludacris cutting down the hip-hop industry in a ""Royale With Cheese"" tribute exchange with the guy who played Cheadle's brother?  Classic!  And the surprise turn of events between him and the ""Chinaman"" he creams early on?  Minor SPOILER alert:  turns out he Chinese man was doing something truly despicable, and Ludacris, stunningly shamed a bit earlier (""you embarrass me.  You embarrass yourself.""), actually does a heroic thing.I could go on and on.  And I have.  Frivolous notes:  Didja catch the alien husband from ""Invasion"" in the scene with Don Cheadle in the middle?  And 2 seconds of Jin from ""Lost""?  And...Tony Danza?  How'd HE get in there?  It's like a Robert Altman movie.  Or ""It's a Mad Mad Mad World"" with racist overtones.  Now to copy this for the ""Full Screen"" edition...need those helpful votes...I hope this helped anyone reading this enjoy the movie without spoiling any of the surprise bits.",5,Well-deserving of the

Since there are so many interweaving story lines and since no one gets along, the movie is hard to watch. This is not all bad. Shakespeare tragedies are hard to watch, but can be enjoyed at an artistic level. The movie is good in some respects, but it does not really resolve anything. It sets up stereotypical characters and then tries to puncture our views about them. The trouble is at the end you don't care about any of the characters. I'm not sure why I dislike the movie. I guess I feel the movie tries to manipulate me to be more understanding rather than help me to be more understanding.The good points are the acting and the sets. The plot, although it has many story lines, is pretty simplistic and the surprises are telegraphed by the music and the simplistic writing. The white guy who gets his car stolen is a District Attorney. His wife is a bigot. Who would have known? When people are stressed, they exhibit more bigoted behavior. Wow. I never knew that. Jerks can be heros too in a different situation. Surprise? Nice guys can make stupid decisions in other situations. No one gets along in this movie and they all most likely will make stupid decisions.

920531,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000A3XY5A,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[1, 8]","The subject of racism is a touchy one. Many people don't like to delve in for fear of being labeled or accused. In Crash, the subject is taken on by writer/director Paul Haggis with daring and relentless ambition.Crash is one of those movies where several stories are taking place in once city and tend to intertwine with one another. As the film opens we see two young black men complaining about how a woman walks closer to her husband because she saw the two of them walking toward them. What they do next is complete 180 on what you would expect and sets the tone for the entire movie.  After complaining about being seen as stereotypical racial criminals, they carjack the couple of their Lincoln SUV.It may not seem like the stereotypes are gone, but they are used as a set up for all the twists and turns that make this movie a slalom of racial archetypes and expectations, only to be turned on their head once established. You might think Haggis' intention is to show you that racism is out there and it's wrong, but beyond that he shows that it exists on all sides of the social structures. He also shows third dimensions to the characters, giving them reasons for their actions, whether justifiable or not, and makes sure you see sides of the characters that contradict with the stereotypes.You've never seen these actors plays parts like this. Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock stand out as the most shocking, reflecting rich white elitists who have different reactions to being carjacked. Don Cheadle gives a great performance playing well off Jennifer Espisito as their affair turns nasty in a very intimate scene. All the other actors turn in great performances as well; Terrance Howard, Matt Dillion, Thandie Newton, Ludacris and Ryan Phillippe are all in great form, but not all of them have remarkably substantial parts. Everyone seemed to want to be in this movie for it's message, and that is the star of the film.You can get a lot of different things out of this film, it has many messages, some will be relevant to you but not to others. It is a hard look at racism on all levels and not just at the street level.  It points out the flaws of humanity in a city that is racially and socially distraught.  This movie makes you think, whether you thinks it's really good not.  I thought it was excellent because I believe we need to look inward as much as outward when it comes to eliminating racism.",5,More than expected,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,2418,"['subject', 'racism', 'touchy', 'one', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'delve', 'fear', 'being', 'labeled', 'accused', 'Crash', 'subject', 'taken', 'writer/director', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'daring', 'relentless', 'ambition.Crash', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'several', 'stories', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'once', 'city', 'tend', 'intertwine', 'one', 'film', 'see', 'two', 'young', 'black', 'men', 'complaining', 'how', 'woman', 'closer', 'husband', 'saw', 'two', 'walking', 'What', 'do', 'next', 'complete', '180', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'sets', 'tone', 'entire', 'movie', 'complaining', 'being', 'seen', 'stereotypical', 'racial', 'criminals', 'carjack', 'couple', 'Lincoln', 'SUV.It', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'gone', 'are', 'used', 'set', 'up', 'twists', 'make', 'movie', 'slalom', 'racial', 'archetypes', 'expectations', 'only', 'be', 'turned', 'head', 'once', 'established', 'might', 'think', 'Haggis', 'intention', 'show', 'racism', 'there', 'wrong', 'sides', 'social', 'structures', 'also', 'third', 'dimensions', 'characters', 'giving', 'reasons', 'actions', 'justifiable', 'not', 'sure', 'see', 'sides', 'characters', 'contradict', 'stereotypes.You', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actors', 'plays', 'parts', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'shocking', 'reflecting', 'rich', 'white', 'elitists', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'reactions', 'being', 'carjacked', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'great', 'performance', 'playing', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Espisito', 'affair', 'nasty', 'very', 'intimate', 'scene', 'other', 'actors', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'Matt', 'Dillion', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Ludacris', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'are', 'great', 'form', 'not', 'have', 'remarkably', 'substantial', 'parts', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'want', 'be', 'movie', 'message', 'star', 'film.You', 'can', 'get', 'lot', 'different', 'things', 'film', 'many', 'messages', 'will', 'be', 'relevant', 'not', 'others', 'hard', 'look', 'racism', 'levels', 'not', 'just', 'street', 'level', 'out', 'flaws', 'humanity', 'city', 'racially', 'socially', 'distraught', 'movie', 'think', 'thinks', 'really', 'good', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'believe', 'need', 'look', 'inward', 'as', 'much', 'outward', 'when', 'eliminating', 'racism']",Crash
920532,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000A3XY5A,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[0, 2]","""Crash"" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.Almost all cast members share equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), , Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Pe&ntilde;a (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls -- alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care -- to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breathe the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life.There are times early in the film that one thinks it will degenerate into a racially charged statement, but it never loses course. The roles both large and small seem more than sketches after awhile. You care about what happens to all of them, even the more criminal elements because they are real people. The film plays like a mosaic or puzzle of fragments and pieces that slowly but satisfyingly come together. Although there are more than a couple of coincidental events and incidents including car accidents that link many of the characters, the improbable happenings are easy to forgive since we are in the hands of a good storyteller. These chance encounters serve as a catalyst or storytelling device to propel the story further. This, above all things, is ""Crash""s achievement as cinema. It is a learning experience to say the least, and a haunting piece of work that will stay with you.",5,Truly amazing movie!!!,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2214,"['Crash', 'complex', 'movie', 'simple', 'premise', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', '8', 'main', 'characters', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'supporting', 'walks', 'life', 'races', 'lives', 'intersect', 'point', 'one', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'yet', 'alienated', 'point', 'breaking', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'come', 'together', 'things', 'explode.Almost', 'cast', 'members', 'share', 'equal', 'amounts', 'screen', 'time', 'folks', 'who', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'had', 'full', 'attention', 'time', 'were', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'TV', 'director', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'patrol', 'cop', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'rich', 'housewife', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'detective', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'locksmith', 'five', 'gave', 'deeply', 'deeply', 'felt', 'performances', 'portraying', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'personal', 'situations', 'giving', 'souls', 'alone', 'yearning', 'searching', 'world', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'shells', 'imperfect', 'people', 'actors', 'triumph', 'little', 'moments', 'human', 'contact', 'glance', 'embrace', 'pause', 'smile', 'wince', 'things', 'breathe', 'film', 'life', 'simple', 'visuals', 'give', 'profundity', 'beautifully', 'illustrated', 'small', 'scene', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'Jean', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'maid', 'begun', 'realize', 'problems', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'two', 'black', 'guys', 'who', 'car', 'jacked', 'own', 'life.There', 'are', 'times', 'early', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'degenerate', 'racially', 'charged', 'statement', 'never', 'course', 'roles', 'large', 'small', 'seem', 'more', 'sketches', 'awhile', 'care', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'criminal', 'elements', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'film', 'plays', 'mosaic', 'puzzle', 'fragments', 'pieces', 'slowly', 'satisfyingly', 'come', 'together', 'are', 'more', 'couple', 'coincidental', 'events', 'incidents', 'including', 'car', 'accidents', 'link', 'many', 'characters', 'improbable', 'happenings', 'are', 'easy', 'forgive', 'are', 'hands', 'good', 'storyteller', 'chance', 'encounters', 'serve', 'catalyst', 'storytelling', 'device', 'propel', 'story', 'further', 'things', 'Crash', 's', 'achievement', 'cinema', 'learning', 'experience', 'say', 'least', 'haunting', 'piece', 'work', 'will', 'stay']",Crash

I didn't read all the other reviews, so I don't know if what I say has been covered, but here's my 2 cents...After many people recommended that I see this film, I finally broke down and rented it.  I can honestly say that it in no way moved me or affected my outlook on life like so many people said it would.  It left me asking why this film is so hyped and lauded.The theme of the story is constantly rammed down your throat and played out by characters who are complete and extreme stereo-types of their races.  Matt Dillon and Sandra Bullock's characters are laughingly predictable, as are Ludacris and Larenz Tate.  The only thing I found touching about the film was the relationship of the locksmith and his daughter, which took all of 10 minutes of the movie.  The other characters were so unredeming and abrasive that I didn't care what happened to them.The end of the story brings hardly any change in the characters, and those that do are not based in reality.  For those who have seen it, look to Sandra Bullock's character as reference.  Keep in mind, this is suppose to be a day in the life of these people.So what do you take away from this film?  'That we are all racists.'  How profound.If you want to see a good film about racism with well thought-out characters that you actually feel for, rent 'American History X'.

Although  I liked Crash, I have to disagree. There's a lot of other films that made me say ""wow, I'm watching the best movie of the year"". Hell I got that vibe while watching Walk the Line, not Crash. Crash basically just shows people showing their bad sides and then has them showing their good sides. I guess it's point is that  if people showed their good sides more then their bad, the world would be a better place.It has a great cast with Matt Dillion giving a great performance as a cop who takes out his problems with his sick dad on black people. Although he's excellent, I didn't really see the oscar potential there. I would've rather have seen Mickey Rourke get a deserved nomination for Sin City instead. Just like with everyone else in the film, we see his bad side and then his good side. The film basically just does that with every character. The scenes I think that work  the most is the spanish locksmiths' scenes with his daughter. He's a good guy always showing that he's a good guy and his last scene with his daughter is bound to make you cry. It's the most moving thing the film has going for it. Other than that I think the 1992 film Grand Canyon is a better film about prejudice and how the world would be better if we got along. Yet I don't think that was nominated for anything.... I don't really see how it will be remembered more than Brokeback Mountain like Ebert said either. Crash doesn't make as much of an impact on you as Ebert acts like it does. Everyone knows there's problems in the world without seeing this movie. While Brokeback Mountain could make people think ""hey to each his own, if they wanna be together, why not ?"" lol.

However, it's preachy about morals which are probably self-evident to most, but could be a revelation to some. Character development is strong enough that the director could make separate movies about the characters for more depth, which is something you might want--more depth. There are some certified tear-jerker scenes; however, it's not a masterpiece, because the Hollywood-style message about race and morality (which sets the bar for morality pretty low) kept intruding on 5 or more good stories. Some reviewers have complained the characters, ironically, have themselves been painted with a stereotypical brush. And, I have to admit the portrayal of Asians was as subtle as a sledgehammer hit to the groin. Also, there are absurd moments, like when actor LudiCris frees Cambodian slaves rather then sell them. LudiCris smiles to himself, knowing he's done the right thing. Well, 'atta boy! This scene is simply--yes, I am going there--ludicrous. Like I said, the morality bar is just inches off the ground. Also, the scene where Sandra Bullock declares that her maid is her best friend reduces her character to the lowest levels of patheticism, because her paid employee--who can not flee her for financial reasons--accomodates pretty much all her fickle wishes, even that of being her best friend.I wanted to like this movie much more than I did, but the message of racism was watered down and not that original. In comparison, the movie, ""New Jack City"" punched harder at a gut level with less obvious ""serious"" preaching and got a much stronger point across, and yet it still cleverly came off as a wild action movie, not a studied elite cultural statement. Crash is just another example of message overwhelming otherwise good art, because the director didn't trust the audience to get it.

Packs an emotional punch (if you put your brain on hold), as the director touches a bunch of melodramatic buttons.  It's amazingly race-obsessed.  The theme is, I guess, some cliche like ""Can't we all just get along?""  or ""I'd like to see the world at one, in perfect harmony...""  After we get over our nasty prejudices, let's all just love each other and sing Kumbaya.It has two themes that it hits over and over:  race (good & bad blacks, good & bad whites, hispanics, Iranians), and police.  Every other actor is a policeman or a DA.  They all have conflicts with each other, then they all end up loving one another's humanity.  A bit too thick with the syrupy ""COEXIST"" message.I really can't see how it won an Oscar, except maybe that the field was weak that year (2006).  It's way too contrived.  Example: the racist, abusive cop feels up an upper-class black woman in a traffic stop and humiliates her and her husband.  Then he later saves her life in a traffic accident.  OK.... Her husband then is car-jacked by two (way too nice) armed black thugs, but he gets away and disarms them by himself (Yeah, right) .... then the racist cop's nice-guy partner saves HIM from a potentially fatal police shooting by other white cops. Sure!The film seems obsessed with black men who have become educated and successful, dealing with their conflicts in ""losing their blackness"" or ""becoming too white.""  It also seems sometimes to be copying Pulp Fiction in showing some of the seemy side of LA, the thugs talking philosophy in the car, etc.Not to say that there aren't good scenes.  Like the very first scene where the two thuggish-looking young black guys come out of a coffee shop in a toney white area, complaining that everyone is avoiding them and giving them attitude.  Then, when they come across a well-dressed white couple, they immediately pull out guns and carjack them!But in general it's a contrived, awkward, second-tier script with a star-studded cast (Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, etc).",3,"Quirky, contrived story obsessed with race.",1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2086,"['Crash', 'quirky', 'very', 'contrived', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'fans', 'Packs', 'emotional', 'punch', 'put', 'brain', 'hold', 'director', 'bunch', 'melodramatic', 'buttons', 'amazingly', 'race-obsessed', 'theme', 'guess', 'cliche', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'along', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'world', 'one', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'get', 'nasty', 'prejudices', 'let', 'just', 'love', 'other', 'sing', 'Kumbaya.It', 'two', 'themes', 'race', 'good', 'bad', 'blacks', 'good', 'bad', 'whites', 'hispanics', 'Iranians', 'police', 'other', 'actor', 'policeman', 'DA', 'have', 'conflicts', 'other', 'then', 'end', 'up', 'loving', 'one', 'humanity', 'bit', 'too', 'thick', 'syrupy', 'COEXIST', 'message.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'won', 'Oscar', 'maybe', 'field', 'was', 'weak', 'year', '2006', 'way', 'too', 'contrived', 'Example', 'racist', 'abusive', 'cop', 'up', 'upper-class', 'black', 'woman', 'traffic', 'stop', 'husband', 'Then', 'later', 'life', 'traffic', 'accident', 'husband', 'then', 'car-jacked', 'two', 'way', 'too', 'nice', 'armed', 'black', 'thugs', 'away', 'disarms', 'Yeah', 'right', 'then', 'racist', 'cop', 'nice-guy', 'partner', 'HIM', 'potentially', 'fatal', 'police', 'shooting', 'other', 'white', 'cops', 'Sure', 'film', 'obsessed', 'black', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'educated', 'successful', 'dealing', 'conflicts', 'losing', 'blackness', 'becoming', 'too', 'white', 'also', 'sometimes', 'be', 'copying', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'showing', 'seemy', 'side', 'LA', 'thugs', 'talking', 'philosophy', 'car', 'etc.Not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'scenes', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'thuggish-looking', 'young', 'black', 'guys', 'come', 'coffee', 'shop', 'toney', 'white', 'area', 'complaining', 'everyone', 'avoiding', 'giving', 'attitude', 'Then', 'when', 'come', 'well-dressed', 'white', 'couple', 'immediately', 'pull', 'out', 'guns', 'carjack', 'general', 'contrived', 'awkward', 'second-tier', 'script', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'etc']",Crash

920560,AZ5WK99NSFNRV,B000A3XY5A,"Justin Maldonado ""JM""","[1, 1]","Crash is a bold, brave, and moving experience about people of different backgrounds-white, black, Latin, Asian, and middle eastern-and the ripple effects of their encounters with each other. Million Dollar Baby writer Paul Haggis steps up to direct this buffet of fear, hatred, anger, revelations, and stereotypes, and, surprisingly, he never ends up doing what his title suggests.Haggis could have easily made this a sermon, preaching to us how we should all look past the skin and see what's within-typical mumbo jumbo we have all seen and heard before. But what he does is riskier. He sets up his characters-who they are, what they're going through, what ""type"" they fall under-and allows their stories to tell themselves, interconnecting much smoothly than could be anticipated.There's the rich white couple (Brendan Frasier and Sandra Bullock) in which the wife, after being carjacked by some thieves (Ludacris and Lorenz Tate), becomes increasingly paranoid about anyone without her shade of color and their motives. The thieves are actually young black men, dressed as UCLA students, who have conversations about white and black relations that are quite insightful, such as when the Ludacris character explains why he would never ride a bus, or why he despises rap music.There's also a detective (Don Cheadle) who is sleeping with his Latina partner (Jennifer Esposito). She gets upset when he calls her Mexican. He asks her how her people all learned how to park on other peoples' lawns. There is also a stubborn Persian store owner who is mistaken for being an Arab, a Latino locksmith who is just trying to raise his daughter, a racist cop and his rookie partner, a black TV director and his light-skinned wife who may be considered as ""acting white,"" an Asian man who is involved in ""transportation,"" and other minor characters that add depth to the film.Haggis puts his heart in this film, and tries to wrench the viewer's. Some aspects of the film feel typical, certain situations feel forced, some emotions manipulated. We all know the characters will have revelations, a character or two will die, and people will be changed for the better. Or maybe not. But what's so interesting about the film is how those elements unfold before us, and they are easy to take thanks most in part to the terrific ensemble.Everybody hits the right note, but the real standouts here are Matt Dillon as the racist, and Terrance Howard as the TV director. At first glance, Dillon is your typical white racist L.A. cop, but as his story evolves we learn of his reasons for his anger, due mostly in part to his sick father. Howard just shines as a man who must live with his decision to stand back as the cop molests his wife during an unnecessary pull over. That choice of his haunts him throughout the rest of the movie.Haggis has done here what many filmmakers are afraid to do-expose the reality of a multicultural society, and the domino effects of individuals' choices concerning race. The film is brutally honest, even to the point of biting humor that will have you laugh out loud, and then think about what you just heard.Crash isn't exactly a masterpiece, but it is a powerful, smart, and, most of all, bold deliverance of all our thoughts and fears of people of different races, and how in our day and age we should step back and take a look at ourselves before we judge others. You won't leave the theatre a completely changed person, but maybe you'll think twice about another race's perspective on situations.

In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""These are the first lines spoken by Police Detective, Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) in Paul Haggis' Academy Award winning film, ""Crash"". In the film we watch how in a 36 hour period (mostly in the night), Detective Waters and more than a dozen diverse characters of different race, culture and economic class cross paths and both literally and emotionally 'Crash' into each other.Director-Writer, Paul Haggis' film examines the complexity of racial relations. The emotionally moving script provides no real answers to our problems of racism. Instead it holds up a mirror and looks at the people involved. There are no 'good guys' or 'bad guys'. No, white or black hats are worn. None of these characters turn out to be as they initally seem. All of them eventually are put into emotionally dramatic situations, where either they find some good in themselves or they are forced to confront darker parts of their personalities, that they are loathed to admit exist. As Matt Dillon's openly racist LAPD cop tells his rookie partner, ""You think you know who you are? You have no ideal"". That one line pretty much sums up what ""Crash"" is about.""Crash"" won the 2006 Acadamy Award for ""Best Motion of the Year"" and for once the Academy got it right. Haggis provides amazing direction and a wonderful script featuring well rounded, interesting characters. The entire ensemble cast is brilliant. Standouts include Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, Ludacris, Michael Pena and Shaun Toub. I'm moved by their performances every time I see this film.Finally, I want to mention two technical aspects of the film. James Muro's beautiful cinematography, really makes the City of L.A. come alive seeming both inviting and dangerous. This is such a beautiful movie to watch. Also, I absolutely love Mark Isham's amazing musical score, which so inhances the emotional mood of the film. This is punctuated by the beautiful ending song ""In the Deep"" (written & sung by Bird York) which I absolutely love. This film has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent years.I would highly recommend the two DVD disc, ""Directors Cut"" of this film. This DVD set features several excellent documentaries on the making of the movie plus deleted scenes, music videos and script & story board comparisons. Best of all is the well informed commentary track from Writer/Director, Paul Haggis and Actor/Producer, Don Cheadle. They talk in detail about the making of the film and its themes and storylines.This is a wonderful film drama. I've seen it a number of times and always find myself emotionally moved by it.

920565,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000A3XY5A,Kevin Killian,"[2, 4]","I remember being at an Oscars party here in San Francisco the year this movie won the Academy Award, and the shout of dismay that went through the room when ""we"" were cheated out of an Oscar for Brokeback Mountain.  One fellow explained to me that the Oscars were voted on by a bunch of wealthy white people in Beverly Hills who were scared out of their minds by the prospect of being carjacked by blacks with guns.  And that's why CRASH won, out of a superstitious dread reckoning.  Then why didn't BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES win, fool--asked I--instead it's been universally reviled as one of the worst movies of all time.They had plenty of answers to that one, but on the whole I was satisfied with the explanation fed me.  But finally I got to see CRASH on DVD and I was pleasantly shocked to find myself enjoying every moment!  OK, so it was pretty preposterous, and OK, maybe white people like William Fichtner don't unleash their racial prejudices on black men like Don Cheadle every day of their working lives.  I found CRASH an interesting meta-movie, not so much about race as about the whole idea of ""interlock"" especially as it has become the common language to movies today.Seems like every other picture you see is all about, picking up the loose ends from act one and resolving them in some unexpected way--and that's all they're about.  If a girl gets up in the morning, and the camera shows her choosing between a red dress and a white dress at her closet, and she picks the red dress, by the end of the movie there will be a scene that is supposed to make you cry out, ""She should have picked the white dress!""  Indeed no image in cinema is photographed without a planned payoff, and that's why US movies are so by the book, even the cleverly juggled ones like PULP FICTION, and now CRASH.  When the Persian liquor store owners ask their beautiful, professional daughter what time she has to go to work, and she replies, ""Not until ten,"" there isn't a movie goer alive who doesn't know that-- much later on in the movie--her occupation will be a crucial reveal in the movie.  When Don Cheadle's bleary-eyed, Ethel Waters of a mother moans about ""Don Cheadle, when are you going to bring home your little brother?"" we just know there's going to be more about the brother, and smart moviegoers are taking bets on which character is was going to turn out to be.  At first I was sure it was Sandra Bullock, perhaps passing for white to pose as the ""wife"" of slick DA Brendan Fraser, constantly snappish maybe to conceal the fact that ""she"" was really a light-skinned black man.  I still think that would have been a better ending than the one we got.But nevertheless did I like this, or Cronenberg's CRASH better, I say this.  Both pictures may play equally to the racial fears of white North Americans, but at least this one didn't have James Spader, who must have been busy when they were casting for Brendan Fraser's part, which I consider a break for everyone involved.",4,Crash Course,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,2984,"['remember', 'being', 'Oscars', 'party', 'here', 'San', 'Francisco', 'year', 'movie', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'shout', 'dismay', 'went', 'room', 'when', 'were', 'cheated', 'Oscar', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'One', 'fellow', 'explained', 'Oscars', 'were', 'voted', 'bunch', 'wealthy', 'white', 'people', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'who', 'were', 'scared', 'minds', 'prospect', 'being', 'carjacked', 'blacks', 'guns', 'why', 'CRASH', 'won', 'superstitious', 'dread', 'reckoning', 'Then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'BONFIRE', 'THE', 'VANITIES', 'win', 'fool', 'asked', 'instead', 'been', 'universally', 'reviled', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'time.They', 'had', 'plenty', 'answers', 'one', 'whole', 'was', 'satisfied', 'explanation', 'fed', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'CRASH', 'DVD', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'shocked', 'find', 'enjoying', 'moment', 'OK', 'was', 'pretty', 'preposterous', 'OK', 'maybe', 'white', 'people', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'do', ""n't"", 'unleash', 'racial', 'prejudices', 'black', 'men', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'day', 'working', 'lives', 'found', 'CRASH', 'interesting', 'meta-movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'about', 'race', 'whole', 'idea', 'interlock', 'especially', 'become', 'common', 'language', 'movies', 'today.Seems', 'other', 'picture', 'see', 'picking', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'act', 'one', 'resolving', 'unexpected', 'way', ""'re"", 'girl', 'up', 'morning', 'camera', 'choosing', 'red', 'dress', 'white', 'dress', 'closet', 'red', 'dress', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'scene', 'supposed', 'make', 'cry', 'out', 'should', 'have', 'picked', 'white', 'dress', 'Indeed', 'image', 'cinema', 'photographed', 'planned', 'payoff', 'why', 'US', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'book', 'even', 'cleverly', 'juggled', 'ones', 'PULP', 'FICTION', 'now', 'CRASH', 'When', 'Persian', 'liquor', 'store', 'owners', 'ask', 'beautiful', 'professional', 'daughter', 'what', 'time', 'go', 'work', 'Not', 'ten', ""n't"", 'movie', 'goer', 'alive', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'later', 'movie', 'occupation', 'will', 'be', 'crucial', 'reveal', 'movie', 'When', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'bleary-eyed', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'mother', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'when', 'are', 'going', 'bring', 'home', 'little', 'brother', 'just', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'brother', 'smart', 'moviegoers', 'are', 'taking', 'bets', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'first', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'perhaps', 'passing', 'white', 'pose', 'wife', 'slick', 'DA', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'constantly', 'snappish', 'maybe', 'conceal', 'fact', 'was', 'really', 'light-skinned', 'black', 'man', 'still', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ending', 'one', 'got.But', 'nevertheless', 'did', 'Cronenberg', 'CRASH', 'better', 'say', 'pictures', 'may', 'play', 'equally', 'racial', 'fears', 'white', 'North', 'Americans', 'least', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'James', 'Spader', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'busy', 'when', 'were', 'casting', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'part', 'consider', 'break', 'everyone', 'involved']",Crash

It causes the viewers to take a look into their own stereotypes and expectations. Each interweaving situation has touching, provocative, and even funny moments. Set in Los Angeles, several identities are presented in Crash:  how blacks, whites, Arabs (or in this case, Persians assumed to be Arab) Asians, and Hispanics all perceive each other.  It looks into race-fueled issues on small scales (like associations to the name ""Shaniqua"") to large scales, such as terrorism and affirmative action.The cast includes familiar names such as Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Ludacris, and Ryan Phillpe, as well as some lesser-known faces like Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard, all who give top-notch performances.Now granted, coincidences in Crash get a little too common and *too* coincidental--for such a whopping city like L.A., events tend to get conveniently linked. Theoretically the person you hurt one day could be the person you save the next, but such flukes pop up all over the city on this particular day. But I don't think this pattern devalues the film.

920567,A3M9ULK9QECAMX,B000A3XY5A,K.I.B.,"[8, 11]","This movie is, to say the least, preachy. It wants to get a lesson across. But what lesson? And why do we need that lesson?  ""Crash"" comes across as an R-Rated version of the sensitivity movies kids are exposed to in middle-school social studies classes.  Intelligent adults should find this movie offensive as it rouses more controversy than necessary, treats the audience like the didn't already realize these things, and takes isolated incidents and makes them look like universals of which we are all guilty of having a part.  Only an idiot would be ""enlightened"" by this ""Crash"".All the scenarios in ""Crash"" are of the cookie-cutter variety.  Phony institutional racism, phony thugs, phony housewives, phony baloney everything.  Trust me when I say Sandra Bullock has never taken part in anything that should be taken for more than cheap entertainment.  I remember the part when the old Iranian woman says, ""Since when are Persians Arabs?"".  Ok, I get her point, but nobody would ever exclaim that point out-loud in such a way.  All that line really said to me was, ""Hey, audience, if you didn't know, some people from the mid-east are Persian.  If you think they are all Arab's, you're a racist"".  Also unbelievably lame was the part when the little girl doesn't get shot because there were blanks in the gun.  This is like a bad ending to a made-for-TV movie. I can't believe such a cornball cop-out could be featured in the best picture.  In real life, there aren't twists of fate where the little girl doesn't die because there were blanks in the gun.  In real life the girl DOES get shot and she DIES. That would really get a message across.Do you ever think that the main reason people are so concerned with not being racist and being politically correct is because the media propagates this message that there is an ether or bigotry everywhere?  Almost like the only way to not be a racist is to make sure you watch plenty of TV and Hollywood films so that you know how to act and what to say.  Racism will NEVER die.  Until we are all the same shade of grey there will always be ignorant racists.  This movie is a decade late in spreading a message that everybody already got.  I grew up all over the world (foreign country, big cities, small towns, big states and little islands) and I can honestly say that the most I've experienced racism is when I see it fictionalized on TV or in the movies (please do not take that as me saying I've never experienced it directly, I have, it's not pretty, but I usually pass it off as ignorance and refuse to take it for anything other than some idiot who can't evolve).

920568,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000A3XY5A,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[435, 605]","In high school most people in the United States have been taught that America is no longer a melting pot where different ethnicities are assimilated into one homogenous mix, but a tossed salad where people keep their differences from their ethnic backgrounds.  The ethnic background includes aspects such as race, linguistics, religion, and culture.  This knowledge frequently drifts into some unused part of the brain, as it slowly moves into oblivion.  Nonetheless, the ethnic differences between people continue to exist in the United States, as people work and handle their personal matters on a daily basis.  Crash tells a story of people from all parts of the world, as African-Americans, Asians, Caucasians, Hispanics, and Middle Easterners move through life and occasionally bump into each other by accident, a crash if you will.Through daily interaction people accidentally connect with each other where stereotypes and generalizations are made based on assumptions from the brief incidents, previous events, and hearsay.  This is often the result of simplified deduction, which could be colored by emotion and bias.  The skewed perception of people with different ethnicity could also stem from appearance, gender, and the socioeconomic status of the observer and the observed.  Paul Haggis directs several interesting characters from all walks of life such as police officers, criminals, locksmiths, storeowners, and TV directors.  Some are caring while others neglect those around them.  They have one thing in common with each other - no one is alike.Instead of playing the card of racism in a black and white manner, Haggis cleverly intertwines all of the characters through a truly genuine approach.  The origin of intolerance is being dissected through the camera that depicts the characters' behavior while also displaying the source of the behavior.  Through the characters Haggis displays different emotions such as fear, anger, hatred, and love.  These different emotions are expressed in different manners, as interactions between the characters accidentally appear.  Some times the observed feelings are subtle, as when Jean (Sandra Bullock) in fear grabs Rick's (Brendan Fraser) arm while Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) walk by them, which is even mentioned by Anthony.  Another more overt example is when Farhad (Shaun Toub) speaks in Farsi to his daughter at a gun store in Persian, as the gun store manager throws out prejudicial comments toward Farhad.Many of the scenes display racism, but the focus is on an incident before that triggered emotions such as rage, fear, and hatred.  These powerful emotions burn violently inside each person when being hostile, as the individual regresses into simplistic thinking using their stereotypes and generalizations as guides.  When each person regresses through anger someone always tends to get hurt either physically or emotionally.  In turn this anger breeds more anger much like Hydra, as when one head is cut off two new heads grow out.  The anger develops into fear of similar incidents which then is communicated to friends, media, or other channels of communication.  Sometimes people simply neglect to inform others of racist behavior in fear of repercussions.  Consequently, the fear brings about more negative generalizations that feed the hatred.  In the story the hatred is directed toward people due to their ethnicity, as race is the easiest thing to observe since it rests within the skin color of each person.Crash has a storyline over a 24-hour period that begins at the end with a car accident at a crime scene where a young man has been shot.  Ria (Jennifer Esposito) and Graham (Don Cheadle) exit the car, as Ria commences a verbal battle with an Asian lady and Graham approaches the crime scene.  This opening is a little taste of what is to come, as several different characters bump into each other by accident.  Each time two characters cross paths for whatever reason a new story emerges while it also affects the next story, as if the person was following his or her fate.  These stories are far more complex than the stereotypes and the generalizations, but life is also very complex.  This complexity will remind the audience of what they learned in high school, as the information will reemerge from oblivion.Viewers who have seen films by Robert Altman will definitely recognize the method of the storyline from brilliant films such as Nashville (1975),  Player (1992), and Short Cut (1993).  Crash also bares certain similarities with the spellbinding Magnolia (1999) and Grand Canyon (1991).  Despite these similarities Haggis develops a unique story about a very important issue through digging into the roots of the issue.  The terrific cast (Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Dashon Howard, Ludacris, Shaun Toub, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Tony Danza) enhances the visual experience by truly going deep into themselves while performing scenes with intense emotion.  One of the best scenes is when Matt Dillion's character, Officer Ryan, tries to help Christine (Thandie Newton) out of a car.  This scene will definitely strike a cord with all viewers, as both actors display their talent.  In the end, Crash connects with the audience in a manner that offers both cerebral participation and deep reflection of self in regard to an important issue and it should periodically be reflected upon to prevent history from repeating itself.",5,"Fear, Anger, Hatred, and Love Have No Color...",1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,5539,"['high', 'school', 'most', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'have',

A district attorney and his wife are carjacked in Los Angeles by a pair of black men, one of whom is the brother of a L.A. police detective, setting off a complex chain of events. The intertwined stories involve married couples, pairs of lovers, partners, and other family units. Though the focus at first seems to be a bit too obviously on race relations, the larger theme that emerges is the lack of communication that can turn a minor misunderstanding into violent tragedy with stunning speed. The pessimism of this theme is relieved by unexpected rays of hope--a life is saved by the seemingly miraculous failure of a weapon; a police officer whose cruelty stems from his seething anger at life gets an unexpected chance at redemption; an affluent and lonely woman discovers that her plain, patient housekeeper is her best friend.Haggis unfolds his potentially unwieldy tale with remarkable clarity--though the film is reminiscent of Altman's epics, Altman doesn't have this control of pacing--and though there are a few too many coincidences the points that are made are so convincing that one is willing, as in Dickens, to suspend disbelief for the sake of the emotional payoffs. That so many of these ring true must also be credited to the large and uniformly superb array of actors, many cast against type. Notable among them are past teen heartthrobs Matt Dillon and Ryan Philippe playing a pair of conflicted L.A. beat cops, and Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock (particularly noteworthy in her brief scenes) as the district attorney and his wife; but the whole is tied together by the understated style and great, sorrowing eyes of the superb Don Cheadle as the good half of the two brothers at the heart of this tale. Lastly, the film is notable for the ease with which it captures a dark, frequently hostile, yet ultimately all-embracing Los Angeles, which by the end has practically become another character.

Best of all, it's not preachy. It is an exquisitely acted, skillfully directed, and beautifully written examination of simple commonplace human frailty and cruelty.

There were a lot of important messages throughout this movie that obviously flew over a lot of people's heads. First of all, you have to watch this movie with an open mind without being caught up by the amazing all star cast, or by another ""racial injustice"" movie cliche. It's more than that. I liked it because it wasn't just back and white, but different ethnicities as a whole. Like it or not it's real, and people are still going through these struggles to this day. It's about being quick to judge others based on appereance alone. These are different stories crashing together (no pun intended) in order to show us that we're not as different as we may think. Like, for instance, Ryan Phillippe's character portrayed a white cop outraged by his white partner's actions towards a black couple when in actuality he was more racist than his partner could ever be. In fact, so racist that he shot and killed a black man for coming out of his jacket with what he automatically assumed would be a gun when it was indeed a small figure of a saint. Matt Dillion played his seemingly racist partner (very well I might add), but in actuality he was just another cop that was having a bad night, and decided to abuse his power like many of them tend to do. I recoginized the difference between him abusing his power and being a racist. If he were in fact a racist he would'nt have missed that opportunity to let a black woman die, but he did his job, and saved her life no different from the rest even though he could've died. Power combined with fear for his father led him to his actions. Let's not forget, Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser get car jacked by black thugs, and she's so outraged that she accuses the locksmith of being a gang banging ex-con just because he happened to be a Hispanic man with tatoos when in actuality he was just another hardworking man trying to support a daughter and a family. At any rate, her character had to realize that even though she had money, and a Hispanic housekeeper, that the Hispanic woman was indeed her best friend in the world. Even the Persian people where mistaken for Arabs when their store got vandalized just because someone was too ignorant to know the difference. I could go on and on about this movie, but I'll cut it short for now.

And for this you get nominated for awards?So the movie starts out hitting the viewer with several racial stereotypes:  blacks are violent criminals, blacks are drug abusers, arabs are angry, violent convenience store owners, asians can't drive, whites fear blacks [because they are violent criminals], and the laundry list goes on.

The acting was fine but the view of L.A. offered by the director is so skewed to make a point that errors in logic, not to mention obvious melodramatic set ups, stand out like the proverbial sore thumb. What is most discouraging, however, is that, after hammering at the viewer that horrific racial problems exist in the city and posing questions for which there are no easy answers, the film allows a number of the plots to resolve into sentimentality, melodramatic claptrap or feel good tableaux. Maybe the urge to send the audience home happy was too strong. Maybe the writer felt that for the film to succeed hope had to be offered. It's difficult to know.

920583,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000A3XY5A,Larry VanDeSande,"[11, 15]","To me, ""Crash"" is a remake of a 15-year-old film that dealt more subtly with the issues of racism and class warfare but also dealt with these issues in and around Los Angeles. That movie was ""Grand Canyon.""If ""Grand Canyon"" wasn't worthy of Oscar nomination why did ""Crash"" win the Oscar? I think because members of the Motion Picture Academy, when presented with a slate of bland films, respond very well to movies about social issues that affect Angelenos and, therefore, affect members of the academy.This would explain why the average buddy film ""Sideways"" was considered an Oscar worthy movie last year and why ""Crash"" won it this year when better movies like ""The Upside of Anger"" didn't get a sniff.""Crash"" has a wonderful cast and was co-produced by Don Cheadle, an effective actor whose stature in Hollywood went through the roof after ""Hotel Rwanda."" I heard the producers of ""Crash"" sent every academy voter a DVD of the film and that that was the first time such a thing has ever happened. Is that why it won the Oscar as best picture?Certainly the academy responds to movies made by Hollywood insiders like Cheadle. Any Clint Eastwood film, however dull or unremarkable, is just about certain to be nominated for best picture Oscar and, in most years, to win the prize.So is this a movie that's more about the machinations in Hollywood that what's going on on the streets of L.A.? Perhaps. I've been to Los Angeles but not long enough to feel the unflinching negativity presented in this movie. Everyone there didn't seem to me to be a loser, like all the people projected in this movie.I am certain that, if there is indeed racism in L.A., it is more subtly practiced than the way it's presented in this movie. It is certainly more subtly practiced in the part of the world where I live than its presentation in this movie.I can't wholeheartedly recommend you run out and buy this picture, even though it has achieved fame. I did not find any of its performances far from average even though its cast is starry. Nor did I find its storyline very enthralling or entertaining. I see much lower profile films that this all the time that are more entertaining and more interesting, not to mention more well acted.As to the racism angle, I think that issue is better managed in older movies like ""Black Like Me"", based on the book of the same name.

920584,A1VLCEVT52XENT,B000A3XY5A,Laura,"[1, 5]","This film is not for everybody.  The dialogs in this film are very racy and harsh, so if you don't like this kinds of film then you may want to rent something else.  I was not going to write a review for this movie, until I read reviews from some of the reviewers, which made me very upset.  I can understand that there might be some points in this movie that you might like, that's the chance that you have to take when you rent this kinds of movies.  But, what annoyed me about these reviewers were, they act like they didn't know what this movie was about, and they went to see it or rent the movie and was suprised that it was about racisim.  I knew right away what this movie was about when I saw the trailer and commercial on t.v.  What do these ""Were you tricked into liking this movie?"" and ""Good cast and acting that's all"" reviewers think before they saw the movie?  Did they think this movie was like the Flintstones?  The reviewer ""Were you tricked"" made me really mad when this person said crap written by people ignorant of racisim in America.  I am thinking that this person is not a minority.  On top of that he even picked on someone who is brave and driven to put out movies that makes you think ""Spike Lee"".  I don't know too many directors that make movies from the minority point of view-WAY TO GO SPIKE LEE!  When I saw many of the scenes in this movie, I was taken back to many different times when I personaly encountered something close to those kinds of stressful situations.  I even heard many minorities telling me stories about theses kinds of similurar situations that they encountered.  Unless you have been in their shoes, don't automatically accuse people of this country, both majorities and minorities of being ignorant of racisim.  Now, I'm not saying that one m inority faces racsism everyday of his/her life, but the minorities do encouter racisism in this country, just like I'm sure some of the majorities have encountered some stressful situtuations that were similure (I'm not saying exactly like the movie) in this movie.  The reivewer who wrote ""have some good acting but that's all"", made me upset when he stated that he was sick and tired of this kind of movies, and that he did not needed to be reminded of racisism.  He even go far to be nasty by demeaning people who bought this movie.  It's one thing to not like how the movie was put together.  You can think that maybe the dialog in this movie was to harsh or something of that line, but go go far as what these two reviewers said, it makes me very angry!  What makes me even more angrier was that, there were plenty of comercials and trailers that were shown for this movie.  I knew what this movie was about before renting it, so why did these two reviewers who sounds like they don't like to rent these kinds of ""makes you think"" movie even see this film?  What I liked about this movie was that it was not about black people vs white people.  Lot of times when people refer to minorities, it seems like they picture blacks and whites.  But, this film covered almost all groups including whites.  We got to see it from everyone's perspective.  I especially liked towards end involving the guy with a gun and the locksmith with a kid.  This film in my eyes is not a perfect film.  Could this film be made better, well of course it could have made better.  But, overall I think the director did a super job with the actors, actresses and the script.  The reviewer ""has good acting but that's it"", even slambed the actors and actersses saying that they made this film to make a bundle of money. I thought what he said was just so stupid!  If he does not want the celebrarities to make money doing their job, then he can stop renting videos, going to movies or buy DVDs from now on.  This way, he can make sure that none of his money goes to actors and actresses.  I have never heard of any actors and actresses that stars in movies that don't make money.  May be these two reviewers should stick with movies that are more of a nonbrainer like The Blob or Waynes World.  I didn't like some of the scenes in this movie, but overall this film is a great film for those who knows what to get out of it.  This film is definately not for everyone, but I for one glade that I've seen it.  This film, especially scenes that involed that little girl and the locksmith really warmed my heart.",4,Very energetic film!,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,4384,"['film', 'not', 'everybody', 'dialogs', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'racy', 'harsh', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kinds', 'film', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'rent', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'write', 'review', 'movie', 'read', 'reviews', 'reviewers', 'made', 'very', 'upset', 'can', 'understand', 'might', 'be', 'points', 'movie', 'might', 'like', 'chance', 'have', 'take', 'when', 'rent', 'kinds', 'movies', 'what', 'annoyed', 'reviewers', 'were', 'act', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'went', 'see', 'rent', 'movie', 'was', 'suprised', 'was', 'racisim', 'knew', 'right', 'away', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'commercial', 't.v', 'What', 'do', 'Were', 'tricked', 'liking', 'movie', 'Good', 'cast', 'acting', 'reviewers', 'think', 'saw', 'movie', 'Did', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'Flintstones', 'reviewer', 'Were', 'tricked', 'made', 'really', 'mad', 'when', 'person', 'said', 'crap', 'written', 'people', 'ignorant', 'racisim', 'America', 'am', 'thinking', 'person', 'not', 'minority', 'top', 'even', 'picked', 'someone', 'who', 'brave', 'driven', 'put', 'out', 'movies', 'think', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'many', 'directors', 'make', 'movies', 'minority', 'point', 'view-WAY', 'TO', 'GO', 'SPIKE', 'LEE', 'When', 'saw', 'many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'taken', 'back', 'many', 'different', 'times', 'when', 'personaly', 'encountered', 'something', 'close', 'kinds', 'stressful', 'situations', 'even', 'heard', 'many', 'minorities', 'telling', 'stories', 'theses', 'kinds', 'similurar', 'situations', 'encountered', 'have', 'been', 'shoes', 'do', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'accuse', 'people', 'country', 'majorities', 'minorities', 'being', 'ignorant', 'racisim', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'one', 'm', 'inority', 'racsism', 'everyday', 'his/her', 'life', 'minorities', 'do', 'encouter', 'racisism', 'country', 'just', ""'m"", 'sure', 'majorities', 'have', 'encountered', 'stressful', 'situtuations', 'were', 'similure', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'exactly', 'movie', 'movie', 'reivewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'have', 'good', 'acting', 'made', 'upset', 'when', 'stated', 'was', 'sick', 'tired', 'kind', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'needed', 'be', 'reminded', 'racisism', 'even', 'go', 'far', 'be', 'nasty', 'demeaning', 'people', 'who', 'bought', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'like', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'can', 'think', 'maybe', 'dialog', 'movie', 'was', 'harsh', 'something', 'line', 'go', 'go', 'far', 'what', 'two', 'reviewers', 'said', 'very', 'angry', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'angrier', 'was', 'were', 'plenty', 'comercials', 'trailers', 'were', 'shown', 'movie', 'knew', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'renting', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'two', 'reviewers', 'who', 'sounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'rent', 'kinds', 'think', 'movie', 'even', 'see', 'film', 'What', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'black', 'people', 'vs', 'white', 'people', 'Lot', 'times', 'when', 'people', 'refer', 'minorities', 'picture', 'blacks', 'whites', 'film', 'covered', 'almost', 'groups', 'including', 'whites', 'got', 'see', 'everyone', 'perspective', 'especially', 'liked', 'towards', 'end', 'involving', 'guy', 'gun', 'locksmith', 'kid', 'film', 'eyes', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'Could', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'better', 'well', 'course', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'overall', 'think', 'director', 'did', 'super', 'job', 'actors', 'actresses', 'script', 'reviewer', 'good', 'acting', 'even', 'slambed', 'actors', 'actersses', 'saying', 'made', 'film', 'make', 'bundle', 'money', 'thought', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'stupid', 'not', 'want', 'celebrarities', 'make', 'money', 'doing', 'job', 'then', 'can', 'stop', 'renting', 'videos', 'going', 'movies', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'now', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'sure', 'none', 'money', 'actors', 'actresses', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'actors', 'actresses', 'stars', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'money', 'May', 'be', 'two', 'reviewers', 'should', 'stick', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'nonbrainer', 'Blob', 'Waynes', 'World', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'scenes', 'movie', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'who', 'what', 'get', 'film', 'definately', 'not', 'everyone', 'one', 'glade', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'especially', 'involed', 'little', 'girl', 'locksmith', 'really', 'warmed', 'heart']",Crash

In fact, one of writer-director Paul Haggis's main purposes in this 2005 film is to confront viewers with their racism, which requires you to acknowledge it as a necessary firs step.  The characters and situations are carefully constructed to the point that even the very best of characters finds their actions colored by racism.  The question then becomes what these characters will do when confronted with their own racism.""Crash"" tells the story of a group of couples who do not know each other, but who interact with each other, both as couples and as individuals.  There is district attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito), police officers Sgt. Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe), a television director named Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), a shop owner named Farhad (Shaun Toub) and his daughter, Daniel (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) the lock-smith and his daughter Lara (Ashlyn Sanchez), and Peter(Larenz Tate) and his friend Anthony (Ludacris).  I could detail the races of each character, but your knowledge of the actors and the names of the characters will tell you most of that.  Besides, you really need to just watch this movie.The interactions between these characters leads them to do things they have never done before, and the best thing I can say about this film beyond that it makes you think is that there are very few predictable moments in it.  If anything, there are several points where you might be absolutely convinced you know what is going to happen, or at least what is being set up, but you turn out to be wrong.  The various plot threads end in different ways, some good and some bad, as connections between character you may or may not have realized are revealed.  Not everything fits together, because the pieces of ""Crash"" do not make up one large puzzle and there is not a universal answer to the question of racism.Overall, ""Crash"" is am ambitious and thoughtful film; you can see easily see Bullock, Cheadle, and the others were attracted by the script, which was co-written by Robert Moresco (""One Eyed King"") from the story by Haggis (I fully expect this original screenplay is going to be nominated for an Oscar as much by how it plays out the intricate elements as by the value of the subject matter).  The ensemble performances are as good as you would expect, although Dillon's performance clearly stands out (and he gets more scenes than most of his castmates).  There are points in this film that do get a bit heavy handed, more in terms of the music than anything else.  I can recognize a moment that is uplifting without swelling music with religious overtones.  ""Crash"" is better when it drives home its point in a quiet moment, and while there might be moments that you think over reach, there are more than hit home.  Just be warned that this is a fairly intense film and even with a cathartic release at the end, watching ""Crash"" can be a draining experience.",5,You think you know who you are?

I find Paul Haggis' intentions to discuss issues of prejudice admirable, but, in the end, I am disappointed.  First of all I cannot handle the mixing of race and ethnicity as if one was the same as the other.  (At least the Latina/Hispanic/ Chicana character gets that one sorta right!)  I also cannot handle the inevitable mingling of all of these people in encounters with each other in a place as big as Los Angeles in such a short period of time.

The main theme is racism in the USA and the mess they've all seem to have gotten themselves in over there (the so-called melting pot), and which demonstrates itself at every opportunity, most notably during natural as well as man-made disasters.Nevertheless, the film also sends the message (as it should do) that there is hope and that there will always be hope.What I found especially interesting is how one group in particular, which is small in numbers and yet has an extremely and unusually high profile, is mysteriously absent from this film.  What is even more interesting is that this particular group always finds itself in the forefront in matters of discrimination, but also of US politics (as of lately), the media, and Hollywood (as producers usually/mostly, but also and to a lesser degree as directors and actors, and always successful).  So to have them being absent from a film such as this is surprising indeed.Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

Set in Los Angeles, with a large cast of excellent actors, the theme is racism the crash of human beings against each other.  These crashes are constant and often have surprising results.  And yet, they are all too familiar.  This film brings light to this very unpleasant subject, and it does this in a way that is immediate, forceful and easy to understand.There's Sandra Bullock, an upscale white woman, who fears blacks and Mexicans and makes assumptions.  There's Don Cheadle, a black detective whose younger brother seems to be on the road to crime.  There's a wealthy Chinese couple engaged in an illegal trade.  There's an Iranian man who is mistaken for an Arab and who commits a disparate act.  There's Matt Dillon as a racist police officer who humiliates a black couple but who is having trouble with the HMO bureaucracy that is keeping his father from getting proper medical treatment.  There's his younger rookie cop partner who tries to do good but yet lets his own prejudices cloud his judgment with dire results.  These are just a few examples.  There are many more.  In fact, the whole film is a series of culture clashes where everyone has assumptions and anything can happen.The film moves fast and completely pulled me in.  The characters feel real and multi-dimensional.  The screenplay is excellent and often touches a nerve just below the surface that we all can recognize.  It's also courageous, putting into words some angry and unpleasant thoughts.  Once in a while I found it a little preachy for my taste but mostly I just was drawn into the story.

It interweaves the lives of complete strangers ... black, white, Hispanic, Chinese, and Indian.  Each person, due to personal experiences, has perceptions about those of other races.  Due to these perceptions, given a certain set of circumstances, those perceptions rise to the surface, making a bad situation even worse.What's so wonderful about the film, however, is how these perceptions become a mirror, reflecting each individual's hatred back at himself; and in each instance, the person does not like what he is seeing.  For instance, when a white cop molests a black woman, he is later put in the position of saving her life.  She, of course, pushes against him, while he is trying to save her life.  In that moment, they are both changed, for the better.This is one of the most unique films that I have ever seen.Be sure to watch the video for the song ""If I ..."" by KansasCali in the Special Features.

Quido ""quidrock""","[3, 12]","Although, when asked about the best films I saw last year, the movie ""Crash"" made my top 5 list, I'm not sure it deserved the ""film of the year"" consideration given it, when the Oscar was awarded.That said, and without comparing it to any of the other nominated films, ""Crash"" is, without a doubt, one of the most poignant and memorable films I've seen in the decade.  DirectorPaul Haggis, a gifted Canadian, comes to the film with mostly writing credits behind him (he collaborated with long-time friend Robert Moresco on Crash).  A long time television writer who did stints on some of my favorite shows (thirtysomething, Due South and Family Law) but also created some turkeys (Walker:  Texas Ranger comes to mind). Having scored big with his script for ""Million Dollar Baby"", Haggis was given a blank check to film ""Crash"", which attracted an incredible number of ""known"" actors and actresses to bit parts and cameos.Here Moresco and Haggis used the ensemble format so successful for ""Traffic"" to portray LA again, with all its foibles.  The memorable quote by Don Cheadle, as officer Graham, permeates the film and defineds the feeling of LA...""In LA nobody touches you......we crash into each other just so we can feel something.""  Crime and race issues prevail in the film, with Cheadle and the surprising Terrence Howard leading the way as black men, successful in fields where black men are usually in the shadows.  Have they achieved what they've achieved by essentially forgetting their race?  No race conflict of America today - black vs. white, Palestinian vs. all the other classes, Hispanic classified as lesser citizens...escapes notice.Haggis and Co. present the vignettes that invariably interlock with grace and wisdom.  Completing the film is a truly remarkable score, with the now famous ""If I...."" by KansasCali running through your head over and over after you see the film.The rescue of  Thandie Newton by policeman Matt Dillon (who has previously given one of the most egregious treatments to the her as the victim of one of his traffic stops) is amazingly filmed and breathtaking, and probably revisited the most of any scene in the film.  By far however, the two most incredible scenes belong to actor Michael Pena, who tenderly has a moment with his small daughter, begetting to her his ""invisible cloak"" and  then collapses on film when his conflict with Palestinian Frahad (Shaun Toub in a great performance)results in his daughter's shooting.There is no question that Crash is a well-made, memorable film that everyone should see.",5,Crash - the film of the year?,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,2561,"['when', 'asked', 'best', 'films', 'saw', 'last', 'year', 'movie', 'Crash', 'made', 'top', '5', 'list', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'deserved', 'film', 'year', 'consideration', 'given', 'when', 'Oscar', 'was', 'said', 'comparing', 'other', 'nominated', 'films', 'Crash', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'memorable', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decade', 'DirectorPaul', 'Haggis', 'gifted', 'Canadian', 'film', 'mostly', 'writing', 'credits', 'collaborated', 'long-time', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Moresco', 'Crash', 'long', 'time', 'television', 'writer', 'who', 'did', 'stints', 'favorite', 'shows', 'thirtysomething', 'Due', 'South', 'Family', 'Law', 'also', 'created', 'turkeys', 'Walker', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'mind', 'Having', 'scored', 'big', 'script', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Haggis', 'was', 'given', 'blank', 'check', 'film', 'Crash', 'attracted', 'incredible', 'number', 'known', 'actors', 'actresses', 'bit', 'parts', 'cameos.Here', 'Moresco', 'Haggis', 'used', 'ensemble', 'format', 'so', 'successful', 'Traffic', 'portray', 'LA', 'again', 'foibles', 'memorable', 'quote', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'officer', 'Graham', 'film', 'feeling', 'LA', 'LA', 'nobody', 'touches', 'crash', 'other', 'just', 'can', 'feel', 'something', 'Crime', 'race', 'issues', 'prevail', 'film', 'Cheadle', 'surprising', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'leading', 'way', 'black', 'men', 'successful', 'fields', 'where', 'black', 'men', 'are', 'usually', 'shadows', 'Have', 'achieved', 'what', ""'ve"", 'achieved', 'essentially', 'forgetting', 'race', 'race', 'conflict', 'America', 'today', 'black', 'vs.', 'white', 'Palestinian', 'other', 'classes', 'Hispanic', 'classified', 'lesser', 'citizens', 'notice.Haggis', 'Co.', 'present', 'vignettes', 'invariably', 'interlock', 'grace', 'wisdom', 'Completing', 'film', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'score', 'now', 'famous', 'KansasCali', 'running', 'head', 'see', 'film.The', 'rescue', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'policeman', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'previously', 'given', 'one', 'most', 'egregious', 'treatments', 'her', 'victim', 'one', 'traffic', 'stops', 'amazingly', 'filmed', 'breathtaking', 'probably', 'revisited', 'most', 'scene', 'film', 'far', 'however', 'two', 'most', 'incredible', 'scenes', 'belong', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'who', 'tenderly', 'moment', 'small', 'daughter', 'begetting', 'invisible', 'cloak', 'then', 'film', 'when', 'conflict', 'Palestinian', 'Frahad', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'great', 'performance', 'results', 'daughter', 'shooting.There', 'question', 'Crash', 'well-made', 'memorable', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see']",Crash
920599,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B000A3XY5A,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[2, 4]","Crash is probably one of the most thought-provoking, well-written and beautifully acted films I have seen this year. In a collage of collisions, traffic and human, the disturbing underbelly of racism in LA is exposed in all its forms, each plot line producing outrageous events and even more surprising resolutions. With a cross-section of the public, multi-ethnic characters, cops, the advantaged and the disadvantaged, Crash manages to reach beneath the smooth exterior of everyday life, revealing the fractures that run through day to day relationships, the cherished prejudices, offensive remarks and outrageous attitudes that often go unchallenged, perpetuating more of the same misinformation. The acting is finely nuanced, Don Cheadle's disaffected police detective, Graham, Matt Dillon's jaded and racist cop agonizing over an ill father at the mercy of an uncaring health provider, a bickering black couple (Thandie Newton and Terence Howard), who are humiliated by police officers (Matt Dillon and Ryan Philippe), the husband's manhood put to the test and found wanting, an Iraqi shop-owner, confounded by his new country and a language he cannot navigate.Brilliantly scripted and acted, this film is an example of the quality Hollywood should be providing instead of trite comedies and lackluster superheroes, as potent as Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"", exposing, transforming, confounding in every scene. With all the obvious disaffections of our society, absolutely nothing is predictable, the characters challenged at every turn, their precious beliefs transformed by changing events. Stereotypes abound, as do personal epiphanies, death defeated by a fickle choice, an astonishing exercise in the vagaries of fate and the promise of hope, no matter how spectral in the broader perspective. There are no facile answers and all issues aren't resolved, but the film is a wake up call to those deadened by the endless cacophony of daily defeats and the helpless rage that accompanies almost every endeavor. In moments of personal challenge and an almost overwhelming failure to achieve harmony on even the most elemental level, Crash reminds us of our humanity and ability to transcend our basest responses to crisis.

920604,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000A3XY5A,"Maine Writer ""David""","[22, 29]","The hype over Crash and its alleged insight into bigotry and intolerance in America may best serve as a sobering reminder of the superficiality of the public debate on these issues. Sadly, Crash's approach may be miles wide, but it's inches deep.First, Crash's characters are, at best, stereotypes: the bigoted cop with a heart of gold, the successful black man under the thumb of whitey, the hispanic mechanic who is also the soft-hearted family man, the shrewish, friendless wife, and on and on. Some critics try to forgive Crash on the grounds that these characters (more appropriately, caricatures) are archetypes in some highly tuned modern fable--that there is some essential, transcendent truth that rises from these conceptualized people. These defenses are little more than examples of The Emperor's New Clothes. Characters in a play or movie can serve many purposes. However, none of them in Crash are served by characters that are, to put it bluntly, fake. In fact, the characters had the feel of people that one might invent if you lived in an ivory tower and never really encountered a flesh and blood person.Second, the events in Crash, symbolic or not, appear shoe-horned into the story--relying on coincidences, or, indeed, the improbable, to make points for which such deus ex machina moments are hardly necessary. I felt as manipulated as the woman who finds herself rescued by the police officer who molested her. Sorry, but rule number one of storytelling is that miraculous coincidences that advance the plot or make a ""point"" are the tools of the inexperienced and inartful.  Crash is littered with them. And even in instances where the miraculous doesn't save the day,  Crash resorts to sappy moments of unconvincing enlightenment, such as the rich wife who breaks a leg and then has the revelation that the maid she abuses is the best friend she has.  It makes my stomach turn just reliving that moment.The entirety of Crash, in fact, has this feel of looking at people and society through a glass that doesn't let you touch them, speak to them, or even hear them. It's like the uninformed meditations of royalty on the problems of the common man.  And maybe that's why it appealed to so many members of the Academy.",2,"Not ""best picture"" ... not by a long shot.",1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,2240,"['hype', 'Crash', 'alleged', 'insight', 'bigotry', 'intolerance', 'America', 'may', 'best', 'serve', 'sobering', 'reminder', 'superficiality', 'public', 'debate', 'issues', 'Sadly', 'Crash', 'approach', 'may', 'be', 'miles', 'wide', 'inches', 'deep.First', 'Crash', 'characters', 'are', 'best', 'stereotypes', 'bigoted', 'cop', 'heart', 'gold', 'successful', 'black', 'man', 'thumb', 'whitey', 'hispanic', 'mechanic', 'who', 'also', 'soft-hearted', 'family', 'man', 'shrewish', 'friendless', 'wife', 'critics', 'try', 'forgive', 'Crash', 'grounds', 'characters', 'more', 'appropriately', 'caricatures', 'are', 'archetypes', 'highly', 'tuned', 'modern', 'fable', 'essential', 'transcendent', 'truth', 'conceptualized', 'people', 'defenses', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'examples', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Clothes', 'Characters', 'play', 'movie', 'can', 'serve', 'many', 'purposes', 'However', 'none', 'Crash', 'are', 'served', 'characters', 'are', 'put', 'bluntly', 'fake', 'fact', 'characters', 'had', 'feel', 'people', 'one', 'might', 'invent', 'lived', 'ivory', 'tower', 'never', 'really', 'encountered', 'flesh', 'blood', 'person.Second', 'events', 'Crash', 'symbolic', 'not', 'appear', 'shoe-horned', 'story', 'relying', 'coincidences', 'indeed', 'improbable', 'make', 'points', 'such', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'moments', 'are', 'hardly', 'necessary', 'felt', 'as', 'manipulated', 'woman', 'who', 'rescued', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'molested', 'Sorry', 'rule', 'number', 'one', 'storytelling', 'miraculous', 'coincidences', 'advance', 'plot', 'make', 'point', 'are', 'tools', 'inexperienced', 'inartful', 'Crash', 'littered', 'even', 'instances', 'where', 'miraculous', ""n't"", 'save', 'day', 'Crash', 'sappy', 'moments', 'unconvincing', 'enlightenment', 'such', 'rich', 'wife', 'who', 'leg', 'then', 'revelation', 'maid', 'best', 'friend', 'stomach', 'turn', 'just', 'reliving', 'moment.The', 'entirety', 'Crash', 'fact', 'feel', 'looking', 'people', 'society', 'glass', ""n't"", 'let', 'touch', 'speak', 'even', 'hear', 'uninformed', 'meditations', 'royalty', 'problems', 'common', 'man', 'maybe', 'why', 'appealed', 'so', 'many', 'members', 'Academy']",Crash

Do they feel that because the film goes the way of being (semi-)Politically Incorrect, that somehow its message is somehow new, or more important, or better than any other films that tackle the race question (if that question even exists)?  This movie wants to be so bold and noble, but other than dropping a few one liners about sterotypes (some of which can be pretty funny), there is nothing bold or original about this film.  There's really nothing negative I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said.  I just wish that more people were able to see through the crap, the cliches, and the trite, and recognize that this is a perfect example of someone (Haggis) trying WAY too hard to say something that's already been said.  Not only has it been said, its been said better.  If you're really interested in watching a GOOD film dealing with race relations, watch Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing (1989), or the French film La Haine (Hate) and skip this crap. Neither of those films are as cheesy and melodramtic.  The characters seem MUCH more real, the scenerious are so much more believable, and even when those films to break away from convention into the UNbeliveable, they're handled with grace, maturity, and depth...instead of forcing us, through bad music, slow motion, and unnecessary, over-dramatic climaxes that attempt to change us and the characters. I really just don't get it...how can THIS movie be looked at in such a positive light?  Are you all mad?  Are you all SERIOUSLY this easy to manipulate?

920606,A129YBX5BVNW2,B000A3XY5A,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[0, 1]","A Persian father is booted out of a gun store in Los Angeles because of a verbal battle with the white all-American shop owner about Bin Laden and 9/11. Farad (played to a tee by the brilliant Shaun Toub) simply wants to defend his small general store against further racial attacks and thieves. His beautiful and sophisticated daughter Darii (played by Bahar Soomekh) steps up the counter to defend her rattled father. She demands bullets for the gun she is going to buy for him and randomly asks for the 'red box' behind him. But the shop owner (a fantastic Jack McGee of &#34;Rescue Me&#34;) doesn&#8217;t tell Darii how much &#8216;bang&#8217; for your bucks the red ones give. And so a sequence of events begins that will eventually see a child in the arms of her Latino father with his face contorted in agony as he holds her limp body to his chest&#8230;Interlocking something like nine different stories into one cohesive unit and then trying to deal with the explosive subject of racism within 'everybody' was always going to be a tall order. So why did Don Cheadle and all the other Hollywood big names believe in it so? Ten minutes into 2004&#8217;s &#34;Crash&#34; and the answer is obvious &#8211; the simply stunning script Director Paul Haggis co-wrote with Bobby Moresco.The dialogue comes at you with a ferocity and brilliance that is in your face in every angry and difficult scene - yet it&#8217;s also loaded with subtle undercurrents of truth about how people really are - and what they really think &#8211; on all sides. No one in this movie is clean or perfect or even wrong &#8211; most are just good people placed into a cauldron that all too often pushes them to make presumptions and take sides &#8211; glaring suspiciously at people from different ethnicities from behind the safety of their metal and glass &#8211; voyeurs in a city where no one walks and very few touch each other&#8230;Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock play the District Attorney and his wife &#8211; a wealthy woman who wakes up angry every day and doesn&#8217;t know why anymore (both give blistering performances). Their Lincoln Continental is boosted one night on the Strip by two mouthy black youths constantly arguing about colour and its place in the community (stunning work from Ludacris and Larenze Tate). The DA calls in his assistant to handle the political fall out (&#34;Either I lose the black vote or I&#8217;m perceived as soft on crime&#8230;&#34;). But when the blabbering duo run over a Chinaman standing by the door of his locked van because they&#8217;re not paying attention - it sets in motion a chain of events that will eventually bring one of them back to the van to look at the human cargo chained to the floor in the back&#8230;Later that night the corruption-free Detective Graham Waters (a hugely affecting Don Cheadle) is called upon to check on a homicide &#8211; the body of a black boy dumped in the grassy scrubs overlooking Hollywood. As he exits his car Graham sighs at his mixed race lover and homicide assistant Ria (fabulous work by Jennifer Esposito) engages in a slagging match with an arrogant Chinese woman who&#8217;s crashed her car recklessly into the back of someone else (&#34;Maybe your 'blake' lights are broken!&#34; Ria shouts at her - racially mimicking her bad diction). All this and Graham&#8217;s mother (Beverly Todd) is never too far away from a needle and his brother AWOL somewhere in the City Of Angels with two strikes and a third warrant that will jail him for 20 years. Also on his mind is an adjacent case of a white cop with a history of shooting black men and getting away with it &#8211; the trigger-happy William Lewis found with $300,000 hidden in a tyre in his trunk. But then back at the scene on the hillside &#8211; Detective Graham Waters freezes as he recognizes something about the bloodied body&#8230;Earlier that day Officer John Ryan and his rookie partner (Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe) enter their squad car for another weary round of confrontations. A 17-year veteran of the city beat - John Ryan appears to be a racist cop who can&#8217;t get a break for his aging father whose living with him &#8211; Dad battling a urinary tract infection that makes his nights a draining physical agony. His younger more idealistic partner despises Ryan&#8217;s remarks and abuse of power &#8211; none more so &#8211; than when they stop a well-to-do Black TV Director and his beautiful wife (Terence Howard and Thandie Newton as Cameron and Christine Thayer) on Ventura Boulevard driving a car that is similar to the one reported as stolen from the white DA. There ensues a hands-on search that sees Ryan become far too friendly with what&#8217;s beneath Christine&#8217;s cocktail dress. She cringes as her black husband apologises and appeases the wholly unnecessary humiliation. They scream at each other at home and he boils inside on set - as everything seems to be bringing out the street thug in him that he left behind decades ago&#8230;A Latino father (Michael Pena) who works as a Locksmith tries to comfort his 5-year old daughter Lara who is hiding under her bed because of bang-sounds she heard in the darkness outside. He tells her that they moved to this better neighbourhood to get away from those bullet-things &#8211; and better still &#8211; Dad has a magical cloak given to him by a fairy when he was a child that he must now pass on to her. Its 'impenetrable' Dad tells her &#8211; she smiles as he clips it around her. Lara will use it later (dialogue above) to jump in the path of a bullet when Farad uses his gun in a moment of madness &#8211; having found a receipt in a dumpster for the Latino man he believes cheated him by not fixing his lock properly&#8230;The cast is magnificent &#8211; especially the women &#8211; both Bullock and Newton going to places they found horrible and unsettling. Loretta Devine, Nona Gaye, Karina Arroyave, Marina Sirtis, Beverly Todd, Alexis Rhee and Ashlyn Sanchez as Lara &#8211; they are all &#8216;so&#8217; good.I wish I could say the BLU RAY print is a marvel &#8211; far from it. The Director and DOP decided on hand-held shots a lot of the time to give vibrancy and capture the differing shades of Los Angeles. And as a lot of the scenes are either at night or in the enclosed spaces of homes &#8211; the grain is terrible. When it gets to the daylight and open surroundings &#8211; it looks gorgeous &#8211; but that&#8217;s only every now and then. Having said that &#8211; this is not a film where you&#8217;re looking for visual perfection &#8211; it has you too riveted for that.Audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital, DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 and Subtitles are English For The Hard Of Hearing. Extras include a feature-length commentary by Director Paul Haggis, Don Cheadle and Bobby Moresco, Deleted Scenes, &#34;Behind The Metal And Glass &#8211; Making of Crash&#34;, &#34;L.A. &#8211; The Other man Character&#34;, &#34;Unspoken&#34; Featurette. The extras show how Don Cheadle&#8217;s initial interest and standing in the acting community brought such A-Listers on board &#8211; it also features detailed discussion on characters and the difficulties in the script by Producer by Cathy Schulman. Mark Isham also compliments the movie with a wonderful score.The movie is dedicated to Anita Addison &#8211; a TV and Film Producer and Lifelong Friend of Paul Haggis who died in 2004.There are exchanges between characters in &#34;Crash&#34; that are so cutting edge and bristling with rage and anger &#8211; that it&#8217;s sometimes a hugely uncomfortable watch &#8211; and that is part of the point. It isn&#8217;t perfect by any means &#8211; some of it feels a bit too preachy - and after all the preceding excellence &#8211; I felt it ended rather poorly.But there is also humanity and redemption &#8211; the scene where Matt Dillon pulls Thandie Newton from an upturned burning car is one of the most charged and yet tender I have ever seen (career bests for both).Winner of Three Academy Awards including Best Picture &#8211; &#34;Crash&#34; is properly great filmmaking.&#34;How far can bullets go?&#34; 5-year old Lara asks her father.

Paul Haggis, Academy Award Nominee for writing Million Dollar Baby, tops himself with this one.  Of all of the Oscar contenders this year, Crash is surely the favorite to win, and for good reason.  This movie effects everyone, whereas all of the other nominees, while amazing films, only deal with a specific subject.  Using the race card in movies works wonders if you know how to use it right.  This movie is a classier version of 2002's Changing Lanes (which was underrated).  The movie has amazing performances throughout, especially by Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle, but I don't think Dillon matches up with other Supporting Actors in his category, especially Clooney and Giamatti.  Each member of the cast relies on everyone else, and they all give one strong performance together rather than one great actor and the rest being mediocre.

This film lacks, among other things, a sense of proportion or context which renders its assumptions without useful point. Everyone is equally racist with the same equal effect, so why change anything? Even worse, white racist assumptions are given a credibility that only the Klan could appreciate.Why did Paul Haggis make this movie? Was it because he was aware that some people noticed a tinge of racism in the over-praised ""Million Dollar Baby""-the screenplay of which he was the author? In that film, a mentally-touched redneck spouting racial slurs became a sympathetic character, while the black man who was the target of his slurs turned out to be the real ""bad guy."" And then the white female boxer became the victim of an evil black female boxer, with the unwitting ""connivance"" of a dumb Hispanic corner man. Perhaps Haggis, aware that the film was infused with his own racial stereotypes, wanted to make a film about stereotypes in general to ease his guilt.Unfortunately, the film is such a jumble of racial stereotyping that it is almost beyond credibility.  Many whites may believe that all blacks are potential thieves, even those dressed like college students; and so Haggis obliges the racial bigot by confirming that stereotypes. White women, meanwhile, are-despite the media stereotype-the least likely demographic to be victim of a crime, yet here we have another stereotype confirmed. Haggis even goes so far as putting views that would more likely come out of white supremacist's mouth into a black man's. Hell, if blacks are as racist as neo-Nazis, why should we concern ourselves with the latter?That is what I mean by a lack of proportion. White bigots who ignore the effects of their own racism--especially in the economic and educational sphere-point to bogus or exaggerated examples of minority racism or criminality which have little more effect on them than a piece of lint they brush off their shoulders. Haggis, of course, isn't the only filmmaker to seek to assuage white guilt by making bogus comparisons. In ""American X"" the neo-Nazis kill a couple of black gang members; but the reality is that white-supremacists are too cowardly to risk themselves in inner-city neighborhoods-their victims tend to be those who are most vulnerable, like James Byrd who walking alone and inebriated was tied to a pick-up truck by a couple of goons in Jasper, Texas, and dragged until his head was decapitated.This film has no value as a statement on the state of our society, since it does not allow us to judge in context.

At times felt saddened, but never felt abandoned. If Haggis was preaching, it wasn't brimstone and hellfire, and it wasn't to the choir. It was more like a modern book of ""Revelations,"" and either you get it or you don't!Painful, yes, but almost always poignant and often surprisingly funny, Haggis makes certain no one escapes his magnifying glass. At times the malevolence that spews from the lips of Sandra Bullock (The DAs wife) or Shaun Toub (The Persian shop owner) is brutal and exceedingly uncomfortable. But for Haggis it's like a detox program on the road to recovery.The tapestry is woven with purpose and coincidence that may preach and pound but it never hems or haws or equivocates. It's the kind of film that tries to prove that an audience 'can handle the truth' (sorry Jack!).L.A. is a cultural melting pot and serves perfectly as an authentic backdrop for the movie's message and tone.

920611,AIFNOZKR9WTYI,B000A3XY5A,"mark twain ""25354""","[9, 13]","See, in the crazed mind of the out-of-control, held-together-with-string, neurotic liberal, the entire world is foaming at the mouth with racist diatribes.  People in LA are constantly spouting racist hate words at each other.  This is simply not reality.  This is the wierd core liberal fantasy - that we all racistly hate eachother allatime and just want to get down to some serious helter-skelter straightaway.  This fantasy is so compelling for the liberal that one cannot help but see it as a crude wish fulfillment: this is the way Haggis thinks, so he thinks that everybody thinks the same way.  And, to dramatize this, he comes up with completely implausible scenarios, like the one where the ""Persian"" (NOT ARAB, MIND YOU!) store owner's store is vandalized by hate-mongers who spray-paint ""raghead"" all over the place and generally wreck the already-unrecognizeable merchandise.  (If anyone can tell me what that store was supposed to be selling, please post!  The merchandise completely heterogenous, generic and nameless.) Now, things like this simply don't really happen in LA, where I am from.  I grew up in LA.  I lived there for about twenty five years.  The place is simply not a racist powderkeg ready to explode.  But, in the mind of Haggis, it is... because most likely Haggis' own mind is just such a powderkeg.Also, Haggis seems to put racist slurs into action within the movie.  There is a scene where a Chinese woman motorist accuses the hispanic (race, race, race!) motorist she rear-ended of ""blaking in middoo of stleet!""  Keep in mind: this is what the character ACTUALLY SAID.  Now, I have several Chinese-born immigrant friends.  And so I think I can say with some assurance that Chinese people do not talk in this stereotyped way.  For the simple reason that in Chinese there IS AN R SOUND!  It is Japanese that lacks the R sound, and instead has a sound similar to the Italian R, using the tip of the tongue.  So, Chinese people do not have trouble with the R sound.  Only racist stereotypes like Haggis' Chinese character do.  You know what the movie reminds me of?  A very special episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, with many different racist characters in the Larry David role.  It could be called Curb Your Foaming Racism.However, the movie does entertain, because one laughs at how bad it really is.  My favorite scene was where Matt Dillon's (great actor, wasted here) cop character, who rather unprofessionally felt up a black woman in a previous scene, encounters the same black woman trapped in a car that is just about to burst into flames, as all cars do in Hollywood.  He begins to try to free her, but when she sees who he is she freaks, screaming, ""Don't touch me!"".  He then explains that he must touch her in order to save her from a fiery death.  She grudgingly assents.  Then follows a scene where he is inadvertently gropinng her in the process of freeing her from her seatbelt.  Sheer hilarity.  It would have been all the better if he was saying things like, ""Ma'am, I'm gonna have to stick my thumb up your r*ctum in order to free you.""  ""Uhh, OK""  ""And Ma'am, I'm gonna have to fondle your m@mmaries.  It's all part of the freeing process, you unnerstand.""  ""Uhh, OK I guess...""  I loved it.",1,You embarass me.

920619,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000A3XY5A,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 4]","Crash paints a portrait of how difficult it can be for different groups of people to get along with each other. The casting is perfect and the acting is impeccable; I couldn't ask for better cinematography and the choreography is excellent, too. The musical score enhances the picture as well. On the other hand, however, some have said that the character development isn't the best; and I agree with that. Actually, there's not *too* much here that wouldn't have been shown on ""All in the Family"" back in the 1970s--with the most notable exception of some very bad words, especially for black and Asian people. In addition, because of a gut feeling I had after watching the movie, there's some doubt in my mind that it truly deserved to win the Oscar for Best Picture.As I mentioned above, we see the trouble people can have when they are prejudiced against other groups of people. Crash deals head-on with racism in a very frank way, which admittedly is something that Hollywood doesn't always do. We get great performances, too. We see the tension between an African-American couple, TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton); the pressure overflows when they are stopped by racist cop John Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his partner Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) who is far more tolerant of diversity. There's more trouble when two thieves Anthony (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate), who is also the younger brother of a police detective, steal the car of Los Angeles' District Attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his very spoiled wife Jean (Sandra Bullock).But there's even more. There's the everyday struggle of black police detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) who, in addition to some nasty office politics, must deal with a drug addicted, ailing mother and a brother (Peter) who is one of the thieves who stole the District Attorney's car. We also see tensions between the members of a family of working class Persians who lose everything they have when their store is robbed and ransacked; the locksmith (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) had told them to fix the door but they didn't and consequently their insurance company won't pay them anything for their losses. There's plenty of trouble when Anthony and Peter accidentally run over an Asian man while driving the stolen car; he is still barely alive and they simply dump the poor man off in front of a hospital emergency room before speeding away in the stolen vehicle. A detective shoots another detective under some very sketchy and somewhat mysterious circumstances; and we see how the white District Attorney struggles to find a black man to fill a prominent spot to please the African-American community.You might think I gave it all away; but please trust me--I didn't. There's still plenty more for you to discover and appreciate about this movie. I certainly didn't tell you how any of these problematic situations work out--sorry, no spoilers! There are some very nice extras, too. We get a behind the scenes featurette; an optional running commentary with writer/producer/director Paul Haggis, writer/producer Bobby Moresco and actor/producer Don Cheadle. There's a music video, optional Spanish subtitles and other trailers, too.Crash may not have been the most daring film to deal head-on with racism; but it's far from weak and I wouldn't simply walk away from this. I recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie. In addition, people who like films that blend biting social commentary with action, a bedroom scene or two and a modicum of violence will want to add this to their collections.",4,very good--but just not quite enough to be a masterpiece,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,3620,"['Crash', 'portrait', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'different', 'groups', 'people', 'get', 'along', 'other', 'casting', 'perfect', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'excellent', 'too', 'musical', 'score', 'picture', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'have', 'said', 'character', 'development', ""n't"", 'best', 'agree', 'Actually', 'not', '*too*', 'much', 'here', 'that', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'Family', 'back', '1970s', 'most', 'notable', 'exception', 'very', 'bad', 'words', 'especially', 'black', 'Asian', 'people', 'addition', 'gut', 'feeling', 'had', 'watching', 'movie', 'doubt', 'mind', 'truly', 'deserved', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture.As', 'mentioned', 'above', 'see', 'trouble', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'when', 'are', 'prejudiced', 'other', 'groups', 'people', 'Crash', 'deals', 'head-on', 'racism', 'very', 'frank', 'way', 'admittedly', 'something', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', 'get', 'great', 'performances', 'too', 'see', 'tension', 'African-American', 'couple', 'TV', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Thayer', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'wife', 'Christine', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'pressure', 'when', 'are', 'stopped', 'racist', 'cop', 'John', 'Ryan', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'partner', 'Tom', 'Hansen', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'tolerant', 'diversity', 'more', 'trouble', 'when', 'two', 'thieves', 'Anthony', 'Chris', ""'Ludacris"", 'Bridges', 'Peter', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'who', 'also', 'younger', 'brother', 'police', 'detective', 'steal', 'car', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Rick', 'Cabot', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'very', 'spoiled', 'wife', 'Jean', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '.But', 'even', 'more', 'everyday', 'struggle', 'black', 'police', 'detective', 'Graham', 'Waters', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'addition', 'nasty', 'office', 'politics', 'must', 'deal', 'drug', 'addicted', 'ailing', 'mother', 'brother', 'Peter', 'who', 'one', 'thieves', 'who', 'stole', 'District', 'Attorney', 'car', 'also', 'see', 'tensions', 'members', 'family', 'working', 'class', 'Persians', 'who', 'lose', 'everything', 'have', 'when', 'store', 'robbed', 'ransacked', 'locksmith', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'had', 'told', 'fix', 'door', 'did', ""n't"", 'consequently', 'insurance', 'company', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pay', 'anything', 'losses', 'plenty', 'trouble', 'when', 'Anthony', 'Peter', 'accidentally', 'run', 'over', 'Asian', 'man', 'driving', 'stolen', 'car', 'still', 'barely', 'alive', 'simply', 'dump', 'poor', 'man', 'front', 'hospital', 'emergency', 'room', 'speeding', 'away', 'stolen', 'vehicle', 'detective', 'shoots', 'detective', 'very', 'sketchy', 'somewhat', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'see', 'how', 'white', 'District', 'Attorney', 'find', 'black', 'man', 'fill', 'prominent', 'spot', 'please', 'African-American', 'community.You', 'might', 'think', 'gave', 'away', 'please', 'trust', 'did', ""n't"", 'still', 'plenty', 'more', 'discover', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'problematic', 'situations', 'work', 'out', 'sorry', 'spoilers', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'extras', 'too', 'get', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'writer/producer/director', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'writer/producer', 'Bobby', 'Moresco', 'actor/producer', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'music', 'video', 'optional', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'other', 'trailers', 'too.Crash', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'daring', 'film', 'deal', 'head-on', 'racism', 'far', 'weak', 'would', ""n't"", 'simply', 'walk', 'away', 'recommend', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'films', 'blend', 'biting', 'social', 'commentary', 'action', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'two', 'modicum', 'violence', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'collections']",Crash

In many ways, despite the fact that it deals with themes of racism, power, and violence, it seems like the film was plotted by a 10 year-old with no grasp of reality, or interpersonal relationships, or an understanding that things and people are not always black and white (pardon the pun).  There are a few too many one-dimensional stereotypes and ludicrous coincidences for me to take any of this seriously, and supposedly life-altering revelations were just absurd.  Parts of the film are exciting and suspenseful but overall I thought it was a little condescending.However, much has been said about the acting in this film.  Matt Dillon was amazing, with the only character in the movie you couldn't sum up in five words.  Larenz Tate is wonderful, as usual, both funny and menacing, and Brendan Fraser was horribly miscast as the ambitious politician.  The real revelations are Terence Howard and Thandie Newton, who along with Dillon gave aching performances that did not feel manipulative or cliched.",3,Not as bad or as good as people say,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1052,"['Crash', 'bit', 'too', 'simplistic', 'taste', 'many', 'ways', 'fact', 'themes', 'racism', 'power', 'violence', 'film', 'was', 'plotted', '10', 'year-old', 'grasp', 'reality', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'understanding', 'things', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'black', 'white', 'pardon', 'pun', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'one-dimensional', 'stereotypes', 'ludicrous', 'coincidences', 'take', 'seriously', 'supposedly', 'life-altering', 'revelations', 'were', 'just', 'absurd', 'Parts', 'film', 'are', 'exciting', 'suspenseful', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'condescending.However', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'acting', 'film', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'was', 'amazing', 'only', 'character', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'sum', 'up', 'five', 'words', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'wonderful', 'usual', 'funny', 'menacing', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'was', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'ambitious', 'politician', 'real', 'revelations', 'are', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'who', 'Dillon', 'gave', 'aching', 'performances', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'manipulative', 'cliched']",Crash
920625,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,B000A3XY5A,Medusa,"[4, 6]","Apparently, I like others was skeptical about watching the movie Crash, because I had heard that it was a movie about prejudice and how it impacts the lives of those that are the target of prejudice.  Certainly the knowledge that prejudice is bad and has a huge impact on its targets should not be new to any of us that consider ourselves human.  My suspicions about how viewers perceived this movie was confirmed by a quick scan I did of a number of reviews for Crash published online.  I suspect that as with all things human, especially where emotion is involved, there is more to the story than the obvious lesson that prejudice is bad and we should not allow ourselves to be caught in its grasp.Crash as a movie focuses on a number of events that at first seem unrelated, but are eventually tied together in a neat package.  As we watch these events unfold, we see pernicious, insidious prejudice show its ugly face.  The white police officers stop the black couple and engage in reprehensible actions, because they feel they are entitled since they are white and policemen.  An Iranian immigrant, who is concerned about his security and the security of his family at his store, hires a Hispanic locksmith to fix the lock on his door.  The locksmith tells him that he can fix the lock, but that he really needs a new door.  The man becomes irritated and tells the locksmith to only fix the door and not the lock, which he does.  That night the store owner's store is vandalized in an apparent act of prejudice.  When he discovers the vandalism the next day and the fact that the perpetrators broke in through the door he had just fixed.  He becomes irate at the man who fixed the lock and sets out to punish him. At this point a miraculous event will turn the events around and reveal some hope, while another shocking event will unexpectedly take place to show how easy and disastrous it is to fall in to the trap of stereotyping and prejudging people. These are few examples of set of events that we see in Crash that get woven together.  I could describe others as well, but to do so would be tedious and pointless.Clearly as so many others have written in their reviews this movie is about prejudice and as we all know prejudice is a bad thing; it corrupts our souls and our humanity.  Why then make yet another movie about prejudice?  To take that position is, I think, to have fallen squarely into the trap laid by the director of Crash. Those who have formed their own prejudices about the movie based on what they think it is telling us, have missed the fundamental point; that prejudice can creep into us even when we think we are not prejudice.

Like Love Actually, it's a film watched best in two parts - cos I severely started to lose track of all the characters after a while.My main problem with Crash was the characters. Yes there were too many separate storylines, but the characters were nothing but stereotypes. The rookie cop, the posh upperclass couple, the guys thinking they were hard, the cop who thinks he's above everyone else. It's been done before, and better. The length was another thing. I can sit through Titanic quite happily, but this I was yawning, and clock watching. Not the best way to spend a Christmas night.Brendan Fraser & Sandra Bullock (the posh couple) seemed totally separated from the rest of the characters. They could have easily been cut out and not made the slightest difference to the film. They only had a handful of lines between them and they really didn't click.To be honest, I'm caught in the middle with Crash.

At first I wasn't sure I wanted to watch it because the title made me think of drug usage and I hate watching that kind of movie.

This film received two thumbs up from Ebert and Roeper. It is an urban thriller and you really aren't sure where it is going as you watch it. There are several lives that intersect. The movie is about prejudices and how we all have them.About 15 minutes in there is a scene between Matt Dillon and a person he pulls over (he is a cop), his treatment of her had me ready to leave the room, but I stuck it out and I am glad I did. Each of these people had good and bad points about them. They were humans and ultimately, it was that fact that won me over. We all screw up, we all do, think and say things that are politically incorrect, but ultimately, we have the deire to do good and treat others well.

Newman,"[3, 18]","With the success of such films as Pulp Fiction and Sin City there seems to be a new style of telling a story where there are separate tales intertwined with characters crossing over between the tales.  This film takes it a step further and seems to be like a soap opera with several plots happening at the same time with characters constantly crossing over between the plots.  The director performs a masterful job of this and creates an excellent tale of many separate lives that reach a crossroad and expose their inner soul and then their outlook on life totally changes.Don Cheadle seems to have the biggest part as a homicide detective that devotes all his time and effort to his work and his romance with his female partner and not enough time with his mother and troubled brother.  Matt Dillon is a hardened LA cop who has a sour attitude toward black people while trying to cope with taking care of his mysteriously ill father.  Rapper Ludicrous is a hood who blames the whites for everything while car jacking.  Then there is a Persian shopkeeper who thinks everyone in the world is out to get him and needs to have a gun so he can get at anyone who pisses him off.  There is a heart-warming tale of a locksmith who moved his family out of a poor neighborhood because a gunshot had come through his daughter's window.  There is Sandra Bullock's character who is a wealthy housewife who is mad at the world and married to the DA who is worried that everything that brings bad PR will hurt his chance at re-election.  Lastly, there is the black director who seems to forget his ethnic heritage because he is a successful movie director.Each one of these people could have an interesting movie about themselves but over the course of two days their lives intertwine while their stories remain separate.  One can easily see how this movie could win best picture without any one actor nominated for the top awards as there is no star but just a movie of supporting stars.

It is a strong ensemble cast's dream, ranging from the likes of Brendan Fraser to Don Cheadle.  The fragmented storyline focuses heavily on racial preconceptions and prejudices, ultimately saying that it is the person within rather than the race they have been assigned that is the important part.  Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock play a district attorney and his wife whose vehicle is carjacked by Ludikris and Larenz Tate, two homeys whose preconceptions of what people think aren't too far off the target; Don Cheadle plays a cop whose younger brother has turned to a life of crime, and who finds himself involved with a Latino played by Jennifer Esposito.  Matt Dillon in one of the film's strongest performances plays a prejudiced cop who takes out his prejudices on a tv director and his wife (convincingly performed by Terence Howard and Thandie Newton) and on the HMO rep who refuses to okay further medical help for Dillon's dad.  Loretta Devine plays this character with sharp verve and although she isn't on screen a lot, she dominates when she is.  Ryan Phillippe turns in a strong nod as Dillon's partner who doesn't approve of his prejudices but finds the shoe on the other foot late in the film.

It's a movie that you might want to watch again as soon as you've finished it, simply because it's so rich and deep that you won't want to miss anything.  That's a kind way of saying that it's a complicated story that should be watched attentively.The movie deals with a 36 hour period of time in Los Angeles.  During that time you'll encounter racist cops, car jackers, cynical politicians, road rage drivers, slave traders, paranoid shop owners, unfeeling bureaucrats and a more racially diverse cast than any five other movies you might see.  Characters come and go, crossing paths, interacting with each other in various combinations; with many of them slipping from victim to villain to hero depending upon which situation they're in.In the ensemble cast, Don Cheadle stands out with a performance that is even better than the one he gave in Hotel Rwanda.  Thandie Newton is also impressive (as she usually is).  Other actors with less distinguished bodies of work (like Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza and Sandra Bulloch) should rank this film at the tops of their accomplishment.Other actors deserve mention as well, Ludacris, Larenz Tate, Bahar Soomekh, Tony Danza, Loretta Devine and Michael Pena all excel in minor roles that remain memorable in far greater portion to the time that they are given on the screen.  Clearly they all took their roles seriously.Earlier this year, when Oprah Winfrey encountered some apparent bias in Paris, she described it as her ""Crash moment"", that point when someone is judged solely by the color of their skin, their origin, their dress or other minor detail.  It's an apt metaphor as Crash will have you mentally reviewing your first impression of virtually every character in the film at one time or another.  It's a mobius strip of prejudice as blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, Persians and other ethnic groups foist their own biases and agendas on each other.

I agree with many reviewers that racial issues are still very much a part of our society. However, this movie makes the issue so one-dimensional and obvious that it sickens me to watch it. Another reviewer mentioned the film ""American History X"". Now that's a film about racial tension! Another great film on the issue is ""Gran Torino"". These films are subtle with rich characters and stories that carry a deep, underlying message. ""Crash"" pales in comparison and comes across as an employee training video on how NOT to be politically correct. The reason certain reviewers are so upset about this film is 1.) It was horrible and 2.) It managed to win Best Picture when other films like ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Walk The Line"" got shafted. I believe, as many others do, that ""Crash"" won by default because ""Brokeback Mountain"" turned off some of the homophobic members of the Academy and those members didn't bother to watch it. If they had, they would have realized that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is by far the superior picture. ""Crash"" is a lame movie compared to ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Walk The Line"", Good Night, and Good Luck"", ""Cinderella Man"", or any other movie that came out that year.

As I watched the film I kept thinking it was going to dissolve into sweet sentimental, ""Gosh-how-awful-we-are-as-a-human-race.""  ""Why-can't-we-all-just-love-each-other-and-get along"" and ""We-shouldn't-judge-each-other"" and although it may appear to approach that line it never crosses it.  With all the many blatant abuses of people in ""positions of power"" in this movie it make you mad as an audience member.Kudos to director Paul Haggis for taking on the risks so rarely tried in today's tired cinematic world and pulling it all off beautifully.

We have Chinese, blacks, hispanic, whites and Middle Eastern types, many angry, some afraid of being mugged or killed or robbed, some waiting for another gunshot to come through the wall of their home. Behind all this emotional turmoil is race. There is the cop who abuses blacks because of affirmative action, the thug who car jacks whites only because of perceived white prejudice toward blacks, the Persian shopkeeper who hates hispanics because his store is burgled. And there are Chinese angry at whites for some unknown reason. At some point you feel like Rodney King and want to shout, ""Why can't we all just get along?"" CRASH implies that this is the way LA is and, by extension, the rest of the US. CRASH also seems to provide excuses for all this hate and criminal activity, the primary excuse being the effects of society on people. In other words, people have no individual responsibility; the devil (society) made them do it. I say bull dookie to this thesis. A cop should control his emotions and car jackers are thugs, not oppressed minorities, and America is NOT like this movie. The screenplay allows almost every character to perform an act of redemptive kindness or courage and that makes some characters more human or likeable but only adds to the film's overall shroud of moral ambiguity. Now that we have dealt with the film's political message, let's look at the film as art. I found CRASH to be well-made and entertaining, the acting quite good and the script tight and suspenseful with authentic-sounding dialogue. Matt Dillion, Sandra Bullock and other excellent actors flesh out this effort directed by Paul Haggis. I wouldn't recommend this as a date flick because it is a bit of a downer.

920642,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000A3XY5A,Michael Zuffa,"[1, 2]","Early on in ""Crash"", Don Cheadle's character makes an observation that people crash into each other just to feel something.  He is talking about a car accident, but the deeper meaning is that we crash into each other as individuals.  ""Crash"" is a chronicle of those instances.  The film weaves a number of different story lines featuring characters of different races, religions, and wealth together in unexpected ways.  You have the opportunity to make a first impression of every character, only to find out later that that impression was completely wrong.A big name cast makes this a movie that many will see.  If the cast contained more lesser-known actors, it still would have been as good, but would probably disappear quickly.  First time director Paul Haggis provides the screenplay (he wrote the screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby"" as well) to a finely crafted film that makes you think without being too preachy, a common downfall of movies with this subject matter.The cast is excellent all around.  The script is great, providing serious drama as well as some genuine laughs, with revelations about the characters peppered throughout the film.

There are a bunch of stories all seperated in this movie but Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda) who plays the Detective ties all the stories together when he finds a dead body on the road and we learn at the end of the movie that it was Cheadle's brother that he found.Cheadle has his own issues to deal with like his brother, mother and he also is sleeping with his white partner, played by Jennifer Esposito (Spin City) The stories go like this, Brendan Fraser (School Ties) in a good role...its good to see him in another role besides The Mummy role and Sandra Bullock (Speed) who throws Miss Congeniality out the window here, get jacked up in their car by two thugs, played by Larenz Tate (A Man Apart) and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges (Hustle & Flow). Later, Tate and Ludacris run over a Chinese guy, take him to the hospital. Ludacris comes back to the Chinese guys van, steals it and winds up finding out that there are Immigrants in the back of the van. Ludacris does a superb job here...hes really good. At a home, Bullock asks Fraser to have her locks changed and then changed again because of a Mexican man, played by Michael Pena. Pena has a scuffle with A Persian Store Owner, played by Shan Toub and later on Toub comes to find his store was broking into. He immediately thinks of Pena, goes to his place and opens fire while Pena's daughter jumps into his arm but to his surprise the bullet missed...later on we find out they were blanks. Matt Dillon (Drugstore Cowboy), who is absolutly dynamic, has issues with his father because his father cant sit down on the toilet and piss all that well. A black TV director, the superb Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow) and his wife, played by Thandie Newton (TV's E.R.) who gives it all she has here and is terrific,  are stopped after Newton raises her head from Howard's lap, by two white cops, Dillon and a knockout Ryan Phillippe (The Way Of The Gun).Dillon frisks Newton and feels her up as she sees her husban Howard doing nothing to stop him and Phillippe even doesnt do nothing as he watches helplessly. Later, Dillon and Newton encounter each other for a second time in which Newton got into a car accident and Dillon happens to stumble upon her and risk it to try to free her before the vehicle explodes. Phillippe winds up giving car jacker Larenz Tate, who's Cheadle's brother a ride and winds up killing him...hench where the beginning and end mesh together.

Paul Haggis, best known for his screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby,"" exceeds that achievement with his first-ever directorial assignment, based on his own screenplay. ""Crash"" takes the currently popular device of interlocking characters in multiple plot lines to tell a panoramic, consistently compelling story about America's original sin--racism--and how it warps every individual and institution in our society. Some may complain about the proliferation of coincidence in ""Crash,"" but Haggis goes after bigger truths here, transcending mere verisimilitude of plot, and he achieves them. Here in microcosm is all the cruelty and misunderstanding in our society that is borne of racial hostility, as represented in characters of complex, sometimes repellent, but always believable humanity. ""Crash"" is an impassioned and moving plea for racial justice and harmony, but Haggis is wise enough to know that such things won't be achieved easily. The film is superbly acted down to the smallest bit part; the great Don Cheadle, who portrays a beleaguered police detective here, is one of the film's producers, which virtually guarantees great acting throughout. My favorites among the cast were Matt Dillon (giving the finest performance of his career) as a blatantly racist cop with unexpectedly redeeming characteristics; Terrence Howard as a wealthy African-American who gets hassled bigtime by Dillon; Michael Pena as a Latino locksmith who has a fateful run-in with an Iranian convenience store owner; and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Larenz Tate as a pair of bickering carjackers.

920648,AUSATFDSU2INS,B000A3XY5A,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[2, 6]","As terrible as the following statement sounds, racism it's usually the source of awful conflicts, hatred and prejudices. In the city of Los Angeles, this thesis seems to be characteristically true. At least, that's how the 2006 Oscar's winning movie Crash portrays it, written and directed by Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby).Exhibiting diverse segments in the lives of a diverse group of characters along 48 hours, Crash confronts the audience with realistic and intense controversial topics. Latinos, arabs, whites, blacks, koreans, iranians, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the powerless will define their relationships and their behavior through the racism planted in their brains.The collisions to which the movie's title refers are mostly emotional, and through these crashes we end up understanding each one of the characters, their lives and reasons to distrust each other. The wonderful thing about Crash is that we cannot predict any of the decisions these characters will take, because they will be closely linked with the unexpected turns that destiny takes.The final result is a series of parables in which the characters learn from their mistakes and their biased behaviors. The lessons are not subtle, but hard and cruel, because we are all prejudiced by nature, and for being like that, we usually pay a very high price.The most important thing is to discover that hope is not completely lost; and in Crash's case, the characters learn something positive about themselves. And it's in that discovery where lies the wonderful possibility to decide to live a more fair and optimistic life.

920650,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000A3XY5A,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Crash"" is a collection of scenes from 2 days in the lives of a group of Los Angelinos who are directly or indirectly connected to one another by chance. The action of the scenes revolve around racial attitudes and racial politics in the multi-ethnic city. ""Crash"" essentially explores two themes: One is the effect that strangers have on one another. The other is the consequences of racial conceptions and racial politics. The film doesn't seem to be about ""racism"" per se. Some characters may be ""racist""; others stereotype according to experience; some act out of anger, others out of ambition. It is more about the consequences of preoccupation with race, regardless of whether racial preconceptions are accurate or not. The characters bluntly speak their minds about people of other races and ethnicities, as well as their own. The dialogue sometimes seems too impolitic to be plausible, but ""Crash"" intends to reflect what people think and say in private, not in public.The characters involved in this ensemble drama are: District Attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), whose car is stolen by 2 young black men. The men are Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate). Police detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are investigating a case of a white police officer shooting a black officer, while both were off duty. An affluent black couple, Cameron and Christine (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) are harassed by an apparently bigoted cop, Officer Ryan (Matt Dillan), and his unwitting partner Tommy (Ryan Phillippe). An Iranian shopkeeper (Shaun Toub) and his Americanized daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh) disagree about keeping a gun after the family store is repeatedly vandalized. Their locksmith (Michael Pena) has no end of accusations tossed his way because he's Hispanic.Once you get past the nearly 3-minute opening credit sequence, ""Crash"" moves at a reasonable pace. The early scenes of the Cabots, the carjackers, and the Iranian family made me wonder if this was going to be a film about a bunch of highly strung people arguing about nothing, but as the film progresses, we begin to understand the characters, and they become more complex than was first obvious. ""Crash"" is not preachy, not ""liberal"", nor ""conservative"". The scenarios are nothing that anyone living in a multi-ethnic urban environment wouldn't be familiar with. The film is to some degree sympathetic to everyone, in that it is willing to take each character's point of view for a while, but it is also critical of everyone. ""Crash"" doesn't offer solutions to American's racial issues, but it presents them frankly. It is not so nave as to deny the truths of stereotypes, or to deny their perils. Good deeds don't always turn out well; bad behavior doesn't always turn out badly. Sometimes people are too quick to judge others, while some aren't quick enough. Writer/director Paul Haggis embraces both the comedy and the tragedy in this complicated heterogeneous tableau. If ""Crash"" condemns anything, I think it is racial politics, which consistently foster unethical behavior and produce bad results all around. But whatever conclusion you draw, ""Crash"" is a kind of abstract of the American melting pot's more volatile ingredients.The DVD (Lions Gate 2005): Bonus features include an introduction to the film, a look behind the scenes, a music video, some trailers, and an audio commentary. The ""DVD Introduction by writer/producer/director Paul Haggis"" (15 seconds) is very brief. Skip it. ""Behind the Scenes"" (10 minutes) includes interviews with the director, writer Bobby Moresco, producer Cathy Shulman, and members of the cast, in which they talk about the film's intentions.

920651,A1CLU5FAU0YXPH,B000A3XY5A,"miseryhatescompany ""so buzz off""","[5, 10]","Question: why does this movie still have a 3 and 1/2 star average? Its should have the same rating that Batman and Robin, The Black Dahlia and Eye Of The Beholder rightfully earned. If you can stop believing in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, then why cant you see this movie is the worst movie on racism ever produced? Old habits die hard I guess. For the record I'm not some inbred hick that hates any movie that deals with racism. I respect every movie that dealt with racism prior to this movie.Crash received all its hype because the Academy Awards did not want to see Brokeback Mountain. There I said it. Its no secret that the Academy Awards are paid bandwagoneers. If there is money involved they will oversell any movie to death. If you recognize that fact and still give them the benefit of the doubt then you need to get your head checked.Crash plays like a glorified, PC to the extreme, TV movie on race. The main thing that made better movies on race relations in the past great is that the characters in them are realistic. Look at Mississippi Burning and American History X. Are the people in those movies realistic? Yes. Now look at Crash. Are the people in Crash realistic? Of course not. These people talk about race 100% of the time. I'm sorry but even the most of hardcore racist will not talk about race 100% of the time nor would they do the stupid things that the people in this movie do.With the exception of Ryan Phillipe, Terrence Howard and Michael Pena, the performances were laughable and weak. Matt Dillon should have been perfect as the racist cop John Ryan but to say he was unbelievable is putting it nicely. When he groped Thandie Newton's butt in a traffic stop I had to hold back laughter. I was waiting for her to fart just to give this scene the hilarity it deserves. Did the writers think that was supposed to be an effective scene? Please. Show him zapping her with a taser gun or beating her down and then you would have a more accurate description of what a racist cop would do and a more effective scene. Sandra Bullock was equally unbelievable in her role. I laughed my a** off when she fell down those flights of stairs.Ludacris's character fails big time because we all know he has no depth to his character. Just listen to his albums. Larenz Tate is slumming in his performance and Don Cheadle phones it in. The writing stinks too because as I said earlier the people are unrealistic as well as the situations they are in. I cant believe for one second that John Ryan would rescue Christine from a car accident after he fondled her buttocks in front of her husband and neither should you.The thing that sad the most about Crash is that after its done you are left wondering what the hell you just watched. The best movies on race leave the viewer with something they never forget. This movie leaves you with nothing but unintentional humor. There are better movies out there that deserve praise and get none. Why are people still praising this dud?Better movies on racism: Magnolia, America History X, Do The Right Thing, Bamboozled, and Mississippi Burning.

The movie goes way beyond what has previously been shown on TV and in movies as to matters of race and culture. It has been said that there are 2 America's- one white and one black. This movie rightfully shows how outdated that thinking is. CRASH shows that there are many America's. America's where there are people that look like Arabs but are not. Where a white person appears racist but is not. Where black, brown and white people can and do put aside there differences for the common sport of riduculing the speech impediments of Chinese immigrants. There are many perspectives offered in this movie and all are equally valid.When I was a teenager my Mother was viscously robbed by black men while at work. So I can empathsize (but not agree with) the affluent person who in the aftermath of the crime initially vents her anger by blaming innocent persons of the same ethnicity as her attackers. I have seen how my own wife, a person of color herself, was overlooked for a well deserved promotion because the company wanted a less experienced but white male face in the predominately female department she worked in. Was it because of race or gender? These are important questions with no easy answers. This film is complex (and enjoyable) because it gives equal weight to the many different opinions on race and culture.It would have been easy to have the characters who demonstrate some form of prejudice to be throughly contemptible persons. But this would have been far to convenient. The script takes the time for moviegoers to learn about their issues. We see the troubled police detective, the affluent wife of a big shot attorney, 2 common carjackers, a young police officer who believes he can stay above it all, a man who is continually mistaken for an Arab, the troubled wife of a televison producer. It shows each of their ordeals from a fresh perspective. Their ordeals, although experienced seperately, inevitably intersect with one another. Crash does not claim to have all the answers but it does pose good questions as to how we perceive each other in a multi-racial, multi-cultural America.",4,This film shows that there are many America's,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,2178,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'deserving', 'best', 'picture', 'academy', 'award', 'movie', 'way', 'what', 'previously', 'been', 'shown', 'TV', 'movies', 'matters', 'race', 'culture', 'been', 'said', 'are', '2', ""America's-"", 'one', 'white', 'one', 'black', 'movie', 'rightfully', 'how', 'outdated', 'thinking', 'CRASH', 'are', 'many', 'America', 'America', 'where', 'are', 'people', 'look', 'Arabs', 'are', 'not', 'Where', 'white', 'person', 'racist', 'not', 'Where', 'black', 'brown', 'white', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'common', 'sport', 'riduculing', 'speech', 'impediments', 'Chinese', 'immigrants', 'are', 'many', 'perspectives', 'offered', 'movie', 'are', 'equally', 'valid.When', 'was', 'teenager', 'Mother', 'was', 'viscously', 'robbed', 'black', 'men', 'work', 'can', 'empathsize', 'not', 'agree', 'affluent', 'person', 'who', 'aftermath', 'crime', 'initially', 'anger', 'blaming', 'innocent', 'persons', 'same', 'ethnicity', 'attackers', 'have', 'seen', 'how', 'own', 'wife', 'person', 'color', 'was', 'overlooked', 'well', 'deserved', 'promotion', 'company', 'wanted', 'less', 'experienced', 'white', 'male', 'face', 'predominately', 'female', 'department', 'worked', 'Was', 'race', 'gender', 'are', 'important', 'questions', 'easy', 'answers', 'film', 'complex', 'enjoyable', 'equal', 'weight', 'many', 'different', 'opinions', 'race', 'culture.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'have', 'characters', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'form', 'prejudice', 'be', 'throughly', 'contemptible', 'persons', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'convenient', 'script', 'time', 'moviegoers', 'learn', 'issues', 'see', 'troubled', 'police', 'detective', 'affluent', 'wife', 'big', 'shot', 'attorney', '2', 'common', 'carjackers', 'young', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'can', 'stay', 'man', 'who', 'continually', 'mistaken', 'Arab', 'troubled', 'wife', 'televison', 'producer', 'ordeals', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'ordeals', 'experienced', 'seperately', 'inevitably', 'intersect', 'one', 'Crash', 'not', 'claim', 'have', 'answers', 'pose', 'good', 'questions', 'how', 'perceive', 'other', 'multi-racial', 'multi-cultural', 'America']",Crash
920654,A3NCIN6TNL0MGA,B000A3XY5A,"M. JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[6, 13]","I heard a lot of great buzz about Crash before it was released in the theaters. Here, we were told, was a smart film about racial and ethnic prejudice where the writer/director turns every stereotype on its head and refuses to cater to our expectations. Sounded like my type of film. So finally I bought the DVD and have to say, sadly, that the ambitious theme of a diverse urban group of characters, loosely connected and only slightly developed, showing their small-minded prejudices, biases, and ignorance, looks more like an essay than it does a film. A couple of thug car-jackers lament racism while they brutalize human beings. A white rich woman condescends to her Latina maid and doesn't trust the Latino locksmith. An African-American cop talks racist trash to his Latina girlfriend, making her a stereotype. A white gun salesman accuses a Persian family of being terrorists. A black husband argues with his black wife whom he accuses comes from a family of too much privilege to understand his pain. A white cop hates an HMO supervisor, a black lady, whom he accuses of reaching her position through affirmative action. And on and on. This is really not a film but an essay about tribalism, the reflex to allow fear to rule our intellect. But as a film, the drama consists of watching people hurt each other over and over, relentlessly, usually pointlessly. Worse, the heavy-handed soundtrack, full of tearful laments and wails, tells us to be sad, as if we weren't intelligent enough to know that people hurting and killing each other because of their ignorance and frustration is indeed sad. So in the absence of a real film, here's what you get: Lots of made-for-TV melodrama, descending into bathos. Raw hatred. People screaming at each other. Bombastic, quasi-religious music telling you what sad emotions you should be coddling. Lots of guns. Chase scenes. People spewing racist venom. Sentimentality. Here's what you don't get: A believable plot. Nuanced characters.Needless to say, I was gravely disappointed. If you want to watch a better urban film that cuts back and forth between many diverse characters, watch Robert Altman's masterpiece Short Cuts. For a much better film about urban racism, watch Falling Down starring Michael Douglas.",2,"Ambitious Themes, Failed Execution",1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2260,"['heard', 'lot', 'great', 'buzz', 'Crash', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'Here', 'were', 'told', 'was', 'smart', 'film', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'prejudice', 'where', 'writer/director', 'stereotype', 'head', 'cater', 'expectations', 'Sounded', 'type', 'film', 'finally', 'bought', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', 'sadly', 'ambitious', 'theme', 'diverse', 'urban', 'group', 'characters', 'loosely', 'connected', 'only', 'slightly', 'developed', 'showing', 'small-minded', 'prejudices', 'biases', 'ignorance', 'more', 'essay', 'film', 'couple', 'thug', 'car-jackers', 'lament', 'racism', 'brutalize', 'human', 'beings', 'A', 'white', 'rich', 'woman', 'Latina', 'maid', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Latino', 'locksmith', 'African-American', 'cop', 'talks', 'racist', 'trash', 'Latina', 'girlfriend', 'making', 'stereotype', 'white', 'gun', 'salesman', 'Persian', 'family', 'being', 'terrorists', 'black', 'husband', 'black', 'wife', 'whom', 'family', 'too', 'much', 'privilege', 'understand', 'pain', 'white', 'cop', 'HMO', 'supervisor', 'black', 'lady', 'whom', 'reaching', 'position', 'affirmative', 'action', 'really', 'not', 'film', 'essay', 'tribalism', 'reflex', 'allow', 'fear', 'rule', 'intellect', 'film', 'drama', 'watching', 'people', 'hurt', 'other', 'relentlessly', 'usually', 'pointlessly', 'Worse', 'heavy-handed', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'tearful', 'laments', 'wails', 'be', 'sad', 'were', ""n't"", 'intelligent', 'enough', 'know', 'people', 'hurting', 'killing', 'other', 'ignorance', 'frustration', 'indeed', 'sad', 'So', 'absence', 'real', 'film', 'here', 'what', 'get', 'Lots', 'made-for-TV', 'melodrama', 'descending', 'bathos', 'Raw', 'hatred', 'People', 'screaming', 'other', 'Bombastic', 'quasi-religious', 'music', 'telling', 'what', 'sad', 'emotions', 'should', 'be', 'coddling', 'Lots', 'guns', 'Chase', 'People', 'spewing', 'racist', 'venom', 'Sentimentality', 'Here', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'believable', 'plot', 'Nuanced', 'characters.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'gravely', 'disappointed', 'want', 'watch', 'better', 'urban', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'many', 'diverse', 'characters', 'watch', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'masterpiece', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'urban', 'racism', 'watch', 'Falling', 'Down', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Douglas']",Crash

The huge ensemble cast is flawless; everybody simply nails their part.There are the expected stunners, like Don Cheadle, and the ones that blow you away, like the brittle harpy Sandra Bullock. First scene with her, and you realize you're not in Kansas anymore. I could list all the great actors here, some of them doing their career bests, but you can get that from the box cover...trust me, each and every one is a gem. Freakin' Ludacris? Who knew?There are about eight or nine plot threads, which are tightly woven throughout the two hour running time (108 minutes plus a lot of credits...). A few contrived plot twists are necessary to bring certain circles to a close, but the story telling is very very good. It's not that you don't notice, you just don't care.The direction is elegant, the cinematography crisp.So technically, you should understand this is a fine film. What elevates it into that rarified air of greatness is the manner in which it handles an unquestionably volatile subject. If you know anything about people, much of what you will hear here is frighteningly accurate. You may think you do not have an ounce of racism or prejudice within you, but when seeing and hearing all the different ways it is manifest in our daily lives (as shown here), I think the average person will change the way they look at race relations after seeing this one film.So much of racism is about blame. This movie goes deeper. And it goes across every major ethnic group, neither glorifying nor condemning each one. It shows good people misinformed or poorly educated, and it shows bad people who manage to find hope and understanding.It's not clean, it's not tidy. It's ugly and intense. Many of the scenes have a visceral jolt I haven't felt in quite a while. The characters are so sharply drawn that the melodramatic incidents carry quite a bit of power.This is one of those movies you will tell every one you know about; you'll tell them they have to see it...",5,An early contender for the Best Picture Oscar.,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,2190,"['Crash', 'written', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'writer', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'first', 'best', 'movie', 'year.It', 'labyrinthine', 'melodrama', 'taking', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'look', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'modern', 'America', 'huge', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'flawless', 'everybody', 'simply', 'part.There', 'are', 'expected', 'stunners', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'ones', 'blow', 'away', 'brittle', 'harpy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'First', 'scene', 'realize', ""'re"", 'not', 'Kansas', 'anymore', 'could', 'list', 'great', 'actors', 'here', 'doing', 'career', 'bests', 'can', 'get', 'box', 'cover', 'trust', 'one', 'gem', 'Freakin', 'Ludacris', 'Who', 'knew', 'are', 'eight', 'nine', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'tightly', 'woven', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time', '108', 'minutes', 'lot', 'credits', 'few', 'contrived', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'necessary', 'bring', 'certain', 'circles', 'close', 'story', 'telling', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.The', 'direction', 'elegant', 'cinematography', 'crisp.So', 'technically', 'should', 'understand', 'fine', 'film', 'What', 'rarified', 'air', 'greatness', 'manner', 'unquestionably', 'volatile', 'subject', 'know', 'anything', 'people', 'much', 'what', 'will', 'hear', 'here', 'frighteningly', 'accurate', 'may', 'think', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'ounce', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'when', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'different', 'ways', 'manifest', 'daily', 'lives', 'shown', 'here', 'think', 'average', 'person', 'will', 'change', 'way', 'look', 'race', 'relations', 'seeing', 'one', 'film.So', 'much', 'racism', 'blame', 'movie', 'deeper', 'major', 'ethnic', 'group', 'glorifying', 'condemning', 'one', 'good', 'people', 'misinformed', 'poorly', 'educated', 'bad', 'people', 'who', 'manage', 'find', 'hope', 'understanding.It', 'not', 'clean', 'not', 'tidy', 'ugly', 'intense', 'Many', 'scenes', 'have', 'visceral', 'jolt', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'quite', 'while', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'melodramatic', 'incidents', 'carry', 'quite', 'bit', 'power.This', 'one', 'movies', 'will', 'tell', 'one', 'know', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'have', 'see']",Crash
920656,A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C,B000A3XY5A,M. Newton,"[1, 4]","This film has, for the most part, excellent acting and well constructed scenes.  The pace of the storytelling is also excellent.  All in all, there is a lot to like about this film.  The key fault, however, is that this film goes way over the top in trying to make a statement on racism.  According to this film, everyone in LA makes every decision of every day with race being a major consideration.  No one in this film escapes unscathed.  Is LA really that bad?  I'm from Texas and I've never seen racism like that.  I find this level of racism completely unrealistic.  Only race hucksters would have you believe that people still make that many race-based decisions.Also, the film makers appear to be terrified of making any moral judgements.  Every one of these race focused individuals is ultimately shown in a favorable light.  For example, the bigot saves a black woman; the drug dealer frees slaves and gives them cash; the cop who sends an innocent man to prison for life just to help his brother is seen in a compassionate light as he agonizes over his treatment from his mother.  Still, the film survives these weaknesses.Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, and Brendan Fraser give the top performances, but most of the other actors are nearly as good.  The stories are fascinating to watch and the movie really kept my attention.  Although there are several off-scene car accidents, once car chase, and a shooting, this is by no means an action film.

Anyone who says this movie is amazing...must be like the characters in the movie, or know someone like them. Because no one in this movie was an image of me or anyone I know. Every character was completely ignorant and discriminatory to the fullest extent. Everytime I thought there would be a breakthrough in a character's situation, it just got worse and worse. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and furthermore, I couldn't believe people would recommend this movie. There was nothing in this movie that could spark an INTELLIGENT discussion of ethnicity, heritage or class.The African-Americans were portrayed as oversexed, very violent people that couldn't care less about having morals or being culturally educated. I really hated that.Latinos were portrayed as also sexual objects (Don Cheadle's girlfriend), rough, poor, and came from a bad background, a bad neighborhood, a bad rep.Caucasians were the instigators, not necessarily the ""bad guys"" but bad nonetheless. They were intolerant and naive, extremely paranoid and extremely ridiculous in their actions and their explanations for those actions.The token Arabs in this film were actually Persian, which had to be explained. See, when a script involves an explanation for some scenes in which the characters have to tell the audience something they should be able to catch on to, then there is no fluidity to the dialogue and in this case, the entire film.The East Asians weren't given the time of day in ""Crash,"" and I felt bad that they were mostly props or just mere additions to the cast.If the creators of this film planned on being dedicated to showing what real people of varied ethnicities go through on a day to day basis and showing their real personalities and true colors, then they failed immensely.It was a dead-end drama with no ""moral to the story.""

920659,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B000A3XY5A,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[4, 6]","This is a movie everyone needs to see. Not just that I would recommend to everyone, but that every person in America needs to see. Period. I don't think I've ever said that about a film before, but I can't stress it enough with ""Crash"": even if you never go to the theater, if you see only one movie the entire year, see this one. The makers of ""Crash"" clearly have a thorough, nuanced understanding of race and racial conflict, not often seen even in this day and age of increasing racial awareness. Racism in the United States is not gone, but it often works in more subtle and insidious ways than in the past. Subconscious fears and prejudices can rise to the surface in moments of stress and cause conflict even where none was intended, and ""Crash"" explores the way this social dynamic impacts the lives of everyone in a community. It dives into the world of racial conflict like no other film I've seen.""Crash"" takes place in L.A. and opens, appropriately, with the scene of a minor car accident. A Black police officer, Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle), and his Hispanic partner (Jennifer Esposito) have been rear-ended by an hysterical Asian woman. We find out later in the film why she comes so unhinged at this moment, but at the time it is not apparent and as she vents her frustration on the police officers, sparking an exchange of racial slurs. A more ominous tone is cast over the film with the discovery of a young man's dead body in the bushes along the roadside a short while later. From here we are taken back in time to the previous day, from where we see the events leading up to the car crash and the dead boy unfold.One of the most saddening aspects of the film, for me - even more than the overt expressions of racism - was seeing how the process of victimization and humiliation forms a ripple effect, causing additional tension and strife between family members. This can be seen most clearly through the characters played by Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. The black couple is pulled over on the street one evening by a white police officer (Matt Dillon), who proceeds to sexually harass the wife. The husband is torn, knowing that if he protests, the cop will most probably make the situation even worse for them. Yet his wife feels betrayed, seeing her husband simply stand by while she is humiliated. Afterward, rather than being able to comfort each other, as they need, the two find themselves erupting into painful argument with one another. This instance of racism, perpetrated by a stranger external to their life together, threatens to tear their marriage apart. We see tension just as real, though different in tone, between the upper-class white couple Jean and Richard Cabot (Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser), as Jean struggles to deal with the repercussions of her own prejudiced views.I don't mean, however, to give anyone the impression that the movie is entirely depressing. While sobering, it also contains element of hope. We see several characters undergo transformation over the course of the film, as they come to a deeper understanding of the consequences their attitudes and actions have on themselves and those they interact with. Particularly touching is the epiphany experienced by Sergeant Ryan (Matt Dillon), though we also see profound awakenings in the characters played by Sandra Bullock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, and Shaun Toub. In fact, every character undergoes some degree of change, and none are the same at the end of the story as they were at its beginning. The acting all-around in this ensemble cast is superb, making the emotional journeys of its characters that much more accessible to its audience.Another thing that particularly impressed me about the film is its incorporation of characters from a wide variety of racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. We see both professional and working class individuals. We also see characters who are Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, and Middle Eastern. In a society where racial issues are often oversimplified into a basic Black-White dichotomy, ""Crash"" is a refreshing and eye-opening dose of reality. The only major racial category that is completely unrepresented is the Native American community. I was also pleased to see that the film does not resort to the trite conciliatory method of making any one group appear entirely virtuous or entirely corrupt. Within the members of each racial group we see both admirable and reprehensible characters. Indeed, even within the same character there often appear both admirable and reprehensible traits.Though I have countless good things to say about the film, the reality is that one simply has to see it for oneself. It brings with it a much-needed awareness of the dynamics of the American racial milieu. Some other reviewers have argued that the movie makes racism out to be a bigger problem than it actually is, but this is just the type of misconception that ""Crash"" seeks to correct. Race and racism remain a powerful element of today's society. Unfortunately, there are many who do not realize this, and also many well-intentioned individuals who perpetuate the cycle of racism through behaviors that they do not even recognize as discriminatory. ""Crash"" highlights all these issues and dissects the issue of racism in a very clear and moving way. Once again, I urge everyone most strongly to go see this film at the earliest opportunity.",5,A critical and much-needed look at the dynamics of racism.,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,5415,"['movie',

Instead, what I got was a cliched statement of the obvious, conveyed through some of the most forced, unnatural dialogue ever uttered in a movie. Right from the start Crash treats you like an idiot, when in the first minute of the film Don Cheadle explains the title: ""All this metal and glass... nobody ever touches in this city... maybe that's why we crash into each other."" The rest of the movie consists of an endless parade of stereotype characters (rich white b1tch, poor black thug) speaking in monologues that were probably taken from essays about racism written by junior high school students. I mean, the conversations held by Ludacris and some other dude are so ridiculous and phony, it feels like you're watching a bad sitcom.Regardless of the terrible script, worst of all, Crash is just another Hollywood movie that winds up saying nothing by trying to say everything. Here's a summary of what Crash has to say: Racism is bad, we should all be nicer to each other and not judge each other, but yeah um, some stereotypes are based on truth, but you know, not all of them, and like, people are good, but some aren't, and some cops are nice but some are bad, but there's reasons for everything and everyone is sad.Unwatchable.

920663,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,B000A3XY5A,Movie Fan,"[1, 3]","Wow....wow. Finally saw this film. It is not hard to follow at all. People talk too much when they watch movies with friends, and they eat popcorn crunch crunch, and leave to use the restroom (at theatre's), so i do recommend watching any film alone at least once for the first time. This film to me was pretty good. There are three categories that movies fall into, a). alright but not worth seeing twice. b) entertaining somewhat, but after it's over you're say that wasnt that good. and c) you enjoy it, at the end you say wow that was really good probably will watch it again. C is this film to me. What i like most about it, is there are many surprises, and it's not very predictable. It gets intense, and you think something awful is going to happen but something different occurs which suprises you. Also, last but not least, it seemed like the apparent bad people turned out to be good, and the good people turned out to be bad, not everyone but most. It's just like that saying ""sometimes the people you expect to kick you when you're down will be the ones to help you get back up"" And also never judge a book by it's cover. And when i mean intense, by the time this film ended, i was sweating. That is intense. Yeah some of the racist scenes were a little exagerated, but that was on purpose to prove a point. And the dirctors love this kind of order of scenes in films these days. The kind where there are several mini stories, and they all come together towards the end so that it makes more sense, and you find out who's who to everyone. The acting was pretty dam good. I love sandra bullok, and that scene where her maid was helping her with her leg, i thought to myself, see ""she's"" there for you! give her a hug, and she did.

It's really a movie for someone that doesn't live in L.A. or is simply stating the obvious. It's not an ""enlightening"" movie that will change your life forever.  Don't expect it to.Yes, Los Angeles, with its multi-eclectic, multi-ethnic society is bound to have confrontations and animosity. We are after all, a ""stew-pot"" of different cultures and beliefs.  This movie hit on target every experience or desire that I've been confronted with in Los Angeles.  Even the police that have vowed to ""protect"" us can sometimes do more damage than good.  They can damage us physically, psychologically, and mentally.We all have stereotypes and prejudices about each other. If you think this isn't true, have you been to the Museum of Tolerance? Try getting past the door that says ""Pass if You're Not Prejudiced."" You'll notice that you can't get through, no one can. We're all a little racist or prejudiced inside, no matter how open-minded and liberal we are.The movie deals with prejudices with Blacks vs. LAPD, Muslims vs. Terrorism, Rich vs. Poor, and White vs. Black.  Whether you've experienced violence, prejudice, or racism this movie can clearly show you what it is to live in L.A. or modern America if you've never seen it before or it can open your eyes to what's always been in front of you.It's a great movie.  Some stories were more developed than others and others I felt needed to tell me a little bit more.  We have Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe in a story where Dillon is a bigot and a racist.  He hates blacks because of past experiences with them and his actions are shown in the movie. The part was owned and dominated by Loretta Devine; she was great working with Dillon. Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock are the rich people dealing with their own prejudices and the political media.  Bullock realizes that money doesn't buy friendship and sometimes you have to set your differences aside to let people in. By the way, it's refreshing to see Bullock so high-strung and pissed she's great as a bitchy-wife, she's always so sugarcoated, unlike in this movie. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton deal with a negative experience and have to overcome obstacles.  Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito were also great, their characters were well developed and really lead us into the who dun nit mode which, starts off the movie.In reality, there's violence all around us. Even the people that would surprise us are violent even though they may not show it. At any given moment anyone could crack and anything can happen. With the decisions we make every day we could affect the next person and as a result of that action the next person could act as an effect to our first action.

I was surprised when it won Best Picture; also rather surprised that one of my favorite critics loved it, and I'd have to say shocked now that I've actually seen it. I knew I was going to be in trouble pretty quickly, the glossy, burnished artificial lighting and restless camera just didn't seem to belong to the rather intimate story that it seemed (at first) that Haggis was trying to tell.Ah, but what's that? Intimate? LA is the world, Haggis wants us to believe, and the world is racist, hateful and violent. All of it. Without exception. This is what was so noxious about the film to me -- every single character is a collection of hatred, fear, suspicion and suspended violence; and every character (of course) has a moment of redemption, and obvious and simplistic choice of whether to do ""evil"" or ""good."" The cardboard, one-dimensional treatment of the ""people"" here is made even worse by the extraordinary and ridiculous set of coincidences that bring them all together, completely Dickensian in scope but completely underserved and unbelievable, because these are not people but types and cut-outs. Asking me to accept all of this in a two-hour film that never fleshes anyone out beyond skin tone and class, and asking me to accept that this is the world we live in....too much, Mr. Haggis. If I believed that CRASH was the world, I'd have killed myself long ago. It's hard to remember a more cynical film with a worse view of humanity, which wouldn't alone make the film worthless -- it's the simpleminded, heavy-handed psychology behind it all that does that.

Anno,"[4, 15]","Written and directed by Paul Haggis, this Best Picture-winner (an undeserving upset over Ang Lee's terrific Brokeback Mountain, a much more noteworthy allegory of human discrimination) drowns in its belligerent vanity and does so pitilessly, nearly pulling the well-intentioned genre -- self-romantic as it is here -- to the cooker with it. In its defense (a half-serious attempt at reconciliation for those who have mounted it as a ""classic"") it took a couple viewings for me to grow repelled by it -- to be honest, I, like most, was initially swept into acceptance of its audacity by its pinnacle moments -- but, even as soon as the opening frames of my first rehash, the musty stench of its arrogance engulfed me and I was again scooped by the product, this time ashamed at its malice and bewildered by its vindictive nature.Structurally, Crash is a resounding example of unconformity (though its rearranged chronology is an ever-growing theme and its multi-focal yarn is an age-old cliche of priggish cinema, yet not always implemented by films of such). It is likely to become the template by which many subsequent mystery/thrillers are drawn, though that wouldn't be all that bad: it hooks its audience by immediately proposing a problem to which the answer comes together, piece-by-piece, as the story -- which jumps backwards, then proceeds in real-time, ending with its opening scene -- progresses. As we the audience travel alongside the film's event timeline, our attention is maintained thoroughly by its three climaxes, which are evenly distributed within the film's last half. Yet what is unrealized by a majority of viewers is that while their emotions have been forged and manipulated by these peaks, the movie's story -- and more specifically its script (co-penned by Bobby Moresco) -- runs amok in a cesspool of racially-directed propaganda, which is grossly mistaken for morally-motivated and ""necessary"" exposure to the cultural/ethnic differences that set aside and bring hardship to the diverse citizens of America (or, in this particular case, Los Angeles).Crash is a textbook example of exploitation, presented with a slew of disgustingly (and abnormally) xenophobic characters, each of whom spit bigoted slurs as if they were the letters of the alphabet. Simply put, when it tries to address intolerance (which occurs with just about every interaction -- an unfortunate truth), it is smothered rather by its own impudence, which appears more political than it does substantial. In fact, Crash is packed so tight full of asinine stereotypes that, if it exploded into a million pieces, its fragments would have enough false piety in them to supply their own feature-length pictures. The film's self-importance swallows all of its positive qualities (which admittedly are not in short supply and include winning efforts by Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard, and Michael Pena) and amasses to an indigestible cinematic experience without the uplift of conciliatory sensitivity or social spotlighting, which it almost embarrassingly thinks it embodies (and forever will, thanks to its three Oscars and national acclaim).",1,Crash (2005),1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,3147,"['Written', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Best', 'Picture-winner', 'undeserving', 'upset', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'terrific', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'much', 'more', 'noteworthy', 'allegory', 'human', 'discrimination', 'belligerent', 'vanity', 'so', 'pitilessly', 'nearly', 'pulling', 'well-intentioned', 'genre', 'self-romantic', 'here', 'cooker', 'defense', 'half-serious', 'attempt', 'reconciliation', 'who', 'have', 'mounted', 'classic', 'took', 'couple', 'viewings', 'grow', 'repelled', 'be', 'honest', 'most', 'was', 'initially', 'swept', 'acceptance', 'audacity', 'pinnacle', 'moments', 'even', 'as', 'soon', 'opening', 'frames', 'first', 'rehash', 'musty', 'stench', 'arrogance', 'was', 'again', 'scooped', 'product', 'time', 'ashamed', 'malice', 'bewildered', 'vindictive', 'nature.Structurally', 'Crash', 'resounding', 'example', 'unconformity', 'rearranged', 'chronology', 'ever-growing', 'theme', 'multi-focal', 'yarn', 'age-old', 'cliche', 'priggish', 'cinema', 'yet', 'not', 'always', 'implemented', 'films', 'such', 'likely', 'become', 'template', 'many', 'subsequent', 'mystery/thrillers', 'are', 'drawn', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'audience', 'immediately', 'proposing', 'problem', 'answer', 'together', 'piece-by-piece', 'story', 'backwards', 'then', 'proceeds', 'real-time', 'ending', 'opening', 'scene', 'audience', 'travel', 'film', 'event', 'timeline', 'attention', 'maintained', 'thoroughly', 'three', 'climaxes', 'are', 'evenly', 'distributed', 'film', 'last', 'half', 'what', 'unrealized', 'majority', 'viewers', 'emotions', 'have', 'been', 'forged', 'manipulated', 'peaks', 'movie', 'story', 'more', 'specifically', 'script', 'co-penned', 'Bobby', 'Moresco', 'amok', 'cesspool', 'racially-directed', 'propaganda', 'grossly', 'mistaken', 'morally-motivated', 'necessary', 'exposure', 'cultural/ethnic', 'differences', 'set', 'aside', 'bring', 'hardship', 'diverse', 'citizens', 'America', 'particular', 'case', 'Los', 'Angeles', '.Crash', 'textbook', 'example', 'exploitation', 'presented', 'slew', 'disgustingly', 'abnormally', 'xenophobic', 'characters', 'whom', 'spit', 'bigoted', 'slurs', 'were', 'letters', 'alphabet', 'Simply', 'put', 'when', 'address', 'intolerance', 'just', 'interaction', 'unfortunate', 'truth', 'smothered', 'rather', 'own', 'impudence', 'more', 'political', 'substantial', 'fact', 'Crash', 'packed', 'so', 'tight', 'full', 'asinine', 'stereotypes', 'exploded', 'million', 'pieces', 'fragments', 'would', 'have', 'enough', 'false', 'piety', 'supply', 'own', 'feature-length', 'pictures', 'film', 'self-importance', 'positive', 'qualities', 'admittedly', 'are', 'not', 'short', 'supply', 'include', 'winning', 'efforts', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'indigestible', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'uplift', 'conciliatory', 'sensitivity', 'social', 'spotlighting', 'almost', 'embarrassingly', 'forever', 'will', 'thanks', 'three', 'Oscars', 'national', 'acclaim']",Crash

In some way, all of their stories intertwine and each is taught a valuable lesson, some end happily, while others are left in misery.The film starts with Detective Waters(Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria(Jennifer Esposito) sitting in the back of their car after it had just been hit by a frantic chinese woman.  While in the car, Det. Waters tells Ria ""It's all about the touch.  In big cities, people walk by and brush shoulders or bump into you.  IN L.A., nobody touches anybody else.  And, sometime we all need to crash into each other.""  This is basically what all of the characters in this film are going to do in one way or the other.Told in brief scenes and with many characters involved, ""Crash"" takes us through the lives of people from all different ages, races, classes and backgrounds and depicts how each of them view those that are different from themselves.  We have Richard(Brendan Frasor), who is L.A.'s district attorney and his wife Jean(Sandra Bullock).  Jean is shaken up at the beggining of the film, when her and Richard are car-jacked by Anthony(Ludacris) and Peter(Lorenzo Tate).  Not only is Jean shaken, but she is angry and distrustful and quickly lets her feelings be known. She demands the locks on the house be changed again in the morning, because she insists the Mexican installer will bring his ""homies"" back with the spare keys and rob their house.  HE will also play a large role in this film and is my favorite character.  His compassion is something that the rest of our characters, for the most part, lack.There is a Persian family, who run a small convenient store in the city, that is repeatedly rob.  This prompts the father to purchase a gun; which he finds to be terribly difficult, due to his nationality.We have Officer Ryan(Matt Dillon) who is having issues with his father's health conditiona nd is bitter with minorities over affimative action laws.  Unfortunalty, he takes his anger out during a routine traffic stop on Cameron(Terrance Howard) and his wife.  His partnet, Officer Hanson(Ryan Phillippe) is less than pleased with Ryan's actions and asks to be transferred, something he finds is a difficult process.This is the just the start of the film and is only really what happens in the first half-hour.  The remaining 90 minutes is a collage of fast-paced scenes in which all of the above-mentioned characters and some others, are confronted with racism and how they react to it.  Almost all of our characters will question their prior beliefs and some will actually surprise themselves.This film is really terrific.  The cast is superb and the direction is very well done.  I knocked a star off, simply because, with all of the characters involved, there are just too many happy endings.  Not all are happy, but, too many are.  It's not that I don't like happy endings, it is just that in a film that felt so real, some of the endings didn't.  But, justice IS a real witch in this film!Matt Dillon gives what I consider to be his best career performance in this film, and Ludacris is overly convincing and effective in his role(I had no idea he could act).  Hey, we even get a 2 minute cameo of Tony Danza, playing a TV show producer.All in all, ""Crash"" is a film that should be watched and will probably not disappoint!

Many of the scenes are little acting studies in tone, gesture, and facial expression. All characters have very different roles: Dillon and Phillipe are cops with different values, Cheadle is a detective, Fraser is the D.A., Bullock is his wife, and Terrence Howard is a television producer. Other key figures include a Mexican locksmith, two African-American car thieves, and a Persian couple and their daughter.I really loved how the film was engaging, riveting, but that it explored a topic that really mattered. Crash takes a hard look at some thorny issues in our society, things that people don't tend to talk about without becoming emotional or further inflaming the situation. I also liked that the film didn't pretend to have all the answers. Instead, it showed the complexity of the problem and provided much food for thought. It illustrated how those with the best intentions sometimes find themselves the architects of the injustices they despise in society, and how those who are up to no good sometimes end up accomplishing quite alot of it. The film also spoke to me regarding self-definition: how we define ourselves, how we let others define us, what we think makes us who we are, what we think betrays our identities.Paul Haggis' previous credits include the screenplay for Million Dollar Baby, another film that I loved that dealt with unpopular social issues. Haggis is definitely proving himself as someone who says things that we are all thinking, but afraid to verbalize.

I was so expecting _Brokeback Mountain_ that I had hardly considered that anything else could claim the prize. And while I did love BBM, I am very satisfied with the academy's choice. _Crash_ really is a first rate film about issues that most of us can relate to in some way: sex, race, misjudgment, etc., and it is able to do this with one of the best uses of a cast that I have ever seen.Paul Haggis's script and vision are real works of art. Just as with Million Dollar Baby, he is able to create an atmosphere of love and dissatisfaction all at the same time, and the story is very easy to follow. There is not much mystery or drama, just the story of ordinary people living their lives in an unforgiving city - pretty simple. But the real triumph here lies in the use of the cast. Actors not usually know for their depth and rage shine brilliantly here. Some of the better ones are: Sandra Bullock (not the sweet, romantic at all here), Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges (the second huge surprise), Terrence Howard, Ryan Phillippe, and Loretta Devine (Not that they are all not fabulous!) However, the real stars of the show are definitely Thandie Newton and Matt Dillon.Newton does a superb job playing the sexually abused wife of Howard. She is both powerful and extremely vulnerable in her part, and she pulls the mix off perfectly. I was so impressed with her performance. How the academy overlooked her is a mystery to me. I have seen almost all the nominees for best supporting actress, and I can easily say that she deserved a spot on the list. As for Matt Dillon, all I can say is wow. I never would have guessed that the man had such abilities in him. I have seen a few of his movies, and I can say that you have not seen him at his best till you see _Crash_. I was so happy to see him win at the Independent Spirit Awards.The bottom line is that this is an excellent film: highly recommended.

Nor does it leave you with any positive feelings or a manner in which to begin the conversation. I thought it's saving grace were the wonderful performances. But that's all. The Dialogue was jarring and full of venom, but with very little substance. You get a dozen or so, breatheless characters who at the end of the day you can't even remember their names. The fact that the racism is so blatant and basically the fuel for their entire day, and spewed in every conversation is not what racism is today. The fact that though shocked, you really aren't allowed to care for any of the characters. Everyone is a villain. From the snobby black socialite who blames her husband for his mistrust in an authoritarian, after she has been molested. To the white-racist thief who somehow sees himself as the victim as he victimizes others. Every character is offered redemption also, does not speak to the true results of racism. Racism is very prevalent and dangerous. People lose their jobs inexplicably, their homes, their friends. They are attacked, humiliated, and murdered just because of their race. This is the nature of racism in our culture, and for all ""Crash""s talk it offers no complete truth to the audience. Just an abridged Hollywood version.What is worse, is that since you aren't allowed to see much humanity in these characters, people just can't relate. Instead they become forgettable caricatures. Meant to shake you because of what they say, but not who they are. The only question this film poses is "" are you a bigot?""... and thats it. It gives you no insight into how discrimination is bred through experiences, up bringing, education and your environment. Offers no means to heal. Just a poor jagged observation that keeps trying to poke at your conscience until you've succumbed like an annoyed older brother.In ""Crash"" land, whites are the greatest villain, arrogant, rude,intimidating, sly, liars who commit murders & sexual assaults.

920692,A3A4M34UQDJPG9,B000A3XY5A,Omagus,"[2, 4]","Plain and simply, CRASH is the best film I've seen in a long, long time.  There's nothing fancy about it; no $50 million special effects, no plot twist at the end, just a very talented director guiding a very talented cast.The premise of the movie is pretty simple:  most of us know virtually nothing about our neighbors.  Yet we take that little slip of information that we might know (or might think we know) and use it to paint broad strokes.  Racism?  Yes, but to call this a film about race isn't doing it justice.  It plays a significant role, but there's far more to it than just that.  ""Racism"" implies hate, and only the characters portrayed by Matt Dillon and Ludacris can really be said to embody that.  However, even they both gain a measure of redemption before the end of the film (and it's not as cheesy as I just made it sound).Rather than hate each other, these people just don't UNDERSTAND one another.  Don Cheadle's and Jennifer Esposito's characters take ""loving thy neighber"" to its pinnacle but as their dialogue with one another shows, neither of them really knows the other.  Shaun Toub sets out to find Michael Pena for malicious reasons, but not because they dislike one another.  One of them just has two separate encounters and in a moment of confusion, he draws what seems to him to be a logical conclusion.Earlier today (May 13th), M. Nichols gave CRASH a one star rating.  It's not my place to ever criticize someone's opinions; if you don't like something, you just don't like it.  But I do take somewhat of an issue with some of the reasons for the negative review.  First, the comparisions to the other movies are not justified because those movies were ABOUT the issues described.  CRASH is not, it just uses those same issues to say something bigger.  And that brings me to my second point, which I believe is something Paul Haggis did intentionally.  CRASH is not trying to preach, teach or sway anyone.  The film is merely a mirror being held up to society.  That is what is so important about the very last scene.  When someone literally crashes into Loretta Devine's car, you can see the entire cycle about to start over again.Before I end, I'd be remiss if I didn't make further mention of the cast.  It's becoming more and more fashionable to make films with ensemble casts.  Sometimes it can work well, at other times it can be a failure (OCEAN'S TWELVE never happened. Understand?  NEVER. We will not speak of it again).  But this is truly a talented cast.  You expect nothing less than exceptional out of Don Cheadle, and Matt Dillon is right there with him in terms of expectations and payoff.  Sandra Bullock, Brendan Frasier and Ran Phillippe give wonderfully nuanced performances.  Jennifer Esposito, Terrance Howard, Thandie Newton, Michael Pena and Larenz Tate are all wonderful actors who deserve much more than what I have seen them in in the past.And then there's Ludacris...I normally HATE seeing rappers (or singers or quasi-celebrities) in film roles because everyone knows they were cast for their names and the potential box-office bonanza that they may bring.  Far too often they are vastly overshadowed by the real actors they are working alongside, which just further underscores their own lack of talent (Sean Combs in MONSTER'S BALL anyone?).  However, Ludacris holds his own here.  Yes, he may be trying a little too hard but it works for his character.",5,Crash,1115942400,"05 13, 2005",2005,3419,"['Plain', 'simply', 'CRASH', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'nothing', 'fancy', '50', 'million', 'special', 'effects', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'just', 'very', 'talented', 'director', 'guiding', 'very', 'talented', 'cast.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'pretty', 'simple', 'most', 'know', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'neighbors', 'take', 'little', 'slip', 'information', 'might', 'know', 'might', 'think', 'know', 'use', 'paint', 'broad', 'strokes', 'Racism', 'Yes', 'call', 'film', 'race', ""n't"", 'doing', 'justice', 'significant', 'role', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'Racism', 'implies', 'hate', 'only', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Ludacris', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'said', 'embody', 'However', 'even', 'gain', 'measure', 'redemption', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'cheesy', 'just', 'made', 'sound', '.Rather', 'hate', 'other', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'UNDERSTAND', 'one', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'characters', 'take', 'loving', 'thy', 'neighber', 'pinnacle', 'dialogue', 'one', 'shows', 'really', 'other', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'out', 'find', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'malicious', 'reasons', 'not', 'dislike', 'one', 'One', 'just', 'two', 'separate', 'encounters', 'moment', 'confusion', 'what', 'be', 'logical', 'conclusion.Earlier', 'today', 'May', '13th', 'M.', 'Nichols', 'gave', 'CRASH', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'not', 'place', 'ever', 'criticize', 'someone', 'opinions', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'something', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', 'take', 'somewhat', 'issue', 'reasons', 'negative', 'review', 'First', 'comparisions', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'justified', 'movies', 'were', 'issues', 'described', 'CRASH', 'not', 'just', 'same', 'issues', 'say', 'something', 'bigger', 'second', 'point', 'believe', 'something', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'did', 'intentionally', 'CRASH', 'not', 'trying', 'preach', 'teach', 'sway', 'anyone', 'film', 'merely', 'mirror', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'society', 'what', 'so', 'important', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'When', 'someone', 'literally', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'car', 'can', 'see', 'entire', 'cycle', 'start', 'again.Before', 'end', ""'d"", 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'further', 'mention', 'cast', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'fashionable', 'make', 'films', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'can', 'work', 'well', 'other', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'failure', 'OCEAN', 'TWELVE', 'never', 'happened', 'Understand', 'NEVER', 'will', 'not', 'speak', 'again', 'truly', 'talented', 'cast', 'expect', 'nothing', 'less', 'exceptional', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'right', 'there', 'terms', 'expectations', 'payoff', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'Ran', 'Phillippe', 'give', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'are', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'who', 'deserve', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'past.And', 'then', 'Ludacris', 'normally', 'HATE', 'seeing', 'rappers', 'singers', 'quasi-celebrities', 'film', 'roles', 'everyone', 'were', 'cast', 'names', 'potential', 'box-office', 'bonanza', 'may', 'bring', 'Far', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'vastly', 'overshadowed', 'real', 'actors', 'are', 'working', 'alongside', 'just', 'further', 'underscores', 'own', 'lack', 'talent', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'MONSTER', 'BALL', 'anyone', 'However', 'Ludacris', 'own', 'here', 'Yes', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'character']",Crash

I'd several muslim friends who used to advise me not to venture into muslim localities during nights and evenings.Thats quite similar to the predicament of a white person, being advised to stay away from black dominated areas after nightfall.And at present, living in US, I'm a minority. The closest I've come to being discriminated here, is when I'm usually mistaken as a hispanic and strangers accost me speaking in spanish, a language I'm utterly unfamiliar with.Its trivial knowledge that majority communities alone donot discriminate people, minorities do it as well, either due to isolation or propaganda by unscrupulous politicians, numerous reasons abound.The problem comes when certain ideologically oriented people dishonestly try to justify acts of minority discrimination as arising from historical reasons (slavery, segregation, etc) while trivially shunning majority discrimination as based on racial supremism, nazism and what not. They want to level the playing field for all, by ""explaining away"" certain forms of minority discrimination as having legitimate reasons, while chastizing only discriminators from majority community. The end effect is that it builds up an unhealthy frustration in the majority community, which forces itself in the forms of extremism sooner or later.BTW, has anyone ever realized that its possible to even discuss issues of race & religion in ONLY democratic, multi-ethnic societies ?Very few countries in the world are genuinely multi-ethnic and religiously diverse as US and India are. India is perhaps even more diverse than US owing to her great linguistic diversity. And that is probably why people from these two societies cry out the loudest about religious/ethnic discrimination and oppression.Because they are free to do so. They are democracies with freedom of speach and expression are enshrined in their constitution.Afterall :Can you make movies showcasing the racism involved against non-muslims in Saudi Arabia ?Can you complain about censorship and organize anti-government rallies in China ?Can you write articles against Vladimir Putin in Russia and not be jailed ?And yet, inspite of their inherent oppressive societies, they donot face as much flak about their societies as democratic societies do.Movies like Crash only make democratic societies look bad, by show-casing only the ugly side. Even if a couple of such movies are turned out by hollywood and rewarded with best oscars every year, people around the world would get a seriously wrong impression about the nature and character of American society.The truth remains that democratic societies are moving toward assimilation and dialogue. They are already better than most of their counterparts, even though they are not immune from prejudice-free environments. Sooner or later, they'll achieve that harmony and balance. Non-democratic and homogenous ones cannot achieve that balance as their authoritarians systems prohibit open dialogues between different communities.Situation in both US and India is much better than in majority of the known world. Some interesting facts to give a dose of reality to some of you, who probably are too influenced by propaganda from extreme left. Did you know that :--> The standard of living of American blacks, as a whole community, is higher than that of Swedes ? Nearly 70% of black community doesnt belong in Ghettos, but leads normal middle/upper middle class lives ?--> Over 25% of the entire black male adult population in US cohabitates and/or marries White females and over 500,000 Asian females inter-marry with white men each year ? This trend of racial inter-marriage has been growing unabated in United States in the past 2 decades, and only seems to increase. If American society is indeed as racistic as this movie portrays, how is this even possible that millions of Americans have inter-racial marriages each year ?--> According to Amnesty international, blacks are subject to greater job-related and social discrimination in Switzerland, and eastern europe than in USA ? An average black person can experience hate glances and crude remarks with a greater probability in Zurich or Moscow than in backwater Alabama ?--> Persian Americans are the most educationally accomplished of all recent immigration communities in USA ? Over 80% of them hold university degrees.--> Indian Americans are the richest ethnic group in USA, next are Greeks and third are Jews ?--> That India, inspite of its history of caste/religious tensions is the ONLY country in the entire world run entirely by its different minority communities. The Indian president is a MUSLIM, the prime minister and chief of Army staff are both SIKHs. How many non-multiethnic, non-democratic countries would allow their religious/racial minorities to run their countries ? Would China ever allow an Uighur or Manchu to be their president ? Would Saudi Arabia or Pakistan allow a Hindu to rule over them ? Impossible.Democratic societies dont need to feel guilty about the direction of their societies. It'll all settle down if more people concentrated on solutions rather than exploiting the problems and making unfair, guilt-ridden statements about their own societies, mostly based on extrapolations.I just hope the movie makers had realized that the key to harmonious societal existence is BALANCE and STABILITY in inter-racial, inter-religious relationships, which cannot be achieved by a blame game..... before making this movie.",3,"""'Magnolified"" racial dilemmas give wrong impression of American society",1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,6136,"['One', 'better', 'movies', '2005',

Katrina showed us that racism was alive and well in our country, but this film said it first.The story is another six degrees of separation situation with characters of several ethnic backgrounds.  The performances are excellent.  Sandra Bullock who has been given much too little chance to show her true dramatic acting skills gives a finely detailed performance as a spoiled upper class woman whose world is being attacked by the foreigners but who finds in the end that it is the foreigners who are her friends and the ones she can trust.Matt Dillon continues to get better and better with each role.  His performance as a policeman whose life trying to help his retired ailing father is making so him so angry that he takes it out on everyone he meets on the job.  His arguments with his father's HMO, and the overworked doctor assigned to his father will bring recognition to those of us who have been in this position.  I can only hope Dillon will finally win an Oscar one of these days.  Don Cheatle is there playing a police detective torn between his job and his dysfunctional family, and Thandie Newton gives yet one more excellent performance as an African American wife whose first encounter with Dillon's racist policeman is followed by a second where each of them learns things about the other which turns each into a human being instead of a stereotype.  Finally, Ryan Phillippe plays a rookie cop who learns, the hard way, that you shouldn't judge someone until you have walked a mile in their shoes.This film shows that the good guys and the bad guys are not always evident at first glance.  It also shows that a good turn will be remembered and may cause someone to act against their own interests because of it.This picture was mentioned on a list of Oscar possibilities although the candidates have not yet been named.

920702,A3R9SF5BWJ2IA1,B000A3XY5A,"Paul Bowles ""arthistoryliterature""","[18, 24]","I'm not sure why some people like this film.  A few ""serious"" critics whose opinion I generally respect, e.g., David Denby of the New Yorker he also praised the recent ""Dreamgirls"" to the heavens) liked this film a lot.  At the same time, A.O. Scott of the New York Times, Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times, and many others thought it was execrable.I wanted to pop the DVD back into the DVD player to play back a few scenes that had been commented upon (favorably) or seemed to have made a deep impression on some.  BUT I COULDN'T!  [...]I think the cliches pop out in too obvious a fashion and would make a repeat viewing painful.  Once was enough--""I get the idea.""  And it's surprisingly shallow.A far more convincing study of the inexorable nexus--linking chain of events--of character, events, culture, timing, and fate itself was the 2004 film ""House of Sand and Fog"" with Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly.I found the intoning over the soundtrack of Don Cheadle sententious AND pretentious, to say the least, and the sappy ""moralizing"" that suddenly pops out of the mouths of different characters pretty heavy-handed:  ""You think you know who you are.  You have no idea..."" (what exactly is the motivation for Matt Dillon to say this to Ryan Phillipe, except that it will be a commentary on an ensuing vignette with Phillipe and one of the black rappers) or for Cheadle to spout at the beginning ""People in L.A. just crash[-ing] into each other to feel something.""In retrospect, the dialog is not spoken by real people, unless we all speak in ""sound bites"" or maxims about the world.  People DO fly off the handle, certainly do have feelings about race, even if they are largely unexpressed (even to themselves, and rarely, to the person they have those feelings about!), but this film is very contrived in more ways than one.As others have noted, subtlety is not this film's strong card...Lots of sound and fury, yes, exciting confrontations (""crashes""), but the characters, no matter how sharply delineated they were by the actors, were no more than television-style cardboard-cut-outs.Others have mentioned the corny, annoying Enya-esque music soundtrack, the very trite slow-motion photography at the ""significant (read: tear-jerk) moments,"" the excessive Daddy-love-me, and the other abundant forms of hand-wringing, heart-tugging in this film.  I agree--but at least those overt instances of pretty bad taste/sloppiness are congruent with the general mediocrity of the entire effort.  It does get pretty BAD at times, especially as the film unwinds and the novelty of the violent confrontations wears off and ennui predominates (""seen this, heard this, done this before..."").In fact, Paul Haggis's background in television really does show itself, as most of the segments are built a time frame of about 6- to 10-minutes, the segment of a dramatic television serious before a commercial break.  A LOT has to happen within those minutes to keep the television audience tuned in and not change channels.  Maybe with the profanity and expletives removed, it really WOULD play out as a made-for-television movie.The interlocking vignettes that come full circle, after I had thought about it, are a form straight from the Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler's ""La Ronde.""The novelty of the ""[...]-kicking crashes"" wears off within time, especially as they seemed to be paired up, in alternation, with pretty mawkish segments (girl with the red cape, Matt Dillon with his father, Sandra Bullock hugging her maid, etc.).Is this what ""real"" life is supposed to be like?  Or is this a sort of moral parable?  Or a compendium of the ""worst"" moments (and if so, why?  just for rhetorical effect)?  Or, more likely, is it a ""fantasy"" concocted in the mind of screenwriter/director Paul Haggis?I think what is the most dismaying about this film is that a lot of white people, college students, people in mostly white communities, away from the reality of urban life, will say to themselves:  ""Oh, my, gosh!  This is what racism is REALLY like!  Now I get it!  This is really what happens to black people every day!"" as if this film is a very accurate portrayal of race relations in this country.Purportedly this film is trying to shatter notions of racism and stereotypes.  But in doing so, it comes across as being as didactic and Manichean as the Roman Catholic Church by sheer dint of portraying one day in the life of Los Angeles as a series of over-the-top racial confrontations alternately with sappy snapshots of the other ""hidden"" facet of the same set of characters.  Jekyll is really Hyde.  Granted, Haggis is trying to do something with an ensemble cast that Robert Altman did in many of HIS films.  But I don't recall Altman ever being so obvious, so flat-footed, so ""this is the message.""But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences liked it because it is ultimately just a reflection of the kind of self-congratulatory staring-at-one's-navel that the Oscars are famous for.Another thing: I think Asian-Americans, who make up approximately  10% of the population of California, are portrayed very in very stereotypical terms--either as first-generation immigrants or illegal aliens, all of whom speak English with thick accents.As an Asian-American, I recognized to some of the ""SURFACE"" racial issues, but I don't think they were dealt with in depth at all.  The picture ""Crash"" presents of racism in America does NOT reflect my own personal experiences except in very CRUDE and brutal ways.  (As a matter of fact, I have experienced ""tons more"" racism and prejudice from African-Americans, as opposed to Africans, than Caucasians).It certainly doesn't reflect the political correctness and complexity of racial/ethnic interactions here in Seattle.  I recognize some of the explosive anger, misunderstanding, etc. in this film, but I think the movie was ""undone"" by the pretty ""stock"" situations that are not presented with great originality.Yes, L.A. apparently lives on adrenaline, fast cars, and this film, while capturing that aspect,  seems to rely too much on ""shock and awe"" posturing that appears implausible upon reflection.  Superficial, panoramic but certainly not profound in the sense that I don't think it offered any particularly new insights on the topic (the ostensible raison d'etre of this film.The ""redemption"" theme (made emphatic by the corny chorus of angels heard over the soundtrack) was really quite far-fetched and unearned.  Just a way little TOO glib, simple-minded.Someone, please, tell me how this film contributes to a discussion of race  and ethnicity in this country?It's disturbing to think that there are people living in parts of the country where there isn't a mixture of races and ethnicities will say to themselves: ""A-HA!  This explains racism, this is an accurate picture of race as it is lived in America.""",2,"Lots of adrenaline, phoney tough talk, melodramatics",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,6869,"[""'m"", 'not',

The Academy Award nominated screenwriter of ""MILLION DOLLAR BABY"" shocks his audience once again.  In a story too complex to explain, and so beautifully detailed and realized to give away, all I can tell the novice who may read this is that if you wisely spend your money to see this film, you will not only come away having sat through an extremely entertaining story, but you will come away utterly moved, and you will be compelled to examine your own life that you lead day to day.In any given place, at any given time, people who you may only lay eyes on for a few moments can and will have a lasting effect on your existence.  Our worlds, our minds literally ""CRASH"" into each other leaving us shaken, stunned and hopefully, enlightened.  This amazing work of Haggis' is simply lifted to a higher level thanks to the pitch perfect work of a cast any director would kill to work with.  In a sea of flawless performances, it is difficult to say who stands out the most.  Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillion and Thandie Newton give career defining performances delivering thoughtful speeches that will take your breath away.  The rest of the cast, which includes the always wonderful Don Cheadle, the stunning Jennifer Espisito, Brendan Fraser, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard, William Fichtner and Ryan Phillippe to name a few, are all absolutely heartbreaking.I can't rave enough about this film.

Allow me to explain:  First off, I felt like I've seen this movie before, a couple of times actually.  Secondly, I found the characters to be a little thin.  Racism, lets be honest, is still a strong issue in America today but I think the reasons for a character's racism should have been the focal point of the film and not necessarily the consequences of their racism.  We've seen that before too.  And what was with the montage toward the end where all the characters were shown to be having their great cathertic moments while the soft music - that sounded an awful like Aimee Mann's ""Save Me"" - is played?  Magnolia anyone?  I'm not slamming the movie at all.  Please don't get me wrong.  As I said, I liked the movie.  It was good.  One scene in particular moved me, but I think it was just so over-hyped and it seemed to be the only movie not revolving around [...] characters to be nominated for an Oscar and I think that helped it out in a year so much about [...] this and [...] that and traditional morals and blah blah blah.

The way this intelligent gem works is that it makes you ultimately not want anything bad to happen to any of these people. The ""heroes and villains"" we encounter are brilliantly taken beyond type and become real enough for us genuinely to care - how much better is that than the soft-soap preachifying we get out of so many other ""issue"" pieces that strap their hearts onto their sleeves (and, all too often, the chips onto their shoulders) from the outset! ""Crash"" goes for the brain. It bonds you with an intriguing cross-section of recognisable individuals, challenging expectations all the time.It's no less engaging and entertaining for all that, pulling off several mind-changes with little in the way of obvious moral convolution but much invested in character study and telling, accumulating, intersecting incidents. Plus it contains a couple of the most dry-mouthed, breath-catching suspense set-pieces you're likely to experience. The musical score matches this effective subversion by giving you moving, haunting themes in action-moments where more obvious players would lump in the techno-beats. Wit sparks in the dialogue where others would pile on the profanity and tough-talk. There's an elegance to the whole piece that makes what goes on cherishable rather than disposable.All the characters whose lives collide here are divided - by class, gender, age and, of course, race (this last element being the paradoxical link, other than narrative, that ""unites"" the cast in being the focus for their various alienations). They are also variously unappealing or likeable in their ""types"" and behaviours. So just to shake this lot together in a series of overlapping incidents would have been engaging enough, given the acting abilities of all concerned and the terrific dialogue they're given.As I said, though, the film's moral triumph is to take our sympathies and allegiances and work on them until we realise that the ""value"" of everyone here is that they deserve to stay in the world. We're ultimately surprised by the value and humanity to which everyone here is seen to aspire in their way. The film is exciting, harrowing and funny enough to hit all the right buttons in terms of good, popular viewing; but the affirmative difference it finally makes is well worth celebrating.

So I guess a film like this is still considered exotic and cutting edge.  I sure don't know why.  Maybe some people have yet to understand that multiculturalism in a ghetto doesn't work.  The stream of consciousness script suffers from a deep dependency on trying to be cute and tricky by throwing in an anomaly here and there, but it fails miserably as these are just silly contrivances.  The black youth who is into country music, hitch hiking a ride back to the city from the valley after ice-skating and confessing his dream of being a goalie is shot and killed by the white driver who thinks the youth has a gun, it turns out to be a skate key.  Another laughable moment is the hot car parts guy offering to buy the Cambodian immigrants from the [black] car thief who subsequently ""frees"" them instead of taking the money.  C'mon give me a break!  In the modern PC world people are much more subtle then this.  The dialogue and story line is just silly at times.Stereotypes are generalities about a race or culture.  There is a reason why stereotypes exist.  It's because they are generally true.  But is the issue really race and culture or is it one of class?  Either way I say so what?  This film wants you to feel guilty about the occasional racial slip of the tongue or for leaving the city and moving out to the suburbs where you lose touch.  Believe me I lived in the pit of hell called LA for far too long.  Crime is rampant, the schools are disgusting and worthless, and the bureaucrats are just getting fatter and fatter.  I used to wake up angry all the time too.  So I left and I make no apologies for it.  Do I reside in a super white bread upper middle class community?  You bet, and guess what, no crime, great public schools, low taxes, and no more anger.  Is that just a coincidence; I think not.  Bad people live in the world.  They come in all colors and from all cultures, but they are generally poor, uneducated, and live in overpopulated urban areas.  Throwing out a racial epithet under the heat of the moment doesn't make you a racist...it makes you human and fallible and one seeking immediate, cheap emotional gratification.  Don't feel guilty about it.  This flick is a waste of time.  In the end heavy handed clich&eacute;s and a preachy ""can't wall all just get along"" mess packaged in two long hours is all you get.

It is true that the movie has many convenient twists and turns, but these devices are meant to demonstrate a larger point.  The point is that we, as Americans, are all in this together.  We may be separated by race, culture, ethnicity and gender, but each of us has a role to play in society.  People may not see the interconnectedness, but we do have a common stake in the eventual outcome.  In the later half of the 20th century, as Americans moved out of the close confines of urban existence, and as huge faceless conglomerates developed that destroyed the traditional family business, Americans lost a personal touch that they once had.  As different cultures and ethnic groups cloistered themselves in their own communities, misunderstandings and fear increased from one community to another.  Misunderstandings and fear led to racism, but as `Crash' rightly points out, stereotypical thinking is not limited to one group.  All the characters in this movie have a chance for redemption.  Some redeem themselves by their actions, but some make it by simple twists of fate.

They suggested it was for those afflicted with what is commonly called ""White Guilt"".  I expected to see a biased look at racism in America but what I saw instead was probably the most balanced, instructive look at the whole issue of racism that I have ever seen.  Although I didn't see any Native Americans in the movie, the people involved spanned the American racial Kalaidescope in both male and female, young and old.  Each individual is given a chance to be viewed from both a positive and negative perspective.  There are numerous surprize twists and many scenes that elicit strong emotional responses.Essentially, ""Crash"" is a movie about the errors of being too quick to judge or being overly judgemental.  I suspect the detractors I heard from earlier felt that the movie is about not being judgemental at all.  I didn't get that impression.  I came away quite judgemental in  regard to many of the vignettes as I suspect the writer, director, and producer wanted their viewers to.  I believe they also wanted us to recognize that no one is all bad (nor, apparently, all good).  I accept that.  While there is a great deal of subtlety in this movie, most of the incidents hit us like a 2x4 to the head.  The scenes involving Matt Dillon were particularly intense.This movie's chain of events is, of course, improbable but to focus on that is to miss an excellent choreography of inter-relationships.  There is one scene (I don't think I'm giving anything away) that I DID question.  It had to do with some smuggled Hmong aliens.  A rather seedy character, upon discovering them in hiding, immediately saw the opprotunity to make a bundle by selling them into slavery.  I may be naive but I can't imagine someone coming to that conclusion.  Otherwise, improbability aside, every other incident was very pausible.I came away from ""Crash"" with an appreciation for what the movie tried to do.

920724,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,B000A3XY5A,R. A Rubin,"[1, 7]","Crash is a very aggressive look at Race Relations 2004 in Los Angeles.  It's an ensemble piece with the various races represented, a number of the characters in the police department or city government.  These stories of the naked city have been tried before by John Sayles in Lonestar, with a much lighter note, LA Story, 1991 with Steve Martin, or Lawrence Kasdan's, Grand Canyon, 1991 (also with the LA motif).  All these films rely on the interactions of diverse peoples that normally would not come into contact with each other except for the imagination of the screenwriter. Everything works as long as the viewer goes along with the string of coincidences.  Coincidence is actually what makes most stories, stories, but woe if the writer overdoes it.  La Story and Grand Canyon work, but Lonestar and Crash do not.Paul Haggis wants very much to get at the nature of racial tensions and prejudice.  His avalanche of coincidences crisscross our moonscape of an LA inhabited by folks that seemed to be armed to the teeth.  That's the main tension.  Who is gonna shoot who?  Since all have a beef with society for one reason or other, who is gonna get it?Spare me from gangbangers that sound like Bobby Seal, the Black Panther loony that went up for murdering his white, old lady secretary.  She knew too much.  Don't act like the glory days of Black Power were so special when there is much evidence that militancy catalyzes murder and poverty.  Then we have upper-crusty black women chastising a film director, a soft-spoken black man because he doesn't protect her from the sleazy Matt Dillion cop. Just deball a fellow and see what happens ladies.  That's not race relations; that's ball busting.There are a baker's dozen story lines, too many to comment on all, but why do these films always end with a look into the sunset or a bizarre LA snowfall.

The dialogue occasionally reflects more what the screenwriter is saying than what it seems plausible for the character to be saying. Still, it's a very honest, ambiguous, thought-provoking film, one worth seeing more than once and with different friends to hear their thoughts about it.

On the contrary, I was caught up in the stories, and recommend the film for dramatic impact alone.  Furthermore, I took the ""message"" as a broad one about the injustice that can result from any pre-judgment of people and their intentions, regardless of race, a perfectly well-taken moral along the lines of ""innocent until proven guilty."" If there was anything more liberal than that, it was too subtle to bother a guy like me.The performances were great and the directing, editing, and writing blend the stories skillfully to maintins suspense from beginning to end.

The movie, CRASH, raises many questions about the issue of race, such as how far have we come? How come we know so much, but so little about the people around us?  The film is quite controversial because of its depiction of stereotypes and misconceptions that people make about one's race, ethnicity, and class; The collage of stories interconnect with each other.Director Paul Haggis and Don Cheadle produced a character study type of film about race.  The star-studded cast, which includes Sandra Bullock, Brandon Fraser, Matt Dillon, and a who's who list, do an exemplary job.  The opening scenes of CRASH ignites with an exchange of racist fervor and an automobile crash, and ends with an automobile crash with the exchange of racist fervor to suggest that racism is an unending circle that never seems to end.  The film tackles generalizations people make about another's race and class that imposes reverse racism on both sides with those making the racist comment.The concluding scenes are the most pivotal.  While watching particular scenes, watch for how the St. Christopher statue is depicted in the film - how similar we are when successful communication is dispersed, but when there is a lack of understanding, things get ugly.  The most memorable and disturbing line in the film is when veteran police officer (Matt Dillon) speaks to his rookie partner (Ryan Phillipe) about identity.After viewing this film, CRASH shows how small a world we live in.

But what is worth discussing is writer/director Paul Hagis's intentions in making this film.After seeing CRASH a few times, I wonder if he hoped to position it as a water cooler discussion provoker a la ""Do the Right Thing.""  I wonder this because with the exception of two characters, everyone depicted in this film is both heroic and demonic.  A good example is the Matt Damon character, a rapist (and racist) cop who struggles to care for his ailing father.  There are at least 10 other examples of this kind of multi-layered character development.But two characters, a maid and a locksmith, are sterling characters throughout the film.  They suffer prejudice and yet they succeed in rising above the 'kick the dog' mentality that afflicts the rest of the cast of characters.Because I cannot imagine what message Hagis is trying to convey in reserving these two characters as pure (is he passionately pro-Latino?)

They simply don't apply here.To say that ""Crash"" is a movie about race relations is true, but it also sells the film completely short in terms of the effect that it has and the stories that it tells.  It's almost unbearably frustrating, even infuriating to watch, because it's honest, and it is the film's honesty that makes it well worth seeing.The story is a complex one, interweaving the lives of several characters over the course of two days.  How they meet, under what circumstances, and how they react to one another forms the meat of the story...and there's a lot here to chew on. As the title implies, conflict arises in almost every interaction, but it is the complexity that is admirable here.  Each thread of story intertwines with the others in ways both obvious and subtle.  Some of them part, never to meet again, while others meet more than once as the story progresses. All set in the racial hotbed of Los Angeles, where tensions tend to run high just in the natural course of things.""Crash"" is an emotional rollercoaster in the truest sense, dragging you places that you might not want to go, from shaking with rage to gasping from shock to weeping with joy.  Almost every scene is played to a perfect emotional pitch, surprising and challenging and just right for the feeling it wants to express.

It takes place in Los Angeles where I work and play, it features many of my favorite actors, and it is about a subject that I am concerned about and affects us all, but...It was clear from the start that this movie would be sappy and cliche-filled: 'we crash into each other in order to make contact.' Anybody who would believe such a premise does not live in Southern California - let alone Los Angeles. The opposite is actually closer to the truth. CRASH quite simply spotlights this behavior and is a reminder of why we act as we do.According to CRASH, we have justification for all our prejudice and hate for one another (and according to these movie-makers we all have them). After watching CRASH, one can believe that every stereotypical, hate and fear-based feeling we have is A-Okay:Afraid of black guys walking down the street - you have every reason.Think that a white can't hire a non-white without getting ripped off - you're right.Believe that black people hate white people as much as whites hate blacks - it's not just your imagination (running away with you).Think Asians shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a vehicle - here's your proof.Middle-Eastern, Puerto Rican, and Mexican people are in their somewhere too, however they get lost in these confusing, go-nowhere and misdirected collection of video clips.Many scenes start off hot and quickly fizzle out leaving the viewer wondering if the story will be continued in another segment or just plain didn't get the message.The most unfortunate aspect of this movie was the waste of such a great cast. These very talented people found themselves in the middle of a muddle.Most did very well with what little they had to work with, which earned CRASH the three stars instead of one.The stand-out performers who deserve mention:Terence Howard and Michael Pena are both brilliant. Hopefully we will see much more of these truly great actors.Sandra Bullock gives one of her best 'against-type' performances.Luducris is impressive and shows great potential for even more.If CRASH is such a profound insight of a cross-section of human nature in Los Angeles,...ask yourself why the creators did not include any gay characters in their vast line-up.

The film tugs at your heartstrings in an attempt to distract you from the stereotypes portrayed throughout.

The only thing missing was a flamboyant or militant gay character. The storyline was held together with spit and the sequence of events was hardly believable but it keeps moving and holds your attention with strong performances all around. Had this movie been released in the seventies, moviegoers would not have blinked an eye, but in today's PC climate you could hear the gasps and sighs throughout the audience. We've become a nation of ""word police"" and thus as a whole we are much more sensitive to the harsh realities around us. The movies plays and feeds on those very sensitivities. The movie does manage to shed some balance throughout. The Arabic daughter was articulate and mild-mannered, the hispanic locksmith was portrayed in a favorable light, and Matt Dillon's character was one at odds with himself.

920736,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000A3XY5A,RMurray847,"[4, 5]","In some of the early reviews I read of this movie, many critics said, ""It's the kind of movie that gets you talking afterwards.""  I frequently scoff at such things, because so often the subtext is...""This is a movie that will make you angry at some group / type of person and you'll want to take action.""  I don't really want my movies to force a point of view down my throat.  But the cast was too good to pass up, so my wife and I went.Well, for a few hours after the movie, our conversation was about little other than the issues, emotions and ironies that this movie brought up.  We enjoyed it thoroughly, found it original and riveting, well made and thought provoking.It's a script full of intersecting stories.  We meet a bunch of different people, from different races, different backgrounds, different socio-economic standings.  Their own personal problems fuse with their racial attitudes, and with one dizzying but convincing coincidence after another, their stories intersect in often violent, never predictable ways.You've probably heard that the movie has a lot to say about race...and it certainly does.  That is on its mind more than anything else.  But it makes racial attitudes personal.  We don't feel any character is speaking for a group or type...they are themselves, individuals.  White characters make slurs against Latinos.  Blacks against Asians.  Asians against Hispanics.  Hispanics against blacks.  Every possible combination.  Some characters never learn to rethink their prejudices, others have them affirmed and still others have them shaken abruptly loose.I won't try to detail specific plot items.  Suffice it to say that we cover a short period of time in and around the Los Angeles area, and the various families, individuals, police partners, etc.  get jumbled around in an amazing but easy to follow sequence.  Although the plotting is very complicated, IT IS NEVER HARD TO FOLLOW.  Paul Haggis, writer/director (writer of MILLION DOLLAR BABY), takes us through the movie simply and crisply.There is one plot development, involving a little girl, her locksmith father and a Persian shopkeeper that packs a huge, HUGE punch when it reaches its climax.  I heard audible gasps from the audience and, no exaggeration, a couple of sobs too!  Another great moment comes when the characters played by Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton collide for a second time.  It's a moment of great tension and though few words are exchanged, amazing things happen to the characters emotionally.Other moments involved incredible twists of irony, such as the amusing and violent story arc for the car-jacker played by Ludacris.  Almost no story goes where you expect it to.  Each story is equally involving.  There is not really a wasted moment in the movie...it is boiled down to its essence, yet it feels somehow epic and all-embracing...kinda like SHORT CUTS or MAGNOLIA.There are also many remarkable performances.  Matt Dillon might be Oscar nomination worthy.  Thandie Newton, generally a supremely annoying performer (see E.R. or Mission Impossible II) has her acting quirks put to proper use here, and her final scene with Dillon, as I said, is a doozy.  Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito play Detective partners, and they create some great sparks.  Cheadle really is a terrifically versatile performer, and here we sympathize with him at times and hate him at times...kinda like many people we might know in real life.  Sandra Bullock has a small but juicy role, a departure from her usual personality, and an indication that maybe Miss Congeniality roles shouldn't be where her career is headed.  Brendan Frasier uses his typically bland exterior in the role of District Attorney to portray a politician who knows where he stands with all his constituents and knows exactly how to get others to do his dirty work.  And although many, many other actors are stellar in the movie and I can't list them all here, I do want to give special note about Ludacris, who is thoroughly convincing in a part that requires some delicate shadings of character.  Here's another hip-hop star who appears to be the real deal when it comes to acting.The movie is R-rated, and it deserves to be.  Language is pretty harsh, and the themes are harsher.  It NEEDS to be seen by thinking adults, because it has the power to make you evaluate yourself, to turn the spotlight on your own attitudes.  It's also so well-written and acted that I hope it gets remembered come Oscar time.

The full effect of the film is a school of fantastic performances awash in a sea of mediocrity in direction, pace, and especially writing.Haggis, who should be best remembered as the creator of TV's Walker, Texas Ranger, takes an ensemble cast through a day of racism. Yes, folks, that's the entire premise of the film; various things happen, but there's no real defining moment. Some characters die, and some characters come to realize that their racism is wrong, both of which generally happen with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the temple; Haggis has a message, folks, and he wants to make sure you get it. As always, when the message supersedes the medium, the result is a mediocre mess.It is, however, a mediocre mess that includes some fantastic performances. Larenz Tate, one of Hollywood's great underrated, turns in his best performance here since The Inkwell a decade before. Tate is never less than excellent, and here he's brilliant. Ludacris, as Tate's partner in crime, shows a flair for the dramatic as well. Brendan Fraser, who's spent the years since Gods and Monsters acting in fluff, shows that he is, in fact, still capable of sinking his teeth into a dramatic role. Sandra Bullock, playing Fraser's wife, is on the other hand completely wasted, nothing more than a cardboard cutout there to advance a viewpoint. Other excellent actors have what seem as if they could be powerful roles, but don't get nearly enough screen time to develop them-- Don Cheadle and Keith David are the two prime examples. Other wonderful actors are stuck with Bullock-like roles, most notably William Fichtner.When I started writing this review, I didn't know that Paul Haggis was the creator of Walker, Texas Ranger; now, however, it seems like I should have known all along. ** ?",3,"Not bad, but Best Picture?

Zwick,"[32, 43]","Like a bad student film with big-name stars in its cast, Paul Haggis' puerile and self-important ""Crash"" is a masterpiece for the easily impressed.  Filled with bathos and bombast, and more implausible coincidences than an 800-page novel by Charles Dickens (and no offense meant to Mr. Dickens), ""Crash"" plays less like a movie and more like some underachiever's dissertation for a Sociology course entitled Racism 101.  (Racist white cop fondles black woman in front of her husband at routine traffic stop...pause projector...discuss what this scene shows about racism in our society...resume film...same racist white cop pulls same black woman to safety from burning wreckage...pause projector...discuss what this scene says about the possibility of redemption for every individual...etc.).  Astonishingly, this piece of mealy-mouthed claptrap won the Academy Award for the Best Picture of 2005.Cribbing its interlocking, multi-character format from ""Short Cuts,"" ""Grand Canyon,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""13 Conversations About One Thing"" and a whole host of other similar but far superior films, Haggis' work purports to tell us that everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - living in Los Angeles is a thoroughgoing racist and bigot and, even more amazingly, spends twenty-four hours a day giving voice to their prejudice.  Forget about political correctness; these people talk about race, race and nothing but race for nigh unto two hours in ways that show that Haggis is completely tone deaf when it comes to how people in the real world actually speak.  This is a movie devoid of a single plausible moment (you know that verisimilitude is not high on this film's agenda when it starts snowing in Los Angeles!); it's a movie in which characters act completely without reason or motivation and in which every event that happens, no matter how idiotic or ridiculous, does so in the service of the message.  On the level of dramaturgy alone, ""Crash"" is an unmitigated disaster and a blueprint for how not to make a movie.Unfortunately, as ""Crash"" itself begins to crash and burn, an awful lot of fine people wind up getting trapped inside the wreckage.  A largely talented cast is wasted on an assortment of poorly written, shallow characters, and Haggis has no idea of how to create either drama or tension in any of the scenes he shows us.  The moody score by Mark Isham does its best to make it all seem powerful and important, but the sheer incompetence of the writing and directing rob the film of both those qualities.  Indeed, rarely has a movie been as full of itself as ""Crash"" is, and rarely has a movie explored such a serious and important subject in as pretentious and superficial a manner.  Perhaps the most insulting aspect of the film is how easily it bestows redemption on even its most wretched characters, as if all of life's problems could be so easily wrapped up in time for the closing credits.  As others before me have pointed out, this is indeed a ""feel good"" movie about racism, the very last thing a movie about racism should ever be.If you can buy a film in which an assortment of whiney, unappealing characters hurl racial invectives at one another for an hour and a half, then turn around and throw themselves into each others' arms in time for the tear-stained finale, then ""Crash"" may be the movie for you.

When I watch a movie I want to be entertained, learn, and/or emotionally be moved.

Particularly, there are two scenes in this that will literally bring you to tears or at a minimum emotionally destroy you.But is it entertaining?  That appears to be where there is conflict.

Not grandstanding and sparkly, but real. Was fun to see actors that I recognized from elsewhere. Like - Oh! There's Tom from ""Invasion"" and there's Noah Wiley's girlfriend from ER. The 2 black kids cracked me up! The guy with mom and brother made me cry, as did the Hispanic daddy.. that scene was breathtaking good, dam good!

In Los Angeles, there's just one, and we're all a part of it.The degrees of separation dwindle from six to two. Love, hate, crime, virtue, defeat, triumph -  it's all part of the same soup in the desert under hazy skies. The best Los Angeles movies - ""Chinatown,"" ""LA Confidential,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""Short Cuts"" - express that theme with large casts, a wide canvas, a feast of subplots and an operatic scheme.""Crash"" isn't quite cut from that cloth, but it belongs in the conversation, especially now that it's won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Writer-director Paul Haggis investigates racism under admittedly contrived, sensational circumstances, where villains become heroes and vice versa in one day. But the writing is strong and fierce, and the conflicts, while hyperboles, underline what's really going on out there - we're all pretty ticked off, nursing certain wounds, equally capable of cruelty and sympathy depending on who or what irritates that ulcer of discontent. Consider the characters long enough, and a more classic theme emerges - good vs evil, sin vs charity. Haggis is smart enough to know racism is a symptom, not the disease. Over two hours he slowly proves it.The large ensemble includes Don Cheadle as a homicide detective, an unfavored son to his heroin-addicted mother; Matt Dillon as a racist cop watching his father die because of a crooked HMO; Ryan Phillippe as his partner; Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton as an upscale black couple targeted by Dillon's character one late night; Brendan Fraser as a too-race-conscious district attorney; Sandra Bullock as his trophy wife; Larenz Tate and Ludacris as carjackers ; and William Fichtner, in one of those deal-with-the-devil roles of sublime corruption in the name of sensible politics. They mix, sometimes violently, curse and grapple, even redeem one another. The plot is cleverly spun, if a bit mythical, and worth discovering in the theater.Cheadle is the lead; though the cast is billed alphabetically, only Cheadle wanders through the entire picture. He's excellent again, cool, intellectual, at a distance from his family and his partner (Jennifer Esposito), who doubles as his lover. Not unlike other characters in ""Crash,"" there is one thing particularly important to him, and his flaws keep him from quite protecting it. The same with Dillon's cop - he means well with his father, but his ""white man's lament"" so damages relations with the black HMO manager (Loretta Devine) that it nullfies his good intent. Newton and Bullock, in smaller roles, illuminate the necessity for marginalized wives to express the anger their prominent husbands cannot. They're victims/villains, in a sense, able to articulate but not act, powerless in a structure that favors the male code of business.Nearly every major character, save one Latino locksmith(Michael Pena), seems to harbor some unjustified prejudice, and one of the weaknesses of ""Crash"" is that they speak of these in such blunt, vicious words. But it's also a strength: While racism in the 21st Century is subversive enough that we've developed ways of executing our prejudice without resorting to slurs, Haggis knows that, in a movie, a flashpoint must precede substance if it's going to reach a wide audience. A gotcha before the insight.By the end Haggis has taken us through enough of these gotchas that we can telegraph the  ""surprise"" twist, involving what was previously the movie's most upstanding, idealistic character. And I don't much buy that scene, sad and jarring as it is. But by that point you're wrapped up in ""Crash,"" in its barking performances, Mark Isham's somber score and night setting, so that you reflect on a world whose misfortune, among others, is to fear what we don't know or understand, instead of embracing what we can.""I wake up angry every morning,"" Bullock's character says at one point, and it's a summary statement for the whole tangled web. Directing it toward a skin tone or a foreign accent seems pretty dumb but, of course, when you're happy, waking up angry every morning does, too.",4,"A deep, emotional investigation into the roots of racism",1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,4115,"['are', 'nine', 'million', 'stories', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'just', 'one', ""'re"", 'part', 'it.The', 'degrees', 'separation', 'dwindle', 'six', 'two', 'Love', 'hate', 'crime', 'virtue', 'defeat', 'triumph', 'part', 'same', 'soup', 'desert', 'hazy', 'skies', 'best', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'movies', 'Chinatown', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'Magnolia', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'express', 'theme', 'large', 'casts', 'wide', 'canvas', 'feast', 'subplots', 'operatic', 'scheme', 'Crash', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cut', 'cloth', 'conversation', 'especially', 'now', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Writer-director', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'racism', 'admittedly', 'contrived', 'sensational', 'circumstances', 'where', 'become', 'heroes', 'vice', 'versa', 'one', 'day', 'writing', 'strong', 'fierce', 'conflicts', 'hyperboles', 'underline', 'what', 'really', 'going', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'ticked', 'off', 'nursing', 'certain', 'wounds', 'equally', 'capable', 'cruelty', 'sympathy', 'depending', 'who', 'what', 'ulcer', 'discontent', 'Consider', 'characters', 'long', 'enough', 'more', 'classic', 'theme', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'sin', 'vs', 'charity', 'Haggis', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'racism', 'symptom', 'not', 'disease', 'two', 'hours', 'slowly', 'it.The', 'large', 'ensemble', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'homicide', 'detective', 'unfavored', 'son', 'heroin-addicted', 'mother', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'racist', 'cop', 'watching', 'father', 'die', 'crooked', 'HMO', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'partner', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'upscale', 'black', 'couple', 'targeted', 'Dillon', 'character', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'too-race-conscious', 'district', 'attorney', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'Ludacris', 'carjackers', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'one', 'deal-with-the-devil', 'roles', 'sublime', 'corruption', 'name', 'sensible', 'politics', 'mix', 'sometimes', 'violently', 'curse', 'grapple', 'even', 'redeem', 'one', 'plot', 'cleverly', 'spun', 'bit', 'mythical', 'worth', 'discovering', 'theater.Cheadle', 'lead', 'cast', 'billed', 'alphabetically', 'only', 'Cheadle', 'wanders', 'entire', 'picture', 'excellent', 'again', 'cool', 'intellectual', 'distance', 'family', 'partner', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'who', 'lover', 'Not', 'other', 'characters', 'Crash', 'one', 'thing', 'particularly', 'important', 'flaws', 'keep', 'quite', 'protecting', 'same', 'Dillon', 'cop', 'well', 'father', 'white', 'man', 'lament', 'damages', 'relations', 'black', 'HMO', 'manager', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'good', 'intent', 'Newton', 'Bullock', 'smaller', 'roles', 'illuminate', 'necessity', 'marginalized', 'wives', 'express', 'anger', 'prominent', 'husbands', 'can', 'not', ""'re"", 'victims/villains', 'sense', 'able', 'articulate', 'not', 'act', 'powerless', 'structure', 'male', 'code', 'business.Nearly', 'major', 'character', 'save', 'one', 'Latino', 'locksmith', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'harbor', 'unjustified', 'prejudice', 'one', 'weaknesses', 'Crash', 'speak', 'such', 'blunt', 'vicious', 'words', 'also', 'strength', 'racism', '21st', 'Century', 'subversive', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'ways', 'executing', 'prejudice', 'resorting', 'slurs', 'Haggis', 'movie', 'flashpoint', 'must', 'precede', 'substance', 'going', 'reach', 'wide', 'audience', 'gotcha', 'insight.By', 'end', 'Haggis', 'taken', 'enough', 'gotchas', 'can', 'telegraph', 'surprise', 'twist', 'involving', 'what', 'was', 'previously', 'movie', 'most', 'upstanding', 'idealistic', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'buy', 'scene', 'sad', 'jarring', 'point', ""'re"", 'wrapped', 'up', 'Crash', 'barking', 'performances', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'somber', 'score', 'night', 'setting', 'reflect', 'world', 'misfortune', 'others', 'fear', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'understand', 'instead', 'embracing', 'what', 'can', 'wake', 'up', 'angry', 'morning', 'Bullock', 'character', 'one', 'point', 'summary', 'statement', 'whole', 'tangled', 'web', 'Directing', 'skin', 'tone', 'foreign', 'accent', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'course', 'when', ""'re"", 'happy', 'waking', 'up', 'angry', 'morning', 'too']",Crash

The script doesn't miss a chance for picking on people because of exterior perceptions and stereotypes, and no one is exempt from the hate.  The plotline is pretty much a day in the lives of many people, and how they can intertwine with the good, the bad, and the downright ugly.How many assumptions will you make, watching this film?  Where does your ""tolerance"" begin and end?  Rich or poor, no matter your color or religion, 'Crash' will spare no one the humiliation of being human.Aside from a script that asks more questions than it answers, 'Crash' is an exceptionally well-cast film with stellar performances, superb editing, outstanding photography, and enough insults to go around for everyone no matter where or what circumstances you come from.Sandra Bullock, who plays Jean Cabot, the DA's wife, has proven herself in both comedic and serious roles.  Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda) is perfect as Det. Graham Waters.  His partner, Ria, (expertly played by Jennifer Esposito) is a strong female cop who clashes heads with Waters (among other things).  Brandon Fraser as DA Rick Cabot gives a great serious performance in spite of the fact I always see him as George Of The Jungle.Thandie Newton gives her best performance to date in the role of Christine Thayer, movie producer Cameron Thayer's wife.  Terrence Howard is simply amazing in the role of Cameron.  Keith David (Requiem For A Dream) is excellent as always.  Watch for a great performance by Ken Garito (Summer Of Sam, Clockers), an actor I will keep my eye on from now on.  Ludacris and Larenz Tate are perfect as the roaming car-jackers.The real surprise comes from Matt Dillon.  Perhaps he has never had a role challenge him before, but he absolutely shines in his role as Sgt. Jack Ryan.  Absolutely Dillon's best performance.There are small cameo roles by Marina Sirtis as Shereen (yeah!) and Tony Danza as Fred (yuck!), but my hat goes off to the entire supporting cast of this amazing movie, along with director Paul Haggis.I would rate 'Crash' higher than five stars if I could.  I think it's a movie everybody should watch, if only to judge your own reaction to it.

And by powerful, I mean extremely boring. Basically what the movie boils down to is two hours of white liberal guilt, the movie was written and directed by Paul Haggis, writer of Million Dollar Baby, and needless to say the liberal movie academy ate the movie up giving it six nominations.The movie starts off with a car crash involving Don Cheadle (NFL Playoff Commercials) and Jennifer Esposito (Dracula 2000). Cheadle is really shaken up and goes off to la-la land before we head back to yesterday. I have to say the going back in time has become the most annoying plot devise currently used today in movies and television. There should really be a moratorium on using it. What's worse in this movie, and this may ruin it a little, but not as much as watching it played off ruined the movie, but they never come back to this crash later in the movie unless I fell asleep and completely feel asleep.Early on we are also introduced to two black men, Larenz Tate (of the wrongfully shelved Love Money) and Chris Bridges (who you may, or more likely not know as Ludacris) who complain how a white woman clutches her husband as they come closer only to carjack the couple. And knowing Bridges is a rapper in real life only makes his soliloquy against the genre cheesier. The couple in question is Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality 1 & 2) and Brendan Frasier (Encino Man), who is the District Attorney who is mad that being robbed by a couple black dudes may hurt retaining the black vote in the next election.There's also yet another good cop, Ryan Phillippe (Mr. Reece Witherspoon), bad cop, Matt Dillon (Herbie: Fully Loaded) tandem who pull over a black couple just for fun and the black dude, Terrence Howard (Mary J. Blige's Be Without You video) just stands there and lets Dillon molest his wife, Thandie Newton (The Chronicles of Riddick). Just for fun, Haggis even threw in families full of Hispanics, Asians, and Arabs just so no one would feel left out. Well except the Indians are once again forgotten. At least you still have baseball teams that make light of your racial stereotypes.Each of the characters eventually intertwines with each other showing up in other storylines much like a Lost flashback.

Was it really that bad a year for movies?  ""Crash,""with its reliance on coincidence and wooden speeches on things related to race is both heavy handed and annoying.  You find yourself asking yourself again and again: do people really talk like this?  The use of coincidence is also over-the-top.  I'm okay with coincidence, but it has to be done with a light touch.  Movies such as ""Magnolia,"" or any number of Robert Altman efforts (not to mention Shakespeare), show just how to do this.  Director Haggis however has a blind eye to match his tin ear.  At one point you have racist cop Ryan (Matt Dillon) saving a woman he had recently felt up in an earlier traffic stop scene.  OK.  This is soon followed by Dillon's ex-partner confronting the husband of the felt up woman in a potential car-jacking incident.  Come on!  And that's just a small slice of the interconnectedness of ""Crash."" It's a small and racist world indeed.  Oh, and we need to get over it and see the real common humanity that we all share.  All to the accompanyment of a gloomy and swelling musical score - the kind that shows up in movies like ""The Killing Fields"" or ""Platoon."" There are a some good effective scenes in ""Crash,""that indeed convey the ugliness of racism.  In particular the traffic stop of a married couple (see above), which is also done without speeches.  Haggis for once lets the action take over.  It's ugly - and True.  You feel like taking a shower after the humiliation this couple suffers at the hands of Dillon's Officer Ryan.  Also effective is Dillon's saving of the same women a bit later.  The ""common humanity we share"" thing that Haggis is hitting us over the head with, bears fruit as Dillon frantically tries to free the woman from the flames (metaphor alert) that are streaking towards both of them.

920769,A1MHXA59Q9O0GV,B000A3XY5A,"Shazzy ""Shazzy""","[6, 7]","In Los Angeles, a questionable traffic stop by a bigoted cop (Matt Dillon) and his nervous partner (Ryan Phillippe) leave a married African-American couple (Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard) in pieces. When Peter (Larenz Tate) and Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) carjack the District Attorney's (Brendan Fraser) SUV, his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) goes on a racial tear to justify her own depression. Daniel (Michael Pena) is a quiet, polite Hispanic locksmith who finds aggression from a Persian family who loses everything in a store robbery he tried to prevent. And Graham (Don Cheadle) is an African-American detective looking for his lost little brother, forced to use his skin color to tow the company line when corruption rears its head in the department.Last year, writer Paul Haggis left audiences thunderstruck by the power of his screen writing adaptation of the heartfelt Oscar winner, ""Million Dollar Baby."" With ""Crash,"" Haggis returns behind the camera (after years of television work), and once again delivers a masterful movie-going experience.While covering a multitude of arguments and ideas, Haggis's theme for ""Crash"" centers on the thought of faulty human communication; the film suggests that people have grown cold to affection and respect, instead immediately using hatred and paranoia as a way of communicating with their fellow man, almost always with disastrous consequences. The L.A. backdrop to the film explores the intense racial loathing and confusion that plagues the city, and while I'm not a fan of using the tired metropolis as a location for any film, ""Crash"" almost couldn't be set anywhere else. The setting has just the right melting pot flashpoint posture to sell this seething tale, instilling the film with a realistic take on racial claustrophobia. Like many films, ""Crash"" makes Los Angeles look like hell on Earth. Yet, Haggis doesn't give in to that fear, and manages to find a palpable sense of hope behind the shattering of cultures and furious intolerance.The magic of ""Crash"" is that it balances melodrama and realism in a seamless way. Haggis and his brilliant cast often perform loudly and uncomfortably to generate the sickening feeling of despair that is being sought by the filmmaker. This is a film that deals with blinding rage, and while the story dangerously straddles the line between cartoonish and insightful, Haggis never lets the tone out of his control. He keeps the truth of the situation bubbling behind every scene, and exploits the audiences' own personal prejudices with his scripted moments of aggravation, bitterness, and incorrect racial assignment. These characters aren't simply evil people, just products of their environment, family, and frustrations; they ache in very human ways to connect and protect, but are stunted by their own fears and anger. Haggis's script marvelously connects the stories through an oft-used multi-character, crisscross structure (a favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson and Robert Altman), but the cinematic showiness of the associations found in the film are erased instantaneously by the emotional wallop the movie routinely delivers.As the film moves along (quite swiftly too), ""Crash"" grows stronger and stronger, until it feels that the screen has become one with the audience. I dare anyone not to recoil in horror as Jean yells about the untrustworthiness of a Mexican handyman, or as Anthony decries the negative Caucasian viewpoint of African-Americans while carjacking any automobile he can. In addition, some in the audience might need heart medication after witnessing Daniel and his angelic daughter at the business end of a gun in the picture's best sequence. The events in ""Crash"" roll forward without stopping, at times unbearably, yet they register strongly with their frankness and integrity.

It is just like a ""crash"" in many ways, difficult to watch and sometimes uncomfortable.It's a bit like Short Cuts with lots of different character, and so the plot is difficult to describe but I'll give it a go.This film is set in the glamourous and sometimes violent streets of LA, where everyone lives with a sense of suspicion about their fellow man (or woman). A wealthy white District Attourney is on the eve of a big election. He and his wife are car jacked by two black men who then go on the run. Meanwhile, a wealthy black couple are stopped by white police who harass them. The District Attourney hires a Mexican locksmith to change his locks, but his wife is suspicious of his gang tattoos. Everyone is suspicious of everyone else in this film, whether they're black, white, Chinese or Mexican. As events unfold, there are many twists and turns and you realise the bad guys aren't always bad, and the good guys aren't always good, a reminder that you can't judge a book by its cover. The message is clear - that everyone can be racist when it comes to it.There are powerful performances from Don Cheadle and Sandra Bullock as the hysterical DA's wife, as well as Matt Dillon as a racist cop.This is a good film to watch on DVD with a good bottle of wine and a friend. It really got us thinking well into the night. We spent a long time discussing it, about the prejudices we have had without realising them.This was a very powerful film that did not answer questions, only asked them of us.

The acting is excellent all around, the production is clearly big-budget, and the theme, racism, is anything but trivial.

Crash is actually just a formulaic drama that handles a delicate topic with less skill than a drunken Irishman handles sentence structure. In Swedish.The heavy-handed treatment of racism means that you'll see the protagonists, who are essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes, thrown into absurd situations that force them to confront the reality of their own racist attitudes. While this goes on a subtle soundtrack emphasizes the emotional detachment of the characters, rising to a crescendo only in scenes that might look good as sound-bytes for the Oscar Ceremony. As a viewer you're supposed to understand that this is all very sad and serious, but you're really just being manipulated into opening your mouth so they can shovel more bull**** down your throat.What Crash does best is to employ cool artistic and narrative styles it filched from far better films. You have the split storyline covering 3 or 4 independent narratives simultaneously , the tangential associations between characters that tie the narratives to each other, and the frequent use of filters to alter colors to parallel the emotional context of the scene.If the narrative itself had been handled with any sort of nuance then the stylistic imitations could be easily forgiven, but the focus of this film was never to tell a good story, but to wrap it in an Oscar worthy package.

I hope I don't disappoint (which - burn number one - this movie most certainly did).This is probably (burn number two) the most shallow look at race relations in the U.S. ever to be taken seriously.  I realize that there are many white liberals in this country that love to be reminded of how ""inherently racist"" they are.  This whitey doesn't accept that.  Many of my black, Indian, and East Asian friends have dubbed me an ""honorary woman of color,"" which is one of my proudest achievements.  I've earned it.  The makers of ""Crash"" (burn number three) wouldn't know how to fit me into their trite, contrived view of America.In a movie full of stereotypes, I think the characters played by Ludacris and Lorenz Tate really take the cake.  It's almost like (burn number four) they are supposed to represent a socially-conscious modern day black Abbott and Costello.  Where do people like this exist in reality?  They don't.  When Ludacris sets those illegals free, it is meant to be seen as a moment of redemption but in reality is a crime that deserves punishment.Some of the characters are not even racist.  Take Sandra Bullock's character for instance - she's not racist, just not very respectful of anyone regardless of race.  She's mean to everyone, therefore no one likes her.  And the Persian shopkeeper?  He's not so much a racist - he's just a stupid, distrustful moron.  Yet (burn number five) the movie strains to earn the audience's sympathy for these total jerks.Much like other unmitigated disasters such as ""Magnolia,"" this movie follows many story segments - with the various characters' lives occasionally criss-crossing one another.

920785,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,B000A3XY5A,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[6, 15]","Crash is a remarkable film directed by Paul Haggis, the man who wrote last year's Oscar winning film Million Dollar Baby, and featuring an all-star cast including Sandra Bullock (Speed), Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda), Matt Dillon (There's Something About Mary), Terrence Howard (Hustle And Flow), Ryan Phillipe (Cruel Intentions), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy), rapper Ludacris (Hustle And Flow), and Larenz Tate (Dead Presidents).The movie is delivered in subplots that eventually collide with one another into the overall main theme. The stories altogether are an honest depiction of American society today, a seriously ill society diagnosed with paranoia, bigotry, and ignorance.What Crash does so profoundly is focus our attention on regular people, and their motives to behave the way they do. For example, the racist Police Officer Ryan, played brilliantly by Dillon (who earned a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance); he hates black people, and doesn't hesitate to sexually harrass a black woman in front of her sophisticated husband, played by Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard respectively. The reason he hates black people is because his father was forced to leave his job for a black man. Besides the white versus black scenario, the movie also turns our attention to the Hispanics being viewed by the white upper class as gang bangers, and the Persians being mistaken for Arabs. There's also plenty of character development, the black police officer who has a drug addicted mother and a delinquent brother, two thieves who ironically discuss matters of racism in society, and an upper class white married woman who chastises everything and everyone including a decent Mexican whom she thinks is a gangster who comes to fix her door. As the movie draws nearer to its inevitable conclusion and final crash, we get a closer look at the cause of the illness itself and find that there might be a solution.Crash earned 3 Oscars (Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing) at this year's Academy Awards.

920786,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B000A3XY5A,S. Schell,"[4, 6]","It's a real case of beginner's luck for first-time director Paul Haggis.  Having already scored an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (Million Dollar Baby), Haggis takes the director's chair for this project and scores a big hit, one which won him Best Picture of 2005.  With an all-star cast, a haunting score by Mark Isham and a thought-provoking screenplay, ""Crash"" is a bold tapestry of humankind at their best and worst and the circumstances that eventually connect them all are a wonder to behold.All events within the film take place in a mere 24 hours (what a difference a day makes, eh?) with five different stories set in the melting pot of melting pots: Los Angeles, CA.  The film opens and ends with a fender bender (hence the title) and the delicate issue of bigotry is dealt with a mighty blow here, a series of life-altering events affecting and eventually connecting all of the following people:1) a black detective (Cheadle) and his Latino partner (Esposito)2) two young black felons (Ludacris, Tate)3) a white district attorney (Fraser) and his wife (Bullock)4) a Persian shop owner (Toub) and his family5) a Latino locksmith (Pena)6) two white LA police officers (Dillon, Philippe)7) an affluent black television producer (Howard) and his wife (Newton)How are all these people connected, you ask?  Well, if you've ever seen ""Traffic"", you'll get an idea of how each character manages to intersect the other in an odd ""six degrees of separation"".  There are four different stories happening all at once that will culminate at the end.  This is one of the many intriguing ways in which Haggis ties everything together into a coarse and pragmatic patchwork of life in these biased United States.Crash's biggest accomplishment comes from the manner in which it realigns its characters' perceptions by imposing life-altering situations upon them, incidents which change them for either the better or the worse.  While watching the characters' reactions to their environment, the audience is often forced to examine some of their own perceptions and ""Crash"" reveals time and again the bitter truth behind the majority of America's skewed philosophy.Don Cheadle is excellent as Graham, a man who struggles constantly with the meager symmetry of justice. Matt Dillon is intriguing as Officer Ryan, a cop whose motives can be hard to determine but whom experience has given an inarguable wisdom.  Bullock manages to play a character that's easy to hate, a pampered suburban wife who doesn't realize who her true friends are until she's literally crying out for help, one whom she least expects.  Terrence Howard is remarkable as a television producer whose educated wife (Newton) harangues him about life's everyday prejudices after they are pulled over in a routine traffic stop in a wealthy neighborhood by two white cops.  He is frustrated and angry with her but when he begins to see the fine lines of racism suddenly and heavily bleed into his life, he at first denies it, then proceeds into self-loathing and hatred.  He eventually forgives his wife and comes to terms with various other people for their misgivings.  Ryan Philippe impresses as the morally compromised Officer Hanson - there is a shocking moment in which he is truly tested on his obligations as an officer of the law and in that moment becomes the most hypocritical character of, despite having made perfectly clear his moral dilemma in the beginning.  Most everyone else walks on and walks off but there isn't a bad performance to be had here (not even from hip-hop star Ludacris) and this ensemble cast makes the most of everything they've got.Bottom line: There should be no argument as to what film has made the most impact in 2005 - one viewing of ""Crash"" will have you voting in its favor, hands down.",5,What We Perceive,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,3791,"['real', 'case', 'beginner', 'luck', 'first-time', 'director', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Having', 'already', 'scored', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Haggis', 'director', 'chair', 'project', 'big', 'hit', 'one', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', '2005', 'all-star', 'cast', 'haunting', 'score', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'thought-provoking', 'screenplay', 'Crash', 'bold', 'tapestry', 'humankind', 'best', 'worst', 'circumstances', 'eventually', 'connect', 'are', 'wonder', 'behold.All', 'events', 'film', 'take', 'place', 'mere', '24', 'hours', 'what', 'difference', 'day', 'eh', 'five', 'different', 'stories', 'set', 'melting', 'pot', 'melting', 'pots', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'CA', 'film', 'opens', 'fender', 'bender', 'hence', 'title', 'delicate', 'issue', 'bigotry', 'dealt', 'mighty', 'blow', 'here', 'series', 'life-altering', 'events', 'affecting', 'eventually', 'connecting', 'following', 'people:1', 'black', 'detective', 'Cheadle', 'Latino', 'partner', 'Esposito', '2', 'two', 'young', 'black', 'felons', 'Ludacris', 'Tate', '3', 'white', 'district', 'attorney', 'Fraser', 'wife', 'Bullock', '4', 'Persian', 'shop', 'owner', 'Toub', 'family5', 'Latino', 'locksmith', 'Pena', '6', 'two', 'white', 'LA', 'police', 'officers', 'Dillon', 'Philippe', '7', 'affluent', 'black', 'television', 'producer', 'Howard', 'wife', 'Newton', 'How', 'are', 'people', 'connected', 'ask', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Traffic', ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'character', 'intersect', 'other', 'odd', 'six', 'degrees', 'separation', 'are', 'four', 'different', 'stories', 'happening', 'once', 'will', 'culminate', 'end', 'one', 'many', 'intriguing', 'ways', 'Haggis', 'ties', 'everything', 'together', 'coarse', 'pragmatic', 'patchwork', 'life', 'biased', 'United', 'States.Crash', 'biggest', 'accomplishment', 'manner', 'characters', 'perceptions', 'imposing', 'life-altering', 'situations', 'incidents', 'change', 'better', 'worse', 'watching', 'characters', 'reactions', 'environment', 'audience', 'often', 'forced', 'examine', 'own', 'perceptions', 'Crash', 'reveals', 'time', 'again', 'bitter', 'truth', 'majority', 'America', 'skewed', 'philosophy.Don', 'Cheadle', 'excellent', 'Graham', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'meager', 'symmetry', 'justice', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'intriguing', 'Officer', 'Ryan', 'cop', 'motives', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'determine', 'whom', 'experience', 'given', 'inarguable', 'wisdom', 'Bullock', 'play', 'character', 'easy', 'hate', 'pampered', 'suburban', 'wife', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', 'who', 'true', 'friends', 'are', 'literally', 'crying', 'out', 'help', 'one', 'whom', 'least', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'remarkable', 'television', 'producer', 'educated', 'wife', 'Newton', 'life', 'everyday', 'prejudices', 'are', 'pulled', 'over', 'routine', 'traffic', 'stop', 'wealthy', 'neighborhood', 'two', 'white', 'cops', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'when', 'see', 'fine', 'lines', 'racism', 'suddenly', 'heavily', 'bleed', 'life', 'first', 'denies', 'then', 'self-loathing', 'hatred', 'eventually', 'wife', 'terms', 'various', 'other', 'people', 'misgivings', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'morally', 'compromised', 'Officer', 'Hanson', 'shocking', 'moment', 'truly', 'tested', 'obligations', 'officer', 'law', 'moment', 'most', 'hypocritical', 'character', 'having', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'beginning', 'Most', 'everyone', 'else', 'walks', 'off', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performance', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'not', 'even', 'hip-hop', 'star', 'Ludacris', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'most', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'got.Bottom', 'line', 'should', 'be', 'argument', 'what', 'film', 'made', 'most', 'impact', '2005', 'one', 'viewing', 'Crash', 'will', 'have', 'voting', 'favor', 'down']",Crash

It is as if some studio heads got together and said - 'hey why don't we make another pulpfiction this time focusing on race in L.a. What ensues is an offensive misguided work which feels too ambitious and too quote unquote real (which makes it seem less real) for its own good.. If i was going to make a movie on such heady material I would first look for a cast of people that do not have the star recognition that so often gets in the way with the material (which is trying to seem so real and commonplace).. Seeing big stars pop on the screen always interferes with this kind of realism (when vittorio de sica made 'bicycle thieves' he turned down cary grant to use the more ordinary working class nonactor who made the film so great)..

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[5, 19]","The controversial Best Picture Oscar winner, Paul Haggis' CRASH is an angry, very profane, and disturbing portrait of Los Angeles over about 24 hours in the lives of maybe twenty people of different races.  The vast and impersonal metropolis, where no one really sleeps, is brilliantly captured from early evening, to late night, to the wee hours up on Mulholland Drive, to blinding smoggy morning, to golden orange afternoon with a spectacular car crash, to night again.The leading players include Sandra Bullock (never better as a nasty West Side socialite who berates all of her hired help), Don Cheadle (as a black homicide detective and the closest thing to a leading actor here), Oscar nominee Matt Dillon (as a racist white patrolman about to retire and trying to take care of his dad), Terence Howard (as a decent black man whose wife is harrassed without cause by Dillon), Brendan Fraser as Bullock's  husband, and about a dozen others I don't really know, including a key Middle Eastern character.There is not a lot of plot in co-writer (with Bobby Moresco) Haggis' Oscar-winning screenplay.  On the West Side, white Bullock and D.A. husband Fraser fight a lot.  Dillon is called a ""racist prick"" by his own black boss and has Ryan Phillippe as his partner, who wants to be transferred to someone less volatile.  But Dillon has his good points, as he saves the life of a Hispanic woman pinned under a car in a bad car crash that is about to trigger a multi-car explosion.  Dillon is also fighting with an unfeeling black hospital supervisor (Loretta Devine) for medical care for his father.  He should have won the Supporting Actor Oscar.  Meanwhile, black Cheadle is a major homicide detective and a decent man whose only flaw is to call his Central American girl friend a Mexican.  Meanwhile, the Middle Eastern shop owner yells at a black locksmith to fix a lock on a door that needs replacing, but the locksmith says a door person needs to fix that so the lock change will be workable; the store owner adamantly says no, fix the lock, and his store is hopelessly vandalized that night-and his little daughter is shot at in a horrible crossfire scene.  CRASH is weak on storyline, but very strong on complex and interesting characters, provocative conflicts, and strong ensemble acting.It is also a visual tapestry of the various moods of Los Angeles around the clock.  The ""night for night"" Panavision is particularly impressive.  J. Michael Moro is the magnificent cinematographer, and Laurence Bennett is credited on the DVD box as production designer.  They know exactly where the freshest LA locales are and how to capture them by day, evening, and the dark night of the soul, when it is too hot to sleep and everyone seems to have insomnia.Should CRASH have beat crowdpleaser BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN?  It is like comparing apples and oranges; I prefer one on one day and the other on another day.  I am going to be unpopular and say CRASH is probably a better movie in terms of ambitions and results.  BROKEBACK is a wonderful and sad western that makes an important statement about gay relationships.  But I have a hunch that people able to get past its non-stop profanity are going to embrace CRASH as a brilliant and incendiary and gripping movie gem and discuss it decades from now as an important work of art.

920791,A32YHUCN7W8CBE,B000A3XY5A,Steve Chernoski,"[4, 8]","A lot of the other reviews have covered the basics here.  Here are just some random thoughts after watching this powerful, highly charged movie:The acting is superb.  It is a shame no one could really be nominated for any major awards because of the brevity of each on screen.The score by Mark Isham is near perfect.  I thought it heightened the drama of the scenes tremendously; maybe a little too much, but perhaps that is just me admitting that I was hit really hard emotionally.The ironic twists are amazing:  How the actions of Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe's characters swing in opposite directions that you expect them to.  Ludacris is amazing, I was very surprised.  His character's life was so close to being finished and instead he gives life to others.Don Cheatle's character is the one I was left feeling for the most.  It is that loss that stayed with me afterwards.The film may be panned by some people who think it is liberal hogwash just asking us to all get along and sing ""kum ba yah,"" but I don't know if that is the message.  More, it is showing us how our prejudices affect how we act and how those actions reverberate and affect others around us . . .  more than we think.  It battles with stereotypes, and definitely confronts political correctness in very complex ways that no one can dismiss.The last thing that should be applauded is that the film was not predictable.  Every scene where something dramatic was going to happen, I thought I saw the writing on the wall only to be surprised at each turn.

920792,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000A3XY5A,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[6, 12]","This film is as much about people living and feeling disconnected to others as it is about racism, which is an admittedly large focus of the film; however, it is interesting to see the interplay between the social orders within and beyond each racial group and to see how people can change rapidly and not always slowly over time.  I have personally witnessed people change on a dime due to a tragic moment in their lives.  It does happen and this film does focus on how that can happen to a series of individuals who initially seem unrelated to each other.  In addition, this film impressed me with the unpredictable situations many of the characters found themselves in and how some, as in real life, will only do what society expects of them.  Therefore, to label this film as being about racism is being overly simplistic and to further state that one disliked this film because he or she is tired of race relation films has nothing to do with the quality of the film and dismisses the importance of the race issue itself for if it wasn't an issue anymore, than we wouldn't have to make films or read books on it would we?  I guess as a teacher I can stop teaching ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" since we all live in racial harmony now, right?  Good grief, I still have KKK marches in my community, so please don't tell me that race isn't an issue anymore.If one is tired of the race theme in movies, and I do sincerely understand that position especially if one isn't racist himself, then by all means don't view movies or TV shows that cover it.  It's not that these films are bad or ineffective as much as the person who is no longer engaged with the topic finds the whole issue a drag and/or offensive since it isn't an issue for him anymore.  I can understand that as I, for instance, have no interest in ""gay-themed"" films, but on a lark I did rent ""Brokeback Mountain.""  I greatly disliked it, but much was do to the fact that it's content didn't interest me any.  The actors were very good and it was a beautifully photographed film, but my bias against it's topic really prevented me from writing an ""objective"" review; therefore, I never wrote one.As for the recent criticisms of this film being contrived or predictable, well, all films are to a degree as they have to be planned out and things do have to add up and come together, but one of the main commentaries/praises on this film is how the characters are rather unpredicatable and are thrown into unpredictable circumstances.  These kinds of criticisms remind me of the people who thought ""The Exorcist"" wasn't scary.  That's okay; I'm sure that really was the case for some; however, I think the truth is more along the lines of people wanting to be noticed as different with ""it scared America, but not me.""  I see that here with ""Crash.""  You get so many saying how surprised they were by how these lives inter-connected and then you get the ""Hey, notice me"" people shouting, ""Yeah, but not me, you suckers.  I saw the whole thing coming.""  Maybe so, but I have a tough time buying that.Okay, I rarely ever rant, but I felt compelled to regarding the negativism this film recently recieved.  After all the 4 and 5 stars reviews, it's interesting how a few come on now saying the film is 'a waste of time.'  It's not that someone can't disagree with the crowd; I've been known to do my share of that and did so with ""Running with Scissors"", but when the reasons are unsupported (oh, how I love those one sentence ""reviews"") and/or reek of a bias having little to do with the film itself, that is exactly what makes a review ""unhelpful' in my view.  I've clicked many a ""helpful"" review buttons even when I totally disagreed with a reviewer's stance on a film; however, in that instance, he or she at least provided better support than ""I'm tired of films about . . ."" or wrote unsupported one sentence ""reviews"" on how a film just ""sucked"" with little to no explanation.  One should give some weight to one's comments or the review itself is more a 'waste of time' than any film.Please don't feel offended it you honestly didn't like this film as all tastes are different and everyone is certainly entitled to his or her opinion just as I gave mine.  I don't mean to blast anyone here personally or think that I know better about films than others do.  My issue here has been the lack of support given by some reviewers for their viewpoint and the obvious insincerity that some of them contain even when they try to defend their position.  Normally, those types of reviews would go totally unnoticed by myself, but when they are connected to such weighty, timely, and important films like ""Crash"", they can't be so easily ignored.

Mostly things that you probably never knew.For instance, from watching this movie I learned that Racism is BAD. I know, right? Who would have thought? But yeah, it was cool to realize that.Another thing I learned is that everyone in the world is secretly a racist bigot. Seriously, all of us are total jerks when it comes to anyone not the same race as us. If you think you're not, then you just haven't realized it yet. You just wait. Sooner or later, something will happen that will prove what a complete bigot you are. You're probably a homophobe and vegetarian hater too - you just don't know it yet! This movie knows way more about human nature than you do. Don't question its incredible insight into human nature. Just accept that this is the way we all are. We all hate each other. Stop saying you don't hate others and just roll with it, because this movie knows best.The other thing I learned, which kind of goes with the second thing, is that since all other people are racist jerks, they are not to be trusted. Remember that Chinese guy you ran over the other day? (Yeah, happens a lot, I know.) Don't feel too sorry for him, because he was probably involved in human trafficking or some other such business. And that lady whose car got stolen? Don't worry about her - after all, she's mean to her maid. Kinda had it coming, really.Speaking of which, I thought Sandra Bullock's acting skill in this movie was really impressive. I wouldn't have thought it possible for her to maintain the same angry, unlikeable face over the course of the entire movie. But she pulled it off flawlessly. She kind of reminded me of the wife from Everybody Loves Raymond, minus any jokes.Also, Counselor Troi was in this movie. She looked kinda hot in a head scarf, just sayin'.It was cool to see Ludacris in this movie. At one point, his character launched into a monologue about the evils of rap music. I know... IRONY, am I right? (But he never did rap at all, so I've gotta knock 4 stars off my rating for this movie for that alone. If he had busted a rhyme in Sandra's face I woulda been totally on board with that, yo!)Also, this movie featured a car crash. Hence the title, ""Crash"".My only hope is that this movie will make a real difference in society. Such to the point that one day, all people in America will have equal rights.

Then again, it doesn't surprise me that it won the Oscar for Best Picture.  When you film a movie in L.A., cast one third of Hollywood in it, and weave a contrived story of race relations while employing a tired six-degrees-of-separation theme a la ""Magnolia,"" it shouldn't be surprising that so many viewers and critics overpraise it.  The screenplay is riddled with implausibilities and unrealistic dialogue, which threatens even the most solid performances.  I dig Ludacris, both the rapper and the actor (check him out in ""Hustle and Flow"" if you really want to see him act), but his preaching and sermonizing in this film grew shrill real fast.  Equally annoying was Sandra Bullock, going into overdrive as the stereotypically uptight rich white woman.  Faring much better were Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe, and, best of all, Matt Dillon, who richly deserved his Oscar nomination.  But while these actors do THEIR job, the filmmakers (director Paul haggis in particular) fail to do theirs.  ""Crash"" has good intentions, good performances and a few solid moments, but its execution is badly lacking.

It displays intricate construction and intelligent, if melancholy, exploration of race and class warfare, telling interlocking stories of different races, classes, cops and criminals alike.Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton head a superb group of ensemble actors, as several story threads intermingle over 2 days in a gritty visual of Los Angeles, an arena of prejudices spiraling out of control.These stories are examined with precision and realistic tension, and all merge to highlight today's stifling tribulations of intolerance and ethnic suspicion, elevated by the ever-increasing stress of day-to-day living.It's an intriguingly mixed cast, operating away from the racially harmonious zones we often observe.In a outstanding cast, the standout may be Dillon as Officer Ryan, the personality with the most extreme variation of evil and good, brutality and benevolence. A cynic who bullies people of color, he's also a devoted son caring for a dying father-and we come to see that the bad side of Ryan is a sheath grown over the good.But out of this chaos, ""Crash"" also suggests that acts of righteousness, mercy and compassion matter-that anyone, at any moment, can make a crucial difference.

This movie tells you what you know: that individuals are complicated and that they are motivated by summating input from wildly diverse sources. Reactions are not necessarily logical, but are internally consistent. We know this, right? However, this movie drags it all up by the scruff of it's neck and shoves it in your face and forces you to look at it in all its raging glory. All actions have repercussions that ripple out in bad and good ways. All lives interact without touching. We are insular and terrified of each other and for good reason sometimes.

It is not trite, it doesn't moralize, it has no specific ax to grind.The movie itself is beautifully shot, the performances are excellent all across the board. I definitely do not want to scare anyone off with the ""multiple story lines"" description because it all weaves together so well. The writing is excellent and satisfying.The overall story involves a night and a day in Los Angeles. There is an automobile accident involving multiple cars. The action unfurls and at first I thought the movie was going to be all about racism. Well, it's not. It is much deeper than that. The writer has used racism as an obvious hook to draw us into the much more complicated processes of these people's minds. We follow police work (Matt Dillon finally comes of age and excels), the DA's (Brendan Fraser) involvement with multiple processes including politics, crime, and his brittle and unhappy wife (Sandra Bullock), two young black men with chips on their shoulders, one of whom grows maybe a bit in the course of events and the other who is not given the chance. Into the mix comes an ex-gangbanger locksmith who protects his daughter, the only truly good ""angel"" figure in the whole mess, with a lie.

When Peter (Larenz Tate) and Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) carjack the District Attorney's (Brendan Fraser) SUV, his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) goes on a racial tear to justify her own depression. Daniel (Michael Pena) is a quiet, polite Hispanic locksmith who finds aggression from a Persian family who loses everything in a store robbery he tried to prevent. And Graham (Don Cheadle) is an African-American detective looking for his lost little brother, forced to use his skin color to tow the company line when corruption rears its head in the department.Last year, writer Paul Haggis left audiences thunderstruck by the power of his screen writing adaptation of the heartfelt Oscar winner, ""Million Dollar Baby."" With ""Crash,"" Haggis returns behind the camera (after years of television work), and once again delivers a masterful movie-going experience.  While covering a multitude of arguments and ideas, Haggis's theme for ""Crash"" centers on the thought of faulty human communication; the film suggests that people have grown cold to affection and respect, instead immediately using hatred and paranoia as a way of communicating with their fellow man, almost always with disastrous consequences. The L.A. backdrop to the film explores the intense racial loathing and confusion that plagues the city, and while I'm not a fan of using the tired metropolis as a location for any film, ""Crash"" almost couldn't be set anywhere else. The setting has just the right melting pot flashpoint posture to sell this seething tale, instilling the film with a realistic take on racial claustrophobia. Like many films, ""Crash"" makes Los Angeles look like hell on Earth. Yet, Haggis doesn't give in to that fear, and manages to find a palpable sense of hope behind the shattering of cultures and furious intolerance.The magic of ""Crash"" is that it balances melodrama and realism in a seamless way. Haggis and his brilliant cast often perform loudly and uncomfortably to generate the sickening feeling of despair that is being sought by the filmmaker. This is a film that deals with blinding rage, and while the story dangerously straddles the line between cartoonish and insightful, Haggis never lets the tone out of his control. He keeps the truth of the situation bubbling behind every scene, and exploits the audiences' own personal prejudices with his scripted moments of aggravation, bitterness, and incorrect racial assignment. These characters aren't simply evil people, just products of their environment, family, and frustrations; they ache in very human ways to connect and protect, but are stunted by their own fears and anger. Haggis's script marvelously connects the stories through an oft-used multi-character, crisscross structure (a favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson and Robert Altman), but the cinematic showiness of the associations found in the film are erased instantaneously by the emotional wallop the movie routinely delivers.As the film moves along (quite swiftly too), ""Crash"" grows stronger and stronger, until it feels that the screen has become one with the audience. I dare anyone not to recoil in horror as Jean yells about the untrustworthiness of a Mexican handyman, or as Anthony decries the negative Caucasian viewpoint of African-Americans while carjacking any automobile he can. In addition, some in the audience might need heart medication after witnessing Daniel and his angelic daughter at the business end of a gun in the picture's best sequence.

A Caucasian couple deals with the aftermath of being carjacked. A Latino father tries to shield his daughter from the effects of racism in their community. A Black police detective has difficulty sharing his problems with his Puerto Rican partner and lover. Two white cops deal with the older partner's racist leanings. A Black couple deals with racism on a daily basis.""Crash"", written and directed by Paul Haggis (""Million Dollar Baby"", TV's ""EZ Streets"") handles all of these characters, and more, in a way that demands your undivided attention. As you watch these characters come alive and interact with one another, you realize that you are watching the work of a highly skilled filmmaker.It is difficult to write about a film like ""Crash"". If I write in too much detail, I may give away a revelation or two, spoiling something in the film. If I write in vague terms, I won't be able to address the film adequately and convince you of the film's greatness. Oh, yes, ""Crash"" is a great film.I have just barely grazed the surface of everything that happens to the various characters. The descriptions above also only graze the surface of each of the characters. In a way, the film resembles ""Short Cuts"" or ""Magnolia"", as it follows a large number of people through a short amount of time in Los Angeles. Unlike the films by Altman or Anderson, Haggis keeps the film under two hours, a blessing for most viewers. As you watch the film, you will learn about each of these people in ways that you probably won't expect. This is one involving, thought provoking film.As the film opens, we meet the two men coming out of the restaurant. Their discussion is interesting and a bit funny, but a little theatrical. Soon, we meet another couple. Then these two couples interact. Quickly, we meet a third person. Then they interact with one of the previous people and we follow the new person to their home and learn a little about their family life. Then we meet a fourth, and quickly, they interact with a fifth, and so on. This sort of `round robin' method of story telling may sound a little confusing, but I was never lost and I doubt you will be either. The key is that each character is quickly established as an interesting though maybe disgusting, maybe normal, maybe conflicted person right away. Each person is fused into our subconscious with a few words or actions.As the film switches back and forth, Haggis uses a number of techniques to keep the action fluid. For instance, we might follow the detective during a visit to his mother's house. As he leaves, he opens a door and the camera pans across the open door to follow the white District Attorney as he enters a meeting. Or, a character looks out a window and the camera pans across the window to reveal another character looking through their window. As the camera settles on them, the story then centers on this character. This technique creates a fluidity that keeps things moving. It also thrusts us into the middle of the action, causing our minds to keep working as we follow the stories, the characters, and the actions. Your eyes will be riveted to the screen the whole time.Much of the beauty of the screenplay and directing is that each character is quickly established and becomes memorable. One character is introduced with a monologue revealing their deep-seated racism. It is a memorable scene. In the hands of most filmmakers, this would be the extent of exploration for this character. In the hands of Haggis, we then learn the more subtle aspects of this same character. Later, more examples of the character's racism. Then more about the same person's life. This leads to a very complete portrait of this person. Imagine the same level of detail applied to the other ten or eleven characters and you begin to get a feeling of the complexity of ""Crash"".It would be difficult to classify any of the actors as the ""star"" of the film. It is a true ensemble piece. Each of the very good actors is playing a small role, but the roles are integral to the overall fabric of the story. Each actor is memorable. Don Cheadle, apparently the first person approached, read the screenplay and immediately signed on. He also helped to get the other actors involved in the project. His performance is, as always, great. Cheadle plays Graham, the black detective He is a tough guy, but what lies beneath the toughness? What caused him to have such a bleak outlook? During the course of the film, we learn these things, adding dimension to his character. Jennifer Esposito plays his partner, Ria. Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser play a married couple, each of whom has to deal with issues of racism, in different, believable ways. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton play an affluent married couple. He is a successful television director who doesn't at first realize what he is dealing with when he and his wife have an encounter with two cops. This encounter is especially harrowing and hard to watch. It is also done in a completely believable manner, which makes it all the more disturbing. Those cops are played by Matt Dillon (in another great performance) and Ryan Phillippe. Michael Pena is particularly memorable as the Latino father. He is not well-known. Yet. Another couple of roles like this and he will break out of character actor roles. Ludacris and Larenz Tate play the two men who discuss their service at the restaurant in Westwood. Their performances are perhaps the most theatrical, and least believable, but they still work. They frequently have long conversations similar to the ""Quarter Pounder in France"" dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John  Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"". There are many more equally memorable characters, but these are the most recognizable names.If it seems like I am holding back some information, I am. I don't want to reveal how these characters interact, completely, because that is part of the power of the film. As the stories progress, and we meet the characters, they keep changing, or encountering unexpected incidents. Part of the film's impact is the surprise we experience as these people's lives change throughout. Also, it is interesting to watch the sort of ""Round Robin"" style of storytelling I mentioned before.""Crash"" takes place over 36 hours in Los Angeles. The scenes set during the day are bright, a bit overexposed and grainy from bright sun. Some of the transitions are also caused by bright flashes of sun. Transitioning to night, there is little difference, because Los Angeles is so inundated with light. When the characters move to less populated areas, the film becomes darker, and grainier, due to the lack of light. This visual style fits the setting. It is more than a little refreshing to find a filmmaker who creates a film that has a lot of artistic flourish, but the flourishes only enhance the story. Too often filmmakers feel it necessary to show all of the tricks they can do, whether it serves the story or not. Haggis does show off some tricks, but they don't feel intrusive.If it sounds like I'm gushing, I am. ""Crash"" is a great film. This is the type of film that should humble other filmmakers when they realize that someone has written and created something so great.  How can they ever compare. Maybe ""Crash"" will spur artists to create more great films.",5,A Great Movie You Must See,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,7460,"['Two', 'young', 'Black', 'men', 'walk', 'Italian', 'restaurant',

There are car accidents, sure, but the essential nature of the movie is people just trying to get by. They make assumptions about each other. They do horrible things. Race effects how they interact with each other (maybe a trifle too much. Hence the melodrama label. There's really no subtlety in the racism.) and leads them to assume and do horrible things.One of the fascinating things about this movie is the way there really are no villains. You see the ""villains"" (especially Matt Damon's racist cop and the 2 carjackers) enough to learn their stories and understand some of what makes them tick. Everyone has a story and something that makes them sympathetic.

920828,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000A3XY5A,Tom Benton,"[4, 10]","""Crash"" is a film that revolves around racism and bigotry, and as such it's no surprise that it's become such a controversial film.  It was a major achievement for it to garner the Best Picture Oscar (which arguably ""Sin City"" actually deserved, but one doesn't expect the Academy to bestow awards to those films which truly deserve them), but although it did, and although Roger Ebert proclaimed it the ""Best Film of 2005"" (though the film actually premiered in 2004), ""Crash"" has been viewed rather negatively by the general public.  It's probably because most people won't be able to sit through 15 minutes of the film without becoming furious and frustrated to the point where they stop watching.""Crash"" essentially focuses on a group of ordinary people living in Los Angeles and how racism affects their lives.  The first half of the film boils with anger, hostility, and, of course, racism.  There was more than one point in the film where I wondered just what point writer/director Paul Haggis was trying to make.  The second half, however, makes it all worth it.  In the second half of the movie, the lives of the first half's characters interweave, each person affecting each other more than they'll ever know.  Everything comes together.  At one point in the film, a character says, ""You think you know who you are?  You have no idea.""  By the end of the film's second half, each of its characters know just who they are, and we do too.  In each of these apparently despicable racists or wrongdoers, there is a good person who, when it comes down to it, can overcome their racism without thought.  At its core, ""Crash"" points out that life is like a car bound to crash, gathering speed through every moment of our lives.  Who you are before the crash isn't important - it's who you are afterward that matters.Paul Haggis, who showcased his screenwriting talents with his script for Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby,"" proves with ""Crash"" that he is every bit as talented a director as a writer.  ""Crash"" is an empassioned, initially sickening and ultimately beautiful portrait of humanity and its triumph over the negative aspects of society.  The script, written by Haggis and Bobby Moresco, is magnificently-written and intricately plotted.  The dialog sounds effortlessly realistic, helped by the performances of a very talented cast.  The cast is highlighted by Matt Dillon's portrayal of a vile member of the L.A.P.D., who in the film's most powerful scene is suddenly transformed into a caring, selfless human being.  All this is captured by James Muro, who shoots the movie as though each frame is a painting.In the end, that's what ""Crash"" feels like: a dazzling mosiac of ordinary people and how they inevitably collide.  I can understand the negative response to the movie - as I've said, I too was tempted to shut it off about fifteen minutes into the first half.  But anyone who still feels that the movie is trash after watching it for its entire duration is missing the point.  It's a masterwork about life and the momentum we gather with every beat of our hearts, until finally we collide, shattering ourselves into disjointed pieces.  And the message of ""Crash"" is that it's not who you were before you fell to pieces: it's who you are after you piece yourself back together.",5,"""Come on now!

While advances in the sixties have removed most institutional racism, the de facto kind still persists everywhere -- just look at the yahoos in the Tea Party. This country has been waiting for an open and honest discussion of race relations that respects the feelings of others without compromising its objectivity.And if Crash is any indication, they'll have to keep waiting. So named because of the sound of its own plot contrivences colliding with eachother, Crash takes the bold move of seeking to unite its ethnically diverse cast-- Whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Arabs (represented here by Persians)-- in the firm moral position that Asians are crappy drivers and traffic in other human beings. Very progressive.But what makes this film stand out in medicority is the staggering scope of plot contrivence used to force the crude and heavy handed moral message. We have a bigoted cop put in position to save the black married woman he molested, a racist trophy wife is cared for by her latino maid after falling down the stairs, and a latter day Black Panther of a carjacker finds himself robbing a black man due to the social conventions of his trade. Detective Don Cheadle was doing something with a racist cop shooting a genuinley crooked black cop, but he mostly just phoned in everything after his post-coital dialogue.This film is simply the most pathetic Best Picture winner since James Cameron and his unsinkable ego (yes, it beat out both Gay Cowboys and Attack of the Killer Jews). Adding insult to injury is the potential that was blown in favor of a cheap moral message. Out of the entire two hour running time, only two conversations stood out as being written by someone other than Hallmark: the rant by the aformentioned kill whitey car thief in which he laments the state of race relations in America and how even in an upscale part of LA, all the white people are scared of the two black guys. His partner points out that it's because they have guns, so they carjack Brendan Frazer.You cannot go wrong with carjacking Brendan Frazer! If the movie had just stuck to the formula of ranting and then carjacking, it might have deserved that Oscar. No, the only other scene to approach such sublime truth is a snippy line by Don Cheadle where he asks his latina girlfriend who exactly gathered all the diverse Spanish-speaking immigrants together and taught them how to put cars up on cinderblocks in their front yards.But we return again to plot contrivence, which this movie has in more than spades. While the order of events is long enough to confuse the average NASCAR fan, it is still a predictable pattern that leads the semi-fluent Persian shopkeeper to blame a latino locksmith for vandalism and attempts to shoot him. Naturally, the locksmith's daughter runs out to save him with an earlier plot contivence, and both are saved by another plot contrivence from the beginning of the movie. Similarly, the least racist cop in LA shoots a black guy because he gets a little jumpy. Oh, and did I mention the black guy is the carjacker's partner, and Don Cheadle's brother (who mama loves more, despite being a deadbeat crook), who's body is examined in the morgue by the shopkeeper's daughter, who baught the gun and loaded it with blanks so he didn't kill the daughter of the locksmith who made the trophy wife of the district attorney trying to make Don Cheadle throw support behind scrubbing a racist cop who was nontheless doing his job properly nervous with his shaved hispanic head? And the carjacker's partner carjacked the husband of the molested woman and he flipped out but was saved by the Only Racially Tolerant White Cop who then shoots the hapless yob that was the focus of these two sentences? Isn't that clever!? Have I sufficiently laid out how this plot is just Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon!?!Crash is the sort of movie that wins awards in America.

I never noticed Ryan Phillipe before but he impressed me as a cop with a conscience. Matt Dillion was very convincing as a thuggish, lonely cop with home problems that have shaped his views on race relations. Then there is the Persian shop keeper, a stranger in a strange land, frightened, angry and numbed by the crime that has affected his family. There are several other known actors in this film, some of whom provide among their best performances, but the lesser known folks also shine. No one is made to seem one-dimensional and none of the scenes are wasted.There was one riveting scene that almost brought tears to my eyes involving our Persian shopkeeper where he goes over the edge, desensitized by the vacuum of crime and his feeling like a victim, due to his own foolish prejudices.Rapper Ludicriss plays one of the carjackers, but in his first scene, he and his partner (whose significance we learn later on in the film) are seemingly innocent, intelligent and harmless guys, out for a night outside their home area and feeling like victims in the white neighborhood. The film doesn't hestitate to play the race card, showing what many of us feel but are sometimes too ashamed to admit.Crash, not to be confused with the David Cronenberg 1996 film of the same name, is one of the best films that I have seen this year.

Come on, this movie won BEST MOVIE of 2006 and it is selling for less than $10 bucks? Do you know why? Our beloved Amazon is just passing the savings from the studio on to you, so they are innocent in this scheme. The studio priced this movie to sell cheap so they could move a lot of DVDs and proclaim it outsold Brokeback Mountain and even Walk the Line, which was a great movie too. I think it's more the mind-controlling fundies who probably had a hand in that, but I'm not here to start preaching. This movie was ok. I liked the fact it tried to explore the deeper psyche of prejudice, and found it ironic that in doing so it became movie of the year so people would not have to face their own prejudice against homosexuals, or love that does not 'fit in the box'. As this movie explored deep seeded situations where we face our own racial prejudice....which is from all sides, I might add, American society remains ignorant to their own prejudice not against homosexualty, because any type of love felt by most but not talked about, discussed or even faced. Love is love. And that message is much stronger than the message of Crash, which was hate is hate. You decide which DVD to buy, and which message should have won best picture for 2006.

920843,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000A3XY5A,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 14]","Perhaps the film may be slightly overrated, but it is still true that `Crash' keeps giving us compelling portraits of the people among the racial conflicts in Los Angels. That does not necessarily mean that you have to take every incident in the film too seriously. Some critics complain rightly that there are too many coincidences and ridiculous situations, and even the stories and characters that tried to be multi-layered and complicated sometimes look very forced and contrived. The film's strength lies in the joy of listening to a good storyteller, and Paul Haggis certainly has that talent.For all the flaws that nearly reach pretentiousness, `Crash' has a riveting ensemble cast that represents people divided by the racial divisions, who do not crash each other in the normal orbit of life. But when they do, something happens. When an Iranian grocery store owner is badly treated in a gun shop, or when a white cop searches the body of a black female on the street, or when two blacks carjack a white man's car, these incidents all lead to another surprising events that even the characters themselves cannot foretell.Yes, the ever-going changes of scenes and the interaction between the characters might remind you of Tarantino's style at his best, and director Paul Haggis never gets you bored with his considerable storytelling helped by skillful editing. Still it must be said that sometimes his script shows unbelievable chain of events that might be suitable only for TV sitcoms (especially that part about Don Cheadle and Terence Howard`s character), and some scenes are clearly meant to be very provocative, instead of just being thought-provoking.Some names in the cast such as Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock might attarct you initially, but though their acting is good, their roles are least satisfactory in the entire list of characters, almost unnecessary ones. Instead, Don Cheadle, Terence Howard, and Chris `Ludacris' Bridges are most impressive, but there are lots of good acting (from, say, Matt Dillon and William Fichtner) and it is hard to choose the best. That is no surprise for even Ryan Phillippe and Thandie Newton are good.Though the film is flawed with its prolonged coda, and offers no new insightful views on the racial issues, `Crash' is a well-acted, well-written drama that is constantly engrossing with Haggis' deft direction and capable actors, like a real page-turner.",4,(3.5 STARS) Good Storytelling?

It's also a movie about how we are all connected to each other and that despite the differences in our skin color, cultural heritage, and lifestyle choices we are more alike than we would like to admit.The movie is an ensemble film that examines a wide variety of people in different parts of L.A. The film illustrates how their lives interact, or crash into each other, and how the varied views of race and culture come into play throughout their lives. There are times that the movie is quite violent and even without the violence, the film is still rather harsh because of its brutal honesty. The film has been criticized because its portrayal of race has been said to be riddled with stereotypes and generalizations. There is some truth to the criticisms, but just a nugget. CRASH uses the stereotypes and generalizations that so many of we Americans use and throws it in our face to show us how wrong we can be and how we are only crippling ourselves.CRASH opens with a car crash and ends with another. These crashes are literal, but they are also metaphorical as to what happens throughout the movie. A young man is shot. A white couple is carjacked. A Hispanic man tries to protect his daughter from gang violence in their neighborhood. A respected black couple are pulled over by a white cop who physical abuses the wife. A black police officer finds it a challenge to communicate with his Puerto Rican lover. A middle Eastern man tries to protect his business from neighborhood thugs. Each of these characters lives interact with one another. Most of them are oblivious to how connected they are but some become aware of the beauty and wonder of life as their lives crash into each other.CRASH was written and directed by Paul Haggis. He was inspired to write the film after he and his wife were carjacked. Haggis is an extremely talented writer he brings the characters to life and fills them with a realistic vitality so that the characters rise above the expected stereotypes they are presumed to be. Not only that, but Haggis uses some brilliant film techniques to keep the action of the film moving. With an ensemble cast of around twenty major characters, CRASH could have easily become bogged down, but Haggis doesn't allow that. The story keeps moving and like life itself, each moment is fresh.The ensemble cast includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Tony Danza, Loretta Devine, Matt Dillon, Michael Pena, Jennifer Eposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, and Ryan Phillippe to just name a few. CRASH won the 2005 Oscar for Best Picture as well as the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.The film is not for everyone. It moves in a linear fashion, but instead of focusing on just a few characters weaves it's tale through many characters. I know there are some people who do not enjoy this type of filmmaking.

920846,A3KLC5M7K1C5FJ,B000A3XY5A,Vato-Curandero,"[7, 23]","Crash, recently coronated Best Picture of 2006, is one of the few blockbuster films of the past 20 years that has tried to deal with racism in a meaningful, honest way. Although I don't think Crash is the greatest race relations movie ever produced (that honor belongs to Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing), Crash does come in second place. This film is important viewing for all Americans of all ethnic backgrounds.As America becomes more racially, culturally, and ethnically diverse, what will be the social implications? Will greater diversity bring different races together or further divide us? The message of Crash is that the future is what we make of it.Don Cheadle leads an all-star cast as a Los Angeles detective investigating a string of recent murders. His partner (played by Jennifer Esposito) is also his girlfriend, although he has not progressed beyond his own simplistic stereotypes and realized that she is not automatically Mexican because she is of Latina descent. Meanwhile, Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) is fed up and burned out with his job and life in general. His blue-collar father missed out on the American Dream, and the son holds ""minorities"" and ""special programs"" responsible for this - fueling a rage against all people of color. Rap-star Ludicrous and his sidekick are the type of people that Ryan hates: young, black, urban males with criminal backgrounds. Terrance Howard and Thandie Newton are a happily married couple, until Howard finally snaps at being forced to live a double life - neither ""black"" enough for his wife, nor ""white"" enough for his supervisors. And the list of characters goes on and on...Most discussions of race in America tend to focus on a strict black-white paradigm. Crash advances beyond this dichotomy as it indtroduces characters of Middle Eastern/Muslim, Mexican-American, Latina, and Asian descent into the plot. Although some characters in Crash are straight-up stereotypes (Ludicrous as the dangerous black male, Matt Dillon as the working-class white racist, and Sandra Bullock as the uppity bigoted white snob), there is enough character variety overall in this film: some characters are fiesty, others are more mellow, and some are middle of the road.Crash offers no solutions and takes no sides.

However, this movie was also a bit over the top, unrealistic, and at times inane. There are some touching moments, but you don't really feel connected with the characters, so it makes it hard to even care about the significance of how they got their redemption. As i said, brilliant cast, but not necessarily a brilliant set of characters. Obviously, this movie is about the dangers of modern day racism, but unfortunately it focuses on that theme SO MUCH that the characters come off as lackluster and boring. We don't really get a chance to know who these people are before they get molested, shot, yelled at, whatever. And the racial sterotypes they touched upon were just ridiculous in the dialogue (like when a white man says to a black women on the phone, ""Shaniqua? What a surprise..."", or when a black man tells his mom on the phone that he's f***** a white woman when she's really hispanic...c'mon...). I didn't know what this movie was about until I decided to rent it to see what all the hype is for...obviously, I get the point of this movie: Racism is alive today, and it's just as dangerous now as it was then. But with all the  silly sterotypes, yelling, people randomly shooting each other (or trying to), and people constantly talking about racial issues (so much that it seriously loses the reality that the movie is trying to portray...), it makes this movie come off as being too pretentious.

920850,A1IN3AZD6NZRSG,B000A3XY5A,wadrad,"[9, 15]","Wow.  Been a long time since I saw a movie so willing to toss human nature so nakedly under a microscope like ""Crash"" does.  Ignoring some of the more prominent human shortcomings like greed, vanity, or envy, ""Crash"" zeroes in on the one trait that seems to make people squirm uncomfortably in a way similar to imagining your own parents having wild sex... you... just... don't... want... to... talk about it.  And that oft-denied, unnerving aspect of human nature is racial prejudice.In what starts out as seemingly just another cop story in Los Angeles, we're presented an assorted list of characters of varying race and background, whose story lines are loosely interlaced and whose racial preconceptions help them filter and try to come to grips with (rather ineffectively in some cases) the collisions of their lives in random happenstance.""Crash"" jumps right in with both feet showing us examples of bitter blatant racial characterizations from multiple racial groups towards multiple other racial groups.  We see two young black men, bickering back and forth about whether they have or haven't been victims of stereotyping, only to have them steal an expensive car at gun point in a predominantly white part of town.  A heavily accented Asian woman threatens to call immigration on a fluently-English-speaking Latino woman.  A black man references the ""Mexican woman"" he's just been sleeping with whose parents are actually from Puerto Rico and another Central American country (not Mexico).  An Iranian immigrant's store is vandalized with spray-painted slurs about him being Arab (hopefully most of you reading this realize Persians/Iranians aren't Arabic).  And there are plenty more uneasy depictions of people unfortunately acting prejudiced, biased, hypocritical or just plain ignorant.  Though some of examples come across a bit preachy at times, the impact of the message still carries weight.What's the point to it all?  I'd have to say the main idea to this movie is to show that racial prejudice shows no racial prejudice.  Even the most racially stereotyped and demeaned people can turn around and racially stereotype and demean other people.  And seeing it that way, maybe the real message in the movie is that we all really are more alike that we'd like to admit.  To different degrees, we ALL judge people by the way they dress, look, act, speak, or walk...for good or ill...and in that way, we're really not so different.Sounds a little heavy, eh?  Well, it is, but this movie and its message are delivered in a way that is deceptively subtle.  The blows are obvious, but the impact doesn't leave you black and blue, mostly just reflective.  The glass is half full AND half empty in this movie...there's loss AND redemption...yin AND yang...Very good flick, makes you think...not perfect, but damn good.

Happily, it does not attempt to attach such sin to one or another specific ethnic group -- whether black, white, Korean, Cambodian, Mexican, El Salvadoran, Persian or any of the other groups that show up in this aggressively diverse drama. We have here an equal-opportunity movie about sin, though it's probably not an accident that the unfortunate soul who has the most to learn is a white male. Nevertheless, the movie is redemptive in its good-hearted attempt to bring all of humankind under the big tent of guilt.So, the film meets a basic moral test. And yes it also meets a basic test of being entertaining. A stellar cast does a more than creditable job of dramatizing the interlaced set of plots that thrusts love up against loss, guilt against self-righteousness, and so on and so forth. I'm grateful for the various actors who were persuaded to play against type here: Brendan Fraser playing a seasoned DA, Sandra Bullock playing an ill-tempered witch, Matt Dillon in a part with little humor. Don Cheadle, the most gorgeous and talented male actor on the scene, already exceeds any part in which he is cast. Aesthetically and intellectually, then, the film is in harmony with itself.Nonetheless, it is a bit heavy-handed in delivering its moral message. Um, that message is that we should not stereotype each other based on race (play that out against a lush rap sound track and a lot of pious tripe about how nobody in LA ever touches each other and you will have some sense of why this film seduced Hollywood in the most recent academy awards).Even so, I liked the film. I'd even watch it again. The multiple story lines make it a kind of  ""Love Actually"" played out against a much more challenging background.

I'd heard the noise around it and thought it seemed too similar to Short Cuts, Grand Canyon, Magnolia sort of films. I've always kind of liked those and kinda had problems with them. I expected the same with this one, but it actually holds together with an original, honest and believable take on the present state of race relations in America.But, having said that, this works because the focus remains with the individual characters. They're all believable. Their flaws are credible. Their prejudices are not without merit. That's one of the things that makes this good. It doesn't try to say that anybody who has a racist thought is awful. That sort of simplification is why we never get anywhere. It's much more interesting to let believable characters say things that many people think but rarely say in public. I do think, however, that people say an awful lot of things in the privacy of their own home, with a spouse, or when they're one on one with somebody who doesn't have the power to call them on their racism. This happens. This film, fortunately, lets us glimpse moments like these.I read some of the negative reviews below mine.

Harboring racist views toward others groups (or their own) seems to be another tie that binds them together, in this film that exposes stereotypes across nearly every ethnic group.Whites, blacks, Latinos, Arabs, Asians, rich, poor, etc.  All classes and races are covered, and everyone is depicted as being unforgiving and unaccommodating to those outside of their own group.  Crash attempts to show that everyone is somehow a victim of racism and also a propitiator of it.The most memorable characters among the ensemble cast include Matt Dillon as a cop who does a good job explaining the pragmatic reasons behind his racism and Don Cheadle as a detective trying to do right by his drug-inflicted family.  Those are only two of the remarkable performances by a cast that should (in a just world) receive the majority of the supporting acting nominations this year.  From top to bottom, the cast is that good.  But the number of great performances will probably cancel each other out, leaving Crash unjustly underrepresented during the awards season.At times, the film is a ""one trick pony"", as it seems to only be about race.  It becomes a bit unbelievable, because racist assumptions and beliefs drive every major plotline.  At some point, the viewer should begin to wonder if there isn't more to these people than just their races and their views of other races.  Doesn't conflict and drama result from ""other"" things?With that said, Crash is one of the most innovative and intriguing films of the year.  Some of the highest praise I can see comes from the desire to faithfully depict the races.  Black viewers will think blacks are unfairly depicted, whites will think whites are unfairly depicted, etc.  So, since no group is proud of the behavior of their own race, the film probably has it about right.Each plotline contains high drama and rewarding resolution, but the film offers little direction on how to solve the problems it identifies.  Rather than giving answers, Crash tries to be a wake-up call to viewers, displaying how the world suffers because of our inability to get along.",4,The year's best preformances are found here,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,2247,"['leads', 'Crash', 'screen', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'string', 'fantastic', 'supporting', 'characters', 'linked', 'together', 'form', 'crisis', 'Harboring', 'racist', 'views', 'others', 'groups', 'own', 'be', 'tie', 'together', 'film', 'stereotypes', 'nearly', 'ethnic', 'group.Whites', 'blacks', 'Latinos', 'Arabs', 'Asians', 'rich', 'poor', 'etc', 'classes', 'races', 'are', 'covered', 'everyone', 'depicted', 'being', 'unforgiving', 'unaccommodating', 'own', 'group', 'Crash', 'attempts', 'show', 'everyone', 'somehow', 'victim', 'racism', 'also', 'propitiator', 'it.The', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'include', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'cop', 'who', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'pragmatic', 'reasons', 'racism', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'detective', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'drug-inflicted', 'family', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'cast', 'should', 'just', 'world', 'receive', 'majority', 'supporting', 'acting', 'nominations', 'year', 'top', 'bottom', 'cast', 'good', 'number', 'great', 'performances', 'will', 'probably', 'cancel', 'other', 'out', 'leaving', 'Crash', 'unjustly', 'underrepresented', 'awards', 'season.At', 'times', 'film', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'only', 'be', 'about', 'race', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'racist', 'assumptions', 'beliefs', 'drive', 'major', 'plotline', 'point', 'viewer', 'should', 'begin', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'more', 'people', 'just', 'races', 'views', 'other', 'races', ""n't"", 'conflict', 'drama', 'result', 'other', 'things', 'said', 'Crash', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'intriguing', 'films', 'year', 'highest', 'praise', 'can', 'see', 'desire', 'faithfully', 'depict', 'races', 'Black', 'viewers', 'will', 'think', 'blacks', 'are', 'unfairly', 'depicted', 'whites', 'will', 'think', 'whites', 'are', 'unfairly', 'depicted', 'etc', 'So', 'group', 'proud', 'behavior', 'own', 'race', 'film', 'probably', 'right.Each', 'plotline', 'high', 'drama', 'rewarding', 'resolution', 'film', 'little', 'direction', 'how', 'solve', 'problems', 'Rather', 'giving', 'answers', 'Crash', 'be', 'wake-up', 'call', 'viewers', 'displaying', 'how', 'world', 'suffers', 'inability', 'get', 'along']",Crash
920858,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000A3XY5A,Westley,"[5, 9]","""Crash"" is a solid drama exploring the complexities of race relations in modern America, specifically Los Angeles.  The movie opens with the aftermath of a minor car crash, which serves as a metaphor for the lives of the Angelinos in this film; they're all seemingly disoriented.  A number of inter-locking stories subsequently unfold - some of them can stand on their own, others are told in fragments that add to the overall tapestry in clever ways.  As such, it can be compared favorably to such multi-character movies as ""Magnolia"" and ""Short Cuts.""The best aspect of ""Crash"" is its multi-layered nature.  In the end, none of the characters come off as angels.  Those who initially seem open-minded and non-racist slowly show themselves as otherwise, sometimes in subtle ways.  That's what I appreciated most about ""Crash"" - the subtle moments.  The best example is the second meeting between Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton, which seems to end much sooner than one would expect.  A lesser movie would have milked this scene for sentimentality - a sin of which ""Crash"" is rarely guilty.The cast is also uniformly good, particularly Thandie Newton, Michael Pena, and Matt Dillon.  The casting of some of the most likeable actors (e.g., Sandra Bullock) as some of the initially ""ugliest"" characters may seem like a cheap ploy, but it slowly pays dividends.  Director Paul Haggis does an admirable with ""Crash;"" he's best known as a television director - ""Crash"" is his first theatrical release since the obscure 1993 movie, ""Red Hot.""  If he can maintain this momentum, he could become a major film director.  The movie was made for approximately $6.5 million and grossed over $55 million, so he'll definitely get a shot.The only major weakness is a too-obvious music score; the music swelling at tense moments really undermines the otherwise subtle nature of the film.  In addition, some viewers may find all the plot coincidences to be a bit much; however, these kinds of multi-character films often rely on the overlapping nature of the characters' lives, so I wasn't bothered by this aspect.  Overall, these flaws are minor compared to the quality of the film and its performances.  Although it's not a masterpiece, discerning viewers will probably like ""Crash"" a great deal.  Highly recommended.",4,You embarrass me.

It should have been the other way 'round, as it's likely ""Crash"" was nominated for Best Picture only to counterbalance ""the gay cowboy movie"" so many Academy Members refused to see, let alone vote for.As someone who badly wanted ""Brokeback Mountain"" to win Best Picture, it took more than 18 months for me to work up the courage to watch ""Crash"". Despite the mixed reviews -- not a few of which excoriated it -- and a position halfway down Premiere's statistical ranking of 2004's films, I was worried that ""Crash"" might prove to be an exceptionally fine film.I had nothing to worry about. In my 55 years of film viewing, ""Crash"" is one of the worst dramatic films I've ever seen. It is appallingly bad.""Crash"" was inspired by the theft of Haggis's car, and a memoir by a former LA police officer exposing the department's racism and detailing some of the incidents portrayed in the movie. His story might have made a great film, except for Haggis's total miscalculation of how to treat the material.Not wanting to tell a PC ""everyone non-white in LA is a victim of white racism"" tale, Haggis instead created an ""everyone hates everyone else"" story. This might not be far from the truth, but it necessarily requires a huge cast and reduces the complexities of human relationships to inelegant and clumsily juxtaposed vignettes.Mr. Haggis forgot that you can't write a good drama about a social problem, only about the people it involves. In attempting to present a multi-dimensional view of racism, ""Crash"" is obliged to introduce so many characters that it becomes impossible to focus on any one of them with any subtlety in a two-hour film.The resulting haggis is an overwrought screed that might have come from the pen of a high-school student who knows nothing about dramatic plausibility. (The Dillon/Newton poster catches ""Crash""'s over-the-top tone quite well, just as the ""Brokeback Mountain"" poster accurately reflects that film's reserved mood.) Haggis finds no better way to initiate character interaction than by having them ""crash"" into each other through sheer coincidence, of which most occurrences are groaningly ironic.Even worse than the forced meetings are the ""Someone Learned An Important Lesson"" scenes, no more subtle than those in icky family sitcoms. The worst of these occurs after Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) conveniently falls down the stairs so her despised Mexican maid can help her, when her other friends won't.Their ""reconciliation"" is amateurish beyond belief. Instead of Mrs. Cabot simply saying ""You were there when I needed you. Thank you."", she hugs the maid and gushes (in an understated way for a gush) ""You're my only friend."" &lt;sniff, sniff> What [stuff]. (I can't say [stuff] -- it's a four-letter word starting with C, something you see every day -- because Amazon will censor it.) She doesn't even offer the maid a raise!There is _one_ charming and engaging scene, between Daniel (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and his daughter, which I won't spoil for those who choose to see the film. But we discover toward the end of the movie that this scene was a ""set-up"", part of the process of forcing Farhad (Shaun Toub) to Learn The Error Of His Ways in a cheaply histrionic sequence. (It should also be noted that a critical plot point regarding this ""payoff"" scene isn't clearly made, leading to extreme viewer confusion.)""Crash"" is interesting only as a document of LA race relations. But it won't soon be forgotten -- as a poor film that beat a significant and challenging one for the Oscar. Annie Proulx should have swallowed her (understandable) bitterness and kept her mouth shut, but ""Crash"" is, indeed -- on a dramatic level -- ""trash"".If you're in the mood for better -- and cleverer -- films about racism, try ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"", or ""Amos and Andrew"", or even ""Coneheads"".

It really dealt with racism and cultural clash in Los Angeles, and it ultimately makes the viewers realized that in a city filled with so many different ethnic backgrounds, that acceptance is the only tool to overcome discrimination regardless of the individual's skin colour and status in society. This film explore the various harsh and violent situations the characters endured and how they are changed by the aftermath of those events.Sandra Bullock has obviously chosen to play against her sweet and cute roles, and it's refreshing to see her play an angry and arrogant snob and overt racist wife(Jean) to her nervous and  insecure D.A. husband(Rick Cabot/ Brendan Fraser). She prentends to be scared and grabs her husband's arm when she was passing by two black guys(Peter Waters/Larenz Tate and Anthony/Ludacris) on the sidewalk, and they instantly gave her a bad reaction by hyjacking her car. Jean clearly felt more superior and there's no such thing as equality in her eyes. She loudly suggested that by the way the locksmith(Daniel/Michael Pena)dressed and the tattoos that he was deemed dangerous and possibly steal the keys and gets his friends to come and gangrape her! She would eventually go from angry to mellow....Graham Waters(Don Cheadles) is not proud of his own colour and neglects his mother and treats his fellow detective girlfriend(Ria/Jennifer Esposito)disrespectfully by labeling her as Mexican when she was part Puerto Rican and Salvatoran. He's lost touch with his brother who was misbehaving on the street and steals cars and ran over an elderly Asian man...Matt Dillon was impressive as the corrupted racist Sgt. Ryan who made a habit of abusing his authority at innocent folks. A sussessful TV director named Cameron(Terrence Howard) and his beautiful and emotionally volatile wife(Christine/Thandie Newton) had a nasty encounter with Ryan on the road. They were pulled over by him, and he sexually assaulted her after verbally attacked the couple. Ryan's innocent rookie sidekick Officer Hanson( Ryan Phillipe) was shocked to see the misconduct. Thandie Newton's performance in this scene as well the near-fatal accident scene was by far the most striking in this film. Her rage, fear, and breakdown was so memerizing, just think best supporting actress nomination. I was very touched by the spiritual and emotional changes Dillon's character had undergone later on, even though I really hated him at first. Loretta Devine(Shariqua Johnson) stole a few scenes when she had verbal disputes with Ryan...Shaun Toub played a Persian immigrant/grocery store owner who was obviously having some hard time ""blending"" his old ways into the American environment. I thought his segment was kind of like House of Sand and Fog, and I was reminded of the characters played by Ben Kinsley and Shorheh Adahshloo. He simply takes matters into his own hands and violence was the only solution to a bad situation....The Asians in this film had small parts and they are depicted as alienated and angry at the more superior Whites, and even the Blacks looked down on them. The most sterotype of discrimination was to make fun of their English skills, which was so inappropiate, since most Asians speak at least two languages and English is often their second or third.This film is very worthwhile for everyone to watch and it will change the way you treat other people of a different race. Nobody should be more superior based on their race, it's what they do that matters the most.",5,Crashing Into Racism and Cultural Clash in Los Angeles.,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,3635,"['Crash', 'very', 'intense', 'powerful', 'movie', 'interwined', 'stories', 'as', 'well-paced/edited', 'Magnolia', 'being', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'really', 'racism', 'cultural', 'clash', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'ultimately', 'viewers', 'realized', 'city', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ethnic', 'backgrounds', 'acceptance', 'only', 'tool', 'overcome', 'discrimination', 'regardless', 'individual', 'skin', 'colour', 'status', 'society', 'film', 'various', 'harsh', 'violent', 'situations', 'characters', 'endured', 'how', 'are', 'changed', 'aftermath', 'events.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'obviously', 'chosen', 'play', 'sweet', 'cute', 'roles', 'refreshing', 'see', 'play', 'angry', 'arrogant', 'snob', 'overt', 'racist', 'wife', 'Jean', 'nervous', 'insecure', 'D.A', 'husband', 'Rick', 'Cabot/', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'be', 'scared', 'grabs', 'husband', 'arm', 'when', 'was', 'passing', 'two', 'black', 'guys', 'Peter', 'Waters/Larenz', 'Tate', 'Anthony/Ludacris', 'sidewalk', 'instantly', 'gave', 'bad', 'reaction', 'hyjacking', 'car', 'Jean', 'clearly', 'felt', 'more', 'superior', 'such', 'thing', 'equality', 'eyes', 'loudly', 'suggested', 'way', 'locksmith', 'Daniel/Michael', 'Pena', 'dressed', 'tattoos', 'was', 'deemed', 'dangerous', 'possibly', 'steal', 'keys', 'friends', 'come', 'gangrape', 'would', 'eventually', 'go', 'angry', 'mellow', '.Graham', 'Waters', 'Don', 'Cheadles', 'not', 'proud', 'own', 'colour', 'mother', 'treats', 'fellow', 'detective', 'girlfriend', 'Ria/Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'disrespectfully', 'labeling', 'Mexican', 'when', 'was', 'part', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Salvatoran', 'lost', 'touch', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'misbehaving', 'street', 'steals', 'cars', 'ran', 'elderly', 'Asian', 'man', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'was', 'impressive', 'corrupted', 'racist', 'Sgt', 'Ryan', 'who', 'made', 'habit', 'abusing', 'authority', 'innocent', 'folks', 'sussessful', 'TV', 'director', 'named', 'Cameron', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'volatile', 'wife', 'Christine/Thandie', 'Newton', 'had', 'nasty', 'encounter', 'Ryan', 'road', 'were', 'pulled', 'over', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'verbally', 'attacked', 'couple', 'Ryan', 'innocent', 'rookie', 'sidekick', 'Officer', 'Hanson', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'misconduct', 'Thandie', 'Newton', 'performance', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'near-fatal', 'accident', 'scene', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'striking', 'film', 'rage', 'fear', 'breakdown', 'was', 'so', 'memerizing', 'just', 'think', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'nomination', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'changes', 'Dillon', 'character', 'had', 'undergone', 'later', 'even', 'really', 'hated', 'first', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'Shariqua', 'Johnson', 'stole', 'few', 'scenes', 'when', 'had', 'verbal', 'disputes', 'Ryan', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'played', 'Persian', 'immigrant/grocery', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'blending', 'old', 'ways', 'American', 'environment', 'thought', 'segment', 'was', 'kind', 'like', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'was', 'reminded', 'characters', 'played', 'Ben', 'Kinsley', 'Shorheh', 'Adahshloo', 'simply', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'violence', 'was', 'only', 'solution', 'bad', 'situation', '.The', 'Asians', 'film', 'had', 'small', 'parts', 'are', 'depicted', 'alienated', 'angry', 'more', 'superior', 'Whites', 'even', 'Blacks', 'looked', 'down', 'most', 'sterotype', 'discrimination', 'was', 'make', 'fun', 'English', 'skills', 'was', 'so', 'inappropiate', 'most', 'Asians', 'speak', 'least', 'two', 'languages', 'English', 'often', 'second', 'third.This', 'film', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'everyone', 'watch', 'will', 'change', 'way', 'treat', 'other', 'people', 'different', 'race', 'Nobody', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'superior', 'based', 'race', 'what', 'do', 'most']",Crash
920865,A188NTJ5LV8LA4,B000A3XY5A,Wm19,"[2, 11]","This movie follows a cast of Asian, Caucasian, Latino, African-American and Persian characters in Los Angeles during a 36 hour period. It's easy to follow the story and characters, and all their stories intertwine. Every character has some stereotypes of other ethnicities, and their own anger and fear makes them even more prejudiced. One Caucasian couple gets victimized by a pair of African-Americans.  The wife then takes out her fear and anger by humiliating the Latino employees in her life. The entire story is like this.  Someone gets victimized, takes that fear and anger and later lashes out verbally at someone else, and it all rolls together.  In another story line, a storeowner buys a gun to protect his store and his wife, whose was previously threatened by someone. Of course, the next time the storeowner gets angry, he takes out his gun to threaten someone the next time he gets angry. Three cars burn in this movie, and there's a lot of swearing.  In several storylines, you see people having to put up with humiliating racist behaviour, because it's safer for them if they don't complain about it.  I wasn't familiar with some of the references, like Shanique being an African-American name, or calling someone ""amigo"" because they were Latino, or African-Americans being expected to speak differently from Caucasian characters when they're on tv.The story was very good, and several aspects shocked me - likely because I am from Canada, and have never been to LA.  First, there's a lot of guns and fear. There's this palpable fear of being victimized by someone with a gun. The fearful victim then gets angry at everything and either a) buys his/her own gun to fight back, or b) yells at someone else in anger, usually making racist remarks and further traumatizing someone else. Second, I was shocked by the number of corrupt cops in the story. Is this what they mean when they say a police force is known for corruption? It's hard to imagine, it was shocking.  Third, the power of the HMO was a shock. That a man couldn't see another doctor for a second opinion because the HMO didn't cover it, was a surprise to me, as I am unfamiliar with HMOs. The best part of the movie, I thought was the ending, because almost everyone has a kind of redemption, where they realize how wrong they were to stereotype or take out their anger on anyone else.What I learnt from this movie was that a lot of problems can be prevented by speaking politely and keeping an open mind.  In other words, don't take out your anger at a complete stranger and make racist remarks.  Every interaction with a stranger is a new one, so don't let your personal baggage colour your perception.  The movie was well done, interesting, had good timing and was thought-provoking.",4,"Very interesting, well filmed",1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,2767,"['movie', 'cast', 'Asian', 'Caucasian', 'Latino', 'African-American', 'Persian', 'characters', 'Los', 'Angeles', '36', 'hour', 'period', 'easy', 'follow', 'story', 'characters', 'stories', 'intertwine', 'Every', 'character', 'stereotypes', 'other', 'ethnicities', 'own', 'anger', 'fear', 'even', 'more', 'prejudiced', 'One', 'Caucasian', 'couple', 'victimized', 'pair', 'African-Americans', 'wife', 'then', 'out', 'fear', 'anger', 'humiliating', 'Latino', 'employees', 'life', 'entire', 'story', 'Someone', 'victimized', 'fear', 'anger', 'later', 'lashes', 'out', 'verbally', 'someone', 'else', 'together', 'story', 'line', 'storeowner', 'gun', 'protect', 'store', 'wife', 'was', 'previously', 'threatened', 'someone', 'course', 'next', 'time', 'storeowner', 'angry', 'out', 'gun', 'threaten', 'someone', 'next', 'time', 'angry', 'Three', 'cars', 'burn', 'movie', 'lot', 'swearing', 'several', 'storylines', 'see', 'people', 'having', 'put', 'up', 'humiliating', 'racist', 'behaviour', 'safer', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'references', 'Shanique', 'being', 'African-American', 'name', 'calling', 'someone', 'amigo', 'were', 'Latino', 'African-Americans', 'being', 'expected', 'speak', 'differently', 'Caucasian', 'characters', 'when', ""'re"", 'tv.The', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'several', 'aspects', 'shocked', 'likely', 'am', 'Canada', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'LA', 'First', 'lot', 'guns', 'fear', 'palpable', 'fear', 'being', 'victimized', 'someone', 'gun', 'fearful', 'victim', 'then', 'angry', 'everything', 'own', 'gun', 'fight', 'back', 'b', 'someone', 'else', 'anger', 'usually', 'making', 'racist', 'remarks', 'further', 'traumatizing', 'someone', 'else', 'Second', 'was', 'shocked', 'number', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'story', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'police', 'force', 'known', 'corruption', 'hard', 'imagine', 'was', 'shocking', 'Third', 'power', 'HMO', 'was', 'shock', 'man', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'doctor', 'second', 'opinion', 'HMO', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'was', 'surprise', 'am', 'unfamiliar', 'HMOs', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'ending', 'almost', 'everyone', 'kind', 'redemption', 'where', 'realize', 'how', 'wrong', 'were', 'stereotype', 'take', 'out', 'anger', 'anyone', 'else.What', 'learnt', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'prevented', 'speaking', 'politely', 'keeping', 'open', 'mind', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'out', 'anger', 'complete', 'stranger', 'make', 'racist', 'remarks', 'interaction', 'stranger', 'new', 'one', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'personal', 'baggage', 'colour', 'perception', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'had', 'good', 'timing', 'was', 'thought-provoking']",Crash

I finally had a chance to view the movie myself once released on video. It was sort of a mixed bag of.It is a story of a group of strangers who lives collide and become emotionally intertwined.  There seems to be no real plot and the stories only seem to serve the purpose of preaching about racial stereotypes and racism. The stories of each character seems to be just thrown together just for the purpose of preaching and many of the characters seem to have no real purpose to the movie but to serve as tools for melodrama. This gives the movie a feeling of choppiness.Some of the events Crash just seems unbelievable to buy and really makes no sense. For example, it is No spoiler to tell you that a cop picks up a hitchhiker out of the goodness of his own heart in the film. While this is not entirely unbelievable, most of us probably can't imagine this actually happening but this seems to happen just to set up something emotional for the moving.Crash is certainly an entertaining movie but it fails at being the social commentary that it strives to be. I would actually give this one 3 and  stars.

920868,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000A3XY5A,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","Before seeing 2005's ""Crash"" I had, of course, heard the usual criticisms -- it's too contrived, unrealistic, depressing, heavy-handed, preachy, too much cussing, blah, blah, blah. Well, I've just seen it for the third time and I think it's a great film. Yes, there's a lot of raw emotion and hard-to-watch scenes, but there's undeniable glimpses of love, hope, redemption and forgivenes as well.THE STORY: Peoples of differing ethnicities and social-economic levels 'crash' into eachother in Los Angeles over a two-day period. These people include:- A white cop who's angry over the downside of affirmitive action and abuses his authority (Matt Dillon).- His young white partner who objects to the abuse and actively tries to counteract it (Ryan Phillipe).- A black tv director who feels emasculated over the racism he experiences and ultimately blows up (Terrence Howard).- His light-skinned wife who doesn't know when to shutteth up (Thandie Newton).- An hispanic locksmith (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and his young daughter with an 'invisible bullet-proof cloak.'- A Persian shopkeeper who needs a scapegoat after his store is horribly vandalized, not to mention his daughter and wife.- Two black car thieves (Ludacris and Larenz Tate), the latter the younger brother of a detective, Graham (Don Cheadle).- Graham's beautiful partner and bedmate, Ria (Jennifer Esposito), and her mother, a maid to...- The District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock).- An Asian man who gets hospitalized and his frantic wife racing to see whether he's alive or dead.""Crash"" is reminiscent of another L.A. drama, the 1991 masterpiece ""Grand Canyon,"" but has enough nuances to stand on its own. For one thing, ""Crash"" is (even) more serious and dark.As you can see above, this is a very involved story with numerous interwoven storylines; it ain't no mindless popcorn 'blockbuster.' A casual viewing won't cut it. In fact, a single viewing won't likely cut it either. It's not that type of picture. Most of the negative criticisms about the film are by people who didn't watch closely and then lambaste the film with criticisms that aren't even legitimate. Want some examples?For one thing, the film is about so much more than racism; it also addresses stereotypes -- those who fit them and those who escape them, hypocrites, the capacity for good and bad in every human soul, second chances, passive correction and shame, self-sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness, abuse of power, the last straw, manhood & emasulation, giving someone a break, true friendship, misunderstandings, favortism and more.SPOILER ALERT! -- Don't read the following paragraphs unless you've seen the film.Furthermore, not every character is racist as some critics insist. Brendan Fraser's character never shows any racism and the only reason his wife (Bullock) blows up with racially-charged statements concerning the locksmith is because she just got robbed and shoved to the pavement at gunpoint by two young black guys. How would you or I react after such an experience? Also, Matt Dillon's cop partner never displays racism in the truest sense; why else would he radically come to the defense of the director who has a fit or pick up a young black male hitchhiking? (What happens later is a misunderstanding not real racism). What about the detectives Graham and Ria and Ria's housemaid mother? (Yes, Graham makes one derogatory statement about hispanics, but that's it; he's hardly racist). These are all main characters.Then there's the criticism that all the protagonists are ""essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes."" This is completely untrue. Graham and Ria (black and hispanic) are successful detectives; Cameron is a successful black tv director; and the hispanic locksmith is a family-oriented working man, not a criminal or gangbanger. Yes, there are some people who fit the stereotypes, like the two young black male thieves and the racist/abusive white cop, but one of the thieves becomes shamed for his lifestyle & hypocrisy and the racist cop is willing to risk his life for a woman of color, thus redeeming himself (for the guilt he felt over abusing his power the night before), besides his white partner is anything but a white racist who abuses his authority. I could go on but this is enough.Another reviewer criticizes the film with this mulitple-choice question: You are involved in a car accident on a busy street. The other driver is Asian. Do you:a) Wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay.b) Exchange insurance information with the other driver.c) Scream and yell, ""damn chinks don't know how to drive!""If you picked C, you'd love Crash.This car-crash senario DOES take place in the story, but he's leaving out some important details -- A woman & man are rear-ended by an Asian lady. Why don't they call the cops? Because they ARE cops and there are other cops on the scene. Why does the lady detective talk back to the Asian woman? Because the Asian woman is having a fit and throwing racial slurs (she's hispanic). This is WHY she talks back to the Asian woman, not to mention she's a cop and therefore in a position of authority. Why does the Asian woman have a fit anyway? Because she's rushing to the hospital to see if her husband's alive or not. So, you see, the witty little multiple-choice question doesn't actually fit the reality of the film.END SPOILERAnother criticism is that the racism in the story is not subtle like it is in real life. Well, haven't you ever seen anyone blow up like in the movie? I have. In a city as big as L.A. how many such blow ups happen over any 48-hour period? ""Crash"" isn't saying that everyone in LA is racist or that such blow ups happen everywhere constantly, rather it focuses on a handful of such blow ups over a two-day period. Writer/director Paul Haggis has lived in the city for three decades, I bet every instance in the story is based on a real-life account, loosely or not. Which isn't to say everthing in the story is believable, but -- hey -- it's a freakin' movie.As for it being contrived, aren't all films contrived to some extent? They all have to tell an understandable story in a mere two hours, after all. Regardless, coincidences are a fact of life; besides, the film (again) focuses on a handful of storylines that DO interconnect. By doing this ""Crash"" is intentionally ignoring all those that don't fit.Another totally irrelevant criticism is that ""Crash"" unjustly beat out another film for Best Picture in 2005. In fact, a large portion of the negative reviews here at Amazon are obviously by bitter gays upset because their favored picture didn't win. This is all irrelevant. ""Crash"" has zero connection to that homosexual-themed movie. What matters is whether ""Crash"" is a good film or not. And I'm here to tell you that, if you're in the mood for a well-made psychological drama with numerous insights to the human condition, then don't miss out on ""Crash.""",5,Provocative psychological

It is the story of several intersecting lives in modern-day Los Angeles, of characters from different racial backgrounds, and of how the prescribed stereotypes of those backgrounds affect the characters' values, beliefs and life decisions.  The action centers around the death of a boy and works backwards to reveal how each of the players in the tale is connected to one another through close contact or casual relations.  This film takes the viewer on a highly emotional roller coaster through the racial profiles, stereotypes, preconceived notions, behaviors, language and lifestyle of a cross section of Americans. The film is raw, the language is shocking at times, the acting (for the most part) is amazing. I particularly thought that Sandra Bullock's performance as the spoiled white wife of a District Attorney, albeit small, was incredibly convincing and disturbing- she is a far cry from her comedy typecast days.Complimented by a wonderful soundtrack, clever cinematography and a web of colorful stories , ""Crash"" should appeal to all walks of American life.  Virtually all dominant racial groups in America are targeted and corresponding stereotypes smattered across the screen in an unapologetic manner that is simultaneously insulting, disturbing, humorous and loving.  ""Crash"" is not meant to be the Holy Grail of race relations in modern America , but it is meant to be, and succeeds (in an industry often plagued by the search for the ideal happily ever after ending) in examining a very sensitive and often times politically incorrect topic of race and prejudices  The upshot is that the viewer sees the blatant irony that characters who hold so much unconditional love for their relatives and equally such disdain for strangers- that these same characters would do anything, including lie, cheat, torture and kill another stranger, for that very love.The film is very powerful and a welcome new entry in the homogenous landscape of Hollywood happy endings.

There are exceptions to every rule and life will never be perfect, but if you are on the REAL streets and deal with REAL people everyday, the race thing is beyond passe and stale.  There are just plain differences in people, and most people by now in this day and age know how to deal with it.  To make matters worse, they awarded this movie with best picture.  It's only going to hurt them in the end because they are now just trivializing ""Oscars"" and giving them out to anybody.
