1612581,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00AJXO56I,D. S. Thurlow,"[38, 40]","Fans of ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" were fortunate to get a final season of this longtime cable TV favorite.  After a ninth season in which lead characters Detectives Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Eames (Kathryn Erbe) had seemingly departed the Major Case Squad and the series, they were brought back for a shortened tenth season of eight episodes, with a new boss and all-new cases.The new cases follow a familiar and successful formula: off-beat murder cases in which the detectives must smoke out the intent of one or more suspects and secure a confession.  The final cases range from Broadway to the Catholic Church, the fashion industry, a mercenary security company, and an online dating service.  Guest stars include, among others, Cynthia Nixon and Neil McDonough.Detective Bobby Goren has returned to work in a probationary status; he must pass a psychiatric evaluation to be fully restored to duty.  His weekly encounters with Dr. Paula Gyson (an excellent Julia Ormond) are a highlight of the final season.  The sessions are an uncomfortable expedition into Goren's psyche, and there is real dramatic tension over whether his return will be approved by a seemingly skeptical Dr. Gyson.  Goren's need to return to detecting is palpable, and the sessions also raise some interesting questions about his relationship with Eames.  The low-key but oddly satisfying finale's final moments will appropriately feature the two detectives.  Highly recommended to fans of ""Criminal Intent.""",4,Last Call...,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,1493,"['Fans', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'were', 'fortunate', 'get', 'final', 'season', 'longtime', 'cable', 'TV', 'favorite', 'ninth', 'season', 'lead', 'characters', 'Goren', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Eames', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'had', 'seemingly', 'departed', 'Major', 'Case', 'Squad', 'series', 'were', 'brought', 'back', 'shortened', 'tenth', 'season', 'eight', 'episodes', 'new', 'boss', 'all-new', 'cases.The', 'new', 'cases', 'follow', 'familiar', 'successful', 'formula', 'off-beat', 'murder', 'cases', 'detectives', 'must', 'smoke', 'out', 'intent', 'one', 'more', 'suspects', 'secure', 'confession', 'final', 'cases', 'range', 'Broadway', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'fashion', 'industry', 'mercenary', 'security', 'company', 'online', 'dating', 'service', 'Guest', 'include', 'others', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'Neil', 'McDonough.Detective', 'Bobby', 'Goren', 'returned', 'work', 'probationary', 'status', 'must', 'pass', 'psychiatric', 'evaluation', 'be', 'fully', 'restored', 'duty', 'weekly', 'encounters', 'Dr.', 'Paula', 'Gyson', 'excellent', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'are', 'highlight', 'final', 'season', 'sessions', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'expedition', 'Goren', 'psyche', 'real', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'return', 'will', 'be', 'approved', 'seemingly', 'skeptical', 'Dr.', 'Gyson', 'Goren', 'need', 'return', 'detecting', 'palpable', 'sessions', 'also', 'raise', 'interesting', 'questions', 'relationship', 'Eames', 'low-key', 'oddly', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'final', 'moments', 'will', 'appropriately', 'feature', 'two', 'detectives', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Criminal', 'Intent']",Law & Order: Criminal Intent: The Final Year

What I enjoyed most was watching Vincent D'Onofrio in therapy with the shrink his bosses send him too played by Lena Olin. Last season just got too far away from what worked best on this show; the chemistry between Eames & Goren and they brought in Jeff Goldblum and Soffia Burrows as a new detective team so we didn't see enough of Goren & Eames. In this final season Vince D'Onofrio seems to 'come alive' with energy for the role like he hadn't had for some time in my view. When the end comes and we see how Goren finally see his partner Eames in a 'new way' These two lonely, wounded, souls who obviously care very much for each other might find something more--together.

1612593,A3USWFMXUUQBFI,B00AJXO56I,SanFran JT,"[0, 0]","This is a superb season and an appropriate final one for one of the finest dramas in television history.  While the original Law and Order was excellent, with an outstanding cast doing wonderful work (Jerry Orbach, Sam Waterston, and Stephen Hill in particular) the spin-offs have been hit or miss.  SVU is a total abomination, tasteless trash, with astonishingly repetitive writing and D&#34;actors whose expression seem to be cast in concrete.  In contrast. Criminal Intent features fine writing, great direction, and superb acting from two of the most gifted actors to ever appear on any series.  While D'Onofrio stands out with his method style and flashy style, it is amazing that Kathryn Erbe is able to match or even surpass him with incredible performances week after week.  On first viewing, Erbe's Eames seems to be given little to do but with stunning skill, Erbe builds upon her character over time and manages to create one of the unforgettable female police officers, or any other woman, ever portrayed.  You will find that it is her character who will bring humor, emotion, and depth to many episodes and it is those stories that focus more on her that will often move you, bring tears to your eyes, and etch themselves in your memory.  It would be wonderful if she were given a television role that would display her gifts as well as her theater work has.  However, the chemistry between Eames and Goren is the most interesting part of this program and which gives the proceedings life on a weekly basis.  For viewers who have just discovered Criminal Intent through reruns, I envy you all that awaits you.  If you can, try to start from the beginning of the series and follow the growth and change in Goren and Eames.  They have a remarkable relationship and the last episode's closing scene leaves the viewer imagining many possibilities for the two of them.

1612597,A3HPOU95V4GJ2T,B00AJXO56I,Wally Leitel,"[2, 3]","I especially liked 2 Law and Orders...the Law and Order (1st main series with Sam Waterston, Jesse Martin, S Epatha Merkesan, Jerry Orbach...others of course) and then the ""Criminal Intent"" series with Vince D'Onfrio and Kathryn Erbe. I never missed seeing an episode and when DVD'S came out, I got to see them over whenever I desired to (very often.)The actors change over time with a long series but that the characters of Bobby Goren and Alex Eames stayed the same was the frosting on the cake for sure. I tell friends that I saw a chemistry was between the 2 of them and when that happens in a story, well, we have hit real pay dirt. I could go on and on about this series, how some of the others that came and left I miss so much too...as Jamey ""Capt. Deakins"" Sheridan, the man who played ADA Carver...also Chris Noth who played ""Logan"" and his beautiful actor partner ""Wheeler.""I wish they would be able to get even a year or two with Goren and Eames (at least those two) and put them on special assignment in special investigations, etc, on the SVU show and get them involved now and then with Mariska Hagerty and Ice T and the team....I just hate seeing them go...BUT, thank goodness we have the DVD'S and re-runs.Last, I did like very much how the 10th season ended with Eames looking like the beautiful Doll she is, arms crossed waiting for Bobby to come out, get on to the next case. My own made up ending is that though we do not see it, they end up married for this closeness they have come to have in near death and other on the job experiences they had, their trust and friendship has to materialize into more. Recall fans, how in a recent episode of SVU when Kathryn Erbe is talking at end of story with Mariska Hargitay about Goren, her partner, that she had for 10 years and it was like they were married? Hargitay then says to her, ""But you were not.""...COME ON NBC, put them together for a few shows on SVU at least and give us at least the inclination that they are definitely going to be ""together?""  One good show would be them going out dating, going to Eamse' fathers home (who likes Goren we know.)
