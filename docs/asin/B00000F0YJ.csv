It is PAL version and will only play in my PC but it is widescreen has a great featurette called The Z Men Debriefed, an all new 25 min documentary with the executive producer of the film and interviews with actors Chris Haywood and John Waters.  It also includes the theatrical trailer and photo gallery.  It is as I said anamorphic 16:9 widescreen and in Dolby Digital 2.0.  The only way to top this is give us a mix of 5.1 and add some commentary by Mel Gibson or any of the other actors and as much else as they can throw in.This is a very cool movie.  It shows in great detail the workings of the infamous ""Grease Gun"" with a silencer on it.  It features Mel Gibson and Sam Neill, its two biggest stars and also John Phillip Law (Barbarella) and John Waters (Breaker Morant) who are equally as fantastic.Buy it, you won't regret it.  This has never before been available in the US on DVD.UPDATE 2-14-06Well, I got my official US version and I was quite upset with it.  It is full frame, appears to be a cheap transfer from VHS and is no comparison to the import version available for sale here.

Nevertheless, the details of warfaredepicted in this movie are very realistic of what it was like on an Island under Japanese Occupation, and commando missions which were comprised of allies from different countries.  During the Pacific operations of General Douglas MacArthur to retake the islands,such commando units were sent out to rescue survivors of shot-down planes and boats that sank in enemy waters.  As a former USAF military Officer, it has been my privilege to read military history, in military schools, about such commando operations.  Although this production is like a war novel, which it is, nevertheless it portrays not all missions had a successful ending.  There were tragedies in which the whole commando unit was killed, survivors did not live, and civilians were executed for aiding an enemy.  This is an excellent portrayal of weapons used and tactics employed by Americans, Australians, English and French commandos.
