If you know King of Queens this show won't really come as a surprise: many of the situations could be episodes.The bits are not highly original. He is definitely not the first to make jokes about standing in line in the bank or at the airport. Some jokes are almost exactly the same as George Carlin once made for example.The biggest difference between someone like Carlin and James is that James is very clean. No swear words at all.Of course many of the bits are about food. The part about eating a big mac is hilarious, especially how he acts it out.It's worth seeing, especially if you like Doug Heffernan.",4,"Funny, not very original, but he is an actor",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,727,"['can', 'definitely', 'see', 'Kevin', 'James', 'star', 'hit', 'sitcom', 'things', 'out', 'out', 'well', 'know', 'King', 'Queens', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'surprise', 'many', 'situations', 'could', 'be', 'episodes.The', 'bits', 'are', 'not', 'highly', 'original', 'definitely', 'not', 'first', 'make', 'jokes', 'standing', 'line', 'bank', 'airport', 'jokes', 'are', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'George', 'Carlin', 'once', 'made', 'example.The', 'biggest', 'difference', 'someone', 'Carlin', 'James', 'James', 'very', 'clean', 'swear', 'words', 'all.Of', 'course', 'many', 'bits', 'are', 'food', 'part', 'eating', 'big', 'mac', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'how', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', 'like', 'Doug', 'Heffernan']",Kevin James - Sweat the Small Stuff

However, I have seen tons of ""Comedy Central Presents"" routines and many hour comedy specials buy guys like Jeff Dunham, Christopher Titus, Dane Cook, etc and this is the funniest routine I have EVER seen. I have watched it at least 10 times and I still can laugh at it despite knowing every joke.Kevin can make you laugh without using a sear word every other word. How does he do it? By telling jokes and stories about every day life. It makes it that much funnier when you can relate to jokes.Bottom line: it may be expensive but it is well worth it.
