87657,APXZRLC8LO165,0790724960,Carly,"[28, 28]","This is my favorite Olsen movie that they have made, mainly because unlike so many of their more recent movies, it has a good plot and a very good supporting cast. The plot sends 7-year-olds Lynn and Kelly on a Halloween night mission to get a magical moonstone from their evil aunt who has cast a spell on their other aunt. Fun for little kids, but also enjoyable for older fans. It's a good movie to pull out around Halloweentime (or whenever) and at 17 years old, I am not ashamed to watch it because it is truly one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's better movies. I guess the reason I think that is because of the stronger recognition of the other characters--they really get a more substantial role in the movie than the surrounding characters in some of MKA's other movies. In this film, you'll fall in love with the endearing gravedigger, the money-hungry yet lovable Mr. N, and the supportive, ""take charge"" Oscar the Clown. And then you've got the girls' parents--who, for once, actually act like parents. Gentle, loving, good people--and yet they have problems of their own that they must get through as a family. Now you start to get the feel of a real movie with a real plot. Too many of Mary-Kate and Ashley's movies either have them with single moms or dads(which there is nothing wrong with at all, but it got a little repetitive with the Olsens) or completely up-in-the-clouds parents who were practically at their feet doting on them and giving them everything, thus showing the viewer exactly what life is NOT like. This movie is one exception where the casting of the girls' parents is very strong and realistic. After seeing enough of their other films, you may grow to appreciate seeing this. I am a long-time fan of these girls' films--have been ever since their memorable Full House days. But if you're looking for a quality Olsen movie, I'd recommend that you go for the ones from their younger years--this one may be your best bet. But that's only my opinion.",5,my favorite Olsen movie,1034380800,"10 12, 2002",2002,1977,"['favorite', 'Olsen', 'movie', 'have', 'made', 'mainly', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'good', 'plot', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'plot', '7-year-olds', 'Lynn', 'Kelly', 'Halloween', 'night', 'mission', 'get', 'magical', 'moonstone', 'evil', 'aunt', 'who', 'cast', 'spell', 'other', 'aunt', 'Fun', 'little', 'kids', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'older', 'fans', 'good', 'movie', 'pull', 'out', 'Halloweentime', 'whenever', '17', 'years', 'old', 'am', 'not', 'ashamed', 'watch', 'truly', 'one', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'better', 'movies', 'guess', 'reason', 'think', 'stronger', 'recognition', 'other', 'characters', 'really', 'get', 'more', 'substantial', 'role', 'movie', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'MKA', 'other', 'movies', 'film', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'endearing', 'gravedigger', 'money-hungry', 'yet', 'lovable', 'Mr.', 'N', 'supportive', 'take', 'charge', 'Clown', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'girls', 'parents', 'who', 'once', 'actually', 'act', 'parents', 'Gentle', 'loving', 'good', 'people', 'yet', 'have', 'problems', 'own', 'must', 'get', 'family', 'Now', 'start', 'get', 'feel', 'real', 'movie', 'real', 'plot', 'Too', 'many', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'movies', 'have', 'single', 'moms', 'dads', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'got', 'little', 'repetitive', 'Olsens', 'completely', 'up-in-the-clouds', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'practically', 'feet', 'doting', 'giving', 'everything', 'thus', 'showing', 'viewer', 'exactly', 'what', 'life', 'NOT', 'movie', 'one', 'exception', 'where', 'casting', 'girls', 'parents', 'very', 'strong', 'realistic', 'seeing', 'enough', 'other', 'films', 'may', 'grow', 'appreciate', 'seeing', 'am', 'long-time', 'fan', 'girls', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'ever', 'memorable', 'Full', 'House', 'days', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quality', 'Olsen', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'go', 'ones', 'younger', 'years', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'bet', 'only', 'opinion']","Double, Double, Toil & Trouble VHS"

87678,AGKR0WED80PF5,0790724960,swimgym1285,"[1, 1]","**Update**I showed this movie to my nieces (who were 6 & 8) and we had to fast forward through 50% of it.  The Witches Council scene towards the end is very scary and most of the scenes in general are dark and creepy. I would absolutely not recommend it for kids.  I wrote the review below based on my own recollection of the film, but through an adult's eyes, I now feel differently.  Times have changed, and I no longer feel this movie is appropriate.  As mentioned below, the ending isn't even something to look forward to as the movie teaches vindication and the existence of evil.  The girls are cute, but I'd pick something else.**Original review**As a girl born at the end of 1985, there isn't much Olsen-related media I'm not familiar with. I remember this movie first airing on television, so I must have seen it when I was about 7 years old, and I can tell you with 100% certainty that I wasn't slightly scared or alarmed by anything in it.  Although, please also keep in mind that my favorite movie as a pre-schooler was Savannah Smiles (about a girl who befriends her kidnappers) and in kindergarten I sat in the front row of Space Mountain without so much as wincing.That being said, I've always been slightly befuddled about the incredibly dark tone that this movie takes on... there are several scenes where the girls are wandering around alone at night and everyone that they encounter is creepy in one way or another.  One of the twins is also basically evil until the end.I'm not exactly sure how to rate this film though because as a kid, this was my favorite Olsen TV feature (I liked It Takes Two better overall), but now as an adult, it bothers me that the girls seek revenge on their older aunt by keeping her trapped in the mirror at the end (could have been a good place for a lesson in forgiveness) and I find many of the themes pretty mature for a child audience.  Although my nieces (ages 6 & 8) are big Mary-Kate and Ashley fans now themselves (my sister thanks me daily for that), I'm hesitant to show this to them without watching it all the way through again.  So that means I'd have to watch it twice...  Not really what I look for in a kids movie.Overall, I think that this movie was pretty good for the times, but people tend to be much more careful now about the kind of media that their kids are exposed to, and I think this one might be stuck in the level of appropriateness for 1993...
