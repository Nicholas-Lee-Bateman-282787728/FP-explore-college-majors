It was really not one of my favorites but i loved the others. I also liked that it came with the pilot of True Jackson VP. That show is cool too. So if you love iCarly then buy this.

A neat nod to Mary Tyler Moore seems to play-out in the show's opener, as Cosgrove tosses her hat in the air while in a celebratory mood.There are few shows that are truly for kids, but this one gets an A-plus.",5,A Winner For Children,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,633,"['nice', 'compilation', 'children', 'who', 'enjoy', 'outstanding', 'program', 'typically', 'subtle', 'message', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'when', 'confronting', 'problem', 'past', 'episodes', 'do', 'air', 'very', 'regular', 'basis.Miranda', 'Cosgrove', 'outstanding', 'young', 'actress', 'make', 'mistake', 'program', 'built', 'co-stars', 'Jennette', 'McCurdy', 'Nathan', 'Kress', 'Jerry', 'Trainor', 'are', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'neat', 'nod', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'play-out', 'show', 'opener', 'Cosgrove', 'hat', 'air', 'celebratory', 'are', 'few', 'shows', 'are', 'truly', 'kids', 'one', 'A-plus']","iCarly: Season 1, Vol. 2"

1232159,AYB4ELCS5AM8P,B001QU9RSY,"John B. Goode ""JBG""","[0, 0]","Dan Schneider (the producer) has become the Dick Wolf (Law and Order, etc.) or Jerry Bruckheimer (CSI, etc.) of tween and teen shows with productions like Zoey101, Drake and Josh and now iCarly.So what's so great about these shows? They all have likable characters, great acting and comedy and a fast script, and it's very successful.Most important of all, the shows all revolve around a cast of likable characters that the audience can relate or want to be. That's why a show with an unlikeable protagonist would never be as successful. But of course the cast all need a foil, and the best one is one which you can hate without misgiving because they are so obnoxious, and also one who doesn't appear too much, so you can spend you time laughing instead.The writing is also very good, the show is funny, and it's fast. The 20+ minutes plus commercials go by quickly without any slow and boring parts that make tween and teen fingers itch for remote control control.With iCarly, the show revolves around the titled webcast, but really the show is about relationships (as good shows always are). We have Carly Shay, Freddie the nerd, and Sam the bad girl and Spencer the adult, who is really just a child in adult disguse, and the relationships work very well. Jerry Trainor as Spencer is in fact a very good addition as he becomes a regular adult presence, however without the stifling effect of a real adult.It's also about living vicariously through the cast, who wouldn't want to live without parental supervision, in a totally neato apartment, with great friends, running a webshow, being popular, and having fun things happen once a week? Homework, piano lessons, chores, cleaning up, real schoolwork? Those things are nowhere in sight! For 20+ minutes everyone can cast away their dreary lives and live the life of the most popular and nice clique in school, and that's why everyone loves iCarly!As with other tween/teen shows, as the cast gets older, the content becomes more about romantic relationships, and as one parent reviewer says, it becomes less suitable for the younger viewers. Concerned parents can rightly be there to explain the relationships on the show. I'm not totally against this myself as TV is so ubiquitous and so it can just be an early introduction to relationships and be educational as well.I consider this one of the best Dan Schneider shows. I just hope his next show will be as good. Definitely 10 thumbs up for this one.",5,Excellent!,1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,2457,"['Dan', 'Schneider', 'producer', 'become', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'Law', 'Order', 'etc', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'CSI', 'etc', 'tween', 'teen', 'shows', 'productions', 'Zoey101', 'Drake', 'Josh', 'now', 'iCarly.So', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'shows', 'have', 'likable', 'characters', 'great', 'acting', 'comedy', 'fast', 'script', 'very', 'successful.Most', 'important', 'shows', 'revolve', 'cast', 'likable', 'characters', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'want', 'be', 'why', 'show', 'unlikeable', 'protagonist', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'successful', 'course', 'cast', 'need', 'foil', 'best', 'one', 'one', 'can', 'hate', 'misgiving', 'are', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'also', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'appear', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'laughing', 'instead.The', 'writing', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'funny', 'fast', '20+', 'minutes', 'plus', 'commercials', 'go', 'quickly', 'slow', 'boring', 'parts', 'make', 'tween', 'teen', 'fingers', 'itch', 'remote', 'control', 'control.With', 'iCarly', 'show', 'titled', 'webcast', 'really', 'show', 'relationships', 'good', 'shows', 'always', 'are', 'have', 'Carly', 'Shay', 'Freddie', 'nerd', 'Sam', 'bad', 'girl', 'Spencer', 'adult', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'child', 'adult', 'disguse', 'relationships', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Jerry', 'Trainor', 'Spencer', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'addition', 'regular', 'adult', 'presence', 'however', 'stifling', 'effect', 'real', 'adult.It', 'also', 'living', 'vicariously', 'cast', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'parental', 'supervision', 'totally', 'neato', 'apartment', 'great', 'friends', 'running', 'webshow', 'being', 'popular', 'having', 'fun', 'things', 'happen', 'once', 'week', 'Homework', 'piano', 'lessons', 'chores', 'cleaning', 'up', 'real', 'schoolwork', 'things', 'are', 'nowhere', 'sight', '20+', 'minutes', 'everyone', 'can', 'cast', 'away', 'dreary', 'lives', 'live', 'life', 'most', 'popular', 'nice', 'clique', 'school', 'why', 'everyone', 'iCarly', 'other', 'tween/teen', 'shows', 'cast', 'older', 'content', 'more', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'one', 'parent', 'reviewer', 'less', 'suitable', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Concerned', 'parents', 'can', 'rightly', 'be', 'there', 'explain', 'relationships', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'TV', 'so', 'ubiquitous', 'can', 'just', 'be', 'early', 'introduction', 'relationships', 'be', 'educational', 'well.I', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'Dan', 'Schneider', 'just', 'hope', 'next', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Definitely', '10', 'thumbs', 'up', 'one']","iCarly: Season 1, Vol. 2"
