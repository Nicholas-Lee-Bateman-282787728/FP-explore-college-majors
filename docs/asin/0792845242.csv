I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very ""hush-hush"" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich&eacute; for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film.  This was an art film, so what am I griping about?  I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic.  I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder.  I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clich&eacute;s that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard.  It was unimpressive.  It wasn't bold filmmaking, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story.  Was it to be educational?  I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line.  The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind.  This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland.  The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved.  Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party.  There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex.  There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening.  This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight.  I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway.  From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex.  They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day.  It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant.  There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run.  This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.  I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently.  There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film.  Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route.  The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive ""honey pot"".  It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.Overall, I was not impressed.  There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive ""raw"" sensation by trying to shock the audiences.  One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society.  If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth.  Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game ""Go Fish"".  Ha ha ha h....it just isn't working for me.  I do not recommend this film in the least bit.  There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why.  It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema.

There are visual effects reminiscent of Godard, Bergman, Cassavetes, Warhol. Very interesting. Some parts were lame, such as the gathering of female heads to discuss the prospects of the relationship between Eli and Max, but other scenes made up for this.In one scene the talking heads are discussing what to call the female genitals, and no one says the ""p"" word. That surprised me.The movie did seem a bit sanitized, like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. No bitchiness, no cruelty, no stealing your friend's girlfriend... The goodhearted confr&eacute;rie of lesbians was a little cloying.Finally, I ordered this film from Netflix because I thought it was by a filmmaker who made a legendary lesbian film in 1974.

Hollywood didn't pour megabucks into this movie, and the acting frequently felt self-conscious, almost like small-town community theater, with roles being enacted and lines being recited. Normally, having said this about a movie, I'd give it only one star, and that grudgingly.But this is a movie about people and about romance and about finding a partner. It's a universal theme, even if the particulars (Chicago lesbians) don't match mine (straight SoCal guy). Most refreshingly, it's a love story told without Hollywood cliche. Told well.

I felt I was in trouble early into this movie when the main character began her monologue about her she could have missed meeting the woman of her dreams in a contrived and rather senseless ramble.  I didn't particularly find her observations very witty or rather well written for a character who considered herself something of a writer.The secondary characters seem to be the most interesting ones in the movie.  The little scenes where they laid around trying to think of ways to get Max, the writer, and Ely, who works for a vet, together, were some of the better scenes in the movie.  The main purpose of the movie, which seemed to be to get these two women together just wasn't very interesting, or compelling enough to draw the rest of the movie together.I realize this movie was probably made on a small budget so I'm trying not to critisize the acting too much, although there was definitely some rather poor acting in this movie, along with bad camera shots and audio recording.  I found myself laughing during some scenes, but the problem is, I don't think those scenes were supposed to be funny, it was just my reaction to some of the rather lame scenes that I was watching.I guess if you are into art house films, you might want to give this movie a try, but I don't think it's really worth your time.

152929,AEXGGB9P0MOTN,0792845242,"Sarah Hadley ""I'm a graduate student and Engl...","[2, 2]","To my mind, independent lesbian films almost usually fall into one of two categories: the coming-out story (which is, of course, going to be relevant to almost all of the intended audience), and the somewhat harsher look at the social, political, and familial ramifications of being a gay woman (definitely relevant). ""Go Fish"" eschews both of these traditions, while still occasionally playing them tribute.It looks like an independent film, and it feels like an independent film, but it's smarter than it first appears. The script is very quick, balancing what is really a romantic comedy with darker, more substantial undertones, including some of the ""what does it mean to be a lesbian?"" questions I alluded to above. It functions almost like a classic Greek play, with the very best moments being played as an aside to the action, through the conceit of the chorus (which I kept thinking of as the ""lesbian brains trust""). This would probably be a great stage play, and credit must go to Rose Troche and Guinevere Turner for making something so fresh out of very traditional roots.Unfortunately, the acting just about kills ""Go Fish"" before it even gets out of the gate. With the possible exception of Anastasia Sharp as Daria, only Guinevere Turner seems capable of moving and speaking her lines in a natural, comfortable fashion. Most of the actors seem so stilted, delivering very normal, day-in-the-life dialogue in clipped, nervous tones that are conscious of being watched by a camera. I understand the director probably wanted to save money - indeed, may even have wanted a real-life feel to her work - but I can't think of anything more detrimental to a film like this. While I would probably enjoy sitting and reading the screenplay, I don't think I could watch the whole film again. The performances are just too irritating. Even characters I enjoyed - like T. Wendy McMillan's Kia - began to wear on my nerves by the second half, and that's a bad sign for a film that, without the credits, is barely 80 minutes long.So, do I recommend you see ""Go Fish""? If you're interested in this type of film, then - yes. You should rent and see it once, for sure. It's still worthwhile viewing, but I wish I could give it a heartier recommendation; unfortunately, the only extra on the DVD is the original trailer, so the only reason you have to get the film is the film itself. Just try, if you can, to see the good ideas presented beneath the weak acting.

Until I just ordered a new dvd Ive been watching the same old vhs that is just starting to whistle and jump at the end. lol vhs lasted... This movie isnt for everyone.  Ill say that upfront.  Its shot completely in black and white and is very much independant. The sexy picture on the cover is not a scene from the movie.  The woman on the cover is the lovely Guin Turner but in this movie she plays a tomboy in her early twenties.Its sketchy, with images thrown between scenes. Its narrated by guin turner through a bit of it but her being a writer its a real treat. The women in the film arent perfectly shaped or made up. Some are thick, some skinny, some are flat chested but best yet they are more real than anything youll find in hollywood gay films. The potrayal of the gay community is pretty dead on. Its not a drama or a comedy.  Its got a little bit of both.  Again, its very indie.  If you like the film id suggest following it with ""the watermellon woman"".okay onto the plot. young max west is in a rut and she tends to judge women on their looks and is pretty much on the lookout for ""hip hop barbie"" (as one main characters puts it), she lives with friends and they have decided with other friends to match her up with the seamingly ugly duckling ""ely"" whos got a heart of gold and no fashion sense.  Ely is in a dead relationship and max has a big mouth (sorry lol she does and its always getting her into trouble).  Anyway, they are on a full scale mission through a game they have called ""Go Fish"" to set the two up.  Its a fun trip watching Max grow up and find the beauty in Ely and Ely to learn to allow herself to be happy.
