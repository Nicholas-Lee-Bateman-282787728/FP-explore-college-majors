528519,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXLD,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I remember when this movie was first released and I was just dying to see it.  I was young and stupid and it looked cool.  Well, I never got around to seeing it in the theater and by the time it was released on DVD I wasn't too interested in seeing it.  Then I saw it in a bargain bin at like Walmart or something and so I bought it thinking that it couldn't be all that bad.  I was wrong.  Well, okay honestly it's not the worst movie ever made for I sure have seem much worse, but it's nothing worth watching really.  There are so many things wrong with this movie, so many things that make it any of the following adjectives:Stupid, boring, predictable, ridiculous, annoying, irritating, confusing, pointless...I'm sure there are many more that I could add to this list but I'll refrain at the moment.  The thing is that this could have been more than B-Grade movie fluff but it fails to really elevate itself.  It borrows everything that was unique about countless films yet it doesn't do any of it justice.  In the end it reminds me of a `serious' episode of `Dawson's Creek' or something like that.  The tension the film tries to create in scenes is non-existent and the atmosphere of `party-all-the-time, isn't-this-cool' just doesn't really fulfill.  It's really just a film filled to the brim with clich&eacute;d characters, over-dramatized plot twists that really aren't that dramatic and an ending that fails to really deliver on the goods.The film follows Adrien, a disturbed young girl who needs to move away and start over fresh, get her past behind her.  When she moves to a country club to work she becomes infiltrated into a group of spoiled bratty rich kids whose queen Brittany takes a personal liking to Adrien.  Brittany is not all she seems either for her past may be even darker than Adrien's.It's not that `The In Crowd' didn't have somewhere to go, it just goes somewhere it shouldn't have.  The revelations of both girls `pasts' are a bit misplaced.  One is way over the top and the other is actually much less impressive and creative then I had imagined.  The film seems more interested in making this as teen-attractive as possible with overt sexuality, borderline lesbianism, weird party scenes and a club scene that fails to really deliver anything titillating.  In the end they slack off on the script and character development for nudity and amateur sleuthing (I'm not complaining about the Susan Ward boob scene, it really was the highlight of the film).The directing, editing and most importantly the lighting of the film is atrocious.  In one night scene on the beach in particular it's downright impossible to see what is going on.  Like I said, the film is nothing more than an extended episode of `Dawson's Creek' or `Saved By The Bell' even, so please don't watch with high expectations.  In the end I'm sure there is some enjoyment to be found in `The In Crowd' but nothing substantial enough to really warrant watching the film at all, unless you count Ward's nudity as substantial enjoyment, which I guess technically it could be.",2,Nothing special makes for a dull and unrewarding waste of time...,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,3072,"['remember', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'just', 'dying', 'see', 'was', 'young', 'stupid', 'looked', 'cool', 'Well', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'theater', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Then', 'saw', 'bargain', 'bin', 'Walmart', 'something', 'so', 'bought', 'thinking', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'was', 'wrong', 'Well', 'honestly', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'sure', 'have', 'seem', 'much', 'worse', 'nothing', 'worth', 'watching', 'really', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'following', 'adjectives', 'Stupid', 'boring', 'predictable', 'ridiculous', 'annoying', 'irritating', 'confusing', 'pointless', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'could', 'add', 'list', ""'ll"", 'refrain', 'moment', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'B-Grade', 'movie', 'fluff', 'really', 'elevate', 'everything', 'was', 'unique', 'countless', 'films', 'yet', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'end', 'serious', 'episode', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'something', 'tension', 'film', 'tries', 'create', 'scenes', 'non-existent', 'atmosphere', 'party-all-the-time', ""isn't-this-cool"", 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'fulfill', 'really', 'just', 'film', 'filled', 'brim', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'characters', 'over-dramatized', 'plot', 'twists', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'dramatic', 'ending', 'really', 'deliver', 'goods.The', 'film', 'Adrien', 'disturbed', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'move', 'away', 'start', 'fresh', 'get', 'past', 'When', 'country', 'club', 'work', 'becomes', 'infiltrated', 'group', 'spoiled', 'bratty', 'rich', 'kids', 'queen', 'Brittany', 'personal', 'liking', 'Adrien', 'Brittany', 'not', 'past', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'darker', ""Adrien's.It"", 'not', 'Crowd', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'somewhere', 'go', 'just', 'somewhere', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'revelations', 'girls', 'pasts', 'are', 'bit', 'misplaced', 'One', 'way', 'top', 'other', 'actually', 'much', 'less', 'impressive', 'creative', 'then', 'had', 'imagined', 'film', 'more', 'interested', 'making', 'as', 'teen-attractive', 'possible', 'overt', 'sexuality', 'borderline', 'lesbianism', 'weird', 'party', 'scenes', 'club', 'scene', 'really', 'deliver', 'anything', 'titillating', 'end', 'slack', 'off', 'script', 'character', 'development', 'nudity', 'amateur', 'sleuthing', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'Susan', 'Ward', 'boob', 'scene', 'really', 'was', 'highlight', 'film', '.The', 'directing', 'editing', 'most', 'importantly', 'lighting', 'film', 'atrocious', 'one', 'night', 'scene', 'beach', 'particular', 'downright', 'impossible', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'said', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'extended', 'episode', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'even', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'high', 'expectations', 'end', ""'m"", 'sure', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'found', 'Crowd', 'nothing', 'substantial', 'enough', 'really', 'warrant', 'watching', 'film', 'count', 'Ward', 'nudity', 'substantial', 'enjoyment', 'guess', 'technically', 'could', 'be']",The In Crowd

528521,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00003CXLD,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty boring attempt at suspense.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you like the overdramatic teenage/young adult concept of popular TV shows such as Beverly Hills 90210 and the OC?  Because that's EXACTLY what kind of suspense the In Crowd is centered around.  Some might call it poor acting- I just call it an undeveloped, misleading concept.Young women in college (many of whom are quite beautiful which is probably the only reason I'm not giving the film a 1-star rating) walking around the property having typical conversations and living the typical lifestyle that most people that age prefer to live but... we're supposed to find this overdone concept suspenseful in some way, which is where the fault entirely lies.In the very beginning a girl gets released from a mental hospital and her ""friend"" says ""You'll never make it out there!  They'll see what you're really like!""  This leads one to believe the woman being released has a sick, twisted side to her character but... instead, she's actually VERY normal and it's the *other* girls she meets at her new home/workplace that have the psychological issues (well, one of them at least).For the first hour, there's really no mystery or anything out of the ordinary that would lead one to believe there's something wrong with anybody or anything taking place.  Just young college girls acting normal and participating in normal activities and relationships.  It's awful.  It's misleading too.I recommend skipping it because you won't find any suspense, interesting characterization or storyline development here.  Only near the end when a girl gets murdered in a cheesy hard to believe way do we experience any excitement.

I like those teen slasher movies like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, but this one was too weird and bizarre for my tastes.

528524,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00003CXLD,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 4]","If this film had bi-passed the theater then I may have better things to say about it, for in a B-grade, straight to video kinda way this is a decent thriller, but in the made for the cinema, big budget slasher in the vein of `I Know What you Did Last Summer' meets `Cruel Intentions' it fails miserably.The first downside would be the cast of relative unknowns, the only real `star' in whatever sense of the word you want to use it is Susan Ward (of Soap Opera fame).  It's not that a cast of unknowns is always a bad thing, sometimes it can help propel the careers of the cast (like in the case of Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell & Cole Houser from `Pitch Black') or it can really help keep the focus of the viewers attention on the meat of the material (as in this years `United 93'), but in this case the material was weak and the cast is still careerless to say the least.The second downside is that important piece of the pie called a plot.  The film opens with Adrien (Lori Heuring) being released from a mental institution.  For some strange reason they, as some sort of punishment, send her to work at this ritzy summer beach resort where she meets the popular kids, all followers of the queen-bee Brittany (Susan Ward), so despite her being warned she falls into their little circle.The plot falls to pieces when they shift what could have been a primo baddie roll in the hands of the mental girl and give the sinister role to Brittany she socialite.  The problem here is that her reasons for being so evil are completely ridiculous and unbelievable and strip the script of an ounce of eeriness.Yes Susan Ward is hot but she is far from scary here, in fact in the end when Adrien is running scared from Brittany I'm forced to laugh.  The plot tends to contradict itself a lot, one minute Brittany and Adrien are friends, the next their not, and Brittany never really comes off as trying to do anything bad until all of a sudden she flips, as if for no reason, and the film falls apart fast after that.It could have been a much better movie had the script really been tweaked, but tweaked it was not so good this is not.  Like I said, if your into B-grade (or maybe even C-grade) teen thrillers then this serves up enough hot flesh and pointless acting to satisfy, but if you want something smart and the slightest bit engaging then pass this trash up for something better, please.  As a side note too, the lighting is terrible in a few scenes here, particularly on the beach at night.

It's not anywhere near original, but it's still a fun, smart joyride.The setting revolves around the Cliffmont Country Club.  Everything seems to be perfect there.  The characters are rich and beautiful with promising futures ahead.  They have everything that they could possibly want.  But below the surface level lies a web of deceit, jealousy, and envy.  Some of them hide terrible, dark secrets, and they will do anything to keep them from getting out and ruining their reputation.  Soon, some of those secrets begin unraveling in a terrifying and twisted suspense thriller.While The In Crowd isn't exceptionally great, it's not anywhere near bad either.

All the gorgeous kids are led by seductive socialite Brittany (Susan Ward), whose decadent lifestyle, beautiful but sycophantic friends, and mysterious past has turned her heart as black as charcoal.  Prompted by Brittany's inexplicable initial friendliness (BFFs), Adrien ingratiates herself into the gorgeous group, and get used to the glamorous lifestyle.  It's a great setup, but eventually the cast's beauty must step aside for a plot.Why was Adrien in a loony bin?  Who cares, she looks great in that dress!What's up with the other rich kids?  Um, did you see the blonde bulging out of that pink bikini!?Why is Brittany so inviting with Adrien?  OH EM GEE!  They are both in a clearly frigid pool!Eventually, dark pasts uncover ridiculous revelations that tie the putrid plot together similar to a 4-year old attempting a Windsor knot.  This movie is perfect for a teen crowd (not me), or someone who enjoys the FACT that Susan Ward's exposes her breasts more than once, and they steal the show (me).  For the most part, the problem with the drama is that it's equally impossible for any viewer to look beyond the boobs to believe Ward is scary or Heuring is powerful.It's essentially somewhere between Dawson's Creek and Melrose place, not as innocent as the former, and about as catty as the latter.  Aside from the casting director, this movie doesn't deserve any awards; it's just about hyper-sexual, incredible looking, early twenty-somethings parading around the beach in swimsuits, and attending swank parties.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","This complicated teen movie doesn't know whether it's trying to be a satire or a horror, so it plumps for somewhere in between.  It starts with ex-mental patient Adrien getting a job at a trendy sports facility, catering for a load of rich snobs and drunken fools.  At the head of this `in crowd' is Brittany, a beautiful brunette with a dark past who rapidly accepts Adrien into their group.  Before Adrien knows it she's in the midst of fancy parties wearing expensive dresses and is wanted by all the handsome boys.The central idea of a group of people who struggle against each other in a seemingly endless search for power is intriguing but hardly new.  Brittany rules her clique with an iron rod, using sex as a weapon to get what she wants.  This blatant excuse to have excessive nudity is thankfully handled tongue-in-cheek, which is an altogether wiser approach given the movie's `made for TV' look.  By far the most promising idea is that social rejection is the worst punishment that could be doled out to these kids, with staring eyes and accusing faces represented as infinitely worse than being locked up in an insane asylum.  Also it's nice to have a heroine that isn't exactly perfect herself.  That said, `Heathers' was a much wittier, funnier take on the social structure in a high school and is something that `The In Crowd' just can't compete with.  Yet this is moderately entertaining, with a storming finale that involves prom queens in exquisite dresses chasing each other in high heels, with one carrying a heavy spade over her shoulder.

I'm sure I'm being too harsh for some people, considering the inexplicable amount of 5 star reviews here.  Well, the movie didn't exactly light any fires at the box office, so the supporters of this &quot;entertainment&quot; are in the minority.The main blonde girl vaguely reminded me of a young Sarah Jessica Parker.  The main brunette looked like a blandly attractive hybrid of Tiffany Amber Thiessen and Denise Richards.  The psychiatrist reminded me of Ron Perlman.  What's the point of me saying all this?

With its scantily-clad babes, lurid lesbian come-ons and innuendo-laden lines like ""Didn't mean to get you all wet,"" The In Crowd aspires to Showgirls levels of camp, but while the cast of that much-adored stripper opus did nothing but act, the denizens of The In Crowd couldn't act their way out of a Ziploc.Susan Ward (straight from her masterful work on NBC's canceled ""Sunset Beach"") stars as Brittany, the teen queen of a hoity-toity summer resort. Lori Heuring is reformed psycho Adrien, who becomes a cabana girl at Ward's decadent hot spot. Ward takes Heuring under her wing, and soon, Bad Things start to happen. Is any of it believable? Only if you think bisexual teen seductresses exist in the real world. (See WILD THINGS and CRUEL INTENTIONS for further examination of this epidemic.)Not surprisingly, the whole feminist nightmare was conceived by two men, who, while writing, must have had one hand on the computer and one hand on something else. Meanwhile, Mary Lambert directs as if she is still making Madonna videos: transparently gay actors are cast as womanizers, Ward's lip-gloss plays a supporting role and everyone else seems to have been hired on the basis of how they look in a swimsuit. Politicians will also note how sex, drugs and booze abound in this PG-13 movie totally aimed at teens. Offensive? Nah, just laughably inane. Kudos to Ward, who gleefully dives into her low-rent Basic Instinct-predator role, even if she is woefully ill-equipped to carry it off.For the DVD lovers out there, there is a hilariously knowing, self-deprecating commentary by Ward and Heuring (who are now our two favorite people in the world) as well as deleted scenes and interviews with the cast (one of whom is clearly on drugs).It would seem that Warner Bros. studio executives (circa 2000) would most likely rather die than release an edgy, thought-provoking film. Thankfully, they bankrolled this steller Bad Movies laugh-a-thon, which, justifiably, didn't make a plug nickel.For lovers of unintentional camp and Bad Movies We Love, THE IN CROWD is a must see. A worthy addition alongside such modern day misfires as THE TEMP, THE CRUSH, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE and BASIC INSTINCT 2.
