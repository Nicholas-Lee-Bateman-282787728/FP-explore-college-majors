This movie is pretty darn good, I agree with one of the reviewers stating this film is dated and that's true but the performances make this movie worth while. The ending is a bit silly but this is an important film which deals with a married woman who is suddenly single after her husband walks out.

People, you are missing out on a unique piece of American culture if you neglect this gem.Not only is the acting so astounding , the actors were so naturalistic which was so indicative of the 70's ( and to me , so sorely missed. Not to sound dowdy but so much of today;s acting is merely posing and pouting and trying to look the all-important-sexy-at-all-costs) The story is simple and human, a broken marriage , a woman who finds her core...but told so beautifully  ,and in the background is that city, that city, that city which to me is also another actress in the film, our New York...Also another major plus in the DVD is the commentary by Paul Mazursky and Jill Clayburgh. They have such insight and warmth and interesting commentary, not just about the making of the film but about art and acting and life . To me it was worth it to hear these wonderful artists express their ideas and memories. I have to admit, I love them both and so much of my life was shaped by this movie.It is a truly underrated and underappreciated piece of art. It is ART ! The score is divine too. If you think , after the 1st viewing, that maybe you dont like it, it is too 70s or corny,,, give it another try.

After finally growing up and out of my twenties and several decades later, seeing it again was a great disappointment.  The script lacks a well-wrought through-line for the title character.  There is little transition for her between her separation and her reparation.  A few short weeks go by and she's back out there batting a thousand.  She is an upper East Side woman who also does not have to worry about where the next dollar is coming from.  The plot is ludicrous and asks us to suspend all of our belief systems in order to buy it.However, and this is a big however, Jill Clayburgh, who did not receive the attention she justly deserved -- outshined by Jane Fonda (a lesser actress) and Meryl Streep (a fine one at times) -- delivers a very strong performance in the film.  She makes the whole thing worthwhile.  She possesses a unique talent -- she performs realistically.  She invades the character.  In fact, I wouldn't doubt that the appeal of the film when it opened depended almost entirely on her performance.  I regret not having seen her in much else.

That said, having a number of close friends and associates who have gone through divorce I can appreciate director-writer Paul Mazursky's insightful account of the disintegration of a seemingly perfect marriage.  It's all here: the shock, the depression, the ritual dating.  Jill Clayburgh, in a definitely Oscar-worthy performance, captures all the stages of a person who feels a sense of impregnability only to watch their security collapse around them.

493844,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000006GCW,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Watching Jill Clayburgh relegated to playing Kristen Wiig's pixilated, supportive mother in her last posthumous screen appearance inBridesmaidsmade me flashback to how vibrant a screen presence she was for that brief period between the late seventies and early eighties when the actress represented the feminist ideal on the big screen. For this 1978 dramedy, director/screenwriter Paul Mazursky bypassed several then-bigger names to cast Clayburgh as Erica, an affluent, late-thirtyish Manhattan woman who looks to be leading a charmed life - wife to Martin, a successful stockbroker; mother to Patti, a precocious fifteen-year-old daughter, and part-time employee at a Soho art gallery. However, in one flash of a moment as she talks of summer rental plans on Fire Island, a suddenly bereft Martin collapses and reveals he is in love with another woman, leaving Erica shattered as she battles between reason and rejection with her barely concealed anger.From that point forward in the movie, Mazursky and Clayburgh take us on a hazardous journey of self-discovery which may appear predictable now after hundreds of Lifetime TV-movies but was quite groundbreaking at the time. True, there is a self-satisfying tone to a few of the scenes, especially the inevitable ones with Erica's bohemian, overly serene therapist, but what transcends those glitches is the honesty that permeates her comically awkward attempts at dating, her overreaction to Patti's sexual awakening, and the confessional conversations she has with her circle of best friends, an obvious inspiration for Michael Patrick King inSex and the City. The last quarter of the film gets a bit soft and talky, but the ambiguous ending is classic Mazursky.The performances still hold up very well after all these years with Clayburgh at her undeniable peak fulfilling all the dimensions of an emotionally rich role. Michael Murphy has the unenviable task of playing Martin as both an adulterous weasel and a misguided fool, but he manages it well. As Saul, the popular modern artist who comes to embody everything ideal in an emotionally available male, Alan Bates handles a comparatively easier job with remarkable restraint. A popular child actress at the time, Lisa Lucas plays Patti with brittle sharpness, while Kelly Bishop, Pat Quinn and Linda Miller portray Erica's pals with believable dexterity. Only Cliff Gorman seems rather over-the-top as a lecherous artist on the make for the newly single Erica. The 2006 DVD thankfully offers a lively and informative commentary track from Mazursky and the late Clayburgh as well as the original theatrical trailer.",4,Clayburgh's Textured Turn in Feminist Zeitgeist Film Is Worth Seeing Again,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2626,"['Watching', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'relegated', 'playing', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'pixilated', 'supportive', 'mother', 'last', 'posthumous', 'screen', 'appearance', 'inBridesmaidsmade', 'flashback', 'how', 'vibrant', 'screen', 'presence', 'was', 'brief', 'period', 'late', 'seventies', 'early', 'eighties', 'when', 'actress', 'represented', 'feminist', 'ideal', 'big', 'screen', '1978', 'dramedy', 'director/screenwriter', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'bypassed', 'several', 'then-bigger', 'names', 'cast', 'Clayburgh', 'Erica', 'affluent', 'late-thirtyish', 'Manhattan', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'leading', 'charmed', 'life', 'wife', 'Martin', 'successful', 'stockbroker', 'Patti', 'precocious', 'fifteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'part-time', 'employee', 'Soho', 'art', 'gallery', 'However', 'one', 'flash', 'moment', 'talks', 'summer', 'rental', 'plans', 'Fire', 'Island', 'suddenly', 'bereft', 'Martin', 'reveals', 'love', 'woman', 'leaving', 'Erica', 'shattered', 'reason', 'rejection', 'barely', 'concealed', 'anger.From', 'point', 'forward', 'movie', 'Mazursky', 'Clayburgh', 'take', 'hazardous', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'may', 'appear', 'predictable', 'now', 'hundreds', 'Lifetime', 'TV-movies', 'was', 'quite', 'groundbreaking', 'time', 'True', 'self-satisfying', 'tone', 'few', 'scenes', 'especially', 'inevitable', 'ones', 'Erica', 'bohemian', 'overly', 'serene', 'therapist', 'what', 'glitches', 'honesty', 'comically', 'awkward', 'attempts', 'dating', 'overreaction', 'Patti', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'confessional', 'conversations', 'circle', 'best', 'friends', 'obvious', 'inspiration', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'inSex', 'City', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'bit', 'soft', 'talky', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'classic', 'Mazursky.The', 'performances', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'years', 'Clayburgh', 'undeniable', 'peak', 'fulfilling', 'dimensions', 'emotionally', 'rich', 'role', 'Michael', 'Murphy', 'unenviable', 'task', 'playing', 'Martin', 'adulterous', 'weasel', 'misguided', 'fool', 'well', 'Saul', 'popular', 'modern', 'artist', 'who', 'embody', 'everything', 'ideal', 'emotionally', 'available', 'male', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'comparatively', 'easier', 'job', 'remarkable', 'restraint', 'popular', 'child', 'actress', 'time', 'Lisa', 'Lucas', 'Patti', 'brittle', 'sharpness', 'Kelly', 'Bishop', 'Pat', 'Quinn', 'Linda', 'Miller', 'portray', 'Erica', 'pals', 'believable', 'dexterity', 'Only', 'Cliff', 'Gorman', 'rather', 'over-the-top', 'lecherous', 'artist', 'make', 'newly', 'single', 'Erica', '2006', 'DVD', 'thankfully', 'lively', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Mazursky', 'late', 'Clayburgh', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

It tells the truth that many relationships fail because men treat women as sexual objects.  So during the second half I was expecting a lot of character growth in the woman's role, which there wasn't.  She still ends up a sexual object, just more accepting of that fact.Once the painter with an annoying English accent comes into the picture the movie gets VERY annoying and lame.  And if they had a real relationship in life it would definitely fail since he was a grand WUSSBAG!  There was no emotional connection between the two characters, which is why it seems that the painter is also using her as a sexual object just as all the other men in her life.  She just accepts her sexuality, but at the cost of not growing as a person mentally or spiritually.A movie that started out good but went horribly bad.",2,From Good to Horribly Bad.

Perhaps it's because I'm familiar with the prevailing attitudes that were prevalent in the 70s - in particular, the emergence of feminism and female empowerment. Jill Clayburgh is nothing less that stellar in her role as Erica Benton, devoted wife of an affluent Wall Street type who, in a mid-life crisis, decides he's not happy, and confesses as much (along with the fact that he's been carrying on a year long affair) to his wife. Clayburgh's reaction to this revelation was stark and very realistic. Without giving away the crux of the film, we see Erica go through the emotional wringer at the realization that life for her will never be the same. She must come to terms with who she is as an individual, particularly as a single middle aged woman with a teen daughter, as well as what her expectations from men will be from here on. Some of the poor reviews I've read about this film I would venture to guess are from people that don't care for films that are aiming for an emotional connection with the viewer.

She didn't win but it pushed her into the &quot;A&quot; class for a few good years. It's interesting to witness Clayburgh's career rise and fall as  symptomatic of the public's short love affair with actresses. She still can  be seen in supporting roles and she is as good as she ever was - beautiful,  funny, warm and tender - but she is probably unable to recapture those  &quot;A&quot; bankable heydays. As Erica, a woman who's husband leaves her  for a younger woman, Pauline Kael describes her having an &quot;addled  radiance with a floating not-quite-sure not-quite-here quality&quot;.  Clayburgh is memorable wearing a high-collared tan Albert Wolsky coat with  a snarl on her face that is both funny and real when she is told the news  of the infidelity. Written and directed by Paul Mazursky and burdened with  an annoying Rocky-esque score by Bill Conti, the film has a few slow  improvisational spots but is generally likeable. Ironically, as it raised  Clayburgh's profile, it also was the peak for Mazursky, after films like  Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, Blume in Love and Next Stop, Greenwich  Village in the early 70's. The only later film to match them is Enemies, A  Love Story made  in 1989. The film was also a mainstream breakthrough for  Alan Bates who here wears a beard and is hunkily gorgeous as Erica's love  interest. His rapport with Clayburgh seems genuine and the film improves  once he appears half way through. At the time it was released, Mazursky's  feminist end was criticised for having Erica turn down Bates' request to go  away with her since Bates is presented as irresistible. Kael thought the  only way to balance Erica's &quot;idiotic&quot; decision would be to reveal  Bates' character as a fraud.

493856,A2LDKVHYK36GUJ,B000006GCW,Peter Shilpot Freeman,"[3, 3]","It's very interesting reading the other reviews to this film. The reactions to it are very extreme. Some people love it. Some people hate it and that was exactly the reaction people had to it back in 1978 when it first came out.The late mid to late 70s was New York's era as the 'fashionable city' in the days of fashionable cities. NYC took the torch from Swinging Sixites London as the city every fashionable person wanted to go to, live in, know...It was the 'Disco' capital of the world. It was where the most interesting films were set. It where all the happening artists lived and Unmarried Woman caught the zeitgeist of that time. Even jogging was a new phenomenon back then and NY lead the way with it and 'everyone' wanted to know what people were up to there, even about the jogging. If you'd never been to NYC you were missing out. If you had been to NY and or knew NY, back in 1978, you bragged about it.Unmarried Woman was a product of all this fascination with the city at the time. Trivial details about life in NY had a sort of cachet. Therefore, on reflection, what may seem trite to viewers today, had a strange sort of value back then.Some people sneer at Erica's seemingly privileged position in society. How dare she be so miserable, have you seen where she lives? Well, guess what, wealthy women also feel sad when they are rejected by their husbands for a younger model. And guess what, some people like to look at the lives of people who live in beautiful apartments with views of the river and wizz downtown in yellow cabs on bright New York mornings. In fact it's the contrast between the material privilege and the sadness and loss that makes this film work.Some people are also alarmed by the strong, upfront musical score. Sorry about that. Music in the 70s was strong and upfront in our lives, not just background noise. The wailing saxophone was the pop instrument of the time and the excellent, very 70s soundtrack, is one of the aspects that make watching this film such a powerful, nostalgic and enjoyable ride.Unmarried Woman does have its flaws. It is at times somewhat simplistic and personally, I'm not so sure that Erica was as much of a catch as we're made to believe.This is very much a film of its time and a very interesting time and place it was and I wish they still made films like this today, about adults, for adults, with strong subtle performances, without both eyes on the cash register, without some dreary, over-exposed, under talented  box office 'star' drudging her way through her lines. There was something very adult and sophisticated about American cinema in the 70s and Unmarrried Woman takes its place in the long list of films that were a part of that.Unmarried Woman is a few chapters in the story of the life of an ordinary, reasonably wealthy woman's life. It's beautifully shot. Beautifully scored. Excellently acted and I'm glad it's still there as a memory of a short but memorable time and place.",4,A New-York-In The-Late-70s Timecapsule,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2965,"['very', 'interesting', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'reactions', 'are', 'very', 'extreme', 'people', 'love', 'people', 'hate', 'was', 'exactly', 'reaction', 'people', 'had', 'back', '1978', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out.The', 'late', 'mid', 'late', '70s', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'era', ""'fashionable"", 'city', 'days', 'fashionable', 'cities', 'NYC', 'took', 'torch', 'Swinging', 'Sixites', 'London', 'city', 'fashionable', 'person', 'wanted', 'go', 'live', 'know', 'was', ""'Disco"", 'capital', 'world', 'was', 'where', 'most', 'interesting', 'films', 'were', 'set', 'where', 'happening', 'artists', 'lived', 'Unmarried', 'Woman', 'caught', 'zeitgeist', 'time', 'Even', 'jogging', 'was', 'new', 'phenomenon', 'back', 'then', 'NY', 'lead', 'way', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'up', 'there', 'even', 'jogging', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', 'NYC', 'were', 'missing', 'out', 'had', 'been', 'NY', 'knew', 'NY', 'back', '1978', 'bragged', 'about', 'it.Unmarried', 'Woman', 'was', 'product', 'fascination', 'city', 'time', 'Trivial', 'details', 'life', 'NY', 'had', 'sort', 'cachet', 'Therefore', 'reflection', 'what', 'may', 'seem', 'trite', 'viewers', 'today', 'had', 'strange', 'sort', 'value', 'back', 'then.Some', 'people', 'sneer', 'Erica', 'seemingly', 'privileged', 'position', 'society', 'How', 'dare', 'be', 'so', 'miserable', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'wealthy', 'women', 'also', 'feel', 'sad', 'when', 'are', 'rejected', 'husbands', 'younger', 'model', 'guess', 'what', 'people', 'look', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'beautiful', 'apartments', 'views', 'river', 'wizz', 'downtown', 'yellow', 'cabs', 'bright', 'New', 'York', 'mornings', 'fact', 'contrast', 'material', 'privilege', 'sadness', 'loss', 'film', 'work.Some', 'people', 'are', 'also', 'alarmed', 'strong', 'upfront', 'musical', 'score', 'Sorry', 'Music', '70s', 'was', 'strong', 'upfront', 'lives', 'not', 'just', 'background', 'noise', 'wailing', 'saxophone', 'was', 'pop', 'instrument', 'time', 'excellent', 'very', '70s', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'aspects', 'make', 'watching', 'film', 'powerful', 'nostalgic', 'enjoyable', 'ride.Unmarried', 'Woman', 'have', 'flaws', 'times', 'somewhat', 'simplistic', 'personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'Erica', 'was', 'much', 'catch', ""'re"", 'made', 'believe.This', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'time', 'very', 'interesting', 'time', 'place', 'was', 'wish', 'still', 'made', 'films', 'today', 'about', 'adults', 'adults', 'strong', 'subtle', 'performances', 'eyes', 'cash', 'register', 'dreary', 'over-exposed', 'talented', 'box', 'office', 'drudging', 'way', 'lines', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'adult', 'sophisticated', 'American', 'cinema', '70s', 'Unmarrried', 'Woman', 'place', 'long', 'list', 'films', 'were', 'part', 'that.Unmarried', 'Woman', 'few', 'chapters', 'story', 'life', 'ordinary', 'reasonably', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'life', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Beautifully', 'scored', 'Excellently', 'acted', ""'m"", 'glad', 'still', 'there', 'memory', 'short', 'memorable', 'time', 'place']",N/A

We follow her through her days of rising in the morning to 'Swan Lake', getting her husband and daughter off each morning, and then finding her own way. Lunch with her friends, her days at the gallery, home at night with her family.And, then, it all fell apart when her husband confesses he has fallen in love with a younger woman and is moving out. Here she is, trying to pull herself together, yelling at her teen aged daughter because she needed to let off steam. Talking things over with her therapist, and then the liquid lunches with her friends. Dating and hosting all the men, trying to forgo their passes.  Meeting Mr Right or is he,  falling in love again.This is such a funny, true film, heartbreaking at times. And so much of what's best is because of Jill Clayburgh, whose performance is the best.

The setting is New York City in the late 70s. Michael Murphy plays a successful stockbroker and Jill Clayburgh is his wife. She works part time at a high priced art gallery. We see her meeting her girlfriends after work at a local bar where they discuss their sexual experiences, divorces and marital problems. Jill Clayburgh's character is still deeply in love with her husband and they seem to have a good marital relationship. One day they meet for lunch and he tells her he met a woman in Bloomingdales and is in love with her and plans to move in with her. From that point we see some of the awkward situations she gets thrown into with eligible men that turn out to be jerks, One guy is a press agent that tries to force himself on her in a cab, and she finally decides she has to get back out there and start meeting men. She has sex with an artist she had met at the art gallery and regrets the experience until she gets into a relationship with another artist (Alan Bates). Through him she learns to stand on her feet and finds the confidence to reject her husband when his love muffin throws him out.
