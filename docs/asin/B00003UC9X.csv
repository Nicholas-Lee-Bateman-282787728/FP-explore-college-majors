546751,A3JWVMLYSYQOSJ,B00003UC9X,"AlwaysLearning ""Happy2Be""","[1, 1]","I bought this DVD a few months ago and like the other reviewers found it to be motivating.  The instructor, Beth Lane, has a great smile and is very motivating and encouraging. I spent a month just watching the video while doing only the ""Home Base"" moves! There are 3 different workouts of a little under 15 minutes each which makes this a nice cardio workout for when I am short of time.  Each workout includes warm up moves.  The class looks like they are having a lot of fun.  I like that Beth talked about the cultural aspects of the movements as she demonstrated them. The footwork on some of the movements was too challenging for me at first but because the drum music, the instructor and the students were entertaining, I didn't feel clumsy...just kept doing the ""home base"" steps. Enjoy!",5,"Fun, cultural and motivating change of pace!",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,796,"['bought', 'DVD', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'be', 'motivating', 'instructor', 'Beth', 'Lane', 'great', 'smile', 'very', 'motivating', 'encouraging', 'spent', 'month', 'just', 'watching', 'video', 'doing', 'only', 'Home', 'Base', 'are', '3', 'different', 'workouts', 'little', '15', 'minutes', 'nice', 'cardio', 'workout', 'when', 'am', 'short', 'time', 'workout', 'warm', 'up', 'moves', 'class', 'are', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'like', 'Beth', 'talked', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'movements', 'demonstrated', 'footwork', 'movements', 'was', 'too', 'challenging', 'first', 'drum', 'music', 'instructor', 'students', 'were', 'entertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'clumsy', 'just', 'kept', 'doing', 'home', 'base', 'steps', 'Enjoy']",The Method - Afro-Brazilian Cardio VHS
546752,A1G69BQLIUMWPN,B00003UC9X,cassidrm,"[4, 5]",I found this exercise video to be a fun one.  I bought it when it came out on VHS so I have owned it for a while now.  I think it is a great workout and altough you don't really break a sweat unless you push yourself harder than the video it is still fun to do on easy days!  I feel goofey doing some of the moves but once you do it a few times you get over that feeling.  The instructor is also one that will not annoy you as many do.  If you like dancing and you like a change from the norm then I would recommend this video to you!,4,Fun!,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,534,"['found', 'exercise', 'video', 'be', 'fun', 'one', 'bought', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'have', 'owned', 'while', 'now', 'think', 'great', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'sweat', 'push', 'harder', 'video', 'still', 'fun', 'do', 'easy', 'days', 'feel', 'goofey', 'doing', 'moves', 'once', 'do', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'feeling', 'instructor', 'also', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'annoy', 'many', 'do', 'like', 'dancing', 'like', 'change', 'norm', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'video']",The Method - Afro-Brazilian Cardio VHS
546753,A26IPZJ4OA05RU,B00003UC9X,Food Fan,"[0, 0]","Fun dance-based workout.I would recommend for a wide range audience:BEGINNERS may need to repeat the workout several times before they become comfortable with the steps, but most of the steps are not so inherently complicated that a beginner couldn't eventually do.  I would recommend for beginners to start out by concentrating on the arm/hip motions (not do the arm motions) and do the motions in a smaller, less exagerated way.For those with bad knees etc, there are only a few jumping moves and they are easily modifiable to a non-impaction motion.INTERMED/ADVANCED will find that the moves look simple and easy, but actually do give a great cardio/sweat workout because most of the workout is nonstop and uses large full body movements that include athe arms.The DVD is divided into three 15minute sections.You can do just one or several at a time.Each segment starts wtih a ~3min WarmUp to loosen you up with mostly back rolls (which is relative to the workout that follows); even if you're doing more than one section at a time, the next ""warmup"" didn't feel like a waste of time because I appreciated stretching my back again and having a ""breather""  in between the more intense ""dance workout"" sections.The rest of each section is a dance routine that you learn; the teacher introduces one step at a time, and then adds on a new step.I like how there are a wide variety of moves so that it doesn't feel redundant and also makes your body move in ways that standard workouts might not.I also like how she cues each step without saying left/right, so users can easily ""mirror"" her or do the moves on the same side she is (whatever you prefer)Good production:Quality camera shots show her feet & full body.Talented & energetic ""students"" in sync with teacher. (except for a moment when one of the students went the wrong direction, but I felt this was a neglible 2 second blip)Nice set.Few minor drawbacks:The live drummers play the same beat throughout, sounds very repetitive.If you have a bad back you might want to skip out on this dvd (or at least do the motions smaller & slower until you feel comfortable with them).Overall the majority of moves are sufficiently demo'd/taught.  However, in the the 2nd & 3rd workout there were 2 hip movements that I wish she had demo'd in slow-motion, because until I figure out these 2 moves, I'll look like a waddling chicken.If you are interested in this video, it is sort of similar to Debra Ono's african dance and Vanessa Isaac's brazilian/samba dance DVD's.(While I like all of these, I personally like this one more than Debra Ono's because this seems less cheesy and has more variety of steps)",4,Fun dance-based workout.,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2650,"['Fun', 'dance-based', 'workout.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'wide', 'range', 'audience', 'BEGINNERS', 'may', 'need', 'repeat', 'workout', 'several', 'times', 'become', 'comfortable', 'steps', 'most', 'steps', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'inherently', 'complicated', 'beginner', 'could', ""n't"", 'eventually', 'do', 'would', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'start', 'out', 'concentrating', 'arm/hip', 'motions', 'not', 'do', 'arm', 'motions', 'do', 'motions', 'smaller', 'less', 'exagerated', 'way.For', 'bad', 'knees', 'etc', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'jumping', 'moves', 'are', 'easily', 'modifiable', 'non-impaction', 'motion.INTERMED/ADVANCED', 'will', 'find', 'moves', 'look', 'simple', 'easy', 'actually', 'do', 'give', 'great', 'cardio/sweat', 'workout', 'most', 'workout', 'nonstop', 'large', 'full', 'body', 'movements', 'include', 'arms.The', 'DVD', 'divided', 'three', '15minute', 'sections.You', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'several', 'time.Each', 'segment', '~3min', 'WarmUp', 'loosen', 'up', 'mostly', 'back', 'rolls', 'relative', 'workout', 'even', ""'re"", 'doing', 'more', 'one', 'section', 'time', 'next', 'warmup', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'waste', 'time', 'appreciated', 'stretching', 'back', 'again', 'having', 'breather', 'more', 'intense', 'dance', 'workout', 'sections.The', 'rest', 'section', 'dance', 'routine', 'learn', 'teacher', 'one', 'step', 'time', 'then', 'new', 'step.I', 'how', 'are', 'wide', 'variety', 'moves', 'so', ""n't"", 'feel', 'redundant', 'also', 'body', 'move', 'ways', 'standard', 'workouts', 'might', 'not.I', 'also', 'how', 'step', 'saying', 'left/right', 'users', 'can', 'easily', 'mirror', 'do', 'moves', 'same', 'side', 'prefer', 'Good', 'production', 'Quality', 'camera', 'show', 'feet', 'full', 'body.Talented', 'energetic', 'students', 'sync', 'teacher', 'moment', 'when', 'one', 'students', 'went', 'wrong', 'direction', 'felt', 'was', 'neglible', '2', 'second', 'blip', 'Nice', 'set.Few', 'minor', 'drawbacks', 'live', 'drummers', 'play', 'same', 'beat', 'very', 'repetitive.If', 'have', 'bad', 'back', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'out', 'dvd', 'least', 'do', 'motions', 'smaller', 'slower', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'majority', 'moves', 'are', 'sufficiently', ""demo'd/taught"", 'However', '2nd', '3rd', 'workout', 'were', '2', 'hip', 'movements', 'wish', 'had', 'demo', ""'d"", 'slow-motion', 'figure', '2', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'look', 'waddling', 'chicken.If', 'are', 'interested', 'video', 'sort', 'similar', 'Debra', 'Ono', 'african', 'dance', 'Vanessa', 'Isaac', 'brazilian/samba', 'dance', 'DVD', 'like', 'personally', 'one', 'more', 'Debra', 'Ono', 'less', 'cheesy', 'more', 'variety', 'steps']",The Method - Afro-Brazilian Cardio VHS

Yes, it is a bit challanging, and yes, there is a bit of confusion, but after you watch it a time or two you can get the hang of it!  I didn't have the same problem that one viewer did when the instructor demonstrated a new move while her dancers did another.  You just keep following the background dancers while she is demonstrating the new move and then she incorporates it into the next set.  This was so fun to me that I was willing to look over the fact that it could have been more polished.  The drums are great, and if you can't do some of the exercises you can improvise until you are ready to do them - I have!  It's just nice to take a break from some of your run of the mill exercise tapes and have a little fun with dance!  I have knee difficulties and found that this did not bother me.  The heel chugs(sp?) might be a challange, but I just don't do as pronounced a move.",5,Add a little spice to your workout!,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,980,"['know', 'are', 'flaws', 'video', 'are', 'minor', 'really', 'liked', 'video', 'Yes', 'bit', 'challanging', 'yes', 'bit', 'confusion', 'watch', 'time', 'two', 'can', 'get', 'hang', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'one', 'viewer', 'did', 'when', 'instructor', 'demonstrated', 'new', 'move', 'dancers', 'did', 'just', 'keep', 'following', 'background', 'dancers', 'demonstrating', 'new', 'move', 'then', 'next', 'set', 'was', 'so', 'fun', 'was', 'willing', 'look', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'polished', 'drums', 'are', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'exercises', 'can', 'improvise', 'are', 'ready', 'do', 'have', 'just', 'nice', 'take', 'break', 'run', 'mill', 'exercise', 'tapes', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'dance', 'have', 'knee', 'difficulties', 'found', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'heel', 'chugs', 'sp', 'might', 'be', 'challange', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'pronounced', 'move']",The Method - Afro-Brazilian Cardio VHS
546755,AESPPXJJOPPYH,B00003UC9X,Kaulika,"[26, 26]","This DVD does not pretend to try to make you an expert at Afro-Brazilian dance, and that's a good thing, because it won't. But it is definitely inspired by that dance style, and takes moves directly from Afro-Brazilian dance and weaves them into a dance that you can do with a smile on your face.Each of the three segments on this workout are short, which is good if you don't have a lot of time, and can be strung together, which is good if you do have a lot of time. I'm a fan of short, sweet workouts, and this has three good ones. Even in 15 minutes, it gets your heart going, but is gentle enough for a beginner.The thing I love the most about this DVD is how it encourages you to use your whole body, to loosen up and feel the rhythm. There are moments, however, where a complicated move is not demonstrated very well (such as &quot;The Watussi&quot;), and so you might get a little frustrated until you've practiced it a bit. There are also places that have some jumping, which is a little high-impact for those of us with knee problems (or who live on the second floor of apartment complexes with hardwood floors), and there's no modification given for these. I get around this by doing my own modifications to the moves, and have just as much fun.If you don't mind not being &quot;perfect&quot; at the moves and want to have a lot of fun with a good, generally easy (but still invigorating) aerobic workout, this is the DVD for you.",4,"good workout, a little bit steep on the learning curve",1061510400,"08 22, 2003",2003,1441,"['DVD', 'not', 'pretend', 'try', 'make', 'expert', 'Afro-Brazilian', 'dance', 'good', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'definitely', 'inspired', 'dance', 'style', 'moves', 'directly', 'Afro-Brazilian', 'dance', 'dance', 'can', 'do', 'smile', 'face.Each', 'three', 'segments', 'workout', 'are', 'short', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'strung', 'together', 'good', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'time', ""'m"", 'fan', 'short', 'sweet', 'workouts', 'three', 'good', 'ones', 'Even', '15', 'minutes', 'heart', 'going', 'gentle', 'enough', 'beginner.The', 'thing', 'love', 'most', 'DVD', 'how', 'use', 'whole', 'body', 'loosen', 'up', 'feel', 'rhythm', 'are', 'moments', 'however', 'where', 'complicated', 'move', 'not', 'demonstrated', 'very', 'well', 'such', 'quot', 'Watussi', 'quot', 'so', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'frustrated', ""'ve"", 'practiced', 'bit', 'are', 'also', 'places', 'have', 'jumping', 'little', 'high-impact', 'knee', 'problems', 'who', 'live', 'second', 'floor', 'apartment', 'complexes', 'hardwood', 'floors', 'modification', 'given', 'get', 'doing', 'own', 'modifications', 'moves', 'have', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'not', 'being', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'moves', 'want', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'good', 'generally', 'easy', 'still', 'invigorating', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'DVD']",The Method - Afro-Brazilian Cardio VHS
