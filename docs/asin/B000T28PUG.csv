The show is delicious social satire, set in the excesses of uber-rich Hollywood, but the themes apply to any society - friendship, honesty, loyalty, decency, contrasted with social climbing, backstabbing, greed, jealously and posturing. It all takes place in the wealthy stratosphere of Hollywood society, so you can count on gorgeous sets, cars and clothes and dreamy California scenery. Messing is hilarious, moving, and refreshing as the lead, and she has a wonderful supporting cast.Messing's husband was played brilliantly by Peter Jacobson in the mini-series, perfectly cast as a nebbishy, self-serving jerk.

She gave her cheating ex-husband too much when she should have made him pay.The best part of the series is when her ex-husband to be takes a bit too much Viagra in hopes of getting it on with his young girlfriend when he proposes marriage that night. The girlfriend obviously turned him down since he's left with a five hour ""arousal"" and calls his ex-wife to be. The plot is pretty predictable and leaves much to the imagination.Judy Davis as one of her best friends makes his whole mini-series enjoyable, as does the male friend.Overall, it's entertaining to watch at least once, unless like me you stand watching a show where the woman is stepped all over with.",3,Enjoyable and entertaining.,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,966,"['watched', 'interest', 'times', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'times', 'found', 'laughing', 'other', 'times', 'heroine', 'portrayed', 'talented', 'Messing', 'needed', 'backbone', 'character', 'far', 'being', 'strong', 'woman', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'gave', 'cheating', 'ex-husband', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'pay.The', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'when', 'ex-husband', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Viagra', 'hopes', 'getting', 'young', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'marriage', 'night', 'girlfriend', 'obviously', 'turned', 'down', 'left', 'five', 'hour', 'arousal', 'ex-wife', 'be', 'plot', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'much', 'imagination.Judy', 'Davis', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'whole', 'mini-series', 'enjoyable', 'male', 'friend.Overall', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'stand', 'watching', 'show', 'where', 'woman', 'stepped']",The Starter Wife

Having family members in &#34;the business&#34; I can testify that a lot of Hollywood is exactly as portrayed- completely over the top and egocentric- blind to anything that isn't their milieu. I've had some experience with producers so consumed with themselves that they border on sociopathology. This was an accurate and funny portrayal. The acting was top notch!,5,Great Show- sad cancelled,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,416,"['loved', 'quirky', 'characters', 'escapades', 'Having', 'family', 'members', '34', 'business', '34', 'can', 'testify', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'exactly', 'portrayed-', 'completely', 'top', 'egocentric-', 'blind', 'anything', ""n't"", 'milieu', ""'ve"", 'had', 'experience', 'producers', 'so', 'consumed', 'border', 'sociopathology', 'was', 'accurate', 'funny', 'portrayal', 'acting', 'was', 'top', 'notch']",The Starter Wife
