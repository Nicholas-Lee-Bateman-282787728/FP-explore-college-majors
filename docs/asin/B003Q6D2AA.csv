I'm glad to hear there will be an extended unrated edition along with the normal edition. For anyone wondering, the blu ray version comes with the movie in blu ray (Which has a bunch more special features), DVD, digital copy, and a third disk with the original film from theaters with 4 pairs of 3D glasses to watch the movie in 3d. I'm really pissed that I'm gonna have to buy a separate DVD copy though since this only comes with the blu ray and the 3D DVD. i hate those stupid blue and red 3D glasses but for jackass i can make an exception.",5,stupid in a new dimension,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,654,"['went', 'theaters', 'knowing', 'i', 'was', 'going', 'love', 'i', 'did', 'however', 'i', 'felt', 'was', 'WAAAAAAAY', 'too', 'short', ""'m"", 'glad', 'hear', 'will', 'be', 'extended', 'unrated', 'edition', 'normal', 'edition', 'anyone', 'wondering', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'movie', 'blu', 'ray', 'Which', 'bunch', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'third', 'disk', 'original', 'film', 'theaters', '4', 'pairs', '3D', 'glasses', 'watch', 'movie', '3d', ""'m"", 'really', 'pissed', ""'m"", 'gon', 'have', 'buy', 'separate', 'DVD', 'copy', 'only', 'blu', 'ray', '3D', 'DVD', 'i', 'hate', 'stupid', 'blue', 'red', '3D', 'glasses', 'jackass', 'i', 'can', 'make', 'exception']",N/A

These appear to be words to live by for the ""Jackass"" crew, who are back for a third round of shenanigans in ""Jackass 3D."" The guys that hurt themselves for laughs so you don't have to are back in full form and if you think age has tempered their appetite for danger and potty-humor, then you are sorely mistaken.Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Chris Pontius, Dave England, Ehren McGhehey -- all the names and faces you've come to know over the years -- make their return (with a few stragglers left behind, naturally) to the feature-length film format to abuse 3D technology in ways that would infuriate James Cameron. Flying feces? Check. Unnecessarily exposed male genitalia? Check. The ever-reliable vomiting of a now-sober Steve-O?  You bet. If you thought the envelope had been pushed as far as it would go before, think again. This ""Jackass"" is a full three dimensions of dumb and disgusting.Tastelessness aside, there's something both cinematic and slightly sentimental about this installment. Maybe it's all the slow-motion shots and Rocky references, but for the first time it appears as if director Jeff Tremaine is taking his craft a bit more seriously. The over-the-top opening and closing of the movie are nothing short of epic (at least by MTV standards) and if anything, it's the finest looking ""Jackass"" to date. Likewise, the cast seems to be stepping it up a notch; not only are they going to the extreme here, but they seem to be enjoying it more than ever. The film just so happens to mark the tenth-year anniversary of the franchise, so it's no coincidence that the sense of camaraderie is tighter than before. For the first time, it appears as though the guys are having as much fun laughing at themselves as we are.There are plenty of memorable stunts -- from an updated porto-potty gag dubbed ""The Poo-Cocktail Supreme"" to a stinker of a man-made volcano and a scene involving bees that rivals the hilariousness of Nic Cage in the infamousThe Wicker Manremake -- and just as many laughs to go around. Cameos from the likes of Sean William Scott, Weezer, Rip Taylor, and Beavis and Butt-Head are along for the ride, but the true stars remain the main crew and their non-stop disregard for their own well-being. Dumb and reckless, yet unrelentingly amusing, this third installment in the unlikely franchise is guaranteed to have you giggling mindlessly while simultaneously squirming in your seat.",4,Warning: Complete and Utter Dumb Fun,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,2573,"['great', 'Mike', 'Patton', 'once', 'sang', 'always', 'funny', 'someone', 'hurt', 'then', 'just', 'hilarious', 'appear', 'be', 'words', 'live', 'Jackass', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'back', 'third', 'round', 'shenanigans', 'Jackass', '3D', 'guys', 'hurt', 'laughs', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'are', 'back', 'full', 'form', 'think', 'age', 'tempered', 'appetite', 'danger', 'potty-humor', 'then', 'are', 'sorely', 'mistaken.Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Steve-O', 'Bam', 'Margera', 'Ryan', 'Dunn', 'Wee', 'Man', 'Preston', 'Lacy', 'Chris', 'Pontius', 'Dave', 'England', 'Ehren', 'McGhehey', 'names', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'years', 'make', 'return', 'few', 'stragglers', 'left', 'behind', 'naturally', 'feature-length', 'film', 'format', 'abuse', '3D', 'technology', 'ways', 'would', 'infuriate', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Flying', 'feces', 'Check', 'Unnecessarily', 'exposed', 'male', 'genitalia', 'Check', 'ever-reliable', 'vomiting', 'now-sober', 'Steve-O', 'bet', 'thought', 'envelope', 'had', 'been', 'pushed', 'as', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'think', 'again', 'Jackass', 'full', 'three', 'dimensions', 'dumb', 'disgusting.Tastelessness', 'aside', 'something', 'cinematic', 'slightly', 'sentimental', 'installment', 'slow-motion', 'shots', 'Rocky', 'references', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Jeff', 'Tremaine', 'taking', 'craft', 'bit', 'more', 'seriously', 'over-the-top', 'opening', 'closing', 'movie', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'epic', 'least', 'MTV', 'standards', 'anything', 'finest', 'looking', 'Jackass', 'date', 'Likewise', 'cast', 'be', 'stepping', 'up', 'notch', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'going', 'extreme', 'here', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'more', 'ever', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'mark', 'tenth-year', 'anniversary', 'franchise', 'coincidence', 'sense', 'camaraderie', 'tighter', 'before', 'first', 'time', 'guys', 'are', 'having', 'much', 'fun', 'laughing', 'are', 'plenty', 'memorable', 'stunts', 'updated', 'porto-potty', 'gag', 'dubbed', 'Poo-Cocktail', 'Supreme', 'stinker', 'man-made', 'volcano', 'scene', 'involving', 'bees', 'hilariousness', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'infamousThe', 'Wicker', 'Manremake', 'just', 'many', 'laughs', 'go', 'around', 'Cameos', 'likes', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'Weezer', 'Rip', 'Taylor', 'Beavis', 'Butt-Head', 'are', 'ride', 'true', 'stars', 'remain', 'main', 'crew', 'non-stop', 'disregard', 'own', 'well-being', 'Dumb', 'reckless', 'yet', 'unrelentingly', 'amusing', 'third', 'installment', 'unlikely', 'franchise', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'giggling', 'mindlessly', 'simultaneously', 'squirming', 'seat']",N/A

The 3D aspect isn't even really used so this isn't an in-your-face presentation. Still, I laughed my a** off with the last two films and this one was no diffent. I'm suprised these guys haven't killed anyone yet. This was as funny as the last two films but I think filming it in 3D was part of the joke. There is plenty of depth in the 3D but nothing really in your face. Looks like it was made to be an anaglyph release eventually but really in 2D is still best for this type of movie and that version is included with bonus footage. Never thought I'd say it but a good 3D release but it is still so much worth it to watch these morons hurt themselves in any dimention. Watch in 2D.

1357567,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003Q6D2AA,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","The ""Jackass"" boys have gotten about as close as they can get to prostitution without having to stand on a curb, flag down a car, and offer the driver sexual favors. They will do anything - and I really do mean anything - to get a laugh, no matter how dangerous, no matter how disgusting, no matter how monumentally ill-conceived. One cannot help but be fascinated by people whose minds work like that. I don't know what they find so appealing about degrading themselves, and I certainly don't understand their need to risk life, limb, and their genitals, but that's exactly what they've been doing and will probably continue to do for as long as people find it funny. This too is fascinating. Why exactly does it say about society that we can actually laugh at someone acting reckless in front of a camera? I'm not posing a rhetorical question. I'm genuinely curious.It is with that in mind that I find myself in the position of reviewing ""Jackass 3D,"" the third film to have spawned from the hit MTV series. Four years ago, when I reviewed ""Jackass: Number Two,"" I simultaneously warned people to stay away and admitted the perverse pleasure I got out of watching it, in effect confusing both myself and my readers. My confusion isn't as deep this time around; I confess that I laughed at a few select moments, but on the whole, it just didn't seem as funny this time around. Maybe I was put off by the 3D, which was good only in the sense that objects seemed to be coming at me (God knows we need more immersive shots of human excrement erupting from its source). Or maybe four years gives you enough time to rethink your perversities. Whatever the case, I maintain now as I maintained then that no incarnation of ""Jackass"" is recommendable, regardless of how often one may laugh.It could be that I'm starting to wonder about the cast. At one time, I assumed that being a part of ""Jackass"" was merely a phase. Phases, as you know, are meant to be outgrown. When the series first went on the air back in 2000, most of the cast were in their early to late twenties, which is still young enough to get away with being irresponsible. Now that they're in their thirties and beyond, maybe it's time to consider growing up. I'm all for being young at heart, but there does come a point when acting stupidly stops being funny and becomes a sad, desperate ploy for attention. The fact that Johnny Knoxville is a father makes me even more uneasy. I can only hope he raises his children with the clich&eacute; but nonetheless important motto, ""Do as I say, not as I do.""What prevents me from completely dismissing the film are select scenes that are not only viscously funny, but also in command of the 3D format. A prologue sequence, for example, has Beavis and Butt-head explaining that the film you're about to see is in 3D; Butt-head then demonstrate the process by repeated smacking Beavis, which is to say his fists come flying directly at the camera. Immediately following this, we're reintroduced to the cast, who find themselves on a soundstage rigged with explosives; they detonate one by one during the opening credits, and we're treated to the site of ridiculously costumed men being thrown at, over, and across the camera's lens in super slow motion. A very similar scene closes the film. If there was ever a doubt in anyone's mind that Johnny Knoxville and his friends were jackasses, here is the perfect reminder.In between these scenes are a series of skits, stunts, and gags that test the limits of fortitude - more so, I suspect, for the audience than for the cast. There are the trailer-friendly skits, such as a gigantic plastic hand rigged to knock people over as they pass through the doorway of an office building, or Knoxville learning the hard way that you truly can't roller skate in a buffalo herd. And then there are the skits that aren't so trailer-friendly, such as when the boys play Teatherball with a hive full of Africanized bees, or when Steve-O takes a reverse bungee-jump ride in a Port-o-Potty full of excrement, or when the obese Preston Lacy wedges an apple in his crack and waits for a pig to come along and eat it. And how could I ever forget the moment Steve-O drinks a cup full of Lacy's sweat? Steve-O immediately vomits all over the floor. So too does the cameraman, and we will see him do this a few more times before the movie comes to an end. Think I've spoiled everything for you? This is but a mere sample of the many revolting stunts the film contains.How do I rate a movie like this? Movie reviews are typically coupled with an overall rating, but this time around, it feels like a useless endeavor. It didn't seem that way four years ago, but I guess things change with the passage of time. Since I don't have a choice, I have to keep a few things in mind: (1) The film achieves exactly what it wanted to achieve; (2) I was repulsed and shocked at the sheer depravity of the cast; (3) I couldn't tear my eyes away regardless; and (4) this is not a film that anyone in their right minds should pay to see, no matter how much we as Americans get a kick out of juvenile stupidity. I will go ahead a give ""Jackass 3D"" three stars, which should adequately split the difference. Here's hoping I will never again find myself in the same position.",3,Stupidity Enters a New Dimension,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,5285,"['Jackass', 'boys', 'have', 'gotten', 'as', 'close', 'can',

It's called Jackass 3D for a reason folks: it's a bunch of jackasses in 3D, okay? If I have to explain it clearer than that, then don't watch the movie and stop reading because you just aren't going to get it.Is it stupid? God, yes. Is it disgusting? BEYOND. But is it funny? It's freaking hilarious! Would you or I do these things? No. But man, do I love watching other idiots do them! And that's the appeal.Johnny Knoxville, who no joke will soon be appearing in a movie alongside none other than the musical legend, Cher; returns to his beloved franchise, complete with every member of his league of morons from Steve-O to Wee Man.How does one review this film? I suppose you just go over how ridiculous and funny the stunts were, right? Okay. Seeing Knoxville launch off of a ramp into a pile of manure, via a jet ski was up there; as was seeing him attacked by a large bull. Then there are the gags of throwing various things into the rear of a jet, to have them launched at God knows how many miles an hour, at your pals who are waiting in a nearby field.There is a lot of urine, fecal matter, vomit and other vile things. There are snakes dropped on people, scorpions pinching and stinging a mouth, a ram ramming the hell out of idiots etc, etc, etc.One of my favorites is the theme from Rocky playing while one culprit sneaks up behind someone and douses their face with a cup of water. The knee-jerk reaction is to turn your face in the opposite direction; only rather than safety, you're met by a smashing blow from a fist wrapped snuggly into a boxing glove. And of course, this is all shown in slow motion for... effect.I could go on and on but that would defeat the purpose. If you've read this far, then you are either extremely bored or plan on seeing the film. So if you plan to see it, go see it; and if you are extremely bored - go see it!I'm sure there are parents, religious prudes, animal rights activists and goody-goodies who just want to spoil any and all fun for the rest of us, that are doing all they can to squash this franchise.

1357572,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Q6D2AA,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","Reviewing a film like Jackass 3D is harder than it looks even though this is the third installment in the film franchise, which came after a TV series that lasted for three seasons. Nearly everyone can recognize the franchise by name yet the people involved aren't actually actors (everyone is listed ""as himself"" in the credits) and a coherent story is nonexistent. With Jackass, you know what you're getting up front; a bunch of guys doing nothing but the most stupid and idiotic things for an hour and a half that usually involve their own genitalia or feces or both. You either think it's hilarious or downright hate it and judging by the packed theater a few nights ago, there's still a craving for Jackass.Jackass 3D utilizes the 3D effect very well. That credit can go to the film actually being shot in the format rather than it being shot conventionally and converted to 3D later on. The opening and closing of the film are the best 3D examples; all of the explosions, paintballs, dildos, and God-knows-what flying at your face. As inane as it was, it was still nice to see the effect put to good use rather than just tacked on to make an extra $3 a ticket.The more ridiculous and senseless stunts in Jackass have always drawn more interest on my end in comparison to the more crude bits involving bodily fluids. While Jackass 3D does have the honor of not only being the only film but the only film presented in 3D that features a bungee outhouse and a man drinking the sweat of another man, it's things like Electric Avenue (which features stun guns attached to strings and a spinning cattle prod), Bam's version of the Rocky films, and the Wee Man segment in the bar that features other midgets that are the real high points of the film.Jackass 3D is exactly what you're expecting, but there's something about it that's intriguing. Once you start watching, you can't look away. You have to see how far this imbecility will go. Never has the phrase, ""like watching a train wreck in slow motion,"" fit so well. While the film is certainly far from brilliant, there's a bit more creativity to it than what most give it credit for. Creative, shocking, and filled with more puke than you can shake a stick at, Jackass 3D is able to utilize 3D in ways that haven't been seen before while providing a few laughs and grossing you out all at the same time.",3,Nostalgic and excellent use of 3-D,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,2358,"['Reviewing', 'film', 'Jackass', '3D', 'harder', 'even', 'third', 'installment', 'film', 'franchise', 'came', 'TV', 'series', 'lasted', 'three', 'seasons', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'can', 'recognize', 'franchise', 'name', 'yet', 'people', 'involved', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'actors', 'everyone', 'listed', 'credits', 'coherent', 'story', 'nonexistent', 'Jackass', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'up', 'front', 'bunch', 'guys', 'doing', 'nothing', 'most', 'stupid', 'idiotic', 'things', 'hour', 'half', 'usually', 'involve', 'own', 'genitalia', 'feces', 'either', 'think', 'hilarious', 'downright', 'hate', 'judging', 'packed', 'theater', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'still', 'craving', 'Jackass.Jackass', '3D', '3D', 'effect', 'very', 'well', 'credit', 'can', 'go', 'film', 'actually', 'being', 'shot', 'format', 'rather', 'being', 'shot', 'conventionally', 'converted', '3D', 'later', 'opening', 'closing', 'film', 'are', 'best', '3D', 'examples', 'explosions', 'paintballs', 'dildos', 'God-knows-what', 'flying', 'face', 'As', 'inane', 'was', 'was', 'still', 'nice', 'see', 'effect', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'rather', 'just', 'tacked', 'make', 'extra', '3', 'ticket.The', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'senseless', 'stunts', 'Jackass', 'have', 'always', 'drawn', 'more', 'interest', 'end', 'comparison', 'more', 'crude', 'bits', 'involving', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'Jackass', '3D', 'have', 'honor', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'only', 'film', 'only', 'film', 'presented', '3D', 'bungee', 'outhouse', 'man', 'drinking', 'sweat', 'man', 'things', 'Electric', 'Avenue', 'stun', 'guns', 'attached', 'strings', 'spinning', 'cattle', 'prod', 'Bam', 'version', 'Rocky', 'films', 'Wee', 'Man', 'segment', 'bar', 'other', 'midgets', 'are', 'real', 'high', 'points', 'film.Jackass', '3D', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'intriguing', 'Once', 'start', 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'look', 'away', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'imbecility', 'will', 'go', 'Never', 'phrase', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'slow', 'motion', 'fit', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'certainly', 'far', 'brilliant', 'bit', 'more', 'creativity', 'what', 'most', 'give', 'credit', 'Creative', 'shocking', 'filled', 'more', 'puke', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'Jackass', '3D', 'able', 'utilize', '3D', 'ways', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'providing', 'few', 'laughs', 'grossing', 'same', 'time']",N/A

I was about 15 when it was on.  I laughed and laughed at it.  I also liked the CKY videos that bam and the guys made.  The best part of the show was when they would pull pranks on random people and each other.  In this movie, they may have did that a few times.  But it was not the same.  The part with the random people was funny.  But they all have to know what they will do to each other.  They have done so many things back and forth, nothing is really new.  The parts with Bams parents, how can they not know what is going to happen?  It did make me laugh at parts.  But it seemed like they had extra stuff laying around and they made it into a movie.  Some of the stuff I actually closed my eyes during.  I mean, when guys go to the bathroom all over the place and they all laugh, for some reason didn't do it for me.  Then there was a part with tasers.  It was such a stupid thing.  I mean, what if a few got on them and they got stuck on them for a few seconds?  Seems they would be dead.  I did think it was kind of funny.  I would even rent another movie of theres.  But, since the show I have grown up some what.  Seems the trademark for Jackass has stayed the same though.I wish all the guys well and thank them for everything they have given us.  I guess I would say keep it up.  There are a lot of people who think this is the funniest thing they have seen.  I will say I did laugh at some of it.  I liked though when it was more amature and seemed to have a random, thoughtless sense.

1357588,A1EAAH5UM5P8SB,B003Q6D2AA,"oldpink ""Dark Side of the Moon""","[4, 5]","First, I wanted to say I've seen all the episodes of the old series and both the first and second movies, and now this, so I have a pretty good baseline by which to evaluate this.First, the content list.1) The Blu-Ray, which contains both the theatrical release and the director's cut, with no extras. ***CORRECTION: The Blu-Ray contains multiple deleted scenes and outtakes, some funny and others just so so.2) The regular DVD, which contains the theatrical release only, with no extras.3) A digital copy of the movie, which you unlock using the enclosed code. (you'll need at least version 11 of MS Media Player for this).4) Two sets of 3D glasses, the old style with red and blue lenses.I first viewed the regular DVD, and I was a bit taken aback to see that it only contains the movie in analglyph (old style 3D), with no way to switch over to regular 2D.That means none of the modern 3D effects, folks.We're talking 1950s-era technology here.I then watched the director's cut version on the Blu-Ray, which was only in 2D, as is the theatrical release available on the same disk.Now for the movie itself.Some of the stunts were really amusing, some were only mildly so, and others were either just plain stupid (even by Jackass standards), or too disgusting for even someone of my sort with a cast iron stomach.I'll just do a stunt-by-stunt rundown of my thoughts.1) Opening credits - actually liked this quite a lot, with the enhanced ""Phantom Camera"" slow-mo effects.2) High Five - Very simple, but quite amusing, especially how they did Bam.3) The Jet Ski - Okay, but looked more painful than funny.4) Tee Ball - Steve-O takes the obligatory nut shot from a baseball attached to a swinging arm...more painful than funny.5) The Bungee Boogie - Okay, this was more like it. Not very fancy, but some surprisingly good execution on the stunt, and some good laughs.6) The Rocky - Yes, painful, but the phantom camera showed the facial contortions in all their comedic glory.7) Beehive Tetherball - More like the Jackass we all know and love. Pain mixed with some laughs. Loved Dave's screams of agony.8) Jet Airplane - Really liked the old Maxell commercial tribute at the very beginning. Really funny and even a bit dangerous.9) Roller-skate Buffalo - Yes, pointless and painful, but still pretty funny concept. Really liked Knoxville's antics leading up to the inevitable pummeling from a young bison. Roger Miller would have appreciated how his classic song was used for this.10) Toy Train Eruption - Not much more to say here but YUCK! Anyone remembering Dave's scatological stunts in the first two movies won't be much surprised by this one.11) Midgets in a Bar Fight - More classic Jackass tomfoolery. Weeman pulls this off quite well, with a little help from his friends. Especially liked the ""cops"" and ""paramedics"" showing up.12) Electric Avenue - Great stuff here. Very painful, but definitely more classic Jackass.13) The Field Goal - Preston takes yet another for the team. Very low tech, but just okay humor-wise, and more painful than anything else.14) Super Mighty Glue - Low tech, but more like the old style Jackass stunts. Pretty funny.15) Dildo Gun - Only a guy could find this funny, but even my wife laughed at this one. Great use of the phantom camera on the ""projectile.""16) Buy a Scooter - Saw this one coming a mile away. Obviously a setup, since the window was clearly made of sugar glass.17) Pontius the Barbarian - Good one. Two Emperor scorpions do battle with Pontius's chin, 'nuff said.18) Sweat Suit Cocktail - Yuck! Even *I* had a tough time watching this through the conclusion. This is one of the reasons Steve-O gets the big bucks.19) The Christmas Tree - The Dudesons make an appearance for this. Pretty funny, but more dangerous and painful than anything else.20) Pin the Tail on the Donkey - Okay, had to laugh at this one. Danger Ehren's leg shaking made this particularly funny.21) Rocky 2 - Same comments as for the first installment of this.22) The Blind Side - VERY low tech, and pointless, unless you just like seeing Knoxville getting laid out.23) Bad Dog - Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? Very low tech, very painful, and very pointless.24) Helicockter - Pointless, but somewhat funny. Certainly no highlight.25) Snake River Redemption - Great stuff. Poignant watching the now deceased Ryan Dunn land the jump.26) Apple of my Ass - Pretty pointless. Just more of Preston humiliating himself.27) Duck Hunting - Really liked this one, especially Dunn's cartwheeling.28) Really Bad Grandpa - Pretty funny, but nowhere near as funny as the original ""Bad Grandpa"" in the second movie. The young woman they used in this is quite attractive, even though they used makeup to create the illusion of her being much younger than she actually is.29) The Ram Jam - Not much happening except for a pugnacious ram slamming the daylights out of Ryan carrying a tuba. Still, pretty amusing overall.30) Golf Ball Racquetball - Ouch! Nothing else to say.31) Lamborghini Tooth Pull - Danger Ehren endures some excruciating pain. Pretty funny.32) Penis Peeing Camera - Not very funny, just disgusting. The only thing moderately funny is when you realize what that object is to the immediate left of the camera's field of view.33) Gorilla in the Hotel Room - Just not buying that April and Phil didn't know right away that this was Chris in a suit instead of a real ape.34) The Invisible Man - Pretty funny, especially watching Knoxville blend into the background that matches his suit.35) Snake Trap - Bam just gets angry, and that's about it. Nowhere near as funny as the King cobra stunt in the second movie.36) Penis Baseball - What else did anyone expect Pontius to do but go completely naked once again?37) Will the Farter - Laughed really hard at this. Crude, yes, but REALLY funny.38) Poo Cocktail Supreme - Just too disgusting, period.Having watched all three movies, I can say without qualification that the second movie is by far the funniest, even if it has what I consider the most disgusting bits of all, Dave and Bam eating horse apples and the bit with Chris and the stallion.The first movie comes in second, with the movie being reviewed here coming in a distant third.Also, unlike with the first two movies, you get no commentary track, which I often find this nearly as funny as the regular movie audio.You do get a few deleted scenes/outtakes, and some of those are pretty funny, while others were little more than filler.I should also warn those of you with young kids that there are at least two bits with complete nudity and (less important) some very foul language.",3,"Funny, but uneven",1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,6607,"['First', 'wanted', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'old', 'series', 'first', 'second',

My cousins and their friends tempted me, so I sat down and watched it with them... and within seconds I was on the floor, crying from laughing so hard. I was instantly a fan, and days after, I rented the first Jackass and laughed just as hard.Today I went and saw the third strike at the theaters, and in Real D 3D. Of course I got hassled for my ID, 3 times actually, as it's R here in Canada meaning admittance restricted to people 18 and over. Apparently they had a real sneaking problem!!That said, I had a total blast with this movie. If you just switch your brain off at the door, you'll laugh to the point where you're croaking!!!! There is not a single unfunny moment in the movie.The stunts are outrageous, grosser than ever, and out there as hell. All stops imaginable are pulled out. Of course if you are faint hearted or squeamish you will want to avoid this film at all costs as it contains some truly disgusting stuff!!! Without a doubt the funniest stunt is ""Electric Avenue"", a stunt done in the style of a jailbreak, where the crew try to get through a hallway with beams in the middle, tires on the ground, and dangerously high-volt tasers dangling from the ceiling!!! Of course, as stated above it is absolutely NOT for kiddies under 18 or the faint of heart. This got its R here in Alberta for a good reason. The ""Sweatsuit cocktail"" scene alone pretty much solidifies that right there.The 3D is great!!!! Before the movie is a nice little short from Beavis and Butthead explaining the 3D technology, which is truly hilarious. The 3D just ADDS to the ridiculousness, not only is it more lifelike, but there are a few startling ""pop out"" moments too and it's just hilarious!!!! They take full advantage of the 3D and therefore it's totally worth it.In short, It did kinda make me sad that this may be the last Jackass. Hopefully it isn't, because they may be getting old but they certainly aren't declining in quality.

1357594,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003Q6D2AA,RMurray847,"[2, 7]","How can one even really attempt to review a ""movie"" like JACKASS 3D?  It's not a work of fiction and it isn't really a documentary.  It's not a sketch anthology, because some of the stuff is sorta real.  Frankly, it simply can't be reviewed on its merits as a movie.So I'm left with trying to review its entertainment value (which is a big thing...being well entertained will excuse a lot in my book)...and this isn't easy either.  Some of JACKASS 3D is extremely funny.  And some of it is SO offensive.  Some level of offensiveness is okay in my book, but this film crossed a few too many lines for me.  I realize for others that line is further out...and that's okay.  I can only comment on my own responses.In case you don't know, the JACKASS phenomenon basically involves a group of men who've figured out how to do the most horrific things to themselves in order to make money.  Whether inflicting severe pain on themselves (that seems to be Johnny Knoxville's specialty) to allowing the most disgusting things to happen to them (Steve O. thrives here), JACKASS appeals purely to the most base level of our sense of humor.  I suspect that these films also appeal far more broadly to men than women...but that's pure speculation on my part.  However, I have yet to speak to a woman who actually has much good to say about these films and the TV show.  It's not that the films are misogynistic...they hardly feature women at all.  It's just that they appeal to very boyish part of men that still laughs at poop jokes and people being injured in the groin.  For me, the best analogy for the experience is to imagine AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS totally and completely uncensored and rather than simply hosted by Tom Bergeron or Bob Saget, but the stunts are actually executed by and inflicted on the hosts.The movie is a series of stunts that fall into 3 basic categories.  First are the pain sequences, involving things such as allowing a bull to ram Knoxville or a dog to chew into his rear end.  These are, for me, the funniest scenes.  I guess I'm over the poop jokes but not so much over laughing at the old knee to the groin stuff.  Best of all are the earliest scenes, involving a giant hand that unexpectedly ""high fives"" various members of the team, knocking them to the ground.  It nicely mixes the joy of pain inflicted on others with the element of surprise.  Another ""highlight"" is when several team members must navigate a narrow path that is covered in active tazers.  The pain inflicted is pretty significant, but the fascination level is also pretty high.Second, we have the gross-out scenes, and many of these are nearly unbearable to watch.  Many literally involve poop, but other bodily fluids are involved at times.  The stunt with the sweatsuit made of Saran wrap (I can't bring myself to describe it) was so thoroughly revolting that I literally could not watch it all.  Other stunts involve porta-potties, and if you can imagine the scene early in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE involving a public toilet, but real...you have the beginnings of an idea as to what is involved.  I could die a happy man never having to see anything like these scenes again.Third, there were the ""candid camera"" scenes.  These were stunts set up to fool members of the public.  There was one extended bit involving several little people getting into a bar fight that was actually kind of clever.  The rest of these bits were vaguely disturbing and TRULY unfunny.  Hardly a chuckle from the audience and even the filmmakers seemed somehow disinterested.  And these kinds of scenes really didn't fit into the spirit of the rest of the movie...which is somehow about the strange, twisted, sick but oddly supportive camaraderie between the core members of this team.I cannot recommend JACKASS 3D (by the way, I found the addition of the 3D to be nearly worthless, even though it WAS of very good quality).  No one in their right mind should recommend a JACKASS movie to someone else.  It really would simply take a leap of faith to see this if you've never endured one before.  You might be entertained but you might be horrified more thoroughly than any work of fiction could ever hope to achieve.  If you've seen and enjoyed these films before, then you've probably seen it already.  I saw it over three weeks ago and just now was able to approach it with some semblance of rationality.Ultimately, I did laugh at big chunks of the film, so I'm going to give it a modest rating.

After awhile someone getting kicked or punched between the legs gets old. Apparently nowadays the target audience for a movie about forty-somethings torturing themselves, is 12 year olds.But I still enjoyed some of the stunts like playing tetherball with a hornets nest---running a gauntlet of cattle prods and stun guns and a bar brawl by Wee Man and his little people friends and the fight is broken up by midget police who handcuff and arrest the brawlers.  In some perverse way the scene of Johnny Knoxville made up and playing an overly affectionate grandpa to his sweet young grand-daughter(19) to the outrage of an innocent patsy, was funny.But my favorite bit from the movie is Steve-O locked inside a port-a-pottie loaded with buckets of fesces and the port-a-pottie is attached by bungee cord to two cranes. The cranes then lift and shake the toilet serving Steve-O a poop cocktail. Gross.  Sick.

The intro before the film officially starts is a treat as to what you are in for.Without giving away anything, there are some major gross-out gags. I have a strong stomach but I had to look away a few times. I can talk about blood, guts, dung, ect.. while I am eating and it does not bother me. This is the first time I can remember in a long time where I had to look away from the screen. Do not let this deter you because you remember the ""Fart Mask"" from part 2 that involved stool and puking, and you stilled laughed. Jackass 3D pushes that grossout factor to 10 in a few bits.There are many cool stunts, gags, and pranks galore. Bottom Line, go to an early show so you can sit far back and watch a kick-ass, hilariously funny, outrageous treat. The 3D exceeded my expectations also.If you are a non-Jackass fan, have a stick up your arse, and are overly mature or a member of your church... you will HATE this movie!

But for what it's trying to do it's the best in the business (can I really call this a business???).Watching with a friend, I felt embarrassed just for renting Jackass 3 as each segment rolled...like I was condoning the behavior and/or the unspeakable acts. Rest assured I do not...or do I?Is it effective entertainment? Is it affective entertainment? Oh, yes and yes. During the show there were plenty of audible gasps from my friend and me. We laughed a lot. Many times we smacked our hands to our head simultaneously in disbelief as we realized what was about to happen. But we never turned it off. We anxiously awaited the next skit; we just had to see what these guys would do next. We wanted to keep watching....That's effective entertainment. The mentally exhausted feeling after the movie was over?....That's affective entertainment.I was compelled to keep watching. So do I condone it? Just because I watched it, does that mean I condone it? No. The idiots that condone it go out and try doing this stuff after seeing it.Jackass 3 is not for anyone that is easily offended; your sense of humor really needs to have a warped section. But in this day and age where some crazy stuff can be seen on the Internet on any given day, why not just sit back with Jackass 3 in your DVD player instead of searching The Web?Bottom line: It was...a memorable rental. Oh, and one of the most disgustingly memorable scenes that is disgustingly burned onto my brain that I can't but wish I could wash away?...Let's just say that they should have called Jackass 3Jackass Number Two.",3,And My Wife Calls Me a Jackass?!?!!!!,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,1655,"['hilarious', 'amazing', 'shocking', 'offensive', 'disgusting', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'business', 'can', 'really', 'call', 'business', '.Watching', 'friend', 'felt', 'embarrassed', 'just', 'renting', 'Jackass', '3', 'segment', 'rolled', 'was', 'condoning', 'behavior', 'unspeakable', 'acts', 'Rest', 'assured', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'effective', 'entertainment', 'affective', 'entertainment', 'Oh', 'yes', 'yes', 'show', 'were', 'plenty', 'audible', 'gasps', 'friend', 'laughed', 'lot', 'Many', 'times', 'smacked', 'hands', 'head', 'simultaneously', 'disbelief', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'never', 'turned', 'off', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'next', 'skit', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'guys', 'would', 'do', 'next', 'wanted', 'keep', 'watching', '.That', 'effective', 'entertainment', 'mentally', 'exhausted', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', '.That', 'affective', 'entertainment.I', 'was', 'compelled', 'keep', 'watching', 'So', 'do', 'condone', 'Just', 'watched', 'mean', 'condone', 'No', 'idiots', 'condone', 'go', 'out', 'try', 'doing', 'stuff', 'seeing', 'it.Jackass', '3', 'not', 'anyone', 'easily', 'offended', 'sense', 'humor', 'really', 'have', 'warped', 'section', 'day', 'age', 'where', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Internet', 'given', 'day', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'Jackass', '3', 'DVD', 'player', 'instead', 'searching', 'Web', 'Bottom', 'line', 'was', 'memorable', 'rental', 'Oh', 'one', 'most', 'disgustingly', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'disgustingly', 'burned', 'brain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wish', 'could', 'wash', 'away', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'Jackass', '3Jackass', 'Number', 'Two']",N/A
