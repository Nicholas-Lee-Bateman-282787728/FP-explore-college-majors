247797,A1DTCJV6KOMJOA,6301232291,A*,"[6, 6]","There is a certain magic in a Preston Sturges film that only few directors have. He had the knack to delve into every aspect of his films, from the casting to the costumes and when it came down to him directing Sturges knew how to paint a picture full of stark beauty and constant character driven moments! The story is simple film director John Sulllivan (McCrea) wants to make a film about human suffering so he confronts the studio heads about doing so. The sequence is so damn funny and honest you might wet yourself. They comply but when he wants to experince this sort of pain well they turn it into a big media machine that follows his path on a road of hunger and homelessness. On this road he meets &quot;The Girl&quot; (Veronica Lake)she is just as down on her career as he is on his self imposed &quot;luck&quot;. The mayhem that ensues is both funny, dark and mostly true to life. Preston Sturges gives the film a &quot;Hollywood&quot; vision of hard luck. It never veers beyond the main characters and we never get a deep conversation between a faux drifter and a real one. But the film more than holds its own as a satire of a film inside of a film. When Sullivan is belived to be dead and must survive as a convicted homeless man he learns more about the human condition than he thought possible. The scenes of McCrea and Lake walking by a moonlit  river that seems to sparkle like a thousand candles floating in the sea is just a gem to watch. The magic of this flick doesn't slow down for a second. It's a satire of a film about a man who wants pretend to be a new man, who meets a woman who wants to be a better woman, who just wants the man who is the man for her to love her no matter what kind of lifestyle he lives-now this is Hollywood, in its golden age!",5,EVERY FILM LOVER MUST OWN THIS FLICK!,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,1778,"['certain', 'magic', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'directors', 'have', 'had', 'knack', 'delve', 'aspect', 'films', 'casting', 'costumes', 'when', 'came', 'down', 'directing', 'Sturges', 'knew', 'how', 'paint', 'picture', 'full', 'stark', 'beauty', 'constant', 'character', 'driven', 'moments', 'story', 'simple', 'film', 'director', 'John', 'Sulllivan', 'McCrea', 'make', 'film', 'human', 'suffering', 'so', 'studio', 'heads', 'doing', 'so', 'sequence', 'so', 'damn', 'funny', 'honest', 'might', 'wet', 'comply', 'when', 'experince', 'sort', 'pain', 'turn', 'big', 'media', 'machine', 'path', 'road', 'hunger', 'homelessness', 'road', 'quot', 'Girl', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'just', 'as', 'down', 'career', 'self', 'imposed', 'quot', 'quot', 'mayhem', 'funny', 'dark', 'mostly', 'true', 'life', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'film', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'vision', 'hard', 'luck', 'never', 'main', 'characters', 'never', 'get', 'deep', 'conversation', 'faux', 'drifter', 'real', 'one', 'film', 'more', 'own', 'satire', 'film', 'film', 'When', 'Sullivan', 'belived', 'be', 'dead', 'must', 'survive', 'convicted', 'homeless', 'man', 'more', 'human', 'condition', 'thought', 'possible', 'scenes', 'McCrea', 'Lake', 'walking', 'moonlit', 'river', 'sparkle', 'thousand', 'floating', 'sea', 'just', 'gem', 'watch', 'magic', 'flick', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'second', 'satire', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'pretend', 'be', 'new', 'man', 'who', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'better', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'man', 'who', 'man', 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'lifestyle', 'lives-now', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age']",N/A

SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is his masterpiece, hitting all its marks with uncanny oddball perfection.  The storyline of a bigtime Hollywood director desiring to make a social commentary with his next serious project, &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot;, is at times outrageously funny and repeatedly absurd.  But the strange thing is how throughout the film there are so many poignant moments, done with utmost affection and delight, that its impossible to call this just a comedy.  It's a film full of heart, lovable in its natural lunacy, utterly delightful and endlessly entertaining to watch, galloping ahead with rapid-fire screwball dialogue.&quot;This picture is an answer to communists. It shows we're awake and not dunking our heads in the sand like a bunch of ostriches.  I want this picture to be a commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, the problems that confront the average man.  I want to hold a mirror up to life.

Sullivan's Travels is both a movie about poverty and a movie about making movies about poverty.  The more comedic opening of the film points out the fact that however well meaning liberal directors may be in trying to make a film about suffering, there is an exploitative element to such films especially since the directors have no means of truly identifying with the sufferers or knowing their wishes.  For example, do such films truly help the sufferers or just the movie studio?As a sort of apology, the movie begins with the well meaning director setting out to experience what it is like to be impoverished after having it pointed out to him by his producers that he never has experienced hardship himself.  In a quite hilarious manner, his first several attempts to experience poverty are all abortive because he cannot escape from the fact that even with just one dime in his pocket, he has a fortune in the bank, a fancy car and servants.  Eventually he gets to experience some of the surface suffering the impoverished go through with the help of Veronica Lake, then, quite unintentionally, after believing he understands the experience of poverty and is ready to make his film, winds up trapped in an even worse situation.Of course, he gets out of his last predicament thanks to his true social standing, but as a result realizes that he can never experience anything but the surface of what it is like to be impoverished and comes to recognize the hubris involved in trying to portray suffering he can never understand in film.  He also comes to realize how the privileged like himself, and not the impoverished, are the true outsiders from society.  In another self-referential twist, the director decides to make comedies for the public, which is what &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; is for the most part, instead of a preachy film for others like himself can congratulate themselves for watching.In conclusion, &quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot; is both an entertaining and an enlightening film which is still very relevant to today and is very highly recommended.",5,Wonderful,1029801600,"08 20, 2002",2002,2162,"['One', 'most', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'movie', 'clever', 'use', 'self-reference', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', 'movie', 'poverty', 'movie', 'making', 'movies', 'poverty', 'more', 'comedic', 'opening', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'fact', 'however', 'well', 'meaning', 'liberal', 'directors', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'suffering', 'exploitative', 'element', 'such', 'films', 'especially', 'directors', 'have', 'means', 'truly', 'identifying', 'sufferers', 'knowing', 'wishes', 'example', 'do', 'such', 'films', 'truly', 'help', 'sufferers', 'just', 'movie', 'studio', 'sort', 'apology', 'movie', 'well', 'meaning', 'director', 'setting', 'out', 'experience', 'what', 'be', 'impoverished', 'having', 'pointed', 'out', 'producers', 'never', 'experienced', 'hardship', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'manner', 'first', 'several', 'attempts', 'experience', 'poverty', 'are', 'abortive', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'fact', 'even', 'just', 'one', 'dime', 'pocket', 'fortune', 'bank', 'fancy', 'car', 'servants', 'Eventually', 'experience', 'surface', 'suffering', 'impoverished', 'go', 'help', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'then', 'quite', 'unintentionally', 'believing', 'experience', 'poverty', 'ready', 'make', 'film', 'up', 'trapped', 'even', 'worse', 'situation.Of', 'course', 'last', 'predicament', 'thanks', 'true', 'social', 'standing', 'result', 'can', 'never', 'experience', 'anything', 'surface', 'what', 'be', 'impoverished', 'recognize', 'hubris', 'involved', 'trying', 'portray', 'suffering', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'film', 'also', 'realize', 'how', 'privileged', 'not', 'impoverished', 'are', 'true', 'outsiders', 'society', 'self-referential', 'twist', 'director', 'make', 'comedies', 'public', 'what', 'quot', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', 'quot', 'most', 'part', 'instead', 'preachy', 'film', 'others', 'can', 'congratulate', 'watching.In', 'conclusion', 'quot', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', 'quot', 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'relevant', 'today', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
247806,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6301232291,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 2]","There was a period during the 1940's when everything Preston Sturges touched was wildly successful with both critics and the public. His films were comedies, and in Sullivan's Travels he found a way to show the importance of laughter in the lives of Americans by showing a director's journey as he sets out to do something more important than making people laugh.Joel McCrea portrays a very successful Hollywood director who has become rich and famous for making lowbrow comedies. Despite his tremendous success, however, he is disgruntled and wants to do a serious social film in the Frank Capra vein. It is an idea met with much incredulity and resistance because, as pointed out to him, he knows nothing about the common man. To experience what it is like to be without, he leaves Hollywood behind and sets out to live as a hobo.The studio makes this task nearly impossible by sending an entourage to follow him. On his second attempt to elude them and strike out on his own he meets the wonderful Veronica Lake. She is an extra in the movies who never got a break, but gives Sullivan one by buying him a meal of ham and eggs. He discovers she loves one of his comedies and when they are briefly detained by the police for borrowing his own car she discovers who he really is and what he is trying to do.Most famous today for her hairdo and films opposite Alan Ladd, she is simply fabulous here, and has never been lovelier or more engaging. A real affection develops between the couple as they have a riotous time hopping a freight. Her attempts to hide her glamour under a French cap and boys clothes only makes her more alluring. The pair finally get their chance to live like tramps, but Sullivan discovers it's not all it's cracked up to be.Sullivan wants to give back in a monetary way, but a nearly tragic turn of events ensues when he ends up on a chain gang while everyone believes he is dead. Sturges shows the futility of greed as Sullivan is robbed but his attacker is run over by a train while trying to gather his windfall. The director's flair for comedy is in abundance also, even poking fun at himself by making Lake's character a big Lubitch fan!The wondrous Lake falls in love with the idealistic Sullivan and it takes a Mickey Mouse cartoon to make him realize just how important the laughter he provides is to people with little to laugh about. McCrea gives a terrific performance matched in every frame of celluloid by Veronica Lake. While not as outright funny as his other films of note, Sullivan's Travels has more relevance.

Sullivan, a Hollywood director who has made a number of lightweight comedies and now wants to make a picture about the poor and downtrodden, brimming with social significance. But only knowing the rosy side of life, he decides to deck himself out as a bum and hit the hobo trail for some first-hand experience with life on the other side of the tracks. He meets Veronica Lake on the road, and they explore the poverty of railroad yards and flop houses together. But he always has the safety net of his rich past, which is in the form of a luxury van that follows in his tracks and contains his butler and valet, to fall back on when things get too rough.After he's had enough of this ""experiment,"" he goes down to skid row handing out $5 bills and gets himself clunked on the head and dumped on a freight train heading east. He's reported as being dead, but is actually working on a chain gang; to get out of this mess he confesses to his own murder to get his picture in the papers where he's finally recognized back in Hollywood. What does he learn from all of this? That people just want to laugh.The early scenes and the first ones with Lake (who was six months pregnant when shooting started, which caused problems with costuming to hide the fact) are the best. Lake is quite funny and energetic, and she and McRae make a good pair. Some of the scenes are pretty contrived, the worst example of this being the one where the chain gang convicts go to a black rural church and watch a Mickey Mouse cartoon laughing their heads off. But it's a good social satire and one of Sturges's best movies.

Sturges explicated himself this way:""`Sullivan's Travels' is the result of an urge, an urge to tell some of my fellow filmwrights that they were getting a little too deep-dish and to leave the preaching to the preachers.""Appropriate to name names, or name? Sturges did, in dialogue. Frank Capra. ""Sullivan's Travels"" followed (&amp; was derived from) ""It Happened One Night"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""You Can't Take It with You"", ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". Capra's ""Meet John Doe"" was 1941, perhaps concurrently produced, though ""Sullivan's Travels"" was Sturges 1941 #2, extensively rewritten on the fly (for Veronica Lake pregnancy workaround). Neither Capra nor Sturges outlasted the 40s as makers. The last great Capra movie, ""State of the Union"" (1948, Tracy/Hepburn) is a retreat into the self-protective refusal to risk position Sturges recommends? The last great Sturges film, ""Unfaithfully Yours"" (1948, a disastrous box-office bomb), is grand glossy entertainment. The post-war American audience was exhausted/indifferent, didn't need or wish to be engaged as EITHER Capra or Sturges hoped. Capra, a Dickensian (art is NOT life) romantic/radical, was doomed by forces beyond his understanding, incurious audience, HUAC-related paranoia. The failure of Sturges seems less inevitable, more self-scripted. What would destroy Sturges was an easy/natural extension of the argument he had elected to present/preach in 1941, irony eating its own tail?""Sullivan's Travels"" lapses immediately in opening note written to the screen, then in sermon by snooty/smart butler, again as what might have been as one of the grandest movie scenes of the 40s is undercut by cheap/false/brazen ref to Disney plus what amounts to a sitcom laughtrack, finally by Sullivan reiterating the sermon in defense of disconnected ditziness in closing, just in case anyone missed it. Sturges kills his horse right away, in writing, bludgeons the carcass in passing, pounds it liberally in the end. Why? Does Sturges want respect, fear that there ain't room in Hollywood, or Dodge, for both Capra &amp; Sturges?  Had Capra said something needlessly nasty about pure slapstick, empty satire? Does Sturges BELIEVE his own explication/excuse, really? Should the failure of Sturges be understood in exactly the terms proposed in ""Sullivan's Travels""?The greatest Disney animations (Snow White/Fantasia/Pinocchio) were done before 1941. The long/ongoing artistic decline (commercial rise) of Disney into the conglomerate it has become had already begun. Sturges can be forgiven for insufficient prescience, but what goes around comes around? Sturges himself was constitutionally incapable of the level of pandering escapism Disney would gradually perfect (as animation &amp;/OR flawless saccharine yeller dog story).A good movie in spite of itself, or in spite of how Sturges sticks to critical outline, or agenda/schtick, regardless of how his art tugs at him (or us). Many grand scenes, especially the McRea/Lake diner meeting &amp; the corrupted-by-fake/exaggerated-laughtrack chaingang visit to a black church at the heart of the matter.

His core characters were usually quirky, eccentric, or just downright crazy. Sturges' rep as a writer and director have withstood the test of time and is one of the reasons I'm writing this review. This is a great set.The plot: movie director John Sullivan tires of making comedies. He well-meaningly wants to explore the country in search of the common man and direct his film making efforts to the production of socially meaningful films ala THE GRAPES OF WRATH. After an aborted attempt to take off trailed by flunkies from his studio who try to protect their hot property (Sullivan), he shakes the studio folk and hooks up with a wannabe actress/hash slinger Veronica Lake as a couple of hoboes hot on the trail of the common man. Tiny and street smart Veronica thinks hunky and clueless Sully (played with all the sincerity he could muster by Joel McCrea)needs protecting.  Sturges takes his viewer through Sullivan's adventures (hence his 'Travels') and Sully's honest discovery of what type of films the people really want.I bought this set because I wanted the copy of the American Experience documentary about Sturges' life and career. The newer and greatly cleaned up copy was an exciting bonus. This is definitely one of the better Criterion Collection offerings. The doc is on par with most American Experience offerings as it is thoroughly researched and constructed. The copy of Sullivan's Travels is digitally cleaned up. There is true definition to the image on the screen.  No fuzziness or running or spotting.

A movie of this kind was seldom in the 1940s and still may be today. Many of these themes were well expressed in comedic fashion.Sullivan embarks on a journey, pretending to live in poverty. Outrageous idea, but Sullivan somehow survives and realizes the many horrible things in the world. After a few days living in poverty, Sullivan decides to hand out money to the poor. However, Sullivan soon learns that simply giving out money can have reprucussions. One poor man even follows Sullivan and steals his money. The poor man doesn't care about the money; he just wants to hurt Sullivan's high status. Social commentary like this is what makes this movie gold.

The film is a quirky odyssey of a misguided movie director who wants to experience poverty so he can make the great American movie.

It's only when poverty is foisted on him with disastrous results that Sullivan sees the downfall of method directing.

Bannister,"[3, 3]",This is a wonderful movie about a successful comedy director setting out to find trouble in order to film his next project a serious movie about the Depression called Oh Brother Where Art Thou. Early in the film the studio owners try to disuade Sullivan from the movie and suggest making it into a musical; a suggestion which the Coen brothers took over 50 years later.Initially Sullivan cannot escape his entourage which comes to include the beautiful and witty Veronica Lake. Later however life becomes more vivid for the restless director and his lesson is learned.The film is divided into two distinct parts as many people have commented on. While some have said this makes the movie uneven I think that it moves the movie well beyond a simple romantic comedy giving it a complexity and color you don't expect.The movie is brilliantly written by Preston Sturges. Watch it once for the sheer joy of it but watch it again to experience a brilliance of dialogue that few have been able to accomplish since.Being a Criterion production the presentation is excellent and it has many extras that we have come to expect and appreciate from this company.,5,The Original Oh Brother Where Art Thou,1015545600,"03 8, 2002",2002,1150,"['wonderful', 'movie', 'successful', 'comedy', 'director', 'setting', 'out', 'find', 'trouble', 'order', 'film', 'next', 'project', 'serious', 'movie', 'Depression', 'called', 'Oh', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Early', 'film', 'studio', 'owners', 'try', 'disuade', 'Sullivan', 'movie', 'suggest', 'making', 'musical', 'suggestion', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'took', 'over', '50', 'years', 'later.Initially', 'Sullivan', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'entourage', 'include', 'beautiful', 'witty', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'Later', 'however', 'life', 'more', 'vivid', 'restless', 'director', 'lesson', 'learned.The', 'film', 'divided', 'two', 'distinct', 'parts', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'uneven', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'simple', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'giving', 'complexity', 'color', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect.The', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'Watch', 'once', 'sheer', 'joy', 'watch', 'again', 'experience', 'brilliance', 'dialogue', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'accomplish', 'since.Being', 'Criterion', 'production', 'presentation', 'excellent', 'many', 'extras', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'appreciate', 'company']",N/A
247821,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6301232291,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 1941, producer/writer/director Preston Sturges (""The Lady Eve"", ""Unfaithfully Yours"", ""The Great McGinty"")  created his masterpiece ""Sullivan's Travels"" starring actor Joel McCrea (""Foreign Correspondent"", ""Buffalo Bill"", ""The Virginian"") and actress Veronica Lake (""I Married a Witch"", ""This Gun for Hire"", ""Hold That Blonde"").The film was selected for preservation by the US National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1990 as being ""Culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and in 2007, was ranked #61 in the American Film Institute's ""Greatest Movie of All Time"".The film revolves around director John L. Sullivan (played by Joel McCrea).  After having his share of profitable films, which were comedies that were not showcasing him as a serious director, Sullivan decided that he wanted to change things up and direct a film titled ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"".  Of course, the studio head Mr. Lebrand (played by Robert Warwick) wants him to focus on comedy but Sullivan will not do it.Sullivan comes up with an idea.  Why not learn first-hand on how to be a homeless person (know in the 1940's as the word ""tramp"") by actually becoming one in order to gain the research he needs for his serious film that would depict the sorrow of humanity.Of course, the studio is not so thrilled about their profitable director getting into that kind of trouble, so they have an entourage following Sullivan who is dressed as a tramp hitchhiking.  The problem is that the entourage are just a bit too close and nearby.  So, Sullivan tells them that he needs his space and distance from them to make this research possible and will meet them in Las Vegas.Sullivan eventually breaks free and starts working as a helping hand for a woman who tries to keep him locked up in the house but Sullivan manages to escape and hitchhikes his way out of the area and is given a ride by a truck driver.  When he wakes up, he finds out that he is taken back to Hollywood.  Upset and hungry, he goes into a diner but with not much money, a failed actress (played by Veronica Lake) buys him breakfast.Sullivan learns that the girl has only been taking extra work and has not done so well in Hollywood.  So, he wants to help her.  He pretends that he knows a successful director named Sullivan and borrows his car and tells her that he can stay at the director's home for several weeks and he'll fly her back home.  But when the two are busted by police, Sullivan is forced to reveal that he is not homeless or a washed up director, he is actually a successful director dressing up as a tramp in order to do research for his upcoming film.Upset by Sulllivan lying to her, she tells him that if he is going to disguise himself as a homeless person to research this role, she is going to join him.  And thus begins, Sullivan's travels along with the girl to learn how it is to be homeless in America during these harsh times.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Sullivan's Travels - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #118' is featured in black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks very good on DVD, I didn't notice any blemishes, major dust or compression problems.  According to Criterion, the new digital transfer was created from a 35m duplicate negative. Blacks are nice and deep with mild flickering.  Most of the dust and scratches show during the projector reel of the Disney animated film but a very good transfer from Criterion.Of course, this is a 2001 DVD release, so I can imagine that if this film is released on Blu-ray, hopefully in the near future, we will see the definitive version of the film.  Also, there is a 2006 DVD release from Universal Pictures included in the Preston Sturges DVD box set which I have not had the opportunity to watch and compare with this Criterion release.As for audio, the film is presented in monaural.  According to Criterion, the HD transfer was created from an optical soundtrack.  But pretty much, ""Sullivan's Travel"" features very good picture quality and audio on this Criterion Collection DVD, especially since it is a film that is  70-years-old.Subtitles are in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Sullivan's Travels - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #118' comes with the following special features:* Audio commentary by filmmakers Noah Baumbach, Kenneth Bowser and actors Christopher Guest and Michael McKean - An enjoyable commentary by the four who discuss the film.

A very well-done documentary on Preston Sturges from his earlier family life to being blackballed by the industry and losing the business he started and losing a lot of his money.* Interview with Preston Sturges' widow Sandy Sturges - (13:37) An interview with Sandy Sturges in 2001.  Who also reveals of why things may have gone sour between Howard Hughes and Preston Sturges.* Hedda Hopper radio interview with Preston Sturges - A four minute radio interview from 1951 for Heda Hopper's Hollywood.

Viewers can navigate through the materials via remote.* Original theatrical trailer - (1:49) The original theatrical trailer without any remastering.I have to admit that when I first watched ""Sullivan's Travels"", I was a bit surprised.  I was expecting a screwball comedy and at first, the film was very comedy-driven until you get to the final half hour and see how serious the film gets and then it transitions back to a comedy film once again.But there are scenes that made me happy to see.  First, the chemistry between Joeal McCrea and Veronica Lake was just magnificent.  To see how Sturges avoided any problems by the censors but yet still making sure he was compliant with the Hays code was quite interesting.  Where depiction of a couple sleeping together was typically not possible (thus the two beds were separated during the Golden Era) but then sidestepping the code by having the two sleep together in other scenes without the use of a bedroom. But to watch these two together on screen and have so much fun made this film quite enjoyable.  Veronica Lake looks absolutely stunning in this film.Another scene that I absolute enjoyed was how it depicted the Southern church and its Black parishioners.  With Blacks typically shown stereotypically in roles that made fun of their characters, we see both black and white people watching a film together and both races are enjoying the film together.  In fact, the NAACP secretary Walter White even wrote a letter to Sturges congratulating him in creating a film and showcasing Blacks decent treatment.  I was definitely a moving scene.Although the film received rave reviews, within the 70+ years after the film's release in theaters, many critics are discovering how important and significant this film is and also how this film ranks up there among Sturges's other popular filmsIt's one thing to give the film credit but I also give credit to the Criterion Collection for including the documentary ""The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer"" which received an HD transfer for this DVD release.  I had no idea how much turmoil Sturges had to face after the 1940's.  For a man who's films are so highly regarded, it's a shame that the early Hollywood system really turned their backs on him and literally blackballed him from ever writing, directing or producing another film during the 1950's.  Kenneth Bowser does a remarkable job in featuring the career of Preston Sturges and interviews with those close to him.Also included on the Criterion Collection DVD of ""Sullivan's Travels"" is an interview which Sandy Sturges reveals why Howard Hughes may have fired Preston during their brief time together and also other material which have not been seen or heard by the public until the release of this DVD.Overall, ""Sullivan's Travels"" is an American classic and Preston Sturges at his best.  But the Criterion Collection DVD release of ""Sullivan's Travels"" also celebrates the life of this filmmaker but also showing us that even for great successes, when their luck has ran out, things don't work out as great as you once have hoped. Preston Sturges fans will definitely enjoy this DVD release.  Highly recommended!",5,"A true Preston Sturges masterpiece.

It was a blind buy, and I'd never seen a Preston Sturges film prior to watching it either. I immediately wanted to watch it again after the first viewing. The film never drags and somehow makes a lighthearted screwball comedy with several slapstick bits turn into an engaging drama. And just as quickly, we're away from the dramatic and being exposed to a heartwarming ending -- one that, as a screenwriter myself [who's never made a sale, to be perfectly clear], struck very near & dear to me.I can think of very few writers who wrote such perfect dialogue;  and I've immediately placed this in my top 20 favorite films of all time. A shame it wasn't included in AFI's Top 100 American Films. As far as the masters of dialogue, Sturges belongs up there with Paddy Chayefsky, Orson Welles, Aaron Sorkin & Billy Wilder. Sturges may not have had the mastery with the camera that Welles had, but his dialogue made it possible for him to pull off those 5 and 6 minute scenes that didn't cut away for even a split second. It also means he was probably a darn good actors' director.As far as the acting, I can't say I'd seen Veronica Lake in a film before, but she was absolutely stunning (the pool scene, anyone?) and delivered her lines with perfection. I'd never heard of Joel McCrea either, but he turned in nothing short of a brilliant performance and one that required him to be quite versatile as he ran the gamut of emotions throughout the film. The supporting cast was plentiful for a film of this era and also quite exceptional. It seems like Sturges would often create a character for the purpose of having them deliver an excellent bit of dialogue that he just happened to come up with (and that wouldn't be fitting coming from one his lead characters). But it works. Everything he attempted here worked. Even the montage with Sullivan and ""the girl"" interacting with the homeless, which lasts much longer than a montage you'd seen in any modern film, is seamless. And the restoration effort here only magnifies that.Not only did the feature wildly impress me, the bonus content here is among my favorite of any Criterion. The audio commentary that includes Guest & McKean is a highly entertaining ""fan"" commentary (I personally can't get enough of their films either) interspersed with factual/historical commentary by Baumbach & Bowser. The addition of the 76-minute PBS documentary on Sturges as well as the audio outtakes, trailer, stills, storyboards, and publicity materials makes this one of the most complete releases Criterion has ever rendered for a film on a single disc.Needless to say, this DVD triggered an immediate purchase of ""The Lady Eve"", which is worthy of a whole different post (that belongs in that film's respective thread) and has left me wanting to see ""The Palm Beach Story"" and ""The Great McGinty"" as soon as possible. Too bad we don't have Criterions of those to enjoy!",5,An unsung hero of America cinema; a film to adore...,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,3031,"[""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Criterions', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'blind', 'buy', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'film', 'prior', 'watching', 'immediately', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'first', 'viewing', 'film', 'never', 'drags', 'somehow', 'lighthearted', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'several', 'slapstick', 'bits', 'turn', 'engaging', 'drama', 'just', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'away', 'dramatic', 'being', 'exposed', 'heartwarming', 'ending', 'one', 'screenwriter', '[', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'sale', 'be', 'perfectly', 'clear', ']', 'struck', 'very', 'dear', 'me.I', 'can', 'think', 'very', 'few', 'writers', 'who', 'wrote', 'such', 'perfect', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'immediately', 'placed', 'top', '20', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'AFI', 'Top', '100', 'American', 'Films', 'As', 'far', 'masters', 'dialogue', 'Sturges', 'there', 'Paddy', 'Chayefsky', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'Sturges', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'mastery', 'camera', 'Welles', 'had', 'dialogue', 'made', 'possible', 'pull', 'off', '5', '6', 'minute', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'away', 'even', 'split', 'second', 'also', 'was', 'probably', 'darn', 'good', 'actors', 'director.As', 'far', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'pool', 'scene', 'anyone', 'delivered', 'lines', 'perfection', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'turned', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'one', 'required', 'be', 'quite', 'versatile', 'ran', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'plentiful', 'film', 'era', 'also', 'quite', 'exceptional', 'Sturges', 'would', 'often', 'create', 'character', 'purpose', 'having', 'deliver', 'excellent', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'just', 'happened', 'come', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fitting', 'coming', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'Everything', 'attempted', 'here', 'worked', 'Even', 'montage', 'Sullivan', 'girl', 'interacting', 'homeless', 'much', 'longer', 'montage', ""'d"", 'seen', 'modern', 'film', 'seamless', 'restoration', 'effort', 'here', 'only', 'only', 'did', 'feature', 'wildly', 'impress', 'bonus', 'content', 'here', 'favorite', 'Criterion', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Guest', 'McKean', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'fan', 'commentary', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'films', 'interspersed', 'factual/historical', 'commentary', 'Baumbach', 'Bowser', 'addition', '76-minute', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'Sturges', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'outtakes', 'trailer', 'stills', 'storyboards', 'publicity', 'materials', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'releases', 'Criterion', 'ever', 'rendered', 'film', 'single', 'disc.Needless', 'say', 'DVD', 'triggered', 'immediate', 'purchase', 'Lady', 'Eve', 'worthy', 'whole', 'different', 'post', 'film', 'respective', 'thread', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', 'Great', 'McGinty', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Criterions', 'enjoy']",N/A
247824,A2QKMTVZK2GWIH,6301232291,dnewman2,"[4, 4]","If you've never heard of Preston Sturges, you've never heard of Hollywood's first great writer/director.  Certainly, Charlie Chaplin preceded Sturges in that role, but Chaplin was a phenomenally popular screen presence who used his box office clout to take control of his own films.Preston Sturges started his career as a writer, having some Broadway success as a playwright before transitioning to Hollywood.  In 1940, he convinced the powers-that-be to give him a shot directing his script for the political satire, THE GREAT McGINTY.  That began a surge of brilliant, fast-talking screen comedies that was substantially over by the time World War II ended (though he did go on to make a few lesser-regarded films before his death in 1959).  But during his amazing run, Sturges paved a path for the likes of Billy Wilder, who, unlike his auteur predecessor, always wrote with a partner.So, if you've never heard of Preston Sturges, you've probably never heard of CHRISTMAS IN JULY, THE LADY EVE, THE PALM BEACH STORY, THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK or HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.  All of them are terrific and well worth checking out.  But if one Sturges film rises above the others, it's his 1941 masterpiece, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS.While his other movies are pretty much out-and-out comedies, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS mixes Sturges' brilliant, whipsaw-quick, sharp-witted dialogue with much darker elements.  In many ways, some of the most affecting sections of the picture are strictly visual passages, featuring the movie's privileged hero among society's poor and downtrodden.  In these scenes, Sturges evokes THE GRAPES OF WRATH more than HIS GIRL FRIDAY.One thing that raises SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS to the level of classic is its seemingly autobiographical element.  The main character is John Sullivan (Joel McCrea in an endearingly self-effacing performance), a successful Hollywood director of mindless comedies like So Long Sarong, Hey Hey in the Hayloft and Ants in Your Pants of 1939.  But Sullivan is itching to make his serious picture, where he can expose the human condition.  His dream project:  O Brother, Where Art Thou... in case you were wondering where the Coen Brothers got the title for what was essentially their Sturges homage.Against the wishes and advice of his bosses, handlers and servants (made up of a coterie of character actors, most of them part of Sturges' ""stock company""), Sullivan sets out on the road, outfitted as a hobo with just a dime in his pocket.  While his first forays into America's underbelly don't go so well, he does meet A Girl (Veronica Lake), a down-on-her-luck, would-be actress, giving up her Hollywood dream and heading home.  (""There's always a girl."")Without going into the uncompromising twists and turns Preston Sturges packs into his 91 minutes, Sullivan winds up a nameless, convicted murderer on a southern chain gang.  Like every great hero's journey, John Sullivan has to completely, hopelessly bottom out before he is redeemed.  In this case, it's an epiphany about the value of simply making people laugh, offering an escape from daily struggles, sublimely and heartbreakingly realized by this masterful filmmaker.To Preston Sturges' undying credit, the filmmaker succeeds in a way his fictional counterpart doesn't.  In the end, Sturges does make his O Brother Where Art Thou and his Ants in Your Pants... all in one movie - SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS.THE DISCPart of Universal's 100th Anniversary Collection (though the movie was originally released by Paramount), it doesn't appear that a whole lot of restoration was done since the landmark Criterion release over ten years ago.  Still, the black and white classic looks and sounds just fine, presented in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with a mono soundtrack.EXTRASIf you're looking for substantial supplements, the 2001 Criterion release is still in print.  However, it will set you back over twice as much as this bare-bones Universal version.  If you are just looking to check out one of AFI's 100 Greatest Films and aren't concerned about extras, in addition to the classic movie, this release offers:A pair of 8-minute promo videos about the history of Universal Pictures, covering, respectively, ""The Carl Laemmle Era"" and ""The Lew Wasserman Era.""The theatrical trailer for SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS.MY SAYA screwball masterpiece about Hollywood by Hollywood's first great writer/director.

In addition to being really, really funny, it makes a really good point about Hollywood films and even about life in general.Basically, Sullivan's Travels is about a young, rich director (Sullivan, played by Joel McCrea) who, after spending several years making rather silly comedies (such as ""Ants in Your Pants of 1938"") decides to make a serious movie that will reflect on serious issues like poverty and unfairness. When his bosses, who are less than thrilled, point out that he knows nothing about misery and poverty, instead of giving up, he decides to go out in search of trouble. Although, on his first two adventures, he ends up back in Hollywood, only with Veronica Lake at his side, on his third he accidentally gets the trouble he had been hoping to find.At times hilarious, and then turning serious towards the end, Sullivan's Travels is a great defense of comedy. Using clever satire, Sturges points out that people do not want to watch movies about their own unhappiness - instead, they want to laugh (which he certainly makes you do).

During his adventures he meets a young failed actress (Lake) who is about to leave Hollywood.

247829,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301232291,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Preston Sturges (1898-1959) had a long career, but he was on a roll in the early 1940s, and he is best recalled for the handful of films he created between about 1940 and 1944.  Among these is SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, which combined broad comedy with stark drama to create an unexpectedly dark satire.  Although some critics admired it, the film was not widely popular at the time; today, however, many consider it his masterpiece.The film begins as a wickedly funny poke at Hollywood.  Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a film director known for musicals and comedies--but he has now decided to film an extraordinarily dark novel titled O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?  When studio bosses complain that he has no direct knowledge of homelessness, hunger, and hobos, Sullivan agrees... and to the studio's horror decides on ""an experiment:"" he will pass himself off as destitute and live the life he wishes to film.Unfortunately for Sullivan, his plans take a series of unexpected turns.  Pursued by the studio, he is involved in what must be one of the most wildly funny chase sequences ever captured on film; he is almost snared by a widow in search of a new husband; and everything he does seems to snatch him back to the Hollywood he is so desperately trying to escape.  Along the way he encounters ""The Girl"" (Veronica Lake)--who traps him into allowing her tag along during the experiment.  Together they ride the rails in an effort to discover the nature of poverty and despair, and as they do so the film becomes increasingly dramatic and increasingly dark.In what may be the film's most famous sequence, Sullivan and The Girl pass through shanties, soup kitchens, and toxic evangelists.  Now that he feels secure in his ability to film O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? Sullivan returns to Hollywood--but just as the film seems about to return to a comic touch it suddenly jolts further downward.  If Sullivan desired to live the life of the destitute, he is now required to drain the cup.The script is memorable, with Sturges at the height of his witty powers in the opening comic sequences and unexpectedly powerful as the tale turns darkly dramatic, and he shows a sure touch for both extremes as a director as well.  Both Joel McCrae and Veronica Lake give the best performances of their careers, and they are well supported by a host of memorable characters actors that include William Demarest, Eric Blore, and Franklin Pangborn on the comic side and a truly shocking turn by Alan Bride on the dramatic side.  All the same, the film is ultimately most memorable for the way in which it shifts between comedy and drama--and to this day the shift divides viewers: you either find it powerfully effective or jarringly frustrating, and if you come to the film with the idea that this will be another THE LADY EVE or THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK you may be disappointed.For myself, I was impressed.  The Criterion release, like most DVDs offered by that company, is also impressive: the print is excellent, the audio is excellent, and there are enough extras to create a memorable package.  Love it or hate it, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS really is one of those films that everybody should see at least once.

247832,AT04V4H3AO3T5,6301232291,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[3, 3]","Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake star in this satirical offering from writer-director Preston Sturges. McCrea plays a very successful Hollywood film director of silly escapist comedies such as ""Hey-Hey in the Hay"" and ""Ants in Your Pants of 1938."" He longs, however, to make an important, socially-conscious film about poverty to be called ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" When he is derided by his producers for having no knowledge of the plight of the poor, he vows to hit the road as a hobo with 10 cents in his pocket for as long as it takes to gain this knowledge. His producers are perplexed and irritated. They just want him to make ""Ants in Your Pants of 1941.""The early part of this film is filled both with snappy, intelligent dialogue but also with a sophomoric physical comedy which can honestly be considered to be at or below a pie-in-the-face level of sophistication. But however dated these physical antics seem by today's standards, the witty banter of the dialogue holds up quite well. And, when Sullivan runs into ""The Girl"" (Veronica Lake) during one of his sojourns as a bum, the screen lights up and the picture takes off. Lake plays a discouraged would-be actress on the verge of leaving town. Despite her own bad luck, she takes pity on the hobo Sullivan and buys him breakfast. When she eventually finds out his true identity, she insists on accompanying him on the road due to his inexperience at such a lifestyle.Veronica Lake is quite charming in her role as Sullivan's screwball foil. She is no Carole Lombard and she is no Kate Hepburn, but she does have the peek-a-boo hairstyle and she has quite a bit under that hair as well. The support cast fills out the minor roles quite well. They include such shining comedic talents as William Demarest and Eric Blore, though frankly I have seen Blore's talents deployed more effectively in other films (THE GAY DIVORCEE comes to mind).The Girl: I liked you better as a bum.John L. Sullivan: I can't help what kind of people you likeThe second half of this film turns a bit darker for a time. Sullivan's naive and quixotic outings as a tramp have really taught him nothing about poverty or about the lives of quiet desperation led by so many at this time. However, when misfortune genuinely strikes Sullivan, he glimpses first-hand what the truly unfortunate have to go through. But also, importantly, he learns what uplifts them as well. In the end, Sullivan finds purpose and value in his chosen career.SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is memorable and enjoyable film which mocks Hollywood's attempts at making ""movies with a message."" Combining comedy with a touch of realism, this is Sturges's masterpiece about the personal paths one must take toward enlightenment. It is, ultimately, a significant film and one that should be sought out and watched by those who appreciate classic cinema.Jeremy W.

247842,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6301232291,Mike Stone,"[15, 16]","I, like many others of my generation I suspect, first came to know of writer/director Preston Sturges' ""Sullivan's Travels"" via its association with the Coen Brothers' ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""  The latter movie took its name from a film-within-the-film from the former.  John L. Sullivan, a director of successful lowbrow comedies, unhappy with his lofty lot in life, itches to make a socially conscious drama about poverty called... wait for it... ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""  When it's pointed out that Sullivan, borne from the lap of luxury, could not possibly know the first thing about being poor, he decides to raid the movie studio's costume department for a hobo's outfit, and ride the rails in order to gain some life experience.From these rather high concept beginnings, one would expect to find a straightforward comedy wherein our hero comes to realize that the poor are people too.  That movie is here, to be sure, but it's not presented in any conventional manner.  In fact, that part of the story is basically covered within the first thirty minutes.  Which leaves the discerning audience member, one who's been paying attention all along and is well-versed in cinematic narrative convention, wondering, ""Where do we go from here?""  It is to Sturges' ultimate credit that this question is answered in due time and with tremendous skill.The film is mostly a pure comedy, able to dabble in all different kinds of humour, indulging in farce, screwball, verbal wit, and light romance.  But Sturges proves a master at mixing tones, as he is also able to dip a toe into harsh drama, straight social commentary, suspense thriller, and bold satire.  It's one of the most versatile films I know, in that it takes a bite from every dish at the buffet, allowing them all to digest together perfectly.  Sturges is also a master at using a variety of visual styles to tell his story.  He is a wizard of shot composition, framing each scene for maximum stylish effect, but never putting too heavy a hand on the audience's shoulder.  And he is at home equally in scenes composed entirely of long, dialogue-heavy takes, or in quickly-edited scenes of mayhem and madness.But it is Sturges' script that best exemplifies the man's limitless talents.  Despite its unconventionality, it's perfectly structured.  And even though it relies on several far-fetched coincidences to move the story along, those coincidences never feel manipulative, in that they fit in perfectly with the rag-tag universe Sturges has created.  The dialogue, Sturges' bread and butter, is voracious in its wordiness, but very rarely is a word wasted.  Every line either contributes to the plot or provides some quick comedy.  And oh what lines he's written!  There's the oft-quoted rejoinder, which follows Sullivan's plea to the studio execs to allow him to make a movie about society's ills, that it also include ""a little sex?""  These same studio execs typify the oxymoronic, paradoxical, and epigrammatic dialogue when they proclaim the eccentric but successful Sullivan a ""bonehead... but what a genius!""  Even the opening dedication is a paradigm of pyrotechnic wordplay, as it calls attention to the ""motley mountebanks, the clowns, the buffoons"" who make us laugh.  That being said, while letting the audience rely on his verbosity to understand the story, Sturges throws in a rather lengthy dialogue-free montage near the movie's middle, that succinctly moves the story through a lot exposition, without ever seeming tedious.  O Preston, in these times of hack screenwriters and half-baked ideas, where art thou now?For the titular character, Sturges chooses Joel McCrea, a rather likable fellow and a bit of a Ryan O'Neal look-alike.  He plays Sullivan with straight-laced comic timing and just a hint of gravitas.  McCrea, who made three movies with Sturges, ably fills Sullivan's shoes, detailing the man's self-satisfaction, his obliviousness to the world around him, but also his humanity.  McCrea also has to act as the film's de facto straight man, especially in the scenes featuring the manic menagerie sent by the studio to watch out for him.  Despite some slight fumbles in the middle of the longer takes, McCrea is a proficient guide through Preston-land.""How does the girl fit in this picture?"" asks a jailhouse police officer of Sullivan.  ""There's always a girl in the picture,"" comes the reply.  ""Haven't you ever been to the movies?""  With this quick exchange, Sturges is able to both parody and consent to the practice of having a love interest in light comedies.  So Sullivan must be matched with a girl.  His partner in crime, billed cheekily as ""The Girl"" in the film's credits, is Veronica Lake.  Lake, combined with the solid part that Sturges gives her, rises above her seemingly stock character, to portray a woman of intense realism.  In her first scene with McCrea, she brings forth all the girl's most tangible qualities: she is morose, witty, cute as a button, generous, attractive, and armed with a super sexy laugh.  Lake is a spunky little spitfire, the prototype for an actress such as Holly Hunter, but armed with a mountain of real-girl sex appeal that makes her far more attractive.  She is more than an able match for McCrea, giving credence to their burgeoning, but always subdued, love affair.""Sullivan's Travels"" is many things to many people.  I, for one, think its greatest thematic strength is in its satire (its title isn't similar to Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"" by accident), detailing how the liberal upper class loves to pander to those less fortunate, but really doesn't want to get too close to the unwashed masses, lest their white gloves get dirty.  Sullivan, in the end, does learn some lessons, but is he really a changed man at all?  Best set up shop again behind his guarded gates, and focus on his trifling little comedies.  For, as the film's ostensible thesis statement says, ""There's a lot to be said for making people laugh.""

Actor, Joel McCrea is John L. Sullivan, a director of frothy film comedies who desires to make a truly gritty motion picture about the &quot;suffering of humanity&quot;.  One problem - he doesn't know the first thing about suffrage, having been born with a silver spoon and thrust into a lucrative career with money to burn.  So what's a desperate rich guy to do?  He decides to impersonate a hobo and ride the rails in search of 'real' life.  He finds Veronica Lake and a heap of trouble instead.For once - a Criterion disc I can actually recommend on every level.  First, the DVD quality of this classic film is bar none the most outstanding effort from Criterion thus far.  The gray scale is superbly balanced.  Blacks are black.  Contrast and shadow levels are amazing.  Fine details are well represented.  There is some minor edge enhancement and aliasing, but it is so slight and infrequent that I really shouldn't be mentioning it at all. There's barely any digital or film grain for a smooth, thoroughly captivating visual presentation. The audio is mono but cleaned up in such a way that one hardly notices its dated shortcomings.AT LAST - as an extra, Criterion gives us &quot;Preston Sturges: A Life&quot; a thoroughly engrossing, in-depth, full fledged documentary on the man, the making of this movie, as well as a time line documenting Sturges' many other films with a multitude of background material and snippets from each of the movies in Sturges' canon.  The documentary is so good, you'll want to watch it twice.  Yes, there's also an audio commentary and the usual Lux Radio junket that accompanies most Criterion classic titles.  But the documentary is what counts here.BOTTOM LINE: A MUST HAVE DISC FOR ANY FILM BUFF!",4,VERONICA LAKE'S BIG BREAK A TREAT ON DVD,1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,1893,"['string', 'B-movies', 'legendary', 'cool', 'babe', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'graduated', 'big', 'time', 'screwball', 'message', 'picture', 'director', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'Actor', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'John', 'L.', 'Sullivan', 'director', 'frothy', 'film', 'comedies', 'who', 'make', 'truly', 'gritty', 'motion', 'picture', 'quot', 'suffering', 'humanity', 'quot', 'One', 'problem', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'suffrage', 'having', 'been', 'born', 'silver', 'spoon', 'thrust', 'lucrative', 'career', 'money', 'burn', 'what', 'desperate', 'rich', 'guy', 'do', 'impersonate', 'hobo', 'ride', 'rails', 'search', ""'real"", 'life', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'heap', 'trouble', 'instead.For', 'once', 'Criterion', 'disc', 'can', 'actually', 'recommend', 'level', 'First', 'DVD', 'quality', 'classic', 'film', 'bar', 'none', 'most', 'outstanding', 'effort', 'Criterion', 'thus', 'far', 'gray', 'scale', 'superbly', 'balanced', 'Blacks', 'are', 'black', 'Contrast', 'shadow', 'levels', 'are', 'amazing', 'Fine', 'details', 'are', 'well', 'represented', 'minor', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'aliasing', 'so', 'slight', 'infrequent', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'mentioning', 'barely', 'digital', 'film', 'grain', 'smooth', 'thoroughly', 'captivating', 'visual', 'presentation', 'audio', 'mono', 'cleaned', 'up', 'such', 'way', 'one', 'hardly', 'dated', 'shortcomings.AT', 'LAST', 'extra', 'Criterion', 'quot', 'Preston', 'A', 'Life', 'quot', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'in-depth', 'full', 'fledged', 'documentary', 'man', 'making', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'line', 'documenting', 'Sturges', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'multitude', 'background', 'material', 'snippets', 'movies', 'Sturges', 'canon', 'documentary', 'so', 'good', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'twice', 'Yes', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'usual', 'Lux', 'Radio', 'junket', 'most', 'Criterion', 'classic', 'titles', 'documentary', 'what', 'here.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'DISC', 'FOR', 'ANY', 'FILM', 'BUFF']",N/A

This was my first viewing of a film by Preston Sturges and I'm so impressed that I'll surely look for more.There is the usual high energy, and crackling dialogue of the screwball comedies of the era.  But midway through the film, it darkens and a whole other level of human experience is touched.  That's what makes this so remarkable.  There is a scene towards the end in a poor Black church where the pastor leads the congregation in singing ""Let my People Go"" while the men from the nearby prison shuffle in, in chains, to be allowed to watch a ""motion picture.""  I found it amazingly touching.  And then, when they all join together, the poor and the wretched, in hearty laughter...wow that was really a transcendent moment.Joel McRea is winning as the handsome, rich, Hollywood director who want to suffer a little to make his next movie, ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?""Veronica Lake is a perfect match for him,as the down and out wanna be actress who accompanies him on his trek through the dark side.  She hides her famous over-one-eye blond hairdo under a boy's cap as his fellow hobo.Incidentally, the wondeful Coen brothers' film, ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"" must have gotten its title from this movie.

247848,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301232291,Randy Keehn,"[5, 5]","When I watch movies from the 20's, 30's and 40's, I expect to see that a lot of the subject matter and other aspects to be dated.  That's fine with me; I learned a lot about America's Homefront during WWII when I was growing up by watching the Warner Brothers' cartoons of that era.  The Great Depression was something I never had to live through and its' impact on America is often forgotten by those of us who came after.  The political and economic effects on the times were substantial and the extremes of the effects could be seen somewhat from a distance by what was happening then in Europe.  Although movies were actually more of an escape from rather than a portrait of the depression, there are many cinematic examples of how it changed life in America.  I just recently viewed ""My Man Godfrey"", for example, and discovered the not so subtle class message that it contained.  ""Sullivan's Travels"" is a movie of its' time that dared to take on the subject of economic and social injustices yet was able to do so in a manner that entertained while educating.  We were not given a lecture on film but a story of one man's sincere attempt to understand how ""the other half "" lives.  His initial efforts were often comedic and showed that his intentions were clearer than his purpose.  Ultimately, when you were thinking the movie was about to end, everything took a sharp turn and our hero end up getting more than he was looking for.  Along the way was a lot of subtle satire and irony to give us just the right dose of what could be called a message.  One scene struck me in particular.  It took place in a Black church where the parishioners were about to view a movie.  Their guests that Sunday night was to be a group of local White convicts.  The preacher announced that the visitors were coming and to please not make any notice or comment on their circumstances ""Because, after all, we are all God's children"".  This was 1941 for Heaven's sake and the way the writer and director turned things around in that one scene was amazing.  It is a message that might slip past those who came well after the Civil Rights movement.  There are a lot of these subtleties in ""Sullivan's Travels"" and their sum total make for an incredible movie.Preston Struges would have been the Frank Capra of his time except that there already WAS a Frank Capra in his time.  His cast of characters was well-assembled.  Joel McCrea was his typical Man with a Mission character and Veronica Lake already was sporting the one-eyed hair-do.  Their interaction with each other was impressive.  William Demarest exemplified the promoters who just didn't get the message but thought it was terrific anyway.  The movie almost seems like a cross between ""I was a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" with comedy overtones.  There is a message at the end that I found quite interesting and one that the film documented with it's story line.  Let's say that it meant to tell us that when it comes to Marx; we're all better off with Groucho than Karl.  This film exceeded any and all expectations I might have had and I knew it had a good reputation before I even saw it.  While ""Sullivan's Travels"" give us a view of our past, we are given a message that is timeless.

247849,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6301232291,Reviewer,"[7, 8]","When it comes right down to it, what you ""think"" you want isn't necessarily what you ""really"" want, nor is it likely to be anything you need.  But finding the answer is up to the individual, a prospect that's explored in the satirical ""Sullivan's Travels,"" directed by Preston Sturges.  Movie director John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) has made a career of churning out one successful comedy after another, yet he remains unfulfilled.  He longs to do a ""serious"" film, one with meaning, a drama that will leave his mark on the industry and the world.  And he has a property that he thinks is perfect, a screenplay entitled ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""  The studio he works for, however, balks at the idea; Sullivan's comedies are not only good, they're a cash cow for the studio, so why fool with success?Sullivan is adamant, though, and determined to make his film he strikes a bargain with the studio and gets the green light.  But once he's given the go-ahead, he wants to do it right-- and he realizes that to make a truly meaningful film, he must first experience himself the hardships of life he will be examining in ""O Brother.""  So with only a dime in his pockets, he sets out on the road to find out what ""life"" is really all about.  And before it's over, he will get all he's looking for and more, in an odyssey that will be unforgettable for Sullivan, and for the audience, as well.Filled with pathos and poignancy, Sturges' film is an insightful sojourn across the territory of the human condition.  It'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry, as along with Sullivan you come face to face with some hard truths about reality.  And Sullivan's eventual epiphany regarding his personal wants and needs may be your own, as well, because this is a film with a definite message that is honest and undeniable.  A lesson in life delivered subtly and sensitively by Sturges, who makes it entertaining and thought provoking at the same time.  It's refreshing, in fact, t discover a film that delivers such an impact without having to resort to any kind of sensationalism, relying instead on the inherent humanity of the story, which Sturges conveys masterfully.  With exceptions, of course, it's a sensibility few of today's directors seem to possess.  Some notable exceptions would be Ang Lee with ""The Ice Storm,"" Kenneth Lonergan's ""You Can Count On Me"" and Tom DiCillo's ""Box of Moonlight.""  All are films that, like ""Sullivan,"" are journeys of discovery, profound in sentiment without being overly sentimental.  There are more, to be sure, but they seem too few and far between.One of the elements that makes this film so engaging is its colorful cast of characters, and the actors it employs to bring it to life, beginning with it's star, McCrea, who hits his stride as Sullivan with facility.  He credibly reflects Sullivan's ideals and principles with a look, as well as an attitude, that makes it work quite naturally.  You can believe this is a man with, perhaps not a naive, but certainly a rather guarded perception of life in the real world.  Which is not to say he lacks insight or wisdom; it's merely one of the basic truths this film points out-- that people live within parameters of their own design, established through personal experience and frame of reference.  And that's the John Sullivan McCrea presents here, with a portrayal that is honest and incisive.Veronica Lake was one of the hottest actresses around in 1942 when this film was made, and as the girl who becomes a part of Sullivan's journey, she lends considerable charm and a bit of mystique to the film.  It's a fairly straightforward role that benefits from her sparkle and personality; a notable performance that adds a touch of humor and some class to the proceedings, without being particularly exceptional.  But watching her, it's easy to understand the attention she received, especially after draping her long blond hair across her eye, peek-a-boo style-- which started a craze that swept the country, while creating an indelible image that ultimately defined her career.The supporting cast includes Robert Warwick (Mr. Lebrand), William Demarest (Mr. Jones), Franklin Pangborn (Mr. Casalsis), Porter Hall (Mr. Hadrian), Byron Foulger (Mr. Valdelle), Margaret Hayes (Secretary), Robert Greig (Sullivan's Butler) and Eric Blore (Sullivan's Valet).  Call it a lesson in life, or a lesson about human nature; however you see it, ""Sullivan's Travels"" is an experience you're going to remember.  Entertaining, enjoyable and enlightening, it's an uplifting appreciation of the way things are, and not necessarily the way you ""think"" they should be.  It's a film that celebrates the comfort to be found in finding your own niche and realizing the importance of whatever it is that you contribute to your world and those around you.  It leaves you with a sense of purpose and the understanding that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  And it makes your own grass look pretty good in the bargain.  It's the magic of the movies.",5,A Lesson In Life,1008460800,"12 16, 2001",2001,5026,"['When', 'right', 'down', 'what', 'think', 'want', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'likely', 'be', 'anything', 'need', 'finding', 'answer', 'individual', 'prospect', 'explored', 'satirical', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', 'directed', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'Movie', 'director', 'John', 'L.', 'Sullivan', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'made', 'career', 'churning', 'out', 'one', 'successful', 'comedy', 'yet', 'unfulfilled', 'do', 'serious', 'film', 'one', 'meaning', 'drama', 'will', 'leave', 'mark', 'industry', 'world', 'property', 'perfect', 'screenplay', 'entitled', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'studio', 'however', 'balks', 'idea', 'Sullivan', 'comedies', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'good', ""'re"", 'cash', 'cow', 'studio', 'so', 'why', 'fool', 'success', 'Sullivan', 'adamant', 'though', 'determined', 'make', 'film', 'bargain', 'studio', 'green', 'light', 'once', 'given', 'go-ahead', 'do', 'right', 'make', 'truly', 'meaningful', 'film', 'must', 'first', 'experience', 'hardships', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'examining', 'O', 'Brother', 'only', 'dime', 'pockets', 'out', 'road', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'over', 'will', 'get', 'looking', 'more', 'odyssey', 'will', 'be', 'unforgettable', 'Sullivan', 'audience', 'well.Filled', 'pathos', 'poignancy', 'Sturges', 'film', 'insightful', 'sojourn', 'territory', 'human', 'condition', ""'ll"", 'make', 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'make', 'cry', 'Sullivan', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'hard', 'truths', 'reality', 'Sullivan', 'eventual', 'epiphany', 'regarding', 'personal', 'needs', 'may', 'be', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'definite', 'message', 'honest', 'undeniable', 'lesson', 'life', 'delivered', 'subtly', 'sensitively', 'Sturges', 'who', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'same', 'time', 'refreshing', 'fact', 't', 'discover', 'film', 'delivers', 'impact', 'having', 'resort', 'kind', 'sensationalism', 'relying', 'instead', 'inherent', 'humanity', 'story', 'conveys', 'masterfully', 'exceptions', 'course', 'sensibility', 'few', 'today', 'directors', 'seem', 'possess', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'would', 'be', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'Tom', 'DiCillo', 'Box', 'Moonlight', 'are', 'films', 'Sullivan', 'are', 'journeys', 'discovery', 'profound', 'sentiment', 'being', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'are', 'more', 'be', 'sure', 'seem', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'between.One', 'elements', 'film', 'so', 'engaging', 'colorful', 'cast', 'characters', 'actors', 'bring', 'life', 'beginning', 'star', 'McCrea', 'who', 'stride', 'Sullivan', 'facility', 'credibly', 'Sullivan', 'ideals', 'principles', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'attitude', 'work', 'quite', 'naturally', 'can', 'believe', 'man', 'perhaps', 'not', 'naive', 'certainly', 'rather', 'guarded', 'perception', 'life', 'real', 'world', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'insight', 'wisdom', 'merely', 'one', 'basic', 'truths', 'film', 'out', 'people', 'live', 'parameters', 'own', 'design', 'established', 'personal', 'experience', 'frame', 'reference', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'McCrea', 'presents', 'here', 'portrayal', 'honest', 'incisive.Veronica', 'Lake', 'was', 'one', 'hottest', 'actresses', '1942', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'girl', 'who', 'part', 'Sullivan', 'journey', 'considerable', 'charm', 'bit', 'mystique', 'film', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'role', 'benefits', 'sparkle', 'personality', 'notable', 'performance', 'touch', 'humor', 'class', 'proceedings', 'being', 'particularly', 'exceptional', 'watching', 'easy', 'understand', 'attention', 'received', 'especially', 'draping', 'long', 'blond', 'hair', 'eye', 'peek-a-boo', 'style', 'started', 'craze', 'swept', 'country', 'creating', 'indelible', 'image', 'ultimately', 'defined', 'career.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Warwick', 'Mr.', 'Lebrand', 'William', 'Demarest', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'Franklin', 'Pangborn', 'Mr.', 'Casalsis', 'Porter', 'Hall', 'Mr.', 'Hadrian', 'Byron', 'Foulger', 'Mr.', 'Valdelle', 'Margaret', 'Hayes', 'Secretary', 'Robert', 'Greig', 'Sullivan', 'Butler', 'Eric', 'Blore', 'Sullivan', 'Valet', 'Call', 'lesson', 'life', 'lesson', 'human', 'nature', 'however', 'see', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', 'experience', ""'re"", 'going', 'remember', 'Entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'enlightening', 'uplifting', 'appreciation', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'way', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'comfort', 'be', 'found', 'finding', 'own', 'niche', 'realizing', 'importance', 'whatever', 'contribute', 'world', 'sense', 'purpose', 'understanding', 'grass', 'not', 'always', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'own', 'grass', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'bargain', 'magic', 'movies']",N/A

Everyone will have a favourite (my personal weak spot is The Lady Eve) but Sullivan's Travels grows in my affections with every viewing.  It is always remarkable to witness how influential the movie is, particularly, but not exclusively, in the works of the Coen brothers.  Joel McRae is playing the director who goes looking for the underbelly of America and along the way he finds Veronica Lake.  She could not be equaled, from the first moment her famous look is seen in the film until her laughter at the end.  She looked like a smoldering noir femme fatale and spoke and acted like a screwball comedienne.  It was a style not suited for many pictures but it was a perfect match for Preston Sturges in this one and she does very well by him and vice versa. The change in the movie from comedy to pathos, troubing and too abrupt for some viewers, is beautifully handled and the church sequence with the prisoners and the black parishioners is astonishing and handled with great cinematic skill.

247851,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301232291,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Sullivan's Travels (Preston Sturges, 1942)Sullivan's Travels is one of the movies I'd never heard of before I started compiling critics' thousand-best lists, but that kept cropping up time after time (of the nine lists I have collected, it appears on seven, including Jonathan Rosenbaum's, the They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? list, and Peter Travers' Rolling Stone list).With so many voices behind it, I figured that when I sat down to watch this monster list of movies, I should put this one up near the top. And I'm very glad I did.Sullivan's Travels is the story of John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), a director of light comedies who has an obsession with making O, Brother, Where Art Thou?, a serious film about the trials and travails of humanity. An existential drama, if you will. His producers point out to him that he knows nothing of trouble, and so he sets out to disguise himself as a hobo and learn about human misery firsthand. On his first stop, at a diner, he meets an aspiring actress (Veronica Lake, known in the film only as ""The Girl""), and through the machinations of fate, she ends up finding out his identity and taking the trip with him. There's more to it than that, but the big plot twist comes late enough in the movie that we're headed for spoilerville if we reveal it, and it's entirely possible to sing the movie's praises without going that far in.Why? Because this movie is damned funny. I found myself chuckling more times per minute here than I have at any movie I can think of since It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. It turns dark about half an hour from the end, but the hilarity of the first hour just underscores the darkness; this is where the genius of Preston Sturges comes into play. By the time we hit Sullivan's immortal line, ""There's a lot to be said for making people laugh. Did you know that's all some people have?"", Sturges has managed to make us understand exactly that. A warm, funny, deeply-felt movie.

247853,A16QODENBJVUI1,6301232291,Robert Moore,"[10, 11]","One of the great screen comedies, and one in a string of absolutely brilliant comedies that Preston Sturges made in the space of only a few years, unquestionably the hottest streak any comedy director has ever gone on in a short period of time.  This film contains a great deal more slapstick than his other films, and a great deal more social satire.  Sturges doesn't quite mean it as a &quot;message&quot; picture, but in the end it does have overtones of an apologia pro vita sua as a comedy director.  Sturges wants to say that he is a comedy director, and he isn't going to apologize for it, because making people laugh in hard times is one of the highest functions of art.SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is one of two superb comedies that Joel McCrea made with Sturges, the other being the equally outstanding THE PALM BEACH STORY.  As most are aware, McCrea plays director John L. Sullivan, who has made his mark in Hollywood directing lightweight comedies, such as the &quot;Ants in Your Pants&quot; series.  But now he wants to make a serious, &quot;meaningful&quot; film:  O Brother!  Where Art Thou?  The studio head points out that Sullivan knows nothing about real life, and conceding his point without giving up his intentions, Sullivan decides to hit the road and live as a hobo in order to discover real life.Like nearly all Sturges films (at least before his rapid and dramatic decline in late 1944), this film features an absolutely outstanding cast.  His best films seem to feature a cast with literally dozens of great character actors, and this is no exception.  Most of the Sturges regulars are here, like William Demarest and Robert Warwick, along with a host of others whose faces will be familiar to any Sturges fan, even if the names are not.  The film also features the first major role for Veronica Lake, who enjoyed only a short career at the top, but who endures in memory as one of most stunningly beautiful women in Hollywood history, so much an icon that in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, Kim Basinger's character was a prostitute who would be with men impersonating Veronica Lake.Most Sturges films are characterized by their rapid-fire dialog, manic pace, and enormous wit.  He always wrote his own scripts, and as good as he could be as a director, he was much better as a writer.  For several years before becoming a director, he distinguished himself along with Billy Wilder as perhaps the premier comic writer in Hollywood.  This film contains moments that are classic Sturges.

Sadly, he died an out-of-fashion, nearly forgotton man in 1959. SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS is one of the director genius's finest films - and certainly one of his most personal - in that it's about a Hollywood director; this is his version of &quot;the clown who wants to play Hamlet&quot;. The film undertakes a bold assignment. Its narrative shifts from comedy to tragedy and back to comedy, something seldom successfully accomplished in the movies. Those who criticise the film usually do so on the basis of its serious scenes when the hero, Joel McCrea, is arrested and sent to a prison chain gang where the only thing the convicts have to look forward to is the cartoon they share with a black church group on special occasions. This movie's stucture, however, is skillfully executed, and the hero's descent into a social hell uncushioned by money and power is presented largely through an effective montage, followed by the prison sequence. The ultimate return to comedy is indeed abrupt, but it demonstrates the theme of the film. The most successful portions of the film are those in which he satirizes Hollywood with an insider's advantage. As always, Sturges was adept at pointing out the absurdity and essential phonies of a world which, rotten to the core and corrupted by the desires for money and success, maintains an outward sheen of respectability and good manners.",5,A FILM TO CHERISH!,1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,1533,"['One', 'most', 'respected', 'admired', 'director/writers', 'forties', 'Preston', 'Sturge', 'career', 'fell', 'apart', 'decade', 'critical', 'commercial', 'successes', 'Sadly', 'died', 'out-of-fashion', 'nearly', 'forgotton', 'man', '1959', 'SULLIVAN', 'TRAVELS', 'one', 'director', 'genius', 'finest', 'films', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'personal', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'version', 'quot', 'clown', 'who', 'play', 'Hamlet', 'quot', 'film', 'bold', 'assignment', 'narrative', 'shifts', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'back', 'comedy', 'something', 'seldom', 'successfully', 'accomplished', 'movies', 'who', 'criticise', 'film', 'usually', 'do', 'so', 'basis', 'serious', 'scenes', 'when', 'hero', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'arrested', 'sent', 'prison', 'chain', 'gang', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'convicts', 'have', 'look', 'forward', 'cartoon', 'share', 'black', 'church', 'group', 'special', 'occasions', 'movie', 'stucture', 'however', 'skillfully', 'executed', 'hero', 'descent', 'social', 'hell', 'uncushioned', 'money', 'power', 'presented', 'largely', 'effective', 'montage', 'followed', 'prison', 'sequence', 'ultimate', 'return', 'comedy', 'indeed', 'abrupt', 'theme', 'film', 'most', 'successful', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'insider', 'advantage', 'always', 'Sturges', 'was', 'adept', 'pointing', 'out', 'absurdity', 'essential', 'phonies', 'world', 'core', 'corrupted', 'desires', 'money', 'success', 'outward', 'sheen', 'respectability', 'good', 'manners']",N/A

Yet, despite its pointed commentary on the social and economic ills inherent in American society, its core message is an important one - people should never underestimate the important role laughter plays in their everyday lives.Film director John Sullivan (Joel McCrea) tells his studio bosses that he has grown tired of making comedies and wants to direct a project with more substance.  He comes up with a plan to pose as a vagrant in order to learn first-hand how the real world treats the less fortunate.  After he comes back from his masquerade, Sullivan plans to use his experiences to make an important and socially-conscious new work.  A young, struggling actress (Veronica Lake) joins him on his journey but Sullivan's plans go awry when a strange series of circumstances leads to his imprisonment.""Sullivan's Travels"" sometimes feels like it is biting off more than it can chew.  Sturges uses Sullivan's 90-minute cinematic trek to comment upon the economic and artistic conflicts present in the Hollywood system, the plight of the downtrodden, and the troubling problems that exist in the American justice and prison systems.  Trying to cover so much ground proves disorienting as the story oftentimes abruptly changes its focus.  However, ""Sullivan's Travels"" nonetheless mostly succeeds in its multi-tasking endeavor and turns out to be both an entertaining and thought-provoking viewing experience.  McCrea is perfectly cast in the lead role and Veronica Lake oozes with screen presence in every frame she occupies.

247862,A2GR77QCSCF3ZE,6301232291,"Ted L. Reinert ""Ted L. Reinert""","[8, 8]","At the beginning of writer-director Preston Sturges' ""Sullivan's Travels,"" worried Hollywood studio heads resist director John Sullivan's (Joel McCrea) desire to make a socially important movie about America's poor, telling him that such a movie cannot be made, least of all by him -- a director of such cheerful comedies as ""Hey Hey In The Hayloft"" and ""Ants In Your Plants of 1939"" -- because he simply doesn't know anything about the huddled masses upon whom he intends to shine his moral lantern. Sullivan therefore dresses as a tramp and sets out to get a first-hand look at what a tramp's life is really like. For the rest of the movie (ostensibly a comedy), Sullivan endures the indignities, hardships and outrageous injustice to which tramps are indifferently and routinely subjected. By this amazing feat of paralepsis (that is, the device of emphasizing a thing by omitting it or mentioning it only cursorily), Sturges manages to present precisely the socially-significant, ""Important"" picture that he never stops telling us cannot be made. Along the way, he also succeeds where Shakespeare's clowns in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" fail, viz., he creates ""very tragical mirth.""Possibly his best movie, ""Sullivan's Travels"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. Sturges' extraordinarily literate and witty dialogue has never been matched, very rarely even approached (although John Collier's wonderful dialogue in ""Deception"" is a real contender). Yet for all his sophistication and the scintillating brilliance of his rapid-fire dialogue, Sturges was also a master of lowbrow buffoonery and regularly included extended sequences with no dialogue whatsoever. He was adept at everything he took an interest in, and he was interested in everything. He loved all aspects of movie making, and his pictures -- ""Sullivan's Travels"" especially -- are wonderfully cinematic, full of amazing crane shots, extraordinarily long dolly shots and other displays of virtuoso camera work. But his virtuosity -- unlike, say, Orson Welles' -- is at all times tempered by discretion and an irreproachable sense of what is suitable and necessary. His cinematography is as ingenious as Welles', but less ostentatious, more aesthetically pleasing, and always, always to the purpose. ""Sullivan's Travels"" is one of the strangest blends of comedy and drama that you're likely to see. It's usually categorized as a comedy, but despite the exceptionally witty banter and a few masterfully choreographed slapstick set-pieces, don't be surprised if you don't remember laughing when it's over. For despite the superbly antic dialogue and the incredible number of sharply-delineated comic types capering about on its surface, ""Sullivan's Travels"" is an unusually serious-minded picture. Each comic sequence plays in the shadow of drama; the drama, moreover, is of rare and surprising intensity. It presents as stark a depiction of Depression Era misery as anything in ""The Grapes of Wrath"" -- starker, if you ask me. For one thing, since ""The Grapes of Wrath"" takes place entirely among the poor, Tom Joad and his family exist, as it were, in a vacuum of destitution. Keeping the story entirely within the narrow confines of the Joad's world demonstrates restraint and (perhaps) artistic integrity, but such integrity comes at a price. For the poverty that initially startles and sickens us, loses, as we grow familiar with it, its powerful hold on our emotions. John Ford also succumbs, as he always does, to sentimentality: the sodden sweepings from Emotion's banquet -- as if the grim world he presents would be too much for us to bear if left unpalliated by a few Fordian flourishes of sugared-over ""humanity.""""Sullivan's Travels"" is an overtly emotional movie, refreshing for the sincerity and grandeur of its emotionalism. Often overbroad, nearly crude in its obviousness, it is never sentimental because, for all its exaggeration, it tells the truth. Sturges places poverty in context by emphasizing the stark difference between the lives of the rich and poor. Witty scenes depicting the empty-headed idle rich at play provide ironic contrast to scenes played among crowds of starving, hollow-eyed wraiths huddled into nightmarish work camps, charity wards and Hoovervilles. By themselves, the comic scenes at the Hollywood studio and at Sullivan's shimmering stucco mansion would be delicious and charming; juxtaposed amidst depictions of want, however, comedy starts to looks frivolous, even callous, nearly poisonous: the antithesis of comic relief. In ""Sullivan's Travel's"" comedy makes tragedy more desperately cruel. Yet it also argues convincingly that comedy is our only hope against despair.The Criterion Collection's recent release of ""Sullivan's Travels"" is what DVD technology is all about. The crystal clear digital transfer alone makes the DVD well worth having, but there is also an excellent Emmy Award winning documentary about Sturges' life as well as an interesting interview with his widow, Sandy Sturges (an amazingly well-spoken, beautiful and likeable woman), and an often amusing commentary track featuring, among others, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean.",5,Sullivan's

(But can you sit through a ridiculous car chase, a hobo with a bag on a stick, a Negro cook who dips his face into pancake batter. . ? Some stuff from the 1940's cinema seems so campy, so silly, so sentimental. Imagine how absurd films made today will look in about 50 years. Everything will be hatred and explosion and outdated coolness.)But when Veronica Lake appears and friendship and romance and danger and trouble happen (all still pretty stylized), the film becomes likeable and effective.And, of course, as the saying went: Veronica Lake is easy on the eyes.",3,Nice tenderness; too much camp,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,673,"['can', 'get', 'first', 'scene', 'Veronica', 'Lake', ""n't"", 'easy', 'do', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'can', 'sit', 'ridiculous', 'car', 'chase', 'hobo', 'bag', 'stick', 'Negro', 'cook', 'who', 'face', 'pancake', 'batter', 'stuff', '1940', 'cinema', 'so', 'campy', 'so', 'silly', 'sentimental', 'Imagine', 'how', 'absurd', 'films', 'made', 'today', 'will', 'look', 'about', '50', 'years', 'Everything', 'will', 'be', 'hatred', 'explosion', 'outdated', 'coolness', 'when', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'friendship', 'romance', 'danger', 'trouble', 'happen', 'still', 'pretty', 'stylized', 'film', 'likeable', 'effective.And', 'course', 'saying', 'went', 'Veronica', 'Lake', 'easy', 'eyes']",N/A

With ""Sullivan's Travels"" we catch Sturges at the top of his game. Joel McCrea the everyman of the 40's turns in a terrific performance as the bright but lightweight director John Sullivan (Sully to his friends). Sully wants to make serious pictures after a career of churning out lightweight comedies. His next project ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" (wittily referenced in the Cohen brothers film of the same name nearly six decades later)will be a socially conscious look at the suffering of the common man. The only problem is that Sully knows absolutely nothing about suffering or hardship. Sully decides to rough it as a hobo and discovers much more than he wanted to about suffering. He meets ""The Girl"" (Veronica Lake lovely as ever)and discovers more about the world than he ever imagined.Sturges fell into drama when he became ill and read about creating dramas while recooperating. His first major play ""Strictly Dishonorable"" became a huge Broadway hit in the 30's. As a child Sturges' mother became ""friends"" with Isadora Duncan and Sturges was dragged around with the two of them and had a very unconvetional upbringing nicely profiled in the original PBS Emmy winning documentary ""Preston Sturges: The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer"". ""The Power and the Glory"" Sturges first written screenplay earned him over $17,000 in the 30's against the profits of the film by producer Jesse Lasky. Sturges already had made enemies in Hollywood by becoming wildly successful as an independent writer and later director. Featuring interviews with friends and Sturges' last widow, vintage footage, stills & footage from his productions and home movies of Sturges, Kenneth Bowser's excellent documentary provides insight into Sturges' career as a writer and film director.There's also storyboards, blueprints for the sets, original publicity materials, the original theatrical trailer, a Hedda Hopper interview with Struges, recordings of Struges' original song ""My Love"" and poem ""If I Were King"", this is one of the best Criterion releases out there.
