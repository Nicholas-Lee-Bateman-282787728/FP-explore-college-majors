1045496,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000MEYKBY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Dark Ride is a VERY typical horror movie.  It's about a bunch of college teens who like to party and do drugs.  They take a van to an empty carnival and decide they want to explore the place.  Along the way, they pick up a female stranger who happens to be extremely silly and loves doing drugs.  So, she fits right in with the other teens in the van.When all of them arrive to the carnival and go inside, this is when everything goes crazy.  All the teens one by one fall victim to this crazy maniac who likes to kill people in creative ways.  This has all been done a million times in other similar movies so I don't need to explain all the creative ways the teens die.One thing that was disappointing was how so much time was devoted to building up suspense, and then when the action/killing segments arrived, there wasn't much movie time left so all the killings happened quite fast.  Like in a matter of 30 minutes.  Some of the deaths were quite disgusting in the way they were extremely bloody and violent while sex acts were taking place.I was surprised that the one girl died, because I thought they were building to some kind of relationship involving the other teen.

The premise of the show demanded more attention and more creativity. It needed to be and could have been a cut above the rest and it wasn't.

This film actually turned out to be ok, I had heard mixed things about this movie some saying it was great others hating it. So I went into this with an open mind and came out thinking that while it had its moments it was just ok. This film is most definitely a throw back to the days of when the slasher film rained supreme, the 80's. It really does have that old feeling to it and while some may not like that I think it is a plus. But don't come into this thinking this is a classic because it is far from it, to be honest it is not even the best in the ""AFTER DARK"" series. I will say to its credit that it may not be the worst in the series either so expect something that is some were in between. Of course to enjoy it at its full potential go into this movie with absolutely no expectations and you may end up some what entertained, you may even like the film.A group of friends decide that the time is right for a road trip and all meet up and are off and running. While off on the road they decide to stop off some where were they come across an advertisement for a you guess it ""Dark Ride"", of course they decide to check it out since one of them recognizes the place. It turns out years ago a man went inside of the ride and killed two little girls in a very creative way. With that bit of information they decide that is the next stop along the way, so we are off. While on their way there they happen upon a hitchhiker who happens to be very easy on the eyes, but she is also a little off [absolutely the best scene in the film]. Once she is picked up and wants to go along they make their way there and break into the attraction. It is here that things get a little interesting as it turns out the killer escaped from the asylum and made his way back to the ride. How lucky is he that a group of fresh new victims are at his disposal, was it luck?The killer in this film to its credit is interesting but you really don't get enough of him, or maybe you do but it doesn't feel that way. Unfortunately that is were the interesting characters stop for the most part, I say that for a reason. The reason being is that at one point or another most of the characters in this film seem interesting, I know that sounds weird but it is true. They either start out interesting but eventually end up annoying or they were just there and developed into something interesting later. That is not to say that the performances were terrible [some were] just the characters were not fully developed, of course this is a slasher flick so maybe I am being a little hard.Writers Robert Dean Klein and Craig Singer who is also the director really stuck to the basics of a slasher movie, serve up some young bodies to a killer with a knife [or ride in this case]. I guess in that respect they brought a bit of originality to this film but the creative kills are not explored enough. Also it takes a while to even get to the kills and once it does the movie is to quick, once it picks up it is over. And while the ending is pretty cool it is way to obvious as you will guess it right after the first kill. Patrick Renna, Andrea Bogart, and Alex Solowitz turn in some good performances - but see what I said above earlier about the characters of this film. Patrick's ""Bill"" seems to be a good character throughout but remember what I said about the ending?I will not say that this is a horrible movie and I will not warn anybody not to see this, you may actually like this film because it does have its moments.

1045507,AF3L7GVC6T94P,B000MEYKBY,Geminiguy,"[5, 6]","""Dark Ride"" is hardly innovative. For that matter, it isn't really all that scary. The jumps are amped up because of the setting (an eerie funhouse) but the scares are not all that frightening. It begins with an interesting premise. Twin girls go into a fun house ride and are offed in grotesque fashion by a man who is out of his mind. Fast forward about 14 years and a group of college aged friends break into the ""Dark Ride"" for a night of cheap fun... only to be terrorized by the same killer who weeks earlier escaped from the mental institution.The setting provides most of the jump moments as previously mentioned, and the killer is effectively eerie in the manner in which he carries himself. Donning a mask too small for his face, he has an odd child  like quality to him that makes his brutality seem even more disturbing.Being a slasher flick that has elements from other horror greats like the origonal Texas chainsaw Massacre and Black Christmas, this film has a chilling feel to it but that's really all it has to offer. The acting is average... some of the stars hitting and others missing. The characters they play are a blend between stupid and dumb as intellegence seems to be left at the rides enterance. There are decent kill scenes and others that happen off screen. There is a mildly sexually explicit moment and brief nudity for horror fans who are into that sort of thing. Including the obligatory ""twist"" ending (a twist I picked up on rather early) modern slasher flicks feature these days, this film is  merely average with a couple of jump inducing red herrings and messy gore shots.",3,Average slasher fare with shout outs to Slasher past greats,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,1611,"['Dark', 'Ride', 'hardly', 'innovative', 'matter', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'scary', 'jumps', 'are', 'amped', 'setting', 'eerie', 'funhouse', 'scares', 'are', 'not', 'frightening', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Twin', 'girls', 'go', 'fun', 'house', 'ride', 'are', 'offed', 'grotesque', 'fashion', 'man', 'who', 'mind', 'Fast', 'forward', '14', 'years', 'group', 'college', 'aged', 'friends', 'break', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'night', 'cheap', 'fun', 'only', 'be', 'terrorized', 'same', 'killer', 'who', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'escaped', 'mental', 'institution.The', 'setting', 'most', 'jump', 'moments', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'killer', 'effectively', 'eerie', 'manner', 'Donning', 'mask', 'too', 'small', 'face', 'odd', 'child', 'quality', 'brutality', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing.Being', 'slasher', 'flick', 'elements', 'other', 'horror', 'greats', 'origonal', 'Texas', 'chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'film', 'chilling', 'feel', 'really', 'offer', 'acting', 'average', 'stars', 'hitting', 'others', 'missing', 'characters', 'play', 'are', 'blend', 'stupid', 'dumb', 'intellegence', 'be', 'left', 'rides', 'enterance', 'are', 'decent', 'kill', 'scenes', 'others', 'happen', 'off', 'screen', 'mildly', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'moment', 'brief', 'nudity', 'horror', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'sort', 'thing', 'Including', 'obligatory', 'twist', 'ending', 'twist', 'picked', 'up', 'rather', 'early', 'modern', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'feature', 'days', 'film', 'merely', 'average', 'couple', 'jump', 'inducing', 'red', 'herrings', 'messy', 'gore', 'shots']",Dark Ride: After Dark Horrorfest

1045512,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B000MEYKBY,Joker,"[2, 2]","Just some thoughts...For those of you who have seen Tobe Hooper's horror movie The Funhouse (1981), well, Dark Ride (2006) is pretty much the same concept, except for a subplot and a twist at the end.  In addition to borrowing from The Funhouse, this movie also borrows from horror movies of the past, such as Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and others.  Watch this movie to see what I mean.  This movie is not an official remake of The Funhouse, but it comes close to being one.Basically, this movie is about a bunch of stupid, naive, foul-mouthed, horny college kids who get high and are on spring break and decide they want to spend the night in a carnival funhouse in New Orleans called Dark Ride.  Back in 1989, this funhouse attraction was the site of two twin girls' brutal murders.  Now the funhouse is re-opening a decade after the murders.  The murderer from ten years earlier, named Jonah, has escaped from a mental institution and is returning to the Dark Ride funhouse to prey on these college kids.  While the movie is very predictable in parts, it is unpredictable near the end.  I think the pacing is bad.  It is very slow moving for the first two-thirds of the movie.  Everything seems to happen in the last half hour.  The acting is fair at best.  You'll hear lots of foul language, see some breasts, some sex acts, and of course a lot of blood and gore.  I found (as is the case with so many slasher movies) that I didn't care about any of these kids AT ALL.  There's no character development.  They're just shallow characters who are set up to be killed.  One of the girls is a real airhead.  Very typical of slasher movies.  The ending?  Unpredictable.The props inside the funhouse are cool, definitely on par with the The Funhouse, if not better.  The sound effects throughout the movie were good.The Funhouse is better than this.  Even though that movie pays homage to Halloween and Psycho at the beginning, it's an original from the imagination of Tobe Hooper.  The Funhouse is the real deal.Overall, Dark Ride is a pretty good slasher movie.  I give it 3 1/2 stars.  I recommend it if you don't set your expectations too high.",3,Quite a dark ride,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,2159,"['Just', 'thoughts', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'horror', 'movie', 'Funhouse', '1981', 'well', 'Dark', 'Ride', '2006', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'concept', 'subplot', 'twist', 'end', 'addition', 'borrowing', 'Funhouse', 'movie', 'also', 'horror', 'movies', 'past', 'such', 'Halloween', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'others', 'Watch', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'movie', 'not', 'official', 'remake', 'Funhouse', 'close', 'being', 'one.Basically', 'movie', 'bunch', 'stupid', 'naive', 'foul-mouthed', 'horny', 'college', 'kids', 'who', 'get', 'high', 'are', 'spring', 'break', 'want', 'spend', 'night', 'carnival', 'funhouse', 'New', 'Orleans', 'called', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'Back', '1989', 'funhouse', 'attraction', 'was', 'site', 'two', 'twin', 'girls', 'brutal', 'murders', 'Now', 'funhouse', 're-opening', 'decade', 'murders', 'murderer', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'named', 'Jonah', 'escaped', 'mental', 'institution', 'returning', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'funhouse', 'prey', 'college', 'kids', 'movie', 'very', 'predictable', 'parts', 'unpredictable', 'end', 'think', 'pacing', 'bad', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'Everything', 'happen', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'acting', 'fair', 'best', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'lots', 'foul', 'language', 'see', 'breasts', 'sex', 'acts', 'course', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'found', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'slasher', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'kids', 'AT', 'ALL', 'character', 'development', ""'re"", 'just', 'shallow', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'killed', 'One', 'girls', 'real', 'airhead', 'Very', 'typical', 'slasher', 'movies', 'ending', 'Unpredictable.The', 'props', 'funhouse', 'are', 'cool', 'definitely', 'par', 'Funhouse', 'not', 'better', 'sound', 'effects', 'movie', 'were', 'good.The', 'Funhouse', 'better', 'Even', 'movie', 'homage', 'Halloween', 'Psycho', 'beginning', 'original', 'imagination', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'Funhouse', 'real', 'deal.Overall', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'pretty', 'good', 'slasher', 'movie', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high']",Dark Ride: After Dark Horrorfest

I was under the impression that these films were supposed to take us where no other horror films have taken us. This, however, is just a generic slasher. I would suggest looking at any of the other Horror Fest movies before this one.Our cast of characters are a bunch of stereotypical college students. All they care about are drugs and sex. They all seem to have drama going on in their lives, but nothing important to the plot of the movie. Only one character stands out, but he stands out way too much. This makes the ending of the movie extremely obvious.These students plan on taking a road trip for Spring Break. Along the trail they decide to stay at an abandoned Amusement Park. The Park was shut down twenty years ago after two young twins were brutally murdered. Regardless, they decide to settle down for the night like any normal idiotic person. It just so happens that the killer, named Jonah, has escaped from a mental institution and is on the loose again. Jonah returns to his former killing grounds for some fun.Dark Ride features a good amount of gore. Only a few moments seem too over the top. Overall I felt the gore factor was just right in this movie. However, check out the deleted scenes for more extreme moments.Jonah is a fairly interesting character. He is a child stuck in a super human's body. He is supposed to mimic the props he sees on the Dark Ride. However, he usually just slashes the person in an innovative way. The whole gimmick of him trying to mimic the ride only comes into play once or twice throughout the entire movie. One problem I had with the killer was that he had little motive. He just killed for fun. This is a key part of most generic slashers.There is are a few shocks every now and then. Most of them are cheap though, and involve the Dark Ride props jumping out at you. Johan can be fairly disturbing, but actually came out fairly amusing to me. He always came of as an idiot having sick fun. This actually worked for me though. I doubt it will for everyone.The ending is also a key part of all generic slashers. There is a huge over the top ending where the killer is finally put down. After this get a surprise ending...that you saw coming the entire movie. They should have put a nice twist at the end.The extras are pretty good in this one. The commentary track is informative and a fun listen. Their are some worthwhile deleted scenes and a couple making of features. The deleted scenes contain some of the gorier portions of the film.If you are looking for a quick slasher, you might want to try this one.

Bernabo,"[27, 28]","In between screenings of movies at the After Dark Horrorfest (a.k.a ""8 Films 2 Die 4""), when we were discussing the relative merit of the films there was a general consensus that if the distributors (Lionsgate and AfterDark Films) had their druthers, then it would be ""Dark Ride"" that would be their choice for the film to be selected as the best of the fest and get the general release.  That honor when to ""The Abandoned,"" which was something of a surprise to me, but ""Dark Ride"" would have been a safe choice because studio executives would recognize it as your standard formula horror film circa 1980s (e.g., Tobe Hooper's ""The Funhouse"" came out in 1981).  Of course the heart of the slasher film is to put a bunch of soon to be dead teenagers in a specific location, such as Camp Crystal Lake or a carnival fun house, but one of the hallmarks of the genre in the 1980s was that there was always some story about what happened once upon a time in that particular place and you have to pay attention to it because it not only tells you who the slasher is but also another part of the puzzle that gets revealed at the end as the ""twist.""One thing to say for this 2006 horror film from director Craig Singer (""Kill Charlie""), is that he is working with much better cameras and film stock than Tobe Hooper was back in ""Funhouse.""  ""Dark Ride"" certainly does not look like a low budget splatter flick from way back when, but it definitely embraces the genre.  Jumping in the van for a road trip to Cleveland are Cathy (Jamie-Lynn Sigler of ""The Sopranos), Bill (Patrick Renna from ""The Sandlot"" and last night's episode of ""Boston Legal""), Steve (David Rogers from ""The Legend of Butch and Sundance""), Jim (Alex Solowitz from ""Never Been Kissed""), and Liz (Jennifer Tisdale from ""The Hillside Strangler"").  Along the way they pick up hitchhiker Jen (Andrea Bogart from ""DarkWolf""), who gives a bit of a harder edge to tonight's dinner menu.  As soon as you see Sigler's name and realize it is the only one your recognize you know who has the heroine's role in ""Dark Ride"" as the good girl (so forget about looking forward to her gruesome death like you did Paris Hilton in ""House of Wax"").  Jen is the bad girl and Liz the cute girl, while Bill is the nerd, Steve the stud, and Jim the mouthy guy, completing the Mouseketeer roll call that makes up tonight's smorgasbord.On their way to New Orleans the crew are traveling near Ashbury Park New Jersey, where way back in the 1980s (which decade did you expect?) a deformed psycho named Jonah (Dave Warden), brutally murdered a pair of young girls who made the mistake of going on the Dark Ride.  After all these years the Dark Ride is being reopened and given the choice of driving on the Big Easy or breaking into a fun house in the middle of the night, the group picks the latter.  Of course what we know that they do not is that Jonah has just escaped from the mental institution that has held him since he was convicted and now that he is free it is safe to say that he is not going to New Orleans either and that most of these kids are going to end up dead with their blood and guts all over the place.Actually, ""Dark Ride"" is not particularly gory, because half of the fun here is the anticipation as Jonah goes after each next target.  Then there is also the dark humor that runs throughout the film, which is not really all that great, but it is not laughably bad, always a plus in this genre.  If this movie had been released twenty years ago it would have been one of the slickest splatter flicks around, but that probably means those of us who cut our teeth on the original version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and flicks like ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Friday the 13th"" are going to be the ones to round up on ""Dark Ride"" while those weaned on the recent remake of ""TCM"" and films like ""Hostel"" and the ""Saw"" trilogy will decide to round down.  All I ask you to bear in mind when you get to the end and Sigler's Cathy does the right thing at the exact right place at the exact right time, that this bit of audacity is par for the course in those 1980s splatter flicks that Singer is emulating here.  Just remember that in such films what happens at the end is not the twist: it is the punch line.",4,A bunch of teenagers go into a fun house and they are not all getting out alive,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",2007,4262,"['screenings', 'movies', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', '8', 'Films', '2', 'Die', '4', 'when', 'were', 'discussing', 'relative', 'merit', 'films', 'was', 'general', 'consensus', 'distributors', 'Lionsgate', 'AfterDark', 'Films', 'had', 'druthers', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'would', 'be', 'choice', 'film', 'be', 'selected', 'best', 'fest', 'get', 'general', 'release', 'honor', 'when', 'Abandoned', 'was', 'something', 'surprise', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'safe', 'choice', 'studio', 'executives', 'would', 'recognize', 'standard', 'formula', 'horror', 'film', 'circa', '1980s', 'e.g.', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'Funhouse', 'came', 'out', '1981', 'course', 'heart', 'slasher', 'film', 'put', 'bunch', 'soon', 'be', 'dead', 'teenagers', 'specific', 'location', 'such', 'Camp', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'carnival', 'fun', 'house', 'one', 'hallmarks', 'genre', '1980s', 'was', 'was', 'always', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'once', 'time', 'particular', 'place', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'slasher', 'also', 'part', 'puzzle', 'revealed', 'end', 'twist', 'One', 'thing', 'say', '2006', 'horror', 'film', 'director', 'Craig', 'Singer', 'Kill', 'Charlie', 'working', 'much', 'better', 'cameras', 'film', 'stock', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'was', 'back', 'Funhouse', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'certainly', 'not', 'look', 'low', 'budget', 'splatter', 'flick', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'definitely', 'genre', 'Jumping', 'van', 'road', 'trip', 'Cleveland', 'are', 'Cathy', 'Jamie-Lynn', 'Sigler', 'Sopranos', 'Bill', 'Patrick', 'Renna', 'Sandlot', 'last', 'night', 'episode', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'Steve', 'David', 'Rogers', 'Legend', 'Butch', 'Sundance', 'Jim', 'Alex', 'Solowitz', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'Liz', 'Jennifer', 'Tisdale', 'Hillside', 'Strangler', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'Jen', 'Andrea', 'Bogart', 'DarkWolf', 'who', 'bit', 'harder', 'edge', 'tonight', 'dinner', 'menu', 'As', 'soon', 'see', 'Sigler', 'name', 'realize', 'only', 'one', 'recognize', 'know', 'who', 'heroine', 'role', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'good', 'girl', 'so', 'forget', 'looking', 'forward', 'gruesome', 'death', 'did', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'House', 'Wax', 'Jen', 'bad', 'girl', 'Liz', 'cute', 'girl', 'Bill', 'nerd', 'Steve', 'stud', 'Jim', 'mouthy', 'guy', 'completing', 'Mouseketeer', 'roll', 'call', 'up', 'tonight', 'way', 'New', 'Orleans', 'crew', 'are', 'traveling', 'Ashbury', 'Park', 'New', 'Jersey', 'where', 'way', 'back', '1980s', 'decade', 'did', 'expect', 'deformed', 'psycho', 'named', 'Jonah', 'Dave', 'Warden', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'pair', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'going', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'years', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'being', 'reopened', 'given', 'choice', 'driving', 'Big', 'Easy', 'breaking', 'fun', 'house', 'middle', 'night', 'group', 'latter', 'course', 'what', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'Jonah', 'just', 'escaped', 'mental', 'institution', 'held', 'was', 'convicted', 'now', 'free', 'safe', 'say', 'not', 'going', 'New', 'Orleans', 'most', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'blood', 'guts', 'place.Actually', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'not', 'particularly', 'gory', 'half', 'fun', 'here', 'anticipation', 'Jonah', 'next', 'target', 'Then', 'also', 'dark', 'humor', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'not', 'laughably', 'bad', 'always', 'plus', 'genre', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'twenty', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'slickest', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'probably', 'who', 'cut', 'teeth', 'original', 'version', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'flicks', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Friday', '13th', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'ones', 'round', 'up', 'Dark', 'Ride', 'weaned', 'recent', 'remake', 'TCM', 'films', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'trilogy', 'will', 'decide', 'round', 'down', 'ask', 'bear', 'mind', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'Sigler', 'Cathy', 'right', 'thing', 'exact', 'right', 'place', 'exact', 'right', 'time', 'bit', 'audacity', 'par', 'course', '1980s', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'Singer', 'emulating', 'here', 'Just', 'remember', 'such', 'films', 'what', 'end', 'not', 'twist', 'punch', 'line']",Dark Ride: After Dark Horrorfest

Then, I didn't hear much about the film and wondered what had happened to it.  I guess it had merely been shelved away as it wasn't the type of fare geared for a wide release to theatres.  But then the Horror Fest came along and it was ushered onto the screens and now DVD.I was mostly interested as it seemed similar to Tobe Hooper's ""The Funhouse"" which I break out for viewing every so often.  There are many similarities and differences.  ""Dark Ride"" adds mystery and subplot that ""The Funhouse"" never achieves.  However, ""The Funhouse"" is more convincing set-wise in causing the viewer to believe that these characters are actually running around a ""dark ride"" attraction.  Either way, I felt that ""Dark Ride"" succeeds on some levels, especially with the sound mix and scenes of gore.  The cast works well together too, and I liked seeing Jamie Lynn of ""Sopranos"" fame in this kind of role.  The mood and lighting were also great, but I had a hard time believing that these kids could so easily find their way into the dark ride with no concept of how to get out.  But, of course, there would be no movie if it weren't for that little plot point.Dark Ride really plays up the claustrophobic aspect of these characters trapped inside an amusement park attraction.  The dummies and sets strewn throughout the ride are creepy and add greatly to the mood.

Sure,its formulaic,and the character development is straight out of 80's era slasher films,but its good bloody fun. It does have to its credit one of the coolest kill scenes of late,and there are some moments of camp in the film that are certainly well placed if not clever. Dont be expecting acting on par with some of the more recent top shelf splatter fests like Saw,or High Tension, but as I said before the movie is quite fun even considering the ""teens in peril"" storyline has been done to death. Me and a friend of mine attended the Horrorfest at a local theatre last year and lost an entire weekend as a result,but I will say that a couple of the movies,such as Penny Dreadful,Dark Ride and the Abandoned helped to make it not a complete and total loss. Dark Ride is certainly better than a few of the low budget crap floating around on the shelves right now,and I am still interested to see what the After Dark folks have cooked up for this year.

At least make some fun out of this so-so slasher film.Yes this film had gore in it, some of it pretty good. However, because of the enclosed funhouse setting I felt that this film was very boring. However this film adds a scream type angle where someone in the cast is there to add a fine assist to the killers agenda. Not bad, but kind of predictable.

1045524,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,B000MEYKBY,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[4, 4]","When I first saw the commercials for HorrorFest, I was quite excited.  I checked out the previews online, and checked back every week or so to see when they would start posting venues, and then dates and times.  When I finally had all the information needed, including MapQuest directions...it all fell flat.  The directions were poor, and so I arrived too late to bother seeing the first movie I had planned to see that night, and the next TWO were completely sold out.  It was three hours until _Reincarnation_ was going to start, so there seemed little reason to bother hanging around the Elizabeth outlet mall.  HorrorFest had become dead to me.For some reason, I had had no idea that these movies would be released on DVD, but when I did, I thought I might give HorrorFest a second chance.  I had previously found _Reincarnation_ on the eBay gray market, and wasn't thrilled.  So I ordered up the official releases by way of immediate interest, and picked this one up first.I REALLY hope the others are far better than this one.This movie intrigued me first because it seemed that there might be a comic element to it--the set-up seemed so cliche (insane killer escapes asylum to return to the spot of his original crimes, just when a group of college kids make a stopover on their way out on Spring Break), that I thought there might be a chance for some fun--over the top violence that might, like _Shaun of the Dead_, both make fun of and pay homage to its genre.But no.The humor of _Dark Ride_, if there is indeed humor to this, is thin.  With the prodigious amount of blood and guts and brutality that has already blessed the genre, the bar is now high, and this movie does little to meet that bar.  People are stupid in their usual manner for a horror movie, and the killings neither imaginative or offer any attempt at revulsion, just blood.  I wanted to think that all of this was at least a little cognizant of its typical method, but even the ending twist makes this movie a mere imitation of unimaginative horror, or if it's a parody, it's a parody that is so dull in execution that it is about as boring to watch as the movies it might be parodying.",2,Glad I missed seeing this in the theatre,1176595200,"04 15, 2007",2007,2166,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'commercials', 'HorrorFest', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'checked', 'out', 'previews', 'online', 'checked', 'back', 'week', 'so', 'see', 'when', 'would', 'start', 'posting', 'venues', 'then', 'dates', 'times', 'When', 'finally', 'had', 'information', 'needed', 'including', 'MapQuest', 'directions', 'fell', 'flat', 'directions', 'were', 'poor', 'so', 'arrived', 'too', 'late', 'bother', 'seeing', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'planned', 'see', 'night', 'next', 'TWO', 'were', 'completely', 'sold', 'out', 'was', 'three', 'hours', '_Reincarnation_', 'was', 'going', 'start', 'so', 'seemed', 'little', 'reason', 'bother', 'hanging', 'Elizabeth', 'outlet', 'mall', 'HorrorFest', 'had', 'become', 'dead', 'me.For', 'reason', 'had', 'had', 'idea', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'when', 'did', 'thought', 'might', 'give', 'HorrorFest', 'second', 'chance', 'had', 'previously', 'found', '_Reincarnation_', 'eBay', 'gray', 'market', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'ordered', 'up', 'official', 'releases', 'way', 'immediate', 'interest', 'picked', 'one', 'up', 'REALLY', 'hope', 'others', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'one.This', 'movie', 'intrigued', 'first', 'seemed', 'might', 'be', 'comic', 'element', 'set-up', 'seemed', 'so', 'cliche', 'insane', 'killer', 'escapes', 'asylum', 'return', 'spot', 'original', 'crimes', 'just', 'when', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'make', 'stopover', 'way', 'Spring', 'Break', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'chance', 'fun', 'top', 'violence', 'might', '_Shaun', 'Dead_', 'make', 'fun', 'pay', 'homage', 'genre.But', 'no.The', 'humor', '_Dark', 'Ride_', 'indeed', 'humor', 'thin', 'prodigious', 'amount', 'blood', 'guts', 'brutality', 'already', 'blessed', 'genre', 'bar', 'now', 'high', 'movie', 'little', 'meet', 'bar', 'People', 'are', 'stupid', 'usual', 'manner', 'horror', 'movie', 'killings', 'imaginative', 'offer', 'attempt', 'revulsion', 'just', 'blood', 'wanted', 'think', 'was', 'least', 'little', 'cognizant', 'typical', 'method', 'even', 'ending', 'twist', 'movie', 'mere', 'imitation', 'unimaginative', 'horror', 'parody', 'parody', 'so', 'dull', 'execution', 'boring', 'watch', 'movies', 'might', 'be', 'parodying']",Dark Ride: After Dark Horrorfest
1045525,A1Q1V4F9610DB5,B000MEYKBY,Music Lover in Omaha,"[6, 7]","For me, this film earned 4 stars because it did a good job of reworking the original movie 'Funhouse', which is on my list as one of the 5 greatest movies ever made.  In fact, I thought it was downright eerie how much Jamie Lynn-Sigler reminded me of Elizabeth Berridge at the end of the film.  There was some humor in the film that seemed very natural like these were people who might actually talk and act like they did.  I felt that the characters were actually people you could care about one way or another. This movie was bloody enough for me, had enough violence and jumps to keep me interested and had some pretty good characters.  I won't say what little creep I didn't like (actually he was great) but if you watch it you will know.  I also loved Jim played by Alex Solowitz.  This guy played the part of horror movie fodder for the bad guy terrifically.  The only mystery is how he survived so long, but I loved his character's mental deteriorization.  The killer was pretty standard fare but the little twist at the end was kind of neat.  All in all, this was a nice diverting hour and a half.  The original 'Fun House' was a classic.  This one was pretty good and did not shame the original.

Huxley - Thriller Author,"[4, 5]","To understand these movies is to truly understand what HorrorFest and Movies to Die For IS and IS NOT.What it IS NOT: It is not a series of extreme or graphic movies that cannot be released to the public by theaters. Some of these are graphic, but not to the point where these were being hidden away from public viewing.What it IS: HorrorFest is however a great concept from the director of AN AMERICAN HAUNTING who is a huge fan of the horror genre. The director is quoted in Fangoria as saying, ""I was pissed off that there were so many cool and different types of horror films that were made for the big screen, but weren't getting there. I really wanted to create a venue that would at least let some of them [get on the screen] for a limited time. So from that, the idea for the Horrorfest was born.""So they put the word on the street for people to send their movies to them for a chance to be selected to be part of HorrorFest and have their movie on the big screen. They received about 50 movies in all and so they selected an assortment of different horror themes for the public to see. They are not all one type over the other. They each stand on their own and in my opinion are just great.Some more than others for sure.I think DARK RIDE is one of those that is really, really good. Without going into the fine details on the synopsis of the movie, I will tell you briefly it is a throwback to the good ole slasher films, but this one is different where the writer and director went further in character development and creating a wonderful atmosphere.Yes you have young kids making dumb decisions and getting killed for it, but that's what you expect when you see these movies. No, in real life no one is going to have sex in a creepy house or on a creepy ride, except maybe my friend Bentley, but that's a different story entirely. This movie does what it sets out to do: Introduce us to a wicked killer, bring in the kids, take them towards the DARK RIDE, and scare us along the way. This movie delivers!And let me tell you...WOW!!! This ride is very creepy. The jolts and shocks came and I recommend if you have 5.1 surround, turn down the lights and crank it up!!! That's what I did and I found myself hearing things all over the room and it was freaking me out!Most of all I am so glad there is a HorrorFest because I know for myself I do not rent straight-to-dvd horror movies because they typically look lame. Only twice have I been proven wrong and that was with SESSION 9 and DEADBIRDS. HorrorFest gives life to some movies that may have went straight to dvd and never got the publicity it rightly deserved. I hope you take the chance to experience this movie and I highly recommend you seeing UNREST, REINCARNATION, and GRAVEDANCERS as well.I cant wait until HorrorFest 2007.

1045527,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000MEYKBY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Dark Ride (Craig Singer, 2006)When your big draw is that one of your cast members is Ashley Tisdale's sister, you're probably in big trouble. That said, Jennifer, Ashley's older sister, is marginally less annoying, and the movie, while derivative and schlocky, is not thoroughly unwatchable.The very thin plot: In 1989, a serial killer was discovered operating in a dark ride (what the rest of the world calls a tunnel of terror) in an amusement park in Asbury Park, NJ, and put in an institution. He breaks out fifteen years later and heads back to his old hunting grounds. On the same night, a group of kids on their way to spring break decide to spend the night in the same dark ride, which is scheduled to reopen three days hence.The movie suffers from two plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. The first I can't say anything about without revealing some major spoilers, but the second I've already mentioned; how is it that no one figured out that an escaped serial killer would go back to the place where he'd committed his crimes? You'd think there would be a few uniformed people around over and above the security guards. (This would have actually worked in the film's favor, I think, as it would have increased the risk factor for the group of teens breaking into the place to spend the night there.) If things like that will kill your enjoyment of a movie, then you might as well stop reading now; they're there, and they're awful. Now, the many other things that might also kill your enjoyment of this movie. There's the acting, which ranges from mediocre (lead actress Jamie-Lynn Sigler of The Sopranos, whose role consists of either screaming or sleepwalking through her part) to the truly horrific (Alpha Dog's Alex Solowitz, who plays the group's driver, a stoner surfer-dude type; on the plus side, Solowitz is the spitting image of a young Ron Perelman). The special effects are, to put it tactfully, not special. The plot is tissue-paper thin, as it is with most slasher films, but there's not even an inkling of interesting ways to break out of the mold here; this is a straight slasher film of the type that hasn't been fresh since about the first Halloween film.About the only positive thing I can say is that at least, as with the horrible House of Wax remake from a few years ago, both the crew and the ""name"" star were smart enough to keep the most fun murder for said ""name"" star. (It almost takes the cheesiness out of the obligatory bra-flash shot Tisdale has at the beginning of the movie.)But, despite all this, as long as you turn your brain off, it's not something you'll find yourself actively hating. That doesn't come until afterwards, when you're wondering why you just wasted an hour and a half of your life on it. **",2,Standard fare.,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,2764,"['Dark', 'Ride', 'Craig', 'Singer', '2006', 'When', 'big', 'draw', 'one', 'cast', 'members', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'sister', ""'re"", 'probably', 'big', 'trouble', 'said', 'Jennifer', 'Ashley', 'older', 'sister', 'marginally', 'less', 'annoying', 'movie', 'derivative', 'schlocky', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'unwatchable.The', 'very', 'thin', 'plot', '1989', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'discovered', 'operating', 'dark', 'ride', 'what', 'rest', 'world', 'tunnel', 'terror', 'amusement', 'park', 'Asbury', 'Park', 'NJ', 'put', 'institution', 'out', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'heads', 'back', 'old', 'hunting', 'grounds', 'same', 'night', 'group', 'kids', 'way', 'spring', 'break', 'decide', 'spend', 'night', 'same', 'dark', 'ride', 'scheduled', 'reopen', 'three', 'days', 'hence.The', 'movie', 'suffers', 'two', 'plot', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'drive', 'truck', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'revealing', 'major', 'spoilers', 'second', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'how', 'one', 'figured', 'out', 'escaped', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'place', 'where', ""'d"", 'committed', 'crimes', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'few', 'uniformed', 'people', 'security', 'guards', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'worked', 'film', 'favor', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'increased', 'risk', 'factor', 'group', 'teens', 'breaking', 'place', 'spend', 'night', 'there', 'things', 'will', 'kill', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', ""'re"", 'there', ""'re"", 'awful', 'Now', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'might', 'also', 'kill', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'lead', 'actress', 'Jamie-Lynn', 'Sigler', 'Sopranos', 'role', 'screaming', 'sleepwalking', 'part', 'truly', 'horrific', 'Alpha', 'Dog', 'Alex', 'Solowitz', 'who', 'group', 'driver', 'stoner', 'surfer-dude', 'type', 'plus', 'side', 'Solowitz', 'spitting', 'image', 'young', 'Ron', 'Perelman', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'put', 'tactfully', 'not', 'special', 'plot', 'tissue-paper', 'thin', 'most', 'slasher', 'films', 'not', 'even', 'inkling', 'interesting', 'ways', 'break', 'mold', 'here', 'straight', 'slasher', 'film', 'type', ""n't"", 'been', 'fresh', 'first', 'Halloween', 'film.About', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'least', 'horrible', 'House', 'Wax', 'remake', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'crew', 'name', 'star', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'keep', 'most', 'fun', 'murder', 'said', 'name', 'star', 'almost', 'cheesiness', 'obligatory', 'bra-flash', 'shot', 'Tisdale', 'beginning', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'turn', 'brain', 'not', 'something', ""'ll"", 'find', 'actively', 'hating', ""n't"", 'come', 'afterwards', 'when', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'just', 'wasted', 'hour', 'half', 'life', '**']",Dark Ride: After Dark Horrorfest
