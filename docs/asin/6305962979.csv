It's a mildly interesting plot, and hasn't been done to death in the usually blah teen flick genre, so it has that going for it. Klein plays a preppy, wealthy, snotty Princeton freshman who hits on Hartnett's girlfriend, Sobieski, one night at Sobieski's family diner. For some reason, two mostly level headed guys start going at each other, and a testerone-filled race down dirt roads begins. To avoid hitting the pedestrians, the two boys end of hitting a gas station, which blows up the restaurant. Not sure how accurate that is, but it's not important. Funny to note, however, that although most of the blame is put on Klein's character for the fire, he was the one that managed to avoid hitting any people, buildings, or other cars. Hartnett's character escapes with very little blame, but he was the one that actually hit the gas station and caused the disaster. Hm. Leelee Sobieski is a fine actress, but this is not her movie. She goes from flirty and boring to sentimental and boring, with very little in between. That might be because she's never given any good lines in this rather mediocre script, but mostly it's just because the characters is boring. Not enough life. Chris Klein gets a lot of grief for being a lame actor that only gets by on his looks (which are oddly perfect). Not so! In this film, he proves the saving point, turning a bit of teen movie yuck into a well-acted picture. He is very, very good, downplaying his good looks and going almost entirely with his uncanny talent. Delightful and suprising pleasure to watch. Hartnett's character is a bit too perfect to be really interesting - he has no flaws! But is well acted nonetheless. A fairly good movie, maybe worth watching once or twice. Because of so-so script and some stereotypical characters, however, it never really becomes the great movie it could have been.",3,"Part Silly, Part Really Good",998870400,"08 27, 2001",2001,2014,"['High', 'school', 'graduates', 'Kelley', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Sam', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Jasper', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'odd', 'love', 'triangle', 'small', 'Massachusetts', 'town', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'plot', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'death', 'usually', 'blah', 'teen', 'flick', 'genre', 'going', 'Klein', 'preppy', 'wealthy', 'snotty', 'Princeton', 'freshman', 'who', 'Hartnett', 'girlfriend', 'Sobieski', 'one', 'night', 'Sobieski', 'family', 'diner', 'reason', 'two', 'mostly', 'level', 'headed', 'guys', 'start', 'going', 'other', 'testerone-filled', 'race', 'down', 'dirt', 'roads', 'avoid', 'hitting', 'pedestrians', 'two', 'boys', 'end', 'hitting', 'gas', 'station', 'up', 'restaurant', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'accurate', 'not', 'important', 'Funny', 'note', 'however', 'most', 'blame', 'put', 'Klein', 'character', 'fire', 'was', 'one', 'managed', 'avoid', 'hitting', 'people', 'buildings', 'other', 'cars', 'Hartnett', 'character', 'very', 'little', 'blame', 'was', 'one', 'actually', 'hit', 'gas', 'station', 'caused', 'disaster', 'Hm', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'fine', 'actress', 'not', 'movie', 'flirty', 'boring', 'sentimental', 'boring', 'very', 'little', 'might', 'be', 'never', 'given', 'good', 'lines', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'script', 'mostly', 'just', 'characters', 'boring', 'Not', 'enough', 'life', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'lot', 'grief', 'being', 'lame', 'actor', 'only', 'looks', 'are', 'oddly', 'perfect', 'Not', 'so', 'film', 'saving', 'point', 'turning', 'bit', 'teen', 'movie', 'yuck', 'well-acted', 'picture', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'downplaying', 'good', 'looks', 'going', 'almost', 'entirely', 'uncanny', 'talent', 'Delightful', 'suprising', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Hartnett', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'perfect', 'be', 'really', 'interesting', 'flaws', 'well', 'acted', 'nonetheless', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'maybe', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'twice', 'so-so', 'script', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'however', 'never', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A
485270,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305962979,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","You know that scene in `Here on Earth' where Leelee Sobieski's character Samantha is lying in a field and the camera is looming overhead while that Tori Amos song about crying one-thousand oceans plays in the background?  Yeah, I'm thinking about that too.For me, while this film is far from anything even remotely commendable, there is a certain otherworldliness about this film that makes me take a closer look.  The acting, outside of Sobieski, is nothing to write home about, and the script itself is just a hodgepodge of scenes from more effective love stories, but there is something in the air (the film is breathtaking to look at) that just makes me a little weak...as in, too weak to turn the channel.  Even though the ending is as contrived and unimaginative as they come (I love the parody of `Love Story' that this sites review calls to mind) it doesn't for a second make me hate this movie.  Despite the fact that the plot itself makes me angry and I find the romance between the two leads to not only be insulting (poor Josh) but highly unbelievable, this movie grabs me and makes me pay attention.When this movie is on I have to watch it.So, it's not a good movie by any means, but it is an entertaining and highly engrossing and beautifully shot slideshow of mediocrity that begs to be watched over and over again.No, I don't cry (and you can believe that since I am very open about my emotional instabilities).The film tells the story of a young girl named Samantha who finds herself torn emotionally between her longtime boyfriend Jasper (love that name) and this arrogant preppy kid named Kelley.  When Kelley hits on Sam, Jasper gets mad, they chase each other in cars and then cause Sam's parents diner to blow up and they have to work together to rebuild it.  Sam soon falls in love with Kelley.  Everyone is against it, but when Sam gets sick it becomes apparent that Kelley is all she needs and suddenly everyone is okay with that.Kelley's transformation is highly (and I mean that with complete and total emphasis) unbelievable, but it doesn't matter.  Chris Klein may be a beefycake, but his performances are always void of any real emotion (he's such a pansy of an actor) and so he is very unappealing, but it doesn't matter.Don't ask me why.  I mean, everything about this movie screams for me to pan it (and I kind of have) but I just can't bring myself to hate this movie.  Sobieski is beautifully used here, completely soaking in her character and selling her as a person and not a gimmick (oh, the sick girl...like we haven't seen that before), and Josh Hartnett has always been an actor I found charming and effective in almost every role.Every impulse in my body is fighting between an A grade and an F grade.What can I say?

485271,A9XYVIKIN0IMK,6305962979,"aurileo ""aurileo""","[3, 5]","Yikes!  This movie is a real stinker.  The  script is unbelievably bad - cliche-ridden and just generally awkward and uninspired and bland - no one talks in real life like these people do. The noteworthy thing about ""Here On Earth"" is the number of good actors trapped in it.  Two of the leads, Leelee Sobieski and especially Josh Hartnett, do the best they can, but their characters are unsympathetic (yes, even Hartnett's character, who's sweet but basically not very bright); however as the third member of the love triangle, and ostensibly the ""hero"" of the story, Chris Klein does not remotely possess either the acting skills or the good looks required to pull off his role of a spoiled preppie.  Just the first five minutes of the movie reveal what a bad actor he is here, and if you can make it past that, the scene of him watching his college graduation from afar, while reciting the boring valedictory speech (complete with a Robert Frost quote!) he was supposed to give, will have you laughing out loud at the utter lameness of it (of course this is when Leelee first starts to fall for him - yeah, right...).  On the other hand, the scene of Leelee dancing around the kitchen while making breakfast for her ""new true love"" will have you running for your barf bag.  On the up side, at least it's nice to see actors like Bruce Greenwood, Annette O'Toole and Michael Rooker, but they are completely wasted in this movie, although what little they have to do they do very well.  The three main characters are written so simplistically, they just wind up seeming self-centered, stupid, and totally unworthy of the viewers' interest.  The faux-""Footloose"" score is also annoying.  I would highly recommend NOT buying this movie - it's resemblance to real life is nonexistent, which is ironic given the title.

The film is a replication of every other formula love story: jerk meets girl with decent boyfriend -&gt; falls in love with girl, fights boyfriend -&gt; loses girl forever, old boyfriend not such a bad guy afterall.  The end.That storyline will be found in cinema till the day an asteroid destroys the earth, which in itself is not a bad theme (the lost love etc., not doomsday).  I enjoy a little pathos through mathos, enlightenment through suffering or loss.  But the screenwriters for Here On Earth hardly have the knack to tell a story like the ancient Greek tragedists (See Aeschylus).Josh Hartnett, Lee Lee Sobieski, and Chris Klein provide able performances, but then who couldn't for roles we've all had embedded into our brains by so many other better movies (A Farewell To Arms [1932 ver.], Love Story, etc.).  The trio are trapped in a weak screenplay of cliches and melodramatic scenes that would have made Douglas Sirk proud (Written On The Wind).For those of you who have experienced loss and love together, much of this film may hit close to home.  From this, empathy for the characters' sufferings will give a shared experience to the viewer that can enhance the melancholic enjoyment of the film.  But aside from this, there are few positive notes I can say about Here On Earth, except kudos for these (previously) upcoming actors and Sobieski's ability to imitate Helen Hunt.I only wish an asteroid could have destroyed the vault containing Here On Earth's master reel before it went to video/dvd.",2,"&quot;This movie is so sad!&quot;  Indeed, it is, in every sense.",1023235200,"06 5, 2002",2002,1601,"['was', 'sad', 'day', 'decided', 'sacrifice', 'part', 'day', 'watch', 'Here', 'Earth', 'film', 'replication', 'other', 'formula', 'story', 'jerk', 'meets', 'girl', 'decent', 'boyfriend', 'gt', 'love', 'girl', 'fights', 'boyfriend', 'gt', 'girl', 'forever', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'afterall', 'storyline', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'cinema', 'day', 'asteroid', 'earth', 'not', 'bad', 'theme', 'lost', 'love', 'etc.', 'not', 'doomsday', 'enjoy', 'little', 'pathos', 'mathos', 'enlightenment', 'suffering', 'loss', 'screenwriters', 'Here', 'Earth', 'hardly', 'have', 'knack', 'tell', 'story', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'tragedists', 'See', 'Aeschylus', '.Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Lee', 'Lee', 'Sobieski', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'provide', 'able', 'performances', 'then', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'roles', ""'ve"", 'had', 'embedded', 'brains', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'Farewell', 'Arms', '[', '1932', 'ver', ']', 'Love', 'Story', 'etc.', 'trio', 'are', 'trapped', 'weak', 'screenplay', 'cliches', 'melodramatic', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'proud', 'Written', 'Wind', '.For', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'loss', 'love', 'together', 'much', 'film', 'may', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'empathy', 'characters', 'sufferings', 'will', 'give', 'shared', 'experience', 'viewer', 'can', 'enhance', 'melancholic', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'aside', 'are', 'few', 'positive', 'notes', 'can', 'say', 'Here', 'Earth', 'kudos', 'previously', 'upcoming', 'actors', 'Sobieski', 'ability', 'imitate', 'Helen', 'Hunt.I', 'only', 'wish', 'asteroid', 'could', 'have', 'destroyed', 'vault', 'containing', 'Here', 'Earth', 'master', 'reel', 'went', 'video/dvd']",N/A

The story begins with a rivalry between a group of  prep school boys and local townies that have a reckless car race that ends  up burning down a local diner and gas station.  The judge sentences the two  drivers to a summer of community service rebuilding the diner.  Kelley  (Chris Klein) is a spoiled rich boy with attitude.  Jasper (Josh Hartnett)  is a local hick with a good heart and a bad temper.  Needless to say, the  two boys hate each other.  To complicate matters, Jasper's girlfriend  Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) is developing a serious case of the hots for  Kelley.  They begin an affair complete with dewy looks, running through  fields, stolen glances and every other schmaltzy film technique ever  invented.The prep/townie rivalry escalates into a love triangle with all  the foreseeable showdowns and confrontations.  Just when everyone is  working themselves into a good lather it is discovered that Samantha is  seriously ill.  Pass the Kleenex.The film has some very sweet moments  but the story is far too formulaic and predictable.  It has the feel of a  TV movie, which is not surprising since director Mark Piznarski has mostly  TV projects on his resume.  To his credit, the cinematography was beautiful  and his choice of locations was superb.  The overlook scenes were  particularly lovely.Chris Klein gave an adequate performance, but was  not very dynamic and a little stiff.  I felt that he was much better in  ""American Pie"" playing a more sincere character.  He seems like too nice a  guy to play this spoiled and arrogant rich kid.  Leelee Sobieski was a good  choice for Samantha.  She comes across as very vulnerable and sweet.  She  was adept at capturing the delicate teenage balance between tentativeness  and determination.  I actually liked Josh Hartnett better than I did Klein.  Perhaps he was better suited for his character, but he seemed a lot more  believable as Jasper.This is a great chick flick.  It is sentimental,  romantic, endearing and sad.  Guys are likely to spend most of the movie  writhing in their seats.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very original and  suffered from too many clich&eacute;s.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add one or two points  if you like sentimental romances and another if you like a movie that makes  you cry.

It is far from the greatest of films, but it was touching in many ways. It is rather formulaic, but the formula works here for the most part. A rich upstart teenager comes into a small town and manages to get into a fight with a local and burn down the local diner. In a made-for-television kind of Solomonic wisdom, the judge sentences them to work together to rebuild the diner, Mabel's Table, the 'hot spot' of this whistle-stop town. Rich out-of-towner and local boy fight over the local girl, who has a tragic secret she is concealing.Leelee Sobieski, plays the lead as Samantha, the local girl track star whose knee gave out, jeopardising her chance to go to college. Chris Klein plays Kelley, the spoiled rich kid who is nonetheless intelligent and has a heart he begins to discover during his time in the small town. Josh Hartnett is Jasper, the local boy who wants nothing more than to keep things the way they are, including his relationship with Samantha. Most of these performances are servicable without being stellar; they are typical romantic B-film fare, with many long, ponderous glances overlooking scenic views, and silly situations in which everyday life is shown.The action is slow, but then, it isn't meant to be a fast-paced film. Samantha is torn between the comfortable sameness of her life in the small town with Jasper and her family, and the attraction that rich 'bad boy' Kelley represents, particularly after she learns he does have a heart. Samantha overhears Kelley reciting the valedictory speech he was prevented from delivering because of his sentence to build the diner; Kelley in the end does get to the deliver the speech, under different circumstances.Jasper and Kelley fight (both verbally and physically) over the affections of Samantha, but when Samantha falls ill, they are able to put this aside for her sake. The diner is rebuilt, the town is restored to wholeness, but the situation with Jasper, Kelley and Samantha enters a new dimension, as fate has a different ending in store that none of them anticipated at the beginning of the summer.The other actors in the film are really background for the tale - few stand out, but one who does is Annette O'Toole, who plays Samantha's mother, a role very similar to the one she takes up on 'Smallville' as Clark Kent's mother.The story is gentle, sad, poignant - not terribly original, but very understandable in human terms. Love is unpredictable, and love often hurts. Love sometimes requires a sacrifice. Love can transform you.

At this point, Leelee Sobieski's character was jumping on a bus to go away with Kelley (Chris Klein). Here are some of the things we pointed out: we don't care for Leelee Sobieski's character, whatever happens to her, she is a two-timing bitch. Nor do we care for the fate of the rest of the characters. You can't just jump on a bus without a ticket and no money. You don't just leave your boyfriend there standing on the side of the road.

While not only being highly unrealistic, this movie is boring and heartless, while what the goal obviously was to make the audience really be enthralled and the film be totally emotional. No, the crew has not reached their goal. This has turned out to be a cheese-ball of a film where you don't like the characters and have no sense of sympathy for what happens to them.

At times, the dialogue between Leelee Sobieski and Chris Klein were so corny and outrageous, it almost made me sick. (At one point Klein actually names Sobieski's boobs after two Northeastern states...)I will say that recently, Klein has proven his great acting ability more than once (think ""We Were Soldiers"", ""American Pie"" 1 & 2), but in ""Here on Earth"" his acting was horrendous.I'm sure Sobieski is truly a wonderful person in reality, but so far, I've not found a movie of her's that I've liked. Accept for maybe ""Joy Ride"" which has her in only about 30-40% of the film (great movie, by the way).Josh Hartnett is as fabulous an actor as he's always been, but in this movie, his down to earth, humble, quiet, sensitive character is made out to be nothing more than a jealous, corruptive, possessive boyfriend.If they expect us to believe that Sobieski's character would choose Klein's rich boy ""Kelley"" over Hartnett's small town ""Jasper"", they should have cast someone more lovable than Hartnett to take Klein's place.

485294,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,6305962979,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[3, 9]","Let me begin by giving a quick movie lesson to all of you out there. There are essentially two types of chick flicks. The first kind is very rare and is successful because of its appeal to both sexes. For an example of a chick flick that falls into this category, you may wish to read my review of 'Anywhere But Here' by clicking here.Of course that leaves the other kind of chick flick which are the films which give the genre its name!!! Much to my dismay (being a huge fan of Leelee Sobieski), 'Here on Earth' falls into this category and is quite simply one of the most tedious and unfulfilling features I have come across in recent times.Given my absolute disgust with this title, I shall try to keep my comments brief. In a nutshell, 'Here on Earth' is yet another film aimed at the ever-growing teen audience demographic. The problem lies in the pacing of the feature. It is so slow!!! We are forced to endure countless scenes of adolescent angst during the first two acts of this feature that by the time the third act comes around with its so-called 'surprise' twist (which even a halfwit could guess), the audience just doesn't seem to care. I know my immediate concern at that point was how many more minutes of my life were going to be wasted!!!When I think of the cast which has been assembled by Director Mark Piznarski, I bury my head in shame for all involved. This is the epitome of a wasted opportunity, as many of the cast deserve so much better than this. Whilst Sobieski turns in another fine performance, it is evident from her subtle facial expressions that even she fell prey to boredom throughout the filming of the feature. Personally, I feel that Sobieski has already proved her worth by delivering standout performances in recent features such as 'Roadkill' and 'Uprising'. Seriously, 'Here on Earth' is the type of film which can harm a career and I hope it is the last time we see Sobieski in such a predicament.On the other hand, Chris Klein leaves a lot to be desired. Whilst his performances in 'Election' and the 'American Pie' movies were charismatic, his performance as Kelley Morse is a dud! There is literally no expression on his face 90% of the time and the chemistry between Sobieski and him is 100% non-existent. There is one particular scene which will have you cringing in embarrassment (and which I am sure Klein will regret for the rest of his life) and that is a scene where Klein is attempting to dance in a barn.Josh Hartnett and Bruce Greenwood also feature in 'Here on Earth' and are further examples of wasted talent. Hartnett does his best to inject some life into his character, and succeeds as best as he can given the confines of the script. Greenwood on the other hand, a screen veteran, has no business dabbling in teen cinema and it is an embaressment to see him lower his standards for this feature.At the end of the day, I really could not find anything redeeming about 'Here on Earth' and therefore cannot recommend this DVD outside its core demographic, i.e. teenage girls.",1,tedious and unfulfilling,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,3036,"['Let', 'begin', 'giving', 'quick', 'movie', 'lesson', 'there', 'are', 'essentially', 'two', 'types', 'chick', 'flicks', 'first', 'kind', 'very', 'rare', 'successful', 'appeal', 'sexes', 'example', 'chick', 'flick', 'category', 'may', 'wish', 'read', 'review', ""'Anywhere"", 'Here', 'clicking', 'here.Of', 'course', 'other', 'kind', 'chick', 'flick', 'are', 'films', 'give', 'genre', 'name', 'Much', 'dismay', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', ""'Here"", 'Earth', 'category', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'most', 'tedious', 'unfulfilling', 'features', 'have', 'come', 'recent', 'times.Given', 'absolute', 'disgust', 'title', 'shall', 'try', 'keep', 'comments', 'brief', 'nutshell', ""'Here"", 'Earth', 'yet', 'film', 'aimed', 'ever-growing', 'teen', 'audience', 'demographic', 'problem', 'pacing', 'feature', 'so', 'slow', 'are', 'forced', 'endure', 'countless', 'scenes', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'feature', 'time', 'third', 'act', 'around', 'so-called', ""'surprise"", 'twist', 'even', 'halfwit', 'could', 'guess', 'audience', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'know', 'immediate', 'concern', 'point', 'was', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'minutes', 'life', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'wasted', 'When', 'think', 'cast', 'been', 'assembled', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Piznarski', 'bury', 'head', 'shame', 'involved', 'epitome', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'many', 'cast', 'deserve', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Whilst', 'Sobieski', 'fine', 'performance', 'evident', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'even', 'fell', 'prey', 'boredom', 'filming', 'feature', 'Personally', 'feel', 'Sobieski', 'already', 'proved', 'worth', 'delivering', 'standout', 'performances', 'recent', 'features', 'such', ""'Roadkill"", ""'Uprising"", 'Seriously', 'Earth', 'type', 'film', 'can', 'harm', 'career', 'hope', 'last', 'time', 'see', 'Sobieski', 'such', 'predicament.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Whilst', 'performances', ""'Election"", ""'American"", 'Pie', 'movies', 'were', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'Kelley', 'Morse', 'dud', 'literally', 'expression', 'face', '90', '%', 'time', 'chemistry', 'Sobieski', '100', '%', 'non-existent', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'cringing', 'embarrassment', 'am', 'sure', 'Klein', 'will', 'regret', 'rest', 'life', 'scene', 'where', 'Klein', 'attempting', 'dance', 'barn.Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'also', 'feature', ""'Here"", 'Earth', 'are', 'further', 'examples', 'wasted', 'talent', 'Hartnett', 'best', 'inject', 'life', 'character', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'given', 'confines', 'script', 'Greenwood', 'other', 'hand', 'screen', 'veteran', 'business', 'dabbling', 'teen', 'cinema', 'embaressment', 'see', 'lower', 'standards', 'end', 'day', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'redeeming', ""'Here"", 'Earth', 'therefore', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'core', 'demographic', 'i.e', 'teenage', 'girls']",N/A

It was a good movie though it's directed more to a younger audience.  Nevertheless, if you're not that young you're bound to flashback to a time when love was so good it hurt and it was sweet, innocent, and pure.Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein are incredibly breathtaking in this movie.  They are two visually agreeable young men with whom I have no problem looking at when a scene demands that they not wear clothing.Lee Lee Sobeiski does well in this lead role.  She's portrayed as a young unspoiled and carefree young lady who's into poetry and love.  She looks so ""innocently gorgeous"" in this movie where I could've sworn I could see a faint golden light radiate from her face and actually seep through her persona.  She's awesome.  Although, I did question her acting at times.  She seemed to mumble her lines more than actually say them with emotion.  She meets up with Klein's character almost by a tragic accident when he's forced to live in a town where his ""rich"" kind isn't welcomed.  He's got tension with Harnett's character because after all he is charming the pants off his girlfriend (Sobeiski).  I thought it was a great story! Whose heart hasn't been torn in half by the possibility of loving two people at the same time?  The ending is very sad.  But, it's clear to everyone that a love so great can never be pushed away no matter how much it hurts it's needed.They kept mentioning a poet throughout the movie of which I would like get a hold of his poetry.  It's simply beautiful.  You'll hear his poems mentioned from beginning to end. My favorite quote said something like this ""Wouldn't you like to leave Earth for a couple of moments and then return to start all over again?"" Yes, I would.This movie hits all of the passion that we felt and had as teenagers.  Pure innocent love hitting you directly in your heart.

Uh-oh!This movie is a big disappointment because it fails to capitalize on a relatively talented cast and a pseudo-inspiring story.  Rather than developing characters instead of caricatures, the filmmakers opted for the easy, fast cash route.  As a result, the dialogue seems to be spun from a 13 year old's soap opera fantasy, befitting of the target audience I suppose.

That is not the reason why I was so bothered by this movie. The insidious and corrupted moral compass portrayed by this movie is what bothers me so much.We have a loving, kind, and loyal boyfriend (Josh Hartnett), who gets sidelined by the female lead (Leelee Sobieski) as soon as a rich, rude, arrogant, and selfish hot guy (Chris Klein) shows up and takes off his shirt. Really? Yes, in real-life people can be very shallow, but do we need to have that kind of shallow-minded motivation as the main driving force of a movie?While the movie tries to portray the rich kid as some kind of wounded, soulful Romeo, but simply having him losing a mother and memorizing a Robert Frost poem is not enough to excuse his on-going appalling behavior. Throughout the movie, he is arrogant and selfish and rude, flaunts his wealth and looks down on others, and then burns down the female lead's family restaurant. Not once did he apologize for it or show any remorse, yet the female lead falls for him anyway. In the meantime, the loving and loyal boyfriend who's a far better human being continues to try to get the female lead to come to her senses, but she never does.Yes, they say love is blind, but when a movie has no moral compass, it's not only blind but also irresponsible.",2,Where is the moral compass?,967939200,"09 3, 2000",2000,1437,"['Mainstream', 'romance', 'movies', 'often', 'get', 'criticized', 'being', 'formulaic', 'melodramatic', 'easy', 'intelligent', 'person', 'rip', 'apart', 'make', 'fun', 'not', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'bothered', 'movie', 'insidious', 'corrupted', 'moral', 'compass', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'what', 'bothers', 'so', 'much.We', 'have', 'loving', 'kind', 'loyal', 'boyfriend', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'sidelined', 'female', 'lead', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'as', 'soon', 'rich', 'rude', 'arrogant', 'selfish', 'hot', 'guy', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'up', 'off', 'shirt', 'Really', 'Yes', 'real-life', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'shallow', 'do', 'need', 'have', 'kind', 'shallow-minded', 'motivation', 'main', 'driving', 'force', 'movie', 'movie', 'portray', 'rich', 'kid', 'kind', 'wounded', 'soulful', 'Romeo', 'simply', 'having', 'losing', 'mother', 'memorizing', 'Robert', 'Frost', 'poem', 'not', 'enough', 'excuse', 'on-going', 'appalling', 'behavior', 'movie', 'arrogant', 'selfish', 'rude', 'wealth', 'down', 'others', 'then', 'down', 'female', 'lead', 'family', 'restaurant', 'Not', 'once', 'did', 'apologize', 'show', 'remorse', 'female', 'lead', 'falls', 'anyway', 'meantime', 'loving', 'loyal', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'far', 'better', 'human', 'being', 'try', 'get', 'female', 'lead', 'come', 'senses', 'never', 'does.Yes', 'say', 'love', 'blind', 'when', 'movie', 'moral', 'compass', 'not', 'only', 'blind', 'also', 'irresponsible']",N/A

The movie is about a girl who works at a diner, and her long time friend who is always there for her.  Enter a high school boy who comes from a highly sophisticated world of  money and likeliness. An accident forces the wealthy kid(played by Chris  Klien) to stay and help repair the accident, along with Sams best friend  Jasper(played by Josh Hartnett). Both are attracted to Sam(played by Leelee  Sobieski), but during the halfway point of the movie, Sam realizes that her  time on earth is but short. Her parents watch out for her, and Jasper does  too. Sam has an instant attraction to Kelley(Chris Klien), and so does he  for her. Drama ensues between the two boys and Sam is trying to cope with  her illness she is facing while not giving up so easily as others do. She  lives her life to the fullest and the line that can get to you is when she  says &quot;some people live their whole life and never fall in love. And  i've lived my life, and I fell in love&quot;. In the end, when all is said  and done, the viewer will realize just how precious life can be and just to  enjoy your life, before your time on earth is gone forever.

485313,A5CWLQF6QO3CN,6305962979,"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","[2, 2]","Here on Earth got a good cast - Chris Klein (American Pie), Leelee Sobieski (Never Been Kissed) and Josh Hartnett (The Faculty). All of them are good young actors for the young generation. The story could be good - a triangular love romance that could be very interesting. However, the movie per se is not satisfactory at all.The worst part of the movie is that, the story is too predictable, you could know what would happen right from the beginning. There are no surprises that could attract the attention of the audience. You could imagine what comes next and next and next. This would definitely kill the interest of the audience. Also, the plot is too shallow. There is no detail description of the relationships among various characters in the movie. Also, turns of relationships are so sudden that it just made things look awkward in the story. Should there be more description of each of the major characters, and a better plot for the story, it could be a real good hit.Chris Klein is gorgeous as always, which fits his role as the rich Kelley. However, the director has put too much emphasis on his surface beauty, putting him in different occasions of nudity to attract female fans, which is pretty bad in fact. Should there be more real acting for him, he could do a better job. Also, his poem reciting is not that convincing at the beginning but he did managed to do it much much better at the end of the movie. He has a real touching voice in that part.Leelee Sobieski, though said to be the leading actress, was not given enough opportunity to make a good show out of it. Her character was modelled to be attitude shifting, wavering and emotional, but the worst was that they all came suddenly. Audience could predict the changes, but they director need not to be so economical about the details and the background reasonings. Leelee had worked hard in her role, but since the character creation had a natural deificiency, she could not do much about it.Josh Hartnett, as Jasper, the boyfriend of Samantha (Leelee) was a pretty good character. He could be understood as the more reasonable character and more developed character in the movie. He had a great love for Samantha and made himself readily available whenever Samantha needed him. He was also rational enough to understand Samantha's feelings. Josh's performance is also very promising.The movie had a lot of good scenery screening, which is a credit to the movie.
