I was in fact tempted to shut it off, but I paid for the thing so I was determined to watch it. I'm glad I did. The synopsis of the film is a young gay couple approaching their third anniversary, one still madly in love and the other very confused. Ryan decides to break up with his mate Joel, and explore a  relationship with a new friend with whom he shares a lot of things in common. He is in search of someone to share the little magical world that exists only in his mind. But will his new friend feel the same way he does, or will their own little worlds collide? At that moment this was a mediocre film, but then something magical happens. The scenario plays out as if you are watching the end of the movie. All of sudden, as you expect the story to end, the film starts over at the moment Ryan moves out of Joels apartment, and begins going in a totally different direction from what you just seen. I was thinking: ""ok, that was a fantasy, now we're seeing what really happens"". As it plays out however, it all goes back once again to Ryan leaving Joels apartment and yet another scenario begins to play out as Ryan drifts in thought to explore several fantsies trying to find one that would best explain his real dream in life. As you watch this film, you will surely find one ending you like. All in all, the only thing he discovers is that in any scenario, his lover Joel is steadfast and loves him unconditionally. This is an indie of course so the quality could have been better, but all in all, even on the VHS copy I have, it wasn't too horrible. I would recommend it on DVD however for best picture and sound quality. The casting was great and the acting was superb. I was quite impressed once the whole production began to take off. Don't get in a hurry to shut it off and discount it as a failure. It really does make a strong point and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I will want to see this again and again now that I have some sense of what is going on. Ryan's little world is a really twisted place with a lot of darkness in it. Way too much darkness for me personally, but in the end, it is as if this adult man is finally coming of age so to speak after he has already experienced life. If you give it a chance, you will get something out of this film. I recommend it, but at first I already had my review in mind for only one star. A slow start, but a nice save by Canadian filmmaker Quentin Lee.

T. Lee as Ryan, a mid-20s screenwriter/ coffee shop worker.  Ryan is within days of his third anniversary living with Joel (played by Greyson Dayne), a worker in a gay community center.  Having dragged Joel to a cocktail party, Ryan meets Leo (played by Jonathon Roessler), a younger college student who turns out to share Ryan's interest in serial killers and horror movies.  Ryan soon is thinking that, although Joel is comfortable and a good provider, Leo is the one who understands what Ryan is all about and could be his true soulmate.Ryan decides the honorable thing to do is move out of the apartment until he sorts out what to do.  Luckily Ryan has friends, one a straight man and the other a woman, who volunteer to help him out.  After moving out, Ryan wants to get closer to Leo, and Joel gets to try out his own options.  Leo meanwhile casts an eye on Joel.  Old loves might not be dead loves either.Ryan realizes he is generating a mess for a lot of people as he drifts along but doesn't have much perspective until he tricks with a character who finds some of the right words.  The movie goes on to its conclusion.The basic story with its emotional tangles has promise.  The difficulties I had came from the script or from the acting.  The film focuses on Ryan, leaving the other characters less developed.  Why had Ryan and Joel stayed together for so long?  Why would low-income Ryan decide so quickly to leave an apartment he didn't even pay rent on without first having a secure long-term landing spot?  Why would there be no thought to the economic impact on low/mid-income Joel?  Some speeches are deliberately recycled, sometimes to telling effect (especially one asking serially for devirginization; some live life as a script). The viewer can go along with most of the words, although the portrayals of some of the emotions may lack conviction.I liked the pithy reflections Ryan had on himself as he walked away from his last trick.  He later concludes with a sentiment that the key to happiness was living a life without regret.  The audience will have to weigh this with all the emotional damage done to self and others and with what Ryan's final situation is.",2,Swinging Love Triangle,1022284800,"05 25, 2002",2002,2358,"['Drift', 'small', 'scale', 'intimate', 'gay', 'relationship', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Quentin', 'Lee', 'produced', 'Canadian', 'funding.Set', 'contemporary', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Drift', 'stars', 'R.', 'T.', 'Lee', 'Ryan', 'mid-20s', 'screenwriter/', 'coffee', 'shop', 'worker', 'Ryan', 'days', 'third', 'anniversary', 'living', 'Joel', 'played', 'Greyson', 'Dayne', 'worker', 'gay', 'community', 'center', 'Having', 'dragged', 'Joel', 'cocktail', 'party', 'Ryan', 'Leo', 'played', 'Jonathon', 'Roessler', 'younger', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'out', 'share', 'Ryan', 'interest', 'serial', 'killers', 'horror', 'movies', 'Ryan', 'soon', 'thinking', 'Joel', 'comfortable', 'good', 'provider', 'Leo', 'one', 'who', 'what', 'Ryan', 'could', 'be', 'true', 'soulmate.Ryan', 'honorable', 'thing', 'do', 'move', 'apartment', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'Luckily', 'Ryan', 'friends', 'one', 'straight', 'man', 'other', 'woman', 'who', 'volunteer', 'help', 'out', 'moving', 'out', 'Ryan', 'get', 'closer', 'Leo', 'Joel', 'try', 'out', 'own', 'options', 'Leo', 'meanwhile', 'eye', 'Joel', 'Old', 'loves', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'dead', 'loves', 'either.Ryan', 'realizes', 'generating', 'mess', 'lot', 'people', 'along', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'perspective', 'character', 'who', 'right', 'words', 'movie', 'conclusion.The', 'basic', 'story', 'emotional', 'tangles', 'promise', 'difficulties', 'had', 'came', 'script', 'acting', 'film', 'Ryan', 'leaving', 'other', 'characters', 'less', 'developed', 'Why', 'had', 'Ryan', 'Joel', 'stayed', 'together', 'so', 'long', 'Why', 'would', 'low-income', 'Ryan', 'decide', 'so', 'quickly', 'leave', 'apartment', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'pay', 'rent', 'first', 'having', 'secure', 'long-term', 'landing', 'spot', 'Why', 'would', 'there', 'be', 'thought', 'economic', 'impact', 'low/mid-income', 'Joel', 'speeches', 'are', 'deliberately', 'recycled', 'sometimes', 'telling', 'effect', 'especially', 'one', 'asking', 'serially', 'devirginization', 'live', 'life', 'script', 'viewer', 'can', 'go', 'along', 'most', 'words', 'portrayals', 'emotions', 'may', 'lack', 'conviction.I', 'liked', 'pithy', 'reflections', 'Ryan', 'had', 'walked', 'away', 'last', 'trick', 'later', 'sentiment', 'key', 'happiness', 'was', 'living', 'life', 'regret', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'weigh', 'emotional', 'damage', 'done', 'self', 'others', 'what', 'Ryan', 'final', 'situation']",N/A

695360,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000063K0A,James Hiller,"[4, 8]","Quentin Lee's highly interesting latest cinematic work, ""Drift"" allows us to explore within the realms of reality the answer to ""what might have happened if...."", and to see their interesting and often surprising results.The protagonist, Ryan, meets potential soulmate Leo at a party one evening. The hurdle? Ryan's boyfriend Joel, who together are approaching their third anniversary. Ryan is then forced to stand on a very narrow ledge, to make a terribly difficult decision: what to do about this new, intriguing ingredient thrown into his life. The rest of the movie plays out the different scenarios, each one coming to a surprise ending, of sorts.What marvels in this movie are two aspects. First, the acting is superb. It is so understated, that you really do believe Quentin Lee set cameras up in people's homes, left, and just filmed reality. All of the actor's inhabit their roles realitisically, especially Leo, played by Jonathon Roessler, who's role as ""the other man"" is so subtle you don't mind him getting involved with Ryan. Secondly, the script and story treat each scenario with respect and reverence. There is no cheap humor, or overdrought drama. Each scene is played with the correct tension, making for pleasant, intrguing viewing.One flaw I found involved the use of the camera. I noticed from the beginning that camera seemed to be uncomfortably close to the actors. Throughout the movie, we see an unusual amount of close ups, and one shots. While it may have been the director's decision to isolate characters on the screen to emphasize their individuality, or possibly true aloneness in this world, I found it becoming distracting. Some of the scenes would have been better served with the camera farther away, to allow distance between us and the characters.At any rate, I did enjoy Drift.

I'm not attracted to most of the cinematic drivel that mainstream film companies produce. But... this was one of the worst Indie films I've ever watched. Unfortunately, being a diehard Indie fan, I bought it rather than renting it. Anyone want to buy a copy? Cheap?Technically, it would rate about three stars, but the characters are two dimensional and exceptionally boring. The central character, Ryan, is so pretentious (no one understands him on a ""visceral"" level) that I hated him after the first five minutes. Seldom am I moved to actually hate a film's characters. Maybe that was the director's intention, and if it had been only that character and you could sympathize with the others, it would have been a good thing. However, it doesn't work out that way.The new love interest, while not inspiring the same degree of loathing, is a pretentious novel-writing effeminate virgin. The very much put upon boyfriend, Joel, acts as though he has no depth of emotion beyond superficial fretting that Ryan is going to break up with him after three years together.The two supposedly straight supporting characters are also shallow and vapid as a flat beer - Ryan's guy friend does little more than talk about his high school girlfriend that got away and lift weights. In what might have been the film's best moments, Ryan asks him if he would sleep with him and cuddle and mess around and the straight friend says of course he would if it would make him feel better and says that that's love of a kind, isn't it? Ryan responds in the fashion we have come to expect by that point - with about as much emotional depth as an eggplant (my apologies to the veggie kingdom) - and the film's one actual moment of emotion is over.Indie films about gay characters have advanced tremendously in their ability to portray them as just average people with average problems. This one doesn't. It's hard to put your finger on, but maybe it's the fact that not one of these people is someone you'd really like to know once you've met them. I don't know what the director's intention was, but if he set out to portray his gay characters as shallow and unlikeable, he succeeded admirably.Don't bother with this one, folks. If you must watch it, rent it.
