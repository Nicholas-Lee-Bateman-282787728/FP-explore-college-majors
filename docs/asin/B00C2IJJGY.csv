1641519,A1ESJN9F9JUVIH,B00C2IJJGY,Adam Love,"[15, 15]","Bill Owen's last season ends with a poignant special called ""Last Pigeon and Post"".  He would not live to participate in Season 21.Bill insisted on trying to complete all filming.  In fact, he was not able to complete all the filming for the final special.  The producers of the show were forced to use his double for some scenes and to electronically drop his image into some others.  I think they did a seamless job.Some of the most touching images in the show feature a frail Compo sitting alone and looking completely disheartened.  The extreme close-ups of Bill Owen's eyes illustrate just how ill the actor was at this point.Compo's friends and neighbors take up a collection to send him on a vacation to France, to re-visit the country where he served in WWII.  The whole cast show ups to cheer him on his way.  He even gets an  unsolicited farewell kiss from Nora Batty!In France, compo searches through the country side, looking for the spot where he and his buddies were penned down by the Germans.  Once there, Compo takes out his bugle and plays ""Last Post"", the U.K. military's equivalent of the U.S. military's ""Taps"" in remembrance of his comrades of long ago.No one who loves this show will be able to watch Bill Owen's farewell performance with dry eyes.I think you will enjoy this vocal version of the Last of the Summer Wine theme:[...](If the line above does not display as a link, just copy it and paste it into your web address line.)Here is a listing of the DVD contents:DISC 1:1.
