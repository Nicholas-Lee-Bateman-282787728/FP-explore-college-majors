I was laughing so hard that I had two pillows over my mouth as so I would not wake up my wife and kids ! There are some low foul parts that really didn't have to be in this movie but most of it will keep you in stitches. The Grandmother and many of her comments and questions are priceless. Lainie Kazan was 10 times better in this movie then the Greek Wedding ( She was perfect in her part as the &quot;Past the flower of her life&quot; mother still trying to hold on, her efforts were Oscar worthy ! This is one movie that will really make you laugh. The daughter played by A. Jolean was as always worthless as the son wasn't much either,but is was the parents that made the show. Being born and raised in East Baltimore City and growing up around a lot of ethnic folks ,this picture stays true to the core.

Being Italian-American from the northeast I really appreciated the humor and the characters. This film features a very young Angelina Jolie. Not sure but I wouldn't be surprised if it was her first film. This was kind of like a modern day, Italian-American Romeo and Juliet full of laughs.

784751,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0000V492Y,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","This comic reworking of the ""Romeo & Juliet"" tale set amid Italian weddings will be remembered as Angelina Jolie's first film.  Shot in 1994 and released in 1996, ""Love Is All There Is"" is a fairly funny little romp.  Jolie's career of course skyrocketed with her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Girl Interrupted"" in 2000 and went on to ""Alexander,"" ""Taking Lives,"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" & ""Beyond Borders.""  She's set to star next year with Robert DeNiro & Matt Damon in ""The Good Shepard.""  As Gina Malacici, she takes over in the local community theatre production when the fat Juliet falls off the balcony and breaks her leg.  TV soap opera star Nathaniel Marston plays Rosario Cappamezza who is the Romeo.  Hormones kick into full gear for the two and the final scene in the play where Romeo kisses the dead Juliet turns into a major make-out, leaving the dead Romeo with a giant erection.  Joseph Bologna as father Mike is suffiently embarrased as is his wife Sadie played by Lanie Kazan who went on to star in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""  Bologna also served as co-director for the film with his wife Renee Taylor and had his lone Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for 1970's ""Lovers & Other Strangers.""  Paul Sorvino who played Henry Kissinger in the 1995 film ""Nixon"" plays Count Malacici who is a rival caterer to Cappamezza's.  Thrown into the mix is co-director Renee Taylor who was in the 2004 version of ""Alfie"" as the nutty psychic Mona who prescribes candle dolls with erections to enhance Mike & Sadie's love life.  Nicaraguan/American actress Barbara Carrera who was Fatima Blush in the 1983 James Bond film ""Never Say Never Again"" plays the mother of the bride, balancing decorum with a vengeful temper.  Dick Van Patton and TV's ""Hawaiian Eye"" Connie Stevens have a silly scene as an older couple having an affair in a parking lot.  The late William Hickey whose lone Oscar nomination was for ""Prizzi's Honor"" and also played in the gay Oliver Twist film ""Twisted"" is the Monsignor who pontificates lightly over the weddings.  ""Love Is All There Is"" does have its share of laughs and the young lovers appear to spark with good romantic chemistry.  All in all, this is a good watching experience.
