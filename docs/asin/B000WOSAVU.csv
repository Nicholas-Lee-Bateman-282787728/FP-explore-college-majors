This compilation of 10-minute ab workouts are all useful for different needs.ABsolutely Beautiful w/ Rob Glick-Although the name is cheesy, this is a very good workout.  Rob starts off by just doing basic crunches which he eventually builds into intense crunches with your feet and knees in the air.  After he works out your core for about 6-7 minutes, he then moves on to back work before finishing the workout with planks.ABsession w/ Violet Zaki-Violet starts off with a great warm up as she does 6-count crunches coming up then 2-counts for going back down.  She eventually moves into some faster crunches before moving into some fun ab exercises such as rolling like a ball.  She then finishes up with some planks.Expresso Abs w/ Gay Gasper-This was the most intense core workout of the bunch and my personal favorite.  She starts off with some easy roll-downs, but then Gay does so many crunches, oblique crunches, pulses, and more that it makes the abs BURN!  She then does some planks, but these are easier than those of other trainers.  She finishes off with a 1-2 minute stretching time.  Now, the other trainers stretch at the end of their workouts, too, but Gay is the only one that has a very nice stretch ending.Core Blast w/ Kimberly Spreen-This was the easiest routine in the bunch and my personal least favorite.  Although Kimberly is very pleasant, her exercises were TOO easy, and I didn't feel them the next day.  She does some side planks and some more oblique work on your side before going to roll-downs and roll-ups.  She then finishes with some hip bridges.  This workout focuses more on the obliques, and I thought it was better for beginner exercisers.Peak Performance w/ Kendell Hogan-Kendell's workout requires two hand weights, and I found his routine to be more overall strength compared to just abs.  He does some lunges forward with twists before going to the floor for some crunches and side planks.  He finishes off with supermans.These 10-minute workouts are great for getting your core in shape in just a little time.  I enjoyed the diversity of the trainers and it led me to buy more in the ""Star Trainers"" series.",5,A variety of ab workouts,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2314,"['great', 'thing', 'Star', 'Trainer', 'series', 'get', '5', 'workouts', 'different', 'trainers', 'who', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'things', 'make', 'workout', 'unique', 'compilation', '10-minute', 'ab', 'workouts', 'are', 'useful', 'different', 'needs.ABsolutely', 'Beautiful', 'w/', 'Rob', 'Glick-Although', 'name', 'cheesy', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'Rob', 'off', 'just', 'doing', 'basic', 'crunches', 'eventually', 'intense', 'crunches', 'feet', 'knees', 'air', 'out', 'core', '6-7', 'minutes', 'then', 'back', 'work', 'finishing', 'workout', 'planks.ABsession', 'w/', 'Violet', 'Zaki-Violet', 'great', 'warm', 'up', '6-count', 'crunches', 'coming', 'up', 'then', '2-counts', 'going', 'back', 'down', 'eventually', 'faster', 'crunches', 'moving', 'fun', 'ab', 'exercises', 'such', 'rolling', 'ball', 'then', 'up', 'planks.Expresso', 'Abs', 'w/', 'Gay', 'Gasper-This', 'was', 'most', 'intense', 'core', 'workout', 'bunch', 'personal', 'favorite', 'easy', 'roll-downs', 'then', 'Gay', 'so', 'many', 'crunches', 'oblique', 'crunches', 'pulses', 'more', 'abs', 'BURN', 'then', 'planks', 'are', 'easier', 'other', 'trainers', '1-2', 'minute', 'stretching', 'time', 'Now', 'other', 'trainers', 'stretch', 'end', 'workouts', 'too', 'Gay', 'only', 'one', 'very', 'nice', 'stretch', 'Blast', 'w/', 'Kimberly', 'Spreen-This', 'was', 'easiest', 'routine', 'bunch', 'personal', 'least', 'favorite', 'Kimberly', 'very', 'pleasant', 'exercises', 'were', 'TOO', 'easy', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'next', 'day', 'side', 'planks', 'more', 'oblique', 'work', 'side', 'going', 'roll-downs', 'roll-ups', 'then', 'hip', 'bridges', 'workout', 'more', 'obliques', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'beginner', 'exercisers.Peak', 'Performance', 'w/', 'Kendell', 'Hogan-Kendell', 'workout', 'two', 'hand', 'weights', 'found', 'routine', 'be', 'more', 'overall', 'strength', 'compared', 'just', 'abs', 'lunges', 'forward', 'twists', 'going', 'floor', 'crunches', 'side', 'planks', 'supermans.These', '10-minute', 'workouts', 'are', 'great', 'getting', 'core', 'shape', 'just', 'little', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'diversity', 'trainers', 'led', 'buy', 'more', 'Star', 'Trainers', 'series']",Star Trainers

I am by no means in great shape in my abdominal area, but unless it's a tough workout, I really don't feel like I'm even doing any good.  I love Tamilee Webb's I Want that Body, but since there are only 2 ab sections on that DVD, I need a change up.  I saw in another review that this one was as good as Tamilee Webb's so I decided to try it.  I am not dissapointed.  This DVD does live up to the reivews it's been given.  The intros by the trainers at the beginning of each section is a little annoying but I just fast forward through it and I'm fine.  I found that Violet and Kendall's routine were probably the least challenging (although by no means easy).  I usually pair those with one of the other trainers routines to get a good 20 minute ab workout.  If all of the other Star Trainers DVDs are this good I think I'll buy them all!",5,Great DVD!,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,889,"['am', 'always', 'lookout', 'hard', 'AB', 'workouts', 'am', 'means', 'great', 'shape', 'abdominal', 'area', 'tough', 'workout', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'m"", 'even', 'doing', 'good', 'love', 'Tamilee', 'Webb', 'Want', 'Body', 'are', 'only', '2', 'ab', 'sections', 'DVD', 'need', 'change', 'up', 'saw', 'review', 'one', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Tamilee', 'Webb', 'so', 'decided', 'try', 'am', 'not', 'dissapointed', 'DVD', 'live', 'reivews', 'been', 'given', 'intros', 'trainers', 'beginning', 'section', 'little', 'annoying', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', ""'m"", 'fine', 'found', 'Violet', 'Kendall', 'routine', 'were', 'probably', 'least', 'challenging', 'means', 'easy', 'usually', 'pair', 'one', 'other', 'trainers', 'routines', 'get', 'good', '20', 'minute', 'ab', 'workout', 'other', 'Star', 'Trainers', 'DVDs', 'are', 'good', 'think', ""'ll"", 'buy']",Star Trainers
1111031,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B000WOSAVU,Jenny G,"[1, 2]","Red Panda has done a great job of breaking out what is included in each of the segments, so I won't repeat all of that.I do a variety of ab routines.  Usually something like Core Fusion on Tuesday, Squeeze Stronger on Sunday, mix it up on Friday. I used to do more traditional ab routines, but found they weren't as effective.  In comparing single 10-minute segments, I find that this DVD is not as intense from a purely ab perspective as the other DVDs I use.  This is partly because of the variety that is mixed into this DVD.  Where the other routines I use are pure abs for 10 minutes, this one mixes in other exercises as well. This isn't a bad thing really, as I also do planks and back extension work on a regular basis in addition to those other DVDs, where this DVD has segments that combine that all into one. However, this DVD is also not as intense for me because the actual exercises they do to work the abs are not as intense either (at least for me).  So I can do a single segment with more impact from the other DVDs.  But having said that, this is still a very good DVD and I do use it on a fairly regular basis to provide some nice variety. I really like to tackle the abs with a variety of exercises.The main reason I have rated this DVD as a 4 instead of a 5 is the annoying intros at the beginning of the segments. Even if I use the menu to create a custom workout, I still have to fast forward through the intro.Rob Glick is my favorite routine as I like his combination of abs, planks, and back extension work.  I do all of these on a regular basis, and this is a nice routine that combines them all.  When I use this DVD I will frequently start with Rob's routine and then add in one other segment.I also really like Gay Gasper's routine and from an ab perspective think it is the most difficult one on the DVD.  I will use it frequently in combination with Robs, sometimes leaving the additional planks off of Gay's if I'm in a hurry.I also will mix Violet's routine in with Rob's from time to time.  The ab routine isn't quite as challenging as Gay's but I really like the bird dogs.I don't use Kendell Hogan's routine very often as I don't combine abs and lower body work on the same day.  I do a very thorough lower body workout on alternate days, including lunges and squats, and want to give my body a break from that on my ab days. The ab work during this session is fairly easy but his side plank combo is very nice.I have not used Kimberly Spreen's routine. The side crunches with weight on one knee look like something that might bother my sensitive left knee so I have avoided it.",4,Nice variety,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,2615,"['Red', 'Panda', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'breaking', 'out', 'what', 'included', 'segments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'that.I', 'do', 'variety', 'ab', 'routines', 'Usually', 'something', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'Tuesday', 'Squeeze', 'Stronger', 'Sunday', 'mix', 'up', 'Friday', 'used', 'do', 'more', 'traditional', 'ab', 'routines', 'found', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'effective', 'comparing', 'single', '10-minute', 'segments', 'find', 'DVD', 'not', 'intense', 'purely', 'ab', 'perspective', 'other', 'DVDs', 'use', 'partly', 'variety', 'mixed', 'DVD', 'Where', 'other', 'routines', 'use', 'are', 'pure', 'abs', '10', 'minutes', 'one', 'mixes', 'other', 'exercises', 'well', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'really', 'also', 'do', 'planks', 'back', 'extension', 'work', 'regular', 'basis', 'addition', 'other', 'DVDs', 'where', 'DVD', 'segments', 'combine', 'one', 'However', 'DVD', 'also', 'not', 'intense', 'actual', 'exercises', 'do', 'work', 'abs', 'are', 'not', 'intense', 'least', 'can', 'do', 'single', 'segment', 'more', 'impact', 'other', 'DVDs', 'having', 'said', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'do', 'use', 'fairly', 'regular', 'basis', 'provide', 'nice', 'variety', 'really', 'tackle', 'abs', 'variety', 'exercises.The', 'main', 'reason', 'have', 'rated', 'DVD', '4', 'instead', '5', 'annoying', 'intros', 'beginning', 'segments', 'Even', 'use', 'menu', 'create', 'custom', 'workout', 'still', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'intro.Rob', 'Glick', 'favorite', 'routine', 'combination', 'abs', 'planks', 'back', 'extension', 'work', 'do', 'regular', 'basis', 'nice', 'routine', 'When', 'use', 'DVD', 'will', 'frequently', 'start', 'Rob', 'routine', 'then', 'add', 'one', 'other', 'segment.I', 'also', 'really', 'Gay', 'Gasper', 'routine', 'ab', 'perspective', 'think', 'most', 'difficult', 'one', 'DVD', 'will', 'use', 'frequently', 'combination', 'Robs', 'sometimes', 'leaving', 'additional', 'planks', 'Gay', ""'m"", 'hurry.I', 'also', 'will', 'mix', 'Violet', 'routine', 'Rob', 'time', 'time', 'ab', 'routine', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'challenging', 'Gay', 'really', 'bird', 'dogs.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'Kendell', 'Hogan', 'routine', 'very', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'combine', 'abs', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'same', 'day', 'do', 'very', 'thorough', 'lower', 'body', 'workout', 'alternate', 'days', 'including', 'lunges', 'squats', 'want', 'give', 'body', 'break', 'ab', 'days', 'ab', 'work', 'session', 'fairly', 'easy', 'side', 'plank', 'combo', 'very', 'nice.I', 'have', 'not', 'used', 'Kimberly', 'Spreen', 'routine', 'side', 'weight', 'one', 'knee', 'look', 'something', 'might', 'bother', 'sensitive', 'left', 'knee', 'have', 'avoided']",Star Trainers

There is Rob Glick, Gaye Gasper, Violet Zaki, Kimberly Spreen and Kendell Hogan.  They are all terrific and motivating and know what they're talking about.There are regular types of moves like plank work and crunches etc, but also some good standing work like lunges with rotations.  Those may not always feel at the time like they're doing much, but trust me, they are.  I tried to do the entire dvd in one go, but I couldn't even do it and I'm fairly experienced and fit.  You can easily do two to three at a time and get great benefits.  That's another reason I love this dvd; because you can do half an hour of abs in different order than yesterday or tomorrow and that makes it less boring.If you are going to consider buying this, get their cardio dvd too and put them together.
