It may seem dissapointing for those who want to know more about these side characters. But this show is not about them it's a love story between two people and status is the enemy.

1137579,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B0012K53K4,Kellyannl,"[19, 19]","If the typical shounen series is the equivalent of a summer blockbuster, Emma is the equivalent of a good Masterpiece Theatre entry, perfect for disabusing people with the impression that anime consists only of mecha and fanservice and warming the soul on a cold winter's day.The basic formula is nothing special.  William Jones, a member of a relatively newly rich family, pays a visit to his aging former governess Kelly Stowner, now a retired member of the middle class.  In the process he promptly falls for her personal maid Emma, hired as she's getting on in years and needs help with the usual household chores, in spite of his father increasingly pressing him to pay suit to Eleanor Campbell, the daughter of a family he would like to combine with.  The fun really starts when William's outrageous, self-assured, hookah addicted friend Prince Hakim Atawari arrives from India for a visit.  When Hakim starts crushing on Emma and makes a move, William finally starts to realize that he can't be happy without Emma.  But with their class differences, the road to true love won't be an easy one.  They do have two things going for them, however - Mrs. Stowner, who wants to secure the happiness of the two young people she loves as her health declines, and Hakim, who quickly recovers from being shot down by Emma once he becomes aware of his buddy's interest and sets himself to ensuring that they wind up together...The two major strengths of the series are it's amazing detail (Victorian London is a character in itself) and the avoidance of having the characters become cardboard cutouts.  Although basically a good guy, William isn't a saint, and his refusal to cut things off with Eleanor in his attempts to appease his father is borderline cruel.  Hakim could have been a first-class jerk but becomes much more as the series progresses,  giving William verbal smackdowns as the audience's surrogate, and repeating as necessary.  Things always liven up when he's around.  Eleanor, who could have been written as a money-grubbing she-devil, is extremely sympathetic and has genuinely fallen in love with William, trying desperately to figure out what she's doing wrong when she's not at fault and William won't be honest with her.  It's even possible to be slightly sympathetic towards William's father, who knows that a relationship between William and Emma would likely completely undo all his hard work to get the family where it is.For romance fans in general and fans of Victorian England and Jane Austinish novels in particular.  Just note that there are only subtitles and no English dub (we're lucky a chance was taken on distributing it at all), you'll want to avoid the spoilish Gazette booklet until after watching it through, and this is only Season 1 of 2 - which means, of course, that it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.",4,The chicken soup of anime.,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,2844,"['typical', 'shounen', 'series', 'equivalent', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'Emma', 'equivalent', 'good', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'entry', 'perfect', 'disabusing', 'people', 'impression', 'anime', 'only', 'mecha', 'fanservice', 'warming', 'soul', 'cold', 'winter', 'day.The', 'basic', 'formula', 'nothing', 'special', 'William', 'Jones', 'member', 'relatively', 'newly', 'rich', 'family', 'visit', 'aging', 'former', 'governess', 'Kelly', 'Stowner', 'now', 'retired', 'member', 'middle', 'class', 'process', 'promptly', 'personal', 'maid', 'Emma', 'hired', 'getting', 'years', 'help', 'usual', 'household', 'chores', 'spite', 'father', 'increasingly', 'pressing', 'pay', 'suit', 'Eleanor', 'Campbell', 'daughter', 'family', 'would', 'like', 'combine', 'fun', 'really', 'when', 'William', 'outrageous', 'self-assured', 'hookah', 'addicted', 'friend', 'Prince', 'Hakim', 'Atawari', 'India', 'visit', 'When', 'Hakim', 'crushing', 'Emma', 'move', 'William', 'finally', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'Emma', 'class', 'differences', 'road', 'true', 'love', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'one', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'however', 'Mrs.', 'Stowner', 'who', 'secure', 'happiness', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'health', 'declines', 'Hakim', 'who', 'quickly', 'recovers', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'Emma', 'once', 'aware', 'buddy', 'interest', 'ensuring', 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'two', 'major', 'strengths', 'series', 'are', 'amazing', 'detail', 'Victorian', 'London', 'character', 'avoidance', 'having', 'characters', 'become', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'basically', 'good', 'guy', 'William', ""n't"", 'saint', 'refusal', 'cut', 'things', 'off', 'Eleanor', 'attempts', 'appease', 'father', 'borderline', 'cruel', 'Hakim', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'first-class', 'jerk', 'much', 'more', 'series', 'giving', 'William', 'verbal', 'smackdowns', 'audience', 'surrogate', 'repeating', 'necessary', 'Things', 'always', 'liven', 'up', 'when', 'around', 'Eleanor', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'money-grubbing', 'she-devil', 'extremely', 'sympathetic', 'genuinely', 'fallen', 'love', 'William', 'trying', 'desperately', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'doing', 'wrong', 'when', 'not', 'fault', 'William', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'honest', 'even', 'possible', 'be', 'slightly', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'William', 'father', 'who', 'relationship', 'William', 'Emma', 'would', 'likely', 'completely', 'hard', 'work', 'get', 'family', 'where', 'romance', 'fans', 'general', 'fans', 'Victorian', 'England', 'Jane', 'Austinish', 'novels', 'particular', 'Just', 'note', 'are', 'only', 'subtitles', 'English', 'dub', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'chance', 'was', 'taken', 'distributing', ""'ll"", 'want', 'avoid', 'spoilish', 'Gazette', 'booklet', 'watching', 'only', 'Season', '1', '2', 'course', 'bit', 'cliffhanger']",Emma - A Victorian Romance Season 1

The story presented in this series is strong in how different it is. It's a slow moving, quiet, character drive period drama. Once you move past the differences and look at the series for what it is, you're still left with something above average.The characters and story are strong in their own ways. While the pacing and humor of the series will try the patience of everyone at some point, the romance and characters will keep you coming back. I can understand someone loving this series but I can also someone saying that they hated it.

That is until she meets the kind and warm William, a member of the gentry and the oldest son of a wealthy family. They instantly fall for one another. But they live in different social classes making it difficult for them to be together. Many people try to tear them apart. Is their love strong enough to make it through life's obstacles?I found this show (both seasons) to be a bit dull and slow-paced, which made it boring at times. Plus, there was some nudity in this show that seemed really out of place, tacky, and unnecessary. However it does have it's good points. My favorite character is the carefree, eccentric prince from India, because he is the most interesting and he livens up the story. His silent servants are quite funny too. There are some scenes that are more exciting and progress the story along nicely that I enjoyed. I'm glad I watched it once, but there won't be a second time.

1137583,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B0012K53K4,Michael Valdivielso,"[0, 0]","A Victorian romance is always a tad sugary and sometimes a tad too unrealistic.  Maid marries Noble Gentleman and everybody is happy with it.  Of course, the Maid turns out to really be a lovely Princess or Noblewoman down on her luck.  Blah, blah, blah.  Nope.  That will not do for the Japanese.  Real love is everything and if the Noble is worried about what the upper crust will say than go away and leave the Maid alone. Whiners can't handle love!  TRUE LOVE!The Japanese themselves are VERY much aware of the class system and the structured society of Victoria England, having lived within one for thousands of years.  But they also have come to understand and believe in true love.  Which means drama, pain, and a detailed plot, slowly built up character threads, and a story with a gritty ending.  Warning, sometimes the Japanese prefer real over happy.The artwork is wonderful, the characters seem so real you sometimes want to punch William, and the energy put into the historical background is amazing.  And while the ending may upset a few people please remember that this is ONLY the first season!  There is a great extra in the form of a nice book but few extras in the DVDs themselves.
