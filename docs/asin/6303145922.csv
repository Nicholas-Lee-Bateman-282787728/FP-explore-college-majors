Hamlow,"[5, 6]","That's the message the White Guardian desperately tells Tegan in the final chapter of the Black Guardian/Turlough trilogy, which concludes with a fascinating concept dealing with immortal Eternals and mortal Ephemerals, in which being an Ephemeral is better.  The Eternals are engaged in a spaceship race, where the craft are replicas of Earth vessels from various periods, with the officers and crew wearing uniforms conforming to a given period.  The craft the TARDIS crew land on is an early 20th century Edwardian racing yacht, with the crew taken from 1901, the same year the first British submarine was launched.  The prize?  Enlightenment.The Eternals don't have human ingenuity and imagination of their own, something that Ephemerals, or as Tegan says accurately, &quot;human beings,&quot; are gifted with.  The Doctor denounces them as parasites who feed on living minds.Turlough's desperation is at a fever pitch here.  He constantly beseeches the Black Guardian for advice, but by this time, the powerful being is fed up with the boy and has doomed him to living until he kills the Doctor.  He looks more to the Doctor as his source of guidance and protection, but the weasel always working to better his position, especially when it appears he is joining sides with Wrack, the menacing pirate captain of the Buccaneer who has an equally menacing laugh.  Kudos to Lynda Barron.Tegan's her usual grumpy self, but she does show outrage when the Eternals react to the destruction of a rival competitor without compassion.  Heck, I would be grumpy if I was being courted by a first mate who finds my mind fascinating.In the dinner scene, the Doctor appreciates fine wine like he did in Day Of The Daleks.  He also finds time to change his celery.The best line is when the Doctor tells the seasick Tegan, &quot;Brave heart, Tegan.&quot;  To which the hapless Australian replies, &quot;It's not my heart I'm worried about.&quot;Marriner is the only Eternal who is the closest to likable, as he helps the Doctor aboard the Buccaneer.  True, his obsession with Tegan makes him like a creep sometimes, but he is beginning to find out what it's like to be human.  If he could choose, would he forsake his immortality in exchange for living with Tegan, or is his emotional insulation, as Romana would've called it, too advanced for him to actually care for her?  It's almost like Wim Wenders' Himmel Uber Berlin.The balance of power in the universe can be summed up in this exchange between the Black and White Guardian.White Guardian:  You will never destroy the light.Black Guardian:  Others will do it for me.White Guardian:  Destroy the light and you destroy yourself.  Dark cannot exist without knowledge of light.Black Guardian:  &quot;Nor light without dark.&quot;That knowledge itself is enlightening.",4,"Tell the Doctor, winner takes all!",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2809,"['message', 'White', 'Guardian', 'desperately', 'Tegan', 'final', 'chapter', 'Black', 'Guardian/Turlough', 'trilogy', 'fascinating', 'concept', 'dealing', 'immortal', 'Eternals', 'mortal', 'Ephemerals', 'being', 'Ephemeral', 'better', 'Eternals', 'are', 'engaged', 'spaceship', 'race', 'where', 'craft', 'are', 'replicas', 'Earth', 'vessels', 'various', 'periods', 'officers', 'crew', 'wearing', 'uniforms', 'conforming', 'given', 'period', 'craft', 'TARDIS', 'crew', 'land', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Edwardian', 'racing', 'yacht', 'crew', 'taken', '1901', 'same', 'year', 'first', 'British', 'submarine', 'was', 'launched', 'prize', 'Enlightenment.The', 'Eternals', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'human', 'ingenuity', 'imagination', 'own', 'something', 'Ephemerals', 'Tegan', 'accurately', 'quot', 'human', 'beings', 'quot', 'are', 'gifted', 'Doctor', 'parasites', 'who', 'feed', 'living', 'minds.Turlough', 'desperation', 'fever', 'pitch', 'here', 'constantly', 'Black', 'Guardian', 'advice', 'time', 'powerful', 'being', 'fed', 'up', 'boy', 'doomed', 'living', 'Doctor', 'more', 'Doctor', 'source', 'guidance', 'protection', 'weasel', 'always', 'working', 'better', 'position', 'especially', 'when', 'joining', 'sides', 'Wrack', 'menacing', 'pirate', 'captain', 'Buccaneer', 'who', 'equally', 'menacing', 'laugh', 'Kudos', 'Lynda', 'Barron.Tegan', 'usual', 'grumpy', 'self', 'show', 'outrage', 'when', 'Eternals', 'react', 'destruction', 'rival', 'competitor', 'compassion', 'Heck', 'would', 'be', 'grumpy', 'was', 'being', 'courted', 'first', 'mate', 'who', 'mind', 'fascinating.In', 'dinner', 'scene', 'Doctor', 'fine', 'wine', 'did', 'Day', 'Daleks', 'also', 'time', 'change', 'celery.The', 'best', 'line', 'when', 'Doctor', 'seasick', 'Tegan', 'quot', 'Brave', 'heart', 'Tegan.', 'quot', 'hapless', 'Australian', 'replies', 'quot', 'not', 'heart', ""'m"", 'worried', 'about.', 'quot', 'Marriner', 'only', 'Eternal', 'who', 'closest', 'likable', 'Doctor', 'Buccaneer', 'True', 'obsession', 'Tegan', 'creep', 'sometimes', 'beginning', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'could', 'choose', 'would', 'forsake', 'immortality', 'exchange', 'living', 'Tegan', 'emotional', 'insulation', 'Romana', 'would', ""'ve"", 'called', 'too', 'advanced', 'actually', 'care', 'almost', 'like', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'Himmel', 'Uber', 'Berlin.The', 'balance', 'power', 'universe', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'exchange', 'Black', 'White', 'Guardian.White', 'Guardian', 'will', 'never', 'destroy', 'light.Black', 'Guardian', 'Others', 'will', 'do', 'me.White', 'Guardian', 'Destroy', 'light', 'destroy', 'Dark', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'knowledge', 'light.Black', 'Guardian', 'quot', 'light', 'dark.', 'quot', 'knowledge', 'enlightening']",Doctor Who - Enlightenment VHS

This is so different from any other Dr. Who story, and yet keeps the true spirit of what Doctor Who is all about. Which, I suppose, is what makes this one so good. If they were all like this, I don't think I would like it so much. But that's what I like about it. It's not like all the others. It has a very good story in it. Keeps you wanting more and more as the story goes on. It's exciting, has good special effects, the Eternals are one of the spookiest beings in the history of Dr. Who, the music is very eerie, and ends with a final showdown with the Black Gaurdian in which Turlough must finally choose between killing the Doctor or suffering the wrath of the evil Guardian himself.

359821,A1CZHZ0PR0SV06,6303145922,"John S. Drew ""drewshi""","[1, 1]","Originally, I was never impressed with the final story in this Black Guardian trilogy.  That's because I watched it as an edited movie, and it didn't seem to flow very well.  But in its episodic parts, as on this tape,  it works much better.  I think the only problem I had with this story of  timeless beings known as Eternals, racing through space in sailboats to  reach the prize of Enlightenment was the performance of Linda Baron as  Wrack, the pirate.  It was a great performance, but all wrong for the  character of the empty Eternal.  She played the pirate over the top.  Fun,  but wrong for the story and character.",4,Winner Takes All,959558400,"05 29, 2000",2000,624,"['Originally', 'was', 'never', 'impressed', 'final', 'story', 'Black', 'Guardian', 'trilogy', 'watched', 'edited', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'flow', 'very', 'well', 'episodic', 'parts', 'tape', 'much', 'better', 'think', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'story', 'timeless', 'beings', 'known', 'Eternals', 'racing', 'space', 'sailboats', 'reach', 'prize', 'Enlightenment', 'was', 'performance', 'Linda', 'Baron', 'Wrack', 'pirate', 'was', 'great', 'performance', 'wrong', 'character', 'empty', 'Eternal', 'played', 'pirate', 'top', 'Fun', 'wrong', 'story', 'character']",Doctor Who - Enlightenment VHS

Just to correct a misconception of a previous reviewer, it was ETERNALS not humans who were racing to achieve enlightenment.  There were  humans on board the 'ships' but they were only part of the game.Anyway,  this story centers around Turlough (not really a good thing), and doesn't  really make you sympathize with him, or in fact ANY of the characters  involved.  Captain Wrack was terrible. I really couldn't stand that  character for some reason.  As I watched the story, I found myself just  wishing the race to be over so I could see the resolution and stop watching  it.On a good note, the end was ALMOST worth the wait. I won't reveal any  more for the sake of those who have not seen it, but lets just say it makes  a nice, final resolution to the Black Guardian Trilogy.Not one of the  better Who stories, but you should see it at least once anyway.",3,A Bit of a Yawn Actually...,918000000,"02 3, 1999",1999,948,"['what', 'remember', 'story', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'Just', 'correct', 'misconception', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'was', 'ETERNALS', 'not', 'humans', 'who', 'were', 'racing', 'achieve', 'enlightenment', 'were', 'humans', 'board', ""'ships"", 'were', 'only', 'part', 'game.Anyway', 'story', 'centers', 'Turlough', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'thing', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sympathize', 'fact', 'ANY', 'characters', 'involved', 'Captain', 'Wrack', 'was', 'terrible', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'character', 'reason', 'watched', 'story', 'found', 'just', 'wishing', 'race', 'be', 'so', 'could', 'see', 'resolution', 'stop', 'watching', 'good', 'note', 'end', 'was', 'ALMOST', 'wait', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'sake', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'just', 'say', 'nice', 'final', 'resolution', 'Black', 'Guardian', 'Trilogy.Not', 'one', 'better', 'Who', 'stories', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'anyway']",Doctor Who - Enlightenment VHS
