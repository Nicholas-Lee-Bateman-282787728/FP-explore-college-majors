861845,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00066VTU8,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[35, 35]","This miniseries is great in that it presents Dr. King as the complex human being that he was with some of his insecurites and personal issues intact as opposed to the saint that he is often portrayed. The intracacies behind the Birmingham, Memphis, and Vietnam campaigns are handled well and Winfield makes a very good MLK. Cicely Tyson does very well as Coretta and incidentally, Rosa Parks is played by MLK's daughter Yolanda. The scenes of MLK smoking cigarettes and the adultery issue will shock a lot of people, but after all, the man was born in Atlanta and not Bethlehem, and these are based on acknowledged facts.However, these is a scene that will annoy historians and Malcolm X fans. The treatment of King's meeting with M/X is an unfair fictionalization of what really happened. M/X is shown as hatemongering lunatic who encourages people in the ghettoes to burn down their cities. The producers have Malcolm confused with a later generation of militants, as the record shows that while the real Malcolm had his faults, he never publicly condoned mindless violence aside from self-defense.This aside, and the composition of characters as prototypes of Bayard Rustin and Jesse Jackson aisde, this stays pretty close to the facts. Watch and enjoy, but read a good King bio such as ""Bearing the Cross"" by Taylor Branch, or ""Let the Trumpet Sound"" by Stephen Oates afterwards to get a broader picture.",4,Great intro,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,1408,"['great', 'Dr.', 'King', 'complex', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'insecurites', 'personal', 'issues', 'intact', 'opposed', 'saint', 'often', 'portrayed', 'intracacies', 'Birmingham', 'Memphis', 'Vietnam', 'campaigns', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'Winfield', 'very', 'good', 'MLK', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'very', 'well', 'Coretta', 'incidentally', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'played', 'MLK', 'daughter', 'Yolanda', 'scenes', 'MLK', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'adultery', 'issue', 'will', 'shock', 'lot', 'people', 'man', 'was', 'born', 'Atlanta', 'not', 'Bethlehem', 'are', 'based', 'acknowledged', 'facts.However', 'scene', 'will', 'annoy', 'historians', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'fans', 'treatment', 'King', 'meeting', 'M/X', 'unfair', 'fictionalization', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'M/X', 'shown', 'hatemongering', 'lunatic', 'who', 'people', 'ghettoes', 'burn', 'down', 'cities', 'producers', 'have', 'Malcolm', 'confused', 'later', 'generation', 'militants', 'record', 'real', 'Malcolm', 'had', 'faults', 'never', 'publicly', 'condoned', 'mindless', 'violence', 'aside', 'self-defense.This', 'aside', 'composition', 'characters', 'prototypes', 'Bayard', 'Rustin', 'Jesse', 'Jackson', 'aisde', 'pretty', 'close', 'facts', 'Watch', 'enjoy', 'read', 'good', 'King', 'bio', 'such', 'Bearing', 'Cross', 'Taylor', 'Branch', 'Let', 'Trumpet', 'Sound', 'Stephen', 'Oates', 'afterwards', 'get', 'broader', 'picture']",N/A

Although the movie itself was made in 1978, the DVD's copyright year is this very year, 2005. The DVD bonus material includes interviews of Ossie Davis, who knew & admired both MLK & MX, as well as played Daddy King in the movie. I was amazed to learn that Al Freeman Jr (who played Elijah Muhammad in the MX movie) also played one of MLK's colleagues in the MLK movie, & that all 4 of the real King children (Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter & Bernice) played other characters in the movie.Among the differences between the movie & the facts is that the church bombing in which the 4 girls died actually happened after, instead of before, MLK's ""I Have A Dream"" speech. Also, the funeral scene shows 4 caskets, whereas in real life one family opted for a separate funeral. As for the meeting between MLK & MX, it happened in Washington DC surrounded by reporters & photographers, not in Chicago behind a closed door; in fact, MX had already been killed by the time MLK went to Chicago. And of course, the names of a few characters were changed.All in all, it's a wonderful movie, with 3 parts lasting about an hour & a half each.
