819036,A2VBMJC56CYVCR,B0001ZX0GU,Camp Whacked,"[0, 0]","WITCHBOARD was one of those movies from the 80's that had a spooky vibe, due to it's supernatural theme and well executed spook-out sequences.  The story surrounding the Ouija board was well crafted with a believable love triangle and a story about friendship intertwined in the mix.  The characters are very likeable, which keeps you interested as you actually care about what happens to them.  That is an essential component to making a movie like this work and it does the job well.  Actress Tawney Kitaen was a perfect casting choice for the lead role as she is empathetic and incredibly sexy.  Todd Allen and Stephen Nichols are also fantastic as two former friends who are forced to connect again due to the circumstances of this intriguing ouija-board mystery.  It isn't as spooky to me now as it was when I saw it as a kid.  But the story is still a good one and I enjoyed taking the ride again on Blu Ray.  The Blu Ray quality was pretty good.  I'd give the picture a 3.5 out of 5.  It's the best I've even seen it look.  Sound is good as well.  And the Extras are an absolute pleasure!  It was fantastic to see the cast and crew today talking about making this horror gem from the 80's.

819037,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B0001ZX0GU,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[32, 42]","I think a good number of people have tried a Ouija (a combination of the French and German words for yes, Oui - Ja) board at least once in their lives, most likely when they were younger, as we're generally more open and accepting in believing in the supernatural possibilities inherent within the game.  For those of you unfamiliar with it, it's a board inscribed with all the letters of the alphabet, numbers from 0 to 9, and the words yes, no, maybe, and good-bye.  There's also a piece called a planchette, which is a movable three-legged device people would put their fingertips on, and then pose questions that would be answered by whatever supernatural elements may be around at the time, spelling out words or pointing to the words printed on the board.  Do spirits actually move the planchette, sending messages from beyond the grave?  No...the movements are really caused by unnoticeable, and usually unintentional, forces of the persons whose hands are on the planchette, and usually end up spelling out gibberish and unintellible words.Witchboard (1985), written and directed by Kevin Tenney, presents the notion that the Ouija board is actually a link to supernatural, even a portal at times, and what happens when a particularly nasty spirit decides to try and make use of the portal.  The film stars Tawny Kitaen (yes, the girl from the Whitesnake video), Todd Allen, who appeared in the very excellent western Silverado in the same year, and soap opera regular Stephen Nichols.  As the film begins, we are in the midst of a party, hosted by Linda (Kitaen), and her boyfriend Jim (Allen).  It seems to be going alright, although it seemed like there was something lacking from your typical 80's party, namely the cocainia...anyway, for some unknown reason, Linda has invited her old beau, Brandon (Nichols), and the tension soon rises between Brandon and Jim, as they used to be best friends, and Brandon blames Jim for stealing Linda away from him...whether he did or not, we will find out later, but mostly this just established Linda as a real bonehead for not taking more care in making up the guest list.  As a tension breaker, Linda suggests they play a game Brandon has brought, an Ouija board.  Brandon, a true believer, claims to have contacted many spirits, and also claims it's all the real deal, and not some hokem pokem child's game.  To prove it, he demonstrates the boards' power by trying to contact a deceased boy named David.  Contact is made, but there are a few who aren't convinced, Jim being one, and he basically says it's all a bunch of hooey, which seems to agitate the spirit, and causes some unexplained phenomena included the popping of the tires on Brandon's car.  As the guests leave, Brandon forgets to take his Ouija board, and so Linda starts using it by herself, which is dangerous as she soon starts acting strange as the spirit begins taking possession of her.  Questions begin arise, after a couple of particularly gruesome death of a friend, regarding the true nature of the spirit, its' intentions, and its' true identity.  Jim and Brandon manage to put aside their differences as they see changes within Linda, and fear she may be suffering from her contact with the unknown.  Who is the spirit and what does it want?  You'll find out...This really isn't a bad little movie, as there seemed to be more emphasis on the suspense elements within the story rather than just a usual slasher picture that was so very common throughout the 80's.  The direction was capable, much better than I would have though, considering this was Tenney's first film, although the script did suffer some fairly lame dialog.  One thing I found highly annoying was the character of Jim and his constant use of the word `babe' when talking to his girlfriend Linda.  The development of the characters was a bit weak, especially the point of Jim's inability to say the words, ""I love you"" to his girlfriend.  His standard reply whenever she would speak the line was ""I know you do"".  This hardly endears him to the viewing audience, but it does set up for him to profess his love later on, as he and Linda endure much by the end of the movie, and allows him to appear to have grown through the ordeal...it was just such an obvious plot device.  Ms. Kitaen did better than I would have thought, as she does appear to possess a modicum of talent, and maybe with a stronger script, she might have come off better (there's even a brief nude shower scene).  I felt a little disconnected from the story, as the protagonist was an invisible spirit throughout, whose motives were a bit murky until near the end.  We finally do meet him, but I couldn't help think the movie would have benefited had he appeared sooner in the film.  The plot does manage to stay on track through, avoiding major plot holes, and wraps up nicely with a less than shocking twist.  It did plod along at more than one point, causing the film to run longer than I thought necessary, at a whopping 98 minutes.  The worst part about the film was that of character Zarabeth, a medium, played by character actress Kathleen Wilhoite.  You may remember her starring opposite Charles Bronson in the 1986 film Murphy's Law.  I find her so completely annoying on so many levels.The wide screen print here looks great and special features include a commentary track by the director and a couple of producers.  Also included is a 23 minute `making of' documentary, a theatrical trailer, and a couple of TV spots.  Finally, inside the case, is a mini reproduction of an Ouija board, complete with pointer.  Anchor Bay does a great job with the release, so while the film is three stars, I am giving one extra for the overall release.Cookieman108",4,"A fun palor game, or portal of the

819039,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0001ZX0GU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","A year before she unleashed her hotness on the music video scene by appearing in several Whitesnake videos (and some two decades before she assaulted then-husband Chuck Finley and was arrested for cocaine possession), redhead Tawny Kitaen starred in Witchboard, which I consider to be one of the better non-blockbuster horror films of the glorious 1980s.  Having just seen it again for the first time in over twenty years, I have to say it still holds up well all these years later.  Well, there is one horribly bad special effects shot near the end, but its impact is somewhat mitigated by the fact that this movie doesn't really rely on special effects to do its thing.  Witchboard is all about instilling suspense and fear into the atmosphere swirling around a trio of well-developed characters.  At first, it looks like you're in for another boring ride on the arrogant rich boy vs. impudent poor boy train, but that begins to change once the spirits come out to play.I'm not exactly sure why Linda (Tawny Kitaen) would invite ex-boyfriend Brandon (Stephen Nichols) to a party with her new boyfriend Jim (Todd Allen), especially when she knows both men are now ex-best friends, but she does.  As the snarky comment meter begins to push in to the red, Linda overcomes her misgivings and actually welcomes the idea of trying out Brandon's Ouija board.  The pair succeeds in making contact with the spirit of a little boy that Brandon has spoken with before - but Jim's litany of condescending comments angers the spirit.  In all of the commotion, Brandon leaves his Ouija board there at Linda's and Jim's apartment.  Over the next few days, Linda unwisely - albeit unknowingly - starts using the board alone to speak to ""David,"" and that is when the troubles start coming fast and furious.  Lives are lost as Linda's obsession with using the Ouija board increases, ultimately putting her own life in danger.  Brandon soon comes to realize what is happening (progressive enchantment by a sinister spirit), but he can do little to help Linda without Jim's help - and that's a pretty long row to hoe.Witchboard is by no means scary, but it does sneak a few surprising moments into the mix, and the creepy atmosphere is effective even if it never becomes palpable.  Jim is a rather stoic character, and Todd Allen plays him as such pretty well; Tawny Kitaen earns her scream queen stripes with a more than satisfactory performance as the vulnerable (and hot) potential target for possession; but it is Stephen Nichols' performance that really  makes this something of a 1980s classic horror film.  With Jim playing the doubting game so well, Brandon really has to appear sincere and genuinely troubled by the potential danger the Ouija board poses for Linda - and Nichols pulls that off amazingly well.  I also have to mention Kathleen Wilhoite, who is impossible to forget in the minor role of California's kookiest medium, and Rose Marie.  You have to be doing something right when you can get Rose Marie, of all people, to appear in your horror film.From what I hear and read, the two Witchboard sequels aren't very good - but don't let that stop you from watching the original film.

819046,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B0001ZX0GU,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","Scream Factory continues its celebration of Kevin Tenney genre films with their Blu-ray release of &#34;Witchboard.&#34; I still remember my friends talking about this surprisingly good flick when it first came out in 1986. 28 years later, it still both holds up well and reminds viewers of the cheese served up in the greatest decade of horror.Linda Brewster is introduced to a centuries old tool of communication with the dead called a Ouija board. Although warned of the danger it holds, she begins summoning the spirit of a 10-year-old boy named David. She soon realizes that her dalliances with the dead were a mistake as the presence becomes stronger and violent. What sinister entity did Linda let loose in our world?&#34;Witchboard&#34; is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.85:1) and DTS-HD Audio Mono. Like most of the Blu-ray upgrades we get from this era, the movie looks and sounds better than it ever has. However, its digital transfer hasn't sucked all the &#34;real&#34; film feeling out of it. Its upgraded audio enhances every scream and dramatic crash of the musical score.Loads of bonus material is included with &#34;Witchboard.&#34; New audio commentary is provided by Writer/Director Kevin Tenney and actors Stephen Nichols, Kathleen Wilhoite, and James Quinn. Additional commentary features Tenney, Executive Producer Walter Josten, and Producer Jeff Geoffray chatting about the film. There are also new interviews with Kevin Tenney, Tawny Kitaen, J.B. Luebsen, James Quinn, Walter Josten, Todd Allen, and others. A vintage &#34;Making of 'Witchboard'&#34; featurette, theatrical trailer, TV spots, still gallery, and much more can be found.&#34;Witchboard&#34; is rated R for violence, language, adult situations, and nudity. Everything you would expect from a 1980s horror film is what you're served here. Is the nudity necessary? Of course not, but sadly producers felt it was a needed item to sell genre films at the time.Most religious folks will definitely give &#34;Witchboard&#34; a thumbs down, and with good reason. The movie doesn't really tell people not to play with Ouija boards. It warns that you shouldn't play with them alone. This can cause one to become obsessed and then possessed by the spirit attached to it. What people should take away from the film is that it's just not smart to try communicating with the dead or get involved with the occult or anything with the power to unleash a malevolent entity.&#34;Witchboard&#34; is full of all the wonderful schlock you would expect from a horror film released in 1986. There are nave characters doing incredibly dumb things and meeting horribly entertaining demises. Why would someone continue to communicate with a spirit that is growing constantly more violent and active? How many weird accidents have to happen around you before you realize something's not right? Also, was it really legal to smoke in the waiting room of a hospital in 1986? None of those questions are answered in the movie. However, there are some fun scares to be had in the journey to its climax.",4,"Scream Factory Brings ""Witchboard"" into Your Home on Blu-ray",1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,3079,"['Scream', 'Factory', 'celebration', 'Kevin', 'Tenney', 'genre', 'films', 'Blu-ray', 'release', '34', 'Witchboard.', '34', 'still', 'remember', 'friends', 'talking', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'flick', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1986', '28', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'viewers', 'cheese', 'served', 'up', 'greatest', 'decade', 'horror.Linda', 'Brewster', 'introduced', 'centuries', 'old', 'tool', 'communication', 'dead', 'called', 'Ouija', 'board', 'warned', 'danger', 'summoning', 'spirit', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'David', 'soon', 'dalliances', 'dead', 'were', 'mistake', 'presence', 'stronger', 'violent', 'What', 'sinister', 'entity', 'did', 'Linda', 'let', 'loose', 'world', '34', 'Witchboard', '34', 'presented', '1080p', 'High-Definition', 'Widescreen', '1.85:1', 'DTS-HD', 'Audio', 'Mono', 'most', 'Blu-ray', 'upgrades', 'get', 'era', 'movie', 'better', 'ever', 'However', 'digital', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'sucked', '34', 'real', '34', 'film', 'feeling', 'upgraded', 'audio', 'enhances', 'scream', 'dramatic', 'crash', 'musical', 'score.Loads', 'bonus', 'material', 'included', '34', 'Witchboard.', '34', 'New', 'audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Writer/Director', 'Kevin', 'Tenney', 'actors', 'Stephen', 'Nichols', 'Kathleen', 'Wilhoite', 'James', 'Quinn', 'Additional', 'commentary', 'features', 'Tenney', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Walter', 'Josten', 'Producer', 'Jeff', 'Geoffray', 'chatting', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'interviews', 'Kevin', 'Tenney', 'Tawny', 'Kitaen', 'J.B.', 'Luebsen', 'James', 'Quinn', 'Walter', 'Josten', 'Todd', 'Allen', 'others', 'vintage', '34', 'Making', ""'Witchboard"", '34', 'featurette', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'TV', 'spots', 'still', 'gallery', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'found.', '34', 'Witchboard', '34', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'adult', 'situations', 'nudity', 'Everything', 'would', 'expect', '1980s', 'horror', 'film', 'what', ""'re"", 'served', 'here', 'nudity', 'necessary', 'course', 'not', 'sadly', 'producers', 'felt', 'was', 'needed', 'item', 'sell', 'genre', 'films', 'time.Most', 'religious', 'folks', 'will', 'definitely', 'give', '34', 'Witchboard', '34', 'thumbs', 'down', 'good', 'reason', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'people', 'not', 'play', 'Ouija', 'boards', 'should', ""n't"", 'play', 'alone', 'can', 'cause', 'one', 'become', 'obsessed', 'then', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'attached', 'What', 'people', 'should', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'smart', 'try', 'communicating', 'dead', 'get', 'involved', 'occult', 'anything', 'power', 'unleash', 'malevolent', 'entity.', '34', 'Witchboard', '34', 'full', 'wonderful', 'schlock', 'would', 'expect', 'horror', 'film', 'released', '1986', 'are', 'nave', 'characters', 'doing', 'incredibly', 'dumb', 'things', 'meeting', 'horribly', 'entertaining', 'demises', 'Why', 'would', 'someone', 'continue', 'communicate', 'spirit', 'growing', 'constantly', 'more', 'violent', 'active', 'How', 'many', 'weird', 'accidents', 'have', 'happen', 'realize', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'Also', 'was', 'really', 'legal', 'smoke', 'waiting', 'room', 'hospital', '1986', 'None', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'fun', 'scares', 'be', 'had', 'journey', 'climax']",Witchboard

819052,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B0001ZX0GU,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[12, 13]","""Witchboard"" is better than many people think.  Is it a classic?  Well, maybe not, but if it's not in the elite of the horror movie genre, it's clearly one of the better ones.  You've got: some great/fantastic kills, a witchboard which is a transmitter to ghosts and demons and ultimately a window for possession of one of the main characters by a demon named Malfador.The acting in this movie is pretty good for a horror flick and I really thought the movie was well directed too.  The characters are dynamic and there is good character development evident throughout the movie which is more than I can say for about 100% of today's trash coming out in theaters.  Also, I really liked the plot and storyline.  ""Witchboard"" is an imaginitive and creative horror movie which is based in large part upon a supernatural element involving an evil force is which is released through a Quija board.It's much more difficult for a horror movie to be successful and effective based on supernatural subject matter as opposed to real life horror...the problem is that as a screenplay writer and director, you have to be able to sell this supernatural element to the audience or the movie is a total joke...in short, it's got to make sense at least as far as the imagination is concerned because even in the metaphysical, there has to be some rules, some logic that makes the story work and stimulate the viewer's mind.  The directers and writers of ""Witchboard"" were successful in this area and that makes the movie scary, interesting and good.The movie starts out at a party in which Linda's friend named Brandon brings a Quija board and they obviously have no idea what they are dealing with. Consequently, an evil and malevolent spirit is released which terrorizes and torments Linda ultimately to the point where it can possess her.  It is up to Brandon and his rival Jim to stop this from happening.I think ""Witchboard"" is very effective and successful as a supernatural and metaphysical horror movie.  Frankly, I don't see any evidence of this ""cheese"" that other reviewers refer too.  Of course, the viewer has to clear the mental hurdles and keep an open mind since the movie deals with the supernatural, but such is the case with any supernatural horror movie including ""Halloween"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", ""Salem's Lot"" and ""The Omen"", all of which are classic horror movies.  ""Witchboard"" is brilliant with its own logic and delivers the goods as a horror movie.  No, the movie isn't terrifying, nor is it scary enough to be considered a horror movie classic and that's why it doesn't quite get four stars, but it's interesting and chilling enough to be a very solid horror movie which is quite effective on its own merits, strong in substance and quite elegant in style as well.In short, ""Witchboard"" delivers an interesting storyline/plot, suspense which carries the viewer to and through the climax, a couple of great kills, solid characters and an evil and mysterious villain which is based in the supernatural.  What more can you ask for in a good solid horror flick?  I highly recommend ""Witchboard"" and I consider it a must own horror movie for the serious horror movie fan.",3,"3.99 STARS:  ""Hey, I don't talk to cardboard."" -Jim",1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,3188,"['Witchboard', 'better', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'classic', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'not', 'elite', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'clearly', 'one', 'better', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great/fantastic', 'kills', 'witchboard', 'transmitter', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'ultimately', 'window', 'possession', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'demon', 'named', 'Malfador.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'horror', 'flick', 'really', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'directed', 'too', 'characters', 'are', 'dynamic', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'evident', 'movie', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'about', '100', '%', 'today', 'trash', 'coming', 'out', 'theaters', 'Also', 'really', 'liked', 'plot', 'storyline', 'Witchboard', 'imaginitive', 'creative', 'horror', 'movie', 'based', 'large', 'part', 'supernatural', 'element', 'involving', 'evil', 'force', 'released', 'Quija', 'board.It', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'horror', 'movie', 'be', 'successful', 'effective', 'based', 'supernatural', 'subject', 'matter', 'opposed', 'real', 'life', 'horror', 'problem', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'supernatural', 'element', 'audience', 'movie', 'total', 'joke', 'short', 'got', 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'imagination', 'concerned', 'even', 'metaphysical', 'be', 'rules', 'logic', 'story', 'work', 'stimulate', 'viewer', 'mind', 'directers', 'writers', 'Witchboard', 'were', 'successful', 'area', 'movie', 'scary', 'interesting', 'good.The', 'movie', 'out', 'party', 'Linda', 'friend', 'named', 'Brandon', 'Quija', 'board', 'obviously', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'are', 'dealing', 'Consequently', 'evil', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'released', 'terrorizes', 'torments', 'Linda', 'ultimately', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'possess', 'Brandon', 'rival', 'Jim', 'stop', 'happening.I', 'think', 'Witchboard', 'very', 'effective', 'successful', 'supernatural', 'metaphysical', 'horror', 'movie', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'evidence', 'cheese', 'other', 'reviewers', 'refer', 'too', 'course', 'viewer', 'clear', 'mental', 'hurdles', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'movie', 'deals', 'supernatural', 'such', 'case', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'movie', 'including', 'Halloween', 'Exorcist', 'Shining', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'Omen', 'are', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'Witchboard', 'brilliant', 'own', 'logic', 'goods', 'horror', 'movie', 'No', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terrifying', 'scary', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'horror', 'movie', 'classic', 'why', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'four', 'stars', 'interesting', 'chilling', 'enough', 'be', 'very', 'solid', 'horror', 'movie', 'quite', 'effective', 'own', 'merits', 'strong', 'substance', 'quite', 'elegant', 'style', 'well.In', 'short', 'Witchboard', 'interesting', 'storyline/plot', 'suspense', 'viewer', 'climax', 'couple', 'great', 'kills', 'solid', 'characters', 'evil', 'mysterious', 'villain', 'based', 'supernatural', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'good', 'solid', 'horror', 'flick', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Witchboard', 'consider', 'must', 'own', 'horror', 'movie', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan']",Witchboard

I could not believe it wasn't available! I thought this was one of the best movies from my childhood! Well since it has come out on dvd I have rewatched it. I'll admit it was a lot more exciting the first time around. But it really wasn't too bad the second time around either! (some 15 years later!)I LOVE!!! Tawny Kitaen!!!!! I always thought she was SOOOO GORGEOUS! (And I still do!) She is the beautiful sex kitten in many of the 80's Whitesnake videos. (I'd like to have those on dvd too!) I think she was also in ""WKRP in Cincinatti"" but am not POSITIVE about that. At any rate the movie is worth watching for her alone. But the other actors are great as well. The psychic girl I realized was doctor Susan's sister Chloe on the show E.R. and her ex-boyfriend in the movie played a character named ""Patch"" on ""Days of Our Lives"". And he is HOT! Well obviously the movie is about playing with a ouija (or ""witch"") board. Linda (Tawny Kitaen's character) starts playing with it a party one night for fun and ends up becoming addicted to it. Well a lot of bad things happen and we find out later on that she hasn't been speaking with whom she thought she was through the board and she eventually becomes POSESSED. (I thought that was SO COOL when I was a kid!) Well I can't tell you how it ends but some people die and well some don't and to find out more you really should see it for yourself. I am adding this movie to my Christmas List for this year. It's a cool movie. I give it 4 stars. Maybe 4.5. BTW I DO believe that it is dangerous to play with ouija boards and I DO NOT RECCOMEND IT.

819062,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0001ZX0GU,Matthew King,"[6, 8]","I first started watching horror as a youngster in the mid-to-late eighties and ""Witchboard"" is one of those films that holds a special nostalgic place in my heart.  The craze back in those days was the slasher film and innumerable amounts of such movies made it into my VCR.  But despite being released in the middle of the slasher craze Witchboard dared to be different, a supernatural horror film involving witchcraft through a Ouija board.  This one hit especially close to home since in those days me and my friends would often gather into our basements with a Ouija board of our own, in a vein attempt to conjure spirits of the dead.  Finally, this 80's gem sees a release on DVD (complete with a pullout mini ouija board) thanks to Anchor Bay, who have also just released the equally excellent 80's classic ""Night of the Demons.""Guests at a house party for 30-somethings start fooling around with a Ouija board and conjure up the spirit of ""David"" a 10-year old who died in a tragic boating accident.  The day after the party, Linda begins experimenting with the board on her own in an attempt to learn more about the spirit of David.  As it turns out, using the Ouija board alone is a big no-no and soon Linda finds herself being stalked and terrorized by the spirit inside of the Ouija board.  Her husband and a friend take a drive to the town where David died to try to uncover the reasons for the spirit's hostility towards Linda.  But as the two soon find out, David is not the only spirit communicating through the Ouija board...""Witchboard"" is a horror film that relies more on suspense than gore or a high body count.  The first half of the movie has a slow pace, although it still manages to entertain.  This is a movie that is unabashedly eighties: the clothing, the hairstyles (Mullets for the guys, Cindy Lauper do's for the gals), a punky-looking psychic chick and some kicking heavy metal music.  Ah, the joy.  Where the movie picks off is when the two guys go on a roadtrip into the town where the spirit of David died.  The action picks up and builds to an exciting climax featuring a demon with a Linda Blair type of voice-over.  The acting is not great by any stretch but it's not horrible either.  It's refreshing to see an eighties horror film that doesn't focus on horny teenagers as fun as that can be, and instead has a cast comprised exclusively of adults who try their best to look serious despite the ridiculous premise.  With the death of VHS, movies like these have become very hard to find and that's why I'm glad many studios have started re-releasing these movies for a new generation to enjoy.

819065,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0001ZX0GU,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 3]","Any movie that features Whitesnake video vixen Tawny Kitaen is bound to raise a few eyebrows, but for this 80's horror romp, well, let's just say that acting isn't the most important thing here.  Kitaen plays a woman who comes into contact with the spirit of a deceased young boy via a Ouija board, and eventually, releases something much more sinister from the board that begins to assume posession over her.  Relying more on suspense and mystery than blood and gore (something that was a change of pace for horror films of the 80's), Witchboard is a surprisingly satisfying horror romp.  However, the look of the film is so unbelieveably dated (gotta love the mullet) that some may have a hard time getting into it, but other than that, Witchboard is still a fun flick.  The DVD is another fine package assembled by the good folks at Anchor Bay, who sure know how to package a horror film right.",4,"Dated, but surprisingly suspenseful",1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,897,"['movie', 'Whitesnake', 'video', 'vixen', 'Tawny', 'Kitaen', 'bound', 'raise', 'few', 'eyebrows', '80', 'horror', 'romp', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'acting', ""n't"", 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'here', 'Kitaen', 'woman', 'who', 'contact', 'spirit', 'deceased', 'young', 'boy', 'Ouija', 'board', 'eventually', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'board', 'assume', 'posession', 'Relying', 'more', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'blood', 'gore', 'something', 'was', 'change', 'pace', 'horror', 'films', '80', 'Witchboard', 'surprisingly', 'satisfying', 'horror', 'romp', 'However', 'look', 'film', 'so', 'unbelieveably', 'dated', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'mullet', 'may', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'other', 'Witchboard', 'still', 'fun', 'flick', 'DVD', 'fine', 'package', 'assembled', 'good', 'folks', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'who', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'package', 'horror', 'film', 'right']",Witchboard

819069,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B0001ZX0GU,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","I'm sure any horror fan reading this is aware of the backwash of horror films lining the video shelves in the 80's during the great slasher craze. The market was saturated with dozens of low-budget flicks lacking in plot, effects, and honed by big-name directors trying to make a buck while dreaming and drooling of bigger, better things.  As a result a few gems tended to drown in the shuffle, and when glancing just briefly at the cover of Witchboard and reading its synopsis, it's easy to prejudge it as another dead fish devoid of acting genius or anything more than cheap thrills and kills. But, with it being made by the same man who dished out Night of the Demons, could it actually have what it takes to keep its head above the water and survive?We start with a party. A lovely social gathering that ends in the traditional bickering, threats of violence, thrown out tires, and of course evil spirits. Linda Brewster, the hostess and house owner, is clearly the eye of the crowd. Her boyfriend, Jim, sits by her with his idiotic friends, while across from her is the intellectual ex-lover, now friend, Steven. Steven was also friends with Jim in childhood - ""like brothers"" - but now they are mortal enemies and in love with the same woman. Linda cares for Steven and always will but not in 'that way', and she loves Jim - who also loves her, but because of psychological issues can't say the words. Steven, knowing everything about Jim, already preguesses this fact, another spur to dig into his ex-friends side during the increasingly bitter relationship.Now, before you turn off the film thinking you accidentally stumbled into a soap opera instead of a horror movie, (even though ironically one of the leads went on to star in soaps), here's where it gets good. Steven's Ouija board is left behind and Linda, not knowing better, begins playing with the board herself. Pretty soon she's confused on what's real and what's not, and ultimately whether the 'spirit' is friend...or foe. Will the three be able to settle their differences and work as a team to vanquish the spirit and save Linda, or will their inability to relate to each other only enable the evil to tighten its grip?The ouija holds a fascinating backstory of legend and creepy ookiness, yet is sadly not covered enough in horror films and given its due. Sure, it may be mentioned briefly but as a central focal point the movies are few and far between. I'd wager not many have achieved such good use of the device as Witchboard, which, while it does stumble on a few steps, manages to capture ones attention and hold it. Generally films of the 80's enjoyed making the most of the low-budget effects by mindlessly painting on the gore, no matter how cheap looking, and injecting laughs for extra. Here Witchboard tries to have the audience ignore it's lower budget crutch, leaving little gore and minimal violence, instead trying to do a sleight of the hand and introduce actual story.  It's not really about a possessed woman going mad as in the Exorcist; it concerns a slow sort of possession in an almost psychological way. Tension is consistently high between Brandon and Jim, best friends as youths, and now rivals in adulthood. The acting wasn't top notch but it worked, rubbing me the right way, while enough back story is added so the viewer has a clear idea of what's going down. Not only that, but there's something likeable about most of the main players, all working their own senses of charm and weaknesses.Suspense is built up in certain scenes, done very well by director Kevin Tenney (Night of the Demons). The bizarre shots of the spirit going fast, where the viewer sees this through the 'spirits' eyes, is extremely effective, adding a sense of fun and weirdness. There are a few instances that were tear-jerking, emotional, freaky, funny, and of course, as is inevitable in some B movies, dull. Don't go to watching Witchboard expecting violence and gore; they took it another direction here. There ARE deaths, and great ones at that, but not many. Blood drips, but it doesn't gush. This, thankfully, doesn't deter from the enjoyment of this particular film.Todd Allen as Jim provides comedic,  jerk relief. He looks pretty good, his acting style isn't bad, his dialogue is fitting, and he holds up the main emotional drama of the flick. Stephen Nichols as Brandon, who later goes on to blink his baby blues in soap operas, acts a little stiff here and I can't figure out if that was intended or not. Either way, I still liked him, and his character was sorely needed to keep this thing working. Tawny Kitaen plays Linda, a redheaded, goody two shoes, not much sense kind of gal. She worked, but her character just wasn't as interesting as the men's. The other stand out is the goofy to the extreme psychic, Zarabeth, is either a hate or love person. I've seen some say they loved her, while I loathed her. She was too much, too dopey, too irritating, thankfully not stealing too much time on screen. Her small role was already too much; I began to wonder if she was possessed!Once the game is over and the planchette has been stored away, memories remain of a fun, if a bit silly time that doesn't go overboard in the typical way. Tenney tried hard for true drama, and he succeeded, but whether the rest of it fit in well enough is still up in the air. Unforgettable, a good use of an intriguing horror device, and stocked with slightly off kilter drama that's oddly mesmerizing, Witchboard is definitely worth a watch.",4,Fun!,1379635200,"09 20,
