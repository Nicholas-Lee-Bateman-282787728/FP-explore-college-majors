1412063,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004K4FUVQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[12, 14]","Roger Corman proves you're never too old to make a cheesy bad movie, unleashing Dinoshark on an unsuspecting world.  After spending the last 150 million years or so frozen in a block of ice, the creature (basically a shark with the head and scales of a dinosaur) decides he is more than due for a vacation and sets off for the sun and fun of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  Like any tourist, Dinoshark overindulges himself in the local cuisine, takes part in a number of outdoor activities, and just has a great old time.  Even though his trademark killing move includes jumping out of the water, only one man ever manages to see him - local boat operator Trace McGraw (Eric Balfour).  Authorities blame the first few deaths on a tiger shark - and then they apparently just stop caring, no matter how many people disappear or die. They are apparently more concerned with drug smuggling (yeah, right) than a rash of local deaths.  There's certainly no Mexican equivalent to Roy Scheider's character in Jaws running around yelling ""Get out of the water!""  Instead, it's game on for all the excursion boats, parasailers, jet skiers, and swimmers - and nothing is going to stop the big regatta festival.  In other words, it's feeding time at the Dinoshark corral.Unfortunately for Dinoshark, it makes the mistake of eating the bottom half of one of Trace's friends - that makes it personal for him and mutual friend Carol Brubaker (Iva Hasperger), a tall, blonde Princeton graduate who supposedly teaches but spends most of her time coaching girls' water polo, hanging out in a seedy bar, studying marine biology just for the fun of it, and holding off the advances of creepy old men.  Together, Trace and Carol set out to find and kill the creature.  With what, you ask?  Well, it seems that any Mexican can borrow all kinds of heavy equipment from the military - and the local bar owner is Mexican.  Carol also has connections with a local scientist (played by none other than Roger Corman himself) who might be able to determine the creature's vulnerabilities.The special effects of Dinoshark are both good and bad.  On the bad side, it's obviously a computer generated creature, and some of the shots of it swimming along tend to be on the repetitive side.  On the other hand, many of the killings are of the up close and personal variety, with Dinoshark clasping victims in its jaws and taking them down to their bloody deaths.  We're also treated to several shots of gory remains, which I certainly appreciated.  In the end, it doesn't really matter that the creature looks smaller than it should or that what should be the most spectacular scene in the film lacks any excitement whatsoever - the special effects are still a positive, as far as I'm concerned.If you're a fan of the ""awesomely awful made-for-TV movie genre"" or happy traveler in the schlock-filled world of sci-fi B-movies, you're probably going to enjoy Dinoshark.  It's a heck of a lot better than a lot of the low-budget movies Roger Corman has made over the years.  It's true that there's a lot of bad acting on display among the supporting cast (including Corman), but I think Balfour and Hasperger actually do a pretty good job carrying the movie on their shoulders.  This is just a good, low-budget monster movie made in the old B-movie tradition, and I quite enjoyed watching it.",4,Dinoshark season is officially open,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,3349,"['Roger', 'Corman', ""'re"", 'never', 'too', 'old', 'make', 'cheesy', 'bad', 'movie', 'unleashing', 'Dinoshark', 'unsuspecting', 'world', 'spending', 'last', '150', 'million', 'years', 'so', 'frozen', 'block', 'ice', 'creature', 'basically', 'shark', 'head', 'scales', 'dinosaur', 'more', 'due', 'vacation', 'sets', 'off', 'sun', 'fun', 'Puerto', 'Vallarta', 'Mexico', 'tourist', 'Dinoshark', 'local', 'cuisine', 'part', 'number', 'outdoor', 'activities', 'just', 'great', 'old', 'time', 'Even', 'trademark', 'killing', 'move', 'jumping', 'water', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'ever', 'see', 'local', 'boat', 'operator', 'Trace', 'McGraw', 'Eric', 'Balfour', 'Authorities', 'blame', 'first', 'few', 'deaths', 'tiger', 'shark', 'then', 'apparently', 'just', 'stop', 'caring', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'disappear', 'die', 'are', 'apparently', 'more', 'concerned', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'yeah', 'right', 'rash', 'local', 'deaths', 'certainly', 'Mexican', 'equivalent', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'character', 'Jaws', 'running', 'around', 'yelling', 'Get', 'water', 'Instead', 'game', 'excursion', 'boats', 'parasailers', 'jet', 'skiers', 'swimmers', 'nothing', 'going', 'stop', 'big', 'regatta', 'festival', 'other', 'words', 'feeding', 'time', 'Dinoshark', 'corral.Unfortunately', 'Dinoshark', 'mistake', 'eating', 'bottom', 'half', 'one', 'Trace', 'friends', 'personal', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Carol', 'Brubaker', 'Iva', 'Hasperger', 'tall', 'blonde', 'Princeton', 'graduate', 'who', 'supposedly', 'teaches', 'most', 'time', 'coaching', 'girls', 'water', 'polo', 'hanging', 'out', 'seedy', 'bar', 'studying', 'marine', 'biology', 'just', 'fun', 'holding', 'off', 'advances', 'creepy', 'old', 'men', 'Together', 'Trace', 'Carol', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'kill', 'creature', 'what', 'ask', 'Well', 'Mexican', 'can', 'borrow', 'kinds', 'heavy', 'equipment', 'military', 'local', 'bar', 'owner', 'Mexican', 'Carol', 'also', 'connections', 'local', 'scientist', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'determine', 'creature', 'vulnerabilities.The', 'special', 'effects', 'Dinoshark', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'bad', 'side', 'obviously', 'computer', 'generated', 'creature', 'shots', 'swimming', 'along', 'tend', 'be', 'repetitive', 'side', 'other', 'hand', 'many', 'killings', 'are', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'variety', 'Dinoshark', 'clasping', 'victims', 'jaws', 'taking', 'down', 'bloody', 'deaths', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'several', 'shots', 'gory', 'remains', 'certainly', 'appreciated', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'creature', 'smaller', 'should', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'most', 'spectacular', 'scene', 'film', 'excitement', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'positive', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'awesomely', 'awful', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'genre', 'happy', 'traveler', 'schlock-filled', 'world', 'sci-fi', 'B-movies', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'enjoy', 'Dinoshark', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'lot', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'made', 'years', 'true', 'lot', 'bad', 'acting', 'display', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Corman', 'think', 'Balfour', 'Hasperger', 'actually', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'carrying', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'just', 'good', 'low-budget', 'monster', 'movie', 'made', 'old', 'B-movie', 'tradition', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'watching']",Dinoshark

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","I live in a world where two things are certain--(1) the SyFy network will continue to pump out spectacularly bad movies and (2) strange creature hybrids are here to stay. For the record, I love me some bad movie mayhem and look forward to many of these diabolically awful monster movies. But there is a fine line between campy badness that makes everything good and just plain badness. ""Dinoshark,"" in the pantheon of similar SyFy films, has relatively little to distinguish it from the pack and, therefore, stands as a rather bland example of just plain badness! Think about it--we've had Mega Piranha, Mega Shark, Giant Octopus, Sharktopus, Crocosaurus, Mega Python, Dinocroc, and Gatoroid to name just a few beasties (and sadly, each of these creatures is burned into my memory!). A prehistoric shark just isn't that compelling in relationship to some of the more lunatic creations. And instead of deliciously and delightfully perplexing actors like Tiffany, Eric Roberts, Barry Williams, Debbie Gibson, Lorenzo Lamas and the kid that played Urkel--here you get the questionable star wattage of Eric Balfour. I don't know about you, but the Balfour name holds very little appeal in our household.Well, this thinly plotted epic is about a long extinct sea beast who is released from his icy tomb and is hungry. Actually, he leaves quite a few body parts lying around--so maybe he just likes to kill. Balfour is in Puerto Vallarta chartering a boat for a friend when this outbreak of carnage begins. One of the initial victims is an old friend and he takes her death personally. Joining forces with a local scientist, I mean teacher, I mean water polo coach (oh, this extraordinary woman does it all!), the two solve the mystery of what the creature is with 15 seconds of Internet searching. Then it takes an extremely slow scientist the rest of the movie to tell them that the beast is vulnerable through its eye. The requisite nuttiness happens leading to a grand finale (where once again, none of the tourists have been alerted to the impending threat by local authorities) involving a child in jeopardy and lots of completely random attacks.The failing of ""Dinoshark"" is really three-fold. The creature is fairly uninteresting--the wacky Sharktopus is a much better example of a ridiculous hybrid threat. The performances are lackluster--nothing like the demented overacting of pop princess Tiffany that has distinguished other similar films. And, most deadly, the film lacks any real humor or individuality. You've seen it all before and I guarantee that you've had more fun with it! The lack of genuine fun, intentional or otherwise, is really what causes this movie to sink under its own weight. There are just much better examples of this genre that provide madcap nuttiness that you can really laugh along with.

Yes.This is another take on the well-worn ""Jaws"" theme but stands out because it takes place in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and features a nigh super prehistoric shark.Although the dinoshark itself and the things it does (like taking down a helicopter and jumping over barriers) are unbelieveable, the story and characters take it seriously, so the viewer is able to suspend belief and enjoy the flick for what it is.I was impressed with the good group of characters and their believable relationships. The filmmakers obviously put some effort into the story.Eric Balfour stars as the protagonist, Trace, and Iva Hasperger is his female counterpart, Carol. Balfour would make a great Sub-Mariner or Spock with his angular look and Iva is all-around gorgeous, top to bottom. In fact, the women in the film are a huge highlight. Outstanding job on that front.Bottom line: ""Dinoshark"" is nothing to write home about but it delivers as a made-for-tv nature-runs-amok flick.GRADE: B",4,"""You're gonna need a bigger chopper.""",1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,1120,"['film', 'called', 'Dinoshark', 'came', 'Syfy', 'What', 'tell', 'ya', 'micro-budget', 'creature', 'feature', 'question', 'deliver', 'Yes.This', 'take', 'well-worn', 'Jaws', 'theme', 'out', 'place', 'Puerto', 'Vallarta', 'Mexico', 'nigh', 'super', 'prehistoric', 'dinoshark', 'things', 'taking', 'down', 'helicopter', 'jumping', 'barriers', 'are', 'unbelieveable', 'story', 'characters', 'take', 'seriously', 'viewer', 'able', 'suspend', 'belief', 'enjoy', 'flick', 'what', 'is.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'good', 'group', 'characters', 'believable', 'relationships', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'put', 'effort', 'story.Eric', 'Balfour', 'stars', 'protagonist', 'Trace', 'Iva', 'Hasperger', 'female', 'counterpart', 'Carol', 'Balfour', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'Sub-Mariner', 'Spock', 'angular', 'look', 'Iva', 'all-around', 'gorgeous', 'top', 'bottom', 'fact', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'huge', 'highlight', 'Outstanding', 'job', 'front.Bottom', 'line', 'Dinoshark', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'made-for-tv', 'nature-runs-amok', 'flick.GRADE', 'B']",Dinoshark
