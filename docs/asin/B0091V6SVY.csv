I have known about the benefits of the vegetarian diet for some time but I really didn't know how valuable until I saw my first DVD on Forks Over Knives.

1584015,A22FFXBR4U3S8X,B0091V6SVY,Michael B. Green,"[1, 1]","A little background:  I read Colin Campbell's ""The China Study"" cover-to-cover four months ago and became a vegan (again) for pragmatic reasons.  I had tried Mike Anderson's RAVE vegan diet in 2008 for 18 months but when I checked original research I found that Anderson had fudged or distorted some of his facts.  I also became vitamin D deficient with low energy and my physician advised that he had never seen a healthy long-term vegan so I switched back to a ""healthy"" mixed diet.  Campbell's book persuaded me to become vegan again and I take D and B12 supplements and eat more beans and lentils to avoid protein deficits.  After reading Linsay Nixon's review saying that even she learned so much I was looking forward to doing the same.Unfortunately, these are mostly pep talks for the choir with little useful information.  They feel like the seminar ""sell"" before you have to buy the course book with all the facts that really matter.  Campbell's talk is badly edited so that unless you have already read ""The China Study"" and know the topic he is discussing you will often be left in the dark.Dr. Esselstyn tells us that even added olive oil (presumably cold-pressed) affects the epithelial cells of the blood vessels and limit their elasticity, but... he never says how large an effect this is, whether small amounts of oil make a relevant clinical difference, whether the effect is temporary or permanent, and whether this matters for purposes of prevention or primarily for his caseload of patients with hard-core heart disease.  One wants to learn from the DVD, not have little quick hints dropped to start a wholesale research project.Psychologist Douglas Lisle (""The Pleasure Trap"") tells us that we evolved to seek pleasure, avoid pain and conserve energy but that commercial marketing has used these features to trick us into replacing a healthy natural apple with an incredibly pleasurable and energy-rich artificial chocolate apple that is not good for our health.  I say, ""That's nice, but I am already a non-dairy whole-food vegan.  Can you perhaps tell me something useful and new?""So too, I fear, go the other talks in these ""extended interviews.""  Perhaps a DVD is just not the right medium to convey information of this sort, but the film maker also made the mistake of allowing the vegan gurus to chat on without direction or guidance that could have focused them on addressing clear questions and providing answers that good vegans want to know.",3,"High on Motivation, Soft on Information",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,2472,"['little', 'background', 'read', 'Colin', 'Campbell', 'China', 'Study', 'cover-to-cover', 'four', 'months', 'ago', 'became', 'vegan', 'again', 'pragmatic', 'reasons', 'had', 'tried', 'Mike', 'Anderson', 'RAVE', 'vegan', 'diet', '2008', '18', 'months', 'when', 'checked', 'original', 'research', 'found', 'Anderson', 'had', 'fudged', 'distorted', 'facts', 'also', 'became', 'vitamin', 'D', 'deficient', 'low', 'energy', 'physician', 'advised', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'healthy', 'long-term', 'vegan', 'switched', 'back', 'healthy', 'mixed', 'diet', 'Campbell', 'book', 'persuaded', 'become', 'vegan', 'again', 'take', 'D', 'B12', 'supplements', 'eat', 'more', 'beans', 'lentils', 'avoid', 'protein', 'deficits', 'reading', 'Linsay', 'Nixon', 'review', 'saying', 'even', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'doing', 'same.Unfortunately', 'are', 'mostly', 'pep', 'talks', 'choir', 'little', 'useful', 'information', 'feel', 'seminar', 'sell', 'have', 'buy', 'course', 'book', 'facts', 'really', 'matter', 'Campbell', 'talk', 'badly', 'edited', 'so', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'China', 'Study', 'know', 'topic', 'discussing', 'will', 'often', 'be', 'left', 'dark.Dr', 'Esselstyn', 'even', 'added', 'olive', 'oil', 'presumably', 'cold-pressed', 'epithelial', 'cells', 'blood', 'vessels', 'limit', 'elasticity', 'never', 'how', 'large', 'effect', 'small', 'amounts', 'oil', 'make', 'relevant', 'clinical', 'difference', 'effect', 'temporary', 'permanent', 'matters', 'purposes', 'prevention', 'primarily', 'caseload', 'patients', 'hard-core', 'heart', 'disease', 'One', 'learn', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'little', 'quick', 'hints', 'dropped', 'start', 'wholesale', 'research', 'project.Psychologist', 'Douglas', 'Lisle', 'Pleasure', 'Trap', 'evolved', 'seek', 'pleasure', 'avoid', 'pain', 'conserve', 'energy', 'commercial', 'marketing', 'used', 'features', 'trick', 'replacing', 'healthy', 'natural', 'apple', 'incredibly', 'pleasurable', 'energy-rich', 'artificial', 'chocolate', 'apple', 'not', 'good', 'health', 'say', 'nice', 'am', 'already', 'non-dairy', 'whole-food', 'vegan', 'Can', 'perhaps', 'tell', 'something', 'useful', 'new', 'So', 'too', 'fear', 'go', 'other', 'talks', 'extended', 'interviews', 'Perhaps', 'DVD', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'medium', 'convey', 'information', 'sort', 'film', 'maker', 'also', 'made', 'mistake', 'allowing', 'vegan', 'gurus', 'chat', 'direction', 'guidance', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'addressing', 'clear', 'questions', 'providing', 'answers', 'good', 'vegans', 'want', 'know']",Forks Over Knives - The Extended Interviews
