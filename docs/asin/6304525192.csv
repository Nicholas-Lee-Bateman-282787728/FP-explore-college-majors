Bud visits a drug store and gets something for her. They talk about their future at night. ""Goodnight."" ""Love conquers all."" Bud's mother notices something wrong from his attitude. Bud meets Dorrie the next day. ""Any change?"" [Bud is on the GI Bill.] Dorrie doesn't get along with her Dad. Bud wants their relationship kept secret until after the wedding. [Does he have a plan?] Bud visits the Chemistry Lab to borrow a chemical! Was he seen? He asks Dorrie for his picture ""to make a copy"". Then he gets Dorrie to translate a note. What is his plan? Bud brings ""vitamins"" for Dorrie. [Why doesn't Bud eat a good breakfast?] The arrival of Dorrie causes him to react! They go to the rooftop for a view. ""Its beautiful.""Dorrie didn't take those pills after all. She is very happy now. ""You're very sweet"" he says. They kiss. Dorrie is given a big surprise! Some details will be kept out of the newspapers. Mr. Kingship doesn't want Dorrie's belongings. The Kingship mansion has a huge in-ground pool. Ellen gets a letter and a belt from Dorrie's sorority sister. Ellen has a date with Bud. Gordon Grant calls her. Ellen tells Gordon what she noticed and the interpretation of that note. Gordon's uncle would be interested in this case. Who was Dorrie's boyfriend? Ellen visits the college to learn about Dorrie's classmates. [Would they allow that today?] She calls the classmates and provokes a meeting. She learns of a name! But there is a surprise for him! ""Please!"" There is a shot, the police find a typewritten note. [Did he use the same typewriter?] Ellen has a boyfriend, Bud Corliss. They go horseback riding. Bud has a secret from his past. [To invoke an answer from Ellen?]They are in love. We see a chauffeur-driven Cadillac, a 32-room mansion. Bud visits with his mother. Gordon Grant arrives in his Ford, he has news about dead Dwight Powell (he was out of the country when Dorrie died). There are two murders to solve now. Gordon meets Bud Corliss. Gordon call Uncle Howard, he thinks he saw Bud with Dorrie Kingship before and wants him to be checked out. Gordon tells Mr, Dwight Kingship what he discovered. Ellen rejects this news! [Love is blind?] Ellen and Bud drive to the Kingship mines. The Police Chief confirms that Bud was Dorrie's boyfriend. They watch the gathering of ore for smelting into refined copper. Bud admits knowing Dorrie at the University. Ellen tells Bud what the police know. Are they just co-incidences? ""Only one man called her ""Dorrie"" says Ellen. The Kingship limousine approaches. A passing truck causes an accident! A just ending to this story.Was this story inspired by an actual true crime? There was an earlier movie that used a similar plot: ""A Place in the Sun"". It can serve as a tutorial about the danger of falling in love with a stranger. The 1972 movie ""Love Story"" had an idealistic version of this story, where a love affair is ended by death and not marriage.",4,Marrying a Stranger,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,3054,"['Kiss', 'Dying', '1956', 'filmA', 'college', 'student', 'rich', 'girlfriend', 'Dorrie', 'trouble', 'seen', 'doctor', 'false', 'name', 'Bud', 'drug', 'store', 'something', 'talk', 'future', 'night', 'Goodnight', 'Love', 'conquers', 'Bud', 'mother', 'notices', 'something', 'wrong', 'attitude', 'Bud', 'Dorrie', 'next', 'day', 'change', '[', 'Bud', 'GI', 'Bill', ']', 'Dorrie', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Dad', 'Bud', 'relationship', 'kept', 'secret', 'wedding', '[', 'have', 'plan', ']', 'Bud', 'Chemistry', 'Lab', 'borrow', 'chemical', 'Was', 'seen', 'Dorrie', 'picture', 'make', 'copy', 'Then', 'Dorrie', 'translate', 'note', 'What', 'plan', 'Bud', 'vitamins', 'Dorrie', '[', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Bud', 'eat', 'good', 'breakfast', 'arrival', 'Dorrie', 'react', 'go', 'rooftop', 'view', 'beautiful', 'Dorrie', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'pills', 'very', 'happy', 'now', ""'re"", 'very', 'sweet', 'kiss', 'Dorrie', 'given', 'big', 'surprise', 'details', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'newspapers', 'Mr.', 'Kingship', ""n't"", 'want', 'Dorrie', 'belongings', 'Kingship', 'mansion', 'huge', 'in-ground', 'pool', 'Ellen', 'letter', 'belt', 'Dorrie', 'sorority', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'date', 'Bud', 'Gordon', 'Grant', 'Ellen', 'Gordon', 'what', 'noticed', 'interpretation', 'note', 'Gordon', 'uncle', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'case', 'Who', 'was', 'Dorrie', 'boyfriend', 'Ellen', 'college', 'learn', 'Dorrie', 'classmates', '[', 'allow', 'today', ']', 'classmates', 'meeting', 'name', 'surprise', 'Please', 'shot', 'police', 'find', 'typewritten', 'note', '[', 'Did', 'use', 'same', 'typewriter', ']', 'Ellen', 'boyfriend', 'Bud', 'Corliss', 'go', 'horseback', 'riding', 'Bud', 'secret', 'past', '[', 'invoke', 'answer', 'Ellen', ']', 'are', 'love', 'see', 'chauffeur-driven', 'Cadillac', '32-room', 'mansion', 'Bud', 'mother', 'Gordon', 'Grant', 'Ford', 'news', 'dead', 'Dwight', 'Powell', 'was', 'country', 'when', 'Dorrie', 'died', 'are', 'two', 'murders', 'solve', 'now', 'Gordon', 'Bud', 'Corliss', 'Gordon', 'call', 'Uncle', 'Howard', 'saw', 'Bud', 'Dorrie', 'Kingship', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'Gordon', 'Mr', 'Dwight', 'Kingship', 'what', 'discovered', 'Ellen', 'news', '[', 'Love', 'blind', ']', 'Ellen', 'Bud', 'drive', 'Kingship', 'mines', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Bud', 'was', 'Dorrie', 'boyfriend', 'watch', 'gathering', 'ore', 'smelting', 'refined', 'copper', 'Bud', 'knowing', 'Dorrie', 'University', 'Ellen', 'Bud', 'what', 'police', 'know', 'Are', 'just', 'co-incidences', 'Only', 'one', 'man', 'called', 'Dorrie', 'Ellen', 'Kingship', 'limousine', 'approaches', 'passing', 'truck', 'accident', 'just', 'ending', 'story.Was', 'story', 'inspired', 'actual', 'true', 'crime', 'was', 'earlier', 'movie', 'used', 'similar', 'plot', 'Place', 'Sun', 'can', 'serve', 'tutorial', 'danger', 'falling', 'love', 'stranger', '1972', 'movie', 'Love', 'Story', 'had', 'idealistic', 'version', 'story', 'where', 'love', 'affair', 'ended', 'death', 'not', 'marriage']",A Kiss Before Dying VHS
427611,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304525192,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","`A Kiss Before Dying' tries really hard to be all things Alfred Hitchcock while lacking any of the talent or composure to create something that sacred.  It tries to establish thrills and chills through familiar scenarios and thinks that dragging out key moments will sustain dread, but all it winds up doing is wearing thin and allowing the audience to disconnect from those moments, thus losing all sense of thrill.  For example, the murder scene takes so long to commit that all shock is lost and we are left picturing the deed a good minute or so before it is actually committed.  The flirting with the obvious only works if your director is smart enough or creative enough to find ways visually to reel us in closer.  The camera never moves, the shots feel redundant and so the dread flees rather quickly, if it was ever there at all.Add to this the dreadful acting on the part of the film's lead, Robert Wagner, and you have the recipe for disaster.I find it really humorous that Joanne Woodward claimed this to be her worst film.  I actually watched this for her, because I'm a huge fan.  She claimed this not only her worst film, but one of the worst films ever made.  I have to agree.  I found nothing of merit here.  This was as pedestrian as they come, but worse than that.  It was dull and pandering.

427614,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6304525192,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[21, 23]","I always thought Robert Wagner deserved a better film career than he got, as he's an excellent actor and did a number of movies, including All the Fine Young Cannibals (1960), and The Longest Day (1962), before transitioning to television in the late 60's working on shows like It Takes A Thief and his signature role as Jonathan Hart of the Hart to Hart series.  Remember, back in the day it was looked as a major step down to go from films to television, a similar, contemporary comparison being that of working in theatrical releases and then finding yourself in direct to video market hell (Lou Diamond Phillips) or voice-overs for video games (Ray Liotta).  Work is work, I suppose, and A Kiss Before Dying (1956) is certainly one of Wagner's finer film roles, in my opinion.Based on a novel by Ira Levin (Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives), A Kiss Before Dying was directed by Gerd Oswald, one of the more prominent directors in the early days of television, working on such shows as Rawhide, Bonanza, The Outer Limits, The Fugitive, and Star Trek, to name a few.  The film stars, as I mentioned before, a very young Robert Wagner, Joanne Woodward, her next being The Three Faces of Eve (1957), Mary Astor (The Maltese Falcon), Jeffrey Hunter (The Searchers), George Macready (The Big Clock), and Virginia Leith, who saw her career bottom out six years later in the seminal sci-fi schlocker The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962).  Also appearing is Robert Quarry, who would later achieve a cult-like following for his starring role in Count Yorga, Vampire (1970) and its' follow up, The Return of Count Yorga (1971).The film opens on a young couple in a small room, the woman weeping softly on the bed, and the man looking as if to console her.  The woman's name is Dorothy Kingship (Woodward), and the man is Bud Corliss (Wagner).  As the scene presented itself, I took a wild stab in my mind as to what was going on, and I was right...the girl has learned she's pregnant, and now she's broken the news to her boyfriend.  Bud seems to offer his reassurances that he'll do right by her, and she accepts them, but to the viewer his words (and actions) seemed to be tinged by a sinister quality, one someone who is blinded by love may not notice.  We later find out Dorothy comes from money, and her father (Macready), a stern man, would look poorly on her condition, cutting off any financial support.  We later learn Bud's not so much in love with Dorothy, but the wealth her family could provide, and now that the milk from his potential cash cow has soured, due to Dorothy's condition, he must find a way to extricate himself from this situation (can you say murder?), and does so, with a great deal of meticulous, planning. Soon Dorothy's sister, Ellen, who's not convinced the evidence around her sister's death is as clear cut as the police would believe (they thought it suicide), looks into the matter herself, uncovering the well hidden tracks of a cold, ruthless killer, one who's aware of her every move, and won't let anything stand between him and what he believes is rightfully his...I really enjoyed this film...the contrast between Robert Wagner's boyish, all-American good looks and his characters' cold, relentless malevolent drive in achieving his goals was really creepy.  He was smart, charming, always seemed to know the right thing to say, and incredibly focused on the details, wary of leaving anything that might lead back to himself.  His willingness to do whatever he has to in maintaining his deception is beyond what many could even begin to fathom, even managing to keep his own mother in the dark (which is no easy task, for any of you out there with a mother should be able to attest).  Rarely have I seen such an ugly, rotten-to-the-core being hidden by such a handsome and absorbing faade, except maybe in the Omen films (especially the last one with Sam Neill).  Everyone else did reasonably well, although I felt casting Macready as the father seemed a bit too obvious, and Hunter's character, as the tutor/junior police investigator, seemed more of a plot contrivance rather than a character.  Oswald does a wonderful job directing, and while the story is slow moving at first, it worked well to allow us to really study Wagner's character, the depths of his roguish villainy, and also to set up Woodward's character for a spectacularly shocking demise (don't watch the trailer prior to watching the film, as it will spoil this).  Ahhh, but even the most meticulous of plans can come unraveled, especially those based on deception, and soon Bud finds certain loose threads may be his undoing.  The ending was theatrically sensational, although I've read that some felt it was a little too over-the-top, ill-befitting the subtle nature of the story, but I thought it was aptly appropriate given the diabolical nature of Wagner's character.  One thing that kind of puzzled me is based on Wagner's character's nature for meticulousness, I thought it strange that he should flub his initial, carefully crafted efforts by getting Dorothy pregnant.  I know sex ed wasn't focused on as much in the 50's as it may be now, but seeing as how Bud's cousin worked in a pharmacy, I would have thought obtaining prophylactics wouldn't have been that big of a deal...oh well...The widescreen picture on this DVD looks very good, although there was a strange event during a few of the outside shots resulting in a weird, yet brief `shimmer' effect (you'll know it when you see it).  I thought the audio decent, but a little too soft for my tastes, as I had to turn up the volume.  The only special feature available is an annoying, talky trailer (avoid before watching the film).Cookieman108",4,Each kiss a prelude to....DEATH!,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,5716,"['always',

427617,A2ZHZ8ZTHJKOS0,6304525192,Douglas Doepke,"[3, 4]","He may not have been James Dean, but Robert Wagner delivers a career performance in this sorely neglected sleeper from 1956. The first half is a beautifully shaded dance of death as Wagner plots to rid himself of the inconveniently pregnant Joanne Woodward. He's all sincere insincerity from one rendevous to the next, while she wants desperately to believe, even against all odds. Has there ever been a more cold-hearted manipulator of vulnerable feminine desires. Dory (Woodward) is all whiney expectations, while Wagner conceals ruthless ambition behind a pretty boy mask.Director Gerd Oswald's staging of the first half is little short of brilliant, and had the filming been in appropriate black and white, a latter day noir classic would have resulted. Notice how subtly Woodward expects a kiss atop the municipal building, the pinnacle of her girlish dreams, while Bud (Wagner) callously lights a cigarette, oblivious to her romantic longing. And what a gripping piece of morbid pathology is Wagner's slip-sliding through the chemistry lab as he prepares a toxic potion for his lady love. Maybe in the last analysis, Bud's problem lies with mother. The fixation is certainly not normal, as she senses in putting off his request for a ""date"". Yet as Bud's social climbing becomes tellingly clear, the ambitious plans are for mom too. The subtext here is a risky one for 50's popular entertainment.Unfortunately, the second half reverts to standard Hollywood convention, the suspense subsiding along with the first-rate mood music. Putting a pipe in the callow Jeffrey Hunter's mouth and making him a college professor amounts to a crippling micalculation on someone's part. Hunter's simply not the type, nor does he have the gravitas to carry the plot forward. Note the monster truck bearing down.

427618,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6304525192,Ed Uyeshima,"[10, 12]","This movie is a vivid reminder of the type of Baroque psychodrama/thriller Hollywood produced with great relish in the 1950's, and now it has been released on DVD. At the forefront back then was German-born filmmaker Douglas Sirk, whose turgid Technicolor melodramas (""Magnificent Obsession"", ""Imitation of Life"" among others) served as inspiration for Todd Haynes' recent critical hit, ""Far From Heaven"", with Julianne Moore. Another contributor to this genre was director Gerd Oswald, who filmed an early Ira Levin book (his later works include ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Stepford Wives"") in 1956 and manages to capture all the lurid elements and Freudian pop sensibilities that make this good fun to watch.A very young and dapper Robert Wagner plays a very cool and collected psychopath named Budd Corliss, who impregnates his naive girlfriend, Dorothy, played by an ingenuous Joanne Woodward in only her second film. That accident virtually guarantees her disinheritance from her wealthy, taciturn father, and so Budd spends the first half of the story plotting her murder ensuring her death will look like a suicide. The story telegraphs the inevitable event for quite a while, and the scenes that lead to it are tensely effective culminating in a camera-savvy push from a rooftop that is visually stunning. Similar to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (and predating that classic by four years), the story shifts perspective to her sister Ellen and a detective who try to put the pieces together to figure out who murdered Dorothy. The twists in this part of the film include a tennis pro who is too helpful to Ellen for his own good, and Ellen herself, ignorant of Budd's previous relationship with Dorothy, begins an affair with Budd. Contrived? You bet. But the story is filled with such tension and twists that it is difficult to pull away once you get hooked.Wagner has never been the most resourceful of actors, but he nails this part with his impassive detachment, an interesting precursor to Matt Damon's Tom Ripley. Woodward makes an impression, but she is really only called upon to play a smitten coed you know will not survive. A rather wooden contract player named Virginia Leith plays Ellen in a manner that reminded me of Cary Grant's honey-voiced actress wife, Betsy Drake.  Jeffrey Hunter seems rather confused playing the detective, and Mary Astor is sadly given very little to do as Budd's subtly grasping mother (I wish they fleshed this aspect out more to explain Budd's psychosis).  Of course, it all ends precariously on the ledge of a limestone mine, as Ellen fights off Budd to save her own life. Avoid the 1991 remake with Matt Dillon and Sean Young unbelievably playing both sisters, as this is the one that will provide you with silly melodramatic fun.",3,Psychopath Entwined With Two Sisters in Effective Thriller,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2780,"['movie', 'vivid', 'reminder', 'type', 'Baroque', 'psychodrama/thriller', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'great', 'relish', '1950', 'now', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'forefront', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'German-born', 'filmmaker', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'turgid', 'Technicolor', 'melodramas', 'Magnificent', 'Obsession', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'others', 'served', 'inspiration', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'recent', 'critical', 'hit', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'contributor', 'genre', 'was', 'director', 'Gerd', 'Oswald', 'who', 'filmed', 'early', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'book', 'later', 'include', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Stepford', 'Wives', '1956', 'capture', 'lurid', 'elements', 'Freudian', 'pop', 'sensibilities', 'make', 'good', 'fun', 'watch.A', 'very', 'young', 'dapper', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'very', 'cool', 'collected', 'psychopath', 'named', 'Budd', 'Corliss', 'who', 'naive', 'girlfriend', 'Dorothy', 'played', 'ingenuous', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'accident', 'virtually', 'disinheritance', 'wealthy', 'taciturn', 'father', 'so', 'Budd', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'plotting', 'murder', 'ensuring', 'death', 'will', 'look', 'suicide', 'story', 'inevitable', 'event', 'quite', 'while', 'scenes', 'lead', 'are', 'tensely', 'effective', 'culminating', 'camera-savvy', 'push', 'rooftop', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Similar', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'predating', 'classic', 'four', 'years', 'story', 'shifts', 'perspective', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'detective', 'who', 'try', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'murdered', 'Dorothy', 'twists', 'part', 'film', 'include', 'tennis', 'pro', 'who', 'too', 'helpful', 'Ellen', 'own', 'good', 'Ellen', 'ignorant', 'Budd', 'previous', 'relationship', 'Dorothy', 'affair', 'Budd', 'Contrived', 'bet', 'story', 'filled', 'such', 'tension', 'difficult', 'pull', 'away', 'once', 'get', 'never', 'been', 'most', 'resourceful', 'actors', 'part', 'impassive', 'detachment', 'interesting', 'precursor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'Woodward', 'impression', 'really', 'only', 'called', 'upon', 'play', 'smitten', 'coed', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'survive', 'rather', 'wooden', 'contract', 'player', 'named', 'Virginia', 'Leith', 'Ellen', 'manner', 'reminded', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'honey-voiced', 'actress', 'wife', 'Betsy', 'Drake', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'rather', 'confused', 'playing', 'detective', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'sadly', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'Budd', 'subtly', 'grasping', 'mother', 'wish', 'fleshed', 'aspect', 'out', 'more', 'explain', 'Budd', 'psychosis', 'course', 'precariously', 'ledge', 'limestone', 'mine', 'Ellen', 'fights', 'off', 'Budd', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'Avoid', '1991', 'remake', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Sean', 'Young', 'unbelievably', 'playing', 'sisters', 'one', 'will', 'provide', 'silly', 'melodramatic', 'fun']",A Kiss Before Dying VHS

427622,AJNW2SVETWAW1,6304525192,kacunnin,"[3, 3]","`A Kiss Before Dying' (1956) is a passable adaptation of Ira Levin's novel (his first, coming years before `Rosemary's Baby' and `Stepford Wives').  The story involves callous gold-digger Bud Corliss (Robert Wagner) who makes the unfortunate mistake of knocking up his heiress girlfriend Dorie Kingship (Joanne Woodward, in her first credited role) before he can meet her father and solidify his piece of the family fortune.  Bud's plans for Dorie reveal him as more than a little bit sociopathic, but ultimately his inability to get the Kingship money out of his mind proves his undoing.The first half of the film is better than its concluding scenes - both Wagner and Woodward are fine as would-be college sweethearts, and the initial murder scene is both creepy and believable.  Later scenes and characters are not - including Virginia Leith (who seems oddly stiff and detached as Dorie's sister Ellen), Jeffrey Hunter (who's unconvincing as part-time police investigator Gordon Grant), George Macready (who plays patriarch Leo Kingship as a one-dimensional autocrat), and a ridiculous mid-film murder (with the victim literally sitting at his desk, begging pitifully, while the murderer debates which side of his head would be best for the bullet).  The film was billed as a ""noir"" murder mystery, but its bright color pallet and zippy score make it seem too upbeat for that genre.For those who have read the novel, this adaptation cuts out the third Kingship sister, which is a shame (since that also means we miss one of the novel's more interesting murders, as well as its final twist).  More of a problem, however, is the lack of the background information on Bud Corliss provided in the novel - including his childhood, relationship with his mother, and his growing obsession with Kingship Copper.  Wagner's Bud is a pretty-boy without a heart, but also without clear motivation for his actions.  The novel's twist (coming at about the half-way point in the story) translates fairly well to the screen, however - especially since Robert Wagner was not a big star at the time the film was made (you'll know what I mean once you've seen the film!).It's worth a viewing . . . and it's MUCH better than the dreadful 1991 remake (with Matt Dillon and world's-worst-actress Sean Young).",3,Worth watching,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,2289,"['Kiss', 'Dying', '1956', 'passable', 'adaptation', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'novel', 'first', 'coming', 'years', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'story', 'callous', 'gold-digger', 'Bud', 'Corliss', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'who', 'unfortunate', 'mistake', 'knocking', 'up', 'heiress', 'girlfriend', 'Dorie', 'Kingship', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'first', 'credited', 'role', 'can', 'meet', 'father', 'solidify', 'piece', 'family', 'fortune', 'Bud', 'plans', 'Dorie', 'reveal', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'sociopathic', 'ultimately', 'inability', 'get', 'Kingship', 'money', 'mind', 'undoing.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'better', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'Wagner', 'Woodward', 'are', 'fine', 'would-be', 'college', 'sweethearts', 'initial', 'murder', 'scene', 'creepy', 'believable', 'Later', 'scenes', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'including', 'Virginia', 'Leith', 'who', 'oddly', 'stiff', 'detached', 'Dorie', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'who', 'unconvincing', 'part-time', 'police', 'investigator', 'Gordon', 'Grant', 'George', 'Macready', 'who', 'patriarch', 'Leo', 'Kingship', 'one-dimensional', 'autocrat', 'ridiculous', 'mid-film', 'murder', 'victim', 'literally', 'sitting', 'desk', 'begging', 'pitifully', 'murderer', 'side', 'head', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'bullet', 'film', 'was', 'billed', 'noir', 'murder', 'mystery', 'bright', 'color', 'pallet', 'zippy', 'score', 'make', 'seem', 'too', 'upbeat', 'genre.For', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'out', 'third', 'Kingship', 'sister', 'shame', 'also', 'miss', 'one', 'novel', 'more', 'interesting', 'murders', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'twist', 'More', 'problem', 'however', 'lack', 'background', 'information', 'Bud', 'Corliss', 'provided', 'novel', 'including', 'childhood', 'relationship', 'mother', 'growing', 'obsession', 'Kingship', 'Copper', 'Wagner', 'Bud', 'pretty-boy', 'heart', 'also', 'clear', 'motivation', 'actions', 'novel', 'twist', 'coming', 'half-way', 'point', 'story', 'fairly', 'well', 'screen', 'however', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'star', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', '.It', 'worth', 'viewing', 'MUCH', 'better', 'dreadful', '1991', 'remake', 'Matt', 'Dillon', ""world's-worst-actress"", 'Sean', 'Young']",A Kiss Before Dying VHS

(So, if you subscribe to NF, DON'T read their description before you watch this film.While not perfect, this is a great thriller. It is an open mystery. Netflix calls it a film noir, but it's not really in the film noir style. There are fewer missteps or false notes in this film than most. Robert Wagner seems not very honorable from the opening scene. Poor Dory (Joanne Woodward) is so blinded by her love for him, that she doesn't see how calculating Wagner is. We in the audience see it and we watch as she gets in deeper and deeper and Wagner gets more and more desperate and despicable. Except for the title, it would be easy to think from the opening scenes &#34;A Kiss Before Dying&#34; is a coming of age soap opera, but fifteen minutes into the movie, there's no question where this is going and that Wagner is up to no good.The color cinematography is great. The music by Lionel Newman and Nelson Riddle starts off rather lighthearted and gets darker and darker as the movie progresses.

427629,A2A1XYSB692L6J,6304525192,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[0, 0]","A nifty little movie, with ROBERT WAGNER acting as a handsome, no-good guy, who only wants to marry for money.  His working-class momis played by classic actress MARY ASTOR, and she is very good hereAS a working-class mom -- very, very different from her role in""The Maltese Falcon""!  JOANNE WOODWARD is pleasant and convincingas the naive rich girl who gets pregnant by Wagner's character, andis ultimately killed by her.  Woodward's sister, is shown to besmart and active in trying to find out her sister's murderer....somuch for the myth of the ""idle rich"".  Sadly, though, Woodward'ssister jumps to the wrong conclusions......and gets into a lot oftrouble, because of it.An aside....  It's interesting to note that ALL the young people in this movie seem to go to a LOCAL college.  No dorms here.  Joanne Woodward's character, and that of her sister, are RICH young women, but they, too, go to this local, communter-college.  Maybe this is one way their father gets richer -- and why not?  Going to and from college every day by car -- or even chauffeured limosine, (which the rich girls in this movie do NOT do), is still cheaper than going to a ""sleep-away"" college.  So this 1956 movie has unexpected, (and probably unintended) -- but nonetheless, very GOOD advice -- for 21st century college students looking to save money!For some reason, however, Turner Classic Movies calls this a ""comedy-drama.""  It IS a (superb!) drama -- but there is NO comedy here,at least that I can see!The scenes of the family mansion are wonderful -- and the Blackmaid and butler are shown to be intelligent, and feeling, humanbeings.  This movie is written, acted, photographed, and directedsuperbly.  It is one of the best movies of 1956, in my opinion --and it should be better known, to a wider public!",5,C L A S S I C.....B U T.....U N D E R V I E W E D,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,1793,"['nifty', 'little', 'movie', 'ROBERT', 'WAGNER', 'acting', 'handsome', 'no-good', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'marry', 'money', 'working-class', 'momis', 'played', 'classic', 'actress', 'MARY', 'ASTOR', 'very', 'good', 'hereAS', 'working-class', 'mom', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'role', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'JOANNE', 'WOODWARD', 'pleasant', 'naive', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'pregnant', 'Wagner', 'character', 'ultimately', 'killed', 'Woodward', 'sister', 'shown', 'besmart', 'active', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'sister', 'murderer', '.somuch', 'myth', 'idle', 'rich', 'Sadly', ""Woodward'ssister"", 'wrong', 'conclusions', 'lot', 'oftrouble', 'it.An', 'aside', 'interesting', 'note', 'young', 'people', 'movie', 'seem', 'go', 'LOCAL', 'college', 'dorms', 'here', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'character', 'sister', 'are', 'RICH', 'young', 'women', 'too', 'go', 'local', 'communter-college', 'Maybe', 'one', 'way', 'father', 'richer', 'why', 'not', 'Going', 'college', 'day', 'car', 'even', 'chauffeured', 'limosine', 'rich', 'girls', 'movie', 'do', 'NOT', 'do', 'still', 'cheaper', 'going', 'sleep-away', 'college', 'So', '1956', 'movie', 'unexpected', 'probably', 'unintended', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'GOOD', 'advice', '21st', 'century', 'college', 'students', 'looking', 'save', 'money', 'reason', 'however', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'comedy-drama', 'superb', 'drama', 'comedy', 'here', 'least', 'can', 'see', 'scenes', 'family', 'mansion', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Blackmaid', 'butler', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'intelligent', 'feeling', 'humanbeings', 'movie', 'written', 'acted', 'photographed', 'directedsuperbly', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '1956', 'opinion', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'wider', 'public']",A Kiss Before Dying VHS

427631,A18A3H566K45D9,6304525192,"Terry D. Robertson ""Terry D. Robertson""","[1, 3]","The always superb Joanne Woodward is seen all too briefly in this 1956 pre-fame movie. She was shown to much better advantage the same year in ""Count Three and Pray"". Here, the wonderful Joanne is the pregnant victim to Robert Wagner, a self-stylized gold digger. First he tries to push her down a flight of stars at the college stadium, then poison her. He forces her to translate a Spanish to English note that reads as a suicide letter and mails it off, thinking he has succeeded killing her with ""super potent vitamins"". Wen she shows up to class, he becomes unglued. He has mailed the death note out to her wealthy father. He concocts a scheme to marry her and the couple go to the tallest building in town deliberately early before the license bureau is open. Woodward adores him and agrees to go on the roof of the 12 story building where Wagner proceeds to push her off. Then I lost interest. Woodward would have been seen to better advantage in the female lead, the sister played by Virgina Leith. And who is she? She would have been believable as Wagner's mother, played by the often wasted but always magnificent Mary Astor. Here again, two talents never really given the screen time to enthrall you. But in Woodward's (and Astor's) short performances, they are the only redeeming value in this classic Ira Levin novella. This is far superior to the remake, but Wagner is just too much of a ""pretty boy"" to play a cold blooded cad and his star presence isn't strong enough to hold the picture on the merits of his performance.Fortunately for the great Woodward, the next year she would win an Leading Female Oscar (among other awards) for ""The Three Faces of Eve"" in a bravura performance (originally turned down by Susan Hayward), and would become a household name. And her atrocious short hair in this movie does not do her beauty justice. I have watched several pre-fame performances by this icon, and in her short third of this movie, she captivates the audience.This could have been a better movie if she had more screen time. It had all the makings of a wonderful flick, but the flaws of some of the other performers mar what could have been a great movie. It is still rightfully considered a cult classic, but Wagner is way out of his league here.Terry D.

Gerd Oswald directed many of the best episodes of The Outer Limits but never made much impact on the big screen, and at times this is a little too conventional in its approach to its once taboo subject matter, although he makes a surprisingly decent stab at the unfilmable twist from Ira Levin's novel. But there's still the feeling that he gets more mileage out of the first half of the film, as Robert Wagner's All-American working class psycho finds his plans to marry into money shattered by an unplanned pregnancy (thrown away almost entirely in the remake) than the amateur detective work of the second half. Jeffrey Hunter's stiff turn as the eternally pipe-smoking square doesn't help matters much, but it's still worth seeing at least once.
