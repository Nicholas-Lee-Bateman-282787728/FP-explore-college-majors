979100,A2VV4JWNKCQHF0,B000EUKRIQ,Basbenee,"[30, 30]","This is a nice little dvd. Leandros gives basic rundowns of a number of dance styles: Bellydance, bellydance shimmies, samba, salsa, bollywood, flamenco.She gives decent instruction on how to do popular steps and moves with each type of dance, and explains, for example, bellydance moves are more isolated. She shows examples of wrong moves, too, which is just as helpful as seeing moves done the right way.She dresses in simple shirt and flowy pants, so the moves are not obscured by a flashy costume, and she does the instructional moves in front of a mirror so the viewer automatically gets another viewpoint. During the workout portion, she has two girls dancing with her in the background (though I believe there are four and they are substituted for various styles, edited in, if you will, as all have long dark hair and more olive-skinned complexions, such as the girl who looks like she has more of an Indian heritage is in the background of the bollywood segment) , and their moves are a little toned down, so novices can eyeball their moves as a guide.The dance segments can be done all one after another or you can customize what order you want or what you want to skip or repeat. The tutorials are one section of the dvd, and you can jump around those, too, to focus on one more than another, and the lessons can be a workout in themselves. But it's nice that you can customize your workout to do whatever in whichever order you wish, so it's nice to be able to, for example, do 8 minutes of samba and 7 minutes of flamenco if you want a quickie, which is what I like about the DVD.She has a warmup (which is mostly bellydance inspired moves, but you get a good stretch and warmup with them) and a cooldown (again, mostly bellydance inspired) and you can watch her dance in different costumes to the styles featured on the dvd. On this I just want to say I wish she had chosen not to dance in that dress which looks like a crazy craft project, some sheath with pom-poms of many colors attached. It only makes me think of fabric store scraps,dollar grab bags for kids and hot-glue guns and not particularly of dance.If you're well versed in most forms of dance you may not find this helpful, but if you want a bit of variety in workouts and want to learn a few salsa, samba, flamenco, etc., moves, this is a good place to start. If you feel like you have two left feet it's also a good place to start, making what may have seemed impossible a little easier to grasp. And I like the option that you can work out to the music alone, as the selection is very good, and it's nice to hear the different styles and dance along to just music and forget about the voiceover once you get used to the moves.I only have a couple of complaints: One, her bellydancing is by no means the greatest. (I can't judge Latin dance styles so well, but the bellydance lacks something, fluidity perhaps -- compare Elsa's dance to someone like Jillina's, for example, and it's leagues apart). Two, her facial expressions are a bit distracting, as she looks a bit crazed during some segments, like the bollywood part, where her face almost looks masklike and forced, and smiles way too hard sometimes, to the point where it looks painful. I imagine she fancies herself looking theatrical and getting into the spirit of things, but for me it took a bit to get past it.But overall,I really enjoy this dvd. If I'm feeling lazy I do a segment and get a jolt of energy, and doing the whole thing feels good just to move for the better part of an hour and I get to have a bit of fun in my basement.",5,A chance to dance,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,3578,"['nice', 'little', 'dvd', 'Leandros', 'basic', 'rundowns', 'number', 'dance', 'styles', 'Bellydance', 'bellydance', 'shimmies', 'samba', 'salsa', 'bollywood', 'flamenco.She', 'decent', 'instruction', 'how', 'do', 'popular', 'steps', 'moves', 'type', 'dance', 'explains', 'example', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'are', 'more', 'isolated', 'examples', 'wrong', 'moves', 'too', 'just', 'as', 'helpful', 'seeing', 'moves', 'done', 'right', 'way.She', 'simple', 'shirt', 'flowy', 'pants', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'obscured', 'flashy', 'costume', 'instructional', 'moves', 'front', 'mirror', 'viewer', 'automatically', 'viewpoint', 'workout', 'portion', 'two', 'girls', 'dancing', 'background', 'believe', 'are', 'four', 'are', 'substituted', 'various', 'styles', 'edited', 'will', 'have', 'long', 'dark', 'hair', 'more', 'olive-skinned', 'complexions', 'such', 'girl', 'who', 'more', 'Indian', 'heritage', 'background', 'bollywood', 'segment', 'moves', 'are', 'little', 'toned', 'down', 'novices', 'can', 'eyeball', 'moves', 'guide.The', 'dance', 'segments', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'one', 'can', 'customize', 'what', 'order', 'want', 'what', 'want', 'skip', 'repeat', 'tutorials', 'are', 'one', 'section', 'dvd', 'can', 'jump', 'too', 'focus', 'one', 'more', 'lessons', 'can', 'be', 'workout', 'nice', 'can', 'customize', 'workout', 'do', 'whatever', 'whichever', 'order', 'wish', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'example', 'do', '8', 'minutes', 'samba', '7', 'minutes', 'flamenco', 'want', 'quickie', 'what', 'like', 'DVD.She', 'warmup', 'mostly', 'bellydance', 'inspired', 'moves', 'get', 'good', 'stretch', 'warmup', 'cooldown', 'again', 'mostly', 'bellydance', 'inspired', 'can', 'watch', 'dance', 'different', 'costumes', 'styles', 'featured', 'dvd', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'wish', 'had', 'chosen', 'not', 'dance', 'dress', 'crazy', 'craft', 'project', 'sheath', 'pom-poms', 'many', 'colors', 'attached', 'only', 'think', 'fabric', 'store', 'scraps', 'dollar', 'grab', 'bags', 'kids', 'hot-glue', 'guns', 'not', 'particularly', 'dance.If', ""'re"", 'well', 'versed', 'most', 'forms', 'dance', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'helpful', 'want', 'bit', 'variety', 'workouts', 'want', 'learn', 'few', 'salsa', 'samba', 'flamenco', 'etc.', 'moves', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'feel', 'have', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'also', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'making', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'impossible', 'little', 'easier', 'grasp', 'like', 'option', 'can', 'work', 'out', 'music', 'alone', 'selection', 'very', 'good', 'nice', 'hear', 'different', 'styles', 'dance', 'just', 'music', 'forget', 'voiceover', 'once', 'get', 'used', 'moves.I', 'only', 'have', 'couple', 'complaints', 'One', 'bellydancing', 'greatest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'Latin', 'dance', 'styles', 'so', 'well', 'bellydance', 'something', 'fluidity', 'perhaps', 'compare', 'Elsa', 'dance', 'someone', 'Jillina', 'example', 'leagues', 'apart', 'Two', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'bit', 'distracting', 'bit', 'crazed', 'segments', 'bollywood', 'part', 'where', 'face', 'almost', 'masklike', 'forced', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'point', 'where', 'painful', 'imagine', 'looking', 'theatrical', 'getting', 'spirit', 'things', 'took', 'bit', 'get', 'past', 'it.But', 'overall', 'really', 'enjoy', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'lazy', 'do', 'segment', 'get', 'jolt', 'energy', 'doing', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'good', 'just', 'move', 'better', 'part', 'hour', 'get', 'have', 'bit', 'fun', 'basement']","The World Dance Workout, with Elsa Leandros: Bellydance, Salsa, Samba, Flamenco, and Bollywood dance exercise"

I teach a belly dance class, and thought it would be fun to add a little Bollywood. I've been studying flamenco/gypsy dance for a little while, and hoped this DVD would augment that knowledge. And I've always wanted to learn the basics of Latin dance, so this DVD seemed just right.Well, what a letdown. Elsa's belly dance technique would give any of the instructors I've had a heart attack, particularly those who take Egyptian style seriously. As mentioned, I'm just learning flamenco/gypsy, but my instructor is a phenomenal dancer, and I trust her technique. Elsa definitely has a different style...and I wasn't impressed. Her approach is just a few steps too far from authentic. I was so stunned by her...shall we say, ""unique"" approach to belly dance and flamenco that I'm afraid to consider learning any of the other styles she dances, lest I learn a new dance form in a totally inappropriate manner.As for the performance dances...I asked my husband to watch the belly dance segment. His first comment was, ""Her hands are really floppy, totally ugly."" (And all he knows about the dance is what he's picked up by being around me!) He watched a bit longer, then said, ""Is she supposed to be a professional? 'Cause she's awful, really bad.""Sadly, I have to agree. The veil sequence is just Elsa turning, and turning, and turning. And her hands really, truly are limp and uninspired. Maybe the overall routine is repetitive because she hopes to show that you can put together a routine by repeating the same movements over and over again, with just slight variations. Unfortunately, the truth is that, if you *do* put together a routine with the same movements, over and over, it gets repetitive! The Bollywood dance is just plain boring, it's so repetitive. I didn't have the heart to ask my husband to critique it.That said, I have one positive comment. I love that Elsa doesn't have a so-called ""perfect"" body, and she makes no apologies. You go, Elsa!There's someone for every DVD, and I'm sure there's someone for whom this DVD is just right. If you'd like a different, dance-based workout -- with the knowledge that you won't be learning correct, authentic technique in at least two of the forms -- this video could be just the ticket. If you'd like to learn something about belly dance or flamenco, steer clear of this DVD.",2,Definitely disappointed...,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,2557,"[""'ll"", 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'can', 'see', 'specific', 'audience', 'whom', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'right.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'belly', 'dancing', 'several', 'years', 'now', ""'m"", 'professional', 'dancer', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'dance', 'form', 'teach', 'belly', 'dance', 'class', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'add', 'little', 'Bollywood', ""'ve"", 'been', 'studying', 'flamenco/gypsy', 'dance', 'little', 'while', 'hoped', 'DVD', 'would', 'augment', 'knowledge', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'learn', 'basics', 'Latin', 'dance', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'just', 'right.Well', 'what', 'letdown', 'Elsa', 'belly', 'dance', 'technique', 'would', 'give', 'instructors', ""'ve"", 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'particularly', 'who', 'take', 'Egyptian', 'style', 'seriously', 'mentioned', ""'m"", 'just', 'learning', 'flamenco/gypsy', 'instructor', 'phenomenal', 'dancer', 'trust', 'technique', 'Elsa', 'definitely', 'different', 'style', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'approach', 'just', 'few', 'steps', 'too', 'far', 'authentic', 'was', 'so', 'stunned', 'shall', 'say', 'unique', 'approach', 'belly', 'dance', 'flamenco', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'consider', 'learning', 'other', 'styles', 'lest', 'learn', 'new', 'dance', 'form', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'manner.As', 'performance', 'dances', 'asked', 'husband', 'watch', 'belly', 'dance', 'segment', 'first', 'comment', 'was', 'hands', 'are', 'really', 'floppy', 'totally', 'ugly', 'dance', 'what', 'picked', 'up', 'being', 'watched', 'bit', 'longer', 'then', 'said', 'supposed', 'be', 'professional', 'awful', 'really', 'bad', 'Sadly', 'have', 'agree', 'veil', 'sequence', 'just', 'Elsa', 'turning', 'turning', 'turning', 'hands', 'really', 'are', 'limp', 'uninspired', 'Maybe', 'overall', 'routine', 'repetitive', 'show', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'routine', 'repeating', 'same', 'movements', 'over', 'again', 'just', 'slight', 'variations', 'Unfortunately', 'truth', '*do*', 'put', 'together', 'routine', 'same', 'movements', 'repetitive', 'Bollywood', 'dance', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'so', 'repetitive', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'ask', 'husband', 'critique', 'it.That', 'said', 'have', 'one', 'positive', 'comment', 'love', 'Elsa', ""n't"", 'have', 'so-called', 'perfect', 'body', 'apologies', 'go', 'Elsa', 'someone', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'whom', 'DVD', 'just', 'right', ""'d"", 'like', 'different', 'dance-based', 'workout', 'knowledge', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'learning', 'correct', 'authentic', 'technique', 'least', 'two', 'forms', 'video', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'ticket', ""'d"", 'like', 'learn', 'something', 'belly', 'dance', 'flamenco', 'steer', 'clear', 'DVD']","The World Dance Workout, with Elsa Leandros: Bellydance, Salsa, Samba, Flamenco, and Bollywood dance exercise"

It was easy to see her body movements without feeling like watching a stripper.Two minor things that I found annoying about this video:1. The instructor doesn't talk at all, she has a plastic smile and gestures with her hands like an airline stewardess while a voice narrates what to do.  (But the voiceover does give clear cues).2.

There are a few key moves from each style of dance shown and drilled with a great selection of upbeat music.  Don't expect to become a dancing diva from this DVD because the variety of moves is small, but it IS so much fun.  The steps are simple enough throughout all of the styles for even a klutz like me to follow, though it will take some practice.  I should think it would be good for people interested in dance fitness but scared of some of the choreography out there.  As far as features go, I like that you can pick your own sections and that there is a separate section for learning the steps.  It is also wonderful that you have the option of turning the narration off.  Once you watch an exercise DVD so often and learn it by heart, it is nice to be able to go along with music only.  One negative to this DVD is that I think Elsa has appalling form sometimes.  Her hip movements are very big and very bouncy which can be troublesome for your lower back.  Her students, however, stay more understated and move more safely, so it's best emulate them.  Worth the money for people who enjoy dancing but need simpler movements than usually available in these types of programs.

If nothing else, hey, the demonstrations would be worth the money, right?It's my habit to always view the demonstrations first to get an idea of the instructor's style.  In this case, it was a mistake.  The demonstrations are set against a solid black background.  In the Bollywood and flamenco portions, half of her body just blends right into the non-existent background!  The remainder of her body appears (shallow as it seems) to be in a shape that is uninspiring in a fitness video.  It's nice to see some change from hardbodies, but her costumes do not flatter her fitness level and in the case of Bollywood and samba in particular appear to have been designed for someone much younger with very poor taste.  (Honestly.  Yarn balls?)  She doesn't seem engaged in most of the dances and doesn't have the fluidity that you'd expect to see in someone with her advertised experience.In the warmup portion, she appears old and tired much of the time.  She calls moves without having explained them, so it helps to watch the DVD at least once before attempting to follow it.  The angle is set and kind of awkward for much of the warmup, somewhere between a full-front and front-left, and it makes it difficult to see the mechanics of some of the moves.  Her assistants frequently lost her rhythm.To be honest, by the end of the warmup, I was so disgusted that I just stopped the DVD and went on to something else.
