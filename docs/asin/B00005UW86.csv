686359,ADJBUPS8SJHTC,B00005UW86,"thesavvybamalady ""swblkdiamond""","[27, 29]","I loved this film; I kind of wish it would get the Oscars; Unfortunately, it was originally aired on TV: You have these two boys born on the same day; One is black and the other is white; They hook up and become the best of friends; Yet, this is 1940s Georgia; And the black boy's sister gets pregnant presumably by her white employer, then someone turns up dead and things get right ugly. Dean Cain plays the sheriff, who just coming back from WW2, wants to see the right thing done, yet, the prejudices of the time seem to want to stay the same although clearly, times were a-changing; Maya Angelou has a pivotal role as a seer; You can't help but love watching her especially when she hollers ""Justice Is Served"" in the courtroom. Debbie Morgan, a great yet underrated actress has the role of the black boy's mother; And a performance she gives indeed. A good Hallmark movie indeed;",5,One of the best that Hallmark has put out,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,885,"['loved', 'film', 'kind', 'wish', 'would', 'get', 'Oscars', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'TV', 'have', 'two', 'boys', 'born', 'same', 'day', 'One', 'black', 'other', 'white', 'hook', 'up', 'become', 'best', 'friends', '1940s', 'Georgia', 'black', 'boy', 'sister', 'pregnant', 'presumably', 'white', 'employer', 'then', 'someone', 'up', 'dead', 'things', 'get', 'right', 'ugly', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'sheriff', 'who', 'just', 'coming', 'back', 'WW2', 'see', 'right', 'thing', 'done', 'yet', 'prejudices', 'time', 'seem', 'want', 'stay', 'same', 'clearly', 'times', 'were', 'a-changing', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'pivotal', 'role', 'seer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'watching', 'especially', 'when', 'Justice', 'Served', 'courtroom', 'Debbie', 'Morgan', 'great', 'yet', 'underrated', 'actress', 'role', 'black', 'boy', 'mother', 'performance', 'indeed', 'good', 'Hallmark', 'movie', 'indeed']",N/A
