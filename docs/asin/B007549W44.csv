I did not think it was on DVD, but I checked Amazon one day, and was pleased to find it offered, just when I was looking for a gift for my husband.He has been delighted to see the old shows, with scripts that stand the test of time. The ensemble cast drives episodes that are about good writing, understated acting, without the gimmicks and car chases of many of the more current dramas.We now have two full seasons, and likely will add more. It has become part of our routine to watch an episode every night or two. If you remember the series, I need so no more. If you do not, you have missed a look at what the FBI used to be about - getting the bad guys.",5,TV FBI series wins the test of time,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,758,"['When', 'husband', 'started', 'speaking', 'fondly', 'old', 'TV', 'shows', 'top', 'list', 'was', 'FBI', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'DVD', 'checked', 'Amazon', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'pleased', 'find', 'offered', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'looking', 'gift', 'husband.He', 'been', 'delighted', 'see', 'old', 'shows', 'scripts', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'drives', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'writing', 'understated', 'acting', 'gimmicks', 'car', 'chases', 'many', 'more', 'current', 'dramas.We', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'full', 'seasons', 'likely', 'will', 'add', 'more', 'become', 'part', 'routine', 'watch', 'episode', 'night', 'two', 'remember', 'series', 'need', 'so', 'no', 'more', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'missed', 'look', 'what', 'FBI', 'used', 'be', 'getting', 'bad', 'guys']",The FBI: The Second Season Part One

1526533,A25MWJEGBTTYD9,B007549W44,DVD Collector,"[0, 1]","I cannot understand why the F.B.I series gets so many five stars.Admittedly the series has some good actors and decent scipts, but a lot of what I have seen lacks action.  But the most disappointing of all and what really ruins the watching is the terrible oversaturation of the Red and Blue colours. Surely Warner Bros must know this.My first experience of this was when I bought the : FBI: Season One, Part One.  I thought then that it was just that set. I have today received - Part One, Second Season -  and that is just the same. Th actors faces are almost Orange in colour. All in all a terrible transfer, a pity because the picture transfer is sharp and the audio is good.I definitely will not buy more, which is a pity because I liked the acting and actors of the era.",3,Oversaturated Colours,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,776,"['can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'F.B.I', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'five', 'stars.Admittedly', 'series', 'good', 'actors', 'decent', 'scipts', 'lot', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'lacks', 'action', 'most', 'disappointing', 'what', 'really', 'watching', 'terrible', 'oversaturation', 'Red', 'Blue', 'colours', 'Surely', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'must', 'know', 'first', 'experience', 'was', 'when', 'bought', 'FBI', 'Season', 'One', 'Part', 'One', 'thought', 'then', 'was', 'just', 'set', 'have', 'today', 'received', 'Part', 'One', 'Second', 'Season', 'just', 'same', 'Th', 'actors', 'are', 'almost', 'Orange', 'colour', 'terrible', 'transfer', 'pity', 'picture', 'transfer', 'sharp', 'audio', 'good.I', 'definitely', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'more', 'pity', 'liked', 'acting', 'actors', 'era']",The FBI: The Second Season Part One

Living in a heavily digitised world today my work day is spent primarily in front of a computer screen, and whilst I appreciate the incredible capabilities of technology, it is sometimes nice to go home to television's past. ""The FBI"" is certainly one show that I have been enjoying immensely.  Both Amazon's CreateSpace and TV MOD technology bringing us the good fortune of reliving our old TV favourites is nothing short of spectacular.  BIG BRAVOS go out to all participating Studios and Amazon for enabling this to happen.PS. Warner Archive Collection has just announced the availability of ""The FBI"" Third Season.
