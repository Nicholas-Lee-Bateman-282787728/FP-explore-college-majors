Episodes 1-4 look like the standard martial arts (modern day) anime, with unwilling or unwitting participants battling for the prize.

(Just so you know if you expected otherwise). The fifth episode turns it in a new direction that I won't go into to keep the surprise intact.

1354786,A1LXMEHG1LLXVQ,B003NE8B5Q,Chase Marshall,"[1, 1]","Alright, so just got finished watching this on Netflix.  Actually had wanted to buy it because it sounded like a light hearted entertaining watch with only five episodes of fan service fighting.  So I wasn't expecting much going into it, and through the first four episodes I basically got what I expected.  And actually enjoyed the first four episodes and the simple plot of women being sent to fight each other and whoever wins gets their wish granted.  The main character Aya gets drawn in by wanting to find this girl Miko who disappears after having literally just met her.  Thought that was shaky, but for a five episode show I let it slide.Then we get to the end of episode three where it seems that the leader running the Martial Heart is the boy Aya has been crushing on forever.  We get through episode four which was fine though I felt it was choppy at the very end when they just kinda gloss over the time between the third to last and semi-final fight.  And then we get the WTF final episode.  Wont lie, I expected Aya to win and there would probably be some kinda surprise with the girl Miko about whether she was alive or not.  But it went SO far beyond that that the end just became a wtf nonsensical half hour(or well 24 minutes, whatever).I'm all for dark stories and everything, as well as twists but this was just so messed up.  I mean the only hint of anything really was Aya's fighting where she seemed to almost become a different person.  She even brings it up once in episode 2 or 3 but otherwise doesn't bother with it, okay in kicking the crap outta the competition if it means finding this girl she apparently cares so much about despite having just met her.  Anyway the ending was so far out of left field that it came out of the left field of an entirely different field across town.Anyway, Aya wins after the psychic semi-finalist harps on her about how pathetic she is and how she has evil inside her.  So then Aya starts glowing with a dark aura and totally takes her out.  Then Miko shows up acting totally fine, and leads her to some mysterious warehouse.  There Aya is shown that all the losers somehow become mindless sex slaves, which isn't explained how they lost their minds.  The best assumption is that somehow EVERY competitor, when they lose and know they wont get their wish granted, and their minds break.  Which would be fine...except it happened to every loser which is a stretch.After that we're shown that Aya's crush, who seemed to be in control of the competition was just some guy who's never explained, who has a fetish for plastic surgery.  Of course the crush is behind it, but that's all part of some crazy crap anyway.  So then the plastic surgery copy is killed, and we're treated to a long explanation of how Aya's father was also Miko's father and abusive, and that her parents started the Martial Hearts tournament that got Miko's mother killed and Aya's best friend and crush's mother muted and sold into slavery.  On top of that we're treated to them constantly harping about how Aya of course is an evil spawn, and stupid to boot.  That they set this all up to force her into the Martial Heart to show her how evil she is as revenge against her mother(and departed father) for all the damage they did.Which might've been okay if this wasn't a five episode series that hinted at basically none of this.  The whole thing about Aya having some dark evil inside her is pathetic and aside from her fighting, only used as a source of ridicule at the end.  Nothing about the parents or the past is touched upon until the end monologue where we have no real idea who's right because at the end Aya's mother comes in saying the girls were wrong and that both their mothers were sisters who killed Aya's father and all because it was all set into motion by their grandparents.  Then she proceeds to kill both the girls and patch Aya's gunshot wounds.  And then there's the fact that after Aya's mother talks about them leading their own lives and Aya is still laying on the ground it cuts to an explosion and then Aya's mother talks about how ""there goes the last heir"" or whatever, then finds out there is still apparently one more competitor left.  At this point it cuts to outside the building and Aya has apparently escaped, without anything shown of her leaving.  Had to rewind twice because I thought I missed something.  And then we cut to Aya's ""best friend's"" mother who's apparently crazy and stabbing pictures of Aya, as she answers a doorbell and we see her shocked face then it ends.Honestly I don't even care it ended on a cliffhanger, because it seemed to imply either Aya or her mother killed her.  But it's the whole back story of the parents and who was right or wrong and all that nonsense that killed this for me.  I mean hell the plot of a girl fighting to win her wish was fine enough for a five episode show without suddenly throwing in this nonsense.  That and aside from when she's had the crap kicked out of her, Aya has been nothing but a good person so Miko and the other girl were totally demented in forcing Aya to fight just for some messed up plot of revenge against her mother and departed father.It really honestly feels like this show should've been like 13 episodes where they could've built the mystery of the girls' parents and all that stuff along the way and then have it culminate in a good finale.  This feels almost like a preview of a series.  Like here, watch a couple episodes to wet your whistle and then be in store for the full series.  But of course this is the full series, so gotta say disappointed.  It was fine until the last episode where they tried to make it this dark, mysterious plot that was nonsensical and came out of nowhere.  Oh well I guess, I think I'm going to give it three stars mainly because the first four episodes were just fine, it was just the last episode that blew.  So it was okay I guess.",3,Huh...Not really sure about this one,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,5922,"['Alright', 'so', 'just', 'got', 'finished', 'watching', 'Netflix', 'Actually', 'had', 'wanted',

1354787,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B003NE8B5Q,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","I'm sorry, but I absolutely love a mind-blowing ending, especially in this era of sequels and remakes run amuck.  This five-part series actually delivers its biggest punches after all of the intense fighting is over with.  It's unfortunate that it was presented in the guise of a fan service romp because the nudity and all the ""pervert cam"" shots take away from what I (if no one else) found to be a pretty good story.  It's just stupid for all these girls' clothes to disintegrate and fall off with each punch or kick.  The only impact it has on the story is the main character's need to fight with the handicap of trying to cover herself at the same time.  On top of that, all of the combatants represent some type of fetish - stewardess, nurse, cop, etc.  I also have to question all the criticism that there is hardly any plot to speak of here.  If you ask me, there's possibly too much packed into this storyline, most of it crammed into the final, reality-flipping episode.  You actually have to think about it a little bit in order to keep up, and that seems to be more than some people want to do.  Certainly, it's too much for those who watch this solely for all the frontal nudity.  It's really just as well that the ending is bound to go over the heads of twelve-year-old boys because parents really shouldn't be letting them watch this kind of program in the first place.So here's the story.  Schoolgirl best friends Aya and Natsume are walking home one day when they suddenly come across a brutal fight between a stewardess and a young lady in a priestess outfit.  Said stewardess is pretty much kicking the girl's butt AND being a witch with a b in the process, thus provoking Aya to jump in and save the day with her hidden martial arts abilities.  Afterwards, the little priestess, Miko, explains how she is competing in the Martial Hearts tournament in order to fulfill her wish to have friends.  It's basically an underground fight club (despite the fact that all the fights take place in public places mysteriously devoid of other people) that promises the ultimate winner the granting of her greatest wish via the mysterious Platonic Heart.  The losers, unfortunately, are said to disappear into the dark realms.  That night, Aya learns that she has unwittingly become a contestant in the tournament, and she vows to continue fighting in order to find Miko, who has mysteriously disappeared by the next morning.  Each episode pits her against one or more female opponents in clothes-shedding combat.It sounds like a pretty simplistic storyline that will eventually reveal the fates of Miko and the other missing fighters, but the fifth and final episode has more twists than a giant bag of pretzels wrapped in barbed wire.  Whatever you're expecting, you're all but certain to be surprised, quite possibly confused, and just maybe sent reeling.  Yes, it's far more than anyone could have predicted based on the first four episodes; on the other hand, we're not talking about the writers dropping bombshells on viewers several seasons into a beloved series.  It's just five episodes, people.  Frankly, the fact that Master of Martial Hearts refuses to bow down to anyone's expectations makes me love it all the more.",4,Fan service romp with a mind-blowing ending,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,3236,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'absolutely', 'love', 'mind-blowing', 'ending', 'especially', 'era', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'run', 'amuck', 'five-part', 'series', 'actually', 'biggest', 'punches', 'intense', 'fighting', 'unfortunate', 'was', 'presented', 'guise', 'fan', 'service', 'romp', 'nudity', 'pervert', 'cam', 'shots', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'one', 'else', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'just', 'stupid', 'girls', 'clothes', 'disintegrate', 'fall', 'off', 'punch', 'kick', 'only', 'impact', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'need', 'fight', 'handicap', 'trying', 'cover', 'same', 'time', 'top', 'combatants', 'represent', 'type', 'fetish', 'stewardess', 'nurse', 'cop', 'etc', 'also', 'have', 'question', 'criticism', 'hardly', 'plot', 'speak', 'here', 'ask', 'possibly', 'too', 'much', 'packed', 'storyline', 'most', 'crammed', 'final', 'reality-flipping', 'episode', 'actually', 'have', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'order', 'keep', 'up', 'be', 'more', 'people', 'want', 'do', 'Certainly', 'too', 'much', 'who', 'watch', 'solely', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'bound', 'go', 'heads', 'twelve-year-old', 'boys', 'parents', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'letting', 'watch', 'kind', 'program', 'first', 'place.So', 'here', 'story', 'Schoolgirl', 'best', 'friends', 'Aya', 'Natsume', 'are', 'walking', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'suddenly', 'come', 'brutal', 'fight', 'stewardess', 'young', 'lady', 'priestess', 'outfit', 'Said', 'stewardess', 'pretty', 'much', 'kicking', 'girl', 'butt', 'being', 'witch', 'b', 'process', 'thus', 'provoking', 'Aya', 'jump', 'save', 'day', 'hidden', 'martial', 'arts', 'abilities', 'Afterwards', 'little', 'priestess', 'Miko', 'how', 'competing', 'Martial', 'Hearts', 'tournament', 'order', 'fulfill', 'wish', 'have', 'friends', 'basically', 'underground', 'fight', 'club', 'fact', 'fights', 'take', 'place', 'public', 'places', 'mysteriously', 'devoid', 'other', 'people', 'ultimate', 'winner', 'granting', 'greatest', 'wish', 'mysterious', 'Platonic', 'Heart', 'losers', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'said', 'disappear', 'dark', 'realms', 'night', 'Aya', 'unwittingly', 'become', 'contestant', 'tournament', 'continue', 'fighting', 'order', 'find', 'Miko', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'next', 'morning', 'episode', 'one', 'more', 'female', 'opponents', 'clothes-shedding', 'combat.It', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'storyline', 'will', 'eventually', 'reveal', 'fates', 'Miko', 'other', 'missing', 'fighters', 'fifth', 'final', 'episode', 'more', 'twists', 'giant', 'bag', 'pretzels', 'wrapped', 'barbed', 'wire', ""'re"", 'expecting', ""'re"", 'certain', 'be', 'surprised', 'quite', 'possibly', 'confused', 'just', 'maybe', 'sent', 'reeling', 'Yes', 'far', 'more', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'predicted', 'based', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'writers', 'dropping', 'bombshells', 'viewers', 'several', 'seasons', 'beloved', 'series', 'just', 'five', 'episodes', 'people', 'Frankly', 'fact', 'Master', 'Martial', 'Hearts', 'bow', 'down', 'anyone', 'expectations', 'love', 'more']",N/A
1354788,AEQ8WWTOB9VSO,B003NE8B5Q,Dent K.,"[0, 0]","When I first watched MoMH, I went expecting something like Ikki Tousen, a clothes-exploding fan-service show. At first the show was what I expected. Lots of girls fighting and a lot of fan-service. It was around the 4th episode that something seemed different. The series begins to take a really disturbing turn plot-wise. The show at first seems like a typical light-hearted fan-service show, everything from the box to the first episodes seem to emphasize fan-serivce over everything else. The story is about a young girl fighting other random women with the help of two female friends and the boy the main character is interested in. It seems like a typical generic ecchi anime until the end.The last two episodes are where everything changes for the worse. The plot goes on a totally unexpected dark turn that is just baffling.**SPOILERS HERE READ THE NEXT SECTION ONLY IF YOU WANT TO AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN THIS SHOW** The main villain is revealed to be a handicapped mute woman and all the women the main girl defeats are subjected to an absolutely disgusting form of punishment(not in the perverted sense, but in the just sickening sense). Then it reveals that the main girls' friends and the boy she loves is in on the whole thing to take revenge on the main girls mother. The girls mother then arrives and snaps everyone's neck except the main girl and then the mother chooses to die in a fire. The anime ends with the main girl showing up at the mute woman's home to presumably kill the mute woman. That's the ending, I'm dead serious. I couldn't make up such a stupid ending.**END SPOILERS**The ending is just baffling, it's literally out of nowhere. It's makes no sense, and the last episode spends most of the time trying to explain it, and the ending still makes no sense. Instead of being just dark, the ending is just disturbing. It literally made me feel sick,it's like watching a bad slasher movie. I have seen horror movies less disturbing then this. The best way I can describe it is the ending is like the ending from School Days but not interesting at all. The best way to describe this show is Ikki Tousen until the last 2 episodes then it turns into Elfen Lied, and it has the School Days ending. I'm really only talking about the ending here because that is the only thing worth talking about. The rest of the show is just generic fan-service and fighting. The animation is nothing special, and the sub/dub is forgettable at best.In the end please avoid this anime at all costs. This the worst modern anime I have ever seen. I have seen some really bad anime and this is easily the worst modern anime I have seen. It's not the worst I have seen, but it's right under that because unlike this garbage show I actually destroyed that other DVD(which I will review in the future).

If you purchase this, it will probably be for the exploding clothes of all the fighters. That is the main reason why this should be considered ""R"" rated. The fights consume most of the episodes. There are three separate components to this story, and the first is the fan service during the fights.The second component is the humor. Some of the humor is in your face, such as the energy food that the girls eat at a fast food restaurant. Some of the humor is more subtle, such as what is being said, or not said. See if you can pick out the real dialog from Aya's mother, when Aya comes home with her clothes knocked off. a.) ""Dear, why are you coming home from high school every day without any clothes on?"", b.) ""Dear, I can't make you a new school uniform every day."", or c.) ""Dear, where are you getting all this money to buy new uniforms every day?""The third component is the basic plot line. The revelation of who is doing what, and why, is sort of dumped on you at the end of the last episode in a tangled mess.

If you don't like women, women fighting, ikki tousen type of fan service, and a dark story than you really won't be able to get into this one.

The ending is so dark and unexpected it really makes the anime. Watching it I felt just like the character being torn completely apart as everything collapsed around her.Just the fact that the main character is a girl with an uncanny fighting ability *spoiler here* that was unable to find friends because she scared them all away, and when she does she finds herself realizing that she never had a friend at all *spoiler end* is amazing. What appeared to be just a cheap intro story turned into something much deeper. For such a short anime it's pretty brilliant. Although with only 5 episodes don't expect everything to be in great detail over a lengthy episode.You really have to pay attention or you won't understand the ending at all. As I suspect a majority of the lower scoring reviewers didn't get. *spoiler* It would however been nice for them to explain just exactly how they turned the fighters that lost into sex slaves *spoiler end*.

The story is pretty straight forward for the most part,  you have a tournament where the winner is given a wish of their hearts greatest desire,  though half the characters are so one dimensional in story and background it's pretty bland when you have to see the characters try to interact with the world when they're not fighting in the tournament.  None of the characters are remotely likable to even care for though the series producers try to make you do so,  at the end of the series you aren't felt with dread or sadness on whats been happening but more then likely annoyed at wasting your time watching this sad show all the way through and more then likely thinking ""Why did I waste my time on this"".
