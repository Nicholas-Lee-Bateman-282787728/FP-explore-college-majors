Holmes were just pathetic.  Horrid rendition of Holmes with the most dreadful acting, had to stop it 10 minutes into it because it was just so boring.  I would not recommend this at all, just buy Mr. P & get what you want...quality acting & directing.",2,One series out of three were good.,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,395,"['One', 'series', 'three', 'were', 'good', 'Mr.', 'P.', 'was', 'excellent', 'always', 'were', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'was', 'really', 'slow', 'S.', 'Holmes', 'were', 'just', 'pathetic', 'Horrid', 'rendition', 'Holmes', 'most', 'dreadful', 'acting', 'had', 'stop', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'boring', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'just', 'buy', 'Mr.', 'P', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'quality', 'acting', 'directing']",N/A

1369737,ADQKMEH6LHR8A,B003X2P96W,gluedtotube,"[3, 4]","What can you see about the portrayals of these classic sleuths? David Suchet as Poirot can never be matched or topped.He is Poirot. It is a part he was born to play and the episodes chosen here are a great example of his work and Agatha Christie's stories of Poirot. The same can be said about Miss Marple played by Joan Hickson. Many actresses have played her,but this is the ONE. She is the actress and this is the part that got me watching Miss Marple on PBS back in the 80's and she is Miss Marple in my head to perfection. Both Miss Hickson and Mr. Suchet can not be topped for these roles.Sherlock Holmes portrayed by Mr. Cushing is pretty good,these are the tv versions from I believe the 70's and don't have the quality of the other 2 sleuths. Not to berate Mr. Cushing he is an excellent actor,but to me he is always Dr. Von Helsing or Dr. Frankenstein. I can give the 2nd best rating as Sherlock and since I am a Sherlock collector that is very high. Buy this set if you are starting out on these sleuths,if you are reliving watching them years ago or if you just want a sample set to give as a gift.
