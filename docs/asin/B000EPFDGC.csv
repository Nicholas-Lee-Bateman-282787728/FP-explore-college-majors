The bane of their existence is Ray's parents Marie and Frank...living just across the street, and acting like Ray and Debra's home is an extension of their own. To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth.

Another terrific season with very funny episodes, as always.There are the usual commentaries with Ray Romano, Phil Rosenthal, and some crew members. Patricia Heaton wasn't scheduled to be part of this season's commentaries, which is disappointing, but we get to hear Doris Roberts this time, and even though Romano and Rosenthal talk a lot more than she does in the commentary she's in, it's still fun to get some of her insights. I was especially excited to see that they included a commentary track for ""Talk to Your Daughter,"" which has a storyline about daughter Ally and includes an adorable scene at the very end with Ally and the twins. It was nice to see the cast and crew talk a little bit more about the kids (not much, but they mentioned them a couple times at least). That was one thing that was missing on the first 5 DVD sets, and I'm happy that they've included it here.Some notable episodes from this well-written and successful season include ""The Angry Family,"" where a school essay from little Michael shows the Barone adults that their daily snits with each other are not going unnoticed; ""Marie's Sculpture,"" where Marie makes an absolutely outrageous creation that outdoes even herself; ""Cookies,"" where poor Ray gets more or less beat up by Ally's pushy troop leader; and ""Mother's Day,"" which begins a string of several episodes that chronicles Debra and Marie's biggest fight yet, and shows how it impacts the entire family. Some fans may be interested to know that they initially wanted to stretch the Debra/Marie estrangement for the entire Season 7, but they decided it ""wouldn't have been much of a show if they just left the men to talk to each other."" I personally think they could have made it work and found a way to do it in an upbeat and humorous tone, but the way they did it was great, too. There are many laughs to be had, but plenty of sweet and tender moments as well, all balanced out in classic ""Raymond"" tradition.Only 3 more seasons to go after this one--with a little luck, maybe they will all be released before Christmas (although that may be a little bit of ambitious thinking).

976203,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000EPFDGC,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[0, 0]","I've been buying each season of ELR because I can't get enough of that show even though it's on syndication all the time.  Most of the episodes are great, but there are a few annoying ones here. While season 5 of Raymond started with the Italy vacation episodes which I didn't care for that much, Season 6 ends with the Marie/Debra feud episodes that I don't like at all.  Still, some of my favorites from this season include ""The Angry Family,"" ""Jealous Robert,"" ""It's Suppose to Be Fun,"" ""The Kicker,"" ""Tissues,"" ""Cookies"" (with Peggy the evil leader of the Frontier Girls), ""Lucky Suit,"" ""The Skit,"" ""A Vote For Debra,"" and ""Call Me Mom"" (wow, there are a lot of good ones here).Disc 1""The Angry Family"": The Barones  are concerned about Michael's school presentation and seek advice from the school & Father Hubley.  This is a very funny one.  Debra really goes off!  Marie totally changes the subject when Frank makes a startling (well, not all that startling) observation.""No Roll"": To spice things up, Ray buys a sensual board game. During the game, Debra makes the shocking admission that Ray can sometimes be (news flash!) selfish in the love department.""Ray's Ring"": Robert flicks Ray's wedding ring in a hotel vent and, ringless Ray is hit on by a hot chick in the airport. To prove a point, Debra goes grocery shopping without her ring with different results.""Marie's Sculpture"": Marie is very proud of a sculpture she made, but, to her family and even a group of nuns, it looks erotic.Disc 2""Frank Goes Downstairs"": Ray and Deb fall out of bed during whoopee and blame their injuries on the stairs.  Frank decides to fix the stairs and ends up in the hospital.""Jealous Robert"": Debra and Marie hook Amy up with Gianni to get Robert jealous but the plan backfires.""It's Suppose to Be Fun"": Raymond makes fun of Geoffrey during his basketball game so he quits.  One of my favorites.  I like when Geoffrey is about to attempt free throws and Raymond shouts, ""Whatever you do in life is great!""""Older Women"": Debra's divorced parents visit for Thanksgiving and her very handsome father (Robert Culp) brings his older girlfriend.  I like when she says she feels like 21 but then has to be helped up the stairs for her nap.""Raybert"": Raymond and Robert find that teaming up and switching identities is an effective way to attract chicks.Disc 3""The Kicker"": Finally, a sports-related episode!  You'd think there'd be more of these, Raymond being a sports writer and all (sometimes I forget what he does for a living).  Frank catches a record-breaking field goal at a Hofstra game and holds it for the highest bidder leading to a public outcry.""Season's Greetings"": Marie and Debra work on a Christmas letter and the family is bummed that they don't sound impressive enough.""Tissues"": Raymond wants to make more household decisions.  This is one of my all-time favorites.  The hose scene is classic!""Snow Day"": The Barones hang out at Frank and Marie's house during a snowstorm and Debra says something that hurts Frank's feelings.  Kind of a downer episode.  I often skip this one.""Cookies"": Ray gets into a confrontation with Peggy the Frontier Girls leader over the location of Ally's cookie booth.  Hilarious.Disc 4""Lucky Suit"": Robert has a job interview with the FBI and Marie accidentally burns his lucky suit--or was it an accident?  Another good one!""The Skit"": Ray and Deb do a skit for Lee and Stan's anniversary making fun of Ray's parents but can't take jokes when the skit's on them. I like it when Ray calls Debra a ""cranky, uptight yell machine.""""The Breakup Tape"": Debra is curious why Ray has kept an old cassette of a college girlfriend breaking up with him.  Raymond doesn't understand why Deb has kept presents from old boyfriends.""Talk to Your Daughter"": Deb and Ray think Ally has questions about the birds & the bees but are blind-sided when her question is more profound.  The family's discussion of the meaning of life is really silly.""A Vote for Debra"": Deb runs for President of the School Governing Board and Raymond isn't the most supportive.Disc 5""Call Me Mom"": Debra is mad that Raymond's mom won't let him call her mom, ""mom."" Deb tries to call Marie ""mom"" but she rejects her.""Mother's Day""/ ""The Bigger Person"":  Continuation of a silly storyline.  Marie is offended when Debra refuses to drop everything to let her kids tell knock-knock jokes in front of Marie's friends.  They stop talking to each other for 4 episodes continuing into next season.  Raymond really rips Debra in the second episode; I'm surprised she let him get away with it.""The First Time"": Deb and Marie are still not talking but the plot switches to a flash back showing Marie conspiring to keep Raymond and Debra from having premarital relations.",5,"""I got a whole freak show that set up their tent right across the street""--Debra",1180656000,"06 1,

From the actual title of this episode, through to the final scene of the show, the irony of the storyline showcases one of the funniest comedic productions of any sitcom ever shown on TV.  Also, in this storyline, it is interesting to see that the character who makes the story work is not Ray, or Debra or Frank.  Instead, it is their little son, Michael, who is perfect as he reads his story, and as he glances at his family through the sweet, expressive eyes of a child.

976205,A1WPCZ0GMSRRS4,B000EPFDGC,N. Wright,"[3, 3]","I'm a huge fan of this show, and I bought the full series box set.  I haven't bought the seasons individually as they were released, so I'm curious about the episode ""No Roll!"" in season 6 (the one where Ray buys the board game to play with Debra).  In the series box set, in this episode, as they're playing Sensuopoly on their bed, Debra rolls the dice and lands on a square that tells her to ""kiss your lover as though he going to climb Mount Everest"".  HUH???  In the original episode she says ""kiss your lover as though he's going off to war"".  Why on earth did the production company change the words?

The Angry Family was debatedly the funniest episode ever? All of the adult characters were at their VISCERAL BEST. Craven Ray, overbearing Marie, cranky Frank, envious Robert, and quick tempered Debra were in fine form. The looks they gave each other were almost ""operatic."" Poor father Dubley's expression in having to deal with all the Barones at once in his office was worthy of a Shark bite. The last moment when Ray and Debra find out that the angry family story their son wrote was really about a cartoon would make a corpse laugh. In episode 7-""Jealous Robert,"" the manipulations of Marie and Debra backfire and put the always timid Ray in the middle of another soap opera. Episode 10-""Raybert,"" saw Robert living out his fantasy with a woman who has mistaken him for Ray. The two brothers get caught up in being Raybert and hilarity ensues. Episode 11-""Kicker,"" shows the wickedly wacky persona of Frank. To me it is a crime that Peter Boyle never won an emmy for his performances. He was exceptional in this one as the football hijacker who wants to make a buck on what should have been the football players moment in the sun. The scene where four of them are listening to Frank rant on the radio was classic ELR at its very best.",5,May Be Their Best Season?,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,1307,"['Four', 'alone', 'season', 'were', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'Angry', 'Family', 'was', 'debatedly', 'funniest', 'episode', 'ever', 'adult', 'characters', 'were', 'VISCERAL', 'BEST', 'Craven', 'Ray', 'overbearing', 'Marie', 'cranky', 'Frank', 'envious', 'Robert', 'quick', 'tempered', 'Debra', 'were', 'fine', 'form', 'looks', 'gave', 'other', 'were', 'almost', 'operatic', 'Poor', 'Dubley', 'expression', 'having', 'deal', 'Barones', 'once', 'office', 'was', 'worthy', 'Shark', 'bite', 'last', 'moment', 'when', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'find', 'out', 'angry', 'family', 'story', 'son', 'wrote', 'was', 'really', 'cartoon', 'would', 'make', 'corpse', 'laugh', 'episode', '7-', 'Jealous', 'Robert', 'manipulations', 'Marie', 'Debra', 'backfire', 'put', 'always', 'timid', 'Ray', 'middle', 'soap', 'opera', 'Episode', '10-', 'Raybert', 'saw', 'Robert', 'living', 'out', 'fantasy', 'woman', 'who', 'mistaken', 'Ray', 'two', 'brothers', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'being', 'Raybert', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'Episode', '11-', 'Kicker', 'wickedly', 'wacky', 'persona', 'Frank', 'crime', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'never', 'won', 'emmy', 'performances', 'was', 'exceptional', 'one', 'football', 'hijacker', 'who', 'make', 'buck', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'football', 'players', 'moment', 'sun', 'scene', 'where', 'four', 'are', 'listening', 'Frank', 'rant', 'radio', 'was', 'classic', 'ELR', 'very', 'best']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 6
