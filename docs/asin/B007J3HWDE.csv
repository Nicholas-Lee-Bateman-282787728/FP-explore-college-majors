You would think thatyou'd have to have some culinary background to qualify, but you dont.

Well, I was surprised  the Shipping came by the carrier that i need it too, got to my place on time and the product is in good shape.

As each new set of DVD's comes out I purchase them and the whole family enjoys that season all over again. The unedited (for language)version is always more fun (it's amazing how much swearing goes on!).

1531696,ABWHLZFEM5SZY,B007J3HWDE,R. Jensen,"[0, 0]","Season 7 is different from previous seasons in many ways. Ramsay gets to show off this talent, wit and family a lot this time. Also the difference between strong chef's and weak chef's become very obvious as many chef's continually preform bad, but unlike previous seasons, there are too many of them to isolate all the problems.Spoilers below at this piont (To avoid find these ***) Soilers below at this piont (To avoid find these ***)This season also is different as one team of chefs constantly outpreform the other. Out of 20 possible wins one team only recives 5(some are unjust and two are shared with the other team), while the other revices 14(but clearly should've won some loses or are safe dispite losing).Also the teamwork that helped seasons 5 and 6 loses some steam as rivalries spring up everywhere. Also for the first time, I feel Ramsay made the wrong decision in the final two. The winner did deserve final two, but I feel like the other should've taken the prize, as I feel we got more time with that chef.****** It's not perfect but it is fun.********",4,A change in behavior= mixed results,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,1072,"['Season', '7', 'different', 'previous', 'seasons', 'many', 'ways', 'Ramsay', 'show', 'off', 'talent', 'wit', 'family', 'lot', 'time', 'Also', 'difference', 'strong', 'chef', 'weak', 'chef', 'become', 'very', 'obvious', 'many', 'chef', 'continually', 'preform', 'bad', 'previous', 'seasons', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'isolate', 'problems.Spoilers', 'piont', 'avoid', 'find', '***', 'Soilers', 'below', 'piont', 'avoid', 'find', '***', 'season', 'also', 'different', 'one', 'team', 'chefs', 'constantly', 'outpreform', 'other', '20', 'possible', 'wins', 'one', 'team', 'only', '5', 'are', 'unjust', 'two', 'are', 'shared', 'other', 'team', 'other', 'revices', '14', 'clearly', 'should', ""'ve"", 'won', 'loses', 'are', 'safe', 'losing', '.Also', 'teamwork', 'helped', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'steam', 'rivalries', 'spring', 'up', 'everywhere', 'Also', 'first', 'time', 'feel', 'Ramsay', 'made', 'wrong', 'decision', 'final', 'two', 'winner', 'did', 'deserve', 'final', 'two', 'feel', 'other', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'prize', 'feel', 'got', 'more', 'time', 'chef', '******', 'not', 'perfect', 'fun', '********']",Hell'S Kitchen Season 7
