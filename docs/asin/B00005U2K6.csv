Chad's microphone picks up drums and all the stage sound causing some phase problems, the best sounding song on this dvd is -1 because Chad is on a truss above the stage.  As a response to video quality, it is not the dvd, it is an effect the band put on video to make it grainy.  If you look at the main menu, you'll notice the video is clean and clear.  I honestly wish they would re-release this video without of the video effect because honestly it makes the band hard to see at some points.  But all in all I like this dvd, it shows that the band is human, they do mess up(chad's voice breaking, or certain members running into eachother) but its a good show, and worth checking out:)",4,It's a good effort,1068681600,"11 13, 2003",2003,744,"['DVD', 'okay', 'must', 'stress', 'vocal', 'mic', 'bleed', 'Chad', 'microphone', 'up', 'drums', 'stage', 'sound', 'causing', 'phase', 'problems', 'best', 'sounding', 'song', 'dvd', '-1', 'Chad', 'truss', 'stage', 'response', 'video', 'quality', 'not', 'dvd', 'effect', 'band', 'put', 'video', 'make', 'grainy', 'look', 'main', 'menu', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'video', 'clean', 'clear', 'honestly', 'wish', 'would', 're-release', 'video', 'video', 'effect', 'honestly', 'band', 'hard', 'see', 'points', 'like', 'dvd', 'band', 'human', 'do', 'mess', 'up', 'chad', 'voice', 'breaking', 'certain', 'members', 'running', 'eachother', 'good', 'show', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

I was fortunate enough to be able to see them this summer and their live show is even more entertaining than this DVD.  It has all of the songs from LD.50 so it automatically rules.  My one complaint is that the venue is small and there are too many lights, so you can't get clear looks at the band.  The sound quality is a little sub par, but oh well.  There is some funny footage of the band just being themselves in between songs (&quot;do you have any tuna that's NOT dolphin safe?&quot;).

First off its a killer show its Mudvayne with their makeup on so its like they were kinda similiar to the lengendar KISS another band that experimented with makeup and then moved on from it. I think its cool though I kinda forgot they use to look like this lol. Mudvayne has really grown over the yrs and with every album their sound changes I think these guys dont really get the credit they deserves they are truly a great bunch of musicians. With this dvd you get Mudvayne back in the year 2001 performing all of the L.D. 50 album its epic, aggressive, intense, and in your face Metal!! I saw these guys two times back on The New Game tour back in 08 and that was an asskicer of a show and I would love to see them again. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who loves loud aggressive Metal or any die-hard Mudvayne fan. I would also recommend Mudvayne's ""All Access to All Things"" dvd live concert shot at the 2003 Summer Santirum tour with Metallica talk about a show I would have killed to seen that one!

683188,ADG33WELAQRZJ,B00005U2K6,JUAN MARTIN GABASTOU,"[0, 0]","I've owned this like forever and now I have a good HT I wanted to relive it and be able to assess all its good and bad attributes.The gig is simply too good to put it in words. The atmos of the show and the energy displayed are mind-bending, as is the incredible level of musicianship, esp from the bass player; these guys don't hit a bum note ever !! And I don't think there's much in the guise of sound post-production here since the sound is raw and crude. Guitar tone is homicidal and evenly panned in stereo across the stereo field. Chad's vox is perfectly mixed-in, but the guy sounds as if he's spitting razor blades, nothing like on the cds ! The box states there's over 90' of live concert but there are barely 62' and you have to substract like 90of backstage between songs. These guys don't play just Nu Metal, they play Math Metal as well, and the intricacy of the chord progressions is mind-bending AND gut-wrenching at the same time which is no small feat; I found myself concentrating like crazy to follow them. It literally absorbed me for a whole hour.As I was saying the sound is raw without being lo-fi. The mix is wire-thin and it took some serious juice before my sub started pounding accordingly. Luckily the bottom end is there, and it's spot-on if rolled off, so it just took some cranking up but forget about it if you lack a muscular sub like the one I got. Sound options are LPCM and 5.1 which I hate; always watch music concert in stereo, surround is good for movies only.Now to the pic. People complain that it's horrible, but the appaling graininess exhibited was introduced at post-production, and someone went overboard with it. Matter of fact the pic bitrate is consistently hovering the 8-9 Mbp mark, which is remarkable for 2001. Proof of it is the Death Bloom videoclip on the bonus tracks section; it's so sharp it cuts !!Well get this and the incredible 8-angles DIG single DVD.

As mentioned by others, the picture is not up to most dvd standards. Not saying its lousy either, trust me, Id tell you if the picture was bad (any one seen bad religions dvd? that a bad picture) Think the fact they used so many fog machines made it a tiny bit grainy. The Sound is awesome, and so is the energy this band delivers, They also need to go back to sounding and looking like this. Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because when you look at this, then look a dvd like metallica's cunning stunts, there is just no comparing the two.Anyway, lots of songs, full live performances, and music video, with a sort of biogrophy / hang out with the band kind of stuff on it, worth the price",4,"bought it then, love it now",1051833600,"05 2, 2003",2003,802,"['bought', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'watched', 'thought', 'was', 'ok', 'then', 'like', 'more', 'mentioned', 'others', 'picture', 'not', 'up', 'most', 'dvd', 'standards', 'Not', 'saying', 'lousy', 'trust', 'Id', 'tell', 'picture', 'was', 'bad', 'one', 'seen', 'bad', 'religions', 'dvd', 'bad', 'picture', 'Think', 'fact', 'used', 'so', 'many', 'fog', 'machines', 'made', 'tiny', 'bit', 'grainy', 'Sound', 'awesome', 'so', 'energy', 'band', 'delivers', 'also', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'sounding', 'looking', 'Only', 'reason', 'didnt', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'when', 'look', 'then', 'look', 'dvd', 'metallica', 'cunning', 'stunts', 'just', 'comparing', 'two.Anyway', 'lots', 'songs', 'full', 'live', 'performances', 'music', 'video', 'sort', 'biogrophy', '/', 'hang', 'out', 'band', 'kind', 'stuff', 'price']",N/A

It is a lot of fun to watch the dumb stuff they do, but there is a slight problem with the live show.  While they put a lot into the show, they recorded it well into the touring cycle, and they were worn out.  Chad's voice was shot throughout the Ozzfest tour (time period when this was recorded).  If you saw them before then or after it, his voice sounds SO much better.  I think they could have arranged the setlist a bit better (Dig in the middle of the show??? the crowd was more or less dead after they played Dig).  But still, this is a high quality and great looking DVD.
