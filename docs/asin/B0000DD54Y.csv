But I'll agree it sure is pretty compelling and just a little strange. All these guys do is catch big ole catfish with their bare hands. It's a tradition and they call it ""noodling"". It looks like a lotta fun. I'm a documentary fan and love learning about people and culture.

778205,A3CKPNSGA7JOLK,B0000DD54Y,"Bachelier ""&#34;1004&#34;""","[1, 1]","""Okie Noodling"" is about men who enjoy wading into rivers and catching fish with their bare hands.  A bit light, given the gravity of the subject, but fun nonetheless. There is nothing like the thrill of catching a huge catfish with your bare hands, and that's just what fishermen have been doing for thousands of years.This is a documentary by Bradley Beesley, better known for his work on ""The Flaming Lips,"" and whose music is featured here on the soundtrack of this too-short film.The best part about this film is it is about noodling and real people and their pastime.  Jerry Rider, David Baggett, Lee McFarlin, Red Baggett all share their noodling lives after initial reluctance to let Beesley film them at their favorite noodling spots. Whether for ridicule or for fear of giving away their locations is left unanswered, but the sincerity of these men and their sport bespeaks of the latter as the reason.Which clearly demonstrates that noodling is a sport thrill beyond any other, and why it should be more popular.Viewers learn that noodlers a) jump in a river where there are snakes, snapping turtles, and catfish, b) submerge in murky muddy water, c) reach into a male fish's hole where he is protecting his female's egg brood, d) get bitten by the fish, and then e) pull the fish out of the water.Needless to say, it is the greatest thrill in the world, combining man against the unknown and under the deep Babylonian waters from which Ur and Abraham emerged. We reach back in to the womb and grab an alternate screaming reality from it. A monster.This documentary does shows the good side of small-town, working-class white-male Americans - a group that receives little positive attention from the media and yet is time and again responsible for our safety and civilization and freedom that we enjoy.There is little attempt to craft a dramatic narrative - most is the noodlers explaining why noodling is enjoyable, so this could have been edited better. The film's end is when Beesley sponsors the first-ever noodling competition and is tacked on and contrived. Beesley would have done better to explore noodling for profit in Cambodia (true!), the pirate noodlers in France's Tarn river (still sadly illegal), and noodling in the rest of the country whre it is practiced: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.In summary:The Good Things: It is about noodling, Flaming Lips, authentic, accurate, respectful.The Bad Things: too Oklahoma centered, not detailed enough, little historical context, too short.",3,"The good, the bad, the grabbin'",1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,2614,"['Okie', 'Noodling', 'men', 'who', 'enjoy', 'wading', 'rivers', 'catching', 'fish', 'bare', 'hands', 'bit', 'light', 'given', 'gravity', 'subject', 'fun', 'nonetheless', 'nothing', 'thrill', 'catching', 'huge', 'catfish', 'bare', 'hands', 'just', 'what', 'fishermen', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'thousands', 'years.This', 'documentary', 'Bradley', 'Beesley', 'better', 'known', 'work', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'music', 'featured', 'here', 'soundtrack', 'too-short', 'film.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'noodling', 'real', 'people', 'pastime', 'Jerry', 'Rider', 'David', 'Baggett', 'Lee', 'McFarlin', 'Red', 'Baggett', 'share', 'noodling', 'lives', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'let', 'Beesley', 'film', 'favorite', 'noodling', 'spots', 'Whether', 'ridicule', 'fear', 'giving', 'away', 'locations', 'left', 'unanswered', 'sincerity', 'men', 'sport', 'bespeaks', 'latter', 'reason.Which', 'clearly', 'noodling', 'sport', 'thrill', 'other', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'popular.Viewers', 'learn', 'noodlers', 'jump', 'river', 'where', 'are', 'snakes', 'snapping', 'turtles', 'catfish', 'b', 'submerge', 'murky', 'muddy', 'water', 'c', 'reach', 'male', 'fish', 'hole', 'where', 'protecting', 'female', 'egg', 'brood', 'd', 'get', 'bitten', 'fish', 'then', 'e', 'fish', 'water.Needless', 'say', 'greatest', 'thrill', 'world', 'combining', 'man', 'unknown', 'deep', 'Babylonian', 'waters', 'Ur', 'Abraham', 'emerged', 'reach', 'back', 'womb', 'grab', 'alternate', 'screaming', 'reality', 'monster.This', 'documentary', 'good', 'side', 'small-town', 'working-class', 'white-male', 'Americans', 'group', 'little', 'positive', 'attention', 'media', 'yet', 'time', 'again', 'responsible', 'safety', 'civilization', 'freedom', 'little', 'attempt', 'craft', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'most', 'noodlers', 'explaining', 'why', 'noodling', 'enjoyable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'better', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'Beesley', 'first-ever', 'noodling', 'competition', 'tacked', 'contrived', 'Beesley', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'explore', 'noodling', 'profit', 'Cambodia', 'true', 'pirate', 'noodlers', 'France', 'Tarn', 'river', 'still', 'sadly', 'illegal', 'noodling', 'rest', 'country', 'whre', 'practiced', 'Alabama', 'Arkansas', 'Georgia', 'Illinois', 'Kentucky', 'Mississippi', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Oklahoma', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Tennessee', 'Texas', 'Wisconsin.In', 'summary', 'Good', 'Things', 'noodling', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'authentic', 'accurate', 'respectful.The', 'Bad', 'Things', 'too', 'Oklahoma', 'centered', 'not', 'detailed', 'enough', 'little', 'historical', 'context', 'too', 'short']",Okie Noodling: A Documentary by Bradley Beesley

I had heard tales of &quot;Hand Fishing&quot; from an old fellow that I used to know - mostly I thought it was a lot of baloney to spin an interesting story. After seeing the movie &quot;Big Fish&quot; it made me think back to these stories that I had heard, and do some research. That is how I came to find this DVD (not advertised or known here in the Los Angeles area!). Interesting from start to finish - I have done plenty of pole fishing in my youth, and catfish frys were common in Florida &amp; Georgia.

There are a few men who venture out into lakes, rivers and creeks in rural America to fish for catfish with their bare hands. They leave the rod and reel at home and stick their fingers and toes into holes in the dark and murky water in search of monster fish. They do this for fun and for food. In the course of the documentary the filmmaker decides to ferret out these men by holding a tournament.Fishing this way is dangerous and it's not easy. But one man describes how it's a way for him to spend time with his son. His mother sees it as a way for her her son to learn responsibility. Life's chores are many and at the end of the day dinner needs to be on the table. These men are keeping a very old way of fishing alive. They live off the land and the sweat of their brow.

778210,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B0000DD54Y,stoic,"[0, 0]","Okie Noodling is about people who enjoy wading out into rivers and catching fish with their bare hands. Viewers learn that noodle must: a) submerge in a like or a river, b) reach into a fish's lair, c) get bitten by the fish, and then d) pull the fish out of the water. Needless to say, it's not for the faint of heart.Noodling is legal in only four U.S. states and it seems to be vanishing as time passes. In 2000, documentary filmmaker Bradley Beesley - a man with deep Oklahoma roots - set out to film some noodlers before the hobby vanished (or was outlawed). Many of the noodlers were reluctant to let Beesley film them at their favorite noodling spots (for fear of giving away their locations); but Beesley eventually found some noodlers who agreed to cooperate.The resulting documentary shows the good side of small-town, working-class Americans - a group that receives little positive attention from the media. Viewers who have small-town roots will recognize and appreciate these people. Wisely, Beesley doesn't attempt to craft a dramatic narrative - he just lets these people explain why noodling is enjoyable. One exception comes at the film's end when Beesley sponsors the first-ever noodling competition. The scene seems a bit contrived - an attempt to add some structure to the film.In short, Okie Noodling is a fun, lightweight documentary that informs the viewer about a vanishing side of America.",3,Catching Fish with Your Bare Hands - A Slice of Life from Oklahoma,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,1414,"['Okie', 'Noodling', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'wading', 'out', 'rivers', 'catching', 'fish', 'bare', 'hands', 'Viewers', 'learn', 'noodle', 'must', 'submerge', 'like', 'river', 'b', 'reach', 'fish', 'lair', 'c', 'get', 'bitten', 'fish', 'then', 'd', 'fish', 'water', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'faint', 'heart.Noodling', 'legal', 'only', 'four', 'U.S.', 'states', 'be', 'vanishing', 'time', 'passes', '2000', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Bradley', 'Beesley', 'man', 'deep', 'Oklahoma', 'roots', 'set', 'out', 'film', 'noodlers', 'hobby', 'vanished', 'was', 'outlawed', 'Many', 'noodlers', 'were', 'reluctant', 'let', 'Beesley', 'film', 'favorite', 'noodling', 'spots', 'fear', 'giving', 'away', 'locations', 'Beesley', 'eventually', 'found', 'noodlers', 'who', 'agreed', 'cooperate.The', 'resulting', 'documentary', 'shows', 'good', 'side', 'small-town', 'working-class', 'Americans', 'group', 'little', 'positive', 'attention', 'media', 'Viewers', 'who', 'have', 'small-town', 'roots', 'will', 'recognize', 'appreciate', 'people', 'Wisely', 'Beesley', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'craft', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'just', 'people', 'explain', 'why', 'noodling', 'enjoyable', 'One', 'exception', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'Beesley', 'first-ever', 'noodling', 'competition', 'scene', 'bit', 'contrived', 'attempt', 'add', 'structure', 'film.In', 'short', 'Okie', 'Noodling', 'fun', 'lightweight', 'documentary', 'viewer', 'vanishing', 'side', 'America']",Okie Noodling: A Documentary by Bradley Beesley
