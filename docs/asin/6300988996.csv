John Hughes is well known for his teenage films. The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Buellers day off, Weird Science. Its his ""adult"" films like Planes, Trains Automobiles and She's Having a Baby that don't get a lot of recognition for their unique brilliance.I happen to LOVE Kevin Bacon, yes he has gotten a reputation of being the foundation of a certain game, and he just shot a commercial making fun of himself, but the man is a great actor. Elizabeth McGovern plays ""Kristi"", wife to Bacons ""Jefferson"". Teenage sweethearts, turned reluctant newlyweds (on his part), turned rats in the maze of life. You don't get that they are so much in love, with the arguing and not communicating. Jefferson, or Jake as he is called, has fantasies and visions and it's never in a positive light unless it includes a foreign woman coming onto him. He feels stuck in the marriage, stuck in his job, stuck in suburbia hell. His parents and In laws don't exactly think he is prime husband or potential awesome father material BUT they are wondering where that fat toddling grandkid is!! Alec Baldwin plays Jakes best friend Davis and really, his chest hair steals the show as well as the usual Baldwin ""a-hole"" womanizing stereotype.It isn't until the last part of the movie, when ""She"" IS having a baby, do we get to see them all grow in love and realization that you can lose so much more than you ever realized and you better stop being so distant and cynical and selfish and appreciate what is right before your eyes before its too late. Life isn't about where you work, or what lawnmower you own, or what you're missing out on , its about love and family and seeking happiness in everyday miracles. Watching it as an adult I can appreciate this movie so much more. rewatch it if you havent for awhile, or watch it for the first time.

241652,A136MAOWGCU2C2,6300988996,K.T. May,"[2, 3]","Kevin Smith, of Jay and Silent Bob fame, has lauded She's Having a Baby as John Hughes' best film.  He has even admitted to having his soundtrack in the car as a youth.  It is fantastic that someone with Smith's reach via podcasts and the like has publicly declared this film to be one of his favorites.  It is an '80s gem, and it is worthy of mention.She's Having a Baby is a darling film about two young kids going through the typical motions of getting married, going to college, buying a house, having a baby and ultimately, growing up.  We open at their wedding.  Kevin Bacon's character, Jake Briggs, is attempting to cope with his fear of getting married and growing up.  He is not being very successful.  Alec Baldwin plays his best friend, Davis, who is constantly trying to remind Jake of the free life he could be living if he wasn't tied down with the ol' ball and chain.  He tells him they could leave now and forget the whole thing, just say the word!  Jake truly loves Kristi, (Elizabeth McGovern's character), and ultimately chooses a life with her over the bachelorhood that Davis represents.  Jake knows that type of life is not all it's cracked up to be, and that ""there's more to life than getting laid.""Kristi is the more mature person in the relationship.  This is evident in a scene where they attempt to go ""clubbing"", but they slowly realize that they have matured past this point.  When Jake leaves to go to the bathroom, someone tries to ask Kristi out,  but we can tell from her body language that she says no because she is happily married.  Jake, on the other hand, is trying to cope with temptation from the pretty blonde who has been flirting with him all night.Jake tries to secure a job that will pay him enough money so that he can support himself and Kristi while trying to pursue his true dream of being a writer in his spare time.  After he has been working for a while, Kristi decides that she is ready for a family without consulting Jake first, which leads to some very funny scenes that play out in Jake's imagination.  Problems arise later on in the film in such moments as when Davis tries to seduce Kristi, when Kristi is having difficulty getting pregnant and when things look like they may take a tragic turn.Ultimately, this film demonstrates all of the inner workings of a relationship, from marriage to children, despite outside influences trying to bring it down.  From money troubles and family stress to a temptation to stray, the major issues experienced by newlyweds are all documented here.  This is a feel-good film that celebrates a mature love.  These two make the typical ""cute couple"" and we're pulling for them to succeed.In addition to being a great film, the soundtrack to She's Having a Baby is delightful.  There are some lesser known tracks from Everything But the Girl and Love & Rockets, and some cute tracks like the title track by Dave Wakeling and ""You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby"" by Kirsty MacColl.  There is also a scene in the movie which features Kate Bush's ""This Woman's Work"" that is a real tear-jerker.  Hughes likes to play around with montages in this film and each one is as good at evoking emotion from the audience as the next.",4,"""She's Having a Baby""...and lets us watch!",1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,3218,"['Kevin', 'Smith', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'fame', 'lauded', 'Having', 'Baby', 'John', 'Hughes', 'best', 'film', 'even', 'admitted', 'having', 'soundtrack', 'car', 'youth', 'fantastic', 'someone', 'Smith', 'reach', 'podcasts', 'like', 'publicly', 'declared', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'favorites', ""'80s"", 'gem', 'worthy', 'mention.She', 'Having', 'Baby', 'darling', 'film', 'two', 'young', 'kids', 'going', 'typical', 'motions', 'getting', 'married', 'going', 'college', 'buying', 'house', 'having', 'baby', 'ultimately', 'growing', 'up', 'open', 'wedding', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'Jake', 'Briggs', 'attempting', 'cope', 'fear', 'getting', 'married', 'growing', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'very', 'successful', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'best', 'friend', 'Davis', 'who', 'constantly', 'trying', 'remind', 'Jake', 'free', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'living', 'was', ""n't"", 'tied', 'down', 'ol', 'ball', 'chain', 'could', 'leave', 'now', 'forget', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'say', 'word', 'Jake', 'truly', 'loves', 'Kristi', 'Elizabeth', 'McGovern', 'character', 'ultimately', 'life', 'bachelorhood', 'Davis', 'Jake', 'type', 'life', 'not', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'more', 'life', 'getting', 'laid', 'Kristi', 'more', 'mature', 'person', 'relationship', 'evident', 'scene', 'where', 'attempt', 'go', 'clubbing', 'slowly', 'realize', 'have', 'matured', 'point', 'When', 'Jake', 'go', 'bathroom', 'someone', 'tries', 'ask', 'Kristi', 'out', 'can', 'tell', 'body', 'language', 'happily', 'married', 'Jake', 'other', 'hand', 'trying', 'cope', 'temptation', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'who', 'been', 'flirting', 'night.Jake', 'tries', 'secure', 'job', 'will', 'pay', 'enough', 'money', 'can', 'support', 'Kristi', 'trying', 'pursue', 'true', 'dream', 'being', 'writer', 'spare', 'time', 'been', 'working', 'while', 'Kristi', 'ready', 'family', 'consulting', 'Jake', 'first', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'Jake', 'imagination', 'Problems', 'arise', 'later', 'film', 'such', 'moments', 'when', 'Davis', 'seduce', 'Kristi', 'when', 'Kristi', 'having', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'when', 'things', 'look', 'may', 'take', 'tragic', 'turn.Ultimately', 'film', 'inner', 'workings', 'relationship', 'marriage', 'children', 'outside', 'influences', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'money', 'troubles', 'family', 'stress', 'temptation', 'stray', 'major', 'issues', 'experienced', 'newlyweds', 'are', 'documented', 'here', 'feel-good', 'film', 'mature', 'love', 'two', 'make', 'typical', 'cute', 'couple', ""'re"", 'pulling', 'succeed.In', 'addition', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'Having', 'Baby', 'delightful', 'are', 'lesser', 'known', 'tracks', 'Everything', 'Girl', 'Love', 'Rockets', 'cute', 'tracks', 'title', 'track', 'Dave', 'Wakeling', 'Just', 'Have', ""n't"", 'Earned', 'Yet', 'Baby', 'Kirsty', 'MacColl', 'also', 'scene', 'movie', 'Kate', 'Bush', 'Woman', 'Work', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'Hughes', 'play', 'around', 'montages', 'film', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'evoking', 'emotion', 'audience', 'next']",N/A

His personality was somewhat flat, yet it had a dry wit to it. His mate wasn't really focused upon that much. The moments she shared onscreen were quirky and down to earth. I liked the way she expressed herself. Her timing and the way she spoke. Kevin's character seemed to observe life rather than actually be in it. He was a writer and was working a day job and toiling away at nite writing this story. I didn't find him really deep yet he looked at things and from a writer's perspective. He reflected upon his marriage and knew he loved his wife even when presented with a possible fling. His emotions didn't take over his personality except when it came to the birth of his child and his wife's complications. Some of the things I liked, the outside porch where the two of them talk, he and his wife, near the beginning. It had such a romantic energy to it. The candle, the greenery, and the enclosement. The deep discussions from his best friend in the late nite, drinking coffee or a special tea. The fun he had fixing up his house with his wife. His inability to be intimate, yet be intimate in his head, and how she seemed to get it. The late nite writing with the constant comfort of some caffinated brew.

Its the struggle about settling down and doing what everyone else is doing. Which is usually boring.  Same old thing, get married, have kids. It also explains why men don't get excited about having children. They start to feel pressure to be financially secure and to stay with one woman.But other than writing his book and having sex with random women, what else did Jake want to do with his life if he wasn't married? There aren't too many options: You become a gigolo or get married.SPOILERS1) The NeighborsWhy are all the married people in their neighborhood not even close to the couple's age? It was interesting because it showed neighbors blending in with each other to the point of lost identity. I have seen this happen over and over again.2) The PillI think she was being dishonest about telling him 3 months later, that she was off the pill. I think it was her way of &#34;trapping&#34; him instead of asking him if he wanted to have kids and discussing it thoroughly.

Alas, I didn't see it in theaters but got it on video and wore my copy out from repeat viewings.  Finally the DVD has arrived, but with the exception of a trailer there's nothing as far as Special Features, which is pretty disappointing.  The film is letterboxed to it's proper 1.85:1 aspect ratio and looks just great.  The sound is also good.  Would've liked a John Hughes audio commentary like the one he did for the Ferris Bueller's Day Off DVD, but no such luck.As for the movie itself, I think it's wonderful.  A sweet and honest interpretation of growing up into adulthood and living with the decisions that you make.  Since Kevin Bacon plays a writer named Jefforson (Jake) Briggs, we get to view his imagination thru certain scenes when he's sort of daydreaming, that come across very comically (like the lawnmower ballet).  My favorite is when Kristi (Elizabeth McGovern) tells him &quot;I stopped taking the pill three months ago&quot;, to which he sits up and starts screaming, imagining himself on a fastmoving traincar in a straitjacket, crashing into a brick wall.  If those visuals don't explain his anxiety I don't know what would.  That's the fun of the movie.Everyone's talking about the wonderful Soundtrack that is out of print.  This is because it was owned by I.R.S. Records and they went out of business many years ago and no one has bothered to pick up the rights to reissue it.  I feel lucky, since I bought it on cassette and CD back in the early 90s.  But if you really want to find one I suggest you try an online auction house such as ebay.  They always have copies of the soundtrack to sell.I always feel cheated when I buy a Paramount DVD because they are so expensive and usually only have a trailer as a bonus.  Luckily I got this one dirt cheap at an auction, but even so they should'nt be charging us an arm and a leg for &quot;movie only&quot; DVDs when other studios (like Warner Bros.) sell &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVDs at cheaper prices.  If you feel the same way as me I hope you'll write to Paramount and share your disappointment.I hope these remarks were helpful.",5,Finally on DVD!

The movie is told from the point of view (and narrated) by Jake Briggs who is charmingly played by Kevin Bacon. He is a would be writer who seems to get stuck in a life and career that he's not sure he wants. The film starts off with his marriage to Christie and follows them through the travails of married life and the fact that we all have to grow up and take on the responsibilities of adulthood.  Christie is played delightfully by Elizabeth McGovern. She adds the right amount of compassion and caring to role. Jake's best friend Davis (played by Alec Baldwin) is still living the wild life and he tries to convince Jake that Christie is holding him back.  In the end, Jake realizes that the life he has is special and that his wife and new baby are more important than anything else.
