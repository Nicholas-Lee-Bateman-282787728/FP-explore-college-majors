1453691,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B005CA4SHO,a,"[0, 1]","Let me begin by saying that I am a huge Kevin Spacey fan, and I have seen virtually all of his films.  I have often enjoyed even his lower profile independent projects such as ""The Big Kahuna.""  This movie had a lot going for it, but sadly--even with the great Spacey at the helm--it fell a little flat for me.  This might have worked as a straight-up parody of informercial mania and the country's obsession with unnecessary gadgets.  Instead we have a fairly generic dramedy that tries too hard to be a heartwarming story of redemption as a workaholic discovers the importance of family.At under 90 minutes, ""Father of Invention"" simply does not have room for such an extraordinary supporting cast, most of whom pop in and out (such as John Stamos' slightly extended cameo) and add virtually nothing to the narrative.  Heather Graham is somewhat interesting as an angry, confused lesbian with an odd fascination with her own breasts, but her romantic subplot fizzles out with no resolution.  Craig Robinson (""The Office"") is his usual funny self, but he has nothing to do until the end credits.  This is Kevin Spacey's film from start to finish, and there's nothing wrong with that.  The problem lies with a story that's too short, with too many characters, that ignores its comic potential to become a cloying tearjerker that the audience just does not care about.All that aside, I will say that my wife totally bought the family-redemption narrative and was in tears towards the end.  I was almost in tears for a very different reason.  Great actors should be forgiven for making occasionally bad films.  In this case, it's just sad to see a story with such potential fall so very flat.  I give the film two stars, and my wife gives it four.  We'll call it an even three and probably never watch it again.",3,A potential comic gem that falls flat,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,1809,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'am', 'huge', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'virtually', 'films', 'have', 'often', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'lower', 'profile', 'independent', 'projects', 'such', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'sadly', 'even', 'great', 'Spacey', 'helm', 'fell', 'little', 'flat', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'straight-up', 'parody', 'informercial', 'mania', 'country', 'obsession', 'unnecessary', 'gadgets', 'Instead', 'have', 'fairly', 'generic', 'dramedy', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'redemption', 'workaholic', 'importance', 'family.At', '90', 'minutes', 'Father', 'Invention', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'room', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'supporting', 'cast', 'most', 'whom', 'pop', 'such', 'John', 'Stamos', 'slightly', 'extended', 'cameo', 'add', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'narrative', 'Graham', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'angry', 'confused', 'lesbian', 'odd', 'fascination', 'own', 'breasts', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'fizzles', 'out', 'resolution', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'Office', 'usual', 'funny', 'self', 'nothing', 'do', 'end', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'problem', 'story', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'comic', 'potential', 'become', 'cloying', 'tearjerker', 'audience', 'just', 'not', 'care', 'about.All', 'aside', 'will', 'say', 'wife', 'totally', 'bought', 'family-redemption', 'narrative', 'was', 'tears', 'end', 'was', 'almost', 'tears', 'very', 'different', 'reason', 'Great', 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'forgiven', 'making', 'occasionally', 'bad', 'films', 'case', 'just', 'sad', 'see', 'story', 'such', 'potential', 'fall', 'so', 'very', 'flat', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'wife', 'four', ""'ll"", 'call', 'even', 'three', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1453693,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B005CA4SHO,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[1, 6]","Wow.  I'm the 20th person to review on this movie on Amazon.com and I feel like they must have sent me a different film than the one everyone else got!  I think ""Father of Invention"" is a wonderful movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was interested in the cast, the concept, as well as the challenge of balancing the drama and the humor.Its been a long time since I saw a movie where I thought every actor was perfectly cast, and all of them contributed to the story.  First, Kevin Spacey who has made a very successful career out of playing complex, imperfect, and unpredictable odd balls.  In the extras, the producers tell about how they sent the script to Spacey hoping he'd like it.  It would seem to me that once Kevin Spacey read a role like Robert Axel, he would have absolutely no choice but to take it.  He was so many things throughout the movie.  From homeless bum and worthless ex-con, to mighty entrepreneur, from ambitious pitch man, to sensitive friend, from heartless father, to self-aware dad.  He did it all in this film, and it was all very worthy.Every cast member did a nice job conveying the humor in the movie.  I've always enjoyed ""Arrested Development,"" and there was alot of humor of that kind throughout the movie.  The direction seemed to find a comfortable home in the humor, and perhaps this is not surprising given that several of the other cast members are brilliant comedians, including Johnny Knoxville and Craig Robinson.  I thought the direction matched the casting perfectly because it seemed like everyone was well matched to their roles.  Even Camilla Belle, who had the most dramatic responsibility as the neglected daughter, was able to add bits of humor when called upon.Another nice thing about ""Father of Invention"" is its ""mockumentary"" characteristics.  I am a big fan of Christopher Guest movies which affectionately ridicule the target subject matter in the context of humor and satire.  Unlike Guest's movies however, this film has a very powerful element of drama and personal failure.  Yet I think it very successfully mocks the gadget/fad/exercise machine/""but wait..."" industry, while also trying to demonstrate Robert Axel's interest not just to make money, but also to come up with something great that will help people.I realize that the premise of the movie is that the main character, Robert Axel, takes himself too seriously.  Yet from the moment he steps out of prison, it is clear that this character, who has hit rock bottom, no longer suffers from this problem.  Not that his moral compass has found its way yet (and really doesn't until the end of the movie).  But we come to find that no one really takes themselves to seriously in this cast of characters, so there is plenty of space for odd and supportive friendships to take hold.""Father of Invention"" has a number of entertaining scenes where people are very honest with, and do nice things for each other.  Robert Axel is able to get help from three friends from the old days who help him launch his new (and very silly - like all the products, most notably, the ""Ab Clicker"") idea.  Robert Axel comes through for one of his daughters room mates - twice - in two very touching scenes with Spacey and Heather Graham.  Axel seems to forgive everyone from his past, including his wife and her new husband, even though almost no one is willing to forgive him.Basically, I love the ambiguity and untidiness of this movie.  I'm tired of all the cheap, commercial schlock that de-humanizes and pollutes most of the movies produced for public consumption today.  In one of the scenes with Robert Axel and another of his daughters room mates, he explains (from experience) how ""fathers are human too"" and they can be failures and so much less than they should be.  This was one of several rare moments of honesty, like when Axel and Heather Graham's character are driving away from a confrontation with her boyfriend and he tells her she is a very strong and attractive person, and she cries.  He goes on to say, ""I never cheated on my wife.... I cheated on my wife with my job.""  This explains why he is never too angry with his wife for spending $382 million of his money, or getting re-married, etc., because he knows it was his own fault.Robert Axel seems to take responsibility for this failures, and this made him a much more attractive character than he could have been.  The scene where he finds an ""ab clicker"" and immediately hauls it out to the street to destroy it in a fit of nervous anger, shows just how bitter he is at what happened with that device.  ""I should have tested it more,"" he says to his engineer.Another problem I have with most movies today but not this one, is the failure to be consistent with script, character development and directing.  In ""Father of Invention,"" I thought the plot and the behaviors of the characters - even the odd idiosyncrasies - seemed to make sense, and the ending of the movie, even though it came too early, was a reasonable ending and it tied up the relationships between the main characters nicely.So unlike the other 95% of reviewers, I highly recommend ""Father of Invention,"" for everybody - Spacey fans, fans of great humor a la ""Arrested Development,"" fans of any of the other actors (who all got great roles except perhaps for John Stamos), fans of infomercials and direct TV advertising, and fans of honest, alternative presentation in modern cinema.And for the rest of you, pay closer attention and look carefully.  There is some wonderful action and writing on this screen!",5,"Wonderful, Funny (and Dramatic) Movie With Great Cast",1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,5553,"['Wow', ""'m"", '20th', 'person', 'review',

""ccjello""","[0, 1]","As always, Kevin Spacey delivers a first-rate performance and gives depth to his character, a visionary ""fabricator"" who hawks his odd products in TV informercials.  If you don't try to believe the story -- it's pretty unbelievable and highly unlikely -- and just take it for what it is, it's not a bad movie.  Not a great movie, but I still enjoyed it.  The acting is very good; the story isn't particularly compelling.  It starts with Robert Axle (Spacey) leaving prison after completing his sentence for -- selling a dangerous  product, the Ab Clicker, a combination ab roller / TV remote controller).  The fact that he would face criminal liability for designing an exercise/novelty product that injured folks doesn't make a lot of sense to me -- nor does the Spacey character in general.  He doesn't come across as an evil person who needs to be redeemed, but the movie is largely about his redemption, as a father and a friend.  Parts of the film really make no sense to me --the odd relantionship between Axle and his daughter's angryy lesbian (?) gym-teacher roommate.  Not sure how that advanced the film.

But after serving some time in prison, he's humiliated, estranged, and living with a daughter he barely knows.  As Axle tries to reconnect with his daughter, and put his life back together, he comes up with a brilliant new idea.  The only problem is getting people to take him seriously.FATHER OF INVENTION is a mediocre film at its best.  Its story is tired and worn-out, with predictable twists and scenarios that add little to the genre.  And yet, the cast is superb.  Kevin Spacey is always watchable, and while he's phoning it in here (sporting some rather ridiculous facial hair), he's still one of the best at subtle comedy.  The supporting cast does a stellar job of backing him up, even if their roles are rather two dimensional: Craig Robinson, Heather Graham, Virginia Madsen, Johnny Knoxville, Camilla Belle, and John Stamos all help to round out what is one of the better mature-comedy line-ups of recent years.The fact that the film doesn't entirely congeal isn't much of a mystery: it offers nothing that we haven't seen elsewhere.  The only pleasure to be had is in watching the story as told by this cast, which is worth a viewing, but doesn't really warrant repeated trips.  As an indie comedy, it just isn't hip or new enough; as a more mainstream film, it isn't quick enough.  Spacey has done his hopeless buffoon schtick better before, and you can also see the supporting cast doing pretty much the same thing in countless other films (Robinson is in practically every comedy made in the past three years).

An inventor named Robert Axle (portrayed by Kevin Spacey) learns this the hard way.  A successful businessman, he provides the public with a number of devices that they need (or think they need).  That is, until one of his most popular products leads to serious injuries.This, in-turn, lands him in federal prison for gross negligence for the better part of a decade.  Meanwhile, 1/2 his fortune goes to his ex wife, while the other 1/2 goes to the victims of his invention (ostensibly via a Class Action lawsuit).Poor Robert.

Emerging from the prison gates, he finds that he has less credibility than George W. Bush!The only person left in the world who gives a darn about him is his estranged daughter.  She tries to help him out & gets mixed results.  One of her roommates (portayed by Heather Graham) wants Robert gone for good.  Obviously, Heather has a grand old time playing a woman who is a militant lesbian (who actually may or may not be militant OR a lesbian!).The reconciliation with the daughter is heartwarming, but ultimately it seemed to me as though the movie didn't do a good job in tying up some loose ends.

It's good to see Kevin Spacey in a different role, something a little lighter and with humor.Robert Axle (Spacey) is the kind of guy you might love to hate because he's neglected his family for the sake of his job as inventor...ahem...fabricator of various cool gadgets. However, when a malfunction occurs with one product, with disastrous results, Axle spends the next eight years behind bars (why eight years in prison is never explained, wouldn't he just get sued?).  After his release, the film then focuses on one of its central issues: his reconciliation with his now adult daughter. (There are various flashbacks that depict Axle as a bit of a self-centered person, ego-driven and consumed with work, with little time for his daughter). Going from wealthy fabricator and business mogul to rock bottom, penniless and unemployed, Axle winds up staying at his daughter's place with her two female roommates on condition that he only stay a month until he gets back on his feet. While he tries to find work (he does land a job at Family Mart), he also tries to patch up things with his daughter (albeit in many hopeless attempts).While Father of Invention is not a laugh out loud kind of comedy, it does shine in its light-hearted quirks, amusing characters, and entertaining and humorous situations. There are a few funny exchanges between Axle and his boss at Family Mart (Johnny Knoxville), who is resentful about hiring a convicted felon for this job, even if it does pay minimum wage. Another focus is on the change of Axle, although at points it does come across as contrived and forced. He learns about his prior selfishness and comes to terms with how to change this.Over all, Father of Invention was entertaining and fun.

1453703,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B005CA4SHO,James Morris,"[1, 3]","Father of Invention is a sappy comedy which doesn't rock the boat or provide too many genuine laughs.  Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) is an entrepreneur who made millions of dollars with his inventions (which he calls ""fabrications"") all by combining two uses in one product - like toothpaste brushes that double as ear cleaners.  One of his inventions - a combination exercise chair and TV remote control -- maims thousands of his customers and he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for ""wanton disregard for human safety"".  If the premise sounds familiar, it's probably because it's been done before - and much better - in a 1979 classic starring Steve Martin, called ""The Jerk.""Upon release from prison, he discovers that the general public reviles his memory, he has ruined his relationship with his daughter, and his ex-wife has squandered her half of his fortune on philanthropic whims and her new husband, a likeable but schlubby African-American park ranger.  Kevin Spacey is made up to look like a homeless ex-convict for the first half of the film, which doesn't help, but Craig Robinson as Jerry King (his ex-wife's new husband) provides some of the brightest moments in this so-called comedy.The picture is pretty much a miss.  I laughed out loud at two of Mr. Spacey's lines; the rest of the jokes fell flat, some embarrassingly so.  Camilla Belle is wasted but looks pretty as Axle's daughter, Claire.  In the end, the whole thing degenerates into a standard ""I lost my family and I've got to get them back"" theme, the sort of family comedy you've seen already too many times until the plots and casts all blur together in a whirl of schmaltz and sappy music.  Father of Invention has little point, no real comedy and a premise that few people will identify with.  I watched it just an hour ago, but made a point to write this review before I forgot about it completely.

You can't take the movie seriously when the set up is ridiculous - Spacey, a successful, wealthy, entrepreneur, loses everything when a product of his kills someone. This is just dumb, since he would have product liability insurance, not to mention a company which protects you from losing your personal money...So, the initial assumption is this is just a spoof and the plot and characters are not meant to be taken seriously.  But the movie quickly veers into an oh so unoriginal white male redemption story, as Spacey (now poor and penniless) tries to reconnect with his daughter who abhors him.  It's unclear if the intent is to take the character seriously, or laugh at him (although nothing is very funny in the film). Daughter takes pity on Spacey, and their relationship is on the mend (yawn).  The movie is neither funny, entertaining, or poignant and it is quite painful to watch.

The actors are all good in their roles, but the characterization was so quirky that immediately caring about any one in particular was difficult, especially because I was having a hard time figuring out what the purpose of the movie is.  As the story moved on, however, I started to connect and get in to what was happening on screen.  Kevin Spacey gives a layered performance as a 'fabricator' (like inventor, but someone who takes two ideas and combines them into a different product) who ends up in jail after one of his inventions maims people.  The story mainly takes place once he is released from jail and trying to reconnect with his family, his daughter in particular.I found the supporting characters to be the most entertaining as the film moved on as they all helped flesh out the main story while having stories of their own that somehow connect back to what is going on with Spacey's character.  The film has potential, but I would not say it is perfect.  Too much of what goes on early feels disconnected and random until the end when it all pulls back together.  There are a few loose threads I would have liked to see knotted together as well.Overall The Father of Invention, though quirky, is entertaining and surprisingly touching in its way without being overly mushy.

1453712,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005CA4SHO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I can imagine the pitch session for Trent Cooper's satire ""Father of Invention,"" and I'm willing to bet it was quite good. I have no doubt that you could cobble the ideas behind the film into a gut-busting parody on the age of infomercials. It's such a fantastic target as that industry exists almost solely on parodying itself. Sadly, though, the cleverness that you might expect going after such a rich and comical topic is not mined with very much efficiency in this film's screenplay. As Kevin Spacey kicks off the movie introducing some delightfully silly products, I thought we had a winner. But then the movie instantly takes you away from its funniest moments to set up a premise that I didn't believe for even one second. That's okay, though, I decided to go with the flow and see what kind of zany comic antics were in store. For my taste, though, the slapstick shenanigans and kicks to the groin didn't rate many laughs. There is a talented cast at work here: Kevin Spacey, Virginia Madsen, Heather Graham, Johnny Knoxville, Craig Robinson, and Camilla Belle. Sadly, however, the film is wildly uneven with obvious jokes and physical humor that fall flat and scenarios that don't make a lot of sense and/or aren't particularly amusing.Spacey plays Robert Axle, a fabricator (not an inventor, but someone who puts two existing ideas together to make an even better product). Wildly successful, one of his triumphs ends up mutilating the consumers that have bought the item. The film asks us to believe that Spacey (a multi-millionaire) went to prison for eight years because of this and that his wife (Madsen) was allowed to keep half of his fortune untouched by lawsuits. Neither half of the preceding sentence was believable to me, but as it was the film's premise established in the first five minutes--I had to go with it. Apparently Spacey's corporate mismanagement was enough to have him treated like a hardened criminal and he is completely ostracized in the outside world. Still hoping for a clever comedy about how he gets back into the game, we are treated instead to a more lackluster story line of him trying to reconnect with his daughter (Belle). Of course, the movie is rife with wacky characters each more sketchily drawn than the last. When the screenplay is at a loss about how to get its next laugh (and they are few and far between), it goes for a cheap shot (aforementioned kicks to the groin, lesbian humor, slapstick pratfalls) that oftentimes have nothing to do with advancing the plot.Eventually, the movie does get Spacey back into the business (with Knoxville as his partner in another turn of events that makes little sense). Finally hoping for some hard edged satire, the movie then wants to go soft and play out as a relationship drama. What has Spacey learned about his evil ways? And is it too late to reconnect with his daughter? At a launch party for a new idea, Spacey gives the most awkward, unprofessional and baffling speech imaginable that would absolutely be disastrous for his business partners, but (this being a movie) the crowd is rapturously enthused. Who says you can't have it all? Not funny enough by half already, any good will you might have goes south with these ""lesson learned"" moments.Spacey does his best, it's nice to see him in a change-of-pace role. Knoxville in underutilized and underwriten. Madsen and especially Robinson (he's the only one I actually liked as a character) fare the best in terms of bringing a few laughs. Graham, a likable actress, is stranded in the piece's most obnoxious role. Seriously, I like all of these actors but the screenplay lets everyone down. I guess I'm still waiting for the great infomercial satire that I had hoped this would provide. Clumsy and unfunny, this takes a good idea and wants to be something for everyone when it should have attempted a scathing and hard-edged wit that befits its subject matter. A curious misfire recommended only if you are a passionate fan of one of the actors.

1453713,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B005CA4SHO,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","""Father of Invention"" was directed by Trent Cooper who directed Larry the Cable Guy - Health Inspector. The film seems to want to break into a rollicking comedy, but it achieves mild amusement more than hilarity. Granted, senses of humor vary, but it gives one pause when a film aims to be more funny than it is. Kevin Spacey is a master talent; there is no doubt about that. He makes this story almost worth watching. As a billionaire released from prison penniless and ragged trying to find a place to get a start again, he moves us despite the silly inventions or fabrications upon which he made his former fortune. His daughter is played by Camilla Belle who did such a great job in The Ballad of Jack and Rose. She goes through a wonderful array of emotions and colors as a daughter who loves her father and is ashamed of him at the same time. The problem in this film is that she's not funny. On the other hand, Heather Graham as the lesbian roommate, Virginia Madsen as the mother and Craig Robinson as the Madsen's new husband all get in the spirit. The outtake at the end as the credits role where an off-key Madsen & Robinson on piano play an off-color song is probably the funniest point in the film. Kevin Spacey is certainly worth watching, but overall FOI falls short of the mark.

What makes this one special for me, is the ever amazing performance of Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, Superman  Returns). No matter what his roles - he seems to make them his own and in a way that you either love his characters or you hate them. Playing Robert Axel and inventor of junk products who lead a billion dollar company only to be sued into prison for not labeling the safety issues on a stomach stretcher - he is left with nothing. His ex-wife went on to splurge her half of his millions (played by an energetic, but a little loony Virginia Madsen (Fraiser, Monk  leaving him flat broke after eight years in prison and separated from his now extremely independent daughter played by Camilla Bell (The Patriot. Push). His daughter doesn't understand his pain and repentance and he doesn't understand he independence and lack of interest in keeping in touch with her father the criminal.The movie starts of really slow and with little more than fake commercials and typical one-liners about a billionaire being slapped down and sent to prison...however a little more than halfway through Kevin begins to shine and his character changes his goals and persona all for the love of his daughter. This movie was directed by Trent Cooper (Larry The Cable Guy) and does have the low budget `feel' to it - but it has a big heart by the end. The movie is off a little in its beets of comedy and dram but moves consistently. There are some great funny moments with a lesbian roommate played by Heather Graham (Bowfinger, Austin Powers, Scrubs) and the new husband of his ex played by Craig Robinson (The Office, Cleveland Show). There's even a cameo from John Stamos (Full House, Glee) - who motivates Kevin even further in a very funny way.It would be a great family film and some sensitive issues about priorities with family, ambition and work are definitely dealt with in this film. Overall a great showcase of light drama and comedy.

This excellent indie film should appeal to everyone interested in an endearing story that is told with emotional depth, maturity and humor.Kevin Spacey is the right man for the lead role of Robert Axle, a disgraced TV pitch-man who is desperately seeking a shot at redemption. Spacey might well have imagined the character and his subtleties from the many years he himself has spent in and out of the Hollywood spotlight.

This is ensemble acting at its best.  The actors bring their characters to life and pull together to make the story work. In fact, if there is a criticism to be had, it might be related to the studio's questionable decision to market the film as a comedy: although the film has plenty of humor, in my view the movie's strengths have much more to do with its plot, character development and life affirming messages than its comic turns.I highly recommend ""Father of Invention"" for everyone interested in a solid piece of filmmaking that wants to appeal to your heart and soul.",4,Heart and soul,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,1621,"['Father', 'Invention', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'featuring', 'all-star', 'cast', 'led', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Refreshingly', 'free', 'overproduction', 'special', 'effects', 'weigh', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'today', 'Father', 'Invention', 'simply', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'actors', 'excellent', 'indie', 'film', 'should', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'interested', 'endearing', 'story', 'told', 'emotional', 'depth', 'maturity', 'humor.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'right', 'man', 'lead', 'role', 'Robert', 'Axle', 'disgraced', 'TV', 'pitch-man', 'who', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'shot', 'redemption', 'Spacey', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'imagined', 'character', 'subtleties', 'many', 'years', 'spent', 'Hollywood', 'spotlight', 'Spacey', 'nuanced', 'winning', 'performance', 'dramatizing', 'conflicts', 'career', 'ambition', 'family', 'responsibilities', 'personal', 'relationships.Not', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'Healther', 'Graham', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'John', 'Stamos', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Anna', 'Anissimova', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'best', 'actors', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'pull', 'together', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'fact', 'criticism', 'be', 'had', 'might', 'be', 'related', 'studio', 'questionable', 'decision', 'market', 'film', 'comedy', 'film', 'plenty', 'humor', 'view', 'movie', 'strengths', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'life', 'affirming', 'messages', 'comic', 'turns.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Father', 'Invention', 'everyone', 'interested', 'solid', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'appeal', 'heart', 'soul']",N/A

What a fantastic cast this movie had, and all of them giving stellar performances.  Unfortunately they gave stellar performances of a script that had no idea what it wanted to be.  Starting off as a satirical comedy, delving into lifetime drama, a minute or two of random slapstick, then back to heartfelt drama... in the end it makes these wonderful performances completely forgettable.Had this film decided to go the route of a comedy and been funny yet touching from beginning to end it would have been great... had this been a heart-wrenching drama of a man trying to reconnect with his daughter after living as a self absorbed douche for most of his life, it would have been good.  But the all over the ball park format of this film leaves the audience tuned out.As far as the extras, there is only a VERY short making of video that was almost a waste of time.  Just short 30 second interviews with a few of the cast members.The theme of this movie is strong, and I would love to see it explored further - the connection that people should have with their children, and how today's society of fast paced jobs, video games and constant attention hounding electronics dampen what should be quality connection time between people.  But the film never moved me.  In fact it was very upsetting to see such fantastic talent wasted.For those of you who are unfamiliar here is a short synopsis:Kevin Spacey plays a TV huckster who sells ""fabrications"" (you know... the stupid inventions on late night TV) and gets put in prison after one of his fabrications injures people.

Brought home by a solid lead performance in Kevin Spacey, who transitions Robert Axle well between the veneer of success and confidence to the underlying uncertainties in his personal life. Axle is an expert at taking seemingly unrelated ideas and putting them together to make something new (sometimes useful, sometimes dangerous) - but he can't seem to put his own life together.

It's not completely awful, but it's just OK when it should have been much better.The cast is promising.  Kevin Spacey is a great actor and there's also Virginia Madsen and several other familiar actors.  And the premise of an infomercial guru (Robert Axle, played by Kevin Spacey) who lost everything when he went to prison and now is out and wants to start over sounded good.  So I think that leaves the script as the issue.  It seems like the writer/director couldn't started the movie as a spoof on informercials and then decided to throw in a little family reconciliation drama.  With elements of both types in the same movie, it doesn't work very well for either one.The issues with this movie that keep it merely OK are pretty subtle.  The stuff that was supposed to be funny didn't make me laugh much and the stuff that was supposed to make me care about the characters often just confused me.  There was a scene with Kevin Spacey's character playing at the park with a little boy (that never would have happened given how shady he still looked at the time) that seemed really random.  Now that I think about it, I realize how it was supposed to fit in, but the director never really connected the dots.A lot of the characters never got beyond cariactures so you don't get any kind of deep feel for them.  And Kevin Spacey's character flip-flopped between understanding how much people hated him and being completely oblivious.  That character wasn't particularly likeable so it was hard to root for him to succeed, either in business or with his relationship with his daughter.  And the angry roommate's character (played by Heather Graham) was all over the place and ended up just confusing me.But the movie wasn't terrible either.  It just missed good and ended up at OK.If you want a movie that will make you laugh and also care about the father character when he realizes his striving for professional success has costs to his family, I suggestWin Win Win.

He's starting from rock bottom.Reading that description, it has some potential, but very little is realized, and I really do place most of the fault on the embarrassing script.  In addition to Mr. Spacey, there's a strong supporting cast with many familiar faces, and as noted above, the performances were strong.  However, there weren't scenes I liked, so much as individual moments.  That's a little sad.The only DVD extra was a brief ""making of"" featurette.  Not only was it not even remotely interesting, it was borderline offensive when the director compared Father of Invention to a Billy Wilder film.

Thankfully, I guess, I got lucky and rather enjoyed this movie.  Spacey turned in a decent performance, as did the rest of the cast, and equally thankfully the script/story was entertaining enough to offer me a reasonable amount of pleasure.While it isn't at the five star level for me, or, I suspect, for most movie watchers, it settled nicely into the 3.5 range, which I rounded up just because I'm still in a somewhat giving mood following the holiday season.  I'm not sure that I would have wanted to think about paying full price to see this in theatres, but on home video it was good enough to earn a buy it recommendation.  Kevin Spacey fans would probably get more out of the experience, while those that, for some reason, don't care for him would be best to avoid, but again it was good enough for me.Some readers of this review might be disappointed at a lack of many spoilers or plot description.

In my humble opinion, he is in a class of elite actors that can actually become a character.  Therefore the only thing I knew before watching ""Father of Invention"" was that Kevin Spacey would give a great performance.  When the movie was over my assumption had been correct.With regards to the plot it is somewhat simpleton maybe even trite.  Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) is an inventor of various products that one would find on an infomercial.  Unfortunately one of his products ends up severely harming a consumer and the aftermath ends up landing Mr. Axle in federal prison for eight years. Once released from prison, Axle finds that his life is in a state of condemnation.  He is broke, his name is mud, his marriage has ended and relationship with his daughter is strained. Notwithstanding, Axle is prepared to do what it takes to build his life back together and rebuild his finical empire.I found the movie to be both predicable yet refreshingly different.  What the movie lacks in story, it compensates in the performance of its characters.  This film featured quite a bit of talent, Heather Graham, Camilla Belle, Jack McGee, Johnny Knoxville (which I found surprising) and Virginia Madsen (whom I am rather fond of).  This movie had a good balance of drama and humor.  This film also wasn't pretentious, yet didn't take itself too seriously.In closing, ""Father of Invention"" wasn't the greatest movie I have ever seen, it isn't going to win any awards, none of the actors or actress will be remembered for their involvement in this film, yet there was something about it that gave it charm.  This charm made a rather simple film much more endearing.  I suppose if someone is looking for a non-stop action movie, a moot remake movie, a CGI film and/or a movie filled with potty humor then this movie will not be enjoyed.  I for one found it a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes.",4,Much better than it should be,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1922,"['have', 'always', 'fan', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'humble', 'opinion', 'class', 'elite', 'actors', 'can', 'actually', 'become', 'character', 'Therefore', 'only', 'thing', 'knew', 'watching', 'Father', 'Invention', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'would', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'assumption', 'had', 'been', 'correct.With', 'regards', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'simpleton', 'maybe', 'even', 'trite', 'Robert', 'Axle', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'inventor', 'various', 'products', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'infomercial', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'products', 'up', 'severely', 'harming', 'consumer', 'aftermath', 'up', 'landing', 'Mr.', 'Axle', 'federal', 'prison', 'eight', 'years', 'Once', 'released', 'prison', 'Axle', 'life', 'state', 'condemnation', 'broke', 'name', 'mud', 'marriage', 'ended', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'strained', 'Notwithstanding', 'Axle', 'prepared', 'do', 'what', 'build', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'rebuild', 'finical', 'empire.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'predicable', 'yet', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'What', 'movie', 'story', 'performance', 'characters', 'film', 'featured', 'quite', 'bit', 'talent', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'Jack', 'McGee', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'found', 'surprising', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'whom', 'am', 'rather', 'fond', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'balance', 'drama', 'humor', 'film', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'pretentious', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously.In', 'closing', 'Father', 'Invention', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'none', 'actors', 'actress', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'involvement', 'film', 'yet', 'was', 'something', 'gave', 'charm', 'charm', 'made', 'rather', 'simple', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'endearing', 'suppose', 'someone', 'looking', 'non-stop', 'action', 'movie', 'moot', 'remake', 'movie', 'CGI', 'film', 'and/or', 'movie', 'filled', 'potty', 'humor', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'found', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes']",N/A

Father of Invention tells a tale of ego struggle.  Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey), is a successful ""inventor"" who markets unique products that sell billions in profit.  He is sued over a product that injures people, spends eight years in prison, and returns to rebuild his life.  While Robert is in prison, his company remakes itself in another image, his wife (Virginia Madsen  divorces him, his daughter (Camilla Belle) feels he abandoned her, and he is forced to begin again with zero resources.Robert cons his daughter into staying in her apartment while he begins a new job.Claire's roommates Phoebe (Heather Graham), and Donna (Anna Anissimova) dislike Robert and regularly harass him.Robert Axle is a troubled man.  His focus has been on his job and making money.  He doesn't think he has a problem.  His wife and daughter disagree.  His employees disagree.  When Robert has trouble he blames others.  The thousands of people who were hurt by his invention, didn't use it correctly - they put their fingers in stupid places.  His wife and daughter drifting away from him have a problem in his eyes, not him.When a person is in trouble, blames other people and fails to see his own responsibility for his struggle, what does it take for him to admit he even has a problem?  How does he overcome denial?  How does he discover that he must focus upon his own behavior?  This movie provides a beginning of an answer to such questions.Father of Invention is a decent movie.  It has several very funny scenes, but is not really a comedy.  This film is really a movie about accepting life and relationships.
