The four segments are not equally good, the only segment that stands out is the final one with John Lithgow. He is such a brilliant and intense actor, only he can pull off that classic William Shatner episode. Kick the Can and It's a Good Life are pretty outrageous and lame.

I always believed their were so many better episodes of The Zone to redo. The perfect candidate was ""Nightmare"" and that was done well, but the others lost something in the transfer(to film). We all have our favorite episodes, so it is subjective. People who love and appreciate the Twilight Zone will always look away from the flaws in this film and see it as a trying attempt to elevate the original tv series into a big screen splendour that succeeds.  Its a shame the sci fi know it all ""critics"" such as one I recently read use this forum to tear apart other comments by reviewers. These writtings are intended for mindless fun, and everyone is their own critic, even if they get the facts wrong. An imput of correction is fine, but to devote nearly an entire review into a continual rant against another person is infantile. It totally discredits that person. I know I'm on a bit of a soap box myself, but it had to be said.I will purchase this DVD and enjoy it for what it is, a minor homage to the epitome of sci fi television.

460488,AV30RYVPJJJ34,630533580X,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[0, 1]","I have read reviews saying that people are disappointed because there was no gore, or disappointed because the transfer wasn't to their standards.... GET OVER IT.  Twilight Zone the movie is very underrated in my opinion.  This movie pays great homage to the TV show produced by Rod Sterling. This film is a fantasy, sci-fi, horror, and I tend to believe that it is done in such a format that most ages can watch it.  For a movie to be good it doesn't have to have gore.  If a film can make you think differently about a situation then the writer director has accomplished a great job.  The first story about the racist having to suffer the lives of those who he discriminated make you think outside the box about racism.  The second is a light hearted tale where the elderly have a second chance at being young again, this segment is suitable for all ages.  The third installment is just weird but exciting as cartoon elements are weaved into reality by a adolescent. The final tale, although it doesn't show a drop of blood is scary as hell.  I recall watching this when I was a kid and I blame that darned gremlin ripping the plane apart to be my reason for hating to travel by aviation.  Even to this day the gremlin and plane creep me out.  I suggest, buy this, but do note there is not one drop of blood in this film, and although I am a gore hound, this collection is still worth the buy.",5,Underrated,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,1395,"['have', 'read', 'reviews', 'saying', 'people', 'are', 'disappointed', 'was', 'gore', 'disappointed', 'transfer', 'was', ""n't"", 'standards', 'GET', 'IT', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'movie', 'very', 'underrated', 'opinion', 'movie', 'great', 'homage', 'TV', 'show', 'produced', 'Rod', 'Sterling', 'film', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'tend', 'believe', 'done', 'such', 'format', 'most', 'ages', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'be', 'good', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'gore', 'film', 'can', 'make', 'think', 'differently', 'situation', 'then', 'writer', 'director', 'accomplished', 'great', 'job', 'first', 'story', 'racist', 'having', 'suffer', 'lives', 'who', 'discriminated', 'make', 'think', 'box', 'racism', 'second', 'light', 'hearted', 'tale', 'where', 'elderly', 'have', 'second', 'chance', 'being', 'young', 'again', 'segment', 'suitable', 'ages', 'third', 'installment', 'just', 'weird', 'exciting', 'cartoon', 'elements', 'are', 'weaved', 'reality', 'adolescent', 'final', 'tale', ""n't"", 'show', 'drop', 'blood', 'scary', 'hell', 'recall', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'blame', 'darned', 'gremlin', 'ripping', 'plane', 'apart', 'be', 'reason', 'hating', 'travel', 'aviation', 'Even', 'day', 'gremlin', 'plane', 'creep', 'suggest', 'buy', 'do', 'note', 'not', 'one', 'drop', 'blood', 'film', 'am', 'gore', 'hound', 'collection', 'still', 'worth', 'buy']",Twilight Zone VHS

I'm glad I did because while this film had moments, it was an overall disappointment. The start of the film was good but Aykroyd turning into a monster at the start of the film made me scratch my head.The first film is surrounded in contraversy because the actor died on set. It started off pretty good with a man getting passed over for a promotion and he runs down races. He gets transported into different times that were hard for the races. The only part that I hated was the ending was beyond stupid and I hated it. For a PG movie, this one really pushes the censors with alot of racist terms.The second film was a remake of the classic epsiode Kick The Can. I hated this film and it's probably Speilberg's worst effort.The third film was awful. The first few minutes were nothing but references to different towns in original Twilight Zone epsiodes and even a directors name. The rest of the film just sucked and was unwatchable.The final film featured John Lithgow in a remake of Nightmare at 5,000 feet. Lithgow did a great job as the lead actor and was by far the best story on the film.Overall, started good but things got out of control. The final story was good but not enough for me to go out and recommend it to anyone.",3,Twilight Zone The Movie,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,1339,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'watch', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'because', 'film', 'had', 'moments', 'was', 'overall', 'disappointment', 'start', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'Aykroyd', 'turning', 'monster', 'start', 'film', 'made', 'scratch', 'head.The', 'first', 'film', 'surrounded', 'contraversy', 'actor', 'died', 'set', 'started', 'off', 'pretty', 'good', 'man', 'getting', 'passed', 'promotion', 'down', 'races', 'transported', 'different', 'times', 'were', 'hard', 'races', 'only', 'part', 'hated', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'stupid', 'hated', 'PG', 'movie', 'one', 'really', 'censors', 'alot', 'racist', 'terms.The', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'remake', 'classic', 'epsiode', 'Kick', 'Can', 'hated', 'film', 'probably', 'Speilberg', 'worst', 'effort.The', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'awful', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'were', 'nothing', 'references', 'different', 'towns', 'original', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'epsiodes', 'even', 'directors', 'name', 'rest', 'film', 'just', 'sucked', 'was', 'unwatchable.The', 'final', 'film', 'featured', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'remake', 'Nightmare', '5,000', 'feet', 'Lithgow', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'lead', 'actor', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'story', 'film.Overall', 'started', 'good', 'things', 'got', 'control', 'final', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'enough', 'go', 'out', 'recommend', 'anyone']",Twilight Zone VHS

So they try to amuse themselves in playing various games. Remember the line, ""Do you want to see something REALLY scary?""In the first episode, a drunken bigot in a small town bar gets justice when he walks out of the bar after having insulted everyone into the Twilight Zone where he is chased by Nazis, Vietcong, American soldiers, the KKK, and back to the Nazis.The second segment involves Scatman Cruthers persuading the residents of an old people's home to go out and play, and become young again.In the third one, Ellen Foley, a teacher, meets a very exceptional boy.

I was only 12 when this movie was released. But now I've been reading up on the events that caused the tragedy f this film. I've learned who Vic morrow was. A very accomplished actor that had starred in a lot of movies and shows. Plus being the father of Jennifer Jason Leigh. He was a very good actor, and was very good in this movie.But I have very little respect for John landis. This guy didn't comply with safety rules and regulations. He broke child labor laws. His arrogance cost morrow and the two children there lives. And to top it off  he's never taken responsibility for the accident. But it's ok, he's still living the Hollywood life. Making mega hit movies etc. and to top it off they never mentioned a rememberence in the memory of the fallen actors. I think it was one of the biggest tragedys in movie making history. Although I am a fan of landis's films. Not a fan of him after reading all that I've read about his actions before and after this accident. Watch the extras of the blues brothers DVD. Landis comes across as very arrogant. Probably his arrogance is what caused the deaths during this film.As for the movie, it's average.

Fortunately, four gifted directors were assigned to the four different stories. Segment 1 has John Landis (ANIMAL HOUSE, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, INNOCENT BLOOD) serving up a morality tale about racism, w/ Vic Morrow in his final role. Morrow does his best ""angry white guy"", reminding me of some old relatives of my own, who have -thankfully- passed on. Next, Steven Spielberg (DUEL, JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, E.T.) offers up the lightest, most unapologetically cheerful segment, w/ Scatman Crothers as a mysterious visitor to a rest home, bent on helping the residents to unleash their inner children. Though sappy, I still enjoy it. In segment 3, Joe Dante (GREMLINS) re-imagines the TZ story w/ the bratty kid (originally played by Bill Mumy) who gets whatever he wishes for. Kathleen Quinlan plays the woman who stumbles into this nightmare. Finally, segment 4, directed by George Miller (MAD MAX TRILOGY), takes us on a plane trip w/ an insanely terrified passenger, John Lithgow, who just might have seen a monster on the wing, tearing apart the engines!

Here it seems they just want to have some fun, and create something Strange. If that Was their Intention, They have Succeeded. The film starts strange and gets more so, but it also gets better as it goes along.First up is John Landis with a Short Comical Prolong (starring Dan Ackroyd and Albert Brooks), followed by his Episode about a Racist man being shown how it feels to be the brunt of his racism. Steven Spielberg's Episode concerns a Retirement village getting their youth back. The Downright Strange award goes to Joe Dante for his entry about a young boy who brings a Strange Woman (Kathleen Quinlan) home to his world, a world he can Control.The Best has been Wisely saved till last. George Miller's Entry has John Lithgow on a Commercial Airliner battling his Fear of Flying while the Pilots battle Turbulence. When he discovers a Monster on the wing of the plane, tearing it to pieces, he panics and causes much commotion, but no one else ever sees the monster, What can you do. This Episode is by Far the Greatest; it makes everything you've seen (or suffered) before it worth it. John Lithgow gives a Wonderfully Panicked Performance, he is Totally believable at All times. He and Miller make the Absurd story Totally Realistic and Believable. I was glued to the Screen.You would think that someone only liking One of Four episodes wouldn't recommend it, but I would as Millers episode is Pure Genius, Dante's episode is Pretty Interesting and the other two are at best, Ok.

This omnibus film features updated versions of three famous episodes and one new entry as directed by genre greats John Landis, Joe Dante, George Miller, and Steven Spielberg. The first story follows a steaming racist who is transported back in time through Nazi Germany, to the days of the Ku Klux Klan, and then into the swamps of Vietnam, where he must live out the horrifying life experiences of the people he claims to hate. Up next, the residents of Sunnyvale rest home are in for a treat when a magical game of Kick the Can restores their youth for one last night of fun. A young woman falls under the spell of a young telepath who has trapped her in his twisted dream world along with the rest of his fearful family in the third entry. Finally, an unfortunate passenger with a fear of flying spots a hideous creature tinkering with the engines, but his attempts to alert the crew only get him detained as the plane begins to plummet! TWILIGHT ZONE boasts a star-studded cast, including appearances by Dan Akroyd, Albert Brooks, Vic Morrow, Scatman Crothers, Kevin McCarthy, Dick Miller, John Lithgow, and many others. The film gets off to a mediocre start with Landis' ironic morality tale that more closely resembles the EC comic stylings from the 1950's, and then moves on to Spielberg's more sentimental approach to the series. These first two entries are only mildly entertaining, but Joe Dante and George Miller prove to be the big winners with the last two shorts. Miller's retelling of Nightmare at 20,000 Feet is a frantic and terrifying tale of paranoia and fear, itself, that offers up one of John Lithgow's most memorable performances.

However, Twilight Zone: the Movie was one of my favorite movies of my college years. I enjoyed the original series, but was never a fanatic. What captivated me about this movie, in particular the 3rd and 4th segments, was the atmosphere established by the filmmakers. The first segment with Vic Morrow is undoubtedly the weakest...there were obviously some script changes necessary due to his tragic death, and what we're left with is a predictable, trite, and even cruel story of a bigot who spouts a few angry words at the beginning then pays for it a thousand-fold. It's like watching someone being slowly tortured to learn a lesson then executed at the end just to make SURE he learned his lesson. The second segment is syrupy, but has the wonderful Scatman Crothers and some amusing moments with the old folks turning into kids. The third segment was my favorite. I always thought some of those old cartoons from the thirties were very creepy in their surreal quality, and watching this segment is like watching someone's nightmare of those old cartoons gone berserk. Of interest is the doomed sister, Ethel, who later on became the voice of Bart Simpson...she really DID get stuck in Cartoonland! And the fourth segment is pretty wonderful too, due to a comic twist on the horror provided by the script and John Lithgow's performance. Towering above the entire movie, though, is Jerry Goldsmith's score...one of his best and one of my three favorite film scores of all time. It truly adds to the eerieness of the first, third and fourth segments and while the second section pours on the schmaltzy strings, on its own it makes a GREAT listen with a memorable theme.",3,More atmosphere than shocks,972950400,"10 31, 2000",2000,1752,"['quot', 'Hey', 'ya', 'see', 'something', 'REALLY', 'scary', 'quot', 'Well', 'watch', 'movie', 'However', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Movie', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'college', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'fanatic', 'What', 'captivated', 'movie', 'particular', '3rd', '4th', 'segments', 'was', 'atmosphere', 'established', 'filmmakers', 'first', 'segment', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'undoubtedly', 'weakest', 'were', 'obviously', 'script', 'changes', 'necessary', 'due', 'tragic', 'death', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'predictable', 'trite', 'even', 'cruel', 'story', 'bigot', 'who', 'few', 'angry', 'words', 'beginning', 'then', 'thousand-fold', 'watching', 'someone', 'being', 'slowly', 'tortured', 'learn', 'lesson', 'then', 'executed', 'end', 'just', 'make', 'SURE', 'learned', 'lesson', 'second', 'segment', 'syrupy', 'wonderful', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'amusing', 'moments', 'old', 'folks', 'turning', 'kids', 'third', 'segment', 'was', 'favorite', 'always', 'thought', 'old', 'cartoons', 'thirties', 'were', 'very', 'creepy', 'surreal', 'quality', 'watching', 'segment', 'watching', 'someone', 'nightmare', 'old', 'cartoons', 'gone', 'berserk', 'interest', 'doomed', 'sister', 'Ethel', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'voice', 'Bart', 'Simpson', 'really', 'DID', 'get', 'stuck', 'Cartoonland', 'fourth', 'segment', 'pretty', 'wonderful', 'too', 'due', 'comic', 'twist', 'horror', 'provided', 'script', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'performance', 'Towering', 'entire', 'movie', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'three', 'favorite', 'film', 'scores', 'time', 'truly', 'eerieness', 'first', 'third', 'fourth', 'segments', 'second', 'section', 'pours', 'schmaltzy', 'strings', 'own', 'GREAT', 'listen', 'memorable', 'theme']",Twilight Zone VHS
460503,A39L5T2ZQZ52FN,630533580X,David Michael Cohen,"[14, 32]","The 80's were marked by two prevailing philosophies: 1) Anything good can and should be improved and 2) If a little is good, a whole lot is better. Both of these ideas saturate The Twilight Zone movie and ultimately ruin it. First of all, three Twilight Zone stories are butchered and the immense talent of their stars wasted by the excesses of the directors. The &quot;Kick The Can&quot; segment suffers from syrupy emotionality and an absurd role for Scatman Cruthers.  In the original story an old man draws on his memories and his inspiration to evoke the plot's transformation.  In the movie, Cruthers appears as a sort of &quot;tin can fairy&quot; giving the &quot;gift&quot; of youth to old people everywhere (implying that the elderly cannot have inspirations themselves). The &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot; episode features a way over the top performance by John Lithgow. He screams and emotes for what seems like an hour before the actual nightmare begins. By that time the audience is exhausted and the &quot;nightmare&quot; is trivialized!  It also ignores thirty years of airport security regulations. The segment that suffers the most is the &quot;It's a Good Life&quot; portion. Although it provides a creepy atmoshphere it ends on a ridiculously upbeat note.  While justice was a common element in the original series, in the movie the villian is never held accountable for his crimes, nor does he seem to rectify damge he caused to people, some happy ending. The segment written specifically or the movie breaks off without satisfactory resolution. Yes, I know the intended resolution was scrapped when two children died in the filming, but if the story doesn't conclude why include any of it? The wrap around material with Dan Akroyd was intended for laughs. In general attempts at humor on the show did not work well. At least they kept this element of the series, as the &quot;humorous&quot; segment comes out not funny but inane.

Also, the recreation of &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 feet&quot; was a good attempt at recreating a classic story, but just doesn't hold up to the imagination of the original.I may be somewhat biased because I am a true fan of the original Twilight Zone, but this movie is part of the collection since it does attempt to give us a new take on the Twilight Zone stories and includes a new story not from the series as well.

Everyone from this story is still alive.It's my opinion that John Lithgow could just do a commentary on ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" all by himself.But we also need Dan Ackroyd and Albert Brooks to talk about the beginning and the end.Just wondering, what was the actual title of the first story?

460517,AGVIUNALLAV3Q,630533580X,H. Frick,"[1, 1]","I remember seeing this movie in a theater when it originally came out. I really liked it at that time, but I think it has not aged well. For all the gory detail on the movie, see the WIKI pages: [...]On the intro, I liked the first scene with the car cutting through the dark landscape and CCR playing Midnight Special, but then the dialog between the two men in the car was too lengthy and sounded forced to me.The first segment I thought was pretty good, especially for the message it sends (you could think of it as Karma on steroids). The main actor, cursing out loud in a bar on Jews, Blacks and Asian people, gets a load of ""karmic revenge"" when suddenly transferred to Nazi Germany as a Jew, as a Black hunted down by the Ku-Klux-Klan, and (presumably) as a Vietnamese during the Vietnam war. My wife made a comment that ""he will come back as a changed man"", and supposedly the original script had him save two Vietnamese children and indeed return a better human, but this episode was cut short by the tragic accident on the set. The resulting ending showing him deported in a train with other Jews does leave you craving for a more satisfying conclusion.The second segment is probably the weakest. Spielberg's contribution is indeed overly sentimental, the acting a little overplayed and the story not really dramatic. The likeable old black man going from one retirement home to the next does succeed though in showing the elderly that they rightfully so can be proud of the lives they lived, but also not forget that they can still employ a joyful and childlike attitude and still enjoy their remaining years.The third segment is based on a pretty cool idea, a young boy that can make everything reality that he imagines. The ""family"" he has assembled in his house acts pretty creepy at first, until you realize that they are just really fearful of all bad consequences that may happen when disagreeing with the little boy.The fourth and final segment has mostly been found the most entertaining, I would agree. Seeing people smoke on airplanes obviously shows the age of the movie. The acting in this one is pretty realistic, and the story with a gremlin shoving airplane parts into a plane engine at 20,000 feet during a heavy thunderstorm is pretty cool.It is a funny touch that they ended the final segment with bringing back Dan Aykroyd's character from the opening scene, offering to show ""something really scary"".",3,Twilight Zone: The Movie,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,2431,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'really', 'liked', 'time', 'think', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'gory', 'detail', 'movie', 'see', 'WIKI', 'pages', '[', ']', 'intro', 'liked', 'first', 'scene', 'car', 'cutting', 'dark', 'landscape', 'CCR', 'playing', 'Midnight', 'Special', 'then', 'dialog', 'two', 'men', 'car', 'was', 'too', 'lengthy', 'sounded', 'forced', 'me.The', 'first', 'segment', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'message', 'could', 'think', 'Karma', 'steroids', 'main', 'actor', 'cursing', 'out', 'loud', 'bar', 'Jews', 'Blacks', 'Asian', 'people', 'load', 'karmic', 'revenge', 'when', 'suddenly', 'transferred', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Jew', 'Black', 'hunted', 'down', 'Ku-Klux-Klan', 'presumably', 'Vietnamese', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'wife', 'made', 'comment', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'changed', 'man', 'supposedly', 'original', 'script', 'had', 'save', 'two', 'Vietnamese', 'children', 'indeed', 'return', 'better', 'human', 'episode', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'tragic', 'accident', 'set', 'resulting', 'ending', 'showing', 'deported', 'train', 'other', 'Jews', 'leave', 'craving', 'more', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.The', 'second', 'segment', 'probably', 'weakest', 'Spielberg', 'contribution', 'indeed', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'acting', 'little', 'overplayed', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'dramatic', 'likeable', 'old', 'black', 'man', 'going', 'one', 'retirement', 'home', 'next', 'succeed', 'showing', 'elderly', 'rightfully', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'lives', 'lived', 'also', 'not', 'forget', 'can', 'still', 'employ', 'joyful', 'childlike', 'attitude', 'still', 'enjoy', 'remaining', 'years.The', 'third', 'segment', 'based', 'pretty', 'cool', 'idea', 'young', 'boy', 'can', 'make', 'everything', 'reality', 'family', 'assembled', 'house', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'first', 'realize', 'are', 'just', 'really', 'fearful', 'bad', 'consequences', 'may', 'happen', 'when', 'disagreeing', 'little', 'boy.The', 'fourth', 'final', 'segment', 'mostly', 'been', 'found', 'most', 'entertaining', 'would', 'agree', 'Seeing', 'people', 'smoke', 'airplanes', 'obviously', 'age', 'movie', 'acting', 'one', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'story', 'gremlin', 'shoving', 'airplane', 'parts', 'plane', 'engine', '20,000', 'feet', 'heavy', 'thunderstorm', 'pretty', 'cool.It', 'funny', 'touch', 'ended', 'final', 'segment', 'bringing', 'back', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'character', 'opening', 'scene', 'offering', 'show', 'something', 'really', 'scary']",Twilight Zone VHS

In the first story directed also directed by John Landis, a racist business man (Vic Morrow) who gets travled back in time to the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's where he becomes the three races he hates the most and becomes the one being hunted. The second story directed by Steven Spielburg is a gentle tale of a special magical old man (Scatman Crothers) that helps a group of senior citizens at a retirement home to make them young again, the third story is directed by Joe Dante (""Gremlins"", ""The Howling"", ""Pirahna"") about a traveling school teacher (Kathleen Quinlan) that accidently hits but doesn't injure a young boy as he gives him a ride home where he invites him to stay for a while with his strange family and discovers that the boy has magical powers that can alter reality and make wishes come true. And the final story directed by George Miller (""Mad Max"") is a terrying story of a nervous airflight passenger (John Lithgow) that sees a strange creature on the wing of the plane trying to destroy the airplane.A splendid anthology of horror and fantasy stories from four directors and inspired by the classic TV series by Rod Sterling. The stories except the first one are based on classic episodes from the TV series while the first tale is a very original story, this movie got me hooked into watching the classic TV series and is a great anthology movie in it's own right. In fact, this was Vic Morrow's last movie cause he died during filming and the film is narrated by Burgess Merideth, this is a must have for fans of the series and anthology movies like ""Creepshow"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""Cat's Eye"", ""Dead of Night"" etc. This one of my personal favorites since i was a kid.The DVD contains great picture and sound quality and the only extra is the theatrical trailer.",5,A great anthology!,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,2095,"['film', 'prologue', 'directed', 'John', 'Landis', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'Animal', 'House', 'pair', 'friends', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'play', 'TV', 'trivia', 'car', 'drive', 'also', 'special', 'scaring', 'contest', 'other', 'then', 'stories', 'begin', 'first', 'story', 'directed', 'also', 'directed', 'John', 'Landis', 'racist', 'business', 'man', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'who', 'travled', 'back', 'time', '1940', '1950', '1960', 'where', 'three', 'races', 'most', 'one', 'being', 'hunted', 'second', 'story', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielburg', 'gentle', 'tale', 'special', 'magical', 'old', 'man', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'group', 'senior', 'citizens', 'retirement', 'home', 'make', 'young', 'again', 'third', 'story', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Gremlins', 'Howling', 'Pirahna', 'traveling', 'school', 'teacher', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'accidently', ""n't"", 'injure', 'young', 'boy', 'ride', 'home', 'where', 'stay', 'while', 'strange', 'family', 'discovers', 'boy', 'magical', 'powers', 'can', 'alter', 'reality', 'make', 'wishes', 'come', 'true', 'final', 'story', 'directed', 'George', 'Miller', 'Mad', 'Max', 'terrying', 'story', 'nervous', 'airflight', 'passenger', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'strange', 'creature', 'wing', 'plane', 'trying', 'destroy', 'airplane.A', 'splendid', 'anthology', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'four', 'directors', 'inspired', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'Rod', 'Sterling', 'stories', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'based', 'classic', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'tale', 'very', 'original', 'story', 'movie', 'got', 'hooked', 'watching', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'great', 'anthology', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'fact', 'was', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'last', 'movie', 'cause', 'died', 'filming', 'film', 'narrated', 'Burgess', 'Merideth', 'must', 'have', 'fans', 'series', 'anthology', 'movies', 'Creepshow', 'Grindhouse', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Cat', 'Eye', 'Dead', 'Night', 'etc', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'i', 'was', 'kid.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'only', 'extra', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",Twilight Zone VHS

460528,A3JHFOZ4PM4478,630533580X,Jon L. Capogrossi,"[2, 3]","The music, the directing style, the special effects, the lighting...that's right, it's the 80's, 1983 specifically, that brings us Twilight Zone the Movie.Yeah, as many have said, it was Spielberg's ""optimistic"" era of filmmaking, he had just finished making E.T. prior... and so as many people point out his episode ""Kick the Can"" is very childlike and easily the most optimistic, or ""sunny"", of the 4 segments (the style of this episode was to me a blueprint for a lot of what later would become ""Amazing Stories"")In the meantime, the other stories are scarier...Of course the movie starts off with the famous John Landis segment (sadly, mostly remembered for the tragic accident) with the late Vic Morrow as the racist who suddenly learns what it is like to be on the other side of racism. It is directed in 80's Landis style and is not unlike his other films of that time as far as style goes, except for the serious tone of the subject. Landis mostly made comedies in the 80's ""Spies Like Us"", ""Into the Night"" etc,..which makes this episode interesting to see...Then there is the third segment with the creepy kid who can make anything he thinks of happen...this segment has some real nightmarish interesting design going on (the house having a picture on the wall of a family with no faces, etc), like a slightly nightmarish cartoon, and Yep the future voice of Bart Simpson Nancy Cartright is the ticked off older ""sister""...the way the kid manipulates these adults into being his surrogate ""family"" is creepy and suspenseful, yet funny. The mechanical special effects of Athnony's ""cartoon-like monsters"" (created by effects expert Rob Bottin) for sure harken back to the 80's in the days before CGI. But to me, models and mechanical effects make the movies of the 80's what they were, and adds to the nostalgia factor in some ways...obviously the EFX, if the film was made now, would all be CGI ...anyways, Joe Dante who directed this segment would go on to make the much more successful Gremlins and so this is a sort of precursor to that ideaThe final story is as everyone says the best....John Lithgow as the worst nervous flyer ever known (besides me, I hate flying)-This is one of the most memorable movie roles he ever did....  The gremlin on the wing of the plane is a trippy looking little creature...the directing, acting, & suspense in this sequence are the best of the 4 stories for sure-cool work from George MillerI saw this movie in the Theaters back when I was a 13 year old kid. As a movie fan who grew up during the heyday of Spielberg and George Lucas, I guess I consider this movie a classic for it's 80's ""throwback"" style...but I think it's production stands the test of time pretty well....I am glad to see this film on DVD and I hope there will be at least a few special features",5,very good 80's filmmaking,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,2812,"['music', 'directing', 'style', 'special', 'effects', 'lighting', 'right', '80', '1983', 'specifically', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Movie.Yeah', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'optimistic', 'era', 'filmmaking', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'making', 'E.T', 'prior', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'point', 'out', 'episode', 'Kick', 'Can', 'very', 'childlike', 'easily', 'most', 'optimistic', 'sunny', '4', 'segments', 'style', 'episode', 'was', 'blueprint', 'lot', 'what', 'later', 'would', 'become', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'meantime', 'other', 'stories', 'are', 'scarier', 'course', 'movie', 'famous', 'John', 'Landis', 'segment', 'sadly', 'mostly', 'remembered', 'tragic', 'accident', 'late', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'racist', 'who', 'suddenly', 'what', 'be', 'other', 'side', 'racism', 'directed', '80', 'Landis', 'style', 'not', 'other', 'films', 'time', 'as', 'far', 'style', 'serious', 'tone', 'subject', 'Landis', 'mostly', 'made', 'comedies', '80', 'Spies', 'Us', 'Night', 'etc', '..which', 'episode', 'interesting', 'see', 'Then', 'third', 'segment', 'creepy', 'kid', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'anything', 'happen', 'segment', 'real', 'nightmarish', 'interesting', 'design', 'going', 'house', 'having', 'picture', 'wall', 'family', 'etc', 'slightly', 'nightmarish', 'cartoon', 'future', 'voice', 'Bart', 'Simpson', 'Nancy', 'Cartright', 'ticked', 'off', 'older', 'sister', 'way', 'kid', 'adults', 'being', 'surrogate', 'family', 'creepy', 'suspenseful', 'yet', 'funny', 'mechanical', 'special', 'effects', 'Athnony', 'cartoon-like', 'monsters', 'created', 'effects', 'expert', 'Rob', 'Bottin', 'sure', 'harken', 'back', '80', 'days', 'CGI', 'models', 'mechanical', 'effects', 'make', 'movies', '80', 'what', 'were', 'nostalgia', 'factor', 'ways', 'obviously', 'EFX', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'CGI', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'who', 'directed', 'segment', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'Gremlins', 'so', 'sort', 'precursor', 'ideaThe', 'final', 'story', 'everyone', 'best', '.John', 'Lithgow', 'worst', 'nervous', 'flyer', 'ever', 'known', 'hate', 'flying', '-This', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'movie', 'roles', 'ever', 'did', 'gremlin', 'wing', 'plane', 'trippy', 'looking', 'little', 'creature', 'directing', 'acting', 'suspense', 'sequence', 'are', 'best', '4', 'stories', 'sure-cool', 'work', 'George', 'MillerI', 'saw', 'movie', 'Theaters', 'back', 'when', 'was', '13', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'movie', 'fan', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'heyday', 'Spielberg', 'George', 'Lucas', 'guess', 'consider', 'movie', 'classic', '80', 'throwback', 'style', 'think', 'production', 'test', 'time', 'pretty', 'well', '.I', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'film', 'DVD', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'least', 'few', 'special', 'features']",Twilight Zone VHS

True Hollywood Story did a piece on it, but that was in 1986 three years after the film's release, & the E! story was told back in 1999, so again, what is the delay? this one had four segments with four different directors with John Landis(Blues Brothers) doing the first one about a racist corporate guy (Morrow) who falls victim to all of history's treatment of those he hates, mainly Jews, African American, & Chinese people, he is forced to live in their shoes & experience his own hatred, this segment of course was cut short because of his death in a stunt gone wrong that would have had him renouncing his hatred & helping those he hates & ultimately redeming himself, this was never realized, but some scenes were shot, but not seen, & maybe Warner Bros. is in legal issues as to whether they should be released, who knows, however this segment is good, the second directed by Speilberg is o.k. but nothing to get excited about that involves elderly people getting a chance to be kids again & then realizing they don't want to be young again, the third is more or less a homage to Looney Tunes directed by Joe Dante(Gremlins) in which a young boy lures a woman(Kathleen Quinlan) to his house that is controlled by his very thoughts, this kid has a mean streak & apparently he is a unseen entity that constantly has Looney Tunes in the background & uses it as a way to terrorize her & others he has brought there as well, this one is out there, but Dante milks it for all its worth & has fun with it, the fourth one directed by George Miller(The Road Warrior) is by far the best one of the four that has John Lithgow as a fearful airline flight passenger who sees a gremlin on the wing of the plane he is on in severe thunderstorm & everyone thinks he is disillusional, Lithgow plays this character to the hilt, he once said it was his favorite role, & it shows, the storm makes it all the more unnerving, but it has its funny moments, especially the little girl who makes fun of him, & the gremlin himself is funny especially the window sequence, the main reason I want this one, it is a classic, & Dan Aykroyd chews up the scenery in the first & last moments of the whole film, definately a must have, any time now would be nice!!!!!",4,Where's the DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2508,"['What', 'up', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'one', 'still', 'not', 'out', 'reviewer', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'are', 'legal', 'issues', 'unresolved', 'one', 'John', 'Landis', 'were', 'sued', 'actor', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'death', 'stunt', 'gone', 'wrong', 'first', 'segment', 'E', 'True', 'Hollywood', 'Story', 'did', 'piece', 'was', '1986', 'three', 'years', 'film', 'release', 'E', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'back', '1999', 'so', 'again', 'what', 'delay', 'one', 'had', 'four', 'segments', 'four', 'different', 'directors', 'John', 'Landis', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'doing', 'first', 'one', 'racist', 'corporate', 'guy', 'Morrow', 'who', 'victim', 'history', 'treatment', 'mainly', 'Jews', 'African', 'American', 'Chinese', 'people', 'forced', 'live', 'shoes', 'experience', 'own', 'hatred', 'segment', 'course', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'death', 'stunt', 'gone', 'wrong', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'renouncing', 'hatred', 'helping', 'ultimately', 'redeming', 'was', 'never', 'realized', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'not', 'seen', 'maybe', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'legal', 'issues', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'who', 'however', 'segment', 'good', 'second', 'directed', 'Speilberg', 'o.k', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'elderly', 'people', 'getting', 'chance', 'be', 'kids', 'again', 'then', 'realizing', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'young', 'again', 'third', 'more', 'less', 'homage', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Gremlins', 'young', 'boy', 'woman', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'house', 'controlled', 'very', 'thoughts', 'kid', 'mean', 'streak', 'apparently', 'unseen', 'entity', 'constantly', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'background', 'way', 'terrorize', 'others', 'brought', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'there', 'Dante', 'milks', 'worth', 'fun', 'fourth', 'one', 'directed', 'George', 'Miller', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'far', 'best', 'one', 'four', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'fearful', 'airline', 'flight', 'passenger', 'who', 'gremlin', 'wing', 'plane', 'severe', 'thunderstorm', 'everyone', 'disillusional', 'Lithgow', 'character', 'hilt', 'once', 'said', 'was', 'favorite', 'role', 'storm', 'more', 'unnerving', 'funny', 'moments', 'especially', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'fun', 'gremlin', 'funny', 'especially', 'window', 'sequence', 'main', 'reason', 'want', 'one', 'classic', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'up', 'scenery', 'first', 'last', 'moments', 'whole', 'film', 'definately', 'must', 'have', 'time', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'nice']",Twilight Zone VHS

460545,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,630533580X,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 2]","In the tradition of one of the finest programs in television history, ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" takes us to another dimension; a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. Four great directors bring us four twisted tales of fantasy gone mad, with an amusing wraparound to bring it all full circle. Three of these tales we've heard before, but not quite like this, and the first is an all new experience of the unexplainable.The first story in this anthology is brought to us by legendary director John Landis. Called ""Time Out"", it's the tale of a bitter, hateful man whose angry racism is reflected back on him through a most unusual series of experiences. This entirely original story does not play out as cleverly as it could, but even the hacked up ending, the sad result of a tragic on-set accident that took the lives of the star and two child actors, isn't as bad as people say.The second story, ""Kick the Can"", comes to us from probably the most respected fantasy director of our day, Steven Spielberg. Ironically, I find it to be the least interesting in the film. It's the story of a magical visitor who travels to retirement homes to remind the residents of the joy they have lost with age, and how getting that feeling back is largely a matter of attitude and your state of mind. Scatman Crothers stars and is always a pleasure to watch, but in general, this piece just isn't as fascinating as what is to come.Here's where things get really interesting, as ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" and Joe Dante bring us a remake of one of the best classic Twilight Zone episodes ever, ""It's a Good Life"". It's a story about a little boy with godlike powers, and of course, how such power in the self-indulgent hands of a child can be so very... ill used. This is one freaky segment, but very enjoyable and really quite different from the original. It's probably the main reason I wanted to own this film.Finally, we have ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", from George Miller, which revisits another of the best Twilight Zone episodes ever, this time with the great John Lithgow in the role William Shatner once played of a man on an airplane who is disturbed to spy ""something on the wing""!""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" is wonderfully hosted throughout by classic TZ veteran Burgess Meredith, in voiceover form, and Dan Aykroyd is a delightfully familiar face in the films opening and closing segments, though here he carries quite a dark little secret. Though the first half is ugly at times and uninspired at others, not to mention plagued by memories of the helicopter accident that troubled every aspect of the film, the second half is a great ride and well worth it. And I, personally, love the wraparound bits too. If you're a fan of this 1983 film or the original show, you should definitely pick up this often very affordable Blu-Ray. Though it only features the theatrical trailer as a bonus, which is a real shame for a film with such a legacy behind it and so much history of its own, the movie alone is such a worthwhile trip!",4,"The first half is just okay, but love the second half!",1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,3048,"['tradition', 'one', 'finest', 'programs', 'television', 'history', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Movie', 'dimension', 'dimension', 'sound', 'dimension', 'sight', 'dimension', 'mind', 'Four', 'great', 'directors', 'bring', 'four', 'twisted', 'tales', 'fantasy', 'gone', 'mad', 'amusing', 'wraparound', 'bring', 'full', 'circle', 'Three', 'tales', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'not', 'quite', 'first', 'new', 'experience', 'unexplainable.The', 'first', 'story', 'anthology', 'brought', 'legendary', 'director', 'John', 'Landis', 'Called', 'Time', 'Out', 'tale', 'bitter', 'hateful', 'man', 'angry', 'racism', 'reflected', 'back', 'most', 'unusual', 'series', 'experiences', 'entirely', 'original', 'story', 'not', 'play', 'out', 'as', 'cleverly', 'could', 'even', 'hacked', 'up', 'ending', 'sad', 'result', 'tragic', 'on-set', 'accident', 'took', 'lives', 'star', 'two', 'child', 'actors', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'say.The', 'second', 'story', 'Kick', 'Can', 'probably', 'most', 'respected', 'fantasy', 'director', 'day', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Ironically', 'find', 'be', 'least', 'interesting', 'film', 'story', 'magical', 'visitor', 'who', 'retirement', 'homes', 'remind', 'residents', 'joy', 'have', 'lost', 'age', 'how', 'getting', 'feeling', 'back', 'largely', 'matter', 'attitude', 'state', 'mind', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'stars', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'general', 'piece', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'fascinating', 'what', 'come.Here', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'interesting', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Movie', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'bring', 'remake', 'one', 'best', 'classic', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'ever', 'Good', 'Life', 'story', 'little', 'boy', 'godlike', 'powers', 'course', 'how', 'such', 'power', 'self-indulgent', 'hands', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'very', 'ill', 'used', 'one', 'freaky', 'segment', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'quite', 'different', 'original', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'wanted', 'own', 'film.Finally', 'have', 'Nightmare', '20,000', 'Feet', 'George', 'Miller', 'best', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'ever', 'time', 'great', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'role', 'William', 'Shatner', 'once', 'played', 'man', 'airplane', 'who', 'disturbed', 'spy', 'something', 'wing', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Movie', 'wonderfully', 'hosted', 'classic', 'TZ', 'veteran', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'voiceover', 'form', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'delightfully', 'familiar', 'face', 'films', 'opening', 'closing', 'segments', 'though', 'here', 'quite', 'dark', 'little', 'secret', 'first', 'half', 'ugly', 'times', 'uninspired', 'others', 'not', 'mention', 'plagued', 'memories', 'helicopter', 'accident', 'troubled', 'aspect', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'great', 'ride', 'well', 'personally', 'love', 'wraparound', 'too', ""'re"", 'fan', '1983', 'film', 'original', 'show', 'should', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'often', 'very', 'affordable', 'Blu-Ray', 'only', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'bonus', 'real', 'shame', 'film', 'legacy', 'so', 'much', 'history', 'own', 'movie', 'alone', 'such', 'worthwhile', 'trip']",Twilight Zone VHS

Durham ""Big Evil""","[8, 11]","The Twilight Zone movie has always felt somewhat disappointing to me, and upon seeing it again on DVD now, it still feels the same way.  Featuring four segments (one original, the other three based on classic episodes of the series) directed by John Landis (An American Werewolf in London), Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante (The Howling, Gremlins), and George Miller (the Mad Max trilogy, the upcoming Justice League of America movie), the Twilight Zone movie starts out so well but ends up being ultimately disappointing for a number of reasons.  The Landis directed first segment features Vic Morrow as a bigot who gets a taste of his own medicine as he finds himself transported through time.  This segment is great, but feels unfinished largely due to the fact that Morrow was tragically killed in a helicopter accident.  Spielberg's segment stars the late, great Scatman Crothers as the mysterious Mr. Bloom, who gives the members of a retirement hi=ome a chance to feel young again.  There's nothing really to this segment, and Spielberg's direction just seems tired as well.  Joe Dante's tale is a mixed bag and is dependent on the viewer whether or not you'll like it or not, but the final tale is worth the price of admission alone.  George Miller's re-envisioning of the classic William Shatner-starring tale from the series features John Lithgow as a frightened airplane passenger who desperately tries to warn everyone of the creature on the wing.  This segment is spectacular, and Lithgow in particular gives one of the absolute best performances he's ever graced the screen with.  The prologue for the film is great too, and features Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks and is directed by Landis as well.  What's the most disappointing aspect of this DVD release is undoubtedly the fact that there are no extras whatsoever besides the film's theatrical trailer.  Just like they did with the 25th Anniversary Edition of Poltergeist, Warner Brothers has skimped out on the extras here.  Other than that though, the Twilight Zone movie isn't bad one bit, just don't expect anything great out of it.  It's still worth picking up though, and Miller's segment alone sets this apart from other horror anthology flicks.",3,Somewhat disappointing,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2214,"['Twilight', 'Zone', 'movie', 'always', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'seeing', 'again', 'DVD', 'now', 'still', 'same', 'way', 'Featuring', 'four', 'segments', 'one', 'original', 'other', 'three', 'based', 'classic', 'episodes', 'series', 'directed', 'John', 'Landis', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'Howling', 'Gremlins', 'George', 'Miller', 'Mad', 'Max', 'trilogy', 'upcoming', 'Justice', 'League', 'America', 'movie', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'movie', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'up', 'being', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'number', 'reasons', 'Landis', 'directed', 'first', 'segment', 'features', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'bigot', 'who', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'transported', 'time', 'segment', 'great', 'feels', 'unfinished', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'Morrow', 'was', 'tragically', 'killed', 'helicopter', 'accident', 'Spielberg', 'segment', 'late', 'great', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Bloom', 'who', 'members', 'retirement', 'hi=ome', 'chance', 'feel', 'young', 'again', 'nothing', 'really', 'segment', 'Spielberg', 'direction', 'just', 'tired', 'as', 'well', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'tale', 'mixed', 'bag', 'dependent', 'viewer', 'not', ""'ll"", 'like', 'not', 'final', 'tale', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'George', 'Miller', 're-envisioning', 'classic', 'William', 'Shatner-starring', 'tale', 'series', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'frightened', 'airplane', 'passenger', 'who', 'desperately', 'warn', 'everyone', 'creature', 'wing', 'segment', 'spectacular', 'Lithgow', 'particular', 'one', 'absolute', 'best', 'ever', 'graced', 'screen', 'prologue', 'film', 'great', 'too', 'features', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'directed', 'Landis', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'most', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'release', 'undoubtedly', 'fact', 'are', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Just', 'did', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Poltergeist', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'skimped', 'out', 'extras', 'here', 'Other', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'bit', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'great', 'still', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'Miller', 'segment', 'alone', 'apart', 'other', 'horror', 'anthology', 'flicks']",Twilight Zone VHS
460548,A3EJSTSZ5U95YB,630533580X,"Oh Really Oh ""HD Guru""","[4, 5]","Finally, I have a copy!!! It seems this film was very hard to find anywhere. I happen to work at Magnolia Home Theater and we received (2) copies, so I snagged one before it hit the shelves. On to the movie. This is one of those movies you just want to have. It was my and many's favorite t.v. show and the movie is worthy of it's name.DVD specs: VC1 codec, Dolby TruHD, DDPlus. Extras: Movie Trailer (poor picture quality)Since the movie is literally 4 movies by four directors, you cannot review it as a whole as each have distinct differences due to the directors style.The 1st Segment: Looks very good. The polyester suits and fat ties at the bar date the film. Good detail on the whole. Nazi suits are sharp, good color saturation throughout. Only glaring exception is in dark scenes some noise and not the darkest of black. The sound is very good, great front stage and the rears are used but won't distract what's happening up front. Good midbase and highs are really defined. I can't remember, even in the movies it having the detail in sound it has now, almost no LFE (sub-bass) but that's the way it was initially recorded. The TruHD is slightly better than the DD plus.7 out of 10 in picture - 8 out of 10 in sound.2nd Segment: Looks rather soft, but you have to realize again: Different director, different style. This one was directed by Steven Spielberg (good to see his stuff on HDDVD). You will notice the familiar softness that he adds to movies. The classic Speilberg soft filter (Goonies, ET, Close Encounters etc). Close ups of the older people look very sharp, long shots look a little better than a regular DVD, but in regular shots very detailed. The sound again is very, very clean. The score, which I remember as being very emotional and critical to the feel of the segment, was there and more. I still choked up at the end. Its good to see Scattman Crothers again (main charactor). He's a cinematic gem, delivering his usual steller performance. Remeber him in The Shining?8 out of 10 picture - 8 out of 10 sound. Gave an eight because it's what Speilberg intended it to look like.3rd Segment: Wow. This is easily the most impressive both sound and video. Colors are amazing! A few very small traces of grain, otherwise very impressive. When in Anthony's home, right away you notice the very colorful over the top couch, then the wall colors are made to stand out. I remember Quinlan being beautiful when I watched this as a kid, wow my memories serves me right. Detail is almost reference. The sound is equally impressive. Great dynamics, detail and out of the segments, the best bass responce. When the rabbit comes out of the hat.....look out it snapped me back.9 out of 10 picture - 9 out of ten sound.4th Segment: It went from wow to woe. This is easily the most dissapointing segment of the movie. It starts out very grainy, noisey, and dare I say VCRish. It then cleans up and looks good for a scene or two then for some reason, it goes back to VCRish picture. Very inconsistant and distracting. What was my second favorite segment, has been shown no love. It must have come from a poor master, or just hurried at the end, I don't know, but even the climactic end, was blurry and undefined. Sound was o.k. and that's a compliment. Lithgow is Lithgow so no matter how bad the print, he's an brilliant actor.4 out of 10 picture - 4.5 out of ten sound.The closing was worth the price of this disk. Rod Serling's voice and famous Twilight Zone score in TruHD.....PRICELESS.In parting. This is one of those movies that you just remember every line, every scene, every facial expression. Having scene it in this form, I can say it still is by far the best this movie has been presented. The last segment being considered, I still recomend this film, not for a reference demo, but for what it is, a modern classic.

The notorious on set death of the great Vic Morrow cast a shadow over this films production and eventually its release.  The accident that caused his death and that of 2 extras is soul crushingly tragic to see and one can't help but wonder how it could have been avoided.  All that aside the film was decent in the theater at the time and is still just okay on its Blu-ray incarnation.  John Landis's episode is marred by its tragic history but Vic Morrow is good as the intolerant protagonist. Steven Spielberg's episode is a little too sweet and is really just an episode of AMAZING STORIES before its time, but hey Scatman Crothers.Joe Dante's remake is visually pleasing to look at and is the reason to pick this up, as it has some nice campy acting and is the least like its television counterpart.George Miller's final episode offering is fairly standard with a good John Lithgow performance and a cool looking if not menacing beastie.  I like it for the nostalgia value but the best things about TZ THE MOVIE are Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd's intro piece and Burgess Meredith's spin on the narrator intro.

This 1983 now overlooked movie is a respectable good film but that has its moments you basically have 4 different stories and here is how they go First the film opens a little eary with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks singing and bored out of there minds singing""Let the midnight special"" there tape breaks in the car and there stuck talking to each other bored the two dare each other play t.v theme songs and all kinds of stuff then he Dan Aykroyd becomes a monster out of nowhere and chokes his friend. That was just the opening then the first segment begins it is really tragic Vic Morrow and two kids were killed by a helicopter and the original script if he would have lived he was supposed to come back to the bar he was bashing every minority prior to leaving and come back after his violent ordeal with the German's looking at him as a Jew and the K.K.K looking at him as a black man and the American G.I's looking at him as Vietmanese after that was done he was supposed to come back thanking everyone in the bar and saying he was sorry and that would have been the story and instead they released it and it has a tragic ending with him going to a concentration camp. That scene looks like a deleted extra scene they used and that segment just ends horribly and they should have never released it and started fresh with a new kind of plot. The 2nd segment originally was supposed to be a remake of the monsters on Maple Street but because Vic Morrow was killed in the 1st segment the writers and Steven Spielberg decided to do this fairy tale type episode called Kick the Can it is a little touching probably especially for old people some viewers knock this segment saying that it is lame and boring. This is a good segment and ends happy and really had a nice point. The 3rd segment actually turned out the way it supposed to have it is basically a remake of the Anthony story from the original series. This remake with Anthony this segment probably has more suspense then the one from the early 60's. It is funny in it's own little way but eary to and that ends nice but still probably could have been better. The last segment is the stongest John Lithgow is amazing in this role as you typical terrorized airplane passenger not only does he hate flying but he sees the ugliest monster I have ever seen in my life out his airplane window and he freaks everybody out the attractive flight attendant's try calming him but nothing works he even gets wrestled to the floor by other passengers this segment is my favorite and people who know this movie will probably tell you this segment probably saved the whole movie it has the suspense and fear you felt in the original twilight zone's.

This prologue stars the always wonderful Dan Ackroyd and Albert Brooks and is accompanied by a soundtrack of ""Midnight Special"" as covered by CCR. Suffice it to say it concludes with the Twilight Zone's trademark twist ending. This clever beginning is followed by four segments with different casts and directors. They're all narrated by Burgess Meredith, who starred in some of the original television episodes.The first segment is the only one that was originally written for the movie rather than being a reworking of one of the episodes from the 1960's series. Vic Morrow, who famously died in an on the set accident while filming this portion stars as a bigoted man who learns what life would be like if he was viewed differently by others. But does he learn his lesson too late? Probably because the real life tragedy that accompanied this part of the film necessitated it, this segment seems both too short and somewhat cobbled together.KICK THE CAN has a wonderful performance from Scatman Crothers, but other than that it didn't do much for me. It feels too sentimental. You can tell it was made by Spielberg in one of his more sappy, family friendly phases.ITS A GOOD LIFE is a surreal and darkly comic take on the original. In the beginning, those not familiar with the source material will believe Anthony is innocent, but is he...? This segment is marred by a happy ending which is quite different than the disturbing one in Rod Serling's TV series.The final segment, NIGHTMARE AT 20,00 FEET is decent. You do see too much of the monster but what you see is frightening. John Lithgow is convincing as the paranoid main character.So like many anthology movies this is a mixed bag.

But Landis' contribution to the tales, an original story not from the Zone canon, isn't up to Rod Serling standards.  The comeuppance of bigot Vic Morrow get repititious and--honestly--problematic when you consider that the US soldier is lumped with the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.Spielberg's choice is the lamest: cute elderly people get to become cute little kids for a night.  Any otherworldly wonder is lost under a heavy flow of Speilberg syrup.Joe Dante has fun with his tale but his sappy ending--far different than the original TV version!--could've been directed by Spielberg.This is THE TWILIGHT ZONE, people, not THE GOONIES.Only the last time, my personal favorite of all Twilight Zone episodes (the original starred William Shatner, hilariously lampooned in the second ACE VENTURE movie), reaches the Zone.  John Lithgow is brilliant as a spazzing passenger in Richard Matheson's ""Nightmare at Thirty Thousand Feet.""  George Miller (THE ROAD WARRIOR) does an awesome job of putting you in the plane by filming the sequence with a handheld camera.Lithgow's performance was so good that he SHOULD have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.  Well, he was.  But since THE TWILIGHT ZONE was tainted by the tragedy of Vic Morrow's death, Lithgow was nominated for his six minutes of standing around in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT (you forgot he was even in that, right?).  Such is Hollywood.Think of all the Zone scripts that screamed for a big screen, big budget treatment.  ""To Serve Man""?

460574,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,630533580X,The Piper at the Gates,"[1, 1]","First of all, I'm a causal fan of The Twilight Zone only, but there are certain episodes that I love of that show. However, I had never really seen this whole movie before, only parts of certain segments. A friend of mine told me that it was pretty good, and I found it cheap, so I decided to buy it. To me, the overall film was pretty good, but not great. The film is divided up into 4 different stories, 3 of which are remakes of classic Twilight zone episodes, and 1 original story. Different directors did each segment, the directors being John Landis, Steven Spielberg (who also produced it), Joe Dante, and George Miller. With directors like these, one would expect something extraordinary, however, I really didn't feel like there was anything that special about any of the segments. Some were better than others, but still, nothing amazing. The first segment, done by Landis, happened to be favorite out of the 4, this one was also the original episode of the film. its about an outspoken bigot that finds himself traveling through time, occupying the bodies of victims of injustice: a Jewish victim of the Holocaust, a black man about to be lynched by the Ku Klux Klan, and a Vietnamese man about to be killed by U.S. soldiers. I really enjoyed this segment, and felt that it had a good meaning to it as well. The second segment, done by Spielberg, was the worst segment of the bunch in my opinion. I can't remember seeing the original episode of this one, but I really hope it wasn't as boring or as uninteresting as this was. The story is about an elderly black man that shows up at a rest home, and gives the gift of youth back to the old folks there. Highly sentimental and a overall nice story, I suppose, but very boring to watch! The third segment is the remake of the classic episode ""Its a Good Life"", which is one of my favorites of the old show. This remake, though done decently well, is not better than the original by any means, one glaring reason being that the original ending is changed to a happy one! For the most part, I hate happy endings in movies, especially when its NOT SUPPOSED to be a happy ending!!! (By the way, look for actress Nancy Cartwright in this one, better known for the voice of none other than Bart Simspon!!) The last segment is the remake of the great ""Terror at 20,000 feet"", originally starring William Shatner. This time, the staring role is John Lithgow. Now, I'm gonna a bit biased here. I'm a big fan of William Shatner, and in my opinion, no one is gonna do that role better than him in the original. However, I do think Lithgow had a good performance. The only thing that I didn't like was that I thought the character was way too over the top in the beginning, compared to the original. From the very first moments of the segment, Lithgow's character was totally freaked out and acted almost insane about flying! Where has in the original episode, Shatner's character simply was overly nervous, then got worse and worse as the story progressed.  However, probably the biggest dissapointment I had, didn't have anything to do with the movie at all. There are absolutely no special features on this DVD (I think the trailer is on there, but thats it!). With all the talent that was involved in this movie, as well as the tragic helicopter crash that happened on the set of the movie, you would expect a documentary, featurette, director's commentary, something...but no, nothing here. In closing, the movie has its moments, but there's nothing extremely good about it. And with the names involved, it definitely wasn't as good as one might think. Still, its worth owning, but with no special features to mention, only make it worth owning for a low price.",3,"Overall, A Decent Film, but  I was Expecting Better...",1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,3713,"['First', ""'m"", 'causal', 'fan', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'only', 'are', 'certain', 'love', 'show', 'However', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'whole', 'movie', 'only', 'parts', 'certain', 'segments', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'found', 'cheap', 'decided', 'buy', 'overall', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'divided', 'up', '4', 'different', 'stories', '3', 'are', 'remakes', 'classic', 'Twilight', 'zone', 'episodes', '1', 'original', 'story', 'Different', 'directors', 'did', 'segment', 'directors', 'being', 'John', 'Landis', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'George', 'Miller', 'directors', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'however', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'anything', 'special', 'segments', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'still', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'first', 'segment', 'done', 'Landis', 'happened', 'be', 'favorite', '4', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'original', 'episode', 'film', 'outspoken', 'bigot', 'traveling', 'time', 'occupying', 'bodies', 'victims', 'injustice', 'Jewish', 'victim', 'Holocaust', 'black', 'man', 'be', 'lynched', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'Vietnamese', 'man', 'be', 'killed', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'segment', 'felt', 'had', 'good', 'meaning', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'segment', 'done', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'worst', 'segment', 'bunch', 'opinion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'original', 'episode', 'one', 'really', 'hope', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'as', 'uninteresting', 'was', 'story', 'elderly', 'black', 'man', 'up', 'rest', 'home', 'gift', 'youth', 'back', 'old', 'folks', 'there', 'Highly', 'sentimental', 'overall', 'nice', 'story', 'suppose', 'very', 'boring', 'watch', 'third', 'segment', 'remake', 'classic', 'episode', 'Good', 'Life', 'one', 'favorites', 'old', 'show', 'remake', 'done', 'decently', 'well', 'not', 'better', 'original', 'means', 'one', 'glaring', 'reason', 'being', 'original', 'ending', 'changed', 'happy', 'one', 'most', 'part', 'hate', 'happy', 'endings', 'movies', 'especially', 'when', 'NOT', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'way', 'look', 'actress', 'Nancy', 'Cartwright', 'one', 'better', 'known', 'voice', 'none', 'other', 'Bart', 'Simspon', 'last', 'segment', 'remake', 'great', 'Terror', '20,000', 'feet', 'originally', 'starring', 'William', 'Shatner', 'time', 'staring', 'role', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Now', ""'m"", 'gon', 'bit', 'biased', 'here', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'William', 'Shatner', 'opinion', 'one', 'gon', 'do', 'role', 'better', 'original', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'Lithgow', 'had', 'good', 'performance', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'beginning', 'compared', 'original', 'very', 'first', 'moments', 'segment', 'Lithgow', 'character', 'was', 'totally', 'freaked', 'out', 'acted', 'almost', 'insane', 'flying', 'Where', 'original', 'episode', 'Shatner', 'character', 'simply', 'was', 'overly', 'nervous', 'then', 'got', 'worse', 'worse', 'story', 'progressed', 'However', 'probably', 'biggest', 'dissapointment', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'movie', 'are', 'absolutely', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'think', 'trailer', 'talent', 'was', 'involved', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'tragic', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'happened', 'set', 'movie', 'would', 'expect', 'documentary', 'featurette', 'director', 'commentary', 'something', 'nothing', 'here', 'closing', 'movie', 'moments', 'nothing', 'extremely', 'good', 'names', 'involved', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'Still', 'worth', 'owning', 'special', 'features', 'mention', 'only', 'make', 'worth', 'owning', 'low', 'price']",Twilight Zone VHS
460575,A356ZKEUZ1FIFJ,630533580X,Tom C.,"[7, 7]","about Kick the Can being too Saccharine sweet and the special effects being outdated. First off, why can't a movie be too sweet? A movie can be too violent, but I don't hear that being complained about too much. The minute a movie shows some type of emotion, Bammm! Everybody jumps on it. I could never figure that out. As for the technology, It's a Good Life was supposed to look cartoonish, so the creatures are cartoon like in appearance. The gremlin on the plane looked very cool and believable. For the people who say this technology isn't believable. Are CGI graphics in movies today believable? To me they aren't. They look like a video game or a cartoon to me when they are supposed to look like real creatures. It's terrible and ruins every movie for me, because while I watch the movie I'm thinking the effects look too fake, I'm not believing this. So I can't see why people are so down with the effects in the TZ movie. I think they were perfectly done and original. So for the people who are down with the effects in TZ, just kick back and relax and enjoy the flick. For those people it may look fake, but that was a time gone by. Unfortunatley for me todays CGI effects will always ruin a movie, because I can always spot it in a movie and know it's a video game not a movie.",5,"Come on guys, relax with the comments.......",1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,1289,"['Kick', 'Can', 'being', 'too', 'Saccharine', 'sweet', 'special', 'effects', 'being', 'outdated', 'First', 'off', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movie', 'be', 'too', 'sweet', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'violent', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'being', 'complained', 'too', 'much', 'minute', 'movie', 'type', 'emotion', 'Bammm', 'Everybody', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'technology', 'Good', 'Life', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'cartoonish', 'creatures', 'are', 'cartoon', 'appearance', 'gremlin', 'plane', 'looked', 'very', 'cool', 'believable', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'technology', ""n't"", 'believable', 'Are', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'movies', 'today', 'believable', 'are', ""n't"", 'look', 'video', 'game', 'cartoon', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'real', 'creatures', 'terrible', 'movie', 'watch', 'movie', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'effects', 'look', 'too', 'fake', ""'m"", 'not', 'believing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'down', 'effects', 'TZ', 'movie', 'think', 'were', 'perfectly', 'done', 'original', 'So', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'down', 'effects', 'TZ', 'just', 'kick', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'flick', 'people', 'may', 'look', 'fake', 'was', 'time', 'gone', 'Unfortunatley', 'CGI', 'effects', 'will', 'always', 'ruin', 'movie', 'can', 'always', 'spot', 'movie', 'know', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'movie']",Twilight Zone VHS
460576,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,630533580X,Tristan,"[2, 3]","Before I talk about this film, I wanted to mention something on a much darker note, and I'm sure everyone knows what I'm going to talk about. Vic Morrow was killed on the set for this film, along with two children, in a helicopter stunt gone horribly wrong. I love John Landis and I think it's a really good filmmaker, but his feet really need to be held to the fire on this one. I'm sure that Morrow's death saddened him greatly and I'm sure that it has haunted him since, I know that it killed his friendship with Spielberg, and I know that sometimes horrible things happen that you can't change and you can't help but live with regret over it and I understand that. I can't say that I know what that's like because I'm never been responsible for another person's death, so I apologize if what I'm about to say offends anyone. I believe that the way a director behaves on a set definitely has a huge outcome on what the final product is going to be. I don't believe in professionalism, but I do believe that if an artist wants his art to reflect his vision he needs to make absolutely sure that the people he is directing know that and then behave accordingly. If a director needs to become strict and push his actors into doing what needs to be done, that's fine. That's the movie set, and if actors and actresses don't want to do it then they shouldn't have signed up for the project in the first place. However, there must always be an element of safety to a movie set, no matter how intense the project may be. Sometimes directors endanger their actors and then things go well and it all ends up coming out effectively with little trauma. Sometimes actors do get hurt, and that adds to the final product, despite the time it may take after the fact to fix the relationship between actor and director. This, however, was one of those times in which a director took a terrible and large risk, it went completely wrong, it cost the lives of three innocent people who did nothing to deserve dying in such a terrible way, and it ended up becoming a sad cautionary tale in Hollywood. I'm not going to pretend to know all of the circumstances of the incident in question like everyone else does, but I do think that Landis must have had a serious lapse in judgement to decide to put Morrow's life in that kind of risk, and I can't say that I have a lot of sympathy for him. I have a lot of sympathy for Vic Morrow's daughter Jennifer Jason Leigh and I have a lot of sympathy for the parents of the children who died in the accident, but my sympathy for Landis certainly isn't high. This doesn't change my opinion of his as a person or even an artist. I think he's a good person and I even wouldn't mind meeting him one day, but there is little to no doubt in my mind about the terrible tragedy. I'm sure that the pyrotechnic operators, fire technicians, and stunt coordinators all made mistakes that caused the incident to go down so chaotically, but in my opinion John Landis was at fault for violating child labor laws and allowing such dangerous stunts and effects to happen in such close proximity in the first place. I hope that Vic Morrow, Myca Dinh Le, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen may forever rest in peace and I hope that John Landis and the rest of the cast and crew have been able to successfully move on as best as they could from this terrible tragedy. And now, onto the film.Twilight Zone: The Movie is an anthology picture based on the famous horror/sci-fi television show we all know and love. The four shorts presented here are a mixed bag of material. Some of it works beautifully and is quite scary, and some of it fails pretty horrendously. In order to properly talk about this film, it's important to note that rating this film as a whole is trickier than usual because of the varying quality of some of the segments. I can't entirely recommend the film just because some of the material is pretty bad, but the stuff that does work works amazingly. I have the same problem with the film Four Rooms, starring my favorite actor Tim Roth. I recommend the film and I think people should see it, but be prepared to wade through some pretty crappy material before getting to the good stuff. The weakest parts of the film are the first two parts, and so I shall explore them accordingly and treat them as their own separate films.After an effective opening intro involving comedy geniuses Dan Akroyd and Albert Brooks, in a breathtaking sequence that starts off very funny and then slowly turns horrifying, ala' Scream, The first story, Time Out, tells the pathetic tale of Bill Conner (Vic Morrow) a bitter racist bigot who gets drunk and upsets a group of black gentlemen at a nearby table and then leaves the pub. After he leaves, he goes on a horror odyssey in which he ends up assuming the roles of various people he is racist against before finally meeting his ultimate fate. The idea is clever, in my opinion, and has plenty of potential, but I found the end result to be far too heavy-handed and ultimately it is ineffective and kinda weak. Morrow turns in an effective final performance, but it's not enough to really give the story any real weight. The worst part about it is how predictable it is and how there is little to it, ultimately. The story ends in a predictable manner, the irony is too abundant for anyone to really follow or even believe, and above all we are left with little to no reason to even care whether or not he learns anything or gets his comeuppance. It could have been helped if the story had more interesting visuals, more surprises, more shocks, and less heavy-handedness. We are left with a message out of an after school special about the dangers of racism and prejudice, and we've seen it a million times before. I don't think that Landis could have directed the material any better, however. I think he probably should have just re-wrote the script and tried to find another approach. After such an effective opening scene, this segment just feels even more weak. I'd give it a 4 out of 10.After that, however, we get a segment that makes Time Out look like a classic. Kick the Can, directed by Steven Spielberg, represents Spielberg at his absolute worst. I love Spielberg and I think he's a wonderful filmmaker and producer, but when people talk about him being sappy, cheap, manipulative, and corny, they're talking about this segment. It is the worst thing that he's ever made. Scatman Crothers is the lead in it, and I hope to god he got paid good money to show his face in this because this is just trite, inconsistent material that I can't even bring myself to write about. It's a huge step down from the original episode, I'll say that much. It lacks the energy and the understated beauty of it. A bunch of bitter elderly people are deteriorating at an old folk's home and some magic man shows up and makes the young again. Then they decide being young sucks so they get old again except one resident who stays being a child and escapes out a window while this mean old man wants to go with him. Then he plays kick the can. The end. The segment is so badly made that I used to fall asleep watching it when I was little out of boredom. I had never seen the second half of the film throughout much of my childhood because of this damn segment. It wasn't until I was about nine that I finally sat through the entire picture. I was unaware of all the crazy monsters ans stuff that appear at the end, and it's because of this damn story. I don't know what it is about this story, but it just doesn't resonate with me in any way. It's competently shot and Scatman Crothers does good work, as usual. I'm a child at heart too. I often purposefully seek out films about childhood because I feel like I can relate to them more personally than most other stories. I'm writing a coming-of-age novel as I type this. This story offered me nothing, and I got less than nothing out of it. I give it a 2 out of 10 because it is this story that makes me not want to really recommend the overall film. So yeah, 2 out of 10.So then we take an enormous step up in quality from the disastrous second story to a third story that is quite spellbinding and surprising. Approaching, though not succeeding, Tobe Hooper in it's quality, Joe Dante's adaptation of It's a Good Life is quite enjoyable, though flawed. Dante opts to abandon suspense in favor of elaborate special effects. The approach actually work pretty well for the most part up until the very end when it looses steam and starts to grow tiresome. This kid with supernatural powers torments the adults around him in a strange halfway house, and an innocent woman is mixed up in the madness after accidentally hitting him with her car in a scene that is more hilarious than probably intended. What can I say? The effects are great, the characters are fun to watch and suitably off-kilter, and the visual style of the story itself is full of spectacle and flash. The story falls apart at the end and ultimately makes all the hijinks seem kind of pointless, but there are some disturbing and twisted ideas put forth here that will more than satisfy fans of the macabre and the morbid. The boy is believably creepy, but retains a sort of innocence throughout that actually makes the effects more chilling. The chaos comes from the mind of a child, and in some ways these ideas are more horrifying in their simplicity than the idea of a masked killer going around chopping people up. There's even a brief appearance from one of the most sadistic cartoons I've ever seen involving a little dog being tortured into joining some sort of shady group. It's not as good as the original episode. It doesn't even tap it. The original is one of the best episodes of Twilight Zone, and  in comparison to that this tale is weak. However, when taken on it's own terms it's actually pretty insane and effective in it's own weird way. I give this story a 6 out of 10 due to it's effectiveness, noting that it's not as suspenseful as the original and that it does eventually grow tiresome.Then we come to the best part of the film, finally. Terror at 20,000 Feet, directed by George Miller, who directed two of the greatest films ever made (The Road Warrior and Lorenzo's Oil) and starring the scariest actor alive, John Lithgow. This story is scary as hell. It's atmospheric, it's dark, it's stomach-churning in it's intensity, and, above all, it tops the original. The story tells of a man who is deathly afraid of airplane flights who is already in panic mode as the tale begins. He sees a monster on the wing of the plane outside, causing damage to the exterior of the craft. Nobody will believe him, so he is forced to take matters into his own hands and confront his ultimate fear. The story is from his perspective, and the chaotic and dark atmosphere throughout the film already makes this segment something special in that we care and identify with this man. The original story starred William Shatner in one of his best performances. The images of the monster on the wing of the plane are engraved in pop culture as well as in the minds of many many children who grew up with the original show. It's one episode that will never be easy to top. Miller manages to do it gracefully, however, and watching it really did make me feel like I was Lithgow. These are the kinds of horror tales that take a lot of effort, style, and courage to really pull off, and Lithgow is never afraid of losing whatever dignity he even slightly had from the get go. He is one actor that I greatly admire, and this is one of his most enjoyable romps. The story is highly unpleasant and disturbing, but it also features the best effects work in the entire production. You won't be able to not feel sorry for this poor man, and by the time it ends you may likely be drenched in sweat. This story is effectively delivered and ends with a bang, allowing the film to be memorably creepy and haunting in the way the show was. Fans won't want to miss this one. I give this story an 8 out of 10, and combining all the ratings together results in the score located down below.",3,"A mixed bag, but when it works... it REALLY works!",1354924800,"12 8,

Having waited so long for the DVD, I finally got to watch it only to find a huge chunk missing from segment #1.  This segment is testament to Vic Morrow's final performance, one which he gave up his life for.  The least the DVD producer could have done is to show the movie in its entirety.  This would be the best tribute to a fine actor/director dedicated to his craft.  The stories for all segments does not intrigue but baffle the audience.  Production value also receives a minus.  Directors instead of actors take centre stage, the trailer and credits gave the directors more prominence than the actors or the storyline.  If not for Vic Morrow, I would not have bothered to watch this movie.  While the TV series had its own merits the movie certainly does not and to make money off a dead man is really offensive.",1,Twilight Zone: The Movie,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,880,"['Twilight', 'Zone', 'Movie', 'was', 'great', 'disappointment', 'Having', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'DVD', 'finally', 'got', 'watch', 'only', 'find', 'huge', 'chunk', 'missing', 'segment', '1', 'segment', 'testament', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'final', 'performance', 'one', 'gave', 'up', 'life', 'least', 'DVD', 'producer', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'show', 'movie', 'entirety', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'tribute', 'fine', 'actor/director', 'dedicated', 'craft', 'stories', 'segments', 'not', 'intrigue', 'baffle', 'audience', 'Production', 'value', 'also', 'minus', 'Directors', 'instead', 'actors', 'take', 'centre', 'stage', 'trailer', 'credits', 'gave', 'directors', 'more', 'prominence', 'actors', 'storyline', 'not', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'watch', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'own', 'merits', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'make', 'money', 'dead', 'man', 'really', 'offensive']",Twilight Zone VHS

Anyone would think that Warner Bros were hanging on to it for a special DVD release because it was so good. Ha! This movie adapation of the classic TV series is a lost opportunity which could have been a fantastic movie if only it had better direction. The public assumed that because Spielberg was on board that it would mean a good film. His contribution about the retirement village was extremely boring and spoilt the overall feel of the film. What also affected this film was the appalling story about the boy in the house who controls all his visitors. The other segments are much better I am happy to say with the standout being the introduction with Albert Brookes and Dan Akroyd - this is pretty scary indeed. The story with Vic Morrow is also engaging and thought provoking, while the final story about a man scared of flying is both funny and scary.Despite some good stories, the movie adaptation was a lost opportunity to truly present a collection worth seeing.  It received mix reviews in 1983. Now that it has been released on DVD, it would have been good to include some special features to make it more attractive.Rent first!",3,A lost opportunity,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1227,"['Hard', 'believe', 'movie', '25', 'years', 'old', 'only', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'Anyone', 'would', 'think', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'were', 'hanging', 'special', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Ha', 'movie', 'adapation', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'only', 'had', 'better', 'direction', 'public', 'assumed', 'Spielberg', 'was', 'board', 'would', 'mean', 'good', 'film', 'contribution', 'retirement', 'village', 'was', 'extremely', 'boring', 'spoilt', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'What', 'also', 'affected', 'film', 'was', 'appalling', 'story', 'boy', 'house', 'who', 'visitors', 'other', 'segments', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'standout', 'being', 'introduction', 'Albert', 'Brookes', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'pretty', 'scary', 'indeed', 'story', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'also', 'engaging', 'thought', 'provoking', 'final', 'story', 'man', 'scared', 'flying', 'funny', 'scary.Despite', 'good', 'stories', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'was', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'truly', 'present', 'collection', 'seeing', 'received', 'mix', 'reviews', '1983', 'Now', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'include', 'special', 'features', 'make', 'more', 'attractive.Rent', 'first']",Twilight Zone VHS
