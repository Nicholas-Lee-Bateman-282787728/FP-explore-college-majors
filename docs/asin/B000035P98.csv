516415,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,B000035P98,Brooser Bear,"[17, 29]","Teena Brandon was a small woman who came out of nowhere, walked tall for a couple of weeks and died a brutal death at the hands of her associates. She was one of those extraordinary people who grew up against all odds out of trailer parks and the small town oppression. Unfortunately we know as little about her outside her sexual identity as before, despite all the publicity that she received well meaning and otherwise. That's because everyone objectified her cross-dressing and focused on the last three weeks or so of her life in Falls City and ignoring everything else about her.This film is no exception, sticking strictly to the male persona that she was playing and ignoring her hortcomings. However, unlike the true crime book about her by Aphrodite Jones, and a Hollywood film about herthis film comes closest at giving us a glimpse of what she must have been like in real life through the many photographs taken throughout Teena Brandon's life.This film suffers from a number of shortcomings as a documentary. It gives too much air time (amazing that they gave any play at all) to the two people that raped and murdered her. Nothing new revealed by that except their lies and attempts at self justification. In the beginning the film-makers interview a number of girls, whom Teena pursued as Brandon, but fail to interview her firends whoi knew her in high school, any of her teachers, or anyone who knew her as a girl. They also hadn't intreviewed one guy whom she may have had a crush on in high school.Another problem, of the caliber that makes the difference between the great and the ordinary is that the film-makers fail to actively engage, question or put on the spot a number of those they interviewed, when they were evasive or less than forthcoming and more agggressive questioning was called for. This holds true especially, when they take a mother of a convicted murderer and have the gall to ask her if her son deserves a death penalty, while the lead rapist clearly controls the interview, apparently by his power of refusing to give an interview or to make it public.Despite these shortcomings, it's still a very moving documentary for all the life of Teena Brandon that it managed to capture. She was a budding actress from an early age and it was the role of her life that led to her death. She clearly loved to be photographed and the film makers picked out a great collection for a coherent narrative. Another strength is the length, which the interviews run, which capture enough information to give us sometimes shocking, sometimes revealing glimpse at what actually must have happened, even though the film makers failed to follow up on it.One of the things that happened in real life but which didn't made it into the based on a true story movie was the so-called depantsing incident: Jealous Boys come up on two girls at a party. They pull the pants off a girl mascuarading as a boy so that everyone can see that ""he"" is really a ""she"", in hopes that the other girl would now know the truth and go back to her boyfriend. there are other more sinister implicaitons in this as well, which are best left to Freudian psychoanalysts and to anthropologists studying mating rituals in tribal societies. What happens next is a lot more serious: Teena Brandon is understandably terrified and runs from the party to a public place in the company of her female friend. The two show up about thirty minutes later, and the female friend leaves Teena Brandon in their company, saying ""You will be all right"". In  the interview that gets into the documentary, the female friend gets a long winded explanation of where they went, and why it was okay for her to leave Teena in the company of two men who just forcibly pulled off her pants, and finally, literally with the last sentence, she attempts to extricate one of the two who happened to have been her boyfriend. Sometime after that they show newsfootage of that girl giving her version of what took place. Instead of going like Oh-my-God-they-pulled-the-pants -off-my-best-friend, the woman goes in a droning monotone ""The Depantsing Incident"" as if she was a Pentagon spokesman commenting on the latest snafu. The interviewers treat this girl as a former friend despite the fact that Teena Brandon was afraid to go near her after the rape, thinking that she had set her up.Another instance of mind-boggling behavior occurs when they iterview Linda, the mother of the last of Brandon's ""girlfriends"". There is a point that she says ""I told Brandon that no one deserves to get raped, well, I did not know she was raped, kidnapped whatever."" While saying that, she displays every textbook sign of lying. At first glance it seems innocuous: So, say that no one deserves to get raped. What's the big deal? Why lie about it? Because you knew you should say it, but you didn't? What sort of a person does it take to do that? And what sort of a mind is it that would lie about it and to what purpose? To curry favor with film makers? The film makers fail to mention was that this person had warned the perpetrators to wash their clothes because their victim went to the police and allegedly told them where Teena Brandon was hidingand had it not been for her, she might still be alive.Again, they could have put these two women on the spot and asked harder questions.The audiotape of Teena Brandon making a complaint is another piece of the film to watch carefully. Insensitive remarks of the shriff aside, this is the only voice sample and we should listento it carefully. There are two things: First, she is trying to distance herself from her own femininity,as second, she refers to her rapists by their first names. She is not trying to distance herself from them, she relates to them as her friends or peers. Secondly, unlike the stoic portrayal of her by Hillary Swank, with a lone tear running down her cheek, Teena Brandon is on the verge of tears while she gives the statement and she keeps speaking in short gasps, probably to keep from crying, and her narrative builds to a very credible punchline of how the whole experience revolted her. Hear the bwilderment in her voice, when she says on tape how she was forced to sit between her assailants in the front seat of the car, and one of them asks her if they are still friends. The whole universe of domestic vilence and of abuse of women opens up in just that one line said ina  tone of profound bewilderment.This also explains one of the major mysteries in this story: She got to safety of a hotel lobby. She called for someone to give her a ride. The two showed up to picke her up after they beat her up at a party and she went with them to get assaulted again. The msytery is why she ddin't make a scene in the safety of the hotel room lobby andwent with them willingly. Was she still thinking of them as firends? In this we may be getting a glimpse of the perpetrators as batterers of women and the unanswered question is why was Teena Brandon so quick to accept her role as a woman in an abusive relationship. Whatever the case may be, it seems that she went with them willingly because she thought of them as friends.The final point of interest is Michelle Lotter. In the early pictures she looks goofy. She wears baggy clothes to hide her figure. She bleaches her hair and starts wearing them something like Teena Brandon after she got murdered. There is some kind of a connection there. There is a sequence of photos that they took together in a mall photokiosk. There is some kind of tension between the two of them that did not exist between Teena and the other girls. They are grinning competitively at each other. Unlike the other girls in Brandon's life, Michelle is less an object of romance and more of a peer or an equal. Alss notice that in all of her photos with girls, she neer hugs or kisses anyone and the only person that she does put ehr arm around is John Lotter, her future murderer. Of all the women it is only Michelle Lotter that she responds as if she is an equal. I think the reason for that is they were similar and shared startegies to avoid abuse, sexual and otherwise, by drawing attention fro their sexuality, which is what Michelle Lotter seemed to have been doing. During the interview she is the most mature acting of all the folks interviewed, she knows the others and acts confident that she can control them. Perhaps both of them had witnessed their friends in abusive relationships and did not to wind up in their shoes. All of this remains unaddressed in the film replaced by the flashier aspects of Teena Brandon's cross dressing.",4,EULOGY FOR AN ACTRESS,1009756800,"12 31, 2001",2001,8605,"['Teena', 'Brandon', 'was',

516416,AELQCV2OVLMXG,B000035P98,"CriminalJusticeteacherdotcom ""CJTeacher""","[11, 13]","Although I enjoyed the documentary, I thought there could have been more details to explore than to simply turn the camera on and let the subjects talk. And there are so many ""urban myths"" attached to this story -- i.e. the name ""Brandon Teena"" was never used, only ""Brandon.""The film makers had chances to explore, push buttons, and probe, but evidently chose not to do so. Lana obviously considers herself a star to the show but is never pursued as a suspect; the rumour of her being present at the time of the killings could have been explored. Both of the killer's sexualities could have been explored, showing there are no easy answers and no 'simple' crimes. Why did Teena B trust these three low life, white trash losers (Lana & the killers)? What common bond kept them together, even in the midst of a heinous crime? Interesting how much Lana played into the story, yet not once did she show emotion when discussing the crime - except to laugh.The additions to the DVD seem slapped on - and again, could have been so much better. Documentaries can educate and explain, or open an issue to discussion.I truly believe, as a criminologist and as a diversity instructor, all of the persons responsible for the 3 murders were not held accountable. They caught the ""bad guys"" and locked them up, end of story. But there seems to be so much more than this. Lana & her mother should have been interrogated for aiding the killers (Lana's mother admits to doing so in her explanation to hide the evidence). Lana's role in the killing should have been explored. These are not bright, clever people; they could have been ""had"" with the right interview by law enforcement.All in all, kudos to the filmmakers for their work, but consider that nothing is as good as the TRUE story.",3,Nothing is as good as the true story,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,1774,"['enjoyed', 'documentary', 'thought', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'details', 'explore', 'simply', 'turn', 'camera', 'let', 'subjects', 'talk', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'urban', 'myths', 'attached', 'story', 'i.e', 'name', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'was', 'never', 'used', 'only', 'Brandon', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'chances', 'explore', 'push', 'buttons', 'probe', 'evidently', 'chose', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'Lana', 'obviously', 'star', 'show', 'never', 'pursued', 'suspect', 'rumour', 'being', 'present', 'time', 'killings', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'killer', 'sexualities', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'showing', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', ""'simple"", 'crimes', 'Why', 'did', 'Teena', 'B', 'trust', 'three', 'low', 'life', 'white', 'trash', 'losers', 'Lana', 'killers', 'What', 'common', 'bond', 'kept', 'together', 'even', 'midst', 'heinous', 'crime', 'Interesting', 'how', 'much', 'Lana', 'played', 'story', 'yet', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'show', 'emotion', 'when', 'discussing', 'crime', 'laugh.The', 'additions', 'DVD', 'seem', 'slapped', 'again', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Documentaries', 'can', 'educate', 'explain', 'open', 'issue', 'discussion.I', 'truly', 'believe', 'criminologist', 'diversity', 'instructor', 'persons', 'responsible', '3', 'murders', 'were', 'not', 'held', 'accountable', 'caught', 'bad', 'guys', 'locked', 'up', 'end', 'story', 'there', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Lana', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'interrogated', 'aiding', 'killers', 'Lana', 'mother', 'doing', 'so', 'explanation', 'hide', 'evidence', 'Lana', 'role', 'killing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'are', 'not', 'bright', 'clever', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'right', 'interview', 'law', 'enforcement.All', 'kudos', 'filmmakers', 'work', 'consider', 'nothing', 'as', 'good', 'TRUE', 'story']",The Brandon Teena Story VHS

The facts of the case, especially the actual words that the sheriff used to interrogate Brandon after the  rape, were absolutely appalling and display the ignorance and prejudice of  the people in the small town of 5000, known for its dead-end jobs and  domestic violence.Now that I've seen both versions of this story, I must  say I preferred Boys Don't Cry with its scripted performance and planned  dramatic tension.  It also was able to portray some of the more intimate  moments with a sense of humor, such as the scene in which he gets a period  and steals tampax from a convenience store.  Scenes like this are  impossible in a documentary of course.The strength of the documentary,  however, was being able to see the real people, not actors.

516422,A228JH8V9Y700G,B000035P98,MortensOrchid,"[1, 1]","I watched this documentary after seeing the movie Boys Don't Cry.  I immediately gravitated towards it because I wanted to see the real people behind the movie and how close to the true story was to that of the Hollywood imagine of it.  Surprisingly enough, the Hollywood version of the movie followed the tale just as closely as it did the actual story.  What the documentary offers you are a variety of things.  Here we get to meet the real people behind the story which was stranger than fiction, and even more of a sense of tragedy than the Hollywood version could have offered.  And that was a great tragedy.There was once a girl named Teena Brandon in a small town in Nebraska who was not like other girls.  In fact, Teena Brandon did not want to be a girl at all, but rather a man.  After several brushes with the law that caused her to pull up steaks and move to another small town in Nebraska.  Here Teena Brandon became Brandon Teena, starting over this time as a man.  Brandon Teena seemed to be very happy in his new hometown, making new friends and even dating a few girls, and all believed that he was a man.  One of the first people that the viewer meets is one of his former girlfriends who said that she did, in fact, have a sexual relationship with him and did not know even then that he was a woman (thanks to some marital aids).  His former girlfriends sang his praises because Brandon was a complete and utter gentleman towards them, and do not seem to have a bad word to say about him.  His friends, however, were not as sympathetic because they felt that they had been lied to.  And two guys felt so angry about this that once they showed one of his former girlfriends that Brandon was, in fact, a woman by stripping his clothes off before her, they drag her out and rape her.  When Brandon went to the authorities, they laughed him off because they thought it was too ridiculous or strange.  The same two guys would come after Brandon, once again rape, then murder him and two innocent bystanders.What does this tell us?  Does it preach tolerance towards the transgendered?  Does it tell us not to lie to others?  Does it even tell us not to commit a crime?  One could argue it could be a lot of these things, but the bottom line is the fact that there is a lot of anger in the world.  Why did these two guys feel that they had to rape her?  Because they were angry.  Did Brandon feel good about the fact that he was born a woman but wanted to be a man?  Probably not.  Why did the two former girlfriends have nothing but nice things to say about him even when they found out that this man who was too good to be true was just so because he was a woman?  Maybe they were just as angry but felt that they had to justify their behaviors.  Why did law enforcement do little to nothing about the situation until Brandon and the others had to die?  That left the most anger.  Now that Brandon is dead, who do we see about that?  No one, because we can't.  It's something that will linger forever, and there will never be a true answer to how to absolve anger, except to recognize ignorance for what it is.Moving documentary, not for the faint of heart.

I was totally blown away watching this film, because I was already familiar with the characters involved in Teena Brandon's life and murder. To see and hear them was quite chilling, especially the interviews from the two killers. Although not reflective of the entire population of Falls City, the crowd Teena hung around were an ignorant, hardscrabble, hard-drinking bunch: two ex-cons and women in low-paying, dead-end jobs and/or teenage mothers with two or more kids on welfare. Even Lotter, one of the killers, admitted that if a woman in Falls City managed to finish high school and get a steady job without getting pregnant and/or dropping out of high school, that was doing ""real good.""The documentary traces Teena Brandon's life, from birth to her horrendous death. The filmmakers did a superb job of setting the stage with visuals and music, giving viewers an idea of the type of place Falls City, Nebraska was: a small town composed of blue-collar or uneducated homophobic whites. Their idea of entertainment was demolition derbys and tractor pulls, or getting high and/or drunk. For a transgendered person like Teena, Falls City was the wrong place to settle down. To compound matters,  Teena fell into the wrong crowd of people as well, a decision that would ultimately prove tragic.In addition to interviewing the main players, the filmmakers interviewed the parents,  relatives, prison inmates and former girlfriends, who provided valuable insights  into Teena's life and her killers. You knew from the start that Teena's story was not going to end happily; her history of petty crimes followed her from Lincoln to Falls City, and set off a series of events that led to her demise. Transgendered activists were interviewed, as well as other law enforcement people who were horrified by the senseless killings by the two low-life punks.I recommend this DVD to all, especially those interested in true crime, the Teena Brandon case or in transgender studies.",5,"Chilling, Real-Life Account of a Senseless Crime",1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,2141,"['would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'read', 'Aphrodite', 'Jones', 'Wanted', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'much', 'greater', 'impact', 'was', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'characters', 'involved', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'life', 'murder', 'see', 'hear', 'was', 'quite', 'chilling', 'especially', 'interviews', 'two', 'killers', 'not', 'reflective', 'entire', 'population', 'Falls', 'City', 'crowd', 'Teena', 'hung', 'around', 'were', 'ignorant', 'hardscrabble', 'hard-drinking', 'bunch', 'two', 'ex-cons', 'women', 'low-paying', 'dead-end', 'jobs', 'and/or', 'teenage', 'mothers', 'two', 'more', 'kids', 'welfare', 'Even', 'Lotter', 'one', 'killers', 'admitted', 'woman', 'Falls', 'City', 'managed', 'finish', 'high', 'school', 'get', 'steady', 'job', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'and/or', 'dropping', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'doing', 'real', 'good', 'documentary', 'traces', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'life', 'birth', 'horrendous', 'death', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'setting', 'stage', 'visuals', 'music', 'giving', 'viewers', 'idea', 'type', 'place', 'Falls', 'City', 'Nebraska', 'was', 'small', 'town', 'composed', 'blue-collar', 'uneducated', 'homophobic', 'whites', 'idea', 'entertainment', 'was', 'demolition', 'derbys', 'tractor', 'pulls', 'getting', 'high', 'and/or', 'drunk', 'transgendered', 'person', 'Teena', 'Falls', 'City', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'settle', 'down', 'compound', 'matters', 'Teena', 'fell', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'people', 'well', 'decision', 'would', 'ultimately', 'prove', 'tragic.In', 'addition', 'interviewing', 'main', 'players', 'filmmakers', 'interviewed', 'parents', 'relatives', 'prison', 'inmates', 'former', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'provided', 'valuable', 'insights', 'Teena', 'life', 'killers', 'knew', 'start', 'Teena', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'end', 'happily', 'history', 'petty', 'crimes', 'followed', 'Lincoln', 'Falls', 'City', 'set', 'off', 'series', 'events', 'led', 'demise', 'Transgendered', 'activists', 'were', 'interviewed', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'law', 'enforcement', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'horrified', 'senseless', 'killings', 'two', 'low-life', 'punks.I', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'especially', 'interested', 'true', 'crime', 'Teena', 'Brandon', 'case', 'transgender', 'studies']",The Brandon Teena Story VHS

I realize too that you have to understand what was behind the motivation that led two seemingly almost harmless young men to do something so vile. For one thing these guys felt betrayed and discusted learning that Brandon Teena had lived a lie and took advantage of their own family members. They were raised in a community that simply came from a mindset very different from those of us raised in a enviroment where homosexuality is much more common and evident. They clearly were stunned to learn that someone they thought was a male was actually female. I think it shocked them and they reacted without thinking first. On the other hand one question this documentary raises is what can we do to try and understand Brandon Teenas impulses. Unless you have lived in the body of a human being that is one gender, yet every fiber of your being feels like you were meant to be another gender, then you can never understand people like Brandon Teena. Clearly Teena simply could not accept living as a female, and it caused him to go to great lengths to hide the truth. One lie leads to many, and it can really effect people who come from a place like Nebraska, where a sense of religious morality is considered extremely sacred. For the two young men who did such brutal things, to them Brandon was discusting and perverted. A liar, and a despicable person. They felt thet way so deeply that they were driven to do something so terrible. And its just a horrible thing to be born a woman but know you were meant to be a man. How does one deal with such a miserable situation? This documentary should be a textbook example of just what can happen when bigotry is given full reign.

516428,A1FQVUPUE8G30O,B000035P98,"""takintime""","[127, 129]","I decided to see this video before seeing &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;, the movie based on the same story.  I have concluded that seeing both films is essential for anyone not directly involved in the actual situation to  understand what went on.  &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; took some liberties  with the facts involved in the true story, as most artistic works must  ultimately do.  &quot;The Brandon Tenna Story&quot; focused on the facts  leading up to the hate-crime rape and murder--showing John Lotter and Tom  Nissen as amoral sociopaths who, even two years after their crimes, see  themselves as homegrown heros who saved a friend through sexual assault and  who each proclaims his innocence of the subsequent triple (not double)  murder that followed.  (This video tells of the third victim of the  murder--a physically disabled African American man who just happened to be  at the murder scene at the time.)  Also in this film (and missing from  &quot;BDC&quot;) are interviews with the mother of Brandon Teena and the  parents of the friend who offered him shelter and tried to offer him a  refuge from Lotter and Nissen, only to die for her efforts an leave a  9-month-old son an orphan.  The actual filmed interviews with the deputy  sheriff who let Lotter and Nissen go, even after they as good as confessed  their involvement in the rape to him, is perhaps the most puzzling  character of all in this video.  The excerpts from his interrogations of  Brandon after the rape, and subsequently of Nissen and Lotter, indicate  that he was far more aggressive and harsh in his questioning of the victim.  There is evidence that both Nissen and Lotter were already well-known as  violent trouble-makers in the county's law enforcement officers, this  deputy included.  In his brief appearances in the film, the sheriff of the  county where Brandon dies gives a distinct impression of a town in severe  financial depression where violence of all sorts is an everyday affair that  everyone learns to live with, if they want to live at all.  Somehow, a  careful analysis of all that information, and a bit more fact gathering,  might ultimately explain why, even after the murders, the deputy seems to  regard himself as a law enforcement professional who did his job as best he  could.  At the end of this video, however, he seems to be nearly as  culpable in the crimes as Nissen and Lotter themselves.  I don't apologize  for that impression, since evidently the Nebraska courts are still dealing  with that very issue in a lawsuit filed by Brandon's mother.This video  does not portray Brandon in his best light (I definitely refer anyone to  &quot;BDC&quot; for that), because it seems to focus more on the basic  facts of his too-short life more than on the pain and confusion that must  have been his--trying to live as a man when he had been given a body that  appeared to be mostly female, and in a part of the world where the people  surrounding him were too busy screwing up their own lives to understand his  unique set of problems.  So Brandon's survival skills came to include lying  and occasionally writing bad checks.  But even the most hardcore pragmatist  would have to say at the end of the film that Brandon's &quot;victims&quot;  would recover in short order and get on with their lives.  That's a great  deal more than can be said for the victims of Nissen and Lotter, who in  this documentary seem to be singing, &quot;We're just some good ol' boys,  never meaning' no harm&quot; to the world.&quot;Perhaps the most  chilling part of viewing this excellent documentary is that knowledge that  this savagery took place only seven years ago in America, helped along by  people who at least still give lip service to the idea that they were doing  the right thing at the time.  At the end of the film, one's mind is filled  with the usual 20/20 hindsight solutions for the perverted conditions that  enabled the slaughter, and a quiet determination to do whatever possible to  change those conditions wherever they may still, unfortunately be  found.A powerful film, a definite must-see.",4,The tragic life art imitated,957312000,"05 3, 2000",2000,4112,"['decided', 'see', 'video', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'quot', 'movie', 'based', 'same', 'story', 'have', 'concluded', 'seeing', 'films', 'essential', 'anyone', 'not', 'directly', 'involved', 'actual', 'situation', 'understand', 'what', 'went', 'quot', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'quot', 'took', 'liberties', 'facts', 'involved', 'true', 'story', 'most', 'artistic', 'works', 'must', 'ultimately', 'do', 'quot', 'Brandon', 'Tenna', 'Story', 'quot', 'focused', 'facts', 'leading', 'up', 'hate-crime', 'rape', 'murder', 'showing', 'John', 'Lotter', 'Tom', 'Nissen', 'amoral', 'sociopaths', 'who', 'even', 'two', 'years', 'crimes', 'see', 'homegrown', 'heros', 'who', 'saved', 'friend', 'sexual', 'assault', 'who', 'innocence', 'subsequent', 'triple', 'not', 'double', 'murder', 'followed', 'video', 'third', 'victim', 'murder', 'physically', 'disabled', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'murder', 'scene', 'time', 'Also', 'film', 'missing', 'quot', 'BDC', 'quot', 'are', 'interviews', 'mother', 'Brandon', 'Teena', 'parents', 'friend', 'who', 'offered', 'shelter', 'tried', 'offer', 'refuge', 'Lotter', 'Nissen', 'only', 'die', 'efforts', 'leave', '9-month-old', 'son', 'orphan', 'actual', 'filmed', 'interviews', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'who', 'let', 'Lotter', 'Nissen', 'go', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'confessed', 'involvement', 'rape', 'perhaps', 'most', 'puzzling', 'character', 'video', 'excerpts', 'interrogations', 'Brandon', 'rape', 'subsequently', 'Nissen', 'Lotter', 'indicate', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'aggressive', 'harsh', 'questioning', 'victim', 'evidence', 'Nissen', 'Lotter', 'were', 'already', 'well-known', 'violent', 'trouble-makers', 'county', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'deputy', 'included', 'brief', 'appearances', 'film', 'sheriff', 'county', 'where', 'Brandon', 'distinct', 'impression', 'town', 'severe', 'financial', 'depression', 'where', 'violence', 'sorts', 'everyday', 'affair', 'everyone', 'live', 'want', 'live', 'Somehow', 'careful', 'analysis', 'information', 'bit', 'more', 'fact', 'gathering', 'might', 'ultimately', 'explain', 'why', 'even', 'murders', 'deputy', 'regard', 'law', 'enforcement', 'professional', 'who', 'did', 'job', 'best', 'could', 'end', 'video', 'however', 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'culpable', 'crimes', 'Nissen', 'Lotter', 'do', ""n't"", 'apologize', 'impression', 'evidently', 'Nebraska', 'courts', 'are', 'still', 'dealing', 'very', 'issue', 'lawsuit', 'filed', 'Brandon', 'mother.This', 'video', 'not', 'portray', 'Brandon', 'best', 'light', 'definitely', 'refer', 'anyone', 'quot', 'BDC', 'quot', 'focus', 'more', 'basic', 'facts', 'too-short', 'life', 'more', 'pain', 'confusion', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'live', 'man', 'when', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'body', 'appeared', 'be', 'mostly', 'female', 'part', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'surrounding', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'screwing', 'up', 'own', 'lives', 'understand', 'unique', 'set', 'problems', 'So', 'Brandon', 'survival', 'skills', 'came', 'include', 'lying', 'occasionally', 'writing', 'bad', 'checks', 'even', 'most', 'hardcore', 'pragmatist', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'end', 'film', 'Brandon', 'quot', 'victims', 'quot', 'would', 'recover', 'short', 'order', 'get', 'lives', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'victims', 'Nissen', 'Lotter', 'who', 'documentary', 'seem', 'be', 'singing', 'quot', ""'re"", 'just', 'good', 'ol', 'boys', 'never', 'meaning', 'harm', 'quot', 'world.', 'quot', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'chilling', 'part', 'viewing', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'knowledge', 'savagery', 'took', 'place', 'only', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'America', 'helped', 'along', 'people', 'who', 'least', 'still', 'give', 'lip', 'service', 'idea', 'were', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'time', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'mind', 'filled', 'usual', '20/20', 'hindsight', 'solutions', 'perverted', 'conditions', 'enabled', 'slaughter', 'quiet', 'determination', 'do', 'possible', 'change', 'conditions', 'wherever', 'may', 'still', 'unfortunately', 'be', 'found.A', 'powerful', 'film', 'definite', 'must-see']",The Brandon Teena Story VHS

What they did to Brandon was disturbing and wretched! To say they did this because ""she"" deserved it was disgusting. In my opinion, I truly think that those guys wanted Brandon, and were now thinking in their tiny brains that wow, I'm not gay, he's a she, now I can bang her! And they did! That's just my opinion! Now, with that said I'm surprised only one is on death row!I think this documentary or others equivalent to should be shown in schools. I think docs like Bully, and movies like Zero Dark Thirty , Columbine, Lincoln, whatever has kids taking drugs and o.d.ing on or cyberbullying, or taking naked pictures, date rape, other stupid things kids are doing that parents don't know, or don't want to know  and others should defiantly should be shown in schools to educate our kids about important things that are going on that need to be learned, not turn a blind eye too.
