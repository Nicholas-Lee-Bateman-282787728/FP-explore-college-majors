Great depiction of a future earth (hover vehicles etc.). All the main characters have a distinct look and personality, even the voices are well done.Its so poignant at times its almost sickly, yet rarely crosses over.Its also VERY FUNNY.Ex: the heroine is sleeping on a park bench after another disaster and says ""wow the stars are beautiful, even more so when they're blurred by my tears"" then she gets kidnapped...Box set has some nice extras as well. This may not be your cup of soy tea if you like giant robots or alchemy.",5,"Great writing, great char developement",1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,647,"['become', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'Great', 'story', 'time', 'develop', 'getting', 'slow', 'boring', 'Great', 'depiction', 'future', 'earth', 'hover', 'vehicles', 'etc.', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'distinct', 'look', 'personality', 'even', 'voices', 'are', 'well', 'done.Its', 'so', 'poignant', 'times', 'almost', 'sickly', 'yet', 'rarely', 'over.Its', 'also', 'VERY', 'FUNNY.Ex', 'heroine', 'sleeping', 'park', 'bench', 'disaster', 'wow', 'stars', 'are', 'beautiful', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', ""'re"", 'blurred', 'tears', 'then', 'kidnapped', 'Box', 'set', 'nice', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'soy', 'tea', 'like', 'giant', 'robots', 'alchemy']",Daphne in the Brilliant Blue

Getting rejected by the Ocean Agency, eviction, and the death of her only relative, her grandfather. She's taken in by a group of investigators that will do anything for the right price. All of her coworkers are pretty quirky and crazy. She's a tough little thing so she sticks with it and has fun, even if she doesn't realize it. She has amnesia. Her family apparently died in an accident years before. But there is a dangerous secret the Ocean Agency is keeping from her. Can she regain her memory and remember the truth. And what will happen if she does.This anime is a lot of fun. There is plenty of drama and action. The laughs keep coming too. These scantily clad chicks never stop getting into danger. The animation and the voice acting in this series is good. Maia is a very compelling heroine she really makes you care about her. I enjoyed this anime and I hope you do too.",5,I hope more people catch this anime,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,961,"['Maia', 'world', 'covered', 'mostly', 'water', 'been', 'having', 'rough', 'time', 'Getting', 'rejected', 'Ocean', 'Agency', 'eviction', 'death', 'only', 'relative', 'grandfather', 'taken', 'group', 'investigators', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'right', 'price', 'coworkers', 'are', 'pretty', 'quirky', 'crazy', 'tough', 'little', 'thing', 'fun', 'even', ""n't"", 'realize', 'amnesia', 'family', 'apparently', 'died', 'accident', 'years', 'dangerous', 'secret', 'Ocean', 'Agency', 'keeping', 'Can', 'regain', 'memory', 'remember', 'truth', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'does.This', 'anime', 'lot', 'fun', 'plenty', 'drama', 'action', 'laughs', 'keep', 'coming', 'too', 'scantily', 'clad', 'chicks', 'never', 'stop', 'getting', 'danger', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'series', 'good', 'Maia', 'very', 'compelling', 'heroine', 'really', 'care', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'hope', 'do', 'too']",Daphne in the Brilliant Blue
995639,AFV2584U13XP3,B000FTCEUA,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]","I got this at Suncoast when it was on sale for a more reasonable price the series is not bad and neither or the voice actors or animation.  That being said I do have to say I found it a bit humorous when these woman would do one of their jobs in their outfits which looked more suited for strippers than hard-core fem fighters. I understand that most animes have some fan-service but again what they drew to have these females wear was ridiculous especially for the young newbie Maia.  The series itself felt a mix of both Water World and Charlie's Angels that being is a lot of the action dealt with them mostly in ocean scenes.  The series has a very dramatic morale in the storyline but for most of the series it was mostly light-hearted and comedic.  I say to those who like light  drama,comedy,and with a tough of light romance this set is one  to get but I do say wait until it is a more reasonable price or see if there is a sale going on at a store near you..",4,Sci-Fi Charlie's Angels With Lots of Fan Service,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,967,"['got', 'Suncoast', 'when', 'was', 'sale', 'more', 'reasonable', 'price', 'series', 'not', 'bad', 'voice', 'actors', 'animation', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'bit', 'humorous', 'when', 'woman', 'would', 'do', 'one', 'jobs', 'outfits', 'looked', 'more', 'suited', 'strippers', 'hard-core', 'fem', 'fighters', 'understand', 'most', 'animes', 'have', 'fan-service', 'again', 'what', 'drew', 'have', 'females', 'wear', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'especially', 'young', 'newbie', 'Maia', 'series', 'felt', 'mix', 'Water', 'World', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'being', 'lot', 'action', 'dealt', 'mostly', 'ocean', 'scenes', 'series', 'very', 'dramatic', 'morale', 'storyline', 'most', 'series', 'was', 'mostly', 'light-hearted', 'comedic', 'say', 'who', 'like', 'light', 'drama', 'comedy', 'tough', 'light', 'romance', 'set', 'one', 'get', 'do', 'say', 'wait', 'more', 'reasonable', 'price', 'see', 'sale', 'going', 'store', 'you..']",Daphne in the Brilliant Blue
