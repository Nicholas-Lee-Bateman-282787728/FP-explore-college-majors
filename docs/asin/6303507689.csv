378275,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303507689,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Paul Newman, in my eyes, is the greatest actor to ever walk the face of the earth.  His talent knew no bounds, and he showed that with ease as he effortlessly floated from one film to the next.  He exhibited such natural grace and charisma on screen, constructing what may very well be the strongest resume of any actor.I think it's safe to say that he is strongly missed.For me, `Nobody's Fool' is one of his crowning achievements.  That isn't to say that I think the film is particularly wonderful (as you can see, I gave the film as a whole a C) but his performance within it is outstanding.  Honestly, this should have netted HIM his second Oscar, not Tom Hanks!  Alas, the Academy is rarely smart enough to reward the most deserving performance, so I won't harp on that too much.  The fact remains that Newman's performance here (light, affecting, natural, layered) towers over many and actually elevates the film, which is dampened by a few of its own vices.To get the negative out of the way; the film has a cheap feel which makes it seem like a `made for TV' movie and the script lags in areas, and that whole subplot involving the bank is poorly constructed and serves as more of a distraction than anything else.  While I think that the idea behind Peter's failing marriage is ideal for the development of Sully's person, it is handled strangely and doesn't totally connect, and the overall handling of Peter and his family (including his sons and mother) is weak and at times can take you out of the film.Eh.But, with all that said, there is something special here to be seen, and I totally recommend this film so don't take my criticism wrong.The film tells the story of Sully, an immature elderly man who has squandered most of what he has ever had.  He abandoned his family years ago and has no relationship with his son Peter.  He has no job and his constant attempts at suing his former employer for a `work related injury' prove fruitless.  He has no love life, although he quite obviously pines over his ex-bosses wife.  His only true companion is an elderly woman who also serves as his landlord.  When he happens to reunite with his son, thanks to a series of odd coincidences, his life starts to take a deeper shape.Sully starts to grow up.The entire cast does an admirable job here; some more so than others.  Like I mentioned, Newman is the star here and it shows in every frame.  Bruce Willis is also top notch here, reserved and astute (how he missed an Oscar nomination that year, when he had this and `Pulp Fiction' under is belt is beyond my comprehension).  Jessica Tandy is appropriate here and Melanie Griffith is beautifully sincere and believable.  Dylan Walsh has improved over the years (his `Nip/Tuck' performance year after year is quite impressive) but he is the weakest link here, in my opinion.In the end I advise you to see the film.  As an ensemble it works beautifully, every performance in step with the others, and as a complete film is carries a message and contains a brilliant performance by Newman, but I can't say it is perfect or even `great'.It is a good film, that is all.",3,Not too shabby...,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,3125,"['Paul', 'Newman', 'eyes', 'greatest', 'actor', 'ever', 'walk', 'face', 'earth', 'talent', 'knew', 'bounds', 'showed', 'ease', 'effortlessly', 'floated', 'one', 'film', 'next', 'exhibited', 'such', 'natural', 'grace', 'charisma', 'screen', 'constructing', 'what', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'strongest', 'resume', 'actor.I', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'strongly', 'missed.For', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'one', 'crowning', 'achievements', ""n't"", 'say', 'think', 'film', 'particularly', 'wonderful', 'can', 'see', 'gave', 'film', 'whole', 'C', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'Honestly', 'should', 'have', 'netted', 'HIM', 'second', 'Oscar', 'not', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Alas', 'Academy', 'rarely', 'smart', 'enough', 'reward', 'most', 'deserving', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'harp', 'too', 'much', 'fact', 'Newman', 'performance', 'here', 'light', 'affecting', 'natural', 'layered', 'towers', 'many', 'actually', 'film', 'dampened', 'few', 'own', 'vices.To', 'get', 'negative', 'way', 'film', 'cheap', 'feel', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'script', 'areas', 'whole', 'subplot', 'involving', 'bank', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'more', 'distraction', 'anything', 'else', 'think', 'idea', 'Peter', 'failing', 'marriage', 'ideal', 'development', 'Sully', 'person', 'handled', 'strangely', ""n't"", 'totally', 'connect', 'overall', 'handling', 'Peter', 'family', 'including', 'sons', 'mother', 'weak', 'times', 'can', 'take', 'film.Eh.But', 'said', 'something', 'special', 'here', 'be', 'seen', 'totally', 'recommend', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'criticism', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'story', 'Sully', 'immature', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'squandered', 'most', 'what', 'ever', 'had', 'abandoned', 'family', 'years', 'ago', 'relationship', 'son', 'Peter', 'job', 'constant', 'attempts', 'suing', 'former', 'employer', 'work', 'related', 'injury', 'prove', 'fruitless', 'love', 'life', 'quite', 'obviously', 'ex-bosses', 'wife', 'only', 'true', 'companion', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'landlord', 'When', 'reunite', 'son', 'thanks', 'series', 'odd', 'coincidences', 'life', 'take', 'deeper', 'shape.Sully', 'grow', 'up.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'admirable', 'job', 'here', 'more', 'so', 'others', 'mentioned', 'Newman', 'star', 'here', 'frame', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'here', 'reserved', 'astute', 'how', 'missed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'year', 'when', 'had', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'belt', 'comprehension', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'appropriate', 'here', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'believable', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'improved', 'years', 'Nip/Tuck', 'performance', 'year', 'year', 'quite', 'impressive', 'weakest', 'link', 'here', 'opinion.In', 'end', 'advise', 'see', 'film', 'ensemble', 'beautifully', 'performance', 'step', 'others', 'complete', 'film', 'message', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Newman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'perfect', 'even', ""great'.It"", 'good', 'film']",Nobody's Fool VHS

From that point, the finest performers out there were placed into the hands of master director and writer, Robert Benton to create this brilliant film. In a forgotten upstate New York town, Sully (Newman) is approaching retirement in a life that was based on labor that has left him with a destroyed knee, destroyed marriage and an estranged relationship with his son. He rents a room from an old woman who lives alone in a large house that used to be the Grand Dame of the town in years past. The house and street, like the woman herself (played remarkably by Jessica Tandy in her final acting performance)have become worn out, sagging along the roof lines and  a street sprinkled with large trees in various stages of dying; a metaphor that isn't lost on anyone. Outstanding performances by Bruce Willis, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melanie Griffith, and Josef Sommers are just a few of the performances that create a world into which we become lost for a period of 108 minutes. Benton and cinematographer John Bailey have captured the gray bleak winter of upstate New York and both this ambiance and the town itself (like the Street mentioned before) become a character entity all on it's own.Paul Newman was nominated and won multiple acting awards for this role and many would say that the role suited him, thinking that this is how acting works, but instead, Newman was given a rare opportunity in Hollywood: the chance to perform a character that was so well defined and so flawlessly written and directed that an Oscar nod was guaranteed at the first table read.(It is interested that Newman would later play a supporting role in Russo's next film, ""Empire Falls"" for HBO Films). An actor of Newman's quality combined with all of the elements attached to this film create a vehicle for Newman that allows him to stand out along with a cast whose awarded hardware would more than fill the back of a pick-up truck.

He is constantly at odds with her stuffy bank-manager son (Josef Sommer) who wants Sully out of his mother's house; Sully is also at mild odds with several other people in town, including his ex-wife, and an uncredited performance by Bruce Willis as Carl Roebuck, a local construction-site manager who is frittering away the family fortune on trips with floozy office assistants. The cast is stuffed with excellent actors and performances, at a time when some of them were just becoming known; Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a local policeman who makes Barney Fife look competent, and Melanie Griffith, as Carl Roebuck's exasperated wife, plays an excellent foil to Sully, who banters with her as he steals her husband's snowblower with her tacit consent.The film meanders amiably along through the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as Sully deals with various small crises in his life and amongst the citizens of the town. There is a comfortableness about this movie that makes you want to just sit back and enjoy it; nothing momentous happens, just the normal give-and-take of a town this size, where everybody knows everybody and even the most hopeless members of the community are given plenty of slack (Sully is let out of jail to be a pallbearer at one point)and the clear affection amongst most of the community comes through plainly.I absolutely love this little classic, and I believe it deserves to be on the shelf alongside everyone's favourite holiday movies; since it spans both Thanksgiving and Christmas, it could fit either. The tolerance and humour shown throughout the film feels as welcome as an old and well-loved article of clothing, and the fine filming is enhanced by an underplayed and sweet score by Howard Shore.",5,Less is more,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,2294,"['gentle', 'small', 'movie', 'small-town', 'living', 'citizens', 'particularly', 'blatantly', 'unapologetic', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'named', 'Sully', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'exactly', 'manages', 'optimism', 'bonding', 'town', 'survive', 'quite', 'well', 'spite', 'himself.Sully', 'co-existed', 'former', 'eighth-grade', 'teacher', 'apparent', 'decades', 'great', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'next-to-last', 'performance', 'living', 'upstairs', 'apartment', 'doing', 'when', 'odd', 'jobs', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'eye', 'constantly', 'odds', 'stuffy', 'bank-manager', 'son', 'Josef', 'Sommer', 'who', 'Sully', 'mother', 'house', 'Sully', 'also', 'mild', 'odds', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'town', 'including', 'ex-wife', 'uncredited', 'performance', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Carl', 'Roebuck', 'local', 'construction-site', 'manager', 'who', 'frittering', 'away', 'family', 'fortune', 'trips', 'floozy', 'office', 'assistants', 'cast', 'stuffed', 'excellent', 'actors', 'performances', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'just', 'becoming', 'known', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'local', 'policeman', 'who', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'look', 'competent', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Carl', 'Roebuck', 'exasperated', 'wife', 'excellent', 'foil', 'Sully', 'who', 'husband', 'snowblower', 'tacit', 'consent.The', 'film', 'meanders', 'amiably', 'month', 'Thanksgiving', 'Christmas', 'Sully', 'various', 'small', 'crises', 'life', 'amongst', 'citizens', 'town', 'comfortableness', 'movie', 'want', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'nothing', 'momentous', 'happens', 'just', 'normal', 'give-and-take', 'town', 'size', 'where', 'everybody', 'everybody', 'even', 'most', 'hopeless', 'members', 'community', 'are', 'given', 'plenty', 'slack', 'Sully', 'let', 'jail', 'be', 'pallbearer', 'one', 'point', 'clear', 'affection', 'most', 'community', 'plainly.I', 'absolutely', 'love', 'little', 'classic', 'believe', 'be', 'shelf', 'everyone', 'favourite', 'holiday', 'movies', 'Thanksgiving', 'Christmas', 'could', 'fit', 'either', 'tolerance', 'humour', 'shown', 'film', 'feels', 'as', 'welcome', 'old', 'well-loved', 'article', 'clothing', 'fine', 'filming', 'enhanced', 'underplayed', 'sweet', 'score', 'Howard', 'Shore']",Nobody's Fool VHS

Tomer,"[0, 0]","Old men work until we die: forgotten members of productive society, no longer part of breathing souls in our post-industrial society of Unemployment & Corporate Investment in China, we all know the lost 50+ citizen who barely survives. Tossed out of every family, only drinking friends continue to know them. We sense their danger: most die homeless, with friends dying before them, and no means of support.But, there are a few who can still stand - mostly on their own - with few remaining friends & patriots of America lost. Sully, boldly American and staunch defender of his own liberties becomes a grandfather. Unwittingly, at first, Sully realizes other members of his extended family have lives, filled with emotions, and they need him. Strangely, the old man arrives at the decision to include his family in his life; but, first, he has to finalize the delusion of stealing the most beautiful woman in North Bath.Trauma and abuse rang in his childhood mansion on the hill: where Sully's father brutalized his own family, including our Sully. Despite his obvious leadership abilities and natural talents, Sully had squandered his impressive gifts. Instead, life was met with no sense of personal commitment: minimal wages, no plans for any future, and little or no earnings for child support. His son was grown, had his own family, and had lost his professorship when Sully's life refocused on today's news.Every second, within every minute, of this tightly constructed play-movie is superbly crafted, acted, and intensely understated as American small-town, only. Newman knew what he held in his hands when he accepted Russo's divinely inspired work. The film is one of the best adaptations from an outstanding full-length book you will ever find in your lifetime. I enjoy the reality, and the closeness we enjoy from all the characters. Each character lives the days, Sully moves from zero to grandfather, his own tormentor becomes Sully's guest when he's thrown-out ... And, reward of his patience and suffering arrives in his home of friends as he stares down his father's ghost.Through our lives, we've known - or, thought we knew - Sully in our city, town, or village. We had always wondered why there was not a higher purpose or goal for his intellect, status, or ability.

Small, people-centered (rather than action-centered) films like this are increasingly rare, sadly, especially ones with such an impressive cast. It's sad that we've had to lose Paul Newman, but in one of his last central roles he absolutely eats up the screen as Sully, a cantankerous but likeable itinerant carpenter who has never managed to make much of himself. As he rebuilds his relationship with his son (Dylan Walsh), carries on a no-love-all-hate relationship with his boss (Bruce Willis), and flirts with an intimate relationship with his boss' wife (Melanie Griffith), Sully exemplifies the kind of small-town character that we've all known; no one says anything all that nice about them while they're here, but we miss `em when they're gone. The film also makes you feel the authentic cold of an upstate New York winter. Look for Philip Seymour Hoffman in a small, early role as a surly cop, and for Jessica Tandy in her last role, as Newman's landlady. She passed away before the film was released, and it was dedicated to her memory.

But as for the movie, it seemed to want to be a Norman-Rockwellesque presentation and play to middle America, but the last third of it turned for awhile into a different movie, with harsh language and a topless woman sitting at the poker table next to Bruce Willis.  It was basically a pleasant if leisurely couple of hours with Paul Newman in a small town, playing a curmudgeonly anti-hero.

Newman's talent should have been recognized in this movie at least with an Oscar nomination but alas, he's missed several Oscars that should have decorated his mantle--The Verdict being one and Nobody's Fool his crowning achievement. He has perfectly captured the walk and ""hobble"" of a 60 year-old with a knee injury and arthritis. He and Jessica Tandy play off each other like best friends, she has an undying respect and appreciation for Sully (Newman) and he loves her and cares for her with such tenderness--best acting ever from these two in Nobody's Fool.

378385,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6303507689,Michael Butts,"[2, 2]","Paul Newman received two major critics awards and a nomination for a Best Actor Oscar for this delightfully underplayed and poignant look at an aging 'fool'.  Newman was born to play Sully, a crusty old codger who is trying to sue his boss (a marvelously restrained Bruce Willis) for a leg injury sustained while on the job.  Into the picture comes his son (Dylan Walsh of Nip and Tuck, and very effective), whom he left when the boy was only a year old.  Newman has a cautious relationship that develops nicely, and offers Sully a chance at redemption.  Willis' lovely wife (a nice turn by Melanie Griffith) knows Brucie is playing around, and has become sort of a fantasy lover for Newman.  Newman also is the tenant of the divine Jessica Tandy (in her last role), whose banker son (Josef Sommer) wants her to sell her house and get rid of Newman.  Oscar nominee Philip Seymour Hoffman has an early role as the blustery yet bufoonic deputy, and Philip Stuart Vince is Newman's best friend who becomes jealous of Sully's new relationship with his son.  There's also a pretty fun running gag about Willis' snowblower, and it's all handled with utmost care by Oscar winning director Robert Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer).

I remembered it as a warm (an odd adjective considering the snowy setting) and heartbreaking comedy about a man down on his luck, but not down on life.  I remembered right.But that description does not do justice to this fine piece of work.  Sure, being familiar with the source material, which provides an abundance of background information on the characters, helps.  But it is not required reading.  For in watching the film again, I realized that it gives you all the information that you need.  Not with pages of prosaic exposition, but with a wink, a glance, a grin, and most telling, a sparkle in the eye.The four gestures noted above could come from anyone.  But if you're going to do it right, why not go for the best.  Paul Newman is perfectly cast as Donald ""Sully"" Sullivan.  He has the combined capacity for the man's dry wit, quick tongue, and emotional sincerity, rolled up in a rugged but worn exterior that's not afraid to show hurt (be it physical or emotional).  It's a no-brainer to say that he does a wicked job here.  The real questions come with the rest of the cast.  They are a hit-or-miss bunch.The ""hits"" include: Gene Saks (who directed ""The Odd Couple"", among other movies) as the one-legged attorney who sticks by Sully even though he knows that they make a losing pair; Pruitt Taylor Vince as sidekick Rub, who doesn't come off as pathetic as the character did in the book (how could he!) but pulls of with aplomb his simpleness and his endearing nature; Jessica Tandy as landlady Miss Beryl, who died postproduction and who the film is justifiably dedicated to; and even Bruce Willis, who's smug act I've tired of lately, gamely holds his own in his scenes with Newman.The ""misses"" include: Dylan Walsh as Sully's son (my antipathy towards his performance may come from the fact that Peter was a darker and smarter character in the book, more akin to his old man; Walsh's Peter is more of a bland young man not fully formed yet); and Melanie Griffith, as the prettiest (and most put-upon) girl in town, is caught once or twice delivering her lines rather than inhabiting her character while she speaks, a sin amplified when compared to Newman's perfect ease of speech.  Thankfully, neither of these sub-par performance harmed the film's overall effect in any way.Director/Writer Robert Benton does a fine job of collating Richard Russo's novel into a cohesive movie.  The novel, if filmed as is, would have been several days long; there is so much depth and texture there.  Benton manages to combine some storylines, excise others that weren't really needed, and still maintain the tone and flavour of the book.  In my estimation, what was a monumental task feels like it was pulled off with relative ease.  I know that's not the case, that hard work went into the story's deconstruction, but am glad as a member of the audience that it appears that way.Just like it's source, ""Nobody's Fool"" made me laugh out loud on several occasions, tear up on several others, and the rest of the time left me with a happy grin, in awe at what I was seeing.",5,"Lucky you, here's a great movie",984700800,"03 16, 2001",2001,3187,"['Having', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'reviewing', 'book', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'had', 'itch', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'remembered', 'warm', 'odd', 'adjective', 'considering', 'snowy', 'setting', 'heartbreaking', 'comedy', 'man', 'down', 'luck', 'not', 'down', 'life', 'remembered', 'right.But', 'description', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'fine', 'piece', 'work', 'Sure', 'being', 'familiar', 'source', 'material', 'abundance', 'background', 'information', 'characters', 'not', 'required', 'reading', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'realized', 'information', 'need', 'Not', 'pages', 'prosaic', 'exposition', 'wink', 'glance', 'grin', 'most', 'telling', 'sparkle', 'eye.The', 'four', 'gestures', 'noted', 'above', 'could', 'come', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'right', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'best', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Donald', 'Sully', 'Sullivan', 'combined', 'capacity', 'man', 'dry', 'wit', 'quick', 'tongue', 'emotional', 'sincerity', 'rolled', 'up', 'rugged', 'worn', 'exterior', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'hurt', 'be', 'physical', 'emotional', 'no-brainer', 'say', 'wicked', 'job', 'here', 'real', 'questions', 'come', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'hit-or-miss', 'bunch.The', 'hits', 'include', 'Gene', 'Saks', 'who', 'directed', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'other', 'movies', 'one-legged', 'attorney', 'who', 'Sully', 'even', 'make', 'losing', 'pair', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'sidekick', 'Rub', 'who', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'as', 'pathetic', 'character', 'did', 'book', 'how', 'could', 'pulls', 'aplomb', 'simpleness', 'endearing', 'nature', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'landlady', 'Miss', 'Beryl', 'who', 'died', 'postproduction', 'who', 'film', 'justifiably', 'dedicated', 'even', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'smug', 'act', ""'ve"", 'tired', 'lately', 'gamely', 'own', 'scenes', 'Newman.The', 'misses', 'include', 'Dylan', 'Walsh', 'Sully', 'son', 'antipathy', 'performance', 'may', 'come', 'fact', 'Peter', 'was', 'darker', 'smarter', 'character', 'book', 'more', 'akin', 'old', 'man', 'Walsh', 'Peter', 'more', 'bland', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'fully', 'formed', 'yet', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'prettiest', 'most', 'put-upon', 'girl', 'town', 'caught', 'once', 'twice', 'delivering', 'lines', 'rather', 'inhabiting', 'character', 'sin', 'amplified', 'when', 'compared', 'Newman', 'perfect', 'ease', 'speech', 'Thankfully', 'sub-par', 'performance', 'harmed', 'film', 'overall', 'effect', 'way.Director/Writer', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'fine', 'job', 'collating', 'Richard', 'Russo', 'novel', 'cohesive', 'movie', 'novel', 'filmed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'days', 'long', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'texture', 'there', 'Benton', 'combine', 'storylines', 'excise', 'others', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'needed', 'still', 'maintain', 'tone', 'flavour', 'book', 'estimation', 'what', 'was', 'monumental', 'task', 'feels', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'relative', 'ease', 'know', 'not', 'case', 'hard', 'work', 'went', 'story', 'deconstruction', 'am', 'glad', 'member', 'audience', 'way.Just', 'source', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'several', 'occasions', 'tear', 'up', 'several', 'others', 'rest', 'time', 'left', 'happy', 'grin', 'awe', 'what', 'was', 'seeing']",Nobody's Fool VHS

Set between Thanksgiving and New Year in snowy upstate NY, the film could be a part of your holiday film library.Plot:  Paul Newman is Donald Sullivan, a 60-year-old odd-job man in a small, hardscrabble town.  His tangled web of relationships with sometime employer Bruce Willis, landlady Jessica Tandy, and a host of colorful locals slowly emerges and it turns out that na'er-do-well Sully actually is a vital component of his community.Acting:  Just superb.  Newman is at his best and in her final role, Tandy is brilliant.  Willis, Melanie Griffith and Pruitt Taylor Vince is full of pathos as best friend Rub Squeers.  The supporting cast is also scintillating.  Of special note is an early role for Capote star Philip Seymour Hoffman, as local police bumpkin Werner.Best Feature:  The script-- the Newman-Tandy repartee is great and the Newman-Willis dialogue just crackles.  There are enough memorable lines to make you want to take notes.Also of note:  Good cinematography lends an authentic ambience and the semi-Celtic soundtrack is pleasant without being manipulative.Reviewer note:  I grew up in the area where this movie was filmed.

I knew that Paul Newman would not appear in anything less than first class so I chose to watch it, knowing I wouldn't be disappointed.  I enjoyed every moment, mostly because of the incomparable presence of this eternally attractive man.  The rest of the cast was first rate, too.  I was pleasantly surprised by Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith and especially by Jessica Tandy (whom I rather disliked in Driving Miss Daisy).I found the reviews of people who had read the book helpful and that probably explains why I failed to give this five stars.  They said that the book is darker and that this is a more Hollywood-ized version of it.  I did think that Newman's character was almost too cute and charming in the beginning.  He wins our hearts in the first scene, when I think the darker elements of his personality should have been portrayed. And he looks so good--perfect teeth and skin and hair and wears really nice clean plaid shirts in lovely colors.  I think that the ""real"" Sully, would have looked a lot more beat-up--like his pick up. Then we would have journeyed with him in the transformation process that the film shows.  It's too slick and quick and easy here.  Only the anger of the son showed the extent of the pain that Newman's character inflicted on him.I wondered, too, about the relationship of Sully to the Melanie Griffith character, which, the film treats in a very light-hearted way, that doesn't completely justify the ending.  I suspect that there was more to it in the book.

378415,A1WBXDI7LRPLXB,6303507689,R. Sohi,"[8, 9]","I watched ""Nobody's Fool"" for the third time last Christmas Eve, the difference being that this time I had just read Richard Russo's excellent novel of the same name. Robert Benton has done a brilliant job of adapting the source material, capturing the tone and essence of the story, while compressing 549 pages of text into 110 minutes of screen time. The film, set in North Bath, a faded little town in upstate New York, follows 60 year old Sully (played by Paul Newman), who is described in the novel as ""just a lonely, stubborn, unlucky man,"" between Thanksgiving and Christmas as he works to stay afloat with a bum knee, few prospects and ""a stupid streak"" looming ahead.In the film some of the background stories have been trimmed out but are often hinted at through a comment or the action. In one scene, which is changed from the novel, Sully is in the abandoned house of his long deceased father and Newman is able to convey much of the pain associated with that physical space just through a subtle change in his facial expression. This scene vividly illustrates the strengths of Benton's adaptation - he trusts the audience's intelligence and uses the cinematic medium to tell the story. A lesser filmmaker would have used the novel's technique of inserting a flashback from Sully's childhood into the scene.Benton's film lightens the darkness and desperation of Sully's life as it's presented in the novel, choosing instead to put greater emphasis on the humour that is also a major strength of the book.  The change in tone in some cases is also accompanied by a change in plot development. At times this variation from the novel is not entirely successful.  For instance, the film's depiction of the unfolding of Sully's relationship with Toby Roebuck (played by Melanie Griffith) seems less realistic than the way it's presented in Russo's book.  The novel is able to achieve this aim, however, by taking the time to devolop the character of Sully's son, Peter, significantly more.  But this is a minor quibble. The film compensates for this easily overlooked flaw through the many other pleasures it delivers, foremost among them the presentation of some very three dimensional characters.The film is very well cast - I can't imagine anybody but Newman playing Sully, Jessica Tandy playing Beryl Peoples, Bruce Willis playing Carl Roebuck, Griffith playing Toby Roebuck and especially, Pruitt Taylor Vince playing Rub Squeers.""Nobody's Fool"" is one of the underrated gems of the 1990s and I would strongly recommend it.  It's also a superb adaptation of an equally great novel.  Hopefully, for some viewers watching the film will lead to a wish to become more deeply immersed into its world by also reading Russo's book.",4,Nobody's Fool - a review of the film after reading the novel,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,2736,"['watched', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'third', 'time', 'last', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'difference', 'being', 'time', 'had', 'just', 'read', 'Richard', 'Russo', 'excellent', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'done', 'brilliant', 'job', 'adapting', 'source', 'material', 'capturing', 'tone', 'essence', 'story', 'compressing', '549', 'pages', 'text', '110', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'film', 'set', 'North', 'Bath', 'faded', 'little', 'town', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', '60', 'year', 'old', 'Sully', 'played', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'who', 'described', 'novel', 'just', 'lonely', 'stubborn', 'unlucky', 'man', 'Thanksgiving', 'Christmas', 'stay', 'afloat', 'bum', 'knee', 'few', 'prospects', 'stupid', 'streak', 'looming', 'film', 'background', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'out', 'are', 'often', 'hinted', 'comment', 'action', 'one', 'scene', 'changed', 'novel', 'Sully', 'abandoned', 'house', 'long', 'deceased', 'father', 'Newman', 'able', 'convey', 'much', 'pain', 'associated', 'physical', 'space', 'just', 'subtle', 'change', 'facial', 'expression', 'scene', 'vividly', 'strengths', 'Benton', 'adaptation', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'cinematic', 'medium', 'tell', 'story', 'lesser', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'novel', 'technique', 'inserting', 'flashback', 'Sully', 'childhood', 'scene.Benton', 'film', 'darkness', 'desperation', 'Sully', 'life', 'presented', 'novel', 'choosing', 'instead', 'put', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'humour', 'also', 'major', 'strength', 'book', 'change', 'tone', 'cases', 'also', 'accompanied', 'change', 'plot', 'development', 'times', 'variation', 'novel', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'instance', 'film', 'depiction', 'unfolding', 'Sully', 'relationship', 'Toby', 'Roebuck', 'played', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'less', 'realistic', 'way', 'presented', 'Russo', 'book', 'novel', 'able', 'achieve', 'aim', 'however', 'taking', 'time', 'devolop', 'character', 'Sully', 'son', 'Peter', 'significantly', 'more', 'minor', 'quibble', 'film', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'flaw', 'many', 'other', 'pleasures', 'foremost', 'presentation', 'very', 'three', 'dimensional', 'characters.The', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anybody', 'Newman', 'playing', 'Sully', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'playing', 'Beryl', 'Peoples', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'playing', 'Carl', 'Roebuck', 'Griffith', 'playing', 'Toby', 'Roebuck', 'especially', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'playing', 'Rub', 'Squeers', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'one', 'underrated', 'gems', '1990s', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'also', 'superb', 'adaptation', 'equally', 'great', 'novel', 'Hopefully', 'viewers', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'lead', 'wish', 'become', 'more', 'deeply', 'immersed', 'world', 'also', 'reading', 'Russo', 'book']",Nobody's Fool VHS
