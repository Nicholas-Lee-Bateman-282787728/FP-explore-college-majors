My UK VHS copy needed replacement and I was pleased to find that a DVD replacement was available. All the elements remain. This is not a version for young children. It's violent, graphic and has a lot of swearing. This is a style of animation and dubbing that you just don't find anymore. It's a shame that this has gone away as anime has become more popular in the US. To me it fits with Jin Roh and Cyber City Oedo 808 and these are gems amongst the drangon ball dross.When I review things I prefer not to spoil the plot but if you really need to know what happens before you see it check out the wikipedia entry, it's quite good. The last few minutes of the final disk are a bit weak with a couple of vital things unexplained. You might also find the plot somewhat familiar especially if you've seen the Ghost in the Shell series.

432216,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,630468682X,coopertex,"[9, 11]","Angel cop started well enough, to keep me watching each episode to the last. Much of the story seemed like a action story with shootings, car chases, and plenty of explosions. Then the anime took a supernatural twist with the telepaths, teleporters and firestarter, and the showdowns against Lucifer. Lucifer was too powerful she had the ability to levitate herself, people and objects and killed anyone with her grip. Many of the scenes were very gruesome, with blood splatters, guts and lots of profanity to boot.  I understood what the creators were doing when they named characters Angel and Lucifer. I knew they were trying to convey their own version of the world apocalypse. They conveyed this well by making Lucifer almost invincible and very sadistic. In one scene she ripped a woman in half and a man was reduced to a pulp of blood. In another scene she got shot in the head and had her arm ripped off, but she healed herself and grew a new arm. The animation and character design was excellent though a bit outdated by todays standards. The sound effects were good, but sometimes a bit subdued and drowned out by the odd music. An Epic battle contained in a six episode series with pretty good action. I must comment that the english dubbing sucked. For adults only. All episodes continued. Ends on episode 6.

Either way, I was very impressed when I saw this about 8 or 9 years ago. But I had already seen some of the greats as far as Anime goes. Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, Devil Man, Evangelion. This was a great addition to those.One thing I really love about ANGEL COP was the realism of it all. It's animated, yet, there's no over exageration with comedy like huge sweat dripping down a characters forhead. No ones face suddenly goes blank or changes. It's done in a realistic way along the lines of Crying Freeman, Street Fighter, Ghost in the Shell etc.This is must have for any fan of SERIOUS animation. Meaning that it's adult and mature, but not at all pornographic. Just a good movie with action for ""guys who like movies"" as TNT would say.The reason I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 is because there were some parts that the animation was really well done and others where the animation was not as well as it could have been.Overall, great flick!!",5,Real Anime that's hard and gritty!!

432221,A25AF2BI2P5B14,630468682X,Lars Kingbeard,"[2, 2]","This anime features beautiful animation, tons of gore, and profanity like only a late 80's early 90's anime could. Its a non-stop thrill ride that crams more action and intensity into six episodes than most shows do in thirty, or 60, or ever. Each episode is a compact little gem of twists and turns and carefully choreagraphed violence. The drawing is at times fantastic and there are quite a few memorable shots such as that of the female psychic, lucifer, perched sideways on a wheeless chopper as it balances just above the crest of an incoming tsunami.There are a couple drawbacks to the series and the dvd. First, the animation quality is noticeably uneven, particularly in the climactic episode six. Here the drawing style abruptly becomes much simpler and the faces frequently take on an odd genial cast that is completely at odds with the situation. The frame rate also drops and there are numerous anatomical and facial distortions. Apparently, it took over 5 years for the six episodes to be completed in Japan, and each one features a different director who brought a slightly, or in the case of episode 6 dramatically, different approach to the animation. Arguably, the story and characters could also have used more time to develop, and some people may consider this a flaw as well.The other big drawback here concerns the terrible dvd transfer by manga video. Its not the worst I've ever seen (that would be Amon Saga, also from manga), but its pretty bad. Clearly, manga transferred this show directly from vhs and it features the screen jitter and color distortion you would expect, and even goes so far as to include the old advertisements for the individual vhs episodes during the closing credits.Despite the flaws, Angel Cop remains a classic from anime's bygone golden age. Its combination of intense action, ultraviolence, cyberpunk, and impeccable drawing is something that you rarely if ever see in modern shows.

It's very standard in terms of animation and setting. The plot, concerning big corporate bad guys, futuristic cops, and weird ghost people, couldn't be more convoluted or full of holes. But it's the action that holds up the movie and gets it its 3 1/2 out of 5 from me. The characters are almost entirely forgettable, but developing characters isn't the movie's mission.

They stop the terrorists,  but then find out that they are just a cover-up for a branch of government  accepting money from an American company to dump waste in the rural regions  of Japan.  That is the background of the story.  When watching this movie,  be sure to pay attention.

The thing that made me finally  decide to give it a chance was the length and at that time I was buying  anime based on length hoping to get more for my money which is definately  not a recommended strategy for purchasing anime. I was extermely lucky with  this one.This is one of the best cop shows in all of anime. There is  plenty of story, action, violence, profanity, and interesting characters to  satisfy any action-junkie.  Also Angel's ride was pretty phat!The  drawback is the dubbing.  It wasn't all that great. Some people did some  extremely bad acting and when other people cursed it sounded  forced.Based on the amount of graphic violence, strong language, and  nudity I would recommend this to mature viewers 17 and up.",5,Best anime Cop show,957484800,"05 5, 2000",2000,1219,"['kind', 'strange', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'Angel', 'cop', 'collection', 'had', 'seen', 'commerical', 'once', 'showed', 'Angel', 'taking', 'helmet', 'over', 'again', 'partner', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'new', 'partner', 'was', 'tough', 'female', 'cop', 'Angel', 'seeing', 'cheesy', 'commerical', 'thought', 'something', 'definately', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'Later', 'saw', 'review', 'series', 'anime', 'magazine', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'enough', 'thing', 'made', 'finally', 'decide', 'give', 'chance', 'was', 'length', 'time', 'was', 'buying', 'anime', 'based', 'length', 'hoping', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'definately', 'not', 'recommended', 'strategy', 'purchasing', 'anime', 'was', 'extermely', 'lucky', 'one.This', 'one', 'best', 'cop', 'shows', 'anime', 'plenty', 'story', 'action', 'violence', 'profanity', 'interesting', 'characters', 'satisfy', 'action-junkie', 'Also', 'Angel', 'ride', 'was', 'pretty', 'phat', 'drawback', 'dubbing', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'people', 'did', 'extremely', 'bad', 'acting', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'cursed', 'sounded', 'forced.Based', 'amount', 'graphic', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'nudity', 'would', 'recommend', 'mature', 'viewers', '17', 'up']",Angel Cop: Collection VHS
