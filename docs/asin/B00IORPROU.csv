Although, there are the similarities of other dinosaur movies, this one did add some originality and I will give credit for that.  Movies seem to be cranking out a fast pace as a means to have something produced.  I do not like giving out a lot of details when I give my opinion, so here goes.I liked the dinosaur, it was original as it was a hybrid.  I thought it funny to watch as usual all of the shooting with flash bang but you never see any damage or rounds hitting anything.  Why is it that the bad guys are intellectually challenged?  How do you become the leader of anything with no common or street sense?  So, you will get a laugh at how they are killed off.  Sometimes I wonder if any thought is put into some of the smaller creatures.  Scientists are making basic stupid mistakes, you will know what is going to happen.  Then to see something just born grow super fast and already vicious and impervious to anything.  There is the typical mating scene, you know sex has to be squeezed in there somehow.  I never understand how it is to be believed that people in real danger decides sex is more important than life?So it's entertaining and a couple of surprises, if you are bored with nothing to do.

Bad actors acting badly showcase this mad scientist has heart attack and his experiment gets loose cold duck. Flat characters with sufficient stereotyping of goth girls, native American princess, mad scientist and stupid FBI agents add to the cast of characters.Pluses, the starring heroine is a lovely healthy young woman who was also the best actor that carried the rest of the cast.

The software and the computer workstations must be getting better.Minuses, the character actors really were not A listers. The shallow characters were a lot like incompetent Scooby-Doo college kids without the dog to do the dirty work.Predictable and without a gripping plot, (other than we all ran out of gas in this tiny podunk town at the same time) these teens get chomped, ripped and torn to pieces by dinosaurs.No sense of comic relief as each character is eaten.

Ludicrous plotline, over the top characters, low budget cgi effects, and a song and dance finale!  On top of that we get a mad dr. with a heart problem, and a restaurant that serves squirrel and possum, and Lorenzo Lamas showing up for a morning's worth of work so they could get a &#34;name&#34; on the credits.  and did I mention that because of all this I absolutely LOVED this movie.  Decent practical effects as well as cgi (I even think I saw some stop motion in there!), a good sense of fun about the proceedings (check out the mailbox of the house next door to the dino farm), and enough campiness and heart to keep me watching through the whole thing.  The film goes a little closer to Troma than the Asylum, and its attitude was refreshing from the norm.  Just get ready to have as much fun as the actors and crew must have had!!
