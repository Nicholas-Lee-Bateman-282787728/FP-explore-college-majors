This movie didn't have the usual fun music or any dancing, either. My daughter also thought their clothes weren't very pretty.

My three-year-old loves horses and for her, nothing  could be better than watching Barbie ride. In this move, Barbie and the girls visit their aunt at their riding academy. Some of them excel at riding right away while others find it a little challenging, but they all work through their issues and not only learn to ride but to treat the animals with respect.Since Barbie is the oldest, she is able to go out riding on her own. One day she gets into trouble and is almost attacked by wolves and a beautiful wild mare saves her. Later she returns the favor. The two of them develop a friendship and she starts to train the horse. In the meantime, Skipper learns her aunt is in danger of losing the riding academy to a rival family who wants to capture the beautiful wild horses and break them. Barbie has two very good reasons to enter the race that could save her aunt's school, but it won't be as easy as she thinks when not everyone is playing fair.My family and I really enjoyed watching this film together. Like all the Barbies movies, it offers a interesting storyline with a moral but also has fun songs and characters little girls can really relate to.

Barbie Perfect Christmas reminds us that just being together is most important at Christmas. Barbie Pink Shoes is about believing in yourself and has beautiful costumes and original story with classic ballet. We love the first person walk through scenery of Wii Barbie Horse Adventures. The grooming and horse care was helpful in remembering the needs of the horse. Swan Lake was beautiful and true to the original story, as was Barbie Nutcracker. Fashion Fairytale showed sweet, funny Ken's true love for Barbie by how much he is willing to go through to be reunited with her. We love the scenery and virtue of Barbie in the Mermaidia and Fairytopia series, though the villains are tiresome. Barbie is a great choice for teaching caring for others, fairness, and loving yourself.

Barbie is back with a new adventure, this time at a horse-riding academy in Switzerland, and she's bringing her sisters; Skipper, Stacie and Chelsea along for the fun!Set against some breathtaking alpine scenery, Barbie and company embark on a series of entertaining adventures; each contributing their own special skills, personalities and a lot of fun humor to the story, thanks to some sharp writing from the largely new creative team behind the film.As with any movie with a plot, there is a bad guy; out to put the Alpine Riding Academy out of business and find and exploit the mythical herd of 'Majestique' horses dwelling on the Academy's land. But his story line is largely comical and not too intrusive; it's just enough to keep the film moving forward. The real strength in the story comes from Barbie's befriending one of the elusive horses when it rescues her from a pack of wolves; a favor that is later returned when Barbie frees the horse trapped and injured by a rock slide.The other sisters, each with their own subplot, complete the picture when each of their stories culminate seamlessly into the final outcome; saving the academy from the designs of the Phillipe, the villain of the piece, and return it to prosperity.At the center of the story is a good message of respecting others; in this case, the sisters learn that horseback riding is a mutual effort between them and their steed, and that they must learn to respect the personalities and intelligence their animals. Even Barbie, whose intentions were to adopt her Majestique horse and bring her home to Malibu (not too unlike the villain who wanted to capture and break the great horses for his own gains) ultimately makes the right decision and fulfills the movie's message of ""If you love something, set it free.""The animation is bright and colorful with some nice directorial touches, gorgeous scenery, and of course the girls maintain a tasteful, stylish fashion sense throughout. Even the peripheral characters are well written and original, rounding out an entertaining cast. This is a great movie that I strongly recommend for anyone who loves Barbie, horses and well-made entertainment for all ages.
