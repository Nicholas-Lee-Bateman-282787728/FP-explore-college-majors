The shows are consistenly good - unlike some westerns that dropped into self-satire, losing their atmosphere.  Cheyenne Brodie can crack a smile, but you won't find big red shoes and a silly nose in any episode.  My father and I watch westerns all the time, and look forward to the quality of these shows.
