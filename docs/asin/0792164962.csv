131556,AGH5RJDNL7TAZ,0792164962,,"[6, 21]","As Aristotle himself said, drama is only supposed to ""imitate"" real life.  Some of our greatest movies, plays and books pivot on an improbable coincidence, which allows the characters to realize their destinies in an efficient way for the audience.  Fine.  But does there ever come a point where you have too many coincidences?  ""The Firm"" is an excellent case study.  Let's see...--It so happens that Cruise's character has a brother in prison.  As I recall, it's a federal facility, which is important because the FBI is involved.--Also, even though we've established that ""the firm"" tracks every move made by its associates and partners, somehow the fact of Cruise's brother's imprisonment escapes them. However, we later find out that the firm has a source inside the very same prison.-- It so happens that Gene Hackman's character develops a crush on Cruise's wife.  This is important because she is needed to distract him long enough to allow some documents to be copied.  It is even more important because Hackman's tenderhearted fondness for her saves her life...while costing him his own.--It also so happens that this firm that tries so hard to keep a low profile so it can act as the mob's law firm engages in tawdry overbilling of clients.  This is important because it is a crime that Cruise's character does not commit, so he won't have to plead guilty as a cooperating witness, and won't be disbarred.  Despite being a brilliant law student, Cruise does not recognize it is a federal crime until this is explained to him by a p-d off client.--It also so happens that the mob boss decides at a crucial time to make a personal visit to Memphis, even though there is no real reason for him to do so; in fact, it's probably a reckless decision.  This is important because only by addressing the capo di tutti capo in person can Cruise save himself from assassination.All these coincidences happen, and perhaps a few more I overlooked.  Without them, the story could not turn out like it does.  Then throw in the normal superhuman attributes given to both the villains and the hero.  For example, the paid assassin manages to outrun a tram over a course of at least a mile, and is not winded, even though he does not appear to be an athlete. Cruise's wife knows how to slip Gene Hackman an effective mickey, even though up til now, her life experience is as a schoolteacher.This movie (like the book) is sold to audiences because the basic premise is so creepy, and yet plausible.  But then they have to get Cruise out of the firm, alive and kicking, and they couldn't figure out how to do it and have it make any sense.

The movie lapses further into elementary land.While Mitch was often a silent partner in the story, at least he wasn't perfect.

No matter how good the story, you can hardly help  that your attention starts slipping halfway. Even so, the last thirty  minutes are suspenseful enough, that it makes for a real climax.

Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","I finished seeing this film last night for the second time since 2004 and the third time since it was originally released into theatres. Overall I quite liked this film. The characters and the characters' motivations were done quite well. According to wikipedia some of these motivations were changed from what is contained in the book. I plan to read the book at some point so as to get more depth of characterization. Since the movie's release in 1993 it integrates fairly well into 2013 society. It is not too dated if you ask me, which is one of the things I look for in older (But Not Too Old) movies.Roger Ebert gave the film Four Stars out of Four. I give it Four out of Five Stars. I did not like the change from the book where Mitch reveals his affair to his wife. In real life no man would ever do that! Unless confronted with irrefutable evidence (The Pictures), no man would risk admitting to an affair! All it would do is hurt the woman. American women have fragile egos, and nothing would be gained by him telling her this. Grisham realized this when he wrote the book. A stupid Hollywood screenwriter wanted to mix sentimentality into the script thereby creating a love triangle between Avery Tolar and Mitch and Abigail McDeere. Stupid. I deducted a Star from an otherwise solid movie.Tom Cruise is an athlete! Even today he can run. Back then he sprinted faster than Jerry Rice of the 49ers! I can honestly see him outrunning those pursuers at the end of the movie. Wilfred Brimely was a joke! There is no way he could have run with or fought Tom Cruise's character without a gun. His character got pummeled by McDeere and that was the most realistic part of the movie. Had I been Cruise (In The Basement Scene) I'd have collected all of the guns and using Nordic Man's silencer, but a bullet into both their heads.There are no extras on this DVD, but that is Okay as far as I'm concerned.

131566,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792164962,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Legal thrillers rarely satisfy me.  It takes a really strong one to peak my interest, hold it and keep me remembering it long after it's through.  I guess I just never warmed up to them the way that a lot of movie goers have.  That, coupled with the Tom Cruise bug, has kept me away from `The Firm' for some time.  I adore Holly Hunter, and her Oscar nomination did make me curious, but as a whole I just wasn't that interested in giving this film a try.It came on television the other day though, and I had nothing better to do, so I bit.That said, `The Firm' was actually pretty well done.  It was intense when it needed to be, and it contained enough plot twists to keep me interested even after I figured everything out.  I will say that some of the plot developments felt a little sticky, especially once Abby and Tammy go all sorts of espionage on the firm, but that aside, the film is quite good.The film follows Mitch McDeere, a bright lawyer who is being wooed by a prestigious law firm that seems to watch to control everyone around them.  Mitch's wife Abby is turned off by this, but Mitch's enthusiasm for the firm and his potential working there outweighs her concerns.  Mitch is taken under the wing of Avery Tolar, shown the ropes and given all the perks, and then there is a murder, and then the FBI comes looking for Mitch, to turn him, and he gets an earful, and he starts to dig around and soon all the pieces start to fit together and Mitch realizes that this prestigious firm has some very unorthodox practices that could threaten his marriage, his profession and ultimately his life.I have never felt Tom Cruise was as talented as he is made out to be.  Yes, when he hits it he usually leaves a lasting impression (um, he was all kinds of stellar in `Eyes Wide Shut' and he was definitely Oscar worthy in `Jerry Maguire') but for the most part he is either outshone by the rest of the cast (as in `Rain Man') or simply not that impressive (I need to rewatch `Top Gun' but I do remember being less than impressed with Cruise).  Here he is actually pretty good.  He holds his own alongside Hackman (which is hard to do) and delivers a believable and relatable performance.He's not best-in-show though.`The Firm' is littered with actors doing their best to grab out attention.  The most successful would have to be Holly Hunter who just breezes though her performance as if it were effortless for her.  She is witty and charismatic and adorable to boot; and when she wants to lay on the drama she can and does so brilliantly.  Gene Hackman is also on the top of his game; sly and cunning and very approachable which only adds layers to his characters mystery.  Hal Holbrook is ruthless as Oliver Lambert and commands in his few scenes.  David Strathairn is commanding if not a little out of place here (I really didn't like his characters arc, but whatever).  Jeanne Tripplehorn gets better and better as the film progresses.  I think that Ed Harris is a pretty good actor, but he seems wasted here in my opinion.In the end I must say that `The Firm' is a far better film than I expected it to be.  No, it is not a favorite of mine (based on genre alone really) but it manages to be memorable and exciting and I will watch it again, I'm sure of that.  I wish that they had cleaned up the ending a tad, for as the plot keeps twisting the film gets a little messy, but that messiness makes for an entertaining roller coaster that serves it purpose.",4,"It gets a little messy towards the end, but it's still nothing short of exciting...",1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,3465,"['Legal', 'thrillers', 'rarely', 'satisfy', 'really', 'strong', 'one', 'peak', 'interest', 'hold', 'keep', 'remembering', 'long', 'guess', 'just', 'never', 'warmed', 'up', 'way', 'lot', 'movie', 'goers', 'have', 'coupled', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'bug', 'kept', 'away', 'Firm', 'time', 'adore', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'did', 'make', 'curious', 'whole', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'interested', 'giving', 'film', 'try.It', 'came', 'television', 'other', 'day', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'bit.That', 'said', 'Firm', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'intense', 'when', 'needed', 'be', 'contained', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'interested', 'even', 'figured', 'everything', 'out', 'will', 'say', 'plot', 'developments', 'felt', 'little', 'sticky', 'especially', 'once', 'Abby', 'Tammy', 'go', 'sorts', 'espionage', 'firm', 'aside', 'film', 'quite', 'good.The', 'film', 'Mitch', 'McDeere', 'bright', 'lawyer', 'who', 'being', 'wooed', 'prestigious', 'law', 'firm', 'watch', 'control', 'everyone', 'Mitch', 'wife', 'Abby', 'turned', 'off', 'Mitch', 'enthusiasm', 'firm', 'potential', 'working', 'there', 'concerns', 'Mitch', 'taken', 'wing', 'Avery', 'Tolar', 'shown', 'ropes', 'given', 'perks', 'then', 'murder', 'then', 'FBI', 'looking', 'Mitch', 'turn', 'earful', 'dig', 'soon', 'pieces', 'start', 'fit', 'together', 'Mitch', 'prestigious', 'firm', 'very', 'unorthodox', 'practices', 'could', 'threaten', 'marriage', 'profession', 'ultimately', 'life.I', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'as', 'talented', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Yes', 'when', 'usually', 'lasting', 'impression', 'um', 'was', 'kinds', 'stellar', 'Eyes', 'Shut', 'was', 'definitely', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'most', 'part', 'outshone', 'rest', 'cast', 'Rain', 'Man', 'simply', 'not', 'impressive', 'need', 'rewatch', 'Top', 'Gun', 'do', 'remember', 'being', 'less', 'impressed', 'Cruise', 'Here', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'own', 'alongside', 'Hackman', 'hard', 'do', 'believable', 'relatable', 'performance.He', 'not', 'best-in-show', 'though.', 'Firm', 'littered', 'actors', 'doing', 'best', 'grab', 'out', 'attention', 'most', 'successful', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'who', 'just', 'performance', 'were', 'effortless', 'witty', 'charismatic', 'adorable', 'boot', 'when', 'lay', 'drama', 'can', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'also', 'top', 'game', 'sly', 'cunning', 'very', 'approachable', 'only', 'layers', 'characters', 'mystery', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'ruthless', 'Oliver', 'Lambert', 'commands', 'few', 'scenes', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'commanding', 'not', 'little', 'place', 'here', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'characters', 'arc', 'whatever', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'better', 'better', 'film', 'think', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'wasted', 'here', 'opinion.In', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'Firm', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'expected', 'be', 'No', 'not', 'favorite', 'mine', 'based', 'genre', 'alone', 'really', 'be', 'memorable', 'exciting', 'will', 'watch', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wish', 'had', 'cleaned', 'up', 'ending', 'tad', 'plot', 'twisting', 'film', 'little', 'messy', 'messiness', 'entertaining', 'roller', 'coaster', 'purpose']",N/A

131569,A2AOUHBZ1HXO5D,0792164962,Avantel,"[4, 6]","The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie.Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life.  At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham.The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into.Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes.Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE.

So now we have half a dozen Grisham movies. What they have in common is that I loved them all, and will find it hard to assign stars. This one will probably get the fewest. In this case, they made the one unforgivable error in turning the book into a movie: they changed the outcome. Not just the ending scenes, but the consequent outcome of all that had gone before. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie.Tom Cruise was right for the part of Mitch, the young lawyer who gets good enough grades in law school to be courted by some really good firms. But one in particular is rolling out a large red carpet for him and his pretty wife. Too large. Wife is somewhat suspicious, but Mitch just thinks it's because he's one hot shot lawyer. Sorry, Mitch.The firm is working for some very shady people, and Mitch discovers just how shady in the course of his work. So his loyalty to the fat bank account and to his professional ethics are brought into conflict quite early on. But he really is a very clever young man, so he has a very clever solution to the dilemma. Wife and others get involved in ways that would spoil the plot if I told you. Keep your eye on the investigator and his secretary.If you read the book, you still don't know how it comes out, so I will say no more, except to say that I liked the book ending a whole lot better.

Being a decent guy in Hollywood makes a difference. Look at who he got to help with the script: David Rabe and Robert Towne. Look at the cast: Tom Cruise, as might be expected for a screen adaptation of a bestselling book that had obsessed America in the early 90s, but look who else: Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Holly Hunter, Wilford Brimley, David Strathairn, Gary Busey, Ed Harris, and probably a few others I'm forgetting about. This movie is all about the cast -- they're the ones who make it a worthwhile watch.For the plot is an overheated potboiler that wearies us with too many twists, too many correct assumptions of others' behavior (like, for example, the way Cruise and Hunter just know Harris as the FBI officer will say something that could expose himself to ethics charges, which is why they're secretly recording him), and too much frantic running around, generally speaking. Lawyers are afraid of jail: it's flat-out impossible that 41 ""partners"" would acquiesce to working for a law firm whose raison d'etre is laundering money for the Mob. Wilford Brimley would have to send his albino hitman to kill 41 people in real life. That's a lot of oatmeal.Grisham would go on to write more realistic plots around the legal profession (""The Rainmaker"" comes immediately to mind), which would consequently result in better movies (like, well, ""The Rainmaker""). Good script-writers and directors, like Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman, would be seduced by such courtroom dramas, a genre that is one of cinema's naturally best ""fits"". But here it's mostly absurdity: Cruise playing the murderous Firm, the FBI, and the Mob all against each other, with the help of a few misfits that include an estranged wife. Hooray for Hollywood, I guess. One thing dropped too soon in the plot machinations, though, is Grisham's point about how the most upper-crust law firms do in fact expect a certain biography to be lived up to from its associates, a biography that goes far beyond successful matriculation at Ivy League law schools. The paucity of women in such firms is still sadly true today -- the good old boys can't really relax and be themselves around female colleagues. The preferred prospect is just what we see here: an ambitious young man with a wife who won't be too terribly career-oriented herself. Presumably she will be satisfied with the various charity opportunities afforded her by a life of luxurious indolence. The attitude was antiquated 20 years ago when this film was made, and it's more antiquated now. It also happens to still exist in such spheres.Anyway, the performances drive the picture. Of particular note are Tripplehorn and Hackman. The corrupt roue instantly recognizes a powerful woman in Tripplehorn, and she in turn is a little disgusted and more than a little compelled by the man's fundamental sadness, such complications doubtlessly offering a more interesting time for her than what Cruise gives her, which is mostly standing there breathing through his open mouth. 3 out of 5.",3,Super-Lawyer to the rescue,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,3228,"['late', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'folks', 'industry', 'catalog', 'director', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'impressive', 'Firm', 'representative', 'Being', 'decent', 'guy', 'Hollywood', 'difference', 'Look', 'who', 'got', 'help', 'script', 'David', 'Rabe', 'Robert', 'Towne', 'Look', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'bestselling', 'book', 'had', 'obsessed', 'America', 'early', '90s', 'look', 'who', 'else', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'probably', 'few', 'others', ""'m"", 'forgetting', 'about', 'movie', 'cast', ""'re"", 'ones', 'who', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'watch.For', 'plot', 'overheated', 'potboiler', 'too', 'many', 'twists', 'too', 'many', 'correct', 'assumptions', 'others', 'behavior', 'example', 'way', 'Cruise', 'Hunter', 'just', 'know', 'Harris', 'FBI', 'officer', 'will', 'say', 'something', 'could', 'expose', 'ethics', 'charges', 'why', ""'re"", 'secretly', 'recording', 'too', 'much', 'frantic', 'running', 'around', 'generally', 'speaking', 'Lawyers', 'are', 'afraid', 'jail', 'flat-out', 'impossible', '41', 'partners', 'would', 'acquiesce', 'working', 'law', 'firm', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'laundering', 'money', 'Mob', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'would', 'have', 'send', 'albino', 'hitman', 'kill', '41', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'lot', 'oatmeal.Grisham', 'would', 'go', 'write', 'more', 'realistic', 'plots', 'legal', 'profession', 'Rainmaker', 'immediately', 'mind', 'would', 'consequently', 'result', 'better', 'movies', 'well', 'Rainmaker', 'Good', 'script-writers', 'directors', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'would', 'be', 'seduced', 'such', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'genre', 'one', 'cinema', 'naturally', 'best', 'fits', 'here', 'mostly', 'absurdity', 'Cruise', 'playing', 'murderous', 'Firm', 'FBI', 'Mob', 'other', 'help', 'few', 'misfits', 'include', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Hooray', 'Hollywood', 'guess', 'One', 'thing', 'dropped', 'too', 'soon', 'plot', 'machinations', 'Grisham', 'point', 'how', 'most', 'upper-crust', 'law', 'firms', 'do', 'fact', 'expect', 'certain', 'biography', 'be', 'lived', 'up', 'associates', 'biography', 'far', 'successful', 'matriculation', 'Ivy', 'League', 'law', 'schools', 'paucity', 'women', 'such', 'firms', 'still', 'sadly', 'true', 'today', 'good', 'old', 'boys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'relax', 'be', 'female', 'colleagues', 'preferred', 'prospect', 'just', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'wife', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'terribly', 'career-oriented', 'Presumably', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'various', 'charity', 'opportunities', 'afforded', 'life', 'luxurious', 'indolence', 'attitude', 'was', 'antiquated', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'antiquated', 'now', 'also', 'still', 'exist', 'such', 'spheres.Anyway', 'performances', 'drive', 'picture', 'particular', 'note', 'are', 'Tripplehorn', 'Hackman', 'corrupt', 'roue', 'instantly', 'powerful', 'woman', 'Tripplehorn', 'turn', 'little', 'disgusted', 'more', 'little', 'compelled', 'man', 'fundamental', 'sadness', 'such', 'complications', 'doubtlessly', 'offering', 'more', 'interesting', 'time', 'what', 'Cruise', 'mostly', 'standing', 'there', 'breathing', 'open', 'mouth', '3', '5']",N/A

Cruise's character is arrogant, brash, and smug--as we would expect most young attorneys to be--but as his life unravels, as he learns more and more about the machinations of his employer, he's just darn fun to watch as he tries to distance himself from THE FIRM.One of the reasons Cruise is tolerable is because his surrounding cast is so outstanding.

Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) joins a relatively small but quite prestigious law firm in Memphis, headed by Oliver Lambert (Hal Holbrook) even though he hasn't yet passed his final bar exam. The firm offer him very attractive terms and make it clear that they want him a part of the team. He and his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) settle in and McDeere makes a good impression on his mentor in the firm, Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman). Eight weeks into his time with the firm, McDeere learns that two associates of the firm have been killed in a boating accident. Then a couple of guys from the FBI start taking an interest in him and McDeere learns that two others met with a similar fate a few years ago. This creates disquiet for the McDeeres. The FBI then make McDeere an offer that leaves him between a rock and a hard place. They want him to be a mole and report what goes on in the office, but if he decides to work with the FBI, his career is finished and he will have to relocate under the witness protection program. If Mitch doesn't cooperate with the FBI, then when they take down the firm, he will be indicted and serve a long prison sentence.McDeere decides to hire a P.I. Eddie Lomax (Gary Busey) to investigate the deaths of the associates, but before he can even get started, he is killed - which deepens McDeere's fears about the firm. McDeere's brother Ray (David Strathairn) is in jail but coming up for a parole hearing. So Mitch makes a deal with the FBI to get Ray out of jail in return for the incriminating files. From then on it's a race against time for Mitch to get hold of the files and Ray to get away before the firm's hoodlums catch up with him.

131620,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0792164962,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","Some would call that a legal thriller but that would be reducing it too much because there is little court action, in fact there is no court action. It is all about how you can fool the FBI, get your feet out of the rich mud in which they are and at the same time remain absolutely true to your oath as a lawyer when you were registered, sworn in to be more precise, to the local bar, here Memphis, Tennessee. But it is a very good film on one legal loophole in our society. A lawyer knows about the crimes of his clients and if these clients are criminals what can the lawyer do when he is under the menace of being killed if he stops doing his good job. That's the first interest of the film. Lawyers cannot because of their oath do anything and yet it is their legal duty to do something. So it will have to be like for Al Capone, a collateral problem that has nothing to do with the business of the client. That's the real loophole of our legal system. Everyone has the absolute legal obligation to report a crime they know about, except lawyers and priests, and that is immoral. A lawyer has to defend his client. An accused criminal has to be defended in court the best way possible. But hiding the crime you know about is not defending, it is concealing. Our society has some kind of a flaw there, and it goes back a long way. Is our justice really equal for all and just for all, victims and criminals alike? The second interest of the film is the super exploitation young lawyers can be the target or the victim of. They are bought by some legal firms with millions of money and merchandize just to be over exploited for a certain amount of time, for doing what they are asked to do, for keeping their mouth shut, including inside the firm, for being subservient servile servants of their older partners. The wives are demanded to be their wives and that's all, and that's hard enough, waiting for them at night when they work late, worrying, but not too much when there is something strange, caressing and cajoling the Dearies when they go through a difficult period, etc. This profession in this society is essentially misogynistic. What about women lawyers today? Then the film shows how the famous Cayman Islands were used in those days as a haven for business, crime, tax evasion, speculation, prostitution and many other options in evil doing. Finally it also shows how justice can be short-circuited by the simple system of ""parole"" and turned into a means to pressurize one person by paroling or not paroling another. The film is well built, full of resources, action too, and rather moral in the end, even if the main criminals will go on running, in that case the mafia and their lawyers. Our society is so hypocritical. Shedding crocodile tears all the time on the poor little poor people who suffer so much.

Many people have gone over the plot, so I won't do that here. Some say Cruise overacted, but his acting fit in perfectly with this movie that constantly went for the dramatic over the plausible. By the time the law firm made him an offer, I was expecting them to say something like, ""Ink means nothing to us, you must sign in blood!"" And that bit with him and the chick on the beach...hot, but otherwise. Anyway, where was I? Oh, yeah, the firm was acting like those pics would ruin his marriage. If someone had shown me pics like that of my hubby, I'd have given him a high five, as long as he didn't catch anything. (She's half way around the world, he didn't even know her name.) I'd laugh if I heard the story behind what happened. When the private investigator was shot in the ear, wouldn't he have shot back right away and not waited for a couple of more shots while they went through the ""You vill talk..."" routine? Those are a couple of examples of where I feel the movie went for the dramatic over the plausible. Another was the way the wife kept on getting all melodramatic because she felt she wasn't getting enough attention. Seems to me if you want a lot of attention from your husband, you shouldn't pick a lawyer just starting out at a major law firm. And the ending?

131640,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,0792164962,Larry Scantlebury,"[8, 11]","This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given ""evil empire"" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them?Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, ""McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!"")The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run.What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom?

My first impression: this movie is a bit overlong and contains some filler minutes which could have been avoided. Apart from that it is a good watch with really good performances.The cast is made up from excellent actors who all draw awesome pictures of their characters. Tom Cruise is a brilliant choice for Mitch, the young graduate lawyer who accepts the job offer of a little Memphis law firm which turns out to be a front of the mighty Mob. Cruise incorporates all the features of the young, willing yuppie who would sell his soul for $100.000 a year, a house and a beautiful car. Although when he realizes that the behind the facades his life (and the lives of all lawyers at the firm) is being ruthlessly and efficiently ruined he tries to escape. Gene Hackman is also a good choice for Mitch's senior partner, Avery who lost his illusions long ago. Ed Harris is the FBI officer whose task is to stir the calm waters at the Mob's law firm. His performance is a bit over the top (Harris seems to overplay all his roles), anyway it is acceptable. Wilford Brimley is the security man of the firm. He is cold, efficient and frightening and seems never to make a mistake. In fact, he's the one to put goose bumps on your back. The only weak link is Jeanne Tripplehorn, who throws in a pale, unlikely version of Mitch's wife. You simply can't believe her feelings because they're not played well. Last, but not least, kudos to Holly Hunter, who steals all the scenes she's in (unfortunately there are not too many scenes with her).The director and the director of photography manage to create an atmosphere that sucks you in from the very first moment of the movie and doesn't let you go till the end. The movie makes a dark impression and even the shots taken in the Caribbean don't make you feel good. There is a sinister intention in every move and you can actually feel the growing tension. The Firm is a very well directed movie, indeed.Unfortunately, the DVD itself doesn't offer much for the viewer. All we get are two trailers, but no documentary, no interviews and absolutely no extras. Even the compulsory director narrates the movie track wasn't added.

Offers are flying in but the most lucrative comes from a small but seemingly extremely wealthy Memphis law firm. So off he goes to Tennessee to a life of seductive affluence. Next thing we know he's learning that his new employers are the main legal representatives of the mob and the FBI want him to turn over the files. If he does, he'll be disbarred for life for breaking client confidentiality, not to mention living in permanent fear of violent retribution for his betrayal. If tells the FBI to get lost and stays with the firm, he's hopelessly morally compromised and, sooner or later, on his way to jail. If he leaves they will certainly have him killed.

But it's still hugely entertaining stuff and all 154 minutes of it flies past. Apart from Altman's `Gingerbread Man' it's much the best of the various glossy Grisham adaptations we've been subjected to and it would be churlish to deny that it's all great fun. Little credit for this goes to Cruise as the smart but not very likeable yuppy lawyer at the centre of the story nor to Jeanne Tripplehorn as his boring drip of a wife. But it's very nicely directed by Pollack with some very strong supporting performances especially from Gary Busey and Holly Hunter, a far more likeable couple representating the rather less grand side of the legal profession.

Tom Cruise plays a young attorney who just graduated law school who accepts a job with a law firm, who, unknown to him, is defending the mob.

Tom's character, is at a crossroads: does he continue working for the crooked firm that is making him millions and affording him and his wife a beautiful home, or does he assists the FBI in closing the firm down?Tom Cruise was on a winning streak during this time in Hollywood history as nearly every film he made in the early nineties became blockbusters. ""The Firm"" would gross 270 million dollars at the worldwide boxoffice and catapult Cruise to the top of motion picture's A List.The supporting cast of the movie was also equally impressive with such actors as Ed Harris, Gene Hackman, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Holly Hunter, who would win an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress.This DVD contains two theatrical trailers, is in widescreen format enhanced for 16x9 televisions, and there are english subtitles included.

Despite being a very ""slick"" Hollywood production, those ""plusses"" make the film interesting enough to enjoy from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, ""The Firm"" sees young lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) & his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn) courted in a prestigious fashion by a Memphis law firm.  After being paired with mentor Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), however, Mitch & Abby begin to put together the dark secret behind the existence of the firm...one which ultimately involves the FBI and much business intrigue.The plot of ""The Firm"" is its hallmark, to be sure.  There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested from start to finish, and you'll never quite guess what might happen next.  There are many business-ethics issues in play throughout the entire film, all of which are navigated very perceptively by director Sydney Pollack.The acting is also top-notch (if not a bit over-the-top at times).  Besides those mentioned above, other names like Ed Harris, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, Gary Busey, & Tobin Bell turn in good showings.  There is hardly a dull scene in the entire experience thanks in large part of this enlarged acting crew.Thus, ""The Firm"" is a good ""lawyer intrigue"" movie that fails to rise to the status of, say, ""A Few Good Men"".  It is very comparable to ""The Devil's Advocate"" in both overall success & material.  A 3.5 star rating would be my exact choice, but I'll give this one the benefit of the doubt due to the plot-twists that surprised me and an ending that had me feel it was all worthwhile.",4,"Hollywood Slick, But Still Makes You Think",1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1711,"['are', 'lot', 'positives', 'Firm', 'going', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'intriguing', 'lawyer/business', 'plotline', 'great', 'ending', 'nowhere', 'being', 'very', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'plusses', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'beginning', 'end.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Firm', 'sees', 'young', 'lawyer', 'Mitch', 'McDeere', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'wife', 'Abby', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'courted', 'prestigious', 'fashion', 'Memphis', 'law', 'firm', 'being', 'paired', 'mentor', 'Avery', 'Tolar', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'however', 'Mitch', 'Abby', 'begin', 'put', 'together', 'dark', 'secret', 'existence', 'firm', 'one', 'ultimately', 'FBI', 'much', 'business', 'intrigue.The', 'plot', 'Firm', 'hallmark', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'interested', 'start', 'finish', ""'ll"", 'never', 'quite', 'guess', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'next', 'are', 'many', 'business-ethics', 'issues', 'play', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'navigated', 'very', 'perceptively', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack.The', 'acting', 'also', 'top-notch', 'not', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'mentioned', 'other', 'names', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'turn', 'good', 'showings', 'hardly', 'dull', 'scene', 'entire', 'experience', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'enlarged', 'acting', 'crew.Thus', 'Firm', 'good', 'lawyer', 'intrigue', 'movie', 'rise', 'status', 'say', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'very', 'comparable', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'overall', 'success', 'material', '3.5', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'exact', 'choice', ""'ll"", 'give', 'one', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'due', 'plot-twists', 'surprised', 'ending', 'had', 'feel', 'was', 'worthwhile']",N/A
