I suspect that the positive reviews were written by either relatives of the actors or the actors themselves.  This was a difficult movie to follow and understand. It got better toward the end, but not good enough to justify the time wasted viewing this with some family members.  Leaving two young females in a cabin in a practically deserted woods is unrealistic.  Poor acting--very amateurish and stiff delivery of lines by the actresses. The camp &#34;scary laughter&#34;, voices being heard by Sarah and her reaction to the voices are humerous.  The waste of food ( a beautiful piece of red meat served raw) was also disgusting.  The direction and camera work were also distractions.  The wide and long camera shots indicate that the characters are being &#34;watched&#34; when in fact there are only 2 stationary cameras inside the house and possibly one camera that follows the characters.  This is a very sad topic (mental illness) which deserves a much better representation.  Pitiful, do not waste any precious hours viewing this unrealistic depiction.",1,Time waster...big time,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1157,"['movie', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'previous', 'review', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'sites', 'suspect', 'positive', 'reviews', 'were', 'written', 'relatives', 'actors', 'actors', 'was', 'difficult', 'movie', 'follow', 'understand', 'got', 'better', 'end', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'justify', 'time', 'wasted', 'viewing', 'family', 'members', 'Leaving', 'two', 'young', 'females', 'cabin', 'practically', 'deserted', 'woods', 'unrealistic', 'Poor', 'acting', 'very', 'amateurish', 'stiff', 'delivery', 'lines', 'actresses', 'camp', '34', 'scary', 'laughter', '34', 'voices', 'being', 'heard', 'Sarah', 'reaction', 'voices', 'are', 'humerous', 'waste', 'food', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'red', 'meat', 'served', 'raw', 'was', 'also', 'disgusting', 'direction', 'camera', 'work', 'were', 'also', 'distractions', 'wide', 'long', 'camera', 'shots', 'indicate', 'characters', 'are', 'being', '34', 'watched', '34', 'when', 'fact', 'are', 'only', '2', 'stationary', 'cameras', 'house', 'possibly', 'one', 'camera', 'characters', 'very', 'sad', 'topic', 'mental', 'illness', 'much', 'better', 'representation', 'Pitiful', 'do', 'not', 'waste', 'precious', 'hours', 'viewing', 'unrealistic', 'depiction']",N/A

The crazy level of the other one was way overdone and never really fully explained as to what caused her 'break' with reality. With a better written storyline this would have been a much better movie. I believe Lucy was the name of the younger actress and she did a great job! She embodies the carefreeness of someone of that age group, though her father making some kind of appearance would have given more life to the storyline. The facing of mental illness of a family member or friend is something most of us has to deal with at some point but the fuzzyness of the camera and whispering voices never really gave light to a particular illness. There was some foggyness that I think was storyline issues.Anyway it wasn't horrible thanks to the young actress that has a great talent.",3,Not Horrible,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,879,"['Alright', 'so', 'think', 'younger', 'actress', 'very', 'talented', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'crazy', 'level', 'other', 'one', 'was', 'way', 'overdone', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'explained', 'what', 'caused', ""'break"", 'reality', 'better', 'written', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'believe', 'Lucy', 'was', 'name', 'younger', 'actress', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'carefreeness', 'someone', 'age', 'group', 'father', 'making', 'kind', 'appearance', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'life', 'storyline', 'facing', 'mental', 'illness', 'family', 'member', 'friend', 'something', 'most', 'deal', 'point', 'fuzzyness', 'camera', 'whispering', 'voices', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'light', 'particular', 'illness', 'was', 'foggyness', 'think', 'was', 'storyline', 'issues.Anyway', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'thanks', 'young', 'actress', 'great', 'talent']",N/A
