945628,A3GE934KFZ5EZ6,B000BNTMKK,Kim Maddalozzo,"[12, 12]","Anthony Trollope has become one of my favorite authors in British Literature.  I recently discovered his masterpiece The Way We Live Now in a used bookstore and once I had read the novel I could not believe that I had never heard of him before.  I do not think he gets enough recognition for his work.  His books are all masterpieces, his use of humor, wit, sarcasm and satire is present in all of the books I have read by him.  I also love him for his creations of strong female characters.  He is one of the only male writers I have read that makes women honest and portrays them truthfully.  I love BBC Drama's period productions and I was excited when I found this boxed set on Amazon, even though I have not read He Knew He Was Right and The Barrister Chronicles, I have seen previews of this films and I knew I had to own this.The Way We Live Now is an epic masterpiece of writing and I was really interested to see how it was close it would be to the book.  I think it does an excellent job of measuring up.  Matthew Macfayden is excellent as Sir Felix Carbury, even though I would have preferred him to be a hero, he really is a versatility as an actor and he plays his part so accurately.  I also enjoyed the performances of Paloma Baeza as Hetta and Cillian Murphy as Mr. Paul Montague.  Douglas Hodge was as an excellent choice for the loyal, kind and truly wonderful Roger Carbury.  Even though the film strayed a bit from the book especially where the relationship of Mr. Montague and Mrs. Hurtle are concerned, I thought that it was still excellent and kept well with the spirit of the book.  I think the audience can pick up the excellent satire of the production well from the performance David Suchet's as Mr. Melmotte.He Knew He Was Right was probably my favorite of all three of the films.  I thought this was excellent and might just be one of my favorite British period productions of all time.  I have not read the book yet so I can not comment about how close it was to the book, but besides that the film itself is wonderful.  The acting is fantastic, I love Oliver Dimsdale as Louis Trevelyan, I thought he did an excellent job connecting with the audience and we can not help but feel sorry for the way he chooses to destroy his life even though we might want to hate him for the way he accuses his wife. Laura Fraser played an excellent part of Mrs. Trevelyan, she captured the fierce independence and head-strong attitude of the character.  All of the other actors are phenomenal.  The story itself is excellent and original and filled with loads of rare human emotions and many memorable moments.  I was hooked from start to finish and it will be one that I will watch over and over.  I also enjoyed the way it was filmed where every major character sort of as a moments of monologues with the audience.  I know it sounds really stupid but it is pulled off so well it enhances the story and creates a real connection between us and the characters.The Barrister Cronicles is also another excellent production.  I have not read this novel as well yet so I can not say how close it is to the book.  Alan Rickman does an excellent job as  Mr. Slope as are all of the other main characters in the series.  It is really a delightful look at the time and I really enjoyed the story line.  It is filled with humor and insight into the time period and is another great treasure that is part of this collection.",5,"Splendid, a Rare Treat!",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,3430,"['Anthony', 'Trollope', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'British', 'Literature', 'recently', 'discovered', 'masterpiece', 'Way', 'Live', 'Now', 'used', 'bookstore', 'once', 'had', 'read', 'novel', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'enough', 'recognition', 'work', 'books', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'use', 'humor', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'satire', 'present', 'books', 'have', 'read', 'also', 'love', 'creations', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'one', 'only', 'male', 'writers', 'have', 'read', 'women', 'honest', 'truthfully', 'love', 'BBC', 'Drama', 'period', 'productions', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'found', 'boxed', 'set', 'Amazon', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Knew', 'Was', 'Right', 'Barrister', 'Chronicles', 'have', 'seen', 'previews', 'films', 'knew', 'had', 'own', 'this.The', 'Way', 'Live', 'Now', 'epic', 'masterpiece', 'writing', 'was', 'really', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'close', 'would', 'be', 'book', 'think', 'excellent', 'job', 'measuring', 'up', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'excellent', 'Sir', 'Felix', 'Carbury', 'even', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'be', 'hero', 'really', 'versatility', 'actor', 'part', 'so', 'accurately', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Paloma', 'Baeza', 'Hetta', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Mr.', 'Paul', 'Montague', 'Douglas', 'Hodge', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'loyal', 'kind', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'Roger', 'Carbury', 'Even', 'film', 'strayed', 'bit', 'book', 'especially', 'where', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Montague', 'Mrs.', 'Hurtle', 'are', 'concerned', 'thought', 'was', 'still', 'excellent', 'kept', 'well', 'spirit', 'book', 'think', 'audience', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'excellent', 'satire', 'production', 'well', 'performance', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Mr.', 'Melmotte.He', 'Knew', 'Was', 'Right', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'three', 'films', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'British', 'period', 'productions', 'time', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'yet', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'how', 'close', 'was', 'book', 'film', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'love', 'Oliver', 'Dimsdale', 'Louis', 'Trevelyan', 'thought', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'connecting', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'way', 'destroy', 'life', 'even', 'might', 'want', 'hate', 'way', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Fraser', 'played', 'excellent', 'part', 'Mrs.', 'Trevelyan', 'captured', 'fierce', 'independence', 'head-strong', 'attitude', 'character', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'story', 'excellent', 'original', 'filled', 'loads', 'rare', 'human', 'emotions', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'was', 'hooked', 'start', 'finish', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'where', 'major', 'character', 'sort', 'moments', 'monologues', 'audience', 'know', 'really', 'stupid', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'story', 'real', 'connection', 'characters.The', 'Barrister', 'Cronicles', 'also', 'excellent', 'production', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'how', 'close', 'book', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'excellent', 'job', 'Mr.', 'Slope', 'are', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'really', 'delightful', 'look', 'time', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'line', 'filled', 'humor', 'insight', 'time', 'period', 'great', 'treasure', 'part', 'collection']",N/A
945629,A31RULW0KNYJ5H,B000BNTMKK,LA,"[8, 8]","I am a huge Anthony Trollope fan. I particularly enjoy how he writes about women. Trollope's 19th century women are surprisingly feminist, deep, and complicated. He was ahead of his time in describing how women could be quite powerful despite their social and political limitations.The Barchester Chronicles is noteworthy for Mrs. Proudy. She is a force of nature who can be quite vengeful if wronged. Per usual with these BBC productions the acting is excellent with Nigel Hawthorne, Alan Rickman, and Geraldine McEwan stealing their scenes. This one also includes an extra featuring a profile of Peterborough Cathedral.He Knew He Was Right is probably the weakest of the three adaptations, but it's still good. Louis is likely insane but lives in a society that does not understand mental illness. This leads to tragedy. Some of the subplots are more interesting as they depict the schemings and power grabs by women. Acting honors go to Caroline Martin, David Tennant, and Anna Massey. This one also has an excellent feature/biography on writer Anthony Trollope. It provides fascinating insights into Trollope and the women in his real life as well as in his books.The best of the adaptations is the wonderfully contemporary The Way We Live Now. Greed, corruption, fraud, deceit, discrimination fill this story in a similar way to what we've experienced in our own era. The acting is, again, top notch.

I disagree, although I haven't read the book so perhaps the movie didn't do it justice.  Yes, Alan Rickman was good as Mr. Slope but the rest of the cast was tedious and very difficult to like.  Donald Pleasance' annoying affectation, constantly touching his face while talking and putting his hands to his mouth were disconcerting and I was tempted to fast forward every scene he was in.The Way We Live Now was my favorite of the trio.  David Suchet's portrayal of Melmotte was downright hilarious and his giggle put me into fits of giggling, too.  His daughter Marie was just as hilarious as played by the helium voiced actress Shirley Henderson.  The story itself is quite predictable but nonetheless enjoyable.He Knew He Was Right was downright depressing for me.  It's visually stunning but that's all I can say that is good about it.

There are many of those in here.  Not only does Trollope deal with the question, he exposes the impact on a simple innocent.In contemporary terms, it is like watching two intellectuals argue the merit of capital punishment while watching the reactions of someone awaiting the death sentence he may or may not be subject to; and finding out that the prisoner is himself more and more ambiguous about his own personal guilt.I really don't want to give away anything to those not already familiar with Trollope's work.  Watching this unfold in its sometimes leisurely pace is a true delight.  If you watch this with another, you are almost certain to start arguing about different issues even while the movie is on.  The acting is brilliant, too.Enjoy.",5,Very Satisfying Set,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,1125,"['wish', 'could', 'tell', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'three', 'movies', 'want', 'savor', 'seeing', 'first', 'set', 'Barchester', 'Chronicles.What', 'can', 'say', 'even', 'single', 'series', 'Barchester', 'Chronicles', 'sufficient', 'justify', 'entire', 'set.Barchester', 'wonderful', 'product', 'Trollope', 'was', 'superb', 'dealing', 'many-sided', 'moral', 'question', 'are', 'many', 'here', 'Not', 'only', 'Trollope', 'deal', 'question', 'impact', 'simple', 'innocent.In', 'contemporary', 'terms', 'watching', 'two', 'intellectuals', 'argue', 'merit', 'capital', 'punishment', 'watching', 'reactions', 'someone', 'awaiting', 'death', 'sentence', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'subject', 'finding', 'out', 'prisoner', 'more', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'own', 'personal', 'guilt.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'not', 'already', 'familiar', 'Trollope', 'work', 'Watching', 'unfold', 'sometimes', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'true', 'delight', 'watch', 'are', 'almost', 'certain', 'start', 'arguing', 'different', 'issues', 'even', 'movie', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'too.Enjoy']",N/A
