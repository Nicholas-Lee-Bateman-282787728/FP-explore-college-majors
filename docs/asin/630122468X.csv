Ugh.  I am one of the ones who stayed watching.Diane Baker can't act.  Her career went nowhere and she is only remembered today for having teamed up with Joan on a few occasions.  This being one - and the last - of them.Of the other players, Charles Bickford is the best of the lot.  He's been around Hollywood for quite awhile and knows what to do.  The rest of the cast is completely forgettable.Which leaves Joan Crawford.  At this stage of the game, after ""Strait-Jacket"" and ""The Caretakers"", she actually looks good!  It's joan Crawford in a whacky script that at least gives her the moments to look great and inject some life into an otherwise turgid story.when you dwarf everybody else around you - whether in a good film or bad - THAT is a star.  Crawford was never an actress to take truly seriously, but every now and then, as here, she shows us what star muscle is all about.I don't think I'll ever watch it again, though.",2,This is what makes a star.,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,1238,"['Somewhere', 'Strait-Jacket', '/', 'Caretakers', '/', 'Saw', 'What', 'Did', 'atrocities', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'found', 'time', 'almost', 'star', 'made-for-television', 'movie.It', 'gawd', 'awful', 'big', 'secret', 'so', 'appallingly', 'stupid', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'stayed', 'bitter', 'end', 'watching', 'drek', 'Ugh', 'am', 'one', 'ones', 'who', 'stayed', 'watching.Diane', 'Baker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Her', 'career', 'went', 'nowhere', 'only', 'remembered', 'today', 'having', 'teamed', 'up', 'Joan', 'few', 'occasions', 'being', 'one', 'last', 'them.Of', 'other', 'players', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'best', 'lot', 'been', 'around', 'Hollywood', 'quite', 'awhile', 'what', 'do', 'rest', 'cast', 'completely', 'forgettable.Which', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'stage', 'game', 'Strait-Jacket', 'Caretakers', 'actually', 'good', 'joan', 'Crawford', 'whacky', 'script', 'least', 'moments', 'look', 'great', 'inject', 'life', 'otherwise', 'turgid', 'story.when', 'dwarf', 'everybody', 'else', 'good', 'film', 'bad', 'star', 'Crawford', 'was', 'never', 'actress', 'take', 'truly', 'seriously', 'now', 'then', 'here', 'what', 'star', 'muscle', 'about.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'watch', 'again']",Fatal Confinement VHS

Note, there is an even scarcer release of this film, re-issued in 1997 under the title,Della.""Fatal Confinement"" was originally a pilot from 1964 titled, ""Royal Bay."" But when the TV series didn't pick up it was edited for theatrical presentation with Ms. Crawford billed as the star. The picture is in color and it is a total of 70 minutes long. This particular release was distributed by a company called International Film Forum. The original studio that produced this film is Four Star Productions. And, the original studio that produced this for TV is Four Star Productions.In this film, Joan plays Della Chappell, a very wealthy and incredibly reclusive woman. When a big company wants the land Della lives on, the town sends out Barney Stafford to talk to her. She invites Barney over to negotiate the proposal. Barney soon takes a liking to Della's equally reclusive daughter, Jenny Chappell. After spending some time with Jenny, he realizes that Della has a dark secret, one that keeps them from the outside world.I am not crazy about the cover of this video. Joan should have been on it.

247575,A3PLN4YGJ58NX0,630122468X,"Robert A. Bowers ""Bowers""","[1, 1]","This was filmed as the pilot for a show that didn't happen I am told.  Too bad, it might have been an ok show although this episode is long on melodrama and short on logic.  As is often  typical for ""mysterious house with troubled inhabitants""  movies,  if the characters had ever talked , not much of this would have happened. The big mystery turns out to be something sad,  but not any kind of shameful secret, and the reason given for secrecy, carried to that extreme,  is pretty farfetched.  I am a  fan of Diane Baker and she is lovely in this but her character comes off as a first class nut job; why a smart lawyer would let himself get pulled into that situation is the real mystery.  Crawford looks very 60's glamorous and never forgets, or lets the other characters forget,  for a single second, that she is a MAJOR MOVIE STAR acting in a tv movie. Is she fun to watch? you bet! (and occasionally moving as well).  Paul Burke is reasonably good and it's always nice to see the great Charles Bickford who was a real master of his craft.  So,to sum it up:  kind of campy, not too believable, but I enjoyed it.",3,TV movie with some good points but lots of not so hot ones too,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,1117,"['was', 'filmed', 'pilot', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'am', 'told', 'Too', 'bad', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ok', 'show', 'episode', 'long', 'melodrama', 'short', 'logic', 'often', 'typical', 'mysterious', 'house', 'troubled', 'inhabitants', 'movies', 'characters', 'had', 'ever', 'talked', 'not', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'big', 'mystery', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'sad', 'not', 'kind', 'shameful', 'secret', 'reason', 'given', 'secrecy', 'carried', 'extreme', 'pretty', 'farfetched', 'am', 'fan', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'lovely', 'character', 'off', 'first', 'class', 'nut', 'job', 'why', 'smart', 'lawyer', 'would', 'let', 'get', 'pulled', 'situation', 'real', 'mystery', 'Crawford', 'very', '60', 'glamorous', 'never', 'forgets', 'other', 'characters', 'forget', 'single', 'second', 'MAJOR', 'MOVIE', 'STAR', 'acting', 'tv', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'bet', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'as', 'well', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'reasonably', 'good', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'great', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'master', 'craft', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'kind', 'campy', 'not', 'too', 'believable', 'enjoyed']",Fatal Confinement VHS
247576,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,630122468X,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","Joan Crawford's career still was pretty much dried up even after the enormous success of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" in 1962. Many in Hollywood believed the success of that movie was a fluke and continued to ignore Joan Crawford as the wonderful actress she was. To make matters worse Bette Davis, wanting to avenge herself on Joan for suppposedly making Davis lose the Oscar for Jane, publicly told interviewers that Joan was drunk throughout the making of ""Baby Jane"" which made producers timid in hiring Crawford for work.What resulted was horror movie offers to Joan such as ""Straight-Jacket"", ""Berserk!"" and television appearances. In 1964 Joan made this pilot for television called ""Della"" or as it is also known ""Fatal Confinement"". The telefilm is pretty soapy (it reminds me of a 1960's ""Dynasty"") about a wealthy woman (played to perfection by Crawford) who refuses to allow her daughter (played by Joan's ""Best of Everything"" and ""Straight-Jacket"" co-star Diane Baker). Joan looks beautiful in some of the clothes she wears although I loathed the grey hair she wore (Joan stated around this time she was having a hard time getting her grey to dye so she decided to go white.The film is pretty rare so if your lucky enough grab a copy of this. The film is also available on DVD so look for a copy of that too.All in all a great way to spend 90 minutes with the one and only Joan Crawford.",5,"""My Joan in the 1960's""",1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,1404,"['Joan', 'Crawford', 'career', 'still', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'dried', 'up', 'even', 'enormous', 'success', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', '1962', 'Many', 'Hollywood', 'believed', 'success', 'movie', 'was', 'fluke', 'continued', 'ignore', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'was', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'wanting', 'avenge', 'Joan', 'suppposedly', 'making', 'Davis', 'lose', 'Oscar', 'Jane', 'publicly', 'told', 'interviewers', 'Joan', 'was', 'drunk', 'making', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'made', 'producers', 'timid', 'hiring', 'Crawford', 'work.What', 'resulted', 'was', 'horror', 'movie', 'offers', 'Joan', 'such', 'Straight-Jacket', 'Berserk', 'television', 'appearances', '1964', 'Joan', 'made', 'pilot', 'television', 'called', 'Della', 'also', 'known', 'Fatal', 'Confinement', 'telefilm', 'pretty', 'soapy', '1960', 'Dynasty', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'played', 'perfection', 'Crawford', 'who', 'allow', 'daughter', 'played', 'Joan', 'Best', 'Everything', 'Straight-Jacket', 'co-star', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Joan', 'beautiful', 'clothes', 'loathed', 'grey', 'hair', 'wore', 'Joan', 'stated', 'time', 'was', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'grey', 'dye', 'so', 'decided', 'go', 'white.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'rare', 'so', 'lucky', 'enough', 'grab', 'copy', 'film', 'also', 'available', 'DVD', 'so', 'look', 'copy', 'too.All', 'great', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'one', 'only', 'Joan', 'Crawford']",Fatal Confinement VHS
