Whether you're a writer, singer, artist or engineering. Our gifts are given to us when we're small, but as adults it is up to us to remember and find ourselves all the while dealing with the lemons life throws our way.Now in J's case not only did she make lemons with what was given to her (leaving her husband, going on aid and still trying to get a &#34;decent&#34;) she put a little umph in it by still going after her dreams and not giving up.Most of all, I love that she stayed humble. She stayed with the one thing she always wanted to do... write.That is awesome and this movie was a great showcase of her life, struggles and a lesson to all of us. Don't give up.
