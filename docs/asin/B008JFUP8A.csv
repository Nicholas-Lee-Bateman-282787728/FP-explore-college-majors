The obvious question is, how good or bad is Jaden Smith?  My take is that he's bad at the beginning when he's doing a voiceover and when he's portraying a cocky recruit trying to make it to Ranger status.  He just doesn't have any charisma or believability in that mode - at least in this movie.But in the latter 2/3 when he's the scared kid who needs his dad, I think he's actually really good, if not great.  He's not old enough to just go it alone, but he's old enough to accomplish a lot and I think he portrays his fear and vulnerability very effectively.Will Smith, on the other hand, shows the charisma of a huge movie star, and it's nice to see him taking a very different tone with this role.  He's a strict military father, and I feel he does a good job with it.The overall premise is decent, the special effects are very good, and though the outcome is predictable it's mostly worthwhile.  Now, the arc of Jaden's acting takes a nosedive (a bit, anyway) at the end when he...I'll try not to spoil it, but really this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone...when he reaches his desired Zen-like state while battling the big monster.  It comes too quick and doesn't necessarily feel &#34;earned&#34;, but then again we all knew it was coming.This is a decent sci-fi flick and worth a rental at the very least.  Go in with moderate expectations and I think most people will be satisfied unless you're very picky.  But I love blockbuster scifi and I generally cut films like this some slack if the overall spectacle is good enough, and this one is.

It wasn't excusable for Jaden Smith to show no acting skills or charisma when he played Ralph Macchio in the forgettable remake of the Karate kid. But here where Will Smith is sidelined, and can't help out, the entire movie rests on the shoulders of a kid who needs more skill. In a future where evil aliens could have been wiped out if any human had a gun, the human race is on the verge of being destroyed because they build their houses out of shower curtains.Fortunately, Will Smith is able to defeat most of the aliens by stroking his phallus stick.Most of the movie takes place on a planet where all the life has evolved to hunt humans, a species that doesn't live on the planet. Will smith is trapped in a chair and Jaden must climb a volcano to use a flashlight and stop stanking of fear and defeating the last evil alien with the right stroking of his own phallus stick.If that plot description doesn't make sense, don't worry. The movie doesn't bother with logic or plot or character. Maybe a better actor could have pulled it off. Not this one. and I don't really blame the kid. Will Smith learned how to act during his TV series. His son just gets thrown into lead roles and is expected to know how to do it automatically.This is a film where everyone was set up to fail.",1,Fear is the mind-killer.

It wasn't great, wasn't classic. Wasn't even entirely awesome. But, as I begrudgingly had to admit, After Earth was the first watchable Shyamalan movie since Signs, nd not a *bad* movie...That having been said, the movie had flaws big enough to drive Shyamalan's ego through. The dialogue was *absolutely* cringeworthy. Laughably serious, terribly mundane, and cliched in that way that only pulp sci-fi can be (""It has found you.""), it had that joyless quality that only Shyamalan can bring. The acting was little better.Will Smith is dead serious, and as stern and commanding as the world's most humorless general. The gravitas was still there (That ""Take a knee"" line is strangely moving), but without his usual charm and charisma, Smith Sr. seemed to drag the movie down like a guy who had both his legs broken. Oh, right...Jaden has no real reason to be here (other than his father being in the same film), and we all hoped for a stronger actor, but he managed to be....watchable. Juuuust watchable, not extraordinary in any way. Though there were scenes, such as his climactic fight with the Ursa, where just a little of his father's talent and screen presence can be viewed in him.Other cons include the plodding pace the movie accepts at times, and the looong time it takes to get off the ground (literally). And the ""What the--?"" accent everyone is using. No, seriously: What the--?!...But prepare to be amazed when Shyamalan just shows you amazing stuff: a group of men jogging underneath a bloodred sun, herd of bison roaming over hills, a lush forest under the sky, a volcano floating flakes of ash down from the sky, a troop of monkeys running through a rain forest. The CGI was not the best I've ever seen, but the creature design and amazing cinematography really made up for that.As a huge animal lover, I was majorly entertained any time some wierd and wonderful animal came onscreen. The fact that sabretooths and giant vultures exist is absolutely ludicrous, but ludicrous in that suspend-your-disbelief-and-take-it-for-what-it-is way. Love the monkeys, but weren't there okapi's in the trailer?The landscape itself became a supporting character (again - the whole rainforest freezing thing is ludicrous, but passable). The cinematography was, at times extraordinary. That volcano fight at the end was gorgeously shot, and, I am ashamed to say, somewhat moving (being the only moment in the After Earth that I could actually label ""cool"" or ""awesome""). The biggest surprise for me was the score by James Newton Howard, which made sit up straight and go ""Whaaaat? This movie has a good score? I gotta get this on iTunes!"" And mention has to go to the costumes and tech, and for being the first sci-fi movie that has wood and cloth interiors rather than chrome and glass, which was pleasantly original.And hey, that speech about danger and fear is some profound stuff, man....Conclusion:CONS: Dialogue abysmal and laughable. Acting joyless and stiff. Story unoriginal and pace plodding.PROS: Stunning visuals, amazing cinematography, excellent score, costumes, and set design.My rating? I give After Earth a solid 3 stars - not great, not awful. All that negative reception is understandable, but not wholly warranted. This is not a classic for the ages, but rather, a pleasantly enjoyable night at the movies!P.S.

Honestly after watching it, I was surprised that it is getting such bad reviews.  Are people so narrow minded that they can't see an actor in a different type of part, accept him and FEEL the part?  To me this movie was eye opening.  It was so shocking to see Will Smith without his swagger, being so cold and unfeeling - but then I began to understand.  When they crash landed on Earth I did wonder about the plot holes that only the General and Kitai were the only survivors, but hey, it's a movie - we are supposed to suspend our disbelief.  I knew this was going to be a movie that was primarily driven by Jaden/Kitai and I remembered what an outstanding job he did with Karate Kid (he had to train for hours each day, rehearse, film and get his school work done - not an easy feat when you have Will Smith and Jackie Chan riding your behind).This movie kept me on the edge of my chair....the thought that us humans had destroyed Earth, not a very unrealistic thought.  Makes you start to wonder, if we did destroy Earth and had to leave, how would it recover without us there?  The panoramas they showed almost met my visions, though I kept thinking, I know us sneaky humans, not all of us would leave - so where are the stray wild humans?

This film lost me at hello. We use hand to hand combat to defeat Starship Trooper aliens? This film robbed Avatar which robbed everything. Plants would die if they froze every night? This film robbed the Batman and Robin utility belt/jumping the shark concept and took it to a new low.I think to even mention this film or approach it in any rational way only adds to the likelihood that someone might think is has some merit. It has zero merit and it's all rooted in the bad writing.This film is AWFUL. One of the worst in a long time.I'm not wasting too many words on this.After Earth with Will Smith and his son was one of the most awful films I've seen in a long time. The idea of a science fiction film with a father and son stranded on a hostile world is a great idea. It's gold in 2013, especially with the current level of filmmaking sophistication and special effects at any writers & directors disposal. You'd have to be 4 years old to mess up such a simply great idea and even then a 4 year old would likely do much better.Somehow M Night Shyamalan managed to implode this up beyond all wildest imagination. It was so bad I'm almost considering the possibility that he might just be intentionally thumbing his nose at Hollywood in some ironic way. I can't imagine any other reason this film could be cobbled together so poorly and with such little regard for logic, common sense, and science.All the film needed to do was have the two wake up on the hostile world and survive danger. If they wanted the plot point of the military father who finally comes to appreciate his son as a person, not a cadet, they could have added that in too. Just staying alive till help arrived could have been enough. And steer clear of Avatar type scenarios so you are not being redundant within recent film history. Almost any 2 people 2-3 days locked in a hotel room would have yielded a decent story. Any hack screenwriter could have then produced something of minor merit.This film is so far from mediocre and buried beneath 40 miles of waste that it is incredible it even exists.Then they add these insane plot points like a super futuristic ship crashes and only has 2 distress beacons that don't auto fire. No signal is sent out before, or during the crash?This film plays out like an old episode of batman where they have exactly what they need in their medical-pack.

Here's the deal: this is a fairly short film, so not a lot of plot is involved.  Most of the film is Will Smith and Jaden Smith in a man-vs.-nature situation in a post-apocalyptic Earth.  What you see in the previews is more or less what you get, but it's not entirely that simple.The biggest plus in this film is Will Smith's nuanced performance.  For fathers, I think this film has a lot of heart.  Its strongest point is the reconnecting of father and son through this crisis situation they're experiencing (crash-landing on Earth, etc.).  There are actually very few people in this movie, to be honest.  The plot is very centered on Cypher (Will Smith) and Kitai (Jaden Smith), but in itself, that is actually quite compelling.Jaden Smith is actually pretty good at many places throughout this film, and falls flat in others.  He's kind of the weak link, but the good thing is that Will Smith's experience is there to keep the film grounded and counterbalance him.  Jaden is not horrible, but doesn't quite hit all the notes perfectly.  Another factor is that the script doesn't always give us enough of a grasp of his perspective.  I think they needed to add more to really draw us into how he feels, as it's key to understanding the character's motivations (a desire to please his father/self-blame over a past tragedy/trauma and anger resulting from same tragedy).The only other major downside of the film is that it fails to really fill in the story enough to help the audience see that there is a much larger world here than what we saw in the film.  I would have liked to have seen more of this world, how it's run, who the aliens were (the Skrel), why they sent the Ursa, and maybe why they didn't just send a thousand of them and wipe out humanity, for instance.It's a good film, but maybe it won't appeal to what people were hoping for.  There isn't a lot of humor, and not that much action, but there is some good (mostly subtle) emotion throughout, along with interesting themes--the beauty of planet Earth, overcoming one's fears, father connecting with son, coping with loss of a child, and coming-of-age as a young man.I know it won't be a popular thing to say that I like it, and that more people should've checked it out, but...I like it.  I certainly wasn't blown away, but I was pleased with the film and I would've liked to see where this story was going.  I think it's better than people will give it credit for.  It's not going in the same direction as a lot of the big blockbusters with massive destruction, explosions, sometimes excessive violence and language and objectification of women, etc.It's also unique in having a cast that largely consists of people of color, but not prejudiced in that it shows this is a diverse world with not just one or two colors of people, and I like that in a movie.  (Some good assists towards the beginning of the film from two very good actors whose names escape me...)So...I say, check it out.  It's at least worth a rental, but I own it, and am already trying to watch it again after the first viewing.

I was prepared for the worst.  And yet....the movie is not terrible.  However, if that assessment sounds like it is lacking in enthusiasm, you are correct.First, a premise:  It is 1000 years after earth as we know it...due to some global cataclysm.  Will Smith (Cypher) plays a ""ranger"" in this movie, and his 14 year old son (Kitai) wants desperately to also be a ranger, so he can please his tough military like dad.In the movie, Cypher and Kitai crash land on a planet (Oh what a surprise...it happens to be earth!) and are the only two people left alive on the ship.  Cypher is badly hurt, and can not move.  So it is up to his son to ""man up"" and travel through the treacherous jungles of after earth - jungles that are full of dangerous newly-evolved creatures - to get to the other part of the crashed ship and retrieve the beacon, which will save both of their lives.Oh, I forgot to add...there is a creature that has escaped it's cage onboard the ship....a creature that has evolved to kill humans,and will track them down due to their ""fear pheromes.""  Evidently, the creature is used to ""train"" rangers, so they can learn to hide their fear (?)Anyway, Will Smith, the father, guides his son on his jungle journey through technology that allows him to see what the son sees.Does the son meet his doom in the jungle?  Will he be able to hide his fear and avoid being eaten by the escaped creature? Will the dad survive?  Will the son ever impress his dad?  I will let you watch the movie and find out.My opinion:  The movie was watchable.  I wasn't bored.  And yet....I think the plot was a bit ""thin.""  There were no real surprises...no clever twists or turns.  No ""OH WOW, I wasn't expecting that!"" moments.  I probably would not watch the movie again, but who knows?  Maybe if a few years go by, I might.I don't believe the movie deserves all the bad reviews it's gotten.  I think the acting was perfectly adequate.  Some say the movie takes itself ""too seriously,"" and maybe that's true.  It could have used some more character development and humor, certainly.

However, I am the type of person that likes to judge for myself. So, with an all star African-American cast of Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Zoe Kravitz and Black British actress Sophie Okonedo, a new genre of sci-fi has been released. Like most movies, in particular sci-fi, there is a slow introduction to the plot but once this movie takes off, it certainly keeps you engaged.To begin, this movie is about a family, specifically a father and son relationship that is greatly affected by the loss of a daughter (Zoe Kravitz) by an alien, who killed her while protecting her little brother. This takes a toll on the whole family but especially Will Smith a general and Zoe Kravitz's brother Jaden Smith a wannabe ranger/soldier.After a return from a mission, Will thinks about retiring but his wife suggests he take their son on a training mission to bond. However, the bonding doesn't quite go as plan when their spaceship crashes on old Earth, leaving Will Smith temporarily disabled, a dead crew, a creature loose, leaving a son as the heroine to save his father and himself by locating a the ship's rescue beacon to get help.However,this beacon is not nearby but in the ships wreakage across the planet. This means, Jaden will have to face his fears and set aside all blame from his sister's death and find the beacon despite the dangers. It's definitely a good watch, just like any other sci-fi and probably can be considered more like the Family Robinson in outer space.",5,"Intriguing Sci-Fi, judge for yourself!",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1563,"['heard', 'lot', 'reviews', 'movie', 'being', 'bomb', 'including', 'ones', 'here', 'Amazon', 'However', 'am', 'type', 'person', 'judge', 'So', 'star', 'African-American', 'cast', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Zoe', 'Kravitz', 'Black', 'British', 'actress', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'new', 'genre', 'sci-fi', 'been', 'released', 'most', 'movies', 'particular', 'sci-fi', 'slow', 'introduction', 'plot', 'once', 'movie', 'certainly', 'engaged.To', 'begin', 'movie', 'family', 'specifically', 'father', 'son', 'relationship', 'greatly', 'affected', 'loss', 'daughter', 'Zoe', 'Kravitz', 'alien', 'who', 'killed', 'protecting', 'little', 'brother', 'toll', 'whole', 'family', 'especially', 'Will', 'Smith', 'general', 'Zoe', 'Kravitz', 'brother', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'wannabe', 'ranger/soldier.After', 'return', 'mission', 'Will', 'retiring', 'wife', 'take', 'son', 'training', 'mission', 'bond', 'However', 'bonding', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'plan', 'when', 'spaceship', 'crashes', 'old', 'Earth', 'leaving', 'Will', 'Smith', 'temporarily', 'disabled', 'dead', 'crew', 'creature', 'loose', 'leaving', 'son', 'heroine', 'save', 'father', 'locating', 'ship', 'rescue', 'beacon', 'get', 'help.However', 'beacon', 'not', 'nearby', 'ships', 'wreakage', 'planet', 'Jaden', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'fears', 'set', 'aside', 'blame', 'sister', 'death', 'find', 'beacon', 'dangers', 'definitely', 'good', 'watch', 'just', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'probably', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'more', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'outer', 'space']",N/A

It shows how the power of love and courage grows when the bond is under extreme duress. It allows all of us to wish we had a father or a son as brave as shown in After Earth!This is not a typical science fiction story, so if you are going to enjoy it you will have to shut-down that thinking brain of yours. Your mind will want to have a thousand questions answered about the world created in After Earth. And those questions are not going to get answered!This is also a many layered message movie. So if you are looking for constant and brainless adrenal rushes, like you got in the last two J.J. Abrams' Star Trek films, then you probably won't enjoy After Earth. But if you are like me, and you enjoy stories that are trying to challenge us to do better in the real world both with our relationships with those we love and with our environment, then you'll love After Earth!There is a strong pro-environment theme that runs through this story. The most important being that life on earth does not need us human beings in any way, shape, or form to prosper! In fact, it's quite obvious the earth's creatures will do a lot better once we are gone. It's extraordinarily sobering to realize that with the notable exception of small groups of tribal humans, like the Native Americans once inhabiting North America before Columbus, our present-day human race simply doesn't know how to and/or care to live in harmony with the rest of nature.

I like most of the movies that Will Smith has made but this role did not suit him well. Will Smith is best when he can display the breadth of his personality. He's funny, endearing and can be downright human when given the chance. Why in the world he took the role of an intentionally unemotional - or at least unfearful - space ranger who, due to his lack of fear, is awesome at killing alien enemies. You see, these aliens are blind but hunt based us by smelling pheromones released when we are afraid. They don't use any fancy technology to kill you - just tooth and claw - oh and BIG pincers!Yes - this is where you say &#34;why don't the humans just make a few million gallons of synthetic pheromones and then have fun watching the aliens run around in circles all day?&#34; or perhaps &#34;Why don't the humans just wear full body suits with re-breathers so no pheromones are released into the atmosphere?&#34; or maybe &#34;Why don't these humans, who have advanced spaceships and all sorts of other cool tech, just use drones to kill the aliens because they would be 100% invisible?&#34;.All that before we get to the plot holes - who puts uber powerful distress beacons somewhere where the pilots can't get to them, and haven't these space rangers ever heard of explosive-projectile weapons?And No, there are no reasonable responses to these questions EXCEPT to say that this was a way for Will Smith and his son to play a father and son duo in a big budget movie.Jaden Smith gets most of the screen time and I'm sorry to say he wasn't ready for it. I loved him in Karate Kid and The Pursuit of Happyness but he didn't have the chops to pull this role off. He came across as whiny but not in a reasonable way. He just could not convey the range of emotion required from this role. His one flash of anger at his father came across as contrived and strained.Despite the inappropriate role for Will Smith, the poor acting by Jaden Smith and conceptual holes big enough to drive a moon through, I still mostly liked this movie. It comes down to special effects, a great score, lush scenery and cool tech. I did not see this movie for insight into father-son bonds, or for any keen insights into humanity. I have art house films for that. When I told my own brain to shut up, sit back and relax, I found myself enjoying the movie.

I think unfortunately because of M. Night Shyamalan as a director and Jaden Smith as the main character, whom most people feel has his career in acting due to his fathers clout, this movie has been received with a bit of negative Bias. Now, I have seen some pretty sorry movies over the years. If you ignore the bias and look at the movie objectively without consideration of cast and crew, this wasn't a sorry movie. The very first part of the story is a bit weak. Not enough character introduction was shown to get you involved in the characters lives. I am thinking the scenes that lead up to the son's dismissal were cut leaving a gap that isn't properly explained. It gives no visual representation of why Kitai (Jaden Smith) was cut from the ranks of the graduating rangers. Probably due to the finished product of those scenes not meeting the quality requirements. they were probably not filmed again due to costs. Other than this, the acting was watchable and the story (A survival story) was good and reasonably believable based on the level of technology shown during the movie and the amount of time in the future (Enough time to develop faster than light interstellar travel, find a new world to live in, run from a hostile planet that had evolved in many ways to kill humans and live 1000 years after that time). In other words a distant future. The special affects were good and believable enough to keep you involved but not spectacular.The theme of the story is the understanding that fear is not real except in ones mind but danger is. That you can overcome the danger if you overcome your fear and learn to think clearly instead of letting fear cause you to panic and ultimately cause you to make a very fatal mistake. Not a bad survivalist way to think and live. I think the story gets this point across nicely. General Raige's son Kitai learns this as he goes to retrieve the second emergency beacon in the tail end of the crashed ship averting many dangers and barely surviving some. The ship is approximately 2 days away. Kitai's father is struggling to stay alive with 2 badly broken legs, one with arterial damage. The large bird part of the story is a bit hard to believe but, I guess it could be possible if these animals have had the time to evolve and become more intelligent.

In the process, it also gets overrun with rabid baboons, mutated big cats, gargantuan condors, and various other horrible creatures. What's left of the human race is saved by the Rangers, including the legendarily fearless General Cypher (Will Smith), transporting them to the stars. However, during a routine father-son bonding expedition Cypher and his cadet son, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith), who failed the fear test as a young boy during the alien invasion and has just been denied promotion to Ranger, find themselves crash-landed on Earth once again. . .AFTER EARTH is a watchable science fiction thriller with some good special effects and decent acting.

A lot of ho-hum sci-fi thriller technology: Ships that can travel between stars in a matter of hours but are completely vulnerable to Sol's Asteroid Belt, etc. I guess the aliens confiscated all the guns because the Rangers fight them with swords, and big boys apparently don't wear bubbles even when their lives depend on them.I have no regrets about sitting through AFTER EARTH and more or less enjoyed it, but when the credits rolled, I was left thinking, ""There's a lot more they could have done with this.""",3,"""Danger is very real, but fear is a choice""",1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,1444,"['1,000', 'years', 'future', 'Earth', 'uninhabitable', 'humanity', 'malignant', 'blind', 'fear-smelling', 'aliens', 'invade', 'process', 'also', 'overrun', 'rabid', 'baboons', 'mutated', 'big', 'cats', 'gargantuan', 'condors', 'various', 'other', 'horrible', 'creatures', 'What', 'left', 'human', 'race', 'saved', 'Rangers', 'including', 'legendarily', 'fearless', 'General', 'Cypher', 'Will', 'Smith', 'transporting', 'stars', 'However', 'routine', 'father-son', 'bonding', 'expedition', 'Cypher', 'cadet', 'son', 'Kitai', 'Raige', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'who', 'failed', 'fear', 'test', 'young', 'boy', 'alien', 'invasion', 'just', 'been', 'denied', 'promotion', 'Ranger', 'find', 'crash-landed', 'Earth', 'once', 'again', '.AFTER', 'EARTH', 'watchable', 'science', 'fiction', 'thriller', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'decent', 'acting', 'storyline', 'solid', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'can', 'see', 'obvious', 'influences', 'not', 'as', 'derivative', 'many', 'contemporary', 'sf', 'films', 'lot', 'ho-hum', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'technology', 'Ships', 'can', 'travel', 'stars', 'matter', 'hours', 'are', 'completely', 'vulnerable', 'Sol', 'Asteroid', 'Belt', 'etc', 'guess', 'aliens', 'confiscated', 'guns', 'Rangers', 'fight', 'swords', 'big', 'boys', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'bubbles', 'even', 'when', 'lives', 'depend', 'them.I', 'have', 'regrets', 'sitting', 'AFTER', 'EARTH', 'more', 'less', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'done']",N/A

1560739,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B008JFUP8A,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 8]","AFTER EARTH (Writ. Will Smith, Dir. M. Knight Shyamalan, though actually co-directed by Will Smith, 2013, 100 minutes, PG-13) is a very derivative yet new kind of sci fi pleasure that I admit had me riveted and interested. One of the biggest shockers, I'll admit, was seeing it is a Shyamalan film. Only this time he couldn't hype it to death since this is Will Smith's baby--and it literally stars Will Smith's baby.Before I go on, be aware that this movie is nearly 100% Will Smith's handiwork. Shyamalan assisted him, but is credited as director while Smith, in fact, directed it. Smith wrote this but seems to me he got squeezed out of the credits you normally see in reviews. Watch the film's credits, you'll see who's whom.Set on another human-colonized planet 1,000 years from now, Will Smith plays Gen. Cypher Raige (OK, I know it smacks 100% of the comic book, but wait) of an elite corps of monster-alien eliminators. His beautiful real-life son Jaden plays his son Kitai, an ambitious, brave teen who is failing his cadetship.Since I wish not to spoil the actual story or lessons you can learn, I'll keep my review down to my own likings/observations:Will Smith is powerful here, and powerful scary too, even if his time on-film amounts to just over a cameo. Do not expect to see any Will Smith characterization you may be familiar with--he's newly born in this role. The wife thought he was channeling Samuel L. Jackson, while I said she was reading too much into Will Smith's excellent acting. You can't read too much into any one role by anyone.The effects, scenery and I may say the CGI are stunning. Just the best I have seen sinceJurassic Park. There is a breathtaking moment with Jaden standing at what looks to me like the cave paintings of Las Caux in France, and what he does there will stay with you forever.Jaden is really smartening up as an actor and hands in excellent work here. His youthful turn inThe Karate Kidwas excellent, and this is yet another wonderful stepping stone for Jaden. Since this is notThe Hunger Games, and I thank God for that, I was all the more pleased with the beauty and plucky courage of a teen who just wants his father back.One small problem I had was Shyamalan's camera following Jaden and focusing on him a bit too much. Sure, it was the crux of the story and I have nothing against that per se. Jaden is just gorgeous, prettier than his father when he first started in the business. It's just that with all the action and Jaden's extremely tight spacesuit, I felt there was an unwholesome tinge to it.In fact, I think the film turned a bit biased because Will Smith loves and is proud of his son. He's not going to take the camera off him! Well, that's just me, because the audience won't have time to think about that. I did think about it because let's face it, Jaden is one tremendously attractive kid and I had trouble keeping my eyes off him at all.You think I do not feel guilty as heck because of this voyeurism?! That is my point: the film gives the viewer little choice ... look at Jaden's body the whole time or look away and just listen to Will Smith's voice. And yet it works as a film, because, contrary to what you might now think of me, I'm no pervert and my mind is never in the gutter.

The media was so obsessed with the fact that Will Smith would have the audacity to appear onscreen with his son Jaden in a movie helmed by a ""failed"" director that they couldn't just enjoy ""After Earth"" for what it is. It's a sci-fi movie filled with action and suspense and a deeper meaning at its center.Enroute to another planet, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) and his father Cypher (Will Smith) must make an emergency crash-landing on one of the deadliest worlds in their solar system - Earth. The human race was forced to leave the planet after generations of destroying and depleting it of its natural resources. Left to its own devices, Earth has become a wild kingdom of dangerous and deadly plant and animal life. Their ship split in two, Kitai must make his way across dangerous terrain to recover an electronic signal which will call for a rescue team.""After Earth"" is about the relationship between a father and son. It shows how a father can have unreachable expectations for his offspring but mean well at the same time. It's also a movie about overcoming your fears and doing what you have to do to survive. Lastly, it shows one boy's journey to becoming a man - not because he wants to, but because he has to.Whether you want to admit it or not, every male child wants to win the approval of their father. ""After Earth"" captures this perfectly. Everything Jaden Smith's character does during his hero's journey is based upon what he thinks his father would do.I really don't understand where the animosity toward Jaden Smith comes from. He's actually quite a good little actor. The emotions he runs through in ""After Earth"" come across as genuine and his interactions with real and CGI characters and beasts are convincing. Again, I think the media wanted to hate this kid from the get-go and just spread the disease from one outlet to the next.The CGI and special effects in ""After Earth"" were well-executed for the most part. They weren't perfect by any means. There were parts you could tell were obviously digitally animated. However, for the most part everything looked good.""After Earth"" is rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and some disturbing images. I can't even recall there being any bad language in the film at all. I would suggest it for anyone over the age of 13 and can see where a father and son could use it as a portal to communicating with each other and bonding. Contrary to what many have said, I didn't picked up any strong or dangerous Scientology messages being thrown at audiences.The DVD version of ""After Earth"" contains a few entertaining special features. ""A Father's Legacy"" shows us Jaden and Will Smith working on and off-screen together. ""1,000 Years in 300 Seconds"" takes viewers behind the scenes and on location with the cast and crew. ""The Nature of the Future"" gives us an upfront and personal view of the landscapes used in the film. Jaden Smith introduces the winning video of a contest people entered called ""Xprize 'After Earth.'""""After Earth"" is a casualty of pre-conceived notions by the press. People responded to the film based on the fact that Will Smith was supposedly shoving his son down our throats in a movie made by a director who's hit a couple bumps in his career recently, but still has more good features under his belt than bad. Judged on its own, ""After Earth"" is a touching and action-packed sci-fi film with something to say about relationships between a father and son.",4,"""After Earth"" Utilizes Sci-Fi Genre to Exemplify Father/Son Dynamics",1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,3609,"['love', 'how', 'mainstream', 'press', 'influence', 'other', 'basically', 'end', 'up', 'writing', 'same', 'review', 'film', 'jumping', 'own', 'self-made', 'bandwagons', 'media', 'was', 'so', 'obsessed', 'fact', 'Will', 'Smith', 'would', 'have', 'audacity', 'appear', 'onscreen', 'son', 'Jaden', 'movie', 'helmed', 'failed', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'enjoy', 'Earth', 'what', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'suspense', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'center.Enroute', 'planet', 'Kitai', 'Raige', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'father', 'Cypher', 'Will', 'Smith', 'must', 'make', 'emergency', 'crash-landing', 'one', 'deadliest', 'worlds', 'solar', 'system', 'Earth', 'human', 'race', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'planet', 'generations', 'destroying', 'depleting', 'natural', 'resources', 'Left', 'own', 'devices', 'Earth', 'become', 'wild', 'kingdom', 'dangerous', 'deadly', 'plant', 'animal', 'life', 'ship', 'split', 'two', 'Kitai', 'must', 'make', 'way', 'dangerous', 'terrain', 'recover', 'electronic', 'signal', 'will', 'call', 'rescue', 'team', 'Earth', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'how', 'father', 'can', 'have', 'unreachable', 'expectations', 'offspring', 'mean', 'well', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'movie', 'overcoming', 'fears', 'doing', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'survive', 'Lastly', 'one', 'boy', 'journey', 'becoming', 'man', 'not', 'to.Whether', 'want', 'admit', 'not', 'male', 'child', 'win', 'approval', 'father', 'Earth', 'perfectly', 'Everything', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'character', 'hero', 'journey', 'based', 'what', 'father', 'would', 'do.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'where', 'animosity', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'little', 'actor', 'emotions', 'Earth', 'come', 'genuine', 'interactions', 'real', 'CGI', 'characters', 'beasts', 'are', 'convincing', 'Again', 'think', 'media', 'wanted', 'hate', 'kid', 'get-go', 'just', 'spread', 'disease', 'one', 'outlet', 'next.The', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'Earth', 'were', 'well-executed', 'most', 'part', 'were', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'means', 'were', 'parts', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'obviously', 'digitally', 'animated', 'However', 'most', 'part', 'everything', 'looked', 'good', 'Earth', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'violence', 'disturbing', 'images', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'there', 'being', 'bad', 'language', 'film', 'would', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'age', '13', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'father', 'son', 'could', 'use', 'portal', 'communicating', 'other', 'bonding', 'Contrary', 'what', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'strong', 'dangerous', 'Scientology', 'messages', 'being', 'thrown', 'audiences.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'Earth', 'few', 'entertaining', 'special', 'features', 'Father', 'Legacy', 'Jaden', 'Will', 'Smith', 'working', 'off-screen', 'together', '1,000', 'Years', '300', 'Seconds', 'viewers', 'scenes', 'location', 'cast', 'crew', 'Nature', 'Future', 'upfront', 'personal', 'view', 'landscapes', 'used', 'film', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'winning', 'video', 'contest', 'people', 'entered', 'called', 'Xprize', ""'After"", 'Earth', 'Earth', 'casualty', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'press', 'People', 'responded', 'film', 'based', 'fact', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'supposedly', 'shoving', 'son', 'down', 'throats', 'movie', 'made', 'director', 'who', 'hit', 'couple', 'bumps', 'career', 'recently', 'still', 'more', 'good', 'features', 'belt', 'bad', 'Judged', 'own', 'Earth', 'touching', 'action-packed', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'something', 'say', 'relationships', 'father', 'son']",N/A

1560751,A12IRGQLFE4EBA,B008JFUP8A,"Fabulinus ""To err is human. To forgive for no...","[1, 2]","This movie has been out long enough and there are enough online reviews that will give those who haven't yet seen it a basic synopsis, so I won't rehash the plot.  What I want to do is explain, in my humble opinion, why I believe this movie deserves at least 4 stars.  Also, I think some may be missing the point of the movie...First, is the overriding message of the movie which has nothing to do with space travel, creatures which have evolved to kill humans or trying to prove something to one's dad (lol).  The overriding message of this movie is understanding one's fear and through that understanding learning how to control it which is an excellent message for anyone... especially adolescence.  I think because of who's in it (name recognition) the movie catered to a specific demographic (adolescent boys or young men) who are usually in a 'fearless' stage of their lives and who don't understand the spiritual concept of fear.  Though I wished the scripting/dialog for Will Smith's character had done a bit more to explain what fear is, it at least did a good enough job that the average young person and adult could understand and resonate with it IF they were paying attention.  The concept of controlling one's fear in the beginning of the movie dragged a bit and seemed clich&eacute; and shallow, but towards the middle and the end it really popped.  While watching this movie I found myself reflecting on my own fears, thinking about how I choose to explain fear to my child and feeling a deep communion with the two main characters of this movie.  For a futuristic, drama laden, action adventure movie to have that kind of impact on me makes me sit up and take notice!Second, the father/son dynamic is very good here.  Perhaps that's because Will and Jaden Smith are actually father and son and have a healthy relationship?  I don't know, but it came through in spades.  Their chemistry was poignant and there were times when I could envision the two of them sitting at the dinner table interacting with each other similarly to how they portrayed their relationship on film.  I enjoyed that because I don't often see the same chemistry in other father/son dynamics on the big screen or on TV.  That aspect of the movie worked for me.Third, when was the last time you saw an African American father and son have any kind of positive, normal, familial dynamics at the movies?  Can't think of it, huh?  That's because it practically doesn't exist (lol)!  Usually, most African American family portrayals at the movies or on television are full of exaggerated buffoonery or they are so stereotypically negative and base that most viewers would think that Black Americans have no normal, positive, familial dynamics... especially fathers and sons.  This film shows a convincing and real contrast to what is usually thrown up in the average American's face about Black American families and that should only be viewed as a good thing!This movie moved me for the above reasons.  Yes, I do think the acting was a bit off (lol) and the beginning of the movie could have been a bit fuller, but overall I think the cast and crew of ""After Earth"" did a mighty fine job of putting together a thoughtful, action packed and well-grounded movie that, if reflected on, should not only keep the audience on the edge of their seats but make them think about the concept of fear being the wrong kind of motivator in theirs and possibly their children's lives.M.Night Shyamalan, who helped direct and produce this movie along with Will and Jada Smith, is one of my favorite directors and storytellers.  If you notice... again, if you're paying attention, all of his movies have one overriding concept in them:  understanding your fears and learning how to control them.Ya gotta think, people... don't let it go over your heads!

1560754,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUP8A,FNDNreview,"[15, 27]","The once highly acclaimed director, M. Night Shyamalan appears to have lost his mojo.  Of course, that's not a complete knock on the overall quality of his work or his imagination, but his recent films have been unmistakably disappointing.  After all, we are talking about the man that wrote the famous line, ""I see dead people"" for the highly acclaimed and much loved film, The Sixth Sense.  Since The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has been on a downward trend, but it did plateau for a few years with the release of Unbreakable, followed by the Signs.  However, Signs was nearly ten years ago, and the films he has directed in that decade long period since have been less than impressive, with a few of them bordering on downright terrible.  And, the sad fact is - he has to take the brunt of the criticism (even if they are box office success stories) for these films since he is the one that writes, directs, and produces the majority of them.  In any event, it would appear M. Night Shyamalan is due for a spellbinding recovery.  Did he achieve it with After Earth?After Earth takes place in the year 3000, long after humans decided to abandon the planet due to a series of cataclysmic events and repopulate across the galaxy.  On the established world of Nova Prime, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) is desperately trying to join the Ranger Corps to satisfy his father, Cypher Raige (Will Smith) - the strict general of the Ranger Corps.  Cypher believes his son is lacking discipline and decides to take him on his last adventure before retirement to spend some extra time with his son.  However,  their starship is damaged in an asteroid field, and they are forced to crash land on the Earth - a planet deemed to be chaotic and dangerous.  In the crash, the ship is separated into two halves, one of which contains an emergency distress beacon.  Cypher is badly hurt and it's unable to travel, so it's up to Kitai to travel alone across a dangerous Earth jungle to retrieve the beacon.  Sophie Okonedo and Zo Kravitz also star in supporting roles.You'd think a sci-fi story featuring one of the biggest names in Hollywood (Will Smith) would be an unbelievably great idea, right?  In this case, you'd be wrong.  Not only would you be wrong, you'd be dead wrong.  The fact is some ideas are best left in the think tank - the perfect example being the decision to cast Jaden Smith in a role that clearly required a much more seasoned actor to play the lead role.  Jaden Smith may one day become a tremendous actor, but he's not even close yet - and although he does show brief moments of exuberance, he's far too dull and uninteresting in this film.  He's derived of authentic emotion, and without that, this film's main character feels like he's just going through the motions.  It's difficult to pounce on such a young actor, but After Earth disappoints mightily due to the inexperience of Jaden Smith.Independence Day is still one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters out there to watch, not to mention the original Men in Black was pretty good, too.  However, the past doesn't always repeat itself in terms of success.  With that being said, Will Smith missed the mark this time around, but it wasn't due to a complete lack of effort.  Your star player will - more often than not - provide your offense, but when your star played is trapped inside a cockpit for the entirety of the film, it's probably not going to lead to a victory.  Forgive the sports metaphor, but Will Smith was not properly utilized in this film.  Yes, his character was injured for the film and was meant to be trapped, but that doesn't change the fact that he's really nothing more than a name in the credits or a simple advertising draw for this film.After Earth starts off at an utterly slow pace.  For about the first 20 minutes or so, the lack of a relationship between Cypher and Kitai is quickly established.  There's a great deal of tension in the air whenever these two are together, much of which stems from the death of Kitai's older sister, Senshi (Zo Kravitz), during an alien attack.  Next thing you know, they're both on a spaceship and there's a random asteroid field that severely damages the ship.  From there, After Earth is nothing more than a series of forced entertainment that is mostly uneventful.  Naturally, there has to be a protagonist in this film, and that comes in the form of some random over-sized creature that they just happened to have on-board the ship when it crashed.Overall, After Earth is too slow and uninteresting to sustain attention.  It features a slow developing plot that is too choppy and sporadic.  From the very beginning, the film feels like a watered down version of Aliens meets Predators.  The Smith father/son dynamic is heartwarming at first, but fails to meet the one simple criterion for a sci-fi thriller: provide interesting characters and excitement.  After Earth is not the worst movie, but it's nothing anyone should go out of their way to witness.  Feel free to skip this film without any hesitation.Final Grade:  DFNDNreview.com",1,Will & Jaden Smith crash and burn in 'After Earth',1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,5070,"['once', 'highly',

I understand that he was supposed to be the ""original ghost"" who could control his fear/emotions in order to be invisible to ""the enemy"" but that same emotionless demeanor extended to his entire performance and completely destroyed any chance to salvage the character and make him appear to be more human. I can only describe his acting as mechanical and uninteresting.Jaden Smith's performance puts a lie to the old saying that the nut doesn't fall far from the tree. I don't know what Jaden did to prepare for this role but it is obvious that whatever he did didn't work. From his ""acting"" I can only presume that Jaden only got this role because his father insisted on his son playing opposite of him or that any other actors who auditioned for the role was even worse than Jaden. Maybe tanking in this role will be a hidden blessing for Jaden. He'll either have to work very hard to improve his acting or he will realise that he lacks real talent and will persue other interests.While the acting was very lackluster the FX were not too bad.

Before getting kicked to the curb at this weekend's box office, M. Night Shyamalan had entertained a notion that AFTER EARTH would be the first in a projected trilogy. He had the same aspiration for AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER. But here's the deja vu train rolling in: the withering reviews, the limp word of mouth, the inflated expectations, the crap end product. Will Smith... oh, damn, man...It's another dystopian future. A thousand years from today, Earth is this abandoned place, long ago rendered uninhabitable by man's greed and obliviousness. Reinterpreting manifest destiny and left with no other recourse, man reached to the stars in a mass exodus; he spread out and colonized. Except that humanity's new settlements have fallen prey to the Ursa, frightening alien monsters that hone in on their victims' fear. A thousand years from today, Cypher Raige (Will Smith) is a Ranger and a living legend, his personal mythos built around his ability to quell his fear, thus rendering him invisible to the Ursa.Cypher's teenaged son, Kitai (Jaden Smith), desperately wants to be a Ranger. He's haunted by the death of his sister at the hands of the Ursa. When the Ranger Corps dismisses Kitai's application, Cypher tries to console his son by bringing him along on a space voyage. In these family bonding moments, no one anticipates an asteroid shower.Torn asunder, the broken spacecraft crashlands on a Class 1 quarantined planet: Earth. It's the most awful sort of homecoming. Terribly injured, Cypher dispatches his son to navigate the treacherous landscapes of Earth and recover the homing beacon located in the shorn tail end of their vessel. There's enough working tech that Cypher is able to remotely track and maintain communications with Kitai. Both learn soon enough that in the millennium that Earth's been left alone, evolution has not had a respite. Now, Kitai's Ranger skills will be put to the tes- oh, wait, that's right...Let's not mince words, AFTER EARTH is a misfire. It's an exercise in tedious plotting and poor pacing and wooden acting. I'm seriously contemplating giving up on Shyamalan. At least Uwe Boll hasn't let me down yet. There is such an unrelentingly somber tone; it weighs the film down. This is primarily a two-man show. Except a concern is settling in me, a passing judgment that maybe Jaden doesn't have the acting chops to carry on the Will Smith brand. With his pops relegated to the backseat, Jaden is asked to shoulder the load. I really don't want to be mean-spirited. I don't want to dis the kid. But he doesn't show me anything. Just tons of furrowed brow action.Should I mention the improbable science? One thousand years is a heck of a long time, but probably not long enough to produce the various mutated species that Kitai comes across. Or just how egregious were man's excesses that millennium ago?I get it that the weird accents were supposed to reflect the gradual shift in linguistics. But the accents just didn't click with me. It didn't help that both Will and Jaden gradually began to slip in and out of their accents. It's like Drew Barrymore from EVER AFTER all over again, only I liked that movie.I think it would've resonated more had Kitai stumbled across a decayed yet familiar landmark or two, just to hammer in that this really is f'ed-up future Earth. I'm not saying the Statue of Liberty half buried in sand or anything. But how about a desiccated Arby's or a really, really old Old Navy? As it is, absent of any ruined signposts to herald a once thriving human civilization, this story could just as well be taking place on an alien planet.The most damning thing of all is that the film fails to maximize its greatest weapon, which is Will Smith. The screenplay, in portraying Cypher Raige as this distant and rigid and monotone super-soldier, dispenses with Will's natural wit and lively personality. By the way, ""Cypher Raige?"" For real? That name ticks me off. He might as well have called himself ""Brock Bacardi"" or ""Dirk Destiny.""It feels indulgent. It feels like a vanity project. It feels like we're being exposed to an intrusive meta-statement of sorts. There's almost this element of voyeurism, as if we're paying to see the real-life Smiths play out their father-son therapy session on the big screen.

The overemphasis on science and technology, in this movie places the responsibility for the elimination of fear(in this case the 'pheromones"" produced by fear) solely on man's ego and reason.

Father and son could have communicated with walkie-talkies or mobile phones as the son had to seek help on his own due to his father being too weak to move.

I am not predisposed to comment on the value of a movie because of the use of African-Americans as one reviewer did. I am not sure that matters unless there is an actual context. Actors are actors... like humans are humans... Will Smith has an incredible amount of potential as an actor (not because of his ethnicity but because of his presence and skill)and his best work has yet to be seen. I do not feel he has become self actualized yet (Kurt G derivation of the term)... and so his best performances are ahead of him... just my opinion. One review suggested there may have been a use of Jaden Smith for the wrong reasons (rich daddy)... however... there was also a primary theme in this movie to show the bond of father and son and the coming of age story... so desperately lost on the current generation. So the real bond between Will and Jaden was leveraged in this movie and I found Jaden's performance more innocent and genuine than immature as suggested.As a pure Sci-fi with good CGI and an engaging storyline... this movie is a 4 and you will not be disappointed (despite all of the box office bomb reviews where people expect far more out of sci-fi than it is able to deliver). For the story-line it is a little predictable but still relatively unique. A father with a legendary ability to suppress emotions has been almost the savior of the human race against alien adversaries. His son is training to walk in his shoes (no surprises there), but of course they are big shoes to fill. On a trip planned to be an opportunity for them to get closer and bond... an accident causes a crash on a planet that goes back to human origins for this timeline... namely earth.

This time he's teamed with his son who is a chip off the old block(buster). Brace yourself!Scriptwriter Guillermo del Toro takes us to our planet 1,000 years after humans had to evacuate. Directed by M Night Shyamalan, this PG-13 thriller tells us that ""Danger is Real, Fear is a Choice."" I'm not sure how I feel about THAT, but it proves to be a key factor in the survival of our two intrepid travelers. The critters who are the most deadly, can smell fear; if you can control your fear you become invisible to them.We admire:* Will Smith (""Hancock""), who commands a space ship that crash lands on our deserted planet. Desperately hurt, he must depend on his son to reach the tail section of the space ship, which had broken off during the crash. The beacon to summon help is in that debris.* Jaden Smith (""Karate Kid"" 2010 ) is a young cadet (he wants to be a Ranger like his dad) who is tasked with a tough overland trek through dangerous terrain, nasty beasts, and hostile weather. Oh, and a dwindling reserve of supplies. He is frantic with fear.* Sophie Okonedo (Lots of BBC TV) is their lovely wife and mother; her sweetness and wisdom play perfectly here.* Zo Kravitz (""X-Men: First Class"") and yes, she's Lenny's daughter. Here she is daughter and sister to our heroes. She absolutely looks like a member of that family!This is basically a two-man show that is targeted for an audience that likes action, scary beasts and edge-of-the-seat thrills; the females are only here to provide motivation.

Beautiful landscapes and nicely done costumes and storyline.  I came to this movie not expecting anything but a good sci fi tale and that is what I got.  Then I google to read on the making of the movie as I was interested and found all these negative reviews which I do not understand at all.My only complaints with the movie are that I wished Will Smith did not take such an unemotional take on  his character, which I believe he did to emphasize his lack of fear but came off seemingly too deadpan.  What was needed was a more hard bitten warrior role and allowance for emoting, lack of fear doesn't mean lack of all the other emotions.  I felt Jaden Smith gave a great performance, you could feel he was really into the role, though  I thought a younger character would have engendered more of an emotional tug for the audience.Really, the movie wasn't the best out there but compared to recent blockbuster hideousness like Iron Man 3 it was well done.  Shyamalan is still one of  my favorite directors some of whose films I continually go back to view, I love his subtlety in directing.

Will Smith was excellent in the role.  He played a loving father who knew in order to save his son and his own life he had to let go of the emotional ""father role"" and become his son's commander and teacher.  The special effects where top notch and both Will Smith and his son did excellent acting in the movie.  I do hope there is a sequel where Will Smith is more involved in some of the action scenes.  Unfortunately, many moviegoers rated this movie low on the ratings scale.  Anyone who did not like this movie needs to ask him or herself why?  Was it too educational for you?  It seems to bother moviegoers (even African Americans) whenever black actors drop the ""colored-folk"" stereotypes and step into a different genre of acting. I say, why should Will Smith mold himself into a stereotypical actor...speaking the same old dialogue and phonical diction that most movie goers hear from black actors.  ""Oh, no, yawl, not gonna..."" etc, etc.  Movie audiences love films like ""This is the End"" where producers show a bunch of bodies spewing blood all over the place and clog every scene of the film with curse words.  If people were truly honest with themselves they would ask, Why are there so many gory, horror movies?  Why do our society gravitate toward films filled with sadomasochistic sex against men, women and children?  I know it is a reflection of what is happening in our society.

1560814,A14BZTVDPG8UL7,B008JFUP8A,jeffreywp,"[0, 1]","Ok, my wife rolled her eyes when she saw I brought this home from our local library to watch the other night. Sometimes she's right; sometimes not. This time the eye-rolling was well deserved.I found the movie to be rather disjointed with father and son having flashbacks about one incident concerning a 19 y/o daughter/sister. This incident is supposed to be pivotal for both characters but never really cuts it for me. Ok, I get it: dad feels like then 9 y/o son should have attacked the alien after watching it kill his older sister and the son feels like dad should have been there to protect them both. In the end, though, I just didn't feel emotionally connected to either of these two main characters. Actually, I enjoyed the mom most of all and she was only in the film for 10 minutes or so. She was the only one with any kind of emotional depth. The father, played by Will Smith, is stereotypical military dad who is emotionally withdrawn from his children, in this case his son. The son, played by Will Smith's son Jaden, is likewise stereotypical 'I'm-somewhat-emotionally-sensitive-and-my-father-doesn't-understand-me-and-I'm-going-to-hold-him-accountable-for-the-psychological-pain-I'm-in."" And, the pain his son feels from this emotionally distant father isn't adequately explained either. Once again, I get it: father is military hero and son wants to be like his dad and in the end they both seem to learn something from one another. But, like I said, it's a choppy story at best.The movie never did a satisfying job explaining many things. For instance, how did we develop so quickly technologically for interstellar travel and yet could not repel aliens with anything other than these special staffs that, for all intents and purposes, are little more than swords? Additionally, the movie doesn't explain whether we were still at war with these aliens because it certainly didn't seem like we were. The father takes his son on his ship like it was 'take your kid to work day' and then, BOOM! the boy has to fight for his life back on Earth where everything has evolved to kill humans. The sense of urgency in this movie was centered around these creatures--in this case, just one that crash landed with everybody else. This creature could smell the pheromones we excreted when we were afraid. Ironically, for being a creature who is such an effective killer it took the thing a painfully long amount of time to find the kid. And, someone please explain to me why we didn't develop suits that made it impossible to smell those pheromones so we could wipe out all of the alien creatures?The technology is very elegant and engaging, but other than that this movie left me wanting a whole lot more. Will Smith's son, Jaden, tries to make it all work and he has his moments but just couldn't carry the movie for me. So, I'd pass on this one if I were you. At least in Shamalan's other alien take-over movie, Signs, there was a sense of mystery and suspense. I could enjoy the characters and forgive some of the inconsistencies in the plot.

But, I really like Will Smith, and his sci-fi movies are always solid, so I took a chance. I'm glad I did.I think this movie catches a lot of fallout from the director. I didn't even know it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan until the end credits rolled. I am not his biggest fan by any means, but he has done his fair share of good movies and pretty bad movies. And The Last Airbender. As someone who didn't even follow the anime, that movie was still atrocious. So I think people see he is working on a movie and already form a negative opinion of that movie.If you watch the movie without expectations, it's a pretty good father/son bonding story in a sci-fi setting, with survival elements thrown in. It dragged a bit in two spots that probably could have been edited better, but it was otherwise enjoyable. The effects are good, and I liked the technology direction they chose, basing the ship and equipment on organic and paper-like substances.Will Smith and his son share equal screen time, but most of the action scenes are Jaden's.

Night Shyamalan about a military father (Will Smith) and his teenage son (Jadon Smith) crash land on Earth one thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity to abandon Earth for a new home planet. The son must save his dying father and himself by trekking alone across hostile terrain pursued by evolved predators and an alien beast to recover a rescue-beacon.After hearing about all the bad reviews and this movie tanking at the theater, I didn't have high expectations of this movie. With that being said, this movie was better than I expected, which isn't saying a lot as I still think the movie was not that great.The movie was slow and dull and moved along like a duck stuck in the mud. The action was sparing and mostly dumb with a giant eagle and some animals that looked like they belonged in the zoo as opposed to being some villainous animals. Even the Usar or whatever they called it was a poorly conceived computer generated creature. There are no weapons or suits that could defend against this creature?? Seriously?? Add on some nonsensical weather just to top it off as well that is never explained and an alien war that is also left unexplained.The acting was some of the worst I have seen from not only Jaden Smith (which I expected) but also Will Smith which surprises me. I normally like most of Will Smith's movies with ""I am Legend"" being one of my favorites but it almost seemed that Will Smith was trying to find his inner Laurence Fishbourne slash Matrix impression with his monotone lack of emotion almost reading of his lines acting. But his acting wasn't as bad as his son's who was not believable in the role and surprisingly enough had no chemistry with his own father in the movie. I can understand that Will Smith was trying to promote his son's acting career but Please please please, Mr. Smith do not do any more movies that include you and your son. Jaden Smith is not ready for prime time as a main character and should try perfecting his craft in smaller roles outside of his father's limelight and this movie idea brought to life by M Night was not a way to do it.The positives about the movie is that the scenery in the movie was pretty and had nice scenic locations and the special effects were decent with the exception of the poorly conceived monster. And I get the message that the movie was trying to send in the father son relationship which accounts for 2 stars as opposed to one. But by the time the movie ended, I didn't care about the characters as they were poorly developed and lacked any emotion. Nor did I care what happened at the conclusion by the time I got to the end.A shame though as this could have had a lot of potential but M. Night and Smith blew it on this one.

1560841,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B008JFUP8A,Kathy W,"[31, 50]","Although many people did not seem to like this 2013 movie, I thought it was decent.  OK, it was no award winner, but I enjoyed it and did not feel like I wasted my time (hour and a half approximately) or money.  It was obviously a Smith family film, with Will and son Jaden acting, Will and M. Night Shyamalan on the writing team, and Jada Pinkett Smith on the production team.  If I saw right, it was filmed in Costa Rica, Utah, and Southern California.The time period is long after planet Earth (hence, the title ""After Earth"") has become desolate, and long after the aliens who fed on humans have eradicated the human race on Earth.  We meet the Rangers, a military command from another planet.  Young Jaden is a Ranger Cadet, but seems to have some issues and just cannot achieve Ranger status.  I believe they are fear issues holding young Jaden back.I am guessing that Jaden is supposed to be around age 15 or so in the movie.  He has spent most of his life growing up without his dad, because dad was away on Ranger duty.  Jaden blames himself for his sister's death, so he is carrying heavy baggage.  When Will comes home, and before he retires, he takes Jaden off on a trip with him, to spend some guy-time together.  The plane hits an unexpected asteroid field and is forced to land on Earth, which is a dangerous place to be.  (All of this happens in the beginning of the film.)  The plane breaks in two pieces, about 100 kilometers apart and since Will is injured, Jaden must travel alone, but with Will guiding him from the ship.  The objective is to retireve a working distress beacon from the distant wreckage section and send the emergency signal for help.Although the first part of the movie is a bit slow, Jaden's journey is where it takes off.  I would love to say more, but you have to watch the movie now.  The CGI was pretty neat as they successfully blended it with holograms, bio-technology, scenery, and animatronics.  Although young Jaden's performance was not exceptional, I thought he did a good job. He played a young man who needed to listen, learn, and face his fears. I believe the movie captures that nicely.There are some great underlying messages in this storyline, the most penetrating being Will Smith saying to Jaden, ""Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.""  Will goes on to explain in a simple paragraph that fear is an illusion which does not benefit us and we must choose how we respond to it.  He explains to Jaden that he must ""live in the moment"" and that fear is a projection of future events that might never even happen.  THESE ARE VERY WISE WORDS.  There are also parts of the movie that imply the son is reading his father's mind.  You will also see the father has taught his son to stop, ground, and center himself.  There is also an amazing scene where one of nature's creatures repays a debt to Jaden.  Let me also mention the underlying message that the earth has become desolate because we failed to take care of it.Nice movie. I do plan to buy the video when it comes out and watch it again.  I think the lesson about fear is priceless.  And although some reviews seem to want to bust Jaden out for not being as good as his father, I think the boy played his part well. When you watch the movie, I believe you will see that was part of the concept.  Instead of having a seasoned actor go out into the forbidden area, the boy character stretched himself to achieve above and beyond his fears and that added much to the story.  Actually, the more I think of the embedded messages in this movie, the more I like it.  Wouldn't it be great if we could all teach our children ""Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.""6/9/13 - On a side note, yesterday, I found myself starting to worry about something and suddenly heard Will Smith's words to his son again.  He reminded me that fear is an illusion of the mind, where you are wasting time and energy getting upset over something that may never happen.

I had high hopes for this movie as I'm a fan of post apocalyptic movies and futuristic movies.  Adding Will Smith's good acting to the mix had me thinking this was a sure hit.  Unfortunately-the movie follows his son Jaden Smith, whose acting skills are less than stellar.  Will Smith does start out in the movie with a majority of the scenes but 15 minutes into the film and his exposure is cut to a him communicating with his son through basically a wrist walkie talkie.  He is not involved in any of the action sequences in the movie and Jaden Smith's acting skills are not developed enough to carry a movie in my opinion. I can only assume he was cast in this movie as a favor to his father.  Will's performance as a strict futuristic military type father is just ok as his character is supposed to come across as a very strict-almost unfeeling father and yet it's just stiff acting at best.  And again-Jaden Smith's acting is just not all that good in my opinion.  He just lacks believability to me but he's young and I have hopes he'll master the trade as his father did.While there are a few ""creatures"" in the movie-so much more could have been done with the premise of this movie yet the focus was generally on Jaden Smith's character rather than diving into the evolving of creatures on this planet.  If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action and sci-fi special effects-there are a few but this film falls short of what they could have done with this storyline.  If you're looking for a film with a deep meaning intertwined with the plot-this is not it.  If you're expecting another great film showcasing Will Smith's impressive range for acting-this is not it.What you'll get is a movie starring Jaden Smith and a few shots of Will Smith as he speaks to his son through the radio communication device (so you hear his voice a lot).  It's not an awful movie but not the best and definitely not worthy of box office prices.  At best this is a rental-but keep in mind that you will watch this and realize there were better rentals available.Just for reference-I'm not a picky reviewer and like a lot of films that seem to get bad reviews.

This is Will Smith playing a no nonsense military officer.  There was absolutely NO emotion shown.  This was the type of character that if an arm or leg was ripped off and blood was spurting everywhere, he would do nothing more than grimace or grunt a little.  A little unreal.  Especially for Will Smith. To me, his talent was stifled.As for Jaden, I felt like he was just an average actor.  He doesn't grip like a lead actor, which I believe he was supposed to be.  A few years and acting lessons or experience, he may well be a star.  I'm not trying to sound critical.  I just think he was a bit out of his acting league at this point.As for M Night Shyamalan, I didn't feel his touch.  From my understanding, he came to the picture very late in the game.  The production team seemed to be Smith this and Smith that . . . I wonder how much control Shyamalan had.  I don't know if this should be labeled as ""Shyamalan's baby.""  Unfortunately, as average as this movie is, I figure he will get the blame rather than the credit.  I don't think it's going to stop his directing/writing, etc., but I think he will have to reestablish himself and won't get big money financing easily.

The premise was interesting but there were serious problems with the science.I'll try not to give away too much of the plot.First there was the idea of the asteroid storm. I understand the idea that the space ship's drive deformed the fabric of space and could disturb local objects such as asteroids. However, it seems unlikely that the mass of the ship would cause a deep enough gravity well to cause a cloud of asteroids to smash into the ship.  It reminded me of an old Flash Gordon episode, though the special effects were much better.Second, the idea that 1000 years had passed since humanity had left earth seems far too short a period of time for the evolution and spread of the diverse life forms portrayed. Here again, the CGI is good.As for the acting: Jaden Smith did an excellent job with the physical aspects of his performance. However, he needs to mature a bit so that he can bring a richer emotional range to his characters. A good start.Will Smith is one of my favorite actors but in this movie I got the impression at times that he was phoning it in.To be fair, the characters that Will and Jaden portray are emotionally walled off and perhaps their performances were shaped by the script and director.

1560875,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B008JFUP8A,MacheteJason,"[7, 12]","* SPOILER WARNING *Overall I blame M. Night Shyamalan for this failed project. IMDB ratings show an astounding 4.8 where Evil Dead (remake) manages a 6.5. Wow. So if you were looking for a cool sci-fi movie with scares and action you might find this somewhat bland. This is no Alien. It is surreal, thudding and insomnia-curing at times. There isn't any other way to describe it because the performances are average, the dialogue is full of one-liners (when we hear it), the special effects are average and the story was below average. MNS fails to expand his premise in any meaningful way (a problem that has plagued him recently). Earth is now very dangerous and poisonous but must be traversed by the father and son team of The Smiths after their spaceship lands on Earth. Will and Jaden Smith are good but we don't see much of Will Smith. He is injured and unable to accompany his son for most of the movie. When Will Smith does get screen time (he is a supporting actor at best) he doesn't make the impact he could preferring to let Jaden take the spotlight. The focus on Jaden is OK but he can't do it all by himself with only the environment to interact with. The movie has surprisingly little mood which is normally the strength of the director. There isn't even much action to keep the story going. This is sci-fi/drama. It's just Jaden fighting creatures and getting hurt by nature itself. The Smiths will fight another day but MNS's career has been on the decline. Domestic gross, which is still a key benchmark for many studios, is about half of the budget. In America where you are expected to make your money back on day one (or the weekend if you're slow) then After Earth has bombed financially, critically and with audiences. For a much better Smith film, check out I Am Legend, Men in Black or Independence Day.

1560883,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008JFUP8A,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Movies have made some incredible science fiction films in the past. Everything from FANTASTIC VOYAGE to THE MATRIX  have displayed various worlds and dimensions that living in the real, normal world we never get to go to. Far off planets, microscopic worlds and the land of imagination are available on film. Movies have been done to warn us of the dangers we impose on our own world if we don't change our ways like SILENT RUNNING. While AFTER EARTH appears to be part of that sub-genre at first, it steers clear of heading down that path in exchange for another.In the future the Earth has been so contaminated by man that survivors are placed in space ships and shuttled to a new universe to live in, hopefully not making the same mistakes. But a bigger problem follows when an inhospitable alien race tries to wipe man out by sending in bug like creatures called ursas that find humans by smelling the pheromones we emit when we fear something. A select group of soldiers known as Rangers develop a way to stop their fear thus making them invisible to these creatures so we stand a fighting chance against them. The leader of this group and most controlled is Cypher Raige (Will Smith).Gone from home for some time and having lost his daughter to an ursa attack, Raige is ready to retire. At the same time his son Kitai (Jaden Smith) is in training at the academy, pushing himself as much as possible to live up to the legend that is his father. Both seem to have disconnected somewhere down the line. In an attempt to shore up that divide, Raige asks his son to accompany him on his last mission, a simple transport that includes a captured ursa.But things don't go as planned and caught in an asteroid storm the ship is damaged and forced to land on a restricted planet. That planet is Earth. When Kitai wakes after the ship crashes he finds that he and his father are the only two survivors even though his father is severely wounded with 2 broken legs. Their ship was broken in two, their homing beacon damaged and now the only chance they have is for Kitai to reach the other half of the ship to turn on the homing beacon there.While the adventure aspect of the film ties into what Kitai faces while making the near 100 mile trek to the other half of the ship, the film revolves more around the dynamic between father and son as they first come to terms with their problems and secondly must learn to trust one another as Cypher guides Kitai to the other half of the ship while trying to stay alive. This back and forth between father and son that must be solved for them both to make it, a slow process that sees them rebuild their connection is what makes up most of the film.This is not to say that the film doesn't have several problems to overcome. To begin with the pacing is slow at times which makes it more a movie where we get to see images of a future redeveloped earth and its animal inhabitants instead of getting more story. Will Smith, confined to a seated position for the entire film, plays Cypher as an emotionally detached man who not only hides his fear but every other emotion as well which gets kind of boring after a time.The person who will take most of the criticism for this film (and has from fans already) is Jaden Smith. A young actor with few parts to his credit already is bound to have those attacks, increased by some who scream nepotism on the part of his father.

There is no story except the kid trying to prove to his overbearing militaristic father; he is not a coward. It is all based on his fathers failure to give him assurance & parental support. The kid has a permanent whiny expression & tone throughout the entire movie. This kid constantly whines about everything.I liked many of M Night's earlier movies. But remember Swartzenegger's &#34;Last Action Hero?&#34; You can't have a major star on the sidelines of a kid actor in any movie. It would go bad regardless of the theme & the kid ends up the target of the audience's anger at being cheated from seeing the star in action.Even when things are going good, Jaden is whining & wearing that crybaby expression until the very end. It seems to be the only expression he knows. I'll bet he also has it at home. He needs to find some non confrontational career but nothing with Customer support or critical systems where he would be under pressure. This kid cannot withstand pressure. Perhaps a job at HP or working on camera crews. But he does not have the Stamina or personality to be an actor. He may be able to act but he won't survive the politics of Hollywood without a driving personality. The parents need to back off the pressure on this kid. He can't take it. They might drive him to drugs if they don't back off. He doesn't have the stamina for acting. Fathers are very bad about overdriving sons. They should just provide positive support on what he is good at & stop pushing him to compete with his dad. This is a common problem with children of parents who are larger than life in their careers. Take it from our experience. He doesn't have his father's drive or capability IRL & it will end up badly if pushed.As for the lack of storyline, I really get tired of sci-fi movies with nothing but battles or scary creatures or aliens. I want a story with what events happened to cause those conditions; discoveries of ruins & survivors (not living in some dark caves) using ingenuity to survive in uplifting stories without constant creatures.Remember &#34;Robinson Crusoe on Mars?&#34; Despite the dumb title, it was very engrossing as to how he learned to overcome obstacles to survive. Remember the clues & final revelation of the original Planet of the Apes? That was sci-fi at its best.Stories about discovering a surviving underground society on Mars would also be a good story as long as someone doesn't turn it into a creature battle or Warring civilizations or vicious prometheus aliens or some sick irradiated society like they created on Beneath Planet of the Apes & Battle for&#34;.A deep thinking story on survival & society working together and positive alien societies would be nice. I'm sick of the violence with no story. I'm sick of violence & gore period. Also sick of dark, dank, grungy sets.&#34;Oblivion&#34; was a nice clean, technology sci-fi with a great storyline for a change.

However, this turned out to be an incredibly enjoyable Sci-Fi Action Fantasy film. The film is just GORGEOUS to behold in GRAINLESS! 4K Blu-ray 1080p MPEG-4 AVC. Shot, as was Oblivion, with the new Sony F65 4K-8K cameras. I can't wait for ""film grain"" to give up the ghost. Films like Life of Pi and After Earth make you feel like you are right there in the story. The picture is so life like. It's so cool to be blown away by all the fine details that catch your eye too. There so much detail that you are still discovering new stuff on subsequent viewings. Just beautiful like Life of Pi which was shot with the Arri Alexa Digital cameras. Top that off with an incredible DTS 5.1 Master Audio Soundtrack and it's impossible not to enjoy the movie. We don't have the best theaters here in Montana, so I'm so glad I waited to watch it as a fully maximized Blu-ray presentation on my home theater.I found the story quite engaging too. So much so, that I couldn't wait to get back inside after taking my puppy out at 4AM to get back to the movie. I found for me that MNS films are best enjoyed late at night when it's dead quiet and totally dark. That is because his films have so much invested in the cinematography and especially the soundtrack. As such, all my attention could be focused 100% in the movie.From everything I had read about After Earth, I was expecting to see just a glimpse of Will Smith with 99% of the film being all Jaden. I guess all the bashers didn't see the same film I did... There was just the right amount of back and forth between father and son to get me emotionally invested in the characters and their dilemna. Yes there were a couple of times I wish I could of reached in and slapped some sense into the kid, but hey, that is what teenagers are really like! And sure, it's a cornball totally predictable plot, but it's easily enjoyable if you can let all that go and just get into the story. As such, it's a good sci-fi film for the youngsters.I think Jaden Smith has had his best performance so far in After Earth. He did a good job portraying the confused, conflicted, unsure, and frightened teenager he was supposed to be. It was also nice to see some more serious dramatic acting by Will Smith too.

1560903,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUP8A,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","Spoilers ahead.I avoided this movie when it first arrived primarily due to being busy and the fact that it was getting ravaged by critics.  Being a sci-fi fan and also a fan of Will Smith I decided to take a shot.  Is it really so awful?  Well, it's not very good but it's not terrible on Blu ray either.  What it is, is another mess and missed opportunity by director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan.  The story (by Will Smith) had some promise.Set in the distant future, a thousand years or so after the Earth was all but destroyed for human habitation.  Cypher Raige (Will Smith) is a general in charge of space exploration or some such thing.  He's a big shot on the planet where Earthlings were evacuated to, those many years ago.  He's married and has a teenage son, Kitai (Jaden Smith) who is trying to get through ""Ranger"" training.  He's athletic but like all teens of his age, impatient and well, dumb sometimes.  The father-son relationship is strained and distant.  We learn this is due to the loss of a daughter and sister (Zoe Kravitz in flashback scenes) years earlier as she tried to fight off some giant monster-thing protecting her young brother.At the coaxing of wife Faia (Sophie Okonedo), Cypher makes an effort to improve the relationship with Kitai.  This leads to the lad accompanying his dad on a deep space mission.  After encountering a fierce meteor storm, their ship breaks apart and crashes on a dangerous planet.  Yep, Earth.  It is now inhabited only by wild animals and subject to wide fluctuations in temperature.  The rest of the story involves the severely injured Cypher directing his son to find his way to the aft part of the ship, located a hundred miles away.  That is where the rescue beacon can be launched for the search party.Although the entire crew has been killed in the crash (but for our two heroes) and there is no way to communicate with the home planet, the electronics and cameras in the front part of the ship where the Raiges have survived, work locally!  So Cypher can watch and help Kitai on his hazardous journey.  Huh?  Kitai runs into all kinds of trouble of course, having to fight off baboons and eventually the monster-thing who was being transported on the ship and is now loose on Earth.  Oh, and both Cypher and Kitai have some kind of ""ghosting"" ability that has to do with controlling fear or something.Shyamalan's string of movies seem to get worse with each release.  ""After Earth"" is but a continuation.  While the film looks great, there is little tension or worry that Kitai will accomplish his mission.  While rated PG-13 for ""action violence and disturbing images (the monster-thing), the film could have easily been rated PG and worn a Disney badge.The 4K 1080p Blu ray transfer is as good as it gets.  With much of the film shown on an Earth with mostly wooded or jungle like locals, the colors really pop.  Beautiful greens and blues.  The digitally created animals look great.  Detail is superb.  Likewise the audio is spectacular.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track rages with thunderous opening sequence that involves all the speakers.  The dialog is beautifully translated, clear and accurately centered.  Certainly no complaints with the way the film looks or sounds.

1560916,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B008JFUP8A,Nathan T.,"[3, 6]","I'm a pretty easy going person and I approached this movie not expecting too much. I'll just go straight to the critiques. For those that haven't watched the movie, I'll try to censor the spoilers:Pros:- A lot of people felt Jaden Smith's acting to be not so good, but I thought most of the scenes that he was in was okay (in other words...I was expecting it, especially after seeing the Karate Kid which I didn't like either). I see some improvement in his acting and I too wish he would one day become as talented as his father. I'm a Will Smith fan and I mainly watched this movie for Will Smith but I was willing to give his son a chance. I understand that Will Smith is trying hard to give his son a strong chance in the acting career, he's doing everything a father can do to give his kids the leverage that they need. He loves his family and he's doing what he can and I admire that. Being a bystander, sometimes we are quick to criticize him of stuff like nepotism but he's a father that's a famous actor, what did you expect? Any father would probably do the same.- I'm not yet much of a Jaden Smith fan, but seeing him in this movie definitely made me think of Will Smith and there were scenes where I did feel that charismatic presence coming from his son. I don't think his son will be as fun to watch as his father but I hope he proves me wrong.Cons:- I'm going to flat out and say I blame this film's mediocrity not on Jaden Smith but on M. Night Shyamalan. I think most of M. Night's movies are overrated.- The narration with Jaden Smith in the beginning didn't feel right. His voice moves me AWAY from the movie.- The trailer shows pretty much all the action scenes. Many times I feel like the person that made the trailer should be the person that makes the movies, it's just so much more exciting. The better the trailer and/or the more action scenes they show in the trailer, the more you expect the film to be not so great. They're desperate for advertisement that they're basically throwing everything good about the movie into the trailer to hype up the potential moviegoers.- The planet that they land on, don't expect a world you haven't seen before, or creative interesting sci fi creatures. Eagles, lions, apes, even the plant life. Only the Ursa is different from the rest and even they're not that creative (they look like what you see in Lord of the Ring). This was one big reason why I was disappointed. I was expecting a fantasy world, but pretty much everything that's seen in the trailer is everything you'll see in the movie pretty much.- SPOILER ALERT thereisascenewhereheisalmostfrozenaftertheraftscene. And he gets saved by an eagle that is smart enough to drag him into a hole and then cover up the hole with foliage AND THEN spread itself out over the spot in order to keep Kitai (Jadan) alive? Yeah F right haha...why would the eagle also remain on the ground and not fly off with Kitai instead?- Alright we just have to bring up the Ursas. The blind creatures that can smell human pheromones when humans are scared. The movie doesn't really explain what made them such a threat to human kind. They're just introduced as large creatures that smell human fear and go after them, but they don't look special or anything. Cypher Raige (Will Smith) took out one with one swipe to the throat, they didn't seem special. The movie just doesn't elaborate on it. Also, if they can smell human fear that comes off our bodies, what about people in another room or people in suits that are airtight? I'm just watching the movie and it makes no sense as to why they're so fearful. Giant monsters...got it.- Will Smith's part is lacking in this movie, you can tell he tries to leave the significant parts to his son. Will Smith's acting is also toned down, not sure exactly why but it didn't capture me like it usually does (or maybe I just wasn't in the mood or something).There are other complaints but I'll leave it here, the main ones are covered I believe.

It may be cute from a 4 year old, but for a supposed professional actor I think not.There are also more plot holes than the wrecked spaceship ended up with, such as....1. Even though seats on the ship were full on take off, they were completely empty except for the young Smith during the crash, where were these people and why weren't they strapped into what ended up being the safest part of the ship?2. Our decendants obviously master spaceflight but have lost the ability to use projectile weapons.  Not a single ranged weapon to be seen anywhere, and oh wouldn't it have been fantastic to have a rifle or two in the emergency kits.3. Did I say kits?  I'm wondering why there weren't more than one set of breathing aids available for the young Smith to take with him on his journey, and why not take one of the masks that seemed to work so wonderfully before the breathing aids were introduced.  Oddly enough though the breathing aids were all over the wrecked tail section of the craft.There were many many more issues with the story, but I don't believe that anyone needs to dig very deep to see that this is a horribly flawed production that would have done better with different actors, a different writer, and almost any other director.

You mostly see it in the horror genre (specifically, zombie movies). This movie incorporates Zen-like philosophy (which people have falsely labeled as Scientology propaganda), as well as interesting and seemingly-plausible futuristic technology. Will and Jaden Smith do a fantastic job of portraying a necessarily militant future, and both play interesting characters with more depth than a lot of reviews give them credit for. Will Smith is on another level from other actors, and his son seems to be picking up his father's style of learning and acting. I won't go into specific details for the movie, but it is well worth watching if you enjoy the genre.

I've seen a lot of folks lambast Will Smith here in the reviews for supposedly ""promoting"" his son Jayden, etc.  I don't see it that way.  I think there was a story to be told here with a boy at the heart of the story and the role just happened to be filled by Jayden Smith.  I personally think Jayden did a serviceable enough job and I don't have any issues with his real life dad playing his on screen dad.  I think it was a good fit.What took me out of the movie though were some poor choices that really didn't make sense (spoilers ahead) The most obvious one was the ridiculous and pointless Southern accents.  There really wasn't any explanation at all as to why the characters even had Southern accents, let alone the fact that they really, REALLY couldn't pull them off convincingly.  It was more like listening to a parody of a southern accent.  I was also put off a little by Will's hard a$$ father character.  Yeah, yeah-I know it makes sense to have a stern father that can be made to respect the son by the son proving himself, but his portrayal of this character went beyond just stern (or fearless) into robot territory.  Showing a little humanity might've helped a person actually like the character more instead of thinking he's a complete jerk 99% of the movie.  Also-and this is probably my biggest gripe, you set up a story with the whole theme to be a son proving his worth as a man in his father's eyes, then when it's all said and done and the son has at last proven himself worthy, you go and throw it all away with one line. ""I think I'd rather work with mom"".  It sounds like a petty gripe in the scheme of things and the line does earn a laugh but everything the boy been through, everything he's done to earn his stripes is thrown right out the window.  It just makes the whole adventure seem suddenly pointless.I think folks have been a little harsh in their criticisms of After Earth as it truly does have some merit.  It's beautifully shot, it tells a compelling story, the special effects (for the most part) are pretty convincing and it's fairly unique.  I just think a few poor choices soured an otherwise entertaining experience.  I doubt the film would've earned such hatred if M. Night would've ghost directed this film under a different name.  Granted he's earned some of that animosity, but on it's own merits-the direction of After Earth is just fine.",3,Some poor choices ruin an otherwise decent movie,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,2732,"['Remove', 'knowledge', 'brain', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'who', 'career', 'sadly', 'been', 'major', 'downward', 'spiral', 'past', 'decade', 'directed', 'film', 'view', 'open', 'mind', 'Earth', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'even', 'seen', 'recently', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'Saturday', 'night', 'viewing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'folks', 'lambast', 'Will', 'Smith', 'here', 'reviews', 'supposedly', 'promoting', 'son', 'Jayden', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'think', 'was', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'here', 'boy', 'heart', 'story', 'role', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'filled', 'Jayden', 'Smith', 'personally', 'think', 'Jayden', 'did', 'serviceable', 'enough', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'issues', 'real', 'life', 'dad', 'playing', 'screen', 'dad', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'fit.What', 'took', 'movie', 'were', 'poor', 'choices', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'most', 'obvious', 'one', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'pointless', 'Southern', 'accents', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'explanation', 'why', 'characters', 'even', 'had', 'Southern', 'accents', 'let', 'alone', 'fact', 'really', 'REALLY', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'convincingly', 'was', 'more', 'listening', 'parody', 'southern', 'accent', 'was', 'also', 'put', 'off', 'little', 'Will', 'hard', 'father', 'character', 'Yeah', 'yeah-I', 'know', 'sense', 'have', 'stern', 'father', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'respect', 'son', 'son', 'proving', 'portrayal', 'character', 'went', 'just', 'stern', 'fearless', 'robot', 'territory', 'Showing', 'little', 'humanity', 'might', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'person', 'actually', 'character', 'more', 'instead', 'thinking', 'complete', 'jerk', '99', '%', 'movie', 'Also-and', 'probably', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'whole', 'theme', 'be', 'son', 'proving', 'worth', 'man', 'father', 'eyes', 'then', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'son', 'last', 'proven', 'worthy', 'go', 'throw', 'away', 'one', 'line', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'work', 'mom', 'petty', 'gripe', 'scheme', 'things', 'line', 'earn', 'laugh', 'everything', 'boy', 'been', 'everything', 'done', 'earn', 'stripes', 'thrown', 'right', 'window', 'just', 'whole', 'adventure', 'seem', 'suddenly', 'pointless.I', 'think', 'folks', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'harsh', 'criticisms', 'Earth', 'truly', 'have', 'merit', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'compelling', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'fairly', 'unique', 'just', 'think', 'few', 'poor', 'choices', 'soured', 'otherwise', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'doubt', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'such', 'hatred', 'M.', 'Night', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ghost', 'directed', 'film', 'different', 'name', 'Granted', 'earned', 'animosity', 'own', 'merits-the', 'direction', 'Earth', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

Lazaroff ""Book lover""","[1, 2]","After Earth, considered to be one of the worst science-fiction movies of the year, decade, century, whatever...pro reviewers are paid to write not actually SEE the movies they write about. I watched this flick four times, and yes, I could watch it four more with little or no difficulty. Why? First, it's about the most important factor to human survival - family. A father and son standing apart until fate makes them see one another in a different light. On a planet where everything evolves for the sole purpose of killing human beings, Will Smith and his (real life) son Jaden Smith must survive, despite a special living cargo that wants only to eat them, or tear the apart, or otherwise destroy them...but survival depends on a young man's trek (100Km) to reach one part of the ship that holds their salvation. To do this impossible mission the younger Smith must use all his training as a future space ranger, and all his wits to dodge wild animals, deadly plants, and the creature that was aboard the spaceship before it crashed. His father's legs broken, all Will Smith can do is monitor (live feed from a backpack worn camera array) the journey, dangers, close-calls, and finally the victory of his son's journey both on the planet, in his heart, and of his growth to manhood, winning the respect he longed for as a child at last. This is a feel-good, adventure heavy, survivalist to the max, father-son struggle that wins at every level. Graphics may not win prizes, but the monsters are believable enough to make you sit on the edge of your chair as the young would-be ranger battles for his life and even befriends one enormous threat to his continued living. I felt the landscapes were solid, better than hundreds of other movies I've watched and on par with Jurassic Park - which means the world of the movie is one that tugs at your nerves, making you realize &#34;flight or fight&#34; is not just a great three-word option, it is all that comes between living and dying on the planet the younger Smith dreams of visiting and is destined to conquer.

It begins one thousand years after humans are forced to leave Earth because they destroyed it. They reach a new planet. Humans think their safe until they find an alien species that are putting humans in danger. General Cypher Raige (Will Smith) then finds a way of defeating the aliens. I'm sure you want to know how he did it, so watch the movie to learn the craft of a true ranger. General's son, Kitia Raige, (Jaden Smith) goes on a trip with his father. On the way there though, the ship crash lands on Earth! Cypher's legs are broken and Kitia has to go far away to retrieve an emergency beacon! Can he do it? Would they be able to survive in this dangerous environment?I loved ""After Earth""! This film was a mixture of everything that someone would want! It shows what can possibly happen to humans. I personally adore Will and Jaden Smith. Any movie where they are together makes it a fantastic and funny movie. What makes the movie better is that they play father and son, when in real life they are just that! Father and Son.What else was interesting is how many birds, animals and wales were in the movie clearly showing what our planet would be like without human interference.There are also a few scenes with Cypher and his wife, Faia (Sophie Okoneda) where they have a very cute and adorable conversation and shows General's soft side. My favorite character would be Kitia. He is scared and frightened a lot in this film. He is alone at a young age, on unfamiliar Earth, one thousand years after humans left. It must have been scary! Kitia grows quickly and learns things on this hunt for the beacon.My favorite scene is when Kitia does not listen when his father orders him to comeback knowing that something bad happens, and instead jumps off a very tall cliff and tries to make it to the beacon without proper gear. He gets chased and caught by a giant eagle that decided to ""adopt"" Kitia and even helps him along the way. Kitia's camera, that Cypher is using to see what's going on, gets destroyed and he must continue his journey without his father's guidance.I recommend ""After Earth"" to ages twelve and up.

I had no idea what it was about and was nervous because it was an M Night Shyamalan movie. What&#8217;s that got to do with anything? Well, Shyamalan is best known for The Sixth Sense (1999) which gave us a bend on the surprise ending no one saw coming. It&#8217;s a formula he repeated in movies like Signs (2002) and Lady in the Water (2006). Movies, where everything fits together, at the end, and you get to see all the little points along the way add up to a big finish. In my opinion Unbreakable (2000) is a classic and gives us the realest depiction of a super-hero without using a comic-based format, but includes every motif and clich&eacute;. See, movies like The Village (2004) and The Happening (2008) left many with questions about his continued ability to deliver at his highest potential. After all, Devil (2010) was another won&#8217;t-tell-you-the-plot-until-you-see-it and the curious pay off wasn&#8217;t as revealing as it could have been. Let&#8217;s just say we didn&#8217;t see the Saw [a reference to the 2004 horror flick] in this movie.Will Smith presents another problem for potential movie-goers as his star power and box-office draw was super-high then. And so you expect another blockbuster- another big movie and wow, his son Jaden Smith co-stars, well, really stars. (The Karate Kid 2010 wasn&#8217;t as good as the original, but was way better than any of its sequels so&#8230;.) I&#8217;m saying expectations may have been too high and perhaps another mysterious movie with a surprise ending may not be the best formula to run with.Proper PlotsLet&#8217;s cover what the movie is really about and get down for the set up. It&#8217;s far into the future and Earth has been lost to the self-inflicted wounds of environmental pollution. We flee to the stars and find ourselves in a war with aliens. Will Smith plays General Kitai Raige and during a space voyage, their transport is crippled and it&#8217;s up to not-yet-a-space-ranger Jaden (as Cypher Raige) to cross the dangerous landscape to reach help. Is Will Smith in the movie? Yes, and it&#8217;s not a goofy hologram or ghost, but the movie is the debut of a young action hero in the making. I can dig it. And I also see what the second problem is. You wanted Will Smith to be bounding over those rocks, facing peril and outlined against wondrous vistas. And maybe you wanted some kind of big message at the end or some sort of moral statement with all kinds of pretentious and righteous writer wit. No, you get the story of a father standing by and letting his son brave a new and hostile world. That&#8217;s true- for both the Raige and Smith families, for After Earth and Hollywood.After the&#8230; Earth summaryCertainly it&#8217;s no spoiler to tell you -there is no big-surprise ending or twist and the movie flows and unfolds as expected. Yes, you can relax without worrying if M Night is going to ruin it in the last five minutes. If you have a family that might enjoy and sci-fi tale, this is a solid movie. If you expect&#8230;the expected movie from Will Smith + Shyamalan you will be, like many = disappointed.

Kravitz as Senshi Raige.This is quite a decent Sci-Fi tale,that I didn't think was going to do it for me,with the pairing of Will and his son.But lo and behold Will's son Jaden comes through and actually turns in a respectable performance.The story finds father Will as a General in the army of the future,Rangers to be exact.The Earth is unlivable for humans and they have vacated it for other environs 1,000 years before.To top this their new home Nova Prime has been invaded by alien creatures who use their &#34;dogs&#34;,called Ursas,to hunt humans and kill them.An Ursa is blind and hunts by smell.To stop over producing pheromones which the Ursas can detect,the Rangers try to learn a technique to suppress all emotion called &#34;ghosting&#34;.Jaden is haunted by the memories of his sister being killed by an Ursa.She died as he watched.Now his father is returning home on his birthday and he has failed to become a Ranger.It is a tense reunion and Will decides(with a bug in his ear from his wife)to take his son with him on a simple mission to take a captured Ursa to another planet for training purposes.Will tells his wife that this is his last mission and he wants to retire and work with her when he returns.Along the way their ship gets caught in a meteorite storm and they are forced down on a restricted planet.The planet is old Earth.Their scanners and warning systems tell them that everything there is deadly.Will is hurt in the crash and his son must travel in a heavier gravity and with a limited air supply to the tail section located about 60 miles away.The reason is that the distress beacon on board has been damaged and the only other one is there.Jaden travels through dense forests,over hills and through rivers.His first problem comes when a pack of baboons try to corral him,then chase him.Then a leech attaches itself to his hand,whose poison almost costs him his life.In his struggles his vital air supply is damaged and he has little if any chance of reaching his goal.Countermanding his fathers orders to turn back,he continues and starts by jumping off a tall cliff.The environmental suit he wears is equipped with limited flying capabilities,similar to a flying squirrel.In his descent his is followed and eventually captured by a huge condor like creature,which takes him to its nest.When he awakens the nest is attacked by large cat like creatures.He manages to fend them off and he descends by rope to the forest floor to resume his travels.However the condor continues to follow him,presumably to recapture him and kill him.Jaden decides to build a raft and take the river downstream.He falls asleep and dreams his dead sister is there talking with him.She tells him to wake up which he eventually does,but everything has turned cold.On his journey he has had to reach geo-thermal spots which don't freeze in order to stay alive at night.Now the cold has started to envelop the area and he is caught short.he continues,desperately looking for shelter by cannot find any.He collapses and lays on the ground ready to die.However some unseen hand drags his body to a depression in the ground and covers himup.The next morning he awakes and extricates himself.It turns out it was the giant condor that saved him,and who died in the cold.It never meant Jaden harm,but probably thought he was one its young.Jaden,just by the skin of his teeth,finally makes the tail section and resupplies himself.However the Ursa the ship was carrying has escaped.The beacon he finds doesn't work,but he soon realizes he must climb up a volcanic mountain nearby in order to reach higher ground.Along the way the Ursa picks his scent up and dogs him all the way.When Jaden finally reaches  summit,the beacon comes on and works.At that moment the Ursa arrives also and throws Jaden down,injuring him badly.At that moment he has an epiphany and he realizes he must suppress all emotions if he is ever going to live.This he does and he defeats the Ursa.The beacon activates and both he and his ailing father get saved and they receive the medical attention they need.In an emotional ending,Will orders his attendants to stand him up.He salutes his son,who can only react by running to him and hugging him.He tells his father he wants to work with his mother too.The movie doesn't have alot of superfluous scenes and Jaden is pretty much on his own throughout most of the film.Once they crash land and Jaden is on his way,Will has to sit things out at the main section and guide his son along,as he is severally injured.The camera cuts from father to son get less and less the longer Jaden is into his destination,eEspecially when the communication between the two is severed.As I mentioned earlier Jaden acquits himself nicely.Though he has alot to learn of the biz yet,he is certainly off to a good start.The S/Fx are very good here and we get a nice slant of what Earth would look like 1000 years+ from now,as nature has taken back what was hers to begin with.The very last shot is the ship flying out over Earth's ocean,which is teaming with whales on or near the surface.And while that environmental element/moral is there,as befits the times we live in,it is not smacking us over the head as some films have done,thank goodness.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include four featurettes.All in all a better film than I thought it would be.This is an M. Night Shyamalan film and is a step up from the past few duds he has helmed.Jaden Smith &#34;brings it&#34; on screen,as Will steps into the background to let the spotlight shine on him.It works for

1561006,A1LIUMB0N0XHLG,B008JFUP8A,ROGER WARD,"[7, 30]","Whenever Shyamalan has a new film playing in the theaters the critics and the majority of their followers get ready to hammer the film-maker and his work. And what's even more repulsive is that they focus on the film-maker and intentionally they pay less attention on the film itself.  It's been an interesting year in films so far. - On and off, it's been impressive; I have some favorites of my own and few, sadly, that are not falling in the ""favorites"" category. - Shyamalan's After Earth, despite some of its weaknesses, falls in a charming manner in the `favorites' category. It's a surprise and can also be called a beautiful work in its own right. In other words, After Earth has managed to stay in my list and I can proudly say that it's a good film with an interesting plot. There are few reasons I believe After Earth is a good film; actually a better picture than some of the blockbusters of this year. I would like to put the spotlight on the originality and also on Shyamalan's method a little bit. Shyamalan still, audaciously, steps forward as an artist with a sense of originality, whereas some film-makers don't. I consider his methods smart as much as daring. And it boggles the mind as some don't see it. Shyamalan's work in Hollywood is against the current paradigm. - Some of the contemporary film-makers, yes, they're talented, but what they seek is to jump right on the opportunity to take on reboots and sequels so they can get their names labeled forever on a famous franchise. And when it comes to Shyamalan, he likes to stay in the corner, and from time to time, he throws a new spear right at a system that many are so used to. After Earth, interestingly puts its spiritual journey within the science fiction genre. Shyamalan still, as an old-fashioned auteur, manages to create a sense of tension. The atmosphere that we find Kitai (Jaden Smith) and his father Cypher Raige (Will Smith) turns the skin cold. Shyamalan injects that one famous sense, which is known as fear, through his eerie long shots. Often, in silence, we see the character on the screen introducing through their expression, of course, wordlessly, paranoia. And we, as audience, sense the impact of being hopeless. But, Kitai as a newbie manages to beat the odds. On screen and off screen, we hear Cypher guiding his son through a world that is no longer accepting mankind. It takes faith to make a Shyamalan type of film. To see and feel the senses of his characters; Cypher as a protective father understands the reality of the situation that he is in. He has no choice, but to guide his son through a world that is full of danger, where possibility of death is certain. After Earth manages to pull itself out with the help of its characters, dialogues, and Shyamalan's techniques and most importantly with the help of its unique atmosphere. The film, like I said, comes with some obvious weaknesses as well. And one of them is its opening shot, which I think has been executed in a rush manner. It gives audiences no choice to feel captivated with the world that Gary White has written. Though, the film emotionally grabs you once both Cypher and Kitai's ship crash lands on Earth. - One of the other weaknesses of the film is its 100 minute duration on the screen. I think what's necessary is that all film-makers before filming should find a pace. This brings to mind again that Shyamalan as a director does pretty well when he works on his own product. When it comes to pacing, and looking back at Shyamalan's previous films, I don't find any issues with the pacing of any of his films or with the opening shots. They are always engaging: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water and The Happening.  He understands his own methods; he is the mechanic of his own workshop. Like many other fans, I'm looking forward to his next film; a screenplay that he's currently working on, which I think is going to be a low budget film. That sounds interesting to me. Even with some of its weaknesses and not so impressive CGI, After Earth still, in my book, manages to pull itself up in the list. After Earth can be pronounced as a good film and what saves it is Shyamalan himself. It's always interesting to view his work and in After Earth, we do see his methods of film-making. The techniques that he's so much in love with are all quite visible and understandable if seen a little more closely. .For those who like a simple story done with style, then check this out. I could watch this movie just with music, it is breathtaking to watch.  This movie had humor,suspense,action, a great father and son dynamic. The hate this movie is getting is ubsurd.

1561015,A3D28SE0H060MU,B008JFUP8A,Ryan,"[1, 4]","I sincerely feel bad for M. Night Shyamalan, though the consistency with which he continues to release films, despite his numerous critical and box-office failures of recent past proves that he doesn't necessarily need my pity. Still, it must be difficult to go from being called the next Steven Spielberg to becoming the next Uwe Boll. Even when his films are not terrible, they are light-years away from the quality of his first few features.With all that being said, After Earth is not as terrible as you might imagine. It also isn't exactly great, but I would place far more blame on the Pinkett/Smith family for the biggest issues the film has. This became a family project, and I think that paired with Shyamalan's overly imaginative science fiction narrative led to a sillier film than necessary. Tamed down a small amount, this may have been a wonderfully adequate family film. Kids are less inclined to notice awkward acting or absurd plot twists.The glaring issues with After Earth have nothing to do with the polished visuals of seamless computer graphics. The story is even decent in its basic structure, though there are certain developments within the screenplay that take on a kind of logic which seems to come from the mind of a child. Animals suddenly act selflessly to protect a human for no apparent reason and a suit gives the ability to fly when the screenplay is suddenly backed into a corner: these are apparently normal occurrences in a Gary Whitta/Shyamalan feature.These are all forgivable and campy errors in filmmaking judgment, but the choice to cast Jaden Smith in the leading role was a mistake that can't be as easily ignored or dismissed. The film is produced by many people, but the majority has a blood relation to Jaden, including Caleeb Pinkett, Jada Pinkett Smith his father Will Smith, who has far too little screen time to save this movie. Jaden may be a good actor. To be honest, I would need to see more of him in order to determine what kind of talent he has, but his performance in After Earth leaves a great deal to be desired. It is underwhelming to say the least.

I waited to get this movie on redbox due to all the bad reviews. But I have to say I enjoyed the film. It keeps your attention. Not a holy cow great film but worth watching. Now I do have to agree with the reviews on Will Smith's son's acting. I was very surprised especially after seeing him in Karate Kid that his acting was this poor. Everytime time he spoke his dialogue it seemed like he was reading it off a script. Very unnatural and awkward. His english pronunication was also bad. What happened to this kids acting. If he wasn't Will smith's son I doubt he would have ever been cast in this role. Whenever I see that Will Smith is in a movie I always expect a great film.

1561026,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B008JFUP8A,S. Der,"[48, 67]","I watched the movie first and did not read any reviews for it. I did hear this movie wasn't that good, but I gave it a shot anyways. Not surprised that there are mostly negative reviews than positive reviews on here. Anyways, let's get on with my review.I thought this movie does have the story going for it, but you really have to ""pay attention"" to what is being said in the beginning of the movie. If you miss anything from what they told you at the start, then most likely, you're going to get a little lost into it. The story is very interesting. Earth is slowly becoming an inhabitable planet, and so, the military made a department division called, ""The Rangers core"". The Rangers go out and try to locate a new planet for Earth's people to live on. Eventually, they did find a new planet, Nova Prime, and the people of Earth move relocate there. They do find out that they were not alone on the planet. The Aliens of that world try to kill the humans by creating these new huge monsters that can locate humans and kill them off. The monsters cannot see and are blind, but they can smell fear and that's the only way they can locate the humans.I'm thinking that it's strange that the humans don't use guns on the monsters as they don't even try to shoot it. I can only assume that guns have no affect on the monsters...right? Then, again, humans at that point should have powerful laser power guns, but they don't even try that. They don't try bombs or anything. Instead, what they have is Will Smith with a two-sided blade weapon going in and hack and stash his way to victory for the humans. Will Smith has an ability to have no fear against these monsters. The ability is called ""Ghosting"". If you can forget that they don't have guns or any advance weaponry in this movie and just use their concept of ghosting than maybe you're like this movie. I can't really - it's just too dumb.Jadan Smith character is very strong physically, but mentally he's unstable and falls apart in front of danger. This is because the alien's monster killed his big sister when he was only a child. He wants to be like his father, a General in the military and original ranger that invented ghosting. Jadan often doesn't see his father, and so, he doesn't really know him well. Jadan does still looks up to him a lot though. In the movies, I like Jadan playing his funny side with for his characters. I don't think he plays scared acting or fierce/strong acting well. He just doesn't seem to pull it off well.Now basically, the story of this movie is very simple and easy to make.  There are no characters besides Will and Jadan after the beginning of the movie. Every character would be a flash back after that, so pretty much 90% of the whole movie is just those two guys on the screen. I don't really like that and wanted to see more than just these two guys.The rest of the story is Will taking to Jadan on his last mission as General before retirement. They need to take a ship and just go to a planet and Will trains the new rangers about ghosting there. Simple, right.  Well it's not. A twist is when we see that they bring the human killing monster with them on the ship. That's because they want to use it for training there. Somehow the ship gets damage and they need to make emergency landing before it's too late. The closes planet is Earth, which we now know that it is inhabitable planet, but there is no other choice. The ship blows up just before the landing and it crashes onto Earth. Jadan is unhurt in the crash, but Will can't move. Will's legs are broken and everyone else is dead. Now, Jadan has to go get help by traveling to retrieve a bacon at the tail end of the ship, and that's 100 kilometers away from them. The bacon will send out a search and recuse signal to the Rangers for help.Jadan journey is a simple task, but NOT supposed to be easy. Jadan isn't use to Earth's gravity, there are dangers animals and insects everywhere, the air isn't breathable, and finally, the alien's human killing monster is lose and ready and waiting to kill! Jadan. Jadan has help from his father, and gives him a backpack. The backpack has cameras that lets Will sees and hears what Jadan may or may not see or hear. Also, he has breathing devices that let's him breath the toxic air for a short period of time, but he needs to keep on using them throughout the movie. Finally, he has Will's two-sided blade weapon that can change to multiple different styles.Now, some people may think this is an action movie, but there isn't that much action in this one. This movie shouldn't be in that action category at all, and it should only put in the Sci-Fi section. The action is down to the bare minimum. It is mostly about Jadan talking about himself to his father, and how scared he is doing this task. But through this, they also learn much about each other and how they both react in the same situation different. Remember, the father has NO FEAR, but his son is totally afraid of everything. In a way, it's like a father trying to teach his son how to do his job. Of course, the son doesn't get it at first and takes time for him to learn the job. I see what they try to do in the movie and that's great writing.Everything is done in CGI. All the monsters and locations are supposed to be sci-fi, so it's understandable that it would be like that. It's not the best CGI I seen, but it would do for this movie.After watching this movie, I thought it's not that good. I wouldn't even say it's average. It started out great with the story they built up (forgetting about advance weaponry they should have), but they couldn't keep on delivering with the rest of the movie. It needed to be longer. They needed more background story. The plot needed to be bigger and better. They needed more characters!!! This movie could had been 4 or 5 stars, but it was the bare minimum to a even better movie that could had been.I do NOT recommend this movie.",2,I expected more!!!,1373155200,"07 7,

1561045,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B008JFUP8A,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[0, 0]","After Earth doesn't deserve all the hate that has been thrown at it. On that same note the movie does a lot to make it unlikeable. The movie underutilized its star power, fails to provide proper exposition and follows a rather generic plot pattern that makes the movie very predictable. If you can get past all that what you will find is unique angle on an age old theme of a child's rite to manhood set in a fascinating universe.The movie is about General Cypher Raige (Will Smith) and his son Kitai (Jaden Smith) surviving on a newly primal Earth after crash landing their spaceship. After Earth is set at first in a world colonized by the last of Earth's inhabitants a thousand years ago. Then on Earth after the crash. There is just a tiny bit of background data that talks about what happened to Earth and what's up with the new planet Nova Prime. This includes an invasion by a vicious alien race called the Ursa (which they happen to have a captured specimen on their ship). All of this little bit of details about what happened before are important because they set the important plot points for the survival story. Unfortunately the background information is too little and feels like an afterthought. This is a shame too, because in related merchandise to After Earth there seems to be a very full and rich background to explore. Yet... they didn't.This is the start of the movie's woes. You can get around this limitation if you read up on the movie's setting online or in one of the books published, but if you don't like doing homework before a film I can see why you wouldn't be happy. Still lets move on. The story is actually pretty good if you know the background. Kitai (Jaden) wants to be a Ranger like dear old dad, but lacks the emotional maturity. Dad is too busy distancing himself with his work to help his son. All this changes with the crash, and Cypher is now seriously wounded and has to rely on his son to rescue the both of them.From here the story hits some basic plot points of putting out obstacles to impede Kitai's progress, and all the while Cypher can only just sit on the sidelines. So the story details are standard, but I like the approach of making this movie a coming of age story for Kitai. He has to dig deep and learn what it takes to become a Ranger while surviving the wild. While I like this many Will Smith fans won't. Why? Because Will Smith is sitting on his butt the entire movie. On top of that Will's character is about as charismatic as a paper towel. Will is an action hero with a palpable level of charisma, and none of that was utilized. While he wasn't meant to be any of this on After Earth Will's fame precedes him, and his fans are rather single minded in what they want from him.So hardly any back story and no Will Smith hogging the limelight. What's left? Like I said before the story is interesting in spite of being predictable. There is very little dialog in the film with lots of scenes based just on visceral experience. M. Night Shayamalan knows how to set a scene and this movie is no different. Whatever you have to say about what the movie lacks it sure looks and sounds beautiful. There are little experiences in the film that help flesh it out like Cypher's injuries and how he copes, Kitai's run in with various animals like baboons and giant birds. The interplay with flashbacks between the two characters and a traumatic experience that stunted both of them. It's all an intermingled web of details that bring life to an otherwise generic film.Like many other sci-fi movies a lot can be taken from well though out technology, and this is where After Earth excels. All sorts of designs on this movie are really interesting and show an evolutionary side step in where technology branches off. You have ships with a more organic look to them. Weapons that perform in a way that harkens to magical. Survival gear that is both fascinating and carries the plot. From this standpoint the movie is very cool.Acting is actually much better than many want to give credit for the film. I think the problem here is there isn't as much drama to draw from. Will Smith's character comes out as unemotional because that's the nature of his character, and it's seeing those telltale signs of his feelings coming through the exterior that make the emotional payoff. I think Jaden Smith does a very good job with his evolution from a flawed kid to one who pushes beyond his boundaries. It's all in the subtleties with this film.After Earth was filmed and mastered in 4K and transferred to full 1080P on this Blu-Ray. To me it's a hard sell with these 4K masters for two reasons. One the master matters less than the bitrate of the transfer. I think After Earth doesn't hit the 30+ mbps of other films, so while the picture does look fantastic it's not going to be pixel perfect (especially in 50&#34; and larger tv screens). Second reason I hesitate on 4K movies is the fact 4K televisions are starting to come out, and I am guessing 4K disks will not be far behind as opposed to 1080p. Audio is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Lossless and you get it in both English and French (Spanish is in 5.1 Dolby Digital). It sure does hit the marks for a great sound experience. I personally found the dialog a tad bit on the light side, but aside from that it's a really good audio mix. This release also includes a DVD of the movie and a code to download a digital copy. The extras are a bit on the standard fare and are a bit disappointing considering how cool Shyamalan's previous extras have been. There isn't even a director's commentary. Here's the breakdown:A Father's Legacy (HD, 8:51) - Will and Jaden Smith on set showing the family bonds between them. Some training shots as well. Kinda cute for those of us with kids and like to see other families get along.Alternate Opening (HD, 2:19) - It's a short animated introduction to the film. I don't know if this is still a rough cut or what as the animation doesn't feel like it belongs. All in all it's better they went with the opening scene they did.Building a World (HD, 12:00) - This is what I consider the proper making of featurette. Interviews with director, cast and crew as well as footage of practical and digital effects. It's short and not up to par with other Shyamalan &#34;making of&#34; features. But it's also better than a fluff piece by a small margin.Pre-Visualization the Future (HD, 5:50) - A primer on pre-visualization animation and how it helps put a movie together. You get to see some scenes pre and post visualization.The Animatics of After Earth (HD, 8:39) - Same as the pre-visualization, but this time with animatics (semi-animation).1000 Years in 300 Seconds (HD, 5:25) - A ton of behind the scenes footage shot quick and to music. Kind of a quick fire documentary without explaining what you are seeing.The Nature of the Future (HD, 5:22) - Documentary on the various natural on-location shots like Costa Rica, Utah and California. This featurette is set to act as a TV screensaver if you want it to. You just have to keep the disc running.XPrize After Earth Challenge (HD, 3:35) - There was a competition for kids where they build a probe using LEGO Mindstorm to explore Nova Prime before the Earth Exodus. This tiny blurb only touches on this contest a tiny bit with just a short amount of footage from the winners. Disappointed as this was a pretty neat thing for the kids to attempt. It would have been nice to see a full blown documentary on it.Previews - Other movies from Sony. Commercials essentially.After Earth is flawed, but I can't help see some really good potential in this film. Enough potential for me to end up enjoying it. Will I buy this release? No. The extras are weak and the potential for a 4K release to come up in the future is too tempting. However I do heartily recommend a rental. Best results are if you read After Earth: United Ranger Corps Survival Manual first and then see the movie. Sorry about the prerequisite.",3,"A flawed film, but still worthwhile.

1561047,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B008JFUP8A,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","I read the reviews when film first came out and now that I've finally seen it (checked it out from the library), I found it wasn't that bad, I'd describe it as average. The biggest weakness is the story is too thin. The director has been knocked for the movie but I thought the directing (except for one shot which I'll mention later) was fine. It was a professionally made movie, scenes were in focus, the CGI adequate, not the best I've seen but okay. I liked Will Smith's character, he played what reminded me of an african amercian military Mr. Spock, a stereotypical unemotional officer with a tiny hint of humor (more underplayed humor would've been nice). His acting, as usual, was good. The son character, Katai, played by Jaden Smith, is a very nice young man and I thought Jaden did very well, except for one scene at the end of the movie where he sees that his father, surrounded by medical staff, has survived; at that point, where the director shot the General's hand in closeup, and shot that sequence in such a way as to tantalize the audience about whether the Will Smith character survived or not, Jaden should have done something, bowed his head, a small smile, something to indicate his relief and happiness that his father survived, but Jaden didn't react. The director should've gotten that shot, when the final movie was put together and reviewed, someone should've pointed out that very important missing reaction, especially considering that theirs was the main relationship on display in the movie, and that saving his father was Katai's primary job.  Other than that missing shot, Jaden's acting was okay - pretty solid for a 14 or 15 year old. Jaden is relatively inexperienced and needed a very knowledgeable director; the director hasn't had a major success in a while, so he was too tentative, not confident enough to tell Jaden what he needed. Their collaboration wasn't awful, and was mostly good, but had Jaden been more experienced and the director been more confident, the audience would've gotten a much better story. I disagree with the poor reviews Jaden got. I think he just needs to act in alot more projects and watch alot of films with a wide range of actors. He's got the chops, just needs more experience.The major problems in my opinion were the writing of the Katai character, and how late in the story the monster appeared. Katai needed more to do, he was not proactive enough when he was first introduced into the story. Yes in the end he saved his father, yes he survived and activated the beacon, but the audience needed him to do more, so I think the problem was with the story and it's structure. A teenager and his father take a trip, there's an accident leaving the father seriously injured and the teenager has to traverse dangerous terrain to get help. The story is too thin, there needed to be at least one other element to give Katai something more to do, someone else to help, perhaps even another person to help him.  Katai needed someone else to care for, in addition to saving his father. The other problem was the Ursa monster. Monster in this story didn't make an appearance until the final act, not enough time for the audience to perceive it as a threat. A comparison would be in Jaws if the shark hadn't appeared until the final act when it destroyed the boat. What if the shark hadn't taken out the lady swimmer, or the kid, or attacked the other characters. Well it would've been jaws-lite, a movie without the shark until the third act. Such a movie would not have kept people out of the water and scared the be-jesus out of them for years after.Another thing, why would a giant eagle-like creature attack Katai presumably to feed it's hatching young, only later to save and sacrifice itself to keep him warm? Not believable that a wild animal would do such a thing. So really, overall, I'd say the script was the problem. Had Katai been given enough to do and had the audience been given more information about him when he was first introduced into the story, it would've helped the audience attach to him. As presented, Katai proved himself to be courageous and ultimately successful, and it was fine to show he possessed those characteristics, but the audience needed more to help them attach to him. Would've been great if the writer had created situations to highlight that he was resourceful. Running for your life doesn't make you resourceful in a film, all characters run for their lives when physically threatened if they're able to. Resourcefulness is something a hero/heroine in an action adventure needs to demonstrate to get the audience's attention.  When a writer makes their lead character resourceful, that means the character will be proactive, do something, be unpredictable and by extension, interesting. Katai was too passively written and by that I mean the writer didn't create enough opportunities to display his strengths.  Saving his father occurred in the 3rd act, he needed mini successes, mini jobs, along the way that occurred in the 1st and 2nd acts as well. He needed other characters, his interaction with them would've given the audience more chances to see and subconsciously judge his heroic nature, helping us to respect and admire him. The writer did not provide those characters or those needed situations. And whoever approved the final script did not know enough about story to understand that crucial elements were missing.A comparison, Luke in Star Wars: A New Hope. By the time Luke was working to rescue the Princess while he was trying to escape from the Death Star, the audience already loved him. Why? Well Luke was a good kid, he stayed and worked on the farm helping his aging and not altogether healthy relatives (his uncle was limping in that movie if you recall) though he wanted passionately to leave for school. And speaking of that, he wanted schooling, something most citizens agree should be a child's birthright. Also a birthright, knowledge about your parentage, which his uncle was clearly withholding. So Luke was being denied his birthright. And though he was frustrated by his uncle, he still obeyed him, taking care of the robots, who, by the way, he treated courteously though they were slaves. Luke was liked and was being rooted for well before he engaged the Empire. And the villain, the Empire, was one of the first elements on screen, and the audience saw what they were capable of and it was obvious they were the bad guys. And as to resourcefulness, Luke was able to talk a resistant Han Solo into helping rescue the Princess, and he also got Leia across a bridge using only abit of thin rope. Katai needed other characters, other situations, to demonstrate his resourcefulness, to help us see him as a young man of value, and help us attach to him, and that attaching needed to be done before he began his quest. For the audience, Katai's successful journey on the hostile earth should have just validated audience emotionally backing him, but the backing (attaching) should've been done by the time he regained consciousness post-crash. The writer emphasized the father/son dynamic, and there was nothing wrong with that, but we needed more than that, we needed more from Katai's point of view, as he is the story hero.So that's why I think the film wasn't as successful in America as it might have been, but I think it did well enough worldwide. Grade: 2 and 3/4 stars, rounded up to 3.P.S. Considering Jaden Smith has only been in what maybe 5 major films or so, I think he's got the makings of a good actor. And it doesn't hurt that he's handsome.  I hope the Smiths keep trying and develop more features for their children. I'm African American and I definitely enjoyed seeing a family of African American descent in a futuristic film. Well done Smiths. Not too bad Mr. Director.P.S.S. Just remembered that I also liked that the music didn't hit me over the head being overly dramatic. I prefer a light touch in big movie music cues, and got that here. Also liked the ladies acting who played the mom and the daughter.",3,didn't suck...(SPOILERS),1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,8067,"['read', 'reviews', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'now',

Of course Will is hurt during the crash so young Jaden must go on the  journey. What Journey? Well the journey to find the tailend of the ship of course where the homing beacon is.

Not a first choice movie, but most radical sci-fi fans like me will still want to see it.Here are the pros and cons:Pros:- The story held our interest throughout, though it never got really got intense.- Will Smith has that quality that makes him a star.- It was an interesting premise, though I think it could have been carried out much better than it was.Cons:- The story lacked depth. They showed backstories for the characters, but they were just not written and performed in a way that gets you really invested. It just didn't have that great writing and acting that makes a movie compelling and great.- There were just so many, many plot holes in the story, that it kind of takes you into a state of continual skepticism. I found myself often questioning the realism of it. It's kind of what you'd expect from a B-Movie and not a headliner like this.I don't want to give any major spoilers, so here's a minor example (spoiler alert): The earth freezes over every single night with such a deep freeze that it will kill a person if exposed, so how do all the trees, plants and animals on this lush, green surface live? There's never any explanation. It's just not believable. As I said, this is a minor example - but there are many big plot holes, conflicts and things that make no sense whatsoever.- Will Smith played his character almost completely flat with almost little to no sign of emotion... While I understand why he may have chosen to do something like this based on the story, it was just too over the top flat. Will's a great actor and we're big fans, but it made it hard to get really connected to his character.- The story really revolved around the young boy's character played by Jaden Smith. He was just okay, but honestly he wasn't strong enough to carry it off in a compelling way.- CGI was not as convincing as it could have been. You're always aware that you're looking at computer generated images. That pulls you out of the fantasy.So I was mildly entertained throughout, but the quality could have been much better. I can't say that this is a must see, but an okay choice if you've run out of better things to see.",3,It was okay - Not great - Not Bad,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,2243,"['wife', 'Sarah', 'were', 'never', 'bored', 'never', 'got', 'great', ""'d"", 'still', 'say', 'was', 'okay', 'movie', 'Not', 'first', 'choice', 'movie', 'most', 'radical', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'will', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'it.Here', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'Pros', 'story', 'held', 'interest', 'never', 'got', 'really', 'got', 'intense.-', 'Will', 'Smith', 'quality', 'star.-', 'was', 'interesting', 'premise', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'carried', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'lacked', 'depth', 'showed', 'backstories', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'written', 'performed', 'way', 'really', 'invested', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'movie', 'compelling', 'great.-', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'story', 'kind', 'state', 'continual', 'skepticism', 'found', 'often', 'questioning', 'realism', 'kind', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'B-Movie', 'not', 'headliner', 'this.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'major', 'spoilers', 'here', 'minor', 'example', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'earth', 'single', 'night', 'deep', 'freeze', 'will', 'kill', 'person', 'exposed', 'how', 'do', 'trees', 'plants', 'animals', 'lush', 'green', 'surface', 'live', 'never', 'explanation', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'said', 'minor', 'example', 'are', 'many', 'big', 'plot', 'holes', 'conflicts', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever.-', 'Will', 'Smith', 'played', 'character', 'almost', 'completely', 'flat', 'almost', 'little', 'sign', 'emotion', 'understand', 'why', 'may', 'have', 'chosen', 'do', 'something', 'based', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'top', 'flat', 'Will', 'great', 'actor', ""'re"", 'big', 'fans', 'made', 'hard', 'get', 'really', 'connected', 'character.-', 'story', 'really', 'revolved', 'young', 'boy', 'character', 'played', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'carry', 'off', 'compelling', 'way.-', 'CGI', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'convincing', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""'re"", 'always', 'aware', ""'re"", 'looking', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'fantasy.So', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'must', 'see', 'okay', 'choice', ""'ve"", 'run', 'better', 'things', 'see']",N/A

1561057,A26MJME9IBNETY,B008JFUP8A,StrangePegs,"[4, 7]","So, yeah, I know. After Oblivion, why would I want to and watch After Earth?Either it was some weird form of masochism or it was Will Smith.Actually, it was Will Smith and all the bad stuff said about his son because of the movie. I needed to see, okay! Sometimes, you just have to know, like when someone says, &#34;This tastes awful! You try it,&#34; and you do. You're thinking, &#34;Surely, it can't be that bad,&#34; but, then, it is, and you get mad at the person offering you the taste even though he told you it was going to be bad.And, wow, After Earth was bad. So bad.And, you know what, I'm not even going to talk about the stupid science in this movie.I lied.In one of the most ridiculous scenes I've ever witnessed in a movie, Cypher (Will Smith) gets up from his seat and places his hand against the interior hull of the spaceship he's in. He goes to the cockpit and tells the pilots that he feels gravitons and wants to know what's going on. This is like saying, &#34;Hey, I feel some neutrinos; what's up with that?&#34; Anyway, there's a field of asteroids nearby, and, sure enough, when they check, they find there's a sudden buildup of gravitons happening, and Cypher tells them to be careful because the asteroids might suddenly explode. Predictably, the graviton levels start to drop... just before the asteroid field spontaneously explodes. Because that's what asteroids do when they're sitting around in space; they spontaneously explode. The ship is forced to crash land on Earth, abandoned by mankind 1000 years prior.Cypher and his son, Kitai, are, again predictably, the only survivors of the crash, but Cypher is badly wounded, which sets up the contrived scenario where Kitai has to go trekking across the planet to get to the other part of the ship to fetch a homing beacon. He has to trek across the planet on which &#34;every living thing has evolved to kill humans.&#34; Oh, and climb an active volcano. No, wait, I don't just mean active; I mean actively active. As in, it's in the process of erupting. Because that's such a great idea. And I won't even go into the part where he has to fight the alien that they brought along with them, another thing that has evolved or been engineered &#34;just to kill humans.&#34;The very first thing that happens to Kitai when he leaves the one end of the ship is that a spider crawls on him. But this spider that has evolved &#34;just to kill humans&#34; doesn't hurt him. And, of course, none of the plants hurt him. But here's the thing: 1000 years ago all of the animals on Earth were basically the same as they are now. 2000 years ago, they were basically the same. 5000 years ago, they were basically the same. 10,000 years ago, they were basically the same. Yet, 1000 years in the future, all of the animals have evolved &#34;just to kill humans.&#34; And we see some significantly different animals, like some kind of saber-toothed tiger, on this future Earth. And, I'm sorry, I have to call &#34;Bull****!&#34; How about adding some science to your science there.And I'm not even going to go into the physics involved in a bird no bigger than Kitai flying off with him. I'm just gonna say &#34;bull****!&#34; again. I'm also not going to go into how the entire planet freezes over every night and, yet, remains lush and green. I don't even have a word for that, because bull**** doesn't cover it.Now, I haven't seen The Happening, but I do know what it's about, and After Earth struck me as nothing more than a bad sequel to a bad movie. Another low for M. Night. The bad thing here is that Will Smith brought Shyamalan into the project, not the other way around.So, yeah, the original story idea was Smith's, but it involved a car crash in the woods in which the father is injured and the son has to go for help, and he should have just stuck with that story. But he decided he wanted to go sci-fi with it, so he hired a guy who wrote a script then went to Shyamalan with the script who also worked on the writing of the script and what Smith ended up with was a disaster that should have crashed in the woods and been left there.I mean, not only is there no science in the science in the sci-fi movie, but they stripped out of Cypher Raige (yeah, really? he needs a name like &#34;Raige&#34;?) everything that makes Will Smith an enjoyable actor. Cypher is nothing more than the stereotypical emotionless military character out of touch with his son. Of course, Smith didn't want the movie to be about him; he wanted it to be about his son. This was to be the movie to give Jaden a foothold into his own career of action stardom.And that's the second reason I wanted to see After Earth. I liked Jaden in the remake of Karate Kid, but he got slammed pretty hard for his performance in Earth, and I wanted to know if it was justified. After watching it, I'm not sure. Based on his performance in Karate Kid, I'd like to say his performance in Earth is due to bad directing (because his father certainly delivered one of the worst (possibly the worst) performances of his career), but it's hard to know with only one other movie to compare against. He certainly didn't help the movie any, though, and his scene where he stands on the cliff and yells at his father through his communicator was almost painfully awful. But I really want to give him the benefit of the doubt and blame it on Shyamalan, who hasn't made anything watchable in over a decade. I guess we'll just have to see what happens. Assuming Jaden Smith gets another chance. A movie that crashes and burns as hard as this one did can kill a career.",1,hard crash,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,5593,"['So', 'yeah', 'know', 'Oblivion', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'Earth',

Toss in a director whose films have taken a downturn in recent years and there was a recipe for disaster. This film is far from great, but it's no disaster.The special effects are fine. The music is pretty good. The story...is passable. But you're not watching this movie for any of that stuff. You're watching to see an epic tale of survival with father and son depending on each other.Unfortunately, while this was a project dreamed up and controlled by Smith and a thoroughly Smith family affair, he and his son are in my opinion just all wrong for the roles. In the father role you need someone like Harrison Ford or  Russell Crowe. In the son role you need someone...who doesn't have the last name Smith.Both of them give some decent...if rather wooden acting. But this movie needed more. Despite the creatures and sci-fi trapping this was  movie made for strong father-son acting/chemistry that just isn't' there.

It's basically a Mcguffin flick if flicks could be made by a Vanity Press Director.  And just in case no one got it's a journey movie, this film is so bad that it actually pictured in one scene and mentioned in another the great novel Moby Dick, without any connection to the action, plot or back story at all.  But as a device it was lost on this garbage film.  No one was hunting anything but someone probably thought it deep to have that there.  The freshman film students would get it.  No one else woud.I judge film the same way I do art.  Like the blue slash on the white canvass that adorned the entrance to the Freer in DC 40 years ago on the day I ended a 7 year relationship by disclosing how little I appreciated the artistic musings of the great painter who decided to dip his brush in blue paint and draw a horizontal line.  I apparently couldn't appreciate all kinds of meaning and depth because the painter was important, prominent, historic, etc. but all I saw was a blue slash.  If I can do it it's not art.  This movie is like that.  It has the pedigree of Will Smith but no substance.  In fact I found myself wandering to the sink to finish the dishes hoping for a reveal of a reborn earth or a cataclysmic discovery that earth had been occupied by aliens or something.  Nope.  A handful of poorly designed not scary monsters attempted and failed to capture Jr even though they were clearly supposed to be superb predators.  Then Jr is saved by a giant eagle from freezing.  Did I mention how bad this movie is?  I suppose they're rescued because in the next to last scene he gets the beacon and sets it off then suddenly he's back on wherever and credits roll.Note to crappy set designers.  We will still have beds in 3100 AD like we did in 3000 BC.When Jr starts out in pursuit of the beacon, Daddy/General asks ""What do you feel?""  Jr says ""heavy"" and Daddy/General says ""Good that's gravity.""I wonder if the audience laughed as hard as I did.  So add crappy script to rotten lazy set design queue the CGI swarming stuff and herding animals and the music swells to reveal a planet that freezes over completely at night in spite of the tropical foliage that covers everything.  And don't forget to throw in a few flash backs to the dead sister (who liked to read Moby Dick) just to create what, depth?  At least she had enough lines to qualify for health insurance.  And while I'm still trying to figure out how Judge Dredd wiped his ass with that clam shell 20 years ago nothing so useful as that seems to have been stowed on this spacecraft.  Except a hideous monster who can smell fear that's to be used in training.  Let's call him Spot.  Spot's demise was never explained as far as I could tell.  Meanwhile Jr. has more important things to do like ignore everything his father says so he gets chased by GCI apes.  Oooh scary.  Judge Dredd is suddenly not the worst sci-fi movie ever made.Dialogue like ""If you want to die today that is fine but you're not going to kill me.""  Well Daddy, actually if he wants to die you will die so no it's not fine.  In response to getting scratched poor Jr. suddenly  needs to inject something into his heart because what's a good medical emergency clich&eacute; without that.  Not once but twice.  The $5.99 they can keep but there should be a toll free number where you can call to get your lost time back.",1,I wish I could get the 95 minutes back,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,3886,"['Sci-fi', 'like', 'bacon', 'chocolate', 'really', 'such', 'thing', 'too', 'much', 'none', 'ever', 'bad', 'matter', 'what', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'deep', 'reflections', 'aha', 'moments', 'outstanding', 'effects', 'was', 'least', 'expecting', 'see', 'ruins', 'old', 'earth', 'so', 'easy', 'do', 'CGI', 'story', 'how', 'happened', 'McGuffin', 'device', 'been', 'used', 'very', 'effectively', 'Hitchcock', 'produce', 'fear', 'Melville', 'produce', 'excitement', 'Earth', 'just', 'sucked', 'basically', 'Mcguffin', 'flick', 'flicks', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'Vanity', 'Press', 'Director', 'just', 'case', 'one', 'got', 'journey', 'movie', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'pictured', 'one', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'great', 'novel', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'connection', 'action', 'plot', 'back', 'story', 'device', 'was', 'lost', 'garbage', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'hunting', 'anything', 'someone', 'probably', 'thought', 'deep', 'have', 'there', 'freshman', 'film', 'students', 'would', 'get', 'one', 'else', 'judge', 'film', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'art', 'blue', 'slash', 'white', 'canvass', 'adorned', 'entrance', 'Freer', 'DC', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'day', 'ended', '7', 'year', 'relationship', 'disclosing', 'how', 'little', 'appreciated', 'artistic', 'musings', 'great', 'painter', 'who', 'decided', 'dip', 'brush', 'blue', 'paint', 'draw', 'horizontal', 'line', 'apparently', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'kinds', 'meaning', 'depth', 'painter', 'was', 'important', 'prominent', 'historic', 'etc', 'saw', 'was', 'blue', 'slash', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'art', 'movie', 'pedigree', 'Will', 'Smith', 'substance', 'fact', 'found', 'wandering', 'sink', 'finish', 'dishes', 'hoping', 'reveal', 'reborn', 'earth', 'cataclysmic', 'discovery', 'earth', 'had', 'been', 'occupied', 'aliens', 'something', 'Nope', 'handful', 'poorly', 'designed', 'not', 'scary', 'monsters', 'attempted', 'failed', 'capture', 'Jr', 'even', 'were', 'clearly', 'supposed', 'be', 'superb', 'predators', 'Then', 'Jr', 'saved', 'giant', 'eagle', 'freezing', 'Did', 'mention', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'suppose', ""'re"", 'rescued', 'next', 'last', 'scene', 'beacon', 'sets', 'off', 'then', 'suddenly', 'back', 'wherever', 'credits', 'roll.Note', 'crappy', 'set', 'designers', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'beds', '3100', 'AD', 'did', '3000', 'BC.When', 'Jr', 'out', 'pursuit', 'beacon', 'Daddy/General', 'What', 'do', 'feel', 'Jr', 'heavy', 'Daddy/General', 'Good', 'gravity', 'wonder', 'audience', 'laughed', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'So', 'add', 'crappy', 'script', 'rotten', 'lazy', 'set', 'design', 'CGI', 'swarming', 'stuff', 'herding', 'animals', 'music', 'reveal', 'planet', 'over', 'completely', 'night', 'spite', 'tropical', 'foliage', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'throw', 'few', 'flash', 'backs', 'dead', 'sister', 'who', 'liked', 'read', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'just', 'create', 'what', 'depth', 'least', 'had', 'enough', 'lines', 'qualify', 'health', 'insurance', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'wiped', 'ass', 'clam', 'shell', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'nothing', 'so', 'useful', 'have', 'been', 'stowed', 'spacecraft', 'hideous', 'monster', 'who', 'can', 'smell', 'fear', 'be', 'used', 'training', 'Let', 'call', 'Spot', 'Spot', 'demise', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'Meanwhile', 'Jr.', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'do', 'ignore', 'everything', 'father', 'so', 'chased', 'GCI', 'apes', 'Oooh', 'scary', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'suddenly', 'not', 'worst', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'ever', 'want', 'die', 'today', 'fine', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'kill', 'Well', 'Daddy', 'actually', 'die', 'will', 'die', 'so', 'not', 'fine', 'response', 'getting', 'scratched', 'poor', 'Jr.', 'suddenly', 'inject', 'something', 'heart', 'what', 'good', 'medical', 'emergency', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Not', 'once', 'twice', '5.99', 'can', 'keep', 'should', 'be', 'toll', 'free', 'number', 'where', 'can', 'call', 'get', 'lost', 'time', 'back']",N/A

From the previews and the hype I thought this would blow me away being a huge fan of science fiction.Unfortunately I was blown away in ways that are not so good.First, Will Smith should have been the lead actor.  No offense to Jaden but he is most definitely NOT a believable actor (in this film anyway), and the shoes he had to fill for this role were way too large, and he failed miserably at it.  Not saying his father did a very good job either, in fact Will's acting wasn't all that great, so maybe it wasn't acting but rather script writing.I am thinking M. Night Shyamalan has created another disappointment, and has sadly taken the Smith's down his road of horrid movie making.  In a way I'm fairly embarrassed for both Will and Jaden for even being a part of this film, regardless it will look pretty bad on Jaden's resume on future endeavors.But enough about the acting, the visual effects weren't even that great.  To me the movie seemed to have been filmed with the CG effects of 10 years ago rather than the technology that has stunned us with the likes of Avatar, Prometheus, Oblivion, and I hate to say it but HBO's Game of Thrones has more realistic graphics than this sad excuse for a sci-fi movie.Unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan has created not another addition to sci-fi blockbuster movies this year, instead he has only added another reminder as to why I should pay better attention to who the producers and directors are of a film, because I will most definitely never ever again waste my money on a M. Night Shyamalan film ever.Hopefully you enjoy this movie more than I, but if your reading this I would highly suggest you wait to rent it, instead of spending money at a theater.",1,M.

In pre-production, director M.

I don't think so, as I know there are so many bad sci-fi movies out there, including ""Battlefield Earth."" But there is some campy fun to be had in John Travolta's turkey, which is not at least boring. ""After Earth"" IS boring, with a clich&eacute; storyline, underdeveloped characters and wooden acting from the stars Jaden Smith and Will Smith (credited in that order).Set one thousand years into the future, the film's contrived story follows the relationship between a military father and war hero Cypher Raige (Will Smith) and his underachieving son Kitai (Jaden Smith). They are the only survivors when a spaceship crash lands on Earth, from which humans migrated, having made it inhabitable by environmental pollution. With his father severely injured, the inexperienced son has to retrieve a communication device on his own, on the planet that is now hostile to humans.With the original story idea provided by Will Smith, which is adapted for screen by Shyamalan and Gary Whitta of ""The Book of Eli"" fame, ""After Earth"" strives to be both a sci-fi action and father-and-son drama, but becomes none of them. You don't have much action here, and if there is, it is at best dull and thrill-less, with heavy-handed direction and passable effects. As a drama, the film is devoid of emotion, completely lifeless because of the stiff performances from the stars, who take their roles way too seriously.With visuals that are uninspired, ""After Earth"" is a very long, dull ride.",2,"A Very Long, Dull Ride",1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,1588,"['So', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'latest', 'movie', 'Earth', 'bad', 'worst', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'know', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'there', 'including', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'campy', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'John', 'Travolta', 'turkey', 'not', 'least', 'boring', 'Earth', 'IS', 'boring', 'clich', 'eacute', 'storyline', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'wooden', 'acting', 'stars', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Will', 'Smith', 'credited', 'order', 'one', 'thousand', 'years', 'future', 'film', 'contrived', 'story', 'relationship', 'military', 'father', 'war', 'hero', 'Cypher', 'Raige', 'Will', 'Smith', 'underachieving', 'son', 'Kitai', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'are', 'only', 'survivors', 'when', 'spaceship', 'crash', 'lands', 'Earth', 'humans', 'migrated', 'having', 'made', 'inhabitable', 'environmental', 'pollution', 'father', 'severely', 'injured', 'inexperienced', 'son', 'retrieve', 'communication', 'device', 'own', 'planet', 'now', 'hostile', 'humans.With', 'original', 'story', 'idea', 'provided', 'Will', 'Smith', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Shyamalan', 'Gary', 'Whitta', 'Book', 'Eli', 'fame', 'Earth', 'strives', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'father-and-son', 'drama', 'none', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'action', 'here', 'best', 'dull', 'thrill-less', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'passable', 'effects', 'drama', 'film', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'completely', 'lifeless', 'stiff', 'performances', 'stars', 'who', 'take', 'roles', 'way', 'too', 'seriously.With', 'visuals', 'are', 'uninspired', 'Earth', 'very', 'long', 'dull', 'ride']",N/A

Will played a very serious father and leader.  He had learned not to show fear in order to kill the Ursa's who only can smell pheromones and not see the person they are to fight.  The relationship between father and son was mostly a military type relationship, ""yes sir!"" and so on.  Because the the limited time the father had with his son, he had taught him what he felt he needed to survive in this world. And these things helped his son and himself work to survive their ship crash when there was no one to immediately help them.I thought the scenery and effects were beautiful and the writing was superb.  It was a DIFFERENT movie for Will Smith and he carried it off beautifully.  Jaden is a young man and he did an excellent job.  What do people expect of a young person?  He is learning and getting better all of the time.  This movie did NOT suffer due to Jaden's inexperience in acting.  What do you suppose a young person like that would do in the situation he found himself in?  He was training to be a Ranger but was not accepted yet.  This shows he had much to learn and he wouldn't be some experienced person before his time.I am glad I ordered this movie - it sounded intriguing and I LIKED IT!Here are some details about the Blu-ray / DVD / UV copy set:Case shows ""Blu-ray + DVD"" only.

And to the critics that said Jayden's acting was subpar -- he managed to convey the nature of what the character was feeling and did so quite splendidly... better than the Harry Potter trio at this state of careers.First, this is a ""Coming of Age"" movie set in a futuristic setting with terror at hand. There are no fantastical aliens, yet... and it would be interesting to see the follow up movies to this one... there is bound to be as this was more of a foundation. Jayden's character is probably going to be in the mix.Usually where you have kids playing the hero -- it is absolutely rediculous -- see Harry Potter, and several of the Jurasic Parks where the kids are the heroes -- but here the kid is both reluctant to be the hero, determined to prove he can, and placed as the ONLY CHOICE to be so... this is NOT a Will Smith movie as he only played a supporting role -- this is a Jayden Smith movie and shows that he is growing as good in acting now as he was in Karate Kid... he will be on par with many top actors of today's day, so long as he does not become another hollywood kid statistic.Do I recommend this movie -- Yes and not just to sci-fi-ers but to anyone who is interested in human endurance movies.Final note...

There is nothing about this movie that is even barely unique or that sets it apart from two guys in the woods documenting their camping trip.  Well, maybe the fact that the professionals making After Earth held their camera steady throughout.  Otherwise this thing is perfectly pointless other than giving anyone that felt a dire need to stare at a listless Will Smith for 2 hours with intrusive interruptions from his son.Throughout young Smith is having to run through the wilderness outrunning monsters, beasts, the elements and some super sized chickens.  The only thing young Smith couldn't outrun was his father's immense shadow.  And that's exactly what the very narrative is about.  A son having to make his own identity apart from his father.  Subtly is not to be had during the proceedings of this flick.After watching this movie I can see why 99.9% of hollywood kids don't follow in their parent's footsteps.  I applaud Jaden for doing it.  It's gotta take courage with such an overbearing father.  No offense but that is the only real emotion that Will is able to emote during the entire flick.  Too bad they didn't put more effort into the screenplay; like picking it up off their writer's table and walking it to the trash.This thing is a delight though.  It was bad but not all that particularly boring the first time i watched it.  But i dare say that boredom would not be staved off with any repeated viewing.  And seeing that the point of actually owning a blu-ray is to rematch the movie then beware dear reader.Seriously, this whole movie just reeked of people that work in movies like the rest of work in life.  Some days you are punching the clock, knowing your best work is a long way from the current project at hand.  Will Smith and M Night surely knew this was one of those times they were devoid of any creative idea and it's not about the money or the vanity.  They just have to keep showing up at work, going through the motions.  They're human after all.  There are worst reasons for doing something.  Overall this movie is about the most harmless nonsense coming out this year.  Nobody's sensibilities were offended for good or for bad.  Those like myself that paid $6 at the matinee knew it was better than being stuck in traffic going to the beach.  I'm on pace to see 50 movies at the cinema this year and I knew back in January i was going to have to punch the clock myself to get to that lofty goal.  Granted I also knew I'd see plenty of great movies soon enough; a sentiment i truly don't think M Night will understand but Will will be fine as long as he lets Jaden venture off on his own.",1,"Nothing more to see here, move along",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2683,"['movie', 'permeated', 'complete', 'lack', 'style', 'nothing', 'movie', 'even', 'barely', 'unique', 'apart', 'two', 'guys', 'woods', 'documenting', 'camping', 'trip', 'Well', 'maybe', 'fact', 'professionals', 'making', 'Earth', 'held', 'camera', 'steady', 'Otherwise', 'thing', 'perfectly', 'pointless', 'other', 'giving', 'anyone', 'felt', 'dire', 'need', 'stare', 'listless', 'Will', 'Smith', '2', 'hours', 'intrusive', 'interruptions', 'son.Throughout', 'young', 'Smith', 'having', 'run', 'wilderness', 'outrunning', 'monsters', 'beasts', 'elements', 'super', 'sized', 'chickens', 'only', 'thing', 'young', 'Smith', 'could', ""n't"", 'outrun', 'was', 'father', 'immense', 'shadow', 'exactly', 'what', 'very', 'narrative', 'about', 'son', 'having', 'make', 'own', 'identity', 'apart', 'father', 'Subtly', 'not', 'be', 'had', 'proceedings', 'flick.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'why', '99.9', '%', 'hollywood', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'parent', 'footsteps', 'applaud', 'Jaden', 'doing', 'got', 'ta', 'take', 'courage', 'overbearing', 'father', 'No', 'offense', 'only', 'real', 'emotion', 'Will', 'able', 'emote', 'entire', 'flick', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'screenplay', 'picking', 'off', 'writer', 'table', 'walking', 'trash.This', 'thing', 'delight', 'though', 'was', 'bad', 'not', 'particularly', 'boring', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'watched', 'i', 'dare', 'say', 'boredom', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'staved', 'off', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'seeing', 'point', 'actually', 'owning', 'blu-ray', 'rematch', 'movie', 'then', 'beware', 'dear', 'reader.Seriously', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'reeked', 'people', 'work', 'movies', 'rest', 'work', 'life', 'days', 'are', 'punching', 'clock', 'knowing', 'best', 'work', 'long', 'way', 'current', 'project', 'hand', 'Will', 'Smith', 'M', 'Night', 'surely', 'knew', 'was', 'one', 'times', 'were', 'devoid', 'creative', 'idea', 'not', 'money', 'vanity', 'just', 'have', 'keep', 'showing', 'up', 'work', 'going', 'motions', ""'re"", 'human', 'are', 'worst', 'reasons', 'doing', 'something', 'Overall', 'movie', 'most', 'harmless', 'nonsense', 'coming', 'out', 'year', 'Nobody', 'sensibilities', 'were', 'offended', 'good', 'bad', 'paid', '6', 'matinee', 'knew', 'was', 'better', 'being', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'going', 'beach', ""'m"", 'pace', 'see', '50', 'movies', 'cinema', 'year', 'knew', 'back', 'January', 'i', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'punch', 'clock', 'get', 'lofty', 'goal', 'Granted', 'also', 'knew', ""'d"", 'see', 'plenty', 'great', 'movies', 'soon', 'enough', 'sentiment', 'i', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'M', 'Night', 'will', 'understand', 'Will', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'as', 'long', 'Jaden', 'venture', 'off', 'own']",N/A

I think this is one.It starts with all kinds of great pieces - son struggling to meet father's unrealistic expectations, danger-laden trek across unforgiving landscape, great acts of bravery, victory in the end. Somehow, though the two-actor format (the few other humans are really just props) turns a 100km trek into something claustrophobic. Then, Will Smith tries to channel his inner Laurence Fishburne, forgetting that Fishburne already does the job much better. Then there's the family relationship built around chain of command - trust me, this has more weirdness than even this flick can show. Then there's the whole notion of what 'fear' is and what purpose it serves. I've had my share, and find it to be a great way of focusing one's attention just when it's needed most.Oh, it has its moments, like that wing-suited base jump. But a good movie is more than moments.
