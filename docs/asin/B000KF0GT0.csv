1033503,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B000KF0GT0,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[1, 1]","Some kids are driving in an RV on some back roads.  They notice some lights in the sky, then they crash into a pickup truck that's parked next to the road.  One guy falls on a knife that was lying on the floor.  Luckily the guy who was driving the pickup knows some first aid, and fixes him up using super glue.  Yeah, he probably hasn't got long to live, LOL.  Everybody else is pretty unconcerned with their mortally wounded ""friend"", and spend most of the movie discussing their relationship problems.  Then some aliens start...appearing.  They might as well be Bigfoot or maybe even mind-controlling evil trolls, it doesn't really matter.  It's not like they do anything ""alien"" to these people other than terrorize them a bit.  Kind of funny actually, they can travel all the way here from another planet yet they can't break through the door on an RV.After a somewhat exciting scene with the RV being attacked by something from outside, we move on to the next part of the movie - I won't spoil it - but suffice it to say I was expecting another ten or fifteen minutes before the movie eventually built to its climax.  Instead, it just ended.  Yup, roll credits, we're done here.  What happened to half the characters?  Don't know, we're through, wrap it up already.The characters were mildly interesting, the plot was fairly disappointing because it relied on people getting confused (or maybe their minds were being controlled?).  Eh, doesn't really matter I guess.  Overall, I've seen much worse, but that doesn't mean this thing is especially good either.

This is supposed to be actually what happened that night and its pretty scary, and there were a lot of mysterious supporting evidence to support the mans claims of what happened to him and the rest of the group involved in the incident, not to mention the man was found more then 100 miles away from his vehicle half buried in a wash and the blood from a few other people that have never been found and have never been identified as well as their RV never showed up but the fact that there were blood from several other people and there is no way to account for the man being over 100 miles away from his wrecked vehicle...

I knew right away that when I read on the cover it is based on a true story that that was not true, I refuse to believe that, but I hoped for an interesting story and a decent movie tho.However I soon discovered that a group of friends driving there R.V who spot a bunch of light's in the sky and end up crashing because the driver did not notice a man and his broken down car on the side road end's up making them skid into a power pole and crash.One of them end's up with a knife in his back and the driver of the broken down car end's up trying to help them as a couple of them venture into the woods and get picked off by ""aliens"" like a Jason Voorhee's could have done it.Then they come back, yelling away, blah blah blah, let's get out of here, oh no she's dead, the aliens have abducted us, the dingo stole my baby and then end credits.Overall, this movie as I expected was claimed to be based on a true story, which is a lie, it's just to get your attention, and then the plot is not at all well thought out, and then goes into a lot of a waste of time to watch and thing's that could have been done better.About the only decent idea they had was that when aliens perform surgery, they can use a goo of some kind to make human skin transparent, yet does not allow blood to poor out.I suppose if you love B-movies where the cast don't act like anything but actors trying to be cool, swearing in useless and unbelievable dialog, and 3 woman with firm chesticles that they half expose most of the time making sure you can see right down there top's for an excuse of, ""at least if you can't stand our acting you can stare at these puppies"" then this is the perfect movie for you.....

First off this is a typical B horror movie with a very low budget. When you have a low budget you can't afford great actors. These type of movies are made for fans of B horror. I'm not sure why people dissect these films and try to find everything that's wrong with the film. You are going to find hundreads of things wrong with this movie it's low budget. I loved the fact that they used a true event and created a story out of the Arizona sightings. I knew it was not all real. Come on people how can you believe this really happened. Only the lights in the sky are true events the rest is made up story. This movie was pretty good compared to other movies of its genre. I loved this movie just as well as I loved Altered. The idea of this film was great and I give the director his props for making a great little B horror movie that I can add to my collection. If you liked this movie check out Altered this movie was awsome as well. I'm sorry I just don't think people understand that not all movies can be big budget with great actors. You guys can keep your high priced tickets and your stale popcorn. Give me a B horror movie and taco bell and I'm in heaven. You can pay $12 dollars for a movie that's okay like Fourth Kind.I only paid $2 dollars for this movie on Amazon I will stick to my low budget movies and see the actors who will become future stars.,4,What do people expect?,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1471,"['have', 'read', 'reviews', 'people', 'have', 'left', 'movie', 'still', 'shocked', 'what', 'complain', 'First', 'typical', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'When', 'have', 'low', 'budget', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'great', 'actors', 'type', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'fans', 'B', 'horror', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'people', 'dissect', 'films', 'try', 'find', 'everything', 'wrong', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'hundreads', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'loved', 'fact', 'used', 'true', 'event', 'created', 'story', 'Arizona', 'sightings', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'Come', 'people', 'how', 'can', 'believe', 'really', 'happened', 'Only', 'lights', 'sky', 'are', 'true', 'events', 'rest', 'made', 'up', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'compared', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'loved', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'loved', 'Altered', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'give', 'director', 'props', 'making', 'great', 'little', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'can', 'add', 'collection', 'liked', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'Altered', 'movie', 'was', 'awsome', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'understand', 'not', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'big', 'budget', 'great', 'actors', 'guys', 'can', 'keep', 'high', 'priced', 'tickets', 'stale', 'popcorn', 'Give', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'taco', 'bell', ""'m"", 'heaven', 'can', 'pay', '12', 'dollars', 'movie', 'okay', 'like', 'Fourth', 'Kind.I', 'only', 'paid', '2', 'dollars', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'will', 'stick', 'low', 'budget', 'movies', 'see', 'actors', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'future', 'stars']",N/A

I liked the incorporation of this event into the movie, both the use of actual footage from the sighting and the movie's well done special effects depiction of the lights as seen by the characters in the film. I also liked - and was surprised - by the inclusion in the first few moments of the movie of Senator John McCain being asked in a press conference about the lights, that was well done (and unlike the trickery used to include President Bill Clinton in the movie _Contact_, was using footage directly related to what the movie was about).The other event, not something I had heard about previously, was the story of a Gulf War veteran, stranded on a backroad in very rural Arizona and the five people in a RV who ran into him. Both vehicles disabled, the soldier and the people in the RV (a married couple, a couple that was engaged, and the sister to one of the men) at first mostly bicker about whose fault it is, try to save the life of the one of the men in the RV who was severely injured in the crash of the RV, and try to get the vehicle repaired to get him to the hospital. Soon however it becomes clear that there is something in the woods, something sinister, one that can play tricks with their minds, make them see things that aren't there, and one by one try to pick off and abduct the various members of this thrown-together group.The feeling of the film - the briefly glimpsed aliens, people and things suddenly appearing behind people, the rustling in the brush, the screaming, the running, and yes some of the blood - had more in common with a horror movie than a typical science fiction movie (not that that is a bad thing). The alien's motivations were sinister, to abduct the humans (causing maximum terror while doing it, naturally) and them probe them horrifically in their spaceship  (which was suitable creepy and organic and gooey in make-up).Not a bad film I guess, I would rate is as good as some of the best of the much improved Sci Fi Saturday night movies of the week. The alien make up was pretty well done, the lights in the sky were very eerie, and I will admit it, one of the girls, the sister, was very good-looking (Ashley Peldon was the actress's name, playing the character Molly). While her character was not particularly deep she was not unpleasant to look at. Overall though the acting was adequate, nothing spectacular though not awful either. I didn't like the way the opening credits were done, a diced-up montage in almost slow motion of a horror scene from later in the movie, it made the film feel to me at least cheaper and more poorly done than it really was. Production values were not bad and if alien abduction movies are your thing (or the _X-Files_) I would say give it a look.",3,"Decent science fiction/horror film based on ""true events""",1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,3189,"['_Night', 'Skies_', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Wayne', 'Beckham', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'horror', 'science', 'fiction.The', 'movie', 'claimed', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'one', 'event', 'pretty', 'well', 'documented', 'other', 'news', 'documented', 'one', 'was', 'March', '13', '1997', 'sighting', 'filming', 'unidentified', 'lights', 'Arizona', 'night', 'sky', 'thousands', 'people', 'sighting', 'still', 'debated', 'day', 'liked', 'incorporation', 'event', 'movie', 'use', 'actual', 'footage', 'sighting', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'depiction', 'lights', 'seen', 'characters', 'film', 'also', 'liked', 'was', 'surprised', 'inclusion', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'movie', 'Senator', 'John', 'McCain', 'being', 'asked', 'press', 'conference', 'lights', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'trickery', 'used', 'include', 'President', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'movie', '_Contact_', 'was', 'using', 'footage', 'directly', 'related', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'other', 'event', 'not', 'something', 'had', 'heard', 'previously', 'was', 'story', 'Gulf', 'War', 'veteran', 'stranded', 'backroad', 'very', 'rural', 'Arizona', 'five', 'people', 'RV', 'who', 'ran', 'vehicles', 'disabled', 'soldier', 'people', 'RV', 'married', 'couple', 'couple', 'was', 'engaged', 'sister', 'one', 'men', 'first', 'mostly', 'bicker', 'fault', 'try', 'save', 'life', 'one', 'men', 'RV', 'who', 'was', 'severely', 'injured', 'crash', 'RV', 'try', 'get', 'vehicle', 'repaired', 'get', 'hospital', 'Soon', 'however', 'clear', 'something', 'woods', 'something', 'sinister', 'one', 'can', 'play', 'tricks', 'minds', 'make', 'see', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'one', 'one', 'try', 'pick', 'off', 'abduct', 'various', 'members', 'thrown-together', 'group.The', 'feeling', 'film', 'briefly', 'glimpsed', 'aliens', 'people', 'things', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'people', 'rustling', 'brush', 'screaming', 'running', 'yes', 'blood', 'had', 'more', 'common', 'horror', 'movie', 'typical', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'alien', 'motivations', 'were', 'sinister', 'abduct', 'humans', 'causing', 'maximum', 'terror', 'doing', 'naturally', 'probe', 'horrifically', 'spaceship', 'was', 'suitable', 'creepy', 'organic', 'gooey', 'make-up', 'bad', 'film', 'guess', 'would', 'rate', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'much', 'improved', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Saturday', 'night', 'movies', 'week', 'alien', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'lights', 'sky', 'were', 'very', 'eerie', 'will', 'admit', 'one', 'girls', 'sister', 'was', 'very', 'good-looking', 'Ashley', 'Peldon', 'was', 'actress', 'name', 'playing', 'character', 'Molly', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'deep', 'was', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'look', 'acting', 'was', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'not', 'awful', 'either', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'done', 'diced-up', 'montage', 'almost', 'slow', 'motion', 'horror', 'scene', 'later', 'movie', 'made', 'film', 'feel', 'least', 'cheaper', 'more', 'poorly', 'done', 'really', 'was', 'Production', 'values', 'were', 'not', 'bad', 'alien', 'abduction', 'movies', 'are', 'thing', '_X-Files_', 'would', 'say', 'give', 'look']",N/A

1033518,A2RO40LIBUA67E,B000KF0GT0,"Wayne Beckham ""Military vet, defense contacto...","[24, 25]","First off, the movie's not as bad other reviews may have made out.  Just know what you're in for.  This is a horror film - not science fiction!""Night Skies"" bills itself as based on a true-story and, in a very twisted way, it is.  There was in fact a whole series of unexplained lights sighted over Phoenix Arizona, ten years ago this coming March, by millions of people, virtually none of whom believed any of the official explanations (which changed four times.)There was not, however, any reports by anybody of being stranded on an outback road and being subjected to a horrific alien abduction.  Unfortunately, using the (genuine) Phoenix Lights sighting as a pretext for the (fictional) abductions shown in the movie is just about the only original idea in this movie.But let me praise before I criticize - the movie starts out very effectively, beginning with a clip of Senator John McCain commenting on UFO's in general and discussing the Phoenix Lights in particular.  There's also effective use of some genuine footage of the Phoenix Lights as shot by actual eyewitnesses.  The lighting is very good and gives a real feeling of isolation and claustrophobia in equal parts.  Marsy Blasgen's creature effects are very good - the aliens are suitably spooky and just ""grey"" enough to satisfy most UFOlogist types.The acting is as good as it can be, given the limitations of the characters.  There's only three interesting characters, Jason Connery as Richard, A.J. Cook as Lilly, and Ashley Peldon, who plays a yummy (and all-too-brief) eye-candy part as Molly.  Everyone else never really develops into anything except as caricatures placed in the script to get the body count up.  Even the suggestion of romance waiting to bloom between Richard and Molly is snuffed out by evil aliens, obviously disinterested in character development or the integrity of the plot line.  Still, don't think that I'm entirely discarding the actor's performances - they're doing their best.  There's just not much to work with.Maybe I'm just being too critical of these particular aliens, who have none of the finesse we've come to expect from years of ""X-Files.""  Instead of paralyzing their victims, floating them through any barrier, into antiseptically clean examination rooms where painless procedures are performed in the name of (alien) science, these guys are a little more, shall we say, direct.  These seem to be the alien equivalent of back-woods, inbred hillbilly's busting through windows, blasting down doors, (completely leveling one structure) and grabbing their teen victims with the shocking suddenness of a Jason or Freddy.And that's my real problem with this move - and a minor complaint given the genre: slasher-flick.  As I watched the story unfold I got a weird feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu - I had seen all this somewhere before.  Had I been abducted by aliens, only to have the appalling memories sealed away forever?Unfortunately, the truth is less compelling.  Ideas and concepts from many, many horror films are lifted almost verbatim and thrown into the plot in a frantic fashion.  You'll recognize scenes from ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Fire in the Sky,"" and (the most obvious of all) ""Carrie.""Still, if you liked the Freddy or Jason franchises, you'll enjoy this movie.

1033519,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000KF0GT0,Wuchak,"[1, 2]","Released on DVD in January, 2007, ""Night Skies"" is an alien encounter film based on the UFO sightings in Arizona on March 13, 1997.I was hesitant to give this film a chance because the plot was so thin, as seen in the trailer: On the night of the UFO sightings a group of youths in an RV come across a man in a broken-down truck and then, frighteningly, have an encounter with aliens.After viewing the film, the thin plot and the resulting padding is the only real negative, unless you count the low-budget, which means a very confined location and only a handful of characters. But since that's what the movie's about (a small group of people in a remote location) that's not really a problem.Other than that the film delivers with:- A serious, non-campy approach. Someone likened ""Night Skies"" to the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise (Friday the 13th: From Crystal Lake to Manhattan Ultimate Collection (Part 1 / Part 2 / Part 3 / Part IV: The Final Chapter / Part V: A New Beginning / Part VI: Jason Lives / Part VII: The New Blood / Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan)) with the exception that Jason is substituted for aliens. Although this is pretty accurate, ""Night Skies"" lacks the goofy entertaining vibe of most of the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels. In other words, the filmmakers and cast take the material serious. What would happen if a group of youths and a stranded man really came across some scary aliens and were abducted? This film shows you.- A quality cast. Jason Connery is great as the sympathetic stranger with a troubled past. Jason is Sean's son, of course, and very reminiscent of Will Patton in ""The Mothman Prophecies."" Also on hand is Ashley Peldon; she's petite, beautiful and likable. Her character, Molly, senses something admirable and benevolent in the stranger, despite his past struggles. This shows that the writers at least tried to give the characters depth. The only unlikable character is Matt, the clich&eacute;d arrogant ""alpha male"" who thinks with his crotch and fists. All the actors do their part to convey a serious, frightening situation, not that I found the movie scary (though some may), but neither was I laughing (as with most of the ""Friday the 13th"" flicks).- Although the soundtrack isn't all that noticeable it contributes to the serious, frightening vibe of the film. There's also a decent rock/metal song played during the closing credits ""Dragon"" by Feersum Ennjin, Paul D'Amour's band. Paul was the original bassist for Tool during theUndertowperiod, which featured the devastatingly honest & potent ""Sober.""- At around the hour mark I was thinking that this would be one of those lame alien-encounter movies that fail to deliver, but the final act gives you everything you might want in a movie of this nature. I won't say anymore. Let's just say the film doesn't wuss out on the abduction factor and the F/X are good.The film was shot in California (L.A. and Santa Clarita) and runs a lean 1 hour, 23 minutes, which is good since movies like this shouldn't overstay their welcome.FINAL WORD: There's not much else to say, ""Night Skies"" has a thin plot, confined locations and few characters, but it takes its subject seriously, has quality actors and gives the viewer everything you might want from an alien-encounter flick.GRADE: B",4,"""Night Skies"" delivers",1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,3285,"['Released', 'DVD', 'January', '2007', 'Night', 'Skies', 'alien', 'encounter', 'film', 'based', 'UFO', 'sightings', 'Arizona', 'March', '13', '1997.I', 'was', 'hesitant', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'thin', 'seen', 'trailer', 'night', 'UFO', 'group', 'youths', 'RV', 'come', 'man', 'broken-down', 'truck', 'then', 'frighteningly', 'have', 'encounter', 'aliens.After', 'viewing', 'film', 'thin', 'plot', 'resulting', 'padding', 'only', 'real', 'negative', 'count', 'low-budget', 'very', 'confined', 'location', 'only', 'handful', 'characters', 'what', 'movie', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'remote', 'location', 'not', 'really', 'problem.Other', 'film', 'delivers', 'serious', 'non-campy', 'approach', 'Someone', 'likened', 'Night', 'Skies', 'Friday', '13th', 'franchise', 'Friday', '13th', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'Manhattan', 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'Part', '1', '/', 'Part', '2', '/', 'Part', '3', '/', 'Part', 'IV', 'Final', 'Chapter', '/', 'Part', 'V', 'New', 'Beginning', '/', 'Part', 'VI', 'Jason', '/', 'Part', 'VII', 'New', 'Blood', '/', 'Part', 'VIII', 'Jason', 'Takes', 'Manhattan', 'exception', 'Jason', 'substituted', 'aliens', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'Night', 'Skies', 'goofy', 'entertaining', 'vibe', 'most', 'Friday', '13th', 'sequels', 'other', 'words', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'take', 'material', 'serious', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'group', 'youths', 'stranded', 'man', 'really', 'came', 'scary', 'aliens', 'were', 'abducted', 'film', 'you.-', 'quality', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'great', 'sympathetic', 'stranger', 'troubled', 'past', 'Jason', 'Sean', 'son', 'course', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'Also', 'hand', 'Ashley', 'Peldon', 'petite', 'beautiful', 'likable', 'character', 'Molly', 'something', 'admirable', 'benevolent', 'stranger', 'past', 'struggles', 'writers', 'least', 'tried', 'give', 'characters', 'depth', 'only', 'unlikable', 'character', 'Matt', 'clich', 'eacute', 'arrogant', 'alpha', 'male', 'who', 'crotch', 'fists', 'actors', 'do', 'part', 'convey', 'serious', 'frightening', 'situation', 'not', 'found', 'movie', 'scary', 'may', 'was', 'laughing', 'most', 'Friday', '13th', 'flicks', '.-', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'noticeable', 'serious', 'frightening', 'vibe', 'film', 'also', 'decent', 'rock/metal', 'song', 'played', 'closing', 'Dragon', 'Feersum', 'Ennjin', 'Paul', ""D'Amour"", 'band', 'Paul', 'was', 'original', 'bassist', 'Tool', 'theUndertowperiod', 'featured', 'devastatingly', 'honest', 'potent', 'Sober', 'hour', 'mark', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'lame', 'alien-encounter', 'movies', 'fail', 'deliver', 'final', 'act', 'everything', 'might', 'want', 'movie', 'nature', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'wuss', 'out', 'abduction', 'factor', 'F/X', 'are', 'good.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'California', 'L.A.', 'Santa', 'Clarita', 'lean', '1', 'hour', '23', 'minutes', 'good', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome.FINAL', 'WORD', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'Night', 'Skies', 'thin', 'plot', 'confined', 'locations', 'few', 'characters', 'subject', 'seriously', 'quality', 'actors', 'viewer', 'everything', 'might', 'want', 'alien-encounter', 'flick.GRADE', 'B']",N/A
