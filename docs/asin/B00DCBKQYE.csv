1654859,AEUEY5LC2GREG,B00DCBKQYE,ancient submariner,"[0, 0]","OK, I get the point, the place is haunted and he is scared.  But the plot is missing.  They begin with a shirtless man with a hammer being arrested.  He may or may not be the main character.  But the police report there was 3 people killed in the house that the main character was investigating.  He is a writer/ghost hunter, and is making a documentary of the farm that is allegedly the most haunted house in Australia.  I have seen other reports about this house and its environs.  The main character is somehow left alone at the house for the night.  Hints are made that it is not good to investigate haunted houses alone.  It is in fact against the 'Ghost hunter's creed'.  Lights go on, lights go off.  Furniture is moved, but the movers appear to be thoughtful about it.  No damage to the furniture was done.  Part of the story gets moved into a second house on the property which may have been a carriage house.  A man in the credits is listed as the 3D animator, but the only effect that is seen is a brief backwards shot of a man falling out of a wardrobe, so he looks like he is being thrown in.  The whole thing seems about as random as this review.  I like found footage films (if they are good) and paranormal investigation films (again, if they are good), but this is in need of a good storyteller and a good editor.  Someone compares this to the original 'The Haunting'  but Iain P.F. McDonald ain't Julie Harris and the director ain't Robert Wise.

This is a film for fans of found footage movies like Paranormal Activity and Ghost Hunters.  I expected a good chilly ghost story and I got exactly that with great attention to the details, and some good scare tactics. It takes a bit for the scares to start, but when it does, its chilling.

I must have a brain aneurism (I was going to look up how to spell that word, but for this movie I figured why waste the effort.)  What did I like about this movie?  The end credits.  Plus, the fact they saved tons of valuable production dollars by not offering any background music.  A good sound track would've made all the difference.  I might've given it 2.000001 stars instead.  They saved even more by hand-held cameras and basically one actor.  Why pay people when you can simply have them phone in their performance.  I gave it two stars for the post editing.  I mean, it could've really been a badder (not concerned if that's a word or not) movie if they didn't have a great editor.  I started making comments to myself just to provide a little entertainment.  My favorite was during the chair stacking scene.  I said, (out loud by the way), &#34;I think he's upset some interior decorators to make them move those chairs like that.&#34;  I know.  It's not funny, but neither is this movie.  Oh wait, it's not a comedy.  Which is ok.  Since it's definitely not a horror/thriller/suspense movie either.
