Kevin Whately is very amusing as Lewis, and you will love the serious Laurence Fox as his partner, Hathaway- they constantly ""rib"" each other and there are many funny lines which provide comic relief to the serious cases.These characters have great chemistry, and there is a love story also with Lewis and Dr. Laura Hobson, and they finally hook up in the last show, after much 'will they or won't they', involving a very sweet romance.  I think I clapped when they finally got together.The show is very intelligent and has the amazing backdrop of Oxford, I feel smarter for just watching the show.

We liked the mysteries, even though information sufficient to figure out &#34;whodunit&#34; often doesn't appear until near the end.  We purchased this set because of the intellectual approach to the mysteries, but we have become fans because of the interaction among the four main characters.  We have enjoyed watching the growth in the relationships as the series moved forward.  There is often rather witty by play between Lewis and Hathaway, which we greatly enjoy.  With anywhere from two to four murders per episode, Oxford must be the murder capital of the civilized world.  Even so, we are on our second pass through the series and are still picking up new things we didn't quite catch the first time through.",5,New Inspector Lewis fans,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,789,"['caught', 'couple', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'PBS', 'traveling', 'liked', 'mysteries', 'even', 'information', 'sufficient', 'figure', 'out', '34', 'whodunit', '34', 'often', ""n't"", 'appear', 'end', 'purchased', 'set', 'intellectual', 'approach', 'mysteries', 'have', 'become', 'fans', 'interaction', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'growth', 'relationships', 'series', 'moved', 'forward', 'often', 'rather', 'witty', 'play', 'Lewis', 'Hathaway', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'anywhere', 'two', 'four', 'murders', 'episode', 'Oxford', 'must', 'be', 'murder', 'capital', 'civilized', 'world', 'Even', 'so', 'are', 'second', 'pass', 'series', 'are', 'still', 'picking', 'up', 'new', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'catch', 'first', 'time']",N/A
1661446,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00DUX28XQ,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[58, 58]","Following what was most likely the last ever episode of Lewis, this is the DVD set we have all been waiting for.  It contains all 27 episodes in the six seasons of Inspector Lewis including the original pilot.  Do not be misled by the Amazon description which at the time of writing states a running time of 430 minutes - I presume it will be corrected in due course.  In fact these 14 discs run to no less than 2,430 minutes, which is enough to keep us all absorbed for some time!  Most importantly these are stated to be the full length UK edition - there has been much criticism of cuts made for the North American releases of some of the Lewis DVD sets in the past.It is hard to believe that the pilot show was broadcast as recently as 2006, as it seems that Inspector Lewis has been part of our viewing lives for so much longer.  I think this is to a large extent, because the character of Lewis first appeared in Morse as long ago as 1986 and has been played by Kevin Whately throughout.  Few would have imagined initially that Inspector Lewis would be as successful as Morse, but it has certainly achieved at least as much as that series.  Just as the chemistry between Sergeant Lewis, as he was then, and Morse (John Thaw) was a defining strength in that show, the bond between Lewis and DS James Hathaway (Laurence Fox) has increased with time and has been one of the main strengths of Inspector Lewis.To my mind the other factor which has made Lewis such a success is the excellent script writing.  The stories are varied and complex.  This is not the sort of drama which you are going to be able to watch with one eye on something else and still pick up all the detail of the plot, as you can with much of what is shown on TV.  However, the stories are clever and satisfying and well worth the effort to follow them closely.  They are also the sort of show which it is worth returning to again and again, and we often revisit the earlier episodes.There are some bonus features included with this set including `The Making of Inspector Lewis' and an interview with Kevin Whately.  Although there was a certain finality about the final episode of Lewis at the end of Season 6, there are some faint grounds for hope as a spokesperson for ITV, the production company, has stated that the series `may' return in 2014 either as a one off show or a series.  I imagine it all depends on the willingness of Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox to continue as they both seemed keen to move on to other things.",5,Compelling Viewing,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,2504,"['Following', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'last', 'ever', 'episode', 'Lewis', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', '27', 'episodes', 'six', 'seasons', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'including', 'original', 'pilot', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'misled', 'Amazon', 'description', 'time', 'writing', 'states', 'running', 'time', '430', 'minutes', 'presume', 'will', 'be', 'corrected', 'due', 'course', 'fact', '14', 'discs', 'run', 'less', '2,430', 'minutes', 'enough', 'keep', 'absorbed', 'time', 'Most', 'importantly', 'are', 'stated', 'be', 'full', 'length', 'UK', 'edition', 'been', 'much', 'criticism', 'cuts', 'made', 'North', 'American', 'releases', 'Lewis', 'DVD', 'sets', 'past.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'pilot', 'show', 'was', 'broadcast', 'as', 'recently', '2006', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'been', 'part', 'viewing', 'lives', 'so', 'much', 'longer', 'think', 'large', 'extent', 'character', 'Lewis', 'first', 'appeared', 'Morse', 'long', 'ago', '1986', 'been', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'Few', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'initially', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'successful', 'Morse', 'certainly', 'achieved', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'series', 'Just', 'chemistry', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'was', 'then', 'Morse', 'John', 'Thaw', 'was', 'defining', 'strength', 'show', 'bond', 'Lewis', 'DS', 'James', 'Hathaway', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'increased', 'time', 'been', 'one', 'main', 'strengths', 'Inspector', 'Lewis.To', 'mind', 'other', 'factor', 'made', 'Lewis', 'such', 'success', 'excellent', 'script', 'writing', 'stories', 'are', 'varied', 'complex', 'not', 'sort', 'drama', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'one', 'eye', 'something', 'else', 'still', 'pick', 'up', 'detail', 'plot', 'can', 'much', 'what', 'shown', 'TV', 'However', 'stories', 'are', 'clever', 'satisfying', 'well', 'effort', 'follow', 'closely', 'are', 'also', 'sort', 'show', 'worth', 'returning', 'again', 'again', 'often', 'revisit', 'earlier', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'set', 'including', 'Making', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'interview', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'was', 'certain', 'finality', 'final', 'episode', 'Lewis', 'end', 'Season', '6', 'are', 'faint', 'grounds', 'hope', 'spokesperson', 'ITV', 'production', 'company', 'stated', 'series', 'may', 'return', '2014', 'one', 'off', 'show', 'series', 'imagine', 'willingness', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'continue', 'seemed', 'keen', 'move', 'other', 'things']",N/A
