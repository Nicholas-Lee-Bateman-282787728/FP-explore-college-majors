568513,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B0000560W6,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[7, 8]","I guess I need to explain my three stars as having nothing to do with the content of this movie. So I'll present the pros first,then the cons. Well obviously I watched this 70's TV movie (well on DVD that is) because I see Harriet Tubman as an often forgotten American hero who not only formed the ""underground railroad"" and personally led many slaves to freedom in the north but her later involvment in the Civil War and her later crusades for the early stirrings of woman's rights in the suffergete movement. I read books about her as a child and Harriet Tubman is even the subject of a painting I made a few years ago. Cicily Tyson does an incredible job as Harriet,who starts out a slave of course,bitter and angry at the injustices around her.She endures many of the humiliations accorded to slaves (including being used on one occasion as a human mule) and the equally demeaning concept of her and her husband having to ""buy their way"" to freedom. In her disgust against this system she turns her energy toward creating a system allowing slaves to escape to the northern states to be free people. The movie plays out her transition from a broken down slave into a confident woman ""called moses"". Orson Welles adds a narration to the affair.So the actual content of the movie is wonderful and I think everyone interested in any type of history and social injuctice being undone should definately see this. The minus side has to do with the reason this gets only three stars from me-the movie itself is five stars all the way but the presentation does in fact leave a lot to be desired. It's apparent that this DVD was transferred from a VHS tape and even that being the case it looks like it was taped directly off of TV as the series aired. There has been zero effort to enhance the quality of the picture let alone remaster the movie. And that does a great disservice to this classic.But nevertheless if you can overlook the poor quality of the production values this is something more then worth your time to check out.",3,Harriet Tubman-An American Hero,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,2027,"['guess', 'need', 'explain', 'three', 'stars', 'having', 'nothing', 'do', 'content', 'movie', 'So', ""'ll"", 'present', 'pros', 'first', 'then', 'cons', 'Well', 'obviously', 'watched', '70', 'TV', 'movie', 'well', 'DVD', 'see', 'Harriet', 'Tubman', 'often', 'forgotten', 'American', 'hero', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'formed', 'underground', 'railroad', 'personally', 'led', 'many', 'slaves', 'freedom', 'north', 'later', 'involvment', 'Civil', 'War', 'later', 'crusades', 'early', 'stirrings', 'woman', 'rights', 'suffergete', 'movement', 'read', 'books', 'child', 'Harriet', 'Tubman', 'even', 'subject', 'painting', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Cicily', 'Tyson', 'incredible', 'job', 'Harriet', 'who', 'out', 'slave', 'course', 'bitter', 'angry', 'injustices', 'her.She', 'many', 'humiliations', 'accorded', 'slaves', 'including', 'being', 'used', 'one', 'occasion', 'human', 'mule', 'equally', 'demeaning', 'concept', 'husband', 'having', 'buy', 'way', 'freedom', 'disgust', 'system', 'energy', 'creating', 'system', 'allowing', 'slaves', 'escape', 'northern', 'states', 'be', 'free', 'people', 'movie', 'out', 'transition', 'broken', 'down', 'slave', 'confident', 'woman', 'called', 'moses', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'narration', 'affair.So', 'actual', 'content', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'think', 'everyone', 'interested', 'type', 'history', 'social', 'injuctice', 'being', 'undone', 'should', 'definately', 'see', 'minus', 'side', 'do', 'reason', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'me-the', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'way', 'presentation', 'fact', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'apparent', 'DVD', 'was', 'transferred', 'VHS', 'tape', 'even', 'being', 'case', 'was', 'taped', 'directly', 'TV', 'series', 'aired', 'been', 'zero', 'effort', 'enhance', 'quality', 'picture', 'let', 'alone', 'remaster', 'movie', 'great', 'disservice', 'classic.But', 'nevertheless', 'can', 'overlook', 'poor', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'something', 'more', 'then', 'time', 'check', 'out']",N/A
568514,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0000560W6,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","Cicely Tyson gets to show what she's made of playing a woman who was apparently made of pure steel: Harriet Tubman. She had a hell of a time as a slave, although occasionally given opportunities other slaves didn't get. She had a hell of a time escaping to land in Philadelphia among a group of staunch abolitionists, many of whom were Quakers and many of the rest were escaped slaves themselves. But she decided to go back and become a conductor -- no, more like an engineer -- on the Underground Railroad. History tells us she brought hundreds to freedom, but never lost a single ""passenger."" But Cicely Tyson, at the top of her career, does not tell us, she shows us.I do not think I saw this made-for-TV movie before, but one scene is so familiar that I suspect I saw an excerpt or perhaps one episode of the series. The master who had given her opportunities (and took half of the money she earned selling the vegetables she grew) turned on her in a most humiliating way. He tricked her into pulling a fully-laden cart, saying the mule had run off. But all along the roadway were his elegant white friends, making bets on how well she would do.Still, she saved the money she earned, and finally had as much as she had heard her master (the other one was the one she was loaned out to) say she was worth: $200. She took it to him to buy her freedom, only to have him say she was worth more than $1,000.Another unusual aspect of her life is that her husband was a freedman, at least in a way. Apparently he had to pay for freeman papers, which expired. So he ""borrowed"" her freedom money to pay for his own freedom. Real nice guy.Anyway, this is a heart-wrenching story which is also very inspiring. You get a chance to see what real courage is, and why modern-day African-Americans are way tougher than you might think. Because Tubman and people like her are indeed in their blood, and in their cultural heritage as well, and they can do what they need to do. And so we have an African-American president and a lot of really superior people walking around in brown skin.And of course we whites can be proud, too, to the extent we can identify with the abolitionists who risked their lives to help them. I'm proud of the fact that the Pennsylvania Dutch were active in the underground railroad. In fact, my grandparents' old farm house had a hideaway in the basement which I am told was a stop on the railroad. We used it for a root cellar and storage of my grandmother's canned fruit and vegetables.For too long, we have been told to be ashamed of our history of slavery. But we also have a history of fighting against it and defeating it.",4,Brilliant Black History Drama,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2643,"['Cicely', 'Tyson', 'show', 'what', 'made', 'playing', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'made', 'pure', 'steel', 'Harriet', 'Tubman', 'had', 'hell', 'time', 'slave', 'occasionally', 'given', 'opportunities', 'other', 'slaves', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'had', 'hell', 'time', 'escaping', 'land', 'Philadelphia', 'group', 'staunch', 'abolitionists', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'Quakers', 'many', 'rest', 'were', 'escaped', 'slaves', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'become', 'conductor', 'more', 'engineer', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'History', 'brought', 'hundreds', 'freedom', 'never', 'lost', 'single', 'passenger', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'top', 'career', 'not', 'tell', 'us.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'saw', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'so', 'familiar', 'suspect', 'saw', 'excerpt', 'perhaps', 'one', 'episode', 'series', 'master', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'opportunities', 'took', 'half', 'money', 'earned', 'selling', 'vegetables', 'grew', 'turned', 'most', 'humiliating', 'way', 'tricked', 'pulling', 'fully-laden', 'cart', 'saying', 'mule', 'had', 'run', 'off', 'roadway', 'were', 'elegant', 'white', 'friends', 'making', 'bets', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'do.Still', 'saved', 'money', 'earned', 'finally', 'had', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'heard', 'master', 'other', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'loaned', 'out', 'say', 'was', 'worth', '200', 'took', 'buy', 'freedom', 'only', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'more', '1,000.Another', 'unusual', 'aspect', 'life', 'husband', 'was', 'freedman', 'least', 'way', 'Apparently', 'had', 'pay', 'freeman', 'papers', 'expired', 'borrowed', 'freedom', 'money', 'pay', 'own', 'freedom', 'Real', 'nice', 'guy.Anyway', 'heart-wrenching', 'story', 'also', 'very', 'inspiring', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'real', 'courage', 'why', 'modern-day', 'African-Americans', 'are', 'way', 'tougher', 'might', 'think', 'Tubman', 'people', 'are', 'indeed', 'blood', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'need', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'African-American', 'president', 'lot', 'really', 'superior', 'people', 'walking', 'around', 'brown', 'skin.And', 'course', 'whites', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'too', 'extent', 'can', 'identify', 'abolitionists', 'who', 'risked', 'lives', 'help', ""'m"", 'proud', 'fact', 'Pennsylvania', 'Dutch', 'were', 'active', 'underground', 'railroad', 'fact', 'grandparents', 'old', 'farm', 'house', 'had', 'hideaway', 'basement', 'am', 'told', 'was', 'stop', 'railroad', 'used', 'root', 'cellar', 'storage', 'grandmother', 'canned', 'fruit', 'vegetables.For', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'be', 'ashamed', 'history', 'slavery', 'also', 'have', 'history', 'fighting', 'defeating']",N/A
