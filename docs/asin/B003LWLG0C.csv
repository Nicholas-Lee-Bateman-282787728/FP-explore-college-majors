Otherwise, I have no idea what the other reviewers were looking at that they gave such good reviews and hence I bought this dvd. It was just plain poor acting from start to finish.  The older leather daddy gave me the creeps when he started to kiss the young 20 something rather fey boy. Considering that the boy did have very kissable lips which was his only redeeming quality, the reason, whys and wherefores of the attraction was just not there.  It appeared as if the leather daddy was going to swallow the kid whole when he kissed him.  The supporting cast consisted of two women who were about as exciting to watch as watching grass grow and the opening with what seemed like a meth addicted hooker, was just plain bizarre. Angora Ranch, which was just ok, is leagues ahead of this followup film from the Director, Producer, Writer and Protagonist Paul Bright.

Martin,"[0, 0]","If you, like Paul Bright, are turned on by the sight of middle-aged Paul Bright strutting naked, with everything flopping free, before a boy he's just met, young enough to be his grandson... and a few minutes later the two of them making out naked (both of them, this time) in bed (obviously the strutting worked its irresistibly sexy magic - but he IS the director, after all, AND the writer), then this is the movie you've been waiting for.I've forced myself to watch Bright's first four movies because his relentless determination to make them despite huge obstacles fascinated me, but this is the last. He has no talent. A monster ego, but not one drop of talent anywhere.Low budgets have nothing to do with it. Masterpieces have been made for a fraction of what a Bright movie costs to make - Shane Carruth madePrimerfor $5000, but Carruth has talent and Bright has none.Bright's movies do nothing but aggressively and artlessly push his absurdly narcissistic self-image and his nauseating libertarian fantasies of legalized drugs and uninhibited man-boy naked LOVE triumphing over diabolical government oppression and violent religious lunatics.The fundamental requirement of ANY movie is that it be entertaining. Bright's movies obviously entertain him enormously, but they only irritate, bore and repulse me. In a DVD extra for his 2007 movieTheft(don't waste your money on it just because I put a link), Bright said anybody who writes a negative review of his movies is ""a bitter queen with an ax to grind"". I guess that's me.

1353805,A19OQ6PYJV7LN6,B003LWLG0C,Peter J. Hewson,"[0, 3]","Whilst I always expect gay indies to not meet the mainstream with production values (although this title rates well in that area) it outshines most mainstream with the idea behind it and the execution of the plot. For me, some of the best sci-fi is intellectual: Twilight Zone or Outer Limits; even some Hitchcock. This is in that genre. Very little sfx but high on suspense and chill factor.In 2029, as coastal refugees flee for higher ground, and as America is at war with Venezuela, has an extreme right female US president (I'm not sure if she's called Sarah) who is invoking civil laws to turn aid workers into soldiers (how's that for weaving three current, but disparate, situations into a believable plot?) the citizens are being tracked after being `chipped' at birth with tracking devices (originally designed for cats) that can be scanned and read from a distance by the police. Those who remove the chips (an offence) are then forced to flee to become No Papers: forever barred from society.It's from there that this excellent inter-personal story roles into place. The acting is good and the low budget works well given the benign rural setting. This is also one of the few (the only?) US movie where being gay isn't an issue and so allowing the characters to get on with their lives: being ripped up by technology and the government.Somewhere in the Bahamas there is a famous top notch Hollywood producer (possibly named Gerry) who is thinking, ""darn why didn't I think of that first"".(I hope that someone watching this movie in 2029 won't be musing on the correct predictions in this movie.

1353806,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B003LWLG0C,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[11, 15]","It's hard to do low-budget sci-fi. And when I talk low budget, I am talking about an eight day shooting schedule and very small cast (basically, five main players and a small handful of extras). Plus making a premise that doesn't collapse under its own weight. ""Altitude Falling,"" a modestly created look at the near future, pulls it off, and is director Paul Bright's best film to date.To summate, it's a decade or so into the future. There's a deep recession going on, and an inexplicable war in Venezuela. People have been implanted with tracking chips, which started out as innocent ways to identify and locate people in case of serious emergencies, like accidents or natural disasters. But now the mere act of entering a mini-market ID's you and offers you a targeted special sale item. It also means that, as the war escalates, the government can find you if they need you.The five lives interconnected here are all tied to the chips and how they evolved. Greg Forrester (Bright) has fled his old life to take residence in New Mexico, and Danny's family has come to escape their unemployed status after tidal surges have destroyed their home (the consequences of global warming are where the movie's title come from). One of the more intriguing aspects of ""Altitude Falling"" is just how easily this future could occur, without any whizz-bang gizmos or vacuously expensive ""Avatar"" effects. The fiction is subtle, but realistic. ""Altitude Falling"" is a provocative and enjoyable film.",5,Here's your future,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,1489,"['hard', 'do', 'low-budget', 'sci-fi', 'when', 'talk', 'low', 'budget', 'am', 'talking', 'eight', 'day', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'very', 'small', 'cast', 'basically', 'five', 'main', 'players', 'small', 'handful', 'extras', 'making', 'premise', ""n't"", 'collapse', 'own', 'weight', 'Altitude', 'Falling', 'modestly', 'created', 'look', 'near', 'future', 'off', 'director', 'Paul', 'Bright', 'best', 'film', 'date.To', 'summate', 'decade', 'so', 'future', 'deep', 'recession', 'going', 'inexplicable', 'war', 'Venezuela', 'People', 'have', 'been', 'implanted', 'tracking', 'chips', 'started', 'out', 'innocent', 'ways', 'identify', 'locate', 'people', 'case', 'serious', 'emergencies', 'accidents', 'natural', 'disasters', 'now', 'mere', 'act', 'entering', 'mini-market', 'ID', 'targeted', 'special', 'sale', 'item', 'also', 'that', 'war', 'government', 'can', 'find', 'need', 'you.The', 'five', 'lives', 'interconnected', 'here', 'are', 'tied', 'chips', 'how', 'evolved', 'Greg', 'Forrester', 'Bright', 'fled', 'old', 'life', 'take', 'residence', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Danny', 'family', 'come', 'escape', 'unemployed', 'status', 'tidal', 'surges', 'have', 'destroyed', 'home', 'consequences', 'global', 'warming', 'are', 'where', 'movie', 'title', 'come', 'One', 'more', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'Altitude', 'Falling', 'just', 'how', 'easily', 'future', 'could', 'occur', 'whizz-bang', 'gizmos', 'vacuously', 'expensive', 'Avatar', 'effects', 'fiction', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'Altitude', 'Falling', 'provocative', 'enjoyable', 'film']",N/A
