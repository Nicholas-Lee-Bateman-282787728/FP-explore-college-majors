There is a priceless scene in this film: Meet My Parents.  The conversation becomes impossible when the parents are IGNORANT fools and do not want to listen or understand what their son or his friend has to say.  They came in good faith, but got kicked out. From here on, the story is unwinding masterfully and emotionally.  What a great testament of time for European gay history, what a great lesson for parents!

1005927,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000GNOSCM,James Morris,"[1, 1]","I purchased the DVD of THE CONSEQUENCE (Die Konsequenz) without knowing a thing about it, and I am so very glad I did.  Although thematically very different, it reminded me of another 1970's film concerning a love affair between an older man and an underage boy.  That film was titled ABUSE; I rented it one snowy weekend several years ago and proceeded to be blown away.  Such a film is THE CONSEQUENCE, made for German television and released in 1977.THE CONSEQUENCE concerns a handsome actor named Martin (Jurgen Prochnow) who is sent to prison for seducing a minor.  During his initial processing at the jail, he is asked, ""How old was he?"" Sadly he replies, ""Fifteen.  If it had been a girl, I would only have gotten two and a half years.""  The intake guard notes that Martin has already served much of his sentence while awaiting trial and may be released early for good behavior.Shortly after his arrival, Martin is approached by a fellow prisoner, who relates that he has written a play, and asks Martin's help in staging it.  As luck would have it, to keep him out of trouble, the Warden allows his wayward, rebellious son, Thomas, to be cast in the play with the adult inmates, portraying Martin's son.  The Warden has no way of knowing that, not only is Thomas gay, he develops a strong crush on Martin and immediately falls in love.  On the closing night of the jailhouse play, Thomas finds a way to sneak into Martin's cell, and their love is consummated.  Thus begins a romantic tragedy as gripping and powerful as just about any I've ever seen.After Martin is released, Thomas and Martin approach the Warden and his wife, and declare their love for each other.  Their love is rejected by his parents, and the Warden tells Thomas to get out and never return.  They run away and set up a home together, but the Warden soon changes his mind, and has Thomas arrested and sent to a Reform School until he is twenty-one.The rest of the film details the horrendous incarceration that the Warden has mandated for Thomas, the young man's efforts to escape and return to Martin, and Martin's desperate attempts to free him.  When Thomas does emerge, finally free and of age to determine his own destiny, he is horribly scarred both physically and mentally from the cruelty that he's experienced in the Reform School.  The tragedy does not present a happy ending.Director Wolfgang Petersen (DAS BOOT, ENEMY MINE, and THE PERFECT STORM) has constructed an atmosphere of repression and cruelty that many gay men will identify with, and one that is doubtless still being played out in many parts of the world, even thirty-five years after THE CONSEQUENCE was made.  Filmed for German television and clearly intended to present a sympathetic portrait of the struggles encountered by same-sex couples, this heartbreaking story will resonate with many gay men who remember how difficult our lives could be in years past, and how difficult some would make it today.  The tender, romantic love that Martin and Thomas feel for each other is contrasted by the frustrating lack of understanding and compassion of everyone they come in contact with.  This is not a story about pedophilia.  Although no precise age is given for Thomas when he meets Martin, he appears to be about 17, which happens to be the legal age of consent in many States in the U.S.  And the film makes it clear that Thomas is already quite aware of his longings and desires when he and Martin first become acquainted.  In fact, as often happens when a young gay men falls in love with someone older, it is Thomas and not Martin who aggressively initiates their romance.THE CONSEQUENCE is a sad, beautiful film, filled with tender romantic moments and heartbreaking cruelty.  Although some of the plot was a bit of a stretch, the situations somehow felt very genuine.  And as with the previously mentioned film ABUSE, the black and white photography and grainy picture somehow added a realistic feel.  At one point in the narrative, Thomas writes to Martin in prison and tells him that he feels as though he's in prison himself - the prison of living with parents who will never understand him and being forced into a job he dislikes intensely.  The supreme irony of the story is that fact that the only happiness they seem destined for is that which they experience while Martin is in prison and Thomas, on the outside, is able to hope they can someday have a life together.  Once they think they're free, the real tragedy begins to emerge.Neither ABUSE nor THE CONSEQUENCE are easy films to watch.  They both tackle subjects which are adult and controversial, and although handled in a sympathetic and intelligent way, many audiences will be extremely disturbed by the subject matter.  But dramatically, THE CONSEQUENCE packs a powerful punch, one that easily overcomes many of the stiff, contrived circumstances proffered by some modern gay dramas.  If you like raw, hard-hitting stories, THE CONSEQUENCE just may surprise you.A word about the subtitles in this DVD: many reviewers have complained about the large, yellow-boxed English subtitles, which are easy to read but obscure the lower portion of the screen.  It must be noted that the DVD includes the original white subtitles, which are less obtrusive but more difficult to read.  As a remedy to this, I found I could easily toggle back and forth between the two by using the ""Subtitle"" button on my remote.  I watched the film with the white subtitles on and when I found them hard to read, I just switched back to the large subtitles momentarily.  Yes, it was a bit of an effort, but surprisingly, it did not really detract from my enjoyment of the film - I felt that THE CONSEQUENCE was that good.THE CONSEQUENCE is highly recommended.",5,"A TEN

1005928,AOZYVT9NH7CMC,B000GNOSCM,"Mutaya ""Dawas""","[7, 7]","Wolfgang Petersen's The Consequence is a wonderful reminder of what great film making is all about.  Petersen did not need a huge budget, overpowering soundtrack and special effects to tell a compelling and heartfelt story about two doomed lovers.  Instead he was able to concentrate on filming a convincing story while eliciting two subtle yet powerful performances from his lead actors.  This is not just a gay interest film; the themes of loneliness, persecution and love are universal and the result is a film that resonates long after viewing.Thank goodness The Consequence has been preserved on DVD.

It's a story about difficult love relationship and hostile attitude towards gays in Switzerland (which looks here like one of the countries in eastern Europe).Martin is imprisoned because of having a sexual relationship with a young teenager and Thomas is a son of a prison warden. They decide to be together and it causes the title consequence. However, the title can also refers to the decision taken by the court later on (Thomas must spend some time in a centre for juveniles and it has a lot of consequences for his life).Aformentioned lack of colors on the screen intesifies the pessimistic feeling of this flick.
