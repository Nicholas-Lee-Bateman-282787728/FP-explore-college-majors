1405027,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B004FJ87EI,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[7, 12]","I really liked the character of Sharpay from theHigh School Musicalfranchise; she was the perfect antidote to the almost too-perfect Troy (Zac Efron) & Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens). Breaking a comic villainess out on her own can be risky unless you have the perfect script and balance. Ashley Tisdale does her best, but there is only so much she can do with what she has been given here. She is more than capable of being the lead in a feature, but unfortunately, Disney has done her a disservice with (what appears to be) a quickly slapped together production. The predictability of the plot doesn't bother me (think ""All About Eve"" meets ""Legally Blonde""); what does bother me is how poorly it's done (think ""Legally Blonde 2"").The plot has Sharpay being presented with an opportunity to star in a Broadway play; against her father's better judgment (he feels she isn't capable enough for something so big), she seizes the moment and goes anyway, promising to return if she doesn't become a success in 30 days. Trouble begins when she's thrown out of the penthouse apartment that daddy arranged for her (no dogs allowed!) and only gets worse when she discovers that the Broadway play was only interested in her dog, Boi. But wait...there's more. Boi has competition; a snooty little rich boy, Roger Elliston (Bradley Steven Perry) has a female dog, Countess, that they are interested in as well. And let's not forget the star of the show: Amber Adams (Cameron Goodman), a two-faced nasty diva who turns Sharpay into her personal toilet-bowl scrubbing assistant, giving Sharpay false hope that Boi might be picked over Countess. Helping her make lemonade out of these lemons is Peyton Leverett (Austin Butler), a handsome young man whose parents are friends with Sharpay's family. He just happens to know of an available studio apartment in his building AND just happens to be the perfect cheerleader who falls head over heels for Sharpay. Will Boi get chosen? Will Sharpay get her dream within 30 days? Can Sharpay put aside her ambitions and snobbery and find love with Austin? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.On the plus side: Ashley Tisdale is endearing in what could easily be a thoroughly unlikeable characer in the wrong hands. I also like the chemistry between her and Austin Butler; they balance each other very well. The rivalry between Sharpay and Roger is enjoyable, but really could have been developed a little more to better comic effect. It also appears that much of this movie was actually shot in New York City, giving it more of an authentic flavor.I would recommend this one for the younger set; it is definitely family friendly and even though set in NYC, it doesn't really show the dark side of the city.In the extras department, there are a few:1. The Evolution of Sharpay: Tisdale hosts this look back at the development and maturity of her character, with clips from the ""High School Musical"" franchise. Interesting to see her through the years.2. Bloopers: very short; fun...but short.3. Austin Cam: During the movie, Austin's character (a film student) shoots Sharpay with his video camera. This featurette shows some of the behind-the-scenes footage that was captured as well as what Austin had to go through while shooting the faux footage of Sharpay. This is probably the most enjoyable feature.OVERALL: it's fun, even though I was disappointed that they didn't give the character of Sharpay a better movie.",2,Semi-Fabulous Is More Accurate,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,3448,"['really', 'liked', 'character', 'Sharpay', 'theHigh', 'School', 'Musicalfranchise', 'was', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'almost', 'too-perfect', 'Troy', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Gabriella', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Breaking', 'comic', 'villainess', 'own', 'can', 'be', 'risky', 'have', 'perfect', 'script', 'balance', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'best', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'been', 'given', 'here', 'more', 'capable', 'being', 'lead', 'feature', 'unfortunately', 'Disney', 'done', 'disservice', 'what', 'be', 'quickly', 'slapped', 'together', 'production', 'predictability', 'plot', ""n't"", 'bother', 'think', 'Eve', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'what', 'bother', 'how', 'poorly', 'done', 'think', 'Legally', 'Blonde', '2', '.The', 'plot', 'Sharpay', 'being', 'presented', 'opportunity', 'star', 'Broadway', 'play', 'father', 'better', 'judgment', ""n't"", 'capable', 'enough', 'something', 'so', 'big', 'moment', 'anyway', 'promising', 'return', ""n't"", 'become', 'success', '30', 'days', 'Trouble', 'begins', 'when', 'thrown', 'penthouse', 'apartment', 'arranged', 'dogs', 'allowed', 'only', 'worse', 'when', 'Broadway', 'play', 'was', 'only', 'interested', 'dog', 'Boi', 'wait', 'more', 'Boi', 'competition', 'snooty', 'little', 'rich', 'boy', 'Roger', 'Elliston', 'Bradley', 'Steven', 'Perry', 'female', 'dog', 'Countess', 'are', 'interested', 'as', 'well', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'star', 'show', 'Amber', 'Adams', 'Cameron', 'Goodman', 'two-faced', 'nasty', 'diva', 'who', 'Sharpay', 'personal', 'toilet-bowl', 'scrubbing', 'assistant', 'giving', 'Sharpay', 'false', 'hope', 'Boi', 'might', 'be', 'picked', 'Countess', 'Helping', 'make', 'lemonade', 'lemons', 'Peyton', 'Leverett', 'Austin', 'Butler', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'parents', 'are', 'friends', 'Sharpay', 'family', 'just', 'know', 'available', 'studio', 'apartment', 'building', 'just', 'happens', 'be', 'perfect', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'head', 'heels', 'Sharpay', 'Will', 'Boi', 'get', 'chosen', 'Will', 'Sharpay', 'get', 'dream', '30', 'days', 'Can', 'Sharpay', 'put', 'aside', 'ambitions', 'snobbery', 'find', 'love', 'Austin', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'endearing', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'unlikeable', 'characer', 'wrong', 'hands', 'also', 'chemistry', 'Austin', 'Butler', 'balance', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'rivalry', 'Sharpay', 'Roger', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'little', 'more', 'better', 'comic', 'effect', 'also', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'giving', 'more', 'authentic', 'flavor.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'younger', 'set', 'definitely', 'family', 'friendly', 'even', 'set', 'NYC', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'dark', 'side', 'city.In', 'extras', 'department', 'are', 'few:1', 'Evolution', 'Sharpay', 'Tisdale', 'hosts', 'look', 'back', 'development', 'maturity', 'character', 'clips', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'franchise', 'Interesting', 'see', 'years.2', 'Bloopers', 'very', 'short', 'fun', 'short.3', 'Austin', 'Cam', 'movie', 'Austin', 'character', 'film', 'student', 'shoots', 'Sharpay', 'video', 'camera', 'featurette', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'was', 'captured', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'Austin', 'had', 'go', 'shooting', 'faux', 'footage', 'Sharpay', 'probably', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'feature.OVERALL', 'fun', 'even', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'character', 'Sharpay', 'better', 'movie']",N/A

1405031,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B004FJ87EI,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[0, 2]","Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure, if anything else, is one of the most quotable films of year. For instance...Sharpay's father, greeting his daughter after the pop performance that opens the film: ""Princess, you had better look out for law enforcement. They are gonna come after you for stealing the show!""Sharpay herself, when persuading her father to give his blessing to seek fame on Broadway: ""Daddy, the main reason I buy such expensive shoes is to take monumental steps!""This made-for-Disney-Channel-but-first-released-to-Blu-ray-and-DVD movie is a spinoff of the High School Musical series. Sharpay Evans, campus queen bee and wealthy, pampered but lovable self-caricature, decides that she can conquer Broadway with minimal effort, but learns the value of hard work, good friends and consideration for others. Kind of a kid-friendly version of Legally Blonde, right down to the designer doggie.Her catalyst for this growth is smiling dagger-plunger stage star Amber Lee Adams (Cameron Goodman, playing it to the hilt in a film with a very, very high hilt), who calls our heroine ""Sharpie"" and basically tricks her into becoming her lapdog assistant. At one point, Sharpay even cleans a toilet! Omigosh!Amber Lee's character is the bad example of what Sharpay might become. But she's saved by the nicest young cute guy in New York City, Donald Hollinger (oh, sorry--wrong decade--that was Ann Marie's boyfriend).As budding filmmaker Peyton Everett, young actor Austin Butler gets some of the best lines in the movie. But unfortunately, since he's supposed to be the voice of reason and moral center, these lines make his character is a bit inconsistent and unintentionally funny.One minute he says to Sharpay, ""Everything you have to do will be worth it to have your dream,"" (the exact opposite of the film's message).Later he says, with gravitas, ""You've sold your soul just to get Boi in that show rather than trust in the dog that you raised. Even worse you've stopped trusting that your own talents would get you where you need to go!""It's priceless stuff, but probably not as sidesplittingly funny as intended, though the production tries valiantly to balance camp with heart (a very difficult task).Here's another gem: upon making a dramatic exit, Peyton exclaims, ""One question--what happened to that hot pink whirlwind of confidence and ambition I saw through my lens that first day you got here? I mean, that girl knew she was special! That girl knew that she didn't have to do any of this to succeed! What happened to her, huh?""Quite a few of the clever lines are appropriately assigned...Sharpay: ""Listen, Amber Lee Adams isn't what you think.""Roger (Bradley Steven Perry): ""A self absorbed, two-faced panther who would eat her young live on a reality show rather than allow anyone to steal her spotlight?""Sharpay: ""Okay, she's what you think.""But ultimately, Peyton wins the match with this line he says--again in all seriousness--to Sharpay: ""There is not a marquee big enough, or lights bright enough, to contain the fame you're gonna have."" You could just hear Dick Powell say this to Ruby Keeler in a Goldiggers movie. Which in this context, is probably fine and in keeping with the jaunty spirit of Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure.Production wise, the film is nicely shot and directed with skill by Michael Lembeck (director of Disney's Santa Clauses 2 & 3 and former leader of Kaptain Kool and the Kongs on TV's Krofft Supershow) and the city looks like the wonderland of That Girl.The Blu-Ray and DVD is sparse on bonus features, consisting mainly of a short doc about Sharpay's ""evolution,"" bloopers and footage from the camera Butler used throughout the film.",4,That Legally Blonde Sharpay Girl!,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,3680,"['Sharpay', 'Fabulous', 'Adventure', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'most', 'quotable', 'films', 'year', 'instance', 'Sharpay', 'father', 'greeting', 'daughter', 'pop', 'performance', 'film', 'Princess', 'had', 'better', 'look', 'out', 'law', 'enforcement', 'are', 'gon', 'come', 'stealing', 'show', 'Sharpay', 'when', 'persuading', 'father', 'give', 'blessing', 'seek', 'fame', 'Broadway', 'Daddy', 'main', 'reason', 'buy', 'such', 'expensive', 'shoes', 'take', 'monumental', 'steps', 'made-for-Disney-Channel-but-first-released-to-Blu-ray-and-DVD', 'movie', 'spinoff', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'series', 'Sharpay', 'Evans', 'campus', 'queen', 'bee', 'wealthy', 'pampered', 'lovable', 'self-caricature', 'can', 'conquer', 'Broadway', 'minimal', 'effort', 'value', 'hard', 'work', 'good', 'friends', 'consideration', 'others', 'Kind', 'kid-friendly', 'version', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'right', 'down', 'designer', 'catalyst', 'growth', 'smiling', 'dagger-plunger', 'stage', 'star', 'Amber', 'Lee', 'Adams', 'Cameron', 'Goodman', 'playing', 'hilt', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'high', 'hilt', 'who', 'heroine', 'Sharpie', 'basically', 'tricks', 'becoming', 'lapdog', 'assistant', 'one', 'point', 'Sharpay', 'even', 'toilet', 'Omigosh', 'Amber', 'Lee', 'character', 'bad', 'example', 'what', 'Sharpay', 'might', 'become', 'saved', 'nicest', 'young', 'cute', 'guy', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Donald', 'Hollinger', 'oh', 'sorry', 'wrong', 'decade', 'was', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'boyfriend', 'budding', 'filmmaker', 'Peyton', 'Everett', 'young', 'actor', 'Austin', 'Butler', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'supposed', 'be', 'voice', 'reason', 'moral', 'center', 'lines', 'make', 'character', 'bit', 'inconsistent', 'unintentionally', 'funny.One', 'minute', 'Sharpay', 'Everything', 'have', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'have', 'dream', 'exact', 'opposite', 'film', 'message', '.Later', 'gravitas', ""'ve"", 'sold', 'soul', 'just', 'get', 'Boi', 'show', 'rather', 'trust', 'dog', 'raised', 'Even', 'worse', ""'ve"", 'stopped', 'trusting', 'own', 'talents', 'would', 'get', 'where', 'need', 'go', 'priceless', 'stuff', 'probably', 'not', 'sidesplittingly', 'funny', 'intended', 'production', 'valiantly', 'balance', 'camp', 'heart', 'very', 'difficult', 'task', 'gem', 'making', 'dramatic', 'exit', 'Peyton', 'One', 'question', 'what', 'happened', 'hot', 'pink', 'confidence', 'ambition', 'saw', 'lens', 'first', 'day', 'got', 'here', 'mean', 'girl', 'knew', 'was', 'special', 'girl', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'succeed', 'What', 'happened', 'huh', 'Quite', 'few', 'clever', 'lines', 'are', 'appropriately', 'assigned', 'Sharpay', 'Listen', 'Amber', 'Lee', 'Adams', ""n't"", 'what', 'think', 'Roger', 'Bradley', 'Steven', 'Perry', 'self', 'absorbed', 'two-faced', 'panther', 'who', 'would', 'eat', 'young', 'live', 'reality', 'show', 'rather', 'allow', 'anyone', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'Sharpay', 'Okay', 'what', 'think', 'ultimately', 'Peyton', 'match', 'line', 'again', 'seriousness', 'Sharpay', 'not', 'marquee', 'big', 'enough', 'lights', 'bright', 'enough', 'contain', 'fame', ""'re"", 'gon', 'have', 'could', 'just', 'hear', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'say', 'Ruby', 'Keeler', 'Goldiggers', 'movie', 'Which', 'context', 'probably', 'fine', 'keeping', 'jaunty', 'spirit', 'Sharpay', 'Fabulous', 'Adventure.Production', 'wise', 'film', 'nicely', 'shot', 'directed', 'skill', 'Michael', 'Lembeck', 'director', 'Disney', 'Santa', 'Clauses', '2', '3', 'former', 'leader', 'Kaptain', 'Kool', 'Kongs', 'TV', 'Krofft', 'Supershow', 'city', 'wonderland', 'Girl.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'sparse', 'bonus', 'features', 'consisting', 'mainly', 'short', 'doc', 'Sharpay', 'evolution', 'bloopers', 'footage', 'camera', 'Butler', 'used', 'film']",N/A
