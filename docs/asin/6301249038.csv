248280,A1EHD9FFW3274W,6301249038,copy_1@hotmail.com,"[2, 3]","46. PARENTS (comedy, 1988) Ever since their move to a new town 10-year old Michael has been feeling strange. Maybe its because his new house seems so big and spooky. Or maybe its because Dad (Dennis Quaid) and his Mom (Mary  Beth Hurt) practically force him to eat their favorite recipe they call  &quot;leftovers&quot; (a combination of meats and stuff). Whatever the case  he has grown very suspicions of anything and everyone. His growing  anxieties instill in him a wicked outlook towards life that gets him in  trouble at school. Sent to the school's counselor for help, she sets out to  investigate Michael's private home life.Critique: Strange little film is  the blackest of comedies. The story is told from Michael's POV so  everything looks abstract and weird. Attention to detail of setting (50s  Americana), period pieces and customs is very rewarding. Bob Balaban's  craftily directed 'Pax Americana' scenes seem aesthetic and distant.  Similarities between David Lynch's own subversive 'Twin Peaks' society of  evil lurking underneath wholesome settings, seem to have had an influence  on Balaban (Lynch's own regular composer, Angelo Bandalamenti, provides the  music). The film also benefits from the stylistic brushes of  cinematographer-turned-director Barry Sonenfeld. The use of sweeping,  low-angle shots (illustrating this 'child's nightmare world) and use of  hand-held shots are wonderful. The cult overtones of the film make it not  for all tastes.QUOTE: Michael: &quot;Well, what were they before they  were leftovers?&quot;  Dad: &quot;Leftovers to be.&quot;",3,CULT MOVIES 46,917913600,"02 2, 1999",1999,1585,"['46', 'PARENTS', 'comedy', '1988', 'Ever', 'move', 'new', 'town', '10-year', 'old', 'Michael', 'been', 'feeling', 'strange', 'Maybe', 'new', 'house', 'so', 'big', 'spooky', 'maybe', 'Dad', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Mom', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'practically', 'force', 'eat', 'favorite', 'recipe', 'call', 'quot', 'leftovers', 'quot', 'combination', 'meats', 'stuff', 'case', 'grown', 'very', 'suspicions', 'anything', 'everyone', 'growing', 'anxieties', 'instill', 'wicked', 'outlook', 'towards', 'life', 'trouble', 'school', 'Sent', 'school', 'counselor', 'help', 'out', 'investigate', 'Michael', 'private', 'home', 'life.Critique', 'Strange', 'little', 'film', 'blackest', 'comedies', 'story', 'told', 'Michael', 'POV', 'so', 'everything', 'abstract', 'weird', 'Attention', 'detail', 'setting', '50s', 'Americana', 'period', 'pieces', 'customs', 'very', 'rewarding', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'craftily', 'directed', ""'Pax"", 'Americana', 'scenes', 'seem', 'aesthetic', 'distant', 'Similarities', 'David', 'Lynch', 'own', 'subversive', 'Peaks', 'society', 'evil', 'lurking', 'underneath', 'wholesome', 'settings', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'influence', 'Balaban', 'Lynch', 'own', 'regular', 'composer', 'Angelo', 'Bandalamenti', 'music', 'film', 'also', 'benefits', 'stylistic', 'brushes', 'cinematographer-turned-director', 'Barry', 'Sonenfeld', 'use', 'sweeping', 'low-angle', 'shots', 'illustrating', ""'child"", 'nightmare', 'world', 'use', 'hand-held', 'shots', 'are', 'wonderful', 'cult', 'overtones', 'film', 'make', 'not', 'tastes.QUOTE', 'Michael', 'quot', 'Well', 'what', 'were', 'were', 'leftovers', 'quot', 'Dad', 'quot', 'Leftovers', 'be.', 'quot']",Parents VHS

People have called it artistic because it has an ethereal dream-like quality to it.  I think it's fine to have dream sequences, but to have absolutely nothing happen for 1.5 hours into the movie is unacceptable.  The child's acting (if you can call it acting) was awful.  It was as if his face had been injected with massive amounts of botox.  no expressions.  no emotion.The storyline was predictible with little to offer in the way of ingenuity or thrill factor.  The scariest part of the movie might have been when the child turned around and ran into a foot hanging on a meat hook in the cellar.  Even then, his face (weighed down by the botox) registered nothing.  The father's death scene in the end lasted about 10 minutes of him flopping about trying to lay his hands on the child.And having his grandparents lay a meat sandwich on his nighttable in the end was the straw that broke the camel's back.Do not rent this movie.

He was shown to be obsessed with his job, so this makes sense to me -- and would also explain why he doesn't want his son in the cellar, to find out his secret, that he's been illegally bringing corpses home to experiment upon.Furthermore, when the school psychologist is killed, they don't show who did it.

Bob Balaban's cold, minimalistic style was just the touch this film needed.  What could have been slapstick horror comedy (a la Dead-Alive or Evil Dead  2, both of which are great; that style just wouldn't work as well for this  film) instead becomes a superbly filmed satire of 1950s family culture.I  never thought I could actually be afraid of Randy Quaid, but his  performance is truly blood-curdling.  (Strangely enough, due to the facial  expressions he makes throughout the movie, this is the first time I've ever  noticed a resemblance between him and his brother Dennis.)  He plays the  character with a understatement I didn't realize he was capable of.I  understand why some critics came down on the climax and resolution of the  film, feeling it much too conventional in light of what had preceded it,  but I feel that there weren't too many more possibilities they could have  utilized.

248291,A3OUKV8KBGUPS4,6301249038,M. Casarino,"[9, 12]","&quot;Parents&quot; is a really odd blend of your basic &quot;something's rotten in suburbia&quot; movie, a genuine horror flick, a lovingly created period piece, and...something else. Something even more disturbing than the movie's pretense.The plot is fairly simple: poor Michael becomes convinced that his parents, who are paragons of suburbia, are cannibals. Are they? Really? The movie is told from Michael's point of view, and it sure looks like they are from here. The premise, and some of the touches, really have the feel of dark satire, and in fact I see &quot;Parents&quot; gets billed as a black comedy.But look deeper in Michael's eyes, and it looks like something darker than comedy is going on here. It's not much of a stretch to interpret &quot;cannibalism&quot; as &quot;child abuse&quot; - look at how badly Michael is affected by his discoveries. The actual theme is broader, I think - essentially, the movie argues that the surface of suburbia can mask some really horrible things. Which isn't a particularly new notion, but it's worth pointing out sometimes.I can't say I enjoyed &quot;Parents,&quot; but it's extremely well-made and acted. I love the period look, and the shots of meat are appropriately disgusting. Maybe it's a comedy, but I didn't laugh once - instead, I shrunk in both the exaggerated horror of Michael's nightmares, the campy horror of his perception, and the genuine horror of his reality.",4,Something's rotten in the basement of suburbia...,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,1433,"['quot', 'Parents', 'quot', 'really', 'odd', 'blend', 'basic', 'quot', 'something', 'rotten', 'suburbia', 'quot', 'movie', 'genuine', 'horror', 'flick', 'lovingly', 'created', 'period', 'piece', 'something', 'else', 'Something', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'pretense.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'poor', 'Michael', 'convinced', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'paragons', 'suburbia', 'are', 'cannibals', 'Are', 'Really', 'movie', 'told', 'Michael', 'point', 'view', 'sure', 'are', 'here', 'premise', 'touches', 'really', 'have', 'feel', 'dark', 'satire', 'fact', 'see', 'quot', 'Parents', 'quot', 'billed', 'black', 'comedy.But', 'look', 'deeper', 'Michael', 'eyes', 'something', 'darker', 'comedy', 'going', 'here', 'not', 'much', 'stretch', 'interpret', 'quot', 'cannibalism', 'quot', 'quot', 'child', 'abuse', 'quot', 'look', 'how', 'badly', 'Michael', 'affected', 'discoveries', 'actual', 'theme', 'broader', 'think', 'essentially', 'movie', 'surface', 'suburbia', 'can', 'mask', 'really', 'horrible', 'things', 'Which', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'new', 'notion', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'sometimes.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Parents', 'quot', 'extremely', 'well-made', 'acted', 'love', 'period', 'look', 'shots', 'meat', 'are', 'appropriately', 'disgusting', 'Maybe', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'once', 'instead', 'shrunk', 'exaggerated', 'horror', 'Michael', 'nightmares', 'campy', 'horror', 'perception', 'genuine', 'horror', 'reality']",Parents VHS
248292,A20NJAPECFGIR9,6301249038,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 2]",This movie was just too boring for me to enjoy. I decided to give it a look since it was on Fearnet on Xfinity On Demand but I just couldn't take it. It drags on and on and its attempt to be humorous amid the horror just comes off as silly. Everything moves just way too slow and nothing really happens.Maybe it's unfair for me to review the movie without finishing it but I saw about an hour of it and dozed off several times. I gave up from that point on.I can't say whether you should try it or not. People are different and others might like it but it was like watching paint dry to me. I was a kid in '89 when this came out and I never heard of the movie until now.

248294,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301249038,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 13]","Parents (Bob Balaban, 1989)TV director Balaban makes his feature debut with this little comedy about which I can't quite figure out what to say. I know I was unimpressed with it; I simply can't figure out why.The story concerns Michael (Bryan Madorsky, in his only screen role), a schoolboy who comes to believe that his parents Nick (Brokeback Mountain's Randy Quaid) and Lily (The Exorcism of Emily Rose's Mary Beth Hurt) are cannibals. This, obviously, messes with his head, which puts him on contact with school counselor Millie Dew (A Hatful of Rain's Sandy Dennis, in one of her final screen appearances). Is it all in his head, or are his parents really cannibals?There is nothing terribly wrong with this film, per se; the acting is competent if nothing special, the script is predictable but decent, and at times amusing, the direction is solid without being notable, etc. It's average to the point of being innocuous-- which is a problem in a film about a kid who thinks his parents may be trying to feed him parts of other human beings.And you know, for some reason, I just fgured out what's been nagging me this whole time. So how did it take this kid until he was ten, or thereabouts (I don't remember his age ever being specified), to start wondering what it is he's eating? And why does he stop? It makes no sense-- and as it's the basis of the movie, it undermines everything else. **",2,"Silliness that could have been, but was not, inspired.",1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,1400,"['Parents', 'Bob', 'Balaban', '1989', 'TV', 'director', 'Balaban', 'feature', 'debut', 'little', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'say', 'know', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Michael', 'Bryan', 'Madorsky', 'only', 'screen', 'role', 'schoolboy', 'who', 'believe', 'parents', 'Nick', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Lily', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'Hurt', 'are', 'cannibals', 'obviously', 'messes', 'head', 'contact', 'school', 'counselor', 'Millie', 'Dew', 'Hatful', 'Rain', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'one', 'final', 'screen', 'appearances', 'head', 'are', 'parents', 'really', 'cannibals', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'film', 'se', 'acting', 'competent', 'nothing', 'special', 'script', 'predictable', 'decent', 'times', 'amusing', 'direction', 'solid', 'being', 'notable', 'etc', 'average', 'point', 'being', 'innocuous', 'problem', 'film', 'kid', 'who', 'parents', 'may', 'be', 'trying', 'feed', 'parts', 'other', 'human', 'beings.And', 'know', 'reason', 'just', 'fgured', 'out', 'what', 'been', 'nagging', 'whole', 'time', 'how', 'did', 'take', 'kid', 'was', 'ten', 'thereabouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'age', 'ever', 'being', 'specified', 'start', 'wondering', 'what', 'eating', 'why', 'stop', 'sense', 'basis', 'movie', 'everything', 'else', '**']",Parents VHS

Yikes, his parents are cannibals!I feel I made a good synopsis on this film. That is the trick people will do, to get people to watch their films. Obviously I made the wrong choice on agreeing to rent this. This film was so boring. I can't believe anyone else liked it. I just can't believe I'm the only one who couldn't stand it.The only good part is the ending. Throughout the movie I was thinking about how stupid I was for renting this. It was too weird and stupid to take seriously. I would assume only a younger child would like this because of how bizarre it is.Do yourself a favor and rent this on a two-for-one night. I know that I'll never rent this movie again. Even if my life depends on it. It's too much torture sitting there for half an hour watching a movie like PARENTS.
