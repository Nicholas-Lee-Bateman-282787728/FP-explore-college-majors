Reagan Gomez-Preston really did it for me because I think she is so beautiful!  If she wasn't in it I think I would have given this movie 3 stars LOL.  I think Regan really shined in this movie. Trois the Escort could have been more sexual.  It seemed they held back on the love making in this movie for some reason.  Trois 1 and 2 definitely was more romantically entertaining.  One thing I can say about the Trois series is they always have some very attractive actors and actresses in their movies and that helps allot!  I love the way they carry over actors/ actresses from one movie to the other very nice creative move.  I really hope they come out with a Trois 4!!!!!,5,Good Movie,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,791,"['own', 'entire', 'Trois', 'collection', 'must', 'say', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'compare', 'other', 'two', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'Reagan', 'Gomez-Preston', 'really', 'did', 'think', 'so', 'beautiful', 'was', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'LOL', 'think', 'Regan', 'really', 'shined', 'movie', 'Trois', 'Escort', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'sexual', 'seemed', 'held', 'back', 'love', 'making', 'movie', 'reason', 'Trois', '1', '2', 'definitely', 'was', 'more', 'romantically', 'entertaining', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Trois', 'series', 'always', 'have', 'very', 'attractive', 'actors', 'actresses', 'movies', 'allot', 'love', 'way', 'carry', 'actors/', 'actresses', 'one', 'movie', 'other', 'very', 'nice', 'creative', 'move', 'really', 'hope', 'come', 'out', 'Trois', '4']",N/A

Those 3 actors save a pretty weak story and one of the worst endings I've ever seen.
