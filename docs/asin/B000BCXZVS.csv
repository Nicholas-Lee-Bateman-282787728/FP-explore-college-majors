940565,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B000BCXZVS,Addicted2Amazon!,"[0, 0]","I purchased this program after retiring my previous cardio DVDs (""Denise Austin's Bootcamp"" and ""10 Minute Solution's Fat Blasting Dance Mix"", both of which are great workouts, by the way...however, a few months of intense usage is enough!).  I had also previously purchased Shape's ""Shape Your Abs"" workout, which contains a very good 35-min. cardio/toning interval workout.  Based on the fun and effectiveness of THAT DVD, I thought that this had to be good, despite the bad reviews, especially since it included a 17-minute yoga toning workout.  What a mistake!I have to say that the IDEA was good: that of five 10-minute cardio workouts - with a seperate warmup and cooldown - that can be mixed and matched according to your mood and time.  Unfortunately, the quality of the workouts is what causes this DVD to falter.All 5 workouts are dance-based, and are led interchangeably by Lisa Wheeler and Michelle Dozois (two of the most talented forces in the fitness industry today; Lisa is a top choreographer of at-home workouts and Michelle has appeared as lead instructor in quite a few titles).Now, I love dance fitness.  I own many such DVDs.  However, these, though they will achieve their goal of burning calories, are lackluster, more than a little corny...and just not cool to have anyone see you doing! The music is also pretty bad. Many complain about the difficulty of the moves.  I did not find them any more difficult than any other dance-based workout. In my opinion, if any dance fitness DVD is worth doing, it SHOULD be challenging and should take a few tries until you've got it down enough to really let go and have fun with it. That's the challenge!That being said, I believe that the DVD would have benefited tremendously by varying the type of cardio.  For example: one, maybe two dance-y workouts, one athletic drill, one cardio/sculpt interval, etc.  That way, they would not alienate people who enjoy or desire cardio, but hate to dance. (Or people like me, who enjoy cardio, enjoy dance, but think these dance moves are WHACK! :-) Doing that could have saved this DVD.And then there is the background...I'm sorry, but I thought having a dull, ugly living room (with easy chairs!) was the most unimaginative thing...I like a LITTLE escapism, please.The ""Long and Lean"" bonus yoga workout, however, is quite good, though a little lacking in the abs department (despite what is said, you're not going to get lean abs from that one exercise, done so briefly).Well, again, the ""Shape Your Abs"" DVD is good, as is the ""Shape Bikini Body Camp Transforming"" workout.  So it's looking like one dud out of an otherwise solid series.There are better cardio workouts out there.Not recommended...unless you like corny dance moves.",2,When Great Ideas Go BAD... : - (,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,2743,"['purchased', 'program', 'retiring', 'previous', 'cardio', 'DVDs', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Bootcamp', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'Fat', 'Blasting', 'Dance', 'Mix', 'are', 'great', 'workouts', 'way', 'however', 'few', 'months', 'intense', 'usage', 'enough', 'had', 'also', 'previously', 'purchased', 'Shape', 'Shape', 'Abs', 'workout', 'very', 'good', '35-min', 'cardio/toning', 'interval', 'workout', 'Based', 'fun', 'effectiveness', 'THAT', 'DVD', 'thought', 'had', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'reviews', 'especially', 'included', '17-minute', 'yoga', 'toning', 'workout', 'What', 'mistake', 'have', 'say', 'IDEA', 'was', 'good', 'five', '10-minute', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'seperate', 'warmup', 'cooldown', 'can', 'be', 'mixed', 'matched', 'according', 'mood', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'quality', 'workouts', 'what', 'DVD', 'falter.All', '5', 'workouts', 'are', 'dance-based', 'are', 'led', 'interchangeably', 'Lisa', 'Wheeler', 'Michelle', 'Dozois', 'two', 'most', 'talented', 'forces', 'fitness', 'industry', 'today', 'Lisa', 'top', 'choreographer', 'at-home', 'workouts', 'Michelle', 'appeared', 'lead', 'instructor', 'quite', 'few', 'titles', '.Now', 'love', 'dance', 'fitness', 'own', 'many', 'such', 'DVDs', 'However', 'will', 'achieve', 'goal', 'burning', 'calories', 'are', 'lackluster', 'more', 'little', 'corny', 'just', 'not', 'cool', 'have', 'anyone', 'see', 'doing', 'music', 'also', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Many', 'complain', 'difficulty', 'moves', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'more', 'difficult', 'other', 'dance-based', 'workout', 'opinion', 'dance', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'worth', 'doing', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'challenging', 'should', 'take', 'few', 'tries', ""'ve"", 'got', 'down', 'enough', 'really', 'let', 'go', 'have', 'fun', 'challenge', 'being', 'said', 'believe', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'tremendously', 'varying', 'type', 'cardio', 'example', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'dance-y', 'workouts', 'one', 'athletic', 'drill', 'one', 'cardio/sculpt', 'interval', 'etc', 'way', 'would', 'not', 'alienate', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'desire', 'cardio', 'hate', 'dance', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'cardio', 'enjoy', 'dance', 'think', 'dance', 'moves', 'are', 'WHACK', 'Doing', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'DVD.And', 'then', 'background', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'thought', 'having', 'dull', 'ugly', 'living', 'room', 'easy', 'chairs', 'was', 'most', 'unimaginative', 'thing', 'like', 'LITTLE', 'escapism', 'please.The', 'Long', 'Lean', 'bonus', 'yoga', 'workout', 'however', 'quite', 'good', 'little', 'lacking', 'abs', 'department', 'what', 'said', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'lean', 'abs', 'one', 'exercise', 'done', 'so', 'briefly', '.Well', 'again', 'Shape', 'Abs', 'DVD', 'good', 'Shape', 'Bikini', 'Body', 'Camp', 'Transforming', 'workout', 'looking', 'one', 'dud', 'otherwise', 'solid', 'series.There', 'are', 'better', 'cardio', 'out', 'there.Not', 'recommended', 'like', 'corny', 'dance', 'moves']",Shape Cardio Workout: Bikini Body All Year-Round

940567,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B000BCXZVS,Chandler,"[2, 2]","I picked this up for a couple bucks at TJ Maxx. That is always hit or miss because they either have DVDs that didn't sell well and went to close out, or good DVDs that are just older and not big sellers. I get my Tae Bo DVDs there and love them all, but when I find one it's always a shot in the dark since I can't read the reviews first. This shot, for me, was a miss. But it has its target audience so you may love it...I'll go over the positives and negatives for you to decide.CALORIES BURNED:I wear a bodybugg and display device in order to measure my daily caloric burn. I am also able to program it to show me exactly how many calories a specific workout burned, how many calories that workout burned per minute, and how much my calorie burn was raised after the workout (for example, with strength training which doesn't burn as many calories during the workout, but continues to burn them long afterwards.) I mention this only so you'll know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion.  This, in comparison to the rest of my fitness DVD library would be ranked as a ""gentle workout"". While it was fast based, its caloric burn was medium low.  While the exact amount of calories burned would vary per person based upon your height, weight, muscle density etc, this will still rank lower than most you'll find but that's not a bad thing if you want a more gentle workout--especially if you are recovering from a day of strength training the day before.MUSIC:Typical workout dvd music, lots of instrumental electronica but nicely planned to move to the beat of the dancer and fit with each routine.WHAT YOU GET:5 10-minute dance segments plus a warm up and cool-down and an 18 minute ""long and lean"" workout which is essentially yoga and pilates. The full running time is 80 minutes, which is a long workout for the low price.KNOW GOING IN:If you are great at choreography I think you'll love this DVD because it combines working out with dance. For me, it was frustrating. Now don't get me wrong, I workout exclusively to fitness DVDs, but usually they don't give you several steps and expect you to learn and memorize them in order, then give you some more then ask you to start from the beginning (with the other routine you just learned by memory) then add on the new steps, then teach you some more, and ask you to do them all in order from memory all together from the beginning...That isn't necessarily a bad thing. Lots of people might be able to pick up and memorize this routine. For people like me, however, I felt like I was in a bad dream where I was unexpectedly thrown on stage to replace a member of ""Dancing With the Stars"" but never allowed to see the routine I was doing beforehand. I tried. I rewound it. I worked hard at it. But choreography memorization just isn't my strong suit and I own it. My preferance is just to workout with good cueing and no step memorization to add on moves in order to create a compilation of a routine.CUEING: This varied. Some parts were good, but many were confusing. And, with the routine being confusing to me as it was, it just felt frustrating to be honest.LEVEL: As long as you can pick up the routine, you'll be able to do this regardless of muscle density or experience. So it's more about being good at the choreography than at any certain fitness level.MUSCLES WORKED: This is geared primarily to your lower body. Although you will be doing arm movements, they are not enough or of the style to tone, nor are the moves geared towards high core toning.SET: I have other Michelle Dozies DVDs and although basically every workout DVD has a similar kind of set for the most part, for some reason the company she must use for set staging makes me giggle a bit with their set. It always looks like they took a doctor's office and asked them to clear out part of the lobby in order to allow them to film a fitness video. I kid you not. It's amusing and nothing close to a gym...not that it should be a gym.  You'll see things like a bookshelf, a long thin table against the wall beside them with objects de' art like glass vases, ceramic bowls, and other things slightly dangerous for fitness but lovely for an office decoration, bookshelves, paintings on the wall, faux painted concrete floor, etc. I don't know why every video with hers is a different set but also an amusing yet sterile ""docs office"" but probably no one else but me notices anyway. I think they might be going for the look of a living room, but it doesn't make it.TEAM: You'll get your primary instructor and a fit back up team to follow as well.EQUIPMENT: None required but you'll likely want a yoga mat if you choose to do the Yoga/Pilates section. You will need a decent amount of space for all the Mambas, cha-chas, grapevines, etc. in the routines that move you in several directions both front and back as well as side-to-side. I have a workout room (it's just a cleared out bedroom  with nothing in it but my tv. some weights, a bosu, and an elliptical)  and I still used the entire room.CONCLUSION: For those who pick up quickly when someone shows them a dance routine this would be good to mix things up a bit in your workout routine. If you were on the drill team or majored in dance, you'll have fun. I do not fall, unfortunately, into either of those categories so I was rather frustrated. The calorie burn is fairly low but it could work well on days you wish for a more gentle workout. Because there is no strength training and just cardio, it would be good for a recovery day when you have sore muscles from strength training and want something gentle...but only if you are more coordinated than me.",2,"If you are great at choreography you'll get a fun but gentle workout, but this requires a bit of dance compilation moves",1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,5681,"['picked', 'up',

I consider myself an advanced beginner, and this DVD was perfect and I can see myself growing with and putting in more effort to make it even more challenging. It's not too hard but the choreography is intermediate level, so if you're not too coordinated you would have to stick with it a little bit longer to get it.  However, you will work up a sweat even as your fitness level increases.I have a dance background and she lost me for a few moves, but it was so fun that I just kept going until I got the hang of it.  None of the movements are really high impact and this is great if your knees sometimes bother you.  There is a lot of hip shaking, and you should feel free to just let loose and enjoy yourself.The instructors are really upbeat without being too over the top and give great directions.  They do not break the moves up so slowly that your heartrate goes down. The only problem I have is that there are brief stops between the various dance sections that give tips about drinking water, eating right, etc. I continue to march during this section so that my exercise is not interrupted.It is so much fun. The DVD is broken up into five ten minute sessions: dance jazz, tribal funk, dance party, latin, and dance funky. There is also a warmup and cooldown.

940573,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000BCXZVS,Little Miss Cutey,"[25, 26]","This is another good workout from the people at Shape.  It's fun and motivating and actually enjoyable (where some aren't).  It starts with a 5 minute warm-up, 55 minutes doing floor work and then a 5 minute cool down (there is also a bonus standing floor workout - about 20 minutes).  The primary workout is dance-based aerobics - ten minutes each of jazz, dance party, Latin, funky and tribal. Then there is a pilates/yoga relaxing toning workout.  Both instructors are the same as the other workout dvd's and they do great cueing again.  With this dvd you can also do the workouts in any order - I find this helps prevent the bordom that comes from repetitive workouts of the same dvd.",4,Like this one,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,688,"['good', 'workout', 'people', 'Shape', 'fun', 'motivating', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'where', 'are', ""n't"", '5', 'minute', 'warm-up', '55', 'minutes', 'doing', 'floor', 'work', 'then', '5', 'minute', 'cool', 'down', 'also', 'bonus', 'standing', 'floor', '20', 'minutes', 'primary', 'workout', 'dance-based', 'aerobics', 'ten', 'minutes', 'jazz', 'dance', 'party', 'Latin', 'funky', 'tribal', 'Then', 'pilates/yoga', 'relaxing', 'toning', 'workout', 'instructors', 'are', 'same', 'other', 'workout', 'dvd', 'do', 'great', 'cueing', 'again', 'dvd', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'workouts', 'order', 'find', 'prevent', 'bordom', 'repetitive', 'workouts', 'same', 'dvd']",Shape Cardio Workout: Bikini Body All Year-Round

And believe it or not, I have a dance backround of 20 years or so of taking classes. There are two different instructors, one is very good and explains things well, the other just kind of does the routine and you have to just mirror her without any guidence. I do like how you can pick your workout order. But this is not my most favorite video ever. It gets used maybe once a month.",3,umm..,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,520,"['received', 'video', 'friend', 'who', 'lot', 'flailed', 'around', 'idiot', 'mostly', 'ran', 'place', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'believe', 'not', 'have', 'dance', 'backround', '20', 'years', 'so', 'taking', 'classes', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'instructors', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'well', 'other', 'just', 'kind', 'routine', 'have', 'just', 'mirror', 'guidence', 'do', 'how', 'can', 'pick', 'workout', 'order', 'not', 'most', 'favorite', 'video', 'ever', 'used', 'maybe', 'once', 'month']",Shape Cardio Workout: Bikini Body All Year-Round

Like other reviewers, you really need to watch this a few times before attempting to incorporate it into your workout routine. Unfortunately I didn't do that and was really frustrated. I made it through 1 segment before I gave up and tried a different workout video. I hate it when cardio moves are so complex that you can't follow along right away. The whole point is to motivate you to sweat off those calories. I just didn't find it easy to follow or motivating.

I thought the steps were very confusing, and would take me quite a while to master. I think this workout would be fine if you really enjoy dance style aerobics, but if you are looking for more straight forward aerobics, this isn't the workout for you. I think Shape had a good idea as far as the format, set, music, and overall production quality, I just wish this would have been a non-dance style aerobics workout.
