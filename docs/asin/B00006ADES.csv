708764,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00006ADES,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","If you are new to foreign film, you might not want to give this one a try yet.  But if you a frequent view of foreign films, you must realize that this film requires patience.  You will not have it laid out, cut and dried, with simple plot and story lines.  Although it appears as if nothing is goin' on, pay attention, to interpret the film on a deeper level, steep yourself in the film, without really attempt to digest it all at once.The 1999 Iranian film is lengthy and begins slowly, confusing, and for the longest time, you might be tempted to say... what's the hecks goin' on here?  However, with gorgeous colorful and picturesque landscape is enough to captivate the viewer.  The setting is a small village in Iranian Kurdistan, where the homes are built up against a mountain, with small ladders leading to various levels of the backdrop.  Frame after frame of the colorful village and villagers were like artwork.A man, Behzad, arrives with his small film crew to record the cemetery ritual of a dying woman in the village.  The villagers do not know the reason the men are in the village, so they are pretending to be technicians.  However, the woman does not die quick as they would like to, therefore the waiting and waiting partaking in the daily nuances becomes the focus of the movie.During the stay, Behzad engages in quite a bit with the villagers, he sees a lot, experiences small things that in reality mean a lot.There is some humor here, that involves Behzad receiving his phone calls on how the progress is coming along, but reception is poor, and he travels down slopes and ladders to go down to get going up toward the cemetery, on higher ground,  to hear the call.  This happens frequently,  although amusing.Again, if you love foreign film, take your time with this one, you will get it.  Watch it only with those who appreciate the variety of good foreign film available.  If you are new to foreign film, skip it, it has a tendency to turn people off.  I give it four stars for its originality.  .......Rizzo",4,Be patient with this one!!,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,2036,"['are', 'new', 'foreign', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'yet', 'frequent', 'view', 'foreign', 'films', 'must', 'realize', 'film', 'patience', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'laid', 'out', 'cut', 'dried', 'simple', 'plot', 'story', 'lines', 'nothing', 'goin', 'pay', 'attention', 'interpret', 'film', 'deeper', 'level', 'steep', 'film', 'really', 'attempt', 'digest', 'once.The', '1999', 'Iranian', 'film', 'lengthy', 'slowly', 'confusing', 'longest', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'say', 'what', 'hecks', 'goin', 'here', 'However', 'gorgeous', 'colorful', 'picturesque', 'landscape', 'enough', 'captivate', 'viewer', 'setting', 'small', 'village', 'Iranian', 'Kurdistan', 'where', 'homes', 'are', 'built', 'up', 'mountain', 'small', 'ladders', 'leading', 'various', 'levels', 'backdrop', 'Frame', 'frame', 'colorful', 'village', 'villagers', 'were', 'artwork.A', 'man', 'Behzad', 'small', 'film', 'crew', 'record', 'cemetery', 'ritual', 'dying', 'woman', 'village', 'villagers', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'reason', 'men', 'are', 'village', 'are', 'pretending', 'be', 'technicians', 'However', 'woman', 'not', 'die', 'quick', 'would', 'like', 'therefore', 'waiting', 'waiting', 'partaking', 'daily', 'nuances', 'focus', 'movie.During', 'stay', 'Behzad', 'quite', 'bit', 'villagers', 'lot', 'small', 'things', 'reality', 'mean', 'lot.There', 'humor', 'here', 'Behzad', 'receiving', 'phone', 'how', 'progress', 'coming', 'along', 'reception', 'poor', 'down', 'slopes', 'ladders', 'go', 'down', 'get', 'going', 'up', 'cemetery', 'higher', 'ground', 'hear', 'call', 'frequently', 'amusing.Again', 'love', 'foreign', 'film', 'take', 'time', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'Watch', 'only', 'who', 'appreciate', 'variety', 'good', 'foreign', 'film', 'available', 'are', 'new', 'foreign', 'film', 'skip', 'tendency', 'turn', 'people', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'originality', '.Rizzo']",N/A
708765,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00006ADES,Alex Udvary,"[2, 4]","I have never seen the dividing lines so closely drawn as is the case with director Abbas Kiarostami. It really is a case of either you appreciate his work or you don't. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground. If you were to ask someone what they thought about Kiarostami they might say he is a boring filmmaker. He makes films that don't seem to move. They are flat and lifeless. Now on the other hand another person might say he is a filmmaker of an almost unmatched talent. He creates subtle and absorbing films that are for a selected audience. And many call him a genuis filmmaker. I feel I belong to the latter group only not a strongly. I think Kiarostami is a talented filmmaker. But, what really captures my attention when watching his movies is his style. I think he directs with a tremendous amount of style. I do also feel that his films are very subtle in their delivery. But, I've also noticed from talking to people about Kiarostami, those that don't like him or his films always say they don't understand what he's trying to do. I take a minor offense to this. Just because YOU are unable to see what Kiarostami is trying to do, I don't feel one should stop others from watching his films. I myself ALWAYS feel dumb when I watch movies by Andrei Tarkovsky. I understand his films up to a point. But, I would still say he is a talented filmmaker. A first rate storyteller.""The Wind Will Carry Us"" is a story about a film crew travelling to a small village to film the death of the oldest living person. She is at the very least 100 years old or maybe older. The crew lead by Bohzad Dourani is lead to believe to woman will die soon. In a matter of days. Well, soon, the days past, and then weeks! The woman is slowing recovering. Funny scenes take place inwhich we see Dourani become frustrated what the fact the woman is living. So then the movie is now one about life. I can't fully give you my interpretation of the message behind the movie. To do so would ruin the experience of absorbing yourself into the story and coming away with your own message as to what the film is about. But, please try to give the movie a chance. I realize many will say it's slow. Most foreign movies are considered slow when compared to American movies. ""Wild Strawberries"", ""Floating Weeds"", ""8 1\2"", ""400 Blows"", & ""My Name Is Ivan"" would also be considered slow moving stories by most American filmgoers. Just try to relax and just enjoy the simple things the movie is trying to offer. The landscape, the cinematography, and the simplicity of the story may, as corny as it may sound, reach you.If you enjoy this movie I'd suggest watching ""Taste of Cherry"". Another film by Kiarostami. Sadly my knowledge of his movies is rather weak. I've only seen these two movies but I do know where I can find ""And Life Goes On"".Bottomline: A subtle movie with a powerful moving message about life. A movie I actually like more than ""Taste of Cherry"".

708767,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00006ADES,Doug Anderson,"[22, 25]","Plot summary: Film crew travels to remote village to document a death ritual.  Once in the village, however, they find the deathly ill woman has not perished yet and so they settle in and wait. Each day they enquire about the old womans health and each day the news is different. The focus is on one member of the crew and how he slowly acclimates himself to the villagers, to nature, and to time as he waits for an event that may or may not occur.This is my second Abbas Kiorastami film.  I recently saw Close Up and after seeing this one I want to see all of his films. Kiorastami is a film maker for people who want something unique.  Hollywood is all about stating the obvious and Kiorastami is all about subtlety.  Most films work by speeding things up and meeting expectations but Kiorastami works by slowing things down and subverting expectations. In CLOSE UP an out-of-work man with a family to support pretends to be a famous director and befriends a wealthy family who believes he truly is the director.  As time passes the family begins to suspect that he may not be who he says he is.  It is an intimate study of human relationships and how relationships develop to fulfill a mutual need.  When the family finds out the man is merely an imposter they are angry at first and they take him to court but then as they listen to his reasons for pretending they forgive him and at films end we see that the friendship will resume.  It is an examination of  how relationships form and also an examination of society and how society shapes the way we relate to and see each other. THE WIND WILL CARRY US is another version of this story but instead of the poor man befriending the rich it is about a city dweller befriending village folk. The city dweller finds himself treating the villagers like an object for study because that is his training as a film maker but the villagers just quietly go about their business allowing the city dweller to do his thing.  The villagers are a community who all rely on each other and the city dweller is facinated by how the villagers take care of each other. He relies on them for all his practical needs like food and lodging but also for his social needs as well. As he tries to communicate with various villagers we can see that he is trying to make a connection with life that  has so far been denied him in the city.  The city dweller is the kind of man who quotes poetry freely but for him life is abstract whereas for the villagers life is real.  Thus his fascination with them.  For the first time in his life he finds himself looking at nature,  at life, and at people up close.Its a very long film with lots of quiet stretches but that is Kiorastami's style--instead of hurrying you along from one scene to the next he allows you to occupy each scene and feel life not in film time but in real time. Once you surrender to the style you begin to feel its magisterial effect.  CLOSE UP was kind of grainy and low budget (though still a great film) but this film is state of the art. Truly pristine cinematography. I highly recommend both films.",5,The New World and the Old,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,3097,"['Plot', 'summary', 'Film', 'crew', 'travels', 'remote', 'village', 'document', 'death', 'ritual', 'Once', 'village', 'however', 'find', 'deathly', 'ill', 'woman', 'not', 'perished', 'yet', 'so', 'settle', 'wait', 'day', 'enquire', 'old', 'womans', 'health', 'day', 'news', 'different', 'focus', 'one', 'member', 'crew', 'how', 'slowly', 'villagers', 'nature', 'time', 'event', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'occur.This', 'second', 'Abbas', 'Kiorastami', 'film', 'recently', 'saw', 'Close', 'Up', 'seeing', 'one', 'want', 'see', 'films', 'Kiorastami', 'film', 'maker', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'something', 'unique', 'Hollywood', 'stating', 'obvious', 'Kiorastami', 'subtlety', 'Most', 'films', 'work', 'speeding', 'things', 'up', 'meeting', 'expectations', 'Kiorastami', 'works', 'slowing', 'things', 'down', 'subverting', 'expectations', 'CLOSE', 'UP', 'out-of-work', 'man', 'family', 'support', 'pretends', 'be', 'famous', 'director', 'wealthy', 'family', 'who', 'truly', 'director', 'time', 'family', 'suspect', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'who', 'intimate', 'study', 'human', 'relationships', 'how', 'relationships', 'develop', 'fulfill', 'mutual', 'need', 'When', 'family', 'out', 'man', 'merely', 'imposter', 'are', 'angry', 'first', 'take', 'court', 'then', 'listen', 'reasons', 'pretending', 'forgive', 'films', 'end', 'see', 'friendship', 'will', 'resume', 'examination', 'how', 'relationships', 'form', 'also', 'examination', 'society', 'how', 'society', 'way', 'relate', 'see', 'other', 'WIND', 'WILL', 'CARRY', 'US', 'version', 'story', 'instead', 'poor', 'man', 'befriending', 'rich', 'city', 'dweller', 'befriending', 'village', 'folk', 'city', 'dweller', 'treating', 'villagers', 'object', 'study', 'training', 'film', 'maker', 'villagers', 'just', 'quietly', 'go', 'business', 'allowing', 'city', 'dweller', 'do', 'thing', 'villagers', 'are', 'community', 'who', 'rely', 'other', 'city', 'dweller', 'facinated', 'how', 'villagers', 'take', 'care', 'other', 'practical', 'needs', 'food', 'lodging', 'also', 'social', 'needs', 'well', 'communicate', 'various', 'villagers', 'can', 'see', 'trying', 'make', 'connection', 'life', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'denied', 'city', 'city', 'dweller', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'poetry', 'freely', 'life', 'abstract', 'whereas', 'villagers', 'life', 'real', 'Thus', 'fascination', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'looking', 'nature', 'life', 'people', 'up', 'close.Its', 'very', 'long', 'film', 'lots', 'quiet', 'stretches', 'Kiorastami', 'style', 'instead', 'hurrying', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'occupy', 'scene', 'feel', 'life', 'not', 'film', 'time', 'real', 'time', 'Once', 'surrender', 'style', 'begin', 'feel', 'magisterial', 'effect', 'CLOSE', 'UP', 'was', 'kind', 'grainy', 'low', 'budget', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'state', 'art', 'Truly', 'pristine', 'cinematography', 'highly', 'recommend', 'films']",N/A

While there, all they can do is wait for an old lady to die and to hope that it would happen sooner than later. The lady does not seem to hurry to meet her Creator.  Nothing much happens with the exception of waiting and repetitions of the same conversations on the cell phone with the constant interruption of calls but the honest and poetic celebration of the world around us shines through every frame of this ode to joy of life.

708769,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00006ADES,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[21, 27]","This film is called BAD MA RA KHAHAD BORD in Iran. Abbas Kiarostami is the director, writer, producer, and editor of the film. He functions as both innovator and diplomat in those capacities. He has directed 37 films, and has been ""discovered"" by the West since 1990. In 1997, his film, TASTE OF CHERRY, won the Palm d'Or at Cannes. Presently he is a professor, and he lives in Paris.As director he is creative and rogue. He breaks away from conventional narrative, and usually works without a script. He improvises, composes, matches dialogue to the landscape, and then later edits all of it. This gives many of his films, including this one, a documentary feel. He utilizes mostly non-actors and a small crew. He does not seem concerned about the girdle of genre or the cleats of convention. He creates something else in cinema, something ""new"".He cast the landscape as a character. Working with his excellent cinematographer, Mahmoud Kalari, they set up golden and ochre panoramas of village and countryside. This conformed to the respected Asian directors who have used the landscape as a living thing, and not merely a backdrop. Kiarostami would hold a shot double long, and just let things happen within the frame. This really gave a sense of immediacy to the viewer. For some, however, it was slow and boring.Was there a plot in this film? Well, there was, kind of. Behzad Dourani, called the Engineer, masquerading as an anthropologist, or a treasure hunter, who is probably a filmmaker, and alter-ego for Kiarostami, drove 450 miles north of Tehran to a small Kurdish village. Through a contact in the village, he was aware of a special ceremony that was going to occur when a village elder, an old lady, dies. He was there to film and to capture that ceremony. The old woman, however, did not comply. People were so kind to her, she decided to take nourishment, and she returned to the land of the living.There were several, almost hidden, themes in the movie. For one thing, the director worked hard at creating a more humane face on the Arab world. Post 9/11, that is quite a task. Nothing political was ever discussed in the film. Another theme was the importance of education. An intense of love of learning, of math, engineering, poetry, and literature worked themselves into the fabric of the non-plot. Something else explored was the reality of death, the close proximity we all share with it, and the need to enjoy our lives every moment that we breathe. Lastly the primary theme was Nature vs. Technology, and the postulate that things natural were preferred.I liked this film, even though I had to have patience with it. Artistically and cinematically, it required some learning on my part. I did so gladly. It is a wonderful movie cloaked in non-convention.",4,Dark Wind Whispering,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,2778,"['film', 'called', 'BAD', 'MA', 'RA', 'KHAHAD', 'BORD', 'Iran', 'Abbas', 'Kiarostami', 'director', 'writer', 'producer', 'editor', 'film', 'innovator', 'diplomat', 'capacities', 'directed', '37', 'films', 'been', 'discovered', 'West', '1990', '1997', 'film', 'TASTE', 'OF', 'CHERRY', 'won', 'Palm', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Presently', 'professor', 'Paris.As', 'director', 'creative', 'rogue', 'away', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'usually', 'script', 'composes', 'matches', 'dialogue', 'landscape', 'then', 'later', 'many', 'films', 'including', 'one', 'documentary', 'feel', 'mostly', 'non-actors', 'small', 'crew', 'not', 'seem', 'concerned', 'girdle', 'genre', 'cleats', 'convention', 'something', 'else', 'cinema', 'something', 'new', '.He', 'cast', 'landscape', 'character', 'Working', 'excellent', 'cinematographer', 'Mahmoud', 'Kalari', 'set', 'up', 'golden', 'ochre', 'panoramas', 'village', 'countryside', 'conformed', 'respected', 'Asian', 'directors', 'who', 'have', 'used', 'landscape', 'living', 'thing', 'not', 'merely', 'backdrop', 'Kiarostami', 'would', 'hold', 'shot', 'double', 'long', 'just', 'let', 'things', 'happen', 'frame', 'really', 'gave', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'viewer', 'however', 'was', 'slow', 'boring.Was', 'there', 'plot', 'film', 'Well', 'was', 'kind', 'Behzad', 'Dourani', 'called', 'Engineer', 'masquerading', 'anthropologist', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'who', 'probably', 'filmmaker', 'alter-ego', 'Kiarostami', 'drove', '450', 'miles', 'north', 'Tehran', 'small', 'Kurdish', 'village', 'contact', 'village', 'was', 'aware', 'special', 'ceremony', 'was', 'going', 'occur', 'when', 'village', 'elder', 'old', 'lady', 'dies', 'was', 'there', 'film', 'capture', 'ceremony', 'old', 'woman', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'comply', 'People', 'were', 'so', 'kind', 'decided', 'take', 'nourishment', 'returned', 'land', 'were', 'several', 'almost', 'hidden', 'themes', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'director', 'worked', 'hard', 'creating', 'more', 'humane', 'face', 'Arab', 'world', 'Post', '9/11', 'quite', 'task', 'Nothing', 'political', 'was', 'ever', 'discussed', 'film', 'theme', 'was', 'importance', 'education', 'intense', 'love', 'learning', 'math', 'engineering', 'poetry', 'literature', 'worked', 'fabric', 'non-plot', 'Something', 'else', 'explored', 'was', 'reality', 'death', 'close', 'proximity', 'share', 'need', 'enjoy', 'lives', 'moment', 'breathe', 'Lastly', 'primary', 'theme', 'was', 'Nature', 'Technology', 'postulate', 'things', 'natural', 'were', 'preferred.I', 'liked', 'film', 'even', 'had', 'have', 'patience', 'Artistically', 'cinematically', 'required', 'learning', 'part', 'did', 'so', 'gladly', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'cloaked', 'non-convention']",N/A
708770,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00006ADES,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 2]","Many people who like Kiarostami talk about Taste of Cherry or Close Up when speaking of his work.  This film, however, I think is better than those two excellent films.  This was the 2nd film of his I saw, and I think it's a masterpiece.  It's very funny, poetic, telling, dramatic, and deeply mysterious.  There are many choice moments in the film.  The fact that many of the characters are never actually seen, only heard is actually fascinating.  The lead character has whole conversations with a man digging a trench, even though we never see him.  The lead character's constant problems with his cell phone are good, too.  But the scene I really like the most is when the lead character buys milk from a local merchant.  The merchant's daughter leads the man down into a cave where they keep their cow, and while talking to the daughter, recites a beautiful poem in which the title of the film comes up.  There really is no explanation to why the man reads the poem, but it haunts the film.  Kiarostami's style is worth noting too.  The poem scene is shot in one long, 5 minute take, and many of the other scenes are shot in a long take style that he used for many of his films.  It gives the film a very meditative pace, and it works wonderfully.  Most Iranians films are very mysterious and ambiguous at times, telling you only bits of what is actually transpiring.  All of the ones I've seen have been wonderful, with special mention going to Abbas Kiarostami and Majid Majidi, the two directors I most admire.

708771,ARJ4W05FDPQZ9,B00006ADES,"Howie ""tomas""","[5, 25]","-One of the golden rules I go by when watching a DVD is this: I eventually look aside at the DVD player's timer.  I do this because the movie has disconnected with my brain; it's more of a visceral reaction, not something I do consciously.So, I make a note of the time on the timer. If the number is low, say a 7 or an 8 minutes, then the movie usually gets kicked out - it won't hold my attention and I have better things to do with my time than watch a bad movie.  If it's high, 25 or 30 minutes, then the movie has surpassed my expectations.This movie rated a 16 minute-glance.  Not great, really.  Not &quot;terrible&quot;, either.The things I enjoyed here are the glimpses of rural Iranian life.  A couple things struck me: 1. the old lady knew what telecommunications was.  Maybe the average rural arab is not the middle-ages barbarian most westerners think he is.2. We in the west have this image of the typical Arab as a wholy devout Muslim, spending all their time talking about God and praying, and telling the world how much they hate Americans.  God was only mentioned a couple times in this film, and the people wpent most of their day eeking out a life from the soil.This made me think that maybe these people really aren't very different than us in the west: America calls itself a christian nation, but the majority of American's don't believe in Christianity or don't exercise their faith.  Maybe the same is true of Arabs.3. What a rich yet simple life they lead.  The small village was beautiful - it wasn't filmed as well as it could have been, but still the atmosphere came through.  I wanted to move there.And what gorgeous land they lived in!  Absolutely breathtaking!The story was simple enough - I think the crew (whom we hear but never see) is a TV crew, not a film crew (some people use the word &quot;film&quot; interchangeably for both video and film).  Since the event they have arrived to document never happens (we never see the old lady), the &quot;engineer&quot; spend weeks in this village killing time (since the entire movie plodded along, we never really got the sense that he was there for weeks rather than days).There were many interesting &quot;polt&quot; points.  I particularly liked the engineer's interaction with the man digging the hole.  And the woman milking the cow.But, I have to say, the phone gimmick really got to me after a while.  I'd hear the thing go off, see him pick it up and say, &quot;Allo?  Allo?&quot;  And I'd say to myself, &quot;Not again!&quot;About 1/6 of this film is footage of the guy driving his car.Foreign films are great when they give you glimpses of cultures quite alien to our western culture.  It's usually for this reason that I watch them.  Being a great film is icing on the cake.The film succeeded as a glimpse of Iran, but failed as a story.  So I got the cake without the icing.I should say here that the movie would have rated 3 stars were it not for the absolutely horrible DVD pressing.  All images that moved quickly past the frame tore along their edges.

And I am fully aware that most of us in mainstream culture in present times have been spoiled to look at movie as instant gratification entertainment.  But there are films that need no dissertation or thesis to admire.  And then there are films where one rushes to amazon or cineaste websites, in a feverish anxiety, attempting to discover just what a viewer was supposed to be appreciating in a film he or she just spent 120 minutes moving glaciatically through.The Wind Will Carry Us belongs to the latter category.I assess a movie by its sum parts.  Can scenes or parts be subtracted with the message intact?  In this Kiarostami film, I found I kept subtracting until I finally reached one or two core scenes.  The most accessible is the figure of the doctor who travels through the countryside looking at nature.  The footage is so gorgeously shot, and the doctor's organic, earthy philosophy is rich to the point that I said, ""oh, so THIS is the moment we've been waiting for!""But what of the 110 minutes leading up to it?  It's leisurely and it does capture the slow pace of a small remote village..  The regional light is richly tempered and the labyrinthian passages of the living quarters provides many opportunities for Ozu-inspired shots.  The repetitive ""pilgrimage"" to the top of the mountain is a comedy in itself, worthy of a wireless cell phone commercial one imagines would play in Iran.I don't want to read too much into it, so I'll just say, the film asserts it's right to exist, just as the small village continues, uninterrupted by ""engineers"" or documentarians who want to treat it as a petri dish culture for observation.

One of the finest moments in the film is a subtly erotic moment when the protagonist recites the poem by Forugh Farrokhzad from which the film takes its name to a girl milking an animal (a goat? a cow?). (Farrokhzad - an Iranian feminist poetess who died at age 32 - is very interesting in her own right, and the introduction to her work is another thing I'm grateful to Kiarostami for.)The pace and style are very similar to those of Gus Van Sant's recent films (e.g., ""Gerry"").

708779,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00006ADES,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[8, 8]","I loved ""The Wind Will Carry Us"" for many reasons. First, there are two story lines, one is what is happening on the physical plane and the other is a representation of two ideas and ways of living.The main plot is fairly basic. A man goes to a small village (Siah Dareh) built up against a barren mountainside. This alone is fascinating as you observe a culture and how the people live their daily lives. One of the main things that keeps happening throughout the movie is a cell phone ringing.Each time the phone rings, the engineer from Tehran (Behzad Dourani) has to get into his car and drive up to higher ground. This is interesting because each time he does this something new happens. It almost becomes a little comical, but the funniest part for me was the relationship between the husband and wife in the teashop. I was amused at how similar relationships are in all cultures and how men and women form a deep bond all while withstanding the daily conflicts seeking to drive us apart.The movie felt very realistic and didn't seem to follow a script. I loved that aspect and also the conversations between the characters had real heart. Instead of ""how are you,"" ""I'm fine,"" they would say things about wishing each other a long life or luck or the most beautiful comment was about ""being in your service."" The conversations where very interesting and felt very natural, comforting and at times were profoundly beautiful.There was a strong community aspect where everyone joined together to make life more pleasant. The care and concern of the villagers was profound and moving and made you wish to just go live in this village where people seemed to have made peace with a way of life they truly enjoyed.I spent most of the time wondering why the engineer was there because I figured an engineer would be building something (although I did seem to understand that a tower was to be built - although the villagers were just digging a hole in the ground), but after reading the reviews, I can see why many think he may have been there to photograph a funeral (he was always carrying around a camera and talking to someone on the phone about a woman who was ill in the village), which makes much more sense. At first I thought he was bringing some sort of technology to the village, but in the end, this is more about how people choose to live.If you would like to lose yourself in a movie about a faraway village and see how people live their daily lives, this has a lot to offer. I have a love/hate relationship with cell phones, so this movie was especially interesting to me.~The Rebecca Review",5,Unique and Fascinating Cultural Experience,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,2605,"['loved', 'Wind', 'Will', 'Carry', 'Us', 'many', 'reasons', 'First', 'are', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'one', 'what', 'happening', 'physical', 'plane', 'other', 'representation', 'two', 'ideas', 'ways', 'living.The', 'main', 'plot', 'fairly', 'basic', 'man', 'small', 'village', 'Siah', 'Dareh', 'built', 'up', 'barren', 'mountainside', 'alone', 'fascinating', 'observe', 'culture', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'daily', 'lives', 'One', 'main', 'things', 'happening', 'movie', 'cell', 'phone', 'ringing.Each', 'time', 'phone', 'rings', 'engineer', 'Tehran', 'Behzad', 'Dourani', 'get', 'car', 'drive', 'up', 'higher', 'ground', 'interesting', 'time', 'something', 'new', 'happens', 'almost', 'little', 'comical', 'funniest', 'part', 'was', 'relationship', 'husband', 'wife', 'teashop', 'was', 'amused', 'how', 'similar', 'relationships', 'are', 'cultures', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'form', 'deep', 'bond', 'withstanding', 'daily', 'conflicts', 'seeking', 'drive', 'apart.The', 'movie', 'felt', 'very', 'realistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'follow', 'script', 'loved', 'aspect', 'also', 'conversations', 'characters', 'had', 'real', 'heart', 'Instead', 'how', 'are', ""'m"", 'fine', 'would', 'say', 'things', 'wishing', 'other', 'long', 'life', 'luck', 'most', 'beautiful', 'comment', 'was', 'being', 'service', 'conversations', 'where', 'very', 'interesting', 'felt', 'very', 'natural', 'comforting', 'times', 'were', 'profoundly', 'beautiful.There', 'was', 'strong', 'community', 'aspect', 'where', 'everyone', 'joined', 'together', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'pleasant', 'care', 'concern', 'villagers', 'was', 'profound', 'moving', 'made', 'wish', 'just', 'go', 'live', 'village', 'where', 'people', 'seemed', 'have', 'made', 'peace', 'way', 'life', 'truly', 'enjoyed.I', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'wondering', 'why', 'engineer', 'was', 'there', 'figured', 'engineer', 'would', 'be', 'building', 'something', 'did', 'seem', 'understand', 'tower', 'was', 'be', 'built', 'villagers', 'were', 'just', 'digging', 'hole', 'ground', 'reading', 'reviews', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'many', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'photograph', 'funeral', 'was', 'always', 'carrying', 'around', 'camera', 'talking', 'someone', 'phone', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'ill', 'village', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'bringing', 'sort', 'technology', 'village', 'end', 'more', 'how', 'people', 'choose', 'live.If', 'would', 'like', 'lose', 'movie', 'faraway', 'village', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'daily', 'lives', 'lot', 'offer', 'have', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'cell', 'phones', 'movie', 'was', 'especially', 'interesting', 'me.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
708780,A3OE75XDY2ON6V,B00006ADES,"Teresa R. Asgharian ""m""","[5, 5]","Another Kiarostami masterpiece. His films begin in the middle of a conversation and slowly grow and develop and evolve. You just never really know where it's going, and the pace is usually along the lines of ""meandering"". His films don't race and scream around, they just gradually flow. This can be infuriating to some folks. To me, it's wonderful. I love to study the scenery and the interpersonal relations, and you are given ample opportunity to absorb and digest.By watching my inlaws I can see that the pace set here among the people in the villages that he enjoys filming is true. ""Right away"" means in a month or so, or whenever. So when the film-maker goes to document the traditional grieving and burial rituals(which is taboo) among these villagers because this elderly woman is going to die ""right away"", I knew immediately that it could be days or years. It's enjoyable to me to see the frustration of the fast-paced city people among the rural folk, I found myself giggling often.However...to me this film took a potentially dark turn towards the end. It doesn't detract from the film, it plays into it quite well. And maybe it's just me. But I had a question about some possible actions on the part of the film-maker in the movie. I keep trying to get other folks to watch it also so we can compare impressions. I can't say more or it would give too much away and ruin the film, and I'm just not going to do that.Nobody else here has mentioned it, so perhaps I'm wrong. But I've seen each of the Kiarostami films that are released here and I think I've got a pretty good feel for his particular director's language. So if you hit a spot when you find yourself thinking, ""i wonder..."", let's compare notes!!!",5,will she or won't she?,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,1722,"['Kiarostami', 'masterpiece', 'films', 'begin', 'middle', 'conversation', 'slowly', 'grow', 'develop', 'evolve', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'pace', 'usually', 'lines', 'meandering', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'race', 'scream', 'around', 'just', 'gradually', 'flow', 'can', 'be', 'infuriating', 'folks', 'wonderful', 'love', 'study', 'scenery', 'interpersonal', 'relations', 'are', 'given', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'absorb', 'digest.By', 'watching', 'inlaws', 'can', 'see', 'pace', 'set', 'here', 'people', 'villages', 'filming', 'true', 'Right', 'away', 'month', 'so', 'whenever', 'So', 'when', 'film-maker', 'document', 'traditional', 'grieving', 'burial', 'rituals', 'taboo', 'villagers', 'elderly', 'woman', 'going', 'die', 'right', 'away', 'knew', 'immediately', 'could', 'be', 'days', 'years', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'frustration', 'fast-paced', 'city', 'people', 'rural', 'folk', 'found', 'giggling', 'often.However', 'film', 'took', 'potentially', 'dark', 'turn', 'end', ""n't"", 'detract', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'maybe', 'just', 'had', 'question', 'possible', 'actions', 'part', 'film-maker', 'movie', 'keep', 'trying', 'get', 'other', 'folks', 'watch', 'also', 'can', 'compare', 'impressions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'would', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'ruin', 'film', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'that.Nobody', 'else', 'here', 'mentioned', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Kiarostami', 'films', 'are', 'released', 'here', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'feel', 'particular', 'director', 'language', 'So', 'hit', 'spot', 'when', 'find', 'thinking', 'i', 'wonder', 'let', 'compare', 'notes']",N/A
