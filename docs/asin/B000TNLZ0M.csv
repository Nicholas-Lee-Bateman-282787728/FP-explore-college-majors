I say this because it's an intense portrayal of poker-playing and gamblers in Vegas &#8212; yet I don't play cards of any kind, AND I never watch poker-playing on TV. The characterizations were believable enough to draw me in; and the suspense around the card table competitions kept my attention throughout &#8212; not because I understood the hands played, but because the drama was convincing and I cared about the characters. (I sat here with a book in my lap, yet never turned a page while this movie was playing.) This is actually more a drama than a love story; Drew Barrymore isn't in it as much as some romantics would like. Most of the intensity really occurs between the young gambler, his father (Robert Duvall) &#8212; and the cards.

1091664,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000TNLZ0M,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[7, 8]","If you aren't a fan of high-stakes poker, or the gambling lifestyle, in general, Curtis Hanson's ""Lucky You"" may seem a 'bad bet', particularly as a romantic vehicle for Eric Bana and Drew Barrymore; but if you enjoy the rush of the game, and the Vegas lifestyle, circa 2003, this one is a keeper!While the film lacks the intensity of ""The Cincinnati Kid"", ""The Gambler"", or ""The Rounders"", or loopy reality of ""California Split"", I'd still rank it among the better films about gambling, simply because of Hanson's non-apologetic approach to the subject, and respect for the practitioners (with many real-life gamblers appearing in the various match-ups). As the estranged son of a poker legend (Robert Duvall, who is, as always, superb), Eric Bana is quite convincing as a gifted, if headstrong gambler, for whom money, anyone's money, is simply a tool to ply his trade. He has a code of ethics, but ultimately, being in the game is the most important thing in his life, which puts him into romantic jeopardy when he (unconvincingly) falls for innocent aspiring singer Drew Barrymore. Needless to say, he learns that life isn't only about the next pot, but his moments with her are the least believable aspect of the film.On the plus side, poker, Vegas-style, is portrayed lovingly, with quirky characters, venues unique to themselves, and an adrenaline rush that never ends. It isn't the glamorous 'Never Never Land' of TV's ""Vegas"", but a continuing stage for fortunes to be won and lost, and won, again, where novice gamblers fuel the cashflow for seasoned pros. Hanson 'scores' here, and as a Vegas resident, I can honestly say he captures the city's spirit, perfectly!The Special Features of the DVD are quite wonderful, with insights by professional poker players, and an understandable explanation of the vagaries of poker (""The best hand doesn't always win, it's how the hand is played"").All-in-all, ""Lucky You"" doesn't deliver a big jackpot, but is certainly a winning hand!",4,Flawed but Surprisingly Entertaining...,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1984,"['are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'high-stakes', 'poker', 'gambling', 'lifestyle', 'general', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'Lucky', 'may', 'seem', ""'bad"", 'bet', 'particularly', 'romantic', 'vehicle', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'enjoy', 'rush', 'game', 'Vegas', 'lifestyle', 'circa', '2003', 'one', 'keeper', 'film', 'intensity', 'Cincinnati', 'Kid', 'Gambler', 'Rounders', 'loopy', 'reality', 'California', 'Split', ""'d"", 'still', 'rank', 'better', 'films', 'gambling', 'simply', 'Hanson', 'non-apologetic', 'approach', 'subject', 'respect', 'practitioners', 'many', 'real-life', 'gamblers', 'appearing', 'various', 'match-ups', 'estranged', 'son', 'poker', 'legend', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'always', 'superb', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'quite', 'convincing', 'gifted', 'headstrong', 'gambler', 'whom', 'money', 'anyone', 'money', 'simply', 'tool', 'ply', 'trade', 'code', 'ethics', 'ultimately', 'being', 'game', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'romantic', 'jeopardy', 'when', 'unconvincingly', 'innocent', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Needless', 'say', 'life', ""n't"", 'only', 'next', 'pot', 'moments', 'are', 'least', 'believable', 'aspect', 'film.On', 'plus', 'side', 'poker', 'Vegas-style', 'portrayed', 'lovingly', 'quirky', 'characters', 'venues', 'unique', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'never', ""n't"", 'glamorous', 'Never', 'Land', 'TV', 'Vegas', 'continuing', 'stage', 'fortunes', 'be', 'won', 'lost', 'won', 'again', 'where', 'novice', 'gamblers', 'fuel', 'cashflow', 'seasoned', 'pros', 'Hanson', 'here', 'Vegas', 'resident', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'city', 'spirit', 'perfectly', 'Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'insights', 'professional', 'poker', 'players', 'understandable', 'explanation', 'vagaries', 'poker', 'best', 'hand', ""n't"", 'always', 'win', 'how', 'hand', 'played', '.All-in-all', 'Lucky', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'big', 'jackpot', 'certainly', 'winning', 'hand']",N/A

Most of us know of the big shows in vegas, Texas Hold'em, and slot machines but the life of the people who call Vegas home, we're not so familiar with - and mostly don't care.  The movie introduces that in a very natural way which I found quite fascinating.  Also the idea of risk and gambling (rules of poker) is applied throughout the movie - in conversations and relationships - which was also a very nice touch to this movie about poker.There's a lot of poker playing.  And they've scouted real poker players to be in the movie - some poker celebrities!

It gives justice to their ""sport"" with realistic hands, playing, situations and attitudes.Often, I thought something hokey was going to happen, something predictable but rarely did that occur in this film. You really never knew what was going to happen and suspense builds for a number of gambling scenes. I hesitate to say more for fear of spoiling anything. Suffice to say, the gambling scenes in here were very realistic. I know what from the behind-the-scenes bonus features in which a number of real-life professional players commented on that fact.The film follows a father-and-son team (Eric Bana and Robert Duvall playing ""Huck"" and ""L.C.

1091670,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000TNLZ0M,Cubist,"[3, 5]","After the surprise critical and semi-commercial hit ofL.A. Confidential, director Curtis Hanson followed it up with the equally critically-laudedWonder Boysthat, despite two separate theatrical releases, failed to connect with a mainstream audience. Even with the presence of Cameron Diaz, Hanson'sIn Her Shoes (Widescreen Edition)received a mixed critical reaction and lackluster box office. His latest film, Lucky You, was supposed to be released a year ago and the studio sat on it while they figured out how to market the film. The release date was pushed back on numerous occasions before it was unceremoniously released on the same weekend asSpider-Man 3 (2-Disc Special Edition). This is usually the sign that said film is a mess.Lucky You tries hard to immerse us in the world of poker by throwing around authentic lingo and populating the film with cameos from real-life poker champs but it often feels forced and too slick unlike Robert Altman'sCalifornia Splitwhich is a much more successful, character-driven film with a less polished veneer. Ultimately, Hanson is a studio director who makes traditional genre films and Lucky You ends nice and neat with all of the conflicts cleanly resolved. This makes its lack of success even more baffling. Are audiences too jaded to accept this kind of movie or has the public's fascination with poker past its prime?""The Players at the Table."" According to Hanson, all of the poker players in the film are real, some famous and some not. For the director, it was important to do this in order to give the film an authenticity and to surround the actors with skilled players to make them look good.""The Reel Deal - The Time and Place of Lucky You."" Hanson did research in Vegas at the 2003 World Series of Poker and was inspired by the winner, a guy who was an Internet poker player. After that event, the game's profile grew immensely in popularity.Finally, there are nine minutes of deleted scenes that include more of Billie singing.

1091675,AY12DBB0U420B,B000TNLZ0M,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I enjoy watching poker playing on the TV sports channels. I'm not sure why. It''s just fascinating, I guess, or it beats anything else on the other channels. In any case, I have four sports channels and poker is on at least one of them most of the time. Well, I then ran into this ""Lucky You"" DVD starring Eric Bana and Drew Barrymore in the bargain five-dollar rack and decided to give it a try. It's quite a good movie, but I should issue a disclaimer. To enjoy the movie, you ought to have a strong interest in poker or at least watching the poker shows on television. Without that interest, you'll probably find the movie rather dull.Eric Bana plays a professional poker player who's trying to get up the $10K fee to enter the World Series of Poker event held annually in Las Vegas. His success is off and on. Along the  way he meets Drew Barrymore, a singer with her first Las Vegas gig. A romance develops, but it's a real mild affair and you wouldn't be watching the movie for this reason. The whole movie is very low key and mildly humorous, I might add, and is centered around the life of a low-level gambler in Las Vegas. Ho-hum. Well, it became very interesting to me when I started to realize that I knew the people around the poker tables. A lot of them looked very familiar. Well, they were. They were many of the same people you see sitting around the tables on the television poker shows. Most were just poker players, but some had small speaking parts. It's a very strange movie, and can be quite enjoyable. The plot and sub-plots give the movie structure, but without an interest in poker and poker playing, they probably wouldn't make for much of a movie. Don't get me wrong on this. I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was exceptionally well done.Everything about  this movie is low key. The story is ho-hum. The acting is good, but at a very low-key level.

1091676,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B000TNLZ0M,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[3, 3]","I saw this movie last year during a free screening. It was a decent date movie about love and poker. Despite the title, ""Lucky You"" is really about an down and out poker play, Huck Cheever, trying to get into a famous poker tournament. A big part of the movie is Huck's rivalry with his dad who beats up in the poker table. We see Huck have a lover Suzanne Offer. However, eventually he falls for her sister whois a singer.Barrymore hasn't looked she's aged much. Her performance is good here. However, to be honest this role is the same as other roles she's played where she falls in love with a guy that hurts her. Bana is convincing as the down on his luck poker play who hates his dad. Duvall by this point is a master in playing the stuffy, arrogant, old man at the twilight of his career. ""Lucky You"" in a way this is one of those movies where the major character as hard he tries is an underachiever who can't cut a break. Nothing ever seems to work for him including relationships. This movie also has the familiar ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, then loses her again"" plot that that audiences will eat up.I remember the audience though did love it and the movie does manage to blend in comedy and drama and shows you a bit of what's like in the card playing world of poker.The release of the movie in May just seems totally illogical. With all the summer blockbusters coming up, it seems destined to be a movie that will be forgotten amidst the hype of the other movies. Still it's a decent movie and the acting is fine.

I also love poker.  Combine the two and I thought this movie was going to be fantastic!But it wasn't.First of all, Drew Barrymore's character (Billie) was completely unrealistic.  Here is a girl who is disgusted by dishonesty but yet hangs out with a guy who robs from her, lies to her, and encourages her to lie and cheat herself.  Why does she even bother?Eric Bana's character is a bit more interesting as Huck, a professional gambler who takes all risks at the game of poker but plays it safely in life.  The movie is all about him trying to reverse those two roles... to play safely in poker and live on the edge in life while dealing with a girlfriend, a dysfunctional father, compulsive gaming, and a damaging history.  But I just wasn't sold that the events that happened to him were motivation enough to make him want to change his life.And then the poker.  I love Texas Hold'em on ESPN but what makes poker so fun and interesting is that everything is random.  In this movie, everything is scripted down to what the river is going to turn over.  There are very few surprises and even these surprises are completely scripted.  It just took all the fun out of poker.So, the poker isn't excited and the characters are only modestly interesting if you can get past the fact that the two main characters would never get together in a million years.The only thing I can applaud is the acting as the all-star cast does do the best they can with a boring, slow, and awkward script.  The performances by Barrymore, Bana, and Duval are outstanding.  But if you are looking for good acting then I've got other movies to suggest that would be much more interesting.I just can't rate a movie more than two stars when I debate turning it off halfway through and then regret actually finishing it when I leave it on.  I just didn't get anything out of this movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless there is an actor in here you absolutely must see.",2,Two Hours of my Life I'll Never Recover,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,2116,"[""'ve"", 'totally', 'loved', 'everything', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'come', 'out', 'movie', '1998', 'Ever', 'especially', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'also', 'love', 'poker', 'Combine', 'two', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'fantastic', ""wasn't.First"", 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'Billie', 'was', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'Here', 'girl', 'who', 'disgusted', 'dishonesty', 'yet', 'out', 'guy', 'who', 'robs', 'lie', 'cheat', 'Why', 'even', 'bother', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'Huck', 'professional', 'gambler', 'who', 'risks', 'game', 'poker', 'safely', 'life', 'movie', 'trying', 'reverse', 'two', 'roles', 'play', 'safely', 'poker', 'live', 'edge', 'life', 'dealing', 'girlfriend', 'dysfunctional', 'father', 'compulsive', 'gaming', 'damaging', 'history', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'sold', 'events', 'happened', 'were', 'motivation', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'change', 'life.And', 'then', 'poker', 'love', 'Texas', ""Hold'em"", 'ESPN', 'what', 'poker', 'so', 'fun', 'interesting', 'everything', 'random', 'movie', 'everything', 'scripted', 'down', 'what', 'river', 'going', 'turn', 'over', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'surprises', 'even', 'surprises', 'are', 'completely', 'scripted', 'just', 'took', 'fun', 'poker.So', 'poker', ""n't"", 'excited', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'modestly', 'interesting', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'together', 'million', 'years.The', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'applaud', 'acting', 'all-star', 'cast', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'boring', 'slow', 'awkward', 'script', 'performances', 'Barrymore', 'Bana', 'Duval', 'are', 'outstanding', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'acting', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'other', 'movies', 'suggest', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rate', 'movie', 'more', 'two', 'stars', 'when', 'debate', 'turning', 'off', 'halfway', 'then', 'regret', 'actually', 'finishing', 'when', 'leave', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anybody', 'actor', 'here', 'absolutely', 'must', 'see']",N/A

That is both true and untrue in ""Lucky You"", a character study, dramatic slice of life, and romance whose main point of existence is to extol the virtues that made poker and online gambling overwhlemingly popular in this country and elsewhere.""Lucky You"" is the story of a lowlife card shark (Eric Bana), his relationship with a high ethics singer that wanders into his life (Drew Barrymore), and his love-hate relationship with his father (Robert Duvall), who taught him the game, alienated the boy, and bested him at it all his life.Set in Las Vegas, of course, this morality tale about love, life, family, people and money doesn't have the elements of the greatest Las Vegas films like ""Casino"". Still, the strong work of the leads carries this movie. I've never seen Barrymore more erotic, seductive and persuasive than in her one-dimensional characterization here. This low pressure look at Americana has a feel and acting nearly as good as the much better and underappreciated ""A Slipping Down Life"", where another pair of lovebirds played out a similar lifestyle in the Southern music industry.More than anything else, this movie is about the popularity of one of America's fastest-growing Internet and real-life pastimes -- gambling and, in particular, poker. The final scenes, set in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, realistically depict the righteous media coverage this sports has obtained via pay per view, ESPN and other worldwide television outlets.While little of its intellectual appeal is present, some of the drama, competitiveness, tension and irascibility of the sport is made apparent in these closing scenes. Throughout the film, the lead character's addiction to gambling is everpresent and made real on screen by a fellow that can't stop it from overtaking him. This mellows in the happy final scenes, of course, where the good guy does the right thing, gets the girl, and makes up for decades of disparagement with dad.It's one of filmdom's most time-honoroed cliches, played for emotional appeal to close out this little movie. I admit I liked this film almost from the start and found most of its characters -- many bit parts are played by very familiar faces -- interesting, likeable and worth my time.

On the shelf for about two years, and opened (or, to be honest, ""dumped"") the same weekend as ""Spider-Man 3,"" it was rather given up on by the studio, but ""Lucky You,"" a poker movie that could have benefitted from being released when poker's popularity was at its apex, is unlike most movies based on current trend in that it is a good, little movie.While the romantic angle (between Eric Bana and Drew Barrymore) might not set off many fireworks, the story of a poker player (played by Bana) whose ""job"" is playing poker and who, as his father says, plays poker as he should lead his life, and leads his life as he should play poker, pulls one in (especially if they enjoy poker).In a time when most movies are sequels or remakes of TV shows or older movies, ""Lucky You"" is an original that focuses on the relationships between son and estranged father, and even though the son (Bana) can't forgive his father (played by Robert Duvall) for using and abandoning his mother, he commits the same things in his own relationships with women.He's emotional and more freewheeling in his poker playing, and yet he holds things close to the chest and is exploitative and even cold in his person-to-person relationships.That may sound boring to those moviegoers weaned on a diet of CGI, action and dramatic sequences merely as the thin thread between action cinematography, but something about it had me go to the theaters three times to see it.Perhaps the protagonist is much like us, the common people -- he's not perfect, we see that the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree, and by story's end, he makes a change, but only by degrees.... he's not a changed person, but a slightly smarter one, who learns to cut loose some emotional baggage that he'd been lugging around with him, hampering both his poker playing and his relationships.At times, the movie feels like a small brochure for Vegas, (and that's NOT a bad thing) as Bana rides about on his motorcycle on the Strip at night, and we see a diner here, a Chinese restaurant there, a small nightclub over here, and a number of hotel-casinos, but it's all entertaining, as we see him go from hotel to hotel, and even a golf course, all in his journey to get a seat at the World Series of Poker, of which, his father is a two-time winner.Much of the drama takes place at the poker table (whether it's on green felt, or across a pharmacy diner table), and it's played realistically (no multiples of great hands during one deal).It may not have the polish of Curtis Hanson's other movies, but it didn't deserve to be shelved either and thrown in a cage with Spider-Man, but it has an emotional pull (and some light funny moments that will bring a smile to your face).It's better than the sum of its parts and has the right blend of drama and atmosphere that will have me going back to the table for another deal.When other movies choose to play things big and loud, Lucky You plays things small and close to the heart, and is a winning hand because of it.",4,"I'm all in for ""Lucky You,"" which got bad hand from moviegoers",1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3096,"['Lucky', 'received', 'bad', 'hand', 'studio', 'many',

Bana's entire performance  never rises above a monotone. At the five minute mark the first song is played, and it's pretty interesting that it's ""Lucky Town"" by Bruce Springsteen which was released in 1992. The main character displays every characteristic of being a helpless gambling addict, which is at least a serious problem, if not a disease, yet in the entire two hour movie, only one or two small comments are made regarding this. The main sub-plot is the fact that Huck's Father (Played by Robert Duvall) deserted the family and stole from Huck's mother. Duvall, whose hair looks like it was put on with a shoe shine kit, has won the world series of poker twice, and the entire story leads to a confrontation with both Father and son competing against each other in this years world series of poker.The pace of the film is slow and meanders throughout. In the middle of the movie there are two scenes that would have been a perfect place to make a statement about true gambling addiction problems, but the writers let it pass by without even an attempt at making a redeeming social comment. Father and son meet in a coffee shop around breakfast time, and Huck had just finally put together $10,000.00 in a backers money for the entry fee for the world series of poker. In ten minutes, the Father wins it from him, and the next scene is Huck making a $5,000.00 bet (With money he doesn't have!) That he can run five miles and then play 18 holes of scratch golf all in under three hours.Of course, he loses that bet too. While this is going on Drew Barrymore has a supporting role as Huck's new love interest. I won't give away the tepid ending, but you can bet, that it wasn't ""bad luck"" , that made this movie disappear from theaters in the ""blink of an eye"".",3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""LOOK FOR YOUR LUCK ELSEWHERE!""",1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,1891,"['story', 'place', 'Las', 'Vegas', '2003', 'around', 'young', 'gambling', 'addict', 'Huck', 'Cheever', 'played', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Bana', 'entire', 'performance', 'never', 'monotone', 'five', 'minute', 'mark', 'first', 'song', 'played', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Lucky', 'Town', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'was', 'released', '1992', 'main', 'character', 'displays', 'characteristic', 'being', 'helpless', 'gambling', 'addict', 'least', 'serious', 'problem', 'not', 'disease', 'yet', 'entire', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'small', 'comments', 'are', 'made', 'regarding', 'main', 'sub-plot', 'fact', 'Huck', 'Father', 'Played', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'deserted', 'family', 'stole', 'Huck', 'mother', 'Duvall', 'hair', 'was', 'put', 'shoe', 'shine', 'kit', 'won', 'world', 'series', 'poker', 'twice', 'entire', 'story', 'confrontation', 'Father', 'son', 'competing', 'other', 'years', 'world', 'series', 'poker.The', 'pace', 'film', 'slow', 'meanders', 'middle', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'place', 'make', 'statement', 'true', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'problems', 'writers', 'let', 'pass', 'even', 'attempt', 'making', 'redeeming', 'social', 'comment', 'Father', 'son', 'meet', 'coffee', 'shop', 'breakfast', 'time', 'Huck', 'had', 'just', 'finally', 'put', 'together', '10,000.00', 'backers', 'money', 'entry', 'fee', 'world', 'series', 'poker', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Father', 'next', 'scene', 'Huck', 'making', '5,000.00', 'bet', 'money', ""n't"", 'have', 'can', 'run', 'five', 'miles', 'then', 'play', '18', 'holes', 'scratch', 'golf', 'three', 'hours.Of', 'course', 'bet', 'too', 'going', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'supporting', 'role', 'Huck', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'tepid', 'ending', 'can', 'bet', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'luck', 'made', 'movie', 'disappear', 'theaters', 'blink', 'eye']",N/A

A. Confidential?"" with something other than ""no"". Still, I keep giving him chances, and when I found out he was helming Lucky You, the first major poker movie since Rounders, I had high hopes. As usual, however, they were dashed pretty quickly. As well, I have also discovered that I will never be able to see Eric Bana without hearing him snarl ""Do I look like Mother Theresa to you?"" in my head. That, however, is a topic of conversation for another (and much, much better) review.The story concerns Huck Cheever (Bana), a professional poker player who also happens to be a compulsive gambler. Worse, his game (and personality) goes into the toilet whenever his father L. C. (Robert Duvall) is around. Huck is trying to get himself a seat in the 2003 World Series of Poker, but his ambition is derailed-- ever so slightly-- by the appearance of his friend's sister Billie (Drew Barrymore) in Las Vegas. Huck, meet Billie. Billie, meet Huck. Sparks fly. A romance is born.The pity of it all is that that romance is as predictable and silly as any Harlequin novel. The tragedy of it all is that the poker is about the same. You know as soon as you see Huck and L. C., and they commence the endless running dialogue about Huck's mother's wedding ring, what's going to happen in the final poker scene, and if you've read any romance novels, you've probably got a better understanding of exactly what's going to happen between Huck and Billie than did Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay. Roth has multiple Academy Award nominations to his name, so you're probably wondering how on Earth he could have come up with such predictable mush, but read far enough down on his IMDB page, and you'll realize the Oscar he won was for Forrest Gump. Question answered.The one thing those behind the scenes on this turkey did get right is the essential weirdness of Las Vegas, and the background is wonderful. The minor characters are just great all the way around, it's the major ones who will have you steaming. Also, poker fans, Sam Farha (full disclosure: Sam Farha is my idol) gets more screen time here than he ever does on High Stakes Poker, and that might be worth a DVD rental if you're a fan. But you're far better off taking your nine bucks to a $1/$2 poker table than you are spending it seeing this movie in the theater. *",1,"I thought it hurt to watch, but that may have been my wife elbowing me.",1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,2480,"['Lucky', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', '2007', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'lot', 'years', 'be', 'able', 'answer', 'question', 'will', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'ever', 'make', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'L.', 'A', 'Confidential', 'something', 'other', 'Still', 'keep', 'giving', 'chances', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'helming', 'Lucky', 'first', 'major', 'poker', 'movie', 'Rounders', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'usual', 'however', 'were', 'dashed', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'As', 'well', 'have', 'also', 'discovered', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'hearing', 'snarl', 'Do', 'look', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'head', 'however', 'topic', 'conversation', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'review.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Huck', 'Cheever', 'Bana', 'professional', 'poker', 'player', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'Worse', 'game', 'personality', 'toilet', 'whenever', 'father', 'L.', 'C.', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'around', 'Huck', 'trying', 'get', 'seat', '2003', 'World', 'Series', 'Poker', 'ambition', 'derailed', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'appearance', 'friend', 'sister', 'Billie', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Huck', 'meet', 'Billie', 'Billie', 'meet', 'Huck', 'Sparks', 'fly', 'romance', 'born.The', 'pity', 'romance', 'predictable', 'silly', 'Harlequin', 'novel', 'tragedy', 'poker', 'same', 'know', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'Huck', 'L.', 'C.', 'commence', 'endless', 'running', 'dialogue', 'Huck', 'mother', 'wedding', 'ring', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'final', 'poker', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'read', 'romance', 'novels', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'got', 'better', 'understanding', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Huck', 'Billie', 'did', 'Eric', 'Roth', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Roth', 'multiple', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'name', ""'re"", 'probably', 'wondering', 'how', 'Earth', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'such', 'predictable', 'mush', 'read', 'far', 'enough', 'down', 'IMDB', 'page', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'Oscar', 'won', 'was', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Question', 'one', 'thing', 'scenes', 'turkey', 'did', 'get', 'right', 'essential', 'weirdness', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'background', 'wonderful', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'way', 'major', 'ones', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'steaming', 'Also', 'poker', 'fans', 'Sam', 'Farha', 'full', 'disclosure', 'Sam', 'Farha', 'idol', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'here', 'ever', 'High', 'Stakes', 'Poker', 'might', 'be', 'DVD', 'rental', ""'re"", 'fan', ""'re"", 'far', 'better', 'off', 'taking', 'nine', 'bucks', '1/', '2', 'poker', 'table', 'are', 'spending', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theater', '*']",N/A

Zwick,"[1, 2]","**1/2Only the most die-hard poker fans will find much to cheer about in ""Lucky You,"" a Freudian drama set in the high-stakes world of the Vegas strip.Eric Bana (""Munich"") and Robert Duvall star as Huck and L.C. Cheever, two world-class poker players with many unresolved father/son issues between them.  Huck resents the fact that he's had to live virtually all his adult life in the shadow of his famous father who, with his constant carousing, stealing and gambling, made life a living hell for Huck's mother virtually till the day she died. What Huck doesn`t realize - and this is where Doctor Freud comes in - is that he is pretty much following in his father`s footsteps both in his choice of profession and his relations with women.  Meanwhile, L.C. hangs out around the casinos and coffee shops of the city trying to reconcile with his boy, while at the same time, doling out unasked-for advice about how the young man should be living his life both at and away from the poker table.  Drew Barrymore completes the cast as Billie Offer, a young, morally upright ingenue from Bakersfield who has come to Sin City to begin her career as a singer and who winds up falling under the spell of the ethically-challenged Huck.  Or could it be that the beatific Billie is really an angel of the Lord come to lead the iniquitous Huck out of this modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah?The scenes between Bana and Barrymore are probably the best in the film and one wishes that more time would have been spent developing that relationship instead of sitting around the poker table.  For whenever the story moves into the casino, the movie stops dead in its tracks, proving once again that poker, by its very nature, makes for one of the least compelling sports ever to be depicted on film.  Anyone without a thorough working knowledge of the ins and outs of Texas Hold'em, in particular, is going to find himself lost in all the arcane trivia of the poker-playing scenes (which take up quite a large chunk of the movie's overall running time, I might add).  Even worse is the fact that the father/son angle is so cliched and hackneyed at this point that even actors of the caliber of Bana and Duvall (and they are both excellent) can't be expected to really pull it off.There are some quality elements in ""Lucky You.""  Director Curtis Hanson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth, proves yet again - as he did in ""LA Confidential"" and ""8 Mile"" - that he knows how to extract the essence of a locale to build atmosphere and mood.  Moreover, the interactions between Huck and Billie are often flavorful and intriguing (which is more than can be said for those between Huck and his dad).  The performances are uniformly impressive, with Barrymore, in particular, showing a bit more range here than she has in most of her previous roles.Hanson has populated his film with a number of real life poker playing celebrities, which may be of interest to the aficionados but won't mean much to the rest of us.  Sad to say, but the lackluster ""Lucky You"" is unlikely to appeal to anyone not already passionate about professional poker - and unlikely to garner the sport itself many new fans.",2,Why poker and movies just don't mix,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,3172,"['**1/2Only', 'most', 'die-hard', 'poker', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'cheer', 'Lucky', 'Freudian', 'drama', 'set', 'high-stakes', 'world', 'Vegas', 'strip.Eric', 'Bana', 'Munich', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'star', 'Huck', 'L.C', 'Cheever', 'two', 'world-class', 'poker', 'players', 'many', 'unresolved', 'father/son', 'issues', 'Huck', 'fact', 'had', 'live', 'virtually', 'adult', 'life', 'shadow', 'famous', 'father', 'who', 'constant', 'carousing', 'stealing', 'gambling', 'made', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'Huck', 'mother', 'virtually', 'day', 'died', 'What', 'Huck', 'doesn', 't', 'realize', 'where', 'Doctor', 'Freud', 'pretty', 'much', 'following', 'father', 's', 'footsteps', 'choice', 'profession', 'relations', 'women', 'Meanwhile', 'L.C', 'hangs', 'out', 'casinos', 'coffee', 'shops', 'city', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'boy', 'same', 'time', 'doling', 'out', 'unasked-for', 'advice', 'how', 'young', 'man', 'should', 'be', 'living', 'life', 'away', 'poker', 'table', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'cast', 'Billie', 'Offer', 'young', 'morally', 'upright', 'ingenue', 'Bakersfield', 'who', 'come', 'Sin', 'City', 'begin', 'career', 'singer', 'who', 'up', 'falling', 'spell', 'ethically-challenged', 'Huck', 'could', 'be', 'beatific', 'Billie', 'really', 'angel', 'Lord', 'come', 'lead', 'iniquitous', 'Huck', 'modern-day', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'scenes', 'Bana', 'Barrymore', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'developing', 'relationship', 'instead', 'sitting', 'poker', 'table', 'whenever', 'story', 'casino', 'movie', 'dead', 'tracks', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'poker', 'very', 'nature', 'one', 'least', 'compelling', 'sports', 'ever', 'be', 'depicted', 'film', 'Anyone', 'thorough', 'working', 'knowledge', 'ins', 'outs', 'Texas', ""Hold'em"", 'particular', 'going', 'find', 'lost', 'arcane', 'trivia', 'poker-playing', 'scenes', 'take', 'up', 'quite', 'large', 'chunk', 'movie', 'overall', 'running', 'time', 'might', 'add', 'Even', 'worse', 'fact', 'father/son', 'angle', 'so', 'cliched', 'hackneyed', 'point', 'even', 'actors', 'caliber', 'Bana', 'Duvall', 'are', 'excellent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expected', 'really', 'pull', 'are', 'quality', 'elements', 'Lucky', 'Director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Eric', 'Roth', 'yet', 'again', 'did', 'LA', 'Confidential', '8', 'Mile', 'how', 'extract', 'essence', 'locale', 'build', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'Moreover', 'interactions', 'Huck', 'Billie', 'are', 'often', 'flavorful', 'intriguing', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Huck', 'dad', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'impressive', 'Barrymore', 'particular', 'showing', 'bit', 'more', 'range', 'here', 'most', 'previous', 'roles.Hanson', 'populated', 'film', 'number', 'real', 'life', 'poker', 'playing', 'celebrities', 'may', 'be', 'interest', 'aficionados', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'rest', 'Sad', 'say', 'lackluster', 'Lucky', 'unlikely', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'not', 'already', 'passionate', 'professional', 'poker', 'unlikely', 'garner', 'sport', 'many', 'new', 'fans']",N/A
1091697,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000TNLZ0M,Samuel McKewon,"[8, 8]","""Lucky You"" is a tutorial in professional poker. The strategy. The company. And, most importantly for any movie that chooses to invest in its subject - the nature of it. The screenplay - written by Eric Roth and director Curtis Hanson - charts the heartbeat of an addicted gambler, a pulse that mirrors that of a cocaine user: Joyous leaps and races punctuated by moments when the flow of blood almost stops completely.It strips some of the manly sweat away from the craft, too. The movie lacks the histrionics and black drama of, say, ""Rounders,"" in part because ""Rounders"" is a myth, born of the idea men have about the wars of personality going on at a poker table. ""Lucky You"" has its clashes, for sure, and its cliches, too, but they lack blarney and false bravado. Here, poker is risk management. Actuarial work. And it makes sense.Eric Bana turns in a committed performance as Huck Cheever, a Las Vegas poker player - he dabbles in other ridiculous bets of chance, cards, and athletic skill, but is careful never to play ""the house"" - whose attitude might best be likened to golfer Phil Mickelson. Huck fires for the pin on nearly every hand, overshoots the cards, and never seems to get the river when he needs it most. It's not that Huck doesn't see the angles - he chooses to obliterate them. Again and again. That's how he ends up with an empty house whose deed is held by a sports gambler watching seven televisions at once, including Australian basketball.The movie opens with Huck pawning his mother's ring, in an effort to get a $10,000 stake in the World Series of Poker. He'll win it that $10,000, then he'll lose it, win it, lose it. His shifting fortune will involve a lounge singer new to Vegas named  Billie Offer (Drew Barrymore). As her own character, Billie, seemingly nave but oddly full of rectitude, is ill-defined. As a mirror held up to Huck's unshaven face, she would be effective if Barrymore, a sunny, buoyant actor unsuited to the moral compromises of Sin City, weren't playing her. ""Lucky You"" tries on romance but never makes it fit very well.Better are the father/son dynamics between Huck and his father L.C. (Robert Duvall), a revered champion for whom Huck has unmitigated disdain. There are no surprises in their absent chemistry - L.C. was a deadbeat dad, Huck developed into a deadbeat, in general - but their scenes, especially one in a diner over several games of Guts, are fiercely written. Duvall still knows how to massage a monologue with his halting speech patterns; he uses a comic's understanding of a punchline to create a lizard of a man, down his slicked mat of hair plugs. L.C. sees himself as a Picasso of cards, an artist who sense his ""time"" of heightened skills is drawing to a close.Thing is, Huck still has the nose.For what? The mood of a hand. The unspoken momentum of it. The smell of winning and money. ""Lucky You"" has no prideful illusions about poker - if anything, it sticks its talons hard into the idea of ""manning up"" -  but it still injects an air of tension and romance into its many poker hands. However misguided or addictive the behavior might be, most of the players in the movie show a love (or at least a healthy lust) for the craft; only Huck seems bent on something greater than victory. Michael Shannon and Jean Smart are especially effective in smaller as two of Huck's competitors, but the credit can be spread around; using several actors from ""8 Mile,"" director Hanson asks for hunger and mild desperation, and he gets it from them.Hanson's camera is equally nuanced. This is no Vegas glamour pic; we are spared helicopter dollies of The Strip. The candy lights blink in the background of many scenes, but the characters are not enamored or gob smacked by the scene, including Billie. This is a movie of people who live here, and work here, and it is long past excitement. Such honesty about the city - and the willpower to resist it becoming a character of its own - is refreshing.Aside from Billie, the movie's weakness is a nearly endless final act that covers the World Series of Poker, not since Stallone's ""Over The Top"" - I'm semi-serious here - has a movie been so committed to introducing new characters in the final thirty minutes like video game bosses, then placing a miniature story arc on their fortunes. The movie's two twists are easily spotted before they unfold and the ""resolution,"" as it were, seems a little dishonest, if morally tidy.Nevertheless, ""Lucky You"" has a surprising amount of integrity, and Bana delivers a smooth, like-him-loathe-him performance, equal parts intelligence and ego. He only missteps when he has to make eyes at Barrymore. Funny that Roth and Hanson have a romantic angle for commercial appeal, only to have the movie shelved and dumped on the same weekend of the largest opening in film history (""Spider-Man 3"").",3,"Short on romance, long on the intricacies of poker",1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,4847,"['Lucky', 'tutorial', 'professional', 'poker', 'strategy', 'company', 'most', 'importantly', 'movie',

1091698,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B000TNLZ0M,Sebastian Fernandez,"[9, 9]","This is a great time to come out with a movie about poker, since the sport has taken off at supersonic speed with amateurs winning the main event of the World Series in the last few years and people following the action on ESPN. The main problem I see with this movie though is that in an effort to be original it runs into unreal situations like a misdeal followed by a huge bad beat, or a close call to end a contrived bet.The plot is fairly typical, a poker pro, Huck Cleever, trying to make it to the World Series of poker and win the main event. In the process, he meets a girl that shakes his world and makes him rethink his priorities. The added complication is that he is the son of a two-time winner of the event, and the son-father relationship has been in tatters for a long time. During his quest, Huck experiences huge swings in his luck, and this provides an enlightening view of what the life of a professional gambler can be like.The acting is not particularly inspired, with the exception of Robert Duvall, who plays L.C. Cheever, the father of the protagonist. Duvall infuses his character with the external toughness and inner conflicts that the role requires and is therefore extremely successful in the process. There is a wide array of poker pros taking part in this movie, but most of them have silent roles, the exceptions are Sammy Farha and Jason Lester, who have a couple of lines each. The list of celebrities includes among others Phil Helmut, Daniel Negreanu, Johnny Chan and Doyle Brunson. I did not really understand why a couple of pros play characters with different names, like Jennifer Harman, who plays Shannon Kincaid, or John Hennigan as Ralph Kaczynski.Overall, I think that the idea of the movie was good, but the execution was deficient and the overall quality suffered as a result. For a long time to come, poker movies are going to be evaluated in terms of how they compare toRounders, and in that sense, this one comes up short. Poker players will probably get some enjoyment from this production, but they should not expect much.",3,"""Must be tough playing in the shadow of your father""",1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,2075,"['great', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'movie', 'poker', 'sport', 'taken', 'off', 'supersonic', 'speed', 'amateurs', 'winning', 'main', 'event', 'World', 'Series', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'people', 'following', 'action', 'ESPN', 'main', 'problem', 'see', 'movie', 'though', 'effort', 'be', 'original', 'unreal', 'situations', 'misdeal', 'followed', 'huge', 'bad', 'beat', 'close', 'call', 'end', 'contrived', 'bet.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'typical', 'poker', 'pro', 'Huck', 'Cleever', 'trying', 'make', 'World', 'Series', 'poker', 'win', 'main', 'event', 'process', 'girl', 'world', 'rethink', 'priorities', 'added', 'complication', 'son', 'two-time', 'winner', 'event', 'son-father', 'relationship', 'been', 'tatters', 'long', 'time', 'quest', 'Huck', 'huge', 'swings', 'luck', 'enlightening', 'view', 'what', 'life', 'professional', 'gambler', 'can', 'be', 'like.The', 'acting', 'not', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'exception', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'L.C', 'Cheever', 'father', 'protagonist', 'Duvall', 'character', 'external', 'toughness', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'role', 'therefore', 'extremely', 'successful', 'process', 'wide', 'array', 'poker', 'pros', 'taking', 'part', 'movie', 'most', 'have', 'silent', 'roles', 'exceptions', 'are', 'Sammy', 'Farha', 'Jason', 'Lester', 'who', 'have', 'couple', 'lines', 'list', 'celebrities', 'others', 'Phil', 'Helmut', 'Daniel', 'Negreanu', 'Johnny', 'Chan', 'Doyle', 'Brunson', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'couple', 'pros', 'play', 'characters', 'different', 'names', 'Jennifer', 'Harman', 'who', 'Shannon', 'Kincaid', 'John', 'Hennigan', 'Ralph', 'Kaczynski.Overall', 'think', 'idea', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'execution', 'was', 'deficient', 'overall', 'quality', 'suffered', 'result', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'poker', 'movies', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'evaluated', 'terms', 'how', 'compare', 'toRounders', 'sense', 'one', 'up', 'short', 'Poker', 'players', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'production', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'much']",N/A
