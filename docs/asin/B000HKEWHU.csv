1015106,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B000HKEWHU,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[6, 7]","[BLACK MOON - 1975 - Directed by Louis Malle - Widescreen] Black Moon is a non-narrative Freudian tale of adolescent sexuality (?) apparently set in a postapocalyptic world of men against women, shifting identities and talking animals that make more sense than their human counterparts. It is Malle's most experimental film and an irritating cinematic daydream like no other. Is this a good thing? I don't believe so. He's treading on Luis Bunuel's turf, but clearly is in over his head. Even his interview in the bonus features shows how uncomfortable he is discussing the film, refusing to elucidate on elements that border on incomprehensible within the film, never making eye contact with the camera, his posture and body language as defensive as someone in a police video interrogation we are soon to find guilty of a crime.As someone who has seen almost every Malle film and is a professed fan, I was excited about seeing this one, but midstream, I realized I was in for a huge letdown, and by the film's end, I was flabbergasted seeing the final scene approaching, the outcome of which would leave me perplexed, pissed, and feeling cinematically cheated by a good friend. There's more to be said about this film and the director's effort, but I simply cannot bring myself to care enough to do so - it might only succeed in making you want to see this flick and, unless you're a completist or a cinema sadist, what's the point? It seems most directors hit a wall at some point during the 70's for a variety of reasons we don't have time to delve into here. What could have been Lewis Carroll by way of Luis Bunuel as seen through the eyes of Louis Malle ends up a non-narrative mess that's not even character driven with little plot, no development or back-story, no emotional content and no ending. Sure, as arthouse junkies we can ruminate on this or that to make believe that there's something deeper there when in fact there probably isn't, so let's call it a day and declare it for what it probably is - Malle's most disappointing work, but one that pushed him into another chapter in his dynamic career during the 80's and beyond. So maybe we have this morsel of manna to be grateful for, in spite of the overarching 'Black Moon' that hangs above us when we indulge in this convoluted overindulgence. All great artists falter from time to time... but that doesn't diminish their greatness if they can rekindle the fire that made them memorable in the first place.",3,'Certainly Not A Full Moon...,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,2475,"['[', 'BLACK', 'MOON', '1975', 'Directed', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'Widescreen', ']', 'Black', 'Moon', 'non-narrative', 'Freudian', 'tale', 'adolescent', 'sexuality', 'apparently', 'set', 'postapocalyptic', 'world', 'men', 'women', 'shifting', 'identities', 'talking', 'animals', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'human', 'counterparts', 'Malle', 'most', 'experimental', 'film', 'irritating', 'cinematic', 'daydream', 'other', 'good', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'so', 'treading', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'turf', 'clearly', 'head', 'Even', 'interview', 'bonus', 'how', 'uncomfortable', 'discussing', 'film', 'refusing', 'elucidate', 'elements', 'border', 'incomprehensible', 'film', 'never', 'making', 'eye', 'contact', 'camera', 'posture', 'body', 'language', 'as', 'defensive', 'someone', 'police', 'video', 'interrogation', 'are', 'soon', 'find', 'guilty', 'crime.As', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'almost', 'Malle', 'film', 'professed', 'fan', 'was', 'excited', 'seeing', 'one', 'midstream', 'realized', 'was', 'huge', 'letdown', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'flabbergasted', 'seeing', 'final', 'scene', 'approaching', 'outcome', 'would', 'leave', 'perplexed', 'pissed', 'feeling', 'cinematically', 'cheated', 'good', 'friend', 'more', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'director', 'effort', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'care', 'enough', 'do', 'so', 'might', 'only', 'succeed', 'making', 'want', 'see', 'flick', ""'re"", 'completist', 'cinema', 'sadist', 'what', 'point', 'most', 'directors', 'hit', 'wall', 'point', '70', 'variety', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'delve', 'here', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'way', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'up', 'non-narrative', 'mess', 'not', 'even', 'character', 'driven', 'little', 'plot', 'development', 'back-story', 'emotional', 'content', 'ending', 'Sure', 'arthouse', 'junkies', 'can', 'ruminate', 'make', 'believe', 'something', 'deeper', 'there', 'when', 'fact', 'probably', ""n't"", 'let', 'call', 'day', 'declare', 'what', 'probably', 'Malle', 'most', 'disappointing', 'work', 'one', 'pushed', 'chapter', 'dynamic', 'career', '80', 'So', 'maybe', 'have', 'morsel', 'manna', 'be', 'grateful', 'spite', 'overarching', ""'Black"", 'Moon', 'hangs', 'when', 'indulge', 'convoluted', 'overindulgence', 'great', 'artists', 'falter', 'time', 'time', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'greatness', 'can', 'rekindle', 'fire', 'made', 'memorable', 'first', 'place']",Black Moon [Region 4]

This is definitely one of those.  I always appreciate the come-on wording and ""not rated"" listing for whether or not the film has violence, language, nudity, or suggestive situations.  This film, ""Black Moon: The Criterion Collection"" lists as its main star an actress (typically a signal flare for skin), and has the word ""evocatively"" in the description.  Let me be frank.  There are parts of this film that are absolutely repelling to any sane, moral human being, there are parts that are uniquely entertaining (few and far between), and start to finish you never understand a single thing.  It was filmed using French as the language, dubbed in English, and yet difficult to hear what little is spoken so I activated the English subtitles (use ""on"") and what little intelligible English you CAN decipher audibly doesn't match the English subtitles.  The farmhouse itself is intriguing, and so I watched the extra features included interview with the film maker himself, who says ultimately that he doesn't need to explain what he was trying to say in the making of this film.  Myself having over 140 college credit hours, I consider myself somewhat educated; however I am not a connoisseur of the surreal, or even necessarily of foreign films.  I bought and viewed this film because I wanted something different.  I definitely got something different.  I cannot recommend this film and try as I might, barely was able to admit having viewed it.  Beware the association of Alice down the rabbit hole, because it is the viewer who ends up in Wonderland.  I can't imagine giving this movie a five star rating if you live anywhere in America; yet if you live in any part of France, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Australia, or especially some third world country ravaged by war and confusion as day-to-day life becomes a struggle against all odds, then this film might have more of a message.

And I wrote inThe Allure of Nymphetsthat the only thing that a man likes more than a nymphet are two nymphets.However, a number of straight men have a preference for a genre of adult films that features teens with middle-aged women. The popularity of the genre may be due to the fact that the contrast in ages highlights the age of the younger women. The contrast appears to make the teens look even younger i.e., more attractive.Black Moon (1975) is a fantasy film that was written and directed by Louis Malle. (The French born filmmaker directed the very controversial Pretty Baby (1978) as well.) In Black Moon, among other strange occurrences, 15-year-old cleavage revealing Lily Cathryn Harrison) chases a talking unicorn around the grounds of a 200-year-old manor house in France. (The house belongs to Malle.)When Malle was asked to describe Black Moon he said, ""I don't know how to describe Black Moon because it's a strange melange - if you want, it's a mythological fairy-tale [&agrave; la Alice in Wonderland]  taking place in the near future.""What is clear in the film is that Malle knows how to take advantage of the allure of a nymphet. Malle teases the viewer with Lisa's cleavage for over an hour before he has the nymphet unbutton the few remaining buttons of her white cotton shirt, wipe her ""chest"" clean with a dampened cotton ball, and consolingly ""breastfeeds"" the Old Lady (Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Giehse). Unsurprisingly, Black Moon was the winner of two French C&eacute;sar Awards.Note: The age of consent in France is 15 and since Cathryn Harrison's topless scene was shown in a non-sexual context, it was legal based on secular law.
