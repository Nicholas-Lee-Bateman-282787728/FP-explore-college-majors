Saw this two in one....had never seen Wicker Park before so decided to give it a go.  Still loving Stigmata...excellent movie....so far I have started to watch Wicker Park twice but cant make it past the beginning...it has not grabbed my attention enough to stick with it.  I know other reviewers have said they loved Wicker Park....but I cant seem to get into it.....Stigmata is worth buying this for though so I am not disapointed.,4,Bought this for Stigmata,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,498,"['old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Stigmata', 'was', 'failing', 'so', 'had', 'replace', 'Saw', 'two', 'one', '.had', 'never', 'seen', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'so', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'Still', 'loving', 'Stigmata', 'excellent', 'movie', '.so', 'far', 'have', 'started', 'watch', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'twice', 'cant', 'make', 'beginning', 'not', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'enough', 'stick', 'know', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'loved', 'Wicker', 'Park', '.but', 'cant', 'seem', 'get', '..Stigmata', 'worth', 'buying', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'disapointed']",N/A

I did not realize that it was Patricia Arquette.  When it came up for a dvd purchase I had to have it.  She is such a great actress.  She has such a range of talent that I have not seen in a long time.  She can just be someone else and then quickly turn into another character and the change is spectacular to watch.,4,Entertaining.,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,440,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'saw', 'movie', 'Stigmata', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'theatre', 'was', 'entranced', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'When', 'came', 'up', 'dvd', 'purchase', 'had', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'range', 'talent', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'just', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'then', 'quickly', 'turn', 'character', 'change', 'spectacular', 'watch']",N/A
