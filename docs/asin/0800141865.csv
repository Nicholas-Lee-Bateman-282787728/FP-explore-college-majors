This movie has all three.  If you haven't seen it, little warning, it has graphic (and some may even say tasteless) images but they are what makes the film.  It is based on true accounts which makes it even better.  Woody Harrelson does a fantastic job playing the founder of Hustler Magazine.  It is a far cry from his character on Cheers haha.

165463,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0800141865,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 1]","I love movies based on true stories. I also love documentaries, but that's quite another thing. To me, part of the pleasure of true story movies is how close to my idea of the characters the movie makers have come. I think Flynt is pretty fairly represented here.Flynt (Woody Harrelson) originally owned a little club somewhere in the south (sorry I don't remember where) called the Hustler. I don't think it referred to a pool shark. It wasn't making much money, so he decided to advertise it by producing a ""newsletter"" which was primarily photos of the dancers who worked there. It was the printer who suggested that he add some written words to avoid having it labeled porno.Larry also married one of his dancers, Althea (Courtney Love). I don't recall right now when they married, but they had lived together for some time first.To make a long story short, after Flynt bought a paparazzi's photo of Jackie Onassis in the nude, his circulation soared and he had a real money-maker. But he was busted for selling pornography, so once he got out of that mess he decided that he needed to move to somewhere that respected perverts. He moved to Los Angeles, of course.He was indeed busted at least once more for pornography, and then held in contempt of court for refusing to disclose his source for an FBI sting tape. His attorney, Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton), was smart and did his best, but he didn't always win over Flynt being outrageous in court.Flynt and Isaacman were leaving a courthouse when a sniper (who was never identified) shot them both. Isaacman recovered, but Larry was paralyzed from the waist down, and in pretty horrible pain. He was prescribed strong pain killers, and Althea was taught how to administer them. It wasn't long before she was taking them too. Then Flynt had surgery, which ended the pain for him (although he was still paralyzed), and he no longer needed the drugs. But Althea did: she'd become addicted to them. This is consistent with expert opinion and my own experience that you do not get addicted for taking painkillers so long as you have real pain. It is when you take them to get high that addiction is a risk. Larry told Althea that he was going cold turkey after his surgery, and she was, too.It was never explained why that failed for her, and she remained a junkie. So later, when she . . . no, I don't want to get into all that, or you won't even bother watching the movie.Two significant events other than the shooting are depicted in the film, and the consequences for Flynt are depicted. First, Ruth Carter Stapleton (Donna Hanover) invited him to dinner and convinced him to be born again and baptized. Full dunking in a river. But he did not stop publishing Hustler: he did change its tone considerably. He went at least a little crazy trying to be a good Christian and the publisher of Hustler, but after he was shot, he declared that there was no god. Since Althea had hated his conversion in the first place, she was OK with that.As part of his (and Hustler's) return to hedonistic paganism and atheism, Flynt designed a satirical fake liquor ad featuring Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul), and Falwell sued, of course. Flynt counter-sued because Falwell had copied the fake ad and distributed it with a fund-raiser in violation of Flynt's copyright. This is the case that eventually went all the way to the Supreme Court. Do I have to tell you what the verdict was?",4,Censorship Doesn't Stop Larry,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,3422,"['love', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'also', 'love', 'documentaries', 'quite', 'thing', 'part', 'pleasure', 'true', 'story', 'movies', 'how', 'close', 'idea', 'characters', 'movie', 'makers', 'have', 'come', 'think', 'Flynt', 'pretty', 'fairly', 'represented', 'here.Flynt', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'originally', 'owned', 'little', 'club', 'somewhere', 'south', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'called', 'Hustler', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'referred', 'pool', 'shark', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'much', 'money', 'decided', 'advertise', 'producing', 'newsletter', 'was', 'primarily', 'photos', 'dancers', 'who', 'worked', 'there', 'was', 'printer', 'who', 'suggested', 'add', 'written', 'words', 'avoid', 'having', 'labeled', 'porno.Larry', 'also', 'married', 'one', 'dancers', 'Althea', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'right', 'now', 'when', 'married', 'had', 'lived', 'together', 'time', 'first.To', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Flynt', 'bought', 'paparazzi', 'photo', 'Jackie', 'Onassis', 'nude', 'circulation', 'soared', 'had', 'real', 'money-maker', 'was', 'busted', 'selling', 'pornography', 'so', 'once', 'got', 'out', 'mess', 'decided', 'needed', 'move', 'somewhere', 'respected', 'perverts', 'moved', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'course.He', 'was', 'indeed', 'busted', 'least', 'once', 'more', 'pornography', 'then', 'held', 'contempt', 'court', 'refusing', 'disclose', 'source', 'FBI', 'sting', 'tape', 'attorney', 'Alan', 'Isaacman', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'was', 'smart', 'did', 'best', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'win', 'over', 'Flynt', 'being', 'outrageous', 'court.Flynt', 'Isaacman', 'were', 'leaving', 'courthouse', 'when', 'sniper', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'identified', 'shot', 'Isaacman', 'recovered', 'Larry', 'was', 'paralyzed', 'waist', 'down', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'pain', 'was', 'prescribed', 'strong', 'pain', 'killers', 'Althea', 'was', 'taught', 'how', 'administer', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'was', 'taking', 'too', 'Then', 'Flynt', 'had', 'surgery', 'ended', 'pain', 'was', 'still', 'paralyzed', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'drugs', 'Althea', 'did', ""'d"", 'become', 'addicted', 'consistent', 'expert', 'opinion', 'own', 'experience', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'addicted', 'taking', 'painkillers', 'so', 'long', 'have', 'real', 'pain', 'when', 'take', 'get', 'high', 'addiction', 'risk', 'Larry', 'told', 'Althea', 'was', 'going', 'cold', 'turkey', 'surgery', 'was', 'too.It', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'failed', 'remained', 'junkie', 'So', 'later', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'watching', 'movie.Two', 'significant', 'events', 'other', 'shooting', 'are', 'depicted', 'film', 'consequences', 'Flynt', 'are', 'depicted', 'First', 'Ruth', 'Carter', 'Stapleton', 'Donna', 'Hanover', 'invited', 'dinner', 'convinced', 'be', 'born', 'again', 'baptized', 'Full', 'dunking', 'river', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'publishing', 'Hustler', 'did', 'change', 'tone', 'considerably', 'went', 'least', 'little', 'crazy', 'trying', 'be', 'good', 'Christian', 'publisher', 'Hustler', 'was', 'shot', 'declared', 'was', 'god', 'Althea', 'had', 'hated', 'conversion', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'OK', 'that.As', 'part', 'Hustler', 'return', 'hedonistic', 'paganism', 'atheism', 'Flynt', 'designed', 'satirical', 'fake', 'liquor', 'ad', 'featuring', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'Richard', 'Paul', 'Falwell', 'sued', 'course', 'Flynt', 'counter-sued', 'Falwell', 'had', 'copied', 'fake', 'ad', 'distributed', 'fund-raiser', 'violation', 'Flynt', 'copyright', 'case', 'eventually', 'went', 'way', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Do', 'have', 'tell', 'what', 'verdict', 'was']",N/A

165466,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,0800141865,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[6, 7]","I didn't know too much about the man that was Larry Flynt before the other night.  I new he was the man behind 'Hustler' but that was about it.  Watching this surprisingly tastfully done biopic on the man opened my eyes to what he stood for.  Pulling himself out of nothing, Larry Flynt (Woody Harrelson) stood up for the rights of every American when he fought for the publication of his magazine.  Starting out the owner of an exotic dance club but looking for more he started a newsletter advertising his 'girls', but after his little side project took off running it was apparent where his big break was going to fall.  The film follows Flynt throughout his life, from his marriage to dancer Althea (Courtney Love) who is just as excited about his magazine as he is, to his arrest's and constant battles with the court over the right to publish 'smut' as they called it.His legal battles are really where the meat of this film lies for is really shows the hypocrisy of the legal system.  They were forcing opinions on citizens instead of inforcing law.  There was no law against the publication of porn, but it went against what many people belived to be good morals.  As Flynt so noted, he was guilty of nothing but bad taste.As the film progresses we see the aftermath of a shooting gone wrong, a man obviously upset over the magazine shot Larry outside of the courthouse paralizing him from the waist down.  This has to of course be a terrible blow to a man obsessed with sex.  Just before the shooting Larry was starting to turn over a new leaf after being converted the Christianity.  He was trying to turn his magazine around (even though he ended up making it worse) but after the shooting he swore off god altogether and became athiest.  Through the course of the next three years he and his wife became addicted to pain killers and his wife ended up suffering the fatal price when she was diagnosed with AIDS.  The film shows beautifully, as well as heartbreakingly, Larry's devotion to his ailing wife and there illicit love affair that was in all sense of the word genuine.The film helps show the triumph of the everyman as he battles for the freedoms we all enjoy and is relentless in doing so.  He's not doing this for the money or the fame but to prove that we all want the same thing.  It doesn't matter whether we agree with what this man did or what he promoted, for theres not one of us who doesn't enjoy the freedom we have in this country, and all Larry Flynt wanted was the right to enjoy that freedom as well.  What this film proved, and better yet what Larry's life proved, is that once you start taking away the freedoms of one person based on our own viewpoints we start to limit ourselves and everyone around us.  If we started punishing those who didn't think like us the world would be a much colder place.Now what needs to be mentioned, and what makes a film like this so great, is the brilliant acting on the part of the entire cast, from Harrelson's brilliant take on Larry Flynt to Edward Norton's turn as his cautious lawyer.  I wholeheartedly agree that Woody should have won the Oscar for this, for there is no one else that could have pulled this off the way he did.  Courtney Love is another cast memeber who deserves heeps of praise for her scene stealing performance as Larry's bisexual, drug addict wife.  Her performance blew me away with her commiment and dedication to her role.  She was the def. of commanding and stole every scene out from under Woody's feet.  I believe Courtney to be a huge star, and if she would only harness that drive she showed in this film then she could be much further then she is now.  As a whole, in everyway, this is a great film that is about so much more than 'porn' but about growth and the fight for the American dream!",5,"""I turned the whole world into a tabloid.""",1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,3801,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'man', 'was', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'other', 'night', 'new', 'was', 'man', ""'Hustler"", 'was', 'Watching', 'surprisingly', 'tastfully', 'done', 'biopic', 'man', 'opened', 'eyes', 'what', 'stood', 'Pulling', 'nothing', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'stood', 'up', 'rights', 'American', 'when', 'fought', 'publication', 'magazine', 'Starting', 'out', 'owner', 'exotic', 'dance', 'club', 'looking', 'more', 'started', 'newsletter', 'advertising', ""'girls"", 'little', 'side', 'project', 'took', 'off', 'running', 'was', 'apparent', 'where', 'big', 'break', 'was', 'going', 'fall', 'film', 'Flynt', 'life', 'marriage', 'dancer', 'Althea', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'excited', 'magazine', 'arrest', 'constant', 'battles', 'court', 'right', 'publish', ""'smut"", 'called', 'it.His', 'legal', 'battles', 'are', 'really', 'where', 'meat', 'film', 'really', 'hypocrisy', 'legal', 'system', 'were', 'forcing', 'opinions', 'citizens', 'instead', 'inforcing', 'law', 'was', 'law', 'publication', 'porn', 'went', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'belived', 'be', 'good', 'morals', 'Flynt', 'so', 'noted', 'was', 'guilty', 'nothing', 'bad', 'film', 'see', 'aftermath', 'shooting', 'gone', 'wrong', 'man', 'obviously', 'upset', 'magazine', 'shot', 'Larry', 'courthouse', 'paralizing', 'waist', 'down', 'course', 'be', 'terrible', 'blow', 'man', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'Just', 'shooting', 'Larry', 'was', 'starting', 'turn', 'over', 'new', 'leaf', 'being', 'converted', 'Christianity', 'was', 'trying', 'turn', 'magazine', 'even', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'worse', 'shooting', 'swore', 'off', 'god', 'altogether', 'became', 'athiest', 'course', 'next', 'three', 'years', 'wife', 'became', 'addicted', 'pain', 'killers', 'wife', 'ended', 'up', 'suffering', 'fatal', 'price', 'when', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'AIDS', 'film', 'beautifully', 'as', 'well', 'heartbreakingly', 'Larry', 'devotion', 'ailing', 'wife', 'illicit', 'love', 'affair', 'was', 'sense', 'word', 'genuine.The', 'film', 'show', 'triumph', 'everyman', 'freedoms', 'enjoy', 'relentless', 'doing', 'so', 'not', 'doing', 'money', 'fame', 'prove', 'want', 'same', 'thing', ""n't"", 'matter', 'agree', 'what', 'man', 'did', 'what', 'promoted', 'theres', 'not', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'freedom', 'have', 'country', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'wanted', 'was', 'right', 'enjoy', 'freedom', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'film', 'proved', 'better', 'yet', 'what', 'Larry', 'life', 'proved', 'once', 'start', 'taking', 'away', 'freedoms', 'one', 'person', 'based', 'own', 'viewpoints', 'start', 'limit', 'ourselves', 'everyone', 'started', 'punishing', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'colder', 'place.Now', 'what', 'be', 'mentioned', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'part', 'entire', 'cast', 'Harrelson', 'brilliant', 'take', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'turn', 'cautious', 'lawyer', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'Woody', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'way', 'did', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'cast', 'memeber', 'who', 'heeps', 'praise', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'Larry', 'bisexual', 'drug', 'addict', 'wife', 'performance', 'blew', 'away', 'commiment', 'dedication', 'role', 'was', 'def', 'commanding', 'stole', 'scene', 'Woody', 'feet', 'believe', 'Courtney', 'be', 'huge', 'star', 'would', 'only', 'harness', 'drive', 'showed', 'film', 'then', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'further', 'then', 'now', 'whole', 'everyway', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""'porn"", 'growth', 'fight', 'American', 'dream']",N/A
165467,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,0800141865,David Anderson,"[7, 8]","""The People Vs. Larry Flint"" is one of the most controversial releases of 1996, starring Woody Harrelson, Edward Norton, and Courtney Love.  It earned two Oscar nominations and two Golden Globe wins.  This real-life film wonderfully desplicts Larry Flint's struggle to publish ""Hustler"", a sexually explicit magazine.  He risks his freedom to prove that the bans violate the First Amendment on the US Bill of Rights, which is freedom of speech.  Through every step, he causes tremendous controversy throughout the country.  Some love him, some hate him.  Either way, nobody can get enough of him.  The plot is brilliant.  The daring material expressed deserves tremendous respect for doing what few writers have dared.  The climatic story keeps audiences interested in every scene, always wondering what Flint will say or do next.  The unexpected events keep the energy intact.  His eccentric behavior adds a more interesting flavor to the film.Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love prove that they were made for their roles.  Harrelson's Oscar nominated performance as Larry Flint is the best in his career.  Nobody else could have played Flint better.  Love makes a triumphant film debut in her Golden Globe nominated role as Athena, Flint's wife.  Her erratic behavior is wonderfully displayed through every scene.  Athena's life struggles are beautifully expressed.  Edward Norton's role as Flint's lawyer is beautifully performed.  All other performers also acted their roles wonderfully.""The People Vs.

165468,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,0800141865,D. Blankenship,"[1, 1]","I've actually watched this movie twice now and enjoyed it the second time as much as I did the first.  This is sort of strange because before the first viewing I came fully prepared not to like this movie.  I had of course heard about it and of course knew something of the subject matter having followed the Flynt odyssey through the press as it unfolded over the years.  To begin with, two of the primary characters being portrayed in this movie, i.e. Larry Flint and Jerry Falwell are right at the top of my list of guys I would be least likely to hang-out with in real life.  To be quite frank, I am not an admirer of either...and that is putting it mildly.Well I was wrong.  This is actually a very good movie with some of the best acting I have seen in quite some time.  Woody Harralson's portrayal of Flint is rather amazing and I feel a good argument could be made that it is Harralson's best so far in his rather strange career.  I am normally not a big fan of Woody's, but I have to tell you that he won me over in this one.  Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife and turns in a performance that will absolutely haunt you.  The chemistry between Harralson and Love simply leaps from the screen.  Both have their part nailed perfectly.Now in many ways this is not an easy film to watch.  Potential viewers should be warned that there are quite a number of rather raw and graphic sex scenes in this one and that there is some rather harsh language.  I suppose this was necessary when you consider the subject matter.  This is not really an objection on my part, only a warning.  Also, many people consider Larry Flint a truly despicable person.  I cannot say that my opinion of him is all that high but I do have to admire him for standing up for all of us and taking his lumps like a man in his battle over free speech.  Rather than focus on my feelings for both Flint and indeed, Falwell, I focused on the movie and found it to be well made, entertaining, in a rather perverse way, and most certainly unforgettable.The acting alone in this one, including all of the supporting cast, is some of the best I have seen in any movie is quite some time.

165469,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0800141865,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 6]","Strange bedfellows, those two, Jerry Falwell and Larry Flynt.  I never liked either one of them, which is why it has taken me so long to get  around to watching this movie.  Make no mistake about it, the central point  here is that Falwell and Flynt are two sides of the same coin: pick your  pig.Milos Forman's direction starts slow and is almost without  distinction nearly three-quarters through, yet the entire movie is saved by  that last quarter after Flynt is shot.  I think there is something to be  said for boring your audience a little in the beginning, showing them only  the tired and ordinary just so they will better appreciate it when the  going gets good.  And it does.  I think this strategy worked on me: after  rot gut even vin ordinaire can seem like the ambrosia of the  gods.Turning Larry Flynt into an American hero, as this movie does, may  seem a bit of a stretch, yet consider the obverse: Jerry Falwell as our  hero.  Now THAT is a bit scary.Courtney Love proves herself to be a  wonderful exhibitionist (but we knew that) as well as a natural and  talented actress (we didn't know that) who knows how to have a good time in  front of the camera; and I think that is half the task for an actor: love  the red light; love the audience looking at you.  Woody Harrelson, in  keeping with Foreman's direction seems to be walking through the part in  the beginning, looking almost like a clone of himself from Natural Born  Killers (1994) with a fey hair style; but he picks up steam, and as the  paralyzed Flynt really comes to life and gives a fine performance.  Ed  Norton is also excellent and so believable and winning as Flynt's lawyer,  especially in the scene before the Supreme Court.  Think about it: in this  movie the lawyer is the good guy!Politically speaking this is a no  brainer, a shoot the fish in the barrel exercise: First Amendment wins out  over public figures wanting to manage their images.  Thank you.  And what  IS more obscene, sex or war?  Strange that that should be a question, but  it is and has been for at least a couple of millennia.  When I was young I  used to wonder why.  Wasn't it obvious that sex was good and war was bad?  However, it is not so simple.  It turns out that sex (which leads to the  creation of  new karmas) is really just the obverse side of the coin of  war.  You make `em, in some circumstances, you have to kill `em. That's why  the other guy's sexuality is offensive, and why we have prudes.  Sex really  is war by other means.  I always think of the example of Easter Island  where initially they practiced a fertility religion until the island's  protein resources ran out, and then came the repression of reproduction and  sex.  Christianity is a religion one step removed from the old fertility  religions in this sense.  It is paranoid (in its more conservative forms)  about sexuality because it has evolved to fear unbridled reproduction.  Of  course its practitioners, like Jerry Falwell, have no understanding of  this: they are just social and political animals acting out their social  and political roles.In short, like most things in life, this film is a  flawed but interesting venture.  Incidentally, the so-called ""unusual""  marriage between Flynt and Althea Leasure is one of the things that makes  this movie good: their marriage is a lot more like real life than ninety  percent of what we see in the movies.",4,Ugly but worth the viewing,966038400,"08 12, 2000",2000,3411,"['Strange', 'bedfellows', 'two', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'never', 'liked', 'one', 'why', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'watching', 'movie', 'Make', 'mistake', 'central', 'point', 'here', 'Falwell', 'Flynt', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'pick', 'pig.Milos', 'Forman', 'direction', 'slow', 'almost', 'distinction', 'nearly', 'three-quarters', 'entire', 'movie', 'saved', 'last', 'quarter', 'Flynt', 'shot', 'think', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'boring', 'audience', 'little', 'beginning', 'showing', 'only', 'tired', 'ordinary', 'just', 'will', 'better', 'appreciate', 'when', 'going', 'good', 'think', 'strategy', 'worked', 'rot', 'gut', 'even', 'vin', 'ordinaire', 'can', 'seem', 'ambrosia', 'gods.Turning', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'American', 'hero', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'stretch', 'yet', 'consider', 'obverse', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'hero', 'Now', 'THAT', 'bit', 'scary.Courtney', 'Love', 'be', 'wonderful', 'exhibitionist', 'knew', 'as', 'well', 'natural', 'talented', 'actress', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'how', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'front', 'camera', 'think', 'task', 'actor', 'love', 'red', 'light', 'love', 'audience', 'looking', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'keeping', 'Foreman', 'direction', 'be', 'walking', 'part', 'beginning', 'looking', 'almost', 'clone', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', '1994', 'fey', 'hair', 'style', 'up', 'steam', 'paralyzed', 'Flynt', 'really', 'life', 'fine', 'performance', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'also', 'excellent', 'so', 'believable', 'winning', 'Flynt', 'lawyer', 'especially', 'scene', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Think', 'movie', 'lawyer', 'good', 'guy', 'Politically', 'speaking', 'brainer', 'shoot', 'fish', 'barrel', 'exercise', 'First', 'Amendment', 'out', 'public', 'figures', 'wanting', 'manage', 'images', 'Thank', 'what', 'IS', 'more', 'obscene', 'sex', 'war', 'Strange', 'should', 'be', 'question', 'been', 'least', 'couple', 'millennia', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'used', 'wonder', 'why', 'Was', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'sex', 'was', 'good', 'war', 'was', 'bad', 'However', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'out', 'sex', 'creation', 'new', 'karmas', 'really', 'just', 'obverse', 'side', 'coin', 'war', 'make', 'em', 'circumstances', 'have', 'kill', 'em', 'why', 'other', 'guy', 'sexuality', 'offensive', 'why', 'have', 'prudes', 'Sex', 'really', 'war', 'other', 'means', 'always', 'think', 'example', 'Easter', 'Island', 'where', 'initially', 'practiced', 'fertility', 'religion', 'island', 'protein', 'resources', 'ran', 'out', 'then', 'came', 'repression', 'reproduction', 'sex', 'Christianity', 'religion', 'one', 'step', 'removed', 'old', 'fertility', 'religions', 'sense', 'paranoid', 'more', 'conservative', 'forms', 'sexuality', 'evolved', 'fear', 'unbridled', 'reproduction', 'course', 'practitioners', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'have', 'understanding', 'are', 'just', 'social', 'political', 'animals', 'acting', 'out', 'social', 'political', 'roles.In', 'short', 'most', 'things', 'life', 'film', 'flawed', 'interesting', 'venture', 'Incidentally', 'so-called', 'unusual', 'marriage', 'Flynt', 'Althea', 'Leasure', 'one', 'things', 'movie', 'good', 'marriage', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'life', 'ninety', 'percent', 'what', 'see', 'movies']",N/A

Ed Norton is also excellent (as usual) as Flynt's busy and much beleaguered lawyer. I have more doubts about the performance of Courtney Love because she has not done enough other acting to compare her performance to. Many people would argue that this performance was not much of a stretch from her everyday life perhaps (not that anyone of us would know). Many would say this was her acting out how her life might have been had she continued spiraling into heroin addiction. But none of this speculation is fair. Her performance within the context of the film was perfect for what the film needed. She played the wife of Flynt, Althea, with convincing and reckless abandon, and her decline and eventual demise is also well played.The story, well, the story of Flynt is well known, and the film will tell the tale once more if curious.

That would have been true even before I watched this film, not because of any regard I have for Flynt or for Hustler magazine but because of my contempt for Jerry Falwell, for his extremism and bigotry, and for his involvement with Charles Keating. Perhaps I should recuse myself, therefore, from reviewing this film, since I couldn't possibly react impartially to the evidence in the trial of Flynt for libel and the subsequent appeals processes that took Flynt and Falwell to the US Supreme Court.As portrayed by actor Woody Harrelson, porn-publisher Larry Flynt wasn't a guy you'd want for a son-in-law. He was loud, crude, sleazy, narcissistic, sociopathic, greedy, and a bully. Harrelson makes him terrifyingly real; I'm sure if I met the real Flynt, i'd be perplexed and wonder why he didn't look like Woody. There's a lot of very skillful acting in this film, and brilliant directing by Czech-American Milos Forman, whose previous films had included: Loves of a Blonde, The Firemen's Ball, Taking Off, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Hair, and Amadeus. Honestly, I would never have watched ""The People vs Larry Flynt"" if it were not for my respect for Milos Forman as a director.But I have to confess that the first fifteen or twenty minutes of this film left me skeptical. Flynt is obnoxious, the sleaze shots are nauseating, the whole scenario seems pointless ... until the ""good people"" of Ohio, people including Charles Keating, resolve to make a martyr of Flynt. And then the film becomes increasingly powerful even while Flynt himself becomes increasingly unpalatable. It is a film about civil liberties, about freedom of expression, about the right of any individual to resist the oppressive of any self-proclaimed ""Moral Majority"". Actor Edward Norton delivers some ripping good rhetoric in favor of freedom-of-conscience in his portrayal of Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacson, in front of the Supreme Court. Flynt's personal life may be seen as a tragedy with laughable elements -- he does get shot and paralyzed, his wife does become a junkie and an AIDS victim, and he does become mentally unsettled -- but the film is has a triumphant happy ending.",5,"If I Had to Choose One of Them, Flynt or Falwell ...",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2252,"['be', 'elected', 'Censor', 'New', 'Roman', 'Republic', 'America', 'Flynt', 'would', 'get', 'nod', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'even', 'watched', 'film', 'not', 'regard', 'have', 'Flynt', 'Hustler', 'magazine', 'contempt', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'extremism', 'bigotry', 'involvement', 'Charles', 'Keating', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'recuse', 'therefore', 'reviewing', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'react', 'impartially', 'evidence', 'trial', 'Flynt', 'libel', 'subsequent', 'appeals', 'took', 'Flynt', 'Falwell', 'US', 'Supreme', 'Court.As', 'portrayed', 'actor', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'porn-publisher', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'was', ""n't"", 'guy', ""'d"", 'want', 'son-in-law', 'was', 'loud', 'crude', 'sleazy', 'narcissistic', 'sociopathic', 'greedy', 'bully', 'Harrelson', 'terrifyingly', 'real', ""'m"", 'sure', 'met', 'real', 'Flynt', 'i', ""'d"", 'be', 'perplexed', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'Woody', 'lot', 'very', 'skillful', 'acting', 'film', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'Czech-American', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'previous', 'films', 'had', 'included', 'Loves', 'Blonde', 'Firemen', 'Ball', 'Taking', 'Off', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Hair', 'Amadeus', 'Honestly', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'People', 'vs', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'were', 'not', 'respect', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'director.But', 'have', 'confess', 'first', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'left', 'skeptical', 'Flynt', 'obnoxious', 'sleaze', 'shots', 'are', 'nauseating', 'whole', 'scenario', 'pointless', 'good', 'people', 'Ohio', 'people', 'including', 'Charles', 'Keating', 'resolve', 'make', 'martyr', 'Flynt', 'then', 'film', 'increasingly', 'powerful', 'even', 'Flynt', 'increasingly', 'unpalatable', 'film', 'civil', 'liberties', 'freedom', 'expression', 'right', 'individual', 'resist', 'oppressive', 'self-proclaimed', 'Moral', 'Majority', 'Actor', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'ripping', 'good', 'rhetoric', 'favor', 'freedom-of-conscience', 'portrayal', 'Flynt', 'lawyer', 'Alan', 'Isaacson', 'front', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Flynt', 'personal', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'tragedy', 'laughable', 'elements', 'get', 'shot', 'paralyzed', 'wife', 'become', 'junkie', 'AIDS', 'victim', 'become', 'mentally', 'unsettled', 'film', 'triumphant', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

Still, for the most part, it suceeds in presenting all the controversy in an engaging, quirky and entertaining manner. The picture is also longer than it really needs, as the court scenes start becoming repetitive and tedious at parts. Yet, there are some memmorable moments to discover here (Althea`s declining situation is gut-wretching, and Courtney Love incorporates the character rather well in a beliavable performance that gets better as the plot unfolds).All in all, not a masterpiece, just a fine accomplishment about a tricky and difficult subject matter.

Larry Flynt, played convincingly by Woody Harrelson, and his real life brother Brett Harrelson, playing brother of Larry in the movie, was a nice touch.  I think that added to the believabilty of the portrayals too.  The most fascinating in a movie award goes to.Courtney, I LOVE you in this role.  Never have I seen an actress play a role so convincingly as musician and actress Courtney Love played the Althea Flynt character.

In my opinion, she makes this movie achieve greatness.Ex-NYC mayor Rudy Guiliani's ex-wife, Donna Hanover, plays a great role as evangelist sister of ex-president Jimmy Carter, Ruth Carter-Stapleton.  She introduces Larry to the re-born life, only to lose him again after he is shot, and the epiphany he experienced through her mentoring, is lost.Edward Norton is also wonderful as Larrys long suffering lawyer.

165481,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0800141865,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" clearly has two parts, because before we get around to debating the First Amendment in front of the United States Supreme Court there is the rags to riches story of how a kid selling moonshine back in the hills of Kentucky ended up creating the ""Hustler"" empire.  Basically this is the story of how Flynt (Woody Harrelson) took the example of ""Playboy"" to the next level (""next"" being a sequential idea that does not automatically imply transcendence).  Flynt was just trying to figure out a way of getting people to come to his Cincinnati club to ogle his dancers and drink his booze, but when he pays money for nude photographs of Jackie-O and puts them in ""Hustler"" magazine he is suddenly selling two million copies.Flynt's publishing philosophy is rather simple.  Give the public what it wants and what it wants in this sort of magazines are articles and other content consistent with the dirty pictures because guys do not buy skin magazines to learn how to hook up their stereos (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).  Hugh Hefner might seek such a veneer to provide a sense of propriety for ""Playboy,"" but Flynt is happy to wallow in the reality of pornography.  Emphasizing the crotch shot made ""Hustler"" stand out from the competition and the content ended up as raunchy as the pictures.  Each in turn would bring Flynt to trial and make him a poster boy for the First Amendment.  It is this battle that justifies the title of the film and makes up the second half of the story.This 1996 film is also divided between the messenger and the message.  Harrelson was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as the flamboyant and foul-mouthed Flynt.  If there is a running gag in this film it is the vain attempts by Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton) to reign in his client in court.  But there actually is a method to Flynt's madness because the first time he is hauled into court (the real Flynt plays the judge and James Carville is the prosecutor) he learns that justice does not have to be fair.  If ""Hustler"" is obscene then ""Playboy"" and ""Penthouse"" should be obscene too, and visa versa, but that logic escapes the jury in Cincinnati and it takes an appeals court to reaffirm that the First Amendment by definition covers offensive speech even when it comes in the forms of photographs of naked women with their legs spread.The last act of the film is given over to the message, and it seems almost fitting that when the big moment comes it is Issacman, who has been injured as well as insulted as Flynn's lawyer (he was wounded in the same hail of gunfire that left Flynn a paraplegic), who gets to stand up before the Supreme Court and explain why it is okay to publish a rauchy parody of a liquor ad that suggests the Reverend Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul) lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse.  It is easy to reduce the morale of the film down to Flynt's simple declaration that ""If they'll protect a scumbag like me, then they'll protect all of you,"" but it is Issacman's oral arguments to the court and his exchanges with Justices Stevens and Scalia in particular, taken from the actual transcripts, that lay out the whys and wherefores that should make there way into reasoned arguments on the topic.  When we get to the core issues that are being affirmed by this film, Flynt is sitting in the aisle peeling an orange.Director Milos Forman's film makes it clear that those on the other side do not know that they are wrong: Issacman does not even have to try hard to get Falwell to admit on the witness stand that the ""Hustler"" parody is so outrageous no reasonable person would believe it, thereby destroying the libel claim.  The man behind the first case in Cincinnati is Charles Keating (James Cromwell), whose name is now irrevocably linked with the Savings & Loan bailout scandal, so that those casting the stones are doing so with unclean hands of a different type.  But in the end you can take clearly take the message without the messenger because it would be reasonable for some to consider Flynt neither a martyr nor a hero (certain the dark side of his life is brought clearly into the light).  The problem is that when Flynt asks why he has to go to jail to protect our civil rights it is a legitimate question.",4,A smut peddler becomes an American icon of free expression,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,4298,"['People', 'vs.', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'clearly', 'two', 'parts', 'get', 'around', 'debating', 'First', 'Amendment', 'front', 'United', 'States', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'how', 'kid', 'selling', 'moonshine', 'back', 'hills', 'Kentucky', 'ended', 'up', 'creating', 'Hustler', 'empire', 'Basically', 'story', 'how', 'Flynt', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'took', 'example', 'Playboy', 'next', 'level', 'next', 'being', 'sequential', 'idea', 'not', 'automatically', 'imply', 'transcendence', 'Flynt', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'getting', 'people', 'come', 'Cincinnati', 'club', 'ogle', 'dancers', 'drink', 'booze', 'when', 'money', 'nude', 'photographs', 'Jackie-O', 'Hustler', 'magazine', 'suddenly', 'selling', 'two', 'million', 'copies.Flynt', 'publishing', 'philosophy', 'rather', 'simple', 'Give', 'public', 'what', 'what', 'sort', 'magazines', 'are', 'articles', 'other', 'content', 'consistent', 'dirty', 'pictures', 'guys', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'skin', 'magazines', 'learn', 'how', 'hook', 'up', 'stereos', 'nudge', 'nudge', 'wink', 'wink', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'might', 'seek', 'veneer', 'provide', 'sense', 'propriety', 'Playboy', 'Flynt', 'happy', 'wallow', 'reality', 'pornography', 'Emphasizing', 'crotch', 'shot', 'made', 'Hustler', 'stand', 'out', 'competition', 'content', 'ended', 'up', 'as', 'raunchy', 'pictures', 'turn', 'would', 'bring', 'Flynt', 'trial', 'make', 'poster', 'boy', 'First', 'Amendment', 'battle', 'title', 'film', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'story.This', '1996', 'film', 'also', 'divided', 'messenger', 'message', 'Harrelson', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'flamboyant', 'foul-mouthed', 'Flynt', 'running', 'gag', 'film', 'vain', 'attempts', 'Flynt', 'lawyer', 'Alan', 'Isaacman', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'reign', 'client', 'court', 'actually', 'method', 'Flynt', 'madness', 'first', 'time', 'hauled', 'court', 'real', 'Flynt', 'judge', 'James', 'Carville', 'prosecutor', 'justice', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'fair', 'Hustler', 'obscene', 'then', 'Playboy', 'Penthouse', 'should', 'be', 'obscene', 'too', 'visa', 'versa', 'logic', 'jury', 'Cincinnati', 'appeals', 'court', 'reaffirm', 'First', 'Amendment', 'definition', 'covers', 'offensive', 'speech', 'even', 'when', 'forms', 'photographs', 'naked', 'women', 'legs', 'spread.The', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'given', 'message', 'almost', 'fitting', 'when', 'big', 'moment', 'Issacman', 'who', 'been', 'injured', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'insulted', 'Flynn', 'lawyer', 'was', 'wounded', 'same', 'hail', 'gunfire', 'left', 'Flynn', 'paraplegic', 'who', 'stand', 'up', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'explain', 'why', 'okay', 'publish', 'rauchy', 'parody', 'liquor', 'ad', 'Reverend', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'Richard', 'Paul', 'lost', 'virginity', 'mother', 'outhouse', 'easy', 'reduce', 'morale', 'film', 'down', 'Flynt', 'simple', 'declaration', ""'ll"", 'protect', 'scumbag', 'then', ""'ll"", 'protect', 'Issacman', 'oral', 'arguments', 'court', 'exchanges', 'Justices', 'Stevens', 'Scalia', 'particular', 'taken', 'actual', 'transcripts', 'lay', 'out', 'whys', 'wherefores', 'should', 'make', 'way', 'reasoned', 'arguments', 'topic', 'When', 'get', 'core', 'issues', 'are', 'being', 'affirmed', 'film', 'Flynt', 'sitting', 'aisle', 'peeling', 'orange.Director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'film', 'clear', 'other', 'side', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'are', 'wrong', 'Issacman', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'try', 'hard', 'get', 'Falwell', 'admit', 'witness', 'stand', 'Hustler', 'parody', 'so', 'outrageous', 'reasonable', 'person', 'would', 'believe', 'thereby', 'destroying', 'libel', 'claim', 'man', 'first', 'case', 'Cincinnati', 'Charles', 'Keating', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'name', 'now', 'irrevocably', 'linked', 'Savings', 'Loan', 'bailout', 'scandal', 'casting', 'stones', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'unclean', 'hands', 'different', 'type', 'end', 'can', 'take', 'clearly', 'take', 'message', 'messenger', 'would', 'be', 'reasonable', 'consider', 'Flynt', 'martyr', 'hero', 'certain', 'dark', 'side', 'life', 'brought', 'clearly', 'light', 'problem', 'when', 'Flynt', 'why', 'go', 'jail', 'protect', 'civil', 'rights', 'legitimate', 'question']",N/A

165483,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0800141865,magellan,"[4, 4]","This film chonicles the rise and fall of Larry Flynt from his poor, humble beginnings to wealthy and powerful media tycoon, and the tragedies that shortly befall him after his precipitous rise to wealth and fame.However, he is a tycoon peddling more and more explicit smut to a conflicted populace used to Playboy and Penthouse. Hustler magazines sell out at the newstands while others watch his success with a growing sense of dread, since he is a threat to their conservative morality and views. But Flynt argues that if God himself created a woman's body then it shouldn't be obscene no matter what the religious and moral types say, and that futhermore, he should be protected by our Constitutional right to free speech.Eventually Flynt is vindicated as the case eventually goes to the Supreme Court, which upholds Flynt's right to peddle smut under the First Amendment.In this very well done scene, at this point there is a witty and intelligent exchange between justices Scalia and Stevens and Flynt's lawyer Isaacman, played by Ed Norton, who does a great job here. I believe this might have been Norton's breakthrough or perhaps first film, but I'm not certain of that. But this is the moral climax of the film in Flynt's ultimate vindication by the Supreme Court itself.The film also doesn't shrink from showing the dark side of Flynt's life and character, especially in portraying his erratic and eccentric behavior during much of the film. There are several other events and issues that get addressed, such as the shooting that left him a paraplegic, his religious conversion, and his despotic ways with his top management and occasionally seemingly arbritary decisions as president and CEO.And in his most self-destructive bent, he consistently antagonizes the judges in his court cases and finally  gets thrown into a psychiatric hospital for 15 months for contempt of court during the trial resulting from his portrayal of Jerry Falwell in Hustler cartoon.More destructive financially was that shortly after Hustler magazine's rise, he gets religious himself and starts injecting religion and morality into Hustler's approach, with an attendant drop in sales. Finally Flynt gets thrown in jail by the judge for contempt of court, after which his wife reverses Flynt's religious direction and they go back to being smut peddlers while he's in prison.And in the initial court trial for smut, Flynt taunts the judge before his sentencing by saying the court hasn't made a single intelligent decision so far and he doesn't expect one now, and so the judge sentences him to 25 years. Fortunately, this is overthrown on appeal after 6 months.By the way, the TV version is missing some of the more explicit dialog and a few scenes that I remember from the original movie. For example, Flynt isn't shown wearing the t shirt that said ""F_ck this court"" during the slander trial. However, there is considerable nudity, at least from the waist up.Overall, a good movie with fine performances by Harrelson and Norton on the rise and fall and eventual return of the media tycoon who pushed the limits of the publishing industry to new highs (or perhaps lows) and who was ultimately vindicated by the Supreme Court in a landmark case.",4,A few comments,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,3234,"['film', 'rise', 'fall', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'poor', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'media', 'tycoon', 'tragedies', 'shortly', 'befall', 'precipitous', 'rise', 'wealth', 'fame.However', 'tycoon', 'peddling', 'more', 'more', 'explicit', 'smut', 'conflicted', 'populace', 'used', 'Playboy', 'Penthouse', 'Hustler', 'magazines', 'sell', 'out', 'newstands', 'others', 'watch', 'success', 'growing', 'sense', 'dread', 'threat', 'conservative', 'morality', 'views', 'Flynt', 'God', 'created', 'woman', 'body', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'obscene', 'matter', 'what', 'religious', 'moral', 'types', 'say', 'futhermore', 'should', 'be', 'protected', 'Constitutional', 'right', 'free', 'speech.Eventually', 'Flynt', 'vindicated', 'case', 'eventually', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Flynt', 'right', 'peddle', 'smut', 'First', 'Amendment.In', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'scene', 'point', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'exchange', 'justices', 'Scalia', 'Stevens', 'Flynt', 'lawyer', 'Isaacman', 'played', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'believe', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Norton', 'breakthrough', 'perhaps', 'first', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'moral', 'climax', 'film', 'Flynt', 'ultimate', 'vindication', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'itself.The', 'film', 'also', ""n't"", 'shrink', 'showing', 'dark', 'side', 'Flynt', 'life', 'character', 'especially', 'portraying', 'erratic', 'eccentric', 'behavior', 'much', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'events', 'issues', 'get', 'addressed', 'such', 'shooting', 'left', 'paraplegic', 'religious', 'conversion', 'despotic', 'ways', 'top', 'management', 'occasionally', 'seemingly', 'arbritary', 'decisions', 'president', 'CEO.And', 'most', 'self-destructive', 'bent', 'consistently', 'judges', 'court', 'cases', 'finally', 'thrown', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', '15', 'months', 'contempt', 'court', 'trial', 'resulting', 'portrayal', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'Hustler', 'cartoon.More', 'destructive', 'financially', 'was', 'shortly', 'Hustler', 'magazine', 'rise', 'religious', 'injecting', 'religion', 'morality', 'Hustler', 'approach', 'attendant', 'drop', 'sales', 'Finally', 'Flynt', 'thrown', 'jail', 'judge', 'contempt', 'court', 'wife', 'Flynt', 'religious', 'direction', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'smut', 'peddlers', 'prison.And', 'initial', 'court', 'trial', 'smut', 'Flynt', 'judge', 'sentencing', 'saying', 'court', ""n't"", 'made', 'single', 'intelligent', 'decision', 'so', 'far', ""n't"", 'expect', 'one', 'now', 'so', 'judge', '25', 'years', 'Fortunately', 'overthrown', 'appeal', '6', 'months.By', 'way', 'TV', 'version', 'missing', 'more', 'explicit', 'dialog', 'few', 'scenes', 'remember', 'original', 'movie', 'example', 'Flynt', ""n't"", 'shown', 'wearing', 't', 'shirt', 'said', 'F_ck', 'court', 'slander', 'trial', 'However', 'considerable', 'nudity', 'least', 'waist', 'up.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'fine', 'performances', 'Harrelson', 'Norton', 'rise', 'fall', 'eventual', 'return', 'media', 'tycoon', 'who', 'pushed', 'limits', 'publishing', 'industry', 'new', 'highs', 'perhaps', 'lows', 'who', 'was', 'ultimately', 'vindicated', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'landmark', 'case']",N/A

Yes, the film does appear to actively celebrate pornography within our society by honoring Larry Flyntt as a ""hero"" of the First Amendment.  However, the film is actually done in a fairly entertaining way, showcasing who Larry Flyntt is -- without any attempt to cover up his most well-known distusting publications, including the woman being pushed into the meat grinder.  The story focuses on Larry Flyntt's case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hustler v. Falwell, which dealt with the First Amendment case related to whether Larry Flyntt had the right to publish a pictorial representation of religious icon Jerry Falwell having sexual relations with his mother, in an outhouse (of all places!) with the description, ""Falwell's first time.""  The issue in the case is whether one is able to defame Falwell, a public figure, if people clearly would understand that the ad is false.Clearly, Falwell would never have enganged in such behavior.  The U.S. Supreme Court said that Flyntt could publish such material because no one would believe that Falwell would do that, and thus, he received no harm.The irony is that the movie, while called The People v. Larry Flyntt, is simply not true, because the dispute between Falwell and Flyntt was a civil, not criminal, issue.  Now Flyntt has been subject to obscenity prosecutions, too, but that is not the subject of this movie.

165488,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,0800141865,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 4]","Telling the story of Larry Flynt, the unsympathetic character behind Hustler magazine, was always going to be a hard job.  However, Foreman's movie manages to pull it off thanks to great jobs from all round.  It starts with a brief clip of Flynt's early life as a boy, peddling booze to redneck farmers and throwing a jug at his father, who's drunk all his wares.  Fastforward to his strip joints where he meets feisty, unpredictable but undeniably sexy Althea (Love).  Before long they've set up Hustler magazine and not long after that they find themselves in a series of court cases concerning the decency of Flynt's publication.  The story really switches gears though when Flynt is gunned down by a sniper's bullet, leading to his Althea's drug addiction and Flynt's increasing eccentricity.The fact that not only is the direction good, but the acting and script are also brilliant.  Woody Harrellson gives the best performance of his career as Flynt, evoking sympathy in a character that's bravely rarely played for the sympathy vote.  Courtney Love was born to play the role of grungy white trash glamourous drug addict Althea and pulls it off so convincing that it's surprising that she was nominated for an Oscar as well as a Golden Globe.  Edward Norton turns in another great performance in the supporting role of Flynt's lawyer and anyone who's seen his performances in American History X or Primal Fear won't need to hear any more convincing about his abilities as an actor.The best part of the story is the pathetic nature that it draws out in its protagonists.  Love in particular enters her character so much that when she wraps her arms around her husband after just using his drugs it's close to heartbreaking.  Whilst the argument for Flynt as a liberator of free speech may seem a bit over the top (despite some very funny scenes in the courtroom), the film gently suggests the intense melancholy behind the larger than life character.  The last scene especially evokes this superbly, with Larry watching videos of his wife telling him that he'll grow old and ugly as she's playfully dancing naked for him.  As the camera shows us Larry's face we know that he realises this to be true as he's sat alone in his luxurious bedroom despite his greatest victory against the Supreme Court.",5,Superb biography with an edge to it,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,2303,"['Telling', 'story', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'Hustler', 'magazine', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'job', 'However', 'Foreman', 'movie', 'pull', 'off', 'thanks', 'great', 'jobs', 'round', 'brief', 'clip', 'Flynt', 'early', 'life', 'boy', 'peddling', 'booze', 'redneck', 'farmers', 'throwing', 'jug', 'father', 'who', 'drunk', 'wares', 'Fastforward', 'strip', 'joints', 'where', 'feisty', 'unpredictable', 'undeniably', 'sexy', 'Althea', 'Love', 'long', ""'ve"", 'set', 'up', 'Hustler', 'magazine', 'not', 'long', 'find', 'series', 'court', 'cases', 'concerning', 'decency', 'Flynt', 'publication', 'story', 'really', 'switches', 'gears', 'when', 'Flynt', 'gunned', 'down', 'sniper', 'bullet', 'leading', 'Althea', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Flynt', 'increasing', 'eccentricity.The', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'direction', 'good', 'acting', 'script', 'are', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Woody', 'Harrellson', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Flynt', 'evoking', 'sympathy', 'character', 'bravely', 'rarely', 'played', 'sympathy', 'vote', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'grungy', 'white', 'trash', 'glamourous', 'drug', 'addict', 'Althea', 'off', 'so', 'convincing', 'surprising', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'as', 'well', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'great', 'performance', 'supporting', 'role', 'Flynt', 'lawyer', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'performances', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'hear', 'more', 'convincing', 'abilities', 'actor.The', 'best', 'part', 'story', 'pathetic', 'nature', 'out', 'protagonists', 'Love', 'particular', 'enters', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'wraps', 'arms', 'husband', 'just', 'using', 'drugs', 'close', 'heartbreaking', 'argument', 'Flynt', 'liberator', 'free', 'speech', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'top', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'courtroom', 'film', 'gently', 'intense', 'melancholy', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'last', 'scene', 'especially', 'superbly', 'Larry', 'watching', 'videos', 'wife', 'telling', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'old', 'ugly', 'playfully', 'dancing', 'naked', 'camera', 'Larry', 'face', 'know', 'be', 'true', 'sat', 'alone', 'luxurious', 'bedroom', 'greatest', 'victory', 'Supreme', 'Court']",N/A

And it is just as important for those with moral conviction as it is for those who have have literally no moral or godly conviction. For the usual christian they may see the film as a statement that equates the wages of sin amounting to utter ruin. For there is a point that can be made that to the conservatives Larry Flints life was one of literal implosion. Living with no limits or control leads a slippery slop to demise. To the christian this film is an example that drives home the common statement The wages of sin is death. In the case of Flint death follows through excess, drug use, loss of control and mental deterioration. Indeed most of us wouldnt want to trade places with Flint no matter how much money was involved. His life indeed was a tragic one. To some however Flint is seen as something of a hero. A voice for free speech and a free america. Flint in reality was a man with clearly no moral convictions at all, be it spiritual or secular. Without some conviction to rule your life in one form or another total misdirection and demise follow. This film in my opinion never judges the religious order or the heathen one. It masterfully stands by as an observer and simply tells the story as it really happened. Leaving each individual to decide which side in this debate they would really want to be part of. In the midst of this are three incredible performances by Woody Harrelson, Cortney Love, and Edward Norton.

165490,A1VHGHK5NN7NGN,0800141865,Raymond Louis Llompart,"[0, 1]","Given all those negative words, the positives are impossible to forget-------and the fact is that that REPULSIVE woman by the name of Courtney Love gives a fantastic performance that perhaps------only perhaps-------manages to eclipse the GREAT performance by Harrelson. Or was Ms. Love simply playing herself?, as my companion wisely noted!Has she done any more acting? I do not know whether this was filmed before the death of her husband, but tell me if I am wrong-----I believe she became a very wealthy woman after that since she inherited most of Cobain's estate, so arguably because of that she never pushed herself----- and nothing to deter talent (very broadly speaking) than being very wealthy. Where do you think some acquaintances of mine ended? Not as leaders and great successes, but &#34;losers&#34; that quietly pursued &#34;careers&#34; that were purely imagination------aaah! those days when in certain circles nobody asked you &#34;What do you do?&#34;. But perhaps we are better off today.The director carries us on a rollercoaster ride that can't stop or slow down since perhaps there wasn't a good screenwriter to give the movie depth. The film remains basically a &#34;telenovela&#34; (our new preferred way for &#34;soap opera&#34; that-----no offense to fans of &#34;Days of our lives&#34;--------begin and end within six months or so.......and the HEAT they emanate!!)But I digress----forgive me.Everything is just about &#34;by the book&#34;, so to speak, but there's a lifeless quality to the structure of the whole act.Again, performances are STRONG, and they help us along the way, but then all this &#34;OPERATIC&#34;, ridiculous music in so many scenes  give a cheap grandiosity to the whole thing. Ludicrous----- just as ludicrous as the idealized portrait of Mr. Flynt himself. Basically a repugnant human being, Harrelson is here to give us a glamorized, falsified version of Flynt.Can you tell me how is it that in Bio-pics the protagonist is always so good-looking next to the real thing? Can't they find UGLY people just as in this case? Well, the fact is that there is a moment when FLYNT himself plays a very conservative, bloated judge that must have been a fantastic time for him (and US as well!). Of course, you need to recognize Flint, and this is roughly 20 years ago.Not to forget! Edward (?) NORTON, looking fresh as a kid out of High School, already had the wonderful skills that he was to prove to us over the years again and again.The movie's CORE and ------mistake?-------is the issue of the First Amendment. The reason why Flynt wins the case, at the Supreme Court no less, is because of a fake advertisement on his HUSTLER magazine in which that master of reincarnation of Jesus Jerry Falwell appears having sex with his mother. It is something ugly that you or I would not want to be humiliated by in our own lives. But the First Amendment, that mostly dormant one (?) in our magnificent constitution until, perhaps, &#34;Larry Flynt VERSUS.....&#34; (or is my history correct?) brings Flynt to triumph when invoked convincingly enough so that what is basically a parody can be protected from Libel, etc.That has come to have serious positive (and not so positive) changes in our society's freedom of speech.The perplexing thing is that to a great extent that has nothing much (please tell me otherwise) to do with Flynt's dramatic fights with Justice over PORNOGRAPHY. Of course, the first amendment has, perhaps since then, opened the door to free distribution of Porn all across America (not to mention the NET and its intractable &#34;problem&#34; over whether we can limit or not the gigantic amount of PORN that has become the norm, and for which, quite seriously speaking, has made Flynt's publications almost a work of literature, no?).The movie simply shifts course and from Pornography itself it jumps to the protection of parody and anything you want to say about any public figure no matter how disgusting AS LONG as you inject some kind of tongue-in-cheek. Am I right that a program like &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34; was greatly improved by this decision?Perhaps you can guess that one subject follows the other, but it is an obscure connection that perhaps someone reading this can illustrate for us.For that, Mr. Flynt will be remembered------surprisingly enough that the decision was unanimous, in a court eternally divided 5-to-4.That is perhaps too much &#34;thinking&#34; to try to inject into this, again, failure of a course on LAW, but even without it the film remains a mash-up of biography--------not to mention that this &#34;moderate&#34; (your writer) found it extremely celebratory of its liberal viewpoint, unfairly leaving us in the dark (irresponsibly so) about the counter-arguments.

Milos Forman, as always, employs  an engaging visual style and offbeat humor that adds much to the movie.  Woody Harrelson is one of my least favorite actors, but his performance was  terrific.  He didn't make Flynt out to be a hero, just a man out to make a  buck.  Courtney Love was decent, but she seemed to be in over her head in  the more dramatic scenes.  Edward Norton delivered a pitch-perfect  performance as the lawyer who puts up with a lot more than he should from  his client.  The problem with this movie is the writing.  It was written by  the same people who wrote Ed Wood (a movie a greatly admire), but features  none of the emotional resonance that it should.

This movie was tongue in cheek, and it was tragic. This wonderfully directed and acted movie will show people that Larry Flynt may not be the most moral person (in some people's minds), but it shows that he has fought for every American's rights.Courtney Love blew me away as Larry Flynt's late wife.
