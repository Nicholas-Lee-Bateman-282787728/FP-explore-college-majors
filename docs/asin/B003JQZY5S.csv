1347773,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003JQZY5S,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","Hush Little Baby is a Lifetime movie with a supernatural theme. The movie opens with Jamie (Victoria Pratt) trying to get her young daughter to come back home with her. The young child has wandered off along a river, and eventually this ends in the tragic drowning of the child. A year later, Jamie finds herself pregnant and moving into a new home in a new town when her loving husband gets a promotion. Though things look promising, Jamie finds her life spiraling into darkness with the difficult birth of her new baby girl, Caitlin. Something about Caitlin does not seem right, and a series of weird events prompt Jamie to question whether her baby could actually mean her harm.There's enough suspense throughout the movie to hold the viewer's interest, making one wonder whether there is truly a supernatural entity behind these weird occurrences or is Jamie suffering from some form of psychosis. The acting by the lead actress is convincing, with Victoria Pratt playing a highly distraught mother who cannot fathom why her own child could possibly mean her harm. Though the story starts off strong, it meanders and suffers from an abrupt ending which seems rather forced and awkward. Otherwise, this was for the most part an interesting movie.",3,Strong beginning marred by abrupt and weak ending,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,1249,"['Hush', 'Little', 'Baby', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'supernatural', 'theme', 'movie', 'Jamie', 'Victoria', 'Pratt', 'trying', 'get', 'young', 'daughter', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'young', 'child', 'wandered', 'off', 'river', 'eventually', 'tragic', 'drowning', 'child', 'year', 'later', 'Jamie', 'pregnant', 'moving', 'new', 'home', 'new', 'town', 'when', 'loving', 'husband', 'promotion', 'things', 'look', 'promising', 'Jamie', 'life', 'spiraling', 'darkness', 'difficult', 'birth', 'new', 'baby', 'girl', 'Caitlin', 'Something', 'Caitlin', 'not', 'seem', 'right', 'series', 'weird', 'events', 'prompt', 'Jamie', 'question', 'baby', 'could', 'actually', 'mean', 'harm.There', 'enough', 'suspense', 'movie', 'hold', 'viewer', 'interest', 'making', 'one', 'wonder', 'truly', 'supernatural', 'entity', 'weird', 'occurrences', 'Jamie', 'suffering', 'form', 'psychosis', 'acting', 'lead', 'actress', 'convincing', 'Victoria', 'Pratt', 'playing', 'highly', 'distraught', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'why', 'own', 'child', 'could', 'possibly', 'mean', 'harm', 'story', 'strong', 'meanders', 'suffers', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'rather', 'forced', 'awkward', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'interesting', 'movie']",N/A
