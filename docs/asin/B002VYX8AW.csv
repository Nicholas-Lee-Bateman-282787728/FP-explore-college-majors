1296501,A1O1HWFO5Q9PJ0,B002VYX8AW,"A. J. ""adahl-Korean drama enthusiast""","[5, 5]","If you liked Boys Over Flowers, how could you not want to see and own the second volume which is the finale. I just love the evolution of the characters and strength of the young woman in the series. I thought it dreadful how her family exploited her, but she holds no resentment toward them and loves them. Is this realistic to how Korean families are toward there daughters? I notice a trend and I can only feel that the spirit of young women to be very loving and strong. When the mother dumps salt on the wealthy woman's head, I am sure all watching cheered, but knew horrific consequences were coming in the near future. I also see a trend in encouraging young women to not feel they have to sacrifice their hopes, dreams and ambitions on marriage. They are portrayed as strong enough to make a decision to follow a career even if it means seperation from the man they love. If the love is true it will survive. I think this is so wise. I wish it had been taught to me. Confidence in oneself as a woman is something many societies do not teach much less families. You must have both 1 & 2  to complete the story. I highly recommend this series to all who love Korean drama.",5,boys over flowers 2 - MUST SEE AND OWN,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,1178,"['liked', 'Boys', 'Over', 'Flowers', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'own', 'second', 'volume', 'finale', 'just', 'love', 'evolution', 'characters', 'strength', 'young', 'woman', 'series', 'thought', 'dreadful', 'how', 'family', 'exploited', 'resentment', 'realistic', 'how', 'Korean', 'families', 'are', 'daughters', 'notice', 'trend', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'spirit', 'young', 'women', 'be', 'very', 'loving', 'strong', 'When', 'mother', 'salt', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'head', 'am', 'sure', 'watching', 'cheered', 'knew', 'horrific', 'consequences', 'were', 'coming', 'near', 'future', 'also', 'see', 'trend', 'encouraging', 'young', 'women', 'not', 'feel', 'have', 'sacrifice', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'ambitions', 'marriage', 'are', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'decision', 'follow', 'career', 'even', 'seperation', 'man', 'love', 'love', 'true', 'will', 'survive', 'think', 'so', 'wise', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'taught', 'Confidence', 'woman', 'something', 'many', 'societies', 'do', 'not', 'teach', 'much', 'less', 'families', 'must', 'have', '1', '2', 'complete', 'story', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'love', 'Korean', 'drama']",Boys Over Flowers Vol. 2

They are good-looking, rich, and powerful. This is k-drama that's very good from the beginning to the end. There was never a dull moment. Though I wasn't crazy about the ending. (The Japanese version ending was much better). Never the less, it is well written and the actors are good (except for the leading lady). Not to mention the sound track is kick a@@.

All four guys are sooooo handsome! I think I would choose Kim Hyun Joong over all of them but Kim Bum would be my second choice. Lee Min Ho is just too tall but he is cute.

Kept thinking about the series after I finished and have even started watching it again.  Just when you think everything is finally going Jandi and Junpyo's way, his mother comes barreling in even more determined to keep the two apart.  Her family becomes homeless, Junpyo is cold and distant towards her, and an arranged marriage comes into play.  Oh, and did I mention, Junpyo's sister hires Jandi as their house maid?  Poor Jandi!  Thank goodness she has the love and support from the other F4 boys, especially Jihoo who is always there to protect her.  This season definitely takes you on an emotional roller coaster.  Plus, it involves more back story on the other F4 members.  Oh, and be prepared.  Just when you think issues get solved, another twist happens in the story.  Through it all, the F4 and Jandi realize just how important family, friendship, and loyalty are and that you must fight to appreciate and cherish true love.",5,BOYS OVER FLOWERS 2 A MUST HAVE!!!,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,1045,"['Based', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'Manga', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'definitely', 'not', 'disappoint', 'LOVE', 'THIS', 'DRAMA', 'SERIES', 'Kept', 'thinking', 'series', 'finished', 'have', 'even', 'started', 'watching', 'again', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'everything', 'finally', 'going', 'Jandi', 'Junpyo', 'way', 'mother', 'barreling', 'even', 'more', 'determined', 'keep', 'two', 'apart', 'family', 'homeless', 'Junpyo', 'cold', 'distant', 'towards', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'play', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'Junpyo', 'sister', 'Jandi', 'house', 'maid', 'Poor', 'Jandi', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'love', 'support', 'other', 'F4', 'boys', 'especially', 'Jihoo', 'who', 'always', 'there', 'protect', 'season', 'definitely', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'other', 'F4', 'members', 'Oh', 'be', 'prepared', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'issues', 'get', 'solved', 'twist', 'story', 'F4', 'Jandi', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'family', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'are', 'must', 'fight', 'appreciate', 'cherish', 'true', 'love']",Boys Over Flowers Vol. 2
