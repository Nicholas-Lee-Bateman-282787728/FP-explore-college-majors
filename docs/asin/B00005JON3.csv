642073,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00005JON3,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[3, 4]","Wolf Creek is a fantastic example of how you can do a lot with a little. This easily one of the best independent films I've ever seen and is easily one of the most terrific and well-executed horror films I've seen. While the film received mixed reviews from critics (Roger Ebert, you're a major ***hole) and moviegoers, if you give it a chance and you're not easily bored, Wolf Creek does impress.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Year: 1999. Three friends; Liz, Kristy, and Ben decide to go on a cross-country across Australia to go to Wolf Creek to see one of the world's biggest craters. When they get back to their station wagon, it won't start or even make noise. Just when they are about to spend the night there, a man named Mick just so happens to come along and offers them a tow to his place to fix their car. So the group goes along with the plan, but when they wake up the next morning they realize that are trapped with a vicious and dangerous serial killer in the middle of nowhere and try to find a way to escape. The problem is, like Mick said, you never know where he might pop up.MUSIC: Music comes and goes at times, but it's still very good and provides for the tense atmosphere which this film does an excellent job of providing.ACTION: This film starts off pretty slow, but when it gets going it doesn't stop. This film is very tense, very suspenseful, and is actually scary. This film does a great job of capturing the feeling of realism because this is fully capable of happening. The violence is pretty gruesome throughout the film as well. Thank God, a horror film that is actually scary.ACTING: This area was generally good, but there were times in which the actors dropped the ball and they were cheesy. The dialogue was fairly believable, but it also ran into problems. It's pretty good overall and the actors make it seem real, that's the important thing.OVERALL: If you're a person who is tired of the usual pointless crappy horror films, then Wolf Creek is a definite must-have. Wolf Creek is a fantastic independent horror film that is definitely worthy of a purchase. It's creepy, it's gruesome, and it feels realistic.THE GOOD: The actors, the gore, the music, and the realism.THE BAD: Moments of bad acting and dialogue, and it's slow in the beginning.",5,AN EXCELLENT INDEPENDENT FILM  9.5 OUT OF 10,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,2271,"['Wolf', 'Creek', 'fantastic', 'example', 'how', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'little', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'independent', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'terrific', 'well-executed', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'critics', 'Roger', 'Ebert', ""'re"", 'major', '***hole', 'moviegoers', 'give', 'chance', ""'re"", 'not', 'easily', 'bored', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'impress.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Year', '1999', 'Three', 'friends', 'Liz', 'Kristy', 'Ben', 'decide', 'go', 'cross-country', 'Australia', 'go', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'see', 'one', 'world', 'biggest', 'craters', 'When', 'get', 'back', 'station', 'wagon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'even', 'make', 'noise', 'Just', 'when', 'are', 'spend', 'night', 'there', 'man', 'named', 'Mick', 'just', 'so', 'come', 'along', 'tow', 'place', 'fix', 'car', 'group', 'along', 'plan', 'when', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'realize', 'are', 'trapped', 'vicious', 'dangerous', 'serial', 'killer', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'escape', 'problem', 'Mick', 'said', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'might', 'pop', 'up.MUSIC', 'Music', 'times', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'providing.ACTION', 'film', 'pretty', 'slow', 'when', 'going', ""n't"", 'stop', 'film', 'very', 'tense', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'actually', 'scary', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'feeling', 'realism', 'fully', 'capable', 'happening', 'violence', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Thank', 'God', 'horror', 'film', 'actually', 'scary.ACTING', 'area', 'was', 'generally', 'good', 'were', 'times', 'actors', 'dropped', 'ball', 'were', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'was', 'fairly', 'believable', 'also', 'ran', 'problems', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'actors', 'make', 'seem', 'real', 'important', 'thing.OVERALL', ""'re"", 'person', 'who', 'tired', 'usual', 'pointless', 'crappy', 'horror', 'films', 'then', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'definite', 'must-have', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'fantastic', 'independent', 'horror', 'film', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'creepy', 'gruesome', 'realistic.THE', 'GOOD', 'actors', 'gore', 'music', 'realism.THE', 'BAD', 'Moments', 'bad', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'slow', 'beginning']",N/A

Director & writer Greg Mclean wrote this fictional story before the events it is based on. Once he was aware about the Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio 2001 true event, Greg combined the real crime with this film to great marketing effect, hence the strapline `BASED ON TRUE EVENTS'.There are two parallel crimes that could be influential in this film, some of you may actually remember the first true crime that did happen some distance from the real Wolf Creek, actually known as Wolfe Creek, is as follows: Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio were travelling in their van when they were stopped by another man called Bradley John Murdoch, a mechanic who observed that sparks were flying out of the vans exhaust. When checking the exhaust with Peter Falconio while Joanne Lees reved the engine, Joanne heard a gun shot and the next moment Bradley John Murdoch grabbed her and dumped her bound and gagged in his truck. Joanne assumed he went to dispose of Peters dead body. She managed to escape and hid in a bush.Then Bradley returned looking for her with the assistance of his dog. Eventually he gave up and Joanne managed to get picked up and survived a terrifying ordeal. There was no body or weapon found. The police carried out one of the largest man hunt and did arrest Bradley J. Murdoch. He was sentenced to life imprisonment (28 years) in 2005.There are many unanswered questions regarding this case. A book was released called `No Turning Back' by Joanne Lees. I might read this, if you have please let me know if it's well written. The other real life link is that the brilliant onscreen character Mick Taylor (played by the excellent John Jarratt) is based on a real life serial killer called Ivan Milat. He was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences plus another 18 years for picking up seven hitchhikers in New South Wales and torturing before murdering them. This crime is known as `The backpacker murders'.When truth is mixed into a story it is unsettling, and you can definitely believe this `Wolf Creek' film events have or are likely to happen one day. John Jarratt has created one of the most disturbing and nasty characters I have ever seen on film. He is up there with the best. When I came home after seeing this film at the cinema with my good friend Dave, my wife said we looked very pale and quiet. It was because of watching this film. So much time is spent getting to know and understand the close relationships of the three travelling friends, combined with those beautiful shots of Australia...It's like watching a documentary that's selling the stunning landscape of Australia.The characters travel to Wolf Creek...That's all you need to know if you have not seen it yet. The violence is so brutal, even the hardest will wince and find themselves looking through fingers, hoping the automatic gesture will lessen the horror. No place to hide in this one because you can actually imagine the events in front of you could be real. I've mentioned this film as a comparison several times with other reviews above, that's because it's a great template for true extreme terror. I can't recommend this experience enough. It is not a film to snuggle up with your partner to watch because they, or you, may be angry for what will be witnessed. There is a romantic, hardly any dialogue, moment between two of the friends that is so well done, it's emotionally more interesting than other films that are known for their romantic theme. The other moment that I like is at the beginning of the car towing scene...The original music sends a chill up the spine.So many good stories are set in isolation away from  anyone like `Alien', `The Shining' and `The Thing' come to mind. But if you have the setting in a real place with believable characters that you care about or empathise with, and throw in a truly chilling, intelligent character...you got yourself a winner. `Wolf Creek' ticks all boxes and annihilates the subsequent cheap movie attempts that fail to recreate actual fear. I recommended 'Wolf Creek' to Wayne to watch. He will never let me forget the film ruined his Christmas...Do not speed read my closing statement: `Wolf Creek' is nasty and harrowing.

642075,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JON3,A Customer,"[4, 9]","I was living in Sydney at the time of the famed backpacker killings. As the bodies were discovered in the Belangalo Forest south of Sydney, and the biggest murder investigation in Australia's history got under way, the news reports of the way the victims were tortured and murdered were absolutely shocking and profoundly disturbing. The reported perpetrator Ivan Milat was arrested, and ultimately convicted, and he is now serving a life sentence.Now almost fourteen years later we have a movie that purports to be loosely based on those murders, and whether it should have been made at all is up to the reviewer to decide. Personally I think it's in bad taste, and is disrespectful, not only to the seven victims, but also to the victims' families.  Aussie writer/director Greg McLean skewers the original real-life story, setting Woolf Creek in the wilds of the Western Australian desert where three unsuspecting backpackers come across a staggeringly evil Australian boogieman.Liz (Cassandra Magrath), Kristy (Kestie Morassi) and Ben (Nathan Phillips) leave the tranquil coast of Broome Western Australia a beat-up jalopy after a pointless tequila and Smirnoff Ice binge and head inland, their goal being the Wolf Creek Crater, a giant, circular scar in the earth's crust, the resting place for an ancient meteorite. Their car conks out and their watches stop working when at the same moment help arrives in the form of friendly backwoods giant Mick Taylor (John Jarratt).It's dark and cold and despite some ominous signs, they allow him to tow the car back to his place, an abandoned mining camp, where he starts to work on the repairs. But is Mick all that he seems? As they sit around the campfire, drinking some of his special rainwater, he jokes about murdering tourists and gutting livestock. Next thing we know, Liz wakes up bound and gagged in a room that makes a dungeon look appealing, and is separated from her friends.The rest of the film is a sadistic cat and mouse game in which Mick seeks and destroys his prey in the most vicious and gory fashion, with McLean seriously stretching the limitations of what is acceptable cinematic entertainment. Yes, the film is suspenseful and it's stylishly done, but it's also somewhat nasty and mean-spirited. There are some gorgeous shots of Australia's northern deserts with McLean manipulating nature so that it starts out as a positive force and then turning ominous with rain cloud formations. Francois Tetaz's creepy score also heightens the atmosphere.Judgments aside, the real reason to see Woolf Creek is John Jarrett's over-the-top performance as the evil Mick. The actor has obviously aged a bit since the height of his fame in the mid-1970's, but he's lost nothing of his earthy sex appeal.  With his icy stare, scratchy beard and cackling laugh, this is a monster without an ounce of human compassion that has made it his life's work to murder unsuspecting tourists.Whatever quasi-social commentary McLean throws in about the nature of pure evil and the need to track down these people, who can get away with almost anything in the isolation of Australia's outback, nothing can escape the fact that Woolf Creek is a chilling and disturbing film that tries to recount one of the darker periods in Australian criminal history.

642076,A288BMI28PLPL1,B00005JON3,"Adam L. Coleman ""Just a guy who likes movies.""","[1, 2]","Wolf Creek is a chilling terror film. It doesn't need any Jason/Michael/Freddy/Pinhead un-killable super-villains, nor scores of cute teens getting impaled on sharp objects; a small group of out-of-their element travellers, a psycho bogan (that is like a red-neck in American English) and the awesome desolation of the Australian deserts are enough to make this one of the most thrilling and disturbing films of its kind, ever.Maybe I am biased. I am Australian, of course, and not everything travels. Sure, the idea of city kids who think they're smart straying into territory they really shouldn't is a horror staple, and McLean develops this element of the group's experience more carefully and effectively than any recent equivalent I have seen.Less effective is our villain, and his portrayal by a former Australian TV personality whose name momentarily escapes me. His hammy exaggeration of the villain's ""Aussieness"" - for want of a better word, you'll know what I mean if you buy the DVD - does nothing for the film. In fact, it almost saw the whole undertaking descend into farce.Then there are the actual chases, killings, desperate flights from danger and resultant jaw-breaking suspense. All are incredible. The film takes a little time to get into the slicing and dicing but, when it does, it does not let up. I have seen many recent Halloween wannabes which have not touched for a moment the heights of sweaty dread that this film maintains for much of its entire length.But what really elevated this film for me was the director's use of the unique remoteness of the central Australian landscape to magnify even further the characters' desperation. If you do buy this DVD, which I would certainly recommend even to occasional fans of the genre, just keep in mind that, in many cases, the distances being discussed and travelled in this film would probably equate to travelling between the capitals of the Low Countries or New England states.

642077,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JON3,A. Estes,"[0, 2]","I honestly wanted to like ""Wolf Creek"" more than I did. I really did. Having heard outstanding things about it, and seeing flattering remarks pop up from the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, I was so ready for the next big horror flick. ""Wolkf Creek"" simply isn't that. So, if you're expecting a movie that will blow you away and keep you awake for many nights, this will not satisfy. However, if you are looking for a suspenseful, grisly horror flick that calls back to the good old 70's -- ala ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Last House On The Left"" -- this one's for you.First things first, this movie would have, could have been so much better. How so? Simple. Don't waste so much time in the beginning! Sure, exposition is always nice, and to get to know our characters a little bit before they are slaughtered always helps, but this movie doesn't do that. Instead, we get nearly an hour of three young adults drifting around in Australia, not doing much, not saying much. It isn't until they stop off at a tourist spot that the excitement really begins. But honestly, folks, you very well may fall asleep before this happens. It's a huge handicap to the movie that so much time is spent on nothing, and that we know virtually nothing of our characters, other than they like to drink, smoke pot, and have sex. On the flipside, however, ""Wolf Creek"" is home to one very menacing and memorable villain. Let it be known, I'll never look at those Crocodile Hunter-types the same ever again.

The public, those same people who are giving this a five star kind of film rating, want this because... heck...filming characters torture to the graphic extreme, filming characters killing in senseless cold blood...so why not just revel in depravity?

I guess it is more than just the graphic nature of the bloodletting, it is because humans are depraved and they want to see depraved actions.  Why else did people upon people go to the Colosseum to see gladiators kill each other in epic ways?  Why else were women burned at the stakes so popular in the middle ages?  Why else were people lining up to see African Americans lynched down here in the south? Films like this show that people want to see others die in the most profoundly disturbing way.

Reasonably explicit acts of violence are part of the story.""Wolf Creek"" is said to be based on a true story.  This may be stretching the truth a bit.  There are probably two cases which are points of reference.  The first is the so-called back packer murderer, Ivan Milat, who is currently doing a life term in a high security prison near Sydney.  The second is the Peter Falconio case where the man in question has gone missing presumed murdered with a defendant currently in the dock.  Both cases were particularly gruesome.John Jarrett plays the murderer in ""Wolf Creek"" and he personifies evil.  He is a serial killer who shows neither remorse nor any sign of slowing down.  His technique is generally the same.  He acts to assist travellers who have broken down in the outback before drugging them and then moving on to rape and murder.  For many people, travel in the outback will never be the same after watching this film.Regardless, the film is well worth watching.  The plot is plausible as are the characters.

642087,A2IIC3NBR966LL,B00005JON3,antaylor,"[6, 13]","Not being a particular fan of the horror genre, I don't go out of my way to see any of the latest ones but having just finished watching Wolf Creek on late night TV, I feel strangely obliged to write this review and share some thoughts. I find this a difficult one to review because on the one hand Wolf Creek achieves all the goals of a horror film to a really high standard. I found the film really atmospheric and absolutely terrifying in parts (and I can't remember the last time I said that about a film) emulating classics such as Duel and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; the junk yard setting for the killer's lair is a genuinely chilling location, full of rubbish and squalor and signs of his existence. The camera work is also very impressive, filmed in a realistic style and with some artistic and beautiful wide shots of the Australian outback emphasising the remoteness and futility of escape and I thought the direction was also really assured for a debut from a director who seems to actually enjoy the art of filmmaking. The film also managed to create a truly chilling character for the killer (played excellently by Jarratt).Yet for all this praise, I was ultimately disappointed. With the docu-style filming, realistic / improvisational acting, the `based on true events' claim and the leisurely build up of the characters in the first half, Wolf Creek seems to attempt to be a different type of horror film, to elevate itself above those mundane and pedestrian Friday 13th's and Halloween's, being credible and intelligent and more importantly of being a film of integrity and sympathy about `real' people who would later find themselves caught up in a terrifying ordeal, hunted and tortured not by some ridiculous de-personalised monster with a scary mask, but by a 'real' man. It is with these expectations that Wolf Creek really disappoints and the film's unforgivable faults lie. My main issue with the film is that surely you cannot and should not try to satisfy an audiences' glee for blood and guts here as you would do in those deliberately exploitative B-movie schlock horrors. And unlike the unrealistic, one-dimensional cardboard characters of those B-movies who we don't really mind or care seeing killed off, here in Wolf Creek, by the time they enter their ordeal, the film has already gone to great lengths to make the characters hyper real; characters we have gotten to know and perhaps like, characters with `real' human emotions and behaviour - and how can anyone actually really want to see them suffer in such sadistic and downright distasteful ways and why would the director assume we would? And assuming these killings are not based on any known facts about those `true events' (the only survivor never sees or knows what happens to his friends after he is separated from them and their bodies were apparently never found), why would the director, who also wrote the screenplay, want to make their individual ordeals so nasty?The desire to disturb an audience is legitimate and understandable, we can then empathise and really get a sense of the horrific plight but why the distasteful close ups, why do we need to see a close up of the chopped off fingers as they hit the ground, why do we need to see the knife enter the base of the spine? We can tell it would hurt without the downright exploitative close-ups. I felt far more disturbed when the first female character escapes from the shed out into the eerie junk yard and hears the horrible screams of her friend somewhere off screen like in The Blair Witch Project. I felt far more disturbed and tense when we didn't know what had happened to the male character Ben or where he was for about half an hour. Watching the second female character bound and gagged and antagonised from a distance through the window was far more disturbing than watching the close ups of Ben's wrists as he wrenched himself free from the nails.It seems hypocritical to suggest that it's acceptable to show the gory killings and suffering of unrealistic characters in deliberately exploitative and unrealistic horror flicks and not acceptable in a realistic film such as this but that's how I see it, I suppose it seems disrespectful to the `real' character in some way and for me, it really ruined the film (along with the fact that there were quite a few disappointing clich&eacute;s - why didn't she make sure he was dead?

These first 30 or 40 minutes (I don't remember exactly) when ""nothing happens"" fill you with such dread of something inevitable that's going to happen, I found them enormously disturbing.When the situation begins to evolve ""Wolf Creek"" turns into a usual ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" type of a movie, but it's still very well done. Intense cat-mouse game, no foolish actions from the main characters who try to escape death... I was impressed especially given the fact it's an Australian, low-budget flick. Maybe it's not as powerful as Alexandre Aja's ""High Tension"" and not as mindblowing as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (and I doubt any movie can top this one speaking of viciousness), but it definately stands in one line with ""Wrong Turn"", ""House of 1000 corpses"" and so on (unfortunately I haven't seen the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" yet).

642098,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JON3,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 2]","`Wolf Creek' by Australian director, Greg McLean is a marvelous amalgam of several different horror movie conventions, with a result that is better than many of its models, but not quite as good as the best.For starters, the movie distinguishes itself by being totally free of any supernatural devices. The very best example of this genre is, of course, `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (the original, of course). The very best example of this theme in a mainstream film is `Deliverance', which is easily more scary than many genre horror movies.The sense of reality is enhanced by the statements that the plot is based on real events. Not being privy to any Australian newspapers, I have to believe the producers on this, and it is not too hard to believe, as I can imagine a dandy horror movie made from a homegrown American serial killer. (Come to think of it, it's already been done with `Silence of the Lambs').Unfortunately, this movie falls far short of the grand filmmaking of `Silence of the Lambs' and it even falls short by a bit from its primary mentor, Tobe Hooper, director of the original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. This is not to say it is not a good, chilling movie, as it makes good use of conventions which others have not used very well.Like `Cabin Fever', it makes good use of teenagers on a trip. Oddly, like `Cabin Fever', it also has an unbalanced group with an odd number of people instead of an evenly paired up boy girl, boy girl... Even more oddly, there is nothing made of any `triangles' created by this arrangement, but then, the primary order of business is horror, not romance. But, the director plays the relation between the principle characters exceptionally well until things start to get hinky with the car and the appearance of the perp. The writer also makes excellent use of the queasy feeling one gets about `out of towners' encountering the local crowd of louts, as played to the hilt in the classic cult film by Sam Peckinpah, `Straw Dogs'.While no supernatural agent is involved, the movie makes seems to make excellent use of a natural phenomenon in that the magnetic effects around a large Meteor crater, which also happens to be a major tourist attraction, disables automobiles which sit in the influence of the field for very long. The parties facing this disabled vehicle are then victim to the perp. The perp is so unusual as horror movies go that no less a figure than Quentin Tarantino is quoted on the cover as praising the invention of this character. This character is unusual, but I think he is still not as good as our old favorite, leatherface.The director seems to buy into the belief that things seem more horrible in the dark. This may be true when we are dealing with unseen, supernatural effects. But, if we are to learn anything from `Deliverance', it's that up close and personal terror is worse in the bright sunlight and in the open, unless we happen to be specifically playing on claustrophobia.For those who like their horror unvarnished with spooks and seemingly immortal characters like Halloween's Jason, this is a very rewarding shriekfest, even if the gore is not quite so well executed as by master Hooper.",4,Very Good Realistic Horror.

642102,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00005JON3,Carl Manes,"[3, 4]","Though criticized during its initial release for its grueling depictions of violence and torture, Greg Mclean's first feature film has much more to offer than it is commonly given credit for. WOLF CREEK begins with two English girls and their new friend taking off through the Australian Outback on a sightseeing tour. They return to their car after visiting a remote state park only to find that the engine will not start. Luckily, a local hunter spots them and offers to tow them to his camp, where he can fix the car in the morning. As these three unfortunate travelers would soon find out, they are not the first tourists to run into trouble in the desert, and their would-be savior is actually a wolf in sheep's clothing.Mclean captures the natural beauty, tranquility, and vast emptiness of the Australian landscape in a way that few film exports have in the past. The gradual buildup and leisurely pace are used to establish the futility of escape once the hunter's trap is set. This also allows the audience time to truly connect with Kristy, Liz, and Ben, who are portrayed as honest and utterly believable characters. WOLF CREEK's casual dialog does not make it a point to form rounded backgrounds for any of its players, but rather focuses on creating organic conversations out of everyday speech. John Jarratt assumes the role of Mick, the jolly huntsman that is hiding a cold and calculating killer behind his lively exterior. Jarratt is able to turn character in seconds, and in doing so, he has become one of the most terrifying on-screen villains in years.The gently subdued score adds an unsettling note that underlies the entire picture without ever relying on punctuated jump scares to effectively shock audience. Mclean's tight, hand-held filming has a hint of voyeurism, which draws the viewer in to the intimate dialog but also makes the attacks that much more visceral and disturbing. Unjust criticisms that dismissed the film simply for containing elements of torture were far to quick to judge it on its more brutal qualities, when beneath the horror lies a brilliantly-crafted thriller that is sure to find a growing audience in the years to come.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Wolf Creek,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,2204,"['criticized', 'initial', 'release', 'grueling', 'depictions', 'violence', 'torture', 'Greg', 'Mclean', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'commonly', 'given', 'credit', 'WOLF', 'CREEK', 'two', 'English', 'girls', 'new', 'friend', 'taking', 'off', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'sightseeing', 'tour', 'return', 'car', 'visiting', 'remote', 'state', 'park', 'only', 'find', 'engine', 'will', 'not', 'start', 'Luckily', 'local', 'hunter', 'spots', 'tow', 'camp', 'where', 'can', 'fix', 'car', 'morning', 'three', 'unfortunate', 'travelers', 'would', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'first', 'tourists', 'run', 'trouble', 'desert', 'would-be', 'savior', 'actually', 'wolf', 'sheep', 'clothing.Mclean', 'natural', 'beauty', 'tranquility', 'vast', 'emptiness', 'Australian', 'landscape', 'way', 'few', 'film', 'exports', 'have', 'past', 'gradual', 'buildup', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'are', 'used', 'establish', 'futility', 'escape', 'hunter', 'trap', 'set', 'also', 'audience', 'time', 'truly', 'connect', 'Kristy', 'Liz', 'Ben', 'who', 'are', 'portrayed', 'honest', 'utterly', 'believable', 'characters', 'WOLF', 'CREEK', 'casual', 'dialog', 'not', 'make', 'point', 'form', 'rounded', 'backgrounds', 'players', 'rather', 'creating', 'organic', 'conversations', 'everyday', 'speech', 'John', 'Jarratt', 'role', 'Mick', 'jolly', 'huntsman', 'hiding', 'cold', 'calculating', 'killer', 'lively', 'exterior', 'Jarratt', 'able', 'turn', 'character', 'seconds', 'doing', 'so', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'on-screen', 'villains', 'years.The', 'gently', 'subdued', 'score', 'unsettling', 'note', 'entire', 'picture', 'ever', 'relying', 'punctuated', 'jump', 'scares', 'effectively', 'shock', 'audience', 'Mclean', 'tight', 'hand-held', 'filming', 'hint', 'voyeurism', 'viewer', 'intimate', 'dialog', 'also', 'attacks', 'much', 'more', 'visceral', 'disturbing', 'Unjust', 'criticisms', 'dismissed', 'film', 'simply', 'containing', 'elements', 'torture', 'were', 'far', 'quick', 'judge', 'more', 'brutal', 'qualities', 'when', 'beneath', 'horror', 'brilliantly-crafted', 'thriller', 'sure', 'find', 'growing', 'audience', 'years', 'come.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

The first 45 minutes are devoted to watching a group of attractive young 20 somethings get drunk at a pool party.  It may be exciting to those who thrive on Reality TV, but no clear sense of any personality emerges from any of the characters at the party.  We just hear generic banal chatter, see them get plastered and dive into the pool.  Three of the partiers then go on a drive, stopping off at one of those creepy gas stations that only exist in horror movies, before making their way to this really cool crater.I loved this crater.  That crater was big, it was impressive.  If I ever go to Australia I want to visit that crater.  It was neat and litererally the only thing impressive about this movie.Sad to say, they leave the crater, return to the car which won't start, get a tow from a guy who sounds like Crocodile Dundee, and then do all kinds of wildly stupid things that leads to them getting killed.About the time they were getting towed I got bored and watched the rest of the movie in fast forward.When they started getting killed I tried reverting to regular play, only to find that the movie was still too slow, so I speeded it up again.  Even the stabbings are too slow in this picture.  Didn't the director watch Psycho?  Doesn't he know how to kill people and make it exciting?Apparently not.I cannot help but compare this to other movies about doomed tourists.  The best of which has to be An American Werewolf in London.  That movie opens up with an unsubtle visual metaphor of the heroes riding in the back of a truck filled with sheep -- lambs to the slaughter -- not to mention the fact that these are smart, funny guys whom the audience can immediately like.Then there's the more recent Hostel, a gruesome chiller that moves, even if the characters aren't quite as likable as American Werewolf in London.All in all, what can be said about a movie where the actors are upstaged by a hole in the ground?That is one dull movie.But a very cool crater.",2,The Crater Steals the Show,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,2027,"['One', 'most', 'tedious', 'movies', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'are', 'devoted', 'watching', 'group', 'attractive', 'young', '20', 'somethings', 'get', 'drunk', 'pool', 'party', 'may', 'be', 'exciting', 'who', 'thrive', 'Reality', 'TV', 'clear', 'sense', 'personality', 'characters', 'party', 'just', 'hear', 'generic', 'banal', 'chatter', 'see', 'get', 'plastered', 'dive', 'pool', 'Three', 'partiers', 'then', 'go', 'drive', 'stopping', 'off', 'one', 'creepy', 'gas', 'stations', 'only', 'exist', 'horror', 'movies', 'making', 'way', 'really', 'cool', 'crater.I', 'loved', 'crater', 'crater', 'was', 'big', 'was', 'impressive', 'ever', 'go', 'Australia', 'want', 'visit', 'crater', 'was', 'neat', 'litererally', 'only', 'thing', 'impressive', 'movie.Sad', 'say', 'leave', 'crater', 'return', 'car', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'get', 'tow', 'guy', 'who', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'then', 'do', 'kinds', 'wildly', 'stupid', 'things', 'getting', 'time', 'were', 'getting', 'towed', 'got', 'bored', 'watched', 'rest', 'movie', 'fast', 'forward.When', 'started', 'getting', 'killed', 'tried', 'reverting', 'regular', 'play', 'only', 'find', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'too', 'slow', 'speeded', 'up', 'again', 'Even', 'stabbings', 'are', 'too', 'slow', 'picture', 'Did', ""n't"", 'director', 'watch', 'Psycho', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'kill', 'people', 'make', 'exciting', 'Apparently', 'not.I', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'compare', 'other', 'movies', 'doomed', 'tourists', 'best', 'be', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'movie', 'up', 'unsubtle', 'visual', 'metaphor', 'heroes', 'riding', 'back', 'truck', 'filled', 'sheep', 'slaughter', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'are', 'smart', 'funny', 'guys', 'whom', 'audience', 'can', 'immediately', 'like.Then', 'more', 'recent', 'Hostel', 'gruesome', 'chiller', 'even', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'likable', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London.All', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'upstaged', 'hole', 'ground', 'one', 'dull', 'movie.But', 'very', 'cool', 'crater']",N/A

Maybe. Or maybe, as Ben suggests, ""maybe it was drawn to something in the Earth"".Maybe so.So when our trio get back to their car and discover that it won't start, and their watches have all stopped, and Wolf Creek is rich in tales of drooling terrors drawn from the Stars to this wild haunt of inky darkness---and you start to wonder if our gang isn't about to have a Close Encounter of the Third Kind.And as those lights in the distance, jouncing roughly just above the ground, draw closer---well, turns out aliens are the least of the kids' worries. They're about to have a Close Encounter, alright: a Close Encounter of the Worst Kind.Greg McLean---with only one other indie short to his credit---has captured, on HD digital video and on a shoestring budget, nothing less than the naked, hungry face of Abject Terror.McLean is particularly impish in the way he conjures up his hellish little landscape of death, cruelty, and carnage: the fiend our heroes encounter (John Jarratt, who owns every inch of his role and chews up the scenery and the tourists with equal aplomb) is the very worst sort of predator, one with zero mercy, ferociously cunning, one that hides its black oozing malice beneath a rube's jowly flesh and easy smile.Oh, and did I mention this guy really likes to hunt?McLean has crafted a very precise, clinically merciless, gorgeous-looking monster of a film: it is depraved, and ruthless, and banal, bleak, and nihilistic. It asks no quarter, and in return offers none.It will instantly polarize: you'll be transfixed or repulsed, or both: McLean knows how to find a nasty, fleshy, spongy wound of horror, and poke it, prod it, and then tear it open. Part of the film's pungent, deadly ability to horrify stems, I think, from McLean's decision to contrast the frail mortality of his protagonists against the hard, seamy, craggy infinity of their ancient surroundings.Part of it, no doubt, is the way he makes us voyeurs: we don't want to watch, but we can't look away.And part of it, I'm certain, is the way in which the voyeur ultimately gets served up as victim. And there are, ""Wolf Creek"" proves, far, far worse fates than death.Watches stopped? Darkness pressed up against the windshield?

642110,AIYYKHP5N3YLO,B00005JON3,"Daryl Frasch ""Daryl""","[5, 8]","In order to keep you from getting bored, i will leave out the basic synopsis of ""Wolf Creek"", as everyone else here has explained it numerous times.Most reviewers have been likening this film to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and other like-minded horror flicks of the 70s and 80s.  I have to admit, and i may be criticized for it, but i despise ""Massacre"".  It is possibly one of the most overrated films in history, but that is my opinion.  To compare ""Wolf Creek"" to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is belittling--""Wolf Creek"" is far superior in every possible way.Here, torture is not given a mask or an impossibly psychotic family--doing so has always made horror movies feel less ""authentic"" in that one could not really imagine him/herself in the situation.  ""Creek"" gives us a burly, back-slapping, Crocodile Dundee sort of man who seems like he could be your best friend, only to rip you apart (literally).  He is a person, a human being, not some idiotic freak who wears some foolish mask and chases people through the woods with chainsaws.  He seems almost too real.As most have said, the begining is fairly slow, though not to the point where you want to leave the movie.  It has enough realism and character development to keep you interested.  But, when the action starts, you are thrown right into it when one of the characters goes to sleep and then wakes up with her hands, feet and mouth bound.  At the first onset of trouble, it is clear that the ride has begun--and it is one of extreme terror, created by the isolation of the Australian desert, the authentic, truly inspiring, desperate, emotional performances of our 3 main actors and the horrific, spine tingling acting of our perpatrator.Honestly, i have never felt so helpless in my life.  Watching the characters suffer torture is damn near unbearable, not immature and porn-ridden like the recently horrible film ""Hostel"".  Personally, i felt compassion for these three characters, an honest need to aid them in escaping.  But, alas, i could only sit and watch as they suffered the insufferable.

642112,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005JON3,Dave. K,"[5, 6]","WOLF CREEK****  Out of 5Release Date- December 25th, 2005Running Time- 104-MinutesRating- RWriter/Director- Greg McLeanStarring- Cassandra Magrath, Kestie Morassi, Nathan Phillips and John Jarratt as Mick TaylorWolf Creek has mostly received a passing grade from horror fans, but the biggest complaint is Wolf Creek is too slow and that sort of bothers me. Too many people complain that horror movies have become more about violence and gore and not enough set ups on the characters and that is where Wolf Creek strays from what the genre has become. Writer/Director Greg McLean could have taken the easy way out and loaded the movie with violence and gore rather than character development and had faceless victims in a faceless movie.But instead of being filled with a body count there are only three main characters and half the movie is focused on them and it's really not until the final 40-minutes is when the action kicks in. It just bothers me what people complain about in the genre isn't here and yet people still feel the need to complain. I thought the first half of Wolf Creek was excellent in setting up the characters and getting to know them and that's what elevates the 2nd half. And actually if anything I'd say any pacing problems were more in the 2nd half rather than the first.The screenplay by Greg McLean was quite solid; the main characters are well developed and also very likeable. They come across as real people and that's what helps keep Wolf Creek strong despite the lack of action. Like I said McLean could have easily taken the easy way out and created a slew of characters and have them knocked off in gruesome ways. But instead we only have three characters and they are developed rather than being killed off one by one. The villain Mick Taylor played by John Jarratt was an excellent villain. The problem with movies like Wolf Creek is the villains are often too likeable and that does create a problem.Mick Taylor is actually quite funny and entertaining, but he's also really creepy and scary. And when he's being funny it's also really creepy. I suppose the best way to describe him is sort of like the characters in Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like Taylor, they were funny in a really creepy way. Sometimes people who are insane are actually funny in the things they say and do. Not that I laugh at people with mental illness, but they can be funny. And Mick Taylor is funny, but there is something really sinister underneath and the flaw that often brings movies like Wolf Creek down is avoided.Wolf Creek was the feature film debut by Greg McLean and he handles it like a pro; the pacing of the movie early on was slow, but not in a bad way. It's slow paced, but never boring and the time spent with the characters greatly adds to the movie when the action kicks in. McLean takes his time getting to the action when he could have taken the easy way out and made a splatter flick. While the characters aren't the most developed I've see, but they are some of the most likeable and feel like real people and McLean is able to create a sense of looming danger even when nothing is really happening.The 2nd half is when the action kicks in and there was a lot of hype on how disturbing it was, which is sort of true. Wolf Creek is inspired by a true story and you can also see the 70s exploitation film influence as well and maybe I've just seen too many, but for me while it was twisted it's not like what was made out to be, but than again when you've seen enough of these movies it gets harder and harder to shock the viewer. But with that said the scenes in the 2nd half do pack a heavy punch, which has more to do with the viewer invested into the characters and when these terrible things happen to them again it may not be the most shocking, but works on a twisted level due to the amount of time we've spent with the characters.McLean delivers some solid suspense and tension and is able to craft some really dark scenes and the first major character to die was one of the greatest scenes this genre has ever seen. As excellent as the scene was the power lies more with the fact we've gotten to know the character. Though any pacing problems I found more in the 2nd half rather than the first half. There were a few moments in the 2nd half where it slightly dragged, but very little. McLean manages to keep things running smoothly.The acting was solid and the characters as well, which I mentioned before. Nathan Phillips is solid as Ben and Cassandra Magrath as Liz and Kestie Morassi as Kristy were both likeable and sympathetic. But the true star was John Jarratt as Mick Taylor who delivers one of the greatest horror performances and possibly the best of the decade. Like I said earlier the problem with a lot of these movies is the villain is often too likeable and while Jarratt is funny at times he's still creepy and again like I said before even when funny he's still creepy. Mick Taylor is cruel and vile and Jarratt plays the role to perfection.The biggest complaint for Wolf Creek was the first half was too slow, which I simply don't understand. Unlike most movies of this type or horror films in general Wolf Creek takes it's time and sets up the characters and that is what makes the 2nd half so powerful. Wolf Creek is an excellent horror flick and one of the very best of the decade.",5,Top notch; one of the best of the decade,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,5358,"['WOLF', 'CREEK****', 'Out', '5Release',

But help is at hand as a seemibgly Aussie good ol' boy turns out offering to fix their car and help them back on the road. John Jarret's monstrous Mick Taylor represents the anti-Mick Dundee. A Vietnam vet with a gleam in his eye, and for all the wrong reasons.Sunsequently we soon discover that Taylor is a monster worthy of horror-heavyweights such as Leatherface, Hannibal or even anyone of the the hillbilly characters from Deliverance. His chilling laugh that you will remember long after the film has ended. And like leatherface he is partial to hanging bodies up on hooks.It is actually The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that Wolf Creek greatly gushes over and like an impressionable child it racks up it's own level of brutal violance and gore. It is this level of graphic violence that becomes the film's main flaw. It is not needed really as the tension and horror of their fate is terrifying enough and the gutsy effects really cheapen the experience (Texas Chainsaw Massacre itself rarely revealed gore therefore keeping the tension going).As a low-budget film it is very well made, atmospheric and full of grizzly aussie characters that you won't seen in the tourist brochure. However, the film does keep it's sense of realism in check and I prefer this to the bloated, irritatingly shock-for-shock emptiness of HOSTEL or the smugness of SAW 3.",4,"Tense, atmospheric low-budget movie.....",1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,1949,"['When', 'two', 'Brits', 'Kristy', 'Liz', 'hook', 'up', 'Aussie', 'Ben', 'Mitchell', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'journey', 'fun', 'adventure', 'Australia', 'vast', 'outback', 'would', 'turn', 'terrifying', 'nightmare', 'reminiscences', 'real-life', 'Austalian', 'murder', 'cases', 'such', 'infamous', 'Backpacker', 'murders', 'Ivan', 'Milat', 'disappearence', 'British', 'tourist', 'Peter', 'Falconio.The', 'film', 'slow', 'seen', 'tension', 'up', 'when', 'three', 'are', 'stranded', 'middle', 'night', 'Wolfe', 'Creek', 'when', 'car', 'mysteriously', 'out', 'hint', 'strange', 'magnetic', 'interference', 'watche', 'stop', 'also', 'help', 'hand', 'seemibgly', 'Aussie', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'out', 'offering', 'fix', 'car', 'help', 'back', 'road', 'John', 'Jarret', 'monstrous', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'anti-Mick', 'Dundee', 'A', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'gleam', 'eye', 'wrong', 'reasons.Sunsequently', 'soon', 'discover', 'Taylor', 'monster', 'worthy', 'horror-heavyweights', 'such', 'Leatherface', 'Hannibal', 'even', 'anyone', 'hillbilly', 'characters', 'Deliverance', 'chilling', 'laugh', 'will', 'remember', 'long', 'film', 'ended', 'leatherface', 'partial', 'hanging', 'bodies', 'up', 'hooks.It', 'actually', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'greatly', 'impressionable', 'child', 'own', 'level', 'brutal', 'violance', 'gore', 'level', 'graphic', 'violence', 'film', 'main', 'flaw', 'not', 'needed', 'really', 'tension', 'horror', 'fate', 'terrifying', 'enough', 'gutsy', 'effects', 'really', 'cheapen', 'experience', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'rarely', 'revealed', 'gore', 'therefore', 'keeping', 'tension', 'going', '.As', 'low-budget', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'atmospheric', 'full', 'grizzly', 'aussie', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seen', 'tourist', 'brochure', 'However', 'film', 'keep', 'sense', 'realism', 'check', 'prefer', 'bloated', 'irritatingly', 'shock-for-shock', 'emptiness', 'HOSTEL', 'smugness', 'SAW', '3']",N/A

If almost every horror critic on the internet says this is one of the best horror flicks of the year it is a really sad year for that genere.  I mean Wolf Creek does have quite a couple of unsettling moments and it is a ""real"" horror flick but it is not a horror classic.The story is very basic and the setup is the best part of the entire film.  Three vacationing twenty year olds find themselves in a cat and mouse game with a serial killer in the Austrailian outback.  But most of us horror fans know its not the story, but the execution that is important.  The further the twenty-somethings move away from civilization the greater the feeling of dread becomes.  It reaches almost unbearable limits when they finally reach Wolf Creek.  I would say up to and including the first murder scene the film is actually could have made it into my top 10 best of all time horror flicks(and I have seen over maybe 500 and I'm a fan of the genre). Its just too bad that the execution after that part does not match the beginning and has a slow decent into mediocrity and the not needed and dumb final shot(if it is a ""true"" story let the people who see it do researchits what really happened after all the more you think about something the scarier it is).The movie is a very slow burn, old school type horror flick which means nothing happens in the first hour that way when the horror comes it hits a lot harder.  I've always said if you can be brutal without being gory you have what it takes to be a great horror director and Wolf Creek is more brutal than gory(the ""head on a stick"" moment is probably the most brutal but not very gory murder you will ever see this year).In the end I decided four stars because of the great opening and setup.  This is a very hard flick to recommend, its bleak and depressing and its only for hardcore horror fans.  The disc is very well done and I have nothing bad to say about the audio, video, & extras.One more thing,  a lot of people put this and Eli Roth's Hostel in the same category and they are actually polar opposites. Where that one was a more a fast-moving, throw it in your face quick hit to the gut.  Wolf Creek is a slow moving burn into your mind that tries to stay with you after you shut the TV off.

There is a lot of back story on how the two women are going back to England very soon and they don't want to leave. Well, they may not have to.When they get to Wolf Creek, they find the spot they have been looking for. The area where a meteorite once hit. Possibly due to that, their watches stop and their car doesn't run. They appear to be stuck for the night, when a very outgoing man literally saves their life. He takes them to his place where he promises to fix their car and get them out of there. Although the man seems a little ""off,"" they seem to be in no danger and the three then fall asleep peacefully.What happens next is a chair gripping, jumpy ride.

Maybe the instant gratification crowd doesn't like to see a little bit of time taken on character development, but I liked the idea.  These three college kids were actually given personalities and could have been like someone you went to school and partied with yourself.  Another nice twist, there were only three protagonists, so once the horror begins, there's really no telling who is going to live or die, or if anyone will make it out of there to tell the story.There have also been some negative reviews given regarding the shakiness and graininess of the camera work, but it really doesn't detract from the film in anyway, if anything, it kind of gives it a documentary feel.  For those who either loved or hated or are at all familiar with The Blair Witch Project, that's the kind of feel the camera work in this film protrays.All in all, this was a great film.

I actually thought about buying it right after it came out, but then decided against it because you really never can tell if a horror movie is worth buying just by looking at its packaging.  We found that out with Cabin Fever.  Not that that movie was absolutely terrible or anything, I just didn't think it was worth $22!!So anyway, someone recommended I see it, so we rented it the other night.  It was kind of slow getting started, but it wasn't unbearable.  My biggest issue with this was that it was sometimes hard to understand/hear what the people were saying.  This is probably partly due to the fact that they have pretty strong accents, and also partly due to the fact that we watched it on our PC and the sound only goes up so loud!  So I'm not saying that everyone who watches will have this problem!The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes the terror that much more terrifying.  That someone out there is actually doing these things to people is absolutely crazy.  Because of this, I discovered I had another big issue with this movie.  Don't get me wrong, if you can watch this sort of thing - like, watch people be tortured, then you will like this movie just fine.  I couldn't watch it.  I wanted to, and I've watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre (old and new) and other movies along these lines and have made it the whole way through.  Maybe I couldn't watch because these actors were actually believable - they conveyed the terror they were feeling more realistically than any other actor in a movie of this genre.  It was too real...I'm really curious about how this movie ended, and I'm going to find that out later - by asking someone - not by actually watching!I would recommend this to horror movie fans.  But I think there are horror movie fans, and then there are horror movie fans who also like torture movies.  So, if you fall into the latter group, you should see this movie.  You most likely won't be disappointed.***My 4 star rating is given only because I paid money to see this movie but couldn't finish it.

Slow burnning terror doesn't even fit because there is not a hint that things will go awry as the characters are introduced and then they embark on their journey. A road trip that offers nothing new and exciting as they take turns driving and sleeping all equals to a rather dull lead-in to theshockfest that this film is supposed to be.Once the stranger enters the picture, things start to go to a darker place, although that takes a bit too. The man is just too friendly and hardly ominous to even make the thought that he's a mass murderer cross your mind. Of course, he is not a nice guy and when the three travelers arrive at his camp, they are subjected to various degrees of torture. This film is bloody, but not overtly so. It isn't as shocking as it was indicated by critics but it still ahs its shocking charms. The two ladies are of more interest to the killer which leads to some intense chase scenes and the obligatory moments where the damsel in distress wastes time looking at pictures of other victims instead of trying to escape. Waht happens to the three young adults is scary in a way and then yawn inducing in another only because the cliches are all visited. Still, props go to all three for utilizing various degrees of intellegence in times of danger. Although they are scared, they are not entirely stupid.I do feel that this film ended rather abruptly.

642134,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00005JON3,General Zombie,"[195, 226]","As per usual, there have been a great many moronic things said about this movie.  Some critics have been offended by it, but don't let that make you think this is some sorta gorefest.  The violence is intense and reasonably graphic, but it's certainly not gory in the conventional sense.  I find it amusing that those who were offended by the film have more or less said that it was too horrifying, cause ya know, god forbid that someone actually be horrified by a horror movie.  They've also said it is misogynistic, just like they've said about every other slasher movie ever. (Slasher movie isn't entirely appropriate for describing this, but it's as good as we'll get.)  This is a particularly irritating complaint, first because they always say this, second because it's a bullcrap non-argument evasion intended to avoid any real analysis, and finally because it isn't true.  In fact, it's even less true here than it usually is, cause the film doesn't make the killer into the hero.  Yes, bad things happen to the women in this film, but we AREN'T supposed to be happy about it.  And, of course, very bad things happen to men in the film as well, but who the hell cares about them anyway? Everyone knows that women are much, much more important than men.  I also think it's interesting that the killer is a fat, greasy dude from out in the country, as they so often are in this sorta movie, yet it has not been accused of being bigoted against rural people, nor has any horror movie I've ever heard of.  What a bizarre coincidence.  Wonder why critics don't seem to care about those sorts of people.  Maybe they really think that they all are killers. I dunno.But, critical idiocy aside, this is a very nicely done horror film.  The plot is simplicity itself- 3 youths are captured and tormented by a backwoods psychopath while vacationing near Wolf Creek in Australia.  Subplots are rarely of interest in slasher films, and 'Wolf Creek' fortunately has none of them.  Still, with the very small cast we get to know these characters quite a bit better than we usually would in a slasher film, and they are certainly far more likable than the hot young teens of the American slasher revival.  (Of course that doesn't mean much, as said hot young teens are usually loathsome.)'Wolf Creek' was really made on the cheap, only about 1 million bucks, I hear, and it's certainly got a rough, gritty look.  Some people claim that grainy, DV films with handheld cameras are more realistic, which makes precisely no sense as life is not especially grainy, and I tend to hold my head fairly still. However, this technique can allow for a greater sorta intensity and physicality, which works well here.  Despite the generally rough visuals, it's still got some rather beautiful cinematography at times, and the great Australian deserts are a fine backdrop for such events.Yeah, the film does take a while to get going, certainly longer than is necessary, but seriously, are you guys all 3 years old or what?  Go out in the lobby and drink your juice and then go potty, and then it'll almost be time for the killing to start.  The acting is extremely good for a film with this kinda budget.  The 3 leads all do a fine job, with some fairly authentic, if not exactly fascinating, casual banter in the first half of the film.  Still, the second half is much more important, and they play it a bit different from most horror films, which is largely why this bothers so many critics.  In most horror movies, none of the characters are ever authentically terrified.  They're pretty nervous and jumpy and may let out a scream before they die, but they're pretty much in control.  Not so here, as Magrath and Morassi spend much of the latter part of the movie in near hysterics, and are utterly convincing, with two of the finest performances of this sort since Marilyn Burns' classic turn in the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.  John Jarrat is also excellent as the killer.  They use a trick which is fairly common, in that we are introduced to him as if he were a normal character, who seems amiable enough, if a bit odd, and we then slowly see his violent side revealed.  It's an old trick, but a good one, and it works especially well here, aided by his Australian accent, which are always inherently non-threatening to me, for some reason.  He does get to be a bit wisecracking at times, but never to the point which he becomes the hero of the film.Many will say this has an anticlimactic ending, and while I can't help but agree with this to some degree, it's also kind of interesting in that it is so different from what you'd usually see in this sorta film.  The small cast also makes it quite a bit less predictable, as most slasher movies have the few central characters who will obviously survive, along with plenty of cannon fodder.  With only 3 main characters there just aren't enough people to allow any meaningless little kills stuffed in at the beginning, and it's tougher to predict the order in which they will be offed.Though I'm sure many of you are sick of hearing this, `Wolf Creek' really is a throwback to the more intense horror films of the 70's like `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `The Hills Have Eyes'.  It's got an intensity and seriousness that is almost inevitably lacking from later slasher movies, and the old rough and violent feeling.  As such, it certainly isn't for everyone, as many people seem to only like gentle, feel-good horror or conventional gorefests.  But, it you've got a taste for something darker and more intense, `Wolf Creek' is definitely worth a look.Grade: A-  (This is after watching it again on DVD, and determining that it was even better than I'd thought initially.  I'd change the rating to a 5, if I could.)",4,Very solid low-budget horror,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,5762,"['per', 'usual', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'many', 'moronic', 'things', 'said', 'movie',

The entire first half of the film could have been edited down to about two scenes and thus cut out useless and boring expositional material.Two British girls and an Aussie boy, all decent, if not snarky but not particularly bad, travel across the outback of Australia (why I don't remember being told) to get to a town inland. In a story not unreminscent of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" they come to a bad end.The second half of the film isn't particularly unique although it is filmed well and the acting isn't horrible. However, the script, maybe in an effort to prove its ""Blair Witch"" ""reality"" credentials, doesn't inform us about some of the background information on our killer that would make this film more frightening. We just know the killer's been at it a long time and no one has ever stopped him.Still, it's not as emotionally taxing as ""Chainsaw Massacre"", which let us become emotionally invested in the characters without almost an hour of very boring expositional material. I recommend fast forwarding this DVD until the three kids actually reach ""Wolf Creek"" at night.

The most terrifying aspect of the story is that it is based on true incidents, incidents in Australia that carry the same degree of impact as the Manson murders or the Hillside Strangler.  Murder and Madness are well married.A lively group of young daring travelers decide to take a camping trip to explore some fascinating regions of Australia, such as the crater site that is one of the largest in the world. We get to know lovable Ben (Nathan Phillips) and spunky Liz (Cassandra Magrath) and Kristy (Kestie Morassi) as they set out on the highway for an adventure only to backpack into one of their destinations and return to find their car won't start and their watches have stopped.  A friendly older gent Mick (John Jarret) stops to give them a hand and tows them to his ranch - and the story really begins. In continued scenes of seat-grabbing terror each of the three discover just how evil Mick is, and each is taken captive in different ways, tortured and well, to tell more would be to destroy the plot.Director Greg McLean takes his time in the first portion of the film, leading us to believe that this may be just another outback road trip with love interests, humor, and minor conflicts. But when he introduces Mick he alters the look and the style of the film, opting for some of the most magnificent vistas of Australia as the background for some of the more grisly depictions of horror on film.  The camera work (Will Gibson) is terrific and the musical score by Frank Tetaz adds to the mix of terror and madness. The actors all turn in fine performances: Nathan Phillips is a welcome new persona on the screen and John Jarret becomes one of the most realistic and repulsive of bad guys ever created on film.As long as you know what you're in for, this is a fast moving scary movie that will hold you to your seat and make you check your doors and windows for closure before going to bed!

However, after the initial scenes which get the movie off to a slow start (though camera trickery is used to attempt to overcome this problem), the movie actually begins.Once the movie truly starts, and the basic plot lines are established (character tension, etc.), the movie sucked me in, grabbed me by the gonads, and didn't let go.  Once the Freddy Kruger of Australia enters the story, all hell breaks loose.I was very surprised by the gruesome and horrific scenes in this movie.

642139,AMYXKFBZEBXLP,B00005JON3,G. Smith,"[5, 6]","Wolf Creek is a movie to unoriginal to be a brilliant coming of to much like an Australian Texas Chainsaw Massacre. On the plus side it is very well made, filmed on a very low budget the film looks terrific. The characters while nothing outstanding are well played by the three young actors. The film takes it's time to get to it's horror, around 40 minutes which I think will put off many horror fans. While many may be put off by the sadistic violence inflicted upon the three characters in the film. I wont spoil anything about the deaths or the villain's identity, many of you will already know. Much of the violence is cruel and very brutal, made worse by the fact that we've had 40 minutes to get know these characters, though this is hardly a flaw and was obviously intended by the director.The torture genre appears to be a new sub-genre of horror movie, similar to that of the slasher or monster genre. I must say as a long time horror fan I am not keen on this new development. The horror movies Saw, Saw 2, and Hostel just like wolf creek wallow in the sadism and unpleasantness of the deaths making it both hard to watch and enjoy these types of horror movies. On the other hand I did buy Wolf Creek and have watched it a couple of times, finding it to be far superior to the 2003 remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

Wolf Creek...wow I'm still trying to catch my breath.

They come to find out they have a car that will not start when they go to return home the next day.  That is when things seem to be going in the right direction for the trio.  Next thing you know they are in luck!  Some guy in his 50's who is nice like grandpa is here to help them!  He gives them a tow to his place...and that is where the nightmare begins!  Despite being basicallly a low budget Australian film I thought this movie was very well done and also very realistic.  Based on true events from the outback, its full of terror, suspense, chase scenes, and feelings of utter, total helplessness!

So we said ""hey lets go see Wolf Creek. Its supposed to be pretty scary."" So we packed up the car and made the trip to the theater. At least it was a chance to get out of the house. So, the movie starts off with these three 20-something year olds going on a party road trip across the Australian outback. One of the places they stop at is a place called Wolf Creek, which has the largest meteorite crater. They hike through it and come back to discover that their car is not working. Stuck in the middle of no where they wait and lucky for them someone just happens to be driving by. He stops, figures out what is wrong with their car and offers to tow them back to his place and fix it. They fall asleep on their way there and awaken when they arrive. Of course they have no idea where they are and as the stranger begins fixing their car they once again pass out.This time when one of the girls awakens she discovers she is tied up and in a locked shed. After many hours she is able to free herself and get out of the shed looking for her friends, only to discover that her other friend being tortured and has been obviously raped and the stranger is having a fun time doing it. She is able to save her friend but not for very long. I will stop there so I won't not give away the whole movie. This movie was not good and it wasn't bad it was just, here ya go watch this! This movie is based on the Australian Backpack killer, Ivan Milat. Ivan killed about nine people in the early 90s. I just found out this information not too long ago. Its not that I didn't believe the whole ""based on a true events"" thing, but they didn't really tell you much in the movie. The movie is more like an exaggeration of the true events. From what I have read they had to delay the screening of the movie until the trial of Bradley John Murdoch ended. Bradley was accused of killing a British backpacker. So, I suppose the movie is a combination of both of these killers.It takes way too long to get to the point of what the movie is about. The majority of the movie is about the three people partying, driving, and hiking. Only within the last 40 minutes do you see some blood and gore. I did like the character of Mick Taylor played by John Jarrett. He really did seem like the kind of guy you could trust easily until he turns on you. Probably what made me really mad was in the previews they all rave about how nothing has been this scary since Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This movie reminded me nothing of TCM, this movie reminded me more of High Tension and High Tension is definitely the better film. The only thing that reminded me at all of Texas Chainsaw with this that this movie had the whole documentary look of it.

642146,A1ZRO681DK4NC4,B00005JON3,HorrorFilms101,"[1, 3]","So what can I say about this movie? Well, not a whole whole lot. It's a decent movie. It follows a nice thriller and it has some captivating moments. However, I feel that the reality was obscured simply by the characters and their poor intellectual decision making. What do I mean by this? Let's take a look at the film and what I personally thought about it.I think that first of all, it starts out great. It takes a bit to get everything rolling, but the set-up works well, and once we finally get into the deeper, more terrifying moments, we tend to get a nice glimpse into the sadistic world of the backpack killer. Now this was based on a real killer, but I'm sure that the actual victims had a little bit more of an IQ, and I would imagine that the killer probably did as well.Plot: Ok, well serial killer, we got that much. I think that it was pretty decent. But it surely isn't anything new and this whole serial killer, stalker, idea has been done to death. I really don't think that you'll find anything here that hasn't been seen or attempted before. It's a one, two, three, I love to kill for fun spree that seems to have originated directly from the good old Friday the 13th films way back in the day. The story does provide you with a few interesting ideas, but in general, once things go bad, you're just running around like a chicken with your head cut-off.Characters: Seriously, when you're in a room full of guns and ammo, you find something useful. Not to mention that when the killer is down, you make sure he stays that way. You don't take time to wipe your nose, tears, or smell the flowers. You make sure that you get the job done. I found the characters to be extremely unrealistic, and I think that alone destroyed the movie for me. Though I do realize that smart characters are extremely rare in these types of films, so I've learned to deal with it and accept it. The acting, and so forth was rather well done, and I feel that was at least a blessing in terms of a budget film.Environment: I thought that this was really nice. Something rather new in terms of horror films. Set in the australian outback, it's a new feel, and new way of placing some teenagers stranded out in the middle of nowhere. I liked the emptiness that they were able to achieve with this location.The other elements such as music, camera work, lighting, and so on were all pretty much standard. Though I heard that this was an independent film, it looks like a feature from hollywood, minus a few technical areas. I think that the film worked despite a few natural flaws, and some rather uninspiring script writing. I found myself relatively interested, and think that it was definitely worth a rental....might even consider seeing it again if I was forced to.Overall, it blends into the mass of serial killer films as an average achievement, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's worth spending the big bucks on. If you're a serial killer fan, it's one to add to the collection, but if you're just a general horror fan, rent it first.",3,Killing the average killer movie,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,3043,"['what', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'Well', 'not', 'whole', 'whole', 'lot', 'decent', 'movie', 'nice', 'thriller', 'captivating', 'moments', 'However', 'feel', 'reality', 'was', 'obscured', 'simply', 'characters', 'poor', 'intellectual', 'decision', 'making', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'Let', 'take', 'look', 'film', 'what', 'personally', 'thought', 'it.I', 'think', 'first', 'out', 'great', 'bit', 'get', 'everything', 'rolling', 'set-up', 'works', 'well', 'once', 'finally', 'get', 'deeper', 'more', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'tend', 'get', 'nice', 'glimpse', 'sadistic', 'world', 'backpack', 'killer', 'Now', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'killer', ""'m"", 'sure', 'actual', 'victims', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'IQ', 'would', 'imagine', 'killer', 'probably', 'did', 'well.Plot', 'Ok', 'well', 'serial', 'killer', 'got', 'much', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'surely', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'whole', 'serial', 'killer', 'stalker', 'idea', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'anything', 'here', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'attempted', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'love', 'kill', 'fun', 'spree', 'have', 'originated', 'directly', 'good', 'old', 'Friday', '13th', 'films', 'way', 'back', 'day', 'story', 'provide', 'few', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'general', 'once', 'things', 'go', 'bad', ""'re"", 'just', 'running', 'around', 'chicken', 'head', 'cut-off.Characters', 'Seriously', 'when', ""'re"", 'room', 'full', 'guns', 'ammo', 'find', 'something', 'useful', 'Not', 'mention', 'when', 'killer', 'down', 'make', 'sure', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'wipe', 'nose', 'tears', 'smell', 'flowers', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'extremely', 'unrealistic', 'think', 'alone', 'destroyed', 'movie', 'do', 'realize', 'smart', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'rare', 'types', 'films', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'deal', 'accept', 'acting', 'so', 'forth', 'was', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'feel', 'was', 'least', 'blessing', 'terms', 'budget', 'film.Environment', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'Something', 'rather', 'new', 'terms', 'horror', 'films', 'Set', 'australian', 'outback', 'new', 'feel', 'new', 'way', 'placing', 'teenagers', 'stranded', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'liked', 'emptiness', 'were', 'able', 'achieve', 'location.The', 'other', 'elements', 'such', 'music', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'so', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'heard', 'was', 'independent', 'film', 'feature', 'hollywood', 'few', 'technical', 'areas', 'think', 'film', 'worked', 'few', 'natural', 'flaws', 'rather', 'uninspiring', 'script', 'writing', 'found', 'relatively', 'interested', 'think', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental', '.might', 'even', 'consider', 'seeing', 'again', 'was', 'forced', 'to.Overall', 'mass', 'serial', 'killer', 'films', 'average', 'achievement', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'worth', 'spending', 'big', 'bucks', ""'re"", 'serial', 'killer', 'fan', 'one', 'add', 'collection', ""'re"", 'just', 'general', 'horror', 'fan', 'rent', 'first']",N/A
642147,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B00005JON3,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 2]","In ""Wolf Creek"", a trio of backpacking friends decide to venture to a deserted location in the middle of nowhere to go sight-seeing. While things seem fine at first, it becomes apparent that this become a story of the wrong place at the wrong time. In the interest of not spoiling the story, suffice it to say that the movie is not what it appears to be, at least ostensibly. That being said, the movie does begin to take a dark, brutal, and morbid shape by movie's end.In a sense, the movie attempts to provide some light misdirection as to what the audience is seeing at first, albeit quite weakly, with a trio of friends engaging upon an adventurous trip out in the middle of a deserted Australian location. A sense of desolation, isolation and desertedness becomes apparent to the audience, and the viewer is able to understand that if something happens to a person in this type of place, the prevailing thought will be, who's going to know or do anything about it? The desolate setting is a precursor of things to come in this movie and sets the tone for the despondency and dejection the protagonists will eventually experience in this deserted part of the country.""Wolf Creek"" delves into the horror of becoming captive of someone who is not what he appears to be, someone who is cruel, evil and hateful, but appears to be nice, helpful and a good ole boy at first...this is effective in showing the audience that people are not always what they appear to be.The protagonists or supposedly good characters in this movie ultimately experience the feeling of being powerless to control their own life while being subject to the disgusting and bestial pleasures of a maniacal killer out in the middle of nowhere and there is no one to help them. Imagine being unconscious and waking up confined in an unfamiliar location without the friends you were with originally and not knowing of their whereabouts or their well-being. Imagine hearing or observed the pure suffering of one of those friends at the hands of someone you thought was going to help you. These are the ideas of horror that ""Wolf Creek"" utilizes quite effectively by putting the viewer in the position of the characters which is certainly realistic and terrifying with the character's individual situation in and of itself.The acting is average at best in ""Wolf Creek"". John Jarret does an OUTSTANDING job (and really makes the movie good) as the villain; Jarret is clever at showing that monsters do not always appears to be monsters at first but appear just like everyday normal people, and he certainly does well for the Australian theme and setting. However, the protagonists (even if they are ordinary) are somewhat poorly casted and they are not very good actors, and that does bring the movie down a bit in my opinion because the protagonists are difficult to sympathize with except for the dark haired girl who did a decent job I guess, and their inept acting ability as a whole is a direct result of the audience's inability to sympathize with such characters. Aside from that, these protagonists are just a unlikeable lot, and difficult to relate to--at least for my generation.  But, perhaps that's just it, a generation gap...alas, I digress.Certainly, ""Wolf Creek"" breaks all of the horror movie rules so you never know what to expect, and this is most definitely a good thing. However, ""Wolf Creek"" fails to do enough with the horror that it initially creates. The setting is good, but once the viewer realizes the situation, the action that follows is completely overshadowed by the setting and situational horror used so well to set things up. In other words, the movie begins to go downhill in the subsequent action...the acting is definitely lacking, and as I alluded to above, the protagonist characters are rather difficult to sympathize with and they don't do a very good job of portraying the character's human reactions and emotions to such an ordeal.The cat and mouse game that follows has its moments but is rather poorly done overall and lacking in substance and in style. Perhaps the style and mood or lack thereof is where the movie suffers the most.  However, for its faults, ""Wolf Creek"" does a decent job of sneaking up on you, and then it is BAMM right in your face. Clearly, ""Wolf Creek"" is weak on atmosphere and stylistic elements of cinematic horror, but ""Wolf Creek"" is definitely a good horror movie for today's standards, but one of the main problems with that statement is that today's horror movies have no standards.Relative to classic horror movies of yesteryear and some of the greatest horror movies of all-time, ""Wolf Creek"" clearly fails to measure up, but ""Wolf Creek"" is still a good situational horror film representative of new age horror at its very best, possesses its own charm and survives on its own merit as a horror movie that attempts to attack a basic fear that we all have as individuals, that of being in helpless in an unfamiliar area with no one to help you and completely at the mercy (or lack thereof) of a maniacal and sadistic killer. That's pretty real folks, and ""Wolf Creek"" does a decent job of bringing this home to the audience. ""Wolf Creek"" earns almost THREE STARS on my grading scale, but I'm feeling like Santa Claus today, so keep that in mind when reading this review.As a final note, ""Wolf Creek"" is supposed to be based (probably very loosely) on the true story of a brutal and sadistic killer in Australia some years ago. I saw a supposedly real picture of this killer online after looking this story up, and the way he looked in real life made John Jarret look like Santa Claus. Also, personally, I should point out that I found the ending of ""Wolf Creek"" to be a bit anticlimactic and disappointing, and this has noting to do with the dark nature of the ending but more to do with the ending and climax being overshadowed by the increasing action and initial setting of the situational horror that is employed so well in ""Wolf Creek"".",3,2.99 STARS:  Pretty good for today's

642154,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JON3,Jason,"[3, 3]","When traveling through Australia, two British chicks (sheilas), Liz and Christy, meet a moronic Aussie bloke named Ben.  The three decide to take a trip to Wolf(e) Creek National Park, a remote meteorite crater in the Australian wilderness.  Prior to their long trip Ben decides to get their wheels: a beat up, red wagon monstrosity costing $1500 quid.  Brilliant - buy a used rust-bucket for a trek into the barren, remote outback.  Ben eats soup with a fork.  After their arrival at Wolf(e) Creek, with the subsequent hike being over, their P.O.S. car doesn't start.  Of course it doesn't.  Luckily, they meet a friendly bushman named Mick (John Jarrat).Mick seems friendly enough, in a pedophiliac, overweight, clich&eacute;d Crocodile Dundee sort of way, sporting a harsh Australian accent, a filthy akubra, and gloriously huge mutton chops.  He attempts to fix their beater, and then eventually tows it to his secluded camp: an abandoned mine site.  With complete trust the three travelers, completely unaware of their surroundings, without a reliable mode of transportation, and having only known their friendly mechanic for a few hours, decide to relax and go to sleep.  No worries.It turns out they were drugged, and Mick's time in the wilderness has made him go troppo and lonely; the roos only provide so much love.  Liz wakes up bound and gagged in a closet, her friends nowhere in site but experiencing presumably similar predicaments.  Let the Aussie version of hillbilly torture porn begin!For the most part it's a typical horror movie throughout, a cross between Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes.  There were a few moments when the victims did something smart, making me think, ""Good onya!""  Unfortunately for them, however, they revert to retarded, and the carnage begins anew.  (The ridiculously bad decisions are the main negative aspect of the movie)The filming and scenery are very beautiful at times, reminding everyone what a beautiful country Australia is, with stunning wide-angle looks at the Wolfe Creek Crater, and spectacular, multi-colored sunsets.  Conversely, there are scenes with almost indie tones to them, with possible retro-horror tribute to 70s horror flicks' close-ups.  The acting is pretty much average for the tearful trio, with a few good screams.  Mick, however, is abso-bloodly-lutely brilliant.  One moment he's sadistically cheery, and the next eerily creepy.  He's a gleeful madman, laughing and taunting his prey like a child charring an ant with a magnifying glass.With a tense buildup and an evil haze throughout, it's better than most of the garbage Hollywood steals from Japan and passes off as horror nowadays.  It's definitely worthy a horror fan's viewing, and probably a good bet for casual fans.(This review brought to you with random Aussie slang.)",3,Australia Chainsaw Massacre,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,2822,"['When', 'traveling', 'Australia', 'two', 'British', 'chicks', 'sheilas', 'Liz', 'Christy', 'meet', 'moronic', 'Aussie', 'bloke', 'named', 'Ben', 'three', 'decide', 'take', 'trip', 'Wolf', 'e', 'Creek', 'National', 'Park', 'remote', 'meteorite', 'crater', 'Australian', 'wilderness', 'Prior', 'long', 'trip', 'Ben', 'get', 'wheels', 'beat', 'up', 'red', 'wagon', 'monstrosity', 'costing', '1500', 'quid', 'Brilliant', 'buy', 'used', 'rust-bucket', 'trek', 'barren', 'remote', 'outback', 'Ben', 'soup', 'fork', 'arrival', 'Wolf', 'e', 'Creek', 'subsequent', 'hike', 'being', 'P.O.S', 'car', ""n't"", 'start', 'course', ""n't"", 'Luckily', 'meet', 'friendly', 'bushman', 'named', 'Mick', 'John', 'Jarrat', '.Mick', 'friendly', 'enough', 'pedophiliac', 'overweight', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'sort', 'way', 'sporting', 'harsh', 'Australian', 'accent', 'filthy', 'akubra', 'gloriously', 'huge', 'mutton', 'chops', 'fix', 'beater', 'then', 'eventually', 'secluded', 'camp', 'abandoned', 'mine', 'site', 'complete', 'trust', 'three', 'travelers', 'completely', 'surroundings', 'reliable', 'mode', 'transportation', 'having', 'only', 'known', 'friendly', 'mechanic', 'few', 'hours', 'decide', 'relax', 'go', 'sleep', 'worries.It', 'out', 'were', 'drugged', 'Mick', 'time', 'wilderness', 'made', 'go', 'troppo', 'lonely', 'roos', 'only', 'provide', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'Liz', 'up', 'bound', 'gagged', 'closet', 'friends', 'nowhere', 'site', 'experiencing', 'presumably', 'similar', 'predicaments', 'Let', 'Aussie', 'version', 'hillbilly', 'torture', 'porn', 'begin', 'most', 'part', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'cross', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'victims', 'did', 'something', 'smart', 'making', 'think', 'Good', 'onya', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'revert', 'retarded', 'carnage', 'anew', 'ridiculously', 'bad', 'decisions', 'are', 'main', 'negative', 'aspect', 'movie', 'filming', 'scenery', 'are', 'very', 'beautiful', 'times', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'what', 'beautiful', 'country', 'Australia', 'stunning', 'wide-angle', 'looks', 'Wolfe', 'Creek', 'Crater', 'spectacular', 'multi-colored', 'sunsets', 'Conversely', 'are', 'scenes', 'almost', 'indie', 'tones', 'possible', 'retro-horror', 'tribute', '70s', 'horror', 'flicks', 'close-ups', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'average', 'tearful', 'trio', 'few', 'good', 'screams', 'Mick', 'however', 'abso-bloodly-lutely', 'brilliant', 'One', 'moment', 'sadistically', 'cheery', 'next', 'eerily', 'creepy', 'gleeful', 'madman', 'laughing', 'taunting', 'prey', 'child', 'charring', 'ant', 'magnifying', 'glass.With', 'tense', 'buildup', 'evil', 'haze', 'better', 'most', 'garbage', 'Hollywood', 'steals', 'Japan', 'off', 'horror', 'nowadays', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'horror', 'fan', 'viewing', 'probably', 'good', 'bet', 'casual', 'fans', 'review', 'brought', 'random', 'Aussie', 'slang']",N/A
642155,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B00005JON3,Jason W. Kaiser,"[3, 3]","Solid horror movie here people, well acted, good scares, decent suspense, beautifully shot, all in all a rather nice surprise. I remember seeing the previews some time last year and thinkin' that this had some potential. I then read up on the 'true events' that the movie was based on and it does give you a few chills when you think about it. In the early 90's seven hikers/backpackers were murdered in the Australian outback, it seems he liked to let them go after he caught and tortured them because he was fascinated with the 'chase'. Just remember this movie is loosely based on true events, most of it is just the deranged and psychotic antics of the director and writers, gotta love 'em.Three hikers travel to Wolf Creek to check out a stretch of land where a meteor crashed some years back, after a good hike and some makin' out they realize they can't leave 'cuz guess what? you got it, the old car-is-broke-in-the-middle-of-nowhere situation (really stretchin' the artistic mind there aren't they?) Anyway, along comes Mick Taylor, a dirty, scruffy old bushman who tells them he can fix it, but the parts are at his place. Much to everyone's surprise our young hikers agree to head on back to his place, and our fun is soon beginning. Seems Mick's 'pad' is an abandoned mine, real fixer-upper let me tell you. Then around the campfire during storytime, Mick drugs each one and they all wake up hours later alone and tied up.Our first victim is Liz, played by Cassandra Magrath, I'm not to familiar with her work, but she does a splendid job, great screamer and a pretty tough chick too!! She wakes up all tied up in this little room, she is able to free herself, but right before she decides to make a break for it she hears a terrifying scream coming from her best friend and victim #2, Kristy, also played very well by Kestie Morassi. This scream sent chills down my back people, I'm not kidding, a scream of complete suffering and horror. Liz soon finds Kristy being tortured rather brutally by Mick (this scene is not for the squeamish) Kristy and Liz then have a cat and mouse game With Mick for the next hour trying to escape, I won't tell you what happens to them but they do a superb lead-in to our last victim Ben, who is nailed to a cross, but he too also manages to escape. Ben is played by Nathan Phillips, although not as strong a performance as the ladies, he does an above-average job as well.The thing that really got me was how 'real' the two ladies were, the pain and suffering they feel you feel too. The absolute struggle between life and death is brilliantly played out by all involved, and that alone makes it a cut above the usual slashers. Another reason it works so well is John Jarratt playing Mick Taylor, what a complete psycho, and he hams it up like you wouldn't believe. I'm not sure how many of you saw the movie High Tension, but Jarratt's performance ranks right up there with the leading lady from that excellent horror movie as well. At first he comes across as this Crocodile Dundee type, then you see this dark and uncaring soul who totally gets off on pain and torture.This isn't as gory and graphic as everyone is saying, yes there is some, but it's not nearly as bad as Devil's Rejects or even High Tension. It gets you more with it's gritty realism, strong suspense and a building sense of dread as the movie wears on. Wolf Creek is so beautifully shot, the scenery and locations are incredible. All the scenes of the Australian mountains, sunsets, desert hi-way's are so colorfull and bright, but yet perfectly balanced with the dreary, grainy feel and look of Mick's mine and torture rooms.

The plot description is the basis of this movie so I won't bore you with that all over again.Horror movies that are based on true events make them even more eerie.

Just when you think you have it figured out and are rooting for the victim(s) something else happens.  There are alot of twists along the way.I highly recommend this movie, if not a purchase a must rent!  A movie that will give you the chills just knowing that this is based on true occurances.

He soon realizes that he was ripped off, as the car is constantly breaking down at the worst possible times.  The trio is on their way to see the Wolf Creek meteor crater, which is located in the depths of the Australian Outback.  The group arrives at their destination, they park the car, and begin the hike to the crater.  After spending several hours in the rain gazing at the crater, they begin the journey back to their car to continue on with their journey.  Upon arriving, they find that the car won't start.  Resigned to spending the night in the car, the three settle in as best as they can.Soon, Ben spots headlights in the distance and getting closer.  Unsure, Ben and the girls go to investigate.  They are met by Mick Taylor (John Jarratt), a big, back slapping bushman.  Mick offers to tow the car back to is workshop and fix it.  Happily, Ben, Liz, and Kristie agree, thinking that their ordeal in the Outback is finally over.  Unfortunately for them, its just about to begin.  Mick is not the friendly mechanic they thought he was.  Instead, he turns out to be a sadistic killer who enjoys using hunting rifles and knives.

642160,A9LSLYQW28X6H,B00005JON3,Jeff Van Gastel,"[2, 2]","Wolf Creek is a great, intense horror film from Australia! Implant any deranged,psycho American film hillbilly into Crocodile Dundee, and you get Mick, the Wolf Creek villain.The movie begins innocently enough with 3 friends(Ben, Kristy, and Liz) leaving for a cross-country trip to the Outback of Australia.  They arrive at Wolf Creek National Park, where a meteor crashed and formed a crater some years ago.  After a hike to the crater, they arrive back to their car to find it does not start.  Nightime comes, and the 3 are huddled in the car waiting for someone to come by.  Sure enough, in the middle of the night, lights come closer to reveal a truck with a friendly Outbacker named Mick.  Mick gives them the choice of waiting until the morning for someone else to come by, or he will be ""nice"" enough to take them back to his place so he can fix their car.  They go back with them, and then wake up the next day to find themselves tied up or nailed to the wall.  The movie then takes off at rapid pace, as we follow what happens to our 3 good guys.I agree with many of the reviewers about the slow pace of the first half of the movie.  However, it did not bother me that much, as the film made me care about them more, especially as Mick later hunts them down.  The filmmakers definitely throw in some twists, that I was not expecting. From watching enough horror movies, you can usually figure out what happens.  But, one particular death caught me way off-guard!  Watch it and see! You will know it.  I will also agree to a certain extent that the ending was anti-climatic after an intense second half of the film.  But, I was okay with it.Mick, played by John Jarratt, is absolutely brilliant as the villain.  He is one creepy looking guy.  If someone like that came up to me out in the desert, I would definitely have 2nd thoughts.  He also has one of the creepiest laughs/chuckles that you will see in cinema.  When you watch it, you will know what I mean.  Pure diabolical evil with a twisted sense of humor, as he likes to play with his prey.  I enjoyed the performances of the other 3 actors, especially of Liz, played by Cassandra Magrath.  She did a great job, but I am pretty sure I would not have made some of the choices that she did!  And the one thing that drives me crazy about horror movies, is when you shoot or club someone who wants to kill you and they are laying on the ground seemingly dead, just take the extra 5 seconds and put the final bullet in the head, or stick the knife through his/her/its brain!  But then, I guess we would not get sequels in the film world.The Special Features on the unrated version are pretty thin.  There is Commentary by the Director and 2 actresses of the film.  Also, there is a ""Making of Wolf Creek"" that runs 49:00.  The most entertaining parts of the making of, where with Mick(John Jarratt).  He is a pretty interesting character off film also.  There is also a Deleted Scene which was very bad and was rightfully not in the movie, and the Theatrical Trailer for Wolf Creek.I am glad I read some of the reviews here and bought the movie!

642161,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JON3,J from NY,"[1, 5]","Things must be in a really sorry way with the horror genre if ""Wolf Creek"" is the new ""must see"".  I thought they already made ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; and if enough people wanted to see it done with Australian accents, I'm sure Tobe Hooper would have obliged for the right price.I'm sure the director didn't expect so much acclaim, as he wisely decided to play the ""Based On True Events"" card (it is very loosely based on two different incidents, neither of which occured in the Australian outback.)This isn't a terrible movie, but there is nothing in it to set it apart from a billion others of the same ilk.  Three young people who want fun fun fun wander into the wrong place and are brutalized by a psychotic killer.  The protagonists (not really protagonists, more like three pieces of convenient prey) are three Swedish backpackers who get drunk, smoke weed, swim in pools, and go on about failed romances when the Big Bad Guy comes along to deliver the inevitable message these kind of movies carry: if you take too much of a risk, you get chopped up for your daring.  The painfully long time we spend with the guy (who might have been an extra on ""Jackass"") and the two young women tell us little about them except that they are cut whole cloth from the stereotype of ""youth"" in society and are innocents who have done nothing wrong.The killer, Mick Taylor, is a cross between a sadistic killer, failed Elvis impersonator (those muttonchops add a bit of comedy to everything he does, however gruesome), and failed comedian.  His attempts to humorous and terrifying at the same time fail miserably with the sombre mood of the movie.There is one geuinely funny part, though: before he drugs the three with his special water, he takes offense at something the young guy says and gives him a rooster look as though he had been buggered by Popeye himself.  I nearly hit the theater floor laughing when that scene came up.More less, this is your typical slasher movie.

Unfortunately, Marketing companies know that movie was the lowest budget-highest grossing film in 3 decades, and so they bill any low budget film as the next TCM.So yes, the Wolf Creek is low budget, it is raw, and the horror is realistic...The similarities stop there other than the fact that Wolf Creek spends the first 3 reels of the film developing character (and to those of you who criticize this while flying your ""I'm a Texas Chainsaw Massacre fan"" flag - watch the first 30-40 mins of TCM and tell me how many people die in it)Wolf Creek is savage and brutal, it does not have the circus/gore feel of Devil's Rejects or Saw II. And though I think High Tension is a decent comparison - in terms of darkness and brutality - I found Wolf Creek to be more disturbing. The death-scenes left me uncomfortable and uneasy which I havn't legitimately felt since first watching Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.

It is here where the fun ends and the horror begins for our three friends that is cunningly split into sections so at no time are we ever in a safe pack again, but travel alone in an unforgiving dark harsh landscape, with an ever-present realism that could make anyone's skin crawl. Can anyone escape alive without being strewn and splattered across the harsh landscape? How did this chaos begin? The answers lie early on in the film, and come clearer as the film progresses.This can be a hard film to watch. I saw it because it is based in part on the backpacker murders of Ivan Milat from 1989-1992 and they caught him. Maybe the same would happen here. The lone screaming figure of the woman in the middle of the road is a chilling image. It made me think of the film 'Monster' with Charlize Theron, and how Aileen Wuornos used to pick up rides from the roadside. I also love the shot of someone running on the road, as well as the frightening lengths one may have to consider to try and stay alive. I saw this film at eleven o' clock at night and walked out of it actually not afraid, and didn't have nightmares afterwards. Horror films really arn't for me, but this was scary and I'm just so glad I sat through it. On the newspaper's recommendation, but also warning, I saw 'Hard Candy'. A film meant to be scarier then this film. It was a very uncomfortable experience and icky subject matter, but unforgettable as well. So I suggest just go with 'Wolf Creek'. It was well done, but isn't a film I'd own or rent on DVD.",5,"Never fall asleep, ask for help or become isolated in 'Wolf Creek'... because you never know who's prey you'll become",1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,2390,"['Buying', 'car', 'should', 'be', 'joyous', 'experience', 'anyone', 'thought', 'going', 'road', 'trip', 'two', 'female', 'companions', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'indeed', 'should', 'be', 'basis', 'many', 'happy', 'memories', 'promise', 'love', 'blooms', 'future', 'infinate', 'possibilities', 'car', 'kaput', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'fix', 'only', 'hope', 'have', 'making', 'out', 'car', 'intact', 'help', 'lone', 'truck', 'driver', 'who', 'miraculously', 'darkness', 'blinding', 'light', 'Creek', 'where', 'three', 'friends', 'wanting', 'travel', 'north', 'inevitably', 'have', 'go', 'south', 'seek', 'help', 'need', 'long', 'car', 'trip', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'tired', 'urge', 'not', 'fall', 'asleep', 'warmth', 'camp', 'fire', 'kind-hearted', 'new', 'found', 'friend', 'reason', 'being', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'wake', 'here', 'where', 'fun', 'horror', 'three', 'friends', 'cunningly', 'split', 'sections', 'so', 'time', 'are', 'ever', 'safe', 'pack', 'again', 'travel', 'alone', 'unforgiving', 'dark', 'harsh', 'landscape', 'ever-present', 'realism', 'could', 'make', 'anyone', 'skin', 'crawl', 'Can', 'anyone', 'escape', 'alive', 'being', 'strewn', 'splattered', 'harsh', 'landscape', 'How', 'did', 'chaos', 'begin', 'answers', 'lie', 'early', 'film', 'come', 'clearer', 'film', 'progresses.This', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'saw', 'based', 'part', 'backpacker', 'murders', 'Ivan', 'Milat', '1989-1992', 'caught', 'Maybe', 'same', 'would', 'happen', 'here', 'lone', 'screaming', 'figure', 'woman', 'middle', 'road', 'chilling', 'image', 'made', 'think', 'film', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'how', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'used', 'pick', 'up', 'rides', 'roadside', 'also', 'love', 'shot', 'someone', 'running', 'road', 'as', 'well', 'frightening', 'lengths', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'consider', 'try', 'stay', 'alive', 'saw', 'film', 'eleven', 'o', 'clock', 'night', 'walked', 'actually', 'not', 'afraid', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nightmares', 'afterwards', 'Horror', 'films', 'really', 'ar', ""n't"", 'was', 'scary', ""'m"", 'just', 'so', 'glad', 'sat', 'newspaper', 'recommendation', 'also', 'warning', 'saw', ""'Hard"", 'Candy', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'scarier', 'then', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'experience', 'icky', 'subject', 'matter', 'unforgettable', 'as', 'well', 'suggest', 'just', 'go', ""'Wolf"", 'Creek', 'was', 'well', 'done', ""n't"", 'film', ""'d"", 'own', 'rent', 'DVD']",N/A

Shame it had to had to happen to the most captivating brunette on film of modern times. Who needs blondes? Enough of that light hearted swagger. This is a serious film. It poses questions on a macro-scale. Who should we trust? Does society have the right to be suspicious of strangers: the unknown? How do we avoid defeat when truth & fiction meet & collide on par with The Big Bang, more so how can we develop as a species in a fairy land community (the neighbourhood suspicion, isolation & silence could spur on a cosmos antithesis in The Big Crunch) that as the day passes seems further beyond reach? There were some snapshots of nature, dawn, moon, sky scenes during the film. It struck me as beautiful, but tragic that God created it all however many billions ago, & soon abandoned it after: letting nature takes it`s savage course. Abraham Lincoln was into Deism. I suggest you research that system of belief. I'm sorry for talking about God, the universe, politics, society crumbling: but this film is a an unexpected lynch pad for these discussions to take place.

I liked how the cast was small and very likable, and although the beginning unfolded slowly we got to know and like Liz, Kristy and Ben more, until I remembered that this was not going to be a pretty movie and I had a huge knot in my throat thinking about what was laying ahead for them.The are simple young kids backpacking through Australia when they visit the Wolf Creek National Park, and spend some time at the Crater, which is a tourist attraction while in the middle of nowhere. Their troubles start when their watches and the car stop working, and they have to rely on a friendly local to help them out. Unfortunately the friendly local has other intentions about their future and they are gruesome. I was shocked while watching half the scenes; this movie really stays in your head, days after you see it. Perhaps because the kids are so nice and likable and real and when bad things happen it's like watching yourself in this situation.I really liked this movie because it reminded me of books such as Intensity by Dean R. Koontz, where you had a young person or more, trying to survive a deadly game with a lunatic killer who is insanely hard to outwit.The major plusses of the movie were that the cast was small and let me tell you, they were not spared close encounters and even death, but you must watch for yourself to see how that unfolds. All I can say it that when you saw the struggle and pain and thought a certain person was safe, only the worst happened over and over. This movie grabs you slowly, but then it sucks you in like a tornado. I loved this low budget flick and I will definitely hold it above many Hollywood productions.

642174,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JON3,Kaya Savas,"[3, 7]","Here we go. Another entry into the teen horror genre, this time brought to us from down under. The movie tells the tale of three friends venturing out on a road trip to visit Wolf Creek. The opening credit montage is just vast wide shots of the outback while they drive through it, all shot with a wide angle lens. They drive their car all the way out into the middle of the outback and hike to see the massive meteor crater at the Wolf Creek hiking trail. When they come back their car doesn't start (big suprise!), and they have to spend the night. Luckily a man in a tow truck finds them and he nicely tows them back to his bachelor pad, which also happens to be in the middle of nowhere. So, he attempts to fix their car and as he works on it our protagonists fall asleep by the fire. When they wake up it's a whole different situation as they find themselves being hunted by their good tow truck Aussie friend. What follows is just pointless nonsense that is not entertaining at all.First of all, Ben appears to be the main character yet we don't see him for the majority of the movie. When I watched the featurette and heard the director say that he wasn't the main character I was thinking to myself ""well, why did you make him appear as if he was the main character and then take him out for the entire movie until the end?"". Another problem I had with the movie was it's inconsistencies with time and weather. One scene it's raining and Ben says that it'll pass in a few hours. The next seen sees Liz sitting by some rocks and it's not raining and they do no transition shots to suggest a passing of time. Also, the first time Liz wakes up and realizes she has been tied up and captured, it is dusk. The sun is starting to set and is low in the sky, and she unties herself and jumps out the window. In the time she unties herself it becomes pitch black in one minute. Then there is the whole plot of the movie, which is not scary at all and really has no logical purpose to it. This is supposedly a ""true"" story (what isn't these days?), but still, not everything is meant to be a film. The movie ends so abruptly, you will sit there and be like ""well? Is there anything else?"". It really ends in such a horrible way that it doesn't tie anything together. In fact, you feel like there is a missing second half to the film somewhere, and it isn't found in the ""unrated"" edition, I can tell you that. The only highlight of the film is the use of scenery to establish an atmosphere, unfortunately the score didn't support it to create a tension filled atmosphere. The music was dull and at times there were few cues that sounded exactly like Harald Kloser's score to The Day After Tomorrow. Otherwise this is an empty story that just adds another waste of time to the horror genre.I think the problem with horror films these days is the lack of attention to character development. All the cheap gore driven horror films we see these days are usually between 90-105 minutes in length. They quickly jump into all the death and gore, and you know what?

Sometimes a slow opening can be a bad introduction  for a film, giving you the feeling of exactly what to expect. But the slow opening felt right for this movie. It was sort of a build up before the presentation. Creating the characters, settings and its realism, as this was based an actual events, this is exactly what this film needed.The plot is pretty simple. It is a story of three road-trippers in remote Australia, Wolf Creek National Park, who are plunged into danger when they accept help from who seemed to be a friendly local. I cant say the acting is bad, just not terrific. John Jarret gives a good performance as a psychopathic killer, while the rest of the cast play decent, blending well with the film, giving a more convincing impression of a realistic event.The thing that I really enjoyed from this film was not just its realism but how horror was used. Within the last few years i have seen many horror films that work in the same way, trying to scare  by using the same old jumps to shock. This just doesnt work anymore. This film works great through its slow music, giving a dark and eerie feeling to it, also bringing to the scenes that look normal but contain a creepy sense to it. Giving another good impression of how fact can be more terrifying than fiction. The violence isnt entirely graphic but gives a slight sense of a depressing feeling, which I think is a great effect while excluding the music entirely, giving another great image of realism. It definetly had same feeling of the Texas Chainsaw massacre.While i say that this is a great 5 star horror film, I still have  give the review a 4 star great film overall.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","I really don't know how much of ""Wolf Creek"" is actually based on the Backpacker Killer of Australia, but even if a tinge of it is true, it makes for a good horror tale.  Mind you, this isn't your typical hack n' slash Freddy or Jason flick, this film is about a demented man who just enjoys torturing and killing people.  There is some gore, but I've seen a lot worse.  Besides, gore doesn't make a movie scary, it's the PLOT that makes it scary.A number of things set ""Wolf Creek"" apart from your average horror flick.  For one, there are only three characters who become potential victims.  Our killer doesn't have a huge party or some wild bunch of teenage idiots to work with.  He's only got three, and he makes the most of it.  Also, we get to learn quite a deal about our three victims.  Cassandra Macgrath heads up the group of backpackers and she takes on the primary heroine role in the film.  Nathan Phillips plays her would-be love interest and Kestie Morassi hits the trail looking like a young and somewhat prettier Christina Applegate(perhaps the accent gives her that ""something extra"").  John Jarratt plays Mick Taylor, our prime suspect.  Relax, I haven't given anything away by fingering Jarratt as the killer, it's almost obvious when he hits the screen.  He's almost too likeable and friendly at first for the average viewer to think of him as anything else.  He does sort of look like old Roscoe P. Coltrane from the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" TV series, so that kind of took the edge off of him for me.  No matter, the entire cast did a wonderful and convincing job.The story sounds rather stereotypical of the horror genre:  friends trek off for a weekend of fun and end up being systematically tortured and killed.  Though it isn't quite as relentless as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" I can see the similarities in the cruel and garish actions of the villain.  The back of the DVD case compares this flick to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which I feel is a disservice to ""Wolf Creek.""  This is a much better film.  I didn't care when things happened to the jerks in ""Blair Witch,"" but I did pull for the victims in ""Wolf Creek.""Overall, if you're a fan of horror along the ""Texas Chainsaw"" line, you'll enjoy this flick.  If you think scary is defined by the body count, stay away.One other thing, I was amazed at how intelligent the characters were in this film.  They actually defended themselves and attempted to escape.  Only one character got a little too sure of themself, but I think that was due more to delirium than attitude.Highly recommended.",4,"Finally, A Few Smart Victims!!",1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,2565,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'actually', 'based', 'Backpacker', 'Killer', 'Australia', 'even', 'tinge', 'true', 'good', 'horror', 'tale', 'Mind', ""n't"", 'typical', 'hack', 'n', 'slash', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'flick', 'film', 'demented', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'torturing', 'killing', 'people', 'gore', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'worse', 'gore', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'scary', 'PLOT', 'scary.A', 'number', 'things', 'set', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'apart', 'average', 'horror', 'flick', 'one', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'characters', 'who', 'become', 'potential', 'victims', 'killer', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'party', 'wild', 'bunch', 'teenage', 'idiots', 'work', 'only', 'got', 'three', 'most', 'Also', 'get', 'learn', 'quite', 'deal', 'three', 'victims', 'Cassandra', 'Macgrath', 'up', 'group', 'backpackers', 'primary', 'heroine', 'role', 'film', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'would-be', 'love', 'interest', 'Kestie', 'Morassi', 'trail', 'looking', 'young', 'somewhat', 'prettier', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'perhaps', 'accent', 'something', 'extra', 'John', 'Jarratt', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Relax', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'anything', 'away', 'fingering', 'Jarratt', 'killer', 'almost', 'obvious', 'when', 'screen', 'almost', 'too', 'likeable', 'friendly', 'first', 'average', 'viewer', 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'sort', 'look', 'old', 'Roscoe', 'P.', 'Coltrane', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'TV', 'series', 'kind', 'took', 'edge', 'matter', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'wonderful', 'convincing', 'job.The', 'story', 'rather', 'stereotypical', 'horror', 'genre', 'friends', 'trek', 'off', 'weekend', 'fun', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'systematically', 'tortured', 'killed', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'relentless', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'can', 'see', 'similarities', 'cruel', 'garish', 'actions', 'villain', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'flick', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'feel', 'disservice', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'when', 'things', 'happened', 'jerks', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'did', 'pull', 'victims', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'Overall', ""'re"", 'fan', 'horror', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'line', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'flick', 'think', 'scary', 'defined', 'body', 'count', 'stay', 'away.One', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'were', 'film', 'actually', 'defended', 'attempted', 'escape', 'Only', 'one', 'character', 'got', 'little', 'too', 'sure', 'themself', 'think', 'was', 'due', 'more', 'delirium', 'attitude.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
642179,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JON3,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 8]","This Australian exercise in sadism may also be the biggest, most pleasant surprise I've had in quite some time (at the risk of alienating anyone--pleasant is an odd choice of words for this film)!  Expecting little, I found much to appreciate in ""Wolf Creek""--a potent entry in the slasher/torture genre.First of all, the film is practically a masterpiece compared to recent American films with similarly nasty themes.  Without a Chad Michael Murray, Paris Hilton, Amber Tamblyn, or other fresh faced TV-ready star in place, ""Wolf Creek"" already starts out at an advantage.  Here, we get a young trio on vacation.  They like to party hard, but unlike their American counterpoints, they speak and interact believably without that self-aware dialogue that plagues many modern horror films.  You get to know them, the build up and character development is admirable.  In fact, there is one scene where two of the characters tentatively kiss.  It's well played and very sweet.  How often have you said that when watching a film for its gore content?  Maybe never.Once the torment begins, I was invested in these three kids.  I wasn't wishing them to be dispatched--say like in ""Hostel"" when I was thrilled to see our obnoxious horndogs put to the knife (of course, they were cartoons not characters)--no I wanted our heroes here to persevere.  And every action and reaction is credible!  When they can help a friend, they try.  If they can't, they don't.  And they take every opportunity to escape.  This is not a witless exercise.  Logical choices are made--for good or bad result.  So this played out in a very real, very unexpected way--I was surprised by the outcome several times as we got closer to the end.  I can't give it much higher praise than that.One cliche, however, that seems to extend across all borders--the rural caricature.  Be it the Australian Outback or the American backwoods, those unfortunate enough to inhabit these desolate countries are depicted as mentally challenged an/or bullying rednecks!I think this film could appeal to an audience outside typical slasher films.  There is a resourcefulness and intelligence that make this distinct from a lot of Hollywood product.  It's a tale of survival as much as anything.  But obviously, there is brutality and unpleasantness.  Approach with caution, and you might be rewarded!

That being said, you don't even need the scary music when you have the sounds of people being tortured, of a woman begging for her life, and of a person so traumatized that even when you're scolding her for breathing so loudly while the killer searches for her you know you'd do the same thing in her place. Any movie where people are just minding their own business trying to do their hiking/camping thing and something goes wrong and they, foolishly, believe in the inherent goodness of others only to wind up being hunted has the potential for being either creepy or campy.

I watched it during the daylight with the shades up and that did nothing to mitigate the bad parts of this one.  If you are tired of horror films that wimp out and/or rely too much on special effects, then this 2005 effort from Down Under is for you.  If you watch horror films for the cathartic experience, then stay away from this one, because once you climb down into the abyss on this one you do not really get back out the whole way.  Not even close.Liz Hutner (Cassandra Magrath), Kristy Earl (Kestie Morassi), and Ben Mitchell (Nathan Phillips) are a trio of young adults who decide to go hiking in the remote but scenic Wolf Creek National Park in the Australian Outback.  On the way there they stop at a roadhouse and Ben has a run in with a mean looking customer, which is the sort of thing that does not bode well for young people in splatter flicks.  But these three have no idea.  It takes a while for things to start going wrong and a bit longer to get to the point where the bad things start happening and start building in intensity.In the featurette on the DVD McLean talks about wanting his serial killer, Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) to be an Australian icon and a counterpart to Freddie and Jason.  But Mick's humor ring hollow compared to Freddie because he is not a supernatural being and his victims are not stupid, oversexed teenagers who are killed in creative ways that allow you to take perverse pleasure in their deaths.  Mick takes out people the old fashioned way, with a knife and a high powered rifle.  ""Wolf Creek"" does not allow any buffers between you and the violence.  This guy is a sick bastard.  He is not particularly inventive when it comes to hurting people, he is just brutally effective in what he does.For many viewers the fact that is takes a while for things to start happening in this one will be sufficient reason to knock down the rating one star.  Not much happens in the first half of this film and it is not like the character development of Liz, Kristy and Ben is all that important.  But for me the part where I did the deduction comes when the victims have their best chance to get out alive.  Now, if there is one thing we have learned from these splatter flicks it is that the killer is down but never out.  When you get them down, do not stop, do not pass go, and do not go running off so they can chase you down.  Do whatever you need to in order to take them out.  Given that premise, if you have an empty gun and are precluded from shooting them, then it should be obvious where to hit them.  Unfortunately, that proves to be too obvious for the characters in this movie.  Still, the ending does not play out the way you would expect and there is a rather interesting shell game when it comes to who is the hero, which earns bonus points.I was curious as to what exactly were the true events on which ""Wolf Creek"" was based, because for all I knew it could be the statistics thrown at you in the beginning of the movie regarding how many people are lost in Australia each year.  But it turns out there is the case of Ivan Milat, a serial killer who was convicted for what are called the ""Backpacker Murders"" in Australia, and last year Bradley John Murdoch was convicted for killing a British backpacker.  Of course these simply serve as an inspiration for writer-director Greg McLean the way Ed Gein inspired ""Psycho"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  Besides, the question with splatter flicks is never whether they are true, but whether they come across as being real, and this one is ahead on that score at the end.",4,They play dirty  Down Under when it comes to Splatter Flicks,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,3655,"['Wolf', 'Creek', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'splatter', 'slicks', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'watched', 'daylight', 'shades', 'up', 'did', 'nothing', 'mitigate', 'bad', 'parts', 'one', 'are', 'tired', 'horror', 'films', 'wimp', 'out', 'and/or', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'then', '2005', 'effort', 'Down', 'watch', 'horror', 'films', 'cathartic', 'experience', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'one', 'once', 'climb', 'down', 'abyss', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'back', 'out', 'whole', 'way', 'Not', 'even', 'close.Liz', 'Hutner', 'Cassandra', 'Magrath', 'Kristy', 'Earl', 'Kestie', 'Morassi', 'Ben', 'Mitchell', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'are', 'trio', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'decide', 'go', 'hiking', 'remote', 'scenic', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'National', 'Park', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'way', 'stop', 'roadhouse', 'Ben', 'run', 'mean', 'looking', 'customer', 'sort', 'thing', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'young', 'people', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'three', 'have', 'idea', 'while', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'bit', 'longer', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'start', 'building', 'intensity.In', 'featurette', 'DVD', 'McLean', 'talks', 'wanting', 'serial', 'killer', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'John', 'Jarratt', 'be', 'Australian', 'icon', 'counterpart', 'Freddie', 'Jason', 'Mick', 'humor', 'ring', 'hollow', 'compared', 'Freddie', 'not', 'supernatural', 'being', 'victims', 'are', 'not', 'stupid', 'oversexed', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'killed', 'creative', 'ways', 'allow', 'take', 'perverse', 'pleasure', 'deaths', 'Mick', 'out', 'people', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'knife', 'high', 'powered', 'rifle', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'not', 'allow', 'buffers', 'violence', 'guy', 'sick', 'bastard', 'not', 'particularly', 'inventive', 'when', 'hurting', 'people', 'just', 'brutally', 'effective', 'what', 'does.For', 'many', 'viewers', 'fact', 'while', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'sufficient', 'reason', 'knock', 'down', 'rating', 'one', 'star', 'Not', 'much', 'happens', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'not', 'character', 'development', 'Liz', 'Kristy', 'Ben', 'important', 'part', 'where', 'did', 'deduction', 'when', 'victims', 'have', 'best', 'chance', 'get', 'out', 'alive', 'Now', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'learned', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'killer', 'down', 'never', 'out', 'When', 'get', 'down', 'do', 'not', 'stop', 'do', 'not', 'pass', 'go', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'running', 'off', 'can', 'chase', 'down', 'Do', 'need', 'order', 'take', 'out', 'Given', 'premise', 'have', 'empty', 'gun', 'are', 'precluded', 'shooting', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'where', 'hit', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'too', 'obvious', 'characters', 'movie', 'Still', 'ending', 'not', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'would', 'expect', 'rather', 'interesting', 'shell', 'game', 'when', 'who', 'hero', 'bonus', 'points.I', 'was', 'curious', 'what', 'exactly', 'were', 'true', 'events', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'was', 'based', 'knew', 'could', 'be', 'statistics', 'thrown', 'beginning', 'movie', 'regarding', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'lost', 'Australia', 'year', 'out', 'case', 'Ivan', 'Milat', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'convicted', 'what', 'are', 'called', 'Backpacker', 'Murders', 'Australia', 'last', 'year', 'Bradley', 'John', 'Murdoch', 'was', 'convicted', 'killing', 'British', 'backpacker', 'course', 'simply', 'serve', 'inspiration', 'writer-director', 'Greg', 'McLean', 'way', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'inspired', 'Psycho', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'question', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'never', 'are', 'true', 'come', 'being', 'real', 'one', 'ahead', 'score', 'end']",N/A

Yes, the depiction of sadistic madness is most chilling, and we are certainly caught up in this trip through utter insanity.

I was fortunate enough to catch ""Wolf Creek"" during its short theatrical run, and as I watched, was in agreement with the critics who praised its 'look' in comparison to TCM: here was a gritty, nihilistic survival-horror nightmare that made no excuses for its madness, or its random way of dispatching victims.  Of course I was quite excited about the unrated DVD, and ultimately came away pretty heavily disappointed.  This is one instance where the DVD mastering works against the film as whole: the damn thing looks WAY too squeaky-clean for its own good.  Gone is the sand-blasted grain and grimy earth tones that saturated the theatrical print, and this takes quite a bit away from the overall experience.  Similarly, the extras are unimaginative and unimpressive: a largely self-congratulatory behind-the-scenes featurette (that really doesn't make me want to flip on the commentary), the trailer, and a typically superficial deleted scene.

It has the most basic plot summary, three kids who have nothing better to do than to travel to a hole in the ground in Austrailia's outback.  Guess what?  Their car breaks down!  How wonderfully predictible.  Then, their watches stop for some godforsaken reason, and who comes along to the rescue?  Creepy tow-truck guy comes to save the day, a mixture of Randy Quaid, the Crocodile Hunter, and a distant cousin of mine.  Interestingly, he's the best character in the film, providing a few chuckles now and then.  The film makes some allusions to Crocodile Dundee (""That's not a knife, THIS is a knife!"") and then the creepy tow-truck guy tortures them for about an hour, leading to a wildly predictable ending, thrown in with some random true facts.  There are many wrongdoings.  First, the film gives no background on ANY of the characters.  We don't know who these kids, or the torturer, are, setting up the fact that I don't really care who they are by the end, just as long as the film ends.  Second, there are no real facts to the film, just a bunch of torturing and then some mumbo jumbo about how some guy did the same thing in Australia, but was acquitted of the charges.  Well, if the police would have taken a gander at the guy's property, he wouldn't have gotten off, so there can't be too much truth to the film.  Thirdly, in the tradition of the Saw flicks and the newer Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the film is primarily about blood, sex, booze, and guts rather than that one thing....what's it called...oh yeah...plot.

But I have to say that the film is a miraculously combined number of ideas and thoughts...one being a quote by H.P. Lovecraft, something along the lines of, ""Man's greatest fear is of the unknown"", and this is where the seemingly endlessly empty outback comes in, the films fifth character, and it's used to a haunting degree.Another is a, although I don't particularly like his writing, King quote, something along the lines of ""Believability is what makes something frightening, without the believability it's not scary.""[I maybe have butchered the quote, but you get the idea.] The entire story is 100% realistic, as sick and depraved as Mick may seem, people like him do exist, and the actions he partakes in happen every day.The film, when you think about it, is a, I hesitate to say masterful, more of an impressive, blend of Hitchcock (the killing off of the one who seems to be the main character halfway through the movie) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the low budget, grainy style, and, again, the use of the isolating surroundings.)So, upon second viewing, I can certainly say that I was proven wrong.

642195,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B00005JON3,Matthew King,"[3, 4]","""Wolf Creek"" centers around 2 female British backpackers and one male Aussie backpacker who meet in the Oceanside town of Broom and who set upon crossing the Australian outback en route to their next party destination, the East coast town of Cairns.  The guy buys a lemon of a car for $1500 and thus the journey begins for our three adventuresome friends.  Good times abound until during a hiking trip at Wolf Creek Canyon Park where, upon their return, their car refuses to start.  Stuck in complete and utter isolation the trio are in the dumps until several hours later when what appears to be a friendly Aussie bushman shows up and offers to tow them to his place so he can repair their car.  And then the torture and sick games begin as the three are now at the mercy of the wild, murderous bushman.  They must escape but where to?  There's nothing and nobody for hundreds of miles...The real star of the movie is not any of the actors.  It's the locale.  Rarely has a horror movie been set in a scarier place than this.  For those of us who have been there, we know just how isolated the Outback really is, way more secluded than any Southwest USA desert locale could ever be.  When I went on an Outback trip, I enjoyed the company of a guide and a group of friends.  But what if I'd gone by car like Ben and his female friends?  What would have happened if the car broke down?  If a madman started chasing us around?  There's not a soul in sight.  No police.  No 911.  What would we do?  To me that sense of utter isolation is what makes Wolf Creek so successful as a horror film.In Mick Taylor, the director has created a villain for the ages.  On the surface he appears to be the epitome of down under friendliness, but man is this guy ever MEAN.  He comes across as a cartoonish version of what westerners see Aussie's as being, a kind of Mick Dundee/Steve Irwin type, but with a very dark twist to him.  The movie offers an interesting contrast of character styles between the villain, who is kind of a 1950's bushwacker Aussie throwback and young Ben from Sydney who represents the modern young urban Aussie, a man of style, surfing, hip-hop and baggy clothes.  Needless to say, the two butt heads the minute they see each other.I'm rather surprised at the low star rating this film is getting from reviewers.  No doubt some are offended in what they see as being misogynistic actions towards women and needless scenes of torture.  Well, let me clear the air right now: This is not a torture film.  There's only a select such scenes in the film and while they are indeed hard to watch, they serve to accentuate the terror factor of the film.  If you don't like your horror hard and nasty, then don't watch this one and go watch something like Final Destination 3 instead.Other criticism surrounds the lack of original ideas, saying that films like Wolf Creek and other recent horror efforts (such as the TCM & Hills Have Eyes remakes, Devil's Rejects, etc.) are ""throwback 70's films"" that offer nothing new.  Hogwash.  Many horror fans would agree with me when I say that the 70's were some of the golden years of horror film and cinema in general, no holds barred pictures that shed blood and skin before we entered an era of political correctness in mainstream film.  I ask you horror fans the world over, would we rather revisit the late-90's era of post-Scream teen slasher self-referentia?  I didn't think so.  Wolf Creek offers engaging characters, a fast pace and lots of gore.  Admittedly the ending is rather anti-climactic but as long as you can swallow graphic horror then this one should be right up your alley.  So as long as these 70's throwback dirt-road horror films are this good and this unabashedly bloody, keep em' coming I say.",4,Breakneck Road,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,3761,"['Wolf', 'Creek', 'centers', '2', 'female', 'British', 'backpackers', 'one', 'male', 'Aussie', 'backpacker', 'who', 'Oceanside', 'town', 'Broom', 'who', 'set', 'crossing', 'Australian', 'outback', 'route', 'next', 'party', 'destination', 'East', 'coast', 'town', 'Cairns', 'guy', 'lemon', 'car', '1500', 'thus', 'journey', 'three', 'adventuresome', 'friends', 'Good', 'times', 'abound', 'hiking', 'trip', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'Canyon', 'Park', 'where', 'return', 'car', 'start', 'Stuck', 'complete', 'utter', 'isolation', 'trio', 'are', 'dumps', 'several', 'hours', 'later', 'when', 'what', 'be', 'friendly', 'Aussie', 'bushman', 'up', 'offers', 'tow', 'place', 'can', 'repair', 'car', 'then', 'torture', 'sick', 'games', 'begin', 'three', 'are', 'now', 'mercy', 'wild', 'murderous', 'bushman', 'must', 'escape', 'where', 'nothing', 'nobody', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'not', 'actors', 'locale', 'Rarely', 'horror', 'movie', 'been', 'set', 'scarier', 'place', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'isolated', 'Outback', 'really', 'way', 'more', 'secluded', 'Southwest', 'USA', 'desert', 'locale', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'When', 'went', 'Outback', 'trip', 'enjoyed', 'company', 'guide', 'group', 'friends', 'what', ""'d"", 'gone', 'car', 'Ben', 'female', 'friends', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'car', 'broke', 'down', 'madman', 'started', 'chasing', 'not', 'soul', 'sight', 'police', '911', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'sense', 'utter', 'isolation', 'what', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'so', 'successful', 'horror', 'film.In', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'director', 'created', 'villain', 'ages', 'surface', 'be', 'epitome', 'down', 'friendliness', 'man', 'guy', 'ever', 'MEAN', 'across', 'cartoonish', 'version', 'what', 'westerners', 'see', 'Aussie', 'being', 'kind', 'Mick', 'Dundee/Steve', 'Irwin', 'type', 'very', 'dark', 'twist', 'movie', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'character', 'styles', 'villain', 'who', 'kind', '1950', 'bushwacker', 'Aussie', 'throwback', 'young', 'Ben', 'Sydney', 'who', 'modern', 'young', 'urban', 'Aussie', 'man', 'style', 'surfing', 'hip-hop', 'baggy', 'clothes', 'Needless', 'say', 'two', 'butt', 'heads', 'minute', 'see', 'other.I', ""'m"", 'rather', 'surprised', 'low', 'star', 'rating', 'film', 'getting', 'reviewers', 'doubt', 'are', 'offended', 'what', 'see', 'being', 'misogynistic', 'actions', 'towards', 'women', 'needless', 'scenes', 'torture', 'Well', 'let', 'clear', 'air', 'right', 'now', 'not', 'torture', 'film', 'only', 'select', 'such', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'indeed', 'hard', 'watch', 'serve', 'accentuate', 'terror', 'factor', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'horror', 'hard', 'nasty', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'go', 'watch', 'something', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'instead.Other', 'criticism', 'lack', 'original', 'ideas', 'saying', 'films', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'other', 'recent', 'horror', 'efforts', 'such', 'TCM', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'remakes', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'etc', 'are', 'throwback', '70', 'films', 'offer', 'nothing', 'new', 'Hogwash', 'Many', 'horror', 'fans', 'would', 'agree', 'when', 'say', '70', 'were', 'golden', 'years', 'horror', 'film', 'cinema', 'general', 'barred', 'pictures', 'shed', 'blood', 'skin', 'entered', 'era', 'political', 'correctness', 'mainstream', 'film', 'ask', 'horror', 'fans', 'world', 'would', 'rather', 'revisit', 'late-90', 'era', 'post-Scream', 'teen', 'slasher', 'self-referentia', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'engaging', 'characters', 'fast', 'pace', 'lots', 'gore', 'Admittedly', 'ending', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'swallow', 'graphic', 'horror', 'then', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'So', 'as', 'long', '70', 'throwback', 'dirt-road', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'unabashedly', 'bloody', 'keep', 'em', 'coming', 'say']",N/A

I went by myself and to my surprise, the movie house was packed.

It seemed just about everyone in the house was thinking what I was thinking...""What did I just pay 8 dollars to see?"". Once the killing started, I still didnt care about the characters because they bored me so much, that I actually thought they deserved to die for making me waste my money.But.There was some good in this movie. The killer was fantastic and just seemed like someone you'd never want to cross. Even with a friendly joke/poke at him, he scared the crap out of me. The atmosphere during the killings was also great. Everything seemed claustrophobic to me, even though they were in the extremely huge outback. It felt like no matter what they did...there just was NO escape. The death scenes were pretty good, especially the one girl trying to get away in the car.Then there is one other thing that really bothered me. I thought this movie was based on actual events, which made me believe that it was based on more fact than fiction. What I mean here is, during the death scenes, I really felt tense cause I usually picture myself in that situation. But at the end, the person that makes it out finally, never saw ANY of the death. And they also said the bodies were never found nor was the killer. So it was all made up. That dissapointed me and just was the last straw for me.Out of 5 stars I'd give it a 1.

Of the latest bunch of these movies (including Hostel, High Tension, Cry Wolf) this is by far the cream of the crop.Its success lies in creating characters that aren't snotty little brats but people we can actually see ourselves liking. It uses the Aussie outback to create an uneasy tension and sense of foreboding isolation. The psycho is someone who is utterly believably (and subtle touches like his grunting little breathes are effectively creepy). As someone born and raised in Australia, I've met and known people like these.I disagree that all the choices the victims make in trying to get away are dumb choices. A few are questionable, but that's par for the course. I also can't understand the many critiques that talk about how utterly devoid of humanity this movie is and that it is cruel for cruel's sake.

Naturally, I had to see it right away and have been recommending it to friends ever since (many of whom are still speaking with me). After all, Ebert has a storied history of giving the thumbs-up only to the most vapid, boring and poorly produced of all horror entries (the Devil's Rejects comes to mind). Since he hated everything about it, I figured it must be good. Boy, was I ever right.At no point does this film ever become predictable - something that can be said of few modern horror films. It just doles out surprise after suspenseful surprise. While some folks have mentioned that it's slow to get going, I couldn't disagree more. For what are they looking? This isn't a caper film or a Hollywood blockbuster for the masses. If you measure the quality of a movie by the quantity of explosions it contains or the salaries of its star power, look elsewhere. This one stays completely true to the genre.Though it probably won't give you nightmares like some horror films (with mobs of angry looking stop-action zombies), it's unsettling to view because the characters and situations are competely realistic.

The cinematography is great and you would easily believe the characters covered 2500km on their journey.The movie starts out in Broome, Western Australia, a haven for backpackers. Here we are introduced to the 3 main characters, British tourists Liz and Kristy (played by Aussie girls Kestie Morassi and Cassie McGrath) and Ben (played by the locally well-known Nathan Phillips in his finest role to date). The three plan to travel across the country to Ben's home-town of Sydney via Cairns, Darwin and Wolf Creek, the site of a meteor crater. (Actually spelled Wolfe Creek in real life).Having just bought a red Ford Falcon station wagon for the last few remaining dollars, the 3 spend one last night in Broome before heading off on their croos-country journey. In this time we see the 3 telling stories, singing songs, getting friendly with locals, gazing at the stars and finding love, but really it is just a chance for us to get to know the characters before the horror begins.Upon arriving at Wolf Creek, our would-be travellers are shocked to find their watches have ceased to work, and worse yet, their $1500 car won't start. Being stranded many km's from anywhere, panic and fear set in before the appearance of would-be saviour Mick Tayler. An outback nomad and unlikely hero.And it is here the movie takes a sharp turn into a hellish, edge of your seat nightmare for the characters and audiences alike.Writer and director Greg McLean has only one purpose in this movie, to scare the crap out of his audience and he succeeds, with the help of John Jarratt whom he often sought advice from. John is a veteran actor in Australia and is brilliant in the role of Mick Taylor. He comes across as a charming, humorous, friendly Aussie with the soul of a Hannibal Lecter. Given that John is most well known for working on lifestyle programs and childrens television shows in Australia, this role is a great example of his acting capabilities. He admitted to not doing much research for this role, but just let himself become Mick. One of his techniques was to not get to know the cast at all before shooting commenced so as to come across more terrifying, (because John really is a funny, nice guy). Another method was to deviate from the script a lot to catch his victims off guard, trying to instill real fear in them.This is a great movie.. It was shot in 25 days on a shoestring budget and while you can tell, it is easy to look past this.An interesting fact to know is whilst shooting, the film-makers had to deal with a lot of inclamite weather, which caught them completely off guard given that they were filming in some locations where it hadn't rained in over 10 years...And also, whilst this is based very loosely on a true story, the site of Mick's campsite, was actually the scene of a real life double homicide, which I must point out was not known to the film-makers at the time.In summary, this is the best movie I have seen for a long time.",5,A good effort from a first time director,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,3070,"['Wolf', 'Creek', 'was', 'filmed', '2hrs', 'Adelaide', 'even', 'movie', 'set', 'north-western', 'Australia', 'cinematography', 'great', 'would', 'easily', 'believe', 'characters', 'covered', '2500km', 'journey.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Broome', 'Western', 'Australia', 'haven', 'backpackers', 'Here', 'are', 'introduced', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'British', 'tourists', 'Liz', 'Kristy', 'played', 'Aussie', 'girls', 'Kestie', 'Morassi', 'Cassie', 'McGrath', 'Ben', 'played', 'locally', 'well-known', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'finest', 'role', 'date', 'three', 'plan', 'travel', 'country', 'Ben', 'home-town', 'Sydney', 'Cairns', 'Darwin', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'site', 'meteor', 'crater', 'Actually', 'spelled', 'Wolfe', 'Creek', 'real', 'life', '.Having', 'just', 'bought', 'red', 'Ford', 'Falcon', 'station', 'wagon', 'last', 'few', 'remaining', 'dollars', '3', 'spend', 'one', 'last', 'night', 'Broome', 'heading', 'off', 'croos-country', 'journey', 'time', 'see', '3', 'telling', 'stories', 'singing', 'songs', 'getting', 'friendly', 'locals', 'gazing', 'stars', 'finding', 'love', 'really', 'just', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'horror', 'arriving', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'would-be', 'travellers', 'are', 'shocked', 'find', 'watches', 'have', 'ceased', 'work', 'worse', 'yet', '1500', 'car', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'Being', 'stranded', 'many', 'km', 'anywhere', 'panic', 'fear', 'set', 'appearance', 'would-be', 'saviour', 'Mick', 'Tayler', 'outback', 'nomad', 'unlikely', 'hero.And', 'here', 'movie', 'sharp', 'turn', 'hellish', 'edge', 'seat', 'nightmare', 'characters', 'audiences', 'alike.Writer', 'director', 'Greg', 'McLean', 'only', 'one', 'purpose', 'movie', 'scare', 'crap', 'audience', 'help', 'John', 'Jarratt', 'whom', 'often', 'sought', 'advice', 'John', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Australia', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'across', 'charming', 'humorous', 'friendly', 'Aussie', 'soul', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Given', 'John', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'working', 'lifestyle', 'programs', 'childrens', 'television', 'shows', 'Australia', 'role', 'great', 'example', 'acting', 'capabilities', 'admitted', 'not', 'doing', 'much', 'research', 'role', 'just', 'let', 'become', 'Mick', 'One', 'techniques', 'was', 'not', 'get', 'know', 'cast', 'shooting', 'commenced', 'so', 'come', 'more', 'terrifying', 'John', 'really', 'funny', 'nice', 'guy', 'method', 'was', 'deviate', 'script', 'lot', 'catch', 'victims', 'off', 'guard', 'trying', 'instill', 'real', 'fear', 'them.This', 'great', 'movie..', 'was', 'shot', '25', 'days', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'can', 'tell', 'easy', 'look', 'past', 'this.An', 'interesting', 'fact', 'know', 'whilst', 'shooting', 'film-makers', 'had', 'deal', 'lot', 'inclamite', 'weather', 'caught', 'completely', 'guard', 'given', 'were', 'filming', 'locations', 'where', 'had', ""n't"", 'rained', '10', 'years', 'also', 'whilst', 'based', 'very', 'loosely', 'true', 'story', 'site', 'Mick', 'campsite', 'was', 'actually', 'scene', 'real', 'life', 'double', 'homicide', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'known', 'film-makers', 'time.In', 'summary', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time']",N/A

I had read so many reviews about it in just about every FILM MAGAZINE around... heard spots on the radio, etc.  So, when I saw the UNRATED VERSION for sale at a local DVD shop, I decided to buy it and have a few friends over!!!I knew we were in for something different (albeit 'different' not neccessarily meaning ""good"" but rather ""terrifying). I had done my research...Apparently, loosely based on 3 true events from the AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK... (1)The BACKPACKER MURDERS of the early 1990's, (2) The SNOWTOWN MURDERS of 1999 and (3) The PETER FALCONIO DISSAPPERANCE of 2001.The only ""ties"" that bind these 3 events together being...  THE BREATHTAKING (& FRIGHTENING) VAST AND UNINHABITED OUTBACK... A GROUP OF UNEXPECTING TOURISTS... AND FINALLY A HELPFUL ""BUSHTUCKER-MAN/STEVE IRWIN/CROCODILE DUNDEE TYPE"" WHO QUICKLY TURNS OUT TO BE A PSYCHOPATH LOOKING TO TORTURE HIS VICTIMS...We are introduced to BEN (an Aussie) and his two travelling companions Liz and Kristy (2 British Girls). They have decided to travel together to Wolf Creek National Park to visit the Crater formed by a Meteor.The story starts by building on the characters from the word go and we see the interesting bond between them. Ben has actually fallen for one of the girls and his affections are well met...Along the way to Wolf Creek we are introduced to some less than savoury characters ... which slowly starts building the tension and you realise that the inevitable is going to happen... but the Director masterfully weaves doom and gloom with stunning and breathtaking views of the Australian Outback and a few ""nicer"" moments which constantly mask the horrors that await our troupe.I had the ""gut feelings"" of DELIVERANCE constantly rolling around in my head whilst watching this film. A group of people heading out of their happy existence to innocently tackle nature in unknown surroundings...After the 3 HOUR HIKE in Bad Weather... they return to their vehicle which won't start and after deciding to sleep and wait for help, they are found by ""Mick""... a cheerful outback hunter who knows a great deal about cars. He says he can fix their car for free and has the part back at his workshop...They trust him and he tows them to his shop.After what seems like hours for them... and the viewer... the tension builds and we end up at Mick's place.Again, the Doom and Gloom ends and you see the 4 of them around a fire chatting and finding out more about Mick who seems to be quite a funny bloke - keen to help. He starts fixing their car for them... whilst they enjoy the warmth and his hospitality... as well as his Fresh Water from 'the top end'... and it's off to bed.The next morning they awake from the drugged water... separated... bound, gagged and tied up... Mick's place has become Mick's Lair...

The sole story arc is that 3 people go on a trip, then the women get tortured(and worse).

For one, it's Australian, so not quite as chained to the Hollywood conventions and necessities.  On the other hand, it's a bit uneven and is then only remembered as another lovely outing in the serial killer / torture / sadism / shock genre.A group of backpackers (two girls and a guy) take a trip to the Australian outback.  Eventually, they come in contact with a Crocodile Dundee-type outbacker guy who turns out to be a complete psycho who likes to kidnap, torture, and murder people, sometimes paralyzing and mutilating them for the audience, too.We then get the now-classic escape by the lone girl (or is it the guy?) sequence in which someone witnesses bad, awful things happening (like torture), escapes, fights and wounds the bad guy, escapes, fights more, etc, etc, etc.  Adjust the level of nihilism and you get a slightly different ending each time, but still the same dark message: you will die, no matter what.  This time, the message is infused with some truly stunning outdoor photography, a bit more character development that I can't recall, and a lack of deep character development (of madman Mick) that I DO recall since it was effectively played and spooky.  A few creepy moments to be sure, but few of them involve blood and gore, which is sporadic but not wall-to-wall.  No, Wolf Creek is a drawn out exercise in terror that gets pretty demented and depraved, but is only memorable by its (straight down) story arc.  No ridiculous plot twist ala the also-foreign High Tension, but nothing really new.The DVD has a few extras but nothing very enlightening about the film, though overall the release looks amazing in parts with its shots of the outback.  Almost two movies in some ways, the plot about the backpackers themselves, the atmosphere, and the photography are largely wasted once the mayhem begins.  It doesn't make the stalking more terrifying to know this much mundane detail about these people (like they drink, and smoke, and have relations, etc, etc).  Effects fans may enjoy some of the work simulating a real insane killer's skills.  Reviled by some critics, hailed by others, that's the type of film it is...either it's a repugnant, sick movie, or an effective, terrifying warning.No doubt a Wolf Creek 2 awaits one day, because life in these times wouldn't be complete without another film detailing the exact methods of torture used on random people by a serial killer in the Australian outback, perhaps they can top the 'head on a stick' bit here.

642216,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00005JON3,Paul Donovan,"[0, 0]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Wolf Creek&#8221;  [Australia, 2005]1. This low budget serial-killer thriller from Australia manages to be better than almost all horror movies America has put out in the decade since it was made.2. Of course, it&#8217;s &#8220;based on a true story&#8221;. Of course, this story never happened. The movie was based on elements of several crime cases in recent Australian history.3. The first half of the movie is relatively slow, to make sure you get to know the main characters, two British female tourists who are backpacking across Australia with their Australian friend Ben. During their travels their car breaks down, and they are rescued by a kindly old man who takes them back to his mining site camp.4. The second half of the movie tells you what happens to them when they reach the old man&#8217;s camp. It is a cruel, violent, rush.5. If you get a chance, look for the name of the mining site camp written on a sign. Spelled backwards, it&#8217;s the name of a serial killer the movie is based on.6. The movie was hated by many mainstream critics, who were appalled at the brutality and bleakness of the film. Roger Ebert gave it a rare rating of zero stars.7.  But other critics placed it on various &#8220;best of&#8221; horror lists, for the exact same reason. I am one of these critics.8. What impressed me the most was how relatively smart this movie is - the characters feel genuine, and they have more common sense than your usual movie victims. The movie breaks some traditional rules of horror, so it&#8217;s hard to predict what is going to happen - which makes it hurt all the more when you see what does happen.9.  This movie is not for everyone, but it is an intelligent, intense, sadistic piece of work that has more courage than most of its contemporaries.",4,gritty and gruesome,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1817,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Wolf', 'Creek', '8221', '[', 'Australia', '2005', ']', '1', 'low', 'budget', 'serial-killer', 'thriller', 'Australia', 'be', 'better', 'almost', 'horror', 'movies', 'America', 'put', 'out', 'decade', 'was', 'made.2', 'course', '8217', '8220', 'based', 'true', 'story', '8221', 'course', 'story', 'never', 'happened', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'elements', 'several', 'crime', 'cases', 'recent', 'Australian', 'history.3', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'relatively', 'slow', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'know', 'main', 'characters', 'two', 'British', 'female', 'tourists', 'who', 'are', 'backpacking', 'Australia', 'Australian', 'friend', 'Ben', 'travels', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'are', 'rescued', 'kindly', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'back', 'mining', 'site', 'camp.4', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'what', 'when', 'reach', 'old', 'man', '8217', 'camp', 'cruel', 'violent', 'rush.5', 'get', 'chance', 'look', 'name', 'mining', 'site', 'camp', 'written', 'sign', 'Spelled', 'backwards', '8217', 'name', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'based', 'on.6', 'movie', 'was', 'hated', 'many', 'mainstream', 'critics', 'who', 'were', 'appalled', 'brutality', 'bleakness', 'film', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'rare', 'rating', 'zero', 'stars.7', 'other', 'critics', 'placed', 'various', '8220', 'best', '8221', 'horror', 'lists', 'exact', 'same', 'reason', 'am', 'one', 'critics.8', 'What', 'impressed', 'most', 'was', 'how', 'relatively', 'smart', 'movie', 'characters', 'feel', 'genuine', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'sense', 'usual', 'movie', 'victims', 'movie', 'traditional', 'rules', 'horror', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'predict', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'hurt', 'more', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'happen.9', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'intelligent', 'intense', 'sadistic', 'piece', 'work', 'more', 'courage', 'most', 'contemporaries']",N/A

Then writer/producer/director Greg McLean throws them to the...wolves, in the guise of a helpful stranger, whom we soon discover is a maniac who's roved the vast outback for many years, running across those stranded, offering to lend them a hand and then, once at his little shop of horrors, tortures, rapes, belittles and eventually murders them.

Along with their inevitable auto breakdown comes rescue in the shape of friendly-yet-strange Mick Taylor, a bushwhacker with plenty of auto parts and a slightly aggressive desire to assist them in their hour of need.The most noticable thing about the first segment of 'Wolf Creek' is the slowness of the pace - this movie does take quite a while (some forty minutes) before the real subject matter is dealt with, but thanks to the quality of the acting and the really excellent, fresh direction, this long build-up doesn't drag.As Kirsty and Liz, Kestie Morassi and Cassandra MaGrath turn in likeable and convincing performances as two backpackers in search of fun, and don't really suffer from the 'civilian-turned-superwoman' syndrome of so many contemporary horror movies. Nathan Phillips as Ben gives a similarly decent turn in his role, and, while his part is considerably smaller, it's no less pivotal to the movie. John Jarratt as Mick Taylor is excellent; he's a malevolent and realistic version of Freddy Krugger, and the superb contrast between placidity and violence that Jarratt portrays make this one of the tightest, most effective movie villains for many years.Direction is gorgeous - using a very dark, washed-out palette, Greg McLean builds on his previous directorial success with award-winning short 'ICQ' by creating a visual atmosphere that's both incredibly strong and very, very subtle. The intense melancholia of the daytime scenes is nicely balanced with the artfully-shot violence and the whole piece comes off as very polished and very, very convincing.The fact that this is a movie based on a true story does help its rating, though - were this simply a standalone horror movie, it would be a solid three-star effort. This isn't the fault of the actors or the director, who all do superb jobs. Rather, in terms of content, not a whole lot happens here that's particularly memorable. Once the movie is over you still find yourself waiting for the real punch and muscle behind the picture; sadly, this never arrives. The ending is great, and totally unexpected for a film in this genre, but there is an overall sense of something missing from it.Still, while you're in the middle of it, 'Wolf Creek' is certainly a gripping and worthwhile film.Recommended highly for rental.",4,"Highly entertaining, very effective horror",1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,2593,"['Kristy', 'Ben', 'Liz', 'are', 'three', 'fast', 'friends', 'Australian', ""'re"", 'British', 'tourists', 'who', 'decide', 'yes', 'course', 'good', 'idea', 'drive', 'beat-up', 'old', 'station', 'wagon', 'halfway', 'Australian', 'desert', 'see', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'crater', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'meteoric', 'craters', 'world', 'inevitable', 'auto', 'breakdown', 'rescue', 'shape', 'friendly-yet-strange', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'bushwhacker', 'plenty', 'auto', 'parts', 'slightly', 'aggressive', 'desire', 'assist', 'hour', 'need.The', 'most', 'noticable', 'thing', 'first', 'segment', ""'Wolf"", 'Creek', 'slowness', 'pace', 'movie', 'take', 'quite', 'while', 'forty', 'minutes', 'real', 'subject', 'matter', 'dealt', 'thanks', 'quality', 'acting', 'really', 'excellent', 'fresh', 'direction', 'long', 'build-up', ""n't"", 'drag.As', 'Kirsty', 'Liz', 'Kestie', 'Morassi', 'Cassandra', 'MaGrath', 'turn', 'likeable', 'convincing', 'performances', 'two', 'backpackers', 'search', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'suffer', ""'civilian-turned-superwoman"", 'syndrome', 'so', 'many', 'contemporary', 'horror', 'movies', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'Ben', 'similarly', 'decent', 'turn', 'role', 'part', 'considerably', 'smaller', 'less', 'pivotal', 'movie', 'John', 'Jarratt', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'excellent', 'malevolent', 'realistic', 'version', 'Freddy', 'Krugger', 'superb', 'contrast', 'placidity', 'violence', 'Jarratt', 'portrays', 'make', 'one', 'tightest', 'most', 'effective', 'movie', 'villains', 'many', 'years.Direction', 'gorgeous', 'using', 'very', 'dark', 'washed-out', 'palette', 'Greg', 'McLean', 'previous', 'directorial', 'success', 'award-winning', 'short', ""'ICQ"", 'creating', 'visual', 'atmosphere', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'very', 'very', 'subtle', 'intense', 'melancholia', 'daytime', 'scenes', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'artfully-shot', 'violence', 'whole', 'piece', 'off', 'very', 'polished', 'very', 'very', 'convincing.The', 'fact', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'help', 'rating', 'were', 'simply', 'standalone', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'solid', 'three-star', 'effort', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actors', 'director', 'who', 'do', 'superb', 'jobs', 'Rather', 'terms', 'content', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'movie', 'still', 'find', 'waiting', 'real', 'punch', 'muscle', 'picture', 'sadly', 'never', 'ending', 'great', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'film', 'genre', 'overall', 'sense', 'something', 'missing', 'it.Still', ""'re"", 'middle', 'Creek', 'certainly', 'gripping', 'worthwhile', 'film.Recommended', 'highly', 'rental']",N/A
642223,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JON3,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Wolf Creek (Greg McLean, 2005)Wolf Creek is another of those movies that often gets lumped in with Saw and Hostel, and not to anyone's benefit. Least of all the movie's. Yes, there are a few scenes that might make the squeamish cringe, but the gore factor here is surprisingly low; I'm half-convinced the movie has the rating it does because of the language rather than the violence.Based on the true story of Ivan Milat, a serial killer who was relatively unknown outside Australia previous to the making of this movie, Wolf Creek follows three kids--Ben (Nathan Phillips of Snakes on a Plane), Kristy (Darkness Falls' Kestie Morassi), and Liz (TV actress Cassandra Magrath)--as they head out to Wolf Creek, a large meteorite crater in the Australian outback, and go hiking. When they get back to their car, they find it dead. A few hours later, a friendly chap named Mick (Picnic at Hanging Rock's John Jarratt) offers to tow them back to his camp and get their car running. That's not what he has in mind, as you know if you've seen any of the trailers.The acting, with the exception of Jarrett (who has been much-lauded for his efforts), is average, maybe slightly above. The cinematography is wonderful, which you can pretty much automatically expect from any movie that comes from that neck of the woods; there's just something about Australian cinematographers. The pace is, as with most horror movies since, modeled upon that of Alien--do nothing for a long time, and then cut everything loose. It's getting kind of old, to be honest. And that's the movie's biggest problem; it cleaves tightly to horror film convention for being an indie flick. Happy beginning, ominous stories at night, false alarm, car breakdown, scary serial killer. Woo. It's done with some style, to be sure, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. ***",3,"Not as bad as you've been led to believe, but not great.",1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,1835,"['Wolf', 'Creek', 'Greg', 'McLean', '2005', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'movies', 'often', 'lumped', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'not', 'anyone', 'benefit', 'Least', 'movie', 'Yes', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'might', 'make', 'squeamish', 'cringe', 'gore', 'factor', 'here', 'surprisingly', 'low', ""'m"", 'half-convinced', 'movie', 'rating', 'language', 'rather', 'violence.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Ivan', 'Milat', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Australia', 'previous', 'making', 'movie', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'three', 'kids', 'Ben', 'Nathan', 'Phillips', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'Kristy', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'Kestie', 'Morassi', 'Liz', 'TV', 'actress', 'Cassandra', 'Magrath', 'head', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'large', 'meteorite', 'crater', 'Australian', 'outback', 'go', 'hiking', 'When', 'get', 'back', 'car', 'find', 'dead', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'friendly', 'chap', 'named', 'Mick', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', 'John', 'Jarratt', 'tow', 'back', 'camp', 'get', 'car', 'running', 'not', 'what', 'mind', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers.The', 'acting', 'exception', 'Jarrett', 'who', 'been', 'much-lauded', 'efforts', 'average', 'maybe', 'slightly', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'automatically', 'expect', 'movie', 'neck', 'woods', 'just', 'something', 'Australian', 'cinematographers', 'pace', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'modeled', 'Alien', 'do', 'nothing', 'long', 'time', 'then', 'cut', 'everything', 'loose', 'getting', 'kind', 'old', 'be', 'honest', 'movie', 'biggest', 'problem', 'tightly', 'horror', 'film', 'convention', 'being', 'indie', 'flick', 'Happy', 'beginning', 'ominous', 'stories', 'night', 'false', 'alarm', 'car', 'breakdown', 'scary', 'serial', 'killer', 'Woo', 'done', 'style', 'be', 'sure', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', '***']",N/A

I hardly was scared in this film- grossed out yes sometimes but not scared. And this movie was claimed as gorey when it wasn't even that. Don't believe that fellow readers it is hardly gorey. Yet that's a good thing for me because I hate movies that overdo the gore. Yes the point is the movie did not keep me on the edge of my seat, mainly because in the beginning it dragged somewhat and made me grow bored. The movie lost points in the beginning definitely.Now when they finally get put into this old sick man's world then you get worried for the kids who are obviously in deep danger so this gets you interested in how they will survive and constantly are yelling to the screen to run or other things like that.Yet somehow the movie still wasn't amazing. Maybe it's the way it was acted out(the actors are not too amazing), maybe the plot I felt could have been written better- and overall I think my deep disappointment was the end. That wasn't much of an ending, and you don't really know what happened truly and a lot of the movie isn't nothing but a story it merely was a drawing on the aspects on many of the backpack murders that's all. A lot of people like the movie better assuming this is a truly what happened to these kids, when it isn't. There isn't much you can know of what happened, that's what the end tells you mainly. Like someone else said it is a poor showing of what really happened and that's what overall hurt the movie to me. It just wasn't amazing- just an average horror/ thriller and that's all.

Your car breaks down and you find yourselves in the hands of what seems to be a quaint, friendly Aussie, who gives off a slightly Crocodile Dundee vibe...but things turn sour fast when you wake up gagged and bound, with your friends nowhere in sight. That is how Wolf Creek rolls out of the gate. This movie is terrifying. Not in a Freddy or Jason sense, or even a Texas Chainsaw Massacre sense. This movie is scary simply because it is about a SERIAL killer, and it deals with the unrelenting horror his victims endure while trying to survive his maddened torturing. The movie surprised and scared me. I was not expecting to care so much about the three young adults who wind up in the hands of the dirty Bushman Mick. This movie was completely unlike other horror films in it's delivery of who lives and who dies also. I haven't ever seen a film where you literally have NO idea who is going to survive and who is going to live. Wolf Creek has a very REAL feeling to it. You almost feel like you are there with the characters experiencing the nightmarish events with them. I couldn't believe some of the things that happened in this movie! If I HAD to, I would compare Wolf Creek to the latest version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, except it has a little bit more of a literal, reality based tone to it, which only draws the viewers in more and makes you feel more involved. The death scenes are gory in a TRULY realistic sense without being over-the-top or fake looking. This is NOT a slasher flick! This movie has the somewhat shaky feeling of a documentary that gives the brutality of the killings an even more graphic and unconventional realism.The bottom line is that Wolf Creek is ingenious and groundbreaking with it's delivery of true terror. You feel for the kids, you almost want to cry for them when they are inhumanely murdered. I haven't seen HOSTEL, so I can't compare it's gore factor or horror to that...but, I know this movie effected me. If you want to see something scary...try Wolf Creek!

642229,A387BD735MI50R,B00005JON3,R. Schultz,"[2, 2]","This film is definitely several notches above the average horror flick. It overturns a number of slasher film cliches.First of all, you get to know the three victims as interesting individuals before the horror starts. These three are not the usual gum-chewing teens tossing a few random, pointless curses at each other before they encounter the psychopath. They are three intelligent, likeable people - which makes their ultimate brutal ordeal all the more wrenching.Then the ending is not what you expect. These characters' journey into hell will leave you shaken and depressed. I don't at all mean to make the real-life sufferings of people around the world frivolous with the comparison - nevertheless, I did walk away from this movie with a feel for what the the victims of mass genocide and attempted mass genocide in places like Rwanda and Cambodia may have gone through - a better feel than I generally have gotten from watching all the serious documentaries on those slaughters. Here I was plummeted right into proximity with a madman bent on butchery. I was forced to FEEL what it was like.I've heard a lot of analysis of why we flock to horror movies. Some say we are all sadists at heart and are getting our jollies vicariously. Some say that we go in order to rehearse what we might do if we are ever actually forced into such extremis. For me - I sense a certain amount of hidden malevolence in the average person, the person who starts out saying, 'Hi' and smiling - but who is harboring or can be triggered into a hatred that will end up undercutting life. And seeing this transformation, this shedding of the sheepskin - graphic, exaggerated, and overt on screen - somehow makes all the real-life hidden agendas around me more manageable, more expected.Whatever your motives for going to horror films, Wolf Creek will probably satisfy them. But don't listen to the running DVD commentary afterwards. The actors' and director's remarks don't add anything of interest.

But when forty-five minutes pass and there has not been one drop of blood or any evidence of upcoming chills, its time to eject and chalk it off to wishful thinking.After waiting far too long for something scary or gory to happen, along comes an Australian Outback Redneck with a tow truck to drive our boring camp party to their deaths.  The movie was based on a true story where a group of kids disappear without a trace in the Outback.  I can see the writer's scratching the bald spots on their heads, flakes of dandruff fluttering down around the crumpled papers on their desk, asking each other, ""So what happened to them?""  ""Well, let's just keep the lead-in going until we figure something out.""There is no suspense, boring dialogue, no feeling of creeping dread, a lot of driving and/or running about at night, very little blood or gore (with the exception a finger-chopping), and no surprises.  The characterizations were too obvious, even the redneck was far too typical to feel like a threat.  The only shivers I got from 'Wolf Creek' were the mounting feelings of dread stemming from the fact that I had actually paid to rent it.To the performer's credit, the acting, while far from spectacular, was okay.  There is also one very good line in the movie, ""Head On A Stick.""  This is referring to one of the girls when her spinal cord is severed (shown abstractly, not graphically -- the finger scene was worse).

The country is beautiful. One of your friends has a crush on you and you have one on her. You get to Wolf Creek Park and have to hike out to the meteor crater.The meteor crater is awesome.

Very believable. Too many times in Horror movies you find a cast of teeny boppers overacting and just acting foolishly. Wolf Creek is the antithesis of teeny bopper Horror. Wolf Creek's 3 young adult actors capture the young adult viewer with dispositions that can easily be related to, and they check all campy Horror movie humor and cliches at the door.This movie is done very well, and it is truly scary, because none of our party is faced with a guy in a mask, or a guy with a claw hand, or a supernatural being of some kind.

642238,A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L,B00005JON3,Solid Snake,"[5, 7]","The tension created in Wolf-Creek is unbelievable. I haven't been that wound up during a thriller since I watched ""Event Horizon"" when I was 13. From the very start the film creates an atmosphere of alienation and vulnerability, all set against the inhospitable backdrop of the Australian outback.In this type of film the core group of characters usually provides a solid foundation and comfort zone for the viewer. We know these people are ""Safe"" as long as they stick together. In Wolf-Creek, however, the core group lacks that kind of cohesiveness, an unexpected element that  isolates the characters from each other even when they are together.We are introduced to Liz and Christy, two young Brits who embark on a spontaneous tour of Australia, content to let their impulses guide them. With them is Ben, a reckless bad-boy type the girls befriended and invited along. In such a constellation sexual tension is a given, and before the story is even underway an uneasiness has fallen over the trio.This idle tension is turbocharged with the arrival of Mick, a grizzled 'Outbacker' who happens upon the youngsters and their broken down car - In an isolated park in the middle of the desert - At night.The affable Ausie offers to tow their car to his garage where he promises to fix it up and send them on their way. As they sit around the campfire and talk to their new friend, Ben can't resist his macho impulse to put the back-country Mick down. In this moment, shortly before the scales of destiny tip horribly against the trio, we catch  a glimpse of the real Mick hidden just below the cheerful exterior.Unfortunately, this is where the film became unpleasant to watch. I like my excessive gore just as much as the next guy, but I'm sick of watching people being sadistically tortured.When an alien spears a guy through the stomach and blood spews out of his mouth I lean forward, wide-eyed and say ""Holy Sh**! Did you see that! Sweet!"" and then I high-five the dude next to me. When some psycho paralyzes a girl with an 8inch hunting knife to the spine just as you think she's going to escape, then promises her a slow and painful death, or when he waves the same knife at a bound and bloody woman while he threatens to cut off her breasts, the only thing I feel is acute abhorrence.The kind of violence in these films is a calculated imitation of sexual sadism, whether the sexual gratification is made explicit or not. Torture for the sake of titillating the audience, making us uneasy and selling it as thrills, is a cheap parlor trick that takes advantage of our darkest impulses. We may not be aroused by torture, but we can't seem to look away either, and once we've made peace with consuming the pain of others for entertainment, we come back again and again. The Roman's discovered this in the Colosseum, and Hollywood has rediscovered it in the modern slasher film. The popularity of the SAW series is a testament to the fact that Torture Porn sells.I'm not judging those who loved this movie, and I'm not saying you're a sadist (although some fraction of Torture Porn fans most certainly are). Everyone is entitled to choose the type of film that entertains them, and censoring this type of content wouldn't change the fact that it would still sell. However, this film gets  2 stars from me for wasting its potential on base brutality, and this review is a warning to others who share my views not to subject themselves to this film.",2,Torture Porn Mars Masterful Build-up of Tension,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,3451,"['tension', 'created', 'Wolf-Creek', 'unbelievable', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'up', 'thriller', 'watched', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'when', 'was', '13', 'very', 'start', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'alienation', 'vulnerability', 'set', 'inhospitable', 'backdrop', 'Australian', 'outback.In', 'type', 'film', 'core', 'group', 'characters', 'usually', 'solid', 'foundation', 'comfort', 'zone', 'viewer', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'Safe', 'as', 'long', 'stick', 'together', 'Wolf-Creek', 'however', 'core', 'group', 'kind', 'cohesiveness', 'unexpected', 'element', 'characters', 'other', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'together.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'Liz', 'Christy', 'two', 'young', 'Brits', 'who', 'embark', 'spontaneous', 'tour', 'Australia', 'content', 'let', 'impulses', 'guide', 'Ben', 'reckless', 'bad-boy', 'type', 'girls', 'befriended', 'invited', 'along', 'such', 'constellation', 'sexual', 'tension', 'given', 'story', 'even', 'underway', 'uneasiness', 'fallen', 'trio.This', 'idle', 'tension', 'turbocharged', 'arrival', 'Mick', 'grizzled', ""'Outbacker"", 'who', 'youngsters', 'broken', 'down', 'car', 'isolated', 'park', 'middle', 'desert', 'affable', 'Ausie', 'offers', 'tow', 'car', 'garage', 'where', 'fix', 'up', 'send', 'way', 'sit', 'campfire', 'talk', 'new', 'friend', 'Ben', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'macho', 'impulse', 'put', 'back-country', 'Mick', 'down', 'moment', 'shortly', 'scales', 'destiny', 'tip', 'horribly', 'trio', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'real', 'Mick', 'hidden', 'just', 'cheerful', 'exterior.Unfortunately', 'where', 'film', 'became', 'unpleasant', 'watch', 'excessive', 'gore', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', ""'m"", 'sick', 'watching', 'people', 'being', 'sadistically', 'tortured.When', 'alien', 'guy', 'stomach', 'blood', 'spews', 'mouth', 'lean', 'forward', 'wide-eyed', 'say', 'Holy', 'Sh**', 'Did', 'see', 'Sweet', 'then', 'high-five', 'dude', 'next', 'When', 'psycho', 'girl', '8inch', 'hunting', 'knife', 'spine', 'just', 'think', 'going', 'escape', 'then', 'slow', 'painful', 'death', 'when', 'same', 'knife', 'bound', 'bloody', 'woman', 'cut', 'off', 'breasts', 'only', 'thing', 'feel', 'acute', 'abhorrence.The', 'kind', 'violence', 'films', 'calculated', 'imitation', 'sexual', 'sadism', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'made', 'explicit', 'not', 'Torture', 'sake', 'titillating', 'audience', 'making', 'uneasy', 'selling', 'thrills', 'cheap', 'parlor', 'trick', 'advantage', 'darkest', 'impulses', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aroused', 'torture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'look', 'away', 'once', ""'ve"", 'made', 'peace', 'consuming', 'pain', 'others', 'entertainment', 'come', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'Roman', 'discovered', 'Colosseum', 'Hollywood', 'rediscovered', 'modern', 'slasher', 'film', 'popularity', 'SAW', 'series', 'testament', 'fact', 'Torture', 'Porn', 'sells.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'judging', 'who', 'loved', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'re"", 'sadist', 'fraction', 'Torture', 'Porn', 'fans', 'most', 'certainly', 'are', 'Everyone', 'entitled', 'choose', 'type', 'film', 'censoring', 'type', 'content', 'would', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'would', 'still', 'sell', 'However', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'wasting', 'potential', 'base', 'brutality', 'review', 'warning', 'others', 'who', 'share', 'views', 'not', 'subject', 'film']",N/A

But as for people calling it gory, it wasn't that gory. Perhaps that's because I just saw Hostel before watching Wolf Creek or perhaps it takes a whole lot more gross-out to officially freak me out. Regardless, Wolf Creek is enjoyable and I should warn you to be prepared to wait a little bit for the set-up. But once it gets going, it is pretty creepy. 2 girls and a guy are making their way across Australia when they stop at a place called Wolf Creek. But when they go to leave, of course the car won't start. Enter a man from the Outback who  seems as friendly and charming as Crocodile Dundee. He offers to help them out and gives them a tow, but of course in grand scary movie tradition, this ""bloke"" is more than just a smidge unbalanced. One of the best things I can say for Wolf Creek is that I thought a certain outcome was evident (and to tell you would ruin it) but I was caught off guard.

642242,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JON3,Terry Mesnard,"[118, 138]","The thing about horror movie conventions is that you get stuck following them.  You get so used to them that you either figure the movie out before it even gets going or you might be scared but you're really simply going through the motions.  Then comes a movie that plays with conventions and, at times, decimates them.  You're no longer in your comfort zone.  You no longer know what's going to happen.  Wolf Creek is kind of like that movie.It begins slowly as a road trip film.  A great deal of the beginning is spent on developing characters (shock!  What a novel concept!).  At times it might drag a bit, but really its all set up.  A lot of negative reviewers have commented that its boring.  I guess in today's society of instant gratification I shouldn't be surprised...but I think the slower start works well for this movie.  There are a couple scenes setting up a feeling of unease in your stomach.  But what the beginning does really well is set you at ease before destroying that ease with one of the cruelest villains seen in today's horror film culture.What happens when the scares start is out of a nightmare.  I'm not going to say anything else about the plot because in the way it plays with conventions, there are some nice little twists in the plot.  It keeps you on your toes.  In fact, if you are an avid horror film buff, you will probably enjoy this movie the most simply because of the way it continues to crush horror film cliches and conventions.  I think that's what impressed me the most about this movie.  As a horror film buff, I sat there and watched in glee as things that normally happen in a horror film were turned on its head.  Also, like a fellow reviewer has mentioned, with a cast of 3 protagonists, there really is no ""cannon fodder.""  And you never know who will survive and who won't.  I really want to talk more about it but it will ruin some of the little twists that really make this film what it is.The movie is very dark in tone.  It reminded me of the feel of High Tension (another great horror film this year).  The gore isn't as over the top as High Tension which helps ground the film in the possible territory.  And Australia is the perfect location for this film.  The scenes of complete isolation and utter desolation; the kind where you don't know which way is which.  Its disorienting in a way that many horror films try to capture but never fully express.  Some scenes toward the end are so bleak and disorienting you can't help but feel lost and wondering if you were stranded out there what WOULD you do?This has been an ""interesting"" year for horror films.  On one hand there have been a ton of PG-13 horror films that have catered to the safe and money-making teen crowd.  These films offer mainly the ""boo"" scare with the loud music and close ups.  The kind of movie people shriek at because they are surprised, then spend the next ten minutes laughing about it.  And there have been a few movies that have been ""throw backs"" to the 1970/early 80s horror/gore flicks; the really in your face flicks that at one time defined what horror was.One of them took all of the bad parts of those films (The Devil's Rejects) and left out all of the good.  This film did the exact opposite.  What films like The Devil's Rejects forget is that violence for violence's sake does not instill terror.  However, when you care about the characters, like in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and in this film, the violence gets under your skin.  It gets into your head and you find yourself holding your breath that everyone makes it out okay...but knowing full well its not that kind of story.Wolf Creek: a must see.",5,Disturbingly great,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,3665,"['thing', 'horror', 'movie', 'conventions', 'get', 'stuck', 'following', 'get', 'so', 'used', 'figure', 'movie', 'out', 'even', 'going', 'might', 'be', 'scared', ""'re"", 'really', 'simply', 'going', 'motions', 'Then', 'movie', 'conventions', 'times', ""'re"", 'longer', 'comfort', 'zone', 'no', 'longer', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'kind', 'movie.It', 'slowly', 'road', 'trip', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'beginning', 'spent', 'developing', 'characters', 'shock', 'What', 'novel', 'concept', 'times', 'might', 'drag', 'bit', 'really', 'set', 'up', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'boring', 'guess', 'today', 'society', 'instant', 'gratification', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'think', 'slower', 'start', 'well', 'movie', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'setting', 'up', 'feeling', 'unease', 'stomach', 'what', 'beginning', 'really', 'well', 'set', 'ease', 'destroying', 'ease', 'one', 'cruelest', 'seen', 'today', 'horror', 'film', 'culture.What', 'when', 'scares', 'start', 'nightmare', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'plot', 'way', 'conventions', 'are', 'nice', 'little', 'twists', 'plot', 'toes', 'fact', 'are', 'avid', 'horror', 'film', 'buff', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'most', 'simply', 'way', 'crush', 'horror', 'film', 'cliches', 'conventions', 'think', 'what', 'impressed', 'most', 'movie', 'horror', 'film', 'buff', 'sat', 'there', 'watched', 'glee', 'things', 'normally', 'happen', 'horror', 'film', 'were', 'turned', 'head', 'Also', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'cast', '3', 'protagonists', 'really', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'never', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'talk', 'more', 'will', 'ruin', 'little', 'twists', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'is.The', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'tone', 'reminded', 'feel', 'High', 'Tension', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'year', 'gore', ""n't"", 'as', 'top', 'High', 'Tension', 'film', 'possible', 'territory', 'Australia', 'perfect', 'location', 'film', 'scenes', 'complete', 'isolation', 'utter', 'desolation', 'kind', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'disorienting', 'way', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'try', 'capture', 'never', 'fully', 'express', 'scenes', 'end', 'are', 'so', 'bleak', 'disorienting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'lost', 'wondering', 'were', 'stranded', 'out', 'what', 'WOULD', 'do', 'been', 'interesting', 'year', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'hand', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'ton', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'catered', 'safe', 'money-making', 'teen', 'crowd', 'films', 'offer', 'mainly', 'boo', 'scare', 'loud', 'music', 'close', 'ups', 'kind', 'movie', 'people', 'shriek', 'are', 'surprised', 'then', 'spend', 'next', 'ten', 'minutes', 'laughing', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'throw', 'backs', '1970/early', '80s', 'horror/gore', 'flicks', 'really', 'face', 'flicks', 'one', 'time', 'defined', 'what', 'horror', 'was.One', 'took', 'bad', 'parts', 'films', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'left', 'out', 'good', 'film', 'did', 'exact', 'opposite', 'What', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'forget', 'violence', 'violence', 'sake', 'not', 'instill', 'terror', 'However', 'when', 'care', 'characters', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'film', 'violence', 'skin', 'head', 'find', 'holding', 'breath', 'everyone', 'out', 'okay', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'not', 'kind', 'story.Wolf', 'Creek', 'must', 'see']",N/A

Now the psycho killer has terrorized the victim, viciously murdered the second or third banana in the cast in front of them, and--these days--sawed off a toe or finger or ear or limb...but the victim will knock down the psycho and run away, leaving the psycho to gather his wits and come after them again.That happens in WOLF CREEK, another exercise in depressing sadism.  The surviving girls knock out the psycho killer (with a shovel, I think) and try to run away.  Just once I'd like to see a movie where the victim goes all kinds of crazy on the psycho with that shovel or club or whatever blunt instrument they use and make really sure he isn't coming after them again.But this is just another tedious movie where young women are tortured and menaced by some gleeful maniac.

642245,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B00005JON3,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 1]","I was immediately intrigued about this film after reading quotes like ""not since the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre has terror felt so real"" and ""as good as horror gets"", as well with the extra hype added in that this was based on true events. Nevertheless, I also I had my doubts too. When any film is being compared to the level of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  I have my doubts, because no horror movie, before or since, has quite been able to reach that level. And no, this movie does not reach that threshold of horror, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. The story of the film, though rather quite simple, is good, the acting is surprisingly good as well. The film does have a ""documentary-style"" feeling to it. There are a lot of close-ups and shaky hand-held camera shots, and the actors seem to be really talking and communicating with each other, rather than just acting out lines of written dialog. What I didn't like as the length of time (almost an hour) in the film before anything really started happening. I would be willing to let this go if there was any real plot development during that first hour, but nothing really important or valuable to the overall story happens during this time. But once the movie kicks in, its quite good. There's an excellent torture scene that I enjoyed, (that sounds a bit sick, doesn't it? lol), as well as a couple of excellent chase scenes. Another thing that jumped out at me, was how the movie fools you into thinking certain characters are gonna survive, only to kill them off. I'm not going to give away the ending, but to me, the character that I would have least likely thought of being the sole survivor, actually does survive! This doesn't happen that often in these type of films. But while I'm on the subject of survivors, I did think that the body count was way lower than it should have been. And though, it was implied that the killer had murdered many others, you only get to see a handful of kills. Perhaps another character or two should have been added in some way, or maybe a quick flashback to a previous murder would have worked. I guess I'm just sick, but some more killing would have been nice!! Now as far as  this DVD goes, the special features are ok. There's a director's commentary thats pretty good as well as 50 minute ""Making of Wolf Creek"", which is pretty decent. There's also 1 deleted scene, which I hope was included as a joke or something, cause it's really short and stupid. But all in all, this film is definitely worth buying if you're a horror fan. And though I wouldn't consider this movie a modern day classic, nor put it anywhere near the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it does have a certain look and feel to it that makes it good little horror movie.",4,"A Well Done, Low-Budget Horror Flick",1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,2770,"['was', 'immediately', 'intrigued', 'film', 'reading', 'quotes', 'not', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'terror', 'felt', 'so', 'real', 'as', 'good', 'horror', 'well', 'extra', 'hype', 'added', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Nevertheless', 'also', 'had', 'doubts', 'too', 'When', 'film', 'being', 'compared', 'level', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'have', 'doubts', 'horror', 'movie', 'quite', 'been', 'able', 'reach', 'level', 'movie', 'not', 'reach', 'threshold', 'horror', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'story', 'film', 'rather', 'quite', 'simple', 'good', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'have', 'documentary-style', 'feeling', 'are', 'lot', 'close-ups', 'shaky', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'shots', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'really', 'talking', 'communicating', 'other', 'rather', 'just', 'acting', 'out', 'lines', 'written', 'dialog', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'length', 'time', 'almost', 'hour', 'film', 'anything', 'really', 'started', 'happening', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'let', 'go', 'there', 'was', 'real', 'plot', 'development', 'first', 'hour', 'nothing', 'really', 'important', 'valuable', 'overall', 'story', 'time', 'once', 'movie', 'kicks', 'quite', 'good', 'excellent', 'torture', 'scene', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'sick', ""n't"", 'lol', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'excellent', 'chase', 'scenes', 'thing', 'jumped', 'out', 'was', 'how', 'movie', 'thinking', 'certain', 'characters', 'are', 'gon', 'survive', 'only', 'kill', 'off', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'likely', 'thought', 'being', 'sole', 'survivor', 'actually', 'survive', ""n't"", 'happen', 'often', 'type', 'films', ""'m"", 'subject', 'survivors', 'did', 'think', 'body', 'count', 'was', 'way', 'lower', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'implied', 'killer', 'had', 'murdered', 'many', 'others', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'handful', 'kills', 'Perhaps', 'character', 'two', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'way', 'maybe', 'quick', 'flashback', 'previous', 'murder', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'sick', 'more', 'killing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Now', 'as', 'far', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'ok', 'director', 'commentary', 'thats', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', '50', 'minute', 'Making', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'pretty', 'decent', 'also', '1', 'deleted', 'scene', 'hope', 'was', 'included', 'joke', 'something', 'cause', 'really', 'short', 'stupid', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'movie', 'modern', 'day', 'classic', 'put', 'anywhere', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'have', 'certain', 'look', 'feel', 'good', 'little', 'horror', 'movie']",N/A
642246,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JON3,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[1, 3]","Director:  Greg McLeanCast:  John Jarratt, Cassandra McGrath, Kestie Morassi, Nathan Phillips, Gordon Poole, Guy O'Donnell.Running Time:  99 minutesRated R for R for strong gruesome violence, and for language.Three young vacationers are traveling through Australia visiting landmarks and such. One of their most anticipated stops is an ancient meteorite crater park called ""Wolf Creek."" After enjoying the sights the group prepares to leave, but can't start the car. Their watches have also stopped and a strange, almost supernatural, unease rests in on them. They nervously wait until a kindly stranger (John Jarratt) comes by and tows them to his house and offers to fix their car for free; however, they soon find out that this ""kindly stranger"" isn't so kind at all.  The resulting film is a well-done, tense horror story. Like many other films to come out of Australia the main story element here is the land and its mystery and as each character tries to escape they are literally swallowed up by the land. The unresolved enigma that the film presents is it's main strength; it can be seen as a metaphor for hell, the personification of true hopelessness, and a regular horror film viewer will be able to draw and appreciate many other things from it. Also much like the recent ""High Tension"" from France, the film is told in practically real-time as each character tries to desperately climb out of their horrifying situation and figure out what is going on, but primarily they just want to get the hell out of there.Director/writer Greg McLean takes an incredibly long time to set his story up, although it didn't really seem that long to me. The first two thirds of the movies unfold like a love story rather than a horror flick. The cinematography is beautiful and it's real nice to see the three main characters hanging out, having fun and falling in love with each other as they travel across the country. Those aren't your average shallow horror characters. You can identify with those people, you like them and the more you do, the more you feel uncomfortable as they descend into trouble.  The cast is surprisingly very strong; you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone looking as genuinely terrified on screen as Cassandra Magrath and Kestie Morassi. They act and react just like you'd imagine someone in their situation would. John Jarratt as the villain, however, steals the show. Again, this guy just seems so real; you could easily see yourself falling for his tricks only to wake up to him torturing you. This is no chainsaw swinging, skin wearing monster, but a seemingly regular guy that turns out to be a relentless psychopath.  Greg McLean may not re-invent the wheel with ""Wolf Creek"" but he manages to drive an old genre to near perfection. The movie remains unpredictable throughout and never relies on old tricks. The most disturbing thing about ""Wolf Creek"" is that you really feel like this could happen to you, which is quite an achievement in a genre that's usually so over the top, it makes you laugh instead of scaring you.

Now, I suppose I am spoiled, but considering the indy movies can't compete with Hollywood productions' budgets (and therefore have low-grade sets and effects), I expect the scripts to be original and refreshing. I think everyone is sick of the cliches and formula plots in most of the current Hollywood movies, which is why the indy scene is so hot right now: indy movies offer originality, right? Enter Wolf Creek.If there is a horror movie out there that has more Hollywood cliches in it, I have yet to see it (thank god). Wolf Creek reminds me of those mid-80's slasher movies, where you could predict EXACTLY what was going to happen through the ENTIRE movie, and you only watched it to see the gross and fun way people were killed. The standard horror film formula was tired even back then, and here we have a movie made 20 years later using the same unoriginal plot points. Lets see how many Wolf Creek formula moments we can list, shall we?(WARNING: Some minor SPOILERS are contained below, do not continue reading if you wish to be 'surprised' at just how bad this movie really is for yourself):1) Group of carefree teens on vacation that turns into a nightmare: CHECK!2) Jerky, documentary-feel camerawork to give a more 'immediate' feel (and to cover the lack of budget with effects and stunts): CHECK!3) Plot device to strand said teens in a remote location, with no one around, so mayhem can ensue: CHECK!4) Crazy bad guy who seems unassuming at first: CHECK!5) Girl who seems unassuming at first, then turns tough as she faces the bad guy: CHECK!6) Tough girl gets bad guy down, then drops weapon and runs without finishing him off: CHECK!7) Bad guy seems to die from wound that would kill any other human, but then gets up and is completely fine and unhampered from what should be a fatal wound. He was only playing dead!: CHECK!8) Girl is in imminent danger from bad guy returning at any second, yet stops to calmly review the bad guy's history by examining convenietly placed evidence: CHECK!9) Girls are INCREDIBLY stupid, doing things so dumb that no real person would ever do them, but if the girls aren't written to be dumb so as to extend the story, the movie would be over in under an hour: CHECK!10) Car has trouble starting at key moment, even though it was running fine just a moment ago: CHECK!11) Bad guy seems to be able to read minds, as he shows up at EXACTLY the right place and EXACTLY the right time (unseen, no less)to prevent escape, despite having no way to know this: CHECK!12) In the middle of nowhere, miles from anything, a car drives by to rescue teen in peril: CHECK!13)I won't give away the ending really, but if you have seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, its the EXACT SAME ENDING! How original!Wolf Creek takes what are now formula ideas from Friday The 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Blair Witch Project and creates a COMPLETELY predictable, stupid horror movie. There are NO suprises, NO originality, and couple that with the average acting, poor camerawork, and low budget, you get a HORRIBLE MOVIE. If you are the type that enjoys formula horror movies, Wolf Creek is a barely passable movie in that regard.One final point I should bring up is that the movie claims this is 'based on a true story'. It probably is based on a real case. The problem is that 85% of the events in the film had NO surviving witnesses! So 15% of the film could be verified, and 85% was just imagined by a scriptwriter?? Boy, that's some accurate portrayal of a true story!!I was left sratching my head as to why the 'unrated' DVD was unrated. There wasn't all that much gore (the tiny budget didn't allow for much in the way of effects). I've seen a lot worse gore in Friday the 13th movies, and they were R rated. There is no nudity or sex, and the swearing is rather minimal. The 'unrated' tag is obviously just a SALES PLOY.All in all, Wolf Creek is a boring, formula horror movie chock-full of stupid cliches.

The film shows one fictional groups encounter with this man and shows just how twisted some people can be. If this were a fictional slasher film, I'd call it nothing special.

Stay clear from this movie. This is a serious horror flick like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, High Tension, House of/The Devil's Rejects.

People usually get lost and die from the extreme heat in the day and extreme cold at night in addition to starvation.

642253,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JON3,trebe,"[3, 3]","Filmmaker Greg McLean's conceived the basic story for Wolf Creek several years before it came to the screen.  His goal was to do a distinctly Australian horror thriller.  Apparently, elements from a real case involving a serial killer who preyed on hikers, and other actual crimes, were later incorporated into the screenplay.  While not strictly `based on actual events' as is stated at the beginning of the film, Wolf Creek is a chilling tale featuring a ruthless and sadistic predator, with a long history of murder and torture in the Australian outback.The killer is a bushman named Mick Taylor (John Jarratt), and his latest victims are a trio of visitors to Wolf Creek National Park.  Aussie Ben Mitchell (Nathan Phillips), is travelling with a couple of British tourists, dark haired Liz Hunter (Cassandra Magrath) and fair haired Kristy Earl (Kestie Morassi).  After spending the day hiking around the scenic meteor crater, the group find themselves alone and stranded, when their car fails to start.  Spending the night in the car, they are awakened by the arrival of a tow truck.  The driver Mick, seems friendly and willing to help, so they hitch up the car and tow it back to Mick's place, what appears to be some kind of mine somewhere deep in the boonies.  After a little supper around the campfire, the tourists bed down for the night with no worries, while good old Mick gets down to working on repairing their vehicle . . . . .. . . . . well unfortunately Mick is into brutality, rape, and torture, and for the three unlucky travelers, life will never be the same again.  Much of the film from this point forward follows the actions of Liz and Kristy as they attempt to escape from a sadistic killer, who is an expert hunter, tracker, and marksman.While there are some questionable plot developments that challenge logic, overall the story holds together pretty well, with a strong atmosphere of fear, urgency, and terror.  And when Mick gets riled up, he's one mean and nasty guy.  The grisly act of making a `head on a stick', is just a source of amusement for his twisted mind.  Not to reveal specifics, but this is one nightmare that doesn't end well.The DVD's special features include the `The Making of Wolf Creek' an excellent, extremely comprehensive documentary that covers most of the key aspects of the making of the film.  The film also has a commentary track with McLean, actors Kestie Morassi, and Cassandra Magrath, and executive producer Matt Hearn.  The commentary is informative, but being generally lighter in tone, at times it may seem somewhat inappropriate for the grim happenings on screen.  Wolf Creek was shot in high definition video, with much of the footage shot with the camera hand held.  The reasons for doing this were to give the film a `documentary' type look, capture high definition images, and also enable the film to be shot at a faster pace, and less expensively.Wolf Creek is an impressive feature film debut for writer/director Greg McLean, who succeeds in his goal of bringing to the screen the chilling story of a sociopathic killer loose in the Australian outback.  McLean would return to present another unique view of Australia in his next film, Rogue (2008), an exciting adventure featuring a giant killer crocodile.

Cassandra Magrath's character Liz receives the most screen time and is in many ways the protagonist. Yes it's been praised by the critics for its relative realism compared to other horror movies, and knowing very little about Australia this introduced me a bit to the beautiful landscape and gave me a sense of the vastness of the ""outback.""What all of this adds to the film beyond giving it good reviews is hard to gauge. You might feel emotionally worse after this than other slashers. You identify a bit more than usual with the victims although their questionable actions during the action sequences will jeopardize this for some viewers.

642255,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,B00005JON3,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""","[13, 14]","There has been a suprising rush of really great horror movies all of a sudden.  We got ""Hostel"", then ""The Hills Have Eyes"", and now the top-notch ""Wolf Creek"".  I hope this trend continues for a long, long time.Wolf Creek is a movie rooted in fact, which makes it slightly more disturbing than the average horror film.  When I say rooted in fact, I don't mean ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" rooted in fact (which is to say, never happened at all - and all the people who claim that it did are morons who can't figure out how to use a search engine or hit a library.  The original director himself admits he made the idea up while in a hardware store one day staring at a rack of chainsaws).  The killer in this movie is modeled around Ivan Milat, a man who was convicted of killing seven backpackers in Australia (although he has been implicated in at least 28 total dissapearances).  There are lots of little details in the film that reference the actual killings as well.  *potential spoiler here here of what happens to a character*  Ivan did in fact stab his victims at the base of the spine, which paralyzed them, and he did keep all of their sleeping bags and passports in his home.The buildup in this movie is much better than most horror films.  Remember watching ""I still know what you did last summer"", waiting for the annoying banter between the cannon fod - I mean well developed main characters, to finally come to an end and the action to start?  Well, here the banter isn't annoying.  It's plausible, it's acted well, and it reminded me of why alcohol is so great!  The first fifteen minutes of this movie is one big drunk road trip, and it's actually interesting.  There's a bit of a love triangle presented, but thankfully they don't go too far with it, otherwise we would have ended up with an annoying Freddy Prince Jr. / Jennifer Love Hewitt set up where the man had to be all heroic and try to save the day for his lady-in-waiting.  Almost every scene in this film has a really gorgeous or inventive shot.  We are shown a birds-eye view of a meterorite crater, which gives a creepy feel, considering the impact of the meteror would have annihilated everything for miles.  The scene were we see a character being tortured - but threw though the eyes of another character peeking through a dirty window, is a also really nice touch.The actual ""horror"" portion of the film is pretty brutal - thought not quite as gory as ""The Hills Have Eyes"" or ""Hostel"".  Here we start to see a trend in gore (which occured in both of those films and again here in Wolf Creek), that of characters losing their fingers.  Must have been a sale on fake fingers or something and all horor directors went shopping the same day.  The hunting/torturing/killing is varied, and overall very satisfying.  I particular liked one kill in which, after a frantic chase, an almost anti-climatic death occurs where the killer simply shoots the victim in the back, and then goes on with his day as though nothing really out of the ordinary just occured.  As long as we are the topic of how horrifying horror movies are - what's with the reviewers giving this movie 1 star because of how brutal it is?  It's not like this movie was advertised as something that wouldn't involve torture and death - why did any of you watch it in the first place if you find this sort of material offensive?  It's not really a difficult concept to grasp.  If you are morally offended by killing, don't watch a movie about murder.There actually were several times in the film that seemed to build and then give you something anti-climatic, and honestly it seems to work here.  When we are sure one character must survive - for this person has discovered the awful truth and has been generally ""horror movie smart"" throughout the entire film, doom appears in the form of a knife in the back, and that's that.  The feeling the movie gives you when this sort of thing occurs is really what makes it a cut above the competition.  I've noticed quite a bit of complaint about a portion of the movie where one of the characters makes the choice to actually go back to the site of where the torturing began, even though the killer is still on the loose, because obviously no one would actually do this - they'd be running far, far away.  I'll concede that this is a valid point, very few individuals would actually do this.  However, if all people acted properly and tried to get themselves as far away from danger as possible, horror movies would be about 20 minutes long, so give the movie a little room to stretch your plausibility here.There seems to be some pretty mixed feelings about the ending.  Personally I didn't really feel strongly one way or another.  The ending was servicable, and it did fit the tone of the film, just ignore the made up text on the screen - none of that actually occured in the real events the movie is based on.",4,Suprisingly

But even with almost an hour of buildup and establishment, I still felt no connection to the characters. The characters themselves were just not that interesting to begin with so when the action picks up, I couldn't find any pity or horror towards them.As for the horror part of this film, well, lets just say it is nonexistant. Perhaps for those who frighten easily, you may find this disturbing and creepy, but in reality, it wasn't all that scary or chilling. Supposedly based on a true story, it just doesn't work onscreen, especially since there were pretty much no witnesses from the original crime, so most of it feels made up, hence, making it less than frightening.The violence and gore are mediocre, not even remotely comparable to similar torture films, like any of the Saw films, or even Hostel, which is also slow to pick up. Again, for those squeemish people, it may be disturbing, but I felt none of that. The characters themselves suffer from the familiar clich&eacute;; doing stupid stuff in a horror movie. Some of it is eye roll inducing. There is one gag that is actually pretty sick, called 'head on a stick', which works really well in the scene, but the event leading right up to that is pretty ridiculous and disbelieving.The acting is pretty decent by everyone and the film has a sort of Indie look to it, but that is all it has going for it. There really is no actual plot besides the one that picks up about 3/4 of the way in. Just way too slow and lacking in actual scares and tention.

642260,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B00005JON3,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[4, 4]","Wolf creek is an utterly entertaining even if a sadistic horror movie. A lot of reviewers panned this as being too gory. High profile reviewers saying that it crosses the line. I don't know what all the fuss is about. Its got less than a quarter of the gore of say texas chain saw massacre (new one) or say hostel1&2. I found the movie had more of a pshycological fear infused in it due to the character of the australian boogie man aka crocodile dundee character. The story starts of as 2 girls and a guy leave by car to visit the wolf creek a site in the australian outback where the characters plan to hike around. The find their car break down and then are offered help by a supposedly good samaritan ""crocodile dundie"" type of guy who seems to be a local and conversant with the area. They take the help to be towed by the dundee's guy's pickup. Only it lands out to be a bad deal for them. They just got towed to their deaths. This apparently happy go lucky naive, bumbling along help-a-friend-in-need cheerful stranger happens to be as cheerful when killing people. It's different from the regular slasher film because I felt the terror of this villain. The way he snickers and speaks. He is a true sadist but it's no where near as gory as hostel. The most gory it got to to which some reviewers expressed dissent as being inappropriate was when the villain guy apparently severes the spinal chord of one of the girls with a dagger. Now this is shown in an abtuse way. We dont really see the actual deed in gory detail. If you consider the circular saws, blow torches and drills used to tear apart the faces in hostel, or the hellish implements used to squash, impale and twist people to ther deaths in say the saw series, this movie is very tame indeed.

I have seen more than my share of bad acting and choppy film making in my day, and Wolf Creek was far from bad. Without looking at what other's wrote, here goes:Wolf Creek is a refreshing and somewhat unique horror movie set in Australia. 3 partiers set off across the country, and end up in need of help in a very remote location. It is here that the story begins.While none of the story elements are unique (car breaking down, young post-teens, remote country hick killer, etc), the execution is perfect. Wolf Creek had me scared, and on the edge of my seat. There are few horror movies that have done this to me. I was totally immersed in the film.The acting was amazing and completely believable. The actor's fear became our terror. Your heart will race when the victims are being pursued. The filmmaking was top notch as well. Despite the low budget, the lighting and feel of the movie is creepy and does nothing but add to the terror.The best part of the film for me are the locations. The killer's hangout is quite unique, and definately not a place I would like to visit.Wolf Creek does an amazing job of selling the story as a completely plausable situation. I could believe that these events really could happen, regardless of whether they actually did or not. Wolf Creek doesn't turn the villain into a bad-dialogue shouting goon, and doesn't turn the victims into cliches.Please also note that this film does not rely on gore or torture as fear tactics. While there are a couple of glimpses at other dead victims, Wolf Creek does not try to shock you through gore; it frightens you with the story.Of all the horror movies I have seen in my life, and I have seen many, I would rank Wolf Creek in the top 5 overall. With a great combination of pitch, acting, feel and (of course) fear, Wolf Creek will not disappoint. I don't have a clue why this film received low ratings: this is no Freddy vs. Jason, or Jason is space. Try Wolf Creek, you won't regret it.Total Score (out of 100) = 9047 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

642267,A23P4LNAA0KKQO,B00005JON3,"yajdubuddah ""yajarod""","[1, 4]","Wolf Creek is a low budget independently made Australian film from novice director Greg McLean. Wolf Creek was picked up at that year's Sundance Film Festival, which led to a highly successful worldwide release.Wolf Creek gained quite a degree of notoriety due to its claiming to be based on true events. Although it should be added that when examined this is a somewhat dubious claim. The film is loosely based on several Australian cases - that of Ivan Milat who was convicted of the so-called Backpacker Murders, of killing seven different tourists in New South Wales during the 1990s. In particular, the film draws itself from the case of Bradley John Murdoch who in 2005 was convicted to 28 years for the murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio at Barrow Creek in the Northern Territories in 2001. Murdoch waved down the car of Falconio and his girlfriend Joanna Lees where he shot Falconio and brutalized Lees. Falconio's body was never found, although Lees escaped and later identified Murdoch, who was condemned along with other crucial (albeit disputed) pieces of evidence. The Falconio murder trial loomed even further over Wolf Creek when it was released and a court order banned the film in the Northern Territories so as not to influence the outcome of the Murdoch trial. It should also be noted that, though claiming extensively to be based on a true story, Wolf Creek varies widely from the Murdoch-Falconio case - in real life it was the woman who survived, not the guy; while the film moves the location of the murders from the Northern Territories to Wolf Creek (in actuality spelt Wolfe Creek) National Park in the state of Western Australia (which are in reality separated by some 2000 miles distance).While some US critics slammed the film for cruelly sensationalising a true life incident, in truth Wolf Creek is best regarded as being akin to a film like Open Water (2003), which starts with a true story but quickly comes to the point of being total fictional speculation about what happened. Indeed you can say that Wolf Creek is really the Australian equivalent of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), which similarly made up a claim to be based on truth. The similarities between Wolf Creek and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre do not end there - Wolf Creek could really be Texas Chain Saw fed through the digitally-shot, handheld aesthetic of The Blair Witch Project (1999). Wolf Creek also buys into many of the caricatures of the whole Texas Chain Saw, Straw Dogs (1971) and Deliverance (1972) Backwoods Brutality cycle - the overriding sense in these films that city slickers have passed beyond a point where the rules of civilisation exist any longer and the land there is dominated by hicks and psychopaths who outrightly jeer at their city ways, or much worse. Wolf Creek even has the same plot structure as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, including the extended build-up before the travellers are tortured and the detailed escape and pursuit of one of the girls. Wolf Creek also came out the same year - and has many similarities to - Hostel (2005), which was also about a trio of backpackers who unwittingly stray into a remote area of the world where they are imprisoned and become sadistic torture playthings. Wolf Creek and Hostel even have a near-identical scene where one of the main protagonists gets their fingers severed.Wolf Creek received a good deal of criticism during its premiere in the US, of being called repellent, nasty and irredeemable. Roger Ebert even confessed to ""wanting to walk out of the theatre and keep on walking"". Wolf Creek comes out the same time as a number of other films - Auditon (1999), Oldboy (2003), Saw (2004), The Devil's Rejects (2005) and Hostel - have all been determined to push an envelope in terms of on-screen sadism. Wolf Creek is fairly harrowing, although I must say that in terms of some of these others - the gruelling suspense of Saw, the intensely uncomfortable climax of Audition, the nasty extremes of Hostel, the morally inverted mean-spiritedness of Rob Zombie's films, or the sublime weirdness of The Ordeal (2004) - Wolf Creek seems a little tame in comparison. It's all relative of course - Wolf Creek, had it come at any other period, might have been seen as one of the better Texas Chain Saw imitators, but surrounded by these others seems to be somewhat restrained. Certainly the scene where John Jarratt snips off Cassandra Magrath's fingers and then impales a knife in her spine calling her ""a head on a stick"", and some of the torture scenes, go some brutal way towards these other films. And Greg McLean's rawness - both in the entirely naturalistic handheld photography and during the harrowing brutality of the various climactic chase scenes - is commendable.On another whole level, Wolf Creek seems to be a film about the mythology of Australian cinema. Greg McLean throws in a number of direct cinematic quotes - like the scene where John Jarratt revs his car to come after the escaping Kestie Morassi, where McLean deliberately styles the shots of Jarratt ominously waiting in his car after the introduction of Mel Gibson waiting in his high-power Interceptor in the opening scene of Mad Max (1979). Although the most noticeable of the quotes is from Crocodile Dundee (1986) - the ""That's not a knife - this is a knife"" speech - which is later turned into something nasty. While John Jarratt's playing tends towards broad caricature at times, you can see that his bushman character has really been intended as a dark inversion of Crocodile Dundee, where the film turns the Paul Hogan's bushman persona on its head and reveals it as a dangerous psychopath. Australian cinema also has a fascination with the wide-open emptiness of The Outback (the desert area that comprises some 70% of the country). In Australian cinema, The Outback is variously seen as lurking with psychopaths - as in Roadgames (1981), Razorback (1984), Kiss or Kill (1997) - or the mysterious and unexplained - as in The Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), Incident at Raven's Gate (1988) and Undead (2003). Greg McLean taps into both. Aside from the lurking psychopath, he also constantly edges towards the mystical and unexplained. People discuss stories about mysterious UFO appearances or entire towns that somehow became lost during storms. And he has chosen the very mysterious location of the real life Wolfe Creek meteor crater that seemingly has the ability to cause watches and vehicle engines to inexplicably stop (which almost suggests something of the looming geological mystery of Hanging Rock in The Picnic at Hanging Rock).",3,not bad but also not texas,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,6612,"['Wolf', 'Creek', 'low',

The movie makes you sit on the edge of your seat and root for the victims.  I also liked the actor who played the killer.  His abilities were above and beyond the call of duty.  He has that good guy charm and then, you see this creepy unstable psychopathic maniac evolve.  You really feel for the characters in the film.  It plays on your emotions, that to me makes for a good CREEPY horror/thriller.",4,I ate my fingernails,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,486,"['Wolf', 'creek', 'out', 'bit', 'slow', 'like', 'build', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'sit', 'edge', 'seat', 'root', 'victims', 'also', 'liked', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'killer', 'abilities', 'were', 'above', 'call', 'duty', 'good', 'guy', 'charm', 'then', 'see', 'creepy', 'unstable', 'psychopathic', 'maniac', 'evolve', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'film', 'emotions', 'good', 'CREEPY', 'horror/thriller']",N/A
