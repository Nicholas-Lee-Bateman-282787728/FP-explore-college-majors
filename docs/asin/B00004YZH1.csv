This was by far the best introduction to the method I have encountered.  The poses are not too difficult, but they are a challenge to someone without a lot of fexability.  The key is the low intemidation presentation by the instructor.  I never felt as if I was being talked down to.  Ms Ivanhoe is very encouraging and helps the student along with a winning smile and gentle support.

560495,AJBOVYHPQVOFO,B00004YZH1,Anne Gillingham,"[6, 6]","Just commenting on the sun-salute --Sara Ivanhoe does a great job. She does more of a modified sun-salutation, but fine. I think she enriches it.She models it for you, and you follow her. My only pet-peeve, is that she doesn't explain, at all, what it is. If it were more clear, perhaps it would be more meaningful.The book, Yoga for Dummies, by the way, is great. They explain, that the sun-salutation is a 'dynamic posture,' meaning, as I understand it, a series of moving stretches, like, a flowing stretch routine.Flowing stretch routines are really good if you want to build strength and flexibility. The Sun Salutation really helps me with that. This workout is really good for your spine and lungs.Back to the yoga book, (bear with me here) we benefit from the sun's life-giving powers. (Like, no sun, no life) Feuerstein and Payne say remember that your body is condensed sunlight! So, from a spiritual viewpoint, the light in you (your spirit) salutes its own provider, the sun itself.As far as the ''workout'' goes, it is 5 min. of warm-up, that she flows into the sun-salute. She presents the sun salute, adding the components, piece by piece. It is about 15 min of more strenuous reps. She does about 10 minutes of cool-down, including spine-twist seated-stretches (you have to see it).Great video. I do use it all the time. It is applicable to all levels. For a beginner, this is a total workout.

The format is fairly simple--Sara Ivanhoe introduces 12 yoga poses, which you hold for six (deep) breaths each. The poses are easy in the beginning and end, and hardest in the middle.I can't say enough great things about Sara--she's encouraging and soothing, not grating. Her explanations are thorough and easy to understand. This DVD made me want to check out her other DVDs, which I also like.  But I find that I just don't want to do this DVD anymore.  At 46 minutes, it's a long workout, yet you only do 12 yoga poses in that time period.  That's just too slow for me, and fast-forwarding through all the instruction is not practical.  For daily practice, you really need something that flows better than this.  Basic Yoga for Dummies is a good introduction to yoga, but you will outgrow it quickly. Look into Sara's Crunch: Candlelight Yoga for a relaxing, flowing practice, with a similar difficulty level.There's also a bonus 30 minute workout on the DVD.  It basically teaches you sun salutations, a basic flowing routine of yoga poses.  It moves at a much faster pace than the regular workout and gets my heart rate up a bit.

560506,A18VVDLRLG9SVO,B00004YZH1,Kimberly Wells,"[14, 15]","I had wanted to try Yoga, even tried another tape at one time and just didn't care for it.  My hamstrings are really tight, and I've always felt that I just could not do the exercises-- the other tape I did confirmed that opinion because it just jumped into major stretching without much warm up, and did not show any modifications.  It also was a little irritatingly ""new age""-- and though I know that meditation is a crucial part of Yoga, I was not interested in turning it into a religion-- which the other tape seemed intent on doing.So this tape, with it's no nonsense approach, coaxed me into liking it.  Some of the stretching is hard-- I can certainly see why people like Madonna are so buff in the arm muscles-- it takes effort to do the poses for the 6 breaths you have to hold them.  The instructor is not too ""simperingly"" sweet, but clear, precise, and friendly.  No annoying giggling, or over coaching like a cheeerleader (""come on, you can do it, you deserve to be fit cause you're a great person"" blech)  I feel I can continue doing this workout for a while, learn the basics, and maybe move into more complex work, which the later half of the DVD provides.You should have a chair handy when you start, and maybe one of those easy to find yoga mats (I got mine half price at a discount store).  Also, maybe a towel, and some sort of band (a belt might work, but they sell special yoga bands too) for one of the poses.  Try to clear your head as much as possible-- since you have to breathe through your nose, if you have any allergies (which I do) try to control the stuffiness if you can.  (I know that sounds weird, but it will make it more pleasant if you can do the breathing).  There is an option on the DVD for instructor cuing only-- so you can play your own music and still get the cues.Finally, for people worried about calorie burning.  According to a website that I use to monitor calories burned vs. activities (it's free-- write to me if you want to learn the URL) the 51 minutes of stretching yoga that this DVD/video gives you burns a total of 165 calories.  You burn approx. 3 calories per minute.  It's not exactly boot camp, and it is not cardio, but combined with a cross-training sort of program, this is a good light calorie burning day stretch.  It's important, when you're trying to sculpt those muscles, to stretch them out. This video/DVD will be a crucial step to doing that.  This may not be the DVD/video for people who are into the more spiritual aspects of Yoga, but she does address them some, enough for those of us who don't want to go too far into it.

I have been interested in Yoga for years, but due to lack of funds and time have never been able to actually go to a yoga class.  Instead I  bought several videos, some better than others.  The problem was that I always felt I was doing things wrong, and unfortunately non of the other videos ever took the time to really explain what I was supposed to be doing.  This DVD is different.  It explains in detail the correct way to perform each posture without being condesending, tedious or intimidating.  It gives down-to-earth instruction for people who want to learn yoga, without necessarily getting deep into the spiritual aspect of yoga.  The DVD allows you to skip to specific poses which you may want to review, and it includes a basic 12 posture workout and an intermediate workout which goes into 9 poses you can graduate to once you feel comfortable with the first 12.  After watching this DVD I am able to go back and watch and follow my other yoga videos knowing that I am doing the postures correctly.  I also feel much more confident about moving on to other yoga videos with more challenging postures.  Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies has really helped me improve my yoga practice.

560511,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00004YZH1,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 5]","Basic Yoga Workout For Dummies is a fine instructional DVD with a yoga expert, Sara Ivanhoe, who patiently and respectfully teaches basic yoga and even some intermediate yoga exercises to help people get fit. Sara Ivanhoe presents the material in a non-threatening way to entice you to do the workouts; and the exercises move along at a good pace without ever being boring. Of course if you miss a point or two here and there you can always just re-watch that video clip as many more times as you like. The quality of the sound is excellent.Sara Ivanhoe starts the workout by giving you basic advice about getting set-up for the basic yoga workout: wear comfortable clothes; don't eat before exercising; drink water; exercise in your bare feet if at all possible; use a chair if you need one and much more. Excellent.The bulk of the DVD video is the basic yoga workout. Sara breaks this down into twelve smaller exercises which she calls ""postures,"" ""poses"" or ""the daily dozen."" The video makes it so easy for you to follow along; you simply just watch how she uses a floor mat or a chair to do these twelve exercises. Watch and follow along and you'll learn the ""cat pose;"" the ""mountain pose;"" the ""standing forward pose"" (which helps to stretch); the ""lunge pose"" and other exercises including the ""seated forward bend."" The exercises become somewhat more demanding as you go along; this is very well organized. Moreover, Sara Ivanhoe gives excellent instructions that are extremely detailed. Great!One thing that seems to turn some people off is the use of the ""icons"" that come popping up on the screen; I think that this is a hallmark of the ""...For Dummies"" series. Personally, I think that sometimes they matter and sometimes they don't. The icons didn't bother me much but I can see and understand why some people would definitely find them annoying. There are four types of icons along the way: the ""tip"" icon; the ""jargon alert"" icon; the ""remember"" icon and the ""myth buster"" icon. If you find them distracting, rest assured that you can always watch the exercise again as many times as you want to get it down pat.In addition, there's another roughly 30 minute segment of intermediary yoga exercises. Sara Ivanhoe runs through these exercises faster because at this point she assumes you've mastered basic yoga; so don't start with these! The exercise Sara teaches is ""the sun salute;"" and she breaks this down into several steps to make the exercise manageable and easier to master. The sun salute uses a combination of breathing and movement together, just like basic yoga.Overall, I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a relatively tame approach to exercise. According to Sara Ivanhoe, yoga can be done by just about anyone regardless of their situation. Naturally, if you have any concerns speak to your doctor first before trying these exercises.",5,very good instructional DVD,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,2876,"['Basic', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'Dummies', 'fine', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'yoga', 'expert', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'who', 'patiently', 'respectfully', 'teaches', 'basic', 'yoga', 'even', 'intermediate', 'yoga', 'help', 'people', 'get', 'fit', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'material', 'non-threatening', 'way', 'entice', 'do', 'workouts', 'exercises', 'move', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'ever', 'being', 'boring', 'course', 'miss', 'point', 'two', 'here', 'there', 'can', 'always', 'just', 're-watch', 'video', 'clip', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'quality', 'sound', 'excellent.Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'workout', 'giving', 'basic', 'advice', 'getting', 'set-up', 'basic', 'yoga', 'workout', 'wear', 'comfortable', 'clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'exercising', 'drink', 'water', 'exercise', 'bare', 'feet', 'possible', 'use', 'chair', 'need', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'Excellent.The', 'bulk', 'DVD', 'video', 'basic', 'yoga', 'workout', 'Sara', 'down', 'twelve', 'smaller', 'exercises', 'postures', 'poses', 'daily', 'dozen', 'video', 'so', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', 'simply', 'just', 'watch', 'how', 'floor', 'mat', 'chair', 'do', 'twelve', 'exercises', 'Watch', 'follow', 'along', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'cat', 'pose', 'mountain', 'pose', 'standing', 'forward', 'pose', 'stretch', 'lunge', 'pose', 'other', 'exercises', 'including', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'exercises', 'become', 'somewhat', 'more', 'demanding', 'go', 'along', 'very', 'well', 'organized', 'Moreover', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'excellent', 'instructions', 'are', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'Great', 'One', 'thing', 'turn', 'people', 'off', 'use', 'icons', 'come', 'popping', 'up', 'screen', 'think', 'hallmark', 'Dummies', 'series', 'Personally', 'think', 'matter', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'icons', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'can', 'see', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'definitely', 'find', 'annoying', 'are', 'four', 'types', 'icons', 'way', 'tip', 'icon', 'jargon', 'alert', 'icon', 'remember', 'icon', 'myth', 'buster', 'icon', 'find', 'distracting', 'rest', 'assured', 'can', 'always', 'watch', 'exercise', 'again', 'many', 'times', 'want', 'get', 'down', 'pat.In', 'addition', 'roughly', '30', 'minute', 'segment', 'intermediary', 'yoga', 'exercises', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'exercises', 'faster', 'because', 'point', ""'ve"", 'mastered', 'basic', 'yoga', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'exercise', 'Sara', 'sun', 'salute', 'down', 'several', 'steps', 'make', 'exercise', 'manageable', 'easier', 'master', 'sun', 'salute', 'combination', 'breathing', 'movement', 'together', 'just', 'basic', 'yoga.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'relatively', 'tame', 'approach', 'exercise', 'According', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'yoga', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'just', 'anyone', 'regardless', 'situation', 'Naturally', 'have', 'concerns', 'speak', 'doctor', 'first', 'trying', 'exercises']",N/A

The main thing is to have fun and keep your sense of humor. Enjoy and you're more likely to stick to it."" ~Sarah IvanhoeYou may be pleasantly surprised to see Sarah Ivanhoe as the yoga Instructor in this video. She is a certified yoga instructor who presents exercise in a caring, cute way. I love her teaching style because it is nurturing and she never makes me feel rushed.If you have read any of the ""Dummies"" books you will recognize the quirky little icons. This video is a bit like a book because pages turn and there are little icons that appear with additional information. The bong, bang, zip of the little icons appearing on the screen do get your attention but might not amuse everyone. I was actually not overly enthusiastic about that situation at first, but my mind seemed to start to ignore the zing, zang, zip of the little icons. Jargon Alerts, Myth Buster Icon, Remember Icon and Alerts appear more at the start of the workout than at the end.The modification sections appear in a split-screen format and can be helpful for beginners. The slower pace and extended time for poses present possibilities for beginners. If you are new to Yoga, this might be a great place to start.Intermediate and Advanced users may enjoy the extended time for deeper stretching. Each pose is held for six breaths, but even more time is given due to the explanations. Each yoga instructor has a unique perspective and you pick up new tricks and tips when exercising with a good variety of instructors. Sarah presents a non-intimidating program and explains yoga in easy-to-understand language.Sarah teaches you twelve poses/exercises:1. Cat Pose2. Mountain Pose3. Standing Forward Bend4. Lunge5. Tree6. Standing Side Stretch Pose7. Downward Facing Dog8. Cobra9. Child's Pose10. Seated Spinal Twist11. Seated Forward Bend12. Final Relaxation PoseYou may want to use a yoga mat, strap, chair, pillow during various poses. Sarah gives you as much time as you need to complete and partially master each pose. It takes years to master some poses and after a few years you will be amazed at your progress. The reason yoga never gets boring is because there is so much to learn about each pose.Since Yoga is not a religion and it is not competitive, it is really perfect for everyone. Not only will yoga give you inner peace, you will find that the exercise help you develop your inner strength all while your body starts to look younger and definitely more toned. You might notice increased blood flow and a relaxed state that lasts for hours and hours.Also Quite Relaxing:Crunch Candlelight Yoga - Candles, sweeping curtains and Sarah is the instructor.Karen Voight YogaSculpt - Modern and healingHemalaya Behl's Yoga For Urban Living Series - Authentic and deeply relaxing.

560518,A27KQ8MMLNFD1B,B00004YZH1,Sara,"[39, 40]","When I decided I wanted to start practicing yoga as a New Year's resolution, I picked up this video to start a program at home.  I needed an easy-to-follow video which gave an effective workout and explained each pose clearly and thoroughly.  I got what I wanted.  Sara Ivanhoe takes you through each pose (there are 12) step-by-step and explains how to align your body and how to breathe.  She makes learning yoga enriching and enjoyable.  Sprinkled throughout the video are little graphics explaining yoga jargon and some of the yoga myths some people tend to believe.One of the things I love about this video is that it presents yoga as a physical activity which benefits the mind as well as the body.  There is no mediation, no visualization, no trying to be one with the universe--just poses.  I think many people are scared away by yoga because they believe they have to stand on their heads while chanting &quot;Om&quot; and trying to harmonize with the universe.  While I respect those who do that, it's not for me and it's not for everybody.  This video presents yoga in a very unintimidating way which will make it seem fun for everyone, no matter what your spiritual beliefs are.This video changed my life.  I've been doing the workout for over four months now and I'm in better shape both mentally and physically.  Some people will be surprised at just how much of a workout yoga is (even beginner's yoga).  I was sore the first time I did it.  And it really tones up your body.  Most of all, it's a lot of fun and I look forward to doing it every day.

560519,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00004YZH1,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","I am a neophyte when it comes to yoga, and in many respects this DVD was an excellent resource.  Instructor Sara Ivanhoe, who is clearly an accomplished yoga instructor, walks the viewer through the most basic ""daily dozen"" yoga moves in about 45 minutes.  Each move is explained carefully and is held for six breaths as Ms. Ivanhoe demonstrates the move.  From this foundation, Ms. Ivanhoe explains slightly more advanced poses and techniques, but we're definitely talking approachable, manageable stuff for beginners.All this is supplemented by the usual ""For Dummies"" learning aids, like mythbusters and jargon translators.  All in all, this is a helpful introduction to the world of yoga.Why only four stars?  Because the workout moves so slowly.  After the second time through the DVD, I didn't need the detailed explanation of each move and simply wanted Ms. Ivanhoe to guide me through the workout without exposition.  Unfortunately, there is no ""efficient workout"" option on the menu, so once you're familiar with the poses, you're going to need to keep the remote handy so you can fastforward through her speeches.This is nothing against Ms. Ivanhoe as an instructor - she's both knowledgeable and, admittedly, very easy on the eyes.  I'm not getting dirty here - it's essential for a beginner to watch how to do these poses correctly, so it helps to have an attractive, proficient instructor when you're watching the same thing over and over again.So while a yoga DVD is preferable to a yoga book in that you get to watch an actual person do the entire pose - as opposed to a mere snapshot contained in a book - the inability to excise the lengthy exposition of each pose is a bit of a problem.  Therefore, the DVD isn't excellent and isn't worth five stars.  But it's clearly worth four, and any beginner should give it a try before spending money on an expensive yoga class.",4,Basic yet slow-moving yoga workout for beginners,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1886,"['am', 'neophyte', 'when', 'yoga', 'many', 'respects', 'DVD', 'was', 'excellent', 'resource', 'Instructor', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'who', 'clearly', 'accomplished', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'viewer', 'most', 'basic', 'daily', 'dozen', 'yoga', 'moves', '45', 'minutes', 'move', 'explained', 'carefully', 'held', 'six', 'breaths', 'Ms.', 'Ivanhoe', 'move', 'foundation', 'Ms.', 'Ivanhoe', 'slightly', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'techniques', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'talking', 'approachable', 'manageable', 'stuff', 'beginners.All', 'supplemented', 'usual', 'Dummies', 'learning', 'aids', 'mythbusters', 'jargon', 'translators', 'helpful', 'introduction', 'world', 'yoga.Why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'workout', 'moves', 'so', 'slowly', 'second', 'time', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'detailed', 'explanation', 'move', 'simply', 'wanted', 'Ms.', 'Ivanhoe', 'guide', 'workout', 'exposition', 'Unfortunately', 'efficient', 'workout', 'option', 'menu', 'so', 'once', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'poses', ""'re"", 'going', 'need', 'keep', 'remote', 'handy', 'can', 'fastforward', 'speeches.This', 'nothing', 'Ms.', 'Ivanhoe', 'instructor', 'knowledgeable', 'admittedly', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', ""'m"", 'not', 'getting', 'dirty', 'here', 'essential', 'beginner', 'watch', 'how', 'do', 'poses', 'correctly', 'have', 'attractive', 'proficient', 'instructor', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'same', 'thing', 'again.So', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'preferable', 'yoga', 'book', 'get', 'watch', 'actual', 'person', 'do', 'entire', 'pose', 'opposed', 'mere', 'snapshot', 'contained', 'book', 'inability', 'excise', 'lengthy', 'exposition', 'pose', 'bit', 'problem', 'Therefore', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'excellent', ""n't"", 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'clearly', 'worth', 'four', 'beginner', 'should', 'give', 'try', 'spending', 'money', 'expensive', 'yoga', 'class']",N/A

If you are just starting out in Yoga, and want to know how to do it or want to know more *about* it, then you may consider buying this tape.Unfortunately, the instructor spends so much time instructing, that the video is nearly worthless for someone who wants to turn it into part of their fitness routine.  Unless, of course, you wish to strap the VCR remote to your arm.  It also seems that in the amount of time it takes to work through the video (about an hour), you haven't gotten much out of it.Unfortunately, they missed a golden opportunity to fix this problem in the DVD version.  What I've read of the reviews implies that the DVD is just a direct copy of the VHS version.  What they really should have done was put two versions on the DVD: one with commentary and instruction, one without.  Alas, this does not appear to be the case.For what it's worth, I do like the instructor.  She seems down-to-earth and knowledgable, and she doesn't have a fake, vapid smile on her face.

560521,A39T7TMQXZ93YL,B00004YZH1,"Sithara Batcha ""Sithara""","[23, 23]","I admit it, I am a couch potato who spends most of her time on the computer, reading books, watching movies, or eating at restaurants with friends.  I've hated exercising since childhood, since my nightmare days at gym class, where I simply could never keep up with what the other kids were doing.In the back of my mind, I always knew I had to get in better shape, so I've tried a few things over the years: sports, running, working out at the gym, and other tapes (Taebo, Pilates, etc) but nothing ever worked.  I would try them the a few times, and but quit soon because I could never do the moves properly, and/or I would just get tired but see no real benefit.Over time, I realized that part of the problem is that I'm quite thin, so the real point of an exercise workout for me is not to loose weight (which many exercises today are geared towards) but gain strength.  My sister suggested I try Yoga, as she says it had helped her tremendously with her strength.I was quite skeptical, and put it her suggestion off for more than a year.  Part of my fear was that yoga poses seemed very complicated, and I'd just never be able to do them.  But after I started getting low back aches a few months ago (and I'm only in my 30s!) I knew I had to do something before my body started deteriorating!  After careful research, I decided to go withBasic Yoga Workout for Dummies.  After all, when it comes to workouts, I am definitely very much a dummy.After working out with it for about a month, I must say, WOW!  I can't be happier.  Sara Ivanhoe presents in this video 12 beginner yoga poses designed to increase strength, flexibility, and improve relaxation, which was just what I wanted.She starts with a detailed introduction on how to sit, and how to breathe, and then starts the routine.  The poses are:Cat PoseMountain Pose  (basically a detailed explanation of standing!)Standing Forward BendLungeTree PoseStanding Side Stretch PoseDownward Facing Dog PoseCobra PoseChild PoseSeated Spinal TwistSeated Forward BendFinal Relaxation PoseThe best part for me is the slow, calm detailed way Ivanhoe explains the poses, in a non-condescending manner.  I really get the message that I'm really working out my own pace.Those who have more experience with Yoga, (or those who are not dummies when it comes to workouts and can pick up moves quickly) may find her detailed explanations boring, and wished the workout moved more quickly.  However, I'm still struggling with the moves, and I am constantly learning new things from her detailed explanations.  For example, in Mountain Pose, I just found out yesterday what it really means to stand with my weight centered on my feet, with thighs tight and drawn-up, belly in and tail bone down  All these years, I've beens standing with my weight centered way back on my heels, belly out- a very unstable way to stand.Even though I know I am not doing each pose perfectly, I know I am still gaining a tremendous amount of benefit in terms of strength and flexibility.  I love that my body is learning every day (shall we say its actually getting smarter?) and is now starting to tell me when I am doing the positions wrong!  As an added bonus, I feel calm, relaxed, and clear after the workout, which often continues into the next day.As the other reviewers mentioned, the 'dummy' icons popping up in the middle of the performance are a tad annoying- the video would be better if they were not there.  But I find I can tune them out, and its a small price to pay for having an workout routine that actually works for me.I knew this tape was a winner when actually I WANTED to work out with it.  This was a new experience for me - actually wanting to exercise? Regularly?!Basic Yoga Workout for Dummieshas made it happen.UPDATE:April 30th 2009:Its over two years later and I'm still using this video - I do the intermediate routine - its about 30 minutes, so very short, but still a nice work out!

Being active all of my life has kept me flexible and so I was surprised to know that I had been practicing &quot;yoga&quot; without knowing it.  A few of the poses were new to me but mostly they are common sense stretches.  OR SO I THOUGHT.  Now I know, thanks to Sara, stretching isn't yoga.  Yoga is an art that unites the body and mind. It combines poses with focus and breathing which result in a feeling of calm AWARENESS.  Sara has the gift--a very pleasant, friendly, poised and positive instructor that is the perfect example of the way yoga will make you feel: calm, relaxed, focused, balanced, positive and strong.Here are the &quot;daily dozen&quot; of which each should be held through six breaths:1 Cat pose*2 Mountain pose*3 Standing Forward Bend4 Lunge5 Tree*6 Standing Side Stretch Pose*7 Downward Facing Dog*8 Cobra*9 Child's pose10 Seated Spinal Twist*11 Seated Forward Bend*12 Final Relaxation pose(* a favorite pose of mine/ feels great)Sara says, &quot;THIS IS YOUR PRIVATE TIME. SO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FOCUS AND REALLY ENJOY YOUR PRACTICE.&quot; That being said, I recommend using this tape until you are happy with your results (yoga is not competitive) and then muting it and do your moves to your favorite dreamy, inspiring music. As you advance, get another book or video, or incorporate your favorite moves from different tapes (I really love Tai Chi) and go through your own poses.BOTTOM LINE: This is a terrific yoga introduction of poses concentrating on the proper alignment, breathing, and focus for the beginner to advanced athlete.

560524,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B00004YZH1,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","This 'Basic Yoga Workout' DVD is a great place to start when learning yoga. The explanations are clear and the instructor isn't 'cheesy' or patronising. The music isn't too off putting and the camera angles show each posture very well. My only criticism is the awful 'dummies' logos and voice over that pop up when you're doing each pose. The information they provide is great, but I found them off putting and took away from the relaxation of the overall practise. This is still one of the better yoga DVDs i've tried and one I'll definitely be using again.

560525,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B00004YZH1,Teedums,"[8, 8]","I am fairly new to yoga, and thought this DVD would be useful for all the basics on yoga and it is. It is based on 12 common yoga poses which is referred to as the ""Daily Dozen"" which are cat pose, mountain pose, standing forward bend, lunge stretch, tree pose, standing side stretch, downward facing dog, cobra, child's pose, seated spinal twist, seated forward bend and final relaxation pose. Sara Ivanhoe leads you through each pose, carefully explaining where you need to be and then you hold each pose for 6 breaths. Sara emphasizes the importance of breathing, which is technically more important that getting the pose perfect.Throughout the routine, there are icons that pop up, tips (helpful hints), myth busters, bewares (red flags), jargon (which helps make yoga terminology easier to understand), plus key things that you need to remember. These are nice but can be a bit annoying when they come up as a funny sound effect accompanies it, which can be distracting when you are trying to concentrate on holding a pose and breathing.This DVD also includes a short intermediate routine which leads you through some of the poses seen in the beginner program, but they are used in a flowing series also called a sun salute. This is usually the next step in a yoga practice once you are familiar with the postures. This segment introduces planks, which are done in the flowing series along with cobras, downward facing dogs, standing forward bends, lunges, etc. You will perform all of these poses at a little faster pace one after another and then they all come together for 3 sun salutes. After this you will do some spinal twists, more stretching and then the final poses.Though I don't own many yoga videos, Sara Ivanhoe is one of my favorite instructors, she is not intimidating and has a light, friendly approach toward yoga, which is helpful for those new to it. She says that if you don't have fun doing it and have a sense of humor along the way then you won't stick to it.

While classes are the best way to learn, I believe that this video might be a good second. The title is a bit of a misnomer, in that this really isn't much of a workout. A yoga workout, or a series, is a sequence of poses strung together in a certain way, being done without pausing between. Imagine musical notes being put together to form a song. What this video does, in a very thorough way, is gently teach you a majority of the poses that other yoga videos will use. Each pose is explained thoroughly, but held for only six in-and-out breaths. Another key to correct yoga is the synchronization between breath and movement, and in this, the instructor's cueing is excellent. My advice to you would be to rent this video to learn the asanas (poses) then when you feel comfortable with each pose, grab some of the Yoga Zone beginner videos to string those poses together and make a song of your own.- William MizePWA Shamus Award nominee, the Denton Ward and Monty Crocetti mystery series",5,Compose A Song Of Your Own,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1068,"['Are', 'looking', 'learn', 'yoga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'classes', 'classes', 'are', 'best', 'way', 'learn', 'believe', 'video', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'second', 'title', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'workout', 'yoga', 'workout', 'series', 'sequence', 'poses', 'strung', 'together', 'certain', 'way', 'being', 'done', 'pausing', 'Imagine', 'musical', 'notes', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'form', 'song', 'What', 'video', 'very', 'thorough', 'way', 'gently', 'teach', 'majority', 'poses', 'other', 'yoga', 'videos', 'will', 'use', 'pose', 'explained', 'thoroughly', 'held', 'only', 'six', 'in-and-out', 'breaths', 'key', 'correct', 'yoga', 'synchronization', 'breath', 'movement', 'instructor', 'cueing', 'excellent', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'rent', 'video', 'learn', 'asanas', 'poses', 'then', 'when', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'pose', 'grab', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'beginner', 'videos', 'string', 'poses', 'together', 'make', 'song', 'own.-', 'William', 'MizePWA', 'Shamus', 'Award', 'nominee', 'Denton', 'Ward', 'Monty', 'Crocetti', 'mystery', 'series']",N/A
