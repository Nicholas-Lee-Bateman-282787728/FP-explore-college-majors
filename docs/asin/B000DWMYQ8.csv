Chicken Little is absolutely terrible and everything went wrong. The whole movie feels diseased and if you go near it you will likely get a glimpse of hell and see what awaits you. Everything, yes everything about this movie sucks. The story sucks, the characters really, really, really suck, the humor sucks horribly, and the visuals aren't even that impressive. I absolutely could not stand this horrible movie and was barely able to stomach the horrors that lie beneath its cutesy looks. It also made me wonder how the people who made this movie were allowed to make movies because they really suck, and should be incarcerated for this travesty which is basically the gateway to hell.

It's fast, funny (if you're under 8) and visually interesting, but I've come to expect only the highest in quality from Disney animation and unfortunately Chicken Little is indeed a tiny achievement when compared to the vast libraby of classics in the Disney vault.  The characters aren't fleshed out and the story is a haphazard mess.Chicken Little's town is chock full of characters with many story possibilities but we never get to really know or care for them. They are all just one-note types (the goofy one, the nerdy one, the bully, etc.) and nothing more.For an 80 minute film, the story is way too padded and careens all over the place. The out of left field turn in the third act turns the film on it's head and takes it in a totally new direction.  Worse, quite a few sequences have no real point to the main story and seemed to be included only to provide action or humor.  There was a great chance to make Oaky Oaks feel like a fun community to live in that is never exploited.  Instead we get quick jokes and cultural refrences in the style of so many other CGI movies of recent years.This DVD includes an 18 minute making of feature, a few deleted scenes (one showing Chicken Little as a girl), a trivia game and music videos.  It's all done in a quick energetic style and if you enjoyed the film enough to check out these features, you'll probably enjoy them.  Just don't expect any major revelations or insight.Bottom line, this is not Pixar level movie making.

963277,AOXC7HI3O8JWI,B000DWMYQ8,"Carlo San Juan ""Caz MD""","[2, 2]","I remember the old fables and fairy tales... never cry ""wolf!"" and never cry ""the sky is falling!""  Unless of course it really is happening...Chicken Little (Zach Braff) brought the town of Oakey Oaks into chaos one day when a piece of the sky fell on his head.  The resulting panic wreaked havoc on the town and later, his father Buck Cluck (Gerry Marshall), deduced that an acorn fell on his son's head, not a ""piece of the sky"".  This made Chicken Little the laughing stock of the town.A year later, his reputation still unchanged, Chicken Little tries to forget the ordeal he went through and to move on with his life.  This chicken really is as little as his name implies but he has ingenuity and resourcefulness as his allies as he goes through the big world around him.  He is seldom without his best friends at his side, fellow outcasts from the schoolyard: Fish Out Of Water (who has a diver's helmet on... only with the water inside it), Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack) who has the moniker ""ugly duckling"" and is obsessed with teen duck fashion magazines, and Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) a gargantuan piglet always on the edge of panic.Things seem to be going well at one point for the fiesty Chicken Little until a piece of the sky falls on him once again...The film's use of CGI has proven one thing... Disney can make a film look as good as anything Pixar can put out.  The detail and charming design of the characters and Oakey Oaks itself is a marvel to behold.  But it isn't the great effects that made us fall in love with Pixar's characters, it's the heart behind it all.  Here Disney does well, as it does with all it's animated films, but just not with as much impact as it's Pixar-produced movies.  But with that nitpick aside, I fell in love with the film.The film put what might the mouse house has on it's magical fingertips without the Lucas-made Pixar powers to help it and it used all it's tried and tested formulas to concoct a gorgeously colorful world and in effect an entertaining film that shouldn't disappoint.Oakey Oaks itself has a lot of entertaining things to look at, almost pretty much a distraction from what the audience should be paying attention to.  When Chicken Little and his father were having an important character-establishing discussion while driving home from his school, the background shenanigans going on outside the car took most of my attention, often with laughs.  But what I missed was important.  Buck Cluck just doesn't believe in his son and wouldn't support him in his dreams.Like any good fable, Chicken Little has a moral story.  Chicken Little went beyond his physical capabilities and his past to acheive a goal that no one believed he could accomplish, including his father.  Buck Cluck should always listen to his son, and more importantly, believe in him and support whatever goal he sets out to win.The characters are well-designed and obviously ready for the Disney barrage of marketing.  Zach Braff's voice for the titular character seemed a little off-place at first but somehow it all fit in as the film rolled on (I would now prefer him over the original candidate, Holly Hunter).  Joan Cusack was almost instantly recognizable.  Patrick Stewart has a surprising (and short) role as the school teacher (""Baa!"") but the best cameo of all is Adam West (yes, the original TV Batman) using all his cheesy line-delivery in a bulked-up finale to the film.In the end, it seemed Disney had an idea, went with it, and mixed up a film with spectacular visuals and just enough heart to rise above mediocrity.  Just like the titular character, Chicken Little rose above and beyond itself just enough to score a home run.",3,"Not great, but good enough",1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,3683,"['remember', 'old', 'fables', 'fairy', 'tales', 'never', 'cry', 'wolf', 'never', 'cry', 'sky', 'falling', 'course', 'really', 'happening', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'brought', 'town', 'Oakey', 'Oaks', 'chaos', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'piece', 'sky', 'fell', 'head', 'resulting', 'panic', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'town', 'later', 'father', 'Buck', 'Cluck', 'Gerry', 'Marshall', 'deduced', 'acorn', 'fell', 'son', 'head', 'not', 'piece', 'sky', 'made', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'laughing', 'stock', 'town.A', 'year', 'later', 'reputation', 'still', 'unchanged', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'forget', 'ordeal', 'went', 'move', 'life', 'chicken', 'really', 'as', 'little', 'name', 'implies', 'ingenuity', 'resourcefulness', 'allies', 'big', 'world', 'seldom', 'best', 'friends', 'side', 'fellow', 'outcasts', 'schoolyard', 'Fish', 'Out', 'Water', 'who', 'diver', 'helmet', 'only', 'water', 'Abby', 'Mallard', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'moniker', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'obsessed', 'teen', 'duck', 'fashion', 'magazines', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'gargantuan', 'piglet', 'always', 'edge', 'panic.Things', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'one', 'point', 'fiesty', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'piece', 'sky', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'use', 'CGI', 'proven', 'one', 'thing', 'Disney', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'Pixar', 'can', 'put', 'out', 'detail', 'charming', 'design', 'characters', 'Oakey', 'Oaks', 'marvel', 'behold', ""n't"", 'great', 'effects', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'Pixar', 'characters', 'heart', 'Here', 'Disney', 'well', 'animated', 'films', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'impact', 'Pixar-produced', 'movies', 'nitpick', 'aside', 'fell', 'love', 'film.The', 'film', 'put', 'what', 'might', 'mouse', 'house', 'magical', 'fingertips', 'Lucas-made', 'Pixar', 'powers', 'help', 'used', 'tried', 'tested', 'formulas', 'concoct', 'gorgeously', 'colorful', 'world', 'effect', 'entertaining', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'disappoint.Oakey', 'Oaks', 'lot', 'entertaining', 'things', 'look', 'almost', 'pretty', 'much', 'distraction', 'what', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'paying', 'attention', 'When', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'father', 'were', 'having', 'important', 'character-establishing', 'discussion', 'driving', 'home', 'school', 'background', 'going', 'car', 'took', 'most', 'attention', 'often', 'laughs', 'what', 'missed', 'was', 'important', 'Buck', 'Cluck', 'just', ""n't"", 'believe', 'son', 'would', ""n't"", 'support', 'dreams.Like', 'good', 'fable', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'moral', 'story', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'went', 'physical', 'capabilities', 'past', 'acheive', 'goal', 'one', 'believed', 'could', 'accomplish', 'including', 'father', 'Buck', 'Cluck', 'should', 'always', 'listen', 'son', 'more', 'importantly', 'believe', 'support', 'goal', 'out', 'win.The', 'characters', 'are', 'well-designed', 'obviously', 'ready', 'Disney', 'barrage', 'marketing', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'voice', 'titular', 'character', 'seemed', 'little', 'off-place', 'first', 'somehow', 'fit', 'film', 'rolled', 'would', 'now', 'prefer', 'original', 'candidate', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'was', 'almost', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'surprising', 'short', 'role', 'school', 'teacher', 'Baa', 'best', 'cameo', 'Adam', 'West', 'yes', 'original', 'TV', 'Batman', 'using', 'cheesy', 'line-delivery', 'bulked-up', 'finale', 'film.In', 'end', 'seemed', 'Disney', 'had', 'idea', 'went', 'mixed', 'up', 'film', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'just', 'enough', 'heart', 'rise', 'mediocrity', 'Just', 'titular', 'character', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'rose', 'just', 'enough', 'score', 'home', 'run']",N/A

In a way that's like Disney when Pixar came into the picture: while Treasure Planet and Chicken Little are likable, we have to look elsewhere for truly special films. But still the film is at least worth a look.One day, Chicken Little causes panic when he says the sky's falling. He says it looked like the sky and octagonal shaped, which people assume is a stop sign and that the acorn that dropped on his head confused him. The event ended up making him look crazy and odd to everyone until it proves that the sky is falling, only he wish he wasn't right.The film's animation is certainly up to snuff. Not as complex and striking as Pixar's but more than willing to provide layers of detail and colorful environments. The voice acting is top notch with an almost unrecognizable Zach Braff, Joan Cusack and Steve Zahn. There's nary a weak element in the cast or in the animation so it's so far so good.Where's it fall apart? Most likely in the script which stretches a thin concept to 80 minutes and is full of pop-culture references and pop tune soundtrack. A traditional movie score would make a great action scene later on work but what's on instead? REM's It's the End of the World. Instead of a sad melody we got Five for Fighting. It's not a bad thing but this film could've worked so much better if the script didn't decide to be contemporary and ""modern"". Kiddies however will love it.If you absolutely got to have this for your kids or you're a fan than buy it but if you want it for say a Disney collection than by all means, wait. This is a rather disappointing lack of extras with a making of that's less than 20 minutes and deleted scenes. No director's commentary? Any bigger insight documentary style? Expect a 2 disc later on. Lilo and Stitch is getting one so most likely this will too.Kiddies will love it but adults, well...might want to try your luck on it first.",3,3.5; Enjoyable but not as special as I want it to be,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2094,"['watching', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'film', 'reminded', 'former', 'football', 'player', 'late', '40', 'still', 'got', 'physique', 'game', 'younger', 'players', 'are', 'much', 'faster', 'have', 'more', 'endurance', 'way', 'Disney', 'when', 'Pixar', 'came', 'picture', 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'are', 'likable', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'truly', 'special', 'films', 'still', 'film', 'least', 'look.One', 'day', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'panic', 'when', 'sky', 'falling', 'looked', 'sky', 'octagonal', 'shaped', 'people', 'assume', 'stop', 'sign', 'acorn', 'dropped', 'head', 'confused', 'event', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'look', 'crazy', 'odd', 'everyone', 'sky', 'falling', 'only', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'right.The', 'film', 'animation', 'certainly', 'up', 'snuff', 'Not', 'complex', 'striking', 'Pixar', 'more', 'willing', 'provide', 'layers', 'detail', 'colorful', 'environments', 'voice', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'nary', 'weak', 'element', 'cast', 'animation', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'good.Where', 'fall', 'apart', 'Most', 'likely', 'script', 'thin', 'concept', '80', 'minutes', 'full', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'pop', 'tune', 'soundtrack', 'traditional', 'movie', 'score', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'action', 'scene', 'later', 'work', 'what', 'instead', 'REM', 'End', 'World', 'Instead', 'sad', 'melody', 'got', 'Five', 'Fighting', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'decide', 'be', 'contemporary', 'modern', 'Kiddies', 'however', 'will', 'love', 'it.If', 'absolutely', 'got', 'have', 'kids', ""'re"", 'fan', 'buy', 'want', 'say', 'Disney', 'collection', 'means', 'wait', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'lack', 'extras', 'making', 'less', '20', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'Any', 'bigger', 'insight', 'documentary', 'style', 'Expect', '2', 'disc', 'later', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'getting', 'one', 'so', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'too.Kiddies', 'will', 'love', 'adults', 'well', 'might', 'want', 'try', 'luck', 'first']",N/A

963290,AS5DZ7COE84B5,B000DWMYQ8,"Dan-Fabian Parra ""the dude""","[0, 1]","It's a pity thought that the creators behind the excellent The Emperor's New Groove were the same who made the muddled and schizofrenic Chicken Little. The former film were originally planned to be a drama, but turned a complete different direction when the dramatic parts didn't worked and the result turned out to be a somewhat bizarre and frenetic film. But still it felt as a breath of fresh air and became a highly entertaining experience. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Chicken Little. Although this film is also a frenetic comedy, it lacks the spunk and the freshness of it's predecessor and it's overall more flawed.Chicken Little isn't a terrible film, but its potential is wasted. The film has its moments, but could been a whole lot better if some structure were put into the screenplay. The film's first twenty minutes or so are it's best one. This movie begins as relatively cute and charming story, with along some amusing pop references.Unfortunately, the good things doesn't overcome the bad things in Chicken Little. The thin screenplay isn't its worst problem. The several action sequences are terribly frenetic and hyperactive, accompained with the boisterous score by John Debney. His score works best on the calmer parts, but completely fails on the more adventurous sequences. The emotional moments in the film feels forced and completely sentimental and despite the film brings out a few laughs, there are some akward moments as well.The pop and movie references is what ultimately makes the film, along with a passable and actually quite inspiring moral. The characters are quite passable, making Abby Mallard (voiced by Joan Cusack) the strongest and most likeable of the cast. The rest of the voice actors delivers a decent efforts, without being particularly memorable (although Zac Braff's as Chicken Little himself is distinctive).

963291,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000DWMYQ8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","We all know the story.  Chicken Little got hit on the head by an acorn, got the whole town into a panic by proclaiming ""The sky is falling,"" and then suffered humiliation for his mistake.  Clearly, the little guy is in need of some redemption - and, thanks to the folks at Disney - he finally has it.  He really did get hit on the head by a piece of the sky - actually, a cloaking panel from an alien spaceship.  Redemption doesn't come quickly, however.  A full year after the original embarrassing incident (which never faded into the background, thanks to billboards, a book, and a forthcoming movie about the whole fiasco), it happens to Chicken Little again.  Even with friends to verify the event, no one believes him yet again, not even his father.  It's a terrible thing for a child to tell the truth and have one of his parents not believe him.  The trauma of that feeling, even more than the continuing public embarrassment, has haunted Chicken Little ever since the original incident.  Buck Cluck loves his son, and he tries to be a good single father to him, but he's really not there for Chicken Little in the bad times.  That gulf between an otherwise loving father and son is really the emotional crux of this story, carrying with it a meaningful message to both children and parents alike.Michael Eisner did at least one good thing during his time at Disney - he saw the original image of Chicken Little as a female and changed the minds of the filmmakers on that score.  From that point on, it was smooth sailing - due largely to some wonderful casting for the voice actors.  I think Zach Braff is great as the voice of the little hero, but Joan Cusack and Steve Zahn are pretty much perfect as the voices of Abby ""Ugly Duckling"" Mallard and Runt of the Litter, respectively.  With all of their comedic antics, these two characters (along with the amazing Fish Out of Water), really make this a movie that kids are sure to love.  Garry Marshall brings Chicken Little's dad to life, while a whole cadre of talented stars, including Patrick Stewart, Amy Sedaris, and Don Knotts, make even the minor characters delightful.  The only little issue I might have with this film is the music, and I only say that because a good bit of it goes back two or three decades.  When Runt starts doing Bee Gees and Gloria Gaynor songs to keep up his courage, few kids are going to recognize the music - maybe the filmmakers just threw this stuff in as a little extra for adult viewers.As usual, Disney proves quite generous with the extra features on the DVD.  You get the obligatory behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film, three alternate openings and a deleted scene, the music video of Shake Your Tail Feathers by The Cheetah Girls (featuring Chicken Little, Ugly Duckling, and Runt getting down with their bad selves), a music video (not to mention karaoke and sing-a-long versions) of One Little Slip by the Barenaked Ladies, a trivia-related game of ""Where's Fish?"" and sneak peeks at gobs of upcoming Disney releases.  The alternate openings are interesting, reflecting the fact that the filmmakers were unsure at first how to introduce the film to the audience, and one of them is quite special indeed, as it features the late Don Knotts narrating the classic tale of the unfortunate little chicken.I'll never be too old to enjoy a good animated film, and the sort of 3D animation that brings Chicken Little's world to life is still quite an amazing thing to see.  At the same time, the animators attempt to retain the essence of the classic Disney style, which ensures that the look of this movie won't be anything less than impressive.  Ye olde squish and stretch never gets old, while the move and zoom point of view technique really goes to show how far animation has come over the decades.  It's that mix of the past and the present that makes this film a real winner in my book.  Chicken Little certainly isn't Disney's most magical film, but it is cute and entertaining enough to delight children as well as a fair share of adults.",5,Funny enough to leave young viewers clucking in the aisles,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,4057,"['know', 'story', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'got', 'hit', 'head', 'acorn', 'got', 'whole', 'town', 'panic', 'proclaiming', 'sky', 'falling', 'then', 'suffered', 'humiliation', 'mistake', 'Clearly', 'little', 'guy', 'need', 'redemption', 'thanks', 'folks', 'Disney', 'finally', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'hit', 'head', 'piece', 'sky', 'actually', 'cloaking', 'panel', 'alien', 'spaceship', 'Redemption', ""n't"", 'come', 'quickly', 'however', 'full', 'year', 'original', 'embarrassing', 'incident', 'never', 'faded', 'background', 'thanks', 'billboards', 'book', 'forthcoming', 'movie', 'whole', 'fiasco', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'again', 'Even', 'friends', 'verify', 'event', 'one', 'yet', 'again', 'not', 'even', 'father', 'terrible', 'thing', 'child', 'tell', 'truth', 'have', 'one', 'parents', 'not', 'believe', 'trauma', 'feeling', 'even', 'more', 'continuing', 'public', 'embarrassment', 'haunted', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'ever', 'original', 'incident', 'Buck', 'Cluck', 'son', 'be', 'good', 'single', 'father', 'really', 'not', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'bad', 'times', 'gulf', 'otherwise', 'loving', 'father', 'son', 'really', 'emotional', 'crux', 'story', 'carrying', 'meaningful', 'message', 'children', 'parents', 'alike.Michael', 'Eisner', 'did', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'time', 'Disney', 'saw', 'original', 'image', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'female', 'changed', 'minds', 'filmmakers', 'score', 'point', 'was', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'due', 'largely', 'wonderful', 'casting', 'voice', 'actors', 'think', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'great', 'voice', 'little', 'hero', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'voices', 'Abby', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Mallard', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'respectively', 'comedic', 'antics', 'two', 'characters', 'amazing', 'Fish', 'Out', 'Water', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'kids', 'are', 'sure', 'love', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'dad', 'life', 'whole', 'cadre', 'talented', 'stars', 'including', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'make', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'delightful', 'only', 'little', 'issue', 'might', 'have', 'film', 'music', 'only', 'say', 'good', 'bit', 'back', 'two', 'three', 'decades', 'When', 'Runt', 'doing', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'Gloria', 'Gaynor', 'songs', 'keep', 'up', 'courage', 'few', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'recognize', 'music', 'maybe', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'threw', 'stuff', 'little', 'extra', 'adult', 'viewers.As', 'usual', 'Disney', 'quite', 'generous', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'get', 'obligatory', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'three', 'alternate', 'openings', 'deleted', 'scene', 'music', 'video', 'Shake', 'Your', 'Tail', 'Feathers', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', 'featuring', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Runt', 'getting', 'down', 'bad', 'selves', 'music', 'video', 'not', 'mention', 'karaoke', 'sing-a-long', 'versions', 'One', 'Little', 'Slip', 'Barenaked', 'Ladies', 'trivia-related', 'game', 'Where', 'Fish', 'sneak', 'peeks', 'gobs', 'upcoming', 'Disney', 'releases', 'alternate', 'openings', 'are', 'interesting', 'reflecting', 'fact', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'unsure', 'first', 'how', 'introduce', 'film', 'audience', 'one', 'quite', 'special', 'indeed', 'late', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'narrating', 'classic', 'tale', 'unfortunate', 'little', 'chicken.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'too', 'old', 'enjoy', 'good', 'animated', 'film', 'sort', '3D', 'animation', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'world', 'life', 'still', 'quite', 'amazing', 'thing', 'see', 'same', 'time', 'animators', 'attempt', 'retain', 'essence', 'classic', 'Disney', 'style', 'look', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'less', 'impressive', 'Ye', 'olde', 'squish', 'stretch', 'never', 'old', 'move', 'zoom', 'point', 'view', 'technique', 'really', 'show', 'how', 'far', 'animation', 'come', 'decades', 'mix', 'past', 'present', 'film', 'real', 'winner', 'book', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'most', 'magical', 'film', 'cute', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'delight', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'fair', 'share', 'adults']",N/A
963292,A1BFTKKBHIR1BY,B000DWMYQ8,David G. Smith,"[2, 3]","Ok, maybe 3.5, maybe 4 at most....My major thing with this is that it is a lot darker than the trailers let on.  There are a few creepy moments,the treatment of Chicken Little is way mean spirited, the movie is oddly structured(not that little kids, I have an 8 year old who liked it, care about structure)with a baseball subplot.  There is a lot of destruction and characters getting evaporated(yes, it is all made good in the end  but wow, it is a little overwhelming.)  I am not in anyway an alarmist.(the sky is not falling)  I just want people to know what they are getting into.Otherwise, the film  is pleasant.  It tries hard to be ""cutting edge"", with clever beginnings and such, but really, Disney is pulling out of its own well.  We have the making fun of merchandising stuff(see aladdin), the lion king references(see lion king 1.5), nods to things like war of the worlds(just when you are thinking ""god, this is like War of The Worlds"" a character steps in and says ""  This is like War of The Worlds"").The voice work is great, Chicken Little himself is so darn cute,  Garry Marshall does a great job as the dad.Other fun things include a look at middle school(funny moment when all the kids pull out their cells.  I teach high school and can relate), and some fun side characters.  You know, the misfits.  I found it typical that the fat pig was played as a music loving misfit with a streisand collection, but there are a few good jokes.And ultimately it becomes a story about fathers and sons, which I am a sucker for.So I am sort of on the fence.  I am sure your kids will like it if they are not afraid of loud noises(in the spaceship....yes, I said spaceship)...but like a few of the more recent disney things(Valiant, Home on The Range) it has a reasonable premisedwarfed by selfconscious(sic) references, odd shock value and meanspiritedness.

""Chicken Little"" the film is more loosely based than an actual re-telling of the well known children story. Disney adds a twist of the sky is falling story and blends it with a little science fiction ala ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Independence Day"".The main character of the story is Chicken Little. He lives with his widowed father (voiced by Gary Marshall). His friends consists of other outcasts Runt (Steve Zahn), Abby (Joan Cusack) and Fish (Dan Molina).Zach Braff is the voice of Chicken Little who gets knocked on the head by a hexagonal object from outer space.Chicken Little's response is that the sky is falling. Of course no one believes him and they think he is a bit off his rocker. A year later, Chicken Little is still trying to shed that image. Once again Chicken Little gets knocked on the head by another hexagonal object from outer space.Children will probably like ""Chicken Little"" more than adults. I found the film a bit too cutesy for my taste. The alien invasion really was a bit much but I guess ya can't go far with the original storyline so Disney had to bring in aliens to make the movie last over an hour. I actually like the father-son subplot of the film. I thought that was more interesting than the alien invasion. The 3D animation was good.

963305,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000DWMYQ8,Eric S. Kim,"[6, 10]","If I told you that ""Chicken Little"" was as awful as ""Barnyard: The Original Party Animals,"" then you probably wouldn't believe me. Well, believe me when I say that it's not nearly as atrocious as ""Barnyard,"" but it's just as annoying. And MAN, was it annoying! I mean, I was annoyed not only by this movie, but annoyed by the fact that this was in fact made by Disney. This is a terrible CGI-animated film that has nothing special to offer. The basic storyline is adapted from the popular children's fable of the same name, but with a twist. Instead of an acorn, it's an actual piece of sky that has fallen....actually, it's a piece of a UFO which turns invisible. It's an interesting premise, but the rest of the movie fails to deliver.One of the biggest problems with ""Chicken Little"" is that it lacks substance and intrigue, even as an animated comedy. In ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters Inc.,"" there was a certain kind of intelligence that dominated the story, and that's what makes them truly special and unique. Here, in ""Chicken Little,"" there is no wit, no charm, and no originality whatsoever. I blame the writers for this, for the director would have created a masterpiece if the script actually had something good in it. The characters are even worse. I could care less for these anthropomorphic people: they are just plain annoying! From the Ugly Duckling to Runt of the Litter, they just bring more and more pain. And Chicken Little himself? I don't care for him, either. Aren't you supposed to make the main protagonist interesting and likable? Well, sadly, it doesn't happen here. And speaking of characters, why are we still choosing celebrities to do voice work? I mean, sure, Zach Braff, Joan Cusack, and Garry Marshall are great actors, but this is NOT their specialty. A majority of the characters are miscast, especially the main character. Why does Chicken Little sound like an adult when he's supposed to be a kid? Did the creators think we're stupid? But the absolute worst thing about this CGI atrocity is the lack of humor. This entire film tries too hard to be a family-friendly comedy: the verbal jokes and sight gags are forced and unfunny. It reminded me of ""Barnyard,"" and how painfully unfunny that movie was as well. Maybe kids will find it hilarious, but adults like me will definitely not.When I saw that Ebert & Roeper gave this film Two Thumbs Down, I admired them for a moment there. That is what I felt like while watching this film. I will give Chicken Little credit, though, for adding a little twist to the famous fable. It could have been handled almost perfectly, but it simply fails as a result. It's a horribly irritating piece of filth, and I was never entertained by it. What a poor excuse for an animated film.Grade: F",1,........Wow........That was painful.........,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,2761,"['told', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'was', 'as', 'awful', 'Barnyard', 'Original', 'Party', 'Animals', 'then', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Well', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'atrocious', 'Barnyard', 'just', 'annoying', 'MAN', 'was', 'annoying', 'mean', 'was', 'annoyed', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'annoyed', 'fact', 'was', 'fact', 'made', 'Disney', 'terrible', 'CGI-animated', 'film', 'nothing', 'special', 'offer', 'basic', 'storyline', 'adapted', 'popular', 'children', 'fable', 'same', 'name', 'twist', 'Instead', 'acorn', 'actual', 'piece', 'sky', 'fallen', '.actually', 'piece', 'UFO', 'invisible', 'interesting', 'premise', 'rest', 'movie', 'deliver.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'substance', 'intrigue', 'even', 'animated', 'comedy', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'was', 'certain', 'kind', 'intelligence', 'dominated', 'story', 'what', 'truly', 'special', 'unique', 'Here', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'wit', 'charm', 'originality', 'whatsoever', 'blame', 'writers', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'masterpiece', 'script', 'actually', 'had', 'something', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'anthropomorphic', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'just', 'bring', 'more', 'more', 'pain', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'either', 'Are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'make', 'main', 'protagonist', 'interesting', 'likable', 'Well', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'speaking', 'characters', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'choosing', 'celebrities', 'do', 'voice', 'work', 'mean', 'sure', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'NOT', 'specialty', 'majority', 'characters', 'are', 'miscast', 'especially', 'main', 'character', 'Why', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'sound', 'adult', 'when', 'supposed', 'be', 'kid', 'creators', 'think', ""'re"", 'stupid', 'absolute', 'worst', 'thing', 'CGI', 'atrocity', 'lack', 'humor', 'entire', 'film', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'family-friendly', 'comedy', 'verbal', 'jokes', 'sight', 'gags', 'are', 'forced', 'unfunny', 'reminded', 'Barnyard', 'how', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'Maybe', 'kids', 'will', 'find', 'hilarious', 'adults', 'will', 'definitely', 'not.When', 'saw', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'gave', 'film', 'Two', 'Thumbs', 'Down', 'admired', 'moment', 'there', 'what', 'felt', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'credit', 'adding', 'little', 'twist', 'famous', 'fable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'simply', 'result', 'horribly', 'irritating', 'piece', 'filth', 'was', 'never', 'entertained', 'What', 'poor', 'excuse', 'animated', 'film.Grade', 'F']",N/A

CHICKEN LITTLE is borderline fun and, certainly, one can't help but appreciate and admire the professional craftsmanship that went into it. It's decidedly a rich, visual feast. But, you know what, it left me cold. CHICKEN LITTLE is ultimately a lightweight animated film in need of a heart and funnier comedy. For my money, it doesn't hold a candle to modern classics such as the great Pixar flicks (TOY STORY 1 & 2, FINDING NEMO, THE INCREDIBLES). True, I was ambivalently amused at times, but the only moment where I really had a good chuckle was when Abby and Runt were karaoke-ing to the Spice Girl's ""Wannabe.""Here's the good and the bad. The pluses of the film are the very slick, good looking animation, the vibrant colors of the film, the movie within the movie at the end where the awesome Adam West lends his voice, and the two sidekick characters: the ever ebullient, happy-go-lucky Fish Out of Water and the insecure giant hog Runt of the Litter. The movie's minuses include the boring and, frankly, crappily executed songs, the over-the-top father and son theme (I felt I was pounded relentlessly over the head with the father/son issue, not to mention Abby the Ugly Duckling's incessant prattling about Chicken Little needing closure with his dad), the lack of ""oomph"" in the writing, and, to be honest, Chicken Little himself. I can't pinpoint it but I ended up not really caring all that much for the lead character. Maybe the abrasive voice work of Zack Braff has something to do with it. Also, when Chicken Little chose to not tell his dad the truth when he encounters the space ship fragment the second time (and the proof was right there in his room), I promptly slammed my hand on my forehead and growled. I mean, c'mon...So this marriage of a kid's fable with an H.G. Wells classic kind of works...I guess. It's just that, in more capable hands, this  definitely would've come out as a superior product. The strained broad humor, the forced After School Special moments, and the outdated references (who says ""Oh, snap!"" anymore, by the way?) did not at all endear this film to me. So, as it is, CHICKEN LITTLE is a guarantee to delight the tots over and over, which is all to the good if what you're looking for is something to divert the young 'un.

And when it was over and we left the theater, there were two responses.The first was from my 2 year old:  He liked it, but then he likes all these kinds of movies.The second was from every adult that came out:  It was OK, but I really expected more from Disney.I mean this is the movie that caused Disney company to completly get rid of their classicly drawn animation department.  This was the movie that gave Disney the confidence at that time to say, ""We don't need Pixar, we can do this all by ourselves.""  So with all that I expected a GREAT Movie, and all we got was an OK movie.It wasn't bad, I mean the story was alright, the animation was very well done, some of the characters were very funny, the voices were ""A"" list actors, (Don Knotts played the mayor), yet it just didn't hit the high expectations that everyone including myself had set for a ""Disney"" movie"".  And while some ,may say well you set your expectations to high.  Well, I don't think so, as I already said, this was to be the movie that would show pixar that we didn't need them, this was going to be the movie that ushered in a whole new way of making Disney animation, and this is what we got.  If that was the standard that Disney set, it failed miserably.  Because the movie was just OK.And for those that say, ""OH, I would give it 5 stars!""  Really, so you would say that this movie is as good as any Pixar movie produced so far?  You would say that this movie is as good as ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", or ""Peter Pan""?  I don't think so.And evidently Disney agreed because you notice after they made this movie, and it only got luke-warm reviews, then they up and buy Pixar, why?  Maybe they knew the movie was just OK too.Here's the deal, if you want to have every movie Disney ever made pick this one up.  If you want  a new movie for your kids because they will watch anything animated, then go ahead and pick it up.But if you want some quality animated Disney, then it's best for you to pick up the oldies, or a pixar flick, because they got it right.",3,Chicken Little was just OK,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,2143,"['love', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'movies', 'So', 'when', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'came', 'out', 'family', 'jumped', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'left', 'theater', 'were', 'two', 'responses.The', 'first', 'was', '2', 'year', 'old', 'liked', 'then', 'kinds', 'movies.The', 'second', 'was', 'adult', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'OK', 'really', 'expected', 'more', 'Disney.I', 'mean', 'movie', 'caused', 'Disney', 'company', 'completly', 'get', 'rid', 'classicly', 'drawn', 'animation', 'department', 'was', 'movie', 'gave', 'Disney', 'confidence', 'time', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Pixar', 'can', 'do', 'ourselves', 'expected', 'GREAT', 'Movie', 'got', 'was', 'OK', 'movie.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'mean', 'story', 'was', 'alright', 'animation', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'voices', 'were', 'A', 'list', 'actors', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'played', 'mayor', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'high', 'expectations', 'everyone', 'including', 'had', 'set', 'Disney', 'movie', 'may', 'say', 'well', 'set', 'expectations', 'high', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'already', 'said', 'was', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'show', 'pixar', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'ushered', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'making', 'Disney', 'animation', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'standard', 'Disney', 'set', 'failed', 'miserably', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'OK.And', 'say', 'OH', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'Really', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'produced', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'Lion', 'King', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.And', 'evidently', 'Disney', 'agreed', 'notice', 'made', 'movie', 'only', 'got', 'luke-warm', 'reviews', 'then', 'up', 'buy', 'Pixar', 'why', 'Maybe', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'OK', 'deal', 'want', 'have', 'movie', 'Disney', 'ever', 'made', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'want', 'new', 'movie', 'kids', 'will', 'watch', 'anything', 'animated', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'pick', 'up.But', 'want', 'quality', 'animated', 'Disney', 'then', 'best', 'pick', 'up', 'oldies', 'pixar', 'flick', 'got', 'right']",N/A

963327,A2BC978GQQEA2A,B000DWMYQ8,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[4, 5]","""Chicken Little"", written by Robert L. Baird, Steve Bencich, Ron J. Friedman, and Dan Gerson; directed by Mark Dindal.  Spoilers abound.Disney's feature animation unit has seen some pretty rough times in recent years.  Most of the Disney films released since the glory days of ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"" (with the possible exception of ""Lilo and Stitch"") have progressively lost more and more of their audience. Many have attributed this to the rise in popularity of computer animation, that perhaps audiences now see hand-drawn animation as old-fashioned (I don't think that's true at all, but that's another article).  ""Chicken Little"", then, is Disney's biggest bid yet to enter the 3D sweepstakes, and once again be a dominant force in animation.  I think that there's a lot riding on this film for the studio, fairly or not.Unfortunately, the strain shows, and the talky, hectic ""Chicken Little"" probably won't put much of a dent in their current track record.  To their credit, the filmmakers went in a different aesthetic direction than most computer fare. The film's look is a charming hybrid of cockeyed fifties design and children's storybook art.  A menagerie of fuzzy animals putter about in their diminutive cars, and many of the characters are boldly stylized and well animated.  But charm can only take you so far, and that's where the trouble begins.The story is an update of the old fairy tale, which, to be honest, I hardly remember.  In this version, Chicken Little (Zach Braff) is a boy, and he's right about the sky falling - if 'right' means that the sky is a piece of a spaceship's cloaking device (a nice use of the computer medium).  The problem is, there's been no evidence to support his warnings.  The plot attempts to worsen his situation in a school dodgeball game, but he comes off more as an unlucky klutz than the chicken who keeps crying wolf.When the ""sky"" falls a second time, Chicken Little, not surprisingly, wants nothing to do with it.  He's just helped his little league team win the pennant, and doesn't want to risk his precariously restored bond with his father, Buck Cluck (nicely voiced by Garry Marshall), who also wants to get past the whole town-laughingstock-thing.  This unfortunately removes their conflict (Son needs to prove himself, Dad wants him to lie low) established at the beginning.It's especially frustrating to see this central conflict wasted - the entire town misses crucial proof by a couple of seconds for the sake of a gag.  Where's dad, pulling Chicken Little by the arm, telling him to stop this nonsense and just come home?  This would've exacerbated their problems, rather than the aliens having to drive the plot.  But they do, and it's up to father and son to reunite and save the world from the oncoming invaders.This is pretty familiar stuff, and the film doesn't stop with echoing ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Billy Elliot"", but also borrows heavily from ""Jimmy Neutron"", ""Shrek"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""E.T."", ""War of the Worlds"" (which is explicitly mentioned), ""Signs"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and Top Forty playlists from thirty years ago.  Most of the the songs are ill-fitting, the nadir of this being the ""I Bruise You"" song, disservicing a good emotional moment.The supporting cast - buddies Runt (of the litter), ""Ugly"" Duckling, and Fish (out of water), are mostly one-joke characters who wear thin pretty quickly. Runt starts out as a panicky overeater and winds up a Streisand fan.  Fish seems especially extraneous, serving only to generate distracting background business.Some of these problems would be easier to handle if the film were funnier than it is - there's a chuckle here and there, but by far the best bit is the ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" coda where the cast watches the film version of what just happened to them.  Adam West makes a guest voice appearance, and sadly, the film feels the most at home with itself than it has for most of its running time.

963328,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000DWMYQ8,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","The kid's fined this enjoyable but not as much. I fear that there aren't many good storytellers left at Disney Feature Animation, and there didn't seem to by any present for the making of ""Chicken Little"". The story itself, chronicling the tales of the title character proving to his community that he is not a failure, was a good enough premise. Though it wasn't executed well at all. Instead of solid, premise-building scenes where it's main characters interact well with others (and get the viewers laughing along the way), we get a sappy, melodramatic mini-soap with voice actors who don't have a good script...followed immediately by, more times than I'd care to recall, potty humor gags.This 3D animated movie also presented itself with ""Madagascar"", ""Robots"" and ""Valiant"", that same year. Many companies are trying to prove their movie-making chops to us movie-goers. They can make a very beautiful looking movie, with wonderfully rendered characters that can move so fluidly and realistic...but the very vital element of sharing a good story is missing in action. It's my belief that a great story without great animation will be a much better movie than one that looks great, but has a weak story. Though, both elements are what made Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" an Oscar-contending, $265 million hit.

The characters play much better than expected (the fish is a truly classic but effective cartoon character) and even though the storyline probably does not go any further than the average""Goof Troop"" tv episode, the dialogues and the action surely deliver good entertainment.For animation fans, which I am, I don't think we should try to compare Chicken Little with a Pixar film for it would not live up to that but still, this one comes highly recommanded.Unlike some of the dreamworks 3D flicks, Chicken Little has a heart and you can feel that the animators and directors really have a good appreciation and understanding of animation.A certain heritage and tradition of American animation lives on throught this movie.Seeing that Disney scored at their first attempt at 3D animation is a relief, now let's wait for their next release to confirm the hopes.",4,Made in 2005 but feels like a good old cartoon,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,1249,"['Disney', 'studios', 'dropped', 'traditional', 'animation', 'historical', 'reasons', 'very', 'sad', 'definitely', 'end', 'era', 'animation', 'cinema', 'general.I', 'must', 'say', 'trailer', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'very', 'appealing', 'took', '4', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'see', 'enjoyed', 'humour', 'upbeat', 'doubt', 'modern', 'never', 'trivial', 'vulgar', 'characters', 'play', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'fish', 'truly', 'classic', 'effective', 'cartoon', 'character', 'even', 'storyline', 'probably', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'average', 'Goof', 'Troop', 'tv', 'episode', 'dialogues', 'action', 'surely', 'deliver', 'good', 'entertainment.For', 'animation', 'fans', 'am', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'try', 'compare', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Pixar', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'still', 'one', 'highly', 'recommanded.Unlike', 'dreamworks', '3D', 'flicks', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'heart', 'can', 'feel', 'animators', 'directors', 'really', 'have', 'good', 'appreciation', 'understanding', 'animation.A', 'certain', 'heritage', 'tradition', 'American', 'animation', 'lives', 'throught', 'movie.Seeing', 'Disney', 'scored', 'first', 'attempt', '3D', 'animation', 'relief', 'now', 'let', 'wait', 'next', 'release', 'confirm', 'hopes']",N/A

Chicken Little cries that the sky is falling, the sky is falling and it turns out that the sky wasn't actually falling.  So what happened after the story ended?  Well, what if I told you that the sky really was falling?  Chicken Little was just not able to prove to the town that the sky did fall, they all thought it was an acorn that fell onto his head.  The movie is about everything that comes after, with a baseball game, silly friends, a falling sky, aliens, and redemption, of course.Like I said, this is a cute movie for the little kids.  The target audience will love this.  The animation is cute and quite pretty, and there is plenty of silly fun.  My wife called me midway through the movie and asked what I thought.  My response was that it was ""cute, but I really don't care at all.""  There isn't much of a storyline to speak of and that won't matter to the little ones.  Unfortunately this isn't a movie that will appeal to all ages, but it is perfectly safe for the kids.  As the kids are the target audience, it was a well done job by Disney.

I can't tell you how many times I burst out laughing during the movie. The story is also good. During the beginning and middle of this film I really had a good time. Finally, the endless stream of mediocre animated movies was ended. But what really got me annoyed and brought this movies rating down to a three was the ending and more specifically, Chicken Little's dad. In the beginning of the movie, although I had a good time, I was really ticked off by how he acted. He really didn't care all that much about his son. But that was not really important so I let it go. Wear the movie really starts to go down the hill is the scene that Chicken Little is in the theater with his dad and tells him that he's never their for him. The scene is all right until the end of it when Little's dad says, ""this is crazy wonderful, just tell me what you need me to do"". From their on it is corny line after corny line all the way to the end and if there is one thing I can't stand, its corny lines. None of the old Disney classics had corny lines, so why do the new ones have them? There is no excuse. Not only that, but the dad at the end takes the supporting his son a little too far. Support is fine, but when he starts asking his son what they should do in life and death situations, that are wear I have a problem. And one more thing. The scene that Chicken Little is on top of the school with ferby, his dad gets stuck and wants him to turn back. But Chicken Little yells back ""you have to let me do this dad"" to which his dad replies ""all right son"". This scene is obviously stolen from Finding Nemo.

963334,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B000DWMYQ8,Jonathan Cohen,"[3, 4]","There is great computer animation...there is great classic Disney...and there is ""Chicken Little"", which is far from a great example of either. This weird update of an ancient fable is graced (?) by some of the clunkiest-looking characters I've ever seen, overwrought dialogue that hits both kids and parents over the head, and incredibly cheesy action effects that resemble purposely-bad sci-fi. Add some loud, annoying voice work and dumbed-down '70s music references, and you've got something that's just a few feathers short of being an empty nest.Chicken Little looks like nothing so much as a geeky, gabby golf ball with grotesque green glasses, and his self-esteem issues are contrived. Plus, he's voiced with a bad Bronx accent by ""Scrubs""' screwball doctor, Zach Braff. His dad, a/k/a Buck Cluck, is a beefy bird voiced with an even worse accent by, of all people, comedy writer/director Garry Marshall. I didn't see a bird father and son here, but a noisy New York sitcom. And the other characters are just as annoying. I mean, what's so funny about a 500-pound pig that keeps quoting '60s pop tunes out of context?The animators say they were trying to update classic Disney cartoons, but it looked more like a bad Muppet show to me, especially during the all-animal baseball game sequence. The later alien invasion climax? Don't ask. OK, it looked and sounded like a cheap video game, and threw in an ironic R.E.M. rocker as happy background music. These people either have a really warped sense of humor and off-the-track sense of timing, or they're trying to add a post-modern flavor to what could, and should, have been a cute kids' movie in better hands.About the only things I saw that rose above the spacy murk of this movie were the two-minute ""Hollywood version"" of ""Chicken Little"" at the very end- and, yes, that was Adam West as the voice of the ""Super Chicken""- and a deleted opening sequence that gave the original fable a charming, old-school Disney flavor. This bit was narrated by the late Don Knotts, who also voices the dimwitted Mayor Turkey. Boy, did he deserve a better swan song.In the last decade, we've all been spoiled by the brilliant work from Pixar and the broader, but still witty at times, DreamWorks movies.

The other night we were out to dinner with friends and we went out to see it with them and we laughed almost from beginning to end.This has to be one of the best animated movies in years.  It even starts, in a way, making fun of some of the great movies that came before.  The story is appealing to any kid, or grown up for that matter, who ever struggles not being popular or understood.  There are lessons about perserverance, friendship, hard work to overcome a handicap, powerful lessons for kids and big kids alike.  The characters are all in high school, so the dynamics of being popular and fitting in and being a success are all there.One of the things that got me was how quickly the time went, I laughed so much throughout the whole thing that the movie was over in minutes, seemingly.Unlike some of the previous releases, there are no inuendos, and the adult humor is clean stuff that only the adults would laugh at not even Bugs Bunny adult humor.  Even the music was tame, no heavy hip hop during and after the movie.  It was something anyone could take their kids to and even buy when the DVD comes out.  I am putting this on my wish list, first time for me to order a cartoon movie.  I just think it is a movie that does not have crass borderline things in it.Some may say that the teasing of the weak or unpopular in the movie is a negative, however, it is all with positive results with friendships being strengthened and the unpopular overcoming things and hanging together.I have my favorite scenes, but I do not want to spoil this for anyone, the last scene will make you laugh and laugh when they make a movie about what Chicken Little and the gang did.

He tries to alert the community to the fact that the sky is falling.  But when he tries to offer proof he can not find the piece of the sky and it is believed he was hit by an acorn.  This shame of this sticks with him for a full year with even a movie being made.  Chicken Little just wants to forget the incident even though he knows he was right.  But then it happens again and he keeps the piece of sky which is able to blend in to its surroundings.  He then enlists the help of his friends Runt, Ugly Duckling, and the Fish Out of Water.  It is Fish who makes a startling discovery and disappears into the sky.The sky is not falling but pieces of a space ship are.  The friends manage to get on the ship and find Fish, but not before setting in motion horrific events.  The aliens are attacking and they are angry.  Soon a huge armada is sweeping over the town and everyone is in a panic.  But Chicken Little manages to figure out what is really going on.  Now all he has to do is convince his befuddled father what has to be done in order to stop the invasion and save the town.  In the end it all works out and Chicken Little is vindicated and light is shed on his claim of the previous year.This was pretty good and relatively cute.  It was a nice take on the classic story and manages to pull of the whole alien invasion thing without being too scary.  But amongst the silliness, action and unusual characters there are real issues being dealt with particularly in the relationship between Chicken Little and his father.  A star studded cast supplies the voices to add the final bit of polish to the work.  This was not the movie I expected from the preview but it worked and it worked well.

An additional 11 effects made it to 25%.The 3D is somewhat inconsistent from scene to scene. A few scenes looked great but most lacked in-screen depth, being shallower than in most animated 3Ds. Many times the background was flat and the cardboard cutout syndrome is obvious regularly. This is one of the earlier conversion attempts (2005) and it shows.The film itself had some LOL moments and IMO the 3D even though flawed does add to the viewing experience.Active Glasses Users: Near the end of the film crosstalk was evident 4 times.

With the resurgence of Disney starting in the late 80's through the dominance of Pixar, a new boon in the animated age was begun.  And many of the products that rolled out were instant classics.  Now some years later, there are a plethora of animated features being released yearly geared toward the kiddie market.  But, as in most things, having more options doesn't equate to having better choices.Thankfully, ""Chicken Little"" isn't one more ""talking-animals-out-of-their-element"" pictures!  It's an odd blend of sci-fi with the Chicken Little story.  So, I give it credit for a bit of originality in its concept--but, sadly, it's only intermittently funny.On a scale ranging from the dreadful, completely misguided ""Valiant"" to the sublime, smart and clever ""Finding Nemo""--you'll find ""Chicken Little"" smack in the middle.  It's sweet and entertaining enough for the little ones, but not nearly smart enough to engage a grown up audience.  A likable cast including Zach Braff, Don Knotts and Joan Cusack with an occasional chuckle elevate the somewhat staid material to 3 stars.

I can't believe that people hate this movie. They've just got no taste at all in Disney movies anymore. Just wait till Narnia comes out. THAT oughta change their minds. I loved everything about this film: the plot, characters, songs, EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You all know the story of Chicken Little and how he thought the sky was falling, right? WRONG! This is the REAL story of what happened after this incident. Sadly, Chicken Little (Zach Braff) is now the laughingstock of the entire town, and has only his friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack, Toy Story 2, Runaway Bride, In & Out), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) & Fish Out of Water (an office water tank, and NO! I'm not lying!) to comfort him. Desperately wanting to make his dad, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall, director of Happy Days, The Princess Diaries, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, Never Been Kissed), he decides to try out for the baseball team. He wouldn't become a star (since Miss Snooty Spoiled Brat Foxy Loxy {Amy Sedaris} keeps taking all the credit) until after hitting & scoring the winning point of the championship game. Finally, things are starting to go right for him... That is, until a piece of the sky falls... AGAIN! Oh, no! What will Chicken Little do? Will anybody believe him this time? Or will he be a reject all over again?This film is both funny and has important messages to struggling families (those with single parents, children or relatives suffering from disabilities, etc.): 1. If you have a serious problem going on within or around you, talk about it, for God's sake! 2. Never stop believing in yourself or your friends/family. 3. When in doubt, just follow your heart.It also has some fun music to sing to, including Braff's version of ""We Are the Champions"", Zahn's version of ""I Will Survive"" and the entire cast's version of ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"".

Nobody would believe his tale about aliens were going to invade Earth.A year later, Chicken Little joins a baseball team to regain respect from his father. When Chicken Little wins one with an inside the park homerun, it gives you an idea of the father and son bond before the relationship torn apart. As life seem to have returned back to normal, the hexagonal space object falls from the sky and makes Chicken Little's life miserable all over again. This time he doesn't go public but instead keeps it close between his oddball friends: Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), and Fish Out of Water. They each have their own humorous personality, which shines when they stick together during the confrontation with alien invaders.Abby recommends that Mr. Little should be told that aliens really do exist, but Chicken Little holds off since there's no proof to validate the truth. Then one day his father believes in his son that aliens are real as they attack Oakey Oaks, not to claim the world Chicken Little had originally speculated but simply to search for their missing three-eye alien child and make a pit stop for gathering acorns.This Movie is cute for everybody to enjoy.

963348,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000DWMYQ8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I had heard that ""Chicken Little"" was a big disappointment and it did not get one of the three Oscar nominations for Best Animated Feature, but I thought it was an enjoyable film.  I just watched ""Madagascar"" this past week and one advantage this Disney offering has is that kids should enjoy it more than adults, which was the whole point of animated films once upon a time (although mom and dad will certainly recognize more of the songs).  This 2005 animated offering begins with the infamous day that Chicken Little (voiced by Zach Braff), told everyone the sky was falling.  His father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) finds an acorn, but his son insists is was a blue object shaped like a stop sign.  Jump ahead a year, and Chicken Little is trying to live down his moment of infamy (the movie and bumper stickers make it difficult), and to earn the respect of his father, who was the best baseball player in the town's history.Chicken Little has a small company of good friends, Abby Mallard (Joan Cusak), who is the Ugly Duckling, Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), who is twice as big at CL's father, and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina), who finds fun things to do with his breathing helmet.  Their primary concern is not with their small friend's story of the sky falling, but rather the strained relationship between Chicken Little and his father.  The kid wants to do something that will impressive his father, or at least not make him ashamed of his undersized kid.  Crossing the street is a hardship for our hero, especially when there is a piece of gum on the road, but when tryouts are announced for baseball he decides to tryout.  He is assigned number ""0"" and usually sits on the bench.  It is Foxy Loxy who proves to be the big star on the team, but then comes the big game.What I admired about this film is that the movie sets up the idea that if Chicken Little can have his one moment of glory that will change everything.  Then it makes it clear that is not the way things work.  Besides, we have not gotten to the point where everybody learns that Chicken Little was not making up things when he said the sky was falling, because the piece of sky shaped like a stop sign comes back, and this time it is not alone.  This requires the sky to literally be falling, and they do manage to come up with a way in which that is clearly true.  The animation is not cutting edge, but the point here is the story and not what the computers can do.  That is why some of the best bits are simply when the animals act like really animals.  The only real problem with ""Chicken Little"" is that there is a point where what appears to be really bad things start happening, but we are supposed to think they are funny instead of frightening.  That is a thin line to try and walk, and that is the point where this film might get a bit confusing for little kids.  Of course, from the second time on that will no longer be a problem.Familiar voices in the cast include Don Knotts as Mayor Turkey Lurkey, Wallace Shawn as Principal Fetchit, Patrick Stewart as the teacher Mr. Woolensworth, and Harry Shearer as the Dog Announcer.  Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Adam West, and Patrick Warburton lend their voices as well, but telling who they are playing would give away too much of the story.  Yes, I know that I am not giving away as much as the trailer for ""Chicken Little"" does, but at least the voices can be a surprise for the older viewers, who are the only ones who are going to smile when they suddenly hear the voice of Adam West.The Backstage Disney bonus features include some deleted scenes, including a trio of alternate openings.  One abandoned opening was a more traditionally animated version of the story of Chicken Little, made poignant because it is narrated by Don Knotts, who passed away last week.  There is also ""Hatching 'Chicken Little',"" A ""Making Of"" featurette, and a ""Where's Fish?"" Trivia Game.  When you get to the Music & More section you will find some karaoke sing along and music videos by The Cheetah Girls (""Shake a Tail Feather"") and Barenaked Ladies (""One Little Slip"").

Unfortunately, Chicken Little compounds his problems by claiming the sky is falling on him without any proof.  Worse, it appears that an acorn may have fallen on Chicken Little's head.  Even Chicken Little's friends Runt of the Litter (voiced by Steve Zahn), Abby Mallard (voiced by Joan Cusack), and Fish Out of Water (with the cleverly bubbled voice of Dan Molina) struggle to deal with Chicken Little.For a long time the town refuses to forget Chicken Little and his crazy idea that the sky is falling.  But through an accident, Chicken Little becomes the town hero and suddenly the whole sky is falling incident is forgotten; until it happens again.Suddenly a cutesy movie about childhood angst turns into ""War of the Worlds,"" with less violence.  How can the Earth be saved from the alien invasion?  I guess those people in town are no longer laughing at Chicken Little's assertion that the sky is falling.  Maybe next time they will listen; probably not.This movie is a cute little film with creative and clever animation.  There are some places in this movie where this movie makes me recall the wonderful Bugs Bunny cartoons of the early 60's.  I liked this movie.  This movie is a relatively minor effort for Disney, but it is fun to watch and I would definitely watch it again.  I know this movie has received a number of negative reviews, but the reviews provide me with insufficient explanation of why the reviewers dislike this movie.This movie is generally family friendly with the exception of the youngest members of the family.  Some images in this film may frighten members of the family ages 3 or 4 and below.Disney is unable to create an instant classic each time it releases a movie.  This movie is quite far from being a classic.  However, it is an enjoyable film that I found entertaining.  I think fans of classic cartoons might find this film enjoyable.

But I am, because Chicken Little is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long, long time.I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this movie. All the characters are great; from the pathetically loveable title character, to his incompetent, communication-challenged father, to the self-absorbed mayor who reacts only when prompted with a cue card, everyone is a standout, and the voice actors do a wonderful job.One of the movie's best parts are the extended ""comedy sequences"" that, according to the director, were modeled after old-fashioned Disney shorts. The laughs come quick and hard, without any dull moments. And the ""talking"" scenes are just as good; the rapid-fire pace of the comedic dialogue is funny the first time, yet demands repeated viewings to catch more subtleties.After you've seen the movie (which has a very clever ending), the DVD version has awesome bonus features. You won't want to miss the deleted scenes, and the ""making-of"" featurette is actually interesting.

""Chicken Little"" made me and my 2-year old laugh all through it with its cute and fun characters. In particular I loved the star of the movie, voiced by Zach Braff, of ""Garden State"" fame.This production is special for Disney because it is a 3-D animated movie, which is unusual for them. They looked back at the studio's long legacy and borrowed some of the best practices they could add volume to, in order to come up with a great animated feature that beats Dreamworks' recent ""Madagascar"" and ""Shark Tale"". It makes you imagine what Disney will start producing in coming years, now that they will be combining their history with the talent of animation powerhouse, Pixar.While the story seems familiar at times, borrowing in a not-too-subtle way from movies like ""War of the Worlds"" (the aliens) and ""Finding Nemo"" (the secondary `ugly duckling' female character, which reminded a lot of Dori), it still feels fresh and keeps you wanting to see it all the way to the end.The DVD package is nicely enhanced with an 18-minute long feature about the movie's making, which always sheds interesting light on aspects you tend to overlook. Other features include games, deleted scenes and previews for other movies. The overall result is a well rounded DVD that you will want to view again and again.

But what happened to him after the story ended?  That's what this movie tells us.Turns out that Chicken Little is in middle school.  His exploits of a year ago are an embarrassment to his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall).  And the fact that there are commemorative plates and an upcoming movie based on the story haven't done much for the father/son relationship.Despite Buck's constant pleas, Chicken Little is determined to prove his worth to his father.  And, just as he's about to put the whole sky is falling nonsense behind him, it happens again.  What should Chicken Little do this time?Okay, let's get the bad out of the way right now.  Yes, the story is a little slow in the first half and a little weird and frantic in the second half.  And that second half might scare kids until they learn what is really happening.  But there really is so much to love.Even though the first half is slow, there are so many wonderful gags in it.  Chicken Little's friends like Fish Out of Water and Runt of the Little are a hoot.  One scene has a background joke I love.  And once the sky falls a second time, things really pick up.  As I said, it goes off in a weird direction, but they manage to make it work.  This isn't something serious, but it is fun, and that's all that truly matters.  Having said that, there is an important moral about parent child communication that gets a tad preachy at times.  I don't mind too much.No, this isn't a grand slam.

I found myself enjoying it more the second time...The Good:Zach Braff did a good job as the lead, but the supporting cast led by Steve Zahn and Joan Cusack stole the show.  But my favorite was Fish out of Water.  With no actual lines, he was the funniest by far.It is a typical Disney movie... funny characters, humorous plot with a message, etc.  So, if you like that kind of thing (or have a four year old who does), get this movie.  It is a good one for the collection.The Bad:It is a typical Disney movie.  Slick, by the numbers, with not a lot of ""soul.""  For some reason, the Pixar half of the creative machine that churns out computer animated movies always gets the ""soul."" the Disney half, of which this is a product, sadly, doesn't.Everyone sure is exuberant in this movie, with lots of action, people screaming and really getting into things, but ultimately, you realize how empty it all seems in the end.I found it incredibly annoying that Disney chose to break the credits up with a message overlaid that says to stay tuned after the movie for extras that will automatically play.  I would prefer to watch the credits as they were supposed to be watched, and pick and choose which extras to view from the main menu.My completely unprofessional ratings:Direction:  3.0Voice Acting:  4.0Animation:  4.5Funny:  3.0Concept:  5.0 (it really is a neat concept)Total:  4.0 stars.  Hey, the animation is pretty cool.RANDOM THOUGHT OF THE DAY:  I think that it is a ""Disney / Pixar thing"" to have the characters in each movie walk through traffic and experience a ""Walk/Don't Walk"" sign or whatever passes for one in their world.

We all know that Chicken Little thought the sky was falling when it was only an acorn that clobbered him.  In this version, the little peep is trying to live that mistake down and make an impression on his athletic hero father.  I think the movie's main problem is that it actually becomes two different movies; after the heroic baseball game in which Chicken Little wins the big one, it's a WAR OF THE WORLDS spoof with aliens and destruction en masse.  This lack of focus makes the movie incoherent, but there are still some funny bits and some neat characters:  Little Alien Kirby and the Goldfish were my faves.  The voice talents of Zach Graff, Joan Cusack, Garry Marshall and Steve Zahn are used effectively and this was the late Don Knotts' last movie as well.

963364,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000DWMYQ8,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 4]","On my recent trip to my in-laws for Christmas, I got the opportunity to see quite a few movies with my nieces and nephews. Chicken Little was on the DVD player, so I had the opportunity to watch it.Chicken Little is Disney's first fully rendered computer graphics animation, throwing in its hat to compete with the Pixar folks (who once worked with Disney, but no longer).  Now that these kinds of movies have become ubiquitous--see any movies about talking fuzzy animals lately?--there's actually a standard to compare these films.  Unfortunately for the competition, Pixar has set the bar very high.We all know the story: the eponymous Chicken Little (Zach Braff, he of Scrubs fame) is outside playing when a piece of the sky hits him on the head. Freaking out in grand fashion, Chicken Little proceeds to tell everyone that the sky is falling.  Only it isn't, and Little kind of looks like a fool, because he overreacted.  It wasn't actually a piece of the sky falling, you see. And thus we have a simple fairy tale similar to the boy crying wolf: Don't overreact to potentially bad news, or people won't believe you when there IS bad news.That's the first five minutes of Chicken Little.Moving forward in time, we see that Chicken Little has it rough.  His mom is nowhere to be found, and his exasperated dad, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall), tries to keep up with his son's eccentricities.  A huge geek, Chicken Little suffers a host of indignities that life throws at him (nearly getting run over, getting pummeled in dodgeball, losing his pants, the list goes on and on) but Little overcomes them with cheerful ingenuity.  Facing the thousand cuts of school along with Little are his friends Abby Mallard AKA the Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusak), the very fat pig known as Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), and the weird Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina). Their arch nemesis is Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris).All Chicken Little really wants to do is make his dad proud. So he joins a baseball team and, like a typical feel-good coming-of-age sports parable, makes the winning play and earns the love of friends, family, and the community.  It's like a film within a film.Then the sky falls again. Finally, Chicken Little switches to the actual plot: a War of the Worlds-style invasion by aliens.  Of course.So what exactly is wrong with an underdog character overcoming an alien invasion, the prejudices of the community, poor past judgment, and did I mention an alien invasion?TOO ADULT.  Whereas the Pixar films speak to both adults and kids, Chicken Little talks down to kids and throws in stupid slapstick that feels pointless, just to keep the little ones entertained.  Then it adds in awkward adult scenes in parts where it doesn't make sense. Do we really need a romance (and a kiss!) between Abby and Little? Or Runt singing, ""If You Wanna Be My Lover""? Worse, many of the in-jokes are very dated.TOO UGLY.  Pixar characters are undeniably cute, be it a fish, a car, an ant, or a toy.  Chicken Little is an ugly little toad; his feathers look like spines, his eyes are beady, and he has a tiny beak for his massive head.  Runt is grossly overweight, Abby is literally an ugly duckling, Fish Out of Water is completely nuts...these are not characters you readily connect with.  Braff's voice acting goes a long way in making Little a likable character, but it takes awhile.TOO SCI-FI.  I actually liked this movie a lot, once I realized it was a riff on War of the Worlds.  How often do CGI cartoon characters run screaming from aliens?  Okay, they did it in Jimmy Neutron too. The problem is that Chicken Little switches abruptly from a cute morality play to terrifying invasion scenario that involves characters getting zapped out of existence.  They all turn out to be okay later, of course, but it sure as heck looks like the aliens killed the cute characters.That said, my niece and nephews watched it twice.  All three of them (my twelve-year-old nephew, seven-year-old niece, and my three-year-old godson) loved it. So perhaps where Chicken Little fails in its pseudo-appeal to adults, it succeeds with the kids.  Or maybe they just like to see a fat pig run from alien tripods.",3,War of the Worlds With Chickens,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,4178,"['recent', 'trip', 'in-laws', 'Christmas', 'got', 'opportunity', 'see', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'was', 'DVD', 'player', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'it.Chicken', 'Little', 'Disney', 'first', 'fully', 'rendered', 'computer', 'graphics', 'animation', 'throwing', 'hat', 'compete', 'Pixar', 'folks', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'Disney', 'no', 'longer', 'Now', 'kinds', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'ubiquitous', 'see', 'movies', 'talking', 'fuzzy', 'animals', 'lately', 'actually', 'standard', 'compare', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'competition', 'Pixar', 'set', 'bar', 'very', 'high.We', 'know', 'story', 'eponymous', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Scrubs', 'fame', 'outside', 'playing', 'when', 'piece', 'sky', 'head', 'Freaking', 'out', 'grand', 'fashion', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'proceeds', 'tell', 'everyone', 'sky', 'falling', 'Only', ""n't"", 'Little', 'kind', 'looks', 'fool', 'overreacted', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'piece', 'sky', 'falling', 'see', 'thus', 'have', 'simple', 'fairy', 'tale', 'similar', 'boy', 'crying', 'wolf', 'Do', ""n't"", 'overreact', 'potentially', 'bad', 'news', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'when', 'bad', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Chicken', 'Little.Moving', 'forward', 'time', 'see', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'rough', 'mom', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'exasperated', 'dad', 'Buck', 'Cluck', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'keep', 'up', 'son', 'eccentricities', 'huge', 'geek', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'host', 'indignities', 'life', 'throws', 'nearly', 'getting', 'run', 'getting', 'pummeled', 'dodgeball', 'losing', 'pants', 'list', 'Little', 'overcomes', 'cheerful', 'ingenuity', 'Facing', 'thousand', 'cuts', 'school', 'Little', 'are', 'friends', 'Abby', 'Mallard', 'AKA', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Joan', 'Cusak', 'very', 'fat', 'pig', 'known', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'weird', 'Fish', 'Out', 'Water', 'Dan', 'Molina', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Foxy', 'Loxy', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'really', 'do', 'make', 'dad', 'proud', 'baseball', 'team', 'typical', 'feel-good', 'coming-of-age', 'sports', 'parable', 'winning', 'play', 'love', 'friends', 'family', 'community', 'film', 'film.Then', 'sky', 'again', 'Finally', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'actual', 'plot', 'War', 'Worlds-style', 'invasion', 'aliens', 'course.So', 'what', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'underdog', 'character', 'overcoming', 'alien', 'invasion', 'prejudices', 'community', 'poor', 'past', 'judgment', 'did', 'mention', 'alien', 'invasion', 'TOO', 'ADULT', 'Pixar', 'films', 'speak', 'adults', 'kids', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'talks', 'down', 'kids', 'throws', 'stupid', 'slapstick', 'pointless', 'just', 'keep', 'little', 'ones', 'entertained', 'Then', 'awkward', 'adult', 'scenes', 'parts', 'where', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'romance', 'kiss', 'Abby', 'Little', 'Runt', 'singing', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'My', 'Lover', 'Worse', 'many', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'very', 'dated.TOO', 'UGLY', 'Pixar', 'characters', 'are', 'undeniably', 'cute', 'be', 'fish', 'car', 'ant', 'toy', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'ugly', 'little', 'toad', 'feathers', 'look', 'spines', 'eyes', 'are', 'beady', 'tiny', 'beak', 'massive', 'head', 'Runt', 'grossly', 'overweight', 'Abby', 'literally', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'Fish', 'Out', 'Water', 'completely', 'nuts', 'are', 'not', 'characters', 'readily', 'connect', 'Braff', 'voice', 'acting', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'Little', 'likable', 'character', 'awhile.TOO', 'SCI-FI', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'once', 'realized', 'was', 'riff', 'War', 'Worlds', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'CGI', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'run', 'screaming', 'aliens', 'Okay', 'did', 'Jimmy', 'Neutron', 'too', 'problem', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'abruptly', 'cute', 'morality', 'play', 'terrifying', 'invasion', 'scenario', 'characters', 'getting', 'zapped', 'existence', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'okay', 'later', 'course', 'sure', 'heck', 'aliens', 'killed', 'cute', 'characters.That', 'said', 'niece', 'nephews', 'watched', 'twice', 'three', 'twelve-year-old', 'nephew', 'seven-year-old', 'niece', 'three-year-old', 'godson', 'loved', 'So', 'perhaps', 'where', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'pseudo-appeal', 'adults', 'kids', 'maybe', 'just', 'see', 'fat', 'pig', 'run', 'alien', 'tripods']",N/A
963365,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B000DWMYQ8,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 2]","Seeing how dependent the Walt Disney Company is on its experimental computer animated project Chicken Little to succeed at the domestic box office in order to retain any lasting hope of gaining some bit of leverage over their former collaborator, Pixar Animation Studios, you look back on the legacy former-Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner left behind and realize how much he truly screwed up. His ill-founded stubbornness plagued many areas of the corporation giant, but no more evident then in the hollowed animation branch of the company, the one on which the company was essentially founded upon and from which much of the corporation's success had been generated up until now. Eisner's rather unwholesome relationship with Jeffrey Katzenberg (currently the president of the animation division of Dreamworks SKG), mismanagement and piss poor selection of the releases of the motion picture unit's live-action division, and the company's precarious dependency on the success of Pixar's projects for revenue all contributed to the state Disney finds itself in now. However, with Michael Eisner, Job's main contention for stalling negotiations between the two entertainment giants, gone, though certainly far from forgotten, a `peace deal' can hopefully be reached. Nonetheless, it may end up costing Disney a bit more then had Eisner not screwed thing up in the first place, particularly if Chicken Little is not quite the hit it wants it so desperately to be.The story for Chicken Little is surprisingly original, truly a credit to Walt Disney Pictures and the film's creators, with a balancing of heart-warming and emotionally inviting family values with analytic humor for each member of the family. It is not nearly as amusing as The Emperor's New Groove, a previous animated feature from the creators of Chicken Little released several years ago, but its own unique brand of off color humor makes it memorable nonetheless. There are quite a number of classic film references, subtly done of course, including allusions to scenes from King Kong, Saturday Night Fever, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Alien, and, best of all, a purely delightful take on the memorable scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Also, present throughout the film are additional references to the antics of the animal world. These astute jests include a bull running a china shop, birds ramming into store windows, dogs ordering up a bowl of water or kibble at a restaurant, fish driving fishbowl cars, etc.Zach Braff, best known for his work on the NBC television comedy Scrubs and Garden State, his independent directorial debut, does an impressive job as the antagonist of the story, Chicken Little. Braff should be praised alone for actually giving Chicken Little a distinctly different voice rather then simply applying his own to the character as so many actors have done in the past. There clearly an emotional depth to the character, based on Braff's voice over performance, that really makes you root for the little guy. Gary Marshall who has been known mainly for his work behind the camera for such films as Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, and the Princess Diaries series provides powerful emotion content to the role of Buck Cluck, Chicken Little's single father who is still reeling from the embarrassment of the ""sky is falling"" incident less then a year earlier. The scene near the end of the film in which he admits to his emotionally exasperated son that he hasn't been the best father to him having dismissed his claim that the sky was falling, which now proved to be true, and for projecting the idea onto him that he had to earn his father's love, respect, and admiration. The scenario may seem a bit corny and it does greatly reduce the action and the pace of the film at this point but the voice talents of Marshall and Braff make it work effectively. Runt of the Litter, voiced by Steve Zahn, and Fish Out of Water, voiced by Dan Molina, editor of Chicken Little who performed the character by vocalizing through a tube into a water cooler tank full of water, act as comedic relief for the film and their scenes are the absolute highlight of the movie. Chicken Little himself and the rest of the cast are decent in their own right but these two will likely be the most memorable characters to emerge from this picture. And, as a bit of an added bonus for Chicken Little, the film boasts an impressive array of comedic voice talent including Patrick Stewart as Professor Woolensworth, Patrick Warburton an alien police officer, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Adam West, and acting veteran Don Knotts as the comically indecisive mayor of Oakley Oaks, Turkey Lurkey, who is given direction via cue cards created by his secret service entourage.Overall, Chicken Little, though arguably not Disney's best work to date and no where quite near the magnificence of what Pixar Animation Studios has released, is cute and a bit gratifying its own unique way and marks a brilliant departure for Walt Disney Feature Animation from the now defunct days of traditional animation and into the fascinating new genre of computer generated animation. It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination to be certain but it is, however, a start and that is what truly matters most for Disney at this point. With Michael Eisner gone and a new CEO is calling the shots from on high, though many still suspect him to be nothing more then an Eisner crony, Walt Disney Feature Animation can hopefully pull itself out of the gutter it has been lying motionless in for years now, Brother Bear and Home on the Range being recent examples of this, dust itself off, and begin anew. The film boasts an eloquent musical score by John Debney, albeit one that is certainly not a memorable as it should have been coming from Walt Disney Feature Animation. It's selection of songs which appear on the film's soundtrack also hit quite a few notes with audiences. The best song on the list has to be Bare Naked Ladies' ""One Little Slip"" which, when see in conjunction with the film on the screen, should be nominated for Best Song at this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Five For Fighting's ""All I Know"" and R.E.M.'s ""It's the End of the World As We Know It"" are other notable highlights. Sadly other songs on the soundtrack, specifically Diana Ross' ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" and the Spice Girls' ""Wannabe"", feel as though the story was built around their inclusion rather then the story being written and having them slipped in. They are not badly place mind you; it just feels as though they are a bit forced. Chicken Little is Walt Disney Feature Animation's first full departure (Dinosaur was not produced by WDFA and was only partially computer generated, the backgrounds were live-action templates) and though it is not quite the holiday blockbuster many were expecting, it is a significant stepping stone from future CGI-animated project like Meet the Robinsons and American Dog, from the creators of Lilo & Stitch, are sure to pick up from.",4,The Moose Hole - Welcome to the Cluck,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,7030,"['Seeing', 'how', 'dependent', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'experimental',

One of the great things Disney did was to actually give you 3-D glasses that look just like Chiken Little's glasses, complete with green plastic frames.  These glasses are much more comfortable than the old paper framed glasses of old.  Tip: Save the glasses to use next month when you drive around looking a Christmas lights.  The glasses will add a fun element to the Christmas light viewing.The story is very simple, but fun.  Suffice it to say, every viewer will go home warm and fuzzy.  Chicken Little is a sympathetic character who gets picked on and laughed at while trying to earn the approval of his father.  His friends are all ""nerds"" with hearts of gold.  There is a lot of fun action that kids will love.  Some of the scenes get a little scary for very young viewers, but nothing too intense. My young children really enjoyed the show.For adults, this is fun to watch, especially in 3-D.  If you don't have kids, but tend to enjoy light hearted cartoons like ""The Little Mermaid"", I'm sure you'll enjoy this film.  This is not a musical, but it does have a fun sound track, complete with a Spice Girls song that fits the funny scene it's in.Go take the whole family to this one and insist on the 3-D version.",5,See the 3-D Version!

What a great character.  But Chicken Little and Abby Mallard (aka Ugly Duckling) are nicely fleshed out, both sympathetic and likable.  One of the best things about the movie is how it deftly avoids most stereotypes.  Our hero is clever and thoughtful, neither a jock or a genius or a nerd.

963374,AHF97M45JFCB,B000DWMYQ8,ONENEO,"[7, 7]","Well this is one of those rare instances where the plethora of mediocre reviews littering the internet were invaluable at lowering my expectations going in.  To be honest, I liked this one far, far more than I expected to based on popular consensus alone.  I think the reason for this is due in part to the simple fact that I've done the old fable turned modern CG film many, many times in the past and can attest to how horribly wrong it can all go (try any of the Unstable Fables, Happily N'ever Afters and so on).What we have here is a cutesy CG piece that by no means pushes the animation envelope (even for 2005 standards) that works off the tried and true formula of decent narrative rather than retina-popping visual appeal.Zach Braff voices the title character; the resourceful little chicken of popular myth who sends the town into a panic when he rings the bell in the school tower while announcing that the sky is falling. Unable to find the piece of the sky that he saw fall, his father Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) is naturally humiliated and tells his son to lay low for a while. Chicken Little abides by his father's wishes, and, in effort to follow in his father's footsteps, even joins the baseball team at school.  Unfortunately just as it seems that things are okay between the father and son's strained relationship, another piece of the sky happens to fall (directly onto Chicken's head no less). The poor diminutive fowl is reluctant to even attempt to explain it a second time considering he hadn't even lived down his first lapse in judgment.Chicken Little in the company of his best friends Abby Mallard (Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusack))) and Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), discover that sections of falling sky are in fact panels from a UFO being piloted by alien beings with a plan of total global domination.Naturally he is unable to get anyone to believe him after his earlier humiliation but impending invasion waits not for the reconciliation of the boy who cried wolf, oh wait wrong fairy tale!Like The Wild, Valiant, and Bolt, Chicken Little represents that period where Disney and Pixar's relationship was quite strained and ""the Diz"" was doing all they could to prove to the public (and to themselves) that they could pull off a computer-generated masterpiece without the help of Pixar.Did they succeed with Chicken Little? Actually the answer to that one is a surprising yes.  Not that this one raises the bar by any means; it can just as easily be viewed as committing no major gaffes either.  What's here is a charming little piece that actually (and rarely) takes a fairy tale base and turns it into a modern-day adventure with a fitting homage to films like War of the Worlds.Additionally impressive here is the humor, which actually relies upon well developed characters and solid scripting over visual gags or (ahem DreamWorks) sexual innuendos.  In fact the film, like most Disney animated pieces, earns the G-rating and manages to pack some pretty intense sequences into the generally restrictive criteria.  The world consists entirely of personified animals and casting Don Knotts as the jittery turkey mayor, Wallace Shawn as the canine school principle and the duo of Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara as the alien couple proves that Disney's knack for selecting appropriate vocal talent was never in jeopardy.Rather than take itself too seriously, Chicken Little keeps things light by integrating an incredibly rich in-film soundtrack that bounces all over the spectrum: everything from a catchy ditty written specifically for the film by the Bare Naked Ladies to the requisite It's the End of the World as We Know It (REM) during the alien invasion sequence.  Other gems include an impromptu karaoke session to the Spice Girls' If you Wanna Be My Lover and the Bee Gees Stayin' Alive as character motivation (heck even the credit roll begins with a pretty funny rendition of Elton John's Don't go Breaking My Heart).Living legend Hans Zimmer is responsible for the film's scoring so soaring highs, creepy lows and perfectly appropriate mood settings are a given.In all the gags work with varying degrees of success: Runt of the Litter being a big Barbra Streisand fan will likely be lost on the vast majority of the intended audience but the Indiana Jones segment, for example, is fantastic stuff.While the general opinion seems to label Chicken Little as a failure (or at the very least a failure in living up to its expectations), I tend to consider this, the first fully computer generated feature film produced in-house by Disney, a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end with just enough charm to appeal to viewers of all ages.",4,Pleasantly Surprised With This Animated Film,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,4693,"['Well', 'one', 'rare', 'instances', 'where', 'plethora', 'mediocre', 'reviews', 'littering', 'internet',

However keep in mind the person who does them is not exacally an angel herself and is protrayed as a ""Bad person."" The jokes are generic, but to some kids, it may just slip out one of these days... Not that that can be avoided.I give it two stars for its nice, and easy to follow storyline, and Fish.Everything else is just a bit... repedative.

Sunde,"[1, 35]","Having just seen Disney's ""Meet the Robinsons"" in the astounding new Disney Digital 3D process, I'm a little taken aback that The Mouse missed the chance to release ""Chicken Little"" in 3D.  I understand this movie had a limited run (80 screens?) as a Disney Digital 3D presentation last year.  So where's the DD3D DVD?I grew up during the 3D craze of the early 1950's, and I'm here to tell you Disney Digital is the real deal.  The old red/green system never came close to producing a watchable image, even in black and white, let alone color.  With Disney Digital I saw a bright, clear, totally colorful 3-dimensional image so good I quickly forgot I was wearing the new polarizing glasses.  In terms of technical visual process, ""Meet the Robinsons"" is the same sort of giant leap forward we had with ""Toy Story"" in the '90s, ""The Abyss"" in the '80s, and ""Star Wars"" in the '70s.  I'm eagerly looking forward to ""Meet the Robinsons"" as a 3D Blu-ray offering later this year.  Disney has once again set a new standard in film making.In the meantime, I can't wait to see what Robert Rodriguez does when he gets his grubby mits on this process.  His recent ""Spy Kids 3D"" and ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" were worthy 3D efforts, but they were based on the old two-color technology and were well nigh unwatchable in 3D.  Wouldn't surprise at all me to see a ""Sin City 3D"" (in the digital process) exploding out of cineplex screens sometime next year.Before that we will have Tim Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" retooled in DD3D for this coming Hallowe'en.

963387,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000DWMYQ8,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","Though the reviews for this movie were a bit on the harsh side, I quite enjoyed this.  It won't be making any lists of my favorite animated films, but it certainly was far better than I was led to expect that it would be.  The film was Disney's first computer generated film, all their other releases being Pixar productions.The film attempts to flesh out the rather bare bones story of Chicken Little, who claimed that the sky was falling.  In this case, the sky truly was falling, in that parts of it were alien space ships that have the ability to disguise themselves like chameleons by assuming the appearance of their background.  This plot device was actually my least favorite part of the movie.  What makes the film work is how it functions on a momemnt to moment basis.  There are a score of excellent comedic moments, well-realized concepts, and great jokes.As with virtually all CGI films, CHICKEN LITTLE is great to look at.  What I love about these movies is that they seem to take you into a different physical universe.  They look almost photo-realistic, but keep enough of a sense of unreality to seem magical.  At least part of the charm is the way they keep the viewer visually stimulated.The voice talent is not quite in the superstar category, but they do a great job anyway.

963388,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B000DWMYQ8,Robert Morris,"[6, 8]","I recently watched this animated feature film with my five-year old grandson, Cameron Morris, and we both enjoyed it thoroughly but for different reasons. That's an important issue for parents, grandparents, and other adult relatives of small children. Literally, this film offers ""something for everyone."" Cameron was intrigued by the strained relations which soon develop between Chicken Little (with Zach Braff's voice) and his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall). He thoroughly enjoyed the mayhem as well as the friendship which CL shares with Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina). The pace accelerates when an alient infant (Kirby whose voice is provided by Evan Dunn) is accidentally left behind after a brief visit by his parents and other aliens who travel in hexagon-shaped space ships of various sizes which have blinking multi-color lights, resembling the devices which restaurants provide to those waiting to be seated. Lots of action ensues. John Debney's musical score complements the narrative without drawing attention to itself. At the conclusion of the film, Cameron said that he really loved it and wanted to see it again...and again...and again...It seems safe to say that he will.As for my own favorable reactions, I appreciated the multiple-levels of humor which include clever word play as well as integration of popular song lyrics with plot developments (e.g. Carole King's ""It's Too Late,"" Elton John and Kiki Dee's ""Don't Go Breaking My heart,"" and Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough""). I was also struck by how subtly the co-writers of the screenplay juxtaposed CL's relationship with his father with the alien infant's relationship with his mother (Catherine O'Hara) and especially with his father (Fred Willard). Cameron picked up on one point, that love should not have to be ""earned."" In so many of Disney's previous animated classics (notably Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Peter Pan and The Lion King), there are thoughtful and sensitive portrayals of parent-child relationsips which involve miscommunication and misunderstanding, alientation, separation, reconciliation, and sometimes death.As is also true of so many other fables, Chicken Little offers interesting characters involved in familiar situations (with which people of all ages can identify) and is thereby entertaining. But the film also suggests there are some valuable life lessons to be learned. Hearing Don Knotts's voice (in his last performance as Mayor Turkey Lurkey) reminded me again of how important it is to appreciate those who nourish our lives with laughter and how privileged we are to share our delight with others, especially with children.Although Chicken Little may not be ranked among Disney animation classics such as those to which I referred earlier, it offers solid entertainment to ""children of all ages"" and is certainly worthy of a Five Star rating.",5,"Wholesome, Witty, and Endearing",1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,2955,"['recently', 'watched', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'five-year', 'old', 'grandson', 'Cameron', 'Morris', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'different', 'reasons', 'important', 'issue', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'other', 'adult', 'relatives', 'small', 'children', 'Literally', 'film', 'something', 'everyone', 'Cameron', 'was', 'intrigued', 'strained', 'relations', 'soon', 'develop', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'voice', 'father', 'Buck', 'Cluck', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'mayhem', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'CL', 'shares', 'Abby', 'Mallard', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Fish', 'Out', 'Water', 'Dan', 'Molina', 'pace', 'when', 'alient', 'infant', 'Kirby', 'voice', 'provided', 'Evan', 'Dunn', 'accidentally', 'left', 'behind', 'brief', 'visit', 'parents', 'other', 'aliens', 'who', 'travel', 'hexagon-shaped', 'space', 'ships', 'various', 'sizes', 'have', 'blinking', 'multi-color', 'lights', 'resembling', 'devices', 'restaurants', 'provide', 'waiting', 'be', 'seated', 'Lots', 'action', 'ensues', 'John', 'Debney', 'musical', 'score', 'complements', 'narrative', 'drawing', 'attention', 'conclusion', 'film', 'Cameron', 'said', 'really', 'loved', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'safe', 'say', 'own', 'favorable', 'reactions', 'appreciated', 'multiple-levels', 'humor', 'include', 'clever', 'word', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'integration', 'popular', 'song', 'lyrics', 'plot', 'developments', 'e.g', 'Carole', 'King', 'Too', 'Late', 'Elton', 'John', 'Kiki', 'Dee', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Breaking', 'My', 'heart', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Tammi', 'Terrell', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Mountain', 'High', 'Enough', 'was', 'also', 'struck', 'how', 'subtly', 'co-writers', 'screenplay', 'juxtaposed', 'CL', 'relationship', 'father', 'alien', 'infant', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'especially', 'father', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Cameron', 'picked', 'up', 'one', 'point', 'love', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'earned', 'so', 'many', 'Disney', 'previous', 'animated', 'classics', 'notably', 'Pinocchio', 'Dumbo', 'Bambi', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Lion', 'King', 'are', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'portrayals', 'parent-child', 'relationsips', 'involve', 'miscommunication', 'misunderstanding', 'alientation', 'separation', 'reconciliation', 'sometimes', 'death.As', 'also', 'true', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'fables', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'interesting', 'characters', 'involved', 'familiar', 'situations', 'people', 'ages', 'can', 'identify', 'thereby', 'entertaining', 'film', 'also', 'are', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'Hearing', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'voice', 'last', 'performance', 'Mayor', 'Turkey', 'Lurkey', 'reminded', 'again', 'how', 'important', 'appreciate', 'who', 'nourish', 'lives', 'laughter', 'how', 'privileged', 'are', 'share', 'delight', 'others', 'especially', 'children.Although', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ranked', 'Disney', 'animation', 'classics', 'such', 'referred', 'earlier', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'children', 'ages', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'Five', 'Star', 'rating']",N/A

Chicken Little, an undersized nerd who doesn`t fit in with most of his more athletically-inclined classmates, becomes the laughing stock of the town when he announces one day that he has been hit on the head by a piece of falling sky.  The full-scale rejection seems to extend even to his own father, whom Chicken Little senses is trying to distance himself from him.  As a result, the little tyke goes on a quest to gain his dad's acceptance by doing something that will make the old man proud of him.  Eventually, this will mean making the world safe from invading aliens bent on taking over the planet.""Chicken Little"" doesn't have all that much to offer the sophisticated adult, but young children should be entranced by its adorable central character, its frenetic action scenes, its colorful animation, and its universal theme of parent/child relationships.

963392,A1XRXOSMIFKM0Y,B000DWMYQ8,R. Zappelli,"[1, 2]","I was wrong....when I first saw previews for Chicken Little in the cinema and on television I was less than impressed with the animation having become used to the clean lines and slick coloring of previous Pixar releases. I thought the titular character looked wrong somehow (the oversized head maybe) and was at that point turned off viewing the movie alltogether.The kids persisted however and I relented and wasn't dissapointed that we took them to see it on the big screen. I did not expect the cross pollination with War of the worlds, Independence day and just a smidgen of Finding Nemo in the storyline and that the little guy would turn out to be so resourcefull and have such a big heart.The animation may not have been as polished as what we have seen in the past but worked well in context and did not distract from the film at all and was in fact better than what I had initally expected.The undelying story of following your instincts and doing what you believe despite the doubts of those who's approval you crave was great and as the father of four I am well aware of how easy it is to want to protect your children and can understand how the father became overprotective after the inital sky is falling incident. Of course the importance of finding the faith in your child and giving them enough freedom to learn and grow and ultimatly succeed under thier own steam cannot be underscored and that is the true meaning at the heart of the story.The movie also has humor in it's favor and though it may not be as clever as say a Shrek it's the sort of humor that the kids appreciate and can understand. The scene when chicken little belts out we are the champions is a highlight for kids and grownups alike.The DVD was quite a few nifty features with alternative beginnings rather than the usual alternate endings, a making off documentary,music video's from the films soundtrack, karaoke sing along and a trivia game.All in all Chicken little is a hit and good value for the whole family.",4,Little Chicken with a big heart,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2002,"['was', 'wrong', '.when', 'first', 'saw', 'previews', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'cinema', 'television', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'animation', 'having', 'become', 'used', 'clean', 'lines', 'slick', 'coloring', 'previous', 'Pixar', 'releases', 'thought', 'titular', 'character', 'looked', 'wrong', 'somehow', 'oversized', 'head', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'turned', 'off', 'viewing', 'movie', 'alltogether.The', 'kids', 'persisted', 'however', 'relented', 'was', ""n't"", 'dissapointed', 'took', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'cross', 'pollination', 'War', 'worlds', 'Independence', 'day', 'just', 'smidgen', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'storyline', 'little', 'guy', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'resourcefull', 'have', 'big', 'heart.The', 'animation', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'polished', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'worked', 'well', 'context', 'did', 'not', 'distract', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'better', 'what', 'had', 'initally', 'expected.The', 'undelying', 'story', 'following', 'instincts', 'doing', 'what', 'believe', 'doubts', 'who', 'approval', 'crave', 'was', 'great', 'father', 'four', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'how', 'easy', 'want', 'protect', 'children', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'father', 'became', 'overprotective', 'inital', 'sky', 'falling', 'incident', 'course', 'importance', 'finding', 'faith', 'child', 'giving', 'enough', 'freedom', 'learn', 'grow', 'ultimatly', 'succeed', 'thier', 'own', 'steam', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'underscored', 'true', 'meaning', 'heart', 'story.The', 'movie', 'also', 'humor', 'favor', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'clever', 'say', 'Shrek', 'sort', 'humor', 'kids', 'appreciate', 'can', 'understand', 'scene', 'when', 'chicken', 'little', 'belts', 'are', 'champions', 'highlight', 'kids', 'grownups', 'alike.The', 'DVD', 'was', 'quite', 'few', 'nifty', 'features', 'alternative', 'beginnings', 'rather', 'usual', 'alternate', 'endings', 'making', 'off', 'documentary', 'music', 'video', 'films', 'soundtrack', 'karaoke', 'sing', 'along', 'trivia', 'game.All', 'Chicken', 'little', 'hit', 'good', 'value', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

Last year Disney added this movie to thier long list of Disney animated movie, and with this one, I mean the movie is cute like the others that came out this decade, but will they ever live up to the classic Disney animated movies? But if you liked the newer Disney animated movies you might like this, even through this was panned by the movie critics, don't listen to them, what do they know? But it does seem to me that they are around to try to save us from spending money on movies they deemed to be bad.The movie beings with Chicken Little (Zach Braff) ringing the bell on top of a school, and all the town's residents comes running, where he warns them that the shy is falling, and of course they don't believe him, and his father Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) doesn't believe hikm either, and advises the town residents that his son was hit on the head by a acorn. And he advises his son to lay low. A year later he is still the laughing stock of the town, and a new movie called Crazy Little Chicken is set to open in the nearest movie theatre. His pals are Fish out of Water (Dan Molina), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) and Abby Mallard aka the Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusack). And there is a neighborhood bully named Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris). He gets in trouble at school, and his father is called in, and in the hallway listening through the bit open door, Chicken Little learns that his dad was the town's star in baseball, which Chicken Little wants to make his father proud of him, which gets him the idea of askiung his father to sign up for baseball. And even becomes the hero of a ballgame, when he coach advises him to not swing the bat, and walk, but on 0-2 pitches, he gets a hit, and being surpised, goes around the bases while the outfielders are having trouble with the ball. The mange to get the ball, and throw to homeplate, when it looks like he is out, the umpire dusks off homeplate, to find Chicken Little's foot on homeplate, and chages the call to safe, and that is the winning run in a 15-14 game. And shortly after that he is hit again for real by a peice of a space ship, that falls in the house, and in his room and hits him on the head. He doesn't tell his father, but gets his friends out of a karaoke party, and he tells him, and next thing they know the fish out of the water is taken prisoner, and well I am not going to revel what will happen next, I think I have given away enough already.In Loving MemoryDon KnottsJuly 21, 1924-Febuary 24 2006",4,The sky is falling,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,2649,"['like', 'deciate', 'movie', 'review', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'who', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'earlier', 'year', 'up', 'provding', 'voice', 'work', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Last', 'year', 'Disney', 'added', 'movie', 'thier', 'long', 'list', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movie', 'one', 'mean', 'movie', 'cute', 'others', 'came', 'out', 'decade', 'will', 'ever', 'live', 'up', 'classic', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movies', 'liked', 'newer', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movies', 'might', 'like', 'even', 'was', 'panned', 'movie', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'seem', 'are', 'try', 'save', 'spending', 'money', 'movies', 'deemed', 'be', 'bad.The', 'movie', 'beings', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'ringing', 'bell', 'top', 'school', 'town', 'residents', 'running', 'where', 'shy', 'falling', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'father', 'Buck', 'Cluck', 'Garry', 'Marshall', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hikm', 'town', 'residents', 'son', 'was', 'hit', 'head', 'acorn', 'son', 'lay', 'low', 'year', 'later', 'still', 'laughing', 'stock', 'town', 'new', 'movie', 'called', 'Crazy', 'Little', 'Chicken', 'set', 'open', 'nearest', 'movie', 'theatre', 'pals', 'are', 'Fish', 'Water', 'Dan', 'Molina', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Abby', 'Mallard', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'neighborhood', 'bully', 'named', 'Foxy', 'Loxy', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'trouble', 'school', 'father', 'called', 'hallway', 'listening', 'bit', 'open', 'door', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'dad', 'was', 'town', 'star', 'baseball', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'make', 'father', 'proud', 'idea', 'askiung', 'father', 'sign', 'up', 'baseball', 'even', 'hero', 'ballgame', 'when', 'coach', 'not', 'swing', 'bat', 'walk', '0-2', 'pitches', 'hit', 'being', 'surpised', 'bases', 'outfielders', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'ball', 'mange', 'get', 'ball', 'throw', 'homeplate', 'when', 'out', 'umpire', 'dusks', 'homeplate', 'find', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'foot', 'homeplate', 'call', 'safe', 'winning', 'run', '15-14', 'game', 'shortly', 'hit', 'again', 'real', 'peice', 'space', 'ship', 'house', 'room', 'head', ""n't"", 'tell', 'father', 'friends', 'karaoke', 'party', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'fish', 'water', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'well', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'revel', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'think', 'have', 'given', 'away', 'enough', 'already.In', 'Loving', 'MemoryDon', 'KnottsJuly', '21', '1924-Febuary', '24', '2006']",N/A

The plot needed to either hold together or entertain - both preferably, but it suceeded in neither.While the animation was very good, they overdid facial expressions and gestures, as if proud of themselves for their abilities. Rightly so, but subtlety is what makes it look real, believable.The main problem I saw was lack of originality. They had obviously been watching Nemo and Shrek in the key moments of script and plot writing. But the father/son motif fell short of moving and wandered into the painful-to-watch relm.

After the animal residents run amuck, they eventually realize everything is calm and Chicken Little becomes the town laughing stock. A year later, the movie has just been released and it seems Chicken Little will never live it down. Little is also upset because his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) never believed him and still doesn't, causing issues within the family. His friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), aka the Ugly Duckling, Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), and Fish Out Of Water have all stuck by him and rally around when another chunk of sky falls on his head and the aliens invade.""Chicken Little"", the newest digital animation effort from Disney, is a step in the right direction for the struggling animation company. Okay, maybe a baby step, but it is a step nonetheless. It isn't Pixar quality, but better than a lot of competing studio's efforts (""Robots"") and even Disney's last few non-Pixar efforts.The animation is decidedly stylized. Everything seems designed to resemble storybook illustrations; body parts are exaggerated or stylized, settings are quaint, vehicles are rounded and bubble like. Chicken Little and his dad live in a large home that looks like a chicken coop. This step away from attempting to make animation more realistic is interesting and a good idea, allowing the filmmakers more creative license, giving them free reign to create a world where Turkey Lurkey (Don Knotts) is the mayor and a bull runs the china shop.Despite stepping away from realism, the use of computer animation has advanced so much that the filmmakers are able to cover Little with realistic, albeit small, feathers. All of the animals are covered with hair or feathers that would make any creature realistic, if the proportions were a little more realistic.At the same time, this stylized animation seems ripe with merchandizing possibilities. Stuffed animals, theme park characters and more are sure to be born if the movie is successful. I realize that Disney is always trying to exploit all of their movie characters for these other revenue streams, but this is the first time I have felt like the characters were designed for these avenues first. Because it seems like everything was designed for commercial value, it detracts from the magic of watching these cute characters romping around on the screen.The first and last twenty minutes of the film are very fast paced. The introduction of all of the characters, as Little runs a virtual obstacle course to get to school and deal with the scorn of his classmates, including Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris) and the finale depicting Little, his dad, and his loyal friends, saving the town, are fast paced and fun to watch. Because these two segments move so fast, it seems a bit like being on a roller coaster at Disneyland. You know there are faster roller coasters out there, but this roller coaster will give you a couple of minutes of excitement. In the middle of the day, you move on to other rides that the little kids love before maybe squeezing in another thrill ride before the end of your day.The middle of the film, when the story kicks in, is very slow. It's not enough that Chicken Little has to deal with the scorn of his classmates and the other animals living in Oakey Oaks, he has to deal with the shame of his father. Once a great baseball hero in the town, his father is ashamed that his son has created so much excitement, for no reason. This leads Little to join the baseball team, even though he can't even lift the bat. All season, he sits on the bench, waiting for his turn at bat. Then... Wait, a minute, what part does this whole thing play in the remainder of the film? It doesn't. It simply serves as filler, to make the film over an hour long, for viable theatrical distribution. The middle slows everything way, way down.The voice acting is good, but not brilliant. Zach Braff manages to convince us that his character is a small, little guy, who can become heroic when necessary. Joan Cusack and Steve Zahn are amusing as his sidekicks. Patrick Stewart, Wallace Shawn, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Patrick Warburton and Adam West all voice smaller, supporting characters, adding to the fun.Because of the stylized animation and the bright colors, the film is very ""cute"". Maybe too cutesy-pie for adults. Disney films used to have a lot of jokes and visual puns that only the adults would get, to keep them interested while they were doing their good parental duty and taking the kids to a film they could enjoy. Recent Disney efforts have lacked this element, making it a necessary chore for parents to sit through the barrage of brightly animated images as their kids squeal and laugh. ""Chicken"" has little to keep the adults interested.You can always tell when an animated film will transcend the genre and become a remembered, beloved classic. Adults without kids go to the film and laugh more than the children in the audience. ""Chicken Little"" won't be a classic, but your younger kids will enjoy it. Can you pay someone to take them to see it?Or wait for the DVD which I'm sure your kids will play hundreds of times.",3,"This ""Chicken"" has ""Little"" for the captive adults.",1131321600,"11 7,

963409,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000DWMYQ8,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[3, 4]","Spoofing 50's animation and sci-fi invasion epics from ""War Of The Worlds"" to ""Signs"" to ""Independence Day,"" ""Chicken Little"" is Disney trying to prove they could match the artistry of Pixar without actually working with them. Frankly, not even close. Barely making it past an hour's running time, this DVD rates none of the action or suspense of ""The Incredibles"" and fails miserably at trying to sneak in adult humor ala Dreamworks' ""Shrek"" films.Not for lack of trying. There are a couple of funny scenes here, like when Runt's mother threatens to ground him from his Streisand albums (""Leave Barbara out of this,"" the oversized pig squeals...). But for the most part, the forced pop culture references - like the R.E.M. song - seem overwrought. The ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" ending was a clever touch, though. The voice cast commits themselves well (Zach Braff, Gerry Marshall and Amy Sedaris in particular). Too bad the critters aren't really attractive visually.The CGI seems more than a little harsh looking. There is little of the smoothness of ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"" to be had here. The Chicken Little character reminds me a little of the geeky chick that used to one-up Foghorn Leghorn in the old WB cartoons, and Fish Out of Water struck me as a G-rated version of South Park's Kenny (albeit he was still funny). Which means: Not much by way of original development here. Seems Disney maybe needed Pixar more then the opposite.Also, the level of violence may be a bit much for the under six set. Prominent characters are getting zapped by the aliens during the invasion section, and although they do return, you may have to do a little explaining (ala Bambi's Mom). The use of name calling seems a bit over-the-top as well, even if the principal offender gets her come-uppance by the finale.

Story-wise and even graphics-wise, Disney is no match for Pixar.But at the same time, the movie wasn't a complete dead weight that I thought it would be.  Indeed, the main story had a rather decent, fun structure to it.  I did enjoy the movie, I must admit.But if you are a type to find faults in movies, well, you'll be busy.  A lot of the supporting characters simply do not work.  Many jokes (both spoken lines and visual gags) fall flat, especially those that seemingly target adult audience members.  It tries too hard to push a family drama theme.  And it has too many pop-rock songs in the background that are there for the sole reason of selling the soundtrack CD.The level of graphics left me totally unimpressed too.  Not terrible, but nothing to write home about.  For instance, Chicken Little's feather/fur effects simply don't measure up to Pixar's 4-year-old Monsters Inc.  Plus, Chicken Little's rendering of fabrics and their interactions leave a lot to be wished for.I will say, however, that Disney has done a splendid job with facial expressions, as well as with the glossy quality of Chicken Little's eyes.  Very well done.All in all, even with all the faults, the basic story works, and Chicken Little is undeniably one cute character.

963411,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000DWMYQ8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 6]","`Chicken Little' is Disney's first full-CGI animation without Pixar's name. This means the film is the first in-house 100 % CGI product from the company, and this fact alone makes our expectation unusually high. And it is inevitable that you compare it with such films as `Monsters Inc' and `Finding Nemo' that Pixar gave us in the past.This is my impression. Technically and visually `Chicken Little' is impressive if not groundbreaking. That much I can promise. But Pixar is going to set the stake higher in 2006 with their new animated film, so Disney might be fated to fall behind in this arena for the next few years, or possibly decade. Is Disney going to really abandon the traditional hand-drawn animated pictures in the future? I don't think it is a wise decision.[YOU DON'T FIND A STORY] In `Chicken Little' which starts with an episode based on the extended version of the famous fable, titular Chicken Little creates a great havoc by warning the townspeople that, you know, the sky is falling. And ... the story is relegated to the sidelines, becoming the usual pattern of a loser (and the loser's friends, who are also losers) winning in the end after misadventures. There is a story about father-son relation. There is an alien invasion. There are lots of pop-culture references, (which include very recent hits like `King Kong' and `War of the Worlds'). But if you want the social satire of `The Incredibles' or the touching moment of `Toy Story 2,' you will be disappointed. Compared with `Chicken Little,' stories of `Robots' or `Madagascar' start to look better, or at least coherent.But the strength of `Chicken Little' lies in sight gags. The film is better when it doesn't speak, and the wacky humor based on exaggerated slapstick gags would make you smile. The voice actors are all good, including Zach Braff, Garry Marshall, Joan Cusack, Steve Zahn, Amy Sedaris, Don Knotts, Harry Shearer, Patrick Stewart, and Wallace Shawn. Thanks to them, the characters provide funny moments. But most of those funny scenes would be funny from the beginning without the main story about Little Chicken and his predicament.Mark Dindal, who directed much superior `The Emperor's New Groove' five years ago, throws many sight gags in the style of old-fashioned animations - like Tex Avery's in which characters don't jump, but fly - but I think CGI techniques are not suitable to this kind of gags. `Chicken Little' is not bad - it is enjoyable as long as you ignore the weak story. I enjoyed watching it, but do not think that I will own its DVD.",3,Not a Masterpiece But Largely Agreeable with Some Good Sight Gags and CGIs,1135382400,"12 24, 2005",2005,2554,"['Chicken', 'Little', 'Disney', 'first', 'full-CGI', 'animation', 'Pixar', 'name', 'film', 'first', 'in-house', '100', '%', 'CGI', 'product', 'company', 'fact', 'alone', 'expectation', 'unusually', 'high', 'inevitable', 'compare', 'such', 'films', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Pixar', 'gave', 'past.This', 'impression', 'Technically', 'visually', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'impressive', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'much', 'can', 'promise', 'Pixar', 'going', 'set', 'stake', 'higher', '2006', 'new', 'animated', 'film', 'Disney', 'might', 'be', 'fated', 'fall', 'behind', 'arena', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'possibly', 'decade', 'Disney', 'going', 'really', 'abandon', 'traditional', 'hand-drawn', 'animated', 'pictures', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'wise', 'decision', '[', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'FIND', 'A', 'STORY', ']', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'episode', 'based', 'extended', 'version', 'famous', 'fable', 'titular', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'great', 'havoc', 'warning', 'townspeople', 'know', 'sky', 'falling', 'story', 'relegated', 'sidelines', 'becoming', 'usual', 'pattern', 'loser', 'loser', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'losers', 'winning', 'end', 'misadventures', 'story', 'father-son', 'relation', 'alien', 'invasion', 'are', 'lots', 'pop-culture', 'references', 'include', 'very', 'recent', 'hits', 'King', 'Kong', 'War', 'Worlds', 'want', 'social', 'satire', 'Incredibles', 'touching', 'moment', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Compared', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'stories', 'Robots', 'Madagascar', 'start', 'look', 'better', 'least', 'coherent.But', 'strength', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'lies', 'sight', 'gags', 'film', 'better', 'when', ""n't"", 'speak', 'wacky', 'humor', 'based', 'exaggerated', 'slapstick', 'gags', 'would', 'make', 'smile', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'including', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Thanks', 'characters', 'provide', 'funny', 'moments', 'most', 'funny', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'beginning', 'main', 'story', 'Little', 'Chicken', 'predicament.Mark', 'Dindal', 'who', 'directed', 'much', 'superior', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'many', 'sight', 'gags', 'style', 'old-fashioned', 'animations', 'Tex', 'Avery', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'fly', 'think', 'CGI', 'techniques', 'are', 'not', 'suitable', 'kind', 'gags', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'not', 'bad', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'long', 'ignore', 'weak', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'own', 'DVD']",N/A
963412,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000DWMYQ8,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Walt Disney has never been very interested in staying authentic to the fairy tales, fables, and legends that it uses as fodder for many of the animated movies that they make. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN, CINDERELLA, PINOCCHIO, and company are all quite different than the original stories they are based upon (in fact, the only time animated Disney movies have attempted to be authentic was in the telling of MULAN--why is that?). Therefore, it shouldn't be surprising that in CHICKEN LITTLE about the only things that remain from the classic tale which was to be a warning of believing everything you hear are the names of the characters and the idea of the sky falling.In this version of the story, Chicken Little is a teenage chicken that has yet to have a growth spurt. In fact, he hasn't grown much at all since he was born. So, Chicken Little has a few issues about his height. Also, his mother died when he was younger and he's being raised by his dad. Chicken's dad was a huge baseball star when he was in school and he had dreams that his son would follow in his footsteps. Unless Chicken starts to grow, that's probably never going to happen.Besides the whole height thing, Chicken Little also another issue he has to deal with. One fine sunny day, Chicken was up in the top of the bell tower at school and swore he was hit on the head by a piece of sky, but some acorns were. Chicken became infamous instantly. A year later he and his father are hoping to have put the past behind them, but with the upcoming movie about to be released of Chicken Little's misadventures, it doesn't seem likely. As Chicken tries to work through issues with his dad, he's once again knocked in the head with a piece of sky and this time he keeps it to show his friends. That piece of sky leads Chicken and his friends to discover an alien spaceship with assumed plans to destroy their world. It's then left up to chicken and his friends to try to save their town and the world.CHICKEN LITTLE has some really interesting characters. There's Foxy Loxy, Mayor Turkey Lurkey, Abby Mallard (Ugly Duckling), Goosey Loosey, Runt of the Litter, and Fish Out of Water. These characters have some really interesting personalities, but the best thing about them are the actors who perform their voices. Zach Braff voices Chicken Little, Joan Cusack voices Abby Mallard, Steve Zahn voices Runt of the Litter, and even Patrick Warburton gets in on the gig as an Alien Cop. The film is also noteworthy because it was Don Knotts last performance (as Mayor Turkey Lurkey).There are a lot of pop culture references. Some have been overdone, but this is a kid's movie after all so that shouldn't be too big of a problem. As for animation, CHICKEN LITTLE is a CGI cartoon but it feels like a classic cartoon. The town and all the characters in the film look like something out of a Richard Scary (illustrator) book.All in all, CHICKEN LITTLE is an enjoyable movie. The technique and story aren't the greatest, but the film is fun and at less than 90 minutes there really is no reason to complain. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy. Just don't hit yourself on the head.The DVD version of the film includes a few extras. There are some unfinished deleted scenes, including the original promo in which Chicken Little was still a girl. There are a couple of music videos, one by The Cheetah Girls and one by The Barenaked Ladies. There's a silly game called &#34;Where's Fish?&#34; that involves some &#34;trivia&#34; from the movie. Other than the deleted scenes, the crown jewel of the extras is the &#34;Hatching CHICKEN LITTLE&#34; featurette that shows viewers exactly how the movie came about from the original idea to the finished project on screen.",4,Enjoyable,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,3725,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'interested', 'staying', 'authentic', 'fairy', 'tales', 'fables', 'fodder', 'many', 'animated', 'movies', 'make', 'BEAUTY', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'ALADDIN', 'CINDERELLA', 'PINOCCHIO', 'company', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'original', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'fact', 'only', 'time', 'animated', 'Disney', 'movies', 'have', 'attempted', 'be', 'authentic', 'was', 'telling', 'MULAN', 'why', 'Therefore', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'CHICKEN', 'LITTLE', 'only', 'things', 'remain', 'classic', 'tale', 'was', 'be', 'warning', 'believing', 'everything', 'hear', 'are', 'names', 'characters', 'idea', 'sky', 'falling.In', 'version', 'story', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'teenage', 'chicken', 'yet', 'have', 'growth', 'spurt', 'fact', ""n't"", 'grown', 'much', 'was', 'born', 'So', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'few', 'issues', 'height', 'Also', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'being', 'raised', 'dad', 'Chicken', 'dad', 'was', 'huge', 'baseball', 'star', 'when', 'was', 'school', 'had', 'dreams', 'son', 'would', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Unless', 'Chicken', 'grow', 'probably', 'never', 'going', 'happen.Besides', 'whole', 'height', 'thing', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'also', 'issue', 'deal', 'One', 'fine', 'sunny', 'day', 'Chicken', 'was', 'up', 'top', 'bell', 'tower', 'school', 'swore', 'was', 'hit', 'head', 'piece', 'sky', 'acorns', 'were', 'Chicken', 'became', 'infamous', 'instantly', 'year', 'later', 'father', 'are', 'hoping', 'have', 'put', 'past', 'upcoming', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'misadventures', ""n't"", 'seem', 'likely', 'Chicken', 'work', 'issues', 'dad', 'once', 'again', 'knocked', 'head', 'piece', 'sky', 'time', 'show', 'friends', 'piece', 'sky', 'leads', 'Chicken', 'friends', 'discover', 'alien', 'spaceship', 'assumed', 'plans', 'destroy', 'world', 'then', 'left', 'up', 'chicken', 'friends', 'try', 'save', 'town', 'world.CHICKEN', 'LITTLE', 'really', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Foxy', 'Loxy', 'Mayor', 'Turkey', 'Lurkey', 'Abby', 'Mallard', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'Goosey', 'Loosey', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'Fish', 'Out', 'Water', 'characters', 'have', 'really', 'interesting', 'personalities', 'best', 'thing', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'perform', 'voices', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Abby', 'Mallard', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'Runt', 'Litter', 'even', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'gig', 'Alien', 'Cop', 'film', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'was', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'last', 'performance', 'Mayor', 'Turkey', 'Lurkey', 'are', 'lot', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'have', 'been', 'overdone', 'kid', 'movie', 'so', 'that', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'big', 'problem', 'animation', 'CHICKEN', 'LITTLE', 'CGI', 'cartoon', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'town', 'characters', 'film', 'look', 'something', 'Richard', 'Scary', 'illustrator', 'book.All', 'CHICKEN', 'LITTLE', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'technique', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'film', 'fun', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'there', 'really', 'reason', 'complain', 'So', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'few', 'extras', 'are', 'unfinished', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'original', 'promo', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'was', 'still', 'girl', 'are', 'couple', 'music', 'videos', 'one', 'Cheetah', 'Girls', 'one', 'Barenaked', 'Ladies', 'silly', 'game', 'called', '34', 'Where', 'Fish', '34', '34', 'trivia', '34', 'movie', 'Other', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'crown', 'jewel', 'extras', '34', 'Hatching', 'CHICKEN', 'LITTLE', '34', 'featurette', 'viewers', 'exactly', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'original', 'idea', 'finished', 'project', 'screen']",N/A
