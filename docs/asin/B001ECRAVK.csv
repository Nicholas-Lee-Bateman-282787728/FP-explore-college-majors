But after watching all 4 volumes, I'd say that only 1 or 2 of the movies didn't settle too well, and none of them were so bad that I couldn't finish them.  Over all, the quality is high: acting, music and stories were all good!  And for $50, one can't go wrong!",5,Great!,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,304,"['first', 'only', 'few', 'titles', 'intrigued', 'watching', '4', 'volumes', ""'d"", 'say', 'only', '1', '2', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'settle', 'too', 'well', 'none', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'quality', 'high', 'acting', 'music', 'stories', 'were', 'good', '50', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",Masters of Horror: The Complete First Season
1185670,A1IP04QSYWO4TW,B001ECRAVK,"JVAN ""Tech Shopper""","[0, 0]","Some of the best horror movies I've seen, and great stories as well. Video quality has the look of about 720p, but still very watchable with little grain, and good color. Writing and directing varies, but is typically on par with a large production movie. Actors are very good and professional. IF you're looking for a series of straight gore (there is some, but not usually gratuitous,and frequently non-existent) or torture movies (AKA Saw) look elsewhere. It's the stories, directed well and acted believably that makes you squirm for the people in the movies or give you OMG! moments. Weigh this, and the fact that you're getting about 12.5 hours of quality horror.I WISH they'd come out with Season 2 on BD!",5,Great set!,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,712,"['best', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'great', 'stories', 'well', 'Video', 'quality', 'look', 'about', '720p', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'little', 'grain', 'good', 'color', 'Writing', 'directing', 'varies', 'typically', 'par', 'large', 'production', 'movie', 'Actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'professional', 'IF', ""'re"", 'looking', 'series', 'straight', 'gore', 'not', 'usually', 'gratuitous', 'frequently', 'non-existent', 'torture', 'movies', 'AKA', 'Saw', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'stories', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'believably', 'squirm', 'people', 'movies', 'give', 'OMG', 'moments', 'Weigh', 'fact', ""'re"", 'getting', '12.5', 'hours', 'quality', 'horror.I', 'WISH', ""'d"", 'come', 'out', 'Season', '2', 'BD']",Masters of Horror: The Complete First Season

It should have been one box set of the whole season but they chose this method and this is what we were stuck with. The stories range from scary to bizaare and even slightly humorous. They look great on blu ray and hopefully someone will put out season two on blu ray. In fact there's enough space on blu rays to add some of the third season that was called 'fear itself""which was a regular tv show and not a showtime effort.",4,good horror anthology series.,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,541,"['ran', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'got', 'ax', 'Then', 'only', 'got', 'season', 'one', 'divided', 'up', 'four', 'seperate', 'blu', 'rays', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'whole', 'season', 'chose', 'method', 'what', 'were', 'stuck', 'stories', 'range', 'scary', 'bizaare', 'even', 'slightly', 'humorous', 'look', 'great', 'blu', 'ray', 'hopefully', 'someone', 'will', 'put', 'out', 'season', 'two', 'blu', 'ray', 'fact', 'enough', 'space', 'blu', 'rays', 'add', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'called', 'was', 'regular', 'tv', 'show', 'not', 'showtime', 'effort']",Masters of Horror: The Complete First Season
