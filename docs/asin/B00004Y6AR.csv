I purchased this DVD due to the reviews here and elsewhere, but I have to say I was disappointed.The film is long..and boring. It is not a rock and roll film, per se. I was expecting that mid-way through the film, the character of Jim will have started a rock band and have played a major role in helping to bring about the British Invasion. Not so.  This is just a story about a directionless young man who quits school, gets seasonal jobs to support himself, engages in cheap sex, watches (and does nothing) as his friend Mike (Ringo) gets beaten up by customers, comes home after two years, marries and has a kid, then leaves them and everyone else to embark on his rock and roll dream. END OF PICTURE.The music is great and the film DOES have potential. But I think it would have been better served to have half of the movie reflect Jim's disillusionment and aimlessness, and the other half reflect what happened as a result of this. As it stands, watching this film is like going to the theatre, and having to leave just as the movie starts.  You never get to see what becomes of Jim as he embraces his new-found ""freedom"".  For that, I guess you have to see the sequel they mention.I love David Essex in this movie. He's very cute and a good actor. Disappointing, however, was his character. He's not a very sympathetic ""bloke""; rather, he's self-absorbed, deceitful and a cheat..and certainly not anyone you can depend upon in your time of need.Ringo does a great turn and it's interesting to see him in this context. I am a big Beatle fan, and I enjoyed seeing him in something different and stretching his obvious acting abilities.That said, I think this movie could have been much better. To add insult to injury, they listed ""Rock On"" as being in the movie, but nowhere do you hear it played in the film. Perhaps it was in the sequel, but then the makers of this film should not have deceived the public into thinking it is heard in the film, because it isn't.Maybe a second viewing of this film will put things in better perspective for me, but for now, this is my opinion and I'm sticking to it.",2,Disappointing,1062720000,"09 5, 2003",2003,2234,"['really', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'film', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'very', 'passionate', 'music', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'musician', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'due', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed.The', 'film', 'long..and', 'boring', 'not', 'rock', 'roll', 'film', 'se', 'was', 'expecting', 'mid-way', 'film', 'character', 'Jim', 'will', 'have', 'started', 'rock', 'band', 'have', 'played', 'major', 'role', 'helping', 'bring', 'about', 'British', 'Invasion', 'Not', 'so', 'just', 'story', 'directionless', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'school', 'seasonal', 'jobs', 'support', 'cheap', 'sex', 'watches', 'nothing', 'friend', 'Mike', 'Ringo', 'beaten', 'up', 'customers', 'home', 'two', 'years', 'marries', 'kid', 'then', 'everyone', 'else', 'embark', 'rock', 'roll', 'dream', 'END', 'PICTURE.The', 'music', 'great', 'film', 'DOES', 'have', 'potential', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'have', 'half', 'movie', 'reflect', 'Jim', 'disillusionment', 'aimlessness', 'other', 'half', 'reflect', 'what', 'happened', 'result', 'watching', 'film', 'going', 'theatre', 'having', 'leave', 'just', 'movie', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'Jim', 'new-found', 'freedom', 'guess', 'have', 'see', 'sequel', 'mention.I', 'love', 'David', 'Essex', 'movie', 'very', 'cute', 'good', 'actor', 'Disappointing', 'however', 'was', 'character', 'not', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'bloke', 'rather', 'self-absorbed', 'deceitful', 'cheat..and', 'certainly', 'not', 'anyone', 'can', 'depend', 'time', 'need.Ringo', 'great', 'turn', 'interesting', 'see', 'context', 'am', 'big', 'Beatle', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'something', 'different', 'stretching', 'obvious', 'acting', 'abilities.That', 'said', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'listed', 'Rock', 'being', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'do', 'hear', 'played', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'sequel', 'then', 'makers', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'deceived', 'public', 'thinking', 'heard', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'put', 'things', 'better', 'perspective', 'now', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'sticking']",N/A
558205,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00004Y6AR,David Baldwin,"[2, 3]","This film evokes the fifties rock 'n' roll period quite well, thank you.  The film tells the story of a disaffected youth (David Essex) who runs away from the monotony of his ""normal life"" and it's inherent responsibilities.  He finds himself working odd jobs at a seaside carnival where he befriends another kindred soul(Ringo Starr).  Later, he gets his girlfriend pregnant and finds the responsibility of husband and father so overbearing when he hears the clarion call of rock 'n' roll.  David Essex is quite excellent in the lead role, and the film is at pains not to portray his decisions as noble ones.  What I don't get is that Essex's character is supposed to be a John Lennon type but I just don't see it.  Ringo gives probably his best screen appearance, ever!  It's the first time I've seen a film he's appeared in where you think he's in character and not an extension of his Beatles persona.  It's also good to see Keith Moon in a nice little cameo.

Everyone wants to be a pop star, don't they? (If not, you might not enjoy this so much). I was a bit baffled by the shift forward in time by its sequel Stardust, which seems to take place in the 1970s whereas this is set in the 1950s. Writer Ray Connolly has written a lot about the Beatles, so the film's story has some similarities to their life, but it is clearly not meant to be about any one actual person any more than Spinal Tap is meant to be about Status Quo.

558208,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B00004Y6AR,Robert Huggins,"[15, 17]","""That'll be the Day"" is a small, well written and acted film made in 1973 that shares similar themes with the better known ""Quadrophenia"" made 5 years later.  Side note:  In ""That'll be the Day,"" the Who's Keith Moon has a cameo as a drummer, and the Pete Townshend composition ""Long Live Rock,"" is heard at a dance hall.  Both films tell the story of young men in their late teens/early twenties in England who become disillusioned with their lives and most everything around them.  In ""Quadrophenia,"" Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels) quits his job and runs Ace Face's (Sting) scooter off the seaside cliffs, symbolically severing his ties with the ""Mod"" lifestyle.  The future for Jimmy is uncertain at the end of ""Quadrophenia.""  The ending of ""That'll be the Day,"" however, is much less ambiguous as Jim MacLaine (David Essex) leaves his job and family (including his infant child) for the life of a rock star (further continued in the 1974 sequel ""Stardust"").Like ""Quadrophenia,"" ""That'll be the Day"" is not a musical, though it has plenty of music in it, including the likes of Richie Valens, the Everly Brothers, Dion, etc.  The live bands at the dance halls, for the most part, play cover versions of American artists.  The real rock stars in the film -- Essex, Ringo Starr, and Billy Fury and Keith Moon in small cameos -- all do an excellent acting job.  Essex, in particular, is terrific as Jim and Ringo, as Jim's carny friend Mike, proves that he really can act in a serious role, given the right material (his work here will make you quickly forget about ""Caveman"").  Rosemary Leach, as Jim's mother, and Rosalind Ayres, as the wife he leaves, are also impressive.  Even the small roles are well cast in this film.  There's a great scene where young Jim breaks into a seaside arcade on his birthday and proceeds to get drunk.  Along comes an English bobby on a bicycle.  Rather than arresting him for breaking & entering and disorderly conduct, the compassionate policeman helps Jim home.  It's a small, but wonderfully played scene by Ron Hackett as the policeman.  Such are the performances throughout this film.Anchor Bay, as usual, does a great job with the visual presentation of this film, but save for a trailer (shown, for some inexplicable reason, in three different sizes!), there are no extras.  This is the type of film where a commentary from David Essex, or the film's director (Claude Whatham) or screenwriter (Ray Connolly) really would have added a lot for fans, in much the way that Director Franc Roddam's commentary added to the viewing experience of ""Quadrophenia.""  If and when ""Stardust"" is ever released on DVD, let's hope that ""the powers that be"" will include a commentary track (hint:  Director Michael Apted would be great).Note:  Despite it's PG rating, this is not a children's film.  In addition to some unsavory characters and mild profanity, there is implied sex as well as a surprisingly graphic sex scene for a PG rated film (the MPAA ratings standards were much laxer in the early 1970s then they are now).

Said to be based on the early life of John Lennon, this honest and gritty drama is widely considered to be the best depiction of the 1950's British rock scene. Jim McLain (David Essex) leaves home and takes a series of low level jobs at a seaside amusement park.  His new friend, played by Ringo Starr, introduces him to a world of tawdry sex and petty crime.  Jim's world comes to a shocking and brutal end and he returns home to face his adult future as the local music scene explodes.

558210,A2U9X230VFNAA6,B00004Y6AR,William Maudlin,"[0, 3]","I gave this movie one star because it did show the late Billy Fury in action as well as having a very nice, though very short, drum solo from Keith Moon.This movie is not just about the Fifties as one reviewer suggested nor only about the Sixties as another indicated.  The period covered is the late Fifties to the early Sixties though it is often anachronistic if we are to follow strictly the film's implied chronology.The central figure in the movie is regarded in too friendly a fashion by some reviewers here.  ""A working class lad"" who is ""bedding ladies"" flatters both the grammar school dropout and his usually willing 'victims' who are seen as mostly concerned that no one discovers their furtive sexual adventure (""You won't tell anyone will you?"") rather than weak and naive dupes who really only want to marry a cute boy and have babies as another reviewer seems to imply. There are  three truly sympathetic figures in the film:  the boy's mother, his young wife and his best friend who he repays in false coin by deflowering his fiancee.This movie seems to belong to the growing genre that over-glamorizes rock and roll and its sometimes degraded protagonists and seeks to want to reconstruct the early rock era to some extent in the shoddy image of much of the film industry.  I am a fan of rock music myself and I actually  grew up in this time period.  Some of the movie rings very true but much is overdrawn, blurred and misrepresented.  Those who see the central figure in the film as ""typical"" of his time are right in some instances (such as his love of rock music and recurring daydreams about being rich and famous) but are also wrong in fundamentals.  As some have said, and as the movie indicates, neither Essex or Starr play the parts of ""typical"" teens but typical ROGUE teens who steal and fornicate freely and with little or no evidence of conscience.  Everyone knew people something like this but they were not usually regarded sympathetically.  Starr is ultimatley portrayed as at least marginally more sexually moral and responsible than Essex. It is he who is beaten up for his blatant thievery while Essex suffers no consequences for his actions.  You would think that the actions of the character Essex plays would have led to at least his being the recipient of an occasional good drubbing himself, a paternity suit or two, as well as an occasional anxious trip  to the V.D. clinic (although he does seem to, at times, prey on the sexually inexperienced - even to the point of apparently raping a thirteen year old girl ignoring her repeated protests and pleas).  While my generation were all more or less flawed this kind of behavior would be roundly condemned by most all of us, yet the film-smiths treat it all glibly and in fact rather like one big romp, and make Essex come out of it all apparently unhurt and the script dumps his victims as readily and as blithely as does the film's central character.The final and total product is totally uninspiring, unreal,  and as pointless and amoral as it main protagonist.  The comparison with ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is rather apposite in one important sense, as would be comparisons generally with the whole genre of films it represents.  The villain and any implied ""rebellion against society's mores"", if that is what is really intended or implied, is shallow, empty and irresponsible.",1,Inaccurate and uninspiring,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,3373,"['gave', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'did', 'show', 'late', 'Billy', 'Fury', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'very', 'nice', 'though', 'very', 'short', 'drum', 'solo', 'Keith', 'Moon.This', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'Fifties', 'one', 'reviewer', 'suggested', 'only', 'Sixties', 'indicated', 'period', 'covered', 'late', 'Fifties', 'early', 'Sixties', 'often', 'anachronistic', 'are', 'follow', 'strictly', 'film', 'implied', 'chronology.The', 'central', 'figure', 'movie', 'regarded', 'too', 'friendly', 'fashion', 'reviewers', 'here', 'working', 'class', 'lad', 'who', 'bedding', 'ladies', 'flatters', 'both', 'grammar', 'school', 'dropout', 'usually', 'willing', ""'victims"", 'who', 'are', 'seen', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'one', 'furtive', 'sexual', 'adventure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'will', 'rather', 'weak', 'naive', 'dupes', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'want', 'marry', 'cute', 'boy', 'have', 'babies', 'reviewer', 'imply', 'are', 'three', 'truly', 'sympathetic', 'figures', 'film', 'boy', 'mother', 'young', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'false', 'coin', 'deflowering', 'fiancee.This', 'movie', 'belong', 'growing', 'genre', 'over-glamorizes', 'rock', 'roll', 'sometimes', 'degraded', 'protagonists', 'seeks', 'want', 'reconstruct', 'early', 'rock', 'era', 'extent', 'shoddy', 'image', 'much', 'film', 'industry', 'am', 'fan', 'rock', 'music', 'actually', 'grew', 'up', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'very', 'true', 'much', 'overdrawn', 'blurred', 'misrepresented', 'who', 'see', 'central', 'figure', 'film', 'typical', 'time', 'are', 'right', 'instances', 'such', 'love', 'rock', 'music', 'recurring', 'daydreams', 'being', 'rich', 'famous', 'are', 'also', 'wrong', 'fundamentals', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'Essex', 'Starr', 'play', 'parts', 'typical', 'teens', 'typical', 'ROGUE', 'teens', 'who', 'steal', 'fornicate', 'freely', 'little', 'evidence', 'conscience', 'Everyone', 'knew', 'people', 'something', 'were', 'not', 'usually', 'regarded', 'sympathetically', 'Starr', 'ultimatley', 'portrayed', 'least', 'marginally', 'more', 'sexually', 'moral', 'responsible', 'Essex', 'who', 'beaten', 'up', 'blatant', 'thievery', 'Essex', 'consequences', 'actions', 'would', 'think', 'actions', 'character', 'Essex', 'plays', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'least', 'being', 'recipient', 'occasional', 'good', 'drubbing', 'paternity', 'suit', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'occasional', 'anxious', 'trip', 'V.D', 'clinic', 'seem', 'times', 'prey', 'sexually', 'inexperienced', 'even', 'point', 'apparently', 'raping', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'ignoring', 'repeated', 'protests', 'pleas', 'generation', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'flawed', 'kind', 'behavior', 'would', 'be', 'roundly', 'condemned', 'most', 'yet', 'film-smiths', 'treat', 'glibly', 'fact', 'rather', 'one', 'big', 'romp', 'make', 'Essex', 'come', 'apparently', 'unhurt', 'script', 'victims', 'readily', 'as', 'blithely', 'film', 'central', 'character.The', 'final', 'total', 'product', 'totally', 'uninspiring', 'unreal', 'pointless', 'amoral', 'main', 'protagonist', 'comparison', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'rather', 'apposite', 'one', 'important', 'sense', 'would', 'be', 'comparisons', 'generally', 'whole', 'genre', 'films', 'villain', 'implied', 'rebellion', 'society', 'mores', 'what', 'really', 'intended', 'implied', 'shallow', 'empty', 'irresponsible']",N/A
