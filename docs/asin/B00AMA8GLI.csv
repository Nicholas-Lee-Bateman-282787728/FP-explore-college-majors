The hair on their heads may be a little whiter but they still have the ""moves"" and lots of energy! My daughter loved dancing to the Puppy song and copying the hand motions in the Hands on Your Head song. The Banana song was the one that she requested we replay again and again. I really liked the lesson and the song about allergies.  We know several families with food allergies and we are always looking for ways to reinforce that we need to ask the parents of our little friends before we offer to share snacks.  The Wiggles will always have a special place in my heart. They have entertained my three children on many a road trip.  I love the smile it brings to my daughter's face when I dance along with her to her favorite Wiggle songs.",5,Surfer Jeff,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,821,"['three', 'year', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Wiggles', 'latest', 'production', 'hair', 'heads', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'whiter', 'still', 'have', 'moves', 'lots', 'energy', 'daughter', 'loved', 'dancing', 'Puppy', 'song', 'copying', 'hand', 'motions', 'Hands', 'Your', 'Head', 'song', 'Banana', 'song', 'was', 'one', 'requested', 'replay', 'again', 'again', 'really', 'liked', 'lesson', 'song', 'allergies', 'know', 'several', 'families', 'food', 'allergies', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'ways', 'reinforce', 'need', 'ask', 'parents', 'little', 'friends', 'offer', 'share', 'snacks', 'Wiggles', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'have', 'entertained', 'three', 'children', 'many', 'road', 'trip', 'love', 'smile', 'daughter', 'face', 'when', 'dance', 'along', 'favorite', 'Wiggle', 'songs']",The Wiggles: Surfer Jeff

1613285,A3V2XYH0H9TQ4B,B00AMA8GLI,JLLERAS,"[9, 10]","The Wiggles are a group of Wacky Australians who love to sing and dance along with their three mascots: Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the dog and Pirate Captain Feather Sword.The Show starts out with the guys waking up on the beach in their colorful sleeping bags and starting off their fun ocean side adventure.  My kids followed along through tons of songs and even though this was their first viewing of the movie they were able to follow along and particularly enjoyed the songs that included dances.  My youngest at two loves to follow along with the wiggles and touch her head, shoulders then clap.While the movie included over 20 individual songs there was one definite stand out for us.  It turns out that during lunch time in the movie we find out that one of our wiggles pals has a food allergy!  The Wiggles are kind enough to even ask everyone before making lunch if there are any allergies.  When we find out about the peanut allergy they go in as much detail as to explain about epi-pens and allergic reactions and symptoms.  My daughter is allergic to eggs and also has to have an epi-pen available just in case.  I would have never thought a show would take that much consideration into making a whole song about food allergies.  I have to say that that sold me right there for the rest of the DVD.  Thank you Wiggles for making my daughter feel normal about her food allergy and for teaching other kids about it at the same time!Aside from the singing and dancing we get to meet new characters like our magic wish granting genie friend and we get to visit new countries and explore different cultures.  Somehow the Wiggles manage to fit all this in one hour!  The  movie flew by and my kids were glued to the TV the whole time.I would recommend this movie for anyone ages 2 and Up, my four year old loved it just as much as my youngest and I won't lie and act as though I wasn't up shaking my tush either.The DVD has some special features such as extra clips and a fun photo gallery.  We explored them but the children were most interested in the movie itself.As a side note the DVD includes an insert with upcoming features, Now on DVD and some games, my son commandeered it immediately and is now bugging me for all of the movies that were advertised.I would certainly recommend this movie to my friends and family.Thank you again to NCircle Entertainment and to The Wiggles for your family friendly and educational shows, you never let us down!",5,Family Friendly and has great songs and dances!,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2461,"['Wiggles', 'are', 'group', 'Wacky', 'Australians', 'who', 'love', 'sing', 'dance', 'along', 'three', 'mascots', 'Dorothy', 'Dinosaur', 'Wags', 'dog', 'Pirate', 'Captain', 'Feather', 'Sword.The', 'Show', 'out', 'guys', 'waking', 'up', 'beach', 'colorful', 'sleeping', 'bags', 'starting', 'off', 'fun', 'ocean', 'side', 'adventure', 'kids', 'followed', 'tons', 'songs', 'even', 'was', 'first', 'viewing', 'movie', 'were', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'songs', 'included', 'dances', 'youngest', 'two', 'loves', 'follow', 'along', 'wiggles', 'touch', 'head', 'shoulders', 'then', 'clap.While', 'movie', 'included', '20', 'individual', 'songs', 'was', 'one', 'definite', 'stand', 'out', 'out', 'lunch', 'time', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'wiggles', 'pals', 'food', 'allergy', 'Wiggles', 'are', 'kind', 'enough', 'even', 'ask', 'everyone', 'making', 'lunch', 'are', 'allergies', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'peanut', 'allergy', 'go', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'explain', 'epi-pens', 'allergic', 'reactions', 'symptoms', 'daughter', 'allergic', 'eggs', 'also', 'have', 'epi-pen', 'available', 'just', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'take', 'much', 'consideration', 'making', 'whole', 'song', 'food', 'allergies', 'have', 'say', 'sold', 'right', 'rest', 'DVD', 'Thank', 'Wiggles', 'making', 'daughter', 'feel', 'normal', 'food', 'allergy', 'teaching', 'other', 'kids', 'same', 'time', 'Aside', 'singing', 'dancing', 'get', 'meet', 'new', 'characters', 'magic', 'wish', 'granting', 'genie', 'friend', 'get', 'visit', 'new', 'countries', 'explore', 'different', 'cultures', 'Somehow', 'Wiggles', 'manage', 'fit', 'one', 'hour', 'movie', 'flew', 'kids', 'were', 'glued', 'TV', 'whole', 'time.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', '2', 'Up', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'loved', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'youngest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'act', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'shaking', 'tush', 'either.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'extra', 'clips', 'fun', 'photo', 'gallery', 'explored', 'children', 'were', 'most', 'interested', 'movie', 'side', 'note', 'DVD', 'insert', 'upcoming', 'features', 'Now', 'DVD', 'games', 'son', 'commandeered', 'immediately', 'now', 'bugging', 'movies', 'were', 'advertised.I', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'friends', 'family.Thank', 'again', 'NCircle', 'Entertainment', 'Wiggles', 'family', 'friendly', 'educational', 'shows', 'never', 'let', 'down']",The Wiggles: Surfer Jeff
1613286,A32ZZF5MJEV08X,B00AMA8GLI,K. Reed,"[3, 3]","Nothing proves a good part of The Wiggles success is personality driven than having six of them on screen. It feels like Greg never left. Simon Pryce, Ringo the Ringmaster and now the new red Wiggle, is Gino the Genie who fits in so well with The Wiggles and Captain Feathersword it feels like he's always been with them. Picnic: The Musical! Opens with a daring stunt, Greg sits up quickly, and the horrors of his and Murray's pasty white legs in shorts. While frolicking on the beach Anthony's dogs discover an interesting bottle and legend has it there's a genie inside who grants wishes! But Greg is back so what more could a Wiggle wish for? How about footage of Jeff really surfing!This is good old fashioned Wiggles fun, they're free from the studio to fool around making a simple grass hill look like the most fun thing in the world. You'll want to dress up like a mango and doing a silly walk too. Everyone looks like they're enjoying themselves and they want to be there. The around the world scenes are neat, were they filmed while on tour? Be on the look out for Emma as one of the dancers and something tells me Lachy has been helping Wags do hand stands. From a grown up POV this is one of the more tolerable DVDs.In real life Anthony has food sensitivities but it's his son Antonio who has the severe peanut allergy and awareness has become one of his causes. They also inform on checking if someone has an allergy before eating, not making people eat food they don't want to, and getting a grown up if there's a problem in a way that's easy for kids to grasp.",5,Harmony returns to the Wiggles World,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,1575,"['Nothing', 'good', 'part', 'Wiggles', 'success', 'personality', 'driven', 'having', 'six', 'screen', 'Greg', 'never', 'left', 'Simon', 'Pryce', 'Ringo', 'Ringmaster', 'now', 'new', 'red', 'Wiggle', 'Gino', 'Genie', 'who', 'so', 'well', 'Wiggles', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'always', 'been', 'Picnic', 'Musical', 'daring', 'stunt', 'Greg', 'up', 'quickly', 'horrors', 'Murray', 'pasty', 'white', 'legs', 'shorts', 'frolicking', 'beach', 'Anthony', 'dogs', 'discover', 'interesting', 'bottle', 'legend', 'genie', 'inside', 'who', 'wishes', 'Greg', 'back', 'so', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'Wiggle', 'wish', 'How', 'footage', 'Jeff', 'really', 'surfing', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Wiggles', 'fun', ""'re"", 'free', 'studio', 'fool', 'around', 'making', 'simple', 'grass', 'hill', 'look', 'most', 'fun', 'thing', 'world', ""'ll"", 'want', 'dress', 'up', 'mango', 'doing', 'silly', 'walk', 'too', 'Everyone', ""'re"", 'enjoying', 'want', 'be', 'there', 'world', 'scenes', 'are', 'neat', 'were', 'filmed', 'tour', 'Be', 'look', 'out', 'Emma', 'one', 'dancers', 'something', 'tells', 'Lachy', 'been', 'helping', 'Wags', 'do', 'hand', 'stands', 'grown', 'up', 'POV', 'one', 'more', 'tolerable', 'DVDs.In', 'real', 'life', 'Anthony', 'food', 'sensitivities', 'son', 'Antonio', 'who', 'severe', 'peanut', 'allergy', 'awareness', 'become', 'one', 'causes', 'also', 'inform', 'checking', 'someone', 'allergy', 'eating', 'not', 'making', 'people', 'eat', 'food', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'getting', 'grown', 'up', 'problem', 'way', 'easy', 'kids', 'grasp']",The Wiggles: Surfer Jeff
