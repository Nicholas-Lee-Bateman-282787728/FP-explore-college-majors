Some fans say this is the best season of the whole seven but I have to disagree with them. But like I said in previous reviews every single Buffy season is pure gold.Season two starts where season one finished, Buffy's back from her summer vacation in LA with her dad, ready to kick some vampire butt and Her romance with Angel the vampire gets more serious.This season also introduces some new characters to the show, such as band member Oz who goes on to become Willow's boyfriend and later werewolf.

It has always been so much better than the 1992 movie version starring Kristy Swanson, don't let that mess put you off on watching the series which I honestly think I would've loved even if I'd never seen it on television. Every episode seems to have lots of action (the fight scenes are generally very impressive), humor (at times that can be bizarre to say the least), something for everyone. I find it most impressive that the cast is so well assembled, so perfectly matched, they do a great job on even the strangest of scripts.  The stories don't always flow directly one from another although they seem to be linked( sometimes the link can run from one season to the next, even for years)lots of little things to watch for. In 1st season #3 Witch (one of the bizarre humor stories)we first meet Amy, she shows up again in 2nd season #16 Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,and in 3rd season and beyond. Her mother ended up trapped inside a cheerleader trophy at the end of Witch, Oz mentions that trophy in #15 Phases (he likes the way the eyes seem to follow you).I'm not really bothered by the occaisional graininess in night scenes some complain about. The mini-documentaries on disc 6 are pretty good, especially the set tours. I knew that James Marsters was American although I somehow expected him to sound more like Spike. Juliet Landau, also American, is absolutely nothing like Drusilla, seemed very likeable.My only real complaint is that 7th season will soon be broadcast and we're only up to 2nd on DVD with 3rd due this winter. At Amazon.UK the British viewers can already buy up through 4th season on DVD and about 1/2 of 6th on VHS, why do we have to wait?",4,One of the best series on television.,1028505600,"08 5, 2002",2002,1759,"['think', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'series', 'first', 'saw', 'syndication', 'FX', 'last', 'fall', 'always', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', '1992', 'movie', 'version', 'starring', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'mess', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'series', 'honestly', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'even', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'television', 'episode', 'have', 'lots', 'action', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'impressive', 'humor', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'bizarre', 'say', 'least', 'something', 'everyone', 'find', 'most', 'impressive', 'cast', 'so', 'well', 'assembled', 'so', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'even', 'strangest', 'scripts', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'flow', 'directly', 'one', 'seem', 'be', 'linked', 'sometimes', 'link', 'can', 'run', 'one', 'season', 'next', 'even', 'years', 'lots', 'little', 'things', 'watch', '1st', 'season', '3', 'Witch', 'one', 'bizarre', 'humor', 'stories', 'first', 'meet', 'Amy', 'up', 'again', '2nd', 'season', '16', 'Bewitched', 'Bothered', 'Bewildered', '3rd', 'season', 'mother', 'ended', 'up', 'trapped', 'cheerleader', 'trophy', 'end', 'Witch', 'Oz', 'mentions', 'trophy', '15', 'Phases', 'way', 'eyes', 'seem', 'follow', '.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'bothered', 'occaisional', 'graininess', 'night', 'scenes', 'complain', 'mini-documentaries', 'disc', '6', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'set', 'tours', 'knew', 'James', 'Marsters', 'was', 'American', 'somehow', 'expected', 'sound', 'more', 'Spike', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'also', 'American', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Drusilla', 'seemed', 'very', 'likeable.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', '7th', 'season', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'broadcast', ""'re"", 'only', 'up', '2nd', 'DVD', '3rd', 'due', 'winter', 'Amazon.UK', 'British', 'viewers', 'can', 'already', 'buy', 'up', '4th', 'season', 'DVD', '1/2', '6th', 'VHS', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'wait']",N/A
694976,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,B000063IOT,Adi Adler,"[2, 3]","Buffy season 2 has a very different feel than the first season. While te first season had a loose ark of Buffy vs. The Master, most of the chapters could stand by themselves, requiring no deeper knowledge of the whole Buffy / vampire mythology.During the 2nd season, the series started to take itself more seriously. The humor is still there, but it's not as light hearted as season one was. Since the first season served as an introduction to the people and themes of the series, the second one starts developing them. The caracters (especially the minor ones) are no longer caricatures (such as ""Cordelia the Shallow Cheerleader"" or ""Jenny the Cool Computer Teacher"") but beacome real people. More background is given about Angel's past. Even though there are a few 'unrelated' chapters (such as 'Bad Eggs' or 'Ted'), there were a few prominent plot arcs (such as the Angel / Buffy love story) which were viewed and analyzed through different chapters.'Taking itself more seriously' also means that the question 'what being a slayer means' is explored in depth. In 'Ted', the question of Buffy harming a non - vampire / demon / monster human comes up. We realize how lucky Buffy is to have her supporting network of friends when we realize that Kendra, the 2nd slayer (who had been activated when Buffy died at the end of season 1) has a completely different (and solitary) life. At the end of the season, Buffy comes to realize how alone she is anyway, does what she has to do, but then leaves it all behind.And then Angel turns bad (then good again for the last few meanutes of the season). This was not only THE major plot twist of the season, but also gives the 2 main actors a chance to show how good they are. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job in portraying Buffys pain and confusion while confronting the 'bad' Angel (or rather 'Angelus', as he is called in his soul - less stage), but also her power and decision during the last 2 chapters of the season, by doing what has to be done - alone. David Boreanaz finally gets a chance to portray something different than a depressed, brooding vampire with a soul ,and seems to enjoy doing it.And last (but not least) - Spike and Drussila. This is another point where season one had a flat - one - faced evil (The Master) while season 2 has a more complex and deeper pair of vilains to go against Buffy.",5,Buffy finally starts getting serious!,1048291200,"03 22, 2003",2003,2362,"['Buffy', 'season', '2', 'very', 'different', 'feel', 'first', 'season', 'te', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'loose', 'ark', 'Buffy', 'vs', 'Master', 'most', 'chapters', 'could', 'stand', 'requiring', 'deeper', 'knowledge', 'whole', 'Buffy', '/', 'vampire', 'mythology.During', '2nd', 'season', 'series', 'started', 'take', 'more', 'seriously', 'humor', 'still', 'there', 'not', 'light', 'hearted', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'served', 'introduction', 'people', 'themes', 'series', 'second', 'one', 'developing', 'caracters', 'especially', 'minor', 'ones', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'caricatures', 'such', 'Cordelia', 'Shallow', 'Cheerleader', 'Jenny', 'Cool', 'Computer', 'Teacher', 'beacome', 'real', 'people', 'More', 'background', 'given', 'Angel', 'past', 'Even', 'are', 'few', ""'unrelated"", 'chapters', 'such', ""'Bad"", 'Eggs', ""'Ted"", 'were', 'few', 'prominent', 'plot', 'arcs', 'such', 'Angel', '/', 'Buffy', 'love', 'story', 'were', 'viewed', 'analyzed', 'different', 'chapters', ""'Taking"", 'more', 'seriously', 'also', 'question', 'being', 'slayer', 'means', 'explored', 'depth', ""'Ted"", 'question', 'Buffy', 'harming', 'non', 'vampire', '/', 'demon', '/', 'monster', 'human', 'up', 'realize', 'how', 'lucky', 'Buffy', 'have', 'supporting', 'network', 'friends', 'when', 'realize', 'Kendra', '2nd', 'slayer', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'activated', 'when', 'Buffy', 'died', 'end', 'season', '1', 'completely', 'different', 'solitary', 'life', 'end', 'season', 'Buffy', 'realize', 'how', 'alone', 'anyway', 'what', 'do', 'then', 'behind.And', 'then', 'Angel', 'bad', 'then', 'good', 'again', 'last', 'few', 'meanutes', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'THE', 'major', 'plot', 'twist', 'season', 'also', '2', 'main', 'actors', 'chance', 'show', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Buffys', 'pain', 'confusion', 'confronting', ""'bad"", 'Angel', 'rather', 'called', 'soul', 'less', 'stage', 'also', 'power', 'decision', 'last', '2', 'chapters', 'season', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'alone', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'finally', 'chance', 'portray', 'something', 'different', 'depressed', 'brooding', 'vampire', 'soul', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'it.And', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Spike', 'Drussila', 'point', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'flat', 'one', 'faced', 'evil', 'Master', 'season', '2', 'more', 'complex', 'deeper', 'pair', 'vilains', 'go', 'Buffy']",N/A

694978,A30O553ONO1IIP,B000063IOT,Ahmed Khalifa,"[1, 2]","The first season of ""Buffy: The Vampire slayer"" showed tons of promise, a dose of originality and a handful of classic episodes. But overall that season didn't show the full potential of the series and its tone (which wavered between campy and light-hearted with the exception of a couple of episodes). But the second season of ""Buffy"" showed what the series truly was, an original and addictive show anchored by terrific performances, clever writing and an endearing mood. Although the second season began with the weak opener ""When she was bad"", it bounced back with numerous entertaining and sometimes wonderful stand-alone episodes (like ""School hard"", ""Lie to me"" and ""The Dark age""), then it suddenly shifted gear in the second half of the season (beginning with ""Surprise"") and never looked back. From that episode onward ""Buffy"" reached storytelling and thrill-inducing heights that few shows ever reach and combined with some truly amazing visual moments made the second season and its two-parter ending ""Becoming"" one of the best seasons of the show and the first to show its true nature and potential. Dealing with Witches, zombies, curses, mummies and of course vampires, the show oozes supernatural mayhem and thrills, while dealing with emotional and moral issues in effective and original ways that transcend the show's genre and make it something else entitrely. So these 22 episodes are mostly a delight (with a couple of clunkers like the horrible ""Bad Eggs"" and the downright awful ""Go fish"") to fans and people who want to sink head first into the show. *The DVD sets features adequate transfers which can not transcend the humble origins of the show as the first and second seasons of the show were shot on 16mm film stock resulting in a slightly grainy image, as for the extras they are plentiful and mostly entertaining*.",4,The true start of a classic and atmospheric series,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,1844,"['first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'slayer', 'showed', 'tons', 'promise', 'dose', 'originality', 'handful', 'classic', 'episodes', 'overall', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'full', 'potential', 'series', 'tone', 'wavered', 'campy', 'light-hearted', 'exception', 'couple', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'Buffy', 'showed', 'what', 'series', 'truly', 'was', 'original', 'addictive', 'show', 'anchored', 'terrific', 'performances', 'clever', 'writing', 'endearing', 'mood', 'second', 'season', 'began', 'weak', 'opener', 'When', 'was', 'bad', 'bounced', 'back', 'numerous', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'wonderful', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'School', 'hard', 'Lie', 'Dark', 'age', 'then', 'suddenly', 'shifted', 'gear', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'beginning', 'Surprise', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'Buffy', 'reached', 'storytelling', 'thrill-inducing', 'heights', 'few', 'shows', 'ever', 'reach', 'combined', 'truly', 'amazing', 'visual', 'moments', 'made', 'second', 'season', 'two-parter', 'ending', 'Becoming', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'show', 'first', 'show', 'true', 'nature', 'potential', 'Dealing', 'Witches', 'zombies', 'curses', 'mummies', 'course', 'vampires', 'show', 'supernatural', 'mayhem', 'thrills', 'dealing', 'emotional', 'moral', 'issues', 'effective', 'original', 'ways', 'transcend', 'show', 'genre', 'make', 'something', 'else', 'entitrely', '22', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'delight', 'couple', 'clunkers', 'horrible', 'Bad', 'Eggs', 'downright', 'awful', 'Go', 'fish', 'fans', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'sink', 'head', 'first', 'show', '*The', 'DVD', 'sets', 'adequate', 'transfers', 'can', 'not', 'transcend', 'humble', 'origins', 'show', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'show', 'were', 'shot', '16mm', 'film', 'stock', 'resulting', 'slightly', 'grainy', 'image', 'extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'mostly', 'entertaining*']",N/A

This is the season for the big Buffy-Angel drama. The commentaries are pretty cool, and this time around Marti Noxson and David Greenwalt got to play too. The featurettes are neat, and nice and long.This set is a bit improved over the first season set. The menus are visually nicer, and easier to navigate. They added some pretty cool 3D digital images for the DVD menus. The sound is great, but in a couple of places the picture is *very* grainy, almost like VHS taped off of broadcast, not what you'd expect from DVD made from the original masters.Like last season, they didn't include the short &quot;Previously on Buffy...&quot; montages at the beginning of each episode. In the first season this was jarring in terms of the musical scoring, but with this set it was *much* improved. Most of the time, I didn't notice at all. For some episodes they included the &quot;She is the slayer...the one girl in all the world... &quot; intro, but for others they didn't.

694984,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B000063IOT,Amanda,"[1, 2]","As someone who started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer in its fourth season, it was a little hard to watch the earlier episodes. I am not at all an Angel fan, and especially not an Angel/Buffy fan (I know that everyone swooned over their relationship, but I find her current ""relationship"" with vamp Spike has more intrigue to it, and maybe even more depth), so these earlier episodes maybe don't hold my interest as much as they should. However, being a true fan of the show, there is no way I can dislike any season. But truthfully, I think the second season is one of the best. A lot of stuff happened in these 22 episodes: Spike and Dru came to town and started wreaking havoc, Xander and Cordelia became a mismatched couple, Buffy and Angel had intimate ""relations"" which made Angel turn all evil, a new slayer came to town, and oh yeah - Buffy killed Angel. My, oh my.Season two had some classic episodes that could be put on any Buffy fan's top 10 list of episodes: ""Halloween"" is a devishly fun episode that has everyone in Sunnydale becoming whatever it is they are dressed up as; ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" is a Xander classic, where he has witch Amy put a spell on Cordelia to make her want him back, but instead it makes her hate him and makes every other female in Sunnydale love him. And of course, ""Becoming, Part One"" and ""Becoming, Part Two"", the two-part season finale, where the showdown between good (Buffy) and evil (Angel) takes place.

The Angelus phase was also some of the finest writing and acting of the second season.  There were real moments of drama and emotion and started a trend that was the beginning of the show's finest work.

It is a great one.  Some of the most memorable episodes are in this season, including &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered&quot;, &quot;Becoming&quot;, and &quot;Innocence&quot;.  The season is filled with ups and downs, with Buffy and the Scoobies duking it out with evil demons and eventually one of their closest friends.This season also introduces several of the greatest characters the show has ever seen.  The first is Spike, who in my opinion, is the greatest character Joss Whedon has ever created.  The second is Drusilla, Spikes psychic, psycho, vampire girlfriend.  The third is Oz, played by a very funny Seth Green.  The show adds Angel as a full time cast member without dropping any of the main characters from season one.This season easily sets the bar high for following seasons.  The stories are incredible with every emotion known to man impacting the viewer at least once throughout.  After watching this season, the viewer is well aware how brilliant of a television show this is.  You find yourself really relating to several of the characters in this season.

694991,A5YJR3G7XMLLV,B000063IOT,"Amazon Customer ""Reaper""","[5, 6]","Every television writer tries to create believable characters in a imaginary world like the great writers of fiction it is something for which all stive, but few achieve. Of those authors and TV producers that success are forever linked to that creation, and few have succeed as Joss Whedon did in Buffy's second season for few seasons or books have ever defined a series so completely. In a world filled with Vampires, Demons, and mythological creatures we find a believable world that sucks into the lives of characters and makes us care about their fate. The show mixes drama, humor, and surprise in a plot lines that put the characters we love through hell. Good guys characters of the scoobie gang  Xander, Willow, Giles, and sometimes Cordellia Chase are brought together and ripped apart as they struggle to survive the evil that they encounter. We are also become involved in the lives of evil vampire lovers Spike and Drusillia as their own love is ripped apart in Sunnydale. In the shows first Episode we are thrown right into an introspective episode about Buffy having to deal with the fact that she died, and to have to put that behind her. We are given the first romantic relationship with Buffy & Angel that in mid season takes an unexpected turn that ends in tragedy. The beautiful writing of this story of star crossed lovers drives the emotions of the season which makes us believe that love can conquer all even a 224 year age gap. Then we find ourselves confronted by reality that in this case love is a threat to people's lives. The brutal return of Angelus in the midseason episode ""Surprise"" sets Buffy up against the one person she loves the most. As the second season heads toward its conclusion Joss throughs us another trick that will become familiar over the next 4 seasons as Ms. Calender is killed by Angelus just as she is about to restore his soul. Once more our emotions are put through the meatgrinder that concludes in the two part season finale ""Becoming pt1"" and ""Becoming pt2"". I have seen alot of writers use up so much during the rest of the season that season finales seem nothing more then half hearted affairs, but here we find one of the truly great season endings of all time. Buffy must finally confront Angelus in a do or die battle to save the world, but in the spirit of the season there are twists and surprises that keep us riveted to the screen. Giles, Buffy's watcher, is captured and tortured by Angelus. Kendra another Slayer and Buffy's friend is killed by Druisilla. Buffy is believed responible by the police, and must hide from them as she struggles to overcome Angelus bid to destroy the world by unleashing a demon that would suck the world into hell. In the 11th hour with hope and most of Buffy's allies taken out of the game (Willow in the hospital,Giles captured by Angelus, and Xander to emotionally confused to be of any help to Buffy), and Buffy's mom forced to confront the fact that her daughter is the slayer Spike one of Buffy's worst enemies comes to her aid. In an uneasy alliance Buffy and Spike battle Angelus and the vampires who follow him. Xander arrives and frees Giles, and soon only Angelus and Buffy are left in the fight with Spike taking an unconcious Drusillia away from Sunnydale. Meanwhile, back at the hospital Willow awakes and with help gathers the supplies necessary to restore Angel's soul. Then just as Buffy is about to make her killing blow Angelus hollows in torment, and collapses to the ground. Angel has returned, but even as Buffy reaches out to once more hold the man she loves the demon begins to awake. The only way to defeat the demon now is not to kill the evil vampire that freed it, but the man she loves whose soul has just been returned. Buffy has no choice but to send the man she loves to hell, and as he is sucked into hell he stares into and tries to reach out with his hand to onto her. Buffy has succeeded in saving the world, but in doing so has pushed herself beyond the breaking point.Buffy leaves Sunnydale after one last look at her friends, and like the great hero's of the great greek tragedies Buffy is emotional broken by the cost her victory had cost her. The final scene with Buffy leaving in a bus out of Sunnydale says in silence what words never could.",5,Simply the best,1030406400,"08 27, 2002",2002,4282,"['television', 'writer', 'create', 'believable', 'characters', 'imaginary', 'world', 'great', 'writers', 'fiction', 'something', 'stive', 'few', 'achieve', 'authors', 'TV', 'producers', 'success', 'are', 'forever', 'linked', 'creation', 'few', 'have', 'succeed', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'did', 'Buffy', 'second', 'season', 'few', 'seasons', 'books', 'have', 'ever', 'defined', 'series', 'so', 'completely', 'world', 'filled', 'Vampires', 'Demons', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'find', 'believable', 'world', 'lives', 'characters', 'care', 'fate', 'show', 'mixes', 'drama', 'humor', 'surprise', 'plot', 'lines', 'put', 'characters', 'love', 'hell', 'Good', 'guys', 'characters', 'scoobie', 'gang', 'Xander', 'Willow', 'Giles', 'sometimes', 'Cordellia', 'Chase', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'ripped', 'apart', 'struggle', 'survive', 'evil', 'encounter', 'are', 'also', 'become', 'involved', 'lives', 'evil', 'vampire', 'lovers', 'Spike', 'Drusillia', 'own', 'love', 'ripped', 'apart', 'Sunnydale', 'shows', 'first', 'Episode', 'are', 'thrown', 'right', 'introspective', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'having', 'deal', 'fact', 'died', 'have', 'put', 'are', 'given', 'first', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'mid', 'season', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'tragedy', 'beautiful', 'writing', 'story', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'emotions', 'season', 'believe', 'love', 'can', 'conquer', 'even', '224', 'year', 'age', 'gap', 'Then', 'find', 'confronted', 'reality', 'case', 'love', 'threat', 'people', 'lives', 'brutal', 'return', 'Angelus', 'midseason', 'episode', 'Surprise', 'sets', 'Buffy', 'up', 'one', 'person', 'most', 'second', 'season', 'heads', 'conclusion', 'Joss', 'trick', 'will', 'become', 'familiar', 'next', '4', 'seasons', 'Ms.', 'Calender', 'killed', 'Angelus', 'just', 'restore', 'soul', 'Once', 'more', 'emotions', 'are', 'put', 'meatgrinder', 'two', 'part', 'season', 'finale', 'Becoming', 'pt1', 'Becoming', 'pt2', 'have', 'seen', 'alot', 'writers', 'use', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'rest', 'season', 'season', 'finales', 'seem', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'half', 'hearted', 'affairs', 'here', 'find', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'season', 'endings', 'time', 'Buffy', 'must', 'finally', 'confront', 'Angelus', 'do', 'die', 'battle', 'save', 'world', 'spirit', 'season', 'are', 'twists', 'surprises', 'keep', 'riveted', 'screen', 'Giles', 'Buffy', 'watcher', 'captured', 'tortured', 'Angelus', 'Kendra', 'Slayer', 'Buffy', 'friend', 'killed', 'Druisilla', 'Buffy', 'believed', 'responible', 'police', 'must', 'hide', 'overcome', 'Angelus', 'bid', 'destroy', 'world', 'unleashing', 'demon', 'would', 'suck', 'world', 'hell', '11th', 'hour', 'hope', 'most', 'Buffy', 'allies', 'taken', 'game', 'Willow', 'hospital', 'Giles', 'captured', 'Angelus', 'Xander', 'emotionally', 'confused', 'be', 'help', 'Buffy', 'Buffy', 'mom', 'forced', 'confront', 'fact', 'daughter', 'slayer', 'Spike', 'one', 'Buffy', 'worst', 'enemies', 'aid', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'battle', 'Angelus', 'vampires', 'who', 'follow', 'Xander', 'arrives', 'frees', 'Giles', 'soon', 'only', 'Angelus', 'Buffy', 'are', 'left', 'fight', 'Spike', 'taking', 'unconcious', 'Drusillia', 'away', 'Sunnydale', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'hospital', 'Willow', 'awakes', 'help', 'gathers', 'supplies', 'necessary', 'restore', 'Angel', 'soul', 'Then', 'just', 'Buffy', 'make', 'killing', 'blow', 'Angelus', 'torment', 'ground', 'Angel', 'returned', 'even', 'Buffy', 'out', 'once', 'more', 'hold', 'man', 'demon', 'awake', 'only', 'way', 'defeat', 'demon', 'now', 'not', 'kill', 'evil', 'vampire', 'freed', 'man', 'soul', 'just', 'been', 'returned', 'Buffy', 'choice', 'send', 'man', 'hell', 'sucked', 'hell', 'tries', 'reach', 'out', 'hand', 'Buffy', 'succeeded', 'saving', 'world', 'doing', 'so', 'pushed', 'breaking', 'point.Buffy', 'Sunnydale', 'one', 'last', 'look', 'friends', 'great', 'hero', 'great', 'greek', 'tragedies', 'Buffy', 'emotional', 'broken', 'cost', 'victory', 'had', 'cost', 'final', 'scene', 'Buffy', 'leaving', 'bus', 'Sunnydale', 'silence', 'what', 'words', 'never', 'could']",N/A

It also introduces a person from Giles's checkered past, something they previously hadn't touched on.Lie To Me:  A former friend of buffy's returns to town, but is acting strange.  He has something to do with a cult that worships vampires as well as possibly Spike and Drusilla.What's My Line? 1&amp;2:  They introduce another slayer, one with a horrible accent, must have taken lessons from ms cleo.  A big bad is renewed and another is crippled.Innocence:  Angel looses his soul and becomes Angelus, an insanely cruel and sadistic vampire.  He then starts stalking Buffy and the rest of the scoobies with zeal.Phases:  Oz turns out to have a secret that runs in the family.Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered:  A funny tale of Xander using magic to try to get Cordelia back.  Only it fails to affect her at all but every woman he comes across falls madly in love with him.Passion:  A dark and intense episode, showing how devious and cruel Angelus can be.Becoming 1&amp;2:  Angelus, Drusilla, and Spike have a demon that could suck this reality into hell, and they are willing to use it once they can figure it out.

So, Season 1 was humorous, with some cool action sequences and lots of bad vampire acting. I wasn't expecting much more from season 2. Well, I was wrong. Dead wrong.Buffy Season 2 starts off with a bang. Over the summer, Xander and Willow have grown close while Buffy was down in LA enjoying the time off. Buffy returns with a vengenace, and deep seeded issues about the vampire master who tried to kill her (season finale of season 1) As the episodes go on, Buffy and her friends make new friends and form new relationships. Angel becomes a rather important character as well, and he is seen in MANY episodes.New to this season is Spike, and his mentally insane vampire babe, Drusilla. (Isn't she one of Cinderella's evil stepsisters?!?) We discover more about Angel and his past, get rid of the ""annoited one"" or annoying one as Spike refers to him as. We get more action, more deaths and more vampire humor, Buffy style.As campy as this show is, it has a HUGE cult following. If you take the time and watch an episode or two, you will discover why, like I did. Buffy is more of a satire about vampires, but done rather seriously. We are supposed to beleive that vampires have these...monsterous faces when they attack, and not laugh??

The point that it was Angel's demon who committed all the crimes, yet Angel had to take on the guilt and punishment of it. Buffy learned the lesson from this, she did not realize Angel's soul was for tormenting purposes and gave him happiness, which really freed Angel from his torment at the expense for the ending of their relationship, and the danger of the ending of the world.

The second season is a lot more ambitious (remember, the first season only had twelve episodes, unlike the rest which had 22).The story arcs in the second season are brilliant.  The romance between Angel and Buffy reached gothic heights with Surprise/Innocence (Surprise is astonishing).  When Angel turns bad, David Boreanaz manages to do a sensational job of acting the transition (the episodes ""Passion"" and ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" are incredible in detailing this, and Buffy's reaction).  Willow's romance with Oz is wonderful, and Giles attachment to Jenny Calendar a welcome addition.This show still manages to be surprisingly funny (as seen in Halloween, and Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered) and packs a wallop (the two part season ender, Becoming I & II, are essential viewing for any Buffy fans.  They are incredibly moving).  Yes, there are some clunkers (Killed by Death, Bad Eggs), but they are more than redeemed.My favourites are: Becoming I & II, Surprise/Innocence, I Only Have Eyes for You, Passion, School Hard, When She Was Bad, and Lie To MeFor a show set in high school, the writers have neatly side-stepped making a caricature of Anthony Stewart Head's librarian/Watcher Giles.  His befuddled sexiness is immensely appealing.  Alyson Hannigan's performance as wallflower Willow blooming into a witch (her growing powers are smartly charted by writers all the way through season six) is strong, and having the animosity between Xander and Cordelia boil over into lust was a masterstroke.  Finally, we have to give the star her due.  Sarah Michelle Gellar proved with this season that she's actually a capable actress, both with comic timing (Halloween) and pathos (Surprise/Innocence).The second season was an immense improvement over the first season (a solid debut) and the quality continues.

These are two very talented people with a lot of interesting things to say, but at times they forget that some of the people watching these DVDs are Buffy newbies.  At times they reveal key plot developments in future seasons without warning.  So, anyone who hasn't seen BtVS beyond season 2 may want to skip the commentaries until after they have caught up.  At the very least, they should wait until they have watched ALL of the episodes on the entire set to go back and watch the commentaries, because while they contain just a few important spoilers beyond season 2, they all contain LOTS of spoilers about the remaining episodes in season 2 beyond the eps being commented on (very serious spoilage, I might add).

They are the Sid And Nancy of vampires. They are to be the main villains, until a shocking turn of events at the end of episode ""Surprise"" changes everything. So many things happened this season. Revelations were made about Oz in ""Phases"", Angel's past in ""Becoming Part 1"", teacher Jenny Calendar in ""Innocence"", Giles' younger days in ""The Dark Age"" and much more. The episode ""Passions"" was a strong and devastating episode. Horrifying, sad, shocking. That's Buffy for you. The ability to be scary and deep and make you believe it, to turn around and have something really funny happen or said. The show does it so seamlessly. The show can be great camp as well. The show also knows that. They don't take the campy stuff seriously at all. One U.K. website said otherwise a while back, but that's because they didn't know any better. The camp doesn't come often, but when it does it shows that they are all in the joke. The audience gets it. Some detractors don't. Buffy isn't camp. It can be, but that's only for fun. It can quickly turn around at the drop of a hat and attack you with serious, unrelenting drama that is usually better than most acclaimed dramas on air. Buffy never gets that kind of recognition because it's called ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"". Oh well. Buffy became notorious for killing off a much liked(or loved) character. One happens here that shows you that anything can happen in Sunnydale. No one is safe. James Marsters as Spike and Juliet Landau as Drusilla are real finds. They are definitley two of the most interesting characters to grace television screens. The cast is in fine form here. The gang were all on target from the beginning, but they just keep getting better and better. They are real. Some may have odd lives and unearthly abilities, but they are still real characters with real, normal everyday problems. That has always been the genius of Buffy and creator Joss Whedon. Take real issues and turn them into horror stories. Brilliant. There are a few mediocre episodes here, like ""Inca Mummy Girl"", and ""Bad Eggs"". But even the worst episode is ten times better than most good shows on T.V. Season two headed for it's final season story arc in the two part season finale ""Becoming Part 1"" and ""Becoming Part 2"". It's an epic tale with great moments and great shocks. It made viewers want to fast forward immediatley to season 3. Buffy has always been one of the richest shows on T.V. with it's lush direction, sharp wit, deep stories, impecable mythology, incredible acting, and so on. Season two delivers the goods. The extra features here are a lot more generous than the extras for the season one DVD set. Thank you Joss for that!. We got audio commentary from David Greenwalt on a couple episodes; An interview with Joss Whedon; TV spots; Still gallery; and a whole lot more. It's a deluxe package. It is not meant to be missed. If you are a Buffy detractor, it's time to wake up and realize what it's all about. Leave the dark side and come on over to the smart side. I can't wait for season 3 DVD. It's my favorite.

695008,A1DDSC8W1D9L6K,B000063IOT,"""belthazaar""","[1, 1]","Truly magnificent. Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Season II is the heart of the series. Back due to popular demand, Season II begins with Buffy and the Scoobies returning from Summer Break, only to find that the Master may not truly be gone. When his lackeys due their best to ressurect him, the episode focuses on the emotional damage left on Buffy due to her death. She comes to terms with it, and grows both emotionally and physically.That is basically the theme of the season. Growth. As juniors, the Scoobies find themselves at an awkward time. But one that is perfect for TV. The Season focuses on Buffy coming to terms with her role in the world, as presented in ""What's my Line"" Pt. 1 and 2. It also finds Willow breaking out of her shell and becoming more outspoken, and Xander actually obtaining a girl-friend, albeit Cordelia, who also grows from a snotty popular girl, to a snotty popular girl with semi-important points.We also learn about the past lives each character has lived. We learn more about Buffy's past at Hemory High, and discover just how evil Angel really was. We then find the Scoobies pushed to their limit without the merciless acts perpetrated by their former friend Angel, and the effects of one of those acts, that being the death of one of the main characters. Angels descent into darkness brings out a side of Buffy not yet seen...her willingness to do whatever is right...no matter what the cost, even if it kills her one true love.At a time when budget increases give Whedon more room to work and more space to realize his dreams, the series hits one of its two highest points, the next not seen until the fifth season. Buffy hits a creative peak here. This is after the limited resources which made the plots some what hokey, and before ratings importance forced the show to comform to whatever the viewers wanted to see the most.

Anyway, if you're expecting a bunch of cheesey one liners and alot of attractive people, uh, well, you've come to right place I guess.Let's review kiddies: Master comes, Master makes the Annointed One, Master dies. With me so far? I hope so, because this is where it gets difficult. Angel, he's a vampire. So, naturaly the Slayer should, well, slay him. Oh but back up, he as a soul. Well, he's still a vampire so OFF WITH HIS HEAD!! But he hates being a vampire, and to compound that problem, he's in love with Buffy, and (gulp) she's in love with him.Now, on to season 2. With the Master gone, who's going to terrorize the Hellmouth? That position is filled very aptly by Spike, a rather nasty vampire with a pention for rhyming and his wickedly drooly girlfriend Drusilla. Between this and Angel and Willow and Xander (her two best friends) she has a hell of time keeping order.But Angel and Buffy, Oh man, what a fantastic, absolutely beautiful love story. William Shakespeare couldn't have written a better love story if he tried. The amazing persision and depth of this love story is so pehnominal almost to the point of hatred. You find yourself turning away from the TV because you can't watch Buffy and Angel struggle and fight their emotions. I personally found myself yelling at the TV and narrowing my eyes when I was watching this. You hate each of them for doing certain things that neither would do in a &quot;normal&quot; relationship. You down right dispise Angel and hate Buffy, but you know they're meant to be together, but do they?Now, on a differant note is Willow and Xander and the inclusion of Oz into their group. Oz, for spoilers sake, is a werewolf who has a crush on Willow, who finally gives up HER crush on Xander. These subplots are a stark contrast between Buffy and Angel's romance and it's rather refreshing to see a not so heavy relationship.So, if you're a fan of TV, or good TV at that, see this, because if you don't, well, you're missing out.",5,"Please people, watch this.",1054252800,"05 30, 2003",2003,2117,"['Vampire', 'Slayer', 'What', 'dumb', 'title', 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'chick', 'dude', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'right', 'Anyway', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'bunch', 'cheesey', 'one', 'liners', 'alot', 'attractive', 'people', 'uh', 'well', ""'ve"", 'come', 'right', 'place', 'guess.Let', 'review', 'kiddies', 'Master', 'Master', 'Annointed', 'One', 'Master', 'so', 'far', 'hope', 'so', 'where', 'difficult', 'Angel', 'vampire', 'So', 'Slayer', 'should', 'well', 'slay', 'Oh', 'back', 'up', 'soul', 'Well', 'still', 'vampire', 'so', 'WITH', 'HIS', 'HEAD', 'being', 'vampire', 'compound', 'problem', 'love', 'Buffy', 'gulp', 'love', 'him.Now', 'season', '2', 'Master', 'gone', 'who', 'going', 'terrorize', 'Hellmouth', 'position', 'filled', 'very', 'aptly', 'Spike', 'rather', 'nasty', 'vampire', 'pention', 'rhyming', 'wickedly', 'drooly', 'girlfriend', 'Drusilla', 'Between', 'Angel', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'hell', 'time', 'keeping', 'order.But', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'Oh', 'man', 'what', 'fantastic', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'written', 'better', 'love', 'story', 'tried', 'amazing', 'persision', 'depth', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'pehnominal', 'almost', 'point', 'hatred', 'find', 'turning', 'away', 'TV', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'struggle', 'fight', 'emotions', 'personally', 'found', 'yelling', 'TV', 'narrowing', 'eyes', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'hate', 'doing', 'certain', 'things', 'would', 'do', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'relationship', 'down', 'right', 'dispise', 'Angel', 'hate', 'Buffy', 'know', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'together', 'do', 'Now', 'differant', 'note', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'inclusion', 'Oz', 'group', 'Oz', 'spoilers', 'sake', 'werewolf', 'who', 'crush', 'Willow', 'who', 'finally', 'up', 'crush', 'Xander', 'subplots', 'are', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'romance', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'see', 'not', 'so', 'heavy', 'relationship.So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'TV', 'good', 'TV', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'well', ""'re"", 'missing', 'out']",N/A

Agnew ""rothwyn""","[1, 1]","""Well, we could grind our enemies into taucum powder with a sledgehammer, but gosh, we did that last night.:- XanderThat really sums up the second season of Buffy. It builds on what it laid to foundation with the first (and sadly short) season, and shoots into hyperdrive to tell great stories, explore the chracters, the world, and the themes of the show. Sure, we did that last night, but it was  fun.The relationship between Buffy, the average girl-turned-mankind's-last-hope and Angel, the vampire with a tortured soul, is at the center of the main story thread of season two, and is handled with delicacy and grace, and with unflinching tragedy. There are some disturbing echoes of abusive relationships in the real world here, along with the overtones of how people you think you know can change horribly. Of course, it's also just good Buffy.The main characters are all back from season one, and all of them grow while still remaining true to their roots. In addition, some really nifty new characters show up, including the duty-first slayer, Kendra, the insane vampire who Angel sired when he was still evil, Druscilla, the coolest werewolf ever, Oz, and everyone's favorite leather-clad pottymouth, William the Bloody, Spike to you. Of all of these characters, Spike rises into the ranks of Buffy greatness with style and fun to spare, holding his own against the brooding Angel and the feisty Buffy, even though the two lovebirds have more experience under their belts. No wonder Wedon decided to make him a mainstay.However, where things really turn spectacular is the revelation of the full extent of Angel's curse, courtesy of some vengeful gypsies. He will be burdened with a soul for all time, unless he experiences a moment of true happiness. Guess what he and Buffy do.This storyline plays out so well, and pulls on so many heartstrings, it's out-emotes any tragic romance ever made for TV, and a lot that weren't. David Boreanaz really shows his acting chops as he transforms from the brooding but sweet Angel to the wholly evil Angelus. Angelus is so different from all of Buffy's other villains, mainly because he's Angel's polar opposite, someone who enjoys causing pain so much. It's downright spooky to see Boreanaz playing the role so well. This change of character is best displayed after Angelus has killed a character close to the Scooby gang, and we hear Boreanaz doing a voice-over concerning the need for and pain of passion. This is good TV making.The DVD features a set of extras similar to the first, and a slightly better video and audio transfer. Of course, the fact that there are twenty-two juicy episodes in this collection makes it look all the more tasty to Buffy fans, and anyone who enjoys some good vampire action should check this out.

Essentially the big evil to be fought with this season is Spike and Drusilla, a bonnie and clyde-esque vampire couple, who eventually team up with Buffy's former boyfriend Angel, who loses his soul after a special night.The cast is essentially the same as season 1, with Angel becoming a new regular on the show.  One of the key themes of this season is that of love, and in most cases, the call of duty in conflict with love.Standout episodes and twists occur when Kendra, a second vampire slayer is introduced (after Buffy dies momentairly in Season 1, a new slayer was called).  The two girls are polar opposites and provide some humor and insight into the life of the slayer.  Other new storylines emerge, such as Willow and Oz's blossoming love in episodes like ""Career Week"".  Xander and Cordelia begin (and more or less end) their relationship as well.  Buffy and Angels relationship reaches an emotional climax (haha) and they are torn apart shortly after in the episode ""innocence"".  Also this season boasts one of the best and most influential Halloween episodes (Xanders military training need I say more) where the Scooby Gang is transformed into the costumes they buy in the episode aptly titled ""Halloween""As new orders of evil are released to reign havoc in all of the slayerettes lives, Buffy is finally faced with a heart-wrenching decision that isn't helped by last minute turns of events, leading to one of the most emotional finales ever.  All in all, this season is similar to season one, wiht a lot more individual demons to battle, but the general evil 'bad guy' of the season has a lot more influence throughout the story.

But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 2) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""When She was Bad"" in which Buffy returns to Sunnydale following her summer vacation (having defeated the Master), but much to the chagrin of her friends, Buffy's personality has drastically changed. Her cold demeanor grows worse when she discovers the remaining vampires in Sunnydale are planning to resurrect the Master... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Inca Mummy Girl"" in which a local museum mummy is accidentally summoned to life with the goal of destroying lives, and ""The Dark Age"" in which the mysterious past of Rupert Giles is revealed to have included witchcraft and a summoned demon intent on killing him and his friend...Below is a list of episodes included on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 2) DVD:Episode 13 (When She was Bad)Episode 14 (Some Assembly Required)Episode 15 (School Hard)Episode 16 (Inca Mummy Girl)Episode 17 (Reptile Boy)Episode 18 (Halloween)Episode 19 (Lie to Me)Episode 20 (The Dark Age)Episode 21 (What's My Line?

Enter the psychopathic vampire Spike (James Marsters), a.k.a. ""William the Bloody,"" and his demented paramour Drusilla (Juliet Landau), to rearrange the pecking order and initiate a violent ongoing vendetta against the Slayer.  Spike has two Slayer kills already to his credit, and is eager for a third; mad Drusilla, before the season is out, will bag one of her own to match him.The Bonnie-and-Clyde vampire duo were created by Buffy's great love, Angel, before his soul was restored  -  when he was known as Angelus, the Scourge of Europe.  With classic hubris, Buffy unknowingly sows the seeds of her own psyche's doom by consummating her love with Angel, costing him his regained soul and reverting him to the exceedingly violent killer he once was.  The act ends up costing her the lives of many near and dear loved ones  -  and pits her in a life-and-death apocalyptic struggle that will force her to lose her greatest love...or the world, itself.This was the greatest tear-jerker season of Buffy, and  -  along with the third season  -  its highest dramatic peak.  The melodrama is intense, the tragedy even more so.  The story arc is very impressively handled, focusing first on Buffy's conflict with Spike and Drusilla, and the two killer vampires' newfound conflict with their sire and former mentor in evil, Angel, and then lethally tipping the scale with Angel's fall from grace and reunion with the diabolical duo.New loves are to be found, along with new cast members, most notably Seth Green as Oz, Willow's lycanthropically cursed boyfriend.  There are numerous surprises and betrayals, and more twists and turns in loyalties and allegiances than can  -  or should  -  be easily recounted.Watch the second season collection, and see what really hooked an entire generation on this incredible series.",5,"""Whom Gods Destroy...""",1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,2021,"['first', 'make', 'mad', 'Buffy', 'second', 'season', 'succeeded', 'elevating', 'romantic', 'melodrama', 'high', 'epic', 'tragedy.With', 'Buffy', 'successful', 'defeat', 'Master', 'Order', 'Aurelius', 'chaotic', 'disarray', 'Enter', 'psychopathic', 'vampire', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'a.k.a', 'William', 'Bloody', 'demented', 'paramour', 'Drusilla', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'rearrange', 'pecking', 'order', 'initiate', 'violent', 'ongoing', 'vendetta', 'Slayer', 'Spike', 'two', 'Slayer', 'kills', 'already', 'credit', 'eager', 'third', 'mad', 'Drusilla', 'season', 'out', 'will', 'bag', 'one', 'own', 'match', 'him.The', 'Bonnie-and-Clyde', 'vampire', 'duo', 'were', 'created', 'Buffy', 'great', 'love', 'Angel', 'soul', 'was', 'restored', 'when', 'was', 'known', 'Angelus', 'Scourge', 'Europe', 'classic', 'hubris', 'Buffy', 'unknowingly', 'seeds', 'own', 'psyche', 'doom', 'consummating', 'love', 'Angel', 'costing', 'regained', 'soul', 'reverting', 'exceedingly', 'violent', 'killer', 'once', 'was', 'act', 'up', 'costing', 'lives', 'many', 'dear', 'loved', 'ones', 'life-and-death', 'apocalyptic', 'struggle', 'will', 'force', 'lose', 'greatest', 'love', 'world', 'itself.This', 'was', 'greatest', 'tear-jerker', 'season', 'Buffy', 'third', 'season', 'highest', 'dramatic', 'peak', 'melodrama', 'intense', 'tragedy', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'story', 'arc', 'very', 'impressively', 'handled', 'focusing', 'first', 'Buffy', 'conflict', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'two', 'killer', 'vampires', 'newfound', 'conflict', 'sire', 'former', 'mentor', 'evil', 'Angel', 'then', 'lethally', 'tipping', 'scale', 'Angel', 'fall', 'grace', 'reunion', 'diabolical', 'duo.New', 'loves', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'most', 'notably', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Oz', 'Willow', 'lycanthropically', 'cursed', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'numerous', 'surprises', 'betrayals', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'loyalties', 'allegiances', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'easily', 'recounted.Watch', 'second', 'season', 'collection', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'hooked', 'entire', 'generation', 'incredible', 'series']",N/A

695024,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B000063IOT,Busy Body,"[0, 0]","In case you hadn't noticed, Joss Whedon is a genius. Writer and director of some of the greatest episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, his work is stellar and has been praised by TV critics the world over. After a successful run earlier in the year in the form of Season 1, Buffy returned with full force in the US on September 15th 1997 for it's much praised second season.The season begins with When She Was Bad. Written and directed by none other than Joss Whedon, it sees Buffy return to Sunnydale after a summer in LA with her father. It is apparent that Buffy has changed - for the better. The storylines are stronger and more consistent with a lot more character development than the previous season. Episodes such as Some Assembly Required, Inca Mummy Girl, Ted, Bad Eggs, Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered, I Only Have Eyes For You and Go Fish follow a similar pattern as that of Season 1 in the way they are singular episodes that do not have a knock-on effect in the future. School Hard sees the arrival of Spike and Drusilla in Sunnydale. Spike is 124 years old (he reminds us in Season 4 that he is ""only 126"") and has killed two Slayers in the Boxer Rebellion and New York. Drusilla is Spike's companion; drove insane by Angel when she was a human who killed everyone she loved before finally turning her into a vampire. They make many attempts to kill Buffy and end the world in episodes such as School Hard, Halloween, Lie To Me and What's My Line Parts 1 and 2 before becoming a bigger threat to Buffy as the season chugs along.Love plays a bigger role in the second season than it does in the first with almost every member of the Scooby Gang finding themselves in love. Giles continues to hide his attraction from Jenny Calendar - that is until she asks him to a Football game on a date. Their relationship is an on/off one that has its fair share of highs and lows before Jenny's subsequent death later on. While Xander continues to pine for Buffy, he realises he's getting no where as Buffy is more interested in Angel and finds himself secretly falling for Cordelia and vice versa. Willow has been rather unlucky in love. She starts to date Oz, a super-cool guitarist. Her love for him is proved when she finds out, in the worst possible way, that he is a werewolf. Their relationship is strong and lasted until Season 4. But when it comes to relationships in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, none is more troubled, tormented, certain and passionate than that of Buffy and Angel. Their love for each other is legendary as he is a vampire and she is a vampire Slayer. They continue to see each other in almost every episode of the first half of Season 2, but become more romantically inclined in the episode What's My Line Part 2. Angel is almost killed at the hands of Spike as he tries to transfer Angel's strength to Drusilla. They are both deeply and madly in love by the episode Surprise and end up sleeping together on Buffy's 17th birthday. She unknowingly undoes Angel's curse which results in him losing his soul and turning back into the evil, demented vampire that he was eighty years previously. He goes to Spike and Drusilla, who are still trying to work on a way to kill the Slayer, and offers to work side by side with them to kill Buffy. He goes after the people she loves, like he did with Drusilla, and attempts to kill them.The season finale, Becoming Part 1 and Becoming Part 2 are both written and directed by Joss Whedon and represent his best work on Season 2. Angelus plans to open the portal to Hell through the statue of Acathla which will suck everything on Earth into Hell where every living being with a soul will experience unbearable torment and eternal hell. Only Angel's blood can open the portal and therefore, only his blood can close it. Willow works on the spell of restoration and returns Angel's soul after he opens the portal. No matter what, the only way it can be closed is if Angel is killed. His soul is restored, but Buffy knows the only way to save the world is to send Angel to Hell. This makes it all the more gut-wrenching and heart-breaking for Buffy and the audience - not only because Angel has been restored, but because he will have to suffer eternal torment and torture in Hell now that he has a soul. Buffy kisses Angel before plunging him into Hell. This all proves too much for Buffy now that her mum has found out that she is the Slayer, something she doesn't accept. Becoming is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television that deserves all the praise it has received.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Many fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer consider Season 2 to be the best of the entire series. I'm not sure about that, but it sure does have some of the best episodes of Season 2 - Surprise, Innocence, Passion and Becoming Parts 1 and 2 are all undeniable proof of this and are true classics in TV history. It's a shame that Buffy as a TV show doesn't get enough recognition because it really is good. People who don't watch the show are put off by te show's name and see it as a sexy girl who scuttles around killing vampires - but the show is so much more than that. If everyone between ages 15 and 40 watched Season 2 of Buffy, I could guarantee that more than 80% would love it to bits.",5,The season where Buffy truly came into its own.....,1030147200,"08 24,

695026,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000063IOT,calvinnme,"[0, 0]","Season two of Buffy is the finest season of this series and of any television series I have ever seen. With the series renewed for a complete second season, creator Joss Whedon decides to depart from his basic ""Monster of the Week"" format of season one and present the season in story-arc format. The first part of the season presents vampires Spike and Drusilla as villains, and they are interesting from the moment they are introduced. Spike has brought his vampire mate Drusilla to Sunnydale in search of a mystical cure for her chronic illness. The answer for her cure brings up the issue of Angel's place in both their pasts and indicates the depths of the evil of Angel's unsouled persona, Angelus.Also throughout the first half of the season, the romance between Buffy and Angel builds. At midseason Angel's ""curse"" of a soul is lifted and in a surprise twist he is once again the evil unsouled Angelus, perhaps the worst of all vampires ever in existence. Buffy spends the rest of the season dealing with both her guilt over her part in the loss of Angel's soul and her duty to kill Angelus who has the outward appearance and memories of her dearest love, and nothing else. This hesitation on her part causes the death of someone near to the scoobies, and ultimately Buffy decides that it is time to take the fight to Angel. She forms a strange alliance with Spike for the purpose of killing Angel, when she learns that Spike dislikes Angel for reasons of his own. For one he is none too keen about Angel's current plan to cause the end of the world since it turns out that Spike actually enjoys comingling with humans - of course for completely selfish and unsouled reasons. Also, Spike does not like the romantic attention Drusilla has been giving Angel since Angel has lost his soul. This is the first we see of the poetic side of Spike which is investigated much more deeply from season five onward. The final battle is preceded by a ""good demon"", Whistler, giving Buffy a few words of advice on how to deal with Angel. Buffy responds by telling Whistler not to worry, that she has nothing left to lose. Whistler prophetically tells her after she has already left his presence ""Wrong kid, you got one more thing"". That last battle between Angel/Angelus and Buffy has a shocking ending, one in which Buffy must make a choice that in many ways colors her viewpoint on life and slaying for the rest of the series.In addition to this main tragic story arc involving Angel and Buffy, there are other excellent subplots taking place. Willow begins to step away from her daydreams of a romance with Xander and begins a real relationship with Oz, a senior who has his own band and is best described as monosyllabic and devoted to Willow. Xander starts a romance of his own that can only be described as unexpected. Finally, there is the continuation from season one of the relationship between Jenny and Giles that ends abruptly when Giles learns that Jenny has misled him and the scoobies about her true reason for coming to Sunnydale.It's hard to find a perfect season of television, but this one almost completely fits the bill.",5,the most outstanding season of any TV series ever,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,3135,"['Season', 'two', 'Buffy', 'finest', 'season', 'series', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'renewed', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'depart', 'basic', 'Monster', 'Week', 'format', 'season', 'one', 'present', 'season', 'story-arc', 'format', 'first', 'part', 'season', 'vampires', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'villains', 'are', 'interesting', 'moment', 'are', 'introduced', 'Spike', 'brought', 'vampire', 'mate', 'Drusilla', 'Sunnydale', 'search', 'mystical', 'cure', 'chronic', 'illness', 'answer', 'cure', 'up', 'issue', 'Angel', 'place', 'pasts', 'depths', 'evil', 'Angel', 'unsouled', 'persona', 'Angelus.Also', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'romance', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'builds', 'midseason', 'Angel', 'curse', 'soul', 'lifted', 'surprise', 'twist', 'once', 'again', 'evil', 'unsouled', 'Angelus', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'vampires', 'ever', 'existence', 'Buffy', 'rest', 'season', 'dealing', 'guilt', 'part', 'loss', 'Angel', 'soul', 'duty', 'kill', 'Angelus', 'who', 'outward', 'appearance', 'memories', 'dearest', 'love', 'nothing', 'else', 'hesitation', 'part', 'death', 'someone', 'scoobies', 'ultimately', 'Buffy', 'time', 'take', 'fight', 'Angel', 'strange', 'alliance', 'Spike', 'purpose', 'killing', 'Angel', 'when', 'Spike', 'dislikes', 'Angel', 'reasons', 'own', 'one', 'none', 'too', 'keen', 'Angel', 'current', 'plan', 'cause', 'end', 'world', 'out', 'Spike', 'actually', 'comingling', 'humans', 'course', 'completely', 'selfish', 'unsouled', 'reasons', 'Also', 'Spike', 'not', 'romantic', 'attention', 'Drusilla', 'been', 'giving', 'Angel', 'Angel', 'lost', 'soul', 'first', 'see', 'poetic', 'side', 'Spike', 'investigated', 'much', 'more', 'deeply', 'season', 'five', 'onward', 'final', 'battle', 'preceded', 'good', 'demon', 'Whistler', 'giving', 'Buffy', 'few', 'words', 'advice', 'how', 'deal', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'telling', 'Whistler', 'not', 'worry', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'Whistler', 'prophetically', 'already', 'left', 'presence', 'Wrong', 'kid', 'got', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'last', 'battle', 'Angel/Angelus', 'Buffy', 'shocking', 'ending', 'one', 'Buffy', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'many', 'ways', 'colors', 'viewpoint', 'life', 'slaying', 'rest', 'series.In', 'addition', 'main', 'tragic', 'story', 'arc', 'involving', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'are', 'other', 'excellent', 'subplots', 'taking', 'place', 'Willow', 'step', 'away', 'daydreams', 'romance', 'Xander', 'real', 'relationship', 'Oz', 'senior', 'who', 'own', 'band', 'best', 'described', 'monosyllabic', 'devoted', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'romance', 'own', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'unexpected', 'Finally', 'continuation', 'season', 'one', 'relationship', 'Jenny', 'Giles', 'abruptly', 'when', 'Giles', 'Jenny', 'misled', 'scoobies', 'true', 'reason', 'coming', 'Sunnydale.It', 'hard', 'find', 'perfect', 'season', 'television', 'one', 'almost', 'completely', 'bill']",N/A

Each week instead of there being a new bad guy for our heroine to pounce, it felt as if the story were moving into a much higher direction; and it was. Since we last saw Xander and Willow, their friendship turned into a bit of summer romance that was basically nothing more than two young best friends exploring life together.Although when Xander's desires for the beautiful and popular Cordelia became a possibility, his torch for the raven haired Willow soon came to an end. Meanwhile, Buffy and Angel's romance heated up behind some closed doors and Mr. Giles' crush on teacher Ms. Calendar was becoming more and more apparent. Everything seemed to be going well...Enter vampires Spike and Drusilla into the mix. The dark and mysterious couple who had only one thing on their minds: destroying the slayer. Of course in typical Buffy fashion, Spike and Drusilla were nothing more than an illusion blinding audiences from the season's real threat - Angel.On the night of Buffy's 17th birthday, she spent the night with Angel and the two made love; unknowingly setting off an ancient spell that the gypsies had cursed Angel with. The spell was to take away his soul if he were to ever experienced true happiness. And so on the night of Buffy's birthday, the man she was so deeply in love with once again became a monster. A monster who wanted to kill not only her, but everyone she was closest to.This season was about love and sacrifice. How it makes us all vulnerable and how it can make us do things we wouldn't normally do. The story was gripping and emotional; each week feeling like a new chapter in a novel you couldn't put down. The ride was bittersweet watching as Buffy had to protect herself and the ones she loved from the same person she was so deeply in love with.A showdown was inevitable...I can't imagine too many people reading this who haven't already seen it, but for those who haven't I'll say no more.Buffy really showed it's staying power with this season. It's audience began to expand, new favorite characters were introduced to the show and the writing and the acting were superb. It also introduced us to such new characters as Oz, the werewolf who stole Willow's heart, Spike, the rebel vamp with the bad attitude, Drusilla, Spike's torchered and psychotic vampire girlfriend and Kendra, the new slayer.Overall, this heartbreaking season is some of the best television ever made. It's story will move you and send chills down your spine and leave you begging for more.

We join our main cast, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Xander (Nicholas Brendon), Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), Angel (David Boreanaz), and Mr. Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), in the first actual full season of BTVS.In a very brief sense, Buffy comes back from spending time with her father in California kind of different, and a bit more mean.  She seems just a little too anxious to start slaying vampires again, and is pushing all her friends away, including Angel.  As it progresses, it ends up she's still upset and wired about the Master, as she's still having nightmares.  That problem gets taken care of.  And so we delve into a very emotional seasonal storyline, including the introduction of Spike (James Marsters), Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and Oz (Seth Green) as regular season characters, as many difficult occurences enter the worlds of our heroes such as Angel's soul, a powerful demon that can eradicate anything with just one look, death of the Anointed One, The order of Taraka, a new slayer, new love affairs, and love lost.Some of the best episodes include:  When She Was Bad, What's My Line, Surprise, Innocence, Passion, Bewitched Bewildered Bothered, I Only Have Eyes For You, and The Becoming.

695034,AUPYKCIQEITAS,B000063IOT,Cinephile,"[4, 4]","I started watching BUFFY at the start of its fourth year (having missed the high school years, for the usual reasons-- ""A show called *BUFFY*? Pah! What adolescent nonsense!""-- I thought the seeming clear break of college would be a good place to start). I was immediately hooked by its intelligence, humor and creative daring (Silent episodes! Musical episodes! Wow, they killed her! Wait-- she has a *sister*?). I started catching up with the high school years through the re-runs on F/X (and just a word here-- I think it's great that Buffy is syndicated, but F/X has made the unfortunate decision to cut minutes from episodes to make room for more ads. Such cuts are death to the intricate narrative rhythms of BUFFY, so I really would advise you to purchase the DVDs), but it was not until the heartbreaking finale of the brilliant, underrated sixth season that I finally broke down and bought the Season Two box.As I watched that season's final epiosde, ""Becoming Pt. 2,"" and wiped the tear from my eye, I went from being just a fan to realizing that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is probably the best show to air on television in the last twenty-five years (THE SOPRANOS and THE SIMPSONS run a close second and third), and certainly the most consistently excellent. I realize that praising a show for its ""consistency"" is something of a backhanded compliment, like saying your blind date has ""a nice personality."" But think about what a remarkable achievement it is -- until its disappointing final year, BUFFY never had an off-season in its seven-year run (and, like a great pop band, when the wear began to show, they called it quits). Not even THE SOPRANOS or THE SIMPSONS-- the only shows in the same period to show anywhere near BUFFY's daring or self-critical smarts-- can claim that.Season Two is the show at its best, buidling on the mythology established in the previous season, deepening the relationships between the characters, and setting up the emotional conflicts that would play out through season six. BUFFY started as a mid-season replacement in the spring of 1997, and only aired twelve episodes in that intial run. With the prospect of a full order-- and ten more episodes to play with-- in Season Two, creator Joss Whedon and his brilliant cast and crew took full advantage of the longer year, and the show pulses with the sense of creative folk energized and enthused by their success. Season Two is definitely where the passion is.""Passion,"" is, in fact, the title of season's most terrifying episode (and one of its best), but I think those coming to the show for the first time deserve to see it ""unspoiled,"" so I will try to convey my enthusiasm without giving plot points and twists away.Season Two is all about the couple-- Buffy and Angel, Giles and Jenny, Xander and Cordelia, Willow and Oz, love and duty, magic and science-- and how all of these tangle together tenderly and tragically. Perhaps by thinking about some of the behind-the-scenes ""couples,"" then, we can think about what makes the show tick:1) Joss Whedon and Sarah Michelle Gellar: Yes, he's brilliant, and yes, she's beautiful, but try to imagine one without the other (or, just watch FIREFLY or SCOOBY-DOO). As the lackluster Kirsty Swanson proved in the initial film version, it takes a special kind of performer to play a cheerleader-turned-slayer with passion and sincerity; it also takes a special kind of writer-producer-director to make that character three-dimensional and empathetic, and to allow the viewer to get caught up in fantastic plot turns.2) Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) and Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia): The entire ensemble of this show-- including Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendan, Robia La Morte, David Boreanaz, Seth Green, James Marsters, and Juliet Landau-- deserves praise, but I am continually drawn back to these two, who manage to imbue potentially hazardous stereotypes (stuffy librarian and school princess, respectively) with real humanity and wit. Neither Giles nor Cordelia are super-powered, like other characters on the show, but their honesty, intelligence and courage make them heroes, and the embodiment of the show's message that even the most extreme characters are deserving of sympathy and respect.3) Michael Gershman (cinematography) and Christophe Beck (Music): The writing's great, the direction's tight and the cast is fabulous, but where would all those elements be without these two guys, the unsung heroes of the BuffyVerse? Working for the first two years of the show on 16mm stock (most filmed shows shoot on glossier 35mm), Gershman utilized the film's narrower range and slight graininess to create a world of sharp constrasts, haunting plays of light and shadow. Composer Christophe Beck tossed out the first season's synth squiggles for a lusher orchestral sound, which echoes famed composer John Barry's edict for scoring James Bond movies: ""No matter how ridiculous the action on the screen, always make it sound like a million bucks."" Working on a relatively low-budget weekly tv show, these two men gave BUFFY the look and sound of a big-budget feature.These are just some of the reasons for investing in this wonderful program, and if they sound too technical, let me put it like this-- BUFFY is pop culture at its best, a fabulous mixture of adventure, romance, drama, subtle social commentary, screwball wit and scary horror. In this season alone, you'll get swashbuckling sword-play, spellbinding magic, goofy demons, punk rock vampires, steamy love, and the most breathtaking finale in the history of the idiot box.

The relationship between Angel and Buffy gives the pivotal and best episodes of the season. Those episodes give the story a moving, yet scary feeling. Buffy's torture begins in episode 14: Innocence... from that moment on the season is just perfect. What began with a work inside the scooby gang, Buffy's fears and hopes about her relationship with Angel and the appearance of the villains, turns by episode 14 into a real descend to hell for the characters (specially for Buffy). ""When She Was Bad"" opens the season: Buffy returns to Sunnydale, but something is wrong with her... she must face the consequences of her encounter with the master (this is perfectly embodied in the plot of the annoynted one trying to resucitate the master). In ""School Hard"" (third episode) appear the new two villains: the best the series has ever had: Spike and Drusilla. Everyone is scared to death because Spike has killed slayers before... and things get worse when he attacks them at school during a parents meeting. Episodes 9 and 10 (What's my line? two parter) bring a new slayer who was called when Buffy died (she was brought back by Xander) by the end of season 1. Then comes the real turning point of the season: in Surprise and Innocence Angel goes bad, so he starts serving Spike's plan to bring Apocalypse to earth (through a demon called the Judge). Only two episodes after this incredible two parter we find ""Passion"". That's the climax of the season: a friend of Buffy is going to be killed by Angel. This sets a fated course of action for Buffy in the two parter season finale: Becoming and Becoming II. Buffy has to kill Angel in order to save the world. Add to this the begining of a solid arc around Willow. She falls in love with Oz (a weird guy who plays in a band called Dingoes ate my baby) who becomes a werewolf in the episode ""Phases""; Willow also turns to witchcraft to restore Angel's soul through a spell. Calendar's death is one of the best moments of the series, and a few episodes later is the other great moment: Angel's death. Some standalones work very very good: like Halloween, Lie to me, Phases, I only have eyes for you and the first completely comedic episode: Bewitched, bothered and bewildered.Having this is having the real birth of the phenomenon that Buffy is now days. With this season everybody got the message loud and clear: this series is willing to take big risks, they can sacrifice anything they want... and everyone is at hand for the powers of hell.The packaging and menus are much better than those from the first season... as a matter of fact, I think these are the best menus they made for the series. The extras are excelent. It includes three featurettes, which are actually quite long.

Spike is freaking HILARIOUS..And he is without a doubt a scene stealer..And the chemistry between Spike and Druscilla is Pure or should i say Evil Magic through and through..SPIKE RULES..The people behind this show say they modeled them both after ""Sid and Nancy""..I can see that but even more Spike resembles that of Billy ""Rebel YeLL"" Idol..Another standout episode is ""Halloween"" in the words of Spike that episode ""Isn't this just....Neat????""..Definatly one going for the full comedy..My question why would WiLLow want to cover herself up like that..I don't want to say what i mean coz it will ruin it lets just say that this is the first time that WiLLow makes herself look that way..WiLLow is sexy anyway wait til you see her here..Another standout episode is "".....Bewitched....."" *can't remember the full title of episode and the box set is currently being borrowed by a friend*..In it Xander gets too much attension from the opposite sex..Another question how can he turn down WiLLow and BuFFy?? But hey i guess anything is possible on tv right..Between the ""Halloween"" and "".....Bewitched....."" episodes you may have a hard time getting your breath from laughing so hard..This season 2 you will also have loads of sight gags i won't ruin it by listing them..But all i say is watch carefully..One i would have done better..There is one part where WiLLow has a ScOOby Doo shirt on..I would have put them in ScOOby shirts that are most like them..Like Willow = Velma / BuFFy = Daphne / Angel = Fred / Xander = Shaggy..This is also the season where Angel goes evil villian..And when he does you can see how much funnier villians are..When he is good Angel he is more serious..But when he gets to be evil Angel he all of suddon becomes more like Spike..And Angel is letting the one liners fly..And Angel then gets funny and a great addition to Spike and Dru..In a interview the actor who plays ""Spike"" said ""Spike isn't really a bad guy all he needs is some Mother's love and some chocolate milk""..I think that sums up the silly corniness of this show and that is just way we love it..This Season 3 of BuFFy just keeps getting better with every episode *though i do feel that ""Bad Eggs"" was somewhat a weak effort but that is just my opinion*..BuFFy the Vampire Slayer is the ONLY modern day show that can be called an Instant Classic and can stand up along side shows that we grew up on..Nothing is as fun as BuFFy..It is very addicting..Brilliant show that never loses it's bites or blOOdy kiSSeS...Long Live BuFFy & The ScOObieS and of course Angel Dru and Spike

One was the amazing plot Arc that concerned Buffy's realtionship with Angel.  This is truly the greatest relaionship story in Television history.  The second reason is two actors: Juliet Landau as Drusilla and James Marsters as Spike.  These performances made the second season.  It was a joy whenever they were on screen.The season started out with a few lackluster episodes including the forgetable ""Some Assembly Required"".  There were also some truly excellent episodes, including ""School Hard"" and ""Lie To Me"".  THe season really hit its stride with the episode ""Innocence"".  This was my favorite episode of the season.  It had everything, great continuity, magnifient performances from everyone involved, and plot twists galore!  From then on there wasn't a bad episode(except for the worst episode of Buffy EVER! ""Killed By Death"").  Another truly astonishing episode is ""Passion"" in which a pivitol chracter is killed.  This is the most emotional episode of the season.  The season finale ""Becoming"" is another outstanding episode.  Another important chracter is killed off, and the Buffy/Angel relationship reaches a conclusion(for now).The performances of the season were the already metioned Juliet Landau and James Marsters, and two other actors: Sarah Michelle Geller and David Boreanaz gave heart-breaking performances as Buffy and Angel the star-crossed lovers.Top 5 Episodes:1.

The Second Season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer has achieved mythical status, and it certainly lives up to the hype.Season 2 is where creator Joss Whedon put every single character through the emotional grinder...and achieved some astonishingly powerful moments. Nicholas Brendon really comes into his own in this season, developing the character of Xander into an ever-more-complex character; Sarah Michelle Gellar rises to the challenge as her character is subjected to incredible emotional strains, from her mother's new boyfriend to her tumultous relationship with Angel (David Boreanaz). Angel and Buffy's relationship makes for some beautiful (and tragic) moments. Season 2 also introduced two secret weapons -- James Marsters is just stunning as Sid Vicious-inspired vampire Spike, charming, vicious and hilarious at the same time, and Juliet Landau plays the insane vampire Drusilla with a unique creepy charisma. The twisty relationship of Drusilla, Spike and Angel makes for a top-notch subplot in the season. Honorable mention also to Robia LaMorte and Anthony Stewart Head -- their characters provide a much-appreciated contrast to the teenage characters with their more grown-up perspective.The terrific scripting, a Buffy trademark, is once again in abundance. Aside from Whedon's own scripts, which always push the envelope, another standout is Marti Noxon (not surprisingly, she went on to become co-executive producer on the show), who penned some of the best scripts in Season 2 with ""What's My Line"" and my favourite episode of Season 2, ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"", a rollicking comedic masterpiece about Xander's romantic misadventures.Needless to say, I derived much enjoyment out of this mammoth six-disc set, and my respect for the series continues to grow. Can't wait for Season 3.",5,These are amazing works in visual storytelling.,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,1914,"['long', 'wait', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', 'Season', '3', 'tentatively', 'slated', 'release', 'winter', '2003', 'Second', 'Season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'achieved', 'mythical', 'status', 'certainly', 'up', 'hype.Season', '2', 'where', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'put', 'single', 'character', 'emotional', 'grinder', 'achieved', 'astonishingly', 'powerful', 'moments', 'Nicholas', 'Brendon', 'really', 'own', 'season', 'developing', 'character', 'Xander', 'ever-more-complex', 'character', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'challenge', 'character', 'subjected', 'incredible', 'emotional', 'strains', 'mother', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'tumultous', 'relationship', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'moments', 'Season', '2', 'also', 'introduced', 'two', 'secret', 'weapons', 'James', 'Marsters', 'just', 'stunning', 'Sid', 'Vicious-inspired', 'vampire', 'Spike', 'charming', 'vicious', 'hilarious', 'same', 'time', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'insane', 'vampire', 'Drusilla', 'unique', 'creepy', 'charisma', 'twisty', 'relationship', 'Drusilla', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'top-notch', 'subplot', 'season', 'Honorable', 'mention', 'also', 'Robia', 'LaMorte', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'characters', 'provide', 'much-appreciated', 'contrast', 'teenage', 'characters', 'more', 'grown-up', 'perspective.The', 'terrific', 'scripting', 'Buffy', 'trademark', 'once', 'again', 'abundance', 'Aside', 'Whedon', 'own', 'scripts', 'always', 'push', 'envelope', 'standout', 'Marti', 'Noxon', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'went', 'become', 'co-executive', 'producer', 'show', 'who', 'penned', 'best', 'scripts', 'Season', '2', 'What', 'My', 'Line', 'favourite', 'episode', 'Season', '2', 'Bewitched', 'Bothered', 'Bewildered', 'rollicking', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'Xander', 'romantic', 'misadventures.Needless', 'say', 'derived', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'mammoth', 'six-disc', 'set', 'respect', 'series', 'grow', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '3']",N/A
695047,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B000063IOT,DonAthos,"[2, 3]","By the end of this season, you should have an idea as to why Buffy is, as I say, the Greatest Show of All Time. But, of course, don't start here--you must start with the First Season and watch this in its proper order. Buffy is not standard tv-fare, viewable in any which way. There are running storylines, and the characters evolve and grow (as does the overall tone of the show); it demands to be seen in order.The Second Season contains what is possibly the best episode of all of television, all time: Becoming. Becoming's main competition comes from other episodes of Buffy. Becoming, and the Second Season, are as wonderful as they are for the emotional impact they produce. Becoming is devastating, haunting, and its climactic moment should be studied by all prospective writers as to define what ""climax"" is, and what it should do. Becoming is not, of course, the only great episode of the season. There are several others, including When She Was Bad (the season opener), Lie to Me, Innocence, Passion and I Only Have Eyes for You.There are a few episodes which are sub-par, by Buffy's high standards, but these are normally mitigated by the generally witty and spot-on dialogue, strong and consistent characterizations and the overall fun and fancy of the show itself. Representatives of the lower end include Bad Eggs, Reptile Boy, Killed by Death, and Go Fish.Notable also are a guest appearance by John Ritter (in the episode Ted) who provides one of the best guest spots in the series, the creation of the marvelous villains Spike and Drusilla, the addition of the always likable Seth Green, and the breakout acting of David Boreanaz (as Angel).The Second Season is arguably the best season of the series (I agree with this view). It has wonderfully fun plots and moments you'll never forget. Its theme is love (what other show can you intelligently talk about its seasons having *themes*!?) and the ecstacy, madness and dangers therein.",5,"The Greatest Show of All Time, Pt. 2",1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,1950,"['end', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Buffy', 'say', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'All', 'Time', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'here', 'must', 'start', 'First', 'Season', 'watch', 'proper', 'order', 'Buffy', 'not', 'standard', 'tv-fare', 'viewable', 'way', 'are', 'running', 'storylines', 'characters', 'evolve', 'grow', 'overall', 'tone', 'show', 'be', 'seen', 'order.The', 'Second', 'Season', 'what', 'possibly', 'best', 'episode', 'television', 'time', 'Becoming', 'Becoming', 'main', 'competition', 'other', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'Becoming', 'Second', 'Season', 'are', 'as', 'wonderful', 'are', 'emotional', 'impact', 'produce', 'Becoming', 'devastating', 'haunting', 'climactic', 'moment', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'prospective', 'writers', 'define', 'what', 'climax', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'Becoming', 'not', 'course', 'only', 'great', 'episode', 'season', 'are', 'several', 'others', 'including', 'When', 'Was', 'Bad', 'season', 'opener', 'Lie', 'Me', 'Innocence', 'Passion', 'Only', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'You.There', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'sub-par', 'Buffy', 'high', 'standards', 'are', 'normally', 'mitigated', 'generally', 'witty', 'spot-on', 'dialogue', 'strong', 'consistent', 'characterizations', 'overall', 'fun', 'fancy', 'show', 'Representatives', 'lower', 'end', 'include', 'Bad', 'Eggs', 'Reptile', 'Boy', 'Killed', 'Death', 'Go', 'Fish.Notable', 'also', 'are', 'guest', 'appearance', 'John', 'Ritter', 'episode', 'Ted', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'guest', 'spots', 'series', 'creation', 'marvelous', 'villains', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'addition', 'always', 'likable', 'Seth', 'Green', 'breakout', 'acting', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Angel', '.The', 'Second', 'Season', 'arguably', 'best', 'season', 'series', 'agree', 'view', 'wonderfully', 'fun', 'plots', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'theme', 'love', 'what', 'other', 'show', 'can', 'intelligently', 'talk', 'seasons', 'having', '*themes*', 'ecstacy', 'madness', 'dangers', 'therein']",N/A
695048,A2QOQKEG2VTX48,B000063IOT,DONNA J. MILLER,"[4, 6]","If you thought that it couldn't get any better than the first season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, they you were 'dead' wrong. Now, with the show fully in motion and a hard core audience viewing, &quot;Buffy&quot; is for sure becoming a classic and great television show. Not to mention, this second season is the best season of &quot;Buffy&quot; over all- without a doubt. It builds on the relationships, has a great story once again, and has a perfectly assembled cast. Don't stop your collection with season one, be sure to get the 'Best of &quot;Buffy&quot;'- season two.First, the tangled web of relationships from season one gets even more tangled in this season. Season two starts out with the same love story- Willow (Alyson Hannigan) loves Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Xander loves Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Buffy loves Angel (David Boreanaz), Angel is a vampire. But as the story moves on, the characters begin to split and find other people to fall in love with. Willow, for one, falls in love with a socially strange guy named Oz (Seth Green), who is also a lead guitarist in a band titled &quot;Dingoes Ate My Baby&quot;. Besides that, Willow discovers that her first boyfriend is more than just a cool quiet guy, but he's also something dark underneith. Xander finds his first girlfriend to be the one person he truly does not like, the self-centered Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). As the two try to hide their feelings for each other, they are drawn out, and eventually, have to reaveal themselves to their friends, creating tension between Willow and Xander. Buffy lives her life dieing to be with Angel, and when the two finally do connect, serious and heartbreaking consequences occur. Meanwhile, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Jenny (Robia LaMorte) have a budding romance that also ends in tears. Also, the villains have a great relationship. They are the punk vampire Spike (James Marsters) and the insane vampire Dru (Juliet Landau). Their relationship also has challenges and makes the couple even more appealing and fun to watch knowing that they care for each other as Buffy cares for Angel. Without question, the relationships of this season could make a show in themselves, and add so much more to anticipate.Second, the story follows as a great work of art that only Joss Wheadon, the creator, could have thought of. Besides the disasterous soap opera going on within the relationships, the story arc for the season is just amazing. Spike and Dru are perfect villains, but when tradgedy strikes and Angel's soul is taken, he turns into the killer and monsterous vampire Angelus, who teams up with Spike and Dru to end the world in several ways. From battling the Master's last minions to fighting Angelus, from fighting a demon that steals the humanity from people to stopping a demon from sucking the world into hell, Buffy's second season is a perfect mix of grief, joy, chills, thrills, laughs, romance, sci-fi, and mythology.Finally, the cast is once again unbeatable. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Buffy with such emotion that truly deserves an award for all she puts into it. Alyson Hannigan steps up and makes Willow more interesting and complex from season one's dull Willow. Nicholas Brendan does a great job as some humer with Xander. Anthony Stewart Head is even better this time around as he gets to interact more with his slayer and begins to develope a fatherly relationship with her. David Boreanaz does a wonderful job changing from a good hero to an all out evil villain. James Marsters and Juliet Landau are a lovable yet hateful couple, which is exactly what they are meant to be. You just won't be able to get enough of them. Charisma Carpenter plays the loud mouthed Cordelia as a funny and likable girl, while Seth Green plays the quiet Oz as a mysterious and great guy. Kristine Sutherland once again plays Joyce, who gets even more screen time as Buffy's mother who just doesn't know what to do with her daughter. The guest stars are still great, and John Ritter tops it off as a step dad who's just a tad evil. Joss Wheadon created the best television show and his ideas are just so unpredictable and fun.To conclude, this is a great show with great relationships that could have an show on their own, a great story with pure heartbreak, and a great cast and crew that puts the show where it all is. Although it is just the beginning, it's still the best of the series. Season Two is a must for anyone who is even interested in buying this DVD, and be sure to continue your collection and complete it with all seven seasons of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot;",5,The Best Of Buffy,1086739200,"06 9, 2004",2004,4630,"['thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'quot', 'were', ""'dead"", 'wrong', 'Now', 'show', 'fully', 'motion', 'hard', 'core', 'audience', 'viewing', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'quot', 'sure', 'becoming', 'classic', 'great', 'television', 'show', 'Not', 'mention', 'second', 'season', 'best', 'season', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'quot', 'all-', 'doubt', 'relationships', 'great', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'perfectly', 'assembled', 'cast', 'Do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'collection', 'season', 'one', 'be', 'sure', 'get', ""'Best"", 'quot', 'Buffy', 'quot', ""'-"", 'season', 'two.First', 'tangled', 'web', 'relationships', 'season', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'tangled', 'season', 'Season', 'two', 'same', 'love', 'story-', 'Willow', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Xander', 'Nicholas', 'Brendan', 'Xander', 'Buffy', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Angel', 'vampire', 'story', 'moves', 'characters', 'begin', 'split', 'find', 'other', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'Willow', 'one', 'love', 'socially', 'strange', 'guy', 'named', 'Oz', 'Seth', 'Green', 'who', 'also', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'band', 'titled', 'quot', 'Dingoes', 'Ate', 'My', 'Baby', 'quot', 'Willow', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'more', 'just', 'cool', 'quiet', 'guy', 'also', 'something', 'dark', 'underneith', 'Xander', 'first', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'one', 'person', 'truly', 'not', 'like', 'self-centered', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'two', 'try', 'hide', 'feelings', 'other', 'are', 'drawn', 'out', 'eventually', 'have', 'reaveal', 'friends', 'creating', 'tension', 'Willow', 'Xander', 'Buffy', 'life', 'dieing', 'be', 'Angel', 'when', 'two', 'finally', 'do', 'connect', 'serious', 'heartbreaking', 'consequences', 'occur', 'Meanwhile', 'Giles', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'Jenny', 'Robia', 'LaMorte', 'have', 'budding', 'romance', 'also', 'tears', 'Also', 'villains', 'have', 'great', 'relationship', 'are', 'punk', 'vampire', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'insane', 'vampire', 'Dru', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'relationship', 'also', 'challenges', 'couple', 'even', 'more', 'appealing', 'fun', 'watch', 'knowing', 'care', 'other', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'question', 'relationships', 'season', 'could', 'make', 'show', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'anticipate.Second', 'story', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'only', 'Joss', 'Wheadon', 'creator', 'could', 'have', 'thought', 'disasterous', 'soap', 'opera', 'going', 'relationships', 'story', 'arc', 'season', 'just', 'amazing', 'Spike', 'Dru', 'are', 'perfect', 'villains', 'when', 'tradgedy', 'strikes', 'Angel', 'soul', 'taken', 'killer', 'monsterous', 'vampire', 'Angelus', 'who', 'up', 'Spike', 'Dru', 'end', 'world', 'several', 'ways', 'battling', 'Master', 'last', 'minions', 'fighting', 'Angelus', 'fighting', 'demon', 'humanity', 'people', 'stopping', 'demon', 'sucking', 'world', 'hell', 'Buffy', 'second', 'season', 'perfect', 'mix', 'grief', 'joy', 'chills', 'thrills', 'laughs', 'romance', 'sci-fi', 'mythology.Finally', 'cast', 'once', 'again', 'unbeatable', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Buffy', 'such', 'emotion', 'truly', 'award', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'up', 'Willow', 'more', 'interesting', 'complex', 'season', 'one', 'dull', 'Willow', 'Nicholas', 'Brendan', 'great', 'job', 'humer', 'Xander', 'Anthony', 'Stewart', 'Head', 'even', 'better', 'time', 'around', 'interact', 'more', 'slayer', 'develope', 'fatherly', 'relationship', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'wonderful', 'job', 'changing', 'good', 'hero', 'out', 'evil', 'villain', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'are', 'lovable', 'yet', 'hateful', 'couple', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'enough', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'Cordelia', 'funny', 'likable', 'girl', 'Seth', 'Green', 'quiet', 'Oz', 'mysterious', 'great', 'guy', 'Kristine', 'Sutherland', 'once', 'again', 'plays', 'Joyce', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Buffy', 'mother', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'daughter', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'John', 'Ritter', 'off', 'step', 'dad', 'who', 'just', 'tad', 'evil', 'Joss', 'Wheadon', 'created', 'best', 'television', 'show', 'ideas', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'unpredictable', 'fun.To', 'conclude', 'great', 'show', 'great', 'relationships', 'could', 'have', 'show', 'own', 'great', 'story', 'pure', 'heartbreak', 'great', 'cast', 'crew', 'show', 'where', 'just', 'beginning', 'still', 'best', 'series', 'Season', 'Two', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'interested', 'buying', 'DVD', 'be', 'sure', 'continue', 'collection', 'complete', 'seven', 'seasons', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer.', 'quot']",N/A

Joss Whedon had started to develop a kind of Lars Von Trier-esque attitude towards his main character, basically meaning that he was going to put Buffy through every hell imaginable and see how she would turn out.  This season centered on the relationship that brewed between B and Angel in the first season, it goes horribly awry and everything just collapses, in the worst possible way this season.  And the last episode is an unforgetable piece of TV that will always be a highmark for this show and the medium in general.  Spoilers aren't going to be in this review, suffice it to say, going in with no prior knowledge is the best possible way to experience this show, it continually subverts cliches and takes turns no one can predict, and basically just keeps you guessing and entertained while making you basically fall in love with the characters, in a TV sort of way.  Last thing, David Boreanaz surprised me a hell of a lot with his Angel performance in this season, it was just another in a long line of surprises this show serves up.  I like the DVD presentation, considering the lack of both budget and means, this show looks astoundingly good.  Even now, there is still this insane level of hesitation to like this show from my friends and siblings, they don't take it seriously, but I will make them damn it, and this season will help me.",4,Sickle cell anemia  (4 1/2 stars),1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,1918,"['was', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'glorious', 'ode', 'institution', 'was', 'part', 'came', 'out', 'Actually', 'not', 'ode', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'life', 'guess', ""'m"", 'babbling', 'Anyway', 'Buffy', 'had', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'watched', 'off', 'waited', 'second', 'season', 'see', 'improvement', 'was', 'horizon', 'Jaws', 'dropped', 'disbelief', 'was', 'order', 'day', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'truly', 'original', 'ridiculously', 'great', 'Only', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'done', 'did', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'happened', 'how', 'much', 'everyone', 'had', 'developed', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'had', 'started', 'develop', 'kind', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier-esque', 'attitude', 'main', 'character', 'basically', 'meaning', 'was', 'going', 'put', 'Buffy', 'hell', 'imaginable', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'season', 'centered', 'relationship', 'brewed', 'B', 'Angel', 'first', 'season', 'horribly', 'awry', 'everything', 'just', 'collapses', 'worst', 'possible', 'way', 'season', 'last', 'episode', 'unforgetable', 'piece', 'TV', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'highmark', 'show', 'medium', 'general', 'Spoilers', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'review', 'suffice', 'say', 'going', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'experience', 'show', 'continually', 'cliches', 'one', 'can', 'predict', 'basically', 'just', 'keeps', 'guessing', 'entertained', 'making', 'basically', 'fall', 'love', 'characters', 'TV', 'sort', 'way', 'Last', 'thing', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'surprised', 'hell', 'lot', 'Angel', 'performance', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'long', 'line', 'surprises', 'show', 'up', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'considering', 'lack', 'budget', 'show', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'Even', 'now', 'still', 'insane', 'level', 'hesitation', 'like', 'show', 'friends', 'siblings', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'will', 'make', 'damn', 'season', 'will', 'help']",N/A

695059,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B000063IOT,Garrett Aja,"[3, 4]","Just about everyone reviewing or looking at buying this DVD set knows about the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. As such, reviewing the episodes almost seems a bit redundant. (I, however, will go down that road anyways.) Simply put, all 22 episodes are either classics, or contain classic moments (such as Cordelia's thoughts on tact in ""Killed By Death"", or the reactions by Cordelia, Buffy, and Willow to Xander in a speedo [and nothing else] in ""Bad Eggs"") that almost singlehandedly save the so-called ""dud"" episodes of Season 2. Furthermore, some events (particularly Willow's magic use, Angel's loss of his soul, Cordy's brief flirtations with Angel, Spike's obsession with the Slayer, and the doomed-to-never-happen relationship between Willow and Xander) are still hot issues at the beginning of Buffy's 7th season (and Angel 4th).The DVDs are treated very well, with an attractive CGI graveyard and stylized menus that are a major improvement over the rather drab Season 1 menus. There's still the color and grain issues, but these are again because of the film stock used during the first two seasons.Though I haven't had a chance to listen to the various commentaries, they are of course very welcome, although even more (hopefully attended by more than just one ME staff member per episode) would be nice in the future. Basically, more is better. :)The packaging is also much nicer, in part because the godawful promo photos from before season 1 have been replaced by the nicer shots made specifically for Season 2 (duh). Also, the discs themselves feature images of Willow, Xander, and Spike(?!) instead of just Buffy, making for a bit more variety visually.Basically, if you have a DVD player and like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you're pretty much guaranteed to buy this set. Casual or hardcore fan, it probably won't matter, since most of the episodes are legendary. Newer viewers (or people curious about the series) may want to buy or rent the first season set simply for the need to understand some of the situations referred to (""Witch"" is mentioned at least twice, and ""Teacher's Pet"" is referenced many times). However, this is the set that will ""seal the deal"" so to speak with anyone unsure about the series. Although you'll definitely want to have a hanky, a friend to hug, and a good therapist around when you watch ""Becoming"", Part II. You'll probably need it.

695060,A1L3E4ZLRNKFNP,B000063IOT,Gary,"[0, 0]","'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' started as a midseason replacement on The WB in early 1997.  The lead actress, Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy Summers), was pitied by her friends and colleagues who told her 'You'll find a good job next year.'  No one expected Buffy to make it past its first episode, let alone the first season.  However, the show defied the overwhelming odds when it came back for it's second season in the fall of '97.The second season simply picked off where the first season left off.  However, the show became stronger with wittier dialogue, and better, more emotional storylines.  Once the characters seemed to be finding themselves and their places on the show, the viewers were easily able to identify with the characters and put themselves in their place.  The show wasn't just about supernatural demons.  This was a story about a core group of friends facing unbelievable odds much like teenagers do today.  The Buffy and Angel romance which was hinted at in Season One, continues much rapidly here.  It leads to one of the most popular storylines in 'Buffy' history.  Episodes such as 'Surprise,' 'Innocence,' 'Passion,' and 'Becoming Pts 1 &amp; 2,' all play significant story-altering arc episodes.  There are many great individual stand-alone episodes as well such as 'Bewitched, Bothered, &amp; Bewildered' in which Xander (Nicholas Brendon) performs a spell in order for Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) to fall in love with him but instead everyone BUT Cordelia falls for him, 'I Only Have Eyes For You,' in which two spirits possess the bodies of Buffy and Angel, and 'Phases' in which we see when OZ (Seth Green) first learn of his werewolf characteristics.The extras in this boxed set are more satisfying than those in the first season boxed-set.  There are three very-informative featurettes in which even if the biggest 'Buffy' fan may learn something new, Art galleries, episode scripts, interviews with creator Joss Whedon, and several episode commentaries.  Season two is known by legions of fans to be the ultimate Buffy season.  This show catapulted many of its stars careers.  Any true, loyal, Buffy fan must own this boxed set.

695061,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,B000063IOT,G. Garner,"[1, 2]","The greatest vampire in fiction was not created by Bram Stoker, or Anne Rice. He was the result of a collaboration between Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz. His name was Angelus.I know, many would give Whedon all the credit. But I rank it nearly 50/50. Whedon is a genius, without question. But Boreanaz brought a physicality, a sense of brutish menace, that the average actor could not convey. Angelus combined the malice of a school yard bully with the will of a god. He openly relished cruelty, for its own sake, and delighted in the fact that there was virtually noone powerful enough to oppose him, either physically or mentally.No other villain in the Buffyverse could equal Angelus, because all of the others had human weaknesses. Drusilla? Insane. Spike? Loved Drusilla. The Mayor and Faith? Shared a father-daughter connection. Even Glory admitted to harboring just sufficient humanity to go for the hurt rather than the easy kill, which ultimately cost her.But Angelus? His only true humanity arose from his hatred of Buffy. And, in the end, he was even willing to abandon this, for the sake of pursuing his greater agenda.His presense also made for, more than ever, a season of contrasts. Naturally, his unbridled malice set him sharply at odds with the warmth and charm of Buffy, or the mildly perplexed sweetness of Willow. Likewise with the stoic dedication of Giles, or the goofiness but utter loyalty of Xander. Oddly, though, he was almost equally at odds with his fellow villains. He harbored none of Spike's romanticism, and certainly none of Drusilla's frailty.He was a character like no other, in a season like no other. Never your typical crude tv evildoer, where every action is a means to an end. Never coarse, vulgar, or petty. Angelus was the real thing, a character for whom the actions WERE the reward. A character who regards the means AS the end.I think that Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest show of all time. I regard season two as its absolute zenith. This is due, in part, to the strength of Angelus, and the whole complexity of Buffy's feelings about him.(after all, how can she kill him when she still holds out hope that the 'real' Angel will somehow return?)This is her most fearsome adversary, and yet he is also the one she is most loath to defeat.But the Buffy/Angel dynamic is only one of a myriad of things that make this season so very special. Spike and Drusilla are an unforgettable pair. They are, by turns, funny, charming, and legitimately creepy. Buffy and her friends are the most likeable characters ever assembled in one place. The cast are all excellent. There is not a single weak link among the actors. Whedon is as brilliant of a mind as there is in television.However, if I had to select one thing that separates Season Two from everything else, it would be the way that the story arc draws the viewer in. This was true in each season of this show. But I never found it to be more the case than in the second year.By the time you get to What's My Line, Buffy and Angel are entrenched as a couple. They are perfect together, but they have harbored just ample friction to prevent their venturing over into Hart to Hart territory. Then, when the inevitable disaster does strike, it feels as if you are witnessing actual suffering, on a colossal scale.So many unforgettable moments. Again, you could say this about ANY season of Buffy. But Season Two is in a class  by itself.Giles, preparing for a romantic evening.......and coming home to discover the body of the woman he loves lying on his bed, her body having been arranged so that she greets him with the blank stare of death. Buffy, in a moment of ethereal beauty and peace, performing the ice skating solo. The harrowing spectacle of all those feral vampires descending like a pack of wolves on the school during parent-teacher night. Willow, in that Eskimo parka, with that forlorn look on her face that only Willow can get.Drusilla, in one of the show's most undeniably gothic moments, literally rising from the ashes after being healed of her illness. Xander standing up to Angelus, to prevent his entering Buffy's hospital room, although he is clearly(and justifiably) terrified of him. Spike, rising up out of that wheelchair, and then shattering it with all the force of his pent-up rage. Joyce, entertaining Spike in her living room.(this scene gives new meaning to awkward silence). Angelus, taking a moment to taunt Jenny Calendar over the shoddiness of gypsy craftmanship.......before breaking her neck.But most unforgettable of all, that moment, in Becoming part 1, where Buffy realizes that she has been lured away from the library on purpose........but coming to this realization much too late.There is a kind of effect that I have experienced, upon rare occasions, when the line between my reality, and the reality of the story, seems to diminish. With this series, there were times when it was eviscerated altogether. And Buffy Season Two has more of these moments than anything else I have experienced. It is not something that you passively watch. It is not something that you glance at to kill time.This is more like something that actually HAPPENS to you. I don't know of any better words to describe this show, and particularly this season. There is no greater achievement in the world of fiction......than to make you, even for a moment, forget that it IS fiction. Buffy Season Two transcends the bounds of typical storytelling, and certainly of typical television. This is all subjective, of course, but I have found nothing to equal the second season of Buffy.There is something that happens, upon occasion, with great storytelling. While the work is fictional, there is an intersection, of sorts, where the world of the story corresponds to something in the heart or mind of the viewer. A 'space', of sorts, is created, for lack of a better word. And, while I have had my differences with Joss Whedon, there is no denying that he created such a space with the Buffyverse, and especially with Season Two. It is a space of unremitting clarity-there is simply no mistaking it with anything else-and also of unparalleled beauty.When I try to conjure up words to convey the impression it holds for me, I am ultimately reminded of how I felt, as a child, gazing into our Christmas tree. That may sound fatuous, but it is the most accurate comparison I can make. Buffy engages the intellect, the emotions, and the imagination-but somehow transcends these things, so that the whole is far more than the sum of the parts. There is something undeniably magical about this show.",5,This One....Cannot Be Burned-He is Clean.......There is No Humanity in Him,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,6608,"['greatest', 'vampire',

From vacuous cheerleader to empowered but tragic heroine whose destiny is to sacrifice her own hopes and dreams in order to protect the world from the forces of darkness, `Buffy' has become the embodiment of wise-cracking 20th/21st century existential angst.The show`s humble beginnings as a belated spin-off from a mediocre movie starring Kirsty Swanson, belie its now revered status as one of the most brilliant TV series ever to have graced the schedules. The introduction of a sassy, short-skirted Californian airhead (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) with an endless stock of witty one liners, who kicks vampire a** was always going to be a winner, on reflection. Throw in a razor-sharp script, an excellent cast and lots of high-kicking action - after the first few vampires showcase their martial arts prowess, you forget to question where they learned their moves - and you're onto a winner.  However, the real strength of `Buffy' is the brilliance of the characters: Buffy's bookish `watcher' Giles (Anthony Stewart Head); Willow, the techno-geek (Alison Hannygan); the nerdish loser Xander (Nicholas Brendon); Cordelia, the acid-tongued, Prada-loving bimbo (Charisma Carpenter); and Angel, the brooding vampire with a soul (David Boreanaz), as well as the chosen one herself.Series 2 is where `Buffy' went major league. Lighter on the humour (though still boasting an impeccably sharp script), heavier on the angst, the main theme of the series becomes the doomed love between Buffy and Angel. With Spike and Drusilla, the hilarious `Mockney' vampires (Spike was pitched somewhere between David Bowie's goblin king from `Labyrinth', and Billy Idol), as the new big bad, and an unlikely romance between two of the scoobies, this is probably the best series of `Buffy' (though series 3 runs it mighty close). The two part `What's My Line', `Surprise', `Passion' and `Killed By Death' are all absolute classic episodes, but it is the awesome finale `Becoming' which elevates the series to near-epic status, and truly makes for some of the finest TV viewing ever. I won't give away too much in the way of plot, but suffice to say the show kicks on, and then some, from Series 1.It's not too late to get into `Buffy' if you feel it's passed you by. The good folks at Amazon can set you up with all 7 series now, and I would highly recommend a small financial investment (or better still, a hint to a loved-one for that special stocking filler!).

695068,ARI1LNCQQUM74,B000063IOT,Heather M. Dumdei,"[2, 3]","Season 2: the season of pain. So much pain that my friends and I have taken to referring to the last half of the season as simply ""The Pain.""This was the season when BUFFY really hooked me. I liked season 1. I kept watching when season 2 started, but I wasn't addicted until The Pain. At the time, I thought Angel was a big wanker, so his evil turn was exciting and refreshing. And I credit the makers for making me care even when I didn't want to by giving us ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" (beautifully written, directed and acted). Sarah Michelle Gellar's lovely performance makes Buffy's pain that much more poignant. So many of the actors finally get to explore their characters in season 2, and the show really starts going places. Willow starts experimenting with witchcraft, Giles shows his dangerous side, and we meet the infamous Spike and Drusilla. (Ah, Spike...thank GOD they didn't kill you off as originally planned.)And this DVD set definitely beats out season 1 in all categories. The features are so much better. The menus are a little more user friendly (if still lacking the nice ""Play All"" function that can sometimes come on tv show DVDs). There's more behind-the-scenes stuff. We even get to hear some commentary by both David Greenwalt and Marti Noxon, two of the more prominent early writers/producers on the show. The best, of course, is Joss Whedon's commentary on ""Innocence,"" the first episode where The Pain is in full-swing. As usual, it is only through the eyes of the creator that we get our most insightful looks into the Buffy-verse.So I definitely recommend this boxed-set to anyone, whether they be hardened fans, people who've only watched occassionally or newcomers to Sunnydale.

First, due to budget limitations, the whole season was filmed with a 16mm camera, so the image quality is not a good as it could have been.  Second, there are only 22 episodes.The whole season flows perfectly, from Buffy's return to Sunnydale after summer vacation in L.A. (still freaked out about dying in season 1), to her departure at season's end after destroying her whole life to save the world.  Season Two features what is still my favorite episode, ""Passion.""  While death comes suddenly and often to background characters in this series, they take it seriously when a main character is killed.  There are long term repercussions, and people don't recover from the emotional trauma of losing a loved one in just 1 week.  ""Passion"" was the first time we got to see how the Mutant Enemy production crew dealt with a major character's death, and it was quite powerful.

695071,A3RR5ARVCZMKPH,B000063IOT,Ian Krupnick,"[1, 4]","I very much enjoyed the first Season Volume of Buffy. Each episode (with the exception of the last one) was good lighthearted fun. The ending left me wanting to know what happened next. But wanting to know what happened next in a, whenever I get around to buying the next volume, kind of way, And frankly sometimes I need a little help getting motivated. Fortunately, while doing some grocery shopping I found the second season and like the first season grabbed it on an impulse. The first season got me interested; the second season got me hooked.The theme from the first season was all about starting out and getting a feel for things. I think the theme for this season is about love as every character falls into sort of a love triangle with each other. Fortunately towards the end each character kind of resolves his or her issues and finds true love with someone.The first episode shows that as a result of each characters experience in the previous season that each character now has grown a little darker. But that edge is suppressed a little as the first half of the season presents stories more akin in feeling to the tales if the past year. While little is moved forwards in terms of a story arc, a lot of these episodes are pure gold. Episodes with Spike are just great, The Halloween episode is phenomenal and an episode with John Ritter as a guest star had me giggling with pure glee.And then the second half of the season starts and everything gets ripped to shreds and then goes to hell very quickly. While earlier Buffy and Angel had time to establish a romance, after a night of passion some seriously dire consequences begin to affect all the characters. I think this is the first truly dramatic arc that really lets the audience know that bad things are going to happen to these characters and it's going to take more then one episode for them to get over it.The second season takes the groundwork laid down by the first and adds to it with the introduction a few more of the greatest characters and plottwists that will effect the entire series. It also continues the tradition by presenting some imaginative monsters and great witty dialog. But it's the heart breaking love story between Buffy and Angel that propels Buffy from a simple teen drama to one of my very favorite shows.",5,Once the ball starts rolling.......,1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,2302,"['very', 'much', 'first', 'Season', 'Volume', 'Buffy', 'episode', 'exception', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'lighthearted', 'fun', 'ending', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'whenever', 'get', 'buying', 'next', 'volume', 'kind', 'way', 'frankly', 'sometimes', 'need', 'little', 'help', 'getting', 'motivated', 'Fortunately', 'doing', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'found', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'grabbed', 'impulse', 'first', 'season', 'got', 'interested', 'second', 'season', 'got', 'hooked.The', 'theme', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'starting', 'out', 'getting', 'feel', 'things', 'think', 'theme', 'season', 'about', 'love', 'character', 'sort', 'love', 'triangle', 'other', 'Fortunately', 'end', 'character', 'kind', 'resolves', 'issues', 'true', 'love', 'someone.The', 'first', 'episode', 'result', 'characters', 'experience', 'previous', 'season', 'character', 'now', 'grown', 'little', 'darker', 'edge', 'suppressed', 'little', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'stories', 'more', 'akin', 'feeling', 'tales', 'past', 'year', 'little', 'moved', 'forwards', 'terms', 'story', 'arc', 'lot', 'episodes', 'are', 'pure', 'gold', 'Episodes', 'Spike', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'phenomenal', 'episode', 'John', 'Ritter', 'guest', 'star', 'had', 'giggling', 'pure', 'glee.And', 'then', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'everything', 'ripped', 'shreds', 'then', 'hell', 'very', 'quickly', 'earlier', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'had', 'time', 'establish', 'romance', 'night', 'passion', 'seriously', 'dire', 'consequences', 'begin', 'affect', 'characters', 'think', 'first', 'truly', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'really', 'audience', 'know', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'happen', 'characters', 'going', 'take', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'episode', 'get', 'it.The', 'second', 'season', 'groundwork', 'laid', 'down', 'first', 'introduction', 'few', 'more', 'greatest', 'characters', 'plottwists', 'will', 'effect', 'entire', 'series', 'also', 'tradition', 'presenting', 'imaginative', 'monsters', 'great', 'witty', 'dialog', 'heart', 'breaking', 'love', 'story', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'propels', 'Buffy', 'simple', 'teen', 'drama', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'shows']",N/A
695072,A1AIRJRJQCNU5L,B000063IOT,"jackbauerfan ""jack""","[3, 3]","And I really mean that.  This is by far my favorite season of Buffy.  This season opens up with a bang.  (This review will contain many spoilers).  The first episode, ""When she was bad"", is one of my favorite episodes in the whole series.  Buffy comes back from summer vacation acting very different.  She is very moody, and is acting very wild.  Her friends assume she is possessed by some sort of demon.  It turns out that she is just in a deep depression from her death at the end of the previous season.  The episode ""School Hard"" introduces Spike, the villain for the first half of the season, who is also one of the best fictional characters of all time as far as I'm concerned.  ""Halloween"" and ""Lie to me"" were two other great episodes, the first for its exceptional comedy, the second for its excellent drama.  The two-part episode ""What's my Line"" was not one of my favorite episodes, but a scene from it caused me to laugh out loud at this show for the first time, the scene where Xander and Cordelia start making out.  Their whole relationship was funny.  Some people didn't think it worked, but I thought it was great.  However, the downside of this episode is the character Kendra.  She was way too wooden, and her accent was horrible.  The two episodes ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"" chronicled Angel's loss of his soul and his return to being a vicious killer.  I have to say, Angelus is definitely my favorite villain in the whole series, possibly one of the best TV villains of all time.  In ""Becoming"", the two-part season finale, Buffy loses everything.  Her friend Kendra is murdered, she is wanted by the police for said murder, she is expelled from school, and her mother kicks her out of the house.  She has to stop Angel from awakening a demon that will swallow the world.  She sacrifices him to save the world, after his soul has been restored by Willow.  That scene almost brought me to tears.  And I'm a guy.  A macho guy.  And I knew he had his own spin-off series lined up, but still.  Buffy then leaves Sunnydale to get away from her calling as a slayer.This was a huge improvement over the first season.  If you read my review of season 1, you know I had some problems with it.  The acting, the effects and makeup, and the actions scenes were not very good.  They weren't horrible, but they weren't great either.  The acting is much better this time around.  Anthony Head is brilliant as usual, but Willow, Xander, and Angel's acting has improved a lot.  Even Buffy, who ironically is not one of my favorite characters, does a pretty good job.  The romance between her and Angel is pretty believable.  Contrast that with the relationship between Xander and Cordelaia.  Their relationship was funny and enjoyable to watch, but it was not very realistic.  Someone as superficial as Cordelia would never have publicly dated Xander.  But hey, it's a TV show, not real life.The action scenes are not very well-choreographed in the first few episodes, but they get better as the season progresses.  By the second half of the season, they are great.  The final fight between Buffy and Angelus (a sword fight) was very entertaining.  Everything about this season was almost perfect.  There were a few cheesy episodes, such as ""Some Assembly Required"", ""Inca Mummy Girl"", and ""Go Fish"", but, you know, nothing's without a few flaws.  Overall, this was a very good season.

My comments on the first season are still valid.  The series is still compelling and demands watching every episode.  My favorite has to be the last two episodes, particularly James as Spike.  I think he's an incredible actor, and it's fun to watch him be the bad guy.  You can tell he enjoys it.  That said, my criticisms from the first series also hold true.  The navigation is still poor in that the special features are not easily accessible.  Secondly, I was disappointed that there were again no cast interviews, though promotions for the set indicated there were.  However, it was great to see the TV commercials, particularly the ones from the UK (they got the entire series on video? ugh, why can't we be so lucky).  The behind the scenes stuff was also very interesting, and the animation on the episode selection menu was nice, though by the third disc it gets old.

It was lovely to have the main heroin have to fight her lover to the death after he becomes a homocidal monster.

Miller,"[56, 59]","With the features-packed DVD of ""Buffy"" Season 2 due to hit our mailboxes any month now, it's time for a look back at the episodes that arguably turned the show from closet-watching fascination to cult phenomenon.Season 2 was ""Buffy""'s first full-length run of 22 episodes, up from 12 the previous spring.  David Boreanaz (Angel) joined the cast full-time, and in his first episode, ""When She Was Bad"", it's clear that his feelings for Buffy have not gone away during the season hiatus.  The romantic tension between the leads is intense in the season premiere, with Buffy challenging Angel to a fight (which would come back to be very important later), and Xander and Willow nearly kissing.""School Hard"" introduced the season's recurring villains, Spike and Drusilla, the ""Sid and Nancy"" of the vampire world.  Spike hunts down Buffy through dark school characters, and Principal Snyder drops the first hint of the dark Sunnydale conspiracy of silence.""Inca Mummy Girl"" and ""Reptile Boy"" are two fun monster shows.  David Greenwalt, later the driving force behind the ""Angel"" show, will give audio commentary to the latter story, and this is anticipated to provide a great glimpse of how he's influenced both shows.""Halloween"", ""Lie To Me"", and ""The Dark Age"" explore the characters of Giles, Angel, Spike and Drusilla much more thoroughly, each showing scary glimpses of their dark pasts.  The first of these stories introduces the recurring warlock Ethan Rayne, an old ""friend"" of Giles.  The second features Jason Behr, who appeared in every WB teen series ever.""What's My Line?"", a two-parter, here with audio commentary by executive producer Marti Noxon (another huge cog in the ""Buffy"" wheel), introduces the notion of the ""second slayer"", sends the Buffy/Angel romance to a new level -- and features a surprising coupling between two other regulars.  It's the first of the season's three two-parters, and you'll be impressed to know that this is the weakest of the three.""Ted"" is notable for Special Guest Star John Ritter.  At the time, this bit of casting was seen as a triumph for the show, just getting attention in the national media.  He's a great psychopath, Jack Tripper-style.""Surprise""/""Innocence"" is the next two-parter, presented with Joss Whedons commentary.  ""Innocense"" moved ""Buffy"" from Monday nights to Tuesday, getting out of the ""Seventh Heaven"" shadow and anchoring its own night on the WB.  Buffy and Angel have their moment of true happiness; Xander and Cordelia give Willow a moment of true unhappiness, and suddenly Spike and Drusilla are no longer the only villains.  These two hours are among ""Buffy""'s greatest achievement.""Phases"" is a funny werewolf show, moving Seth Green's popular Oz into the inner-circle Scooby Gang.  ""Bewitched, Bothered and Wildered"" is Xander's comic Valentine's Day nightmare, with another appearance by Amy the teen witch.""Passion"" revels again in ""Buffy""'s ability to kill off regular characters.  Many BtVS fans name this their favorite episode of all time.The season ends with a final two-parter, ""Becoming"", and when part two aired, the four-month hiatus until Season 3 began, became unbearable.  These two hours show, via flashback, the origins of Drusilla, Angel, and Buffy.  The Buffy/Angel ""forbidden romance of all time"" comes to a shocking conclusion, and Spike comes to a sudden decision about his loyalties.  Pay special attention to his fight with Buffy at the beginning of Part Two.

This is the season where we meet Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau), Buffy and Angel consumate their relationship with dire consequences, Willow meets Oz (Seth Green), Xander and Cordelia begin a passionate affair, and Giles is, well, Giles. The very first ""Buffy"" episode I ever saw was ""School Hard"" (Spike and Drusilla's introduction). Lets just say, I ran out and bought the first season that DAY! ""School Hard"" was my introduction to the best television series ever. Yes, it was that good. But nothing could have prepared me for ""Surprise,"" ""Innocence,"" ""Passion,"" and ""Becoming (Parts I and II."" These are simply some of the finest hours in televsion I have ever seen! I must say, it is very hard to come up with a ""Best of..."" list for ""Buffy."" There are many contenders for the best ""Buffy"" episode, and many of my favorites are in Season Two. There are also three of the coolest villians ever in this season (Angelus, Drusilla and, of course, SPIKE!) While we are on the subject of greatness, lets talk about Sarah Michelle Gellar. Why she never won an Emmy for ""Buffy"" I'll never know. Take a look at the episode ""Innocence"" to see what I'm talking about. She BLEEDS with emotion, and its quite a feat of acting. Joss Whedon is a pure genius, and ""Buffy"" is a true testament to that. ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer "" is simply the finest television show I have ever seen.

695081,A1FXPZ5K1C1NBY,B000063IOT,Jeff Pearlman,"[1, 1]","Any other Buffy obsessives re-viewing Season Two this weekend?  Season Two (I have the ""non-slim"" version that unfolds dangerously to get to most discs) may have been the best ever.  The writing and quips are at their best here.  Expect to go from laughing out loud to jaw-dropping heartbreak within a scene or two.  And, of course, you get the first appearances of Spike and Dru(scilla)!  Seth Green's laconic and way-cool Oz!  As well as buxom new Slayer, Kendra (sexy Bianca Lawson).This season included one of television's all-time famous plot twists in the aftermath of Buffy and Angel's first...time together.  The scenes between Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz were spectacular all year long.  Sex has consequences, as series creator (""uber Boss"") Joss Whedon reminds us in a special commentary feature.  If only it was something ""simple"" like a pregnancy...instead, the result was lethally bad news for several Sunnydale residents, including a key supporting player.  Actually a Joss comment that always bothered me was his semi-threat, semi-boast(?) about his power to fire (kill) the cast members off at any time.  Carried out a bit too often.  But David's incredible acting earned him a spin-off and gave us five more seasons of this amazing fantasy world to savor into our collective dotage.The 2-part episode ""Becoming"" introduces the never-before-seen, oddly never-seen-again Whistler character and shows the sirings of Angel (by Darla) and Dru (by Angel).  And another heartbreaking ending that causes Buffy to head into Season Three, as she did Season Two, alienated and mopey.  Quite Goth, really.I am now enjoying Joyce meeting Spike.  This time in her living room, sans axe.Etc:  The great, and still-lamented, John Ritter emerges as a rare celebrity guest star in ""Ted.""  We also have Buffy telling Joyce her big secret (it goes not well), Willow's first forays into witchcraft, Xander/Cordy fireworks, and constant lurking from Principal Snyder.Inconsistencies:  several things would/should have triggered memories of the upcoming ""flashback"" episode when Buffy was institutionalized.  Spike calls Angel his ""sire"", which is actually wrong.  (I think he's a ""grandsire."")  Spike seems unaware that Angel and Dru were lovers before, which I believe was the subject of a big flashback scene later in ""Angel.""  Finally, Snyder knows about the hellmouth but his raison d'etre is never clarified (for me)...maybe when I re-re-watch Season Three.  And, since I'm STILL in denial about sweet Willow, note how boy-crazy she is all year.  Was it the Black Arts that made her lose interest in me...men!  I meant to say men.My biggest problem (with BTVS), and maybe it's mine alone, is the difficulty watching...over time, the loss of so many supporting Scoobies.  This year, two are killed.  One undeniably helped the plot.  The other, well, led to the creation of Faith, which to me is the very essence of ""silver lining"".  But by the end of ""Angel"", we lost so many friends...too much bitter for my sweet.  Anyway, don't let my little gripes distract.  This and Season Three are the best ever.  You must own them.",5,"Essential.

All 22 episodes in full-screen, quality, surround sound viewiing! This is what makes Buffy the best show on television today. I won't leave a review on each episode. This DVD is so much better than the 1st season, not that I don't love the first season. When you first put one of the six discs in your DVD player, the Buffy logo comes up, and then you are led into a menu introduction. You are taken through a 3D Sunnydale with the cemetary, statues, gargoyles, and fences. It looks really cool! The menus are set up fantastic too! They are very organized. What impressed me the most was the three 20 minute long featurettes which show you how Buffy is made & how much hard work and creativity go into each and every episode. You also get 4 Art Galleries: screen stills, set blueprints, set pictures, and a monster gallery. They are all great pictures! And the TV spots and trailer are amazing too, a really cool special feature. And the cast/character biographies are great as usual also. The episodes on here that are my favorites are ""When She Was Bad"" (the season opener that was very emotional and very great season premiere), ""Ted"" (because it is so evil and it deals with real life issues), ""Bad Eggs"" (one of my favorite standard episodes), ""Suprise"" and ""Innocence"" (because of the tragic occurance of Angel losing his soul because he experienced happiness, very sad), and of course the the two part season finale: ""Becoming Part One"" and ""Becoming Part Two"", in which is definetly this season's and possibly the show's greatest episodes ever. Buffy has to make a tragic sacrifice in order to save the world. I won't tell you the end in case you somehow haven't seen it, but this is what television was made for! Collect the Buffy seasons, because television never got better! All 22 of these episodes are classics. Season 2 will make you laugh, cry, smile, and hate. It's all here: drama, comedy...

Great stuff.However, I will agree somewhat with the folks who complain about the picture quality. However, they must consider that (I believe) the first few episodes of this season were still shot on 16mm.What I do have a very strong complaint about is the lack of printed notes on this (and the first) edition. Nowhere in the booklet are we told which episodes have special features such as commentary or interviews. Also, there is a lack of episode titles on the discs themselves. With the first season package, this was minor with 3 discs. However, with 6 discs in the flip out package (a very pretty product in itself, but...) they have provided, this becomes unwieldy, as one must unfold the entire package to access both the booklet and the first discs.

Storylines start to evolve along with the standalone episodes, and are edited just right so I can still understand them. The comedy aspect of this show fits right in without neutralizing the horror. There are moments in this show that are pure psychological terror. Its just as supernatural as ""The X-files."" Season 2 has an emotional feel that isn't quite matched in other seasons. I think its like the moon aligning and all the elements that made up the show are here. Of course its cheesy, but its also great. Episodes like Inca Mummy Girl, Halloween, Whats my Line 1 &2, and Ted all cascade into a cool finale. While Season 3 is heavier on drama, new characters, and some of the horror that was in season 2, it just can't touch how actually scary and fun Season 2 was.

Yet i believe this is the best season yet, any Buffy fan would have to agree.The 22 episodes in this collection are ""When She was Bad"" is where Buffy comes back from her summer vacation with a new attitude and having bad dreams, ""Some Assembly Required"" has grave robbery involving a science club member who wants to play Re-Animator as he brings to life a freshly dead female corpse whom can be a girlfriend for his brother until there are some consquences. ""School Hard"" has a parent-teacher converence gone haywire no thanks to some vampires and Spike of course, next is ""Inca Mummy Girl"" where a ancient Inca princess mummy is brought back to life, ""Reptile Boy"" has Buffy with Cordelia invited to a party only to wind up as sacrifices to a lizard-esque beast. ""Halloween"" has everyone in their halloween costumes literally becoming their costumes after a magic spell, ""Lie to Me"" has Buffy tricked by a gang who want to be vampires if they can join Spike's people, ""The Dark Age"" has Gile's past haunting him as a demon comes back to kill him. "" What's My Line parts 1 & 2"" has Buffy joining forces with another vampire slayer named Kendra whom will save Angel from Spike and Drusilla, ""Ted"" is about Buffy's mom rancing a computer salesman who turns out to have a secret, ""Bad Eggs"" has ancient eggs that belong to a prehistoric monster that makes people into zombies.""Suprise"" has Buffy celebrating her 16th birthday as she with Angel must stop Angel and Drusilla from unleashing a powerful demon called The Judge, ""Innocence"" has Buffy and Angel battling the Judge as Angel finds a moment of true happiness. ""Phases"" has Buffy with her buddies discovering secrets on themselves to fight a werewolf and it's hunter, ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" has Cordelia breaking up with Xander on Valentine's Day and a witch makes a special love spell on Cordellia so he can break up with her but not for long. ""Passion"" deals with Angel stepping his tormet of Buffy and pals even as Jenny Calander must find a way to restore his soul or else it's too late, then ""Killed by Death"" has Buffy in the hospital sick with the flu but still strong enough to fight a monster that sucks the energy out of sick children. ""I only have Eyes for you"" has Sunnydale High School haunted by a former teacher and student who create terror and their romance through the student bodies, ""Go Fish"" has Xander discovering that some of the swim team are an ancient race of Mer-creatures in human disguise, and finally ""Becoming part 1 & 2"" has Kendra returning to help Buffy and pals when Angel wants to resurrect a powerful demon to make hell on Earth.This boxset has some great episodes especially my personal faves ""Halloween"", ""Bewitched, bothered and Bewildred"" and ""Some Assembly Required"".

Introduces the ""other Slayer,"" Kendra.""Ted"" - John Ritter plays the stepfather from hell to Buffy.""Surprise/Innocence"" (2 parts) - The seminal episode in which Buffy turns seventeen and Angel turns bad.""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" - One of the best comic episodes of the show, featuring Buffy's friend Xander.""Phases"" - A werewolf is attacking teens, and apparently Oz has something to do with it...""Passion"" - The Angelus matter comes to a head when he starts going after Buffy's friends.""Becoming"" (2 parts) - The tearjerker season finale, in which Angelus is determined to send the world to hell and it's up to Buffy and her motley Scooby gang to stop it.This boxed set also includes a boatload of extras, including interviews with actors and with the creator of the show, Joss Whedon.

Let's talk Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendon, ect. You want to talk a critically acclaimed, underrated, brilliant television show with enough wit and guts to outplay any other horror dramedy every thought of? Let's talk Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Especially the highly praisable second season in which every future storyline for the show was set, and the relationships of the characters were set in complete line. Thumbs up and kudos to Joss Whedon and crew for coming up with the most interesting and heartfelt storylines for the show. There were so many twists and turns in the 22 episode season to fill up a dozen movies. Not to mention the many moments when you had to either fight back the tears or just let them flow. It was also neat to see the many references to classic movie monsters during this season. There's even one baddy and his storyline that resembles that of Freddy Krueger and the Nightmare on Elm Street series, and I must say that that one episode (Killed by Death) is one of the creepiest Buffy episodes ever, after the all-silent Hush. This season could not have been so awesome if it weren't for the superb cast. All the cast shined here, but big credit has to be given to the four main players. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendon, and Anthony Stewart Head. Their portrayal of friendship and loyalty is the best I've ever seen by a TV group of friends in a drama. In my utmost opinion, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best television show ever composed. And I'm very thankful for having the second season on DVD.The DVD collection itself is a must-have. All 22 episodes are here. There is one problem I have with it, although it was expected. The picture of certain segments of some episodes turned out to be very grainy and almost hard to watch, but with the type film they shot this season on, it would be hard to have an almost perfect transfer. Although I wish FOX would have tried harder to clear it up. There are four commentaries to four different episodes here, with Joss Whedon's commentary for Innocence being the most entertaining. Three featurettes on set design, the villains, and costumes are also here and are sure entertainment and give full insight. Also available are interesting trailers, scripts for certain episodes, and an extensive photo gallery. The menus are very innovative too. Very neat.The second season DVD collection is certainly a high step up from the first season.

James Marster's Spike character was only supposed to be around for one or two episodes and then die, but he became an immediate hit so they left him on the series, hence the writers going back to correct the flub. You gotta love Josh for letting the mistake stand, he could have re edited the scene or did a voice over, but he left it just the way it was, worts and all. Get season 2, its classic, and to me, marked its territory as hands down the best show on TV, despite the emmy nominating committees suggesting otherwise.Season 2, Episode 1: When She Was BadOriginal Air Date--15 September 1997Buffy returns from her summer vacation after defeating the Master and is not the same fun-loving slayer she used to be.

It has a lot of greatest episodes and a powerful Big Bad(s) comparing to that loser ""The Master"". Spike, Drusilla and Angelus are great additions to the show. And also, with this season emotional drama also begins. There are new romances on the way. It has vital and great episodes like, School Hard, Halloween, Innocence(my favorite from this season), Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, Passion, Becoming Parts 1&2.

695099,AUD3OVKGE7QRO,B000063IOT,"Kerry A. Walsh ""lilgracie346""","[3, 3]","Season 2 is one of the best seasons of Buffy not only because of the Buffy-Angel romance (which, I would imagine, is what draws most of this season's interest), but also because of Joss Whedon's examination of the nature of good and evil during this season.  The arrival of Spike (at this point, the antithesis of Angel) to Sunnydale signals the arrival of the &quot;big bad&quot;.  While Spike and Drusilla plot the elimination of the entire world, Buffy has no clue that the biggest bad is right beside her... in Angel.Outside of the obligatory running vampire arc, the other episodes this season all really deal with the nature of good and evil and identity, shadowing the arc with the vampires.  The Halloween episode (where the characters become their costumes) is nothing short of hillarious with Buffy prancing around as a helpless ladylike debutante.  Its interesting to see what each character would be like if just one thing about them was changed - if Buffy didn't have strength, if Xander was confident and &quot;manly,&quot; etc.  Another interesting episode is the Dark Age when the consequences of Giles' past come back to haunt him... and those he loves.  Hillarious and harrowing is Ted, the episode with guest star John Ritter as Joyce's boyfriend/robot serial killer.  The most interesting part of the episode is the few minutes when both Buffy and Joyce think that Buffy has killed Ted and how they handle it.Finally, of course, is Buffy's now consumated romance with Angel which ultimately causes him to lose his soul and become his former murderous self.  The pain that Buffy goes through is intense and many girls can relate to it at a romantic level.  When Buffy is ultimately forced to kill Angel (with his soul returned to him), both Buffy and the audience is grief-striken.The season works well as a whole - possibly the best of all the seasons.  Each episode, though whole onto itself, moves the characters and stories toward the ultimate goal of examining the good and evil in each of them and what each of their identities entail.",5,One of the best seasons,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,2060,"['Season', '2', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'not', 'only', 'Buffy-Angel', 'romance', 'would', 'imagine', 'what', 'most', 'season', 'interest', 'also', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'examination', 'nature', 'good', 'evil', 'season', 'arrival', 'Spike', 'point', 'antithesis', 'Angel', 'Sunnydale', 'signals', 'arrival', 'quot', 'big', 'bad', 'quot', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'plot', 'elimination', 'entire', 'world', 'Buffy', 'clue', 'biggest', 'bad', 'right', 'Angel.Outside', 'obligatory', 'running', 'vampire', 'arc', 'other', 'episodes', 'season', 'really', 'deal', 'nature', 'good', 'evil', 'identity', 'shadowing', 'arc', 'vampires', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'where', 'characters', 'become', 'costumes', 'nothing', 'short', 'hillarious', 'Buffy', 'prancing', 'around', 'helpless', 'ladylike', 'debutante', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'changed', 'Buffy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'strength', 'Xander', 'was', 'confident', 'quot', 'manly', 'quot', 'etc', 'interesting', 'episode', 'Dark', 'Age', 'when', 'consequences', 'Giles', 'past', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'Hillarious', 'harrowing', 'Ted', 'episode', 'guest', 'star', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Joyce', 'boyfriend/robot', 'serial', 'killer', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'episode', 'few', 'minutes', 'when', 'Buffy', 'Joyce', 'think', 'Buffy', 'killed', 'Ted', 'how', 'handle', 'it.Finally', 'course', 'Buffy', 'now', 'consumated', 'romance', 'Angel', 'ultimately', 'lose', 'soul', 'become', 'former', 'murderous', 'self', 'pain', 'Buffy', 'intense', 'many', 'girls', 'can', 'relate', 'romantic', 'level', 'When', 'Buffy', 'ultimately', 'forced', 'kill', 'Angel', 'soul', 'returned', 'Buffy', 'audience', 'grief-striken.The', 'season', 'well', 'whole', 'possibly', 'best', 'seasons', 'episode', 'whole', 'characters', 'stories', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'examining', 'good', 'evil', 'what', 'identities', 'entail']",N/A

Now, I imagine everyone and their uncle has already seen Season Two by now, but if not, be aware there are some spoilers in my review (because I am assuming everyone had seen Season Two by now).  But if not - you have been warned.There is a lot of dissent in Season Two, beginning when Buffy returns from her summer with her father distant, moody and downright Cordelia-esque.  It turns out she hasn't quite gotten over the fact that the Master killed her.  No sooner does she get that out of her system, then our favorite bad boy and girl arrive on the scene - Spike and Drusilla.  Who will ever forget that terrific scene - that awesome car that Spike drives screeching into town, running down the ""Welcome to Sunnydale"" sign, the door popping open, the boot stepping out, the awesome leather duster, pan up to the blond hair, lighting the cigarette, pan to the face - Spike in vamp face - take a drag on the butt - ""Home sweet home"" fade to black.  Beautiful!  There are lots of wonderful scenes with Spike this season - some of the best are right at the end of the season when he has to team up with Buffy ""OK, just let me kill this guy . . ""  Buffy: ""Ahem""  Spike: ""Oh, right . . ""  Not to mention the precious scene with Spike and Joyce in the living room, both of them sitting there, all uncomfortable, when Joyce turns to Spike and says ""You know, you look familiar, have I met you before?"" to which Spike replies, all nonchalantly ""Oh, you hit me with an axe once, you know, 'stay the hell away from my daughter'""  To which Joyce just says  ""oh, right""Then there is Kendra, the vampire slayer ""check out the mini-Giles"" - the Judge ""you get the people to safety, I'll take care of the Smurf"" - and Angelus making an appearance.  Oh, and we can never, ever forget Xander's betrayal of everything by not telling Buffy that Willow was trying the curse again, so that Buffy is forced to kill Angel after his soul is returned to him, sending him to hell and her out of town to try to forget about it.Basically in Season Two Buffy has to grow up really fast and as I mentioned in the first paragraph she refuses to let anyone else in to try to help her.  This is what ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is all about, at the core of it - one girl, in all the world - facing down the demons and monsters, alone - even if those demons and monsters are her own internal ones.",5,What about love?,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,2659,"['second', 'season', 'Buffy', 'begin', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'theme', 'Buffyverse', 'first', 'love', 'affair', 'will', 'be', 'allowed', 'be', 'happy', 'second', 'matter', 'how', 'close', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'allow', 'one', 'other', 'lives', 'when', 'Now', 'imagine', 'everyone', 'uncle', 'already', 'seen', 'Season', 'Two', 'now', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'are', 'spoilers', 'review', 'am', 'assuming', 'everyone', 'had', 'seen', 'Season', 'Two', 'now', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'dissent', 'Season', 'Two', 'beginning', 'when', 'Buffy', 'summer', 'father', 'distant', 'moody', 'downright', 'Cordelia-esque', 'out', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gotten', 'over', 'fact', 'Master', 'killed', 'sooner', 'get', 'out', 'system', 'then', 'favorite', 'bad', 'boy', 'girl', 'arrive', 'scene', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'Who', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', 'terrific', 'scene', 'awesome', 'car', 'Spike', 'screeching', 'town', 'running', 'down', 'Welcome', 'Sunnydale', 'sign', 'door', 'popping', 'open', 'boot', 'stepping', 'out', 'awesome', 'leather', 'duster', 'pan', 'up', 'blond', 'hair', 'lighting', 'cigarette', 'pan', 'face', 'Spike', 'vamp', 'face', 'take', 'drag', 'butt', 'Home', 'sweet', 'home', 'fade', 'black', 'Beautiful', 'are', 'lots', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Spike', 'season', 'best', 'are', 'right', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'team', 'up', 'Buffy', 'OK', 'just', 'let', 'kill', 'guy', 'Buffy', 'Ahem', 'Spike', 'Oh', 'right', 'Not', 'mention', 'precious', 'scene', 'Spike', 'Joyce', 'living', 'room', 'sitting', 'there', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'Joyce', 'Spike', 'know', 'look', 'familiar', 'have', 'met', 'Spike', 'replies', 'nonchalantly', 'Oh', 'hit', 'axe', 'once', 'know', 'hell', 'away', 'daughter', 'Joyce', 'just', 'oh', 'right', 'Then', 'Kendra', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'check', 'out', 'mini-Giles', 'Judge', 'get', 'people', 'safety', ""'ll"", 'take', 'care', 'Smurf', 'Angelus', 'making', 'appearance', 'Oh', 'can', 'never', 'ever', 'forget', 'Xander', 'betrayal', 'everything', 'not', 'telling', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'was', 'trying', 'curse', 'again', 'Buffy', 'forced', 'kill', 'Angel', 'soul', 'returned', 'sending', 'hell', 'town', 'try', 'forget', 'it.Basically', 'Season', 'Two', 'Buffy', 'grow', 'up', 'really', 'fast', 'mentioned', 'first', 'paragraph', 'let', 'anyone', 'else', 'try', 'help', 'what', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'core', 'one', 'girl', 'world', 'facing', 'down', 'demons', 'monsters', 'alone', 'even', 'demons', 'monsters', 'are', 'own', 'internal', 'ones']",N/A
695103,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000063IOT,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[146, 152]","I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as scaling operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of ""Becoming, Part 2,"" which I still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my life.  I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I can make a pretty convincing case.  We witnesses the potential of this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way through the abbreviated first season.  In Season 2, we find out just how far true love can go wrong.Love continues to be a very painful thing for the Scooby Gang, as Cordelia (""Some Assembly Required""), Xander (""Inca Mummy Girl"") and Joyce (""Ted""), find out.  Then again, prospects look much better for Willow (""Phases""), although we never really do take the Cordelia-Xander romance (""Go Fish"") to be anything more than a cosmic joke, which does offer up the delightfully twisted ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" as the exception that proves the rule (footnote: Buffy spends most of the episode as the Buffy rat because Sarah Michelle Gellar was hosting SNL that week).  Of the off-arc stories, ""Halloween"" and ""Ted"" are clearly the best of the bunch.  But when it comes to romance, Buffy and Angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions.It is clear in the season premier episode, ""When She Was Bad,"" that things are different.  When Buffy dances seductively with Xander, taunting him with her sexuality, the ante has been upped considerably.  The pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 (of 22), ""Surprise,"" when Buffy unknowingly undoes Angel's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him.  Why the gypsies put in the Faustian (in the Goethe sense) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable, but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive.  When Angelus brutally slays Jenny Calendar in ""Passion,"" leaving her body in a grotesque display for Giles to discover in his bed (while opera music soars in the background), it is the symbolic Hellmouth of the show opening up.  The audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get, only the worst is yet to come.  Giles's anger buys him one shot at Angelus, but Buffy has to rescue him.  They turn on each other in anger, and Buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other's arms.  Buffy tells him, ""I can't do this alone,"" but this proves to be most ironically incorrect.Clearly Whedon constructs each season around two half-season story arcs.  The first half of Season 2 heralds the arrival of Spike and Dru, and the quick departure of ""The Annoying One.""  Of course now we look back and are amazed at what James Marsters has done with the role of Spike, but at this point it is Juliet Landau's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side.  Whedon brings the first half to a climax in ""What's My Line?,"" the show's first two-parter, where we are introduced to Kendra the Vampire Slayer.  It seems Buffy's brief moment of death at the hands of the Master in ""Prophecy Girl"" has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point.  But with the return of Angelus everything changes.  Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble the Judge, a grotesque who cannot be killed ""by any weapon forged.""  Then everybody learns the truth about not only Angel's transformation but also Jenny's betrayal.  Thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between Angel and his former allies, which culminates in the two parts of ""Becoming.""Both parts of ""Becoming"" are written and directed by Whedon, and represent the apex of his work on the series.  When Angeleus opens the portal to Hell, only his blood can close it, but things are not going to be that easy for Buffy.  The dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting Sarah McLachlan song ""Full of Grace"" is played. Joss Whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series. It is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season. ""Becoming"" is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up.The original theatrical film was a teaser, the first season on television was an appetizer, but the second season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was epic and once you see this, whether again or for the first time, you are not going to want to stop here.  It is especially nice to see that the extras have gone up a couple of notches for the Season 2 DVD collection which is clearly priced to be accessible to BtVS's loyal fans.  Yes, we all appreciated having the entire first season, just like our Buffy brethren across the sea, but certainly we expected more goodies from Whedon and crew, especially given the high quality of ""The Watchers Guide,"" the show's official companion volumes.  Clearly there is a lot of thought put into this show, which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated.",5,"The operatic second season of ""Buffy the Vampire

695104,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B000063IOT,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[0, 1]","Buffy The Vampire Slayer stepped up in Season 2. It started off with a Season Premiere in which Buffy dealt with any remaining anger and hurt she had about what happened between her and the Master in the Season 1 Finale. However the real feelings that became really important were those that were involved in her loving Angel. The very heart of Buffy The Vampire Slayer came to fruition midway through Season 2. You see, in Season 1 we've already established that Angel was cursed with a soul by gypsies. However we learn that if Angel was to ever experience true happiness he would lose his soul and become an evil vampire. Unfortunately this little clause isn't discovered until Angel has made love to Buffy and is evil again. Throughout the second half of Season 2 Angel is trying to torment Buffy and her friends. He even kills a teacher who Giles (Buffy's Watcher)was close to. All of this builds up to the part that is sure to bring a tear to your eye in which Buffy says ""Close your eyes"" to Angel before finally having to kill him.

695111,AGN8YYJ6BHBEU,B000063IOT,"Lucifer ""Superman isn't brave he is invulnerable""","[2, 3]","This is the season that made me love the show. This is the season that has the most impact of any season in the show's history. Spike, Angel, and Dru need I say more?Well I am going to anyway. The turn of Angel was gutsy and needed. The avoidance of the after sex cliche was perfect. Angel loses his soul and David proves that he is a great villian. IMHO Angelus is perfect and should supplant Angel for good. Devilishly devious and the most effective villian against Buffy. His interaction with Spike and Dru is well done and gives Spike the first inkling of sympathy.The season is well crafted into two parts. B.A.(Before Angelus) and A.A.(After Angelus). The intro of Spike ep. 3 B.A. is a highlight of the entire series. Right off the bat he steals every scene he is in and is downright hilarious. His removal of the kid was much appreciated and he immediately became my favorite character. B.A. the show lacked direction since the main villian was Spike and he had no greater purpose or direction. He was the Gen-X villian it would seem. The shows were entertaining but really were just pure fun. Then came Surprise/Innocence and the show moved to A.A.Angel was the champion guy that made all the hopelessly romantic girls swoon. Now they watched in horror as he ripped Buffy's lovemaking skills and happily blew her off. This is the point that the show first proved that it had courage. A main character is offed by Angelus further cementing his villany. He and Spike clash as alpha males often do and history is made.The last episode is poetry with Buffy and Angelus fighting it out over the safety of the world. I won't ruin it for those that haven't seen it.

Since I case a bit late to Joss Whedon's delightful invention, I have known the shows of this season mostly from the novelizations and way too few reruns.  The novelizations are okay as that kind of thing goes, but nothing beats watching the shows themselves, right there in living color.The first season was wonderful, but the second has turned up the quality by several notches.  The actors are in full stride, the sets are in great form, and the writing is outstanding.  Season two develops the major plot arcs, all of which turn on relationships instead of just dwelling on monster slaying.  Buffy's relationship with Angel plays out to its tragic ending, Xander and Cordelia discover broom closets, and Willow discovers Oz.  The romance between Jenny Calendar and Giles blooms and dies horribly.  Nor should we forget the unholy m&eacute;nage a trois formed by Angel, Spike and Drusilla.What makes BTVS more than a one-half season wonder is that it is about people trying to live normal, happy lives, and having to face all the challenges that entails, intensified by the everyday chaos introduced by life on a hell mouth.  This is not a happy ending series, but one that brings home many of the painful experiences of growing up slightly (or perhaps majorly) different.  Sometimes killing vampires is the comic relief.Also notable are the strong positive values of the Scooby gang and their supporting casts.  The strongest thread that runs through these shows is not the violence, but the abiding friendships between Buffy, Xander and Willow.  As will become more and more evident, Buffy's remarkable ability to survive and her longevity as a slayer depend not on speed with a stake, but in the support that is always available to her.  This is a lesson we all need to learn, and Buffy will face every variation of it in the seasons to come.Naturally, DVD sets are judged by their extras, and of these, there is no lack.  Multiple Joss Whedon interviews throughout, as well as  in depth commentaries by Whedon, Marti Noxon, and David Greewalt.  Whedon on &quot;Surprise&quot; is absolutely superb.  And several features on design, monsters and make-up fill out the set.  Such is the stuff of happiness.  Of course, greater happiness will come when Fox finally releases seasons three, four, and five in the United States.

695116,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B000063IOT,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[0, 3]","I must admit, I was not a HUGE fan of the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. To me the story was weak and a little too corky. However, the second season more than makes up for all that. This season Buffy and her friends face challanges that were shocking and extremely fun to watch.At the Beginning of the season, Buffy returns to Sunnydale after spending the summer with her father in LA. She returns a changed woman after dying at the end of the first season. Buffy and her friends quickly find out that there are two new villans in town, Spike and Drusilla. These two are one of the reasons this season is so great. Drusilla is absolutely insane and a trip to watch, and Spike is pretty funny this season, but not nearly as funny as his later appearences.Buffy and the gang fight Spike and Dru for the first part of season two. During that time the Buffy/Angel love story really takes off. It was very nice this season to see how well the functioned as a couple, at least for a time. Mid-way through the season, Angel becomes the most deliciously evil character of the series. With his turn to the darkside it makes it quite interesting to see how Buffy delt with having to fight the man she loves. The season ends with a amazing finale that would bring just about anyone to tears. With Angel and Buffy having one final battle.I would say the most engaging part of this season is the unexpected plot twists. They are ALL OVER THE PLACE!

695119,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B000063IOT,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[15, 16]","I remember when I was a kid, a local movie reviewer here in DC gave ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" five stars. This was a big deal because in his entire history of reviewing films, four stars had always been his highest rating. He justified it simply by saying, ""(Raiders) is the perfect example of why we go to the movies in the first place.""I broke my own rule and gave Season Two five stars, because Buffy as a whole is a perfect example of what TV can do when it is done right, and Season Two is a perfect example of a great show at the highest peak of its energy, creativity, and enthusiasm. Now, before you roll your eyes, I know I pulled a Milhouse in my review of Season One and got a wee bit overstimulated, wearing out the thesaurus with words of praise and sounding like a love-struck geek on too much Adderol, so I promise to be more restrained here and limit myself to a story you Buffy-heads will probably find amusing.A year ago I moved back to DC from Pennyslvania, and for about 6 months lived with my mom while I looked for an apartment and fumbled around with my new job. During this tough settling-in period, which coincided with the DC area Sniper shooting people every day right on my doorstep, and boy wasn't that a fun time to work in Rockville, MD, I started watching back-to-back Buffy episodes on FX. I had been only a very casual watcher of the show prior to this, but quickly got hooked. Of course, as I lay on the couch in my shirt and tie, drinking beer and eating Triscuits, my 62 year-old Mom (who is in Seminary) would inevitably walk through the living room, roll her eyes, and say, ""What are you doing watching this CHILDREN'S PROGRAM?"" (Remember when your parents told you as long as you were under their roof, you were still a child to them? This rule still applies at the age of 30). For weeks I silently endured this abuse, which was worst when she happened to be in the room reading about Nietsche's ""World Spirit"" or Schopenauer's ""Die Welt als Wille Und Vorstellung"". Many sneers were directed at the appearance of Buffy's bra-strap, or Cordelia's little cheerleading skirt, or the Master's Kool-Aid mouth and WWI flying ace leather jacket. Gradually the criticism faded. And then, one day, out of the blue, I heard: ""Hey....why is Buffy kissing that vampire?""That was around Halloween. By Thanksgiving day, she would not leave the house to go to dinner until I assured her that a tape was in the VCR, recording every minute of FX's ""Buffy's Skewers Choice Marathon."" For Christmas, she gave herself Buffy's First Season on DVD, thinly disguised as a present to me. In short order followed Season Two and Three. Then I moved out to my own place. No matter. When Four came out, I was compelled to invite her over every Sunday for two episodes. As of this writing we are about five episodes away from the end of the season. Luckily, Season Five will soon be released, which will prevent her from breaking her into my apartment and looting all my DVD's like a crazed junkie going through a pharmacy. Then again, for Christmas this year, she wants a DVD player of her own, and...gasp!....I've already invited her in!Suffice to say, if Buffy's Second Season could convert my Moms, Seminary and all, it HAS to be good. Some (not all) of the highlights: ""School Hard"" (enter Spike & Dru), ""Reptile Boy"" (hilarious, but creepy), ""Halloween"" (just hilarious), ""Lie to Me"" (moving), ""Ted"" (in retrospect, a good tribute to John Ritter), ""What's My Line I & II...."" (Xander and Cordelia!) ""The Dark Age"", ""Bewitched...."" (also hilarious), ""Passion"" (most disturbing episode of the series), ""Go Fish"" and ""Becoming I & II.""If liked Buffy after the first season, Season Two is probably what made you a fan. And if you're not a fan, you might want to give these 22 episodes a spin. If that doesn't work, check your pulse. You're probably dead. Congrats! Wipe off that grave dirt, take a gander at the moon, wander around the cemetary and have a nice long drink of someone's blood. Just do yourself a favor....stay out of Sunnydale.",5,Grrr.

695124,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B000063IOT,Mitch Weaver,"[2, 8]","After the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, fans knew that the show could only get better, and season two definately brought the show to a whole new level. Season two had so many things working for it, from the introduction of my favorite character Spike and Buffy's relationship with Angel heating up, to the introduction of Angel's darkside Angelus who turned out to be one of the show's greatest villans. Now season two is very good and I definately enjoyed it. However, I also feel that the season is overrated because many fans of the show think that season two is the show's best season, when seasons three, five, and six were much better overall. I mean, let's be honest here. There were some really bad episodes in this season like - &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot;, &quot;Ted&quot;, &quot;Reptile Boy&quot;, &quot;Inca Mummy Girl&quot;, &quot;Bad Eggs&quot;, and &quot;Go Fish&quot;. In order for a season to be worthy of a five star rating, it needs to be great from start to finish, with a minimum number of bad episodes.The second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer does feature some wonderful episodes however that manage to make up for season two's shortcomings. &quot;School Hard&quot; is one of my all time favorite episodes because it introduced my favorite character Spike. The bad ass leather clad vampire proved to be so popular, that the writers ended up keeping him around for the rest of the show. The classic episode &quot;Halloween&quot; has everyone turn into whatever they dressed up as for Halloween. &quot;Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered&quot; is another one of my all time favorites and is definately a candidate for funniest episode ever. When Cordelia dumps Xander on Valentine's Day, he seeks help in a witch at Suunydale High named Amy to cast a spell on Cordelia to make her fall in love with him. Unfortunately, Xander ends up becoming the object of every woman's affection in Sunnydale. The two best Buffy/Angel episodes of the entire show are &quot;Suprise&quot; and &quot;Innocence&quot; in which their relationship ascends to a new level, and we are introduced to Angel's darkside Angelus who turns out to be one of the best villans ever. Season two comes to an amazing conclusion in &quot;Becoming&quot; parts 1&amp;2. Other episodes worth mentioning are &quot;What's My Line&quot; parts 1&amp;2, &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Phases&quot;, and &quot;I Only Have Eyes of You&quot;.Even though season two is not quite as good as a lot of people claim, it is still a highly enjoyable and definately worth owning. What really makes the season two DVD set special is the bonus features.

Or I would need a CT and a shrink myself. Season Two amplifies on the promise of season One, and then soars to become a modern epic.The show is laugh-out-loud funny, jump-from -your-seat scary, and makes-you-swoon romantic.The high school drama on the show is about as good as the travails of high school have ever been put to screen. ""My So-Called Life"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" I consider to be the highpoints. This gets close, and it's only PART of the show.The monsters (Buffy's own ""freaks and geeks"" if you will) are movie-quality good. Note the homages to all the classic Universal creatures during this season. Besides the vampires, you have an episode modelled after ""Frankenstein/Bride of Frankenstein"", you have a ""Wolfman"" episode,  and you have a ""Creature of the Black Lagoon"" episode.The Shakespearean romance between Buffy and Angel is done amazingly well. It feels more real and intense than pretty much anything else on ""normal"" TV at the moment. The tragedy inherent in their relationship threads throughout the season, culminating in the last few minutes of the finale. I was emotionally involved in a way I would have never imagined...again...in a show called ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer.""The characters are a joy to spend time with. Xander, Cordy, Willow, Giles, Miss Calendar, Spike, Dru...their chemistry creates an ensemble comparable to something like ""The West Wing"" or ""MASH"". They've all become essential.Then there is something I will call passion. There is a passion behind the creation of these episodes that infuses every inch of your TV screen. A passion for quality, a passion for depth (who'd have thunk...), a passion for telling a grand story...there is one episode, the title I've given away...that had me on the brink of tears.""Buffy"" had a 40-year-old trauma surgeon on the brink of tears. How is this possible?  Will I start TiVo-ing Oprah next? Or worse, The Lifetime Network?No. This is impossibly good television doing it's job. Making you think. Making you care.

695126,AU1ROWBIOKX7X,B000063IOT,M. Leister,"[1, 1]","This not just the best season of Buffy, I think it's the best season of TV ever produced.  I have never seen a show so capably swoop between the highs and lows of human emotion, while still being humorous, battling monsters and telling allegorical teen stories.  I really don't think there was one bad episode out of the bunch this season and they never stopped surprising me (in a good way).  All teen shows that can't seem to get high school right could learn something from this season of Buffy.Standout episodes are:  Surprise, Innocence, Passion, Becoming 1 and Becoming 2.  But anything from this year is a must see.In season two, if Buffy cried, it was for a darn good reason.  Not the case in seasons three and four.  She also knew when to come out swinging instead of tearing up and I felt like her heart was as much in her fists when she had to fight as it was in her eyes when she had emotional moments.  Buffy had heart this season and she was a force of nature before the writers began to diminish her power either because they suddenly decided strong women were bad or to justify making witchy, whiny Willow (who does not become whiny until she becomes a witch, she's still great this season) the center of the show from season four on.There are not words to describe the perfection of the tragic love story written for Buffy and Angel.  The first half of the season I spent breathlessly waiting for them to hit the sheets, but the second half I often found myself waiting for her to beat the crap out of him.I enjoyed Willow and Oz.  Also liked the surprise of Xander and Cordelia.  They were a great snarky couple.  Jenny and Giles were fun to watch as he got dating tips from the kids, and finding out Jenny's true purpose was a shocker.LOVED Spike's alliance with Buffy.  The scenes where he approaches her about it and then meets Joyce were priceless.Bumbles and fumbles in no particular order:1.  In Halloween Buffy says Angel was 18 and still human in the 1770s, but in Becoming 1, they show him becoming a vampire in the 1750s which is also inconsistent with his age 241.2.  If one slayer is born into every generation, Kendra would have to be a baby or not even born yet, but she's Buffy age so they are the same generation making their whole, ""Into every generation a slayer is born..."" a big fat lie.3.  In School Hard, Spike calls Angel his sire, but in a subsequent season, it's revealed Drusilla sired him.4.  The spell Willow uses to restore Angel's soul is an approximation of the original gypsy curse, perfect for saying the happiness clause (which was really stupid to build into it in the first place) no longer applies, but the chance is ignored.5.  This is more season 3, but it starts here, Joyce very forcefully tells her teen daughter in Becoming 2 that if she leaves the house not to bother coming back.  What right does Joyce have, in season 3, to tell Buffy her angry words were Buffy's fault for dropping the slayer bomb on her and that Buffy should have known to ignore them instead of running away? Buffy is a teen, her mom said not to come back, how would you have taken that at 17?6.  Instead of Xander telling Buffy that Willow was going to try the spell again in Becoming 2, he instead tells her Willow's message is to kick Angel's a**, leaving Buffy to be blindsided by her beloved's good guy turn at the end.  She could have stalled Angel from taking the sword out of Acathla had she known, instead of stalling to put off killing him, or at least been braced for the heart break to come.  Xander betrayed her and the writers ignore it until the final season because, in spite of fan comments that we saw it as a betrayal, they refused to admit it was until then.  Xander was a jealous Angel hater who saw a chance to get him gone and took it at Buffy's expense, any later anger he had because she grew jaded over life's miseries (and they do make her life miserable) is partially his fault with this one sentence.As you can tell, I was bitterly disappointed with what came after for all the characters in seasons 3-7.  I'm not sure if the writers realized they couldn't live up to this season and didn't bother to try or if this season made them think every idea they had was perfection so they went with it, ignoring fan response.  Either way it goes downhill fast after this.  Seasons 5 and 6 sucked big time.My advice would be to finish high school with Buffy in season three because although three is annoying given Buffy's doormat turn with her friends, Scott and Faith, it draws a close to the school years which is where Buffy did its best work and decide what came next for yourself.To the really brave I would say watch seasons one and two and make up your own ending.  As devoted to this show as I was after season two, never knowing that Angel would be written out, Buffy diminished and turned into a single mom to an obnoxious pointless fake sister who whines and mopes, Spike a joke, Xander superfluous, Giles mia and Willow turned into a harpy; it would have been hard to have convinced me at the time to take my own advice and stop here.  But in hindsight, I wish I didn't know what the writers did to all the characters I loved to make a mockery of the people they created in this, Buffy's finest season.Watch this season, enjoy it and either skip the rest.",5,"Best season of Buffy, best TV season ever.",1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,5323,"['not', 'just', 'best', 'season', 'Buffy', 'think', 'best', 'season', 'TV', 'ever',

The season first highlight is the arrival of Drusilla and Spike, blood-lusting  who have an ancient tie to Angel.  Things get worse when Angel is stripped of his soul (indirectly caused by Buffy) and rejoins his old comrades in causing mayhem.  From there, Angel goes on a killing spree, which claims the life of Giles' girfriend in one outstanding and unforgettable episode.  Buffy is hopelessly torn between  killing her lover or trying, by some miracle, to help him regain his soul.This even, sky-high story-arc is balanced by various love stories between and among the Scooby Gang.  Willow and Oz begin a relationship as does Xander and Cordelia.  How Xander wins her love is by seeking revenge on her with a love spell that backfires in one crazy, inventive episode.  But the real beacon of this seasn is Buffy coming to terms on her torrid tie to Angel, that grows steadily to a heart-wrenching conculsion when Angel tries to descend the earth into hell.  Elsewhere, Buffy reveals to her mother that she is a Slayer in the final episode of the season, and the torrent of conflicting emotion that follows is almost unbearable.  That, is why this season is as memorable as it is.  The emotion in this season is tangible, and that is why Buffy The Vampire Slayer is so unforgettable.",5,This is Where Buffy Began to Shine,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,1498,"['surprisingly', 'satisfying', 'underrated', 'first', 'season', 'season', 'two', 'where', 'Buffy', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'gained', 'massive', 'popularity', 'rich', 'storylines', 'incredible', 'characters', 'smartly', 'handled', 'tragedy', 'season', 'first', 'highlight', 'arrival', 'Drusilla', 'Spike', 'blood-lusting', 'who', 'have', 'ancient', 'tie', 'Angel', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'Angel', 'stripped', 'soul', 'indirectly', 'caused', 'Buffy', 'old', 'comrades', 'causing', 'mayhem', 'there', 'Angel', 'killing', 'spree', 'life', 'Giles', 'girfriend', 'one', 'outstanding', 'unforgettable', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'hopelessly', 'torn', 'killing', 'lover', 'trying', 'miracle', 'help', 'regain', 'soul.This', 'even', 'sky-high', 'story-arc', 'balanced', 'various', 'love', 'stories', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'Willow', 'Oz', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Xander', 'Cordelia', 'How', 'Xander', 'love', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'love', 'spell', 'one', 'crazy', 'inventive', 'episode', 'real', 'beacon', 'seasn', 'Buffy', 'coming', 'terms', 'torrid', 'tie', 'Angel', 'steadily', 'heart-wrenching', 'conculsion', 'when', 'Angel', 'descend', 'earth', 'hell', 'Elsewhere', 'Buffy', 'mother', 'Slayer', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'torrent', 'conflicting', 'emotion', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'why', 'season', 'as', 'memorable', 'emotion', 'season', 'tangible', 'why', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'so', 'unforgettable']",N/A

Lohrke,"[1, 2]","fortunately, dvd's solved that problem.  the merits of 'buffy the vampire slayer' are well documented--it's a perfect blend of drama, humor, fantasy, and wit.  top to bottom the writing is superb, the acting top notch, and the direction nearly peerless.with the second season, joss whedon and co. were able to dig deeper into their characters, establish longer arcs, introduce new characters, and ratchet up the drama to almost unbearable levels. rightfully so, the second season was a much darker affair with the arrival of spike and drusilla (played to perfection by juliet landau and james marster) and buffy and angel's on-again-off-again romance.  the emergence of willow, xander, and cordelia as significant players--both dramatically and comicallyjust as the first season, whedon and his writers made the relationships between the show's characters the focal point of the show. the best episodes had very little, if anything, to do with actual vampire slaying. whedon, somehow, understands what it's like to be a teenage girl and he taps into that psyche beautifully. and whedon also understands that in slayerland, people have to face unbearable tragedy.  this he does honestly and effectively without ever dumbing it down and pandering to his audience.  it's real, geniune, and spot-on.  special mention should be made for anthony head and robia la morte, particulary in the the episode 'passion.' both are superb, and anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of latin or the romance languages will see a little foreshadowing with robia la morte's character.the best episodes, in my opinion, are pretty much in line with what everyone seems to think: beginnings parts 1 and 2 and 'passion.'  'passion' is one of the best episodes of any show i've ever seen, regardless of genre.  i think 'buffy the vampire slayer' is all about choices and accountability.  every choice, it seems, carries a consequence. sometimes the consequences are favorable, other times not, but they are choices we have to make, even the hard ones.  anyone put off by the idea of vampires and fantasy and the like needn't be.

695129,A3NZBGWIPLXVO7,B000063IOT,"Mob Hunter ""duveen""","[7, 9]","This is not a review of the second season.  Let's face it, if you are interested in the box set, you are probably already a fan of the series.  Rather, I want to express a few thoughts about the DVD set itself.  First, the drawback of shooting season two in 16mm is grainy footage at times.  Season one was also shot in 16mm, but I didn't really notice grainy sections on that set.  This set has them in spades and not only in sections of the show that are dark (in lighting, not mood).  It is not only unfortunate, but also a bit distracting.  Of course, the set is so reasonably priced compared to the season sets of other shows that, combined with the 16mm original footage, it may be forgivable.  Still, I would have liked more in the way of quality control before the set was released.  The season one set seemed better technically.  With season three and those following being shot in 35mm, we can hope for an end to any grainy film in future sets.  Otherwise, the set is full of extras, more so than was the season one set.  I'd still like more input from the show regulars, especially from Gellar, Hannigan, and Brendon.  Still, it is an improvement.  I have heard that ""Buffy"" in Europe is shown in letterbox.  If true, then I would certainly prefer that to our standard TV format for the sets.  Also, while the menus screens are very well done CGI scenes, they are too long.  When you want to watch the show, you don't want to have to sit through too-long roving camera movements each and every time.  Less here, would be more.  Finally, a better printed guide accompanying the set would be welcome, mapping out exactly what is included and where it can be found.  (The season one set also shared this failing.)  Ultimately, fans of this great show and its excellent second season will enjoy the set, but its technical drawbacks are evident.",4,"Great Season, but Tech Issues Exist",1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,1851,"['not', 'review', 'second', 'season', 'Let', 'face', 'are', 'interested', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'probably', 'already', 'fan', 'series', 'Rather', 'want', 'express', 'few', 'thoughts', 'DVD', 'set', 'First', 'drawback', 'shooting', 'season', 'two', '16mm', 'grainy', 'footage', 'times', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'shot', '16mm', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'grainy', 'sections', 'set', 'set', 'spades', 'not', 'only', 'sections', 'show', 'are', 'dark', 'lighting', 'not', 'mood', 'not', 'only', 'unfortunate', 'also', 'bit', 'distracting', 'course', 'set', 'so', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'compared', 'season', 'sets', 'other', 'shows', 'combined', '16mm', 'original', 'footage', 'may', 'be', 'forgivable', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'way', 'quality', 'control', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'season', 'one', 'set', 'seemed', 'better', 'technically', 'season', 'three', 'following', 'being', 'shot', '35mm', 'can', 'hope', 'end', 'grainy', 'film', 'future', 'sets', 'Otherwise', 'set', 'full', 'extras', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'season', 'one', 'set', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'more', 'input', 'show', 'especially', 'Gellar', 'Hannigan', 'Brendon', 'Still', 'improvement', 'have', 'heard', 'Buffy', 'Europe', 'shown', 'letterbox', 'true', 'then', 'would', 'certainly', 'prefer', 'standard', 'TV', 'format', 'sets', 'Also', 'menus', 'screens', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'When', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'sit', 'too-long', 'roving', 'camera', 'movements', 'time', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'Finally', 'better', 'printed', 'guide', 'accompanying', 'set', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'mapping', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'included', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'season', 'one', 'set', 'also', 'shared', 'failing', 'Ultimately', 'fans', 'great', 'show', 'excellent', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'enjoy', 'set', 'technical', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'evident']",N/A

695132,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B000063IOT,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[9, 11]","Building on the first season, this second season is often seen as the best by many long-standing fans.  This is perhaps a wise choice as it is season two that really proved to the critics that `Buffy' was not just some ordinary science-fiction drama.  Through use of metaphor the show has transcended its apparent limits.  For instance, a boyfriend turning `evil' after the heroine sleeps with him and puberty being shown as being literally monstrous.  If it were merely the show's intelligence that was standout then it certainly would be interesting to watch.  However season two manages to combine various elements to prove once again that `Buffy' is one of the best TV shows at the moment.This season has a distinctly gothic theme in accordance to its knowing nods to its several references.  Yet maybe it is the pop-culture heavy dialogue and references from sources as broad as Humphrey Bogart to `The Exorcist', that make this show so original.  With its intelligent themes it has won over the critics whilst its solid stories and clear knowledge of what being a teenager is like have endeared it to countless people from all age groups.  In a particularly clever device, school is literally hell.One thing certainly worth noting is the acting though, which is never less than excellent.  It would be pointless to reel off names, yet Sarah Michelle Gellar brings a real vulnerability to her role as the slayer and is perfectly complemented by David Boreanaz as both her loving boyfriend and ironically her worst enemy.  Also worth noting are the several new characters that appear in the second season such as Oz (Seth Green), Spike (James Marsters), Drusilla (Juliet Landau) and Kendra (Bianca Lawson).  Whilst obviously centring around Buffy, the show does well to manage to progress all of its other characters as well.  For instance, all of the main stars have an episode which is revolves around them, notably Xander with `Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered' and Willow and Oz in `Phases'.With a winning formula of absolutely laugh-out-loud comedy, the programme has also managed to stage tragedy and drama effectively as well.  Whilst the many comic episodes are superb, the pivotal and overwhelmingly tragic episodes are what really impress.  Yet what is even more impressive is the fact that each of these episodes remains distinct and outstanding in its own right.  In particular, `Passion' is devastating after an effective and genuinely scary build-up of tension.  The mid-way episode `Innocence' has such a tenderly moving and upsetting final scene that it manages to evoke tears without death or injury.  Season two manages to go out with a bang too, with a two-part finale which promises the end of the world.  Under many directors this could well have been reduced to just a cheesy plot, yet writer and director Joss Whedon manages to create a real glimpse at the horrors of adolescence and has mastered all of the themes that seen synonymous with the genre, especially friendship and love.Season two is a showcase for a show that not only has unerring popularity yet is also unerringly brilliant, witty and intelligent.",5,One of the best TV shows ever made,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,3142,"['Building', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'often', 'seen', 'best', 'many', 'long-standing', 'fans', 'perhaps', 'wise', 'choice', 'season', 'two', 'really', 'proved', 'critics', 'Buffy', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'ordinary', 'science-fiction', 'drama', 'use', 'metaphor', 'show', 'transcended', 'apparent', 'limits', 'instance', 'boyfriend', 'turning', 'evil', 'heroine', 'sleeps', 'puberty', 'being', 'shown', 'being', 'literally', 'monstrous', 'were', 'merely', 'show', 'intelligence', 'was', 'standout', 'then', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'However', 'season', 'two', 'manages', 'combine', 'various', 'elements', 'prove', 'once', 'again', 'Buffy', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'moment.This', 'season', 'distinctly', 'gothic', 'theme', 'accordance', 'knowing', 'nods', 'several', 'references', 'maybe', 'pop-culture', 'heavy', 'dialogue', 'references', 'sources', 'as', 'broad', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Exorcist', 'make', 'show', 'so', 'original', 'intelligent', 'themes', 'won', 'critics', 'whilst', 'solid', 'stories', 'clear', 'knowledge', 'what', 'being', 'teenager', 'have', 'endeared', 'countless', 'people', 'age', 'groups', 'particularly', 'clever', 'device', 'school', 'literally', 'hell.One', 'thing', 'certainly', 'worth', 'noting', 'acting', 'never', 'less', 'excellent', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', 'reel', 'off', 'names', 'yet', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'real', 'vulnerability', 'role', 'slayer', 'perfectly', 'complemented', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'loving', 'boyfriend', 'ironically', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'are', 'several', 'new', 'characters', 'appear', 'second', 'season', 'such', 'Oz', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Drusilla', 'Juliet', 'Landau', 'Kendra', 'Bianca', 'Lawson', 'Whilst', 'obviously', 'centring', 'Buffy', 'show', 'well', 'manage', 'progress', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'instance', 'main', 'stars', 'have', 'episode', 'revolves', 'notably', 'Xander', 'Bewitched', 'Bothered', 'Bewildered', 'Willow', 'Oz', ""Phases'.With"", 'winning', 'formula', 'absolutely', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'programme', 'also', 'managed', 'stage', 'tragedy', 'drama', 'effectively', 'as', 'well', 'Whilst', 'many', 'comic', 'episodes', 'are', 'superb', 'pivotal', 'overwhelmingly', 'tragic', 'episodes', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'impress', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'fact', 'episodes', 'distinct', 'outstanding', 'own', 'right', 'particular', 'Passion', 'devastating', 'effective', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'build-up', 'tension', 'mid-way', 'episode', 'Innocence', 'tenderly', 'moving', 'upsetting', 'final', 'scene', 'evoke', 'tears', 'death', 'injury', 'Season', 'two', 'manages', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'too', 'two-part', 'finale', 'end', 'world', 'many', 'directors', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'just', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'yet', 'writer', 'director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'create', 'real', 'glimpse', 'horrors', 'adolescence', 'mastered', 'themes', 'seen', 'synonymous', 'genre', 'especially', 'friendship', 'love.Season', 'two', 'showcase', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'unerring', 'popularity', 'yet', 'also', 'unerringly', 'brilliant', 'witty', 'intelligent']",N/A

The love, the sex, the killing, the drama, the laughter all contributed to making this Buffy's second or third best season (behind 3 and maybe 7).

That character is the 100% bad@$$ Spike.In ""School Hard,"" the third episode of the season, Spike, and his psychotic psychic vampire lover Drusilla are introduced to Sunnydale in an amazingly terrifying episode.  James Marsters makes Spike not only the best Buffy villain of all time, but the most awesome with an amazing adeptness that will never be seen by a television actor ever again.  Spike is the quintessential hardcore villain that the good guy can't wait to get rid of, but cannot leave because the audience is so entranced by the villain's every move.Spike revolutionized Buffy when he appeared on the scene.

The second season is where the show really began to pick up momentum as the main characters became more fleshed out, and the show displayed it's first signs of brilliance towards the end of the season when Angel (David Boreanaz) loses his soul and goes evil.  Season 2 was a pivotal season of the series as it introduces the vampires Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau); both of whom would play major parts in the development of the show's story arc's.  Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Angel confessed they're love for one another, and Gellar and Boreanaz both shine in the later episodes when Angel goes bad.  I found myself surprised at how heart wrenching that story arc turned out to be.  Xander (Nicholas Brendon) fell in love with popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) while Willow (Alyson Hannigan) found love with werewolf by night Oz (Seth Green), and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) fell for fellow teacher Ms. Calendar (Robia La Morte) in a relationship that would end in tragedy.

This season achieves marvelously weaving through broken hearts and broken bones. It has intelligence, wit, and humor but will make you cry your eyes out at the same time. Buffy once again has the role of saving the world from the dark demons who plan to demolish it but fail. This season has more emotion and depth than alot of other series out there and was very overlooked by the emmys, one for Gellars stunning performances and the entire show.Allison Hannigan takes on the adorable role of geeky and shy Willow who falls in love with her best friend who falls in with the school's popular ditsy Cordelia, OH BOY! So many love traingles, so little time. The season was filled with so much emotion and amazing climaxes it was hard to find a favorite episode but by far the final conlusion of the series was a marvelous closure. It may have been the ending but only started a new beginning to an excellent third-season.Buffy is without a doubt one of the best shows on television, although I started to break away from it episode by episode ever since it turned to the UPN. After that it seemed like everything flopped and I didnt even catch the seires finale! So I am patiently waiting for that to come out on DVD so I can catch up on the rollercoaster life of Buffy.

695142,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000063IOT,P Magnum,"[3, 3]","Season two of Buffy The Vampire Slayer was the first full season as season one was a brief thirteen episodes.  Season two focuses on the development of romantic relationship between the cast members.  The core relationship, of course, is the one between Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and the vampire Angel (David Boreanaz).  Throughout the season their relationship grows until finally they consummate their love for one another in the ""Surprise"" episode.  Since Angel is cursed with a soul, he can never have that curse lifted unless he obtains a moment of true happiness.  Upon making love to Buffy, he experiences that moment and loses his soul. In the next episode, ""Innocence"", Buffy experiences all the emotions of a young person who has just lost their virginity and it is compounded by the fact that Angel has become evil and it turns out to be the fault of their actions.  The rest of the season finds Buffy and Angel pitted against one another and the pain that Buffy feels is torturous and real.  Also in season two, Xander (Nicholas Brendan) and Cordelia (Charsima Carpenter) fall in love as does Willow (Allyson Hannigan) and Oz (Seth Green), who is introduced in the ""Inca Mummy Girl"" episode.  We find out later in the ""Phases"" episode that Oz is a werewolf. Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau) are introduced in the ""School Hard"" episode and they play bigger roles later in the season as the join forces with the evil Angel.  We get a glimpse into Giles' (Anthony Stewart Head) past as his old friend Ethan Rayne first appears in the ""Halloween"" episode and then ""The Dark Age"" in which we see that Giles isn't just the stuffy librarian he appears to be.  A second slayer, Kendra (Bianca Lawson) appears in the ""What's My Line"" episodes.  The season ends with the two parts of ""The Becoming"" in which we see how Angel becomes a vampire at the hand of Darla (Julie Benz) and how he psychologically tortured then sired Drusilla.  Angel is trying to end the world by awaking the demon Acathla who will bring hell on Earth.  He fails, but then Drusilla captures Giles who knows the spell.  In the process she kills Kendra.  Meanwhile, Willow has found a spell to restore Angel's soul.  Buffy confronts Angel, but she is too late as the door is already open.  She knows she must kill Angel as he is the key that will lock the door.  While in battle, Willow successfully performs the spell restoring Angel's soul.  When Buffy realizes that Angel's soul is back, she still kills him as it is the only way to save the world.  The season ends with Buffy leaving Sunnydale on a bus.  Season two does have some lighter moments such as the ""Halloween"" episode where a spell is cast on costumes and the wearer becomes whatever the costume is (Xander becomes a soldier and Buffy an 18th century noblewoman), ""Ted"" where John Ritter guest stars as Buffy's mom's new too perfect to be true boyfriend and ""Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered"" where Xander has a spell cast to have Cordelia love, but it backfires and every girl in Sunnydale loves him except Cordelia.",5,Buffy Vs.

Growing from season one, we watch a teenage girl attempt to adapt to real life again while slaying the demons of Sunnydale.

He establishes an edge that keeps the watcher on their toes in anticipation and uncertainty.We are introduced to Spike and Drusilla, the new bad demons, as they come to take over Sunnydale. Buffy and Angel's relationship matures to a monumental climax. And even Giles, Willow, and Xander fall into relationships of their own.

695151,A2Q4CZVCN5APDL,B000063IOT,Rick,"[3, 3]","It's a tough race, but I give this one the nod over season 3 as the best BTVS season ever. David Boreanaz really shows his acting range in this season and the final season arc telling the story of the doomed Angel/Buffy romance was engaging and nail biting.  I was never a fan of the Angel/Buffy romance and didn't get emotionally attached but the last ten episodes made for some great edge of your seat drama.  One of the high points of this season was more screentime for Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), the most underrated regular cast member, who was really underused in season 1.  She's hilarious and is not shy about dissing Buffy when necessary (an important contrast since most of the other characters often agree with Buffy as if she can do no wrong)yet she continues to evolve into a three dimensional chracter from the  stereotypical shallow popular girl she was at the start of season one.Two underrated episodes of note:""Reptile Boy"" in which Cordelia and Buffy go to a frat party and nearly end up sacrificed to a demon.  David Greenwalt's commentary is great too.  I noticed a couple of reviews that say Greenwalt's commentary is not good and all he does is comment about what's on screen.  They must have switched it off before the end when he reveals how the episode was originally supposed to end.  The other is ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" in which Xander enlists Amy (the fantastic Elizabeth Anne Allen, introduced in the season one episode ""Witch"")to cast a spell to make Cordelia love him, but it backfires and every girl except Cordelia loves him.I have seen several reviews that complain about the picture quality.  The show was on a tight budget the first two years and used a lower grade of film, nothing wrong with the DVD transfer, that's how the episodes first aired.  The picture quality on the DVD certainly beats out taping an episode off of FX.  Should Whedon have upgraded the film for the DVD release?  No, because then the ""purists"" would read him the riot act about how he should preserve the classic BTVS episodes in their original state (you know those people that wont' get off George Lucas' back for the changes to his first Star Wars trilogy).  Joss couldn't win.

695152,A4FX5YCJA630V,B000063IOT,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[6, 6]","It is the opinion of most fans and critics that Season Three of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was the season in the run of the show, and while none can doubt the excellent story-telling, fluid continuity and superior presentation of Season Three, it is certain that Season Two took the viewer on the more emotional rollercoaster, and encompasses within it five of the most heart-rendering, shock-inducing and *best* Buffy episodes of all.Buffy Summers is the Chosen One, the Vampire Slayer: the only girl in the world with the mystical strength and skill within her who can defend the world against the forces of evil, under the guidence of her assigned Watcher - in this case Rupert Giles, the school librarian of Sunnydale High School.Season Two begins with Buffy returning from her summer in L.A. with her father, mentally scarred after her temporary death at the hands of the Master. After her bad behaviour puts all her friends in danger, she once more assumes the mantle of Slayer in order to save them and prevent the Master from once again rising. It is one of the quintessental Buffy episodes, and perfect for any new viewer of the show to grasp the basics of Buffy's duty, the dynamics of those around her, and the themes of the show that carry throughout the entire show. It ends with a scene that portrays the very heart and soul of the show: that of Buffy and her two dearest friends Willow and Xander simply sitting together, talking about nothing in particular. The beautiful relationship between the three characters, the way they bounce off each other and the extreme loyalty between them has always been the very core of what has made this show special for so long - all other characters have come and gone, but Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nicholas Brendon and Alyson Hannigan have weathered the show from beginning to end.Throughout the duration of the Second Season Buffy comes across a range of foes, including one of the most original and &quot;likeable&quot; bad guys: Giles's old acquantice Ethan Rayne, a man who found savage delight in causing &quot;glorious chaos&quot; and in making his old friend miserable, and Billy Fordham, Buffy's old flame from L.A. with aspirations of becoming a vampire himself, leading Buffy to an immensely difficult decision. But foremost among the evil-doers of the show was the marvellous James Marsters as vampiric Spike, the dyed-blonde, leather-clad who became huge favourite among viewers, and his girlfriend, the insane and physic Drusilla, a character to both fear for her cruelty, and pity for her tragic back-story. But of course, the real big-bad was that of the sadistic Angelus...It begins in &quot;Surprise&quot;: its Buffy's seventeenth birthday, and Spike and Drusilla have their own little surprise for her - a demon known as the Judge that burns all the righteousness from living beings. After a close escape, a shaken Angel and Buffy declare and consumate their love, with devastating results. The curse placed upon Angel's soul had a clause - should he ever experience a moment of pure happiness, his soul would be torn from him once more - and this moment he finds in Buffy's arms. Reverting once more into the loathsome Angelus, he joins forces with his old allies to make the Slayer's death long, painful and slow, a fate she faces in &quot;Innocence&quot;. From here comes more painful revelations - friend and ally Jenny Calender confesses she was not who she said she was: her true identity is that of a member of the gypsy tribe that originally cursed Angel, sent there to ensure he remained tortured by his memories. The confession destroys her blossoming romance with Giles, and in &quot;Passion&quot; she goes about rectifying her mistake by finding the ancient curse, but with truly tragic consequences. The series comes to a head in &quot;Becoming Part I and II&quot;, when the vampire trio find a stone demon Acathla with the power to swallow the world into Hell. Angelus is preparing to open it, and with her allies around her, Buffy must deal with both the supernatural components of her life, such as having to destroy her lover despite having his cure, an uneasy alliance with Spike and the death of yet another dear friend, with the (slightly) more ordinary - her explusion from school, her mother's unacceptance of her Slayer-dom and her being a wanted fugitive by the police. There they are - the five best episodes of the series: the most beautifully directed, written and acted moments of all time.Supreme moments are forever stamped upon the viewer's minds - Buffy taking out the indestructable Judge with nothing less than a rocket-launcher (courtesy of Xander), Spike stands from his wheelchair with a smirk, Xander confessing his love to Willow at her bedside, Drusilla hoisting her unconscious lover up off his feet by his arm, Buffy and Kendra facing off for the first time, Willow being suddenly and violently possessed during her first casting of a magic spell, Buffy running in slow motion down the school hall toward the library with her heartbeat echoing off the walls, Buffy gazing at her friends from afar in her silent goodbye to the strains of Sarah McLauchlan, and Buffy and Giles standing before Jenny's grave to the haunting melody of the &quot;Buffy and Angel&quot; theme. Most potent and heartbreaking of all: Buffy and Giles weeping in each others arms outside the burning factory, and of course, Buffy's final sacrifice - destroying the thing she loves most at the moment of reunion to save the world. I defy anyone not to get at least a little teary.",5,Some of the best &quot;Buffy&quot; out there,1062374400,"09 1, 2003",2003,5573,"['opinion', 'most', 'fans', 'critics', 'Season', 'Three', 'quot',

When you consider this season as a whole, it is dizzying to think about all of the story lines that extended simultaneously, often times intertwining.  This was the season where Whedon began to truly flex his story telling muscles-from the producer's angle.  There is so much to love about this season that it is easy to gloss over the few weak points.  Although I despise romantically themed stories, it was easy to put up with the Buffy-Angel trauma because there were so many eye-popping detours, from disgusting monsters to hammy, well-acted villians/villianesses.  Where the stories succeed the most are when they challenge the viewer and force them to become introspective long after the closing credits for a particular episode have been run. Episodes such as ""Passion""  ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" and the unforgetable season finale, ""Becoming, Part Two"" will not only leave you feeling like you walked through a war, but will haunt you for a long time after.  If you loved the Universal Classic Monsters of the 1930s and 40s, then you will also love this season, because all bases are covered: Some Assembly Required (Frankenstein), Phases (the Wolf Man), Inca Mummy Girl (the Mummy), and Go Fish (Creature from the Black Lagoon) all pay their respective homages to the great ones of the past.  Truly what made this series shine brightest was the story arcs created by Whedon.  Granted, the doomed Buffy-Angel romance was the central theme of the second season, but the mesmerizing enjoyment only began when the side-line players such as Spike and Drusilla (swaggering into town in and staggering out by the season's end in that black car!), principal Schneider, and even the Judge try to seemingly sabotage this arc.  In the end, that is what you can say about the show as a whole:  it doesn't walk in a straight line, and the zig-zags it takes with plot and character development are what make universe of Buffy such an enjoyable place to be, or at least visit until dark.",4,welcome to HELL!!!!!!!!!!! mouth.,1053648000,"05 23, 2003",2003,2083,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'recently', 'boarded', 'Buffy', 'express', ""'m"", 'glad', 'decided', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'set', 'When', 'consider', 'season', 'whole', 'dizzying', 'think', 'story', 'lines', 'extended', 'simultaneously', 'often', 'intertwining', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'Whedon', 'began', 'truly', 'flex', 'story', 'telling', 'muscles-from', 'producer', 'angle', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'season', 'easy', 'gloss', 'few', 'weak', 'points', 'despise', 'romantically', 'themed', 'stories', 'was', 'easy', 'put', 'up', 'Buffy-Angel', 'trauma', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'eye-popping', 'detours', 'disgusting', 'monsters', 'hammy', 'well-acted', 'villians/villianesses', 'Where', 'stories', 'succeed', 'most', 'are', 'when', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'force', 'become', 'introspective', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'particular', 'episode', 'have', 'been', 'run', 'Episodes', 'such', 'Passion', 'Only', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'unforgetable', 'season', 'finale', 'Becoming', 'Part', 'Two', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'leave', 'feeling', 'walked', 'war', 'will', 'haunt', 'long', 'time', 'loved', 'Universal', 'Classic', 'Monsters', '1930s', '40s', 'then', 'will', 'also', 'love', 'season', 'bases', 'are', 'covered', 'Assembly', 'Required', 'Frankenstein', 'Phases', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'Inca', 'Mummy', 'Girl', 'Mummy', 'Go', 'Fish', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'pay', 'respective', 'homages', 'great', 'ones', 'past', 'Truly', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'shine', 'brightest', 'was', 'story', 'arcs', 'created', 'Whedon', 'Granted', 'doomed', 'Buffy-Angel', 'romance', 'was', 'central', 'theme', 'second', 'season', 'mesmerizing', 'enjoyment', 'only', 'began', 'when', 'side-line', 'players', 'such', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'swaggering', 'town', 'staggering', 'out', 'season', 'end', 'black', 'car', 'principal', 'Schneider', 'even', 'Judge', 'try', 'seemingly', 'sabotage', 'arc', 'end', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'whole', ""n't"", 'walk', 'straight', 'line', 'zig-zags', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'universe', 'Buffy', 'enjoyable', 'place', 'be', 'least', 'visit', 'dark']",N/A

The show keeps developing the main characters, and every now and then throwing in a grim plot twist that wrenches your heart.  Xanders and Willow are great comic/human counterpoints to Buffy's complex, often melancholy life as the Slayer.  I'm so into this series now, I'm already regretting when Sarah Michelle Gellar may decide to call it quiets down the road.This DVD is incredibly fun.  I found myself watching two and three shows a night.  I'm eating it like candy and loving it.  As far as originality, the show itself is a mixture of humor, horror, and action.  And it all manages to be like a little bit of harmless Halloween fun everytime.  Can't rave enough about Joss Weadon's creation.  Some of the monsters and story lines are just the same old monsters and story lines we've seen in hundreds of horror films since clear back to the Universal Studios days, BUT, remember that in writing fiction, there is no original idea, only original ways of presenting it.

695155,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000063IOT,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","In season two of Buffy, the show transformed itself from merely a hip, funny new series to one of the truly great achievements in the history of TV.  Abandoning the ?monster of the week? format of the first season, the show shifted to the season-long story arc that characterized all the ensuing seasons and focused especially on the relationships between the various characters rather than the creatures of evil.  The results were electrifying in both regards.  By focusing on personal relationships, viewers came to love the characters in a way they could never have in a straight forward horror show, and the season long story arc of the tragic love affair between Buffy and Angel brought television portrayals of romance to levels never before seen.In addition to the central story of the romance between Buffy and Angel, there are a host of subplots that are also developed over the course of the year:  Buffy?s reluctant acceptance of her destiny as the Slayer; Willow?s romance with Oz; the introduction of the Slayer Kendra; the romance, against all odds and reason, between Xander and Cordelia, and the latter?s elevation to fulltime Scooby status; the relationship between Jenny Calendar and Giles; and, perhaps most importantly for the history of the show, the introduction of two new vampires, the psychotic Druscilla and the platinum-haired punk Spike.  In interviews, James Marsters acknowledges that he was originally introduced in order to be staked a few episodes later, but he immediately established himself as one of the most popular supporting characters ever, and not only avoided being staked but eventually was elevated to one of the most important characters in the show (and now apparently will be the lone characters to survive the end of BUFFY to become a fulltime character in ANGEL)But Season Two is primarily about Buffy and Angel.  As the attraction between Vampire Slayer and the vampire with a soul grows, the two consummate their love, with dire results.  As all BUFFY fans know, the gypsy curse that restored Angel?s soul, also stipulated that if he achieved a moment of true happiness, he would lose his soul and return to his murderous state, all of which happens when he and Buffy make love.  As likable as David Boreanaz is as Angel, he is probably always more interesting as Angelus, his demonic, murderous, soulless alter ego, proving, as both Milton and Dante did, that evil always plays more interestingly than good.  The second half inversely mirrors the first half, focusing instead of the growing and deepening love between Buffy and Angel, on Angelus?s attempts at psychic torture, leading up to the season finale.Although it would be rivaled by later episodes like the final episodes of season five and the astonishing episode ?The Body? from that same season, the final episode of the season is without question one of the most emotionally overwhelming episodes in the history of television.  By the final episode, BUFFY has gone to places rarely if ever experienced in television, with central characters shockingly being murdered, with some of the most realistic depictions of teen romance ever, and the apparently complete estrangement between Buffy and her mother.  The final moments of the season, as an emotionally devastated Buffy leaves her friends, her mother, and Sunnydale on a bus heading to Los Angeles with Sarah McLaughlin?s ?Full of Grace? playing in the background, is as intense as any moment anyone could ever hope to see.  Truly a magnificent culmination to not merely one of the greatest moments in the history of TV, but in our fin-de-siecle culture.

695156,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,B000063IOT,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[3, 5]","""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" began its first season, displaying a brilliant trademark sense of humor, drama, horror, and emotional realism. And for what it was, it was great. But compared to the seasons that were to follow, it was only a brief glimpse of what brilliance could come out of the Slayer mythology.The second season is described by many fans as the best season of ""Buffy,"" but I would argue adamently against that. Yes, I love it, as I have every season, but it is only the ""best"" in a nostalgic sort of way, since the show has changed a great deal since then. Although some say it has gotten worse, I think it is the only show I've ever watched that has gotten consistently better and better from season to season. Each season's story arc is stronger than the one before, and as the actors matured and grew into their characters, and new characters were added, ""Buffy"" became a true television masterpiece by the fifth season.Also, while the second season has a brilliant year-long story line, with some great ""mythology"" episodes, and some great stand-alones, it is not a consistently great season, and actually is the one that has the most weak, disposable episodes, more than any other season.""Some Assembly Required,"" ""Reptile Boy,"" ""The Dark Age,"" ""Bad Eggs"" and ""Go Fish"" are all weak episodes. ""Buffy"" is such a well-written show, with such great continuity that I will say that all of these episodes do have something worthwhile about them, whether they be a few great scenes, the great acting, or an important character development that comes out of one of these episodes. But these are still not-great episodes.On the other hand, this season also boasts some brilliant stand-alones, most notably, ""I Only Have Eyes for You,"" a postmodern ghost story that is effective as a standalone and yet also ties into the story arc of the year, brilliantly analyzing the characters.""Halloween,"" ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,"" and ""School Hard"" were great episodes with a comedic bent. Equally great were all other stand-alone episodes of the year.And the major story of the year--the Buffy/Angel relationship is pure genius the whole way through. It leads up to one of the emotionally gutwrenching and beautiful episodes of any show in TV history...""Becoming.""This season is very well-worth owning. The great episodes you'll want to watch over and over, the not-so-great ones all have their own values, and you can continue to see from the first season the evolution of television's best show. What was always great about ""Buffy"" is how organic it is. The show has changed cast members and locations even a great deal, and yet that was never a detriment. The constant change has kept the show fresh, vital, and brilliant. Beloved characters die, new ones come, new villians crop up, etc etc. The show now, in its sixth season, is still the best thing on TV, so the second season was great, but it is only the first year of brilliance.",5,"The first truly great season of ""Buffy"" (but not the best)",1016928000,"03 24, 2002",2002,2952,"['Vampire', 'Slayer', 'began', 'first', 'season', 'displaying', 'brilliant', 'trademark', 'sense', 'humor', 'drama', 'horror', 'emotional', 'realism', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'great', 'compared', 'seasons', 'were', 'follow', 'was', 'only', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'what', 'brilliance', 'could', 'come', 'Slayer', 'mythology.The', 'second', 'season', 'described', 'many', 'fans', 'best', 'season', 'Buffy', 'would', 'argue', 'adamently', 'Yes', 'love', 'have', 'season', 'only', 'best', 'nostalgic', 'sort', 'way', 'show', 'changed', 'great', 'deal', 'then', 'say', 'gotten', 'worse', 'think', 'only', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'gotten', 'consistently', 'better', 'better', 'season', 'season', 'season', 'story', 'arc', 'stronger', 'one', 'actors', 'matured', 'grew', 'characters', 'new', 'characters', 'were', 'added', 'Buffy', 'became', 'true', 'television', 'masterpiece', 'fifth', 'season.Also', 'second', 'season', 'brilliant', 'year-long', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'great', 'stand-alones', 'not', 'consistently', 'great', 'season', 'actually', 'one', 'most', 'weak', 'disposable', 'episodes', 'more', 'other', 'season', 'Assembly', 'Required', 'Reptile', 'Boy', 'Dark', 'Age', 'Bad', 'Eggs', 'Go', 'Fish', 'are', 'weak', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'well-written', 'show', 'such', 'great', 'continuity', 'will', 'say', 'episodes', 'do', 'have', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'be', 'few', 'great', 'scenes', 'great', 'acting', 'important', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'not-great', 'episodes.On', 'other', 'hand', 'season', 'also', 'brilliant', 'stand-alones', 'most', 'notably', 'Only', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'postmodern', 'ghost', 'story', 'effective', 'standalone', 'yet', 'also', 'story', 'arc', 'year', 'brilliantly', 'analyzing', 'characters', 'Halloween', 'Bewitched', 'Bothered', 'Bewildered', 'School', 'Hard', 'were', 'great', 'episodes', 'comedic', 'bent', 'Equally', 'great', 'were', 'other', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'year.And', 'major', 'story', 'year', 'Buffy/Angel', 'relationship', 'pure', 'genius', 'whole', 'way', 'one', 'emotionally', 'gutwrenching', 'beautiful', 'episodes', 'show', 'TV', 'history', 'Becoming', 'season', 'very', 'well-worth', 'owning', 'great', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'not-so-great', 'ones', 'have', 'own', 'values', 'can', 'continue', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'evolution', 'television', 'best', 'show', 'What', 'was', 'always', 'great', 'Buffy', 'how', 'organic', 'show', 'changed', 'cast', 'members', 'locations', 'even', 'great', 'deal', 'yet', 'was', 'never', 'detriment', 'constant', 'change', 'kept', 'show', 'fresh', 'vital', 'brilliant', 'Beloved', 'characters', 'die', 'new', 'ones', 'come', 'new', 'villians', 'crop', 'up', 'etc', 'etc', 'show', 'now', 'sixth', 'season', 'still', 'best', 'thing', 'TV', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'only', 'first', 'year', 'brilliance']",N/A
695157,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000063IOT,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[2, 3]","The second season of BTVS was energized with a mission. Having totally distanced itself from a campy low-budget 1992 movie, there was no doubt this version of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was authentic. More sure of itself, the series took some interesting storyline risks which definently paid off in the immediate and long-run.Season two is the series which many long-time fans (such as myself) remember with incredible fondness because of the wide range of roller-coaster emotions invoked without gratuitous soap.The budding relationship between the slayer and ensouled vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) was a major theme this season.Attempting to be like the girls Angel knew during his own 18th century Ireland youth, Buffy purchases a costume from a new magic shop. Unbeknownst to her, this costume is haunted, and she is forced to actually act like a noble woman (issusing pronouncements against women's litteracy and independent thinking). Ironically one benefit of his transformation allowed Angel to see the progression of women's rights, and consequently meet women that he genuinely found interesting.And then of course, we have the pivotal two-parter where Angel looses his soul after a night of spontaneous passion with Buffy. The famed gypsy curse has a very important clause which prohibits his sexual activity; one moment of true happiness unleashes the monster known as Angelus. After seeing David as the strait-laced Angel, his playful side in Angelus was both disturbing and interesting. Buffy previously slayed many vampires, but she never actually felt for one---instead viewing the task as mundane and robotic.In addition to the episodes, this DVD has so many extra features for the devoted BTVS fan.

695158,A2ODF4T1AAN83E,B000063IOT,"R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer","[1, 3]","The middle of this series along with series 3 and 4, are the best that Buffy has to offer, in my opinion.  The series really picks up by the 6th episode, Halloween.Since this season has the big fight scene with Buffy and Angel, many fans claim this is the best series.  But we really cant look at a series as a whole, you have to look at the ups and downs of the series.  As i said before, I believe the middle of this particulary season with all of season 3,4 are the best of Buffy, but I know many of you will not agree with me.

695159,A14XSDTJ3CNOD7,B000063IOT,Saki,"[12, 13]","I, like so many people I know who later became huge fans of the series, was initially convinced that the show was nothing but teenage horror nonsense, similar more to ""Idle Hands"" than Shakespeare. This opinion was, needless to say, unforgivably uninformed. I took the silliness of the title, my giant lack of feelings toward the movie of the same name, and the caricatures put forth by the equally uninformed, and created for myself a negative mental picture of the show. The picture carried me straight through the first season of the show, as I, in my great ignorance, did not watch Buffy. A couple of episodes into the second season, however, the naysayers started to get shouted down, and Buffy became a force to be denied no longer. I had to try it, if only to have fuel for my anti-Buffy arguments with friends.The first episode that I watched was ""School Hard,"" in which Spike and Drusilla first arrive in Sunnydale. It was a huge episode, full of action, adventure, suspense, humor, and high drama. Oddly enough, though, impressed as I was by those elements, it seemed like there was a deeper reason and meaning to everything, and even in the most plot-centered of moments, the characters shone through as real and interesting people, including the villains. That impressed me even more. I then watched the next episode on the very next week, entitled ""Inca Mummy Girl."" I had a lot of fun with that episode as well, thinking that surely it was another of Buffy's greatest episodes. Other television wasn't like this. Surely Buffy wasn't consistently like this either. As I later discovered, ""Inca Mummy Girl"" was actually very much a substandard episode for the series, and yet still it was better than anything else on television.I've always thought that the most impressive thing that a television show can do is to win over someone who is only watching it for evidence by which to condemn it. That is exactly what Buffy did for me. Throughout the second season Buffy kept up its excellence, reaching even higher highs that the first appearance of Spike, and making other television look about as unappealing as food poisoning.Just try this package of episodes. Rent it if you're unsure. Borrow it from a friend and ask them what episode they recommend that you watch first. I would pick ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,"" for its humor. Just give Buffy a chance.

And I can honestly say the show was at its creative peak here, though some believe it hit that plateau in seasons three or five. After the critical acclaim from the first season, the WB ordered a round 22 episodes for the next, and fans ate it up. If the writing from last season was exceptional to avoid a possible cancellation, the writing in this season evolved into something even better - as if Joss Whedon and his team of merry morbids were determined to make the most of the renewal they were given. And they certainly did.Season two continues the exploits of Buffy Summers, Vampire Slayer and Neiman Marcus aficionado, as she tests the choppy waters of first love with Angel, vampire with a soul (played masterfully by David Boreanaz, who is added to the opening credits this year). Things are complicated when you're a sixteen-year-old girl, sure - but of course things are even more complicated when you lose your virginity to a soulless jerk who then proceeds to kill your friends. Wait, what? That's not supposed to happen. Yes, Buffy does sleep with Angel in a moment of unrestrained passion, and it costs her dearly: the soul he was cursed with is removed in his one true moment of happiness, and the demon who murdered half of London is back in business.Thankfully, though the season revolves around Buffy and Angel, the supporting cast is given plenty to do on their own, and their characters grown onscreen in a fashion you rarely see anymore on TV - realistically. Xander ends up falling in love with bitter enemy Cordelia (who finally has a reason to be in the main credits this season), to the angst of a crushed Willow, who meets cooler-than-cool guitarist Oz (a laconic Seth Green in one of his best roles), who turns out to be a werewolf... add to that a dash of romance even for Giles, and the appearance of a new Slayer, and you have a year full of emotional twists and turns that will culminate in what is arguably the most unforgettable season finale this show has seen. It doesn't hurt that it yanks unmercifully on the heartstrings, too.As usual, the special features are only for hardcore fans with nothing better to do - but the audio commentaries are always worth a listen, especially Joss Whedon's on ""Innocence.""

695168,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000063IOT,Sean Pasek,"[2, 4]","Season 2 of Buffy was the pinnacle of the series.  Right after Season 1, Joss Whedon decides to go for the jugular.  He puts the audience on an emotional and gripping rollercoaster ride.You might argue how one can consider a vampire to be Buffy's best villain when she's fought against more powerful demons, gods, and even a friend as a witch.Whedon sets up the Angel/Buffy relationship to appear that everything is running smooth as silk for these two lovers.  There are some very touching episodes and moments leading up to the nightmare that Buffy must endure.  It's obvious how much Angel and Buffy love each other.  Buffy loses herself in Angel and can't even envision a life without him.  But that is exactly what she must face when ancient curse, caused by a moment of pure ecstasy robs Angel of his soul, and Angelus emerges.The episode, ""Innocence"" showcases this, and is, in my opinion, the best episode of the entire series.  Whedon immediately shows his audience that ANYTHING can happen on this show, and that he isn't afraid to turn Buffy's world upside-down, which is exactly what happens.Watch Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting during the course of this season, and see how she's able to get in touch with Buffy's emotional center.  Buffy is the slayer, but she's still a young, teenage girl, as suseptible to all of the pains and hardships that go with the loss of someone you love.  But, it's worse for Buffy.  Angel doesn't just die, he's transformed into her enemy.  An enemy who loves to torture his victims.  We get an idea of just how vindictive and cruel Angelus must have been.  Drusilla is probably his masterpiece...a woman he drove insane before changing her into a vampire.  And Angelus makes the most of his opportunity to shove it all down Buffy's throat without any feelings of remorse.  He tortures and even kills those closest to her and her friends.  David Boreanaz is finally able to show his acting ability.  Before, he was a dark character who brooded and lurked around in the shadows.  The transformation finally gives him a chance to break out.  David has even said that he loves to play Angelus because of the freedom it gives him as an actor.There's a scene in ""Innocence"" when Buffy realizes that Angel is gone, she walks into her bedroom, looks down at her hand to see the ring that Angel gave her.  She breaks down into uncontrollable sobs as the hard truth begins to sink in.  As a viewer, you can't help but feel the level of loss that Buffy feels at this point.  It's almost heart-breaking to watch.  There is a great piece of music that is played throughout the season.  It's the Buffy/Angel ballad the sings music of love and loss.  It adds to the power of the story that is being told.The hardest enemy to deal with is one who you love.  That is why I feel that Angelus/Angel was the best villain for Buffy in this series and why Season 2 is so good.  In the last episode, Buffy gets Angel back, but there is a price to pay as she's asked to make the ultimate sacrifice.Whistler, a demon, isn't sure if Buffy is ready to do what needs to be done.  ""I am,"" she says.  ""I've got nothing left to lose.""  ""You're wrong.  There's one more thing.""  Somehow, Whistler knows that Buffy will not have to kill Angelus, but Angel.Season 2 sees some other great moments in it.  Spike and Drusilla are added.  James Marsters is absolutely fantastic in his role of Spike, and it's little wonder that fans became so enamored with his character, that Spike was brought back for more seasons after he was originally supposed to be killed after a handful of episodes.We also get a look at the origin of Angel.  It isn't as in-depth as some of the origin episodes in ""Angel,"" but this is the first glimpse we're given at his life before Buffy and how he came to discover her.The writing is first rate in this season.  I've always said that a film/television series is only as good as its writing.Most television shows have a ""best"" season.  And while almost every season (except for the 4th one) is very good during Buffy's television reign, Season 2 is the peak of the series' success, and seems to sum up all that was great about this show.

695173,AJ02IW0YNCS3B,B000063IOT,Stephen Ebrey,"[2, 2]","Although the second season of Buffy has the same mix of comedy and tragedy that makes the third and fifth seasons of the show so popular, in other ways it is a very unusual season.  This is the only plot-driven season of Buffy, which is generally a character-driven show.  And the plot is fantastic: it surprises the audience and tortures the characters, who show far more depth than in the first season.  Half of these episodes feature Spike (he's not always the focus of the plot, but he's always around when big things are happening), and they are brilliant.  Spike and Drusilla are the show's first proper villain, although the second half of the season gives us an even better one.  While David Boreanaz is not a great actor, this season uses him brilliantly, and he gives wonderful performances in ""Innocence"", ""I Only Have Eyes for You"", and ""Becoming Parts I and II.""The non-plot episodes of this season are a different story.  Some of them are fantastic - like the step-father story ""Ted"" and Oz's big episode, ""Phases.""  Others are bad but tolerable, like the anti-frat ""Reptile Boy.""  But ""Bad Eggs"" and ""Killed by Death"" are far more painful than anything in the first season of Buffy, because they're not only bad, but they come between fantastically written and important episodes of the season.  Had these episodes been aired in the quieter first half of the season they would have simply been forgettable, but their placement throws off the pacing of the story.Another reason for the second season's inconsistency is that it has the best cast of any season of the show, but many of them are recurring characters.  This is the only season of Buffy where every character has a love interest, as Willow's man Oz is introduced and Jenny Calendar takes on a larger role.  Both characters are adorable with Willow and Giles.  Spike and Drusilla are hilarious but complex characters, and Spike's decision in the last episode is interesting enough to draw our attention from the gut wrenching emotion of Buffy and Angel's story.  Jonathon and Harmony are noticeable in a number of episodes this season, but they won't become fully-fleshed characters until later seasons, where they will become fan favorites.  The second season episodes with lots of recurring characters are great, while the ones without them are often lackluster.Why is the second season of Buffy a 5-star product despite two truly terrible episodes and several other mediocre ones?  First of all, the worst episodes of this season don't contribute to the overall plot, so it's easy to skip them.  If you cut out the crap this is arguably the best season of the show.  The second season deserves respect for being the turning point of the show, when it went from being an enjoyable monster  show to being a work of art that holds its own when compared to Twin Peaks and the great HBO dramas.Actually, let me clarify that.  The most impressive thing about the second season of Buffy is not that it changes from entertainment to art, but that it gets even funnier while doing so.  Most people believe that TV and movies can be nothing but entertaining brain-killers or serious art.  These people need to watch Buffy.",5,"The most inconsistent season of Buffy, but one that you will remember forever",1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,3190,"['second', 'season', 'Buffy', 'same', 'mix', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'third', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'show', 'so', 'popular', 'other', 'ways', 'very', 'unusual', 'season', 'only', 'plot-driven', 'season', 'Buffy', 'generally', 'character-driven', 'show', 'plot', 'fantastic', 'audience', 'characters', 'who', 'show', 'far', 'more', 'depth', 'first', 'season', 'Half', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Spike', 'not', 'always', 'focus', 'plot', 'always', 'around', 'when', 'big', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'are', 'show', 'first', 'proper', 'villain', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'even', 'better', 'one', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'season', 'brilliantly', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Innocence', 'Only', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Becoming', 'Parts', 'II', 'non-plot', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'different', 'story', 'are', 'fantastic', 'step-father', 'story', 'Ted', 'Oz', 'big', 'episode', 'Phases', 'Others', 'are', 'bad', 'tolerable', 'anti-frat', 'Reptile', 'Boy', 'Bad', 'Eggs', 'Killed', 'Death', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'painful', 'anything', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', ""'re"", 'not', 'only', 'bad', 'come', 'fantastically', 'written', 'important', 'episodes', 'season', 'Had', 'episodes', 'been', 'aired', 'quieter', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 'forgettable', 'placement', 'pacing', 'story.Another', 'reason', 'second', 'season', 'inconsistency', 'best', 'cast', 'season', 'show', 'many', 'are', 'recurring', 'characters', 'only', 'season', 'Buffy', 'where', 'character', 'love', 'interest', 'Willow', 'man', 'Oz', 'introduced', 'Jenny', 'Calendar', 'larger', 'role', 'characters', 'are', 'adorable', 'Willow', 'Giles', 'Spike', 'Drusilla', 'are', 'hilarious', 'complex', 'characters', 'Spike', 'decision', 'last', 'episode', 'interesting', 'enough', 'draw', 'attention', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'emotion', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'story', 'Jonathon', 'Harmony', 'are', 'noticeable', 'number', 'episodes', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'fully-fleshed', 'characters', 'later', 'seasons', 'where', 'will', 'become', 'fan', 'favorites', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'lots', 'recurring', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'ones', 'are', 'often', 'lackluster.Why', 'second', 'season', 'Buffy', '5-star', 'product', 'two', 'truly', 'terrible', 'episodes', 'several', 'other', 'mediocre', 'ones', 'First', 'all', 'worst', 'episodes', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'overall', 'plot', 'easy', 'skip', 'cut', 'out', 'crap', 'arguably', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'deserves', 'respect', 'being', 'turning', 'point', 'show', 'when', 'went', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'monster', 'show', 'being', 'work', 'art', 'own', 'when', 'compared', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'great', 'HBO', 'dramas.Actually', 'let', 'clarify', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'second', 'season', 'Buffy', 'not', 'entertainment', 'art', 'even', 'funnier', 'doing', 'so', 'Most', 'people', 'believe', 'TV', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'nothing', 'entertaining', 'brain-killers', 'serious', 'art', 'people', 'need', 'watch', 'Buffy']",N/A

Season one had a few strikes against it, such as poor video and lack of extras. Season two solved one of those problems, though I was really hoping for them both. First off, the problem that wasn't addressed is the video quality. Some people have commented that it's just fine, which it really is. However, some parts *mostly on disk one* look just terrible, the grain completely covers the characters to the point where you can't even make out their faces. Fortunately you will only run into these scenes a couple of times, and not for very long, and only on disk one. Other then the rare ultra-grain on disk one, the picture is only 'decent', nothing to really complain about, unless you were expecting some kind of drastic change, and nothing to write home about. That is the only negative thing I can say about the season two DVD, and it wasn't bad enough for me to lower the score, everything else makes up for it big time. For starters, the extras they included put season ones offerings to shame. You get some interviews with Joss Whedon as well as commentaries *Joss's are great*, three featurettes explaining things like monter designs, complete with lots of interviews from cast members *but no Buffy?*, photo galleries and more! The other great thing about season two of Buffy is that it's season two of Buffy! Everything is bigger and better, characters are deeper, stories are better, more interesting things happen overall, not to mention Spike and Dru, apparently the vampire versions of Sid and Nancy, and of lastly a huge cliffhanger ending. It is so nice to have have season one and two on DVD, and am looking forward to season three, which is my personal favorite. One more thing, these disks are a steal!

695176,A2B4Q6OVGD3S1V,B000063IOT,stormynight,"[8, 14]","In the fall of 1997, Buffy the Vampire Slayer came back for a second season on the WB, a well-known network of teenage drama and comedy. It was no small event, either, for it was the beginning of a year that, for those paying attention, would change television forever. This mildly popular series had already gained many positive reviews and a growing fan base in the spring of 1997 with its 12 episode long first season. From the start, this show was obviously in a league of its own and fans knew something wild and different was happening. By the time the second season rolled around, the characters were all set up, the themes were all in place, and the quality was all there, just waiting to be put to use. And what followed was one of the best seasons of any television series, ever. When Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar, a prodigy in her generation) came back from vacation in the season premiere ""When She Was Bad"", things had clearly changed. And they continued to change. Over the course of a year, battles raged, emotions soared, hearts bled, and lives were turned upside down...on screen and off. Simply put, there has never been anything like it. Probably never will be again. The critics all knew it. The fans all knew it. For all those who were paying attention, Buffy the Vampire Slayer reached amazing heights and the best show in television was born. The first season may have been where it started, but the Buffy saga began in the second season. The story arcs are now classic. The season finale was one of the most dramatic and shocking hours of TV, in which I and many others believe was the absolute best hour of television in history. No other series can take the audience on such an amazing ride in the course of an hour. Whenever something happened on the show, it was handled with such skill and such care that the impact of it bled into the lives of those watching. When the episode was over, you didn't get up and go about your business without the aftermath of what happened on your TV playing through your mind and toying with your emotions. Some groundbreaking episodes can make grown men burst into uncontrollable tears. The audience is taken along with Buffy like nothing else. In the end, no other TV series ever looks the same. You can't watch any other show without comparing it to Buffy. No other show can match it. After seeing this, all other TV becomes extremely blase, so incredibly unappealing. If you want a taste of something I can't even put into words here, if you want to watch a show that will reach you on all levels and change the way you see TV, then this is the series for you.

This season showed just how much of an impact our choices can have on ourselves, including other people, and sometimes we have to make hard sacrifices and compromises for the sake of ourselves or others we love. There is more sexual content, nothing that was not necessary by any means, and there is a lot more action violence, all in good PG-13 fashion fun.

When I bought the DVD it took me 3 days to finish because season 2 always has a way of reeling me in. The chemistry between Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz is amazing and makes the relationship between Buffy and Angel compulsively watchable. This is the season that also introduces Spike and Drusilla, two of the most interesting characters I've ever seen on TV or movies.

With the second season, we get the full 22 episodes instead of the 12 of the first season.  We also get to see all of the cast members really find their characters.  Sarah Michelle Gellar simply shines in this season, reprising her Buffy character and in doing so, brings us along as she matures while dealing with high school, a boyfriend (Angel, a vampire to boot), and her mother finally discovering that she is the Slayer.  Willow (Allyson Hannigan) begins her foray into Wicca (which will play heavily in later seasons), and gains a boyfriend as well (Oz, played by Seth Green)).  This season is where the show finds itself.  Xander, Cordelia, Giles, and Jenny Calendar, all are here and start really bonding together until the scoobies really come together as a unit.This season has MANY great episodes, and the story arc that builds is considered by many as the best of all the six seasons of Buffy. This is the season where we see Buffy and Angel become both lovers...and worst enemies.  David Boreanaz plays his evil-self part very well, and many will argue that the 2-part season finale (Becoming 1 & 2) are the best episodes of Buffy period.  One of the other things we see is Spike (James Marsters) becoming a likeable villain.  This will pan out in later seasons.For Buffy fans, this DVD set is of course a no-brainer.  For those who have not watched the show, or don't understand the passion behind the fans, this is the season that will open up your eyes.

It was during this second season that fans were given their first taste of the brilliance that made the show so popular in the seasons that followed.The first half of this season sticks, for the most part, to the first season's ""Monster of the Week"" formula, as Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) does battle with an array of creepy crawlies.  Some of these episodes were great, such as ""Halloween"" (in which our gang becomes whatever they're dressed up as) and ""Lie to Me"" (in which Buffy finds herself trying to disillusion a group of vampire worshippers); many were not (""Reptile Boy"", ""Inca Mummy Girl"").  One of the finest early episodes of this season is ""School Hard"", which introduced the fan favorite characters of Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau).  But it's during the second half of the season, beginning at episode 13, where the show finally realized its potential and became the brilliant drama we all know and love.  The primary storyline of the season's later episodes revolves around the relationship between Buffy and Angel (David Boreanaz).  Centuries ago, Angel was cursed by gypsies, who restored his soul, thus forcing him to eternally torment himself for the pain he had caused as the evil vampire Angelus.  If Angel ever experiences a moment of true happiness, he will revert back to his original form as the vampiric barbarian Angelus.  As you may guess, Angel experiences a moment of true happiness, causing Buffy to question whether she can cure her true love - or whether she'll ultimately be forced to kill him.Many of the show's finest episodes are in this season.  They include ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"", in which Angel undergoes his surprising transformation; ""Passion"", in which Angel psychologically torments Buffy's friends and family; ""I Only Have Eyes for You"", in which Sunnydale High is haunted by the ghost of a former student-turned-murderer; and the excellent two-part finale, ""Becoming"", considered by many to be the finest episodes of the entire series.The second season of BUFFY features surprising plot twists, terrific acting (Gellar is outstanding), clever and witty scripts, and a great soundtrack.

What separates Buffy, particularlyits second season, is the humanity that Buffy producerand creator Joss Whedon instilled into his creation.I suspect Whedon took a long look around the televisionuniverse and lamented at its glut of narcissisticcharacters, particularly its YOUNG narcissistic characters.Aware that he was making a show about and primarily foryoung people, he seemed to forge Buffy as a rebuke to allof television's cry baby teenager fare.The tribulations of growing into maturity are truly banaland commonplace, unless couched inside of some suitablyentertaining allegory.

It's hard to describe Buffy the Vampire Slayer's transition from the first season, which establishes a solid framework for a really good TV show, to the second, which knocks the framework down and transcends to TV greatness.Buffy, for those who were fooled by the show's name at the time, was one of the brightest points in the rather dismal history of television writing.  It was smart, witty, fun, dramatic, intoxicating, and entirely accessible - a combination that is almost unbeatable.  The second season picked up where the first left off with a vengeance.""When She Was Bad"" gets pretty far into establishing that circumstances aren't going to be the same this year as they were last; Buffy was going to be able to change and grow, which is pretty remarkable for a TV character to begin with.  It stumbled a little at ""Some Assembly Required,"" but the subsequent ""School Hard"" introduced Spike and Drusilla.  Spike would be perhaps the show's most loveable villain, but he still earned his fangs.  Even down episodes like ""Inca Mummy Girl"" and ""Reptile Boy"" were still great writing and character advancement.It turned around, though, with ""Halloween"" - bringing in another solid villain in Ethan Rayne and playing with all-new rules.  ""Lie To Me"" is a brilliant commentary on real-world ""vampire"" thought.  Then ""The Dark Age"" hit and the character revelations started to truly come clear.  Giles' past was a revelation that we then thought couldn't be topped.""What's My Line?,"" the first Buffy two-parter, introduces what a ""normal"" slayer is like in the gradually likeable character of Kendra, and also finally lets Spike and Dru play big bad for a while.  ""Ted"" is a brilliant, relatively unconnected episode that brings out a lot of psychological factors.  Even another lesser episode like ""Bad Eggs"" is pretty close to the best that a lot of TV shows can offer.Then ""Surprise"" hit with a brutal punch.  The Buffy / Angel relationship is finally consummated, and Angel loses his soul - bringing his character to a completely new level, and indeed elevating the show a lot higher.  ""Innocence"" brings Buffy into conflict with Angelus, and he begins to show why he will rank high among Buffy's villains of all time.  ""Phases"" brings the weirdness home in a different light than before, and ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered"" is a masterful Valentine's Day episode that brings out a lot of great stuff about the odd Xander / Cordelia relationship.""Passion"" follows up strongly on the dare set by ""Surprise"" by killing off a major, likeable character.  ""Killed By Death"" is a genuinely creepy, disturbing horror episode.  ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" is more so, and brings out even more wrinkles in what is going on with Buffy and Angelus.  ""Go Fish"" is another one of those good episodes in the midst of absolutely brilliant episodes; by itself, it's pretty good, and it does do a lot for characters even if it's not up to the brilliance surrounding it.""Becoming"" shows Buffy taken to her final extreme, in many ways the ultimate test for her, and its ending is an amazing Pyrrhic victory.  To kill Jenny Calendar was one thing; killing Angel took real guts.  It is the kind of season finale that would really set Buffy apart from everything else on television at the time.Buffy took the high school metaphors to a really higher level in this season; the ultimate of these was Angel / Angelus.  The relationship between Buffy and Angel was built so well, so sweetly, so entrancingly, that the betrayal was a real shock.  It is perhaps the show's ultimate achievement that it really changed things in this midseason; characters went beyond surprisingly two-dimensional and into bewilderingly three-dimensional.  And it would only get better the next season.Through it all, Sarah Michelle Gellar was the glue that held the show's disparate elements together.  She could be happy, or serious, or fun, or brooding, or lovey-dovey, or heartbroken, all with a tender genuineness.  She gets to run the gamut of emotions, and proves that she can pull anything and everything off in the course of the season.  ""Becoming"" is some of her best work.  Ever.  The pain in that two-parter is real and affecting.The rest of the cast backs her up with style.  David Boreanaz manages both the dark, brooding Angel that we know and love, and the hateful, cynical Angelus with a contrast that is entirely believable and totally real on screen.  You *know* that his character has changed.  The tension between Nicholas Brandon (Xander) and Alyson Hannigan (Willow) is downplayed after a few episodes, but very real throughout.  Their relationships with Oz (Seth Green) and Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), respectively, are also masterfully written.  Anthony Head - a great actor to begin with - gets to add about a hundred interesting layers to his stereotypically British character in this single episode.  In the secondary parts, James Marsters (Spike), Juliet Landau (Drusilla), and Robia LaMorte (Jenny Calendar) all manage to create definitive, real personae who add a lot of the season's unique flavor.  LaMorte also had great chemistry with Head that was never really explored as thoroughly as I would've liked.  It's one of the finest acting ensembles that was ever assembled for a television show.For seven years, Buffy was the best show on television.  Just watch an episode or two from this boxed set, and you'll wonder why more shows this good don't get made.

It came off as rather silly for the most part and I had a difficult time keeping my interest in the silly plots and demons. But I had to keep watching from all of the praise I hear this show gets. It has to get better, I would tell myself. And this Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Second Season did get better. A lot better. From the very first episode, the tone is set different. It is very dark and feels a bit more mature and professionally made. While some of the episodes in the first half of this season fall under being much like season 1, the second half is a completely different show.Buffy the Vampire Slayer - Season 2 is about Buffy's Junior year of high school and most importantly Spike and Drusilla, two very funny and entertaining vampires, taking over Sunnydale! Much to Buffy's dislike, they want to capture her boyfriend Angel. These are two of the best characters this show has ever seen and keep the show rolling with fun and entertainment. I have never enjoyed the dark side so much! Xander and Willow become more interesting with their sprouting love lives, Cordelia and Oz, and Giles even finds love. Buffy continues to be a positive role model for woman and becomes stronger throughout the show. Her love with Angel is an interest and even brilliant aspect of the show. The show really picks up it's pace in the episodes Surprise & Innocence and leads to one of the most amazing episodes of television I have ever seen in my life, Becoming Part 1 & Part 2. Words cannot explain how it falls into place and how emotional the entire ride is. While there might be some silliness to watch in this box set, it is well worth it for the amazement. The highlights are Halloween, Surprise, Innocence, Passion, I Only Have Eyes For You, and Becoming. The weaker episodes consisted of Inca Mummy Girl, Reptile Boy, Bad Eggs, and Go Fish.This show consists of high school and metaphors for the tough times that take place there but I find it completely intelligent and has elements that both adults and teenagers can enjoy. Much work and creativity is put into this show and it obviously has payed off in the long run. This show is considered a classic and this season is why. While many other seasons may be more consistent than this, they are not as memorable or powerful, at least from my viewpoint. This is Buffy's true high peak and I am glad to have enjoyed watching it. I highly recommend watching this over other high school student shows and honestly, most shows, high school or not.",4,Woo!
