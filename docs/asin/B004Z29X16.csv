And, with Robert ""Augustus McCrae"" Duvall in the lead, I just had to see it. So let's start from there.One star for a Great Cast! I think Robert Duvall could be in the next remake of the worst movie ever made and, at the very least, pull it out of the cellar. Not make it the best movie ever but at least give it a measure of respectability. In UTOPIA Duvall does just that. He's the sort of mentor that you'd like to have, regardless of the art or science, so why not golf? Made me proud to be a golfer AND a cowboy and taught me the legitimacy of where the two might meet.Lucas Black does similarly well. Passionate and fiery. And the best golf swing among actors that I have seen of late.Another star for the overall premise. Golf is a head game. True enough. So the whole schtick of seeing and feeling and trusting is absolutely right on. Never mind that there is nothing new here. It's a lesson that bears repeating again and again and again. And, like I already said, bringing golf to the big screen in a Western is truly enjoyable.But that's where it all ended for me. I really tried to completely like this movie but continually ""missed the putt."" It felt like I was watching a weird-golfing-self-improvement-documentary instead of a movie. Mind you, there are places for the one and places for the other but I found the combination of the two more than a bit unsettling and, yes, hokey and predictable!Yes, Luke would change his game in Utopia. Yes, he would catch the fish in Utopia. Yes, he would beat a supposed four-time Masters Champion in his first outing after a total golfing meltdown. But wait! Did he make the putt? The ending was so campy, cheesy and disappointing that I couldn't believe it. And then to have, as Ralphie from A CHRISTMAS STORY put it, ""a crummy commercial!"" at the end in the form of a self-help web site flashing on the screen was absolutely too much! The whole thing would make a great high-pressure infomercial!And all of this goes without saying anything about the screenwriters' all too apparent naivet&eacute; about the bigger picture -- about the grand game of golf itself! (Oh! and if you lack artistic talent and cannot paint realistic trees and landscapes, you might as well give up the game right now!)Yeah.

1434101,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B004Z29X16,C. Long,"[1, 1]","Though this is a ""golf movie"" and the lessons the main character learns are in that backdrop of golf, the lessons go far beyond golf and are applicable to any of us, whether you've played golf or not (I would be in the latter category). At the end of the day, this film has a strong message that it's good to examine your life and see what you're really living for. Is it to win a big tournament? Get in the record books? Be the next superstar? Have the world's wealth? This movie is all about causing us to put life in proper perspective.This is a generally feel-good, ""down home"" southern-feeling (Texas) film with practically no swearing or objectionable content. The story itself, however, I felt left something to be desired. I knew I was in for a bit of a bumpy ride early on in the film when the golfer ends up in this small town after a big defeat, and everyone in town seemingly is watching the Golf sports channel and thus finds out about his defeat. What kind of realism is that??? I know some people watch golf and all, but that's really stretching it...Anyway, this kind of implausible-but-predictable type stuff happens throughout the film. When you come to the place where you start to understand that this movie isn't really about golf, or really even too much about the story, as it is about its main points regarding life, you realize you can cut it a bit of slack. Of course, I didn't really come to that understanding until the very end of the movie...In fact, if it wasn't for the ending, I probably wouldn't recommend the movie. I won't give it away, but it honestly surprised me, especially because the rest of the movie was fairly predictable and full of clich&eacute;s.The film's message is pretty generic and while seen by some as a ""Christian movie"", you won't find any real mention of Jesus. The main character's supposed ""born again"" experience (including with a song playing that boldly uses such words) isn't even remotely representative of a true Biblical ""born again"" experience, but it's more of just a general letting go of the past and what you've been living for to move forward kind of thing. Very generalized and watered-down, etc. Yet, because of the way it was portrayed, it didn't grandly concern me (though I do wish they would have chosen a different song that didn't use the ""born again"" verbage). The movie did a similar thing with its ""see, feel, trust"" thing that is used throughout the movie. It's all kind of generic, vaguely religious type stuff, rather than any real substance. (sidenote: the website that the movie directs people to at the end does have a page that's more specific regarding Jesus and brings more Christian-specific clarity to the movie). The movie's core message of examining your life to see if what you're living for will really matter in the end, I believe is one of great value.The acting and production quality were fine and sufficient and that's about all that can be said about that. Nothing stellar.This movie could be a perfectly fine ""family night"" type of movie, but I'd definitely recommend follow-up discussion to really discuss what some people live for vs. what the Bible says really matters, how we need to ""see, feel, trust"" in what's true and what's true is Jesus who IS the Truth, what being ""born again"" REALLY entails (i.e. repentance, faith in Jesus to save us from our sins, etc.) - that it's a whole new life in Jesus, how we need to strive for excellence in life (do everything well) but not lose perspective, the value of having a Godly mentor-like figure in our lives, etc.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",4,Could be a worthwhile family movie,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,3641,"['golf', 'movie', 'lessons', 'main', 'character', 'learns', 'are', 'backdrop', 'golf', 'lessons', 'go', 'far', 'golf', 'are', 'applicable', ""'ve"", 'played', 'golf', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'latter', 'category', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'strong', 'message', 'good', 'examine', 'life', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'really', 'living', 'win', 'big', 'tournament', 'Get', 'record', 'books', 'Be', 'next', 'superstar', 'Have', 'world', 'wealth', 'movie', 'causing', 'put', 'life', 'proper', 'perspective.This', 'generally', 'feel-good', 'down', 'home', 'southern-feeling', 'Texas', 'film', 'practically', 'swearing', 'objectionable', 'content', 'story', 'however', 'felt', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'knew', 'was', 'bit', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'golfer', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'big', 'defeat', 'everyone', 'town', 'seemingly', 'watching', 'Golf', 'sports', 'channel', 'thus', 'out', 'defeat', 'What', 'kind', 'realism', 'know', 'people', 'watch', 'golf', 'really', 'stretching', 'Anyway', 'kind', 'implausible-but-predictable', 'type', 'stuff', 'film', 'When', 'come', 'place', 'where', 'start', 'understand', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'golf', 'really', 'even', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'main', 'points', 'regarding', 'life', 'realize', 'can', 'cut', 'bit', 'slack', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'understanding', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'ending', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'honestly', 'surprised', 'especially', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'message', 'pretty', 'generic', 'seen', 'Christian', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'real', 'mention', 'Jesus', 'main', 'character', 'supposed', 'born', 'again', 'experience', 'including', 'song', 'playing', 'boldly', 'such', 'words', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'representative', 'true', 'Biblical', 'born', 'again', 'experience', 'more', 'just', 'general', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'move', 'forward', 'kind', 'thing', 'Very', 'generalized', 'watered-down', 'etc', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'did', ""n't"", 'grandly', 'concern', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'different', 'song', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'born', 'again', 'verbage', 'movie', 'did', 'similar', 'thing', 'see', 'feel', 'trust', 'thing', 'used', 'movie', 'kind', 'generic', 'vaguely', 'religious', 'type', 'stuff', 'rather', 'real', 'substance', 'sidenote', 'website', 'movie', 'people', 'end', 'have', 'page', 'more', 'specific', 'regarding', 'Jesus', 'more', 'Christian-specific', 'clarity', 'movie', 'movie', 'core', 'message', 'examining', 'life', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'living', 'will', 'really', 'matter', 'end', 'believe', 'one', 'great', 'value.The', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'were', 'fine', 'sufficient', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Nothing', 'stellar.This', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'family', 'night', 'type', 'movie', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'follow-up', 'discussion', 'really', 'discuss', 'what', 'people', 'live', 'vs.', 'what', 'Bible', 'really', 'matters', 'how', 'need', 'see', 'feel', 'trust', 'what', 'true', 'what', 'true', 'Jesus', 'who', 'Truth', 'what', 'being', 'born', 'again', 'REALLY', 'entails', 'i.e', 'repentance', 'faith', 'Jesus', 'save', 'sins', 'etc', 'whole', 'new', 'life', 'Jesus', 'how', 'need', 'strive', 'excellence', 'life', 'do', 'everything', 'well', 'not', 'lose', 'perspective', 'value', 'having', 'Godly', 'mentor-like', 'figure', 'lives', 'etc.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

1434109,A3JKK3VYJU990R,B004Z29X16,Gary K. McCormick,"[2, 6]","Despite the fact that I'm always up for a good golf movie, I had mixed feelings as I sat down to watch Seven Days in Utopia. I had gotten an invitation to a pre-release screening of the film (It didn't work out; I stood in line for an hour but the theatre filled up before I got in), and I have admired the work of the two principal actors, Robert Duvall and Lucas Black, for years, but my reservations stemmed from having learned that the book on which the movie was based, Golf's Sacred Journey: Seven Days at the Links of Utopia, was yet another rah-rah self-help mental-game-of-golf book, and one which had quite a healthy dose of self-promoting fundamentalist-Christian proselytizing thrown in. I will admit that, based on that knowledge, and because of my skepticism in regards to the whole business (and it is a business - a huge business...) of mental coaching for better golf, I was prepared to dislike the movie before I even sat down.I had a suspicion that my worst fears were going to be realized when the movie opened with a Bible quote. From that opening, a quick segue into the Lucas Chisolm (Lucas Black) character's meltdown on the last hole of a qualifying tournament for the Texas Open PGA Tour golf tournament was followed by a contrived plot mechanism that resulted in his being stranded for a week in the small town of Utopia, Texas, and his delivery into the hands of Johnny Crawford (Robert Duvall), a former PGA Tour player who runs a golf course and driving range.Most of the middle of the movie is taken up with young Lucas Chisolm's tutelage in golf by Johnny Crawford, who uses quaintly unorthodox means to develop Lucas' mental game, exhorting him to ""See It (the shot), Feel It, Trust It"". This portion of the film is actually sweet and kind of ""aw-shucks"" down-homeish, and not too heavy-handed on the ""higher power golf guidance"" stuff - I did rather enjoy the middle part of the film (my enjoyment was helped along by the handsome Texas Hill Country scenery). There is the obligatory small-town romance sub-plot thrown in, as well as a number of flashbacks which fill in the back story on Lucas Chisolm's tournament meltdown and his years of near-abusive training in the game of golf at the hands of his obsessive father (whose poor advice while caddying for Lucas led to the disastrous final hole in the recent tournament). We also learn a bit of Johnny Crawford's history, and how (and why) he left the PGA Tour and landed in a podunk backwater in the Texas Hill Country.The movie starts to break down a bit from there, with a strong hit of Christian fundamentalist ""seek guidance from a higher power"" dogma climbing out of the subtext and coming to the fore, and the final portion of the film, in which young Lucas battles down to the wire with fictional powerhouse pro golfer T. K. Oh (played by real-life PGA Tour pro K.J Choi) at the Valero Texas Open PGA Tour event borders on the laughable. Much is made in the rather scanty special features on the DVD of the ""authenticity"" of the pro golf action in the film, as well as the participation of a number of actual PGA Tour pros--including Stewart Cink, Rich Beem, and Rickie Fowler--when all these guys do is make a few golf swings in some scene-setting shots that establish the fact that yes, we are watching a PGA Tour event. As the competition comes down to an eventual playoff between Lucas Chisolm and ""T.K. Oh"", the two players exchange meaningful glances which are more suggestive of a ""your-place-or-mine"" exchange than subtle ""respect between competitors"" eye contact.There are some quite inexcusable technical glitches in the golf tournament sequences. When ""T.K. Oh"" must make a million-to-1 chip-in from a downhill lie, in thick rough, from above the hole, to a fast, down-sloping green, the ball hits the green and rebounds backwards like a child's rubber bouncy ball, checking its momentum and allowing it to roll down toward the hole in a manner that gives it a legitimate chance of dropping into the hole. It is totally unrealistic behavior for a golf ball; indeed, from that lie, to that green, it is extremely unlikely that even a PGA Tour player could have imparted enough spin to the ball to have it back up even a little bit--it is obviously a CG shot that had the ball added by computer manipulation. Moments later, as T.K is shown putting from below the hole (after the miraculous spinning ball shot didn't go in, but luckily also did not roll all the way off the green to the water), the hole is seen to have the usual white-painted inner rim that is common in Tour events, but the subsequent close-up shot of the ball approaching the hole shows a hole with an unpainted rim - a rather sloppy continuity error.Probably the worst golf-related technical error in the film is the ""putting secret"" that Johnny Crawford shows Lucas Chisolm, and which Chisolm uses in the final seconds of the film. It involves the use of a long-handled putter, but utilized croquet-style, from a position astride the line of the putt, facing the hole. This is an illegal stroke, as defined by Rule 16-1e, which states:e. Standing Astride or on Line of PuttThe player must not make a stroke on the putting green from a stanceastride, or with either foot touching, the line of putt or an extension of thatline behind the ball.When Crawford teaches Chisolm this trick, he tells him that he will ""know when to use it."" Chisolm uses a conventional putter throughout early portion of the tournament, only turning to the broom handle at a crucial, concluding moment. Makes me wonder what club he took out of his bag in order to accommodate the extra putter, and why the Golf Channel talking heads weren't all over the odd equipment choice during the telecast...Another distraction in the golf sequences is the blatant and egregious product placement for Callaway golf products. Balls, caps, bags, clubs--nearly everything in the film that is golf-equipment related is a Callaway product. In the Valero Open segment, which features real-life Golf Channel personalities Kelly Tilghman and Brandel Chamblee covering the tournament, Brandel goes so far as to comment on how well Lucas Chisolm has been driving the ball with his new Callaway Octane driver--an obvious product plug that would never be allowed on the air in a sports telecast.Another, more subtle, Callaway plug is a kind of reverse plug--in the close-up of the T.K. Oh putt that doesn't fall, the logo on his ball is very clearly visible as it rolls to a stop at the edge of the hole--and the ball is seen to be a Titleist. Now, in real life K.J. Choi is a ""Titleist Brand Ambassador"", and perhaps the folks at Acushnet would have balked at him being shown using a competitor's ball, even in a fictitious context, but the character he portrays could have been shown to be using a fictitious ball. The fact that his missed putt is clearly shown to have been made not only with a competitor's ball, but with a ball manufactured by a competitor with whom the Callaway Company has wrangled in court over ball-technology patents (and lost...) is telling, and an obvious dig at Titleist.All things considered, Seven Days in Utopia is only fair as a golf film. The story is, for the most part, clumsy and ill-constructed; it features blatant product placement for Callaway Golf (but don't think that I have a grudge against Callaway--I play a Callaway Big Bertha Titanium 454 driver and a Big Bertha 3-wood that I am very happy with), and it is, as a whole, rather heavy on the mental-game hoo-ha that I find tiresome. The film's saving graces, in my estimation (and the reason it got three stars instead of just two) are the middle portion, which is, as I mentioned above, rather sweet and down-homeish, which I liked; the Texas scenery, and the overall fine performances turned in by most of the actors involved.**********  SPOILER ALERT  **********The following portion of my review contains a spoiler concerning the ending of the film. If you have not yet seen the film being reviewed, and do not wish to learn a vital fact about the end of the story which could spoil your enjoyment of the movie, read no further!Don't say I didn't warn you...The final moment of the film is a blatantly self-promoting gimmick for author David Cook's products related to this movie and the book on which it is based--a thinly-disguised fundamentalist Christian tract masquerading as a book of golf mental-game self-help tips.You aren't shown whether or not Lucas Chisolm's final, potentially tournament-winning putt (made croquet-style, and thus illegal anyway...) drops. The screen fades to black, and you are exhorted to visit the website [...] to find out whether or not he made the putt. The website turns out to be a proselytizing site for David Cook's fundamentalist-Christian life-guidance teachings, as well as a merchandising site for products associated with the film where you are invited to buy balls, bags, etc. (all Callaway, of course...) with the film's ""SFT"" (See It, Feel It, Trust It) logo, and multiple copies of the DVD to give to your friends in order to pass along the message, just as the book encourages the reader to buy and pass along ten copies. And they never do tell you if Lucas made the putt...Unbelievable.",3,"Has Its Moments, But Somewhat Disappointing Overall",1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,9266,"['fact', ""'m"", 'always', 'up', 'good',

When Luke Chisolm's (Black) big chance at a golf tournament ends in a disaster he drives away wanting to give up golf.  When an accident lands him in the town of Utopia he meets a rancher named Johnny Crawford (Duvall) who can teach him about golf, and much more.  I have to admit that many of the ""faith-based"" movies that I have seen start off good then end up being very cheesy where everything works out perfect without any consequences or obstacles to avoid.  This one was heading down that path but veered of sharply and ended up having one of the best endings I have seen in a movie.  All that aside, this is a fantastic family movie that everyone will love and is a rare G rated movie that is good.  While this is a golf movie, this is also so much more and Duvall plays a type of Mr. Myagi character in the way that only he can.  I can go on and on about this movie but I will simply say...this is a must watch.  Overall, one of the best sports movies to come out lately as well as one of the top ten of the year so far.
