Taking into account that Segel also wrote the hitForgetting Sarah Marshall (Two-Disc Unrated Collector's Edition), one can say that he has a talent for writing romantic comedies for guys. Segel perfectly captures a man's perspective in a relationship nowadays, but also writes his female characters as well-rounded and honest, without any misogynistic overtones. Also, he can write very honest, and often dark aspects to a relationship while still making the story funny. An interesting factoid to this film is that the skeevy man who is a threat to Tom (Segel) and Violet's (Blunt) relationship is a British college professor and if you listen to Segel's commentary for ""Sarah Marshall,"" he says that originally Sarah's new boyfriend was not a rock star (Brand), but a British college professor. It wasn't until Russell Brand came in to audition that Segel decided to rewrite the part for Brand. In this film the professor is portrayed by the wonderful Rhys Ifans (who is Welsh in real life). All of the characters in this film are well-written, well-played -- especially by Chris Pratt (NBC's ""Parks and Recreation"") and Alison Brie (NBC's ""Community""/AMC's ""Mad Men"") -- and I especially liked how the story went into a dark place, with the two characters actually separating.

1469990,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIHE0,Chris Kennison,"[5, 8]","""The Five-Year Engagement"" is at first, not what I expected, at least in its entirety. While it is very funny, it is nowhere near the comedy movie that you would expect from Jason Segel (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Bad Teacher, Knocked Up) who wrote, starred and produced this movie, or Judd Apatow who produced ""Engagement"" as well as ""Bridesmaids"", ""Step Brothers"" & ""Pineapple Express"", among others. You can definitely see the similarities in style between ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Engagement"".Emily Blunt has made a career off of dramatic roles in movies like ""Charlie Wilson's War"", ""The Young Victoria"" & ""The Wolfman"". So I was anxious to see her finally do something where she could be funny and less dramatic on screen. I had seen her in a little movie called ""Wild Target"" a few months back and she was hilarious and as the brits would say, `charming', in the film. I was hoping for that and more, but got a bit less than I was expecting.Blunt plays Violet Barnes and Segel plays Tom Solomon, two people with their whole lives ahead of them that meet at a New Year's Eve Party dressed as a giant pink super bunny and Princess Diana. Their chemistry is natural in the film. In fact, what ""Engagement"" does right is be funny, entertaining and quirky, all the while being very real, as far as relationships go. That is the draw of the film. Relationships aren't always glorious, shiny and silhouetted by marvelous sunsets, like portrayed in the movies. They are dirty and at times sad. They are complicated. There is give and take and sometimes the give and the take changes who you are.I do recommend ""The Five-Year Engagement"" but I do this by making sure you know that you aren't going to get ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". The movie is unique in its own right. It is as unique as the characters in the film. The movie may be a little long, but in that time, you will grow close to the people in the film and you will relate to them and see yourselves at many times. ""Engagement"" is more of a commentary on life and choices than a burst out comedy. Emily Blunt and Jason Segel did a splendid job in a film that may disappoint some, but others will find to be endearing and something that could be watched many times.",4,VERY VERY REAL,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,2235,"['Five-Year', 'Engagement', 'first', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'least', 'entirety', 'very', 'funny', 'nowhere', 'comedy', 'movie', 'would', 'expect', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Bad', 'Teacher', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'who', 'wrote', 'starred', 'produced', 'movie', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'who', 'produced', 'Engagement', 'as', 'well', 'Bridesmaids', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'others', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'similarities', 'style', 'Bridesmaids', 'Engagement', '.Emily', 'Blunt', 'made', 'career', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'movies', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'Young', 'Victoria', 'Wolfman', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'finally', 'do', 'something', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'less', 'dramatic', 'screen', 'had', 'seen', 'little', 'movie', 'called', 'Wild', 'Target', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'was', 'hilarious', 'brits', 'would', 'say', 'charming', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'got', 'bit', 'less', 'was', 'expecting.Blunt', 'plays', 'Violet', 'Barnes', 'Segel', 'Tom', 'Solomon', 'two', 'people', 'whole', 'lives', 'ahead', 'meet', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'Party', 'dressed', 'giant', 'pink', 'super', 'bunny', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'chemistry', 'natural', 'film', 'fact', 'what', 'Engagement', 'right', 'be', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'quirky', 'while', 'being', 'very', 'real', 'as', 'far', 'relationships', 'go', 'draw', 'film', 'Relationships', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'glorious', 'shiny', 'silhouetted', 'marvelous', 'sunsets', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'are', 'dirty', 'times', 'sad', 'are', 'complicated', 'give', 'take', 'sometimes', 'give', 'take', 'changes', 'who', 'are.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'Five-Year', 'Engagement', 'do', 'making', 'sure', 'know', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'Bridesmaids', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'movie', 'unique', 'own', 'right', 'as', 'unique', 'characters', 'film', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'long', 'time', 'will', 'grow', 'close', 'people', 'film', 'will', 'relate', 'see', 'yourselves', 'many', 'times', 'Engagement', 'more', 'commentary', 'life', 'choices', 'burst', 'out', 'comedy', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'did', 'splendid', 'job', 'film', 'may', 'disappoint', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'endearing', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'watched', 'many', 'times']",N/A

Through deaths, careers, and education, family and friends begin to wonder whether or not Tom and Violet are ever going to walk down the aisle.  And, you know what, so did I.While the performances are great and the overall story is interesting enough, the biggest problems here are pacing and structure.  The movie is all over the place.  The story feels very episodic as, in one scene while taking care of her niece, Violet is shot in the leg with an arrow.  Obviously, Alex (Chris Pratt; Wanted, ""Parks and Recreation""), Tom's best friend and father to Violet's niece, is pissed that Tom's negligence led to the accidental shooting.  Then suddenly we flash cut to Alex toasting Tom for being a great guy.  This type of editing makes you forget that you're watching a movie and not a soap opera which also helps to contribute to the overlong run time.  Through out the duration of the movie, I kept wanting to either look at the clock or found myself thinking about something else entirely.  Jokes are repeated.  ""Don't worry, they'll live.""  Jump to a funeral.  ""At least no one died"".  Once again, another funeral and still no wedding.  Tom grows a really fake looking, Yosammitti Sam beard anc mustache.

Had I realized that the film was directed by Nicholas Stoller (the man behind Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek), then I may have had a bit more confidence in it.Trailers made it seem like The Five-Year Engagement wasn't going to be so great though. It just looked like every other formulaic R-rated comedy out there. Several people who also attended the screening I went to felt the same way. ""This'll be decent at best,"" we all thought. Thankfully we were gob smacked with something a lot better than okay that was just shy of being really great.The Five-Year Engagement is obviously centered on Tom and Violet, but the supporting cast is so freaking good. The Alex and Suzie characters are hilarious. Suzie has this party girl kind of quality to her, but she's so emotional and really spontaneous. Alex is the typical jock/playboy type of character, but his one-liners are really funny. At their wedding, Alex sings this song to Suzie in Spanish. That alone is fantastic, but his facial expressions just take it to an entirely different level of hilarity.Violet's classmates in college; Ming (Randall Park), Doug (Kevin Hart), and Vaneetha (""The Office""'s Mindy Kaling) have more than their share of stand-out scenes. Tarquin (Brian Posehn) is funny in this really inappropriate way and Bill's (Chris Parnell) fascination with knitting sweaters is a gag that somehow never really gets old.Tom and Violet have so many classic scenes, as well. The bedroom conversation where Tom just wants to be alone is the first that comes to mind. Then there's the fake orgasm scene and Tom's ridiculous apron. The scene people will probably be talking about most though is the scene when Violet and Suzie are having a conversation while imitating Cookie Monster and Elmo. That might be the most humorous sequence in the entire comedy.The Five-Year Engagement isn't just a flat comedy though. It has layers to it. These characters feel like they have some depth to them. There's character development and drama, heartbreak and depression, and compassion and reconnection on top of the comedy. It's a comedy that makes a complete cycle to actually feel like you're witnessing an authentic relationship.The film does feel a bit long though. The second act just drags on and on at times. Some of the psychology bits didn't seem completely necessary to the storyline either and the last hour could've been trimmed down a good twenty to thirty minutes.The Five-Year Engagement runs longer than it should, but is otherwise a very charming R-rated romantic comedy. The way these characters are planned out and the decisions they make feel very human.

The premise of the movie is that Violet and Tom are engaged but postpone getting married because Violet needs to move from San Francisco to Michigan where she has received a teaching fellowship. Dutifully, Tom goes with Violet giving up an outstand job as a chief for making sandwiches at a fast food joint.  Even though Violet and Tom are together, their wedding is postponed while Tom's friend Alex married Violet's sister Suzie and start a family, providing a contrast to the unmarried Violet and Tom.  Violet's stint in Michigan is to last for two years during which time they inexplicably don't get married.  It would have been funnier if they were separate in California and Michigan and had bizarre incidents trying to see each other.  It is hard to understand what is tripping them up on their way to the altar.Scenes in the movie that could have been given a funny twist are grim. Tom goes out hunting with one of his new Michigan friends and shoots a deer in the head. The deer is roped to the roof of his friend's car and slides off so Tom has to put the deer in his car with its head sticking out of the sunroof. It would have been funny if the deer charged Tom or that the deer was not dead but stunned and wakes up in the car with Tom.  The movie is made up of scenes like this that simply fall flat.

1469998,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B005LAIHE0,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","As he previously demonstrated in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" Jason Segel, who co-wrote the script here, has a keen eye for relationships and what does and does not make them tick.  In our minds eye it's all sugar and spice and everything nice on the road from first glance to the altar but nothing could be further from the truth.  The central couple Tom (Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) have a live-in relationship that's virtually blissful so the next logical step would be matrimony.  From the moment Violet says yes to Tom's proposal things start to unravel.  The sticking point is Violet accepting an internship at the behavioral science department at Michigan State University.  Tom has a terrific job as a chef at a ritzy eatery in San Francisco.  It comes down to Tom biting the bullet and letting Violet pursue her dream.  It's not long before resentment and jealousy set in.  Tom degenerates into a Ted Nugent wannabe by hunting big game with a crossbow.  Violet tries to reassure Tom that there's nothing going on between her and her department head(Rhys Ifans).  The pitfalls of the reversal of gender roles is numerous.  I found the film daring in its portrayal warts and all of Tom and Violet's relationship.

1470007,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005LAIHE0,Ed Uyeshima,"[25, 30]","There is such a ramshackle charm to this 2012 romantic comedy that I think the term ""Apatovian"" seems appropriate to describe it since it most definitely feels like the same general creative team led by producer Judd Apatow that guidedKnocked Up,Funny People, andBridesmaids. All the ingredients of the successful Apatovian formula are here - likeable principal characters facing the unpredictability of life's events, the familiar challenges of maintaining relationships in a morass of doubt and temptation, the unexpected detours into graphic humor, the pool of scene-stealing comic actors, the slightly overlong running time (this one clocks in at 124 minutes). Directed by Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall), this particular one focuses on a young couple a year into their relationship - Tom Solomon, a talented sous-chef at a trendy San Francisco restaurant, and Violet Barnes, a psychology graduate student hoping to win a postdoctoral fellowship at Berkeley.The movie opens with Tom popping the question on the bayside terrace of his restaurant and Violet responding affirmatively without hesitation. Thanks to the stars' easy charms, the characters are obviously quite compatible and in love. What happens from that point forward is less about formula and more about just life. Berkeley turns Violet down, but she eventually wins a fellowship in a two-year program at Michigan. Tom willingly gives up his much-sought-after job and moves cross-country with Violet to Ann Arbor. She thrives under the tutelage of the suspiciously charming Prof. Winton Childs amid her motley study group. Tom, on the other hand, flails mightily in trying to fit into his new surroundings, eventually landing a lowly job at a sandwich shop and turning into a grizzly-looking house-husband who takes up hobbies like deer hunting and sweater knitting.While their dilemma doesn't represent new material to the big screen, the treatment of the subject - as co-written by Stoller and star Jason Segel - is uncommonly well handled with plenty of room for awkward moments filled with both humor and honest emotion. If the film drags, as it occasionally does in the last third, it's because they focus a little too liberally on the principals' relationships with the incidental characters. As Tom, Segel has improved considerably as a leading man since his gangly turn inForgetting Sarah Marshall, bringing acuity to his character's increasing struggle between devotion and resentment. Emily Blunt brings a welcome softness and open awkwardness to her heretofore crystalline screen persona, and the two actors achieve a natural rapport that brings a centered relatability to their evolving characters. They are surrounded by a crack company of comic actors.Chris Pratt (Parks & Recreation) brings goofball energy to Tom's wildly inappropriate chef colleague-turned-brother-in-law Alex, while Alison Brie (Mad Men) sports a convincing Brit accent and an off-kilter manner to her hilarious portrayal of Violet's impulsive sister Suzie. One of the film's funniest scenes involves Violet and Suzie having a tense discussion while speaking in the voices of Elmo and Cookie Monster in order to avoid alarming Suzie's daughter. As Childs, Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill) brings the right level of smarminess to his erudite professor, while Mindy Kaling, Kevin Hart, and Randall Park play Violet's fellow PhD candidates with sharp jabs of humor. In a few memorably funny scenes, Brian Posehn plays the oddball sandwich shop owner and Chris Parnell is Tom's too-comfortable fellow house-husband. The movie wraps up on a somewhat pat note rather quickly, but it maintains its goodwill to the very last.",4,Segel and Especially Blunt Bring Easy Charm to an Apatovian Relationship Comedy,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,3676,"['such', 'ramshackle', 'charm', '2012', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'think', 'term', 'Apatovian', 'appropriate', 'describe', 'most', 'definitely', 'feels', 'same', 'general', 'creative', 'team', 'led', 'producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'guidedKnocked', 'Up', 'Funny', 'People', 'andBridesmaids', 'ingredients', 'successful', 'Apatovian', 'formula', 'are', 'here', 'likeable', 'principal', 'characters', 'facing', 'unpredictability', 'life', 'events', 'familiar', 'challenges', 'maintaining', 'relationships', 'morass', 'doubt', 'temptation', 'unexpected', 'detours', 'graphic', 'humor', 'pool', 'scene-stealing', 'comic', 'actors', 'slightly', 'overlong', 'running', 'time', 'one', '124', 'minutes', 'Directed', 'Nicholas', 'Stoller', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'particular', 'one', 'young', 'couple', 'year', 'relationship', 'Tom', 'Solomon', 'talented', 'sous-chef', 'trendy', 'San', 'Francisco', 'restaurant', 'Violet', 'Barnes', 'psychology', 'graduate', 'student', 'hoping', 'win', 'postdoctoral', 'fellowship', 'Berkeley.The', 'movie', 'Tom', 'popping', 'question', 'bayside', 'terrace', 'restaurant', 'Violet', 'responding', 'affirmatively', 'hesitation', 'Thanks', 'stars', 'easy', 'charms', 'characters', 'are', 'obviously', 'quite', 'compatible', 'love', 'What', 'point', 'forward', 'less', 'formula', 'more', 'about', 'just', 'life', 'Berkeley', 'Violet', 'down', 'eventually', 'fellowship', 'two-year', 'program', 'Michigan', 'Tom', 'willingly', 'up', 'much-sought-after', 'job', 'cross-country', 'Violet', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'tutelage', 'suspiciously', 'charming', 'Prof.', 'Winton', 'Childs', 'motley', 'study', 'group', 'Tom', 'other', 'hand', 'flails', 'mightily', 'trying', 'fit', 'new', 'surroundings', 'eventually', 'landing', 'lowly', 'job', 'sandwich', 'shop', 'turning', 'grizzly-looking', 'house-husband', 'who', 'up', 'hobbies', 'deer', 'hunting', 'sweater', 'knitting.While', 'dilemma', ""n't"", 'represent', 'new', 'material', 'big', 'screen', 'treatment', 'subject', 'co-written', 'Stoller', 'star', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'uncommonly', 'well', 'handled', 'plenty', 'room', 'awkward', 'moments', 'filled', 'humor', 'honest', 'emotion', 'film', 'drags', 'occasionally', 'last', 'third', 'focus', 'little', 'too', 'liberally', 'principals', 'relationships', 'incidental', 'characters', 'Tom', 'Segel', 'improved', 'considerably', 'leading', 'man', 'gangly', 'turn', 'inForgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'bringing', 'acuity', 'character', 'increasing', 'struggle', 'devotion', 'resentment', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'welcome', 'softness', 'open', 'awkwardness', 'heretofore', 'crystalline', 'screen', 'persona', 'two', 'actors', 'achieve', 'natural', 'rapport', 'centered', 'relatability', 'evolving', 'characters', 'are', 'surrounded', 'crack', 'company', 'comic', 'actors.Chris', 'Pratt', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'goofball', 'energy', 'Tom', 'wildly', 'inappropriate', 'chef', 'colleague-turned-brother-in-law', 'Alex', 'Alison', 'Brie', 'Mad', 'Men', 'sports', 'convincing', 'Brit', 'accent', 'off-kilter', 'manner', 'hilarious', 'portrayal', 'Violet', 'impulsive', 'sister', 'Suzie', 'One', 'film', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'Violet', 'Suzie', 'having', 'tense', 'discussion', 'speaking', 'voices', 'Elmo', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'order', 'avoid', 'alarming', 'Suzie', 'daughter', 'Childs', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'right', 'level', 'smarminess', 'erudite', 'professor', 'Mindy', 'Kaling', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Randall', 'Park', 'play', 'Violet', 'fellow', 'PhD', 'candidates', 'sharp', 'jabs', 'humor', 'few', 'memorably', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Brian', 'Posehn', 'oddball', 'sandwich', 'shop', 'owner', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'Tom', 'too-comfortable', 'fellow', 'house-husband', 'movie', 'up', 'somewhat', 'pat', 'note', 'rather', 'quickly', 'goodwill', 'very', 'last']",N/A

Those kind of roles are meant to be done by actors like Zach Galifanakis or Jonah Hill or Jack Black but Segal isn't exactly your typical unemployed stoner who sits out on a couch all day long. Anyway, I was very curious what they would do with this film. Of course it is a chick film but it is also relevant for considering my age. I saw this last night and there were atleast three scenes which had me laughing out loud. The story is very curiously tuned just enough to pique your interest and keep you in it. Some may find sitting through 2 hours 11 minutes a bit too long but I don't think they would sustain the title of the film and the message if they didn't make it that long. At around 1 hour 30 minutes I did look at my clock thinking where are they going to take this now. But then that is my only criticism. I loved the acting, it was outstanding.

Tom Solomon (Jason Segal) and Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt) are a happy couple who live in San Francisco. Tom and Violet are trying to plan a wedding, but before plans are final, Violet gets accepted into a psychology program at the University of Michigan. Tom, who is a chef at a fancy restaurant, isn't pleased when he finds out there are no fancy restaurants for him to work at in Michigan. Years pass, and Violet finds out the psychology program is going to last longer than expected, so wedding plans will have to wait a little bit longer, and when Tom finds out, he gets sodisillusioned with his life.Jason Segal and Emily Blunt work well together, and are a likeable pair, with a warm-like chemistry. The writing is funny and smart, but then there are times when it's not. There are times where you'll laugh, won't laugh, and don't know if you should laugh; the movie tries so hard to be funny when most of it is just awkward instead. The supporting cast of Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) and Violet's sister Suzie (Alison Brie) do an awesome job, many times stealing the show. There's a lot of uniqueness put into the film in terms of props and costumes, and I couldn't wait to see what other unique things were going to show up.The Five-Year Engagement feels like a long waiting game; at 124 minutes, you'll find yourself ready for the film to be over with. The film doesn't do a good job in explaining what's stopping Tom and Violet from getting married, which causes the main story to be rather uninteresting and feel sloppy. I was more interested in hearing what the next joke was going to be, and what the next new unique thing was going be, rather than caring if they were ever going to get married. For a movie that's not about sports, I couldn't help but constantly feel overwhelmed with product placements; I felt like I was watching commercials for the University of Michigan, the movie Ratatouille, Michigan restaurants, and some classic metal bands, thus resulting in getting a thumbs down. If you want to laugh a few times, but feel bored at the same time, I'm going to mildly recommend a 'rent.'

Jason Segal's chef plays opposite Emily Blunt's psychology doctorate student. Soon after they get engaged she is offered her dream spot in a doctorate program in Michigan, so he gives up his promising career as a chef in San Francisco to follow her there. The change leaves their relationship unbalanced, and they can never quite regain their footing, and commit to finally marrying. The movie traces their ups and downs, and the route they finally take to the alter.There's a lot of relationship truth in this movie, but not a lot of laughs. Some wacky scenes feel thrown in to try and bring the laugh factor up but end up feeling out of place - one in which Jason Segal's character is serving venison stew and home-made honey in deer hooves comes to mind. I found the chemistry between Segal and Blunt uneven also - at times it worked, but in other scenes they felt awkward with each other. I think their comedic strengths are different - hers is timing and a sharp tongue while his is more goofy. My favorite comedic scene of Blunt's was actually not with Segal but with co-star Alison Brie (Community, Mad Men), who plays her sister, in a scene where they are impersonating Elmo and Cookie Monster while having a relationship heart-to-heart.So this one had its moments, but overall felt a bit schizophrenic. 3-stars it is.",3,Rambling - Good Concept and Cast But Gets Lost Along the Way,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,1420,"['movie', 'great', 'cast', 'concept', 'lost', 'way', 'up', 'very', 'uneven', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'chef', 'opposite', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'psychology', 'doctorate', 'student', 'Soon', 'get', 'engaged', 'offered', 'dream', 'spot', 'doctorate', 'program', 'Michigan', 'up', 'promising', 'career', 'chef', 'San', 'Francisco', 'follow', 'there', 'change', 'relationship', 'unbalanced', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'regain', 'footing', 'commit', 'finally', 'marrying', 'movie', 'ups', 'downs', 'route', 'finally', 'take', 'alter.There', 'lot', 'relationship', 'truth', 'movie', 'not', 'lot', 'laughs', 'wacky', 'scenes', 'feel', 'thrown', 'try', 'bring', 'laugh', 'factor', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'place', 'one', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'character', 'serving', 'venison', 'stew', 'home-made', 'honey', 'deer', 'hooves', 'mind', 'found', 'chemistry', 'Segal', 'Blunt', 'uneven', 'also', 'times', 'worked', 'other', 'scenes', 'felt', 'awkward', 'other', 'think', 'comedic', 'strengths', 'are', 'different', 'hers', 'timing', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'more', 'goofy', 'favorite', 'comedic', 'scene', 'Blunt', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'Segal', 'co-star', 'Alison', 'Brie', 'Community', 'Mad', 'Men', 'who', 'sister', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'impersonating', 'Elmo', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'having', 'relationship', 'heart-to-heart.So', 'one', 'had', 'moments', 'overall', 'felt', 'bit', 'schizophrenic', '3-stars']",N/A

I liked the big cups that looked like coconuts and the big serving utensils with the animal skins on them. The big bowl of wild game stew. It was fun.

Oleson,"[1, 4]","Teaming up again in another adult comedy, Nicholas Stoller (director, co-writer) and Jason Segel (co-writer, actor) prove that ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was no fluke.  They manage to have just the right amount of raunchiness mixed in with over-the-top and subtle humor and enough drama and sweetness to keep most people happy.  Tom (Segel) is a San Francisco chef, on the verge of getting his own restaurant, who proposes to his girlfriend of one year, Violet.  Violet (great as usual Emily Blunt) is an ex-pat Brit working as an educator in the field of psychology.  She obtains a grant to obtain her doctorate at the University of Michigan and Tom gives up his own career opportunity to move with Violet to Ann Arbor.After a struggle with Michigan winters and Tom's inability to get a decent job, he descends to the brink of craziness with the help of a househusband he meets played by Chris Parnell.  Violet on the other hand is very successful, perhaps aided by her boss (Rhys Ifans) who has a crush on her.  Tom and Violet's pre-marital struggles keep the wedding date constantly moving.  Complicating matters is the pressure from both sides of the family.  Violet's London based family is losing aging members left and right and Tom's Jewish-rooted parents are longing for a traditional marriage.Perhaps the funniest pair however is Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt from TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") and Violet's sister (Alison Brie from TV's ""Mad Men"" and ""Community"").  At an early rehearsal dinner the unlikely couple hooks up, quickly marry in a beautifully conceived wedding and have a couple kids before Tom and Violet can pick out their own wedding cake.  The movie runs long at a little over 2 hours which might have been forgivable if we spent a little more time with Alex and Suzie (Brie) or Lauren Weedman's Chef Sally, Tom's lesbian (""but I voted against California's gay marriage act"") boss.  Judd Apatow is one of the producers and we can certainly see his influence.  Ultimately the movie is a worthy addition to the genre, even if we get a little too much of Tom and Violet's Michigan struggles and that the humor misses some of the time.",4,3 1/2 stars for a worthy addition to the raunchy dramedy collection,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,2165,"['Teaming', 'up', 'again', 'adult', 'comedy', 'Nicholas', 'Stoller', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'co-writer', 'actor', 'prove', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'was', 'fluke', 'manage', 'have', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'raunchiness', 'mixed', 'over-the-top', 'subtle', 'humor', 'enough', 'drama', 'sweetness', 'keep', 'most', 'people', 'happy', 'Tom', 'Segel', 'San', 'Francisco', 'chef', 'verge', 'getting', 'own', 'restaurant', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'year', 'Violet', 'Violet', 'great', 'usual', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'ex-pat', 'Brit', 'working', 'educator', 'field', 'psychology', 'grant', 'obtain', 'doctorate', 'University', 'Michigan', 'Tom', 'up', 'own', 'career', 'opportunity', 'move', 'Violet', 'Ann', 'Arbor.After', 'struggle', 'Michigan', 'winters', 'Tom', 'inability', 'get', 'decent', 'job', 'brink', 'craziness', 'help', 'househusband', 'played', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'Violet', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'successful', 'perhaps', 'aided', 'boss', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'who', 'crush', 'Tom', 'Violet', 'pre-marital', 'struggles', 'keep', 'wedding', 'date', 'constantly', 'moving', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'pressure', 'sides', 'family', 'Violet', 'London', 'based', 'family', 'losing', 'aging', 'members', 'left', 'right', 'Tom', 'Jewish-rooted', 'parents', 'are', 'longing', 'traditional', 'marriage.Perhaps', 'funniest', 'pair', 'however', 'Tom', 'best', 'friend', 'Alex', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'TV', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'Violet', 'sister', 'Alison', 'Brie', 'TV', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Community', 'early', 'rehearsal', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'up', 'quickly', 'marry', 'beautifully', 'conceived', 'wedding', 'have', 'couple', 'kids', 'Tom', 'Violet', 'can', 'pick', 'out', 'own', 'wedding', 'cake', 'movie', 'long', 'little', '2', 'hours', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'forgivable', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'Alex', 'Suzie', 'Brie', 'Lauren', 'Weedman', 'Chef', 'Sally', 'Tom', 'lesbian', 'voted', 'California', 'gay', 'marriage', 'act', 'boss', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'one', 'producers', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'influence', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'worthy', 'addition', 'genre', 'even', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Tom', 'Violet', 'Michigan', 'humor', 'time']",N/A

Jason Segel and Judd Apatown have teamed up before on ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", which worked out quite well for them, so why not do it again. In the marketing of this movie, a major emphasis was put on the fact that this is ""from the producers of Bridesmades"". The latter is of course now the gold standard for smart and funny romantic comedies from Hollywood. Would this movie live up to that standard?""The Five-Year Engagement"" (122 min.) brings the story of Tom (played by Jason Segel) and Violet (played by Emily Blunt), who are in love and decide to get engaged. However, because of circumstances (primarily Violet being offered a significant job opportunity in academics at U of Muchigan), the couple moves away from San Francisco, where Tom was a successful sous-chef, on the verge of making it big as a chef. It comes as no surprise that Tom is deeply unhappy in Michigan, as he cannot find a satisfying position as a sophisticated chef in Ann Arbor. This is the key part of the movie, and in this sense, the movie's title is really misleading. It's not about being engaged or falling in or out of live, but it's about what happens when a guy gives up his career ambitions to allow his girl/gf/fiancee/wife to fulfill HER career ambitions. Much hilarious scenes ensue. At a certain point, Tom admits to Violet that he is deeply unhappy, there is much shouting back and forth, and Tom says ""I think I want to be alone now"", at which point Violet leaves their bed, ready to go sleep on the couch. Tom: ""Where are you going?"" Violet: ""But I thought you wanted to have time to yourself?"" Tom: ""Yea, I want to be by myself with you here, come back!"". It's a golden moment in the movie.I don't think I will shock anyone when I say that the movie has a ""happy ending"", I mean this IS still Hollywood main fare after all. (Same complaint I have with that other recent excellent romcom ""Friends With Kids"".) In the end I guess that's ok. I enjoyed the movie quite a lot, up until the very end when it became very predictable how it all was going to end. But I sensed that the theatre audience really liked the movie. Special mention for Emily Blunt's delightful performance as Violet, simply oozing charm all over. Bottom line: no, this is not as good as ""Bridemades"" but then again I think few romcoms will live up to that standard. I quite enjoyed ""The Five-Year Engagement"" for what it is.

It is one of those movies that I will be quoting and mentioning the funny bits for years to come.After Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I Love You Man, I thought Jason Segel's character would be another of those broadly drawn, vaguely gross and occasionally clueless dudes.  Instead he is very believable, somewhat subdued and quite attractive, but not in a conventional way.  It really is quite an impressive performance.  Emily Blunt has glammed down a bit, if that term makes sense, so we are able to witness the evolution of a very realistic relationship between two people who love each other very much and whose own ambitions create barriers to their being together.  Although the movie is often quite funny, Judd Apatow shows a refreshing unwillingness to go for the cheap joke.  This couple struggles together to work it out, not too differently from the way ""typical"" young couples today have their struggles.  People have to deal with their attractions to others, they get drunk and make stupid decisions, they give up jobs and comfortable lifestyles to move to where their loved one is, they try it apart but never stop loving each other.I am not a fan of Bridesmaids and hate that it is being held up as the modern prototype for a comedy with strong female characters.  It is just way too gross for me.  So I approached the Unrated version of The Five-Year Engagement with some trepidation.  Even with the extra envelope-pushing, I still felt like it was a relatively realistic and touching portrayal of a modern relationship.It has been mentioned in previous reviews, but I do feel that the conversation between Violet and her sister in which they are both using Sesame Street voices is a little piece of comic genius.  Not only is it funny, but it beautifully encapsulates these characters and also creates a critical plot point.  You can't ask for more from a scene.  I also loved the ending.  It could have seemed rushed and abrupt, but I really thought it was perfect and organic.  The movie is longish but the pacing seems just about right.

Good for a rental when you have a boring night and nothing good to watch. That being said, it felt forced. There was really very little chemistry between Segal and Blunt, the relationship was so predictable I ended up cheering against them, and that's a new experience for me. How can you cheer for a girl who's just rotten and a guy who's a complete pushover? The acting was horrid, that's all I'll say about it.There was a fair amount of comedy mixed in with this romantic drama, but the comedy just didn't work. It was crude in typical Apatow fashion and although it usually works somehow it just didn't in this movie. You have the makings of a clever romantic comedy and instead you have this boring long drama with random profanity and dirty humor thrown in. There were some parts that made me laugh but I probably was entertained for about 5% of this movie.Has Apatow never heard of deleted scenes? Seriously there were quite a few scenes that could have been cut out of this. There wasn't two hours of content here guys, why is this a two hour movie? The arrow scene was around five minutes of time for a ten second payout which honestly wasn't worth it. That's a metaphor for the entire movie. 2 hours of forced pain for a lame five minute payout.

1470105,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005LAIHE0,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This is an interesting hit and miss romantic comedy aka ""chick flick."" Tom (Jason Segel) is a chef in San Francisco who is engaged to Violet (Emily Blunt) a Brit. They meet at a costume New Year Eves party and don't worry if you miss it, they replay it (definite chick flick giveaway).In a role reversal, he gives up his career so she can do her doctorate studies at the University of Michigan for a couple of years. They put off getting married while Michigan turns Tom into Grizzly Adams. Meanwhile Susan (Alison Brie) who is Violet's sister gets married to the somewhat crude Alex (Chris Pratt) a friend and co-worker of Tom.The humor moves from clever to awkward to bad. There is a doughnut metaphor that starts in the middle of the film, that has moments of cleverness. The extreme overreaction of the main characters due to minor difficulties is perhaps the downfall of the film. While the film needed to create conflict, it did so in an inane manner that was neither funny nor realistic. Emily Blunt gives us a good performance.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, male rear nudity (Jason Segel...another chick flick giveaway) 3 1/2 stars on the girl's film scale. Pale in comparison to ""Bridesmaids.""",4,I WANT TO BE ALONE...

I love Emily Blunt, and the rest of the cast is fine, but sorry, I'm not a fan of Jason Segal and pretty much every movie he's in, he pretty much cuts into my enjoyment of the film.

One year after they first met Tom (Segel) proposes to Violet (Blunt) and the excitement of planning a wedding begins. Soon after the excitement starts to wind down other problems starts to come up. When Violet gets her dream job they decide to put the plans on hold and move across country. Months turn to years and little by little the stresses start to affect the couple. I am a pretty big Jason Segel fan and I was looking forward to this movie. While this is very very funny with some great quotable lines there is also a lot of heart in this which makes it a great movie to watch. The drama scenes fit in perfectly and they do not slow down the movie or make you forget it's a comedy which is the problem with most comedies like this. There are a few classic scenes in this (the Cookie Monster vs. Elmo argument is my favorite) and this is one that you can watch more then once and still laugh at every time. I may be hyping this up to much for you know but this is the type of movie that couples can watch together and both enjoy for different reasons. I highly recommend this. I give it an A.",4,A very funny comedy with a lot of heart. A great date movie that both men and women will love. I highly recommend.
