736866,ANQC9L264HAZV,B000089RT0,Alessandro Gianna,"[14, 17]","Like someone else said in a review above, this was a tough season to swallow.Let's start with the mytharc. Since the vast majority of the co-conspirators were dead by Season 7, Chris Carter and his crew thought it was better to destroy the mytharc all together than develop a new Syndicate with those who remined, like the CSM, Krycek and Covarrubias. What started like a promising new mythology in Biogenesis (Sixth Season's finale) turned into a messy business in Sixth Extintion I and II. Then by mid season we learn that after all this years, and after so many said otherwise (the ABH, Cassandra Spender, the WMM) Mulder's quest for his sister was over before he ever started.Now the ""Standalones"". Season Seven had two of the lowest points in the show's history: ""Fight Club"" and ""First Person Shooter"", how these two made it to be aired is beyond me. Other questionable episodes are Chimera, Signs and Wonders, Hungry, Orison, last few minutes of Milennium and the final 30 seconds of Hollywood A.D.Then there was David Duchovny's attitude toward playing Fox Mulder. He had already shown in Season Six some boredom shine through his acting, but in this season (and the few episodes he appeared on the next two seasons) it was too much. In many ways Mulder was not Mulder anymore, and not only because of his acting, but also because many scripts got the character all wrong.But it was not all bad in Season Seven. Episodes like Gillian Anderson's All Things, the COPS crossover ""X-COPS"", Je Souhaite, Theef, Brand X, or even Rush helped to remember how good this show was.And Requiem was hands down the best mythology episode this season, and one of my top three season enders. It's also good to know that the follow ups to Requiem were good episodes... all before the show changed the possible alien invasion for some crazy ""super soldiers"", but I'm getting ahead of myself here.All in all the box is a must for die-hard fans, and even those who aren't should check how high was the production value of this one-hour television show. I hope this new set is packed with extras as good as those of previous boxes. Gillian Anderson's and Vince Gillgan's comments should be good. It's a shame Fox doesn't allow two or more to comment on a single episode anymore (like they did with Jose Chung's on the third season).",3,On par with the Ninth Season,1044576000,"02 7, 2003",2003,2319,"['someone', 'else', 'said', 'review', 'was', 'tough', 'season', 'swallow.Let', 'start', 'mytharc', 'vast', 'majority', 'co-conspirators', 'were', 'dead', 'Season', '7', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'crew', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'destroy', 'mytharc', 'together', 'develop', 'new', 'Syndicate', 'who', 'remined', 'CSM', 'Krycek', 'Covarrubias', 'What', 'started', 'promising', 'new', 'mythology', 'Biogenesis', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'finale', 'turned', 'messy', 'business', 'Sixth', 'Extintion', 'II', 'Then', 'mid', 'season', 'learn', 'years', 'so', 'many', 'said', 'otherwise', 'ABH', 'Cassandra', 'Spender', 'WMM', 'Mulder', 'quest', 'sister', 'was', 'ever', 'started.Now', 'Standalones', 'Season', 'Seven', 'had', 'two', 'lowest', 'points', 'show', 'history', 'Fight', 'Club', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'how', 'two', 'made', 'be', 'aired', 'Other', 'questionable', 'episodes', 'are', 'Chimera', 'Signs', 'Wonders', 'Hungry', 'Orison', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'Milennium', 'final', '30', 'seconds', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.Then', 'was', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'attitude', 'playing', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'had', 'already', 'shown', 'Season', 'Six', 'boredom', 'shine', 'acting', 'season', 'few', 'episodes', 'appeared', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'many', 'ways', 'Mulder', 'was', 'not', 'Mulder', 'anymore', 'not', 'only', 'acting', 'also', 'many', 'scripts', 'got', 'character', 'wrong.But', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'Season', 'Seven', 'Episodes', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'All', 'Things', 'COPS', 'crossover', 'X-COPS', 'Je', 'Souhaite', 'Theef', 'Brand', 'X', 'even', 'Rush', 'helped', 'remember', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'Requiem', 'was', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'mythology', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'top', 'three', 'season', 'enders', 'also', 'good', 'know', 'follow', 'ups', 'Requiem', 'were', 'good', 'episodes', 'show', 'changed', 'possible', 'alien', 'invasion', 'crazy', 'super', 'soldiers', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'here.All', 'box', 'must', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'even', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'should', 'check', 'how', 'high', 'was', 'production', 'value', 'one-hour', 'television', 'show', 'hope', 'new', 'set', 'packed', 'extras', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'boxes', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Vince', 'Gillgan', 'comments', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'shame', 'Fox', ""n't"", 'allow', 'two', 'more', 'comment', 'single', 'episode', 'anymore', 'did', 'Jose', 'Chung', 'third', 'season']",The X-Files: Season 7

736869,AKQFIKZNANJV3,B000089RT0,Andrea K. Johnson,"[3, 4]","I've been rewatching some of the old X-Files episodes in anticipation of the movie. These slim pack versions of the X-Files finally came down enough in price for them to be within my financial reach at one of the discount chains. As ever, I find myself doing a lot of skipping around. I never did much care for the myth-arc episodes or the dreadful, pretentious voice overs at the beginning of those episodes that I presume Chris Carter wrote. I liked even less the lack of attention to character continuity from episode to episode. What was bad about the X-Files was bad in this season and what was good about the show was very good here. We have awful, pretentious voice overs and confusing, muddled myth-arc stuff in ""The Sixth Extinction"" and ""Amor Fati"" and somewhat in ""En Ami."" I think the writers had written themselves into a corner and were scrambling to tie up loose ends before David Duchovny was no longer under contract. It showed, particularly in the way they tried to wrap up the Samantha story arc in ""Sein Und Zeit"" and ""Closure."" No one knows what the heck happened to Samantha and the walk-in story line didn't make any more sense on viewing six years or so after I last watched it. It does make a certain amount of emotional sense and it was nice to see Mulder embracing the ghost of the 14-year-old Samantha in the final scene. Just try not to think too hard while watching this episode or see all the holes in the plot. I ended up fast-forwarding a lot through that episode to the scenes I liked and ignoring the ones I didn't. There are a few gems in this season. ""X-Cops"" is still hilarious, almost as good as ""Bad Blood"" from the fifth season, which I still rewatch when I need a boost in mood. ""Hollywood A.D."" and ""Je Souhaite"" are also very nice stand-alone episodes. ""Millennium"" is great, if only because I liked the TV series and it was nice to see Frank Black in that last scene with his little girl and the Mulder-Scully kiss. No, the world didn't end. Too bad Chris Carter didn't figure that out a few seasons before that. Best of all is ""all things,"" the episode written and directed by Gillian Anderson. The amount of thought that went into every scene, every sound, into every move made by every character, was very evident. I also appreciated the comments made by the actress that accompany this episode. I remember thinking ""Yeah, that's probably why she did such and such"" when I first watched it eight years ago and it's nice to know that I was right. It also helped that the music was easy on the ears and the decor was easy on the eyes. I liked her take on Scully as a complete human being, one who acted in certain ways and had conflicting feelings about spirituality and religion and Mulder and her old love Daniel. It's really a pity that Anderson wasn't given a chance to write more episodes. And of course this was the episode where Scully and Mulder slept together and probably where William was conceived. Since I watch more for character development and the relationships between the characters, this episode is a real jewel, but this DVD is worth purchasing for fans of all persuasions, those who like the myth-arc and those who don't.",5,"A few great episodes, a few good ones, a few that make you go huh?",1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,3188,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'rewatching', 'old', 'X-Files', 'episodes', 'anticipation', 'movie', 'slim', 'pack', 'versions', 'X-Files', 'finally', 'came', 'down', 'enough', 'price', 'be', 'financial', 'reach', 'one', 'discount', 'chains', 'ever', 'find', 'doing', 'lot', 'skipping', 'never', 'did', 'much', 'care', 'myth-arc', 'episodes', 'dreadful', 'pretentious', 'voice', 'overs', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'presume', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'wrote', 'liked', 'even', 'less', 'lack', 'attention', 'character', 'continuity', 'episode', 'episode', 'What', 'was', 'bad', 'X-Files', 'was', 'bad', 'season', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'have', 'awful', 'pretentious', 'voice', 'overs', 'confusing', 'muddled', 'myth-arc', 'stuff', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'Amor', 'Fati', 'somewhat', 'En', 'Ami', 'think', 'writers', 'had', 'written', 'corner', 'were', 'scrambling', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'contract', 'showed', 'particularly', 'way', 'tried', 'wrap', 'up', 'Samantha', 'story', 'arc', 'Sein', 'Und', 'Zeit', 'Closure', 'one', 'what', 'heck', 'happened', 'Samantha', 'walk-in', 'story', 'line', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'viewing', 'six', 'years', 'so', 'last', 'watched', 'make', 'certain', 'amount', 'emotional', 'sense', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Mulder', 'embracing', 'ghost', '14-year-old', 'Samantha', 'final', 'scene', 'Just', 'try', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'watching', 'episode', 'see', 'holes', 'plot', 'ended', 'up', 'fast-forwarding', 'lot', 'episode', 'scenes', 'liked', 'ignoring', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'few', 'gems', 'season', 'X-Cops', 'still', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'Bad', 'Blood', 'fifth', 'season', 'still', 'rewatch', 'when', 'need', 'boost', 'mood', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.', 'Je', 'Souhaite', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'Millennium', 'great', 'only', 'liked', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Frank', 'Black', 'last', 'scene', 'little', 'girl', 'Mulder-Scully', 'kiss', 'No', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'Too', 'bad', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'few', 'seasons', 'Best', 'things', 'episode', 'written', 'directed', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'amount', 'thought', 'went', 'scene', 'sound', 'move', 'made', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'evident', 'also', 'appreciated', 'comments', 'made', 'actress', 'episode', 'remember', 'thinking', 'Yeah', 'probably', 'why', 'did', 'such', 'such', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'nice', 'know', 'was', 'right', 'also', 'helped', 'music', 'was', 'easy', 'ears', 'decor', 'was', 'easy', 'eyes', 'liked', 'take', 'Scully', 'complete', 'human', 'being', 'one', 'who', 'acted', 'certain', 'ways', 'had', 'conflicting', 'feelings', 'spirituality', 'religion', 'Mulder', 'old', 'love', 'Daniel', 'really', 'pity', 'Anderson', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'write', 'more', 'episodes', 'course', 'was', 'episode', 'where', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'slept', 'together', 'probably', 'where', 'William', 'was', 'conceived', 'watch', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'relationships', 'characters', 'episode', 'real', 'jewel', 'DVD', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'fans', 'persuasions', 'who', 'myth-arc', 'who', 'do', ""n't""]",The X-Files: Season 7

Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...The X-Files (Season 7) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""The Sixth Extinction"" in which Scully travels to Africa in an attempt to unravel the meaning of a series of hieroglyphics inscribed on an alien spacecraft discovered just off Ivory Coast. Meanwhile, Mulder seems to be going insane, and he enlists the help of others to find out what's wrong with him... Other notable episodes from Season 7 include ""Orison"" in which a reverend who's befriended an inmate helps the man escape from prison, but instead of turning to God, the convict sets his sights on revenge against Scully...Below is a list of episodes included on The X-Files (Season 7) DVD:Episode 140 (The Sixth Extinction)Episode 141 (The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati)Episode 142 (Hungry)Episode 143 (Millennium)Episode 144 (Rush)Episode 145 (The Goldberg Variation)Episode 146 (Orison)Episode 147 (The Amazing Maleeni)Episode 148 (Signs and Wonders)Episode 149 (Sein und Zeit)Episode 150 (Closure)Episode 151 (X-COPS)Episode 152 (First Person Shooter)Episode 153 (Theef)Episode 154 (En Ami)Episode 155 (Chimera)Episode 156 (All Things)Episode 157 (Brand X)Episode 158 (Hollywood A.D.)Episode 159 (Fight Club)Episode 160 (Je Souhaite)Episode 161 (Requiem)The DVD Report",5,A unique and original TV drama series...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3392,"['Nominated', '12', 'Golden', 'Globes', '61', 'Emmys', 'including', '4', 'Outstanding', 'Drama', 'Series', 'X-Files', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'popular', 'science-fiction', 'drama', 'Premiering', 'Fall', '1993', 'Fox', 'Network', 'home', 'popular', 'programs', 'such', 'Simpsons', '1989', 'King', 'Hill', '1997', 'X-Files', 'created', 'entire', 'fictional', 'world', 'conspiracies', 'secret', 'organizations', 'building', 'legion', 'fanatic', 'followers', 'devoted', 'series', 'Trekkies', 'are', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Creator', 'Cris', 'Carter', 'former', 'writer', 'numerous', 'TV', 'shows', 'late-80s/early-90s', 'Nanny', '1993', 'one', 'example', 'together', 'finest', 'aspects', 'suspense-laden', 'spy', 'novels', 'alien', 'science', 'fiction', 'result', 'one', 'top', 'sci-fi', 'franchises', 'ever', 'produced', 'spawning', 'own', 'line', 'merchandise', 'even', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Future', '1998', 'nine', 'successful', 'seasons', 'credit', 'X-Files', 'one', 'longest-running', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'television', 'history', 'X-Files', 'exploits', 'four', 'FBI', 'agents', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'series', 'unsolved', 'mysterious', 'cases', 'known', 'only', 'X-Files', 'FBI', 'special', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'John', 'Doggett', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'are', 'primary', 'agents', 'investigating', 'unusual', 'cases', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'solved', 'conventional', 'investigatory', 'methods', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'particular', 'play', 'prominent', 'roles', 'series', 'partnership', 'friendship', 'two', 'develop', 'course', 'series', 'tone', 'investigations', 'paranormal', 'Scully', 'medical', 'doctor', 'playing', 'skeptic', 'Mulder', 'deeply', 'held', 'beliefs', 'widespread', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'alien', 'abductions', 'course', 'series', 'X-Files', 'wide-range', 'frightening', 'mysterious', 'subjects', 'killer', 'insects', 'secret', 'world', 'government', 'organizations', 'colonization', 'Earth', 'parasitic', 'aliens', 'so', 'doing', 'own', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'original', 'blend', 'creativity', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'X-Files', 'Season', '7', 'DVD', 'number', 'suspense', 'riddled', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'Scully', 'Africa', 'attempt', 'unravel', 'meaning', 'series', 'hieroglyphics', 'inscribed', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'discovered', 'just', 'Ivory', 'Coast', 'Meanwhile', 'Mulder', 'be', 'going', 'insane', 'help', 'others', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '7', 'include', 'Orison', 'reverend', 'who', 'befriended', 'inmate', 'man', 'escape', 'prison', 'instead', 'turning', 'God', 'convict', 'sights', 'revenge', 'Scully', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'X-Files', 'Season', '7', 'DVD', 'Episode', '140', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'Episode', '141', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'II', 'Amor', 'Fati', 'Episode', '142', 'Hungry', 'Episode', '143', 'Millennium', 'Episode', '144', 'Rush', 'Episode', '145', 'Goldberg', 'Variation', 'Episode', '146', 'Orison', 'Episode', '147', 'Amazing', 'Maleeni', 'Episode', '148', 'Signs', 'Wonders', 'Episode', '149', 'Sein', 'Zeit', 'Episode', '150', 'Closure', 'Episode', '151', 'X-COPS', 'Episode', '152', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'Episode', '153', 'Theef', 'Episode', '154', 'En', 'Ami', 'Episode', '155', 'Chimera', 'Episode', '156', 'All', 'Things', 'Episode', '157', 'Brand', 'X', 'Episode', '158', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.', 'Episode', '159', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Episode', '160', 'Je', 'Souhaite', 'Episode', '161', 'Requiem', 'DVD', 'Report']",The X-Files: Season 7

736873,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B000089RT0,Busy Body,"[8, 9]","With the phenomenal success of Season Six of The X-Files, the new fans who were with the show since viewing the theatrical release of the movie in the summer of 1998 and old fans alike awaited the Seventh Season with bated breath. The Seventh Season was a time of re-invention for The X-Files. Many long-running story arcs and well-known characters made an exit, and new themes were explored. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny also wrote and directed episodes which uncovered more of Scully and Mulder's past histories and, in the process, revealed new depths of characterization.However, the biggest question concerning closure was whether the show's Seventh Season would be its last. With inflating egos and movie roles flooding in, many of the show's cast (inparticular David Duchovny) became increasingly dissatisfied with their roles in the sci-fi phenomenon. This could be disguised early on through moody character personalities, but towards the end it was inevitable that the show was running out of steam.At the end of the Sixth Season, Mulder lay in a neurological unit after his brain was infected by powerful rubbings from the shell of a space craft that had emerged from the sea of Africa's Ivory Coast in the gripping finale &quot;Biogenesis.&quot; The Seventh Season opened with the two-parter &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati&quot; in which this plot line was put to rest after the subject proved too powerful for even Scully to decipher. These are the first two mythology episodes of the season, which are followed by the superb &quot;Sein Und Seit.&quot; A little girl goes missing in this episode which leads Mulder and Scully on a case to find her that relates back to Samantha, Mulder's missing sister. The proceeding episode &quot;Closure&quot; is more of a mythology episode where Mulder finally meets his sister. The crew knew Duchovny was leaving at the end of the season, so they decided to wrap it all up in a moment that fans had been waiting seven years for.&quot;En Ami&quot; is a mythology episode totally written and directed by William B. David, the Cigarette Smoking Man himself! In this episode he offers Scully a cure for cancer, but is it all a con? &quot;All Things&quot; was the first episode that Gillian Anderson wrote and directed herself. It's a slow-moving episode and very powerful in that it reveals a lot about Scully's past, and the idea that she might have an affair with a married man who is now sick in hospital. Her search for the truth is incredibly spiritual. The final episode of the season &quot;Requiem&quot; is one of the greatest episodes of the show's entire run. This proves that the truth really is out there as Mulder is abducted and Scully reveals her pregnancy in one of the most gripping episodes in all television history. This was the episode that made the show legendary in my opinion. Absolutely superb.The stand-alone episode of Season Seven aren't as good as previous seasons with some tankers like &quot;Signs &amp; Wonders&quot; and &quot;First Person Shooter,&quot; but there are still some superb highlights. &quot;Rush,&quot; &quot;The Goldberg Variation,&quot; &quot;The Amazing Maleeni,&quot; &quot;Theef,&quot; &quot;Chimera,&quot; &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Je Souhaite&quot; are all brilliant but the true highlights come with episode such as &quot;Hungry.&quot; In this superb episode we meet a young and seemingly harmless boy, who isn't quite all he seems. To cure his hunger cravings he turns into an alien type hybrid, yet you can't help but feel sympathy for him as the episode is written from his perspective. &quot;Millennium&quot; features Mulder and Scully's first proper on-screen kiss as 1999 draws to a close. This is worth the price of the season alone and the superb zombie-style episode adds to this. &quot;Orison&quot; is just superb classic X-Files in which Donnie Pfaster escapes from jail after his five-year lock in. The hair/fingernails/death fetishist first appeared in Season 2's &quot;Irresistible&quot; and took Scully hostage in one of the most horrifying episodes of the show, and in this episode he's back to exact his revenge. Superb action and acting from Gillian Anderson inparticular.&quot;X-Cops&quot; is one of the boldest episodes of the show ever. Obviously influenced by The Blair Witch Project, the episode is filmed documentary style in the night as the agents try to uncover clues about what is attacking a rough neighborhood. &quot;Brand X&quot; is a superb episode with an original plotline about cigarettes and the effects it has on people, while &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot; is definitely a season highlight. Written and directed by David Duchovny, it sees a man trying to make Mulder and Scully's exploits into an on-screen blockbuster of comedy, romance and action. Tea Leoni (Duchovny's wife) is the woman playing Scully, and the scene where Scully's teaching her how to run in her shoes is one of the most hilarious moments of the entire show!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10The Special Features of this Seventh Season are equally brilliant as those on offer with the Sixth Season. We get an all new documentary, &quot;The Truth About Season Seven,&quot; deleted scenes from no less than seven of the best episodes, special effect sequences from ten episodes, character profiles on A.D. Skinner and Samantha Mulder and a mammoth 43 promotional television spots. All in all, Season Seven was a superb season of The X-Files in my opinion. Not many people like it because it's different, but hey, different is good. I wouldn't say it was the show's best season - far from it, but it's still great television viewing.

736880,AMVMEHGE80PSI,B000089RT0,"Christopher Loring Knowles ""secretsun.blogspo...","[13, 14]","There has been an enormous amount of revisionism concerning the seventh season of the X Files. And it must be said, the seventh season was when many of the X Files' so-called fan community on the Internet began to irrationally attack the show. This is to be expected. For a show to be as challenging, popular and emotionally charged as the X Files was, many people naturally found themselves unable to keep up as the show continued to break more ground. Others were stymied by the breakneck changes in tone that the seventh season reveled in. Others were intimidated as Chris Carter broke off from a predictable and easily digestable good guys-bad guys narrative with the Alien conspiracy and dug even further into the far theoretical reaches of Paranormal and Conspiracy research. The X Files very much charted the intellectual and metaphysical journey of its creators, and in the seventh season the black and white hats were left behind forever, replaced by disruptive and unsettling shades of gray.But for those familiar with the ground Carter and Co. were travelling, season 7 was a mind-blowing journey that kicked at the doors of consciousness itself. In it, HG Wells and Richard Matheson were replaced by Carlos Casteneda and Zecharia Sitchin. Simple answers and tidy resolutions were no longer forthcoming, because the real-time source material that the show's writers were plundering didn't offer any either. All that was offered was more questions. And questions within questions, and so ad infinitum. What the X Files was doing had not been seen on television before.The series kicked off with the landmark ""Sixth Extinction"" two-parter, a hallucinogenic journey into the world of alien astronaut origin theory, clairvoyance, deep parapsychology and radical eschatology. How a show that claimed that human and religious origins can be traced to alien intervention ever got aired is a mystery to me. It certainly couldn't be aired today.After the rocket ride of that two-parter, we got a light-hearted critique of self-improvement psychology and 12 step programs with ""Hungry"". But maybe the change wasn't so radical as one might think. As Mulder and Scully  struggled with the reality of their fundamentally altered genetic structure in Sixth Extinction, ""Hungry"" tells us that maybe there are things about ourselves we can't change.""Millennium"" wrapped up the loose strands of that eponymous series and offered a biting yet subtle critique on what level of morality and consciousness the dogmatic Biblical literalists striving to usher in Armageddon really possess.""Rush"" is an homage to the superhero the Flash, and shows the horror of great power put in the hands of moral pygmies. ""The Goldberg Variation"" is an attack on the very idea of randomness and causality, and the cinematography is bathed in warm, golden tones, as if illustrating the presence of a divine watchmaker unbeholden to our limited physical concepts.""Orison"" is a meditation on the limits of our moral concepts and the impotence of our religious strivings in the face of true evil. It posits that sometimes evil must be fought with evil. Or at least with ruthless clarity.""The Amazing Maleeni"" is a light-hearted puzzle piece about stage Magic, and somewhat of a tribute to the 70's classic film, the Sting. Magicians Ricky Jay and Jonathan Levit bring an air of authenticity to the proceedings. ""Signs & Wonders"" is a jarring defense of pure belief against hair-splitting rationalizing, with the message being: believe or don't. Don't stand in the middle of the road. In hindsight, this subversive episode was simply a setup for the leaps Chris Carter would ask the viewer to make in the following two-parter.""Sein Und Zeit""  and ""Closure"" are perhaps the most radical and unsettling episodes of the entire series, and pack a bone-crushing emotional wallop that one would expect more from cinema. The central question of the X Files was always the whereabouts of Mulder's sister, whose disappearance started him on his quest to begin with. With seven years of questions and heart-breaking red herrings, Carter could not simply have her re-appear again. So he put all his chips in and raised the stakes.In these exquisitely rendered episodes, Carter introduces a concept torn from the farthest reaches of metaphysical speculation and not only makes it work in context of the story, but makes you utterly believe in the story's central premise. Anthony Heald guest stars and puts in one of the greatest performances of the show's history.Allowing the viewer to catch their breath, ""X-Cops"" brilliantly satirizes Fox's police verite series and also manages to make a statement on the nature of fear. ""First Person Shooter"" is a throwaway, however. William Gibson's script rehashes his early 80's riffs and the episode is notable only for being one of the few showcases for the Lone Gunmen in Season 7.""Theef"" is a throwback to Season 2 metaphysical horror and is a perfectly enjoyable standalone. ""En Ami"" is written by Cigarette Smoking Man William Davis himself, and is a tightly constructed story of a double cross, with a subplot questioning the origin of religious faith. ""Chimera"" explores the rage and lust lurking beneath the pleasant facade of Suburbia.""all things"" follows ""Chimera's""exploration of marital infidelity with a story written by Gillian Anderson about Scully's torrid affair with her mentor/teacher from medical school and the effect it had on his family. The episode also continues the path of Scully's journey from die-hard skeptic to reluctant believer.The next four episodes are standalones. ""Brand X"" is the X Files take on the Russell Crowe film, ""the Insider."" ""Hollywood AD"" is a hilarious satire on Hollywood phoniness, written by David Duchovny. The subplot seems to posit that Hollywood is the new Vatican. ""Fight Club"" is a mess and stars Kathy Griffin, an actress whose voice is like fingernails on a blackboard pumped through a stadium PA to my ears. ""Je Souhaite"" is a wonderful recovery and is a humorous meditation of the futility of trying to interfere with the Divine Plan.""Requiem"" brings the series full circle, back to Bellfleur, Oregon, the site of the series' pilot. This powerful episode is filled with the jarring shocks and unsettling imagery Chris Carter trades in, and is a good jumping off point for those who don't have the taste for the post-Duchovny X Files. In its way it's similar to ""the End"", the last episode of the fifth season. If you didn't like the post-Vancouver era of the show and wanted to end your experience on a suitably downbeat note, you could stop there.So, where do you stand on the X Files? Was it simply a good, solid dose of pulp fiction for you, or did you appreciate the exploration and manifestation of deep left field concepts  it offered? The answer to that question will determine your enjoyment of this season. But I think on any level, Season 7 delivers and is worth your time. If you think you don't like it, try it again and see if you are willing to go to the uncharted terrain the show's creators want to take you.",5,Unparalled Excellence,1130544000,"10 29,

736882,ATOS750XCC9MQ,B000089RT0,Classis Genre Film Fanatic,"[5, 6]","IMHO, this is the weakest season of The X-Files. The alien conspiracy we were following for six years ended in the middle of season 6, and was taken to a different direction by the end. So season 7 started dealing with the plot of aliens creating human beings, and then &quot;resolved&quot; the plot of Mulder's sister's abduction, and ended with a pretty good cliffhanger that took the show in an even more different direction in the next season.[Spoilers]The resolution to the plot of Mulder's sister wasn't satisfying to me. I think I speak for most X-Fans when I say that we wanted Mulder to find his sister alive, and have her be a part of his life again. Instead, we find out she's been dead since 1987! So this whole time Mulder's looking for her ends up just being a waste. All those years of us following this story ends up not really being worth following. Ok, so Mulder can end his quest. He's free. Fine. But couldn't that happen with his sister actually being alive?![End Spoilers]Other weak points in the series were a couple of stand-alone episodes that were just rancid in my opinion. &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot; and &quot;Fight Club.&quot; What the heck were they thinking when they wrote these episodes?! I have to admit though, the reference to Plan 9 From Outerspace in &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot; was cool though. But both of these episodes were just too absurd for what The X-Files was known for. This show always had humorous happenings throughout its run, but these two episodes were just too over the top.But aside from the plot of Mulder's sister, and the two not-so-good stand-alone episodes mentioned above, I found this season to be pretty good. But I also thought since this was David Duchovny's last full season, that they kind of wasted his character. But the show ended with a band, which lead it into an interesting new direction for the show's next season.Good season, great DVD.",4,"Not the best, but still good",1080777600,"04 1, 2004",2004,1912,"['IMHO', 'weakest', 'season', 'X-Files', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'were', 'following', 'six', 'years', 'ended', 'middle', 'season', '6', 'was', 'taken', 'different', 'direction', 'end', 'So', 'season', '7', 'started', 'dealing', 'plot', 'aliens', 'creating', 'human', 'beings', 'then', 'quot', 'resolved', 'quot', 'plot', 'Mulder', 'sister', 'abduction', 'ended', 'pretty', 'good', 'cliffhanger', 'took', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'different', 'direction', 'next', 'season', '[', 'Spoilers', ']', 'resolution', 'plot', 'Mulder', 'sister', 'was', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'think', 'speak', 'most', 'X-Fans', 'when', 'say', 'wanted', 'Mulder', 'find', 'sister', 'alive', 'have', 'be', 'part', 'life', 'again', 'Instead', 'find', 'out', 'been', 'dead', '1987', 'whole', 'time', 'Mulder', 'looking', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'waste', 'years', 'following', 'story', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'worth', 'following', 'Ok', 'Mulder', 'can', 'end', 'quest', 'free', 'Fine', 'could', ""n't"", 'that', 'happen', 'sister', 'actually', 'being', 'alive', '[', 'End', 'Spoilers', ']', 'Other', 'weak', 'points', 'series', 'were', 'couple', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'rancid', 'opinion', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club.', 'quot', 'What', 'heck', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'wrote', 'episodes', 'have', 'admit', 'reference', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outerspace', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.', 'quot', 'was', 'cool', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'absurd', 'what', 'X-Files', 'was', 'known', 'show', 'always', 'had', 'humorous', 'happenings', 'run', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'top.But', 'aside', 'plot', 'Mulder', 'sister', 'two', 'not-so-good', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'mentioned', 'found', 'season', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'last', 'full', 'season', 'kind', 'wasted', 'character', 'show', 'ended', 'band', 'lead', 'interesting', 'new', 'direction', 'show', 'next', 'season.Good', 'season', 'great', 'DVD']",The X-Files: Season 7
736883,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000089RT0,"Cloud ""...""","[7, 10]","The show can hardly be called consistent. There is great episodes but now and then there's always a clunker. Then again, season 3 which many recognize as the best did have a few fillers now and then. I mean who really liked Hell Money or the List? Well season 7, along with 5, is probably one of the weaker seasons but by no means is this an outright terrible season. It's got its moments, it just doesn't have the same level of greatness as previous seasons had.The Sixth Extinction: A nice episode that shows Mulder's condition showing a weird side effect. 8.5/10The Sixth Extinction II Amor Fati: A quite nice episode that delves into Mulder's life had he abandoned the X-Files and we get a great appearance by Samantha. 8.5/10Hungry: Despite the performance by Chad E. Donnella, it's a very slow and kind of boring episode about a brain eating mutant. 6/10Millennium: A surprisingly good crossover where Mulder and Scully team up with Frank Black(of ""Millennium"") to prevent 2000 from being apocalyptic. 8/10Rush: A likable episode in which kids become the next Flash only not using it for the right reasons. 7.5/10Orison: A great/creepy episode with a wonderfully-done ending which features season 2 baddie Donnie Pfaster back and he's fixated on Scully. 9/10The Amazing Maleeni: Another likable episode dealing entirely with the magic of scheming magicians.Signs and Wonders: A kind of poor episode where a religious man uses snakes to go after unbelievers. 5.5/10Sein Und Zeit: Well the first half is wonderfully done about a girl who mysteriously vanishes. 9/10Closure: Oh man. We finally get a resolution to the Samantha storyline and it falls completely on its face. Emotionally and visually it's beautiful but the explanation? Smacks of laziness. 9/10 for the episode itself, 5/10 for the story.X-Cops: Personally I loved it. A creature is found stalking California residents and the camera crew of ""COPS"" is following them around. 8/10First-Person Shooter: Another likable but flawed episode where Mulder and Scully take on Krista Allen and her hotness in a digital environment. 7.5/10Theef: Another decent episode that has a guy going after a doctor using voodoo/hexcraft. 6/10En Ami: Smoking Man writes an episode where Scully enters a reluctant partnership with him and the episode's good. 8/10Chimera: Another decent episode that has Mulder on his own solving a case of the raven creature. 6/10all things: don't ask about the non-capitals. But Gillian Anderson writes/directs a Scully-heavy episode concerning a former flame. It's not awesome like One Breath or Memento Mori but it's quite good. 8.5/10Brand X: ANOTHER decent episode with oddly the best anti-smoking message you'll see. 6/10Hollywood A.D: X-Files goes Hollywood and Mulder and Scully hate it. David Duchovny writes/directs this funny one. 8.5/10Fight Club: One of the so bad it's good episodes where Kathy Griffin(who I can't stand) play doppelgangers who leave disaster whenever they get too close. 4.5/10Je Souhaite: Another funny episode involving a jinnyah(female genie) who grants wishes that don't bode well for the wisher. 8/10Requiem: Mulder and Scully return to Oregon to revisit the people from the Pilot and 2 surprising twists for the lead. It's a fitting finale that thankfully wasn't the series finale. 9/10The biggie episode of course is Closure, which finally answers the question after 7 years of what happened to Samantha Mulder. While it's certainly a great looking episode and emotionally its topnotch, the way that the resolution is told to me screams laziness and writing themselves into a corner. Also in a weird way, they didn't have the original actress, Vanessa Morley, to play her. While it's not that big of a thing, it would've ended things on a nice way.The real problem with this season is that there's too many decent episodes. It seemed almost easier to pick the great ones because there wasn't as much to remember. It is a season of ambitiousness since we get X-COPS, First-Person Shooter, all things and Hollywood A.D(in a way) and the season premiere.It's a season that's still worth watching(even 8 and 9 have its moments now and then) but the consistency of great/good episodes on here is quite off.",4,Probably one of the weaker full-time Mulder ones,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,4220,"['show', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'called', 'consistent', 'great', 'episodes', 'now', 'then', 'always', 'clunker', 'Then', 'again', 'season', '3', 'many', 'recognize', 'best', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'fillers', 'now', 'then', 'mean', 'who', 'really', 'liked', 'Hell', 'Money', 'List', 'Well', 'season', '7', '5', 'probably', 'one', 'weaker', 'seasons', 'means', 'outright', 'terrible', 'season', 'got', 'moments', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'level', 'greatness', 'previous', 'seasons', 'had.The', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'nice', 'episode', 'Mulder', 'condition', 'showing', 'weird', 'side', 'effect', '8.5/10The', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'II', 'Amor', 'Fati', 'quite', 'nice', 'episode', 'Mulder', 'life', 'had', 'abandoned', 'X-Files', 'get', 'great', 'appearance', 'Samantha', '8.5/10Hungry', 'performance', 'Chad', 'E.', 'Donnella', 'very', 'slow', 'kind', 'boring', 'episode', 'brain', 'eating', 'mutant', '6/10Millennium', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'crossover', 'where', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'team', 'up', 'Frank', 'Black', 'Millennium', 'prevent', '2000', 'being', 'apocalyptic', '8/10Rush', 'likable', 'episode', 'next', 'Flash', 'only', 'not', 'using', 'right', 'reasons', '7.5/10Orison', 'great/creepy', 'episode', 'wonderfully-done', 'ending', 'season', '2', 'baddie', 'Donnie', 'Pfaster', 'back', 'fixated', 'Scully', '9/10The', 'Amazing', 'Maleeni', 'likable', 'episode', 'dealing', 'entirely', 'magic', 'scheming', 'magicians.Signs', 'Wonders', 'kind', 'poor', 'episode', 'where', 'religious', 'man', 'snakes', 'go', 'unbelievers', '5.5/10Sein', 'Und', 'Zeit', 'Well', 'first', 'half', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'girl', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'vanishes', '9/10Closure', 'Oh', 'man', 'finally', 'get', 'resolution', 'Samantha', 'storyline', 'completely', 'face', 'Emotionally', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'explanation', 'Smacks', 'laziness', '9/10', 'episode', '5/10', 'story.X-Cops', 'Personally', 'loved', 'creature', 'found', 'stalking', 'California', 'residents', 'camera', 'crew', 'COPS', 'following', 'around', '8/10First-Person', 'Shooter', 'likable', 'flawed', 'episode', 'where', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'take', 'Krista', 'Allen', 'hotness', 'digital', 'environment', '7.5/10Theef', 'decent', 'episode', 'guy', 'going', 'doctor', 'using', 'voodoo/hexcraft', '6/10En', 'Ami', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'episode', 'where', 'Scully', 'reluctant', 'partnership', 'episode', 'good', '8/10Chimera', 'decent', 'episode', 'Mulder', 'own', 'solving', 'case', 'raven', 'creature', '6/10all', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'non-capitals', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Scully-heavy', 'episode', 'concerning', 'former', 'flame', 'not', 'awesome', 'One', 'Breath', 'Memento', 'Mori', 'quite', 'good', '8.5/10Brand', 'X', 'ANOTHER', 'decent', 'episode', 'oddly', 'best', 'anti-smoking', 'message', ""'ll"", 'see', '6/10Hollywood', 'A.D', 'X-Files', 'Hollywood', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'hate', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'funny', 'one', '8.5/10Fight', 'Club', 'One', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'episodes', 'where', 'Kathy', 'Griffin', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'play', 'doppelgangers', 'who', 'leave', 'disaster', 'whenever', 'get', 'too', 'close', '4.5/10Je', 'Souhaite', 'funny', 'episode', 'involving', 'jinnyah', 'female', 'genie', 'who', 'wishes', 'do', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'wisher', '8/10Requiem', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'return', 'Oregon', 'revisit', 'people', 'Pilot', '2', 'surprising', 'twists', 'lead', 'fitting', 'finale', 'thankfully', 'was', ""n't"", 'series', 'finale', '9/10The', 'biggie', 'episode', 'course', 'Closure', 'finally', 'question', '7', 'years', 'what', 'happened', 'Samantha', 'Mulder', 'certainly', 'great', 'looking', 'episode', 'emotionally', 'topnotch', 'way', 'resolution', 'told', 'screams', 'laziness', 'writing', 'corner', 'Also', 'weird', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'original', 'actress', 'Vanessa', 'Morley', 'play', 'not', 'big', 'thing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'things', 'nice', 'way.The', 'real', 'problem', 'season', 'too', 'many', 'decent', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'almost', 'easier', 'pick', 'great', 'ones', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'remember', 'season', 'ambitiousness', 'get', 'X-COPS', 'First-Person', 'Shooter', 'things', 'Hollywood', 'A.D', 'way', 'season', 'premiere.It', 'season', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', '8', '9', 'have', 'moments', 'now', 'then', 'consistency', 'great/good', 'episodes', 'here', 'quite', 'off']",The X-Files: Season 7
736884,AE2KCASMQPMO,B000089RT0,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[15, 16]","Another season of the X-Files is about to be released and we are getting close to The Truth. This seventh season is known to be one of the most difficult to swallow for the fans. I believe that the negative response it got from some people had to do with the fact that there was a big void: there was no real mythology episodes here... the transicion from the old mythology to the new one took place between the second half of the sixth season and the begining of the eighth. This means that the entire seventh season had to flirt with some elements of mythology without really starting a new one. The season starts with The Sixth Extinction two parter. These episodes don't really set new things, instead they try to elaborate around the things we saw in Biogenesis (the symbols in the artifact, and how it came from a space craft buried in an African beach). The CSM returns to reveal something to Mulder and to work as a devil who will tempt the hero with the promise of a new and normal life. By the end of the second episode nothing really important has happened... Mulder returns, there is no big revelation and Scully has learned that sometimes prayer works better than running around in high heels... and of course... Diana Fowley's demise. This two parter proved to be the most disappointing season opener of the series, but it was followed by some really great episodes. Hungry, which turned the focus of the series around and centered itself around the monster, although many thought that it was a bad episode I actually enjoyed it a lot. Then we find other really great episodes like Rush, Orison (Donnie Pfaster's return), The Goldberg Variation (a bit too light for me, but quite good actually), The Amazing Maleeny and Signs & Wonders (one of the most visually disturbing episodes of the season). In the middle of the season we find the two parter which resolved Samantha's abduction. Okay... those two didn't really work... but then we found some of the most brilliant stand alones of the series. X-COPS was just great, funny, clever and new. The always controversial ""all things"" (directed by Gillian Anderson) which kept me looking at the TV screen the entire time... it was that compelling to me (the problem: well, it is not really and X-File, but I took it as a breath of fresh air). Brand-X is an excelent episode: Mulder getting his lungs almost literally sucked out is just priceless drama... this was the first ep. from Steven Maedea. First Person Shooter offers some of the classic images of the X-Files: Mulder and Scully in virtual reality game customs and Scully shooting Maitraya. Je Souhaite is another really good episode from Vince Gilligan's hand, where we get to see the agents behaving in that goofy fantastic way (like in Small Potatoes, Bad Blood, Syzygy and Jose Chung): Scully is fascinated by an invisible corpse only to be later disappointed by its disappearance, and Mulder lecturing the genie in front of Skinner and a bunch of FBI agents who think he has finally lost it. In En Ami Scully is ""seduced"" by the possibility that cancer man can actually show a human side of him... but it could be all a trap or a set up: from William B. Davis' head comes this excelent episode. And finally: Requiem. The season finale that is mother to all season finales... not because of it being the best of them all (which i don't think is), but due to the implications of that final act: Mulder being finally abducted and Scully being pregnant.In overall, season seven lacked a well constructed mythology arc but it kept being one of the best shows on TV. The impulse that drove fans to the series crumble because of the uncertain future of the series, which forced Chris Carter not to enter completely into the development of the new mythology. But it sets in Requiem the first brick of the second mythology, which got almost half the episodes of season eight. And of course... FOX's work is just neat with these Boxed sets... I am really looking forward that Gillian Anderson commentary, as well as Vince Gilligan's. I have no doubt that the box will be just as beautifully crafted as the previous ones and there is no other booklet as good as the one that comes with this series' seasons (I know much people don`t care about these details, but i love them).",5,a break from mythology,1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,4290,"['season', 'X-Files', 'be', 'released', 'are', 'getting', 'close', 'Truth', 'seventh', 'season', 'known', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'fans', 'believe', 'negative', 'response', 'got', 'people', 'had', 'do', 'fact', 'was', 'big', 'void', 'was', 'real', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'here', 'transicion', 'old', 'mythology', 'new', 'one', 'took', 'place', 'second', 'half', 'sixth', 'season', 'begining', 'eighth', 'entire', 'seventh', 'season', 'had', 'flirt', 'elements', 'mythology', 'really', 'starting', 'new', 'one', 'season', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'two', 'parter', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'set', 'new', 'things', 'instead', 'try', 'elaborate', 'things', 'saw', 'Biogenesis', 'symbols', 'artifact', 'how', 'came', 'space', 'craft', 'buried', 'African', 'beach', 'CSM', 'returns', 'reveal', 'something', 'Mulder', 'work', 'devil', 'who', 'will', 'tempt', 'hero', 'promise', 'new', 'normal', 'life', 'end', 'second', 'episode', 'nothing', 'really', 'important', 'happened', 'Mulder', 'returns', 'big', 'revelation', 'Scully', 'learned', 'sometimes', 'prayer', 'works', 'better', 'running', 'around', 'high', 'heels', 'course', 'Diana', 'Fowley', 'demise', 'two', 'parter', 'proved', 'be', 'most', 'disappointing', 'season', 'opener', 'series', 'was', 'followed', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'Hungry', 'turned', 'focus', 'series', 'centered', 'monster', 'many', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'episode', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'Then', 'find', 'other', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'Rush', 'Orison', 'Donnie', 'Pfaster', 'return', 'Goldberg', 'Variation', 'bit', 'too', 'light', 'quite', 'good', 'actually', 'Amazing', 'Maleeny', 'Signs', 'Wonders', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'disturbing', 'episodes', 'season', 'middle', 'season', 'find', 'two', 'parter', 'resolved', 'Samantha', 'abduction', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'then', 'found', 'most', 'brilliant', 'stand', 'alones', 'series', 'X-COPS', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'funny', 'clever', 'new', 'always', 'controversial', 'things', 'directed', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'kept', 'looking', 'TV', 'screen', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'compelling', 'problem', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'X-File', 'took', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Brand-X', 'excelent', 'episode', 'Mulder', 'getting', 'lungs', 'almost', 'literally', 'sucked', 'out', 'just', 'priceless', 'drama', 'was', 'first', 'ep', 'Steven', 'Maedea', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'classic', 'images', 'X-Files', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'virtual', 'reality', 'game', 'customs', 'Scully', 'shooting', 'Maitraya', 'Je', 'Souhaite', 'really', 'good', 'episode', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'hand', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'agents', 'behaving', 'goofy', 'fantastic', 'way', 'Small', 'Potatoes', 'Bad', 'Blood', 'Syzygy', 'Jose', 'Chung', 'Scully', 'fascinated', 'invisible', 'corpse', 'only', 'be', 'later', 'disappointed', 'disappearance', 'Mulder', 'lecturing', 'genie', 'front', 'Skinner', 'bunch', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'think', 'finally', 'lost', 'En', 'Ami', 'Scully', 'seduced', 'possibility', 'cancer', 'man', 'can', 'actually', 'show', 'human', 'side', 'could', 'be', 'trap', 'set', 'up', 'William', 'B.', 'Davis', 'head', 'excelent', 'episode', 'finally', 'Requiem', 'season', 'finale', 'mother', 'season', 'finales', 'not', 'being', 'best', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'due', 'implications', 'final', 'act', 'Mulder', 'being', 'finally', 'abducted', 'Scully', 'being', 'pregnant.In', 'overall', 'season', 'seven', 'lacked', 'well', 'constructed', 'mythology', 'arc', 'kept', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'impulse', 'drove', 'fans', 'series', 'crumble', 'uncertain', 'future', 'series', 'forced', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'not', 'enter', 'completely', 'development', 'new', 'mythology', 'Requiem', 'first', 'brick', 'second', 'mythology', 'got', 'almost', 'episodes', 'season', 'eight', 'course', 'FOX', 'work', 'just', 'neat', 'Boxed', 'sets', 'am', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'have', 'doubt', 'box', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'previous', 'ones', 'other', 'booklet', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'series', 'seasons', 'know', 'much', 'people', 'don', 't', 'care', 'details', 'i', 'love']",The X-Files: Season 7

Great script by Chip Johanessen (Former collaborator of Beverly Hills 90210 and Millenium).The Amazing Maleeni:Actually not an X File, but an excellent proof that the series still had a lot of fuel. Excellent Turn of Screw at the end!!!X Cops:Cops, The X Files and Vince Gilligan... What's not to like?Theef:Voodoo. Nuff Said!!!Chimera:David Amann at his best!!!En Ami (Wich means &quot;One Friend&quot;, although its a play on words wich in english can be understood as &quot;enemy&quot;):Written by the CSM himself (William B. Davis)!!!All Things:Written and Directed by Gillian Anderson. Not the best, but the teaser (considered one of the most controversials in the whole series' existence) is worth the whole package.Je Souhaite (I Wish):Written and directed by Vince Gilligan.After this, the series was transformed into a mix up that even Chris Carter didn't understand at all. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate Robert Patrick's character or even Annabeth Gish's but John Dogget and Monica Reyes didn't achieve to give the series that feeling we all know very well. That X FILES feeling.I'm so sorry that David Duchovny got transformed into such an egotistical person. The series would have been succesful with him in it. You can see him act like a Zombie (Check out Chimera)and he already looks tired. Maybe the series would've finished here and continue in a new movie. Heck! The series could've even ended with Season Eight, but no! Fox had to continue exploiting fans. And we gladly let them... But not for long.Hope you enjoy having the only and real seven seasons of what can be called the television phenomenon of the last century.I WILL buy the las two seasons, only to feed my collectionist's hunger, and because the movie will start where the last episode of the Ninth (and worst season) left off.Long Live the X Files!!!Long Live the X Philes!!!Wishing to encounter you all again in a dark cinema room.Enrique Aguilar.A Mexican X Phile.",5,The last of the true classic X Files Seasons!!!,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,3288,"['P', 'gt', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'were', 'still', 'together', 'last', 'season', 'two', 'leading', 'characters', 'one', 'best', 'dramatic', 'series', 'television', 'history.After', 'movie', 'move', 'L.A.', 'predominance', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'incredible', 'resolution', 'original', 'mythology', 'seventh', 'season', 'started', 'bang', 'not', 'little', 'anxiety', 'fans', 'side', 'was', 'much', 'rumored', 'final', 'season', 'Myth', 'Episodes', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'two', 'parts', 'new', 'mythology', 'started', 'last', 'episode', 'Season', 'Six', 'called', 'Biogenesis.The', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'II', 'Amor', 'Fati', 'Wich', 'translated', 'means', 'quot', 'Love', 'Fate', 'quot', 'carry', 'theory', 'Mulder', 'might', 'be', 'succesful', 'Human', 'Alien', 'Hybrid', 'extremely', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Two', 'Parter', 'Sein', 'Und', 'Zeit', 'Wich', 'quot', 'Being', 'Time', 'quot', 'Closure', 'wich', 'rest', 'extremely', 'precious', 'form', 'Samantha', 'Mulder', 'mistery', 'giving', 'Fox', 'Character', 'one', 'few', 'moments', 'rest', 'whole', 'series.And', 'Requiem', 'best', 'best', 'Season', 'Finale', 'would', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'series', 'only', 'God', 'what.Stand', 'Alone', 'Episodes', 'Or', 'Monster', 'Week', 'Orison', 'return', 'villain', 'appeared', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Great', 'script', 'Chip', 'Johanessen', 'Former', 'collaborator', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'Millenium', '.The', 'Amazing', 'Maleeni', 'Actually', 'not', 'X', 'File', 'excellent', 'proof', 'series', 'still', 'had', 'lot', 'fuel', 'Excellent', 'Turn', 'Screw', 'end', 'X', 'Cops', 'Cops', 'X', 'Files', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'What', 'not', 'like', 'Theef', 'Voodoo', 'Nuff', 'Said', 'Chimera', 'David', 'Amann', 'best', 'En', 'Ami', 'Wich', 'quot', 'One', 'Friend', 'quot', 'play', 'words', 'wich', 'english', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'quot', 'quot', 'Written', 'CSM', 'William', 'B', 'Davis', 'Things', 'Written', 'Directed', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Not', 'best', 'teaser', 'considered', 'one', 'most', 'controversials', 'whole', 'series', 'existence', 'whole', 'package.Je', 'Souhaite', 'Wish', 'Written', 'directed', 'Vince', 'Gilligan.After', 'series', 'was', 'transformed', 'mix', 'up', 'even', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'character', 'even', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'John', 'Dogget', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'did', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'give', 'series', 'feeling', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'X', 'FILES', 'feeling.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'sorry', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'got', 'transformed', 'such', 'egotistical', 'person', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'succesful', 'can', 'see', 'act', 'Zombie', 'Check', 'Chimera', 'already', 'tired', 'Maybe', 'series', 'would', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'here', 'continue', 'new', 'movie', 'Heck', 'series', 'could', ""'ve"", 'even', 'ended', 'Season', 'Eight', 'Fox', 'had', 'continue', 'exploiting', 'fans', 'gladly', 'let', 'not', 'long.Hope', 'enjoy', 'having', 'only', 'real', 'seven', 'seasons', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'television', 'phenomenon', 'last', 'century.I', 'WILL', 'buy', 'las', 'two', 'seasons', 'only', 'feed', 'collectionist', 'hunger', 'movie', 'will', 'start', 'where', 'last', 'episode', 'Ninth', 'worst', 'season', 'left', 'off.Long', 'Live', 'X', 'Files', 'Long', 'Live', 'X', 'Philes', 'Wishing', 'encounter', 'again', 'dark', 'cinema', 'room.Enrique', 'Aguilar.A', 'Mexican', 'X', 'Phile']",The X-Files: Season 7

Now, I am ordering the series by year. I've just finished season seven viewing one episode per evening. My review could be applied to the six previous seasons as well.Think about it! How often were Mulder and Scully and Skinner at deaths door only to be revived at the last possible moment.Plus, if you had incontrovertible evidence that earth was about to be invaded by aliens why would you work on the more mundane cases? Wouldn't you devote every moment trying to battle to save earth?The stand alone episodes are excellent. I loved them the most even though I really watched the series for the ""Black Oil"" stories.However, I think that Chris Carter could not figure out a way to tie up all the loose ends, so he just dropped the ball at the end.Mulder left the show after season seven (to go on to a fantastic movie career -- read that with dripping sarcasm.) While Scully bravely ventured on with Doggett?, the actor from Terminator II. I thought he was a great choice because, after all, he came from the future.Finally, I also purchased the ""Lone Gunmen"" series from Amazon.com and found it to be good as well.

736895,A7PKDOBWW3WQG,B000089RT0,flask,"[32, 38]","Season 7 represents the end of the traditional X-Files episode formula and the befuddlement of the established series mythology. For every gem worth viewing, it has two or three low quality imitations to match.The season highlights include &quot;Hungry&quot; (7x03), &quot;Millennium&quot; (7x04), &quot;The Goldberg Variation&quot; (7x06), and &quot;X-Cops&quot; (7x12). Honorable mention should also be given to &quot;First Person Shooter&quot; (7x13) -- at least for its outlandish action scenes -- &quot;Theef&quot; (7x14), &quot;En Ami&quot; (7x15) and &quot;Brand X&quot; (7x18).Surprisingly, the episodes penned by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are oddly flat. Duchovny's &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot; (7x19) is humorous, but lacks the endearing sentimentalism of &quot;The Unnatural&quot; (6x20). Anderson's &quot;All Things&quot; (7x17) attempts to graft her own spiritualism as an actor atop the scientific rationalism of her character. As a result, the defining essence of Special Agent Dana Scully is iconoclastically ruined and the episode instead strikes the viewer as a glorified music video.Season 7 is also significant in that it was the last full season in which Duchovny starred. In a sense, perhaps the departure of David Duchovny was inevitable. The character of Special Agent Fox Mulder had simply run out of steam: his crusade to stop alien colonization was resolved in Season 6 with the destruction of the Syndicate in &quot;One Son&quot; (6x12), and his quest for his abducted sister was brought to a poetic conclusion in &quot;Sein Und Zeit&quot; (7x10) and &quot;Closure&quot; (7x11). Hence, what more was there left to do? Perhaps Duchvony sensed this as well and left the series accordingly.In terms of mythology, the X-Files reached its true end with Season 7. The Syndicate was destroyed, Samantha Mulder had been put to rest, the Cigarette Smoking Man had become an outcast and, last but not least, Scully and Mulder had admitted/consummated their affection for one another. All the plot widgets had been sown up. Unfortunately, the show dragged on for two more years and became something quite different.

736902,A169CPBR76SEF1,B000089RT0,Ian K. Hughes,"[61, 80]","Season 7 of THE X FILES (1999-2000) is the last season featuring the original team of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in unmodified form. It is also the weakest of all nine seasons.NEGATIVE POINTS:1) Excepting the excellent mythology scripts, Duchovny is emotionally detached in his portrayal of Agent Mulder. While in prior seasons his occasional onscreen fatigue could plausibly be tied to plots featuring a disillusioned Mulder, it is too much of a stretch to extend such a notion to Season 7, which is severely damaged as a result.2) In terms of new ideas, the writers on the show seemed to have been genuinely stumped throughout much of Season 7, particularly with regard to ""stand alone"" episodes. The numerous uninspired  ""stand alone"" scripts could hardly have been expected to provide the necessary stimulus for a weary Duchovny, struggling through the grind of a notoriously demanding production schedule. The perfunctory interaction between Mulder and Scully in many ""stand alone"" scripts proves especially damaging to a show that thrives on dynamic interplay between its two main characters.3) Some of the failures relate to the well intentioned but ungainly synthesis attempted by blending THE X FILES with different shows:The script titled ""Millenium"" features a hackneyed plot (zombies a la George Romero) and is a waste of actor Lance Henriksson's talents. The highly publicized Mulder/Scully ""first kiss"" is anticlimactic, unfittingly placed in such a lackluster episode.Vince Gilligan's ""X Cops"" tries to merge THE X FILES with the ""reality show"" COPS: a noble failure that works in the first half only to fall to pieces in the second.4) Other failures had to due with recycling plots and themes from prior years:""Signs & Wonders"" is a fair effort (a good performance by the guest actor portraying the fiery preacher). Unfortunately, it is too obviously redolent of superior scripts previously penned.""Orison"", featuring the return of the abominable Donnie Pfaster (""Irresistible""), falls well short of the masterful episode from Season 2. Its closing moments are, however, a tour-de-force with Agent Scully fighting ferociously with Pfaster against the backdrop of David Lynch style cinematography.""Rush"" is a poorly thought out foray into the world of teenage angst. Equally juvenile is ""First Person Shooter"", a ""virtual reality"" script that completely wastes an appearance by the Lone Gunmen.5) The most disturbing failures of Season 7 are manifested in three horrible episodes:""Chimera"" is a unique combination of gaffs with its razor-thin storyline, an uninterested Duchovny (barely in character), bad supporting acting, poor lighting and even a mediocre musical score: an ""anti X FILES"", with all of the series standards turned upside down.""Hollywood AD"" (written & directed by Duchovny) doesn't even seem to be an X FILES episode. On the surface level, the script plays in territory previously staked out by Darin Morgan, but ""Hollywood AD"" falls well short of the inspired shifting perspectives offered in ""Jose Chung's `From Outer Space' "".  With its pedestrian version of ironic juxtaposition (the ""converted radical"" & ""apostate traditionalist"") ""Hollywood AD"" swerves between chic absurdity and ""hipper than thou"" movie-star smarminess, a combination completely antithetical to the spirit of THE X FILES.Chris Carter's ""Fight Club"" is an essay in bitterness, all too reflective of the turmoil playing out behind the scenes. With this singularly unpleasant episode THE X FILES bottomed out, sinking to a depth of self-loathing that nearly destroyed it altogether.POSITIVE POINTS:1) Unique scripts, so often seen in previous years, were few and far between in Season 7 but ""All Things"" (written and directed by Gillian Anderson) is an artfully prepared piece; ""outside the box"" but retaining a sense of continuity and fidelity to the life and character of Dana Scully.2) Vince Gilligan's ""Hungry"" is a beautifully conceived black comedy, shown (sympathetically) from the point of view of a quirky ""anti-villian"".3) Other episodes fit more readily into the ""classic"" X FILES mould. ""Theef"" and ""Brand X"" feature catchy dialogue and ""gross out"" situations that could have comfortably been aired in  Season 2. These scripts, while not meeting the Olympian standards set in the ""glory years"", have the effect of shoring up the more disastrous areas of the season by working in familiar territory.MYTH ARC:The heart and soul of Season 7 is located in the six mythology episodes, which feature the type of committed acting and thoughtful writing fans have come to expect from THE X FILES ( the newly invigorated myth-arc plot plus the ongoing Scully/Mulder ""symbiosis"" would carry the dramatic weight of the show in its final years ).The opening two-parter (""The Sixth Extinction I/II"") borrows an important element of its plot from the Nikos Kazantzakis novel, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".The mid season two-parter (""Sein und Zeit"" / ""Closure"") follows up and (apparently) ends the mystery surrounding Mulder's quest for his sister. ""Closure"" features an incredibly moving performance by Duchovny (one of his finest moments on the show). ""My Weakness"", a song written by pop artist Moby, plays a haunting musical role in the episode.""En Ami"" (co-written by William B. Davis), while not at the same level as the other mythology episodes, does feature some interesting dialogue between Agent Scully and the Cigarette Smoking Man. The amoral brilliance of the Machiavellian ""CGB Spender"" is an interesting contrast to the noble goodness of the equally intelligent Dana Scully.The cliffhanger (""Requiem"") is full of dramatic tension, bringing the agents back to the location first featured in the 1993 series ""Pilot"". This excellent and influential episode (the plot launched a dozen more scripts) was a noble conclusion to the troubled 7th season and helped put THE X FILES back on a path worthy of its unique quality; the show would ultimately ( though not without missteps) fulfill its 9 year run as an aesthetic and philosophical unity.",3,weakest season of THE X FILES,1043798400,"01 29,

736909,A1EKA9XSI641C9,B000089RT0,John S. Milas,"[4, 5]","Season 7 picks up right where the Season 6 finale left off in a three parter.  That means that it continues the same confusing and sometimes ridiculous plot of that finale.  It seems those writing these three episodes started to write the first things that came to mind instead of what the actual best direction for the story would've been.  That said, many people believe the series started to decline here; I disagree.  The only thing that's really a letdown is the amount of mythology episodes.  There are only 4 or 5.  It's sort of hard to say much about the mythology direction that this season goes.  There is a two-parter where Mulder finally figures out what happens to his sister, resulting in one of the most poignantly filmed moments in the series.  Other than that, very little new information is given by the mythology episodes.  Fortunately, the season finale, Requiem, takes things back to the basics for the mythology and ends up being one of the best (if not the best) episodes in the season.  There is really no appearance at all of ""the black oil"" and very little appearances by the Cigarette Smoking Man.  Mulder and Scully become a lot closer together in this season, but it's mainly through the stand alone episodes, which began to outweigh the merit of the mythology episodes around season 6.  Most of them are just great, like Hungry, which is from the perspective of the monster, and David Duchovney's hilarious Hollywood A.D.  Gillian Anderson's ""all things"" is a very good episode as well about Scully reflecting on her choices in life.  And the bad episodes like the horribly written First Person Shooter and the irritating Fight Club are here as usual.  This season CONTAINS THE SPECIAL FEATURES just like in season 6.  They are on the same disc as the last two episodes here.Notably Good Episodes:HungryMillenniumRushThe Goldberg VariationThe Amazing MaleeniSein und ZeitClosureX-COPSEn Amiall thingsBrand XHollywood A.D.Je SouhaiteRequiemThis season comes recommended to anyone who has enjoyed the past seasons.",4,Believe to Understand,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,2042,"['Season', '7', 'picks', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'Season', '6', 'finale', 'left', 'off', 'three', 'parter', 'same', 'confusing', 'sometimes', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'finale', 'writing', 'three', 'episodes', 'started', 'write', 'first', 'things', 'came', 'mind', 'instead', 'what', 'actual', 'best', 'direction', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'said', 'many', 'people', 'believe', 'series', 'started', 'decline', 'here', 'disagree', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'letdown', 'amount', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'are', 'only', '4', '5', 'sort', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'mythology', 'direction', 'season', 'two-parter', 'where', 'Mulder', 'finally', 'out', 'what', 'sister', 'resulting', 'one', 'most', 'poignantly', 'filmed', 'moments', 'series', 'Other', 'very', 'little', 'new', 'information', 'given', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'Fortunately', 'season', 'finale', 'Requiem', 'things', 'back', 'basics', 'mythology', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'really', 'appearance', 'black', 'oil', 'very', 'little', 'appearances', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'become', 'lot', 'closer', 'together', 'season', 'mainly', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'began', 'outweigh', 'merit', 'mythology', 'season', '6', 'Most', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'Hungry', 'perspective', 'monster', 'David', 'Duchovney', 'hilarious', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'things', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'well', 'Scully', 'reflecting', 'choices', 'life', 'bad', 'episodes', 'horribly', 'written', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'irritating', 'Fight', 'Club', 'are', 'here', 'usual', 'season', 'CONTAINS', 'THE', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'just', 'season', '6', 'are', 'same', 'disc', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'here.Notably', 'Good', 'Episodes', 'HungryMillenniumRushThe', 'Goldberg', 'VariationThe', 'Amazing', 'MaleeniSein', 'ZeitClosureX-COPSEn', 'Amiall', 'thingsBrand', 'XHollywood', 'A.D.Je', 'SouhaiteRequiemThis', 'season', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'past', 'seasons']",The X-Files: Season 7

My wife and I watched each episode faithfully every night (sometimes two episodes per night) until they were all goneYet, despite the fact that we're huge X-Files fans, our conclusion is that Episode 7 is lackluster at best. The stories were one-offs (and weak ones at that), the monsters were ho-hum, the action wasn't gripping, and it seemed as if everyone was just walking through his/her part. Sleep walking, that is.I think the lack of aliens and conspiracy villians really took a toll on The X-Files. Without the overarching threat of either alien invasion or government cover-ups, nothing much really goes on in the lives of Mulder and Scully.The only hint that something cool *could* happen is when Mulder and Scully got closer emotionally and physically. Their relationship is a truly great one already (one of the best on television), but we wanted to see it taken to the next level. Alas, that was not to be.We've watched Seasons 1-8 so far and I have to say Season 7 is the weakest of the bunch. Season 8 (see my other review), which receives a lot of grief because of Mulder's absence and Scully's emotionalism (hey, she's pregnant; give her a break!), is far superior to Season 7.You can read other reviews to get a play-by-play of each episode in Season 7. All I want to do in this review is provide my two cents worth.My advice: Unless you're a completist who needs to have every season, I'd skip Season 7 and go right into Season 8.

736912,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B000089RT0,Kenji Fujishima,"[2, 2]","It was early in Season 7 that I stopped watching ""The X-Files"" regularly. Maybe, after the pretensions and anticlimax of ""The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati,"" I had lost enough interest in the mythology to abandon the show (until the series finale). Whatever reason it was, it was only via syndicated reruns and this DVD set that I was finally able to catch all of the episodes from Season 7, which, in many ways, continued where Season 6---one of the most creative and inventive seasons of the show, I think---left off.Mythology-wise, Season 7 was basically about tying up loose ends. The opening two-parter ""The Sixth Extinction"" and the aforementioned ""Amor Fati"" picked up from the Season 6 finale ""Biogenesis,"" which found Scully pondering the origin of man while Mulder was suffering from an unknown mental condition. Of course, everything turns out all right in the end, but not after Mulder has undergone a LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST-type evaluation of the choices he made in his life in ""Amor Fati""---an interesting idea that is done in by drearily ponderous, rather pretentious treatment. And then there is ""Sein und Zeit""/""Closure,"" which supposedly resolves the mystery surrounding Mulder's sister Samantha's disappearance, but which left a lot of fans feeling disappointed, even angered. I dunno...I thought the resolution worked well as a spiritual release. While ""Closure"" did not end the way many fans preferred, I thought it was a creative way of allowing Mulder to let go of that pain he's been carrying for so long---even if, at this point, most fans had understandably lost faith in Chris Carter's concluding everything neatly.The mythology, though, is, I suppose, not necessarily the focus of Season 7. The standalones, to me, are really the thing here, and it's a truly varied lot. While there are inevitably some mediocrities (""Millennium,"" ""First Person Shooter,"" ""Fight Club"") to be found, it's still rather amazing how many good things there are to be found in this late season. Season 7 episodes like ""The Goldberg Variation"" and ""The Amazing Maleeni"" continue Season 6's penchant for clever, almost wacky plots; on the other hand, there are some interesting explorations of the Cigarette Smoking Man and Scully in, respectively, ""En Ami"" (written by William B. Davis himself) and the very uneven but generally effective ""all things"" (written and directed by Gillian Anderson). In the mix, there are some creepy returns to the old pre-L.A. ""X-Files"" form in episodes like ""Signs and Wonders"" and Theef"" (which is possibly a better voodoo story than Season 2's muddled ""Fresh Bones""). Meanwhile, David Duchovny returned to writing and directing with ""Hollywood A.D."", a farfetched religious mystery that turns into a funny (if perhaps a bit too facile) satire of Hollywood. And writer Vince Gilligan---creator of previous classics like Season 4's ""Small Potatoes"" and Season 5's ""Bad Blood""---returned with more delightful episodes, including ""Hungry,"" ""X-Cops"" (a ""X-Files"" episode in ""Cops"" garb), and the lightly cynical ""Je Souhaite."" All in all, there are still quite a few flashes of brilliance to be found in Season 7, even if the strain in creativity may have been starting to show in some of the episodes (certainly more so than in Season 6).Finally, there is ""Requiem,"" a season finale that arguably serves both as a bookend to the first seven years and a look forward into the future. The episode was intended as a possible series finale until a last-minute decision extended the show for at least another year. Whether that decision was a good one in light of the subsequent, controversial final two seasons is open to debate; but ""Requiem"" at least managed to create a compelling-enough cliffhanger for Season 8 while closing out the so-called ""Duchovny era"" (this was to be Duchovny's last full season on the show).The seventh season of ""The X-Files,"" continuing where the equally divisive Season 6 left off, will probably never be as much of a consensus fan favorite as, say, Seasons 2 or 3. Those who believe the show began to decline in Season 6---when the crew moved to L.A. from its original Vancouver location---will only see more signs of it in Season 7. (Naysayers may also have ammunition regarding stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, both of whom occasionally look rather bored onscreen.) Despite its pits, though, I think there are enough fine episodes and good moments in this season to warrant a look. It may not be among the top ""X-Files"" seasons---Season 3 is still probably the best of the 9---but Season 7 is still worth seeing.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[41, 47]","After watching the special features I found it hard to believe that the shows creator, Chris Carter wasn't sure whether or not there would be an eighth season.  This lead Chris Carter and gang to come to some conclusions and closure of certain plot lines within the series.  Chief among those is Mulder's quest to find his sister is finally brought to closure after six and half seasons of innuendo and unanswered questions leading to additional questions.The ""mythology"" episodes had to take a somewhat different direction during the seventh season due to the syndicate being decimated in the sixth season, leaving only the CSM, Krycek, Diana Fowley and Marita Covarrubias and they seemed to be looking for a new direction during their episodes.  The seventh season principally consists of going back to the thrilling standing alone episodes that did one of two things, provide a good scare with astonishing imagery not normally seen on television or they combined that with some brilliant humor.The mythology episodes:The Sixth Extinction & The Sixth Extinction II:  Amor Fati - Continuing on from the outstanding sixth season cliffhanger, Biogenesis, these two episodes usher in the seventh season brilliantly.  Fox is bed stricken, infected with an alien virus that has his mind working triple time; Scully is in Africa trying to come up with clues as to how to save her partner and AD Skinner is doing his best to help both Mulder and Scully while dealing with Agent Diana Fowley and Krycek.  These two episodes also contain some of the best imagery of the entire series.Sein Und Zeit - This exceptional and extremely emotional episode is part mythology as it leads into the follow on episode, Closure.  In this episode, a young girl goes missing in the middle of the night, just after her father has a terrible image of her and a note is inexplicably left behind by the mother.Closure - This is the episode the fans have been waiting for almost seven years to see as we're finally and with no small modicum of heart wrenching emotion lead to the end of Fox Mulder's quest to find his sister.  In no small measure, this episode was done quite magnificently and accolades are due for director Kim Manners.En Ami - The CSM is back and he claims to Scully that he's dying and he entreats her to help him.  This episode is remarkably well written and played out on screen as we're able to see the CSM and his continued ability to confuse through obfuscation.  Of special note is that this one was written by the CSM himself, William B. Davis.Chimera - I categorize this brilliant episode as part of the mythology because it gives us a look into Scully's past and her present persona in comparison to that past.  While it is a hard pill to swallow, believing that ""by the book"" Scully would have an affair with a married man while she was in medical school, it does show that she can be ""human"" as well and fall into that trap.  Of special interest is the fact that Gillian Anderson, wrote, directed and starred primarily in this great episode.Requiem - This exceptional season seven cliffhanger stands out as giving Mulder proof that the truth is out there, as you will see when you watch this episode.  The one true sad thing about this episode is that it marks the end of the last full season in which David Duchovny/Fox Mulder works on the series full time!A brief synopsis of some of the better stand alone episode:Hungry - This particularly fascinating episode is about a young man who isn't quite a young ""man"" and he has some dietary needs that are quite hard on those around him.  What I also found to be appealing about this episode is that it's told almost completely from the ""monsters"" point of view which brings one to empathize with him.Millennium - In a manner of homage to the Millennium series, Lance Henriksen is brought on the X-Files in the same character that he played on that series, Frank Black.  Now Mulder and Scully must deal with the Millennium group as the time is at hand.  The long awaited first on screen kiss between Mulder and Scully is done skillfully.Orison - This exceptional episode brings Mulder and most predominantly Scully back into the world of Donnie Pfaster who was first seen in season two's ""Irresistible"" where he nearly killed her.  He's escaped from prison and they're destined to meet again.The Amazing Maleeni - The X-Files explores the world of magic and this episode scores big in the humor area while telling a good X-File.Hollywood A.D.  As comedic episodes go, this is one the series finest and it tells a good X-File at the same time.  Of note is that David Duchovny gets to work briefly in this episode with his wife, the ever gorgeous Tea Leoni'.Je Souhaite - This is a marvelous comedic X-File as well as we're taken to Missouri and we meet a not so bright young man who opens up an abandoned storage area only to find a ""Jinniyah"" in a rug who grants him three wishes.  The scenes with Scully in this episode are priceless as we get to see her smile a little more.Special Features of note:The one true disappointment about this boxed set is that the special features

736917,A328B2C7LTKCG8,B000089RT0,Mark T. Matranga,"[3, 4]","Granted, every previous season is probably better than season 7 (I rank them in this order: 3, 5, 6, 1, 2, 4, then 7.) That being said, this season is very worthwhile to own on DVD for several amazing, ground breaking episodes.First of all, I love the Sixth Extinction trilogy that began with Biogenesis at the end of season 6. Mulder's alternate reality, in which he has children with Diana Fowley, grows old and watches everyone he loves grow old and die (except the Cigarette Smoking Man) then witnesses the alien Armegeddon, is absolutely brilliant. Scully is his touch stone that gets him through the ordeal, and he tells her so after he awakens.The other two-part episode (Sein Und Zeit and the Closure) allows Mulder to find closure with regard to Samantha. I did not like this episode at first, but upon further consideration I feel satisfied that it was a nice way to resolve Samantha's abduction. (Probably not many people remember that the idea of &quot;walk-ins&quot; was introduced back in season 2's Red Museum episode.) Seeing Samantha as a beautiful young lady of 14 was very touching to me.Some of my all-time favorite stand alone episodes are in season 7, including the Rush, the Goldberg Variation, the Amazing Maleeni, the Signs and Wonders, Chimera and Je Souhaite, all of which are extremely clever and intriguing.But mostly I want to comment on All Things, the episode written and directed by Gillian Anderson that I somehow had never seen until very recently. Scully discovers the power of the Present Moment as she follows her spiritual guidance (in the form of synchronistic events, and the appearance of a woman that may be interpreted as an angel) to clear up an unresolved situation from her past. Most people do not seem to understand or appreciate this episode (the general concensus is that Scully is very much out of character...) but I thought it was simply brilliant.It makes perfect sense to me that Scully would finally, after almost seven years on the X Files, begin to realize that not everything can be adequately explained by science. It also makes sense from the standpoint that Scully is now 35, a time in life when many people start to become spiritual. This is consistent with previous episodes (season 1 Beyond the Sea, season 3 Revelations, season 5 All Souls, etc. - whenever the X File was mystical in nature) when Mulder was the skeptic and Scully the one who &quot;saw the signs.&quot; It also set the stage for Season 8, when Doggett joined the show and Scully became the believer.The only thing preventing a 5 star review is the presence of some really bad episodes (Millenium, First Person Shooter, Fight Club, and Hollywood AD) but hey - 18 good ones out of 22 ain't bad !",4,The X Files Breaks New Ground,1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,2727,"['Granted', 'previous', 'season', 'probably', 'better', 'season', '7', 'rank', 'order', '3', '5', '6', '1', '2', '4', 'then', '7', 'being', 'said', 'season', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'own', 'DVD', 'several', 'amazing', 'ground', 'breaking', 'episodes.First', 'love', 'Sixth', 'Extinction', 'trilogy', 'began', 'Biogenesis', 'end', 'season', '6', 'Mulder', 'alternate', 'reality', 'children', 'Diana', 'Fowley', 'old', 'everyone', 'grow', 'old', 'die', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'then', 'alien', 'Armegeddon', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Scully', 'touch', 'stone', 'ordeal', 'so', 'other', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Sein', 'Und', 'Zeit', 'Closure', 'Mulder', 'find', 'closure', 'regard', 'Samantha', 'did', 'not', 'episode', 'first', 'further', 'consideration', 'feel', 'satisfied', 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'resolve', 'Samantha', 'abduction', 'Probably', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'remember', 'idea', 'quot', 'walk-ins', 'quot', 'was', 'introduced', 'back', 'season', '2', 'Red', 'Museum', 'episode', 'Seeing', 'Samantha', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lady', '14', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'me.Some', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'are', 'season', '7', 'including', 'Rush', 'Goldberg', 'Variation', 'Amazing', 'Maleeni', 'Signs', 'Wonders', 'Chimera', 'Je', 'Souhaite', 'are', 'extremely', 'clever', 'intriguing.But', 'mostly', 'want', 'comment', 'Things', 'episode', 'written', 'directed', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'somehow', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'very', 'recently', 'Scully', 'power', 'Present', 'Moment', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'form', 'synchronistic', 'events', 'appearance', 'woman', 'may', 'be', 'interpreted', 'angel', 'clear', 'up', 'unresolved', 'situation', 'past', 'Most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'episode', 'general', 'concensus', 'Scully', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant.It', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Scully', 'would', 'finally', 'almost', 'seven', 'years', 'X', 'Files', 'begin', 'realize', 'not', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'adequately', 'explained', 'science', 'also', 'sense', 'standpoint', 'Scully', 'now', '35', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'many', 'people', 'start', 'become', 'spiritual', 'consistent', 'previous', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'Sea', 'season', '3', 'Revelations', 'season', '5', 'All', 'Souls', 'etc', 'X', 'File', 'was', 'mystical', 'nature', 'when', 'Mulder', 'was', 'skeptic', 'Scully', 'one', 'who', 'quot', 'saw', 'signs.', 'quot', 'also', 'set', 'stage', 'Season', '8', 'when', 'Doggett', 'joined', 'show', 'Scully', 'became', 'believer.The', 'only', 'thing', 'preventing', '5', 'star', 'review', 'presence', 'really', 'bad', 'episodes', 'Millenium', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Hollywood', 'AD', 'hey', '18', 'good', 'ones', '22', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad']",The X-Files: Season 7

It destroys the previous six seasons buildup of the main plot and goes haywire.  The seventh season becomes new agey, metaphysical, and religious.  I never did like the idea that a by the book scientist, like Scully is supposed to be, would be a Christian but I put up with it because the overall plot was still good but this season takes and changes the fundamental designs of the characters.  Any scientist worth anything would know about Arthur C. Clarkes three laws of technology which would put Scully in a very strange position to judge the scientific evidence she discovers during investigations as silly but still believe in God.  For Mulder to go on a metaphysical journey to the world of lost children to find his sister is just destructive to the premise of the show.

But a weak episode of this show is like a weaker beatles song. IT's still good.  You could sense a decline here as the show was going on. they had way too many humorous episodes that were just silly. If they had done less of those no one would complain. but those eps like the genie one were still entertaining. Obviously they alternated way too much between serious and lighthearted for some people's taste , and to be honest I would have like more serious ones.  But they rebounded next season to complete greatness again. Still fans should enjoy this  season as it's typical x files , with lots of monsters and sci fi stuff. The video game episode was the weakest of the season but it still has the lone gunmen in it , so that helps.  The lovely mimi Rodgers was in a few eps as well.On dvd this looks decent and it was shot in widescreen by this time. So the one star reviewer is wrong.  There is even a good fox crossover episode with cops.  Which lasted on the air for almost 30 years? and may still be on some network.  SO if you are fan , you will enjoy this one. Probably most of it as much as the past eps and seasons. But some of it is more tongue in cheek than past efforts. Which angered a few viewers.

However, now that the DVD sets have been reduced in price, I had the opportunity to start watching the show. Right off the bat, I was hooked immediately and with each passing season the show became established in my eyes as one of the best and most addictive sci-fi shows ever created. The overall opinion of most of the fans is that the first six seasons of the show are the best, and that seasons seven through nine are mainly average. Another complaint from the fans is that since season seven is Duchovny's last full season with the show, that he did not put as much energy into the character Fox Mulder as he did in the past. Well I am here to tell you that not only is Duchovny still at the top of his game, but season seven is a great season overall and extremely underrated.My expectations for the seventh season going in were extremely low, and after I finished, I was literally in shock at how good the season turned out to be. While season six still remains the best season of the show, the seventh season is definately one of the most enjoyable seasons of the entire show in my opinion. There a few episodes from season seven that are up for being part of my top ten list such as X-Cops in which Mulder and Scully are put into an actual episode of the show COPS while in search of a monster, The Amazing Meelini in which Mulder and Scully investigate the death of a magician, The Goldberg Variation in which Mulder and Scully meet the luckiest man on earth that manages to pass bad luck onto everyone around him, Je Souhaite in which Mulder discovers a 500 year old genie, and the amazing season finale Requiem. Other episodes worth mentioning are Millenium in which the character Frank Black from the show Millenium makes an appearance, Hungry, Rush, Signs and Wonders, and Orison in which the serial killer Donnie Faster who abducted Scully in season two makes a return.Overall, the seventh season is one of the best of the entire show based on what I have seen so far. I have yet to see the eigth and ninth seasons, but with seasons five and six being as good as they were, and season seven being Duchovny's last full one, I doubt the show gets any better than the first seven seasons. The DVD set manages to be great once again.

736924,A376YDPAWRIX1C,B000089RT0,"mugsy ""mugsy1963""","[5, 8]","I love this show but this season was a disappointment.  I copied all these episodes on tape so I wouldn't buy the DVD set, but I will probably buy this set since I bought the prior six and I cannot be stopped!! First, the acting. I have no problems with the acting of either Duchovny or Anderson. The WRITERS have completely screwed up the characters! The stories are more light. I do not especially care for the flirty interaction between Mulder (M) & Scully (S). The show became a SOAP OPERA for God's sake!! This season has M being a little too carefree and laid back with his job and has Scully wearing clothing too small for her size. Did she get her breasts done or is she now wearing a Wonder Bra to get M's attention? These two seem so out of step in this season. Could it be that the WRITERS got rid of the Syndicate a little too soon and didn't know what to do with M & S? Could it be that M's quest to find his sister was of no use?Second, the quality of the episodes:Pros: Je Souhaite (Genie gives M three wishes. Bittersweet episode. Love seeing S all excited over her find and her reaction to the mouthless guy. I always wondered why M did not wish that S was fertile. Obvious relationship change in a scene in the end between M & S.), X-Cops (Cross-over ep. M was actually back to his ""Spooky"" self--all exuberant. S was embarrassed. Funny how M took so long to knock down the door in the end (Maybe M is not so macho.), and the mytharc of The Sixth Extinction/The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati (Diana Fowley is murdered.  YEAH!!! S finally sees a flying saucer. M & S's bond is strengthened. Beautiful mytharc. Duchovny & Anderson are great in these episodes.).Cons: Where do I begin? Like what happened to the Monkees, when you let the stars write their own material, the quality usually goes down. (1) all things (Anderson wrote & directed. I find it hard to believe that so noble S would have an affair with a married man (she did have affection for older men) and I also find it even harder to believe that, after finally getting laid, she is not smiling when she leaves M. S is majorly PO'd in this ep. I do love the look M gives S in the end.),(2) Hollywood A.D. (Duchovny wrote & directed this ep. Movie  screenwriter wants to use an X-File as a basis for a movie. This ep is a mixed bag. It is a little too cutesy (especially the dancing zombies). It does have some funny moments (S running around in heels is the best.). I do love how Duchovny writes S (she is more happy, giggly, and sweet.). No real X-File in the ep. His 6th Season The Unnatural is sooooo much better.), and (3) En Ami (CSM wrote & directed this ep. S lies to M and believes CSM? CSM wants to save the world? Right.).Other cons: (4) Fight Club (Two sisters cause commotion. Annoying characters and uninteresting story.), and (5) First Person Shooter (Similar to the movie, ""Tron"" (I might be showing my age.). Way too campy.).All the other eps are mediocre. I have mixed feelings for the mytharc Sein Und Zeit/Closure.  It is a beautifully shot ep and Duchovny does a great job (No, he is not bored in the ep.). I just hate how the WRITERS explained the Samantha issue. Couldn't they have had M find her alive? I also have mixed feelings for Requiem. Wow, how original...M gets abducted by a spaceship. ""I'm pregnant."" What were the WRITERS thinking of? M & S should have become lovers at the end of the series, not here. Especially since the WRITERS gave us hardly an inclination that they were lovers (other than the sudden spooning scene in this ep which kind of shocked me.).This season is only for hardcore fans.

736925,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000089RT0,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 3]","Season 7 was the beginning of a transitional period for The X-Files; the lead stars (especially David Duchovny) were growing disatisfied with their roles, and it would only be a matter of time before big changes would occur.  The opening season premiere two-parter &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot; and &quot;Amor Fati&quot; appears to try to expand the mythology of the series, but, and this is a stretch, comes off as quite unbelieveable.  The season finale &quot;Requiem&quot; is like this as well, leaving incomprohensable loose ends and a cliffhanger that left viewer's mouths open.  The one shot episodes are the true highlights of Season 7, including &quot;Hungry&quot; (guest starring Final Destination's Chad E. Donnella as a brain eating mutant), &quot;Millennium&quot; which is an off shoot of creator Chris Carter's other ill-fated Fox show and guest stars Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank Black (and we get to see Mulder and Scully have a New Year's kiss), &quot;X-Cops&quot; which finds Mulder and Scully in a Cops-esque episode, and &quot;Theef&quot; which guest stars a revenge driven Billy Drago.  Season 7 is undoubtadly the worst season of the series (I can't stand the &quot;Hollywood AD&quot; episode), but during the time this season aired, it was still the best series on TV.

736926,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000089RT0,OverTheMoon,"[2, 3]","The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. This season is in Widescreen 1.78:1X-Files: Season seven is full of Special Agent Mulder but effectively he leaves the X Files at the end of this season only to make guest star appearances in the next two seasons, so this is the last season to see Mulder  full-time. Season seven begins with Mulder facing a problem of an extraterrestrial telepathy that threatens his life. Scully is off trying to discover the meaning of life in terms of new facts that have presented themselves in religion and biology. A whole pile of questions concerning the alien agenda are answered in the first few episodes and what happened to Mulder's sister. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is back along with Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) make a few shows. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) makes a return. Special Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) is dead as is Agent Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Season seven of the X-Files is mostly about - Alien hegemony, telepathy, mutants, luck, Millennium's Frank Black, speed, demons, magicians, Christian snake handling, Mulder's sister, reality TV, computer games, celtic voodoo, cure for cancer, wild women, love, Hollywood, tobacoo, fighting, genies and Mulder's abduction. This Season changes to try and provide a new type of humour halfway through and so the style changes along with the X files / Cops hybrid show and the mixing in of Millennium (You may want to see all of Millennium before you watch this Season as it ended before Season 7). Season 7 has a lot to offer. Of course it really all hinges on the two episodes `Closer' about Mulder's Sister and Mulder's finale in `Requiem'. Season 7 is probably the oddest of the Seasons because of the pace changes and David Duchovny resigning himself for only guest star roles in the last two Seasons (apparently he wanted to do other things). It is sad to think that this is the end to Spooky and we have enjoyed being with him now for a run of 7 Seasons which lasted 7 years. Still he does show up in the other two Seasons so pressing on we still want to find out what Dana has yet to uncover about alien conspiracy in Season 8 without the Fox.",5,The Mulder Abduction (where

736931,A27MCNZZI03RII,B000089RT0,Philip S,"[0, 0]","This is the last season where Mulder and Scully are partnered throughout and as such, many consider it the last true season of X Files. Many fans felt it should have been the last season altogether. The great thing about the seventh season is that so much is wrapped up that it could actually serve well as the series' finale. True, it leaves a few big questions unanswered and even ends on a cliffhanger but the season works hard to conclude much of Mulder's character threads, his sister's abduction chief among them, and provides a good deal of closure to the character.The two epsiode thread focusing on Mulder's sister is really great, as is 'En Ami,' a really interesting episode where Scully and The Smoking Man take a road trip and we get to learn a bit more about the infamous villain. However, the best is the season finale and the particularly wonderful acting between the two lead characters, it's rather bittersweet since we know the end to their seven-year partnership is near.The weakest part of the season is that it lacks a major alien-conspiracy story arc, it having effectively ended the season prior, and therefore doesn't build well. Key characters are brought back, some of which I didn't think would be seen again, and there are a few great mythology episodes but it just feels as if Chris Carter tried unsuccessfully to construct another elaborate conspiracy tale but ran out of time or substance. Perhaps the alien colonization tale that ran throughout the first six seasons and the titular movie was just so well done that it couldn't be matched.Still, what does remain of the mythology is interesting and will want to be seen by fans and Carter does do an admirable job of concentrating on the stand-alone/monster-of-the-week episodes (my favorites being 'All Things' which was written and directed by Gillian Andersen herself, 'X-Cops' and 'Je Souhaite').The bottom line is that season seven has to be seen by fans because it answers some big very questions and more importantly, it marks the end of possibly the greatest TV/film duo in history.

736935,A1XMVQI9WE07QF,B000089RT0,Robert Gallihan,"[0, 1]","Season 7 is probably one of the weakest seasons of the X-Files. But it remains X-Files at its worst is better than most tv out there today. Season 7 suffered mainly because it was Duchovny's last season, and at several points you can tell he wants to be anywhere but on the set. Also, since the colonization plot line was resolved in season 6 the mythology suffered. Alot of the episodes have bad storylines, such as Rush, an episode dealing with a couple of teens who can move super fast. First Person Shooter is a stupid premise to begin with [the Lone Gunmen are stuck in a virtual reality game and Mulder has to save them] and features Duchovny drudging through a script that isn't giving him much to want to work for. And that leads me to the next problem. The scripts were painfully bad at times, and it shows that the actors, although wanting to try and make a bad script good, it just isn't possible with some of the scripts. And to make matters worse, even the mythology episodes weren't very exciting. Sixth Extinctio 1 and 2 are for the most part boring, and the revelation in part 2 is anti climactic. Other times, ideas done in past episodes were redone, such as Signs and Wonders. However, when season 7 had a good script and a good, original idea the episode turned out great. Hungry is told from the perspective of a brain eating monster who wants to kick the habit. The Amazing Maleeni is about two fueding magicians, whose fighting is actually a cover for a heist. all things, written and directed by Gillian Anderson is a powerful episode, that gives us some more insight into Scully, and why she gave up a  career in medicine to be and agent. Duchovny's Hollywood A.D. has the X-Files being made into a movie, some hilarious scenes in that one. The season finale Requiem is a tour de force with Mulder and Scully going back to where there first case took place to investigate a downed UFO. One of the best X-Files ending in the history of the show. I am glad though that they season went out on a high note, and although it had it's missteps was still alright. Luckily, the show would recover from the missteps of season 7 with the great season 8.",3,"Not bad, but definentely not good",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2167,"['Season', '7', 'probably', 'one', 'weakest', 'seasons', 'X-Files', 'X-Files', 'worst', 'better', 'most', 'tv', 'there', 'today', 'Season', '7', 'suffered', 'mainly', 'was', 'Duchovny', 'last', 'season', 'several', 'points', 'can', 'tell', 'be', 'anywhere', 'set', 'Also', 'colonization', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'resolved', 'season', '6', 'mythology', 'suffered', 'Alot', 'episodes', 'have', 'bad', 'storylines', 'such', 'Rush', 'episode', 'dealing', 'couple', 'teens', 'who', 'can', 'move', 'super', 'fast', 'First', 'Person', 'Shooter', 'stupid', 'premise', 'begin', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'are', 'stuck', 'virtual', 'reality', 'game', 'Mulder', 'save', ']', 'features', 'Duchovny', 'drudging', 'script', ""n't"", 'giving', 'much', 'want', 'work', 'next', 'problem', 'scripts', 'were', 'painfully', 'bad', 'times', 'actors', 'wanting', 'try', 'make', 'bad', 'script', 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'possible', 'scripts', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'even', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'exciting', 'Sixth', 'Extinctio', '1', '2', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'boring', 'revelation', 'part', '2', 'anti', 'climactic', 'Other', 'times', 'ideas', 'done', 'past', 'episodes', 'were', 'redone', 'such', 'Signs', 'Wonders', 'However', 'when', 'season', '7', 'had', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'original', 'idea', 'episode', 'turned', 'out', 'great', 'Hungry', 'told', 'perspective', 'brain', 'eating', 'monster', 'who', 'kick', 'habit', 'Amazing', 'Maleeni', 'two', 'fueding', 'magicians', 'fighting', 'actually', 'cover', 'heist', 'things', 'written', 'directed', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'powerful', 'episode', 'more', 'insight', 'Scully', 'why', 'gave', 'up', 'career', 'medicine', 'be', 'agent', 'Duchovny', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.', 'X-Files', 'being', 'made', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'one', 'season', 'finale', 'Requiem', 'tour', 'force', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'going', 'back', 'where', 'first', 'case', 'took', 'place', 'investigate', 'downed', 'UFO', 'One', 'best', 'X-Files', 'ending', 'history', 'show', 'am', 'glad', 'season', 'went', 'out', 'high', 'note', 'had', 'missteps', 'was', 'still', 'alright', 'Luckily', 'show', 'would', 'recover', 'missteps', 'season', '7', 'great', 'season', '8']",The X-Files: Season 7
736936,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000089RT0,Robert Moore,"[117, 124]","The new slimpack releases of Seasons 7 through 9-which are essentially the original sets with the extras disc removed as well as many other special features-will complete the entire rerelease of all the X-FILES in affordable editions.  I've been disappointed to find many of the special features missing in the first six volumes, but given that I couldn't afford the original editions, I'm all in all delighted to finally own my own copies, instead of relying on video stores and Netflix.Season Seven is, on the one hand, unquestionably the weakest of the first seven that featured David Duchovny fulltime, and perhaps even weaker than Season Eight when Duchovny was only a part time member of the cast. On the other hand, the series still had more outstanding episodes than the vast majority of shows in TV history. So, my five-star rating reflects the show compared with other series, not with other seasons in its own run. In my opinion, the only season weaker than this one is the unfortunate Season Nine, with the near complete loss of David Duchovny and the weak overall story line.Why did Season Seven fail to measure up to other X-Files seasons? First, there was the loss of the overall alien colonization story line. The season starts with a carry over of the final episode of Season Six, that seems to be reasserting an alien arc, but in fact this is a false promise, and the story told in that brief arc more or less disappears from the show. The problem, in fact, the show had in its final three seasons was the lack of a consistent and compelling story arc. There are efforts at story arcs, but the ""super soldiers"" arc that becomes full blown in Season Nine was riffled with inconsistencies, and was definitely not compelling. Still, the loss of Mulder in Season Eight provided a focus for that Season, while Season Nine at least had the opportunity of exploring the new partnership of Doggett and Reyes. Season Seven essentially had memories of the six seasons that preceded it.Nonetheless, Season Seven still contained many absolutely outstanding individual episodes. From beginning to end of the series, the writers never lost the ability to concoct a killer tale to be told in 43 minutes. ""X-Cops"" is a classic among the Mulder-Scully parody episodes, with the real-life production crew of the show COPS capturing the duo on videotape as an X-File collides with a police investigation supposedly being covered for the show. Typically, Scully spends most of the episode glaring disdainfully at the cameramen, while Mulder delightfully welcomes their presence. The dramatic highlight might be the heart-rending two-parter of ""Sein und Zeit"" (with apologies to Martin Heidegger) and ""Closure,"" which features one of the best single-episode guest appearances ever by Anthony Heald (a role so outstanding that a reprisal of the role would have seem necessary, but which sadly never occurred) as a man who claims he has visions of departed children. Images from those episodes are among some of the most haunting in the series of the show. ""Millennium"" features what is technically Mulder and Scully's first kiss (with Mulder commenting afterwards, technically commenting on the Y2K predictions of disaster, ""See, the world didn't end""). The intensely romantic non-romance between Mulder and Scully becomes such a joke that in ""Fight Club"" Mulder mentions a doppelganger pair of agents who had, believe it or not, been together for seven years but had not had a romantic relationship. ""En Ami"" is a marvelous swan song for the Cigarette Smoking Man, as he persuades Scully to help him in a caper (he would reappear later in the season to die, but would thereafter tragically be missing from the show, another problem the show had in its final two seasons). ""all things"" (lower cap) is my personal favorite of the season, an absolutely astonishing tour de force by Gillian Anderson that reveals depths of talent in a host of directions that no one could have anticipated. She wrote, directed, and acted in the episode (with Mulder largely absent) as Scully unexpectedly reencounters a former professor/mentor, a man who was married at the time she and he had what was evidently a torrid love affair, revealing more about Scully's past than we had ever learned before. The show is outstanding on multiple levels, including visually and narratively (as well as musically, helped not merely by Mark Snow's usually brilliant score but by contributions by Moby). It also features the best teaser in the history of the show, with Scully at the beginning dressing in what turns out to be Mulder's bathroom, and leaving the apartment with a naked Mulder in his bed. The episode is so outstanding the viewer is only left to wonder why Gillian Anderson wrote and directed only this one. Probably my favorite Scully episode since the one where she learned that she had, inexplicably, a genetic daughter.There were also some disappointing moments. ""Hollywood A.D."" simultaneously was one of the funniest and worse episodes, a weak X-file with a funny backstory of a Hollywood producer (a friend of Skinner) following Mulder and Scully in order to gather background for a Hollywood film. Though much in the episode is wooden, there are some precious moments, such as the producer talking in the phone to studio execs: ""No, its an optical illusion. She is actually quite tall"" (obviously referring to Scully--I have always been extremely sceptical about the 5'3 or 5'2 that is often given as Gillian Anderson's height). Also wonderful is the exquisite pairing the wildly improbable Gary Shandling as Fox Mulder with Tea Leoni (in real life Mrs. David Duchovny) as Scully. Anyone who saw Gary Shandling's THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW knows that David Duchovny was one of ""Larry Sanders's"" more frequent guests, with many jokes about Duchovny having a cursh on Sanders, so that Shandling's playing Mulder is a fairly complex in-joke. Another perfect moment in the episode is Leoni asking Scully to show her how she is able to run in heels. We then see while Shandling and Mulder talk in the foreground, Scully in the distant background sprinting from one side of the stage to the other while Leoni looks on.But for me the biggest disappointment is the final episode, ""Requiem,"" which is more or less Mulder's exit from the show. Although he would reappear in a few episodes in the final two seasons, this episode ends the seven-season partnership between Mulder and Scully. The episode, despite some fine moments, just didn't seem to have the ""gravitas"" that such a key episode would seem to require. It did nicely take place in the same town in Oregon that saw Mulder and Scully have their first adventure together in Season One, but all in all it was not one of the more remarkable episodes.In the end, the ending of the greatest partnership in TV history is what creates an indescribable sadness at the end of the season. There would be two final seasons, with many great new episodes, but if you had to point to the single thing that made THE X-FILES such an amazing phenomena, it was--along with the great writing--the exquisite pairing of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny as Mulder and Scully.  Many of us remain hopeful that there will be a future movie.  We know that the key figures have discussed it and have all expressed a willingness.  But so far we have had no definite indications that Mulder and Scully will get together again.  Hopefully the truth is out there.",5,A bittersweet year in which the greatest TV duo ever spend their last season together,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,7470,"['new', 'slimpack', 'releases',

TV is something for lying on the couch, eating chips and drinking an adult beverage. I've watched things while flipping channels of which I am ashamed. Strongest Man competitions. A few minutes of Golden Girls. It's addictive.But then there's what I'll buy and keep in my house - which brings me to The X-Files Season ""Whatever after Season 6."" I say this because I own seasons 1-6 on DVD. But my funds are not endless, and my house is filling up. One simply must have standards of some sort, and the last few seasons aren't up to them.Frankly, season 6 wasn't the best, but at least there is a natural series wrap in the middle of the season. The rest of the X-Files seasons are confused and disappointing. I remember watching every week hoping for that old Wow I used to get. Didn't happen.There was definitely a continued emphasis on the odd humor angle in this season, and some attempts at creative staging, such as the documentary style that was also used in a Season 6 episode. But the stories are losing their edge, and what was once creative and different had become entrenched formula. We've been there with this show. Done that.I believe that the relationships were also beginning to change. The chemistry was between the cast wasn't as good, or at least didn't translate to the screen. It's not as bad as it becomes in the next season, The Season of Skully's Perpetual Frown,"" but it's getting there. And don't be [drawn] into the whole ""David wrote and directed Hollywood A.D"" thing.

The best episodes did what the series always did best. ""Hungry"" told the story of a creature that sucks out brains to live and regrets every minute of it. It's a compelling episode because for the first time we see the point of view of the monster.  ""The Goldberg Variation"" about a guy with all the luck in the world and disaster for anyone who messes with him. ""X-Cops"" plays as a witty parody of the Fox TV show ""Cops"". Shot in the same style as ""Cops"" it perfectly captures both the absurdity and sense of danger in that show. Although ""Hollywood AD"" written and directed by David Duchovny has its moments it just doesn't gel for me personally but does have fine performances. Garry Shandling and Mrs. Duchovny Tea Leoni are cast as Mulder and Scully in a movie version of one of their cases. It's a clever parody of why so many Hollywood projects that look so promising go bad.""The Sixth Extinction"" and ""Amor Fati"" have a compelling stories at their core but are overcome by some hamfisted writing by Chris Carter. Still, the show is visually impressive and features some strong performances. In this particular episode Scully goes to an excavation site along the African coast to uncover the meaning of strange markings on an alien spaceshift buried under the beach in order to save Mulder. He has been infected by an alien virus triggered by the rubbings from the craft's exterior that is burning out his brain by increasing synaptic activity at breathtaking speed.""Sein Und Zeit"" and ""Closure"" are more successful episodes. The first episode deals with the disappearence of a girl with an odd note left behind apparently by her own mother. In ""Closure"" Mulder discovers what truly happened to his sister after all his years of searching. The latter episode is moving particularly if you've followed the series from the first episode. In ""En Ami"" the Cigarette Smoking Man returns seeking Scully's help; he claims to be dying and he also claims that he and Scully can save the lives of others that, like Scully, have been abducted and returned. To this he needs her help and she must trust him. Actress Gillian Anderson writes and directs the marvelous ""All Things"". The season closes the way the show began with a follow up to an episode from the first season involving abducted teenagers. The aftermath of these events set up another story arc involving another nasty alien plot.This set comes with commentary tracks on ""First Person Shooter by Chris Carter, Gillian Anderson on ""All Things"" and writer Vince Gilligan on ""Je Sohaite"". A couple of episodes have deleted scenes that you can integrate into the episode by going to the menu and activating it.

There are several reasons why I just couldn't enjoy it as much as previous seasons.With the destruction of the Syndicate and all previous mytharcs dropped, the new arc started in the last episode of season 6 just didn't play out well in first 2 episodes of season 7. This story line has gotten so much out of control and became so ""philosophical,"" I simply couldn't understand what was going on. Same goes for ""The Closure"" episode which was supposed to finally end the mystery of Samantha Mulder's disappearance. It certainly didn't give me much closure except for confirming Samantha was in fact dead. What was ""En Ami"" about anyway? I liked last episode of the season, some brilliance from past seasons came back, but I felt that story deserved more screen time. Considering that this episode was meant to be the last of the show, it sure was a cliffhanger.The handling of the relationship between Scully and Mulder was really irritating. I don't mind the idea of a platonic relationship between these two, but why then inject the unnecessary teasers and allude to their being intimate without actually confirming it? There is only so much teasing I can take. Also, why was Scully so depressed most of this season? She was so sad majority of the time, I just wanted to quit.Finally, there were not that many truly good episodes that we came to love. Too many episodes had emotional and philosophical instead of regular investigative content.

736948,AP3B615GM191G,B000089RT0,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","The Seventh Season of the X-Files is all about emotion.  Whether taking the form of developing the Mulder-Scully romantic relationship or providing long-awaited closure to key plotlines, this season packs an emotional punch.  Though perhaps beginning to stretch themselves a bit thin in the stand-alone episode department, this season still receives five stars from me due to its handling of some of the show's most intimate topics.  Let's quickly look at how emotions played a big role in this season:Mythology: In the two-part (""The Sixth Extinction"" and ""Amor Fati"") season premiere, Agents Mulder and Scully are separated from each other both physically and mentally.  While Scully works to decipher the mysterious held by the object found in the ocean, Mulder is tempted (ala ""The Last Temptation of Christ"") by the Cigarette-Smoking Man (who we find out is more intimately involved with Mulder than previously thought) with a life of familial bliss, away from all the worries of reality.  Many emotional reunions (including the return of a character last seen in Season One) make this episode a classic mythological X-Files tale.Mid-way through the season (as the writers/producers of the show again thought that this may be the final season), the episodes ""Sein Und Zeit"" and ""Closure"" bring resolution to the exact fate of Samantha Mulder, the driving force behind Mulder's desire to pursue X-Files cases.  The finale of this plot-arc will have long-time fans wiping tears from their eyes.Also, in ""En Ami"", the Cigarette-Smoking Man again shows up, this time tempting Agent Scully with an item that, as a medical doctor, she cannot resist.  In this episode, we also find that Old Smokey's days may be numbered.Stand-Alone: As I mentioned earlier, the quality of the stand-alone episodes in this season diminished from previous efforts.  Cross-overs with the shows Millenium (""Millenium"") and COPS (""X-Cops"") produced less than thrilling episodes, while ""Rush"", ""Brand X"", and ""Fight Club"" were nowhere near standard X-Files quality.  However, it was also clear that the writers still had some ability to churn out quality scripts (fans just had to, for really the first time in the show's history, weed out a few bad ones to find the good): ""Orison"" brings back a ""favorite"" past villain, ""Signs and Wonders"" is a great religious-themed episode, and ""Theef"" is a genuinely creepy story.  Also, the comedic episodes ""Je Souhaite"" and ""Hollywood A.D."" were strong efforts that would have fit in to any previous season.To conclude, the Seventh Season of the X-Files has its strenght in the emotion of its episodes.  While, for the first time in the show's history, some episodes dragged, the ones that worked pulled on the heartstrings like never before.  The season finale, ""Requiem"", personifies that emotion.
