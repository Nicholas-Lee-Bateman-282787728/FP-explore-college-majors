The exercises that work well, running, jumping are fine. The resistance band exercises are horrible.  Why- The system is not sensitive enough to ""read"" what your doing and the controls have to held in the ""exact"" right position for the game to read your movement, this equals major frustration when your holding the resistance bands above your head for 5 minutes because the game cant read what your doing.  Then as other reviewers have reported the resistance bands break.  I worked through the easy level and it was bad and during the intermediate level it was intolorable as a 20 minute workout was taking an hour to complete due to the inept reading by the Wii system. This problem takes the fun out of playing this game. I took mine to a video store and traded it off.  I cannot recommend this game for working out.  Maybe if they remake it using the motion plus system it might work correctly, who knows, but as it is now, its a total waste of your money.",1,"Concept=A+,  Actual game play D-",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,1062,"['concept', 'idea', 'game', 'great', 'problem', 'techonology', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'real', 'exercises', 'work', 'well', 'running', 'jumping', 'are', 'fine', 'resistance', 'band', 'exercises', 'are', 'horrible', 'Why-', 'system', 'not', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'read', 'what', 'doing', 'controls', 'have', 'held', 'exact', 'right', 'position', 'game', 'read', 'movement', 'equals', 'major', 'frustration', 'when', 'holding', 'resistance', 'bands', 'head', '5', 'minutes', 'game', 'cant', 'read', 'what', 'doing', 'Then', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'reported', 'resistance', 'break', 'worked', 'easy', 'level', 'was', 'bad', 'intermediate', 'level', 'was', 'intolorable', '20', 'minute', 'workout', 'was', 'taking', 'hour', 'complete', 'due', 'inept', 'reading', 'Wii', 'system', 'problem', 'fun', 'playing', 'game', 'took', 'mine', 'video', 'store', 'traded', 'off', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'game', 'working', 'out', 'Maybe', 'remake', 'using', 'motion', 'system', 'might', 'work', 'correctly', 'who', 'now', 'total', 'waste', 'money']",N/A

As the mother of a almost 2 yr old boy, something always seemed to come up and exercise got pushed aside or ignored all together.  The game came in on Friday, and I've been so excited to use it.  It's pretty easy, but after the 1st workout-I was completely sore.  It totally kicked my butt.  That's exactly what I need.  Last night I worked out, and when it was over-I jumped right into a 2nd workout.  Now I am exited to get back in there for another workout.  I have never been so anxious to workout.

1216552,AXBX1GKN3H0E8,B001MBUGLY,"Aubri Webb ""Aubri""","[1, 5]","Let me start by telling you what was WRONG with this game...1.  The program doesn't always recognize when I've made the movement it's telling me to make.  With several of the exercises, I was doing exactly what the figure on the screen was, but it wasn't acknowledging that I was doing so.  This made it almost impossible to complete some of the activities because it simply didn't recognize that I had done it.2.  It has the opposite problem of the original Wii Fit.  With the original Wii Fit, you had to select each and every exercise separately and couldn't just choose a list of activities for it to run you through.  Here, you have the opposite issue.  You can't just select an activity and do it, you have to create a workout list and preset the activities you want to try or use their ready-to-go routines.3.  It has ways for you to practice sports moves for different sports, but no actual game for you to play to apply those actions.  You can't play a round of Basketball or Volleyball, but you can practice passing, throwing, spiking and the rest.As to what's GOOD about this game, I liked the variety of activities and if you are up for the pre-set workout routines, you'll definitely get a good workout in.  Some of the sports practice was fun, and I liked that it came with the resistance band and leg strap for the nunchuck.At the end of the day, I just don't recommend it for someone looking for something easy to use for a fun way to get some exercise in.",1,Just NOT fun and I fought with it!,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,1472,"['Let', 'start', 'telling', 'was', 'WRONG', 'game', '1', 'program', ""n't"", 'always', 'recognize', 'when', ""'ve"", 'made', 'movement', 'telling', 'make', 'several', 'exercises', 'was', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'figure', 'screen', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'acknowledging', 'was', 'doing', 'so', 'made', 'almost', 'impossible', 'complete', 'activities', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'had', 'done', 'it.2', 'opposite', 'problem', 'original', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'original', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'had', 'select', 'exercise', 'separately', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'choose', 'list', 'activities', 'run', 'Here', 'have', 'opposite', 'issue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'select', 'activity', 'do', 'have', 'create', 'workout', 'list', 'preset', 'activities', 'want', 'try', 'use', 'ready-to-go', 'routines.3', 'ways', 'practice', 'sports', 'moves', 'different', 'sports', 'actual', 'game', 'play', 'apply', 'actions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'round', 'Basketball', 'Volleyball', 'can', 'practice', 'passing', 'throwing', 'spiking', 'rest.As', 'what', 'GOOD', 'game', 'liked', 'variety', 'activities', 'are', 'up', 'pre-set', 'workout', 'routines', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'sports', 'practice', 'was', 'fun', 'liked', 'came', 'resistance', 'band', 'leg', 'strap', 'nunchuck.At', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'someone', 'looking', 'something', 'easy', 'use', 'fun', 'way', 'get', 'exercise']",N/A

But here's the thing...usually I have to FORCE myself to workout. I wound up having so much fun with this that I wasn't even watching the clock, or the calories I was burning...I didn't want to quit!Imagine my shock when I did look at the caloric burn and discover it was hundreds of calories more than I usually burn when I do a full circuit workout with top notch trainers!! Now THAT makes this well worth it! In fact, it was OVER what the calories on the screen showed I burned (when someone else in the house tried it out, their caloric burn was exactly what the screen says). Caloric estimations on sports equipment are always estimations...all they can be without reading your heart with a monitor...but I have found in the past that almost all OVERestimate how many calories you have burned. It's nice to see one really try to get it spot on and be conservative. Most people probably do truly burn the amount on the screen.Better than Wii fit as far as how many calories I burned?! By far! I am small so, bear in mind that anyone larger will burn more calories working out at the same rate I did, but on the first try at the game I burned 200 calories according to my heart rate monitor. The second time 300. And, it should be noted, that doesn't include the calories burned for strength training included on the game. Studies have shown strength training continues to burn calories for 24 hours after you workout while cardio just a few hours...and, it builds muscle which increases metabolism burning more calories even at rest. (I only burned 65 doing Wii fit according to my heart rate monitor for the same amount of time) It takeks a deficit of 3,500 calories to lose a pound so someone larger could easily lose 2 pounds a week or more by playing this game (they would burn more calories if they worked out the same rate I did. I'm 5'3"" and weight just 117 pounds.)  As for me, I have been losing a pound a week not changing my diet at all and playing it often. For me this helps me keep my weight off if I choose to go have a good restaurant meal and, more importantly, I have gained endless energy, fun and cardio heart health.Have we, perchance, finally discovered the cure to American Obesity? He He...seriously, you'll learn great FORM so that you do the workout RIGHT so you get maximum results...you'll do cardio which burns instant calories but also do strength training which builds muscle so you continue to burn calories even while at rest (quite the win/win in my idea of a workout)None of that matters, however, if you don't enjoy what you are doing or can't keep doing it. This, no matter how severe your case of ADD may be, will HOLD YOUR ATTENTION and is more fun than you'd imagine...and that means you keep doing it and that means it works better, for me personally, than any gym membership.I actually worked out longer, harder, and better, than if I had done anything else.  That truly, truly impresses me. But the fact that I felt I'd used muscles I somehow never hit before in other workouts and burned more calories while I had a smile on my face......priceless!!(p.s. this household has a workout fanatic and a workout hater and we both give it 5 stars so it reaches the chasm of everything in between!)",5,"According to my heart rate monitor, this is a mega calorie burner for me!!",1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,3474,"['When', 'hit', 'age', '43', 'assume', 'reason', 'word', 'work', 'term', 'work', 'out', 'til', 'now', 'Wow', 'set', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'always', 'do', 'have', 'over', '100', 'workout', 'dvds', 'love', 'compare', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'burn', 'here', 'thing', 'usually', 'have', 'FORCE', 'workout', 'wound', 'up', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'watching', 'clock', 'calories', 'was', 'burning', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'quit', 'Imagine', 'shock', 'when', 'did', 'look', 'caloric', 'burn', 'discover', 'was', 'hundreds', 'calories', 'more', 'usually', 'burn', 'when', 'do', 'full', 'circuit', 'top', 'notch', 'trainers', 'Now', 'THAT', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'OVER', 'what', 'calories', 'screen', 'showed', 'burned', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'house', 'tried', 'out', 'caloric', 'burn', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'screen', 'Caloric', 'estimations', 'sports', 'equipment', 'are', 'always', 'estimations', 'can', 'be', 'reading', 'heart', 'monitor', 'have', 'found', 'past', 'almost', 'OVERestimate', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'have', 'burned', 'nice', 'see', 'one', 'really', 'try', 'get', 'spot', 'be', 'conservative', 'Most', 'people', 'probably', 'do', 'truly', 'burn', 'amount', 'screen.Better', 'Wii', 'fit', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'burned', 'far', 'am', 'small', 'so', 'bear', 'mind', 'anyone', 'larger', 'will', 'burn', 'more', 'calories', 'working', 'out', 'same', 'rate', 'did', 'first', 'try', 'game', 'burned', '200', 'calories', 'according', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'second', 'time', '300', 'should', 'be', 'noted', ""n't"", 'include', 'calories', 'burned', 'strength', 'training', 'included', 'game', 'Studies', 'have', 'shown', 'strength', 'training', 'burn', 'calories', '24', 'hours', 'workout', 'cardio', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'muscle', 'metabolism', 'burning', 'more', 'calories', 'even', 'rest', 'only', 'burned', '65', 'doing', 'Wii', 'fit', 'according', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'same', 'amount', 'time', 'deficit', '3,500', 'calories', 'lose', 'pound', 'so', 'someone', 'larger', 'could', 'easily', 'lose', '2', 'pounds', 'week', 'more', 'playing', 'game', 'would', 'burn', 'more', 'calories', 'worked', 'out', 'same', 'rate', 'did', ""'m"", '5', '3', 'weight', 'just', '117', 'pounds', 'have', 'been', 'losing', 'pound', 'week', 'not', 'changing', 'diet', 'playing', 'often', 'keep', 'weight', 'choose', 'go', 'have', 'good', 'restaurant', 'meal', 'more', 'importantly', 'have', 'gained', 'endless', 'energy', 'fun', 'cardio', 'heart', 'health.Have', 'perchance', 'finally', 'discovered', 'cure', 'American', 'Obesity', 'seriously', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'great', 'FORM', 'do', 'workout', 'RIGHT', 'get', 'maximum', 'results', ""'ll"", 'do', 'cardio', 'instant', 'calories', 'also', 'do', 'strength', 'training', 'muscle', 'continue', 'burn', 'calories', 'even', 'rest', 'win/win', 'idea', 'workout', 'None', 'matters', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'doing', 'matter', 'how', 'severe', 'case', 'ADD', 'may', 'be', 'will', 'HOLD', 'YOUR', 'ATTENTION', 'more', 'fun', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'keep', 'doing', 'better', 'personally', 'gym', 'membership.I', 'actually', 'worked', 'out', 'longer', 'harder', 'better', 'had', 'done', 'anything', 'else', 'truly', 'truly', 'fact', 'felt', ""'d"", 'used', 'muscles', 'somehow', 'never', 'hit', 'before', 'other', 'workouts', 'burned', 'more', 'calories', 'had', 'smile', 'face', 'priceless', 'p.s', 'household', 'workout', 'fanatic', 'workout', 'hater', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'chasm', 'everything']",N/A

Actually as far as set up and design the two programs have a ton of similarities. But as I said previously, EA active works. I've completed my first day and no real complaints. Actually, if your substitute a resistance band for the EA active strap you can have a really great workout . . . as in just as challenging as any exercise DVD. Of coures you have to use the right band.A couple of tiny little gripes were that since they have you doing so many different type of exercises the way you handle the controls will change. But the screen prompts are good and even I was able to figure it out. Another is that they don't have a weigh in. And while the program says it uses the balance board, I did not use it the first day. However tomorrow they promise to give me new exercises so, we'll see. Regardless, I got over my need to have to have a balance board. I know there are some folks out there that hesitate if the workout program does not use the board. But the strap that ties around your leg does a good job of movement recognition. and finally, I am not blown away by the music. Its not bad but sounds to generic. (and that's taking into account the program claims to have about 6 different musical genres)Still, I felt the first workout was pretty good. And with MY resistance bands it was very good. My first work out included:RunningBicep CurlsUpright rowlungesplatform jumping on roller skates (sort of like Salom Jumping in Wii Fit)Boxing (that works great btw)and a couple of other resistance exercises I don't remember the nameand a couple of the above exercises were repeatedThere is also a calorie counter that runs as you work out.

The short story is EA Sports Active will make you sweat and, at least for me, will motivate you to exercise regularly more than any other game on the market.  This is due to the calendar style system of planned workouts via the 30 day challenge.  It's recommended, you don't need the balance board, and I will be surprised if anyone except a fitness trainer doesn't lose weight with this game.Unfortunately, there are some gripes that keep me from giving it five stars:1) The resistance band is useless to anyone except maybe a four year old.  They tell you to fold it and step on the folds to provide more resistance but that's also a joke.  The only way to get enough resistance to provide an effective upper body workout is to stretch to the point of breakage.  Don't expect an upper body workout unless you can find a replacement band somewhere.2) The (huge) leg strap will probably annoy a lot of female users who don't have thunderthighs.  They provide an accessory to once again play the foldover game and tighten it to fit on someone with a body shape similar to the trainer on the box but I can't imagine it being comfortable.3) The instructions say loose, slick. or baggy clothes ""may"" cause the leg strap attachment to slip.  Wrong.  They WILL cause the strap to slip.  I can't wear this over any shorts or sweats, loose, tight, or otherwise, without it slipping, even if it's tightened enough to cut off blood circulation.  For me, the only way to fasten it securely is to strap it directly on my leg and cover it with shorts.4) The jabbering trainer motivates way too much (like every 10 seconds).5) I think EA did the best they could with the control system available but there are still issues with certain exercises not being recognized on occasion.  I have problems with fast paced running and kicking exercises being not recognized.  I can keep the same running pace yet the game will flip flop from telling me I'm doing perfect to telling me I'm too slow.  Once the trainer starts nagging you every 10 seconds it'll put you on tilt.  For the record, I had the same problem with Wii Fit.6) The game does include the balance board in some exercises but it seems like more of an accessory item to add variety rather than to actually tap into how it can help in a workout.  I get the feeling the developers didn't really know what to do with it.7) Your daily ""score"" involves completing surveys every day asking you if you slept enough and ate your veggies.  Even though they're quickly completed they're annoying and redundant.  Maybe they should have hired Mr. T to ask me if I drank my milk.  Plus, when it asks you what other activities you've completed there is no ""none"" option.  To my knowledge, there is no way to get around this.  In other words, unless you make up something each day it won't say the survey was completed.For people having trouble getting the game to respond correctly, here are some tips that have helped me:First, regarding the strap slipping around, notice on the pictures on the box and the instruction booklet that the strap is way up there.  If you're putting the strap on the lower half or even the middle of your thigh it will likely slip down to your knee.Secondly, about the game not responding to your movements correctly.  Watch the animated characters carefully to make sure you are moving the Wii joystick in the correct position.  Many exercises have you twisting the controllers in specific directions and will not register correctly unless this is done.  Also, I have found if I move the sensor bar from below the TV to a spot above the TV (remember to change the Wii settings to reflect this) that my movements are registered more accurately.  I have no idea why this is the case but it worked for me.  Finally, when you have to stick the nunchuck in the leg strap, make sure it's jammed down there far with the end pointing straight up.  If it's angled in any way the movements don't register as accurately.Third, if you want an upper body workout, plan on getting a higher resistance band in addition to this game.  There are many sold right here on Amazon.Hope this helps.",4,A motivating workout that makes you sweat,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,4390,"['incredibly', 'popular', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'focused', 'form', 'posture', 'balance', 'right', 'down', 'exercises', 'devoted', 'breathing', 'sitting', 'still', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'more', 'Americanized', 'offering', 'containing', 'heavy', 'focus', 'cardio', 'strength', 'exercises', 'short', 'story', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'will', 'make', 'sweat', 'least', 'will', 'motivate', 'exercise', 'regularly', 'more', 'other', 'game', 'market', 'due', 'calendar', 'style', 'system', 'planned', 'workouts', '30', 'day', 'challenge', 'recommended', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'balance', 'board', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'anyone', 'fitness', 'trainer', ""n't"", 'lose', 'weight', 'game.Unfortunately', 'are', 'gripes', 'keep', 'giving', 'five', 'stars:1', 'resistance', 'band', 'useless', 'anyone', 'maybe', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'tell', 'fold', 'step', 'folds', 'provide', 'more', 'resistance', 'also', 'joke', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'enough', 'resistance', 'provide', 'effective', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'stretch', 'point', 'breakage', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'upper', 'body', 'can', 'find', 'replacement', 'band', 'somewhere.2', 'huge', 'leg', 'strap', 'will', 'probably', 'annoy', 'lot', 'female', 'users', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'thunderthighs', 'provide', 'accessory', 'once', 'again', 'play', 'foldover', 'game', 'tighten', 'fit', 'someone', 'body', 'shape', 'similar', 'trainer', 'box', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'being', 'comfortable.3', 'instructions', 'say', 'loose', 'slick', 'baggy', 'clothes', 'may', 'cause', 'leg', 'strap', 'attachment', 'slip', 'Wrong', 'WILL', 'cause', 'strap', 'slip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wear', 'shorts', 'sweats', 'loose', 'tight', 'otherwise', 'slipping', 'even', 'tightened', 'enough', 'cut', 'off', 'blood', 'circulation', 'only', 'way', 'fasten', 'securely', 'strap', 'directly', 'leg', 'cover', 'shorts.4', 'jabbering', 'trainer', 'way', 'too', 'much', '10', 'seconds', '.5', 'think', 'EA', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'control', 'system', 'available', 'are', 'still', 'issues', 'certain', 'exercises', 'not', 'being', 'recognized', 'occasion', 'have', 'problems', 'fast', 'paced', 'running', 'kicking', 'exercises', 'being', 'not', 'recognized', 'can', 'keep', 'same', 'running', 'pace', 'yet', 'game', 'will', 'flip', 'flop', 'telling', ""'m"", 'doing', 'perfect', 'telling', ""'m"", 'too', 'slow', 'trainer', 'nagging', '10', 'seconds', ""'ll"", 'put', 'tilt', 'record', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'Wii', 'Fit.6', 'game', 'include', 'balance', 'board', 'exercises', 'more', 'accessory', 'item', 'add', 'variety', 'rather', 'actually', 'tap', 'how', 'can', 'help', 'workout', 'get', 'feeling', 'developers', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'it.7', 'daily', 'score', 'completing', 'surveys', 'day', 'asking', 'slept', 'enough', 'ate', 'veggies', 'Even', ""'re"", 'quickly', 'completed', ""'re"", 'annoying', 'redundant', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'hired', 'Mr.', 'T', 'ask', 'drank', 'milk', 'when', 'what', 'other', 'activities', ""'ve"", 'completed', 'none', 'option', 'knowledge', 'way', 'get', 'other', 'words', 'make', 'up', 'something', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'survey', 'was', 'completed.For', 'people', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'game', 'respond', 'correctly', 'here', 'are', 'tips', 'have', 'helped', 'First', 'regarding', 'strap', 'slipping', 'around', 'notice', 'pictures', 'box', 'instruction', 'booklet', 'strap', 'way', 'there', ""'re"", 'putting', 'strap', 'lower', 'half', 'even', 'middle', 'thigh', 'will', 'likely', 'slip', 'down', 'knee.Secondly', 'game', 'not', 'responding', 'movements', 'correctly', 'Watch', 'animated', 'characters', 'carefully', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'moving', 'Wii', 'joystick', 'correct', 'position', 'Many', 'exercises', 'have', 'twisting', 'controllers', 'specific', 'directions', 'will', 'not', 'register', 'correctly', 'done', 'Also', 'have', 'found', 'move', 'sensor', 'bar', 'TV', 'spot', 'TV', 'remember', 'change', 'Wii', 'settings', 'reflect', 'movements', 'are', 'registered', 'more', 'accurately', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'case', 'worked', 'Finally', 'when', 'have', 'stick', 'nunchuck', 'leg', 'strap', 'make', 'sure', 'jammed', 'there', 'far', 'end', 'pointing', 'straight', 'up', 'angled', 'way', 'movements', 'do', ""n't"", 'register', 'accurately.Third', 'want', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'plan', 'getting', 'higher', 'resistance', 'band', 'addition', 'game', 'are', 'many', 'sold', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon.Hope']",N/A

This game picks up the slack and really gives you a great workout, and I can guarantee you will sweat. The exercises are well proportioned in the 30 day challenge, and they definitely don't push you too hard until you want to choose a higher difficulty. The gradual easing into the program is a big plus. The game is essentially like having your own personal trainer, but of course at a fraction of the price. And for those who would rather work out at home than go to a gym, this is an excellent idea. There are a multitude of different kinds of workouts, different skill levels, and you can combine them into your ideal program. I highly recommend this game/exercise aid, and it does complement Wii Fit as well. Not only can you use the balance board, but since Wii Fit is more focused on Yoga and balance, and Active is more about cardio and exercise in general, playing one right after the other will yield great results.

1216562,A33TTPCRVOBK3I,B001MBUGLY,Eleanor O'Brien,"[0, 0]","I got EA Sports Active the day it came out, but wanted to used it for a while before writing my review.I have played this game almost everyday since I got it.  I have encouraged several people to make the purchase.I also have Wii Fit and Gold's Gym Cardio Workout so I do have games to compare it to.The EA Sports workout is a definite workout.  When I play I break a sweat every time.  I can see noticeable toning.The things that I like:30 Day Challenge is a a month worth of preset workouts with that switch up every day to keep things interesting.  Also the workouts switch up to focus more on different body parts allowing time to rest properly.There are other preset workouts that can be changes to vary degrees of difficulty.  You have a stonger lower body you can pick hard, but need work on the upperbody choose easy.In addition you can make your own workouts.  Pick from the 25 different exercises and choose the degree of difficulty of each.I love that once you choose the workout there is a quick flow between the exercises.  This is much better than popping in and out of the menus like the Wii Fit and Gold's Cardio workout only allows limited trainer picked workouts.The exercises are broken down into 3 main body sections of upper, lower and cardio.  The cardio consists of mostly track with running, high kneee and kickbacks.  The kickbacks are killer.  For all the cardio you put the nunchuck into the leg strap that is included with the game.For the lower body there are lunges and squats and some sports games like inline skating.For many of the upper body you use the included toning band.  There are curls, alternating curls, presses and combinations.Also included are things like boxing mainly cardio, with an upperbody workout as well.Then there are several sports like drills, like baseball (batting, catching, throwing), volleyball, basketball etc.With many of the sports drills can be enhanced with the Wii board (which is not necessary).  For instance in basketball you lunge off the board to the right or left before throwing the ball to the target.So I love this game and think it is a great workout with a lot of variety.  Why didn't I give it a 5 star rating?It takes a bit of getting use to the leg strap.  You need to be sure to where is securely and occasionally when running it will slip down.  If you don't have the nunchuck in properly and securely it may not register or it will pop out.  Again this hasn't happened often, but I think the leg strap could have been designed better, maybe a snap top so that it will not pop up.You need to be careful with your form on the lunges and jump lunges. These are very challenging and if not done correctly your can hurt your knees.  It is very important to look at the way the trainer holds the remote and nunchuck.  Your hand movements and placement are very important.  If you don't get them right it will register as not going down low enough and you will go down too far or push your knee ahead of your toes.I think that this is a more hard core workout than the Wii Fit.  The Wii fit is still great, it focuses more on Yoga and core and includes cardio (but boring cardio in my opinion) EA Sports Active focuses more on cardio and strength training.  There are no specific core activities although your core is engaged in many of the exercises.I still use my Gold Cardio Workout which is primarily boxing.  Since that is the focus of the game, it does in my opinion outshine the boxing in the EA Sports Active.  The target concept of the two of them is almost identical.In closing. I love my EA Sports Active and recommend it.  It provides a great variety of exercises and a well rounded workout.  I will use it in rotation with my other two games.",4,I love to strap on and play with EA Sport Active,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,3733,"['got', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'wanted', 'used', 'while', 'writing', 'review.I', 'have', 'played', 'game', 'almost', 'everyday', 'got', 'have', 'encouraged', 'several', 'people', 'make', 'purchase.I', 'also', 'have', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'Gold', 'Gym', 'Cardio', 'Workout', 'do', 'have', 'games', 'compare', 'to.The', 'EA', 'Sports', 'workout', 'definite', 'workout', 'When', 'play', 'break', 'sweat', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'noticeable', 'toning.The', 'things', 'like:30', 'Day', 'Challenge', 'month', 'worth', 'preset', 'workouts', 'switch', 'up', 'day', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Also', 'workouts', 'switch', 'up', 'focus', 'more', 'different', 'body', 'parts', 'allowing', 'time', 'rest', 'properly.There', 'are', 'other', 'preset', 'workouts', 'can', 'be', 'changes', 'vary', 'degrees', 'difficulty', 'have', 'stonger', 'lower', 'body', 'can', 'pick', 'hard', 'need', 'work', 'upperbody', 'choose', 'easy.In', 'addition', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'workouts', 'Pick', '25', 'different', 'exercises', 'choose', 'degree', 'difficulty', 'each.I', 'love', 'once', 'choose', 'workout', 'quick', 'flow', 'exercises', 'much', 'better', 'popping', 'menus', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'Gold', 'Cardio', 'workout', 'only', 'limited', 'trainer', 'picked', 'workouts.The', 'exercises', 'are', 'broken', 'down', '3', 'main', 'body', 'sections', 'upper', 'lower', 'cardio', 'cardio', 'mostly', 'track', 'running', 'high', 'kneee', 'kickbacks', 'kickbacks', 'are', 'killer', 'cardio', 'put', 'nunchuck', 'leg', 'strap', 'included', 'game.For', 'lower', 'body', 'are', 'lunges', 'squats', 'sports', 'games', 'inline', 'skating.For', 'many', 'upper', 'body', 'use', 'included', 'toning', 'band', 'are', 'curls', 'alternating', 'curls', 'presses', 'combinations.Also', 'included', 'are', 'things', 'boxing', 'mainly', 'cardio', 'upperbody', 'workout', 'well.Then', 'are', 'several', 'sports', 'drills', 'baseball', 'batting', 'catching', 'throwing', 'volleyball', 'basketball', 'etc.With', 'many', 'sports', 'drills', 'can', 'be', 'enhanced', 'Wii', 'board', 'not', 'necessary', 'instance', 'basketball', 'lunge', 'board', 'right', 'left', 'throwing', 'ball', 'target.So', 'love', 'game', 'think', 'great', 'workout', 'lot', 'variety', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'bit', 'getting', 'use', 'leg', 'strap', 'need', 'be', 'sure', 'where', 'securely', 'occasionally', 'when', 'running', 'will', 'slip', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'nunchuck', 'properly', 'securely', 'may', 'not', 'register', 'will', 'pop', 'out', 'Again', ""n't"", 'happened', 'often', 'think', 'leg', 'strap', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'better', 'maybe', 'snap', 'top', 'will', 'not', 'pop', 'up.You', 'need', 'be', 'careful', 'form', 'lunges', 'jump', 'lunges', 'are', 'very', 'challenging', 'not', 'done', 'correctly', 'can', 'hurt', 'knees', 'very', 'important', 'look', 'way', 'trainer', 'remote', 'nunchuck', 'hand', 'movements', 'placement', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'will', 'register', 'not', 'going', 'down', 'low', 'enough', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'too', 'far', 'push', 'knee', 'ahead', 'toes.I', 'think', 'more', 'hard', 'core', 'workout', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'Wii', 'fit', 'still', 'great', 'more', 'Yoga', 'core', 'cardio', 'boring', 'cardio', 'opinion', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'more', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training', 'are', 'specific', 'core', 'activities', 'core', 'engaged', 'many', 'exercises.I', 'still', 'use', 'Gold', 'Cardio', 'Workout', 'primarily', 'boxing', 'focus', 'game', 'opinion', 'boxing', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'target', 'concept', 'two', 'almost', 'identical.In', 'closing', 'love', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'recommend', 'great', 'variety', 'exercises', 'well', 'rounded', 'workout', 'will', 'use', 'rotation', 'other', 'two', 'games']",N/A

I originally bought it because i was getting tired of the same old treadmill routine every day and wanted something that would switch it up. I had tried workout videos and kept them up for a week and then lost interested.  I love how this game will change it up every day so youre not doing the same thing.One of the things i was skeptical about was if this game was actually going to work.  Believe me, this game on a daily basis kicks my butt! Im finding muscles sore that i didnt even know i had! hahaHere are some of the other things i really liked about the game:1.)  You don't need to have a balance board to use this game! - One of the reasons i had been turned off from getting the wii fit was because of the balance board. it might just be my stubbornness but i had a real issue with spending $50 on a agame and then dropping more money on top of that for a balance board.  I love that this game gives you the option of working out with or without the balance board.2.) 30 day challenge. - I really am finding the 30 day challenge useful.  One of the reasons i wanted to get a more interactive game is because i had plateaud just running on the treadmill at the gym. i knew i had to switch up my workouts but i didnt know how.  The 30 day challenge feature is great because not only does it switch up the exercises you do from day to day (keeping you from getting bored) but it also allows you to choose what level, easy medium or hard, you want to do every day.3.) Preset and custom workouts. - I love this feature.  It's great because you can choose from a preset workout and it tells you easily how long, what the workout includes and how many calories you are going to burn. The custom workout feature is great because if you want to focus on 1 thing you can choose just those exercises.  And again it tells you how long it will be and how many calories you will burn.4.) Tracking and Goal Setting - I really like everything they have setup for tracking your progress.  You can fill out a daily journal that you can enter food, water and sweets intake for the day.  its great because at the end of 30 days (or however long you want) you can graph it and see how youve been doing.  I liked it for example because i was trying to cut down on coffee intake and it showed me how well i did over the month.  Also the goals are a great motivator and are easily changed.As you can tell i really like all of the features this game presents.The only thing i dont like about the game is that sometimes the remotes can be picky sensing movements.Hope this was helpful!",5,"Great Workout, very happy with this game!",1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,2600,"['absolutely', 'love', 'game', 'originally', 'bought', 'i', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'treadmill', 'routine', 'day', 'wanted', 'something', 'would', 'switch', 'up', 'had', 'tried', 'videos', 'kept', 'up', 'week', 'then', 'lost', 'interested', 'love', 'how', 'game', 'will', 'change', 'up', 'day', 'so', 'youre', 'not', 'doing', 'same', 'thing.One', 'things', 'i', 'was', 'skeptical', 'was', 'game', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'work', 'Believe', 'game', 'daily', 'basis', 'kicks', 'butt', 'Im', 'finding', 'muscles', 'sore', 'i', 'didnt', 'even', 'know', 'i', 'had', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'i', 'really', 'liked', 'game:1', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'balance', 'board', 'use', 'game', 'One', 'reasons', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'turned', 'off', 'getting', 'wii', 'fit', 'was', 'balance', 'board', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'stubbornness', 'i', 'had', 'real', 'issue', 'spending', '50', 'agame', 'then', 'dropping', 'more', 'money', 'top', 'balance', 'board', 'love', 'game', 'option', 'working', 'out', 'balance', 'board.2', '30', 'day', 'challenge', 'really', 'am', 'finding', '30', 'day', 'challenge', 'useful', 'One', 'reasons', 'i', 'wanted', 'get', 'more', 'interactive', 'game', 'i', 'had', 'plateaud', 'just', 'running', 'treadmill', 'gym', 'i', 'knew', 'i', 'had', 'switch', 'up', 'workouts', 'i', 'didnt', 'know', 'how', '30', 'day', 'challenge', 'feature', 'great', 'not', 'only', 'switch', 'up', 'exercises', 'do', 'day', 'day', 'keeping', 'getting', 'bored', 'also', 'choose', 'what', 'level', 'easy', 'medium', 'hard', 'want', 'do', 'day.3', 'Preset', 'custom', 'workouts', 'love', 'feature', 'great', 'can', 'choose', 'preset', 'workout', 'easily', 'how', 'long', 'what', 'workout', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'are', 'going', 'burn', 'custom', 'workout', 'feature', 'great', 'want', 'focus', '1', 'thing', 'can', 'choose', 'just', 'exercises', 'again', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'will', 'burn.4', 'Tracking', 'Goal', 'Setting', 'really', 'everything', 'have', 'setup', 'tracking', 'progress', 'can', 'fill', 'out', 'daily', 'journal', 'can', 'enter', 'food', 'water', 'sweets', 'intake', 'day', 'great', 'end', '30', 'days', 'however', 'long', 'want', 'can', 'graph', 'see', 'how', 'youve', 'been', 'doing', 'liked', 'example', 'i', 'was', 'trying', 'cut', 'down', 'coffee', 'intake', 'showed', 'how', 'well', 'i', 'did', 'month', 'Also', 'goals', 'are', 'great', 'motivator', 'are', 'easily', 'can', 'tell', 'i', 'really', 'features', 'game', 'only', 'thing', 'i', 'dont', 'game', 'sometimes', 'remotes', 'can', 'be', 'picky', 'sensing', 'movements.Hope', 'was', 'helpful']",N/A

There is great motivation built in both through a rolling calories burned counter as you work out and coaching from your personal trainer.You can also customize workouts based on any activities you particularly like or calories you want to burn or body parts you want to work on.Each exercise is thoroughly demonstrated and described before your first try and the trainer will correct you if you are not doing something the right way.  You can choose your intensity level of easy, medium or high.A couple of minor things that I would like to note are:the resistance band is rather flimsy and you have to tie it to the straps yourself which left me wondering how sturdy it is.  I may go and buy a different band rather than use the one included,the leg strap leaves velcro exposed on the inside of your thigh so it's a bit scratchy when doing running, walking, etc.finally, I would love for them to have included BMI and weight measurement along with a graph like Wii Fit has - that really helped my motivation.I am definitely in the beginner phase of working out and need to lose about 40 pounds.  For me, this is a great workout and it's a lot of fun.  For people who are already hard core into exercise, this may not be your thing.  It does have a high intensity level but I haven't even looked at that yet.Overall, if I had to choose between this and Wii Fit, I would choose this one.",4,Love Wii Active,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,1782,"['opinion', 'Wii', 'Active', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'love', 'trainers', 'avatars', 'are', 'grown', 'ups', 'not', 'little', 'Weeble', 'looking', 'things', 'really', 'enjoy', 'circuit', 'training', 'aspect', 'aerobic', 'exercise', 'strength', 'training', 'balance', 'exercises', ""'m"", 'currently', 'doing', '30', 'day', 'challenge', 'only', 'couple', 'workouts', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'difference', 'body', 'great', 'motivation', 'built', 'rolling', 'calories', 'burned', 'counter', 'work', 'out', 'coaching', 'personal', 'trainer.You', 'can', 'also', 'customize', 'workouts', 'based', 'activities', 'particularly', 'calories', 'want', 'burn', 'body', 'parts', 'want', 'work', 'on.Each', 'exercise', 'thoroughly', 'demonstrated', 'described', 'first', 'try', 'trainer', 'will', 'correct', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'way', 'can', 'choose', 'intensity', 'level', 'easy', 'medium', 'high.A', 'couple', 'minor', 'things', 'would', 'like', 'note', 'are', 'resistance', 'band', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'have', 'tie', 'straps', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'sturdy', 'may', 'go', 'buy', 'different', 'band', 'rather', 'use', 'one', 'included', 'leg', 'strap', 'velcro', 'exposed', 'inside', 'thigh', 'bit', 'scratchy', 'when', 'doing', 'running', 'walking', 'etc.finally', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'included', 'BMI', 'weight', 'measurement', 'graph', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'really', 'helped', 'motivation.I', 'am', 'definitely', 'beginner', 'phase', 'working', 'out', 'need', 'lose', '40', 'pounds', 'great', 'workout', 'lot', 'fun', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'hard', 'core', 'exercise', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'thing', 'have', 'high', 'intensity', 'level', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'looked', 'yet.Overall', 'had', 'choose', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'would', 'choose', 'one']",N/A

After one week our leg strap has shredded. No one is very large or heavy- it just gets stretched too often with all the in and out. I think they should have designed the workouts so that all the leg exercises are together, instead of alternating them with upper body, or included a slimmer tool that will fit easier into the strap and be more sensitive to movement than the standard nunchuck. The resistance band exercises are awkward sometimes. The Wii doesn't always pick up your movements, expecially if the remote and nunchuck are not positioned perfectly. It's frustrating.

I haven't done the 30 day challenge since I leave for vacation in a week but so far I've done the 20 minute workouts and 30 minute work outs on easy and they've kick my butt!  I can see the more you advance the harder it will get.Some say the leg strap doesn't stay on well and I too had some difficulty at first but I found that if I wear shorts and place the band on my leg directly, only lace it through one of the slots (it looks like you could lace it through two slots but that made it loser) and place it fairly high up but not so high that I can't bend my leg forward with the remote it the pocket.  Once you get it down it's easy peasy.Also yes, holding the controllers take some getting used to, as does any exercise equipment but once you get the hang of it it's not as hard.  You also learn how to hold the resistance bands to make it more comfortable and to fold them on the floor and stand on it to make the resistance harder.  You also have to place the controller properly into the pocket of the the leg band for it to properly register your movments, it took a few tries to get it right.I've really enjoyed incorporating this into my wii fit routine which is still fun but I never felt gave me a good overall workout.

1216574,A2S37P50AYCUYV,B001MBUGLY,"J. Minatel ""jimmin""","[4, 4]","I've been using EA Active workout for the Wii for about 2 weeks now. 7 or 8 workout sessions, long enough to get a good feel for it's strengths and weaknesses.First, yes, better than the Wii Fit Plus workouts in that there is more attention to it presenting a full coordinated 30 minute workout with EA Active. And EA active does a better job of integrating sports like basketball and volleyball without turning them into ""video games"" like Wii Fit Plus. There's more musical varierty (and the ability to choose workout music) with EA, the fitness journal is nice (although probably no better than the workout tracking and logging in Wii Fit Plus), and the 30 day challenge is a nice start. The videos of the trainers (real people) doing the exercices in EA are also better than the animated examples in Wii Fit Plus.But where EA active really falls down is in the controller/avatar responsiveness. I know there's nothing wrong with my Wii remotes. They work great and provide instant responses with Wii Sports and Wii Fit Plus. But with EA Active, there's a discernable delay in any motion I make until the motion is reflected by my character on screen. In some exercises, like most of the lifts with the exercise band and the lunges, it's no big deal. But a quarter to half second response delay in sports like volleyball or inline skaing make it close to impossible to time a volleyball bump or set (timing your motions to move 1/4 sec before the ball arrives) or to time a jump off a ramp in inline skating. While you can continue to workout with the flaws and burn calories, it really detracts from a workout to try to guess on the timing.I've also had instances where the workout simply stopped responding to the remote motion. In the middle of what had to have been my 10 set of curls in 7 workouts, the workout simply stopped responding to my right arm in the middle of a curl. The remote was still clearly alive and active as pressing buttons brough up menus as appropriate, but no amount of moving the remote up or down turned in any direction would bring my character's arm ""down"" from the up position of a curl.I can't speak to the vocal characteristics or ""coaching"" of the female trainer but the male is positively annoying, especially when the EA Active's response seems to be the real culprit.

This game is well worth the cost, especially for the preset workouts alone.  Customizing is good for those days when you don't have a lot of time and only want to work specific areas, but the presets are even better.  They can be done in under a half hour and you get a full body workout, not just one area or another instead focusing on building muscles and getting cardio in.After about a hundred lunges/squats, I was really feeling the burn and, I have to say, am not disappointed with this.The only thing that I had trouble with early on was the resistance band, but once you get going and get in the game you get used to it and find that it really is helpful.  And this is coming from a staunch supporter of the free weight.  Some of the exercises can get a bit tedious, but when you finish them, you feel like you've accomplished something.So, for all you Wii Fit folk, take a break from that and get out there and really get your butt kicked with the Active.

Draper,"[2, 2]","I'm fairly new on the Wii scene but have been using Wii Fit for about a month now... it had me sweating during the boxing and was good for toning but that was the extent of it.  However, EA Active Sports had me sweating buckets by the end of the ""easy"" 30 minute workout (to the point where the leg band slipped off)!  Unlike Wii Fit the exercises are continuous and just when you think you can't do another squat a new exercise pops up, which I really liked.  My legs were practically jello after all the side lunges/regular lunges/squats but you do feel the burn and that's more than I can say for the Wii Fit.  This was my first day and I think I picked a routine that focused on the lower body but I agree with other reveiwers that the resistance bands are weak for the upper.  The push-up/side plank on Wii Fit was more challenging than any of the upper body exercises I did today, but buying a stronger band is a quick fix.  That's my only gripe so far - doesn't do much for the upper half.The best thing in my view is that it tracks the calories you burn and allows you to set how long and what routines you want to do.  I wasn't thrilled with the jogging but loved the boxing so it can be tailor-made, where you can see the calories each exercise burns and the time frame it takes to do it!  If you set up a custom routine it shows the percentage of time you're working on each area (cardio, upper, lower) and that lets you focus on problem areas.  I thought the trainer was OK but was frustrated when I didn't do an exercise entirely right and had to correct it before moving forward (at that point I didn't know you could skip certain exercises!).All in all, this is a great companion to the Wii Fit.  On the days you're not sore from EA Active (I'm sure I will be tomorrow, just in time where I have to stand for hours at a concert!) you can balance it out with yoga and the additional exercises Wii Fit offers such as the plank (for the core/abs) and push-up plank (more abs/core).  Fit is better for ab work and since Active offers no yoga poses or balance options shuffling between the two is ideal.I'm pleased with the product and do not regret shelling out the dough for it!  I'm in pretty good shape and wasn't entirely challenged with the ""easy"" program but my legs will need a recovery period.  I recommend this for anyone who lacks motivation to go to a gym (i.e. me) and wants a varied program with a trainer that shows you how to do the moves correctly.  The fact that you can choose your own playlist was also a plus!Pros: variety, continuity in exercises, the ability to design your own programs that zero in on trouble spots, feedback to ensure that you're doing the exercises correctly, and cardio that Wii Fit doesn't have (outside of boxing).Cons: weak resistance band, getting ""stuck"" in a exercise if you haven't done it right, the leg band becoming loose (I wore it on bare skin so I think that if it was on clothing it wouldn't be a problem).",4,Good compliment to Wii Fit!,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,2974,"[""'m"", 'fairly', 'new', 'Wii', 'scene', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'about', 'month', 'now', 'had', 'sweating', 'boxing', 'was', 'good', 'toning', 'was', 'extent', 'However', 'EA', 'Active', 'Sports', 'had', 'sweating', 'buckets', 'end', 'easy', '30', 'minute', 'workout', 'point', 'where', 'leg', 'band', 'slipped', 'off', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'exercises', 'are', 'continuous', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'squat', 'new', 'exercise', 'up', 'really', 'liked', 'legs', 'were', 'practically', 'jello', 'side', 'lunges/regular', 'lunges/squats', 'do', 'feel', 'burn', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'was', 'first', 'day', 'think', 'picked', 'routine', 'focused', 'lower', 'body', 'agree', 'other', 'reveiwers', 'resistance', 'bands', 'are', 'weak', 'upper', 'push-up/side', 'plank', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'was', 'more', 'challenging', 'upper', 'body', 'did', 'today', 'buying', 'stronger', 'band', 'quick', 'fix', 'only', 'gripe', 'so', 'far', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'upper', 'half.The', 'best', 'thing', 'view', 'calories', 'burn', 'set', 'how', 'long', 'what', 'routines', 'want', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'jogging', 'loved', 'boxing', 'can', 'be', 'tailor-made', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'calories', 'exercise', 'burns', 'time', 'frame', 'do', 'set', 'up', 'custom', 'routine', 'percentage', 'time', ""'re"", 'working', 'area', 'cardio', 'upper', 'lower', 'focus', 'problem', 'areas', 'thought', 'trainer', 'was', 'OK', 'was', 'frustrated', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'exercise', 'entirely', 'right', 'had', 'correct', 'moving', 'forward', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'skip', 'certain', 'exercises', '.All', 'great', 'companion', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'days', ""'re"", 'not', 'sore', 'EA', 'Active', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'tomorrow', 'just', 'time', 'where', 'have', 'stand', 'hours', 'concert', 'can', 'balance', 'out', 'yoga', 'additional', 'exercises', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'offers', 'such', 'plank', 'core/abs', 'push-up', 'plank', 'more', 'abs/core', 'Fit', 'better', 'ab', 'work', 'Active', 'yoga', 'balance', 'options', 'shuffling', 'two', 'ideal.I', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'product', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'shelling', 'dough', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'challenged', 'easy', 'program', 'legs', 'will', 'need', 'recovery', 'period', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'motivation', 'go', 'gym', 'i.e', 'varied', 'program', 'trainer', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'correctly', 'fact', 'can', 'choose', 'own', 'playlist', 'was', 'also', 'plus', 'Pros', 'variety', 'continuity', 'exercises', 'ability', 'design', 'own', 'programs', 'zero', 'trouble', 'spots', 'feedback', 'ensure', ""'re"", 'doing', 'exercises', 'correctly', 'cardio', 'Wii', 'Fit', ""n't"", 'have', 'boxing', '.Cons', 'weak', 'resistance', 'band', 'getting', 'stuck', 'exercise', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'right', 'leg', 'band', 'becoming', 'loose', 'wore', 'bare', 'skin', 'think', 'was', 'clothing', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem']",N/A

Every time I was asked what I wanted for a birthday I would have rather forgotten, I adamantly declared, ""Wii Active!""I love it!Combining it with the Wii Fit, I'm getting a great body-trimming and complete cardio workout.My two youngest boys, however, aren't as thrilled with it and would rather stick strictly with the Wii Fit.One of the very first things we noticed is that the Wii Active is not designed for left-handed persons. My middle son is a lefty and struggled to play with his right hand.Wii Sports came with the ability to choose a person's dominate hand. The games play through Wii Fit don't function based on sides. However, Wii Active frequently specifies a hand the remote must be in, and if the remote is not in that specific hand it results in the ""trainer"" tsk, tsk'ing a playing as the system can't ""read"" a player's movements.Once my son changed hands, the system picked up on it right away. He, however, decided that just wasn't comfortable and gave up completely.My next and last complaint has to do with running/jogging.When using this portion of the Wii Active, players are instructed to insert the Nunchuck into the leg strap while holding the remote in their right hand.Yeah, tried that. I kept being told I was moving too slow, even when I ran as hard as I could.I've figured out to go against the instructions and keep the nunchuck in my left hand and the remote in my right.My youngest son, on the other hand, decided to go completely against it and go back to the running feature on Wii Fit. According to him, it's ""better to look at.""I've got to admit, the ""scenery"" on Wii Fit is better than the track found on Wii Active.Irregardless of those kinks mentioned, Wii Active is definitely an improvement in graphics and music.I'm anxious to see Nintendo's next fitness release for the Wii.

I'm not talking about all the folks who can motivate themselves to work out. I'm talking about people like me, who typically exercise for a month, and then watch tv for nine months before getting back to it. The Wii Fit programs are at least more entertaining, although I can say those programs got old over time, as this one certainly will. As far as this program, I of course, started out on 'easy', and the first day's workout was easy. The second day was harder - but it was suppose to be a mix of upper and lower body, and creamed my lower body with lunges and high-kick running, but didn't do as much as I wanted for upper body. I haven't had any trouble with the nunchuck being in the leg strap, other than the wire occasionally getting in the way while using the resistance band. It is awkward to move between exercises when you have to stop and put the nunchuck in the leg strap, or take it out, or get the resistance band in place. Since it can use the Wii balance board, it seems it should use it more (maybe it will eventually) - take advantage of the capability. My round of exercises on the first day used the board twice, and not very effectively. The second day's round didn't use it at all. I did have issues on the second day with the program recognizing when I was moving my arms up or down. AND, I ran off to the bathroom during a tutorial video, thinking the program wouldn't start until I pressed a button ... it did start without me, and my character had already done a rep by the time I got back - that's not impressive. Your motivation to keep at it are graphs and trophies. I find it amusing that the ""Half Way There"" Trophy is awarded at 10 out of 30 days (30 days being your big goal - to complete 30 days of workouts). Overall, if you are self-motivated to exercise, this program will probably make a nice addition to mix with your other workouts. I do so wish someone would make a really fun and entertaining workout program for those of us who need extra impetus. Bring on Raving Rabbids Aerobics or something.

No, it's not a human being with a human being's ability to innovate, but the cost of the game considering what it CAN actually do make it a much better value.  I did replace the resistance band after the first workout with one that was more challenging for me-- no problem, they are easy to find and change out.  I also find that the numchuck cord gets in my way on some exercises-- tangles around my leg in high kicks, or slaps me in the face on some arm exercises.  That's not the game's fault, just the design of the Wii... I wish the two (numchuck and controller) didn't have to be attached together.  I didn't have any of the other problems I have seen people complaining about in here.  I really love this game and can't wait to do multi-player with other members of my family.",4,Love it!

1216586,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B001MBUGLY,Kyle Slayzar,"[56, 73]","If you're like any of us gamers and Wii fans (and yes, there is a difference these days), who were sorely disappointed with the Wii Fit and want something that actually works than THIS review is for you.Nothing against the Japanese but as we've noticed with many of their products such as their cars, motorcycles, and the Wii Fit, neither were designed with the physiology of Westerners in mind (the Nissan Maxima and the Yamaha Roadliner being the exception).  The Wii Fit game and balance board were NOT designed with Westerners in mind as many of us are well over six feet tall and, if we're overweight, than we cannot use the Wii Fit as the maximum weight limit is 330 lbs.For instance; I am 6'5 and just over the limit.  I can remember trying it out and, in a Garfield-esque manner, the board informed me that it is not a freight scale and begged me to get off of it.  End of story, now what do I do?  Exercise outside of the Wii perhaps?  Where's the fun in that?!I later tried to workout alongside a friend of mine, who was not the size of Manny the Mammoth, and mirror the movements on the screen.  This would've worked except he got bored of the mundane and repetitive workouts and stopped playing, leaving me in the proverbial dust.Enter EA Sports Active.Electronic Arts advertised the ""Active"" as a Wii Fit alternative that will does not limit itself to simply weight loss and more of a regimen to improve your overall physical fitness.  Wii Fit places its emphasis solely on weight and balance, which is not the end all of a workout.  How the Active achieves this is through a 30-day challenge where the AI pushes you through three workout modes in increasing difficulty (low-intensity, medium-intensity, and high-intensity).  The AI will then track how well you do with some basic workouts and then determine which exercises you will do next.  For instance, I had trouble crouching during long inline skating so the AI had me practice squats again... and again.Now, to address the level of difficultty, I made the mistake of trying the high-intensity workout straight out of the box and couldn't walk after 15 minutes.  I woke up a few hours later and barely was able to stand out of bed.  So take it from me, DO NOT *I REPEAT* DO NOT OVER EXERT YOURSELF.  Start out slow.Now, to avoid over-working out, the Active gives you a time limit before it stops you from working out any further.  This is good since it's all too easy to over-exert yourself and cause personal injury.  The Active also gives you days off where it will not allow you to work out.  Of course, you could just load up another profile and start from there, but seriously, is it worth getting injured over?  I think not.  Even Jillian Michaels knows when to stop her contestants before they hurt themselves.So, now onto the unique equipment of the Active.  Normally, I would say that the Active is designed for the North American audience but the hip-strap certainly isn't.  The hip-strap is designed to house the nunchuck for certain stretches and jogging (with a silent ""j"").  I had a difficult time getting the strap around my upper leg and felt as though I was about to give blood through it.  Just grin, grit your teeth and tie that sucker on as best you can; if it can fit me, it WILL fit you.Next is the resistance strap.  It kinda readjusts to the heigth to the user but, rest assured, it will NOT break under normal use.  Be advised that THIS IS NOT A DARE TO TRY.  The resistance strap will help you do arm curls and shoulder stretches designed to work muscles and improve flaxibility.Lastly is the Wii Fit balance board.  Unlike the Wii Fit game, EA Active removes the weight limit and lets me workout with whatever I want (Suck on THAT Nintendo!!).  It doesn't seem to use the balancing measurements, but it does help with kick boxing.Now, does the Active really work?  Does it fulfill it's mission to get you in better physical fitness?  Oh, yes it does!  I can finally run the mile without too much trouble whereas I couldn't do even the half-mile before.  I feel a lot better about myself and can actually do a daily workout that doesn't involve picking out very boring regimens.Lastly, for the cost of a Wii Fit versus the Active... I think it's more than apparent.Happy workout!",5,The Wii Fit Choice For a North American Workout,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,4276,"[""'re"", 'gamers', 'Wii', 'fans', 'yes', 'difference', 'days', 'who', 'were', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'want', 'something', 'actually', 'THIS', 'review', 'you.Nothing', 'Japanese', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'many', 'products', 'such', 'cars', 'motorcycles', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'were', 'designed', 'physiology', 'Westerners', 'mind', 'Nissan', 'Maxima', 'Yamaha', 'Roadliner', 'being', 'exception', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'game', 'balance', 'board', 'were', 'NOT', 'designed', 'Westerners', 'mind', 'many', 'are', 'well', 'six', 'feet', 'tall', ""'re"", 'overweight', 'can', 'not', 'use', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'maximum', 'weight', 'limit', '330', 'lbs.For', 'instance', 'am', '6', '5', 'just', 'limit', 'can', 'remember', 'trying', 'Garfield-esque', 'manner', 'board', 'informed', 'not', 'freight', 'scale', 'begged', 'get', 'End', 'story', 'now', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'Exercise', 'Wii', 'perhaps', 'Where', 'fun', 'later', 'tried', 'workout', 'alongside', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'size', 'Manny', 'Mammoth', 'mirror', 'movements', 'screen', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'got', 'bored', 'mundane', 'repetitive', 'workouts', 'stopped', 'playing', 'leaving', 'proverbial', 'dust.Enter', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active.Electronic', 'Arts', 'advertised', 'Active', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'alternative', 'will', 'not', 'limit', 'simply', 'weight', 'loss', 'more', 'regimen', 'improve', 'overall', 'physical', 'fitness', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'emphasis', 'solely', 'weight', 'balance', 'not', 'end', 'workout', 'How', 'Active', 'achieves', '30-day', 'challenge', 'where', 'AI', 'pushes', 'three', 'workout', 'modes', 'increasing', 'difficulty', 'low-intensity', 'medium-intensity', 'high-intensity', 'AI', 'will', 'then', 'track', 'how', 'well', 'do', 'basic', 'workouts', 'then', 'determine', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'instance', 'had', 'trouble', 'crouching', 'long', 'inline', 'skating', 'AI', 'had', 'practice', 'squats', 'again', 'again.Now', 'address', 'level', 'difficultty', 'made', 'mistake', 'trying', 'high-intensity', 'workout', 'straight', 'box', 'could', ""n't"", 'walk', '15', 'minutes', 'woke', 'up', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'barely', 'was', 'able', 'stand', 'bed', 'So', 'take', 'DO', 'NOT', '*I', 'REPEAT*', 'DO', 'NOT', 'OVER', 'EXERT', 'YOURSELF', 'Start', 'slow.Now', 'avoid', 'over-working', 'Active', 'time', 'limit', 'working', 'out', 'further', 'good', 'too', 'easy', 'over-exert', 'cause', 'personal', 'injury', 'Active', 'also', 'days', 'where', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'work', 'out', 'course', 'could', 'just', 'load', 'up', 'profile', 'start', 'there', 'seriously', 'getting', 'injured', 'think', 'not', 'Even', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'when', 'stop', 'contestants', 'hurt', 'themselves.So', 'now', 'unique', 'equipment', 'Active', 'Normally', 'would', 'say', 'Active', 'designed', 'North', 'American', 'audience', 'hip-strap', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hip-strap', 'designed', 'house', 'nunchuck', 'certain', 'stretches', 'jogging', 'silent', 'j', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'strap', 'upper', 'leg', 'felt', 'was', 'about', 'give', 'blood', 'Just', 'grin', 'grit', 'teeth', 'tie', 'sucker', 'can', 'can', 'fit', 'WILL', 'fit', 'you.Next', 'resistance', 'strap', 'kinda', 'readjusts', 'heigth', 'user', 'rest', 'assured', 'will', 'NOT', 'break', 'normal', 'use', 'Be', 'advised', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'A', 'DARE', 'TO', 'TRY', 'resistance', 'strap', 'will', 'help', 'do', 'arm', 'curls', 'shoulder', 'stretches', 'designed', 'work', 'muscles', 'improve', 'flaxibility.Lastly', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'balance', 'board', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'game', 'EA', 'Active', 'weight', 'limit', 'want', 'Suck', 'THAT', 'Nintendo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'use', 'balancing', 'measurements', 'help', 'kick', 'boxing.Now', 'Active', 'really', 'work', 'fulfill', 'mission', 'get', 'better', 'physical', 'fitness', 'Oh', 'yes', 'can', 'finally', 'run', 'mile', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'whereas', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'even', 'half-mile', 'feel', 'lot', 'better', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'daily', 'workout', ""n't"", 'involve', 'picking', 'out', 'very', 'boring', 'regimens.Lastly', 'cost', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'Active', 'think', 'more', 'apparent.Happy', 'workout']",N/A
1216587,AZL0P9J95ON7D,B001MBUGLY,"Lisa Kennelley ""matzo419""","[2, 2]","First before I write this, let me say that I love wii active and I use it almost everyday and have recommended it to friends and family.  Unfortunately, there are some things that EA needs to work on to make this better.1.  I got this for christmas and where the velcro is on the leg strap, it is already coming apart.  I have ordered another, and have placed duct tape over this section on my old leg strap.  I am not a large person, and there is plenty of velcro left for me to wrap it around.  Also, to keep the leg strap on my leg while doing the jogging, I need to make the leg strap very tight, otherwise it just slides down my leg as I am running.2.  The resistence band is very flimsy.  It gives little resistence for me.  I don't feel like my muscles are working very hard when I am using it.  I am planning on getting another to make my workout really count.3.  This one really bugs me!  I am left-handed and this is definitely for right-handed people.  The tennis and boxing drills are hard for me because I want to use my left hand and I never hit the target on tennis, unless I stand still and really try to control my right hand. Also, the wii remote is always held in your right hand, and when I first started using it, I kept on getting held up because I instictively held the controller in my left hand.  Rock Band, Guitar Hero, Band Hero have options to set what hand you use, why can't wii active do the same.With that being said, I look foward to using this game, get quite the workout in my legs when I set it on hard.  I love the journal feature and it makes me aware of some of the habits I need to change... (like for instance, I forget to eat while I am at work, very stressed) and it asks me about my food intake, stress level, and how much sleep am I getting.  All in all, this is a great game, a lot better than wii fit in my opinion, I just wish that EA would work on the above issues, and it would get 5 stars from me!",3,Great but needs some fine tuning...,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,1948,"['First', 'write', 'let', 'say', 'love', 'wii', 'active', 'use', 'almost', 'everyday', 'have', 'recommended', 'friends', 'family', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'things', 'EA', 'work', 'make', 'better.1', 'got', 'christmas', 'where', 'velcro', 'leg', 'strap', 'already', 'coming', 'apart', 'have', 'ordered', 'have', 'placed', 'duct', 'tape', 'section', 'old', 'leg', 'strap', 'am', 'not', 'large', 'person', 'plenty', 'velcro', 'left', 'wrap', 'around', 'Also', 'keep', 'leg', 'strap', 'leg', 'doing', 'jogging', 'need', 'make', 'leg', 'strap', 'very', 'tight', 'otherwise', 'just', 'down', 'leg', 'am', 'running.2', 'resistence', 'band', 'very', 'flimsy', 'little', 'resistence', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'muscles', 'are', 'working', 'very', 'hard', 'when', 'am', 'using', 'am', 'planning', 'getting', 'make', 'workout', 'really', 'count.3', 'one', 'really', 'bugs', 'am', 'left-handed', 'definitely', 'right-handed', 'people', 'tennis', 'boxing', 'drills', 'are', 'hard', 'want', 'use', 'left', 'hand', 'never', 'hit', 'target', 'tennis', 'stand', 'still', 'really', 'try', 'control', 'right', 'hand', 'Also', 'wii', 'remote', 'always', 'held', 'right', 'hand', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'using', 'kept', 'getting', 'held', 'up', 'instictively', 'held', 'controller', 'left', 'hand', 'Rock', 'Band', 'Guitar', 'Hero', 'Band', 'Hero', 'have', 'options', 'set', 'what', 'hand', 'use', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wii', 'active', 'do', 'same.With', 'being', 'said', 'look', 'foward', 'using', 'game', 'get', 'quite', 'workout', 'legs', 'when', 'set', 'hard', 'love', 'journal', 'feature', 'aware', 'habits', 'need', 'change', 'instance', 'forget', 'eat', 'am', 'work', 'very', 'stressed', 'food', 'intake', 'stress', 'level', 'how', 'much', 'sleep', 'am', 'getting', 'great', 'game', 'lot', 'better', 'wii', 'fit', 'opinion', 'just', 'wish', 'EA', 'would', 'work', 'above', 'issues', 'would', 'get', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1216588,A3NID9D9WMIV01,B001MBUGLY,"Louie the Italian Jew ""Lou da Joo""","[2, 2]","EA Sports Active gives you a great workout (really great)! I purchased EA Sports Active after thoroughly enjoying Gold's Gym Cardio Workout (which I still enjoy). When I first received EA Sports Active, the leg band kept falling off. After I changed into cotton shorts, I didn't have that problem anymore. I was brave and tried one of the pre-made workouts (30 day Challenges) and had a difficult time having the Wiimotes register my movements. For instance, when I was doing bicep curls, I noticed that I had to pull my wrists in towards me, which I don't usually do when I'm curling dumbbells. It's hard to explain, but it's an unnatural movement. I finally got all of the exercise movements down(point Wiimote up, down, in, etc.), but when I combine 2 motions in 1 exercise, I have problems with the Wiimote registering. In other words, I only do shoulder presses, and for the next set I do curls, but don't combine the 2.Secondly, the resistance band is weak. I went out and purchased a medium tension resistance band (green Dynaband, 10 bucks from Amazon), and now I'm a lot happier.Finally, I'd like to mention that I was surprised how much I enjoy the sports exercises. Baseball is my favorite. Pitching, catching, and batting are awesome! The controls work 10 times better than Wii Sports baseball. Towards the end of the workout,I add baseball to reward myself for a job well done.Overall, now I'm very satisfied with the product, but will only give it 4 stars, because I am stuck with the custom workouts, and I had to spend another 10 dollars for a resistance band.",4,"an awesome workout, but.....",1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,1576,"['EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'great', 'workout', 'really', 'great', 'purchased', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'Gold', 'Gym', 'Cardio', 'Workout', 'still', 'enjoy', 'When', 'first', 'received', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'leg', 'band', 'kept', 'falling', 'off', 'changed', 'cotton', 'shorts', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'anymore', 'was', 'brave', 'tried', 'one', 'pre-made', 'workouts', '30', 'day', 'Challenges', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'having', 'Wiimotes', 'register', 'movements', 'instance', 'when', 'was', 'doing', 'bicep', 'curls', 'noticed', 'had', 'pull', 'wrists', 'towards', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', 'when', ""'m"", 'curling', 'dumbbells', 'hard', 'explain', 'unnatural', 'movement', 'finally', 'got', 'exercise', 'movements', 'down', 'point', 'Wiimote', 'down', 'etc', 'when', 'combine', '2', 'motions', '1', 'exercise', 'have', 'problems', 'Wiimote', 'registering', 'other', 'words', 'only', 'do', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'next', 'set', 'do', 'curls', 'do', ""n't"", 'combine', '2.Secondly', 'resistance', 'band', 'weak', 'went', 'out', 'purchased', 'medium', 'tension', 'resistance', 'band', 'green', 'Dynaband', '10', 'bucks', 'Amazon', 'now', ""'m"", 'lot', 'happier.Finally', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'sports', 'exercises', 'Baseball', 'favorite', 'Pitching', 'catching', 'batting', 'are', 'awesome', 'controls', 'work', '10', 'times', 'better', 'Wii', 'Sports', 'baseball', 'end', 'workout', 'add', 'baseball', 'reward', 'job', 'well', 'done.Overall', 'now', ""'m"", 'very', 'satisfied', 'product', 'will', 'only', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'am', 'stuck', 'custom', 'workouts', 'had', 'spend', '10', 'dollars', 'resistance', 'band']",N/A

I finally feel like between My Fitness Coach, GM Cardio Workout and this game, I have solid Wii Fitness/workout schedule.I am able to set up my person with ease along with my personal goals for calories, hours and workouts. There are a lot of exercises for a person to choose from when setting up your work out. I found myself really working out hard by the time I hit the fourth exercise.  The screen shows how many calories you're burning, how much time has elapsed, how far you've come/or need to go in your workout session. I am looking forward to experiencing all the exercises that are included. I like the fact this game is also Wii Balance Board compatible. Nintendo has not produced a considerable amount of games that are Wii Balance Board compatible or interactive as of yet.One of the things I noticed that didn't suit me was the use of the leg strap.  I wore shorts and the leg strap became slightly uncomfortable. I would definitely suggest one to wear workout pants.The Resistance Band really provides no resistance.

I was a little apprehensive when I first saw EA was putting this out because while Wii Fit is pretty fun I don't feel that it really helps you get in shape or strenghtens.  But after reading mostly positive reviews from critics and users I decided to give it a try.  Must say I was really surprised the first time I used it how sweaty and weak kneed I was.  Since I play tennis or run, sometimes both the same day, at least every other day I felt my lower body was in pretty good shape.  But after the second day my legs were so sore I had trouble getting up and down the steps to my apartment.  I see some reviewers complaining about the movements not being recognized even when you feel you're doing them correctly.  I did have some trouble the first time I used it but now on my 4th day of workouts I've pretty much got the controls and movements down.  It just takes a little getting used to and making sure you use the correct technique.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the resistance band that comes with it is really bad.  No matter how much I fold it over I still can't feel anything when doing the upper body work.  Best to go buy some decent bands at the sports store.  Also there is virtually no core excercises.

The system can provide a routine for you each day that is different from the previous day's workout.  If you don't want to do an exercise in a routine, just de-select it.2. Personal Trainer - I like the personal trainer better than the Wii Fit because the trainer follows your progress throughout the workout, the video demonstrations are videos of your training (as opposed to a computerized version), and the trainers smile and talk like real people telling you to get it in gear.3.  The Accessories - It's great that the game comes with a resistance band.  It makes a big difference!4.  Varying Difficulty - If you're not feeling up to a big workout, you can adjust the level of intensity of the exercises for the day.5.  Little Down Time Between Exercises - A drawback of the Wii Fit was that it took a long time to move between events.  The works on Active transition right into each other.A few minuses:1. Not as Responsive - Being used to the Wii Fit I anticipate that the person on the screen will move when I do, but without the balance board in many of the exercises, it just doesn't happen.  Also, it may be that the batteries are getting low in my Wii Remote, but one in every 10 reps, the system doesn't recognize that I'v moved/done the rep.  I have to give the remote a little shake and then the on screen character moves.2. Limited Choice in Characters - When using the game for the first time, you create an on-screen version of yourself.  It's unfortunate that there are so few options to choose from.  Wii Fit had this one down.3.

Alexander ""Dilettante""","[1, 1]","After receiving the Wii Fit with Balance Board as a gift for Christmas, I was disappointed by the lack of features to really customize a workout.  So when I bought EA Sports' Active, that's the feature I wanted the most.  I launched myself into the 30-day Challenge and haven't regretted it once.I will concede that the music is poorly timed for the pacing of the different exercises.  I will also concede that I would like to have the workout flow more organically once you know how to perform the exercises, without the little ""way to go"" sessions after each set.I am totally okay with not having my workout time extended with stretches because I do my own stretch routine.  I am also totally okay with not having separate abdominal exercises; you do get passive core strengthening any time you're doing back exercises or cardio that requires stability (the skating, kicks, and knees in particular).  I'm not looking for a six-pack; I want a good solid workout that isn't the same thing every day and that I don't have to put a lot of thought into planning.I get what I want and need from this program.  I follow the forms as instructed and rarely have lag or pose issues.  I adjust the resistance band to my own needs by shortening it when I want more tension.  I've used a different band for different exercises as well.The proof is in the pudding:  I'm almost done with the 30-day challenge and am looking forward to the pre-set workouts to come.

1216605,A7VHN73Y5O6EO,B001MBUGLY,"Sally Foster ""History buff""","[16, 21]","Overall, EA Sports Active feels a lot like a pre-release of a game that will become an excellent game just as soon as the people who purchase the game find all the bugs for them.  In other words, the first wave of buyers are their Beta testers.Numerous people have posted their frustrations over the problem with the intermittent failures of the game to properly track the movements of their arms and legs.  I have had the same issue, the game stalls and goes into an annoying waiting mode prompting you to complete the exercise, not because you haven't but because it is not reading your movements properly.  Normally you can get out of this mode by widely swinging whatever body part it has failed to read.  It's annoying to have to do this, and so far this is the only Wii sports game I've played that has this glitch.The resistance band have almost no resistance, and the idea of holding the Wii controls in each hand along with the resistance band is just plain bad design.  However, I suspect that they ended up like this as the lesser of two evils.  You can't do the exercises without holding the two Wii remotes in your hands, however if you used the right resistance while holding the remotes you have a safety issue.  I noticed that Everlast released a set of two pound weights that hold the Wii remotes inside of their handles which allow for the correct resistance without the safety risks.  If Everlast ends up releasing an entire range of hand weights for the Wii console, then the EA Sports Active resistance band could be replaced with those weights.  Problem solved, but then again, if EA Sports Active had thought this all through when they designed this software, it would have been a non-issue, solved before the release of the software.This is why I feel this product is more of a Beta then a full release.  The designers and managers behind this game had to have known at some point that the resistant bands were not a good design, and they should have come up with a solution before releasing this to the world.If everything worked right, and the resistance band was not an issue I would give EA Sports Active five stars.  As it stands, I only give it a three.  I have also decided that I will rent any Wii sports games before I buy.  Wii sports games seem to always get high reviews, in spite of some real problems with the quality of the software.On a side note there's a workout you do with the band for your shoulders where the trainer actually says  ""At no time should you allow the shoulder to come out of the socket.""

1216608,A1HFGK0HX39XYK,B001MBUGLY,Simon Mounsey,"[0, 0]","...there are some definite issues with this. Obviously this is meant to do the same thing as the Wii Fit did, which was give you a solid workout. This EA Sports Active does do. As most others said on here, DO NOT try this thing out on hard at first because you will feel about dead afterwards. Try to get the grasp of it before you do that.One thing I complained about the Wii Fit was the lack of strenuous activity outside of maybe a handful of exercises. Most of them to be honest were more balance-oriented and yoga-based. Active on the other hand, focuses on strength and cardio. The only thing it doesn't have, surprisingly, is any ab exercises which I find very strange. The Wii fit I thought did a great job of the jacknife so I was really surprised there was not any crunches, sit ups, etc.My other complaints are these. While the game comes with resistance bands for the strength exercises, I found them useless and didn't get much of a workout at all. If you want a real work out upper body from active, I highly suggest getting real resistance bands from Golden Gym or other brands. Once I did that, in no time, I felt some real results in my upper body.The only other complaint I have for Active is that there are a couple activities at times, where you're doing the exercise 100 percent correctly and a message appears, saying you aren't doing anything. The ones that I've had this problem tend to be the curls and on one occasion the regular lunge. Considering the release date of this, I really find it interesting that they didn't have this game compatible with the wii motion because I think if it was, it would get rid of this problem. Another problem with this, is that if you don't do it right, the game will sit at a stand still until you do it right, so eventually I got annoyed and finished without the game knowing and skipping the exercise. Personally, I think if after a certain amount of time, it should move onto the next rep.Besides those gripes though, this is a great experience. I feel a lot more toned than I did from the Wii Fit and I also work a much bigger sweat as well. So if you want something a bit more challenging than the Wii Fit I highly suggest this product. I just hope the next time EA produces something like this, they include ab exercises and tighten the sensitivity, which I'm sure they will since the Motion Plus is now available.",4,Great effort but...,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,2382,"['are', 'definite', 'issues', 'Obviously', 'meant', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'did', 'was', 'give', 'solid', 'workout', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'do', 'most', 'others', 'said', 'here', 'DO', 'NOT', 'try', 'thing', 'out', 'hard', 'first', 'will', 'feel', 'dead', 'afterwards', 'Try', 'get', 'grasp', 'do', 'that.One', 'thing', 'complained', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'was', 'lack', 'strenuous', 'activity', 'maybe', 'handful', 'exercises', 'Most', 'be', 'honest', 'were', 'more', 'balance-oriented', 'yoga-based', 'Active', 'other', 'hand', 'focuses', 'strength', 'cardio', 'only', 'thing', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprisingly', 'ab', 'find', 'very', 'strange', 'Wii', 'fit', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'jacknife', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'crunches', 'sit', 'ups', 'etc.My', 'other', 'complaints', 'are', 'game', 'resistance', 'bands', 'strength', 'found', 'useless', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'workout', 'want', 'real', 'work', 'out', 'upper', 'body', 'active', 'highly', 'suggest', 'getting', 'real', 'resistance', 'bands', 'Golden', 'Gym', 'other', 'brands', 'Once', 'did', 'time', 'felt', 'real', 'results', 'upper', 'body.The', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'have', 'Active', 'are', 'couple', 'activities', 'times', 'where', ""'re"", 'doing', 'exercise', '100', 'percent', 'correctly', 'message', 'saying', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'anything', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'had', 'problem', 'tend', 'be', 'curls', 'one', 'occasion', 'regular', 'lunge', 'Considering', 'release', 'date', 'really', 'find', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'game', 'compatible', 'wii', 'motion', 'think', 'was', 'would', 'get', 'rid', 'problem', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'right', 'game', 'will', 'sit', 'stand', 'still', 'do', 'right', 'eventually', 'got', 'annoyed', 'finished', 'game', 'knowing', 'skipping', 'exercise', 'Personally', 'think', 'certain', 'amount', 'time', 'should', 'move', 'next', 'rep.Besides', 'gripes', 'great', 'experience', 'feel', 'lot', 'more', 'toned', 'did', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'also', 'work', 'much', 'bigger', 'sweat', 'well', 'So', 'want', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'highly', 'suggest', 'product', 'just', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'EA', 'something', 'include', 'ab', 'exercises', 'tighten', 'sensitivity', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'Motion', 'Plus', 'now', 'available']",N/A

My husband is noticing the results, too!  I like to work out, but I get bored easily.  I don't think I'll get bored with Active.I tried the 30 day challenge workout, but I prefer to create custom workouts.  For my preference, the 30 day challenge workout offered too many exercises I don't like to do.  With the custom workout option, I can work out as long as I want, doing exactly what I want, at the intensity I want.  Perfect.  I have created short and long workouts with sports drills and calisthenics, focusing on upper body, lower body, and cardio, depending on my mood.  Due to some orthopedic injuries, there are some activities I cannot do comfortably two days in a row, so the custom workouts are a work-out saver!I think the lifestyle questions and additional activities log are a very good idea.  If you use the journal (you won't get a perfect score if you don't), you can log things like how much you slept, how stressed-out you feel, how much water (or sugary soda!) you drank, etc.  Also, the game gives you credit for doing yardwork, household chores, and other activities during the non-Wii portion of your day.  The journal is pretty simplistic, but it makes you think about how rest, stress-level, water, motivation, & activity level are important to your overall fitness.Why four stars?  The cons:---The controls are a bit glitchy, making completing some exercises difficult.  It's pretty frustrating to have the nunchuk secured in the holster while using good form, and still be told that you're not doing the exercise correctly.  I've had to quit a few exercises because the Wii wasn't sensing my movements.---The thigh band for the holster is of ample length to fit almost anyone's leg, but the holster pocket seems too tight for the nunchuk.  I'm afraid that my nunchuk will eventually be damaged by placing (cramming) it into the pocket.---A few---JUST A FEW---of the sports drills are lame (basketball, you know I'm talking to you).This is the first workout software I've bought, and I'm extremely pleased with it, overall.

Running in place is okay but using my elliptical instead doesn't work3.  Arm curls are tedious with the amount of objects one needs to holdI tried using my elliptical trainer, because ""running in place"" puts more stress on my joints, and if you have fused discs the extra stress will cause harm.  Holding the nunchuck rather than keeping it holstered, it is possible to make this work - albeit inconsistently.  It's worth the effort, however...Having said that, I built up a great sweat.  The music and trainer/narrator help keep things moving at the necessary pace.Use of the balance board IS recommended, and the kick exercises make great use of it.Cardio boxing is my favorite - wish it went longer.  The angles you have to kick and punch with were well thought out.Going back to #3 above, the curls are tedious because of everything you hold - but can I ever feel the burn in my shoulders.

Many of the activities are fun to play in co-op mode, but I definitely feel ""Wii Fitness Coach"" is a much better choice for working out.  I'm happy I have both games--but if I could only have one, and since my first choice is getting a good workout--I would go with ""Fitness Coach.""",4,Fun!

1216619,A14OUJJJQZ3BG2,B001MBUGLY,YzGals,"[4, 4]","I received this 4 days ago and have used it all 4 days.  After 2 days it wanted to give a day of rest but I wanted to do it anyway...BECAUSE I could tell it was working other muscles that I have been neglecting in my other daily workouts (videos/elliptical/treadmill/resistance tubes/wii fit/golds gym etc.I do find the nunchuck cord a pain.  I did have a wireless set up but the one I have it too large to fit into the pocket and it would take too long to switch them out each time.  The band is weak indeed.  I overlap it as much as I possibly can to get the most resistance.I started the with the hardest workout you can in the 30 day challenge and I think it's decent.  If I was just starting to workout though I'd try the lower ones.The kick backs SUCK (because I'm in my 40's and the knees are not what they used to be)  I do kick backs on my other dvd's but they don't make you raise the leg the way this program does.  This is hard on the knees in order to get a Perfect rating.  If I do my regular way it says TOO SLOW :(  but hey, I get it done and make up for in on other things.Boxing is fun, can't seem to nail that left cross every time though.I am not a fan of squats or jumps but I'm becoming one.  Certain parts of my thighs actually hurt a bit when you touch them.  To me that is a good sign this game is already working out parts of my body that need it.Lunges are lunges....yech.  But again, my legs already feel stronger than they did 4 days ago.I like the baseball catching/pitching/batting etc.  Basketball is fun, grabbing the ball and shoving it to a target while using the balance board.Tennis is good.I rate this best fitness Wii game to hit the market yet.  Spend the money it's worth it.  I've used the female coach and will probably now change to the male just for a different sounding voice.I also agree that I don't like that it doesn't show your weight loss.  It does show the calories burned though which is nice.  So far I've exceeded what they say you'll burn each time so that's even a nice ending to burn more than you thought you were if you give a little bit extra :)You get rewarded each time you pass a goal also.  Miles, squats, calories...etc.  So it makes a TADA noise while you're working out and shows the award also.  Just a little boost.BUY THIS FITNESS GAME!  You won't regret it.",5,Good overall workout!!!,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,2330,"['received', '4', 'days', 'ago', 'have', 'used', '4', 'days', '2', 'days', 'wanted', 'give', 'day', 'rest', 'wanted', 'do', 'anyway', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'working', 'other', 'muscles', 'have', 'been', 'neglecting', 'other', 'daily', 'workouts', 'videos/elliptical/treadmill/resistance', 'tubes/wii', 'fit/golds', 'gym', 'etc.I', 'do', 'find', 'nunchuck', 'cord', 'pain', 'did', 'have', 'wireless', 'set', 'up', 'one', 'have', 'too', 'large', 'fit', 'pocket', 'would', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'switch', 'out', 'time', 'band', 'weak', 'indeed', 'overlap', 'as', 'much', 'possibly', 'can', 'get', 'most', 'resistance.I', 'started', 'hardest', 'can', '30', 'day', 'challenge', 'think', 'decent', 'was', 'just', 'starting', ""'d"", 'try', 'lower', 'ones.The', 'kick', 'backs', 'SUCK', ""'m"", '40', 'knees', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'do', 'kick', 'backs', 'other', 'dvd', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'raise', 'leg', 'way', 'program', 'hard', 'knees', 'order', 'get', 'Perfect', 'rating', 'do', 'regular', 'way', 'TOO', 'SLOW', 'hey', 'get', 'done', 'make', 'up', 'other', 'things.Boxing', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'nail', 'left', 'cross', 'time', 'though.I', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'squats', 'jumps', ""'m"", 'becoming', 'one', 'Certain', 'parts', 'thighs', 'actually', 'hurt', 'bit', 'when', 'touch', 'good', 'sign', 'game', 'already', 'working', 'out', 'parts', 'body', 'need', 'it.Lunges', 'are', 'lunges', '.yech', 'again', 'legs', 'already', 'feel', 'stronger', 'did', '4', 'days', 'ago.I', 'baseball', 'catching/pitching/batting', 'etc', 'Basketball', 'fun', 'grabbing', 'ball', 'shoving', 'target', 'using', 'balance', 'board.Tennis', 'good.I', 'rate', 'best', 'fitness', 'Wii', 'game', 'hit', 'market', 'yet', 'Spend', 'money', ""'ve"", 'used', 'female', 'coach', 'will', 'probably', 'now', 'change', 'male', 'just', 'different', 'sounding', 'voice.I', 'also', 'agree', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""n't"", 'show', 'weight', 'loss', 'show', 'calories', 'burned', 'nice', 'far', ""'ve"", 'exceeded', 'what', 'say', ""'ll"", 'burn', 'time', 'even', 'nice', 'ending', 'burn', 'more', 'thought', 'were', 'give', 'little', 'bit', 'extra', 'get', 'rewarded', 'time', 'pass', 'goal', 'also', 'Miles', 'squats', 'calories', 'etc', 'TADA', 'noise', ""'re"", 'working', 'out', 'award', 'also', 'Just', 'little', 'boost.BUY', 'THIS', 'FITNESS', 'GAME', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A
