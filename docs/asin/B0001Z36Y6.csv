817220,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B0001Z36Y6,AKN,"[4, 4]","Clearly, after viewing this, we see that Aileen Wuornos was insane.  Her eyes almost pop out of her head as she spouts her belief that the cops knew from the beginning of her killing rampage, that she was doing the killings, that they were watching her every move from helicopters, from which they secretly dropped down on ropes and spied on her.  She tells, in her final interview, that she wants everyone to know the cops allowed her to go on killing so they would make more money off her story.She tells of ""stuff"" being put on her food in prison so that she has to wash every bite she eats.  She tells of the one time she didn't wash her food when she became sick for three weeks.And who wouldn't be insane after the life she lived?  Selling her body as a nine year old child, living for two years in the woods, through the Michigan winters in junked cars at the age of thirteen, was the start of a long horrible road toward the final crackup.The bitter end of her last bit of sanity came when a john with a long record of brutal rapes and sexual assaults tortured her, pouring alcohol into her genitals, into her ears, mouth, nose and eyes.  During her trial, she details how he strangled her and tortured her and how she managed to save her own life by shooting him.She then had to go on selling her body to strange men in cars to survive, and to support her lover.  And yet I believe she had post traumatic stress syndrome after the torture and found it safer to simply shoot the men who picked her up for sex and rob them.  Reason was gone.  It was all about survival, getting money and not being tortured again.  There was deep rage.  There was fear and hatred.She showed the lack of any compassion to her victims that she had been shown her entire life.The pretty neighborhood in Michigan where Aileen spent her childhood had a lot of dysfunctional families and drug abuse.  There was the question of Aileen's grandfather being her actual father.Her mother abandoned her when she was six months old.  We see her interviewed and she says only that after Aileen is executed she will sleep better.The state of Florida was so eager to execute Aileen that they hired three psychiatrists to examine her for fifteen minutes each and pronounce her sane, so Jeb Bush could sign the papers to kill her.As the movie states, one wonders exactly what one would have to do to be found insane, if Aileen could be found sane.  She was delusional, paranoid and psychotic.I kept hoping that there would be at long last a shred of compassion coming from someone somewhere who didn't want to take advantage of her, but it never happened.  A man in her pastwho was having regular sex with her describes how he would walk in front of her and pretend he didn't know her in public.  She had wanted to be his girlfriend but he described in foul language how he didn't want anyone to know he was associated with her.I found this documentary to be extremely well done.  It was riveting to watch Aileen speak.  It is a picture of insanity that tells the story of how an insane woman was executed in Florida, for crimes which I believe she should have been found innocent by reason of insanity.  I don't think, given her mental state, that she could have had done anything differently.This is a real life tale of a tragic life and it is well told.  The viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions armed with the actual sight of Aileen, telling her thoughts.",5,Was Aileen sane when she killed?,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,3444,"['Clearly', 'viewing', 'see', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'insane', 'eyes', 'almost', 'pop', 'head', 'belief', 'cops', 'knew', 'beginning', 'killing', 'rampage', 'was', 'doing', 'killings', 'were', 'watching', 'move', 'helicopters', 'secretly', 'dropped', 'down', 'ropes', 'spied', 'final', 'interview', 'everyone', 'know', 'cops', 'allowed', 'go', 'killing', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'story.She', 'tells', 'stuff', 'being', 'put', 'food', 'prison', 'wash', 'bite', 'one', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'wash', 'food', 'when', 'became', 'sick', 'three', 'weeks.And', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'insane', 'life', 'lived', 'Selling', 'body', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'living', 'two', 'years', 'woods', 'Michigan', 'winters', 'junked', 'cars', 'age', 'thirteen', 'was', 'start', 'long', 'horrible', 'road', 'final', 'crackup.The', 'bitter', 'end', 'last', 'bit', 'sanity', 'came', 'when', 'john', 'long', 'record', 'brutal', 'rapes', 'sexual', 'assaults', 'tortured', 'pouring', 'alcohol', 'genitals', 'ears', 'mouth', 'nose', 'eyes', 'trial', 'details', 'how', 'strangled', 'tortured', 'how', 'managed', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'shooting', 'him.She', 'then', 'had', 'go', 'selling', 'body', 'strange', 'men', 'cars', 'survive', 'support', 'lover', 'yet', 'believe', 'had', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'torture', 'found', 'safer', 'simply', 'shoot', 'men', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'sex', 'rob', 'Reason', 'was', 'gone', 'was', 'survival', 'getting', 'money', 'not', 'being', 'tortured', 'again', 'was', 'deep', 'rage', 'was', 'fear', 'hatred.She', 'showed', 'lack', 'compassion', 'victims', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'entire', 'life.The', 'pretty', 'neighborhood', 'Michigan', 'where', 'Aileen', 'spent', 'childhood', 'had', 'lot', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'drug', 'abuse', 'was', 'question', 'Aileen', 'grandfather', 'being', 'actual', 'father.Her', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'six', 'months', 'old', 'see', 'interviewed', 'only', 'Aileen', 'executed', 'will', 'sleep', 'better.The', 'state', 'Florida', 'was', 'so', 'eager', 'execute', 'Aileen', 'hired', 'three', 'psychiatrists', 'examine', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'pronounce', 'sane', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'could', 'sign', 'papers', 'kill', 'movie', 'states', 'one', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'be', 'found', 'insane', 'Aileen', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'sane', 'was', 'delusional', 'paranoid', 'psychotic.I', 'kept', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'long', 'last', 'shred', 'compassion', 'coming', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'advantage', 'never', 'happened', 'man', 'pastwho', 'was', 'having', 'regular', 'sex', 'describes', 'how', 'would', 'walk', 'front', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'public', 'had', 'wanted', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'described', 'foul', 'language', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'know', 'was', 'associated', 'her.I', 'found', 'documentary', 'be', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'riveting', 'watch', 'Aileen', 'speak', 'picture', 'insanity', 'story', 'how', 'insane', 'woman', 'was', 'executed', 'Florida', 'crimes', 'believe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'innocent', 'reason', 'insanity', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'given', 'mental', 'state', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'done', 'anything', 'differently.This', 'real', 'life', 'tale', 'tragic', 'life', 'well', 'told', 'viewer', 'left', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'armed', 'actual', 'sight', 'Aileen', 'telling', 'thoughts']",N/A

Broomfield is obviously against the death penalty. In many of the southern states they put crazy people to death like Aileen Wuornos. It is sad. But you can't put yourself above it all. We are all capable of good and bad; and often many of us have murderous thoughts. Hopefully a sense of morality and deep humanity keeps us from committing murder. It's an uncomfortable movie ultimately because most of us feel sympathy for Lee Wuornos. We can see, even though she is clearly insane, that she says level-headed things. She definitely belonged in jail or a mental insitution for life, but she didn't deserve to die. This movie is much better than Monster.

817225,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0001Z36Y6,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","This is a very raw, gritty film, both emotionally and cinemagraphically. There are interviews, but they do not include any psychiatrists or neurobiologists, as I might have expected (see my immediately previous review on the brain). Aileen herself, interviewed several times telling several different stories. Her family, the cops, the attorneys. But mostly it is Aileen and the filmmaker.Aileen was a hitchhiking hooker. She killed a total of seven men before she was captured, and late in the movie, she asserts that the main reason was that the cops ""let her do it."" She argues that there was plenty of evidence at the scene of the first murder, but the cops chose to ignore it so that she would keep killing until they had a sensational serial killer who would make them a lot of money on book and movie deals.Sadly, there seems to be a good bit of basis for that argument.This movie also serves as a compelling argument against the death penalty. There was no question of her guilt, but that's only one problem with the death penalty. Aileen convincingly illustrates another: we kill crazy people who were entirely unable to appreciate the gravity of their crimes. Late in the appeal to Governor Jeb Bush for clemency, Aileen was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation to decide whether she was sane enough to be executed. There's something very strange in the concept, but I suppose they mean whether she was sufficiently sane to justify imposing the death penalty. Two state-appointed psychiatrists spend a grand total of 15 minutes with her before concluding that she was legally sane.Of course, I would argue that a serial killer is, pretty much by definition, insane. Sane people just don't kill someone in order to rob them and leave no witnesses, which was her primary motive. Not seven times. But there was a lot more. She had a lot of crazy delusions, and it was also pretty clear that her grandfather was also her father, which would mean not only a severely dysfunctional family, but very likely genetic problems caused by the doubling up of his genes. He was not a very nice guy.I am opposed to the death penalty, even though I am not fanatical about it. I will acknowledge I see this movie through that lens. So it is pretty disturbing to see the extent to which Aileen welcomed her execution. She had ""got religion"" to some extent, and was convinced that she was going to God. Apparently she had no trouble believing that she was forgiven.I would recommend this movie only to those with a significant interest in criminal law or in the death penalty specifically. It's of little value to anyone else.",2,"Depressing, but Important",1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2622,"['very', 'raw', 'gritty', 'film', 'emotionally', 'cinemagraphically', 'are', 'interviews', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'psychiatrists', 'neurobiologists', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'see', 'immediately', 'previous', 'review', 'brain', 'Aileen', 'interviewed', 'several', 'times', 'telling', 'several', 'different', 'stories', 'family', 'cops', 'attorneys', 'mostly', 'Aileen', 'filmmaker.Aileen', 'was', 'hitchhiking', 'hooker', 'killed', 'total', 'seven', 'men', 'was', 'captured', 'late', 'movie', 'main', 'reason', 'was', 'cops', 'let', 'do', 'was', 'plenty', 'evidence', 'scene', 'first', 'murder', 'cops', 'chose', 'ignore', 'so', 'would', 'keep', 'killing', 'had', 'sensational', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'book', 'movie', 'deals.Sadly', 'be', 'good', 'bit', 'basis', 'argument.This', 'movie', 'also', 'compelling', 'argument', 'death', 'penalty', 'was', 'question', 'guilt', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'death', 'penalty', 'Aileen', 'convincingly', 'kill', 'crazy', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'entirely', 'unable', 'appreciate', 'gravity', 'crimes', 'Late', 'appeal', 'Governor', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'clemency', 'Aileen', 'was', 'ordered', 'undergo', 'psychiatric', 'evaluation', 'decide', 'was', 'sane', 'enough', 'be', 'executed', 'something', 'very', 'strange', 'concept', 'suppose', 'mean', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'sane', 'justify', 'imposing', 'death', 'penalty', 'Two', 'state-appointed', 'psychiatrists', 'spend', 'grand', 'total', '15', 'minutes', 'concluding', 'was', 'legally', 'sane.Of', 'course', 'would', 'argue', 'serial', 'killer', 'pretty', 'much', 'definition', 'insane', 'Sane', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'someone', 'order', 'rob', 'leave', 'witnesses', 'was', 'primary', 'motive', 'Not', 'seven', 'times', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'had', 'lot', 'crazy', 'delusions', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'clear', 'grandfather', 'was', 'also', 'father', 'would', 'mean', 'not', 'only', 'severely', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'very', 'likely', 'genetic', 'problems', 'caused', 'doubling', 'up', 'genes', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'guy.I', 'am', 'opposed', 'death', 'penalty', 'even', 'am', 'not', 'fanatical', 'will', 'acknowledge', 'see', 'movie', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'see', 'extent', 'Aileen', 'welcomed', 'execution', 'had', 'got', 'religion', 'extent', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'going', 'God', 'Apparently', 'had', 'trouble', 'believing', 'was', 'forgiven.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'significant', 'interest', 'criminal', 'law', 'death', 'penalty', 'specifically', 'little', 'value', 'anyone', 'else']",N/A

As well, it offers more insights on Wuornos and her crimes than &quot;Monster&quot; did. It includes gripping interviews with an almost certainly insane Wuornos shortly before her death (where she proves to be a coarse, inconsistent, and strangely likable screen presence). As well, there are interviews with Wuornos' mother, her best friend, some of her former lovers, and her former lawyer. Broomfield (a sort of Michael Moore with manners) also talks about Wuornos' turbulent life in detail, with such disturbing facts as she slept in the snow in the woods, was molested as a child, and from the age of nine was a prostitute.

Bernabo,"[30, 32]","I saw Patty Jenkin's &quot;Monster&quot; but did not see British documentarian Nick Broomfield's 1992 work &quot;Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer&quot; before I watched his 2003 postscript &quot;Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer.&quot;  All of this happened after Aileen Wuornos was executed in Florida in 2002 for killing seven men who picked her up as a prostitute during the 1980s (one of who was trying to save her).  Even without seeing &quot;The Selling of Serial Killer&quot; it is clear that the 1992 documentary was about how Wournos' flaky lawyer, the born again Christian who &quot;adopted&quot; her, and the cops who worked her case were all trying to make money off of the &quot;America's first female serial killer&quot; (the title taken from the &quot;Guiness Book of World Records&quot; is hyperbole, but what else is new).  At the start of &quot;Aileen&quot; we learn that a whole bunch of cops resigned, which would seem to vindicate Bloomfield's position.The original documentary matters when you watch &quot;Aileen&quot; because in many ways this one is about Broomfield having to deal with Aileen's confessions to the murders as he stubbornly holds on to the idea that at least the first killing really was in self-defense.  That is what he wants to talk about at the end while, in a profoundly ironic twist, Wuornos wants to expand on the thesis of his first documentary and talk about how the cops knew she was killing man after the first one but let her keep doing it so they could get more money for selling the story rights.  The question is whether Aileen is saying whatever she can to hasten her execution or if she has indeed told the truth, but Bloomfield refuses to believe it.Bloomfield (and his cinematographer and co-director Joan Churchill) go back to the beginning of Wuornos' story, taking us to the house and woods in which she lived in Michigan before hitch hiking to Florida and what she through would be a happier life.  There is no doubt about her guilt, or her insanity for that matter, but it is also clear that her life was pretty much a complete tragedy before she started killing men.  All of her victims were essentially random choices and you know that in their grief their families wanted to know &quot;Why?&quot;  &quot;Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer&quot; just shows that trying to answer that question, even in part and only inadequately, is not going to provide much peace.Broomfield is clearly against the death penalty although making a case against the practice is only a tangent in the documentary that emerges mainly when he films the final interview with Wuornos the night before her execution and she is clearly mentally ill.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that mental illness is not an impediment to the death penalty, but Wuornos' ranting and raving at the end certainly gives you pause.  Broomfield's most interesting assertion against the death penalty is that states without it have lower murder rates, which may be only correlational but still something to think about.  My thought on the death penalty has been that since it costs the state about a $1 million to execute someone in this country we could surely take half that money and hire more cops and do other things to decrease the murder rate, but then I have always had this stubborn pragmatic streak.There are no easy answers here, but everybody should have known that going into this documentary.  &quot;Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer&quot; is an indirect examination of Wournos, her murders, and the death penalty.  At the end we see the place where Wournos' ashes were scattered and the credits roll as we listen to the song she picked for her &quot;funeral,&quot; Natalie Merchant's &quot;Carnival.&quot;  Maybe there is some significant message contained in that song, but Broomfield does not stop to contemplate it as such.  Instead we get to consider it on our own as just another piece in the horror show that was Aileen Wournos' life and death.",4,Nick Broomfield's second Aileen Wuornos documentary,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,4026,"['saw', 'Patty', 'Jenkin', 'quot', 'Monster', 'quot', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'British', 'documentarian', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', '1992', 'work', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'Selling', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'quot', 'watched', '2003', 'postscript', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer.', 'quot', 'happened', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'executed', 'Florida', '2002', 'killing', 'seven', 'men', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'prostitute', '1980s', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'save', 'Even', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Selling', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'quot', 'clear', '1992', 'documentary', 'was', 'how', 'Wournos', 'flaky', 'lawyer', 'born', 'again', 'Christian', 'who', 'quot', 'adopted', 'quot', 'cops', 'who', 'worked', 'case', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'money', 'quot', 'America', 'first', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'quot', 'title', 'taken', 'quot', 'Guiness', 'Book', 'World', 'Records', 'quot', 'hyperbole', 'what', 'else', 'new', 'start', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'quot', 'learn', 'whole', 'bunch', 'cops', 'resigned', 'would', 'seem', 'vindicate', 'Bloomfield', 'position.The', 'original', 'documentary', 'matters', 'when', 'watch', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'quot', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'Broomfield', 'having', 'deal', 'Aileen', 'confessions', 'murders', 'stubbornly', 'idea', 'least', 'first', 'killing', 'really', 'was', 'self-defense', 'what', 'talk', 'end', 'profoundly', 'ironic', 'twist', 'Wuornos', 'expand', 'thesis', 'first', 'documentary', 'talk', 'how', 'cops', 'knew', 'was', 'killing', 'man', 'first', 'one', 'let', 'keep', 'doing', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'selling', 'story', 'rights', 'question', 'Aileen', 'saying', 'can', 'hasten', 'execution', 'indeed', 'told', 'truth', 'Bloomfield', 'believe', 'it.Bloomfield', 'cinematographer', 'co-director', 'Joan', 'Churchill', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'Wuornos', 'story', 'taking', 'house', 'woods', 'lived', 'Michigan', 'hitch', 'hiking', 'Florida', 'what', 'through', 'would', 'be', 'happier', 'life', 'doubt', 'guilt', 'insanity', 'matter', 'also', 'clear', 'life', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'complete', 'tragedy', 'started', 'killing', 'men', 'victims', 'were', 'essentially', 'random', 'choices', 'know', 'grief', 'families', 'wanted', 'know', 'quot', 'Why', 'quot', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'quot', 'just', 'trying', 'answer', 'question', 'even', 'part', 'only', 'inadequately', 'not', 'going', 'provide', 'much', 'peace.Broomfield', 'clearly', 'death', 'penalty', 'making', 'case', 'practice', 'only', 'tangent', 'documentary', 'mainly', 'when', 'films', 'final', 'interview', 'Wuornos', 'night', 'execution', 'clearly', 'mentally', 'ill', 'U.S.', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'ruled', 'mental', 'illness', 'not', 'impediment', 'death', 'penalty', 'Wuornos', 'ranting', 'raving', 'end', 'certainly', 'pause', 'Broomfield', 'most', 'interesting', 'assertion', 'death', 'penalty', 'states', 'have', 'lower', 'murder', 'rates', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'correlational', 'still', 'something', 'think', 'thought', 'death', 'penalty', 'been', 'state', '1', 'million', 'execute', 'someone', 'country', 'could', 'surely', 'take', 'half', 'money', 'hire', 'more', 'cops', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'decrease', 'murder', 'rate', 'then', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'stubborn', 'pragmatic', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'here', 'everybody', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'going', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'quot', 'indirect', 'examination', 'Wournos', 'murders', 'death', 'penalty', 'end', 'see', 'place', 'where', 'Wournos', 'ashes', 'were', 'scattered', 'credits', 'roll', 'listen', 'song', 'picked', 'quot', 'funeral', 'quot', 'Natalie', 'Merchant', 'quot', 'Carnival.', 'quot', 'Maybe', 'significant', 'message', 'contained', 'song', 'Broomfield', 'not', 'stop', 'contemplate', 'such', 'Instead', 'get', 'consider', 'own', 'as', 'just', 'piece', 'horror', 'show', 'was', 'Aileen', 'Wournos', 'life', 'death']",N/A

Here we meet the real Aileen, a prostitute who worked the truck routes in Florida.  We get to meet some of the people in her life.  And we can clearly see that, especially at the end of the film, she is insane.Aileen had a horrible life.  She comes from Michigan and grew up without a mother in a brutal household.  When she was 13 she had a baby who was given up for adoption.  After that, she wasn't let back into her home and actually lived in the woods.  In Michigan this meant freezing in cold and snow.  That's why she went to Florida, where it is warm.She was a lesbian and had a few years of happiness with her lover, but her lover testified against her at the trial after tricking her to reveal her guilt in a series of taped phone calls.  This all should have made me feel sorry for her, but I couldn't.In the trial she testified that each of the men she murdered abused her in some way.  She gave very graphic testimony about this but the jury didn't believe her.  Later, after she was on death row awhile she said she made it all up and that she murdered them because she wanted her money.  And then she whispered to the filmmaker when she thought she was off camera that she was, in fact, abused.She's angry a lot.  And she also smiles sweetly at times, especially when she greets the filmmaker.  And then she goes into her story about how it was the cops who let her murder because they wanted to sell her story to the movies.  She is probably paranoid about this.  But of course, there is a movie out now that seems to indicate that Hollywood knew that this would make a good story.I felt the documentary was well done by the British filmmaker, Nick Bloomfield.  I got the feeling he, too, had mixed feelings about Aileen and was trying to tell her story as well as bring out the truth.  This documentary goes right up to the execution.  And even though we don't see that actual event, we learn what she wanted for dinner and what she wanted to wear.

It's obvious from the sound and visuals that Bloomfield made some money from his first documentary.  Ms. Wuornos trust is obvious and she gives Mr. Bloomfield plenty of smiling and energetic interviews.  This second installment is less about the tragic life of Aileen Wuornos and more about her life after incarceration.  Her initial hippie stoner lawyer is confirmed as the cad he always was and most of the 'sorry' information from the first documentary is only hinted at.  Instead we see the last few days of this 'female serial killer' as she tries to bravely bring herself to terms with what she has done - along with blaming other persons (arguably) responsible for why she ended up where she is.  No one is exempt from blame and no person is without guilt or suspicion.  Even her biological mother is interviewed and the dialogue is unnerving.  What is ironic is the point that Wuornos and Bloomfield make, in that, so many officials were scheming to make money off of the movie rights.  Bloomfield ends up the winner in the blood-money pool with the only (two) documentaries on the life and death of Aileen Wuornos.

Interestingly, certain comments Broomfield makes early in the narration suggest he was shooting the sequel before a date was actually set for Wuornos to be put to death; one wonders what the original focus of Aileen II: The Wrath of Khan was going to be.Broomfield calls Wuornos ""the most honest person involved with the case,"" and proceeds to show us exactly that over the next ninety minutes. That Wuornos lies and self-serves her way through the documentary does nothing to diminish the validity of Broomfield's statement; the others involved (including, one assumes, Broomfield himself, as he never excepts himself from the statement) are all in it for some sort of personal gain. Three members of the police department investigated for, and charged with, selling the Aileen Wuornos story to Hollywood (with the alleged help of Wuornos' ex-lover; Broomfield comments on the connection, but never offers evidence), a lawyer so inexperienced he had her plead guilty to all charges and ""hope for a miracle,"" a new lawyer who took the case pro bono looking to make a name for himself, and a prosecutor with the same motive trying to execute her, etc. And Wuornos thought she was swimming with sharks before!The movie is strong all-around, with both the Wuornos interviews and the surrounding bits watchable. (Footage of Broomfield testifying at Wuornos' sentencing hearing about an edit made in the first film is especially amusing. Your legal system at work, folks!) Aileen Wuornos is very clearly off her rocker in the last days of her life, but still holds onto more cunning than most people have in their lives; by the time you've finished watching the film, you're convinced even Wurnos no longer remembered whether the murders were self-defense or not by the time she was put to death. Broomfield strongly implies he believes the self-defense story, but to his credit shows Wuornos' interviews objectively, letting her tell both sides of the story.The problems with the film come from some lapses of filmmaker and editorial judgment. Broomfield explicitly states he buys into the ludicrous idea that death row inmates who want to be put to death and/or waive their appeals are mentally ill by default and therefore shouldn't be put to death, a snippet that really should have been edited out of the film. But the editor was too busy making other bits look slightly choppy. It doesn't look amateur, really, but it's about half a step below cinema-quality pro work.Otherwise, though, a good documentary.

817242,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001Z36Y6,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 12]","***1/2 The documentary ""Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer"" provides an interesting companion piece to ""Monster,"" the film that earned Charlize Theron the Academy Award for Best Actress of 2003.  This is actually the second documentary British filmmaker Nick Broomfield has made about Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who was executed in Florida in 2002 for the murders of seven of her johns during the late 1980's.  His first film on the subject was made in 1992 during Aileen's initial trial.  Now, ten years later, he is back recording Aileen's final days, trying to get her to reveal the unvarnished truth about what really happened all those years ago.Broomfield does not pretend to be totally fair and unbiased in his presentation of the case.  He is clearly sympathetic to Aileen and is not shy about voicing his own opposition to the death penalty.  Nevertheless, the film he has made offers a meaningful glimpse into the mind of a killer, as well as the role that the legal system and the media play in sensational murder cases.  Broomfield spends much of his time visiting Aileen's childhood home, interviewing people close to her, chronicling the events of the trial, and documenting Aileen's time in prison.  But the most compelling scenes are those in which he interviews Aileen herself, prodding her to open up and reveal whether she committed the murders out of self-defense as she claims or whether she killed her victims to steal their money as the prosecution successfully argued.  The main bone of contention between filmmaker and subject centers around the first killing.  Through footage taken at her trial, Broomfield shows how, on the witness stand, Aileen wove a compelling and convincing tale of how that first murder came about.  According to Aileen, her first victim was attacking and raping her, causing her to reach into her purse, grab her pistol and shoot him dead.  Indeed, this is the way in which ""Monster"" portrays the scene as occurring.  Yet, in 2002, Broomfield captures a much different account, as Aileen confesses point blank to the camera that the story was a bald-faced lie she came up with to engender sympathy for herself with the jury (it clearly didn't work).  Later in the film, however, Aileen reverses the story again and implies that the first killing was indeed an act of self-defense.""Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer"" is a depressing and disturbing film on a number of levels.  First, it places us face-to-face with the incomprehensible mindset of a cold-blooded murderer.  Aileen comes across at times as warm and rational, honest about her guilt and repentant for the pain she's caused.  At other times, she explodes in anger at friend and foe alike, cusses a blue streak, calls vile curses down on those she feels have wronged her, and blames everyone but herself for the fate that has befallen her.  Second, the film makes us question whether one can ever really know if a person is telling the truth, even under oath.  Third, it makes us wonder just how many people there are out there whose messed-up lives and upbringings can lead to this type of dangerous antisocial behavior. Fourth, Aileen's clear and intense paranoia even up to the day of her execution - she was convinced that the police knew all about her killings long before they brought her in and let her go on killing so that they could get rich off her story - clearly raises questions as to just how ""sane"" she really was when the state of Florida sent her to her death.  Though, by the end, Broomfield is generally convinced that Aileen was a pathological liar and most likely guilty of first degree murder, he does not let all the other parties in the case off the hook that easily.  He is quick to point out the shoddy defense she received in her original trial, as well as the way in which many of her closest friends and even some Florida law enforcement officials made money off her by selling her story to various media outlets.  This film offers a stinging indictment of all the parties involved in this case.One could wish for a little less personal involvement on the part of the filmmaker.  Too often we feel that he has sacrificed his objectivity, that he isn't providing us with all the angles on the story we need to render a fair and reasonable judgment.  For instance, he spends virtually no time interviewing the loved ones of the men Aileen slaughtered.  Still, if you've seen ""Monster,"" ""Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer"" will provide further insight into that film's dark subject.  It will also show you just how extraordinary a job Theron did in capturing the real woman at the story's core.",3,chilling documentary,1091232000,"07 31, 2004",2004,4658,"['documentary', 'Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'interesting', 'companion', 'piece', 'Monster', 'film', 'earned', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', '2003', 'actually', 'second', 'documentary', 'British', 'filmmaker', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'made', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'prostitute', 'who', 'was', 'executed', 'Florida', '2002', 'murders', 'seven', 'johns', 'late', '1980', 'first', 'film', 'subject', 'was', 'made', '1992', 'Aileen', 'initial', 'trial', 'Now', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'back', 'recording', 'Aileen', 'final', 'days', 'trying', 'get', 'reveal', 'unvarnished', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'years', 'ago.Broomfield', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'totally', 'fair', 'unbiased', 'presentation', 'case', 'clearly', 'sympathetic', 'Aileen', 'not', 'shy', 'voicing', 'own', 'opposition', 'death', 'penalty', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'made', 'offers', 'meaningful', 'glimpse', 'mind', 'killer', 'as', 'well', 'role', 'legal', 'system', 'media', 'play', 'sensational', 'murder', 'cases', 'Broomfield', 'much', 'time', 'visiting', 'Aileen', 'childhood', 'home', 'interviewing', 'people', 'close', 'chronicling', 'events', 'trial', 'documenting', 'Aileen', 'time', 'prison', 'most', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'are', 'Aileen', 'prodding', 'open', 'up', 'reveal', 'committed', 'murders', 'self-defense', 'killed', 'victims', 'steal', 'money', 'prosecution', 'successfully', 'argued', 'main', 'bone', 'contention', 'filmmaker', 'subject', 'centers', 'first', 'killing', 'footage', 'taken', 'trial', 'Broomfield', 'how', 'witness', 'stand', 'Aileen', 'wove', 'compelling', 'convincing', 'tale', 'how', 'first', 'murder', 'came', 'about', 'According', 'Aileen', 'first', 'victim', 'was', 'attacking', 'raping', 'causing', 'reach', 'purse', 'grab', 'pistol', 'shoot', 'dead', 'Indeed', 'way', 'Monster', 'scene', 'occurring', '2002', 'Broomfield', 'much', 'different', 'account', 'Aileen', 'confesses', 'point', 'blank', 'camera', 'story', 'was', 'bald-faced', 'lie', 'came', 'up', 'engender', 'sympathy', 'herself', 'jury', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Later', 'film', 'however', 'Aileen', 'story', 'again', 'implies', 'first', 'killing', 'was', 'indeed', 'act', 'self-defense', 'Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'depressing', 'disturbing', 'film', 'number', 'levels', 'First', 'face-to-face', 'incomprehensible', 'mindset', 'cold-blooded', 'murderer', 'Aileen', 'across', 'times', 'warm', 'rational', 'honest', 'guilt', 'repentant', 'pain', 'caused', 'other', 'times', 'anger', 'friend', 'foe', 'alike', 'blue', 'streak', 'vile', 'curses', 'down', 'feels', 'have', 'wronged', 'everyone', 'fate', 'befallen', 'Second', 'film', 'question', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'really', 'know', 'person', 'telling', 'truth', 'even', 'oath', 'Third', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'there', 'messed-up', 'lives', 'upbringings', 'can', 'lead', 'type', 'dangerous', 'antisocial', 'behavior', 'Fourth', 'Aileen', 'clear', 'intense', 'paranoia', 'even', 'day', 'execution', 'was', 'convinced', 'police', 'knew', 'killings', 'long', 'brought', 'let', 'go', 'killing', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'rich', 'story', 'clearly', 'questions', 'just', 'how', 'sane', 'really', 'was', 'when', 'state', 'Florida', 'sent', 'death', 'end', 'Broomfield', 'generally', 'convinced', 'Aileen', 'was', 'pathological', 'liar', 'most', 'likely', 'guilty', 'first', 'degree', 'murder', 'not', 'let', 'other', 'parties', 'case', 'hook', 'easily', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'shoddy', 'defense', 'received', 'original', 'trial', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'many', 'closest', 'friends', 'even', 'Florida', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'made', 'money', 'selling', 'story', 'various', 'media', 'outlets', 'film', 'stinging', 'indictment', 'parties', 'involved', 'case.One', 'could', 'wish', 'little', 'less', 'personal', 'involvement', 'part', 'filmmaker', 'Too', 'often', 'feel', 'sacrificed', 'objectivity', ""n't"", 'providing', 'angles', 'story', 'need', 'render', 'fair', 'reasonable', 'judgment', 'instance', 'virtually', 'time', 'interviewing', 'loved', 'ones', 'men', 'Aileen', 'slaughtered', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Monster', 'Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'will', 'provide', 'further', 'insight', 'film', 'dark', 'subject', 'will', 'also', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'Theron', 'did', 'capturing', 'real', 'woman', 'story', 'core']",N/A

""horror buff""","[3, 4]","After seeing the movie Monster which was based on the life of the first female serial killer Aileen Wuornos, I was interested in seeing the real Aileen herself speaking of the murders she commited. This film does a great job of delivering to us a glimpse into the childhood and mind of a disturbed woman. The interviews are great and Aileen holds nothing back while talking to Nick. We get to see actual footage of her trials and of her proclaiming her innocence to admitting the she lied about being raped and having to kill in self defense. We are able to look into her black eyes and see the rage she felt. We see interviews with her few close friends who explain the terrible things that happened in Aileen's life that led her to Florida and eventually to being a hooker. She's labeled a serial killer because as she said, ""she has a number"". She murdered 7 men with the motive being to take their money and their vehicle. She admits that she had to kill them so they wouldn't go to the police. Aileen always believed that the police knew it was her killing these men but that they let her kill so they could make money off of her. However way you want to look at it, Aileen was a murderer but also a victim of circumstance. It is almost sad to see her speaking of her execution right until the day before it took place. Aileen came clean before her execution in 2002 by lethal injection after serving many years on death row. In her own words....""You have to kill Aileen Wuornos or she will kill again"". Also, I must say what a Excellent job Charlize Theron did playing Aileen in the movie Monster. It is no wonder she won an award for the movie.

817244,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B0001Z36Y6,stoic,"[3, 5]","""Aileen - Life and Death of a Serial Killer"" is a long, rambling look at Aileen Wuornos that was shot in the years leading up to her 2002 execution.To me, the best part of ""Aileen"" is its discussion of her personal history. Whatever one may feel about Wuornos, it is tinged by sympathy after learning about her grossly-dysfunctional family. She was abandoned by both of her parents and her father committed suicide in prison. While being raised by her grandparents, she was sexually active by the age of nine and had a child at thirteen. After Aileen gave birth to the child, her grandfather threw her out of the family home and she began to support herself as a prostitute.A huge portion of ""Aileen"" consists of prison interviews that filmmaker Nick Broomfield conducted with Wuornos. The interviews are a mixed bag. On the positive side, one gets unmistakable proof of Wournos' mental problems; she rants and raves about UFOs, ""sonic pressure,"" and poison in her food. On the negative side, a lot of the ranting simply doesn't make a lot of sense and it goes on forever.The video and audio on this film were not great. Broomfield relies on clips from media coverage of the Wuornos case to tell much of the story and those clips are often not of the best quality. Broomfield is a passionate opponent of the death penalty, but his discussion of the issue struck me as largely unoriginal.""Aileen"" is worth a look, but I cannot rate it any higher than three stars.",3,An Uneven Look at a Frightening Person,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,1462,"['Aileen', 'Life', 'Death', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'long', 'rambling', 'look', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'shot', 'years', 'leading', 'up', '2002', 'execution.To', 'best', 'part', 'Aileen', 'discussion', 'personal', 'history', 'one', 'may', 'feel', 'Wuornos', 'tinged', 'sympathy', 'learning', 'grossly-dysfunctional', 'family', 'was', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'father', 'committed', 'suicide', 'prison', 'being', 'raised', 'grandparents', 'was', 'sexually', 'active', 'age', 'nine', 'had', 'child', 'thirteen', 'Aileen', 'gave', 'birth', 'child', 'grandfather', 'threw', 'family', 'home', 'began', 'support', 'prostitute.A', 'huge', 'portion', 'Aileen', 'prison', 'interviews', 'filmmaker', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'conducted', 'Wuornos', 'interviews', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'positive', 'side', 'one', 'unmistakable', 'proof', 'Wournos', 'mental', 'problems', 'UFOs', 'sonic', 'pressure', 'poison', 'food', 'negative', 'side', 'lot', 'ranting', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'forever.The', 'video', 'audio', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'great', 'Broomfield', 'clips', 'media', 'coverage', 'Wuornos', 'case', 'tell', 'much', 'story', 'clips', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'best', 'quality', 'Broomfield', 'passionate', 'opponent', 'death', 'penalty', 'discussion', 'issue', 'struck', 'largely', 'unoriginal', 'Aileen', 'look', 'can', 'not', 'rate', 'higher', 'three', 'stars']",N/A
817245,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001Z36Y6,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","The second documentary features mainly the life of Aileen Wuornos waiting for execution.  But watching this fact on screen, and the real woman herself who is clearly seen driven to the edge of reasons, is a more fascinating or frightening experience than seeing the Aileen by Charlize Theron (though her achievement should not be denied).As many other reviewers said, this film is less about the killings; it's more about the life of Aileen when she was a child in a small community, and when she was waiting for the last moment of her life, both reconstructed by interviews including that of her biological mother and her best friend.Nick Bloomfield did a good job in capturing how it would be for her to wait in the Death Row.  Aileen, wide-eyed, with unkempt hair, is very terrifying and at the same time rivetting, showing the confused inner side of herself.  Even though we know that she killed seven people, and that we cannot take everything she says at face value, we keep on listening to her, no matter what she is trying to say.I for one disliked the way Nick Bloomfield's political opinions (or bias) influencing the film.  Some sarcastic commentary only hinders the true value of the materials he collected for the film, especially when he connects Aileen with the people like Jeb Bush.  To many viewers, it is too obvious, better left unsaid.  And the film is about Aileen, and it should be throughout.  (And I think he should have hired a professional actor as narrator.)The film is always fascinating to see, even when Nick is summoned as witness in court ... (and for what?  See it for yourself for it is about the previous documentary he made, which, it seems, turns out less accurate than it was thought.)  Though flawed, the film is worth your time, especially when you hear Aileen's last words (including the name of one sci-fi blockbuster film), which are more or less unique, and very pathetic.",4,(Really 3.5 Stars) Frightening Than 'Monster',1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,1916,"['second', 'documentary', 'features', 'mainly', 'life', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'waiting', 'execution', 'watching', 'fact', 'screen', 'real', 'woman', 'who', 'clearly', 'seen', 'driven', 'edge', 'reasons', 'more', 'fascinating', 'frightening', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Aileen', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'achievement', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'denied', '.As', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'film', 'less', 'killings', 'more', 'life', 'Aileen', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'small', 'community', 'when', 'was', 'waiting', 'last', 'moment', 'life', 'reconstructed', 'interviews', 'including', 'biological', 'mother', 'best', 'friend.Nick', 'Bloomfield', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'wait', 'Death', 'Row', 'Aileen', 'wide-eyed', 'unkempt', 'hair', 'very', 'terrifying', 'same', 'time', 'rivetting', 'showing', 'confused', 'inner', 'side', 'herself', 'Even', 'know', 'killed', 'seven', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'everything', 'face', 'value', 'keep', 'listening', 'matter', 'what', 'trying', 'say.I', 'one', 'disliked', 'way', 'Nick', 'Bloomfield', 'political', 'opinions', 'bias', 'influencing', 'film', 'sarcastic', 'commentary', 'only', 'true', 'value', 'materials', 'collected', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'Aileen', 'people', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'many', 'viewers', 'too', 'obvious', 'better', 'left', 'unsaid', 'film', 'Aileen', 'should', 'be', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'hired', 'professional', 'actor', 'narrator', 'film', 'always', 'fascinating', 'see', 'even', 'when', 'Nick', 'summoned', 'witness', 'court', 'what', 'See', 'previous', 'documentary', 'made', 'out', 'less', 'accurate', 'was', 'thought', 'flawed', 'film', 'time', 'especially', 'when', 'hear', 'Aileen', 'last', 'words', 'including', 'name', 'one', 'sci-fi', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'unique', 'very', 'pathetic']",N/A
817246,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B0001Z36Y6,V. Marshall,"[47, 49]","This film is stunning. The real Aileen Wournos is alternately scary and sad. This documentary is openly revealing and will make you contemplate justice.Aileen Wournos has been labeled a serial killer because of the murders she committed on 7 men who sought her services as a prostitute in Florida. Her story is depicted in the movie, ""Monster,"" and after watching this film I give more credit to Charlene Theron (the actress who portrayed Wournos) because Theron really got her mannerisms down. Beyond the glory of the Hollywood movie however is a life that spun out of control. Wournos was born as a breech birth, abused drugs, came from a broken home, was sexually promiscuous and was ostracized from her home at 13 after giving birth to a baby and giving it up for adoption. So what, a lot of people experience the same circumstances and manage not to commit murder, right? Well in my opinion this case is as complicated as it gets. In this film, director Nick Broomfield brings to a head all of these questions and allows the public to see the behind the scenes mind of a notorious ""serial killer,"" and how she got that way.Wournos gives several interviews during 2002 to Broomfield and as the film progresses she changes. At first Wournos appears severely angry, completely devoid of manners and calculating. Her eyes are black and somehow eerie to peer into and her laugh is a wicked cackle. When she loses her temper she does look like a ""monster"" and is quiet scary. But as the time passes it becomes more than obvious that the woman is completely insane. Her story changes and her original plea of self-defense becomes cold-blooded murder and then she changes her tale back again. She suffers from paranoia and begins to think the police knowingly allowed her to murder in order to clean up abusive men from the streets of Florida. Wournos attempts to explain how the prison is rigged with sound waves in order to destroy her brain.....here is where I lost it. This woman suffered her entire life and while I do not agree with her resorting to murder to appease her own weary soul I do feel our justice system owed her better treatment. Should insanity be punished by death? I questioned my own thoughts on the death penalty for days after watching this film.Nick Broomfield did an excellent job on this stunning documentary, bringing up many necessary points regarding our justice system. For instance Wournos is given a psychiatric evaluation by 3 doctors a day before her execution and they only interviewed her for 15 minutes. Being a layperson and watching Wournos speak for 15 minutes I was able to see that she is totally and sadly insane, why didn't the real doctors? One of the more emotional moments of the film is when Broomfield tells Wournos that he spoke with her real mother. Wournos becomes eerily enraged and horribly violent but after watching the mother's interview it is plain to see Wournos is not the only person at fault in her life. Wournos made a statement before her death stating ""I'll be back,"" and sadly I feel her spirit exists in many young lives that are left on the streets and forgotten, only to suffer from abuse and neglect because they cannot conform to ""normal"" society. Yes, murder is wrong but so is the abuse and torture that accompanies all those ""innocent"" sexual perverts who prey on our lost and lonely youths. Wournos was executed, she should have been institutionalized in a mental hospital and probably behind bars for life, but how many others will suffer her same fate?
