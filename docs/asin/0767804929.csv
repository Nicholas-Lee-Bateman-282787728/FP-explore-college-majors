The complex menage of Valentino (Vincent D'Onofrio), Gary2 (Thomas Jane), and Salma Hayek are a complex trio whose devotion to one another is never a smooth relationship.  Valentino is dying of AIDS and his lovers fight over how he should be cared for is a lesson in life and letting go.  This is a complex little film which stages its story against the backdrop of gay subculture and NYC porn.  It's not a film for everyone, but it is a wonderful love story that presents the tenderness and longing for love and companionship with respect.Thomas Jane is superb as a young man whose emotions are bottled up until he meets and loves Valentino, a gay porn star.  Salma Hayek is the volitile lover of Valentino, a spontaneous beauty whose lusty attack on life scares and irritates Gary.  How these three come to terms with death and life is a wonderful story for viewers with open minds....  This is a touching film for anyone who enjoys love stories and fabulous acting.

Litton,"[61, 67]","Thomas Jane, Salma Hayek and Vincent D'Onofrio shine like night stars in  the film, &quot;The Velocity of Gary,&quot; directed by Dan Ireland with a  wit and passion all its own. Opening with the character of &quot;Gary&quot;  (that is not his real name, nor is it ever revealed), walking through the  streets of New York City, clearly in the mood to pick up a guy or two. On  the way, he saves a deaf drag queen from getting killed, but regrets it  when he follows him everywhere. In comes Salma Hayek as Maricarmen, the  lusty yet snappy Latina who is in love with Valentino, played by Vincent  D'Onofrio. We soon learn two things: Gary is also in love with Valentino,  and Valentino is dying of AIDS from his work as a porn star. Throughout the  course of the movie, Maricarmen and Gary argue over what kind of care he  should be receiving, and who is going to supply that care. The real waves  of emotion come when the time for Valentino's impending death becomes very  short, and the three of them begin to take stock of themselves as well as  their relationship with one another. THis movie works the heart in more  ways than one, most notably being the dialogue. The line, &quot;Gary dreams  about kissing someone so hard his mouth hurts. He dreams about kissing  someone so soft his heart hurts, so long his neck hurts, so deep his throat  hurts. Gary dreams about kissing someone so... completely that nothing  hurts,&quot; is nothing but pure genius on the part of the writers. The  sexual inuendo in the film, such as the kiss between Valentino and Gary in  the phone room, takes it as far as it can without going into the extreme,  and the passion between characters is vivdly evident. The search for one's  purpose in life and where life goes is no more underlined than in this  movie, which will move its open-minded viewers to tears of sadness as well  as joy.",5,One of the most  touching films in years!,968371200,"09 8, 2000",2000,1875,"['Thomas', 'Jane', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'shine', 'night', 'stars', 'film', 'quot', 'Velocity', 'Gary', 'quot', 'directed', 'Dan', 'Ireland', 'wit', 'passion', 'own', 'Opening', 'character', 'quot', 'Gary', 'quot', 'not', 'real', 'name', 'ever', 'revealed', 'walking', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'clearly', 'mood', 'pick', 'up', 'guy', 'two', 'way', 'deaf', 'drag', 'queen', 'getting', 'killed', 'regrets', 'when', 'everywhere', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Maricarmen', 'lusty', 'yet', 'snappy', 'Latina', 'who', 'love', 'Valentino', 'played', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'soon', 'learn', 'two', 'things', 'Gary', 'also', 'love', 'Valentino', 'Valentino', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'work', 'porn', 'star', 'course', 'movie', 'Maricarmen', 'Gary', 'argue', 'what', 'kind', 'care', 'should', 'be', 'receiving', 'who', 'going', 'supply', 'care', 'real', 'waves', 'emotion', 'come', 'when', 'time', 'Valentino', 'impending', 'death', 'becomes', 'very', 'short', 'three', 'begin', 'take', 'stock', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'one', 'THis', 'movie', 'heart', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'most', 'notably', 'being', 'dialogue', 'line', 'quot', 'Gary', 'kissing', 'someone', 'so', 'hard', 'mouth', 'hurts', 'kissing', 'someone', 'so', 'soft', 'heart', 'so', 'long', 'neck', 'hurts', 'so', 'deep', 'throat', 'Gary', 'kissing', 'someone', 'so', 'completely', 'nothing', 'hurts', 'quot', 'nothing', 'pure', 'genius', 'part', 'writers', 'sexual', 'inuendo', 'film', 'such', 'kiss', 'Valentino', 'Gary', 'phone', 'room', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'going', 'extreme', 'passion', 'characters', 'vivdly', 'evident', 'search', 'one', 'purpose', 'life', 'where', 'life', 'more', 'underlined', 'movie', 'will', 'move', 'open-minded', 'viewers', 'tears', 'sadness', 'as', 'well', 'joy']",N/A

This is now one of my favorite movies of all time!  The characters and story drew me in so deeply that I re-watched it a couple of days later.  The story of the charismatic, dying Valentino and his two lovers really moved me.  These were people who loved each other in their own way.  Even though Gary and Mary Carmen fought all the time, their love for Valentino was enough to keep them together.  I found the story to be touching, the dialogue interesting and the actors perfect in their roles.This is a film that is more understandable if you have known a lot of people who live alternative lifestyles.  I've been friends with people in relationships like this and its a very complicated situation.  I also enjoyed the strange characters like Kid Joey, the drag queen obsessed with Patsy Cline and Gary. He was so desperate and sad and I wish his character would have been in the movie longer. All these people were different and bizarre yet they all seemed to care about each other.  Not to mention there is a really hot kiss between two gorgeous men! The ending was moving to me in that it gave you a sense of optimism for their future.  It doesn't necessarily have a happy ending but its a real ending with heart.Obviously this is a movie that is not for everyone but for those with an open mind, you can become absorbed in this story.

It's a courageous movie, and an honest one.  Mainly, it concerns an ex-porn star, his male lover, and his fag hag, as well as the odd assortment of street people who weave in and out of their lives.  The three principals love and fight among themselves as they cope with an ever approaching grim reaper.  The movie's ultimate accomplishment is to show us the great beauty and humanity that exists, even sparkles, in the souls of a group of outcasts written off by just about everyone else.  It is also a hopeful movie in which the power of love overcomes even death.  Unfortunately, it is NOT a movie for &quot;straight&quot; people -- and I use that term in a far wider context than sexually straight.  Let's just say that the arthritic-minded will be too repelled or too fearful to open themselves up to this highly positive cinematic experience.  Additionally, the movie is sensitively directed, and superbly acted by all.",5,Accurate Portrayal of New York Underbelly,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,1388,"['took', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'misled', 'inaccurate', 'unfair', 'reviews', 'When', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'more', 'rubbed', 'up', 'milieu', 'presented', 'movie', 'use', 'drugs', 'kept', 'minimum', 'here', 'Based', 'own', 'experiences', 'relationships', 'various', 'characters', 'ranging', 'who', 'are', 'callous', 'heartless', 'who', 'are', 'passionate', 'intense', 'was', 'right', 'mark', 'courageous', 'movie', 'honest', 'one', 'Mainly', 'ex-porn', 'star', 'male', 'lover', 'fag', 'hag', 'as', 'well', 'odd', 'assortment', 'street', 'people', 'who', 'weave', 'lives', 'three', 'principals', 'love', 'fight', 'cope', 'ever', 'approaching', 'grim', 'reaper', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'accomplishment', 'show', 'great', 'beauty', 'humanity', 'even', 'sparkles', 'souls', 'group', 'outcasts', 'written', 'off', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'also', 'hopeful', 'movie', 'power', 'love', 'overcomes', 'even', 'death', 'Unfortunately', 'NOT', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'people', 'use', 'term', 'far', 'wider', 'context', 'sexually', 'straight', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'arthritic-minded', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'repelled', 'too', 'fearful', 'open', 'up', 'highly', 'positive', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Additionally', 'movie', 'sensitively', 'directed', 'superbly', 'acted']",N/A
7749,AU2K7XS4RV615,0767804929,"Sinforozo ""Soy Boricua""","[7, 17]","This is one of the worst movies in the genre of gay films. The trilogy of Gary, Mary Carmen and Valentino, as the homo-hetero sexual interchange partner is a &quot;salad mix&quot; in its confusion and full of contradictions.  Gary is a gay prostitute in his lowest decadent stages.  Mary Carmen is a confused girl her only needs is being possessed at any form by Valentino.  Gary and Mary Carmen are only the sexual objects of Valentino, a porno star afflicted by AIDS.  Salma Hayek (again) as a Latin girl Mary Carmen is a stereotype of other films she made before.  Her possessive role of Valentino's lover jealous of Gary, is an example of a masochistic mind..  The common viewer cannot easily understand why Valentino's love for both of them.  Gary with an obsessive compulsion to be kissing a sadistic manner with Valentino is almost censurable if not, irrational.  In the other side, the drag queen is the most interesting of all the characters in this film.  One of the scenes that capture the attention is when Gary holds in his arms and takes &quot;her&quot;, bringing a Samaritan scene in our modern days.  This guy seems to love Gary in a platonic manner.  However, &quot;she&quot; is someone who Gary does not love does.  When she waits for Gary to do his prostitution practices, &quot;she&quot; passes the time playing a video game, which only chants Loser, Loser, Loser! at her; and since he is deaf and relies on lip-reading to understand others, she cannot hear the machine calling her a loser, in a similar obsessive situation  she continues to pursuit for Gary's affection.  The drag queen at the moment of &quot;her&quot; death, taken by Gary's arms can only whisper &quot;I can't breathe&quot;.  The emergency ambulance technicians said  --&quot;Its only a fag, shocked by a car&quot;--, shows the homophobic feeling commonly perceived in this film.  Valentino with AIDS; ends his last days in agony.  Mary Carmen shows her love to him by giving live to a baby of both of them, Mary Carmen and Valentino -(maybe). Gary and Mary Carmen, and the baby at this moment, are potential victims of HIV.  To summarize, this film have similar scenes from &quot;All about my mother&quot; in the script and the characters.

I didn't connect with the movie.  It isn't until Vincent D'Onofrio begins to die of AIDS does the characters really come out. The acting in the beginning wasn't too good, it's as though they shot the first part when the actors were young, then let them go off and become really good, and then shoot the second half. Mary Carmen comes across as not believeable sometimes but she does put on a good performance. Vincent D'Onofrio seems a bit fake, almost flaky and its as though Thomas Jane isn't even in the movie.
