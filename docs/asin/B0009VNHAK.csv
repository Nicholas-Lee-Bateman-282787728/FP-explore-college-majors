913891,A1NMBRFXARNJQQ,B0009VNHAK,"Brian Bussey ""busseyb""","[0, 1]","I bought this with the foreknowledge that it was more comedy than serious Sasquatch science however the core of the documentary was based on Scott's life changing encounter back in 1992. It was a pleasure to see that he managed to keep an intelligent sense of humor about the whole thing while still presenting present day beliefs of this wild man of the woods. I believe it's because he has not devoted every waking hour into proving the creature exists and after seeing those who have, it's a good thing. Scott obviously knows natural comedy and how to draw it out of everyday people and A superb job of editing didn't hurt either.  This DVD is worth every penny I spent and I agree with previous posts... I hope he does more of this in the future.",5,Very Smart Docu-comedy worth every penny,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,750,"['bought', 'foreknowledge', 'was', 'more', 'comedy', 'serious', 'Sasquatch', 'science', 'however', 'core', 'documentary', 'was', 'based', 'Scott', 'life', 'changing', 'encounter', 'back', '1992', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'managed', 'keep', 'intelligent', 'sense', 'humor', 'whole', 'thing', 'still', 'presenting', 'present', 'day', 'beliefs', 'wild', 'man', 'woods', 'believe', 'not', 'devoted', 'waking', 'hour', 'proving', 'creature', 'seeing', 'who', 'have', 'good', 'thing', 'Scott', 'obviously', 'natural', 'comedy', 'how', 'draw', 'everyday', 'people', 'A', 'superb', 'job', 'editing', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'DVD', 'worth', 'penny', 'spent', 'agree', 'previous', 'posts', 'hope', 'more', 'future']",Squatching/Journey Toward Squatchdom

913894,A2BKFOS8V9ZRAW,B0009VNHAK,H.M. 2005,"[5, 6]","This double-DVD is really well-crafted, and Scott Herriott really uses a good deal of comedic elements to make his point. ""Squatching"" is seriocomic, and describes Scott's true passion for the subject of Sasquatch. It's a little more serious than ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"", but it does have comedic moments. We meet his mom and dad, his girlfriend, even his dog. We also meet other well-known Bigfoot personalities along the way, such as Loren Coleman, William Dranginis, Dr. John Bindernagel and Craig Woolheater, and get to see some really beautiful country in northern California. ""Journey Toward Squatchdom"" is so much funnier than ""Squatching"". It really showcases Scott's comedic talents and is genuinely hilarious. We meet more Bigfoot personalities, such as Ray Crowe, the late Datus Perry and Frank Kaneaster. I laughed out loud more than once watching this documentary. If you like serious, scientific documentaries on Sasquatch, buy ""Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science"". But, if you want to watch a semiserious documentary that will make you laugh your butt off, this is the one to buy!",5,Absolutely recommended to all believers and non-believers!!!,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1096,"['double-DVD', 'really', 'well-crafted', 'Scott', 'Herriott', 'really', 'good', 'deal', 'comedic', 'elements', 'make', 'point', 'Squatching', 'seriocomic', 'Scott', 'true', 'passion', 'subject', 'Sasquatch', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'Journey', 'Toward', 'Squatchdom', 'have', 'comedic', 'moments', 'meet', 'mom', 'dad', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'dog', 'also', 'meet', 'other', 'well-known', 'Bigfoot', 'personalities', 'way', 'such', 'Loren', 'Coleman', 'William', 'Dranginis', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Bindernagel', 'Craig', 'Woolheater', 'get', 'see', 'really', 'beautiful', 'country', 'northern', 'California', 'Journey', 'Toward', 'Squatchdom', 'so', 'much', 'funnier', 'Squatching', 'really', 'Scott', 'comedic', 'talents', 'genuinely', 'hilarious', 'meet', 'more', 'Bigfoot', 'personalities', 'such', 'Ray', 'Crowe', 'late', 'Datus', 'Perry', 'Frank', 'Kaneaster', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'once', 'watching', 'documentary', 'like', 'serious', 'scientific', 'documentaries', 'Sasquatch', 'buy', 'Sasquatch', 'Legend', 'Science', 'want', 'watch', 'semiserious', 'documentary', 'will', 'make', 'butt', 'off', 'one', 'buy']",Squatching/Journey Toward Squatchdom

Take a trip down the lighter side in the hunt for the Squatch. You will see the Darrel Owens video of a light coloured bigfoot which is less funny than the rest of the show.

Howell ""boriskhan""","[1, 2]","Breaking into two parts, first the ""Squatching"" part gets 4 stars and covers what is a typical foray into the woods on a weekend search for the elusive critters. This is well done albeit a tiny bit lacking in substance. Would like to have seen a bit more about his own 'footage' that was shot with Daryl Owen. Herriott references the video and shows a scrap of it but I'd like to have seen more analysis of it. Still it's good.Second part is for ""Journey to Squatchdom"" which is a humerous take on the elusive critters. This segment gets a good solid 5 stars as it is quite funny and is willing to poke fun at himself as a ""bigfoot investigator"". I feel this is how most of society would view what sasquatch researchers actually do. It's not but man, Herriott sure makes it entertaining to those people that do do it this way.Overall both segments are good for different reasons.
