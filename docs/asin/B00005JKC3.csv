It's slow and  doesn't have as much action as you'd expect. It does have a nice science fiction tone to it though. It reminded me of some of those science fiction movies from the 80's. Sorta like Altered States with William Hurt or even Darkman. It's more like those movies than it is like the old tv show. I mean it has that plot where a scientist transformed from science and his g/f is trying to save him.When he does transform it gets silly once he starts jumping from mountain to mountain. I don't know if he had a super jumping ability in the tv show or the comic but it's pretty silly. The movie had too many scenes with him just jumping around too. It may of worked for Ang Lee to have people jumping and flying in Crouching Tigar, Hidden Dragon but it doesn't work in the Hulk. Also when a helacopters are chasing him around, it reminded me too much of that bad 1998 Godzilla movie. The Hulk looks too cartoonish too. They should have just colored the WWE's Brock Lesner green lol.I still liked it though, some of the action was fun such as the Hulk vs super genetic dogs. The performances by Eric Bana ""Black Hawke Down"", Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connely and Sam Elliot are all strong. I hope that the sequel is more focused and has more action though.

584482,A37F8W82A1E6L7,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","As a long time comic fan I have sat through some horrible interpretations of my favorite heroes on the big screen.  Everyone remember Dolph Lungren as The Punisher??  While watching The Hulk last night on DVD I couldn't help but smile as I saw old Jade Jaws leaping across the desert, hammer throwing tanks and riding fighter jets into the upper atmosphere.  Sure, he looked cartoonish at times, but come one people!  This is a fifteen foot tall, green, muscle-bound behemoth we're talking about.  The battle scenes looked cartoony because they were supposed to look cartoony.  In a few scenes, most notably when Betty discovers him outside the cabin, The Hulk looked very realistic.  The tenderness and love on his CGI face spoke volumes.What about the plot?  It served the action well and the pace really picked up nicely about a third of the way through.  Granted, the start of the film was somewhat repetitive and slow but the moment Bruce hulked out the first time we picked up a boatload of steam and just kept right on going.I have heard a lot of people bemoaning the fact that the origin story was changed substantially from the book as well.  The only thing I have to say about that is that the origin fit the time well.  When The Hulk first debuted The USA was just tied up in a period of history commonly known as The Cold War.  There was a genuine fear across the nation that we might be attacked with nuclear weapons and the science fiction of the times utilized that fear to it's advantage.  Now we have chemical and biological weapons to worry about instead.  Genetic engineering and nano-technology hold greater possibilities of wiping out the human population of the world than nukes ever did.  Fear of man's dark side getting access to it's greatest power... That's what The Hulk was about in 1966 and that's what he's about today.I'm not saying that Ang Lee has bested himself over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but this is a fun popcorn movie that remains true to the spirit of the comic that spawned it. This film is loads of fun while The Jolly Green Giant breaks stuff and was cut beautifuly in a panel style that comic book lovers will really enjoy.

584485,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","Back in 2003, when Ang Lee's blockbuster turned box office flop ""Hulk"" was initially released to theaters, I was a fan of the movie. I thought that the movie had received some unfounded hatred in the eyes of moviegoers and even comic book fans for that matter, and I couldn't understand what their problems were with the movie. I had watched the movie several times since its debut, and still found myself enjoying it (although I will admit the origin was beginning to get a little old after awhile). In fact I had owned the movie up until recently; this is no longer the case due to a recent viewing of the movie in an effort to psyche myself up for the recently released to theaters ""The Incredible Hulk"" starring Edward Norton in the title role (previously played by Eric Bana). After that most recent viewing, I finally discovered why so many people have hated this movie, and now I wonder how it was that I didn't see the problems before.""Hulk"" is the story of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a scientist specializing in the field of gamma radiation. While working on ways to use gamma radiation to heal wounds for soldiers along with fellow scientist/former girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), Bruce through a series of unfortunate circumstances, finds himself doused with radiation. Though he should be dead from radiation poisoning, something inside Banner has allowed him to survive, but in the process that special ""something"" has unleashed a monster inside of him that had been hidden there all along, turning Bruce Banner into the rampaging Hulk. Now, Bruce must try to find a way to rid himself of this monstrous Hulk inside of him, while trying his best to evade capture at the hands of Betty's zealous father General Ross (Sam Elliott) whose superiors want to use the Hulk as a weapon for the U.S. military.Here's where things went wrong for me with ""Hulk"", to begin with I pulled my copy of ""Hulk"" off my DVD shelf and stuck it in the DVD player expecting to enjoy it once more. Much to my surprise I found myself completely bored out of my mind during the insanely long and extremely bloated origin sequence that sucks all of the life out of the first hour of the movie. Now, I remember when I had watched this movie numerous times before I had felt that the origin could have used some trimming to make it move at a faster, more exciting pace; yet I had still enjoyed all the detail that had been worked into the story to explain the intense psychological damage that had been done to young Bruce Banner throughout his childhood that would one day lead to him becoming the monstrous Hulk. For some reason I no longer enjoyed the opening origin scenes, which I think has to do with the fact that I had seen it enough already, plus the origin didn't really match up with that of the comics all that much, but I was hoping to still enjoy the action scenes during the last half of the film where Banner becomes Hulk.So, I continued watching only to discover even more disappointment when I realized how much I didn't care about the action scenes due to the opening hour draining every ounce of interest I had previously held in the film's proceedings. The action sequences are still energetic and fun to watch, and in some instances perfectly capture some of the greatest battles in the long history of Hulk comic books. I wasn't all that surprised that the battles were staged in such an epic manner given Ang Lee's previous film had been the martial arts epic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but his penchant for flashy visuals led to questionable editing techniques that were meant to resemble comic book panels, but became too distracting and jarring to enjoy. Also, why did Ang Lee choose to film moss covered rocks and various plant life in and around the desert, instead of moving the film along to prevent boredom from setting in for the audience? Whatever the reason, Ang Lee wasted way too much time focusing on the film's environments when he should have been more concerned with getting the Hulk on screen faster and more often, or finding a consistent size and color for Hulk's CGI rendering.The computer generated Hulk was impressive upon first glance, but upon further inspection one begins to notice how inconsistent his appearance is throughout the entire last half of the film once he makes his debut. The color of green used for the Hulk's skin goes from a dullish green to a bright green, back to a dullish green yet again and this continues between every scene the Hulk is in, and sometimes the color shifts during one scene several times. As if that inconsistency wasn't enough, the size of the Hulk changes from scene to scene, at times the size change made sense within the film's storyline which called for Hulk's size to increase the madder he got, and other times the size change just seemed to shift depending on which camera angle was being used; however, the size change of Hulk was just another aspect of the movie that differs from the comic books. In the comics, Hulk's size didn't change the angrier he got; he merely got stronger and stronger. At one point the Hulk's size was so gigantic that he was as tall as some full grown trees surrounding Betty's house, and these weren't small trees by any means, no these were as tall if not taller than her house (which may have been two stories, though that's inconsequential). I don't understand why Ang Lee, and the computer wizards he employed to bring the Hulk to life, didn't notice these glaringly obvious inconsistencies, and try to rectify them at some point in the post-production process; but they didn't, and we were left with a movie that is so full of distractions in the visual effects department that the action scenes were no longer exciting, just disappointing.The acting was solid, and was probably the best aspect of the entire movie. Eric Bana (""Troy"") was a good Bruce Banner at the time, although after seeing Ed Norton's performance in ""The Incredible Hulk"", Bana's performance pales in comparison. Jennifer Connelly (""A Beautiful Mind"") was a great choice for Betty Ross, Bruce's love interest in the film; she portrays Betty as a woman who is conflicted over her feelings for Bruce, yet is determined to stand by his side. She loves the man, but is angered by the fact that science always seemed to take precedence over her needs; however, once Banner became Hulk, she put aside her conflicted emotions in order to be there for him when he needed her most. Sam Elliott (""The Golden Compass"") was a perfect choice to bring General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross to life on the big screen, his performance was one that commanded respect from all around, and yet he could still be vulnerable to his only weakness, his daughter Betty. Josh Lucas (""Glory Road"") was decent as one of the villains in the movie, a sniveling weasel of a human being named Glen, who desires Betty and is willing to do whatever it takes to get her and her research to himself. Rounding out the cast is a rather disheveled looking Nick Nolte, who apparently felt his appearance in his infamous mug shot from a few years ago, was a great look as he kept it for this movie and also his upcoming appearance in the Ben Stiller action comedy ""Tropic Thunder"". Nick's performance as Banner's deranged, semi-mad scientist father was interesting to watch; although, I didn't appreciate the way he became the primary villain in the movie. The decision to turn Nick's character into an ""absorbing man"" to confront the Hulk in the film's climactic sequence seemed a little bit tacked on, giving me the feeling that the writers had kind of run out of ideas for having the military be the primary antagonists, and were in need of some kind of a way out of the corner they had painted themselves into.Ang Lee's wannabe superhero epic ""Hulk"" could have been, and truly should have been, a visual effects extravaganza, full of intense battles, adventure, a little comedy, some drama, and even a few dangling plot lines left somewhat unresolved to lead into what should have been the inevitable sequel. However, a far too in depth and poorly paced origin sequence that doesn't even stay true to the source material, inconsistent visual effects work on the Hulk, and an ill-conceived final act made this potential blockbuster into a gigantic flop that has not been easily forgotten.""Hulk"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.",2,Avoid This Hulking Mess of a Superhero

Dealing with extreme repressed memories as the result of a tragedy that resulted in the death of his mother and the arrest of his father, Banner has become so withdrawn that it causes his break-up with fellow scientist Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  During the course of researching cell-regeneration, Banner must save a fellow worker from a potentially lethal overdose of gamma radiation.  Now, whenever he's angry, Banner morphs in the raging green powerhouse known only as the Hulk.After the great success of X-MEN, DAREDEVIL and SPIDER-MAN, it was inevitable that Marvel's Jekyll &amp; Hyde character, the Hulk would get his shot at cinematic glory.  After all, in the 40 years since he first popped out of the comic pages, this rampaging monster had thrilled many a reader as well inspiring a classic TV series.  When director Ang Lee (CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) was tapped for the project, the expectations were very high indeed.  While the final result is definitely impressive, it is not completely successful.Part of this stems from the fact that Lee plays the story completely straight, with hardly any traces of the humor that marks previous Marvel adaptations.  While it makes sense with his overall vision, it makes the first 40 minutes of the film a bit of a drag.  Indeed things finally start to pick up when Banner finally makes his big change to the Hulk at that point.  As repressed Banner, Bana definitely nails the character.  However, the character's very nature makes it very hard to sympathize with him.  In contrast, Jennifer Connelly fares better as his concerned girlfriend.  Surprisingly, the most effective performance comes from Sam Elliott's portrayal as General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross.  While he comes across as a typical hard-nosed soldier, one can sense the conflicted depths of the man.  The CGI created Hulk is also effective in providing the emotion that Bana seemingly lacks.  Nick Nolte turns in a rather bizarre performance as Banner's long-lost father that strangely fits into Lee's directorial vision.Like the other Marvel movies, the action scenes in this flick are top notch.  You only wish there were more of them and less angst in the picture.Overall, HULK is definitely a noble effort by Ang Lee to produce a serious look at the super-hero genre. It might not please everyone, but it is a unique entry in the super-hero film field.

The only problem is how the story is adapted.In this first adaptation, which in fact isn't that loyal to the comic book origins; begins the story of tormented scientist Bruce Banner and his search for a new means to heal and cure people in a way never imagined. His attempts fail after he is exposed to gamma rays. This of course unleashes what is already inside of Banner. Now there are many details in the movie that I'm not gona ruin, for that you would have to see the movie.

The Hulk is activated by the rage of Bruce Banner, but for many years the comics failed to address this important aspect of the doctor's personality.  Lee and his writers have realized that it is important to establish the repressed character of Banner before the Hulk becomes truly believable as a personification of his anger.  The result is a lengthy build-up before the Hulk's first appearance.  Unlike many, I was not bothered by this, because the drama between the characters was so effective.  When the Hulk finally does make his appearance, the screen explodes with action and does so pretty consistently until the end of the movie.A couple quibbles: I found the inventive style Lee adopted for the film annoying rather than enlightening, and too much of the action was poorly lit.

The notion of psychological instability in a super hero was a theme previously explored in Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989).  Thus, Lee was breaking no new ground in portraying a character with more angst and grimness than his fellow costumed counterparts.  Yet, Burton was wise enough to realize that a touch of humor and a sprinkle of fun was necessary in order to keep a film entertaining.  Without a wink of an eye and the occasional smile, a film full of dour people can seem like sitting in on a two hour session with a psychologist and his patients.  Certainly not what was expected from a big budget summer film.Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) had his genetic make-up manipulated by his father (Nick Nolte) as a youth.  These manipulations trigger a startling metamorphosis in Banner after a gamma radiation accident in his lab years later.  Thereafter, whenever he becomes agitated, Banner transforms into a green goliath.  With his former lover Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) and her father General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (Sam Elliott) in pursuit, the Hulk leaves a trail of destruction in his wake.  Eventually, Banner is reunited with his father who has his own diabolical scheme to make use of the Hulk's power.Ang Lee has for the most part deviated from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's original source material in constructing his film.  There is no gamma bomb, there is no Rick Jones, and Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) has been re-imagined.  All of these creative changes turn out to be ill-advised as it distances the film from the original Hulk mythos.  Elliot is the only character that rekindles memories of his comic book counterpart.  Furthermore, while the special effects are serviceable, the action scenes that showcase them are uninspired and bland.  To be honest, Ang Lee just was not the right director to handle this material.

If some of the naysayers had gotten their way, we'd have two solid hours of the Hulk destroying things: See Hulk smash cars--now buildings--now tanks--now helicopters--now monsters.  What did we miss?  National landmarks?  Check out King Kong and Godzilla if you didn't get your fill in that department.  No, Hulk isn't perfect; but what a pleasant surprise to see a comic-book flick that trys to offer a bit more than a token storyline and endless eye-candy special effects.Let's face it, folks, the Hulk isn't much of a conversationalist; he doesn't dish out the witty repartee with his enemies that Batman and Spiderman do.  No fancy utility belt or vehicles, either.  He's just a big green guy whose special power is his knack for reducing his surroundings to rubble.  You've got to fill in the gaps between those crushfests with something of substance or what you end up with is akin to watching another person play a video game.The original comic-book storyline for the Hulk wasn't anything earthshattering.  But within the parameters they had to work with, the filmmakers managed to put together a decent story (with a few new twists) which is bolstered by some pretty respectable acting all around.  The fact that the movie builds up to the fun stuff by laying down foundational material is, to some, an unpardonable sin.  But unless you resort to flashbacks, how else do you to develop the story and characters enough that the audience cares one bit about what happens to them?  If your answer is, ""Who cares?"" see my first paragraph.I enjoyed the comic-book-style split screens and wipes (which some people were put off by) and thought they were deftly applied.  The techniques weren't overused and were mostly relegated to transitions and non-action sequences where they provided a spot of visual gee-whiz during otherwise slow moments.So, why not five stars?  While I did enjoy the movie, there was room for improvement.For starters, the big climax was, well, a bit anticlimactic.  The final fight seemed too short and hardly gave you a chance to appreciate the unique powers of the Hulk's adversary. (WARNING: spoiler coming in the next sentence) Also, how in the world could they choose an ending in which a no-name fighter jockey is the one who defeats the bad guy and saves the protagonist?  Isn't that Filmmaking 101 stuff?Actor Eric Bana may have brought the ""hunk"" factor to the role of Bruce Banner, but I felt there was something missing from the part.  Banner's character seemed detached (which was fine), but I didn't get the sense there was great turmoil bubbling under the surface--just a lot of blank spots in his childhood memory bank.  He needed to portray more internal conflict and less blank confusion due to repressed memories.Even the Hulk himself seemed a little placid at times.  Once or twice he could have benefited from a transfusion of rage.  In fairness, this may be truer to Stan Lee's original vision than what I would have prefered.  Lee says in one of the featurettes that he was inspired, in part, by Frankenstein--not a rampaging monster, rather a creature who basically just wanted to be left alone but for the pesky villagers who kept harassing him.The Hulk did look remarkably lifelike and shows off the state of the art in humanoid CGI work (which is still less than perfect).  But I don't understand why they put such a (relatively) whimpy chest on an otherwise massive character.  Criminy, he's the Hulk--give the guy some pecs to match the rest of his physique.  Oh, and his four-mile ""hops"" were even more physics defying than his ability to grow 15 feet tall yet still retain his Bruce-Banner-sized pants.  But, ok, this is the realm of comic books, so we'll give it to him.Another minor quibble--I thought director Ang Lee's decision to don the black suit with polka dots used for the motion-capture filming was less inspired than the crew seemed to think in the making-of featurette.  It may have helped Lee capture the Hulk's more poignant moments, but it was less effective in some of the action sequences.  Lee, for all his enthusiasm, is no athlete, and--if you watch closely--it's evident in a couple of the scenes.  At times, the Hulk's movements looked, um, less than Hulk-Hoganesque.  Nothing too glaring, but Lee should have turned the suit over to a stuntman or pro wrestler for the action shots.  (Hey, we want our boy to look his best when he's out kickin' fanny.)But on balance, Hulk delivers pretty solid entertainment for a comic-book film and is a worthy addition to the body of work born of Stan Lee's forty-year-old brainchild.  If you're looking for camp and non-stop action, go watch the Batman sequels.  If you want action at the expense of character development, go watch the first X-men movie.  But if you want a well-acted, intelligible storyline punctuated with some rather impressive visual effects, pull up a chair.

584497,A2P6PVWZS4NGV0,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","I watched this movie solely out of loyalty--to the comic books I read in my youth, to fond memories of the old Hulk TV show starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno (who appears in a brief cameo early in the film, and looks stiff even without a line to speak).  The reason for my reluctance, of course, was the parade of negative reviews, along with uniformly bad word-of-mouth.  The movie was supposed to be slow, with corny-looking CG effects and too much comic-book hokum to try to make sense of.Well, it's all true.  By modern action-movie standards, this one is pretty slow to develop.  His enormous green badness doesn't make his first appearance until more than 40 minutes into the film.  The CG-animated Hulk occasionally looks exactly like a CG-animated Hulk, and after Spielberg's dinosaurs this might be a disappointment.  And while most of the comic book silliness does manage to hold together, the final conflict is a step too far, and difficult to follow besides.  On top of this, Eric Bana is not the most convincing actor you'll see, and Nick Nolte's performance as Bruce Banner's criminally psychotic, mad genius father is entirely a matter of personal taste.  At one point in the movie, the Hulk picks up a tank by its gun and swings it around like he's performing the hammer throw at the Olympics; only a few seconds later, as if to underscore what exactly is physically impossible about this (even after you've accepted the notion of a big green man who can throw a tank thousands of feet), he bends the gun of another tank, and the tank fails to move. Finally, we are forced to swallow the now completely discredited fad notion of repressed memories as a psychological motivation for our man Bruce Banner.Ugh.To balance this, however, we do have Ang Lee's completely arresting visual style, augmented here by the use of split screens in what must be meant as an homage to the comic book medium from which the Hulk originates.  What others seem to perceive as &quot;slow&quot; I perceive as &quot;well-paced.&quot;  Lee is a good filmmaker, not a maker of music videos, and his care does show.So does his seriousness, and this really seems to set a lot of people off.  Do these critics really believe the movie would or could have been better if Lee had brought more campiness to it?  Or is there some deeper need to relegate a character from a comic book to a style they can view with ironic detachment?  For in the end, the Hulk is little more than Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with more fireworks, and I seem to remember that Stevenson's tale had more going for it than campy shenanigans.  The word &quot;archetype&quot; comes to mind...There's a lot to quibble about in this film, even if you take it for entertainment value alone.  But there's a lot here that other action-film makers could learn from.  A lot of viewers, too.Postscript:  the extras in the two-disc version are no more or less than you might expect.  I don't really have the time to watch these sorts of things anymore--working for living and all--but in general I've found that too much of these &quot;making of&quot; documentaries can interfere with enjoying the film as a _film_, with forgetting the artifice of it all and losing myself in the movie.  Deleted scenes are particularly deadly in this respect.  Only the &quot;true&quot; fan will want to watch them all.  The rest of us should settle for the single-disc version if we settle for any version at all.",3,"Flawed, but not nearly as bad as you may have heard.",1079308800,"03 15, 2004",2004,3448,"['watched', 'movie', 'solely', 'loyalty', 'comic', 'books', 'read', 'youth', 'fond', 'memories', 'old', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'show', 'starring', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'who', 'brief', 'cameo', 'early', 'film', 'stiff', 'even', 'line', 'speak', 'reason', 'reluctance', 'course', 'was', 'parade', 'negative', 'reviews', 'uniformly', 'bad', 'word-of-mouth', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'slow', 'corny-looking', 'CG', 'effects', 'too', 'much', 'comic-book', 'hokum', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'of.Well', 'true', 'modern', 'action-movie', 'standards', 'one', 'pretty', 'slow', 'develop', 'enormous', 'green', 'badness', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', 'appearance', 'more', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'CG-animated', 'Hulk', 'occasionally', 'exactly', 'CG-animated', 'Hulk', 'Spielberg', 'dinosaurs', 'might', 'be', 'disappointment', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'silliness', 'manage', 'hold', 'together', 'final', 'conflict', 'step', 'too', 'far', 'difficult', 'follow', 'besides', 'top', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'not', 'most', 'convincing', 'actor', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'performance', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'criminally', 'psychotic', 'mad', 'genius', 'father', 'entirely', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Hulk', 'up', 'tank', 'gun', 'swings', 'around', 'performing', 'hammer', 'throw', 'Olympics', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'underscore', 'what', 'exactly', 'physically', 'impossible', 'even', ""'ve"", 'accepted', 'notion', 'big', 'green', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'throw', 'tank', 'thousands', 'feet', 'gun', 'tank', 'tank', 'move', 'Finally', 'are', 'forced', 'swallow', 'now', 'completely', 'discredited', 'fad', 'notion', 'repressed', 'memories', 'psychological', 'motivation', 'man', 'Bruce', 'Banner.Ugh.To', 'balance', 'however', 'do', 'have', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'completely', 'arresting', 'visual', 'style', 'augmented', 'here', 'use', 'split', 'screens', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'meant', 'homage', 'comic', 'book', 'medium', 'Hulk', 'What', 'others', 'seem', 'perceive', 'quot', 'slow', 'quot', 'perceive', 'quot', 'well-paced.', 'quot', 'Lee', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'maker', 'music', 'videos', 'care', 'show.So', 'seriousness', 'really', 'set', 'lot', 'people', 'Do', 'critics', 'really', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Lee', 'had', 'brought', 'more', 'campiness', 'there', 'deeper', 'need', 'relegate', 'character', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'can', 'view', 'ironic', 'detachment', 'end', 'Hulk', 'little', 'more', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'more', 'fireworks', 'seem', 'remember', 'Stevenson', 'tale', 'had', 'more', 'going', 'campy', 'shenanigans', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'mind', 'lot', 'quibble', 'about', 'film', 'even', 'take', 'entertainment', 'value', 'alone', 'lot', 'here', 'other', 'action-film', 'makers', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'viewers', 'too.Postscript', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'version', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'might', 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'sorts', 'things', 'anymore', 'working', 'living', 'general', ""'ve"", 'found', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'documentaries', 'can', 'interfere', 'enjoying', 'film', '_film_', 'forgetting', 'artifice', 'losing', 'movie', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'particularly', 'deadly', 'respect', 'Only', 'quot', 'true', 'quot', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'rest', 'should', 'settle', 'single-disc', 'version', 'settle', 'version']",N/A

584504,A1PMDTYRAIPGXW,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","Ok, I'll admit it, I'm probably going to be crucified for this review because I've talked to people who are AMAZINGLY against this movie, but then again, there were people who agreed with my point of view about it.THAT BEING SAID, I HATED this movie the first time I watched it, because it was a little slow for my taste, the Origin wasn't the same as the ORIGINAL Hulk origin, and there was just a whole lot of OVERACTING by Nick Nolte.Then I watched it again.  The Origin aspect... It still gnawed at me a bit, but I thought about how he &quot;originally&quot; turned into the hulk, and it really doesn't make sense.  He would have been disintigrated by the Gamma Bomb, and that's not going to help make a somewhat believable movie.  So the origin change seemed at least... FEASIBLE.  I talked to someone else who said it should have been some &quot;new bomb&quot; but...  I think that still causes some issues...The SLOW factor.  Well, yes, it's slow.  But if you think back on most of the Comic based movies, they're kind of slow because they take time to show the true origin of the character, give you an idea of who they are, and what they do.  The Hulk is supposed to be a &quot;brainless wrecking ball&quot; and it's kind of hard to devise a 2 hour plot around him smashing stuff (or you'd have Fast and the Furious 3 mixed with a giant green monster).  You have to have some understanding of who Bruce Banner is, and why he became what he became.  So I understand the need for the pace being the way it was.  I'm expecting that they'll have a much faster paced sequel (if rumor turns out to be true) because you don't have to worry as much about character introduction, and can get into the &quot;hulk smash&quot; more without explaining how the Hulk happened.Then the final complaint.  The Nick Nolte factor.  Round two of watching this movie didn't help this issue at all.  In fact, it made it worse.  Every scene that Nolte was in was literally painful to watch because he overacted so much it seemed like he was TRYING to overact that badly.  It seemed like he was trying to make soap opera acting look good, or possibly he was just trying to make sure that no one ever takes him seriously again.  Either way, I had trouble watching his scenes, and seriously wish they would have re-considered casting someone or anyone else in the part.In conclusion, the general story wasn't bad, the thought process of the director seemed to be in the right place, and my only other little complaint may be that the Hulk as a character, seemed a bit too intelligent for my thinking, though, the comic book Hulk has gone through many different levels of intelligence and or mental capabilities and this is comparably a moot issue if comparing it to how poorly Nolte's performance was.Check it out if you haven't seen it, it's not bad, but don't expect it to be the comic book you remembered from the 60's exactly.  It makes a little more sense than the original origin, so THUMBS UP for that...",3,Would have been 4 if not for Nolte's HACK ACTING,1084320000,"05 12, 2004",2004,2993,"['Ok', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'crucified', 'review', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'AMAZINGLY', 'movie', 'then', 'again', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'agreed', 'point', 'view', 'it.THAT', 'BEING', 'SAID', 'HATED', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'taste', 'Origin', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'ORIGINAL', 'Hulk', 'origin', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'whole', 'lot', 'OVERACTING', 'Nick', 'Nolte.Then', 'watched', 'again', 'Origin', 'aspect', 'still', 'gnawed', 'bit', 'thought', 'about', 'how', 'quot', 'originally', 'quot', 'turned', 'hulk', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disintigrated', 'Gamma', 'Bomb', 'not', 'going', 'help', 'make', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'movie', 'origin', 'change', 'seemed', 'least', 'FEASIBLE', 'talked', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'said', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'quot', 'new', 'bomb', 'quot', 'think', 'still', 'issues', 'SLOW', 'factor', 'Well', 'yes', 'slow', 'think', 'back', 'most', 'Comic', 'based', 'movies', ""'re"", 'kind', 'slow', 'take', 'time', 'show', 'true', 'origin', 'character', 'give', 'idea', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'do', 'Hulk', 'supposed', 'be', 'quot', 'wrecking', 'ball', 'quot', 'kind', 'hard', 'devise', '2', 'hour', 'plot', 'smashing', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'have', 'Fast', 'Furious', '3', 'mixed', 'giant', 'green', 'monster', 'have', 'have', 'understanding', 'who', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'why', 'became', 'what', 'became', 'understand', 'need', 'pace', 'being', 'way', 'was', ""'m"", 'expecting', ""'ll"", 'have', 'much', 'faster', 'paced', 'sequel', 'rumor', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'introduction', 'can', 'get', 'quot', 'smash', 'quot', 'more', 'explaining', 'how', 'Hulk', 'happened.Then', 'final', 'complaint', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'factor', 'Round', 'two', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'issue', 'fact', 'made', 'worse', 'scene', 'Nolte', 'was', 'was', 'literally', 'painful', 'watch', 'overacted', 'so', 'much', 'seemed', 'was', 'TRYING', 'overact', 'badly', 'seemed', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'soap', 'acting', 'look', 'good', 'possibly', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', 'one', 'ever', 'seriously', 'again', 'way', 'had', 'trouble', 'watching', 'scenes', 'seriously', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 're-considered', 'casting', 'someone', 'anyone', 'else', 'part.In', 'conclusion', 'general', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thought', 'process', 'director', 'seemed', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'only', 'other', 'little', 'complaint', 'may', 'be', 'Hulk', 'character', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'intelligent', 'thinking', 'though', 'comic', 'book', 'Hulk', 'gone', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'intelligence', 'mental', 'capabilities', 'comparably', 'moot', 'issue', 'comparing', 'how', 'poorly', 'Nolte', 'performance', 'was.Check', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'not', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'comic', 'book', 'remembered', '60', 'exactly', 'little', 'more', 'sense', 'original', 'origin', 'so', 'THUMBS', 'UP']",N/A

584506,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","Pirates of the Caribbean was the most disappointing film of summer 2003 because it promised more fun than it actually delivered. The Hulk comes in a close second because its pedigree (from the cast to director Ang Lee) would seemingly indicate we'd get a film that's far superior to the final cut of this horribly overlong clunker.Maybe the Hulk was never suited for big screen material, but it's more likely Ang Lee just mucked up the execution. He clearly wants to inject his films with the deeper meaning, to question and explore the very psyche of the film's protagonist, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Truth be told, I'm not partial to this approach, but I could grudgingly accept it if delivered and executed competently. It's not.From the dull performances to the pretentious tone, Hulk consistently does little more than make the viewer every bit as angry as the green beast himself, only because one was foolish enough to actually fork over some hard-earned cash to see the film.Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that Lee wants to put characters over action, an approach that has constantly appealed to me, but there's a catch here; not one single character is likeable and/or sympathetic. Bana is a decent actor, but he radiates zero screen presence or charisma as Banner, I neither felt nor cared for his supposed mental and physical anguish.As his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly is even less convincing, resorting to little more than shedding tears when the situation goes awry. Connelly is one of those actresses whose marked improvements over the years (she was an awful actress from the mid-80's to early 90's) has impressed me, but this is her worst performance in years. In other supporting roles, Josh Lucas is okay but perfunctorily one-dimensional as the villain, and Sam Elliot does his gruff thing yet again, and it's not nearly as amusing here as it was in We Were Soldiers (where much of it was played for laughs; he's deadly serious here). Nick Nolte is hilariously over-the-top as mad scientist Bruce Banner, it'd be amusing if it wasn't so earnest.The movie as a whole is about anger, that seething, boiling rage lurking under the surface just waiting for the catalyst that'll unleash its ugly face. There is, unfortunately, only so much a film of this sort can do to deal with such a topic, and it doesn't even maximize such potential during the action sequences.The Hulk (the big man himself) is a passable special effect, better than you'd expect, but not as good as you'd hope for, and while the green lug does get in a few pretty cool moments (leaping around the desert, for instance), he's utterly wasted in this movie's few paltry action sequences. There's a general rule of thumb of mine that any superhero action movie should pit our hero against stronger villains (a rule the recent X2 also broke). Not the case here, where most of Hulk's fighting is against the U.S. military. This is without mentioning that the Hulk not only has super strength and super agility, he's also practically invulnerable to harm because of a quick healing factor; a hero who virtually can't die? Bye-bye, suspense.The one scene where the Hulk does fight someone with superior powers to his own is set in the dark, and I could barely make anything out during this battle, which hardly lasts past a minute and is wholly anti-climactic compared to the slightly more engaging Hulk vs. the military confrontation.Danny Elfman's horrible score rounds out the rest of this lackluster picture. It's a rip-off of his own work in Spider-Man, which itself was a rip-off of his superior work in Batman. Lesson to Elfman: a score of this style won't work for every superhero.Ang Lee crafts the film with a &quot;wink-wink&quot;-style camerawork, splicing in lots of comic-book style scene transitions, reminding viewers they are indeed watching an adaptation of a popular comic book. Not only are the transitions themselves annoying, but they're a persistent reminder of how much more fun it would be to actually skim through an issue of the Hulk than to actually watch this film.",2,A massive clunker.,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,4089,"['Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'was', 'most', 'disappointing', 'film', 'summer', '2003', 'promised', 'more', 'fun', 'actually', 'delivered', 'Hulk', 'close', 'second', 'pedigree', 'cast', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'would', 'seemingly', 'indicate', ""'d"", 'get', 'film', 'far', 'superior', 'final', 'cut', 'horribly', 'overlong', 'clunker.Maybe', 'Hulk', 'was', 'never', 'suited', 'big', 'screen', 'material', 'more', 'likely', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'just', 'mucked', 'up', 'execution', 'clearly', 'inject', 'films', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'question', 'explore', 'very', 'psyche', 'film', 'protagonist', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', ""'m"", 'not', 'partial', 'approach', 'could', 'grudgingly', 'accept', 'delivered', 'executed', 'competently', 'dull', 'performances', 'pretentious', 'tone', 'Hulk', 'consistently', 'little', 'more', 'make', 'viewer', 'bit', 'as', 'angry', 'green', 'beast', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'foolish', 'enough', 'actually', 'fork', 'hard-earned', 'cash', 'see', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Lee', 'put', 'characters', 'action', 'approach', 'constantly', 'appealed', 'catch', 'here', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'character', 'likeable', 'and/or', 'sympathetic', 'Bana', 'decent', 'actor', 'zero', 'screen', 'presence', 'charisma', 'Banner', 'neither', 'felt', 'cared', 'supposed', 'mental', 'physical', 'anguish.As', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'even', 'less', 'convincing', 'resorting', 'little', 'more', 'shedding', 'tears', 'when', 'situation', 'awry', 'Connelly', 'one', 'actresses', 'marked', 'improvements', 'years', 'was', 'awful', 'actress', 'mid-80', 'early', '90', 'impressed', 'worst', 'performance', 'years', 'other', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'okay', 'perfunctorily', 'one-dimensional', 'villain', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'gruff', 'thing', 'yet', 'again', 'not', 'nearly', 'amusing', 'here', 'was', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'where', 'much', 'was', 'played', 'laughs', 'deadly', 'serious', 'here', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'hilariously', 'over-the-top', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Bruce', 'Banner', ""'d"", 'be', 'amusing', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'earnest.The', 'movie', 'whole', 'anger', 'seething', 'boiling', 'rage', 'lurking', 'surface', 'just', 'waiting', 'catalyst', ""'ll"", 'unleash', 'ugly', 'face', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'sort', 'can', 'do', 'deal', 'topic', ""n't"", 'even', 'maximize', 'such', 'potential', 'action', 'sequences.The', 'Hulk', 'big', 'man', 'passable', 'special', 'effect', 'better', ""'d"", 'expect', 'not', 'as', 'good', ""'d"", 'hope', 'green', 'lug', 'get', 'few', 'pretty', 'cool', 'moments', 'leaping', 'desert', 'instance', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'movie', 'few', 'paltry', 'action', 'sequences', 'general', 'rule', 'thumb', 'mine', 'superhero', 'action', 'movie', 'should', 'pit', 'hero', 'stronger', 'villains', 'rule', 'recent', 'X2', 'also', 'broke', 'Not', 'case', 'here', 'where', 'most', 'Hulk', 'fighting', 'U.S.', 'military', 'mentioning', 'Hulk', 'not', 'only', 'super', 'strength', 'super', 'agility', 'also', 'practically', 'invulnerable', 'harm', 'quick', 'healing', 'factor', 'hero', 'who', 'virtually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'die', 'Bye-bye', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Hulk', 'fight', 'someone', 'superior', 'powers', 'own', 'set', 'dark', 'could', 'barely', 'make', 'anything', 'out', 'battle', 'hardly', 'minute', 'wholly', 'anti-climactic', 'compared', 'slightly', 'more', 'engaging', 'Hulk', 'military', 'confrontation.Danny', 'Elfman', 'horrible', 'score', 'out', 'rest', 'lackluster', 'picture', 'rip-off', 'own', 'work', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'rip-off', 'superior', 'work', 'Batman', 'Lesson', 'Elfman', 'score', 'style', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'superhero.Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'quot', 'wink-wink', 'quot', '-style', 'camerawork', 'splicing', 'lots', 'comic-book', 'style', 'scene', 'transitions', 'reminding', 'viewers', 'are', 'indeed', 'watching', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'comic', 'book', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'transitions', 'annoying', ""'re"", 'persistent', 'reminder', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'would', 'be', 'actually', 'skim', 'issue', 'Hulk', 'actually', 'watch', 'film']",N/A
584507,A3KKPVZ2EQQLAB,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","&quot;Hulk&quot; is easily the most boring action movie ever made. The idea of this film is to delve into the deep recesses of Bruce Banner's mind, to find out why he is so angry, and he goes so green all the time. I can see how director Ang Lee was trying to bring more humanity into the comic book story, but I don't think this is why people came to see the movie. They wanted to see destruction and large green men throwing temper tantrums because daddy was mean to mommy.As far as the CG for the Hulk, I felt that he always managed to look like something made of Play-Dough instead of a menacing creature. And it takes over an hour before we actually get to see the Hulk, and his screen time is limited to under 20 minutes in a action movie about him that is two hours long. Before this film was made, they should have checked and made sure that they could make a Hulk that looked realistic than the one they came up with. Old Lou Feringo would have looked more menacing than this cute beast they came up with. And since when can Hulk fly?The acting here is not bad, for the most part, as all the secondary characters play their poorly written parts as decently as could be expected. The worst acting in the film is by Bruce Banner himself, as he comes across as creepy when we should be feeling bad for him, and funny when we should be scared of him. Eric Bana has done well in films before, but he cannot carry one all by himself.And one last thing: the end battle here is probably the worst one I have seen since &quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot; came out and used some archaic claymation techniques. Nobody can really tell what is going on, but it matter not, because by this point you will be so bored that your brain will be dripping out of your ears, and you will only want the film to end. &quot;Hulk&quot; definitely earns a well-deserved spot on my ten-worst movies of all time list.",1,almost as bad as Daredevil,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,1903,"['quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'easily', 'most', 'boring', 'action', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'idea', 'film', 'delve', 'deep', 'recesses', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'mind', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'angry', 'so', 'green', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'was', 'trying', 'bring', 'more', 'humanity', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'why', 'people', 'came', 'see', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'destruction', 'large', 'green', 'men', 'throwing', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'daddy', 'was', 'mean', 'mommy.As', 'far', 'CG', 'Hulk', 'felt', 'always', 'managed', 'look', 'something', 'made', 'Play-Dough', 'instead', 'menacing', 'creature', 'hour', 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'Hulk', 'screen', 'time', 'limited', '20', 'minutes', 'action', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'should', 'have', 'checked', 'made', 'sure', 'could', 'make', 'Hulk', 'looked', 'realistic', 'one', 'came', 'up', 'Old', 'Lou', 'Feringo', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'more', 'menacing', 'cute', 'beast', 'came', 'up', 'when', 'can', 'Hulk', 'fly', 'acting', 'here', 'not', 'bad', 'most', 'part', 'secondary', 'characters', 'play', 'poorly', 'written', 'parts', 'as', 'decently', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'worst', 'acting', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'creepy', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'bad', 'funny', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'scared', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'done', 'well', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'one', 'himself.And', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'end', 'battle', 'here', 'probably', 'worst', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'quot', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'Annihilation', 'quot', 'came', 'out', 'used', 'archaic', 'claymation', 'techniques', 'Nobody', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'matter', 'not', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'bored', 'brain', 'will', 'be', 'dripping', 'ears', 'will', 'only', 'want', 'film', 'end', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'definitely', 'well-deserved', 'spot', 'ten-worst', 'movies', 'time', 'list']",N/A
584508,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","The Hulk is a bad movie.  It has all the necessary elements to be good, but instead it goes awry in a number of ways.  The special effects are good, but overused, the cast is effective, but campy.  The story follows the original in a way, but doesn't realize that the material needs to be lighter in nature.  In short, this is a misfire that results from everything being just a little off.David Banner (Nick Nolte) has a son, Bruce whom he injects with a chemical he is working on that is supposed to allow him to fix himself when hurt or regenerate limbs he loses.  Later, he is fired from his job in the military, and sets off a nuclear explosion.  His son is home and survives the blast.  Later he is exposed to a large amount of gamma radiation and develops the ability to turn into the hulk when provoked to great anger.There's much to get upset about.  His ex girlfriend (Jennifer Connoley) still works with him in the lab (he does the same thing his father used to do)  Her father (Sam Elliott) was the man who fired David all those years ago.  Now he wants to use the Hulk as a military weapon.  Throw in Josh Lucas as a two fold jerk.  He not only wants to date Connoley, but he wants to use the DNA of the Hulk to develop his own creature for his company.The CGI version of the Hulk is almost humorously campy.  He leaps all over the place and destroys buildings like they're not even there.  This would not be so bad if it were not so obvious that it is fake.  I will give the creature this.  It looks more like a mutant than the original series, which simply featured Lou Ferrigno with green paint.  The problem comes from the fake look of the action.  Also, director Ang Lee looks at this material all wrong.  Instead of it being a fun, entertaining look at a fantasy hero, this film is sullen and serious.  Nick Nolte's speech at the end is so over the top it's amazing.  Lee's previous &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; could have been more serious, but ended up being light and amusing.  This is awful.  Compare it to SpiderMan and you'll see what I mean.Finally, the movie is way too long.  This should have been 100 minutes tops, not 140.  It takes us 45 minutes to meet the Hulk.  Why show us a helicopter flying Bruce to the lab for 3-4 minutes?  I'm serious.  The helicopter just flies along.  Why?  At 100 minutes this would have been tight and watchable.  As it is, you'll barely make it to the finish.  The Hulk could have been really good.

It's entertaining if you don't take it too seriously.  Scientist, David Banner, located in a desert military base uses himself in a regeneration experiment not designed for human testing.  In the process he genetically passes on his altered DNA to his son Bruce.  As an adult Bruce is exposed to gamma rays which set off his already mutilated genes.  A complicated life is revealed piece by piece to Bruce (Eric Bana) as he struggles to understand what is happening to him.  As the Hulk, Bruce Banner's strength increases with his anger.  He can reach the heights of 9, 12 and 15 feet tall; he can lift 100 tons, run 300 miles per hour, and jump 3 or 4 miles in a single leap.  In addition, he has the ability to regenerate and repair himself from any sort of physical trauma.  He's the perfect weapon everyone wants to possess.There are some animal testing scenes that may not go over well.  Some scenes may be a little ""nightmarish"" for small children.

584513,A23PBS4Z4028XQ,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 0]","This is not your standard super-hero movie, so be warned. It's like King Kong and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde mixed together rather than a film like Spider-Man or Daredevil. In some ways, it's similar to the first Tim Burton Batman film as it's just as much about a warped relationship between the lead characters as it is about bringing a comic book character to life on the screen. If you want a by-the-numbers comic book movie, then you might be disappointed (but certainly not during the action scenes, which are awesome)...but if you approach this movie with an open mind, you may very well find yourself really appreciating this movie more than you would other standard ""super-hero"" films.The editing is amazing in this film. This is probably the closest audiences will ever get to seeing a comic book ""look"" translated to the screen. The film attempts to mimic comic book-style framing and succeeds beyond all expectations. It's not confusing at all, and the filmmakers show an understanding of comic book storytelling and adapt it for the big screen flawlessly. The viewer is aware of the editing, but at no point does it derail the story that's being told, which is exactly the aim of the best creators in comics.The CGI work is some of the best ever seen in movies. Not only does the Hulk look realistic and well integrated into the shots, but he also emerges as a character in his own right. The work done by ILM is groundbreaking stuff.As for the performances, Eric Bana is fine as Bruce Banner as is Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross. However, the two standout performances come from veteran actors Sam Elliot (one of my favourite actors...always dependable and likeable) as Betty's father, General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross and Nick Nolte in a larger-than-life performance as David Banner. Nolte has been criticised by some who say that he's overacting, but he's playing a guy who is a few sandwhiches short of a picnic basket even though he's a brilliant scientist.As for the DVD presentation, I marked this down one star because of the extra features. It's not that what's on offer is not enjoyable, but when compared to what's found on other similar DVDs, this one could have been better. There are a number of featurettes, but the longest is 25 minutes (the Making Of documentary). The section about the comic book is the most disappointing. No Peter David, who wrote the book for many years and sent it sailing up the sales charts...just a predictable appearance creator Stan Lee. Surely other creators could have been interviewed...? After all, take a look at the similar and far superior comics documentary on the Daredevil DVD. A number of creators are interviewed and we see the evolution of the character throughout the years. The version on the Hulk DVD is little more than a brief overview that contains very little that is interesting or new. Some of the other featurettes repeat stuff like some comments from Danny Elfman and scenes of Ang Lee in his motion capture suit. There are very brief chats with the cast, and I would have liked to have seen more from them, particularly Eric Bana and Nick Nolte. It would've been great to have a cast commentary track, but we only get to hear Ang Lee who often pauses to let the action play out onscreen uninterrupted. Having said that, the extras that have been included are still a welcome addition to the DVD and are informative.I thoroughly recommend purchasing this film on DVD. Great film, excellent video and audio transfer, decent extras...it's well worth adding to your DVD collection.",4,More than just another comic book movie,1067990400,"11 5, 2003",2003,3549,"['not', 'standard', 'super-hero', 'movie', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'King', 'Kong', 'Dr', 'Jekyll', 'Mr', 'Hyde', 'mixed', 'together', 'rather', 'film', 'Spider-Man', 'Daredevil', 'ways', 'similar', 'first', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'warped', 'relationship', 'lead', 'characters', 'bringing', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'life', 'screen', 'want', 'by-the-numbers', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'certainly', 'not', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'awesome', 'approach', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'find', 'really', 'appreciating', 'movie', 'more', 'would', 'other', 'standard', 'super-hero', 'films.The', 'editing', 'amazing', 'film', 'probably', 'closest', 'audiences', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'seeing', 'comic', 'book', 'look', 'translated', 'screen', 'film', 'attempts', 'mimic', 'comic', 'book-style', 'framing', 'expectations', 'not', 'confusing', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'understanding', 'comic', 'book', 'storytelling', 'adapt', 'big', 'screen', 'flawlessly', 'viewer', 'aware', 'editing', 'point', 'derail', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'exactly', 'aim', 'best', 'creators', 'comics.The', 'CGI', 'work', 'best', 'ever', 'seen', 'movies', 'Not', 'only', 'Hulk', 'look', 'realistic', 'well', 'integrated', 'shots', 'also', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'work', 'done', 'ILM', 'groundbreaking', 'stuff.As', 'performances', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'fine', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'However', 'two', 'standout', 'performances', 'come', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'one', 'favourite', 'actors', 'always', 'dependable', 'likeable', 'Betty', 'father', 'General', 'Thunderbolt', 'Ross', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'larger-than-life', 'performance', 'David', 'Banner', 'Nolte', 'been', 'criticised', 'who', 'say', 'overacting', 'playing', 'guy', 'who', 'few', 'sandwhiches', 'short', 'picnic', 'basket', 'even', 'brilliant', 'scientist.As', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'marked', 'down', 'one', 'star', 'extra', 'features', 'not', 'what', 'offer', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'when', 'compared', 'what', 'found', 'other', 'similar', 'DVDs', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'number', 'featurettes', 'longest', '25', 'minutes', 'Making', 'documentary', 'section', 'comic', 'book', 'most', 'disappointing', 'Peter', 'David', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'many', 'years', 'sent', 'sailing', 'up', 'sales', 'charts', 'just', 'predictable', 'appearance', 'creator', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Surely', 'other', 'creators', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interviewed', 'take', 'look', 'similar', 'far', 'superior', 'comics', 'documentary', 'Daredevil', 'DVD', 'number', 'creators', 'are', 'interviewed', 'see', 'evolution', 'character', 'years', 'version', 'Hulk', 'DVD', 'little', 'more', 'brief', 'overview', 'very', 'little', 'interesting', 'new', 'other', 'featurettes', 'repeat', 'stuff', 'comments', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'scenes', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'motion', 'capture', 'suit', 'are', 'very', 'brief', 'chats', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'particularly', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'have', 'cast', 'commentary', 'track', 'only', 'get', 'hear', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'who', 'often', 'let', 'action', 'play', 'out', 'onscreen', 'uninterrupted', 'Having', 'said', 'extras', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'are', 'still', 'welcome', 'addition', 'DVD', 'are', 'informative.I', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'film', 'DVD', 'Great', 'film', 'excellent', 'video', 'audio', 'transfer', 'decent', 'extras', 'well', 'worth', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

Still, it does work when you see the creature close up. Also, people complained that they wanted a real actor to do the Hulk but I take a bit of an exception to that. If you are going to have the comic book Hulk, then NO ACTOR could do that! Not even Lou Ferrigno in his prime could've done the things that the comic book Hulk does and make it look believable! I will give Ang points for having the guts to go the CG route.THE CASTEric Bana is an okay Bruce Banner (though the best will always be the late Bill Bixby on the TV series). Jennifer Connelly is great as Betty Ross while Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte are awesome as General Ross and David Banner respectively!THE STORYOkay but average. Could've been shorten in some spots but go longer in others. Best scene is near the end when David and Bruce square off at the army base.OVERALL VIEWI think this film could've been better but it gets slammed more than it deserves. It wasn't THAT bad. Also, its a victim of the Spider-Man craze! While I loved Spider-Man, many people have this stigma that every Marvel based film should be like Spider-Man (though the X-Men films doesn't seem to suffer from this stigma). I think that's so bull! Hulk ISN'T MEANT TO BE SPIDER-MAN! They are two totally different characters in totally different worlds and any comparison as far as characters and their worlds is ridiculous! As far as story development and pacing, Spider-Man is a far better story without a doubt but Hulk is meant to be a psychological story so it is going to be slow in some spots (I just feel that they dragged too long in some spots, even for a psychological story). It isn't just about a man who changes into a monster. Its about a man dealing with his inner rage and psychological trama and his search for peace.

584534,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JKC3,,"[0, 1]","I grew up reading all of the major (and most of the minor) Marvel comics titles of the 1960s and '70s... In the '80s, I drifted away, at first because the various titles had become so static and shoddy, and then later because the artwork had become so stylized and fetishistic.  By the 1990s, Marvel began to radically overhaul all its main titles, and the Hulk was one of the characters that they messed with the most. Because I never liked the hyper-realistic, overly muscular, overly defined artwork that came into vogue around this time, I was driven away from many titles. ""The Hulk"" in particular, started to have about a zillion rippling muscles that just don't exist outside of a bodybuilder's wet dream.  Still, every few months or so I would pick one up and see what was happening, and for a while I was able to keep up... I gather that around this time was when they introduced the goofy psychoanalitic aspects that define the screenplay of this film: all Hulk's problems stem from a bad relationship to his Daddy. (In the comic, the theme of domestic violence was much stronger and heavy-handed than in this film...)Anyway, as a Marvel loyalist, I've always checked out the various film adaptations, and while Hollywood invariably fouls things up somehow, I have to say, I was more impressed by this film than I thought I would be.  The special effects are fabulous -- I actually watched several of the action scenes over before returning the rental, and if I were still nine years old, I probably would have gone to see this movie in the theatres at least a dozen times. Why they have to muck with the original premises of these stories, I really dunno (the Hulk is no longer the product of an atomic bomb, but rather some sort of genetic testing...) but in general, as these things go, this flick was pretty good.  Mostly I am cheered by seeing such good, exciting special effects, onscreen action that finally matches the sense of wonder that the old Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comics could instill. My hope is that Hollywood will one day start cranking these things out with almost as much regularity as the comicbook industry itself, and as the making of these fantasy films becomes more commonplace, producers will eventually stop feeling the need to ""legitimize"" then by making the plots so overly complex and drearily serious.

I had blocked out the movie on the inbound trip with music, but I settled back to watch this, thinking it would provide some solid, if cheap, entertainment.It did, and it didn't.The superhero drama has always been associated (in my mind, and I think in general) with an upbeat, wholesome sort of ethos; everything is reduced to a black-and-white struggle between good and evil, and good almost always triumphs. The 'Spiderman' movie is the perfect example of this. I guess I should have kept in mind that the Hulk has always deviated somewhat from the formula, and this director takes that deviation to the extreme.The plot of the movie is governed by Bruce Banner's father, a psychotic and manipulative scientist who completely surpasses the bounds of 'acceptable' mad science (not the elegant, plot-to-destroy-the-world type, but a total nut job). Banner suffers from a repressed childhood memory involving his father and mother, and its nature, when revealed, is about as unpleasant as you would have imagined. I'm not one to fault a movie for being distrubing - generally, I would enjoy it - but it seems so out of place here, in a movie where the other main atraction is a series of mindless fight scenes in which a giant green CGI-generated man does battle with the US Army. Another fight scene, more on the disturbing side, involves three truly grotesque genetically modified dogs, and it takes the Hulk _forever_ to pummel and beat them into submission. I don't know why I found this so disturbing, but I did. Aside from that incongruity, which I would consider a weakness, there are no really solid performances, and bits of cinemetogrpahic flair like overly-elaborate scene transistions seem completley unnecesary.

I had hoped that Hollywood would be able to make a smooth transformation of the HULK to the big screen, but my hopes were dashed by this debacle.It is granted that the Hulk portrayed in this film bears a far closer resemblance to the comic book hero than did the 1970s TV series starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno(sp?).  The Hulk really was supposed to be gigantic &amp; not just a body builder in green paint.However, the present film lacks the heart of the 1970s TV series.  In sum, I did not care nearly so much about this Banner  / Hulk as I did for the ones depicted in the 1970s.  It is this lack of heart that contributes to this movie's ultimate demise.In all Superhero movies, one of the biggest obstacles to delivering a quality movie is coming up with a cohesive plot that will take a few hours to display.  On that point, this film failed utterly.  To be sure, it was all fine &amp; well (not to mention great fun!) to see the Hulk abducted by the army and have to fight his way out of their gauntlet.Beyond that, however, the plot of the film fizzles out.  The ending seems to be more tacked on than anything else - like they couldn't think of anything better to do before running the credits.  There is no internal friction or arch villain for the Hulk to take on.The direction style is also in the realm of the bizarre.  They keep on showing frame-in-frame footage that (ostensibly?) is supposed to depict a comic book style.  Instead of being innovative or adding anything to the movie, it comes off as tiresome and confusing.  The director of the film should get no brownie points for that hare-brained idea!There are two redeemable variables in this movie:  the eye-candy special effects &amp; Jennifer Connolley.  The special effects are fun to watch and do not disappoint.  Jennifer Connolley is both drop-dead gorgeous + she's a fine actress.  However, not even Connolley can save this movie.So, with that in mind, if you're interested in seeing a good portrayal of the Hulk character, pick up the pilot &amp; other episodes of the 1970s television show.

There are no pretentions that The Hulk is a real thing. it is a huge, pastel coloured blur of action and anger that is a joy to watch when he is smashing something, and is actually quite scary when he and his alter ego Bruce Banner meet for the first time. Ang Lee makes the movie run like a comic book narrative, with cool shifts in view and frame movement, a type of structure that serves to keep the movie going when the Hulk is not on screen.Secondly, there is a genuine issue at the bottom of this movie. HULK deals with psychological issues like childhood trauma, with the Hulk being Bruce Banner's outward expression of the traumas within him, the way teenagers often have an outward persona when their lives have been troubled. The issues are dealt with before the action, and the reason people did not like this aspect is because they were afraid to THINK before things start to explode.And they do explode. there is plenty of smashing and bashing in the final parts of the film for any popcorn fan, so much so it even gets a bit confusing towards the end. but tell me that the site of the Hulk catching a missile and throwing it back at the gunship that fired it is not cool and i will turn green and pulp your head, puny human.it is let down by a pretty boring performance from Eric Bana that had me wishing they had gotten Steve Buscemi for the role of Bruce, but other than that, irradiate your screen with this and Marvel at how good it is.",4,Hulk Smash Boundaries of Comic Book Movies!!!!,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,1907,"['People', 'fear', 'change', 'nothing', 'new', 'just', 'look', 'resistance', 'put', 'up', 'when', 'women', 'wanted', 'equal', 'rights', 'race', 'riots', 'years', 'gone', 'past', 'so', 'when', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'deal', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'solved', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'well', 'not', 'time', 'anyway', 'people', 'reject', 'it.This', 'case', 'HULK', 'possibly', 'most', 'ambitious', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'cinema', 'history.Firstly', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'are', 'pretentions', 'Hulk', 'real', 'thing', 'huge', 'pastel', 'coloured', 'blur', 'action', 'anger', 'joy', 'watch', 'when', 'smashing', 'something', 'actually', 'quite', 'scary', 'when', 'alter', 'ego', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'movie', 'run', 'comic', 'book', 'narrative', 'cool', 'shifts', 'view', 'frame', 'movement', 'type', 'structure', 'keep', 'movie', 'going', 'when', 'Hulk', 'not', 'screen.Secondly', 'genuine', 'issue', 'bottom', 'movie', 'HULK', 'deals', 'psychological', 'issues', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'Hulk', 'being', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'outward', 'expression', 'traumas', 'way', 'teenagers', 'often', 'have', 'outward', 'persona', 'when', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'troubled', 'issues', 'are', 'dealt', 'action', 'reason', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'aspect', 'were', 'afraid', 'THINK', 'things', 'start', 'explode.And', 'do', 'explode', 'plenty', 'smashing', 'bashing', 'final', 'parts', 'film', 'popcorn', 'fan', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'bit', 'confusing', 'end', 'tell', 'site', 'Hulk', 'catching', 'missile', 'throwing', 'back', 'gunship', 'fired', 'not', 'cool', 'i', 'will', 'turn', 'green', 'pulp', 'head', 'puny', 'human.it', 'let', 'down', 'pretty', 'boring', 'performance', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'had', 'wishing', 'had', 'gotten', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'role', 'Bruce', 'other', 'irradiate', 'screen', 'Marvel', 'how', 'good']",N/A

A friend of his, but then gets in the way and Bruce moves him out of the way and gets hit by the ""GammaRay"". Bruce's dad has been giving him shots since he was a baby for he could be protected by any government experiments. Then the rage is released, so then every time Bruce gets annoyed, he becomes this ferocious Monster. The government then wants the Hulk for they could do testing on him and stuff. It is a real knockout. Not better than &quot;Spiderman&quot;, but is still really cool.This 2 disc set includes behind the scenes on the amazing &quot;Dog Fight&quot; scene. It also includes deleted scenes that actually should have been taken out. It also has an interview with Stan Lee, which is pretty funny. It also has full-length commentary by Ang Lee. He is a weird choice to direct this film, but still pulls it off. Going from &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot;, to a action packed film! The weird thing that this DVD didn't have but should've, was the teaser that they showed before showing the film &quot;Spiderman&quot; in the theater.

It's nothing personal: I just have not been exposed to them.  Therefore, my perspective on this film is one of an ""outsider"" to the series.  I'll be honest.  There were some ""fun"" moments in HULK.  I enjoyed the split-screens and felt that they helped deliver a ""comic-book-feel"" to the big screen.  Moreover, I really enjoyed the scenes in which the Hulk comes alive.  The special effects are very cool and I think we all want to see Hulk kick some butt every once in a while.However, there were also some ""not so fun"" moments.  Unfortunately, while the storyline had more interest in it than I had expected, it still suffered from a lack of good acting and the lack of a good script.  Whenever the Hulk is not rampaging on the screen, the film seems doomed to feel like a B-movie.  I enjoyed Nolte's performance, but his seriousness seems to strike an awkward chord against the ridiculous cast that supports him.  So, what is the solution?  Give us more scenes of the Hulk blowing stuff up.  That's the main interest that lies in this film and it is the only card it has to play.While many reviewers have attacked those of us who call for more action, their attacks have not been well played.  IF, and I do mean if, HULK would have served up an intriguing storyline, superb character development, and thrilling acting performances, I would not need the extra senseless violence.

No plot whatsoever), in hopes that it would wash the b-""bad""-movie from my mind. But that's besides the point. Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a pointless movie all to begin with. It feels more like a sleepy-time drama full would-be-angst, silly flashbacks. Coupled with cold and heartless acting, it gives you feeling of a OVERHYPED foreign (and non-foreign) movies on the Independence Channel. But the overall action made it watchable.On the plus side there's one humorous scene in the movie, concerning Bruce Banner (Erica Bana --- see a resemblance in the names?) so called ""love-rival"" named ""Talbot"" played by Josh Lucas (for Jennifer Connely's character ""Betty Ross"" daughter of Major Ross - Sam Elliott) when he tries to kill the recently transformed Hulk-Banner with a missile launcher but it backfires on him . . . literally AND he get's flambed. I laughed so hard at that scene.Now, I've read the Hulk comic books (granted they were angsty at times, but full as well as entertaining), they had more a plot than this movie that does no justice to Stan Lee's comic. It felt like the movie tried to hard to give the Hulk's character some type of depth concerning his past as child, his father Brian Banner (Nick Nolte) and his would be chemistry between his former girlfriend Betty Ross after they broke up if I remember correctly. It wasn't a bad movie, it just felt like it tired to hard to be serious and action film based around the incredible Hulk.

The story dragged on for what seemed like a lifetime, and Ang Lee's comic-style editing became annoying after the first few minutes.  The highpoint of the movie is, of course, the Hulk.  If you are blessed with a DVD player, simply skip over the parts that don't include a CGI graphic, and you'll have a good time.  Eric Bana didn't win me over as Bruce Banner, and as much as I enjoy Jennifer Connelly, her Betsy character has the emotion of a stone.  Nick Nolte was also a let-down in this feature.  Sam Elliot was okay, but if you took off his military wear and slapped a cowboy hat on him, you'd think you were watching one of his westerns, which he is so much better in than this creation.The &quot;Hulk&quot; creature was fairly good.  Throughout most of the film, he seems reasonably real-life.  If Ang would've given the CGI monster more screen time, this movie would have been a lot better.  Granted, all he does is smash up things and save a few innocents along the way, but that is so much more interesting than the rest of this story.I'm a big fan of comic book movies, and this is one of my least favorite adaptations.  If Ang Lee would have left out a little more of the &quot;why&quot; Banner ended up as a green crushing machine, and got to the substance of this story, perhaps it would have been a lot better.  Besides, when I think of the Hulk, I think about things getting ripped up and trashed.  This movie, however, spends more time on the woes of child abuse, domestic violence, and genetic testing than our green hero.If you can stay awake through the agonizing dialogue and ever-so-slow pace and actually see CGI Hulk, you may like this movie.

Those that give this film a bad review, I hate to say, just didn't get it. Most movie goers in America just don't understand these types of movies. Genius German director Werner Herzog criticized American audiences for this same reason. Most people went in to see this film thinking it's going to be another corny, up beat, action and humor packed Summer feel-good Superhero film. They were in for a surprise. This film was NOTHING like Spider Man, X-Men, the heinously awful Daredevil, or even the blasphemous marriage of Vampire and &quot;Action-Film&quot; of Blade. This is a deep, dark, introspective psychological drama. If you can't appreciate anything but intense brainless action, the corny humor that ruins most American films, and you wanted a 15 foot green giant to look &quot;real&quot;, than I have news for you... this film is for those of us that can and do appreciate true art. This is the Comic book film for the thinking man and the Artist. However, the action that does take place is breath taking and TASTEFULLY used. Not overused like every other film out there. This is a dramatic, Freudian Monster move. Not a Superhero move at all. If you think it needed more action, and more humor, go satisfy yourself with a tasteless, brainless American cookie cutter movie.In regards to the story, it may be different than the comic because nuclear bombs and desert test sites aren't exactly &quot;current&quot; issues anymore. Genetic research is on the other hand. The rest of the liberties taken with the story aren't really any farther removed than the Bixby/Ferigno TV series. I am a huge fan of the Comic, the series, and yes, this film. I can appreciate each, differences and all, for what they are.As far as the special effects... were you really expecting a GREEN skinned, 15 foot giant to look as real as LIFE? Even in real life the Hulk would look about as surreal as a snowman in the desert. In fact the CGI effects are wonderful. The Hulk is alive. He breathes, moves, and expresses himself like a living being. Even his VEINS throb! By far the most advanced CGI FX to date. Gollumn, who was small and withered will obviously look a bit more believable than a green colored behemoth. It really doesn't take THAT much imagination to believe in the Hulk when you watch this film. The FX are truly that good. I wish I could say the same for the Matrix films, The Mummy, the American Godzilla travesty, and even Spiderman (which I still liked). The split screens and off the wall cinematography is a wet dream to a film buff. I've never seen anything like it before in any film. Again, it's obvious why it would be annoying to some people who just don't get it. Film is supposed to be more than entertainment. It's Art.I'm very pleased with the DVD release.

584586,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JKC3,,"[1, 2]","Ang Lee is a great director...let there be no doubt.  CROUCHING TIGER, ICE STORM, SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY.  All TRULY outstanding films. So it comes as no surprise that he would try to bring greatness to a genre little familiar with greatness...the movie comic / superhero genre.On many levels, Ang Lee did a great thing.  He attempted to REALLY delve into the emotional angst of his characters...to show use in a &quot;believable&quot; manner how Hulk could have come into being.  The opening credits for the movie are great, in my opinion, truly setting a mood while giving us a lot of backstory.  The cinematography and unusual style of fade-in / fade-out that Lee uses throughout are highly suggestive of a comic come to life.  It is a daring movie on many levels and really kept me engaged in the conflicts building up.  I was able to enjoy not just the &quot;superhero level&quot; quandries of the characters, but their human problems as well.However, the movie fails Lee (and vice-versa) in two fatal ways.1)  Lee is obviously a good director of experienced performers.  Think of Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh in CROUCHING TIGER...probably their best work.  Signourney Weaver in ICE STORM.  Great.  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet in SENSE...Oscar nominees.  Lee must establish a wonderful rapport with his experience actors.  In HULK, Nick Nolte is a bit over-the-top but actually quite frightening, and Sam Elliott is at his best.  Jennifer Connolly gives a tortured performance.  But newcomer Eric Bana is just NOT GOOD.  He may look OK for the part, but he brings no emotional heft, no believeability to his role...and that's a REAL problem.  If we don't buy Bruce Banner in all his anguish, we have a hard time making an emotional connection with him.  (To a lesser degree, the inexperienced Josh Lucas is also miscast and unconvincing.)2)  THE SPECIAL EFFECTS STINK!  When I think of the miracle of craft that Gollum is in LORD OF THE RINGS, it is inconceivable to me that the Hulk was allowed to come to an audience looking so totally and completely unconvincing.  There are a few nice moments, such as when a sprinkler system is raining water everywhere, and we see it running off of Hulk.  But I was AWARE of the thought that went into that shot...I was totally removed from the movie.  The worst is when Hulk is prancing around in the desert...oh my God.  '50s era monster movies weren't much worse!!  It is simply impossible to suspend your disbelief as the film nears its climax, and thus the whole contraption falls apart.Ang Lee will no doubt continue to make outstanding films.  He (and we) should just chalk this one up to experience and move on.  If you haven't seen this movie, I can't really think of a compelling reason.  There are more clearly awful movies out there, true, but there is something sad about watching a movie that COULD have been really special fall so short.",3,An honorable failure,1071532800,"12 16, 2003",2003,2902,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'great', 'director', 'let', 'be', 'doubt', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'SENSE', 'amp', 'SENSIBILITY', 'TRULY', 'outstanding', 'films', 'surprise', 'would', 'try', 'bring', 'greatness', 'genre', 'little', 'familiar', 'greatness', 'movie', 'comic', '/', 'superhero', 'genre.On', 'many', 'levels', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'did', 'great', 'thing', 'attempted', 'REALLY', 'delve', 'emotional', 'angst', 'characters', 'show', 'use', 'quot', 'believable', 'quot', 'how', 'Hulk', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'being', 'opening', 'credits', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'opinion', 'truly', 'setting', 'mood', 'giving', 'lot', 'backstory', 'cinematography', 'unusual', 'style', 'fade-in', '/', 'fade-out', 'Lee', 'are', 'highly', 'suggestive', 'comic', 'come', 'life', 'daring', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'really', 'kept', 'engaged', 'conflicts', 'building', 'up', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'not', 'just', 'quot', 'level', 'quot', 'quandries', 'characters', 'human', 'problems', 'well.However', 'movie', 'Lee', 'vice-versa', 'two', 'fatal', 'ways.1', 'Lee', 'obviously', 'good', 'director', 'experienced', 'performers', 'Think', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'CROUCHING', 'TIGER', 'probably', 'best', 'work', 'Signourney', 'Weaver', 'ICE', 'STORM', 'Great', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'SENSE', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Lee', 'must', 'establish', 'wonderful', 'rapport', 'experience', 'actors', 'HULK', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'actually', 'quite', 'frightening', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'best', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'tortured', 'performance', 'newcomer', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'just', 'NOT', 'GOOD', 'may', 'look', 'OK', 'part', 'emotional', 'heft', 'believeability', 'role', 'REAL', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'anguish', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'emotional', 'connection', 'lesser', 'degree', 'inexperienced', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'also', 'miscast', 'unconvincing', '2', 'SPECIAL', 'EFFECTS', 'STINK', 'When', 'think', 'miracle', 'craft', 'Gollum', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'inconceivable', 'Hulk', 'was', 'allowed', 'come', 'audience', 'looking', 'so', 'totally', 'completely', 'unconvincing', 'are', 'few', 'nice', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'sprinkler', 'system', 'raining', 'water', 'everywhere', 'see', 'running', 'off', 'Hulk', 'was', 'AWARE', 'thought', 'went', 'shot', 'was', 'totally', 'removed', 'movie', 'worst', 'when', 'Hulk', 'prancing', 'around', 'desert', 'oh', 'God', 'era', 'monster', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'worse', 'simply', 'impossible', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'film', 'climax', 'thus', 'whole', 'contraption', 'apart.Ang', 'Lee', 'will', 'doubt', 'continue', 'make', 'outstanding', 'films', 'should', 'just', 'chalk', 'one', 'up', 'experience', 'move', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'compelling', 'reason', 'are', 'more', 'clearly', 'awful', 'movies', 'there', 'true', 'something', 'sad', 'watching', 'movie', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'special', 'fall', 'so', 'short']",N/A

584588,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JKC3,,"[1, 2]","Dr. David Banner was a scientist working for the military on a project to create a perfect soldier. But he aspired to improve his own biology and so tested his discoveries on himself. Inadvertently, the resulting cell mutations were passed on to his son, Bruce. 30 years later, Bruce (Eric Bana) is an accomplished biologist himself with no memory of the fate that befell his father when he was a boy. When a lab accident exposes him to heavy doses of gamma radiation, the effect on his already abnormal cells is unlike that of a normal human. When he becomes angry, Bruce is transformed into something possessed of rage  and great strength -a creature that intellect cannot control. When the military learns of Bruce's metamorphosis, it becomes obsessed with destroying this creature whose rage can unleash such terrific destructive forces.&quot;Hulk&quot; is based on the &quot;The Incredible Hulk &quot; Marvel comic books, which were also the basis for the 1970's television series of the same name. I haven't read the comic books, but I saw the television series, and &quot;Hulk&quot; doesn't remind me of it in the least. The comic book and the television series were both episodic, whereas the film has to confine itself to only one story. That, in itself, limits the character of Bruce Banner tremendously. There is some good stuff in this film. The relationship between the father's ambitions and his son's fate is interesting. Eric Bana is well suited to the role of Bruce Banner, but unfortunately he isn't given much to do. The first half of the film has a surprisingly slow pace for an action movie. It lingers on details that really aren't necessary to tell the story. This is not entirely bad, but it is bound to be off-putting to an audience that expects an adrenaline rush, as are the subdued personalities of Bruce Banner and his colleague and love interest Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). The appearance of the Hulk, itself, is problematic. The creature is an entirely digital creation. It doesn't look organic, except perhaps for its face, and it stands nearly three times as tall as an average human. In other words, Hulk's appearance is an obstacle to his credibility. Sometimes his expressive eyes succeed in reminding us that he is a man. At other times, his physique and antics are so spectacular that he loses all connection to humanity, and the audience loses all connection to him. At this point, the film is not succeeding; it looks a lot like one of those old alien invasion movies where the military gangs up on some giant monster from another planet. And &quot;Hulk&quot; falls into the &quot;computer game trap&quot; that so many modern action movies do: The digitally enhanced fight sequences look like a video game instead of like a movie. The present state of digital effects reminds me of the early generations of photographic special effects: hokey. &quot;Hulk&quot; is just a very uneven film. Sometimes it works; sometimes it fails miserably.

584590,A9OVXY24IY777,B00005JKC3,,"[1, 2]","Firstly, let me say that 4 stars does not mean that I watch this movie every night, but my rating represents my overall feelings towards the film and DVD (because we're in the business of rating DVDs here, right?). My guess is also that most of those who reviewed the film had certain expectations that they feel were not met. Well if you knew that it was Ang Lee directing, then I suspect you atleast gave your expectations some thought. Because if you were hoping this movie to resemble a Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Pearl Harbour) picture then you obviously were going to be disappointed. This movie isn't supposed to be like all the other comic book hero remakes.I thought the ACTING was all around good. I really believed Eric Bana in his role, because he isn't playing a cartoon cut-out...he's playing a complex character. I think he handled the inner conflicts and emotions really well. Jennifer Connelly and Sam Shepard are excellent too. You believe right away that Shepard could be a high ranking military official, and yet like in Big Lobowski, he has a twinkle in his eye, and you sense he isn't as ice cold as most movies depict their 'army bad guys' to being. As for Nick Nolte, well, I don't know the last time I saw this guy not look hungover, so I don't think this role was much of a stretch. Anyway, you learn very quickly to dislike him (the character).The CINEMATOGRAPHY was really fascinating at times, and this usually went hand in hand with the excellent Danny Elfman SCORE. Remember, Elfman is the same guy who scored Spiderman. But he's a lot more adventurous this time around. The scenes with the desert landscape, vegetation and close ups of rocks are accompanied by some gorgeous doudouk (Armenian wind instrument) music.The EDITING was totally unique, utilising various types of split screen tricks reminding you of the movie's Comic Book origins. We're not used to this style of scene transitions, so it can feel a bit weird -- I applaud the idea, because of it's originality, but I don't know if I like it. Maybe it's a bit too clever for its own good.The EFFECTS for the Hulk are pretty good. They're better than I expected. But people will disagree. It's inevitable, because nearly every other scene is atleast based on reality, so you instantly notice this big green Hulk in contrast, and are easily tempted to cry foul. The battle in the desert is pretty spectacular though. Great action sequences.DISLIKES: The opening credit sequence - while helpful in explaining the backstory - is about 4 minutes long. I think it could have been rushed along a bit more. The pacing isn't always that comfortable either, but I can see past that. The showdown between father and son makes logical sense to me (in the storytelling sense), but I would have preferred the father to retire from the story earlier on in the movie.The DVD: I liked the Making Ofs, expecially my usual favourites (casting &amp; music/sound). Also, it was amusing to see Ang Lee in the blue suit acting out how he felt the Hulk should move. Good extras. Ang Lee's commentary was low-key, but insightful.The movie didn't do as well at the Box Office as desired (though $130 million US Domestic is hardly a flop), so there are talks of there not being a sequel. But that's fine by me. Why does every movie have to have a sequel? What's wrong with a good idea done once?OVERALL ... Textured. Unexpected. Emotional. I find it hard to sum up. It's Ang Lee, so it's not going to float everyone's boat. But I'm a fairly non-superficial guy, and I liked that this film, the story, the characters, the dynamics between the characters, that all of this was not shallow. It has a soul.

584592,AK81WLVD5KGUX,B00005JKC3,,"[1, 2]","I'm not sure why this movie has taken such a pasting. I think it's a fine screen adaptation of the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby Marvel comic. (But it's not very much like the TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, so maybe that's why it's getting such negative reactions.)For comic-book geeks like me who were born in the early 1960s and grew up reading Marvel Comics (waaaaay cooler than DC), the last decade or so has been like a wet dream come true. Finally, the geeks have grown up and figured out ways to make possible _on the screen_ what those writers and artists used to do _on the page_. And filmmakers have already driven the Superman and Batman franchises into the ground, so they're finally getting around to the _good_ comics.Well, it's going to take some doing to beat the X-Men and Spider-Man films, and I don't think this one is _quite_ up to that level. But I can't imagine why any reader of the Hulk comics would find it disappointing.Stan Lee _always_ envisioned the Hulk as a combination of Jekyll/Hyde and Frankenstein. _Both_ of those stories are dark tales of scientific hubris and the horror it can wreak.This screenplay and Ang Lee's direction take this film in precisely that direction (with some nanotech updates), and _of course_ the introductory exposition and development take some time. I don't think it's overlong; I think it's just right. (Granted, if you popped in the DVD just to watch an angry guy turn green, you may be a little impatient. But I don't see that as Ang Lee's fault.) The misuse-of-science theme is nicely sustained throughout the film (Glenn Talbot works for 'Atheon'; hee hee) and there's some genuine suspense as we s-l-o-w-l-y learn what was really happening in all those flashbacks.Eric Bana is right on the money as the tortured and repressed Dr. Bruce Banner; Nick Nolte is pitch-perfect as his brilliant but deranged father David Banner; Jennifer Connelly is Jennifer Connelly; and the rest of the cast are in good form as well.The CGI Hulk is -- no pun intended -- groundbreaking. I suppose if I really wanted to pick nits I could do it, but come on; this is pioneering motion-picture technology, and it's amazingly well done. (Ten years ago this stuff couldn't be done at all, and now we're complaining because some of us can _tell_ it's CGI? As opposed to what? A fifteen-foot-tall green actor?)And real comics fans can have fun spotting the little references to the Marvel series. (Bruce _and_ David Banner? Bruce _Krenzler_? This stuff is nicely handled, if not exactly retconned, in the screenplay.)I'd probably subtract half a star for a couple of slow spots, a little overuse of that comic-bookish splitscreen stuff, and some confusing action at the end. All in all, this film isn't quite as crisp and clear as the excellent X-Men films. But it most definitely partakes of That Ol' Marvel Spirit, and in particular it exemplifies Marvel's trademark ability (also exemplified in the X-Men films) to make the viewer empathize with the 'outcast' under attack from the 'real humans'.If you want Bill Bixby, go watch an old episode of _The Courtship of Eddie's Father_.

Since it's based off a comic book, you have to ignore the obviously bogus plot twists, like the Army being able to walk into a civilian's house and hold him prisoner, or the general not knowing how to find someone who has left his address on file in the very building the Army has seized control of. The movie is great fun for kids, and the special effects are fantastic, considering the scope of what Ang Lee was trying to accomplish. However, the 3-star rating is not for just the movie. The extras included on the DVD were all junk. I usually enjoy seeing deleted scenes. I can clearly see why these scenes were deleted.

I thought Spider-man was okay(3 stars worthy) as well as the sequal. X-men was okay. Same thing as Spider-man, but I liked this one better.It was very dark. Had a lot to do with Bruce Banner's strange past. Involving the death of his mother and his father being commited and all.The movie begins with a slow start. Showing the events that lead to his teen age and his adult age, where he is a scientist working on regeneration. He eventually he gets hit by gamma radiation and unleashes the monster within him.One night, when Banner(still called Krensler) is working late. He gets pissed, and the Hulk comes out. Creates a mess and leaves. This is where the movie picks up. Gets more exciting.A lot of people didn't like the whole, slowly revealing the past thing, but I did. I think, if you're going to have a mysterious past, then you should reveal it very slowyly, and keep the audience guessing a little.There is one thing I did not like, and that was the comic book feel. I didn't like it in the beginning, but halfway through the movie you'll get used to it and actually begin adapting to it. Getting used to it.I don't like comic books. So I don't care if they change a lot of facts from the comic book. Once again, I judge a movie on how entertaining it is.

First off, Eric Bana was not only the worst choice to play Dr. Banner(hulks alter ego)he is quite possible the most boring actor around. He also has terrible dialogue and plays the role like a mope. Jennifer Connelly as the girlfriend didn't know how to bring passion to her part. The idea that the Hulk had to be computer generated was a mistake. It could be debated that their was no other way to bring forth such massive size and power in a human type form, but their were a few other technics left unused. The computer image was distractingly cartoonish. That was not the face of the Hulk that I know from comics. Not nearly mean enough looking and way to boyish. Their were a couple of scenes that accurately portrayed the Hulks jumping ability but thats it. I kept waiting for something of interest to happen and all I got was an overdose of dim lit scenes and non compelling techno babble. Sam Elliot was a great choice for the General but he was too passive. The comics had a rip roaring Hulk hating General(sorry cant remember his name). The Banner/Hulk transformation scenes were bad. It was almost as if it was hidden at times. I thought a Hulk movie would blow me out of the water. The ending reminded me of the old werewolf movies;werewolf shot/changes to man/people are sad/no one is genuinely surprised. I was left not looking for another Hulk film, at least not of this kind.

Hulk really isn't bad, it's just misunderstood much like ol' greenskin himself.  The problem is the creators mixed the wrong kind of filming techniques for this movie.  One person wanted it to focus on the characters' drama, another wanted it to resemble a comic book, and another thought it should rely on it's sci-fi roots.I, like most who went to see Hulk expected a slam-packed, action-based summer blockbuster.  What we saw was a movie that couldn't make up it's mind as to what kind of film it was trying to be!  But darn it, the movie isn't as bad as people say it is.  The acting was great, the action (what little there is) is heavy, and the Hulk looks awesome!  One thing I really didn't care for was the infamous multi-panel presentation in certain scenes, combining multiple angles in the same frame.  It was an annoying and unnecessary artistic endeavor.The first thing that happens when you put the DVD in your player is you're forced to watch half a dozen short previews for other Universal DVD releases.  There is no way to skip these previews but you CAN fast forward through them.  Universal does this on purpose in the hopes such forced advertising succeeds in selling more of their products and it's underhanded of them.The special features offer almost everything a viewer could want.  I was particularly amused watching how the dogfight scene was filmed.  Seeing the effects coordinators dress a real dog in a motion capture suit was something else.  For those of us with an X-Box the 2nd disk has a nifty playable demo of the Hulk video game; a nice bonus.  The making-of segments gave me a new appreciation of what went into the movie, and it will probably do the same for you.Personally I think Hulk is a worthy purchase.

584600,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JKC3,,"[1, 2]","When David Banner (Paul Kersey) hits a road block with his experiments, he begins experimenting on himself.  Unfortunately, his altered DNA transitions to his new son, Bruce as well.  When things go wrong on the military base where he works, he is arrested and Bruce is sent to a foster home.Fast forward 30 years, and we find Bruce (Eric Bana) working with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  They are experimenting with gamma rays, hoping to prove that they can be used to help the human body heal.  But then Bruce is exposed to an unusually high dose.  He soon discovers that when he gets angry, he turns into a big green monster.Naturally, this catches the attention of people.  Specifically, Betty's estranged father, General Ross (Sam Elliot), wants to destroy The Hulk.  And there's the mysterious man who claims to be David (now played by Nick Nolte) who wants to duplicate the process.  Will Bruce get his wish to be left alone?I know I called this a puny movie in the title, but in reality, it isn't all bad.  The underlying story is interesting and emotionally engaging.  Most of the acting is good, especially Jennifer Connelly who was amazing as Betty.  The special effects weren't perfect, but they worked.  And I really enjoyed the split screens used at times to simulate the comic book look.On the other hand, the pacing of the story was off.  The back story involving David provided some nice emotional moments but slowed things down.  And the fight scenes in the second half went on too long.  Cutting out half an hour from these sections would have made a much better movie.  Nick Nolte was too out there in his acting as the aged David.  Every time he was around, I was annoyed.I'd had several friends warn me away from the movie.  It wasn't as bad as they said.

584601,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JKC3,,"[1, 2]","Whenever Hollywood tries to film a successful comic book hero concept, the director's most pressing problem is deciding how to integrate the character's distinct persona into a medium for which it was not originally designed.  The temptation to focus on special effects over characterization is usually too great to resist.  With HULK, director Ang Lee completely disregarded the tension that resided in the comic version of Bruce Banner's split personality.  On the inked page, artist/lettermen Stan Lee and Steve Ditko presented a dichotomous soul that drew in the reader, always making him wonder how the kind but ineffectual Bruce Banner could survive his transformations into the green Hulk without losing his inner self in the process.  On the celluloid screen, what the viewer sees is a mess that includes (in no particular order) a troubled youth's attempt to bury horrific memories, a warped father/son relation that results in two, rather than one, monsters, a love interest that fizzles for lack of chemistry, a raging green golem that offers no rationale for that rage, and a series of special effects that are so patently computer enhanced that the viewer cannot submit to that essential willing suspension of disbelief that is always needed to make any far-fetched plot work.  Eric Bana, who plays Bruce Banner, bears a stunning resemblance to what Toby McGuire of SPIDERMAN might look like in the next decade.  Bill Bixby, who was the original television Hulk, managed to invest his role with the needed mixture of pathos, tension, and repressed rage.  Bana simply sleepwalks through his rages which lasted only for as long as it took for the computer Hulk to make an appearance.  Jennifer Connoly, as the love interest, shows none of the zip and zowie that she showed previously in A BEAUTIFUL MIND.  Sam Elliot, who plays her four star general father, is your typically one-dimensional military man who can see the creature but not how to make that creature worthy of a hunt.  As a hunter of escaped fugitives, Elliot could take a few lessons from Barry Morse, who, in his FUGITIVE days, knew how to invest his hunter's persona with bedrock personality.  It came as no surprise to me that HULK tanked at the box office in only its second week.  For a comic book hero to make the successful leap from the printed page to the celluloid screen, that hero ought to do more than merely leap mindnumbing distances.

584603,A1SLOKGUHC5BS8,B00005JKC3,,"[1, 3]","Being a comic book fan, I try to get to see a number of the comic-to-film adaptations that get made and was some concerned about The Hulk.  The Superbowl ad didn't inspire confidence with its &quot;first glimpse&quot; of the Jolly Green Giant's cranky little brother.  Of course, the effects weren't done yet, and when I finally got to see the movie in question I was greatly pleased, much moreso than the highly disappointing Daredevil.That said, a warning.  The Hulk is not your typical action movie.  Director Ang Lee is very interested in giving his characters soul and personality moreso than thrills and explosions.  There are those, but the movie has a slow, quiet pace that it works along with.  Character is more important for Lee than fight scenes.  And his characters are, by and large, emotionally stunted.  Scientist Bruce Banner bottles everything up.  It's only the Hulk in him that can express emotions, and does so to an extreme level.  His father, David, is a raving lunatic.  Girlfriend Betty lets overbearing men cower her at times and her father can't see past his career for dealing with anybody.Lee's sense of scope is at times beautiful.  The natural scenes of the desert add texture.  These are the wide expanses that a creature like the Hulk could easily roam.  Also, Lee's attempts at stimulating comic book panels for the most part works for me, with one noteworthy exception (and if you see the movie, you'll know which one I mean).My only complaint, besides the bad panel stimulation involving the death of a major character and the occassional gaps in logic, was the kid gloves approach to violence that sometimes is employed.  While the Hulk is seen breaking all sorts of equipment and military vehicles, hardly anyone on hand seems to get seriously hurt.  Granted, the Hulk is the &quot;good guy&quot; and the soldiers on duty aren't evil, but given what the monster is (a creature of rage and low intelligence) and what he's doing (breaking anything he can get his hands on), it seems odd that no one seems to be getting seriously hurt for the most part, if not killed.Just remember if you sit down for this:  it's not just a superhero action film.

Having grew up with the Stan Lee (Spider-man, X-Men) comics and the original Bill Bixby series I knew the story of Dr. Bruce Banner.They made a different twist of the origins on this one and to tell you the truth it didn't make a lot of sense. Genetically adapting the ""anger"" in all of us as a defect and enhancing it with a drug was not very believable for me. Dr. Bruce banner was motivated by the death of his wife - not the liquid in a needle passed from a father.They missed the heart of his exile..anyway the other factor that disappointed me was the character of The Hulk was ENTIRELY CG. (Computer Generated. Yikes! Was Ang trying to be real or a Looney Toon. I love the Looney Toons, but this wasn't that kind of film. It was supposed to be a drama.The humor in is a little dry as well. I do credit Eric Bana (Chopper, Black Hawk Down) for trying to make the character work and to be honest the most interesting character was the most Looney of all - the father - played by Nick Nolte (Mulholland Falls, I Love Trouble) - he was having fun. Even the love interest played by Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind, Pollock) was that interesting. I wouldn't risk a civil war over her character. Sam Elliot (We Were Soldiers, The Final Cut) as her father was more interesting and more motivated to be in the story than she was.Okay - I was disappointed.

The computor technology of today is used in almost every scene in the film. This not a downside, as computors are a contribution to moviemaking.

The graphics are much improved compared to that version.The story is true to the popular Marvel comic book. A determind scientist has developed a mutation device, which he tests on animals. His superiors forbid him to test human subjects. However, he breaks his word and injects his baby with the formula. Years later, the young man has turned into a scientist like his father. One fateful day, he transforms into a green, gigantic, hulking monster. The welfare of New York City is threatened, along with the relationship of his girlfriend. The US Army is called to the case, resulting in a climax that will blast you out of your chair. People with high tech and action tastes will thoroughly enjoy this flick.

Ang Lee gets kudos from me for his use of split screens to suggest the panels of a comic book, but that's about where my praise ends.  Because I usually like Lee, I'm giving this two stars instead of one, but I'm doing that under duress.&quot;Hulk&quot; is dreadful. It's 140 minutes of nonsense, which might be o.k. if that nonsense had any notion that it was nonsense.  But Lee and company seem to take their material utterly seriously, which is deadly for this kind of film.  Lee uses the comic book look for his film, but he doesn't use the comic book tongue-in-cheek style of story-telling, so every single scene comes across as unintentionally silly.  Even with that, the film might have been enjoyable.  Hey, I enjoy a fun bad movie as much as the next guy.  But this is a fun bad movie without the fun.The story takes forever to get going, and once it does it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is one case where the story overwhelms the visuals.  I don't really need that much back story to the Hulk---what I want are cool action sequences and zingy special effects.  Well, the effects in this suck.  I almost have to believe the CG animation in this film was intentionally corny, otherwise the producers got seriously ripped off.  The only thing I can say about the animated Hulk is that he's a better actor than Eric Bana, who plays Bruce Banner.  Please don't ask this boy to act, and especially don't ask him to cry.  Jennifer Connelly is starting to really get on my nerves.  She's stealing the market on noble suffering away from Joan Allen.  But the real booby prize goes to Nick Nolte, who has driven another nail into the coffin of his career with his appearance in this.  He's absolutely putrid, chewing the scenery every chance he gets in a greasy fright wig.  His big showy soliloquy toward the end might have been more effective if the viewer could understand a word he says, but I doubt it.  Perhaps the filmmakers should have chosen to use a CG version of Nick Nolte instead of the real thing.And darned if this movie doesn't suffer from action movie syndrome, complete with false finale and a real finale that is jaw-droppingly wretched.  $100 bucks to anyone who can make sense of what happens at the end, and who can also tell me how all of the people back at the military base were able to see the big battle between the Hulk and Nick Nolte as if they were watching it on screen as we are, even though they are miles away watching nothing more than a radar screen.Bad, bad, bad.....Grade: D-",2,"The Horror, the Horror.....",1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,2765,"['so', 'wanted', 'give', 'film', 'better', 'review', 'nothing', 'else', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'least', 'more', 'interesting', 'average', 'approach', 'comic-book-turned-into-summer-blockbuster', 'genre', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'kudos', 'use', 'split', 'screens', 'suggest', 'panels', 'comic', 'book', 'where', 'praise', 'usually', 'Lee', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', ""'m"", 'doing', 'duress.', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'dreadful', '140', 'minutes', 'nonsense', 'might', 'be', 'o.k', 'nonsense', 'had', 'notion', 'was', 'nonsense', 'Lee', 'company', 'seem', 'take', 'material', 'utterly', 'seriously', 'deadly', 'kind', 'film', 'Lee', 'comic', 'book', 'look', 'film', ""n't"", 'use', 'comic', 'book', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'style', 'story-telling', 'so', 'single', 'scene', 'unintentionally', 'silly', 'Even', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'Hey', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'bad', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'fun', 'bad', 'movie', 'fun.The', 'story', 'forever', 'get', 'going', 'once', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'story', 'visuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'Hulk', '-what', 'want', 'are', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'zingy', 'special', 'effects', 'Well', 'effects', 'suck', 'almost', 'have', 'believe', 'CG', 'animation', 'film', 'was', 'intentionally', 'corny', 'otherwise', 'producers', 'got', 'seriously', 'ripped', 'off', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'animated', 'Hulk', 'better', 'actor', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'who', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'boy', 'act', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'cry', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'starting', 'really', 'get', 'nerves', 'stealing', 'market', 'noble', 'suffering', 'away', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'real', 'booby', 'prize', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'who', 'driven', 'nail', 'coffin', 'career', 'appearance', 'absolutely', 'putrid', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'chance', 'greasy', 'fright', 'wig', 'big', 'showy', 'soliloquy', 'end', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'viewer', 'could', 'understand', 'word', 'doubt', 'Perhaps', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'use', 'CG', 'version', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'instead', 'real', 'thing.And', 'darned', 'movie', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'action', 'movie', 'syndrome', 'complete', 'false', 'finale', 'real', 'finale', 'jaw-droppingly', 'wretched', '100', 'bucks', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'end', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'tell', 'how', 'people', 'back', 'military', 'base', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'big', 'battle', 'Hulk', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'were', 'watching', 'screen', 'are', 'even', 'are', 'miles', 'away', 'watching', 'nothing', 'more', 'radar', 'screen.Bad', 'bad', 'bad', '..Grade', 'D-']",N/A

The  Spiderman movies and Fantastic Four movies were all first class, but this was a first class bungle. To start, the so called storyline was rather dark, disturbing, and had some very disturbing scenes(particularly the frog and knife scenes). The characters had little or no depth, the actors completely flunked, and the effects for Hulk could, and should, have been better, considering today's technology.  The action was also a major ripoff.  There should have been much more of it.  The scene of Hulk fighting the army is an overstatement because the ""army"" was four copters and four tanks!  The scene when Hulk was in the city surrounded by troops could have been a major battle, until Betty came in and ruined the whole thing before it got started!  Worst of all was the so called ""final battle"" with Bruce and his father, which turned out to be the worst one on one fight in superhero cinema.

Eric Bana's performance was mediocre at best and in parts of the movie it was very hard to take him as the character seriously.Apparently they are in the process of making a sequel and Eric Bana is even considering taking the part again, they aren't using the same director and to me that's a good thing because the movie had the potential to be the best ever and it wasn't so let's hope the new Hulk movie is better than the first which in my opinion was great anyway.",4,I Loved It,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,1088,"['admit', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'dissapointing', 'alot', 'eyes', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'ways', 'thoughts', 'are', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'described', 'life', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'how', 'came', 'hold', 'gene', 'would', 'turn', 'Hulk.There', 'was', 'course', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'one', 'time', 'would', 'distract', 'what', 'were', 'ment', 'focus', 'scene', 'would', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'repeat', 'scene', 'missed', 'something', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'good.The', 'only', 'really', 'positive', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'scenes', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'performance', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'take', 'character', 'seriously.Apparently', 'are', 'process', 'making', 'sequel', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'even', 'considering', 'taking', 'part', 'again', 'are', ""n't"", 'using', 'same', 'director', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'best', 'ever', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'let', 'hope', 'new', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'better', 'first', 'opinion', 'was', 'great', 'anyway']",N/A

584622,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JKC3,,"[16, 24]","The first ten minutes of this remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the dead should have been flaunted on television as it was on the Monday before it's opening on the USA network. What an amazing start, few times am I moved by actions or horrors, (as this is both) but the sheer power and fear generated by this opening sequence is what sets the stage for this film. It is all down hill from there but the film does manage to do what few remakes do, and that is stand on it's own as a decent movie overall.The original Dawn of the Dead kept the zombies in slow motion but never turned away when they got a victim pinned down and the remake doesn't even come close to the violence or pure horror of the original (nothing does, it's one of the greatest horror films ever made).  It does however remain a suspenseful action/horror film that has you rooting for the good guys...and sometimes the zombies.  It is entertaining despite it's flaws.  Director Zack Snyder has a tremendous amount of mainstream appeal.  All of the film's outstanding strengths are directorial in nature.  The cast was also strong.  Ving Rhames revisits his type castings here but is enjoyable despite being written inconsistently.  Sarah Polley breaks her independant film mold and chooses a strange film to do so.  She is a good screamer (albeit very cliche) character.  She pulls it off well enough to conveniently veil the film's writing flaws.  The film has a decent cast in the forefront but drops off big time from there.  You will see the screenplay's very worst lines delivered the way they would be delivered in a Sleepaway Camp film.Speaking of the screenplay, it is the only real stand-out problem.  Dawn of the Dead is unique in that the screenplay is really sort of bunched up in bad dialogue and cheap copied ideas from bad movies, but it is forgiven for the most part by it's surprising aforementioned strengths.  We go by the action/horror film book page by page in this film but it manages to come off as different because of the new zombies we have, compliments to the mainstream success of the remarkably refreshing 28 Days Later.  I will admit laughing out loud at least a half dozen times at some one liners and busting a gut at the celebrity shooting scene on the roof of the mall.  You will too but if you plan on taking this remake seriously you may feel guilty about it.So how does it compare to the original?  Well, Snyder and company played it safe and made a very different film with fast zombies, no consistent or obvious social commentary, a wider and more diluted cast and some very fancy and super cool action shots.  It's colorful, it's packed with explosions, blood and  shooting; it's creepy and the zombies are almost as much fun as they were in Return of the Living Dead.  Unfortunately it sacrifices the depth and sheer terror of the original so it simply cannot be compared.All in all the film's flaws can be ignored because this film worked for me.",4,Almost as Good as the Landmark Original,1080086400,"03 24, 2004",2004,2961,"['first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'remake', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'Dawn', 'dead', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'flaunted', 'television', 'was', 'Monday', 'opening', 'USA', 'network', 'What', 'amazing', 'start', 'few', 'times', 'am', 'moved', 'actions', 'horrors', 'sheer', 'power', 'fear', 'generated', 'opening', 'sequence', 'what', 'stage', 'film', 'down', 'hill', 'there', 'film', 'manage', 'do', 'what', 'few', 'remakes', 'do', 'stand', 'own', 'decent', 'movie', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'kept', 'zombies', 'slow', 'motion', 'never', 'turned', 'away', 'when', 'got', 'victim', 'pinned', 'down', 'remake', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'violence', 'pure', 'horror', 'original', 'nothing', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'however', 'remain', 'suspenseful', 'action/horror', 'film', 'rooting', 'good', 'guys', 'sometimes', 'zombies', 'entertaining', 'flaws', 'Director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'mainstream', 'appeal', 'film', 'outstanding', 'strengths', 'are', 'directorial', 'nature', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'strong', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'type', 'castings', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'being', 'written', 'inconsistently', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'independant', 'film', 'mold', 'strange', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'good', 'screamer', 'albeit', 'very', 'cliche', 'character', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'conveniently', 'film', 'writing', 'flaws', 'film', 'decent', 'cast', 'forefront', 'off', 'big', 'time', 'there', 'will', 'see', 'screenplay', 'very', 'worst', 'lines', 'delivered', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'delivered', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'film.Speaking', 'screenplay', 'only', 'real', 'stand-out', 'problem', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'unique', 'screenplay', 'really', 'sort', 'bunched', 'up', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'cheap', 'copied', 'ideas', 'bad', 'movies', 'forgiven', 'most', 'part', 'surprising', 'aforementioned', 'strengths', 'go', 'action/horror', 'film', 'book', 'page', 'page', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'different', 'new', 'zombies', 'have', 'compliments', 'mainstream', 'success', 'remarkably', 'refreshing', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'will', 'admit', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'one', 'liners', 'busting', 'gut', 'celebrity', 'shooting', 'scene', 'roof', 'mall', 'will', 'too', 'plan', 'taking', 'remake', 'seriously', 'may', 'feel', 'guilty', 'it.So', 'how', 'compare', 'original', 'Well', 'Snyder', 'company', 'played', 'safe', 'made', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'fast', 'zombies', 'consistent', 'obvious', 'social', 'commentary', 'wider', 'more', 'diluted', 'cast', 'very', 'fancy', 'super', 'cool', 'action', 'shots', 'colorful', 'packed', 'explosions', 'blood', 'shooting', 'creepy', 'zombies', 'are', 'almost', 'much', 'fun', 'were', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Unfortunately', 'depth', 'sheer', 'terror', 'original', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared.All', 'film', 'flaws', 'can', 'be', 'ignored', 'film', 'worked']",N/A

However, his father did leave him with something other than repressed memories which is buried within his own genetic structure.  This creature within is awakened when something goes wrong in the university lab where Bruce works with his coworker Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  The strong emotional bond between Betty and Bruce is tested and the question arises whether it will restrain the dark manifestation that appears when Bruce is cornered and threatened.  The Hulk offers an intelligent view on the comic book character with the same name through the use of biopsychosocial issues.  This is combined with challenging cinematography that enhances the feeling of reading a comic book through split screens and slides.  Overall, Ang Lee brings out the best in the characters through his direction, which can also be viewed in Eat Drink Man Woman and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

And as soon as I saw it, i knew there would be a long drawn out boring interveiw with someone at I.L.M bragging about how there latest computer desighn was the best they have ever done: and I was right! Not more then 2 days later there was a thing on TV about the making of this movie, and sure enough, theres the guy raving on about how realistic this charactor of the Hulk looks. How wrong they are.If it wasnt for my old man buying it ex-rental after I told him 100 times not to buy it, he bought it, and I suffered through watching it, just incase I was wrong and it was an ok movie? But my hunch was right, i should not have watched it... If your a fan, or remember the original TV series of the Hulk, then dont expect this movie to have anything to do with that, it's like how they took Godzilla and changed that in the latest one they made. The Hulk stars Aussie EX-comedian Eric Bana, who at one point was one of the funniest people on Australian T.V with his performances in stand up and sketch comedy which are the way I wish to remember him. This movie, however, was completly boring, had plots just going no-where, the most boring dialog, and as i said, the worst CGI effects of the year!Dont just take my word for it, just look at how many second hand copys there are currently selling right now? and how much for?!I wouldnt recomend you even watch this movie for free. It's not even worth renting! And above all, I cant beleive there going to make a seaqull to this god awfull, terrible movie!If there going to make all the old super hero's make a come back? then why not go for somthign with them all in it? like that cartoon Justice League? Make that a movie, that would be somthing intresting, instead, here is your classic exsample of Hollyweed completly dry out of ideas, and recycling old ideas, old shows, old movies, and putting CGI to them expecting it to be a hit.... well, it didnt work for me, they need to learn to stop worrying so much about CGI effects and think about how to give a storyline a great plot.I'd tell you about the extra features, and if there's any egg's...but I hated the movie so much, i didnt even bother to stick the second disc in to look at it!",1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,2288,"['moment', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'i', 'thought', 'CGI', 'looked', 'extremly', 'bad', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'long', 'drawn', 'boring', 'interveiw', 'someone', 'I.L.M', 'bragging', 'how', 'there', 'latest', 'computer', 'desighn', 'was', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'was', 'right', 'Not', 'more', 'then', '2', 'days', 'later', 'was', 'thing', 'TV', 'making', 'movie', 'sure', 'enough', 'guy', 'raving', 'how', 'realistic', 'charactor', 'Hulk', 'How', 'wrong', 'are.If', 'old', 'man', 'buying', 'ex-rental', 'told', '100', 'times', 'not', 'buy', 'bought', 'suffered', 'watching', 'just', 'incase', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'hunch', 'was', 'right', 'i', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'watched', 'fan', 'remember', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'Hulk', 'then', 'dont', 'expect', 'movie', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'how', 'took', 'Godzilla', 'changed', 'latest', 'one', 'made', 'Hulk', 'stars', 'Aussie', 'EX-comedian', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'who', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'people', 'Australian', 'T.V', 'performances', 'stand', 'up', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'are', 'way', 'wish', 'remember', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'completly', 'boring', 'had', 'plots', 'just', 'going', 'no-where', 'most', 'boring', 'dialog', 'i', 'said', 'worst', 'CGI', 'effects', 'year', 'Dont', 'just', 'take', 'word', 'just', 'look', 'how', 'many', 'second', 'hand', 'copys', 'are', 'currently', 'selling', 'right', 'now', 'how', 'much', 'wouldnt', 'recomend', 'even', 'watch', 'movie', 'free', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'renting', 'cant', 'beleive', 'there', 'going', 'make', 'seaqull', 'god', 'awfull', 'terrible', 'movie', 'going', 'make', 'old', 'super', 'hero', 'make', 'come', 'back', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'go', 'somthign', 'cartoon', 'Justice', 'League', 'Make', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'somthing', 'intresting', 'instead', 'here', 'classic', 'exsample', 'Hollyweed', 'completly', 'ideas', 'recycling', 'old', 'ideas', 'old', 'shows', 'old', 'movies', 'putting', 'CGI', 'expecting', 'be', 'hit', 'well', 'work', 'need', 'learn', 'stop', 'worrying', 'so', 'much', 'CGI', 'effects', 'think', 'how', 'give', 'storyline', 'great', 'plot.I', ""'d"", 'tell', 'extra', 'features', 'egg', 'hated', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'i', 'didnt', 'even', 'bother', 'stick', 'second', 'disc', 'look']",N/A

584634,ACVNA57PI4DLV,B00005JKC3,,"[2, 4]","It's getting easier to get worked up about superhero movies, when independent directors get interested in them - including X2 and Spider-Man. And Hulk has Ang Lee - who injected a new cinematographical vision and a new vision of his superhero, made them more interesting instead of standard Hollywood clich&eacute;s.The Hulk is Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), scientist, who becomes a green super-powerful hulk when angered. The back story to Banner is much more interesting than most superheroes. His father, David (Nick Nolte), worked for the US government. But when his plans for human experimentation were rejected, he experimented on his own DNA. When he has a son, his scientific curiosity overrules the moral problem of giving birth to a dangerous mutant. A series of not quite specified events lead to David Banner being imprisoned by the US Army for more than thirty years.Bruce Banner is genetically pushed to research the same areas than his father has. He has an ambiguous relationship with Betty (Jennifer Connelly), his laboratory partner. An evil military corporation in cahoots with the government is trying to acquire their research by all means necessary. But when Bruce is involved in a laboratory accident irradiating him with gamma radiation which prods his mutant genes into action, all hell breaks loose as he becomes Hulk. Betty's father, a high-ranking military officer, eventually gains custody of the green behemoth.As I wrote before, Hulk is a mix between the movie Invincible and the Hulk character - retaining the Hulk character while telling it in a fable-like manner. Hulk is told like a comic book. In some scenes, the cinematography is arranged like a comic book : there is fast cutting from &quot;picture&quot; to &quot;picture&quot;, you see two things happening at once, or two, three, five angles of the same thing at once. A scene melds into another, a backdrop literally drops, a victim stays suspended in the air as he is engulfed in flames. True, the fast cutting can be detrimental sometimes. And the techniques don't always work. But I would say that it never impacts negatively on the movie, and on the whole it works.The story and themes revolve around the relationship between father and child, especially between Bruce and David Banner. Betty trusts her father compulsively even though he cannot sustain human relationships. David Banner is obsessively concerned with his genetic research, but has a tender, if twisted, concern for his son. Critics have pondered on the Freudian themes of these relationships : I didn't see such themes per se, although it is implied that father and son are ultimately two sides of the same coin. As we see in a climatic ending, David Banner is concerned with destroying their enemies, while Bruce doesn't want to take responsibility for his unwanted powers.The original Bruce Banner was an intelligent man, but as the green behemoth he seemed to lose all humanity, to become an unthinking brute. The Bruce Banner in &quot;Hulk&quot; is truly an ubermensch, an Objectivist hero. He fights against the military and military agencies - at first to survive and help his girlfriend. He is an intelligent scientist and a powerful being capable of compassion. While during the movie his two sides are not integrated (he ponders that being Hulk is &quot;like a dream&quot; where he has little control), at the end of the movie we see that he is finally integrated and confident in his abilities.Hulk is a revolutionary, progressist movie in many aspects - it sees genetic research and scientific progress not as a Frankenstein but as a valid means of revolution. It also has anti-imperialist and anti-American overtones. It's quite incredible that this movie even got made, let alone as a major feature. I can't really describe the long climatic ending which ties all this together, because that would be a major spoiler, but be warned that it will force you to re-evaluate the movie in an important way.There has been a lot of criticism, and some praise, for the Hulk model. From a distance, the model is good, but it's from up close that it really shines. With more than a hundred layers, the model appears realistic, the skin moves with touch, and moves around with more than a thousand independent muscles. Ang Lee's goal was to make people forget they were looking at a computer model and, while I can't say it worked completely, it certainly succeeded to some extent. The other actors are also excellent, especially Connelly, who can always bring intelligence to her roles.Director Ang Lee is a Buddhist, and inserts a couple of references in the movie through David Banner, which was fun. In the end, what really sells Hulk is not only its heroic themes and its deep character analysis, but that it keeps a total depth of story and character while the cinematography transforms this great movie into a comic book. Truly stunning.The DVD opens with non-skippable ads (including, ironically, one for Bruce Almighty). That's unfortunate, but unavoidable.Most of the criticism against Hulk is that it is too sophisticated. Well, if you think that's a bad thing, you shouldn't be watching movies. You should be watching flickering images on screens - well, blockbusters made by formulatic directors. All those critics are idiots.It's interesting to me that great things happen when more &quot;arthouse&quot; directors deal with more down-to-earth material - Tarkovsky and science-fiction, or Bergman and the Dark Ages, for example. Ang Lee has definitively succeeded in pushing superhero movies to the next level. And it is certainly great science-fiction : while it's supposed to take place in the present, the technologies are superior to our own, and the technology takes an integral part in the plot and themes, and so Hulk is definitively science-fiction in my book.",5,The Incredible Hulk + Invincible = John Galt.,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,5841,"['getting', 'easier', 'get', 'worked', 'up',

Well, they've screwed this one up, too. What little that is enjoyable about this tragic waste cannot come close to making it worth the cellophane used to wrap the DVD case.The story is insufferably tedious and the effects are horrible. Lou Ferrigno in green makeup was more believeable than this half-baked computer image. Do CGI geeks spend so much time in front of computer screens that they never witness real life?The &quot;plot&quot; is one of those weak Hollywood attempts at being psychologically profound or &quot;deep,&quot; a characteristic I'm beginning to believe no one on the payroll in tinseltown is capable of. Traditionally, the core essence of the story of The Incredible Hulk is that Bruce Banner is a tragic figure, forever searching for a cure to his crippling affliction. This movie scuttles that concept in favor of a rage-addicted, &quot;I like it&quot; line. Sort of a WWF approach. Psychologically deep, yeah, like Rambo was a profound commentary on the Vietnam War.Giving this &quot;movie&quot; one star is being overly generous, but we can't give anything less, like zero stars, or a half-star, or a small, gray, gravel-sized piece of asteroid. I rationalize the one star as acknowlegement of accurate script supervision, and because, yes, the tank scene was mildly entertaining, in a WWF/Rambo sort of way.Incredible Hulk fans steer clear.I reccomend watching Pete's Dragon instead, as the story and the special effects are far superior.",1,The Incredible Disappointment,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,2070,"['Hollywood', 'formula', '1', 'option', 'classic', 'story', '2', 'use', 'fame', 'classic', 'story', 'sell', 'worthless', 'crap', '3', 'repeat', 'steps', '1', '2.A', 'shortage', 'quality', 'fare', 'monster', 'movie', 'fans', 'tragic', 'ridiculous', 'CGI', 'age', 'combined', 'anticipation', 'Hulk', 'fans', 'modern', 'feature-length', 'treatment', 'beloved', 'big', 'green', 'guy', 'up', 'painful', 'disappointment', 'once', 'again', 'wondering', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'deliver', 'anything', 'precious', 'two', 'hours', 'lives', 'gamble', 'time', 'think', 'finally', 'have', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'screwed', 'one', 'up', 'too', 'What', 'little', 'enjoyable', 'tragic', 'waste', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'making', 'cellophane', 'used', 'wrap', 'DVD', 'case.The', 'story', 'insufferably', 'tedious', 'effects', 'are', 'horrible', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'green', 'makeup', 'was', 'more', 'believeable', 'half-baked', 'computer', 'image', 'Do', 'CGI', 'geeks', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'front', 'computer', 'screens', 'never', 'witness', 'real', 'life', 'quot', 'plot', 'quot', 'one', 'weak', 'Hollywood', 'attempts', 'being', 'psychologically', 'profound', 'quot', 'deep', 'quot', 'characteristic', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'believe', 'one', 'payroll', 'tinseltown', 'capable', 'Traditionally', 'core', 'essence', 'story', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'tragic', 'figure', 'forever', 'searching', 'cure', 'crippling', 'affliction', 'movie', 'concept', 'favor', 'rage-addicted', 'quot', 'quot', 'line', 'Sort', 'WWF', 'approach', 'Psychologically', 'deep', 'yeah', 'Rambo', 'was', 'profound', 'commentary', 'Vietnam', 'War.Giving', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'one', 'star', 'being', 'overly', 'generous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'less', 'zero', 'stars', 'half-star', 'small', 'gray', 'gravel-sized', 'piece', 'asteroid', 'rationalize', 'one', 'star', 'acknowlegement', 'accurate', 'script', 'supervision', 'because', 'yes', 'tank', 'scene', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'WWF/Rambo', 'sort', 'way.Incredible', 'Hulk', 'fans', 'steer', 'clear.I', 'reccomend', 'watching', 'Pete', 'Dragon', 'instead', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'far', 'superior']",N/A

584644,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JKC3,,"[2, 6]","Ang Lee's vision of The Hulk, the superhero version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde crossed with Frankenstein, puts much emphasis on the character's origin, and Bruce Banner's (Eric Bana) relationship with his father David (Nick Nolte).  The story is quite drawn out, difficult to follow, and loaded with drama, things which might work well in a graphic novel with an extended storyline, but the 138 minute long film seems bloated, overbearing, and a little lacking in the action department for a PG-13 audience.Eric Bana is a decent actor, but riding around on a bike, he seems a little young to play an accomplished scientist.  Banner's green skinned alter ego seems oversized, and bloated, and never seems that he really belongs on the screen.  The other major characters, General Ross (Sam Elliot) and his daughter Betty (Jennifer Connelly), are integrated in ways that seem to fit, and Elliot in particular seems like a good fit.There is a crisply executed battle sequence where the Hulk escapes from captivity and tangles with the army in the desert, that is very much in the spirit of the comics, and captures the Hulk's ferociousness, although he still looks very much like a Looney Tune character superimposed on film.  From this highlight, things go downhill as the Hulk catches a ride on a fighter jet, then digs below the city of San Francisco to get to Betty.  The Hulk's other opponents are unconvincing CG mutant dogs, and his father David Banner, who has also acquired super powers and transformed into some kind of weird terrible looking gray colored variation of The Thing.While the Hulk was a huge commercial success, it's a real mess of a film.  Physically the Hulk is way out of scale, and the overdramatic factor that is David Banner pushes matters way past ridiculous, even for a comic book adaptation.  The final battle between Hulk, and the entity that was his father, has a reality factor of zero, and looks just awful.For Hulk fans, and those curious above the complete Marvel universe, the film is certainly worth a watch.

584645,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00005JKC3,,"[2, 6]","Director Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" is a worthwhile rendition of Marvel's Hulk. Like the '08 version, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's look at what works and what doesn't work:WHAT WORKS:- What I'm most impressed with is the serious, intelligent, respectable manner in which the story is presented. There are no goofy, campy elements to be found.- Most of the casting is good: Sam Elliott as General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and Josh Lucas as Glen Talbot.- Ang Lee shows off his filmmaking skill with various creative editing/framing techniques (supposedly giving the feel of a comic book). I've never seen this type of work in any other film, particularly not to this degree of innovation. It works for me.- I think they did an excellent job with the appearance of the Hulk. Since they were endeavoring to show the REAL Hulk, the one that throws tanks around and jumps across the landscape, they had no choice but to go the CGI route. They did the best they could with the technology available at the time and it holds up a decade later. Hey, it's better than a big body-builder painted green!- Without doubt, the best part of the film is the 22-minute rampage of the Hulk that starts at the 92-minute mark. This IS the Hulk! The enthralling sequence realistically shows the Hulk taking on the military as was often portrayed in the comics. This is definitely one of the best action sequences ever put to film. Make no mistake, the DVD is worth owning for this 22-minute episode alone!WHAT DOESN'T WORK:- The drama is presented in a lazy, convoluted way that somehow detaches the viewer from the film, but I'm okay with it as long as I put on a pot of coffee, lol. This will naturally turn-off Hulk fans who were expecting a fast-paced, simplistic ""Hulk will SMASH"" story.- Some of the casting is questionable, like Eric Bana as Bruce Banner. Some criticize him as ""wooden"" but this isn't what I object to as it's the point of the character. Although Bana is certainly likable in the role, and I've gotten used to him, he just doesn't exude Bruce Banner as depicted in the comics or the TV series; he's too much of a handsome muscleman who looks like he could kick some serious arse without turning into the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept. By contrast, both Bill Bixby and Edward Norton fit the character. Then there's Nick Nolte as Bruce's father, David Banner, the ""Absorbing Man."" It took me quite a while to get used to his role in this film, but I'm okay with it now.- Some may object to the deviations made to the origin of the hulk and that these changes slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In the film the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.CONCLUSION: The positive aspects noted above make ""Hulk"" at least a 3/5 Star film. What I like best is the highly mature tone (Roger Ebert called it ""a thinking man's superhero film"") and the enthralling 22-minute rampage, which is worth the price of admission. But the changes in the origin story slow the film down and are presented in a generally convoluted way that lacks drive. Yet, at the same time, I appreciate the yin/yang extremes of the plot; it makes for a unique viewing experience.In any case, the 22-minute rampage that starts at the 92-minute mark is the Hulk to a 'T' and one of the most entertaining comic-action sequences in the history of film.Despite being based on a comic book (and TV show), ""Hulk"" is not a fast-food comic flick like, say, the 90's Batman films. This is an intelligent, well-crafted piece of cinematic art that just so happens to involve a rampaging green behemoth. At 138 minutes the film's a bit overlong, but that's okay. Just put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and enjoy the movie magic. This is what I just did and the film gave me a great time.I value the '03 and '08 versions equally, but I prefer the way the Hulk looks in this version; he's more realistic whereas the Hulk in the '08 version comes off overly cartooney, albeit grittier.GRADE: B+",4,A convoluted drama and THE INCREDIBLE HULK,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,4476,"['Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', '2003', 'Hulk', 'worthwhile', 'rendition', 'Marvel', 'Hulk', ""'08"", 'version', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'Let', 'look', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'work', 'WHAT', 'What', ""'m"", 'most', 'impressed', 'serious', 'intelligent', 'respectable', 'manner', 'story', 'presented', 'are', 'goofy', 'campy', 'elements', 'be', 'found.-', 'Most', 'casting', 'good', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'General', 'Thunderbolt', 'Ross', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Glen', 'Talbot.-', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'filmmaking', 'skill', 'various', 'creative', 'editing/framing', 'techniques', 'supposedly', 'giving', 'feel', 'comic', 'book', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'type', 'work', 'other', 'film', 'particularly', 'not', 'degree', 'innovation', 'me.-', 'think', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'appearance', 'Hulk', 'were', 'endeavoring', 'show', 'REAL', 'Hulk', 'one', 'tanks', 'jumps', 'landscape', 'had', 'choice', 'go', 'CGI', 'route', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'technology', 'available', 'time', 'up', 'decade', 'later', 'Hey', 'better', 'big', 'body-builder', 'painted', 'green', 'doubt', 'best', 'part', 'film', '22-minute', 'rampage', 'Hulk', '92-minute', 'mark', 'Hulk', 'enthralling', 'sequence', 'realistically', 'Hulk', 'taking', 'military', 'was', 'often', 'portrayed', 'comics', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'Make', 'mistake', 'DVD', 'worth', 'owning', '22-minute', 'episode', 'alone', 'WHAT', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'drama', 'presented', 'lazy', 'convoluted', 'way', 'somehow', 'viewer', 'film', ""'m"", 'okay', 'as', 'long', 'put', 'pot', 'coffee', 'lol', 'will', 'naturally', 'turn-off', 'Hulk', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'expecting', 'fast-paced', 'simplistic', 'Hulk', 'will', 'SMASH', 'story.-', 'casting', 'questionable', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'criticize', 'wooden', ""n't"", 'what', 'object', 'point', 'character', 'Bana', 'certainly', 'likable', 'role', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'just', ""n't"", 'exude', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'depicted', 'comics', 'TV', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'handsome', 'muscleman', 'who', 'could', 'kick', 'serious', 'arse', 'turning', 'Hulk', 'away', 'whole', 'concept', 'contrast', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'fit', 'character', 'Then', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Bruce', 'father', 'David', 'Banner', 'Absorbing', 'Man', 'took', 'quite', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'role', 'film', ""'m"", 'okay', 'now.-', 'may', 'object', 'deviations', 'made', 'origin', 'hulk', 'changes', 'slow', 'story', 'down', 'needlessly', 'complicate', 'comic', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'became', 'Hulk', 'accidentally', 'being', 'exposed', 'gamma', 'rays', 'huge', 'government', 'test-bomb', 'desert', 'film', 'Hulk', 'origin', 'complicated', 'being', 'tied', 'Bruce', 'mad', 'scientist', 'father', 'who', 'experimented', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'one', 'allow', 'latitude', 'comic-to-film', 'translation', 'changes', 'definitely', 'slow', 'story', 'down', 'make', 'origin', 'less', 'immediately', 'gratifying', 'BUT', 'offer', 'father/son', 'conflict', 'table.CONCLUSION', 'positive', 'aspects', 'noted', 'make', 'Hulk', 'least', '3/5', 'Star', 'film', 'What', 'like', 'best', 'highly', 'mature', 'tone', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'called', 'thinking', 'man', 'superhero', 'film', 'enthralling', '22-minute', 'rampage', 'price', 'admission', 'changes', 'origin', 'story', 'slow', 'film', 'down', 'are', 'presented', 'generally', 'convoluted', 'way', 'drive', 'same', 'time', 'appreciate', 'yin/yang', 'extremes', 'plot', 'unique', 'viewing', 'experience.In', 'case', '22-minute', 'rampage', '92-minute', 'mark', 'Hulk', ""'T"", 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'comic-action', 'sequences', 'history', 'film.Despite', 'being', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'TV', 'show', 'Hulk', 'not', 'fast-food', 'comic', 'flick', 'say', '90', 'Batman', 'films', 'intelligent', 'well-crafted', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'art', 'just', 'so', 'involve', 'rampaging', 'green', 'behemoth', '138', 'minutes', 'film', 'bit', 'overlong', 'okay', 'Just', 'put', 'pot', 'coffee', ""'re"", 'gon', 'need', 'kick', 'back', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'magic', 'what', 'just', 'did', 'film', 'gave', 'great', 'time.I', 'value', ""'03"", ""'08"", 'versions', 'equally', 'prefer', 'way', 'Hulk', 'version', 'more', 'realistic', 'Hulk', ""'08"", 'version', 'off', 'overly', 'cartooney', 'grittier.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
584646,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B00005JKC3,,"[2, 6]","----------------------------------------Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------I remember seeing this over 9 years ago.  At the time I thought it was a good film.  But...as we age and our tastes get refined, we start knowing better.  Also the one flaw this movie has is that it DOESN'T FOLLOW THE SOURCE MATERIAL, I.E. THE COMIC BOOKS!!!  That's a big deal.Also the acting by Eric Bana was really unimpressive.  Nick Nolte, well he's Nick Nolte, looking as if he was fresh out of prison in this movie, crazy hair and all.  Jennifer Connelly while good in other films, felt out of place in this one.  The only actor I actually think gave a GOOD performance was the great Sam Elliot, as General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross.***Major Difference in this Hulk and the Comic Book Hulk***If you are a comic book reader or if you have at least heard of 'The Hulk' you know that Bruce Banner gets exposed to gamma radiation.  In the comics it's a bomb explosion he's exposed to.  In the tv series and the 'Incredible Hulk' movie and 'Avengers' movie, he's exposed to gamma radiation in that weird looking rotating chair.  Still, simple concept, radiation exposure = Hulk.  Sure, there are other factors, Bruce was beaten as a child by a drunk father and this is why he's angry as the Hulk, etc.  Still over all, a good simple concept that has worked since the 1960's.Enter Ang Lee, a director who wants to take this beloved character in another direction.  Ang envisions a 30 foot Hulk, who is the way he is for other complicated reasons.  Well...here it goes.***Movie/Plot Details, Spoiler Alert, But I would not worry about it...***David Banner (Nick Nolte) when he was younger worked as an Army scientist whose passion was to make people stronger and resistant to diseases.  The beginning of the movie shows him dissecting a jelly-fish, a salmonder, a sea cucumber, a star-fish, and other creatures and collecting their genetic material.  After numerous experiments he successfully implants these various genes into a spider-monkey and after gasing the poor thing with cyonide, it survives.  He realizes then that he has strengthened the monkey's cellular structure and made it a stronger organism.He of course goes to Thaddeus Ross and demands to start human test subjects.  Ross of course says NO, and thus David Banner must resort to other measures.  He begins to test on himself.  He soon discovers that he may have modified himself genetically, but isn't quite sure of the results.  He then is informed by his wife that she is pregnant and they are going to have a child.  Little Bruce is born 9 months later.David soon discovers that the genes he has spliced into himself were passed on to his child.  Notice the green tinge of color on the baby's arms and legs when his pacifer is yanked away... David is horrified and wants to find a cure for this accident.  Ross however explores Banner's lab and finds out he has broken protocal and has been doing human testing.  Ross tells Banner he is finished.  David seems to suffer a mental break-down and causes the Army base's gamma nuclear power plant to overload and explode.  He then heads home to stab Bruce with a kitchen knife, but Bruce's mother fights and gets stabbed and killed herself.  Little Bruce witnesses all of this, and this is eluded to as the reason he is so violent as the Hulk.Long story short David Banner is taken away, little Bruce is put into foster care and grows up with all his young life repressed in his mind.This is where the movie really takes a weird turn.  It seems the now Dr. Bruce Banner is working on ""Nanomeds"", nano machines that can repair a person once they are inside one's body.  He and Dr. Betty Ross are testing these machines on frogs.  They bombard a frog with gamma radiation, expose it to the nanomeds and hope the frog gets healed by the little molecule machines.  Unfortunately so far all that's happened is the frogs explode.An unfortunate accident happens one day in the lab.  A lab assistant is caught in the lab, Bruce comes in to get him free of the equipment.  For some reason the gamma emitters come on full blast, and the nanomeds get released.  Bruce ingests the nanomeds and gets a whallop of gamma radiation.He wakes up in the hospital seemingly okay, apparently the nanomeds saved him.I'll simply say he's not, and after a visit from his long lost father (Nick Nolte) discovers he does indeed have some weird genes in his dna.So, how exactly/why does he become the Hulk in this movie.  Here it goes.  Bruce inheritated these extra genes from his father.  By the process of them getting passed on, they are purified and integrated better into his genome than his father's.  But the genes are recessive.  They are not dominant genes.  They are sort of just hanging out in his dna, and for quite a while not doing anything.  He grows up, and gets exposed to the gamma radiation.  The gamma apparently ""unlocks"" these genes and allows them to become dominant, with the ability to be expressed.  Still his normal human genes are still the most prominant though.  But he now has nano machines swimming around inside of his body.  These machines respond to injury.  When Bruce gets angry, the nano machines interpret anger as ""injury"".  But since he has nothing physical to heal, they instead, (for an unexplained reason), restructure him based off his newly expressable artificial genes his father gave him.  I.E. he transforms into the Hulk when angered.Whew...that's a mouthful.  This the reason this movie is not very good.  That and the Hulk is at his biggest, yes he changes size for some reason, 30 feet tall.  Add to it the weird character of Nick Nolte and the fact he becomes the Absorbing Man and you have one big stinker.Are the action scenes good.  Absolutely, they are in fact the only saving grace of this movie, that and Sam Elliot.I could go more into the story, but there's no point.  This particular incarnation of the Hulk has been abandoned.  The Hulk from the 'Avengers' is official Hulk now, and quite cool I might add.  Marvel had the right idea by scrapping 'The Hulk' and starting over with the 'Incredible Hulk'.  It was a far better movie, and is part of the 'Iron-Man', 'Thor', 'Captain America', and 'Avengers' franchise now.---In Conclusion---This movie is a prime example of what happens when you mess with something that is not broken.  All I can say is I'm finally glad the movie studios are listening to the comic-book fanboys and delivering movies that are GOOD and stay true, mostly, to the source material.  Not only does it make for better movies, and box office success, but it keeps the comic book geeks, (like me), happy.  And they should strive to keep us happy, we can make or break a superhero movie's success...Is it worth buying.  Only if you can find it cheap, like 8 bucks and below.  Otherwise just wait for it to come on tv somewhere.  It's showing on the Encore channels right now.  You could just catch it there.Well that's my thoughts.  Hopefully the days of a film like this are over and all we will be getting from this point on is 'Avengers' quality movies.  Here's hoping, and here's hoping that the new 'Man of Steel' movie doesn't suck.  Kevin Costner as Johnathen Kent, it may just have a chance...",3,Stick with Dramas Ang Lee!!!!,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,7504,"['Public', 'service', 'announcement', 'begin', 'review', 'Toonami',

Texture on Mr. Green is accurate in close ups but tends to get a bit soft around the edges as the hulk goes into tearing up things. Blacks are black. Contrast and shadow delineation is effectively rendered.

I was confused from the start with what Bruce Banner's father, David, was doing. Things are different from how Marvel's Hulk originated, and other fans will surely be as confused.Bruce's relationship with Betty is similarly confusing. Are they dating, or did they just break up? Do they love each other, or using each other's emotions to meet some professional goals?Eric Bana, as Bruce, gave a performance that meant nothing. There was nothing to relate to as his deadpan, unexpressive personality provided only a place keeper until the Hulk raged out from him.Bruce's relationship with his father is filled with inconsistencies. Throughout the movie, I never knew if his father cared for him, or saw him as a scientific project.I never understood why, if David was such a threat to the government, and if his crimes were so terrible, was he allowed out of prison.Other unanswered questions: Why was the Hulk's wrecking of the lab largely ignored? How was a big corporation manipulating the military? Why didn't Betty tell her father about the giant dogs? Why didn't the Hulk kill Talbot when he had no moral trouble killing the guys in the tank?Stylistically, Ang Lee worried more about mimicking the comic book rather than expanding on the story. The result was a video comic, not the pop cinema masterpiece it could have been. The Hulk looks good, but too much like a colored drawing imposed upon celluloid. The special effects might be technically strong, but not as impressive as the hype.This is a B-movie tramped up into a high-publicity project that never meets its mark. Ang Lee screwed it up by dwelling on secondary concerns.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",2,Needs More Stan Lee and Less Ang Lee,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,2105,"['character', 'Hulk', 'so', 'caged', 'comic', 'book', 'legend', 'film', 'version', 'will', 'face', 'scrutiny', 'fans', 'fan', 'Hulk', 'hearing', 'great', 'hype', 'CGI', 'animation', 'watched', 'Hulk', 'hope', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Too', 'much', 'movie', 'origin', 'unexplained', 'subtexts', 'not', 'enough', 'story', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'company', 'made', 'famous.The', 'story', 'here', 'slowly', 'vaguely', 'was', 'confused', 'start', 'what', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'father', 'David', 'was', 'doing', 'Things', 'are', 'different', 'how', 'Marvel', 'Hulk', 'originated', 'other', 'fans', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'confused.Bruce', 'relationship', 'Betty', 'similarly', 'confusing', 'Are', 'dating', 'did', 'just', 'break', 'up', 'Do', 'love', 'other', 'using', 'other', 'emotions', 'meet', 'professional', 'goals', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Bruce', 'gave', 'performance', 'meant', 'nothing', 'was', 'nothing', 'relate', 'deadpan', 'unexpressive', 'personality', 'provided', 'only', 'place', 'keeper', 'Hulk', 'raged', 'out', 'him.Bruce', 'relationship', 'father', 'filled', 'inconsistencies', 'movie', 'never', 'knew', 'father', 'cared', 'saw', 'scientific', 'project.I', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'David', 'was', 'such', 'threat', 'government', 'crimes', 'were', 'so', 'terrible', 'was', 'allowed', 'prison.Other', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Why', 'was', 'Hulk', 'wrecking', 'lab', 'largely', 'ignored', 'How', 'was', 'big', 'corporation', 'manipulating', 'military', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Betty', 'tell', 'father', 'giant', 'dogs', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Hulk', 'kill', 'Talbot', 'when', 'had', 'moral', 'trouble', 'killing', 'guys', 'tank', 'Stylistically', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'worried', 'more', 'mimicking', 'comic', 'book', 'rather', 'expanding', 'story', 'result', 'was', 'video', 'comic', 'not', 'pop', 'cinema', 'masterpiece', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Hulk', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'colored', 'drawing', 'imposed', 'celluloid', 'special', 'effects', 'might', 'be', 'technically', 'strong', 'not', 'as', 'impressive', 'hype.This', 'B-movie', 'tramped', 'up', 'high-publicity', 'project', 'never', 'mark', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'screwed', 'up', 'dwelling', 'secondary', 'concerns.Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

Too many recent superhero fantasies have involved by-the-numbers stories dappled with computer-generated graphics.But, man, Ang Lee's &quot;The Hulk&quot; requires way too much heavy lifting for your basic monster movie.In telling the story of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a scientist transformed by his experiments into a big green behemoth, Lee gets a lot right. The colors and camera angles and production design neatly evoke the Marvel Comics renderings of Jack Kirby; the blunt, stark dialogue all but floats over the characters' heads in ""word balloons""; and an array of split-screens, wipes and dissolves replicate the panels of a comic book, even if they are overused and distracting.The crucial element that's missing, however, is fun. There's not a drop of fun in this long, low movie. There's no sense of adventure or wonder, which is the core of any fantasy. Instead, by filling the plot with lots of half-baked psychology about Bruce's evil dad David (Nick Nolte), Lee and screenwriter James Schamus have transformed ""The Hulk"" into a bland allegory about bad family ties.

""we would not tell spiderman!"" from the boy on the train from spiderman 2 just that line has totally ruin it for me how lame)i recommend anyone who has seen the hulk and hated or did not enjoy it as much the first time around to watch it again cos it is REALLY A GREAT FILM its a shame that people want to see more and more of senseless action and not try to get in touch with the characters... the hulk for me was a film that touched me on a personal level sometime i feel i could change into the hulk but it seems no one can get me angry enough hehehe..fan of the comic this is a must to collect...you DO NOT want to make the hulk angry..",5,HULK deserves another look!!!,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,3360,"['must', 'admitt', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'watch', 'film', 'movies', 'i', 'was', 'left', 'speechless', 'i', 'mean', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'having', 'watch', 'xmen', 'spiderman', 'enjoyed', 'watch', 'Hulk', 'left', 'different', 'taste', 'mouth', 'was', 'kinda', 'bitter', 'really', '..', 'yes', 'first', 'experience', 'hulk', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'most', 'fans', 'will', 'say', 'then', 'got', 'DVD', 'gave', 'second', 'chance', 'then', 'was', 'being', 'hit', 'gamma', 'radiation', 'i', 'was', 'energized', 'totally', 'transformed', 'Hulk', 'now', 'absolutely', 'love', 'film', 'i', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'i', 'do', 'firstly', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'rate', 'favrioute', 'comic', 'movies', ':1', 'Xmen', '2', 'Hulk', 'yep', 'equal', 'first', 'position', '2', 'Xmen', '13', 'Spiderman', 'chessy', 'fun', 'watch', '5', 'Hellboy', 'not', 'soo', 'great', 'film', 'good', 'character', '100.', 'daredevil', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'was', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'crap', 'ok', 'let', 'break', 'hulk', 'bits..firstly', 'story', 'very', 'different', 'superheores', 'i', 'have', 'even', 'seem', 'i', 'mean', 'guy', 'super', 'cool', 'powers', 'military', 'hates', 'dad', 'when', 'not', 'green..', 'just', 'everyone', 'guess', 'how', 'HULK', 'will', 'feel', 'secondly', ""n't"", 'help', 'save', 'people', 'most', 'film', 'just', 'try', 'stay', 'people', 'way', 'making', 'escape', 'military', 'guys', 'how', 'can', 'i', 'film', 'when', 'not', 'super', 'cool', 'well', 'hulk', 'becos', 'soo', 'REAL', 'i', 'remember', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'scenes', 'where', 'just', 'looking', 'quietly', 'really', 'give', 'sense', 'feeling', 'rather', 'sad', 'innocence', 'hulk', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'spiderman', 'xmen', 'here', 'ann', 'lee', 'taken', 'different', 'approach', 'bring', 'hulk', 'life', 'first', 'giving', 'hulk', 'soul.from', 'many', 'friend', 'told', 'how', 'hulk', 'became', 'be', 'hulk', 'was', 'sad', 'story', 'when', 'hulk', 'unable', 'control', 'own', 'action', 'movie', 'captured', 'element', 'very', 'accuarately', 'i', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'when', 'watching', 'hulk', 'really', 'expected', 'be', 'spiderman', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'hulk', 'only.ILM', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'bring', 'hulk', 'big', 'screen', 'what', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'speical', 'effect', 'digital', 'hulk', 'truely', 'MASTER', 'PIECE', 'i', 'give', 'respect', 'one', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'story', 'though', 'not', 'action', 'packed', 'xmen', 'spiderman', 'different', 'view', 'superheroe', 'human', 'side', 'side', 'most', 'superheroes', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'bring', 'out', 'lee', 'vision', 'hulk', 'powerful', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'hulk', 'will', 'no', 'know', 'ann', 'lee', 'did', 'motion', 'capture', 'hulk', 'yes', 'little', 'man', 'hulk', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'nothing', 'too', 'chessy', 'lame', 'eg', 'would', 'not', 'tell', 'spiderman', 'boy', 'train', 'spiderman', '2', 'just', 'line', 'totally', 'ruin', 'how', 'lame', 'i', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'hulk', 'hated', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'again', 'cos', 'REALLY', 'A', 'GREAT', 'FILM', 'shame', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'senseless', 'action', 'not', 'try', 'get', 'touch', 'characters', 'hulk', 'was', 'film', 'touched', 'personal', 'level', 'sometime', 'i', 'feel', 'i', 'could', 'change', 'hulk', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'angry', 'enough', 'hehehe..fan', 'comic', 'must', 'collect', 'DO', 'NOT', 'want', 'make', 'hulk', 'angry..']",N/A

Ang Lee directs movies like ""The Ice Storm,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Sense and Sensibility,"" not movies about radioactive green rage monsters!But for reasons that will forever escape me, somebody DID let Lee direct a movie about the classic comic book hero, the Hulk. And it is a disaster -- a ponderous, dull psychodrama entirely devoted to the Hulk's daddy issues. It's a prime example of how you can have all the best actors, but it does nothing if the director is all wrong. Seriously, who hired Lee for this? And what drugs were they on?Years ago, scientist David Banner (Paul Kersey, and later Nick Nolte) performed strange experiments on himself involving genetic material from various sea creatures. He inadvertently passed this mutation on to his baby son Bruce -- and when his project was shut down, he blew up the lab and tried to kill his son.Remember that from the comic books?Present day: Bruce (Eric Bana) is a bionuclear scientist who is working with nanotechnology, along with his ex-girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). But then a lab accident douses Bruce with gamma radiation -- and that night, he transforms into a massive green monster. Unfortunately this attracts the newly-freed David's attention, and he begins trying to find a way to get the Hulk's powers for himself. First goal: endanger Betty.As Bruce struggles with his not-very-scary alter ego he also has to contend with Betty's fanatical father, General Ross (Sam Elliott) and the sleazy Major Talbot (Josh Lucas), who wants to somehow extract Bruce's power. But the biggest threat is Bruce's crazy hobo dad, who is determined to gain all of the Hulk's power for himself... and even more than that.I get the feeling that Lee has a lot of contempt for comic book fans. Throughout all of ""Hulk,"" it felt like Lee is spoon-feeding the audience, while also making sure that they are bored into a stupor by aspects of the Hulk that nobody cares about. At all. I do not care about Bruce Banner's crippling daddy issues, and I suspect no one else is either. I want to see him turn green and smash things!Even Lee's usually-brilliant direction feels lazy -- he constantly uses frames to let us know ""Hey this is a comic book movie! Not a REAL movie I'd put effort into!"" and one character's death is completely ruined when he turns into a two-dimensional paper cut-out. And the torturously long prologue ends up destroying all mystery for the rest of the movie -- we're just sitting around, waiting for Bruce to catch up on everything we already know. So the ""shocking"" revelations are just dull and anticlimactic.Lee also throws some stuff in that is so silly that it seems disrespectful. There is a Hulk rat and a Hulk poodle. A HULK POODLE. Silly haircut and all. And he can't even stick to the ""angry=Hulk-out"" formula -- there's a scene where Banner transforms for NO REASON other than a plot-convenient psychotic break.Oh, and does the Hulk smash? Occasionally. It takes almost an hour for him to actually smash something, and even then it's the Hulk Poodle and its friends. The Hulk himself looks utterly ridiculous -- a too-smooth green balloon with huge woobie eyes, bouncing lightly across the desert.One common defense of this movie is that it's a study of complex characters... but it's not. Banner is just a boring generic scientist, and Betty is a generic supportive love interest with little spine, despite Jennifer Connelly's best efforts. The good guys are pure of heart; the general, mad scientist and evil blond douche (I don't know why he's even in the movie!) are evilly evil with no virtues whatsoever.The one good aspect of it is that the actors, bless them, are trying. They're trying really hard. Connelly, Bana and Elliott seem to be pouring a lot of effort into making their characters work, but it's a futile effort.If this were the first Ang Lee movie I'd ever seen, I would assume this man had no talent or knowledge of filmcraft, and was bribing critics to praise him.

Then you'd get some kind of innovation, not just an action movie with capes.&quot; Okay, I admit I was wrong. Ang Lee is just the man for the job, and the Hulk is just the right superhero, but this movie is horrible. None of the director's innovative ideas work.Ang Lee must have been groaning when he sat in the editing room and looked at what the footage. The Hulk is the biggest problem --- he's computer-generated and he looks that way. His face isn't realistic, his hair doesn't move, and he leaps like a cartoon. When he's smashing tanks, the tanks are the only interesting thing on the screen. And then there's the principal actors. Nick Nolte shambles around, Eric Bana is extremely bland, and Jennifer Connelly needs to eat a full meal soon.I had a lot of trouble getting through this movie. I used the fast-forward button a lot. I had to wait a long time for the Hulk to arrive and smash things. When he did, it was a disappointment.

To say this film was a disappointment would be the understatement of the century. Fourty-five minutes into the movie, I was still waiting for it to start. A lot of the other reviewers have echoed my own complaints, so I'll just limit my own observations to the following:1. Ang Lee was the wrong director for this film -- by his own admission according to an internet news report shortly after the film was released. You can't rely too heavily on the Greek Tragedy elements in an S/F piece, and that's what happened here. It needed an experienced comic book or S/F director such as Brian Singer or even Stephen Sommers.2. Eric Bana was completely wrong for the lead. But that is the fault of a Hollywood too obsessed with good-looking leading men. Bana was too tall, to handsome, and far too young (I wish the original rumor of Steve Buscemi had been true).3. Why oh why didn't someone call Peter David to write the script? If anyone could have saved it, it was him.4. Jennifer Connelly tried hard to save it, but there just wasn't much to work with.Well, that's it in a nutshell. If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother. The original TV series is better.

584662,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00005JKC3,,"[3, 6]","It is unfortunate, but Hulk is so far my least favorite of all the comic book movies that have been created.  One would think the Hulk could easily make the list as one of the better comic films, being the popular and dominating comic book creation he is, but director Ang Lee and a lackluster story keep this movie from being incredible, though effects still keep it somewhat enjoyable.I'll be honest, it took a few seperated viewings for me to get through this film, as it is so slow and boring throughout.  There is too much dialouge (and uninteresting speeches) to occupy a film featuring such a massive creature as the Hulk.  Eric Bana, though a wonderful actor, does little with his character of Bruce Banner, making it difficult to understand the true emotions within this man.  When he turns into the Hulk, its really the only part that becomes exciting (and very well should), but at that point we have a CGI creature that doesn't talk, just runs around and wrecks everything (which admittadly, is fun to watch as the visuals effects let loose and show off).  Betty Ross is handled fairly well by Jennifer Connely, but the relation between Bruce and Betty isn't nearly as emotional or exciting as it could be.  Again, most of the interaction was slow and boring, and though I could feel there were some emotional struggles between the two characters, I felt like I had to think about it too much to realise it.  The rest of the cast wasn't anything special either, and overall, acting on everyone's part was below par as far as comic book movies go.The directing is my next issue.  I give credit to Ang Lee for his comic book style of split-screens, picture in picture and so forth.  But the truth is the multiple angles for many of these scenes grow tiresome and distracting from the real action.  Fortunately during the Hulk action scenes in the film, little of this style is used, or esle it would have been impossible to enjoy.So where is the excitment in this film?  It is when Bruce becomes the Hulk.  The creature is massive and an impressive CGI, but to be picky, the closeups of Hulk make him look too smooth and not as rugged and detailed as he could be.  He destroys practically everything he comes incontact with, and can toss military tanks with ease - a truly enjoyable sight to watch.  Also enjoyable are the scenes when Hulk is jumping among the mountains throughout canyons, but at some point you stop and ask yourself ""is he jumping or flying"".  It becomes a little overdone, but nevertheless, if you have a big screen television it is a sight to enjoy.Overall, this movie is just bad.  I find it very hard to sit through the entire 2 hour 18 minute run.  The 15-20 minutes of non-stop action about 1:30 in the film is all that will keep you awake.  Hulk could have been an impressive film, but so much went wrong as mentioned above.  Thankfully, this summer of '08, a new Hulk film will be released and chances are the same mistakes will not be repeated, thanks to an entirely new crew and cast.  Watch this first Hulk film while you can (if you dare) because chances are it is about to become forgotten for good.Acting - 2.5Action - 4Characters - 1.5Story - 1.5Overall - 2",2,"There's a reason ""incredible"" is not in the title",1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,3201,"['unfortunate', 'Hulk', 'so', 'far', 'least', 'favorite', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'Hulk', 'could', 'easily', 'make', 'list', 'one', 'better', 'comic', 'films', 'being', 'popular', 'dominating', 'comic', 'book', 'creation', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'lackluster', 'story', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'incredible', 'effects', 'still', 'keep', 'somewhat', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'took', 'few', 'seperated', 'viewings', 'get', 'film', 'so', 'slow', 'boring', 'too', 'much', 'dialouge', 'uninteresting', 'speeches', 'occupy', 'film', 'featuring', 'massive', 'creature', 'Hulk', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'little', 'character', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'making', 'difficult', 'understand', 'true', 'emotions', 'man', 'When', 'Hulk', 'really', 'only', 'part', 'exciting', 'very', 'well', 'should', 'point', 'have', 'CGI', 'creature', ""n't"", 'talk', 'just', 'runs', 'around', 'wrecks', 'everything', 'admittadly', 'fun', 'watch', 'visuals', 'effects', 'let', 'loose', 'show', 'off', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'handled', 'fairly', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Connely', 'relation', 'Bruce', 'Betty', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'emotional', 'exciting', 'could', 'be', 'Again', 'most', 'interaction', 'was', 'slow', 'boring', 'could', 'feel', 'were', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'two', 'characters', 'felt', 'had', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'realise', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'overall', 'acting', 'everyone', 'part', 'was', 'below', 'par', 'as', 'far', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'go.The', 'directing', 'next', 'issue', 'give', 'credit', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'split-screens', 'picture', 'picture', 'so', 'forth', 'truth', 'multiple', 'angles', 'many', 'scenes', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'distracting', 'real', 'action', 'Fortunately', 'Hulk', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'little', 'style', 'used', 'esle', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'enjoy.So', 'where', 'excitment', 'film', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Hulk', 'creature', 'massive', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'be', 'picky', 'closeups', 'Hulk', 'make', 'look', 'too', 'smooth', 'not', 'rugged', 'detailed', 'could', 'be', 'practically', 'everything', 'incontact', 'can', 'toss', 'military', 'tanks', 'ease', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'sight', 'watch', 'Also', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'scenes', 'when', 'Hulk', 'jumping', 'mountains', 'canyons', 'point', 'stop', 'ask', 'jumping', 'flying', 'little', 'overdone', 'nevertheless', 'have', 'big', 'screen', 'television', 'sight', 'enjoy.Overall', 'movie', 'just', 'bad', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'sit', 'entire', '2', 'hour', '18', 'minute', 'run', '15-20', 'minutes', 'non-stop', 'action', '1:30', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'awake', 'Hulk', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'impressive', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'went', 'wrong', 'mentioned', 'Thankfully', 'summer', ""'08"", 'new', 'Hulk', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'chances', 'are', 'same', 'mistakes', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'repeated', 'thanks', 'entirely', 'new', 'crew', 'cast', 'Watch', 'first', 'Hulk', 'film', 'can', 'dare', 'chances', 'are', 'become', 'forgotten', 'good.Acting', '2.5Action', '4Characters', '1.5Story', '1.5Overall', '2']",N/A

This movie was rightly ignored by audiences, even though the critics couldn't praise it enough (as if we needed any further proof that movie critics don't live in the real world). But let's face it, what professional critic would dare to disparage Ang Lee?I'm a big believer that a movie should be judged on its own merits, not in comparison to what we should have ""expected"" from a certain director, actor, etc. So let me now describe The Hulk on its own terms, not in relation to the excellent ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"":  ""The Hulk"" is long, boring, flat, uninspired, slow-paced, dark, unmemorable, and it would be depressing if we were ever drawn into the story enough to be depressed by it, which we aren't. The few CGI sequences that the movie attempts are ridiculously cartoon-like and don't fit the overall tone of the movie at all (By contrast, if you want to see minimalistic CGI used to great effect, see Alfonso Cuaron's masterwork, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"").The CGI Hulk only appears three times in the movie, which in retrospect is three times too many. The rest of the time we're treated to Eric Bana's flat, unsympathetic, and completely uncharismatic portrayal of Bruce Banner, which consists of him mumbling things that are supposed to demonstrate how this movie is a ""cautionary tale"" of man's attempts to master the universe through science, or to set up some ""Shakespearian tragedy"" in relation to Banner's father (Nick Nolte), who's also the villain Electro-Man or something.Some reviewers here who love the movie claim that the rest of us ""don't get it."" Yes, I get the cautionary tale about science (H.G. Wells could teach Ang Lee a lot about these ""cautionary tales"") and I get the classical father/son king/prince tragedy (just read Homer or Shakespeare, for goodness sake). Not only do these themes not work in the movie, but Lee treats them way too seriously for a movie which is supposed to be about a guy who turns into a 50-foot tall green ape when he gets angry (as Bart Simpson would say, ""At least his shorts stayed on"").I rarely say this, but if you haven't seen this movie, save yourself two-plus hours of your life. I would've walked out of the theater after the first 30 minutes if I didn't have Jennifer Connelly to look at.

584666,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00005JKC3,,"[4, 16]","THE HULK(2003) Directed by Ang Lee. A Universal Picture!!Starring Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Sam Elliott.Through an incredibly complex and lengthy series of events spanning decades, genetic biologist Bruce Banner begins turning into a large green monster at inopportune moments which soon involves his mad scientist mass murdering father, the US Govt., the military and a ""evil"" corporation which secretly controls the country. Soon much Freudianism, proterrorist and anti-American propaganda, the occasional CGI sequence and a certain degree of smashing ensue.This is a film that, though very well, if rather desperately and frantically so, directed with several very pleasing moments of excellent comic book style action--particularly during the picture's fourth 30 minute act never truly succeeds due to several serious conceptual flaws and primarily because its director Lee was a bad choice from the outset. It seems fairly clear that Lee was using the film has a trial run for his later grab at Oscar and Politically Correct Hollywood acceptance BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The basic concept of both films is that things were great and nifty in the 60s under a Democratic President where evil mad scientist terrorists are easily contained through legal means and sheepherders can rump roast each other with carefree abandon but once a Republican gets in office--in the later film Reagan in this film Bush--things just go to hell. Gays get murdered by evil Americans. Terrorist mad scientists, who now resemble Osama Bin Laden, are released. The Govt. is controlled by evil corporations. Persons are detained indefinitely and can be made to disappear and prisoners are tortured. Both Bush and Condelliza Rice appear as characters apparently complicit in the liberal paranoia. There is a Haliburton style corporation. And the main corporate villain left the military to make money in business--which might sound familiar to Julius Streicher readers--and has a suspiciously large nose. How Lee restrained himself from having said character wear a yarmulke one cannot imagine. Those darn ""neocons"" are everywhere!! Oh and innocent people turn into large green monsters.On the face of it, one is surprised that the film was not forced into being a major critical success ala BBM until one realizes that Lee made three fundamental errors. In spite of an unrelenting strictly by the Party line talking point attack on the Bush administration, Lee 1) presents the US military is a fairly positive light valiantly striving to protect the American citizen from death and destruction as well as being reasonably efficient and effective--which, of course, is anathema to the groups Lee was trying to court and 2) placing an a verbal attack on same and the country that could have been delivered with little alteration by anyone from Cindy Sheehan to Ted Kennedy in the mouth of the film's villain--thus rendering it ineffective from a propaganda point of view and finally 3) putting all of the above in a film about a large green monster---which is not really the type of vehicle such forces like to work in. Gay sheepherders are far more appealing to the pseudo sophisticates.Plus the film just simply has far too much baggage designed to make it acceptable to the parlor pinks. There is all this rubbish going on about the relationship between Banner and his father, Betty Ross and her father General Ross, Bruce and Betty, suppressed emotions and memories and some new age gobbledeegook about reaching one's inner potential. There is nearly an hour of rushed jumping through the hoops exposition before the Hulk (only called by that name once in the film and almost as an afterthought) finally makes his first appearance. The film tends to be a talk fest with the occasional token Hulk appearances to justify the title and presumably keep the great unwashed in their seats for the primary indoctrination sessions. The film runs nearly two hours and thirty minutes when easily an hour could have been snipped.To be sure, the film does have elements from the book so presumably someone had some familiarity with the character. The aforementioned long fight between the Hulk and the military is spectacular and worth the effort of viewing the film. The sequence set in 1966 is, though a perversion, is from the last page of the original HULK story. Though here instead of a repentant communist destroying a Soviet base with a nuclear explosion, it is an irate American destroying an American one. The Nick Nolte character eventually turns into a, if a rather snobby, version of The Absorbing Man. And the film does use the correct names.But they are the names only. Bruce Banner--played by the incredibly dull Bana--Betty Ross--played well by Connelly though as the de riquer STRONG INDEPENDENT PERFECT FEMALE--and Glenn Talbot are unrecognizable and might as well be called Bob, Mary and Ted. Nick Nolte's mad scientist character is incoherent. One rarely understands either his motivations or, frequently, just what the heck he is saying. The film also favors and takes elements and lines from the failed HULK TV program of the 70s. So one has a failure imitating a failure. Sam Elliott, though perhaps a tad too calm as General Ross--gives the best performance leading a gravitas to the proceedings whenever he is on screen. The film never has the Hulk speak thus depriving the viewer of the character's great iconic dialogue. The Hulk is also far too large in the film being somewhere around 30 feet tall when the character was usually around 8 to 10 feet in the book. Thus the film comes across as being the first American Japanese giant monster film rather than about the Hulk. There is also the very silly idea that the Hulk, instead of getting stronger as his anger increases, expanding in size like a large green balloon in one case breaking an opponent's jaw by suddenly expanding his shoulder size like sometype of inflatable shoulder pad. Oh and is it really necessary to point out that anyone who detonates a nuclear device on US soil killing Lord knows how many people is NEVER going to be released from jail..even with a Republican in office!!!This is a film as a primary example of the dangers of letting a so called genius near anything even remotely entertaining. One wishes a ""mere"" hack had been given the film instead so Lee could go somewhere else to suck up to the Gay Agenda crowd and get his Oscar. The sequel was a far superior effort because it remembered something that Lee forgot a superhero film should be.Fun.Truly complexity is the first refuge of scoundrels.And it could have been all so easy.Bruce Banner exposed to a Gamma Bomb explosion.Whenever he is angry or afraid turns into the Incredible Hulk.And then Hulk smashes.Hulk is the strongest one there is.Hulk likes beans.Very simple.Instead all we get are the beans.See it when one has some time to kill.",1,"When liberals eat beans, this is the result.",1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,6920,"['HULK', '2003', 'Directed', 'Ang',

I'm sure Ang Lee was trying to make this film seem thoughtful and deep, but he came a lot closer to mere incoherence.We start out with lots of images of fancy lab equipment and mysterious experiments, then add in a bunch of mysterious, incomplete character images.  If it weren't so damn boring, it might have pigued my interest.  We all know that the Hulk's coming, but how do the pieces fit together?  At least thayt's what I might have thought if there had been anything to make me care. Instead, I just wished they'd get on with it.  And when they finally do get the big green guy on the screen, there was nothing good enough to redeem the lost time.  In fact, even the Hulk sceens got pretty monotonous after a while.Oh yeah--  The split screen thing to give it a comic book look was a nice idea, but it didn't work at all.  It's just gives me another reason to want to turn it off.There's a whole disc full of special features, but by the time I'd finished the movie, I really didn't care to watch them.Maybe hard core Hulk fans would like this movie, or maybe they'd be disgusted with the blown opportunities.

Now I can move on.Someone must have intentionally tried to make this a bad movie. I don't understand how else you could take this incredible cast, insanely large budget, award-winning action and drama director, and a largely franchised character retelling the classic story of Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, and flush it into the toilet on such a horrible waste of time?The CGI, beyond looking fake, used the cheapest trick to hide their own faults: everything happened at night! Only one or two really good fights scenes were filmed in daylight, and those were the ones prepared for the trailer.The acting was wooden and yawn inspiring. Connelly is a good actress, and here she is reduced to staring wide eyed in a display of insipidness. Nolte is his typical, big monologue delivering self.The writers destroyed a story that was perfectly good to begin with, by writing something other than a hulk movie. The tried to write a drama, or a psych exam, or some other garbage. I can't tell for certain, since they obviously failed at their task of getting whatever misguided message across that they were wasting their time on. Themes of father abandonment, and legacy were bandied about. Interesting for a movie where the original story never really featured much of a father figure, considering he was written as dead before the series began. Also, since this movie was so deadly serious all the time, let me point out two words from one of the many fight scenes at night: Mutant Poodle.Cinematography? No savior there either. Those cute tricks with split screens and jagged frames were as annoying to watch as I am sure they were annoying to shoot and edit.You can simulate this movie at home. All you need is a picture of Jennifer Connelly (face only), and an audiobook read by Nolte. Then sit in a chair, staring at the picture while playing the audiobook. Every 2 minutes place the picture at a jarring angle. Every 25 minutes, turn off the lights and grunt a lot for 5 minutes. Then resume staring at the picture, while listening to the Nolte tape. This is a PERFECT recreation of the film. Just follow those steps for 3 hours.I wish Ang Lee had just come to my house, turned out the lights, kicked me in the groin, and took twenty bucks outta my wallet. Would of been less painful then what he put me through with this film.P.S. For those of you saying the only people complaining are whining because this wasn't an action flick, I say YES we are.

584672,A39C66NHY99BR1,B00005JKC3,,"[5, 8]","&quot;HULK&quot; by filmmaker Ang Lee isn't a film for everyone.  It's not for the kiddies, it certainly isn't for comic purists, and people looking for dumb blockbuster-style fun will be sorely disappointed.  However, Lee has re-envisioned the comic book opera by treating it with as much seriousness as it deserves (it's a *drama*, folks!) and come out with something new and refreshing, not to mention reflective of a better time for moviegoing--specifically, he's recalled the genre of the 1930s-40s Universal horror film, i.e. &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; certainly, though updated it to the 21st century--pretty much only in its vastly superior special effects and budget.Bruce Banner, introverted scientist, has spent his life subconsciously working toward the answers to questions that have plagued him since childhood--&quot;Who am I, why am I here?&quot; and the answers--in the form of an egomaniacal father and a misunderstood manifestation of Banner's brutish id--frighten him, justifiably so.  Monsters abound in the script (in different ways--David Banner, Bruce, Talbot, Ross), and nobody's totally innocent or entirely 'good' or 'evil' as such, they're three-dimensional iterations that really make you think.When the Hulk displays his vast powers for the camera, he's every bit the creature from the comics, leaping vast distances through panoramic desert vistas, exploding through labyrinthine corridors of a government base, smashing and destroying a lab by virtue of his size just as well as his fists--it's all terrific eye-candy.  The film dares you to understand his all-too-human conflicted nature--the Hulk, flawed much like us, cannot forget the past his father inflicted upon him, just like the nanomeds that combined with the gamma radiation and Banner's own biology to create him, will not, as their often fatal flaw, forget.

For starters, the movie has a very slow moving and boring pace for the first hour, and the movie is 2 and a half hours long! The actors are all wooden, Eric Bana who plays Bruce Banner can't act worth a damn. Jennifer Connely who plays Betty Banner was acted like a Barbie doll and just as life-less. Nick Nolte plays a very annoying and crazy character, who talks onscreen to death, and he looked like a dirty bum to boot.There were lots of children watching this movie in the theatre I went to, and many of them looked bored and confused. The action sequences were scarce and pointless, not to mention DARK. They should have had more action scenes in the daytime. The point of this movie was just to show off the computer animation. And I admit that the special effects were good, but that alone cannot carry this garbage!

584674,A2X3IT1PUWYMQY,B00005JKC3,,"[6, 10]","It's ironic that the star of this &quot;movie&quot; is a strong, enormous, solid, smart superhero. The film itself is the complete opposite. It is weak, tiresome, stretched-out, and hopelessly inane.I rarely give one-star reviews, because I truly understand that it is hard to make a good movie these days, and it takes great effort from all involved. I even gave two stars to SHOWGIRLS because it at least tried to be entertaining despite of its ineptitude. But I haven't an ounce of sympathy for this turgid waste of time.The problem with the story is that there really is no story. Right from the get-go, each scene of this 140-minute monstrosity is like a cesspool, stinking to high heavens with monotone dialogue that no real human-being would ever speak in. Every single scene seems like part of an extended trailer for a bigger, better movie.The first hour or so of the film is slow-moving. This would be fine if this time were used for exposition or character development. After all, who wants to see an action movie where you don't care about any of the stars? Well, in this first hour, we basically watch actors read lines. Bad lines. What's more, there is gratuitous use of split-screens and other comic book conventions throughout. This can be a cool effect to set the tone for a film (e.g. CREEPSHOW, NARC), but here it just comes off annoying.We're introduced to Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) and his &quot;love interest&quot; Betty (Jennifer Connely), using the term loosely because there is no chemistry between them at all. Don't blame the actors, because with a screenplay this moronic, I don't think any actor, living or dead, at the top of their game, could have given a believable performance. Sam Elliot, usually an excellent character actor, is just a cardboard cutout in a military outfit in HULK. Meanwhile, Nick Nolte is left with some lines he can scream in anger. Whoa, their Nick! Save some of that for your agent for putting you in this flop!But once the &quot;action&quot; scenes roll along, they make you wish these idiots would start talking again. All the unconvincing CGI effects that fill the screen begin to mold together after a while, and you can't tell what's going on anymore. When an action scene seems like it's going to be nifty, such as the much bally-hooed &quot;tank-throwing&quot; sequence, it ends up going on for waaay too long until you're just praying one of those dumb smart missiles will hit the green beast and put us out of our misery.However, in this abyss of retarded pretentiousness, nothing can possibly outstink the utter foulness of the climax. After 140 minutes of corny dialogue and Z-grade special effects, we come to find out there is NO ENDING! Did that guy die? Why did that lake freeze? What are we looking at? Is that a giant hand coming out of the sky? In the end, it just doesn't really matter.Trust me. Save your money. If you really must see it, steal it. Don't pay money to rent it. Seeing this movie for free is still a rip-off.

584678,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B00005JKC3,,"[7, 11]","Oh man, where do I begin?  I think I have probably seen just about every major superhero-themed movie that's come out in the past 20 or 30 years or so. Some are really good, some are really bad.  This one, however, gets the dubious honor of being the absolute worst I have ever seen.  I mean, there is practically nothing about this movie that I found appealing, at all.  The only thing that even comes close is just the fact that Jennifer Connelly is in it, but even the loveliness of her presence can't save this one (go rent ""The Rocketeer"" if you want to see her in a super hero-ish movie that's actually good).So again I ask, where do I begin?  Well, let's start with the overall pace of the movie.  Although I realize that origin and exposition and all that good stuff is essential, especially when introducing a hero, it's done at such an excruciatingy slow and boring pace that by the time Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk, I really just don't care anymore, and unfortunately there's nothing after that to recapture my interest.  The action sequences are disappointing, and really badly done (especially the ""climactic"" scene at the end, in which Bruce battles his father).  Really uninteresting script altogether, if you ask me.Another big miss for me is the effects.  The Hulk looks really goofy and cartoonish, and his size seems to be sort of inconsistent.  He looks less like the Hulk, and more like the Jolly Green Giant on Steroids.  And as I mentioned before, the battle scene at the end is just super-lame.  You never really get to see a good shot of what his father is supposed to look like, and the camera shots of them fighting are so dark and choppy you have no idea what the hell is going on.Now, if all of the above wasn't bad enough, here's what REALLY killed it for me: the split-screens.  Oh dear lord, the split screens!  If you think the show ""24"" overuses this effect, wait till you see this!  They are thrown in almost every few seconds, seemingly for no apparent reason.  At one point in the movie, I was actually saying to myself ""Please, no more split-screens, no more split-screens!"", and sure enough, here comes another one!  I was seriously on the verge of having a Lewis Black-style psycho breakdown, they're so annoying.  I was told later that it was apparently supposed to create the effect of a comic book, but all it did for me was create the strong urge to smash the television like the big green guy himself.  Please Ang Lee, I'm begging you, don't ever do this again!!!!!So yeah, in case you haven't figured it out yet, I really didn't care much for this one. I'm really hoping that the sequel with Edward Norton is much better, although truthfully it couldn't possibly be worse.  I think I'd rather watch ""Batman & Robin"" ten times in a row than to subject myself to this again.

This movie was too moody, crowded with scientific goobledygook, and in some parts really scary.  When Bruce Banner flash-backed to his childhood and recalled the death of his mother, it was a big downer -- and not received well by my kid.  Don't bring the young un's to this poor effort. . . and don't buy this either.  Look for Spidey, X Men or even Daredevil.UNFAITHFUL:  Not a good take on the comic.  I do not like the way they have changed the storyline.  The real origin of the hulk was not some horrific genetic infliction by a mad scientist, but really in various facets -- an accident.  Hulking is an accident, by all other accounts.  The movie poorly portays and confuses the various Hulk characters, making them what they never were in the comic, adds all new elements for it's own sake. It drags the story so long. . .SLOW:  The special effects were good, but it took a long time to get the movie going, and there was too little action I think.  The movie goes on and on trying to justify it's own take on the hulk myth, twisting it badly, and it does a poor job of relating the comic.  Bad job by the director.  Boo.ACTORS:  One thing I did like -- Bana's performance as Bruce and Sam Elliot as the general were great.  Nick Nolte was just nuts.  Creepy.DISAPPOINTED:  Not what I expected for a Marvel movie.  I had high hopes, having seen the outstanding effort on X2 earlier this summer just after I got back.

lingering in my mind , and so it was naturally to be very excitedwhen i have heard the pre news about the Hulk's movie being in pre production, I have waited for the official trailer to appear and after i have seenit i begun to worry about the quality of the CGI creature , and then themovie was released and i have been overwhelmed by the mixed reviews bothfrom Critics and the Audience , which resulted in my enthuasism for the moviea less hotter till i decided to give the movie a visit .With the first moments of the movie i have been totally hooked by the awesomecredits rolling and the fast pace of the first fifteen minuets , while wewatch the complicated story while unleashing and forming , the story aboutthe biotechnology scientist Bruce (Eric Bana) who is teaming with his exlove interest Betty (Jeniffer Connelly) on a scientific project , but Bruce'spast is shady and full of mysteries , his parents has been dead for longtime since he was a kid ( or that what he thinks so) and he is having strangenightmares , one day he is exposed to Gamma radiations by accident and thisaccident unleashes the furious power within him , and the arrival of themysterious late shift worker in the lab (Nick Nolte) means that his darkpast's secrets is about to be unfolded , but he has to face them ,discoverhis true origin and learns to control his rage .Ang lee has done a very great job in this movie , he is a director whichi call is a (poetic director) , that means directing his movies with poeticvision which enhances his view , and adds more haunting sense to the storyand to the movie itself , you can't help but admiring his complicated techniquesincluding the usage of multiple views to give the Audience the feeling ofthe comics , also he tried to balance between the commercial needs of thesummer movies , the requirements of the fans and his solid rules as a directorwith a solid vision .The casting was simply perfect , i remember when i first heard about castingEric Bana as the Hulk i was worried about his portraying for the superhero, but actually he is very brilliant actor , he really was very convincingin the rage moments which made you feel he is really suffering , and forJeniffer Connelly all i can say that she is cute as usual and very emotionalactor which gave the movie a sense of tenderness which worked as a contradictionfor the ultimate roughness of The Hulk , for Nick Nolte he really surprisedme with his performance and he sat a new rules for this kind of roles ( iwill not reveal it here).So what actually went wrong with this movie? we all know that he suffereda very large drop in the second week of it's box office's run , i thinkthat was simply because this movie is not a multiplexes crowds pleaser ,Ang Lee directed this movie with a very brilliant approach to the SOUL ofthe Hulk , because the Hulk character in general is not only about the greengiant smashing objects and roaring a scary scream , it's about the humansoul , and the continuing  search for every man's true identity within himself, those added a very deep meaning to the movie which was not convenientfor the summer's audience , he also focused on the eyes , because as theysay that the eye is the mirror of the soul , and in multiple shots we seeBruce staring to himself in the Bathroom's mirror and we a reflection ofhis true identity in the mirror , his true self which he is trying to discoverand learns how to control .For me i had just minor problems with the movie , the plot actually is notsimply straightforward , it's inter complicated and unfolds itself duringthe duration of the movie , but in the unfolding process there were someloose ends that were not connected properly , also i found the CGI Effectsis satisfactory except for a few scenes (in the desert) which needed rendering, and the last glitch i found is the almost unsatisfactory last 10 minuetswhich needed some more work .The Hulk is one of the best summer's blockbusters to come in the past fewyears , it's rare to see a blockbuster which respects the minds of it'saudience , and gives them something with a value , something with a Heartand a Soul .",4,The eye is the mirror of the

Ang Lee,Eric Bana and all others involved did a reprehensible job with their interpretation.Bruce Banner is supposed to be a scientist.Eric Bana couldn't even convince me he barely graduated high school.At least Bill Bixby made me (and millions of others) believe that he knew alot about science and medicine.

584683,AFEU1F4TXQWKL,B00005JKC3,Alan V. Dunkin,"[1, 1]","The Hulk Movie ReviewBy Alan DunkinAt the core of The Hulk is a dark, repressed comic book movie featuring a very large, very green, very computer-generated Hulk. A lot has gone into the fact that The Hulk would be completely computer-generated, that the director (Ang Lee) would be creating something a kind of movie he had never done before. The movie alters or changes the Hulk canon in subtle and blatant ways - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Furthermore, the Bruce Bixby/Lou Ferrigno late 1977 TV movie and offspring would taint many potential viewers, presenting a very different Hulk than the comic.What Ang Lee created is an interestingly crafted movie that, while a little weak on plot, delivers a lot of anger, action, and animosity. In the 1960s young David Banner (Paul Kersey) begins experimentation on various regeneration technologies despite objections by young Colonel Ross (Todd Tesen). Banner, not to be nonplussed, decides to further his experiments, apparently on his son, Bruce. After a tragic event involving Edith Banner (Bruce's mother), David goes to prison while Bruce is shipped to an adopted family and takes the name of Krensler.Flash forward about thirty years and Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) and Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) are doing engaged in (you guessed it) scientific experiments, very similar to the type that David did, though Bruce knows nothing of his tragic past. Through an accident David gets irradiated with gamma radiation and something to do with nanotechnology in a somewhat confusing sequence, and things start to go rapidly downhill from there. Due to David's experiments, the nanobots (or whatever they are called), and the gamma radiation, an angry trigger can set off a chain reaction that transforms David into a very tall, very big Hulk.David's (Nick Nolte) return serves in many ways as a major catalyst for these changes. Eventually the military gets involved, featuring Betty's father, now General Ross (Sam Elliott). Of course, there are series of confrontations, battles, and the occasional ambiguous scene before the movie is all said and over with.First off, ILM's Hulk is quite good, despite what you may have seen or think you saw in trailers. Yes, you can tell he's not real, but they've done a really good job of giving him muscular detail, facial expressions, and of course purple shorts. In particular, scenes where he's trying to see through a cloud of dust or gets knocked over by a tank round, the look of confusion or pain on his face is frankly wonderful to behold. Other CGI creations, notably the ""gamma dogs,"" are a little on the far side as far as believability, though the surprise addition of a comic book opponent is well envisioned.Secondly, the unique editing of The Hulk. Most will refer to it as a 24 (as in the TV series) style, showing multiple images in the same frame. However The Hulk takes this to a whole new level, even zooming out across a whole panel of images before zooming back into another, multiple same-image transitions, and other ways of moving between shot to shot. This is from the very beginning of the movie, in the credits sequence. Frankly, I didn't find it annoying and enjoyed how well the whole comic book feel of the editing came across. Others may feel it overly detracts from the movie.The acting is slightly uneven; Bana and Connolly offer good but not great performances; Sam Elliott is hard-as-nails great as Ross, though Nick Nolte is over-the-top as David Banner. Especially near the end. Josh Lucas, as Talbot, overdoes it a bit as well.Generally speaking The Hulk could use a bit more plot, as it's fairly simple and straightforward and doesn't require a whole lot, though it sure seems like it takes awhile to get there. Many plot points need serious clarification.Once Banner changes into the Hulk for the first time, it feels like the movie has really started (about forty-five minutes in). However, the dark and brooding feel of the movie is omnipresent - everything evolves around hate and repression in one form or another. Bruce represses his childhood memories. Talbot hates, and Ross hates Bruce because he is David's son. Betty feels repressed by her father, and anger is how the Hulk comes to being. David feels hate for pretty much everything one way or another.The action sequences are all well done. There are a number of quibbles that involve David Banner's ability to use modern technology right after thirty-odd years in prison, as well as the fact that the Hulk never really kills anyone, even in situations where that should have been a given. The Hulk's bounding ability is probably a bit over-exaggerated. The F-22 sequence is a bit funky.What can I say though, this is a good movie - it is definitely not what most would expect from this director, this type of movie, or even this genre. It's an interesting mix and change of speed for director Ang Lee, and a lot of people may be disappointed there isn't more ""Hulk smash!"" going on. I however definitely recommend it.",4,The Hulk Reviewed,1056153600,"06 21, 2003",2003,5023,"['Hulk', 'Movie', 'ReviewBy', 'Alan', 'DunkinAt', 'core', 'Hulk', 'dark', 'repressed', 'comic', 'book',

584684,ABO182YN0SC67,B00005JKC3,albino_squirrel,"[2, 2]","I wanted to see this movie for the two following reasons: I was curious as to whether or not it could be done successfully, and with Ang Lee as director, given the source material, how could I not see it?First of all, the acting was definitely serviceable.  Eric Bana is suitably nondescript in a brilliant, brooding, geeky way so evocative of comics superheroes and the fans that love (and undeniably relate to) them.  Jennifer Conelly looks like a superhero's girlfriend and is so skinny, angular, and beautiful that the fleshtones of women in graphic novels everywhere have most likely turned green as the Hulk's epidermis.  Nick Nolte is deliciously demented, but I couldn't help but recall mental images of his infamous mugshot about 5 dozen times throughout the duration of the film. As for the supporting cast, the characters all have the right ""look"" and carriage for the film and they never detract from the flow of the movie.The special effects were remarkably  impressive, and though I've heard some complaints about the Hulk's movements during certain scenes, I thought the CG's were always well-executed and fluid, and I'm rather picky when it comes to CGI.  In this department, Hulk did not disappoint.I know the movie seemed overlong and stretched to essentially nothing to many viewers, but after some thought, I decided that the movie was not unecessarily long for my tastes.  Hulk is based on a lot of source material, and to do the characters and story justice and not trivialize the ""reality"" of their fictional universe, the movie had to be substantial in content and length.Furthermore, many relationships and themes were developed throughout the 2 1/2 hour timespan thus keeping the story consistently relevant and meaningful.  We have man vs. himself (Bruce battling his emotional demons), man vs. nature (Bruce in conflict with his wayward DNA) man vs. man (Bruce vs. his father, Betty's father, and the creepy Atheon guy who's name I forget), etc. . .Besides these obvious archetypes, Bruce must take on the might of the government and its military, a hyperbolic example of the individual fighting for his right to exist without the threat of force breathing down his neck.  Bruce battles with scientific industrialization and a corporation (Atheon) that's overly-concerned with profits and scientific advancement while neglecting to consider if their goals SHOULD be pursued or not and if they are ethical as far as Bruce and humanity as a whole are concerned.  Bruce wages war on his father, a man who is so consumed with knowledge for knowledge's sake that he immolates any real connection he has with his fellow man, and he is long past contemplating whether or not his scientific exploits are based on integrity and scientific advancement or only on his need to prove that he CAN bring his burning obsession to life.Freud is written all over this movie.  Bruce is emotionally impotent, and he is bursting at the seams with repressed memories.  He is in conflict with a father who turned Bruce's life into a carbon copy of a Greek tragedy, and the Orpheus complex that is his life threatens to eat him alive.  I won't spoil the ending of the movie by providing too much detail, but considering the elements of nature and the extremely dark tone and colors used, it is easy to regard the final climactic battle as one human being in elemental conflict with a very primitive, fundamental element of his own psyche, his unresolved relationship with his father, and even with the totality of nature and the inevitable progression of existence itself.  I mention the latter because Bruce is at odds with something he cannot shake, that is, his own genetic structure, and such structure, especially when we consider Bruce's condition, mental illness, and congenital defects, can truly be considered a prison, a horrible dampening of free will and human potential.Or maybe I think too much.  Regardless, the fact that the movie even sparked such deliberation of thought in my own mind indicates to me that it reached me in a good way, and even if my opinions are misguided, at least the movie has stuck with me on some level.I'd recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate it on a level that exists beyond special effects, explosions, and action sequences.  Sure, the panels and splitscreens were neat, but they hardly made the movie for me, and I was more engrossed in the characters, conflicts, and themes than in anything visual.",4,More hits than misses.,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,4460,"['wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'two', 'following', 'reasons', 'was', 'curious', 'not', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'successfully', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'director', 'given', 'source', 'material', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'First', 'all', 'acting', 'was', 'definitely', 'serviceable', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'suitably', 'nondescript', 'brilliant', 'brooding', 'geeky', 'way', 'so', 'evocative', 'comics', 'superheroes', 'fans', 'love', 'undeniably', 'relate', 'Jennifer', 'Conelly', 'superhero', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'skinny', 'angular', 'beautiful', 'fleshtones', 'women', 'graphic', 'novels', 'everywhere', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'turned', 'green', 'Hulk', 'epidermis', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'deliciously', 'demented', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'recall', 'mental', 'images', 'infamous', 'mugshot', '5', 'dozen', 'times', 'duration', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'have', 'right', 'look', 'carriage', 'film', 'never', 'detract', 'flow', 'movie.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'remarkably', 'impressive', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'complaints', 'Hulk', 'movements', 'certain', 'scenes', 'thought', 'CG', 'were', 'always', 'well-executed', 'fluid', ""'m"", 'rather', 'picky', 'when', 'CGI', 'department', 'Hulk', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.I', 'know', 'movie', 'seemed', 'overlong', 'stretched', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'many', 'viewers', 'thought', 'decided', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'unecessarily', 'long', 'tastes', 'Hulk', 'based', 'lot', 'source', 'material', 'do', 'characters', 'story', 'justice', 'not', 'trivialize', 'reality', 'fictional', 'universe', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'substantial', 'content', 'length.Furthermore', 'many', 'relationships', 'themes', 'were', 'developed', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'timespan', 'thus', 'keeping', 'story', 'consistently', 'relevant', 'meaningful', 'have', 'man', 'vs.', 'Bruce', 'battling', 'emotional', 'demons', 'man', 'vs.', 'nature', 'Bruce', 'conflict', 'wayward', 'DNA', 'man', 'vs.', 'man', 'Bruce', 'father', 'Betty', 'father', 'creepy', 'Atheon', 'guy', 'who', 'name', 'forget', 'etc', 'obvious', 'archetypes', 'Bruce', 'must', 'take', 'might', 'government', 'military', 'hyperbolic', 'example', 'individual', 'fighting', 'right', 'exist', 'threat', 'force', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'Bruce', 'scientific', 'industrialization', 'corporation', 'Atheon', 'overly-concerned', 'profits', 'scientific', 'advancement', 'neglecting', 'consider', 'goals', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'pursued', 'not', 'are', 'ethical', 'as', 'far', 'Bruce', 'humanity', 'whole', 'are', 'concerned', 'Bruce', 'war', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'consumed', 'knowledge', 'knowledge', 'sake', 'real', 'connection', 'fellow', 'man', 'long', 'contemplating', 'not', 'scientific', 'exploits', 'are', 'based', 'integrity', 'scientific', 'advancement', 'only', 'need', 'prove', 'CAN', 'bring', 'burning', 'obsession', 'life.Freud', 'written', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'emotionally', 'impotent', 'bursting', 'seams', 'repressed', 'memories', 'conflict', 'father', 'who', 'turned', 'Bruce', 'life', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'Orpheus', 'complex', 'life', 'eat', 'alive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'movie', 'providing', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'considering', 'elements', 'nature', 'extremely', 'dark', 'tone', 'colors', 'used', 'easy', 'regard', 'final', 'climactic', 'battle', 'one', 'human', 'being', 'elemental', 'conflict', 'very', 'primitive', 'fundamental', 'element', 'own', 'psyche', 'unresolved', 'relationship', 'father', 'even', 'totality', 'nature', 'inevitable', 'progression', 'existence', 'mention', 'latter', 'Bruce', 'odds', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'own', 'genetic', 'structure', 'such', 'structure', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'Bruce', 'condition', 'mental', 'illness', 'congenital', 'defects', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'considered', 'prison', 'horrible', 'dampening', 'free', 'will', 'human', 'potential.Or', 'maybe', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'Regardless', 'fact', 'movie', 'even', 'sparked', 'such', 'deliberation', 'thought', 'own', 'mind', 'reached', 'good', 'way', 'even', 'opinions', 'are', 'misguided', 'least', 'movie', 'stuck', 'level.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'level', 'special', 'effects', 'explosions', 'action', 'sequences', 'Sure', 'panels', 'splitscreens', 'were', 'neat', 'hardly', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'engrossed', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'themes', 'anything', 'visual']",N/A

584687,A1XSW26YGZB1X6,B00005JKC3,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","First off: a longtime Marvel comic reader here and pretty devoted Hulk fan from way back.  Ang Lee (best known as the artist behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) took a venerated comic institution and actually tackled his soul, and not just in the predictable ""you wouldn't like me when I'm angry"" way.Like the Wachowskis, it seems nobody remembered to tell Lee the ""correct"" way to tell a complex, multilayered, thought-provoking story in the context of a cutting-edge action movie, so he clearly made most of it up on his own.  And don't let the negative reviews sway you-- it WORKS, right down to the unspoken looks between Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly.  Lee is clearly very much aware of what's he adapting and its place in American pop culture -much of the cinematography presents the drama in the form of multiple ""panels"" that occasionally distract but nonetheless bridge the plot points and keep bringing the audience along with the inexorable feeling of excited page-turning.  Also like its parent medium, the movie is actually pretty sparse on dialogue and long on visual artwork, from close-ups of lichen to the gnarled and twisted roots of forest trees.Anger is clearly a subject near and dear to the hearts of many -let's face it, how many of us entertain the fantasy of ""hulking up"" and destroying every fax machine, partition, and conference room at the office?  There is some pretty unmistakable wish-fulfillment going on here; the sudden, explosive lash-out by the nerdy outsider who's been picked on for too long. The movie also kicks around the dangers of genetic manipulation, but in a way with which we're now pretty familiar, having digested the ethics lessons of ""Jurassic Park"" and even last summer's ""Spider-Man.""  The overreach of the military/law enforcement and its ties to Big Business are also addressed, but not in the expected manner...there isn't a single decisive villain in the bunch.That's the expected stuff.  But Lee also doesn't hesitate to hold some darker and more personal issues up to the light for an uncomfortable audience to examine -repressed memories, for starters.  Or the phenomenon of a wall of emotional detachment that happens in even the closest relationships, and the accompanying postulate that long-term emotional damage can ultimately be far deadlier than any physical injury -still not a widely accepted axiom, even in the scientific world.  Finally, Lee handles the sensitive notion of confronting one's own long-buried demons in the form of having a face-to-face confrontation with one's father.  There are hints of child abuse, child abandonment, and even the disturbing reality that not all parents are automatically emotionally bonded to their own children...Nick Nolte's climactic over-the-top portrayal of the ethically-challenged David Banner dovetails with the equally dysfunctional relationship between General Ross (Sam Elliot) and his estranged daughter Betty.As I said, there's a lot of meat in this one, which is probably the reason for the onslaught of bad reviews.  If you were expecting light fare with a crystal-clear delineation of good versus evil, then The Hulk will not deliver.  There isn't a decisive villain to be found in the story, nor are there any halos hovering over the ""good guys.""  Having said that, this movie is still worth spending your money on- Newcomer Bana is fascinating to watch, whether he's six feet tall or sixteen feet, the CGI is sharp and clear (in spite of some fans' earlier fears), and the desert chase scenes, besides being lifted straight from the pages of the original comic book, do leave you gasping for breath.  In short, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and fully intend to pay full price to own the DVD when that comes along.  If that puts me in the minority, so be it.",4,"Great movie.

584691,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00005JKC3,Andre Dursin,"[8, 9]","It's hard to imagine that there has been or ever will be a super-hero movie that divides as many viewers as Ang Lee's ambitious 2003 filming of THE HULK.From the pre-release buzz about how Lee had taken a revisionist tact with the origin of the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby Marvel comic book hero, to the first, fleeting -- and unfinished -- glimpses of the all-CGI green one during the Super Bowl, the comics-to- movie community had been eagerly awaiting, and debating, the big-budget film. Early reactions ranged from utter disgust to complete and total admiration, which brings me to my thoughts on the film -- one which ended up being sent to the Marvel scrap heap in lieu of a 2008 movie that pretended (basically) this film never happened.Before I dive into specifics, I can say that I was first appalled when I heard about the concept of Lee and James Schamus' version. Having grown up on the old Bill Bixby-Lou Ferrigno show, plus the various cartoon incarnations, the idea that Bruce Banner became the Hulk courtesy of his father's attempts to play God, to the mystery surrounding his mother's death, to the Hulk being able to leap tall buildings with a single bound -- all of them were pretty hard to swallow considering my youthful memories of the Incredible Hulk.While what Lee and Schamus (along with credited co-writers Michael France and John Turman) have come up with is at times too dark for its own good, and is overly bogged down in psychological aspects that don't quite come off, THE HULK is still an ambitious, flawed, but always watchable combination of silly, colorful Marvel Comics action and a study of parents and children and what makes us all tick.Sound like a jumbled mess? Well, it works better than you might have heard. Eric Bana essays Bruce Banner, a California research scientist who works alongside former lover Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) in a lab for their betterment of mankind. Their work, though, spurs interest from Josh Lucas, who represents an ""evil corporation"" that's also associated with Betty's military dad (Sam Elliott). Enter Bruce's long-lost father (Nick Nolte, appropriately disheveled in one of his best performances in years), who has tracked down his son and wants to make good on the experiments he believes are trapped in his son's DNA. Obviously, it's just a matter of time before Bruce is ticked off and his transformation into the Hulk occurs.When it does, it's a triumph of CGI animation on the part of Industrial Light & Magic, who have fully captured the look and movement of a comic book character on-screen. Unlike the tempering of the X-Men's physical characteristics (i.e. their subdued uniforms), ILM's Hulk isn't a compromise -- it's the animated character captured in its full, colorful glory, and while some may carp that the Hulk doesn't look ""real"" (as if a 20- foot green creature ever could), I found ILM's work to be tremendous here. The Hulk's facial animation is nothing short of outstanding (he's certainly more emotive than Bana's bland Banner), like a combination of Frankenstein's monster and Ferrigno's old muscular creation, and the level of detail in the creature is astounding.That aspect of the movie brings with it some completely absurd sequences -- like the Hulk's battle with gamma-radiated dogs -- but they're completely in tune with the kind of action that anyone who grew up reading Marvel Comics will appreciate seeing on-screen. This Hulk does have the ability to leap into the sky, bound off cliffs and ledges, and dismantle anything that comes in his way, but the FX are great and Lee builds the dramatic conflict between father and son up enough that the movie works if you're willing to meet it halfway -- especially in its almost-indescribable, completely ""comic book"" final confrontation between the two.Getting to that point does require some patience, as Lee spends a great deal of time establishing the relationships between nutty old man Banner and his bottled up son, not to mention Betty Ross and her military father. It's a little heavy-handed and slow-going at times, but you have to applaud the filmmakers for trying to establish characters and drama in a movie that ultimately turns more outlandish than any comic book film in recent memory.Nolte's ultimately over-the-top performance goes for broke and fits the movie perfectly, as does Elliott's excellent work as Ross' father. Bana and Connelly are OK but don't have much chemistry with one another, and the former is completely overshadowed by the Hulk once the muscular one takes over. One failing of the film is its notable lack of humor -- there should have been an additional supporting player on-hand for the audience to identify with, since every character is overly brooding and wrapped up in the story.Visually, THE HULK benefits from Frederick Elmes' fine cinematography and the use of comic book-styled ""panels"" that keep reminding the viewer that you're watching a comic book movie -- even if the Shakespearian aspects of the script sometimes clash with its pulpy pedigree.Danny Elfman's music, meanwhile, is always serviceable but comes off as uninspired for the composer, sounding like a compromise between what Lee reportedly wanted (is there some point to the female vocalist who wails away on the soundtrack?) and a by-the- numbers Elfman score that has ""auto-pilot"" written all over it (the furious ""lab montage"" motifs reminiscent of ""Darkman,"" the dark and brooding ""Batman""-like aspects, the ""Planet of the Apes"" percussion, etc). While I wasn't a huge fan of Elfman's solid but unremarkable work on ""Spider-Man"", THE HULK unquestionably sounds like the result of one too many trips to the same well for the composer.THE HULK is decidedly uneven but constantly surprising and, in the end, highly satisfying from a number of angles. It's a movie that takes a lot of risks and encompasses a wide range of emotions, and while some are more successful than others, it's certainly one of the most audacious attempts at creating a live-action comic-book that can sustain the interest of both adults and kids. Even with its shortcomings, it's a strongly recommended view.",4,"A Fascinating Film, Just Not a Great ""Comic Book Movie""",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,6147,"['hard', 'imagine', 'been', 'ever',

Instead, what i got was a hugh melo-drama that was attempting to look to artsy fartsy. What was bad was that it didn't just stick to the comic book, there where changes, and not for the better. With X-men and Spiderman, the changes you see (the costumes in x-men - the organic webbing in spidey) where a necessity and chasnges for the better, but no changes to the origins story. In Hulk, i don't remember anything about Bruce's father injecting him with something as a child to help bring the Hulk to life. Why they did this when it was never part of the origin story is beyond me. If they where trying to improve on it, they failed, because you can't improve up on it. The casting of the movie was a brilliant choice.Jenniffer Connoly was top notch as Betty, full of character and emothion, she brought her to life, Nic Nolte was average as the dad. While Eric Bana was a good choice for Bruce, the dialogue and direction used for him impaired him from doing his job properly.

Now, every time Bruce gets angry, the gamma rays still in his body course through his veins and transform him into the Hulk, a booming mass of pure green muscle driven by rage and fueled by anger and frustration at all those trying to hurt him.Bulldozing everything in his path, Hulk tries to outrun those who want a sample of his tissue and those who want him dead.Bruce Banner must face what he's become and come to terms with its effects on his life, especially those on his ex-girlfriend, Betty Ross (played by Jennifer Connelly), and the relationship with her he's trying to salvage.This Ang Lee-directed flick was well done, all in all. It took awhile to get going (the opening credit sequence was especially long), but once it did, things got intense, heavy and also fun.This is a very emotional story. It's a story of domestic abuse, suppressed memories, obsession, confusion, loss and everything in between.If anything, though, it was too emotional.Hulk is a hard character to bring to the screen but given the time allotment he had to convey as much story as possible, Ang Lee did a good job.This is not a good-guy-versus-bad-guy superhero movie. To watch it as one would be doing it a disservice.The comic book-framed shots added to the experience for this reviewer. Likewise, the all-CGI Hulk, once you got used to seeing him (he looks pretty cartoony at first sight), was believable and incredibly, no pun, well done. The way his muscles rippled when he tore stuff apart or flexed, the sweat on his skin, his hair blowing in the breeze--Ah, all good.This film is for true Hulk fans and for the viewer who likes the occasional monster flick or man-on-the-run movie.Hulk smash!A.P.

I have never seen people's opinions so varied!  (One person told me it was ""too artistic""!)  I recommend reading Roger Ebert's review on his webpage, because he gets it right.  The film is about ""children of egomaniacal parents"", and this is what characters Banner and his girlfriend have in common.  It is not so hard to connect one's self with the characters in this film, except that they, too, (as people with individualistic traits) were misunderstood in their childhood.I credit Ang Lee for the art, research, and development of this film.  His pet-project uncannily identifies the Hulk as a modernized classic horror and monster genre tale, and he made it a thing of beauty.  I felt remorse over Banner and his girlfriend for ""the curse of the Hulk"".  (I use quotes because it could've been named ""the Curse Of the Hulk"".)  This movie was as graphic as Beauty And the Beast, the Phantom Of the Opera, Frankenstein's creation and the Bride, Night Of the Demon, King Kong, Curse Of the Werewolf, Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde, or particularly Forbidden Planet's CREATURE OF THE ID.The first scene of Banner turning into the Hulk scared hell into me.  The Hulk wrecked a laboratory like an angry rhino in a china shop, and people would run from the Hulk the way bystanders ran for their lives from a collapsing NYC scyscraper, with another teetering.  I liked the animation of the Hulk, who, in this film, characterizes 5000 pounds of rage.  The metaphor of anger and how it's used is the basis for the Hulk character.  One horrificly fascinating scene is set in a steamy bathroom where Banner peers into the sink mirror and a reflection of the Hulk pulls him through it, and the two fall into a chasm.  These scenes are very adult and obviously more connected to the subconscious rather than reality.The visual technique of the film, with all its artistry and montage sequences, makes quite a cinematic presentation.  (Additionally, Elfman puts in a great score with his signature of electronic instruments.)  Experiencing the movie from the DVD using the DTS track, or from a High Def D-VHS with a large, plasma tv presentation in a dark room gives Hulk extra fright.",4,"Artistic horror film based on comic, NOT the tv series.",1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,2378,"['wish', 'had', 'dollar', 'reference', 'TV', 'show', 'dare', 'write', 'article', 'film', 'here.Maybe', 'Hulk', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'what', 'did', 'something', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'accept', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'people', 'opinions', 'so', 'varied', 'One', 'person', 'told', 'was', 'too', 'artistic', 'recommend', 'reading', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'webpage', 'right', 'film', 'children', 'egomaniacal', 'parents', 'what', 'characters', 'Banner', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'common', 'not', 'so', 'hard', 'connect', 'one', 'self', 'characters', 'film', 'too', 'people', 'individualistic', 'traits', 'were', 'misunderstood', 'childhood.I', 'credit', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'art', 'research', 'development', 'film', 'pet-project', 'uncannily', 'Hulk', 'modernized', 'classic', 'horror', 'monster', 'genre', 'tale', 'made', 'thing', 'beauty', 'felt', 'remorse', 'Banner', 'girlfriend', 'curse', 'Hulk', 'use', 'quotes', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'named', 'Curse', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'graphic', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Frankenstein', 'creation', 'Bride', 'Night', 'Demon', 'King', 'Kong', 'Curse', 'Werewolf', 'Dr.', 'Jekyl', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'particularly', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'CREATURE', 'THE', 'ID.The', 'first', 'scene', 'Banner', 'turning', 'Hulk', 'scared', 'hell', 'Hulk', 'wrecked', 'laboratory', 'angry', 'rhino', 'china', 'shop', 'people', 'would', 'run', 'Hulk', 'way', 'bystanders', 'ran', 'lives', 'collapsing', 'NYC', 'scyscraper', 'teetering', 'liked', 'animation', 'Hulk', 'who', 'film', '5000', 'pounds', 'rage', 'metaphor', 'anger', 'how', 'used', 'basis', 'Hulk', 'character', 'One', 'horrificly', 'fascinating', 'scene', 'set', 'steamy', 'bathroom', 'where', 'Banner', 'sink', 'mirror', 'reflection', 'Hulk', 'two', 'fall', 'chasm', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'adult', 'obviously', 'more', 'connected', 'subconscious', 'rather', 'reality.The', 'visual', 'technique', 'film', 'artistry', 'montage', 'sequences', 'quite', 'cinematic', 'presentation', 'Additionally', 'Elfman', 'great', 'score', 'signature', 'electronic', 'instruments', 'Experiencing', 'movie', 'DVD', 'using', 'DTS', 'track', 'High', 'Def', 'D-VHS', 'large', 'plasma', 'tv', 'presentation', 'dark', 'room', 'Hulk', 'extra', 'fright']",N/A

Wolverton,"[5, 7]","If you're looking for an action movie with an explosion every ten seconds, mindless dialogue, and stupid characters, HULK is NOT the movie for you.That may explain why so many people either didn't like or didn't get the movie.  Based on the Marvel Comics mag ""The Incredible Hulk,"" the film version stays somewhat faithful to the original: Scientist Bruce Banner becomes exposed to gamma rays, causing him to transform into a gigantic green...well, Hulk.  Banner's colleague and former love, Betty Ross, tries to help him discover the mysteries of Banner's power and his troubled past.  The problems mount when Betty's father, four-star General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, is obsessed with putting Banner away, as he did with Banner's father thirty years earlier.What probably bored some movie-goers was the film's slow pace.  A good 45 minutes goes by before any real action happens, but those 45 minutes lay the foundation for the rest of the building.  The performances and the writing are both good, but the screenplay is excellent.  Director Ang Lee knows that any good film (action or otherwise) HAS to focus on characters, and this one does.  Action is not the name of the game here, it's character.  HULK is more about family, relationships, our past, and how we cope with them than it is about a big green galoot tossing tanks around.Lee's use of split-screen and other photographic effects is outstanding.  You really can't imagine telling aspects of this story WITHOUT split-screen.  And Hulk himself?  For me, the look and feel of the character was entirely believable and realistic.On the negative side?  I can't give the movie five starts, but I'd give it 4.5 if I could.  The movie does drag on a little too long and at times tries to cover too much ground.  But the thing that really irks me is Universal's ""Coming Attractions"" that run roughshod over the viewer, not even allowing you to skip to the main menu.  Really irritating, Universal.  I'll remember that the next time I consider purchasing a Universal product.But enough ranting.

This is a very entertaining movie, and while it may not always make a lot of sense, it brings out the wide-eyed kid in all of us as the far-fetched idea of a secretly genetically-enhanced body of young scientist Bruce Banner get a mighty dollop of gamma-ray contamination, and this sends his biochemistry into serious overdrive. By the time the plot finally winds around to a situation when Bruce gets cornered and suddenly becomes enraged, I found the audience around me cheering for the appearance of the unbelievably big and powerful green monstrosity at last.The movie is very well made technically, although the same cannot be said for the drama of the piece. So as the Hulk begins his involuntary rampages, we are awed by the pyrotechnics and sheer overkill innate in a creature of such stunning size and power. Indeed, he is a radical bodybuilder's dream, with an upper body to die for, a veritable nightmare of deltoids, pecs, lats, and incredible traps, a guy with biceps so big he could squash a Studebaker with them. Bu this is guy isn't a circus clown intent on entertaining the public for pocket change. This is a tortured soul with plenty of attitude. And the authorities accommodate that attitude by compounding his pain with angst and anger. So the rampage goes on.Of course, this is all punctuated with the subplots anyone familiar with the comic book series is aware of, and a few new to the twisting and turning plotline. The love interest and humanizing factor in the Hulk's rage is his dimwitted recollection of Banner's erstwhile intellectual foil and main squeeze wanna-be, the lovely Jennifer Connelly, who must be dumbfounded indeed to go from playing the wife of someone with a brilliant mind in her last Oscar winning performance to now being the plaything of a big, brawny green monstrosity here. But she plays it straight, and gives a good performance in a movie that really is a set piece for the big green guy.Another cast members perform equally as well, and one is impressed by the quality of the cast, which includes people like Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, and of course, Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, the Hulk's calmer alter-ego. Ther is also a nice cameo by Lou Ferrigno as a Security Chief that provides a nice  tribute to his former incarnation as the big green guy himself. I recommend this movie, which I view as a great continuation of the old classic monster movies of the 1940s and 195os.

Sure, the movie has it's flaws but I've got to give him props for giving us something different than we were expecting. True, he took some liberties with the source material but, overall, it was true to the comic book. Anyone who's read the Hulk comic book will know that General Ross spent alot of his time going after the character in the comic book. Ang was dead-on in picking Eric Bana for the role of Bruce Banner, in my opinion, as he's a dead-on ringer for the comic book Bruce Banner(minus glasses, of course). I give him credit for fleshing out characters and developing the story so we'd understand things alot more as to why Hulk is on the run all the time. This is a comic-book movie in the truest sense of it. If I had any gripes, whatsoever, it would be that there wasn't as much action in the movie as I'd like it to have. Action as in Hulk battling  and generally wreaking havoc. His battle with his father towards the end wasn't much of a battle at all. Other than that, I thought Hulk was a pretty decent movie.

To like or not to like this film seems to set a precedence with the reviewer as either a bonafide moron or a person who enjoys something that might be a breakthrough in the comic-book to movie industry.Well, I liked it . . . a lot.  Why?This is a film made for the comic book fan (I loved the original comic books with their great artwork).  Ang Lee (the director) even pulls up images on the screen (occasionally) that are block-like, giving you the feeling that you're watching a type of moving comic book, but with real characters.The cast of characters in this film is impressive, too: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot.  It's just a shame that a bit more time wasn't taken to go over the script and fix a few dialogue problems.  Some of it seems forced, just a patch-work to help the plot move along.  But...This still didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film for me.  New ideas were incorporated (something that some 'Hulk Purists' might find offensive), and I found them refreshing.  Let's not forget that the Hulk comic strip never stayed static, either folks.  In this film, nano-technology was introduced.  But it never became over-burdensome with techno-babble.  The action of the film and its characters stayed in the forefront of the film.The movie follows pretty closely the development of Bruce Banner into the Hulk.  Except here, there's a genetic component along with the nano-machines and Gamma radiation accident.  Ang Lee also incorporated some great family dynamics that come back to bite the audience on the nose.It was a good film.  I really enjoyed watching it.  I might even watch it again.

What is the point of making up a new origin for the movie? So right off the bat the primary fans this movie aims for have been diss'd. And I suspect most people were put off by opening the movie with 5 minutes of laboratory experiments on animals. The only thing that kept me from being completely turned off by the first 20 minutes of the show were the cool new film editing transitions. And the comic style multi-panel effects on screen were often fascinating and only occasionally pointless and distracting.The whole thing with Hulk's dad seemed invented just to set up the final fight. The fight was done well although his mutant dogs were clearly not as well animated. But the character of the Hulk was just as it should be. Aside from the fact that the Hulk is supposed to be able to talk, that is. The Hulk's animation really did carry the movie though. I just wish Ang had resisted the temptation to turn him into the not-so jolly green giant. 10 feet tall? Okay, I'll buy that. But 15 feet tall?

In fact, I was even a little put off when news got out that the Hulk would be completely CGI, instead of Lou Ferrigno, or some other big muscled man playing this jolly-green giant. So the Hulk really wasn't on my top most wanted list of films to see this summer. But a situation emerged where I found myself in need of a movie to go see with some friends. Well, not much was out that week, so I chose `Hulk.My first impression was: this is a dark movie. Even darker then my favorite superhero film - Batman. I realized it also featured a extremely psychological, complicated plot. I knew instantly this would not go over well with the general public. This is a film where you actual have to think. A lot of people despise that.But for me, someone who is inclined to that time of film, I enjoyed it, even though it might have been a little drawn out.The film, of course, centers around Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a nuclear mishap, and a mad-scientist father (Nick Nolte). Through the movie, we are showed flash backs of Bruce's forgotten childhood, revelations about his family, and other various elements that spell out Bruce's emotional state. This film is not about the hulk, it's about Bruce, his father and their struggles with troubled pasts. Bruce's ex-girlfriend/co-worker Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is also intertwined into that past.That facet of the film I liked. What I didn't like about the film was...quite frankly...the Hulk. The creature really only served as a side story in the film; making only a few appearances. Two of which were nothing more then long, overdrawn, boring, and irrational fight scenes. The worst element of the film was the star, really. Director Ang Lee did a much better job with the drama plot rather then the action one.This is where the movie probably fails. Ang Lee didn't make a action movie, he really even didn't make a superhero movie. Instead, Director Lee made a psychological drama with bits of bad action sequences thrown in. But then, isn't that what the Hulk is about; psychology rather then action. The idea of the Hulk is what makes this movie a true conundrum. The Hulk is a superhero, right? But the character is more about the inner workings of a human being, not a caped crusader who goes around saving innocents. Really, if you ask me, Mr. Lee was caught between a rock and a hard place in making this movie. The Hulk is not a action star, he's a tortured soul. People must understand that before seeing this film. IT IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE. DON'T TAKE THE FIVE-YEAR-OLDS, THEY'LL BE BORED STIFF.But all that aside, if you watch the Hulk with the mindset that it is not a action movie. It'll will probably be an enjoyable event for you.

584707,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B00005JKC3,Charlie Brooks,"[4, 6]","Ang Lee's Hulk is a much better movie than it gets credit for. It suffered from two major drawbacks. First, it wasn't Spider-Man. That statement might seem snarky, but the teaser trailer was shown at the release of the Spider-Man movie, and Spidey's box office success led many moviegoers and critics to believe that Marvel's movies should all follow that formula. The second problem came from the marketing of the film. It was marketed to be a summer blockbuster, an action film extraordinaire. While the film does contain a great deal of action, it's far more introspective than that, and would have been better suited to the psychological thriller or horror movie crowd.Ignoring the context of its release, Hulk is an incredible movie. The movie departs from comic book canon, mostly focusing on the relationship between Bruce and his father that was explored in the 80s and 90s rather than the Cold War monstrosity that the Hulk began as. Eric Bana plays the emotionally repressed Bruce Banner, and does an amazing job of conveying emotion through his eyes and body language, even when his character is supposed to be emotionally distant. The other actors are not to be overshadowed, and they put together very good performances throughout the film.Since the Hulk was originally created as a combination of Jekyll and Hyde and the Frankenstein monster, it is fitting that the movie itself is more of a horror movie than a superhero movie. The Hulk is a monster, and one that Bruce does his best to keep under wraps. His presence is felt from the onset of the movie, even though he doesn't appear until the second act. When he does come back, he dominates the film, showing exactly how unstoppable the force of pure rage can be.To emphasize the Hulk's roots as a comic book character, Ang Lee uses split screens a lot, turning the movie screen into a comic book page. This allows him to focus on many different angles at once, and to highlight the tension between the characters. However, it's a technique that you either love or hate. That technique mirrors a lot of people's reaction to the movie in general - you either love it, or you hate it. Personally, as a horror film fan and a long-time Hulk reader, I love it. The film fits perfectly with a character who never fit in with the superhero crowd, and whose best adventures occurred in the confines of his own mind.",5,An underrated masterpiece,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,2375,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'credit', 'suffered', 'two', 'major', 'drawbacks', 'First', 'was', ""n't"", 'Spider-Man', 'statement', 'might', 'seem', 'snarky', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'was', 'shown', 'release', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'Spidey', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'led', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'critics', 'believe', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'should', 'follow', 'formula', 'second', 'problem', 'came', 'marketing', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'be', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'film', 'extraordinaire', 'film', 'contain', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'far', 'more', 'introspective', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'horror', 'movie', 'crowd.Ignoring', 'context', 'release', 'Hulk', 'incredible', 'movie', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'canon', 'mostly', 'focusing', 'relationship', 'Bruce', 'father', 'was', 'explored', '80s', '90s', 'rather', 'Cold', 'War', 'monstrosity', 'Hulk', 'began', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'emotionally', 'repressed', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'amazing', 'job', 'conveying', 'emotion', 'eyes', 'body', 'language', 'even', 'when', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'overshadowed', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'film.Since', 'Hulk', 'was', 'originally', 'created', 'combination', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'fitting', 'movie', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Hulk', 'monster', 'one', 'Bruce', 'best', 'keep', 'wraps', 'presence', 'felt', 'onset', 'movie', 'even', ""n't"", 'appear', 'second', 'act', 'When', 'come', 'back', 'film', 'showing', 'exactly', 'how', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'pure', 'rage', 'can', 'be.To', 'emphasize', 'Hulk', 'roots', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'split', 'lot', 'turning', 'movie', 'screen', 'comic', 'book', 'page', 'focus', 'many', 'different', 'angles', 'once', 'highlight', 'tension', 'characters', 'However', 'technique', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'technique', 'lot', 'people', 'reaction', 'movie', 'general', 'love', 'hate', 'Personally', 'horror', 'film', 'fan', 'long-time', 'Hulk', 'reader', 'love', 'film', 'perfectly', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'fit', 'superhero', 'crowd', 'best', 'adventures', 'occurred', 'confines', 'own', 'mind']",N/A

584711,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00005JKC3,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[17, 21]","I'll just ask you this: isn't it better to have a trippy, funky, eccentric flick like Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" than no Hulk movie at all?Look, let's boil Ang Lee's rippingly fun new movie 'Hulk' down to its core components: it's about brilliant nanotechnological research scientist Bruce Banner who one day, while working in his lab, gets 'belted' by Gamma rays. What should have been a fatal exposure combines with certain---erm, genetic irregularities---to create some major anger management problems for Dr. Banner.You see, every time he gets angry---really angry---he turns into a big green man. A big green man with expandable purple stretch pants that assist with his modesty during his transformations from Eric Bana into a completely CGI-generated bright green monster.A big green man that hurls tanks and helicopters about like they were toys. A big green man whose erstwhile captor, General Ross (played competently but shallowly by Sam Elliot), decides to let escape from an underground Area 51-esque base, the better to 'fight him outside.'Umm, OK. The truth is that Ang Lee brings his stellar cinematic sensibilities (from movies like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"") to Marvel's storied Incredible Hulk: like the little nanites that flow through Bruce's body and the gamma rays, the marriage of Lee to the comic book material results in a whole that is greater---and greener---than the sum of its parts.'Hulk' is solidly entertaining, visually gorgeous, and---especially for a summer blockbuster---an unusually experimental film that manages to entertain and startle simultaneously.Those who go to ""Hulk"" looking for stellar special effects will leave highly satisfied. SEE:*green gamma-ray mushroom clouds!*nasty insane killer giant poodles!*Banner's mad scientist father David, who undergoes some startling transformations of his own (seriously: Nolte doesn't just *chew* scenery in this movie, he absorbs it!)!*the incredible battle sequences between the Hulk and his tormentors---be they the hideous hulk-Dogs or our brave boys in the US Army---the latter pitted against the real ""Army of One""!The special effects centerpiece award of ""Hulk"" goes, of course, to the eponymous hero: the Hulk himself is completely computer generated. Does it work?Actually, the Hulk is one of the superhero pandemic's most sympathetic characters, and displays far more humanity than his alter ego, played with considerable reticence by Eric Bana. The last superhero we saw who was this withdrawn was Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne.The acting here is all top-notch, and there aren't any uneven performances: Bana doesn't exactly reprise his ""Chopper"" performance---he's way too restrained---but then again, he's a nice counterpoint to his lab-destroying Green Inner Child. Jennifer Connelly re-affirms her position as Hollywood's most gorgeous underrated actress. Nick Nolte plays his leering, rasping role to the hilt, and ultimately steals the show.There are times where the movie gets a little too awkward and goofy for its own good: I'd still love to know where the Hulk gets his one-size-fits-all purple stretch pants. There's Josh Lucas's death scene, in which they freeze frame the horrified Lucas in front of an explosion---highly goofy, but very comic booky, and it works; I laughed, anyway.The Hulk's surrender scene in downtown San Francisco also makes little sense; after all, if the Big Green Guy is so fond of leaping, why doesn't he just leap out of the way of all those army men and hop over to Oakland?And speaking of that, what was General Ross thinking when he figures that it's a good idea to let the leap-loving Hulk escape the underground base, reasoning that it will be easier to fight the Big Guy on the surface? Time for a court-martial, Soldier.But even though the buildup and exposition of ""Hulk"" makes the movie run a tad long, the film ultimately comes together, a testament to the solidity of its actors, the seamlessness of its CGI, and the talents of both Ang Lee and Director of Photography Fred Elmes, who worked with Lee on ""Ice Storm"" and has been a long-time DP for David Lynch (his credits include ""Eraserhead"", ""Wild at Heart"", and ""Blue Velvet"")---so it's no wonder that such lurid, dark emotions can be shot on such a visually brilliant palette.Yes, ""Hulk"" is a Evil Dad vs. Good Son movie---and like so many other films that used the same device to telling effect (think Star Wars, or even, in a lopsided way, Spider-Man), ""Hulk"" succeeds at a very primal level.""Hulk"", after all, is about secrets repressed under a banal, nondescript surface, about the rage that lurks within all of us. Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" says that if it isn't easy being Green, at least it looks good. Just don't make him angry---you wouldn't like him when he's angry.JSG",5,It isn't easy being Green,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,4798,"[""'ll"", 'just', 'ask', ""n't"", 'better', 'have', 'trippy',

It wasn't reasonable to expect it to make 800 million as Spider-Man did, it's too dark, too violent and too smart.First, let's all get on one page here:  The Hulk is NOT a superhero, he is a monster.  He has boundless courage and will literally move mountains for the people he loves, but he doesn't care much about &quot;puny humans&quot; as a rule.The supposedly slow beginning in fact very crisply and quckly introduces and explores the four major characters and advances the plot toward the Hulk's first appearance.

After that it roars and smashes its way to the end (and the Hulk has plenty of screen time).  The Hulk does not look &quot;like a p'oed Shrek&quot;.  The ending is not obscure, the viewers are dumb.  The point is that the Hulk, fueled by virtually limitless rage, has virtually limitless strength.  When he shouted &quot;Take it all!&quot;, he was so furious that he absorbed and converted energy at a greater rate than his father could absorb, so Daddy blew up real good.  Thank you to all, by the way, for finally explaining how the extra mass comes  and goes.

The Hulk is another Marvel character I have enjoyed since peering into the pages of comic book legendry and watching the series with Lou Ferrigno {who also briefly appears herein}, and I must say that this film does him justice. in My opinion. Ironically, Dr. Bruce Banner just wants to be left alone, yet antagonists repeatedly attempt to get a rise out of him, to their horror.The Hulk/Bruce Banner dichotomy definitely exemplifies the were-creature of The Id, at odds with himself, instead of accepting and controlling his own darkside, which in the comics, he eventually does accomplish. We also see this symbology in the characters of Dr. Jeckyl & Mr. Hyde, and of course, The Werewolf. If these emotions are seen as natural proclivities, balance is attained, thus expressing them in constructive ways.The CGI kinematics are very well done, flowing gracefully and believably - yet the question remains, how does The Hulk acquire those purple pants? At no time does Banner wear purple pants, yet they appear mysteriously every time. But I digress. The Hulk presented here is an absolutely inhumanly large creature, sometimes growing to about 12"" tall, his massive frame supplemented as his adrenaline increases.I thought one of the most impressive scenes was during the mutant dog battle, as he heroically saves his love interest Betty from their fearsome jaws, and the desert sequences when he jumps miles across land, and in San Francisco - the savage beast is quelled by the gentle hands of the lovely girl, whose father is a general persuing him relentlessly through desert and urban environments, using everything from tanks to fighter planes, which The Hulk tosses about like toys.Banner's father appears as an unassuming janitor working at the lab, released after years of government captivity, with a chip on his shoulder, and is intent on gaining revenge for his incarceration. His opportunity arrives when he uses the solution combined with Gamma Radiation to acquire his own powers of melding with whatever object he touches, and absorbing energy, which proves to be just too much for him when he and The Hulk lock together during the final battle scene.Unfortunately, Banner must seclude himself from his beloved Betty for her safety, and dissappears into the world, but a force such as this cannot be contained forever, manifesting when angered again.",5,"That which does not destroy Me, makes Me Stronger. -Nietzche",1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2500,"['quote', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'Hulk', 'motto', 'matter', 'what', 'levelled', 'stronger', 'increasing', 'rage', 'Hulk', 'Marvel', 'character', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'peering', 'pages', 'comic', 'book', 'legendry', 'watching', 'series', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'who', 'also', 'briefly', 'herein', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'justice', 'opinion', 'Ironically', 'Dr.', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'yet', 'repeatedly', 'attempt', 'get', 'rise', 'horror.The', 'Hulk/Bruce', 'Banner', 'definitely', 'were-creature', 'Id', 'odds', 'instead', 'accepting', 'controlling', 'own', 'darkside', 'comics', 'eventually', 'accomplish', 'also', 'see', 'symbology', 'characters', 'Dr.', 'Jeckyl', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'course', 'Werewolf', 'emotions', 'are', 'seen', 'natural', 'proclivities', 'balance', 'attained', 'thus', 'expressing', 'constructive', 'ways.The', 'CGI', 'kinematics', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'flowing', 'gracefully', 'believably', 'yet', 'question', 'how', 'Hulk', 'acquire', 'purple', 'pants', 'time', 'Banner', 'wear', 'purple', 'pants', 'yet', 'appear', 'mysteriously', 'time', 'digress', 'Hulk', 'presented', 'here', 'absolutely', 'inhumanly', 'large', 'creature', 'sometimes', 'growing', '12', 'tall', 'massive', 'frame', 'supplemented', 'adrenaline', 'increases.I', 'thought', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'was', 'mutant', 'dog', 'battle', 'heroically', 'love', 'interest', 'Betty', 'fearsome', 'jaws', 'desert', 'sequences', 'when', 'miles', 'land', 'San', 'Francisco', 'savage', 'beast', 'quelled', 'gentle', 'hands', 'lovely', 'girl', 'father', 'general', 'persuing', 'relentlessly', 'desert', 'urban', 'environments', 'using', 'everything', 'tanks', 'fighter', 'planes', 'Hulk', 'toys.Banner', 'father', 'unassuming', 'janitor', 'working', 'lab', 'released', 'years', 'government', 'captivity', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'intent', 'gaining', 'revenge', 'incarceration', 'opportunity', 'when', 'solution', 'combined', 'Gamma', 'Radiation', 'acquire', 'own', 'powers', 'melding', 'object', 'absorbing', 'energy', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'Hulk', 'lock', 'together', 'final', 'battle', 'scene.Unfortunately', 'Banner', 'must', 'seclude', 'beloved', 'Betty', 'safety', 'world', 'force', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'contained', 'forever', 'manifesting', 'when', 'angered', 'again']",N/A

When I went to see this film I wanted to love it, but ended up a little disappointed. The story is interesting enough, but the film's pacing is uneven. It captures some of the feel of the comic book and the CGI Hulk looks good most of the time and while I didn't mind the Hulk being CGI, I didn't like a lot of the changes in the original story.Changing Dr. Banner from a meek book worm into a troubled anger management patient was not the wisest decision. There was no contrast between the two personalities and this could have been used to there advantage throughout the film. I also felt the story was a bit convoluted and long sometimes even tedious. Making the hulk grow to 15 feet was also a bad decision, it made it even harder to believe those purple pants could stretch so much and where does it end if he keeps getting madder, will he become a 500 foot Godzilla Hulk?. When the Hulk is on screen, the film is exciting and full of great Hulk action. i.e. a favorite scene, the desert when The Hulk is running towards the tank! Hulk dogs, his father is a quasi Absorbing Man?, all of this seems to be thrown together, but I didn't hate this movie.In the end, while I liked this film, it left a lot of room for improvement. There was enough going for me to overlook some of the flaws, but this could have been a really good movie with a few tweaks here and there.I had envisioned a movie like the original Frankenstein or King Kong with a misunderstood monster that just wanted to be left alone, the sequel, is an improvement, but that is another review.The 2 disc DVD is nice with some interesting extras, but the Blu Ray is the way to go for video and audio for best film experience.",3,HULK ACTION GOOD!

Because whatever it is supposed to be isn't contrary to any expectations I had going in.  In fact, I was taking my younger brother to the movie, expecting to spend 2 hours yawning and anxiously waiting to leave.Yet for some reason, I sat down to this movie and really enjoyed myself.  The special effects were not very realistic, and the sets weren't either, but i think that was the point.  This is based on a comic book.

I will admit that it doesn't live up to other great super hero movies such as Dark Knight or Iron Man, but I think a lot of people miss the good points of this film.Many reviewers who don't like this movie will still admit that the CGI work is very impressive.  The animation on the Hulk is very realistic (if you can say that about a mutated fictional creature) and his interactions with real life objects is very convincing.  The shot of him yelling while the water splashes off of him is probably my single favorite moment in the movie.The story line has been called ""dark"" which I agree with, but I don't see this as a downside to the movie.  I'm not even sure how you can have a happy-go-lucky film based on a character that gets mad.  I like how the story slows down to allow us to get to know the characters more personally.  This is a very different style then many other super hero movies, but I think it really works for this story.I think my favorite aspect of this movie is the use of multiple camera angles.  This makes it feel more like a comic book and adds a whole new layer to the film.  Surprisingly, I can't recall seeing this technique in any other movie.I've seen the 2008 remake and didn't even like that version as much.  Unlike this edition, I felt the 2008 movie was just a cookie cutter super hero movie that was way over the top and not as captivating.

584722,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B00005JKC3,Duane Thomas,"[7, 8]","I've been collecting comic books since I was eight years old (I'll stop when I die) so I was interested to hear Ang Lee would direct the Hulk movie. Having now seen the film, though there've been many changes made to the character's history, I feel they did a pretty darn good job capturing his essence.First major change, Bruce no longer develops the gamma bomb for the military. I guess the writers thought it would be too difficult to build sympathy for a character who spends his days building bigger and better ways to slaughter thousands of people. Now Bruce's metamorphosis is triggered by a combination of experiments performed on him as a child by his scientist father, and a lab accident. While this may sidestep the whole issue of building sympathy for a weapons designer, we lose that overriding, powerful image of the Hulk being born at the heart of a nuclear bomb blast.In the comics, Bruce's father was even more of a monster than in the movie. It was comics writer Bill Mantlo who first came up with the idea that Bruce Banner was a seriously abused child - we're talking his entire childhood was a living hell of physical/emotional abuse, and watching the same delivered upon his mother. In the movie, though the father experiments upon his son, and eventually, accidentally kills his wife, versus Bruce's comics father - who beat his wife to death, and it was NOT an accident - he's comparatively decent.Of course, that doesn't make him a nice guy. Nick Nolte was an inspired choice to play the father. Even his good guys are psycho a-holes. Give him a character who's a psycho a-hole to start with and he really goes to town.Mantlo theorized the Hulk is basically an expression of Multiple Personality Disorder, Bruce Banner's rage over what happened to him as a child - repressed his entire life - finally released into the world as a separate personality, a different body, by gamma radiation. An idea put forth in the movie, that to my knowledge has never been used in the comics - and I find this fascinating - is that Bruce feels a JOY, a release when he becomes the Hulk. On some level, this repressed man delights when he's finally able to lash out at a world that's dealt with him so cruelly.Yes, this is a dark movie. Bruce Banner is Marvel Comics' Job. Really, given everything he's been through, he should have committed suicide years ago. The only thing he has going for him - and this is a biggie - he has the love of a good woman. This is his lifeline, what keeps him sane, gives him a reason to go on living. And this was communicated well in the movie.I've been an Eric Bana fan since his amazing performance in Black Hawk Down. Bana was a good choice to play Bruce Banner; he was able to project the sense of Banner's pain. The only gripe I have with Eric as Bruce is that in the scenes where we see him stripped down, this guy does not have the body of a shy, bookish scientist nerd. He has the body of a Delta Force troopie.Jennifer Connelly brought her customary sensitivity and intelligence to her portrayal of Betty Ross. I'm shocked, though, at how thin she looks throughout the film. It's like she's actually been listening to the idiots who've opined, over the years, her bounteous curves made her look overweight (as if!). Watching this movie, I was struck with the urge to take her out to dinner, not out of a desire to get lucky, just to feed her a decent meal.I agree with the statement that Sam Elliot was born to play Thunderbolt Ross.The notion of the Hulk fleeing through the New Mexico desert, being hounded by Thunderbolt Ross, tossing around tanks, etc. had become a cliche' in Marvel Comics before the Sixties were out. I was surprised to see how much power those images, those ideas, had when translated onto the movie screen. During those scenes, I was just sitting there going, ""Oh my God.""The CGI Hulk looked great. I was impressed at how believable he seemed.Really, the only major complaint I have about this movie, that cost it its 5th star, was the frequent use of split-screen technique during many key scenes, especially early on. It's difficult to suspend your disbelief when the director is constantly calling your attention to the fact this is Just a Movie with such flashy techniques.

I think that this film has a lot of heart which is unusual for this type of film, most comic adaptations are action based as were this one seems more character driven. This film was not given the credit it deserved and neither did the cast or crew.Bruce Banner is a young researcher that is not only in love with his fellow co worker but is also drawn to studying gamma radiation.

All of this put together makes for one interesting film, a lot better then I thought it would be. Plus the battle at the end is cool and that is always a plus.Director Ang Lee who is a wonderful filmmaker did a marvelous job with this film, he turned what could have been just your basic comic movie into a more dramatic tale of tragedy. His direction in this film can be felt all through out the finished product and I really think that he was the perfect choice for this film. Credit of course should also go to writers James Schamus, John Turman, and Michael France who really did something unexpected with this film. This movie is a real emotional based story that relies more on the characters then the action, those three should be complimented for penning this. Frederick Elmes shot this film masterfully and Tim Squyres's editing is flawless, every one should be commended. Eric Bana is completely believable as Bruce Banner and does a real good job with this part, lot of people said this part should have went to some one else. Jennifer Connelly portrays Betty Ross extremely well and I don't think any one would disagree with me on that. Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Cara Buono all are good in this film as well and each of them really make this film all the more entertaining. But it is Nick Nolte in my opinion who really steals the show on this one as Bruce's long lost father who is extremely obsessed with continuing his work. So much so that he doesn't even care about his own son although it seems that he does for a while. In fact it is the dynamic between him and Eric Bana that really make this film, very emotional between these two.Of course not every thing about this film is great, there are a few things that keep this from being a classic. I think the main thing that brings this film down a little in many peoples minds is the length. This is actually a fairly long film that at times feels like it is dragging, so I can understand that. I think because this was more character driven and played on the emotion of the characters a lot it tended to let everything play out a bit slowly. Another thing is that the CGI in this film is not exactly the greatest ever, in fact the Hulk looks more cartoonish at times then intimidating.Still even with those flaws I still think that this was a good movie, much better then most people give it credit for. Who knows maybe because so many others hated it I liked it, but I did.Also this film has some great special features including a nice commentary by Ang Lee",4,CHARACTER DRIVEN FILM DESERVES CREDIT,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3611,"['HULKPeople', 'hate', 'film', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'seriously', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'problem', 'will', 'agree', 'movie', 'not', 'classic', 'really', 'feel', 'time', 'see', 'have', 'watched', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'think', 'film', 'lot', 'comics', 'least', 'lot', 'versions', 'comics', 'really', 'great', 'story', 'think', 'film', 'lot', 'heart', 'unusual', 'type', 'film', 'most', 'comic', 'adaptations', 'are', 'action', 'based', 'were', 'one', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'credit', 'deserved', 'did', 'cast', 'crew.Bruce', 'Banner', 'young', 'researcher', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'fellow', 'co', 'worker', 'also', 'drawn', 'studying', 'gamma', 'radiation', 'course', 'one', 'accident', 'lab', 'rays', 'when', 'rays', 'mesh', 'present', 'body', 'long', 'lost', 'father', 'left', 'well', 'green', 'here', 'have', 'whole', 'story', 'love', 'father', 'who', 'only', 'use', 'experiment', 'mean', 'son', 'military', 'put', 'together', 'one', 'interesting', 'film', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'battle', 'end', 'cool', 'always', 'plus.Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'who', 'wonderful', 'filmmaker', 'did', 'marvelous', 'job', 'film', 'turned', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'basic', 'comic', 'movie', 'more', 'dramatic', 'tale', 'tragedy', 'direction', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'out', 'finished', 'product', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'film', 'Credit', 'course', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'writers', 'James', 'Schamus', 'John', 'Turman', 'Michael', 'France', 'who', 'really', 'did', 'something', 'unexpected', 'film', 'movie', 'real', 'emotional', 'based', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'then', 'action', 'three', 'should', 'be', 'complimented', 'penning', 'Frederick', 'Elmes', 'shot', 'film', 'masterfully', 'Tim', 'Squyres', 'editing', 'flawless', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'completely', 'believable', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'real', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'lot', 'people', 'said', 'part', 'should', 'have', 'went', 'one', 'else', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'extremely', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'would', 'disagree', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Cara', 'Buono', 'are', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'opinion', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'one', 'Bruce', 'long', 'lost', 'father', 'who', 'extremely', 'obsessed', 'continuing', 'work', 'So', 'much', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'own', 'son', 'while', 'fact', 'dynamic', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'really', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'emotional', 'two.Of', 'course', 'not', 'thing', 'film', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'keep', 'being', 'classic', 'think', 'main', 'thing', 'film', 'down', 'little', 'many', 'peoples', 'minds', 'length', 'actually', 'fairly', 'long', 'film', 'times', 'feels', 'dragging', 'can', 'understand', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'played', 'emotion', 'characters', 'lot', 'tended', 'let', 'everything', 'play', 'out', 'bit', 'slowly', 'thing', 'CGI', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'greatest', 'ever', 'fact', 'Hulk', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'times', 'then', 'intimidating.Still', 'even', 'flaws', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'most', 'people', 'give', 'credit', 'Who', 'maybe', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'hated', 'liked', 'did.Also', 'film', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'nice', 'commentary', 'Ang', 'Lee']",N/A

The Hulk weighs several tons.I felt that Hulk 2008 was more like the TV Hulk character.  He was depicted as a monster, but he didn't have superman like powers.  The Hulk 2008 had more mixture of actors and cgi special affects than Hulk 2003.  The mixture of actor and cgi character probably limited the extent of the action scenes.  It just did not meet my expectation of smash capability of the Hulk.The Hulk 2003 was true to the expectations of the comic books.  I would read the Hulk comic books because the author built a character expectation.  You learned the character capabilities and anticipated them in the comic in the clashes and conflicts..  I felt Hulk 2003 met those expectations.I liked the fact that the Hulk 2003 character was allowed to be more than the TV hulkThe comic plot emphasized the hulk.  The writer used the Banner character to explain the threat cause the emergence of the hulk.  The Hulk was 90 percent of the comic story.

If you're satisfied by more explosion than exposition, I'd suggest any number of other comic book movies.Ang Lee has been vilified for creating here a smart, tight, thoughtful movie that just so happens to be about a comic book (anti)hero. Which means that much of its built-in audience is going to be surprised by what they get in this film: a multilayered story that is rich with subtext; excellent performances by award-winning actors; clever dialogue and assured pacing.In other words, for those who love movies, this is a good one.Far from perfect, this movie does succumb to summer blockbuster visual effects-itis by the end and for my money it degenerates into noisy racket for the lowest common denominator in the multiplex. However, what fun it is to get there.This is a much smarter movie than it needs to be, probably better suited to those who are more interested in a good story than to those who want some brainless ""pow!"" with their butter-flavored popcorn.

David banner told his son Bruce banner, ""everything that extraordinary mind of yours has been searching for is me"".Then ThunderBolt Ross(sam elliot)shuts his research down.The Hulk has a good origin story,but Spiderman and IRONMAN had better origin stories  and were more fun and exciting.They could have made the HULK better if they didn`t waste time on dull and boring drama scenes and had more action and adventure.In the Berkeley science lab Dr. bruce banner(eric bana) and his beautifull assistant Betty Ross(jennifer connelly)are experimenting with nanomeds and the bodies ability to regenerate, repair and rebuild itself and to heal itself from injury or disease,then an accident exposes Dr. bruce banner to gamma radiation that awakens the cells in his body that unleashes the awesome power that transforms him into the hulk when he gets angry.The genetic alteration that bruce banner`s father  passed on to him makes his body strong enough to survive and protects him from the nanomed accelerated healing and growth technology that killed all the lab animals and the genetic alteration also protects him from the gamma radiation from killing him.The genetic alteration + nanomed reconstruction technology + gamma radiation = bruce banner transforming into the HULK. The special effects are superb and extraordinary,the CGI Hulk is mindblowing,the music is great and very enjoyable and beautifull,the visuals and the hulk fighting the giant monster dogs and the army is breathtaking and incredibly exciting and when his father david banner(nick nolte)transforms into the REAL ABSORBING MAN and flies through the air at lightnening speed with the HULK.I like the part when bruce banner tells talbott, "" talbott your making me angry,you don`t like me ,when I am angry"".The 15ft.

I shouldn't be, since most of the elements showed up in the comic over th years, but I guess seeing it all on screen adds a certain emotional page that you just don't get on the four colored page. Some scenes caused me to squirm in my seat. Without elaborating, some things hit close to home. The origin story differs much from the story. In the movie, Bruce Banner's father is using his toddler son in illegal experiments hoping to build the perfect man. In actuality, his long term goal is to improve upon himself genetically. Without spoiling any more of the essential plot elements, Bruce's father is an all around abusive man who brutalizes both Bruce and his mother. Bruce represses memories of this abuse (one instance especially) but it comes out after the accident that exposes him to Gamma rays. The Gamma rays trigger his father's old experiments and turns Bruce into the Hulk. The Hulk is Bruce's id-a personification of his subconscious rage.The only calming effect on the Hulk is Betty Ross, played by Jennifer Connelly. Connelly is pretty much playing the same character she played in A Beautiful Mind She won an Oscar for that role, and although he Academy Awards ignores movies like this, I think her role here is just as emotionally intense and deserves at least a nod. Mercy, they gave one to a thug like Eminem. Why not to a comic book movie? Sam Elliot plays General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, Betty's estranged father (See a theme here?) who is obsessed with destroying the Hulk-until he sees how much Betty cares for Bruce. I love Sam Elliot for his westerns, but he makes just as good an old warhorse. It eminded me a lot of his character from We Were Soldiers If you liked him in that, you'll like him in this. The best role, though, was Nick Nolte as David Banner, Bruce's father. He played him so clinically psychotic and over the top, he was the most colorful actor. He chews up every scene he is in, especially near the end when he lays out his motivations for experimenting on Bruce. It is totally chilling that a person would do that to his own son, yet I believe he's capable of it because he's such a fruitcake.The star is, of course, the Hulk. The CGI was fantastic-miles above Jar Jar Binks. My favorite scene is the battle with the tanks. There are several laugh out lius moments as he destroys them one at a time. The scene where the Hulk attacks San Francisco is also impressive.I'll admit some things had me scratching my head. The mutated poodles, for one. Yes. Mutated poodles. The ending is also largely symbolic and open to interpretation. I'll have to chew it over before I pass judgment on it. Regardless, I think Hulk is definitely worth seeing, but it is certainly not a movie fit for kids like Spiderman was.",3,Interesting,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,2907,"['saw', 'Hulk', 'today', 'went', 'expecting', 'find', 'mindless', 'summer', 'action', 'flick', 'Instead', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'dark', 'often', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'elements', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'most', 'elements', 'showed', 'up', 'comic', 'th', 'years', 'guess', 'seeing', 'screen', 'certain', 'emotional', 'page', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'four', 'colored', 'page', 'scenes', 'caused', 'squirm', 'seat', 'elaborating', 'things', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'origin', 'story', 'differs', 'much', 'story', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'father', 'using', 'toddler', 'son', 'illegal', 'experiments', 'hoping', 'build', 'perfect', 'man', 'actuality', 'long', 'term', 'goal', 'improve', 'genetically', 'spoiling', 'more', 'essential', 'plot', 'elements', 'Bruce', 'father', 'abusive', 'man', 'who', 'Bruce', 'mother', 'Bruce', 'memories', 'abuse', 'one', 'instance', 'especially', 'out', 'accident', 'Gamma', 'rays', 'Gamma', 'trigger', 'father', 'old', 'experiments', 'Bruce', 'Hulk', 'Hulk', 'Bruce', 'id-a', 'personification', 'subconscious', 'rage.The', 'only', 'calming', 'effect', 'Hulk', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Connelly', 'pretty', 'much', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'played', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'movies', 'think', 'role', 'here', 'just', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'least', 'nod', 'Mercy', 'gave', 'one', 'thug', 'Eminem', 'Why', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'General', 'Thunderbolt', 'Ross', 'Betty', 'estranged', 'father', 'See', 'theme', 'here', 'who', 'obsessed', 'destroying', 'Hulk-until', 'how', 'much', 'Betty', 'cares', 'Bruce', 'love', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'westerns', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'old', 'warhorse', 'eminded', 'lot', 'character', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'liked', ""'ll"", 'like', 'best', 'role', 'was', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'David', 'Banner', 'Bruce', 'father', 'played', 'so', 'clinically', 'psychotic', 'top', 'was', 'most', 'colorful', 'actor', 'up', 'scene', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'out', 'motivations', 'experimenting', 'Bruce', 'totally', 'chilling', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'own', 'son', 'yet', 'believe', 'capable', 'such', 'fruitcake.The', 'star', 'course', 'Hulk', 'CGI', 'was', 'fantastic-miles', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'favorite', 'scene', 'battle', 'tanks', 'are', 'several', 'lius', 'moments', 'one', 'time', 'scene', 'where', 'Hulk', 'San', 'Francisco', 'also', 'impressive.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'things', 'had', 'scratching', 'head', 'mutated', 'poodles', 'one', 'Yes', 'Mutated', 'poodles', 'ending', 'also', 'largely', 'symbolic', 'open', 'interpretation', ""'ll"", 'have', 'chew', 'pass', 'judgment', 'Regardless', 'think', 'Hulk', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'certainly', 'not', 'movie', 'fit', 'kids', 'Spiderman', 'was']",N/A

584744,A1Y29KE9G0I350,B00005JKC3,J. L. Braswell,"[1, 1]","Though I did not enjoy this movie at all, there are a couple of plus sides to this film, so I would like to begin my review by addressing those.  Firstly, there are a few good supporting performances caught up within this movie.  Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly turns in a fine performance as Betty Ross, the love interest of lead character Bruce Banner (Eric Bana).  She had very good chemistry with Eric Bana, providing him with his best scenes.  She was one of the few things in this film that made its length bearable.  Sam Elliot as General Ross (Betty's father) was also a welcome ingredient to an otherwise bland and uninteresting cast.The second factor that was well worth my attention in this film was the special effects.  Surprisingly, they turned out to be excellent.  The Hulk himself was very real looking, especially when David Banner (played by Nick Nolte) touched his face!  The movie could have stood to have more Hulk in it, as the few scenes with him are the only ones that try to be anything like the comic book!  In a day when rampant overuse of CGI has taken such hold, I am glad to see that something like the Hulk has actually made worthwhile use of it for a pleasant change.Now, to the bad elements of this film.  Bogged down with way too much psycho drama for its own good, this film is mired in relentless flashbacks that never let up and  is hampered by endless story liberties taken by the director and writers.  Why fans tend to gripe about the alterations made in other superhero franchises is beyond me after seeing the liberties and changes made here.Ang Lee is a good director, as proven by the performances in this and his previous works, but his decision to tamper with a good bit of the source material killed this film for me.  According to interviews, he was personally responsible for many of the ""creative liberties"" that were taken with the story.  The Hulk's continuing increases in size as he gets angrier was a horrible idea, reminding me more of King Kong at one point as opposed to the Hulk!  It was also a mistake to tamper with the Hulk's origins to such an extent.  Making  David Banner (Bruce's father, the name being a nod to the television series starring Bill Bixby) a psychopathic scientist who genetically experiments on his young son is completely wrong and actually steals away from the sequence in which Bruce gets blasted by Gamma rays in the laboratory accident years later.Using the last half of the film to turn David into the new super villain was the biggest mistake of all.  The merging of David's character and The Absorbing Man from the comic book results in one of the most ridiculous misrepresentations of a comic book villain in recent years.  The finale of the film, which sported a special effects filled clash between Bruce and his all powerful father, was a joke and made very little sense!  What happened?  The film was out of control at this point, but thanks to the director not knowing what an edit option is, the film kept going and going and going  while accomplishing nothing.  This seemimgly tacked on ending was there just to give ILM something BIG to do with Universal's money!  Lee really needs to remember how to edit a movie properly.  It was way too long for its own good, clocking in at a whopping 138 minutes.Lee's choice to panel so many scenes throughout  the film was very annoying after a little while.  This may work for a montage sequence or for opening credits, but to rely on a this technique throughout a whole film??  Very bad decision to be sure.  He has stated that he wanted to remind us that we were watching a comic book movie.  Does he think that we, the audience, don't already know that?  Well, we are watching Lee's ""artistic"" version of the Hulk.I actually cannot comment on Eric Bana as an actor outside of the Hulk film, for I have never seen any other film that he has starred in. I can say, however, that I was not very pleased with his performance as Bruce Banner, but I really do not place the blame on his acting skills, but rather on the overdose of psychological problems presented by the script.  Everything Bana did with his performance was on the spot, but for me the material bogged his character down incredibly. I think I would have liked Bana had he been presented with differing material and characterization to work with!  As for Nick Nolte, I feel that he was miscast in the role of David Banner.  He chews lots of scenery, but is ultimately wasted in the role.Danny Elfman has delivered many fine film scores during his career.  His score this time around, however, was very lacking as far as enhancing this film goes.  There was a complete lack of any kind of theme for one thing, which should never be the case in a film of this type.  The eastern influences heard throughout the soundtrack were very out of place for a movie set solely in America!  Perhaps it would play better as an isolated soundtrack minus the movie, but as a companion to the film, it did nothing for it at all.  This is a cardinal sin in movie soundtracks!  If a score fails to enhance your movie going experience, then why was it there to begin with?As usual, the movie studio over-hyped their big summer release.  They aimed this psychodrama at children, not realizing that they will be the ones least interested in the long, confusing, uninteresting story sprinkled with only a handful of action sequences!  Is it really a wonder why this movie ended up being such a disappointment at the box office?  Oh well, they had to sell toys somehow didn't they!",2,TOO BIG TO ACTUALLY MOVE!,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,5562,"['did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'are', 'couple', 'sides', 'film', 'would', 'like',

584745,AE6XAIX1UA2SG,B00005JKC3,joebuzz1,"[0, 0]","I missed this in the theaters so was looking forward to it on DVD. Leave it to Ang Lee to take on another genre and nail it. I watched this twice the first night I rented it and bought it a week later. It loses nothing with multiple viewings. Like X-Men, director Lee made outstanding casting choices which raises this above standard super-hero fare and turns it into a brilliant, albeit dark, character study. Jennifer Connelly (who not only turns in a wonderful performance but is absolutely stunning!), Sam Elliot and especially Nick Nolte all turn in Oscar worthy performances. I think the bad box office killed any award possibilities which usually are heaped upon most of Lee's films. Eric Bana is the one weak cast member, but his awkward speech patterns (I think he's Australian) fit okay into the nerdy and stunted personality of his character. The Hulk effects range between excellent and so-so, but the star of The Hulk is the story not the FX. This movie uses the focal point of the father/son relationship of Superman the Movie (still the best superhero epic) and turns it on its ear.

584747,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JKC3,Joe Sherry,"[2, 3]","A film by Ang LeeAfter ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I was looking forward to Ang Lee's next movie.  When I heard he was doing ""The Hulk"", I was excited because he is a gifted director who could potentially bring a fresh look to a comic book movie and I thought he could do a fantastic job.  The reviews started coming in, and they were negative, but I still wanted to see the movie, both as a comic book adaptation and as an Ang Lee film.  Maybe I would see something that the reviewers did not.  Unfortunately, I did not.  ""The Hulk"" is awful.The movie begins with the necessary origins story.  While readers of the comic may be familiar with the origins of Hulk, the viewer needs to be introduced to how this all happened.  This is necessary, but it is also a drawback because it takes a half hour to tell.  This is a half hour of exposition where the title character does not make an appearance (though we are given hints and teases of what is to come).  Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist who, because of an accident in his laboratory, is hit with Gamma radiation.  This causes Banner to turn into the Hulk when he gets angry, in part because of a lot of repressed memories of his father, David (Nick Nolte).  David Banner was also a scientist engaged in similar research and it is in part because of David's science that Bruce was affected the way he was.  Telling any more with spoil the revelation (if anyone cares).Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is also a scientist working with Bruce, and it is hinted that they had a past relationship, though they still obviously care for each other.  She becomes the damsel in distress, as well as the bait laid out by her father, General Ross (Sam Elliott).  When Bruce becomes the Hulk, the military gets involved (as well they should with a rampaging green creature about).  The real showdowns come between Hulk and the military, under the command of General Ross.The first three quarters of the movie wasn't that good, but the last quarter just got downright ridiculous and silly, and nonsensical.  There was the whole side plot with Bruce's father that got pushed to the front and it didn't really make too much sense in conjunction with the rest of the plot, and that dragged down the movie to be even worse.Part of the problem is simply the Hulk himself.  The CG Hulk was extremely well done, but it was all too easy to see that he isn't part of the environment.  Perhaps it was the bright green color, but unlike the X-Men, Hulk didn't seem real even as part of the movie.  It was too obvious that he was CG when everything else is real.  Plus, the movie was just a bit cheesy, and dull.What I did like, and what I thought was done very well was the use of split screen frames, just like the comic book frames.  Sometimes they didn't seem to be used very well, but at other times, it added immensely to the movie and was one of the best features of the movie.  A couple scenes standout in my head, in the use of the split screens, but I'll leave it to the viewer to figure those out because revealing the scenes will spoil what the scene is about.""The Hulk"" should have been a better movie, but I was just disappointed.  Eric Bana was uninteresting as Bruce Banner, and with all the potential that there was, this was a complete let down.  Even ""Daredevil"" was a better movie with more human emotion.

584748,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00005JKC3,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[6, 7]","Ludicrous as it may seem to some, reviewing ""(The Incredible) Hulk"" (movie, comic, or otherwise) is like sampling every course in a smorgasbord. It abounds with numerous substantial themes, some classical, some Shakespearean, others mythological.  ""Hulk"" also dives into psychological trauma from Oedipal and paternal conflict,  emotional and psychological abuse and repression. It even explores the essence of true identity  - is ""Bruce Banner"" merely the facade, and ""Hulk"" the real personality, as his own megalomaniacal father Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte) mentions late in the film- and the intoxicating freedom of self-discovery. The movie is a skillfully constructed blend of other literary and cinematic works, from the obvious (""Frankenstein"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") to the more arcane, bizarre, and obscure (""Altered States,"" ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" ""Swamp Thing!"", and yes, I do dare declare it, ""Superman: the Movie""). Ang Lee has attempted to create an epic drama from a deceptively simplistic and superficial ""creature"" and has succeeded admirably. All the characters reveal vulnerability, dimension, and soul. I was transfixed watching this spectacle, and the Hulk, come to triumphant life.Anyone, I believe, caring to invest a bit of thought and interest in the movie's unfolding should not have had any reason to be bored. In this buffet of a movie, the first 45 minutes of exposition were not merely filler, but the essential meat fleshing out the enigma that the reserved, diffident, frustrated, and emotionally constipated Bruce Banner is. Eric Bana managed to convey this emotional repression and yet still evoke my sympathy, just as David Jansen did as Richard Kimble in ""The Fugitive"", yet another inspiration. His interaction with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) was fascinating and seminal because although she claimed to be disillusioned with Bruce's impassivity, inevitably she could never cut herself away from him because, as the backdrop of her life demonstrated, she, too, is Bruce's alter ego and soulmate, destined to help in his healing and salvation.Despite the various themes swirling around, I feel ""Hulk"" is ultimately a movie dealing with the triumph of self-discovery, catharsis, and redemption. Bruce was doomed to an eternal prison of self-ignorance and loneliness inflicted by his wildly iconoclastic, obsessed father. Ironically, the gamma radiation gives him the key, because, like the potion in ""Swamp Thing"", the rays did not transform him so much as made him more of what he truly is. It is as the Hulk that Bruce salvages lost memories of his traumatic childhood. It is as the Hulk that Bruce retaliates against specific tormentors, rather than indiscrimately attack everyone in sight (as a truly mindless monster will). It is as the Hulk that Bruce embraces the heady feeling of power and freedom and begins to examine himself at the same time. Hulk is often described as a ""tragic figure"" and ample evidence exists of that in the movie, with his anguished roars of wrath and pain, his innocent, soulful stares when he is relatively calm, and, yes, his attempts to put his power to good use (e.g., saving Betty from the freakish Hulk dogs and trying to save the jet from crashing into the Golden Gate Bridge. I think Ang Lee was trying to chronicle the birth of a new ""Superman"", crude, terrifying, and unrelenting at first, but striving to become a true, caring, FORGIVING, superhero (as he demonstrates when he shakes the soldiers out of the tank turret before destroying it and during his climactic battle with his berserk, ""Absorbing Man"" father). Ultimately, Ang Lee transcends the tragedy of the Hulk's origin to suggest that, with luck, Bruce/Hulk will overcome their horrific legacy and the uncomprehending hostility of mankind to become a fully contributory and valuable member (not just a scientific genius) of the world.As you can see, I could turn the ""Hulk"" into a Ph.d dissertation. I am sure some graduate student already has. Yet, lest you think I am some verbose intellectual snob, let me assure you I also enjoyed the Hulk's visceral as well as cerebral pleasure. The entire desert/San Francisco battle sequence was taut, exciting, and exhilarating. The CGI behemoth, I felt, was utterly convincing and compelling, both in close-up and during his prodigious, soaring leaps. Hulk's phenomenal powers themselves are not a curse, as Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, but a blessing in an ""inhuman disguise"". Hulk revels in his power; during one of his stratospheric leaps, he actually reminded me of Superman in the 1978 movie just soaring through the air for the sheer joy of it.In conclusion, I believe Ang Lee successfully delivered both an intellectual and emotionally stimulating and evocative movie and created a respectful homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classically archetypal character. And yes, I own the DVD.",4,"""Simple Green Brute"" Story is Surprisingly Rich",1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,4922,"['Ludicrous', 'may', 'seem', 'reviewing', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'comic', 'otherwise', 'sampling', 'course', 'smorgasbord', 'numerous', 'substantial', 'themes', 'classical', 'Shakespearean', 'others', 'mythological', 'Hulk', 'also', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'Oedipal', 'paternal', 'conflict', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'abuse', 'repression', 'even', 'essence', 'true', 'identity', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'merely', 'facade', 'Hulk', 'real', 'personality', 'own', 'megalomaniacal', 'father', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Banner', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'mentions', 'late', 'film-', 'intoxicating', 'freedom', 'self-discovery', 'movie', 'skillfully', 'constructed', 'blend', 'other', 'literary', 'cinematic', 'works', 'obvious', 'Frankenstein', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'more', 'arcane', 'bizarre', 'obscure', 'Altered', 'States', 'Island', 'Dr.', 'Moreau', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'yes', 'do', 'dare', 'declare', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'attempted', 'create', 'epic', 'drama', 'deceptively', 'simplistic', 'superficial', 'creature', 'succeeded', 'admirably', 'characters', 'reveal', 'vulnerability', 'dimension', 'soul', 'was', 'transfixed', 'watching', 'spectacle', 'Hulk', 'come', 'triumphant', 'life.Anyone', 'believe', 'caring', 'invest', 'bit', 'thought', 'interest', 'movie', 'unfolding', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'reason', 'be', 'bored', 'buffet', 'movie', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'exposition', 'were', 'not', 'merely', 'filler', 'essential', 'meat', 'fleshing', 'out', 'enigma', 'reserved', 'diffident', 'frustrated', 'emotionally', 'constipated', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'managed', 'convey', 'emotional', 'repression', 'yet', 'still', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'just', 'David', 'Jansen', 'did', 'Richard', 'Kimble', 'Fugitive', 'yet', 'inspiration', 'interaction', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'was', 'fascinating', 'seminal', 'claimed', 'be', 'disillusioned', 'Bruce', 'impassivity', 'inevitably', 'could', 'never', 'cut', 'away', 'because', 'backdrop', 'life', 'demonstrated', 'too', 'Bruce', 'alter', 'ego', 'soulmate', 'destined', 'help', 'healing', 'salvation.Despite', 'various', 'themes', 'swirling', 'feel', 'Hulk', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'dealing', 'triumph', 'self-discovery', 'catharsis', 'redemption', 'Bruce', 'was', 'doomed', 'eternal', 'prison', 'self-ignorance', 'loneliness', 'inflicted', 'wildly', 'iconoclastic', 'obsessed', 'father', 'Ironically', 'gamma', 'radiation', 'key', 'potion', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'rays', 'did', 'not', 'transform', 'so', 'much', 'made', 'more', 'what', 'truly', 'Hulk', 'Bruce', 'lost', 'memories', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'Hulk', 'Bruce', 'specific', 'tormentors', 'rather', 'indiscrimately', 'attack', 'everyone', 'sight', 'truly', 'mindless', 'monster', 'will', 'Hulk', 'Bruce', 'heady', 'feeling', 'power', 'freedom', 'examine', 'same', 'time', 'Hulk', 'often', 'described', 'tragic', 'figure', 'ample', 'evidence', 'exists', 'movie', 'anguished', 'roars', 'wrath', 'pain', 'innocent', 'soulful', 'stares', 'when', 'relatively', 'calm', 'yes', 'attempts', 'put', 'power', 'good', 'use', 'e.g.', 'saving', 'Betty', 'freakish', 'Hulk', 'dogs', 'trying', 'save', 'jet', 'crashing', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'think', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'was', 'trying', 'chronicle', 'birth', 'new', 'Superman', 'crude', 'terrifying', 'unrelenting', 'first', 'striving', 'become', 'true', 'caring', 'FORGIVING', 'superhero', 'when', 'soldiers', 'tank', 'turret', 'destroying', 'climactic', 'battle', 'berserk', 'Absorbing', 'Man', 'father', 'Ultimately', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'tragedy', 'Hulk', 'origin', 'suggest', 'luck', 'Bruce/Hulk', 'will', 'overcome', 'horrific', 'legacy', 'uncomprehending', 'hostility', 'mankind', 'become', 'fully', 'contributory', 'valuable', 'member', 'not', 'just', 'scientific', 'genius', 'world.As', 'can', 'see', 'could', 'turn', 'Hulk', 'Ph.d', 'dissertation', 'am', 'sure', 'graduate', 'student', 'already', 'lest', 'think', 'am', 'verbose', 'intellectual', 'snob', 'let', 'assure', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Hulk', 'visceral', 'as', 'well', 'cerebral', 'pleasure', 'entire', 'desert/San', 'Francisco', 'battle', 'sequence', 'was', 'taut', 'exciting', 'exhilarating', 'CGI', 'behemoth', 'felt', 'was', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'close-up', 'prodigious', 'soaring', 'leaps', 'Hulk', 'phenomenal', 'powers', 'are', 'not', 'curse', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'mentioned', 'review', 'blessing', 'inhuman', 'disguise', 'Hulk', 'revels', 'power', 'one', 'stratospheric', 'leaps', 'actually', 'reminded', 'Superman', '1978', 'movie', 'just', 'soaring', 'air', 'sheer', 'joy', 'it.In', 'conclusion', 'believe', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'successfully', 'delivered', 'intellectual', 'emotionally', 'stimulating', 'evocative', 'movie', 'created', 'respectful', 'homage', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'classically', 'archetypal', 'character', 'yes', 'own', 'DVD']",N/A

The stories of the Hulk aren't about a costumed hero fighting criminals. They are about a man consumed with anger, who is driven to great lengths trying to deal w/his affliction, and the villainous characters who attempt to take advantage of Hulk and his gamma-powered strength. This film is about as ""deep"" as one could want from a film about a ""superhero"", while retaining it's strong comicbook feel.Ang Lee's direction in this film is evident in it's character-driven plot, sensitive view of the relationship between father/child, and the traumatic effects of coming from a home broken by tragedy. The film has amazing performances by Eric Bana (Bruce Banner), Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross), and Sam Elliot (General Ross). Bana's Banner is an intelligent and principled man who struggles deeply w/feelings of abandonement. Connelly plays a woman who has struggled to help a man torn apart by anger and doubt, with compassion and understanding. Sam Elliott turns in another fantastic performance as General Ross - a fiery, old soldier who's anger towards and distrust of Banner are softened by his deep-seated affection for his daughter.This film is a great example of how the comicbook movie need not be riddled with comedic undertones and can still draw in those w/an open mind - truly, a modern classic.",5,True to the classic comic title,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1507,"['most', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'tell', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'even', 'downright', 'bad', 'majority', 'people', ""didn't/do"", ""n't"", 'ever', 'read', 'original', 'comic', 'series', 'Hulk', 'stories', 'Hulk', 'are', ""n't"", 'costumed', 'hero', 'fighting', 'criminals', 'are', 'man', 'consumed', 'anger', 'who', 'driven', 'great', 'lengths', 'trying', 'deal', 'w/his', 'affliction', 'villainous', 'characters', 'who', 'attempt', 'take', 'advantage', 'Hulk', 'gamma-powered', 'strength', 'film', 'deep', 'one', 'could', 'want', 'film', 'superhero', 'retaining', 'strong', 'comicbook', 'feel.Ang', 'Lee', 'direction', 'film', 'evident', 'character-driven', 'plot', 'sensitive', 'view', 'relationship', 'father/child', 'traumatic', 'effects', 'coming', 'home', 'broken', 'tragedy', 'film', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'General', 'Ross', 'Bana', 'Banner', 'intelligent', 'principled', 'man', 'who', 'deeply', 'w/feelings', 'abandonement', 'Connelly', 'woman', 'who', 'struggled', 'help', 'man', 'torn', 'apart', 'anger', 'doubt', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'General', 'Ross', 'fiery', 'old', 'soldier', 'who', 'anger', 'towards', 'distrust', 'Banner', 'are', 'softened', 'deep-seated', 'affection', 'daughter.This', 'film', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'comicbook', 'movie', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'riddled', 'comedic', 'undertones', 'can', 'still', 'draw', 'w/an', 'open', 'mind', 'truly', 'modern', 'classic']",N/A

I wasn't expecting too, to be honest; it had so much negative criticism that when I watched it on SKY last night I was not expecting anything but a pile of pants.It actually turned out to be quite good, very intelligent for a ""super hero"" movie and very well acted by all concerned.Okay so it didn't follow the Hulk comic book we all know and love but who cares?  It was a GOOD movie, fun, moving, humorous with spectacular special effects.  I even liked the way Ang Lee sectioned the screens off into blocks so that we could see several perspectives, I thought that was neat and quite clever.The plot was marginally more complex than most but then THIS is an Ang Lee film so with action you get intelligence which is a rare commodity these days and should be savoured like a good quality port if you get my drift?Eric Bana as the scientist Bruce Banner was a good choice of actor, and Nick Nolte was brilliant as the deranged scientist whose mutated genes he passed on to his unsuspecting son during conception.We have the delectable Sam Elliot (even with grey hair!) as the ruthless military man Ross trying to kill the Hulk, his estranged daughter Betty, played by the versatile actress Jennifer Connolly (who is in love with the Hulk's human persona, Eric and of course a baddie in the form of Talbot played by the unknown actor Josh Lucas a somewhat supercilious but ambitious young man who gets bounced around like a rubber ball by a very, very cross Hulk and meats a sticky end in the best comic book tradition.This is a fairly action packed film, with lots of great and fun special effects, the mutated dog fight with the Hulk is great, and a frothing mouthed enraged poodle trying to get at Betty in her car is totally tongue in cheek but very well done.  I also liked the San Francisco scene with the Hulk ripping up the road as he runs UNDER it and the domino effect of the cars he sends hurtling down San Francisco's steep streets, a sweet moment in the film I have to say!And as for all those critics who have complained about how unrealistic this film is, erm, excuse me, this is just a fantasy film and when you are making fantasy come to life on celluloid you can over step the boundaries of physics, just simply because you can!We also get a cameo by the original Hulk Lou Ferrigno who has a walk on part as a security guard; I like the fact that Ang Lee acknowledged the past as well as the future because I remember and still love the original Hulk series, as cheesy and as dated as it is now!All in all Ang Lee did a great job with this film and I don't care what anyone else says, it's worth watching and its worth getting on DVD because the first time around you don't get to see every little gem he has put into this movie.Some movies you have to think about when you watch them others you can watch and forget, with this version of The Hulk you have to think so using your brain cells is a must which I know is REALLY hard for some members of the moving going general public, must be all the ""E's"" in the butter popcorn they are eating is all I can say.",5,"He's green, mean and he's HERE!",1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,3098,"['liked', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'negative', 'criticism', 'when', 'watched', 'SKY', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'anything', 'pile', 'pants.It', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'intelligent', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'concerned.Okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Hulk', 'comic', 'book', 'know', 'love', 'who', 'was', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'fun', 'moving', 'humorous', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'even', 'liked', 'way', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'sectioned', 'screens', 'off', 'blocks', 'so', 'could', 'see', 'several', 'perspectives', 'thought', 'was', 'neat', 'quite', 'clever.The', 'plot', 'was', 'marginally', 'more', 'complex', 'most', 'then', 'THIS', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'so', 'action', 'get', 'intelligence', 'rare', 'commodity', 'days', 'should', 'be', 'savoured', 'good', 'quality', 'port', 'get', 'drift', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'scientist', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'actor', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'was', 'brilliant', 'deranged', 'scientist', 'mutated', 'genes', 'passed', 'unsuspecting', 'son', 'conception.We', 'have', 'delectable', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'even', 'grey', 'hair', 'ruthless', 'military', 'man', 'Ross', 'trying', 'kill', 'Hulk', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Betty', 'played', 'versatile', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'who', 'love', 'Hulk', 'human', 'persona', 'Eric', 'course', 'baddie', 'form', 'Talbot', 'played', 'unknown', 'actor', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'somewhat', 'supercilious', 'ambitious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'bounced', 'rubber', 'ball', 'very', 'very', 'cross', 'Hulk', 'sticky', 'end', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'tradition.This', 'fairly', 'action', 'packed', 'film', 'lots', 'great', 'fun', 'special', 'effects', 'mutated', 'dog', 'fight', 'Hulk', 'great', 'frothing', 'mouthed', 'enraged', 'poodle', 'trying', 'get', 'Betty', 'car', 'totally', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'liked', 'San', 'Francisco', 'scene', 'Hulk', 'ripping', 'up', 'road', 'domino', 'effect', 'cars', 'hurtling', 'down', 'San', 'Francisco', 'steep', 'streets', 'sweet', 'moment', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'complained', 'how', 'unrealistic', 'film', 'erm', 'just', 'fantasy', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'making', 'fantasy', 'come', 'life', 'celluloid', 'can', 'over', 'step', 'boundaries', 'physics', 'just', 'simply', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'cameo', 'original', 'Hulk', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'who', 'walk', 'part', 'security', 'guard', 'like', 'fact', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'acknowledged', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'future', 'remember', 'still', 'love', 'original', 'Hulk', 'series', 'cheesy', 'as', 'dated', 'now', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'worth', 'watching', 'worth', 'getting', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'little', 'gem', 'put', 'movie.Some', 'movies', 'have', 'think', 'when', 'watch', 'others', 'can', 'watch', 'forget', 'version', 'Hulk', 'have', 'think', 'so', 'using', 'brain', 'cells', 'must', 'know', 'REALLY', 'hard', 'members', 'moving', 'going', 'general', 'public', 'must', 'be', 'E', 'butter', 'are', 'eating', 'can', 'say']",N/A

584757,A2VUP5US1F5HG5,B00005JKC3,K. Jump,"[5, 6]","I wanted so bad to like this movie, and in fact was pretty sure I would.  The previews certainly looked good, and with Ang Lee at the helm of a big budget production featuring eye-popping CGI with all the resources of one of Marvel Comics' best series' to draw upon, what could go wrong?Sadly, just about everything.The origin sequence, which appears to be based more on Frankenstein than the Hulk comic book, is convoluted and disorienting.  There are too many flashbacks and throwing Bruce Banner's demented father into the mix was a terrible miscue. The basic gamma bomb origin from the comic is given a conspiracy theory angle that might have worked on the X-Files but flags miserably here and the film never recovers.The bulk of the film is uneven, slow, and pretentious.  There are too many badly developed but lengthy plot threads all playing out simultaneously--the gamma bomb, the military conspiracy, Bruce's relationship with Betty, Bruce's relationship with his father, Betty's relationship with HER father, the transformation of David Banner into the Absorbing Man--and everything just slowly unravels for an agonizing 138 minutes that actually seems like a lot more.One would expect the action sequences to steal the show and atone for many sins, but in reality there aren't that many action scenes and the ones that we do see aren't always handled well.  A case in point is the Hulk's battle with the mutant dogs.  It's too dark to make out clearly and rather pointless anyway.  The Hulk's run-ins with the Army are much better but are a long time in coming, and the climactic showdown between Hulk and the Absorbing Man is for all its technical pyrotechnics highly unconvincing, with a resolution that is perhaps supposed to be mystical but is instead hopelessly absurd and totally unmoving.The cast clearly tries hard but has little to work with and the results are decidedly mixed.  Jennifer Connelly is an empathetic and engaging Betty Ross and makes a great damsel in distress, while Sam Elliott nails General Thunderbolt Ross dead-on.  On the other hand, Eric Bana, perhaps because he is shackled by such a disparate script, portrays a rather lifeless and unconvincing Bruce Banner.  Nick Nolte, definitely a talented actor by any measure, mumbles and stumbles his way through the movie as Bruce's maniacal father, David.  The role is an inherently bad one that should have been left out--it wasn't, and Nolte struggles in vain to do anything of value with it.The FX and CGI on the other hand are quite good, and the unaccountably spartan action scenes are if nothing else spectacular, even if they often misfire.  The Hulk himself is a bit of an enigma, which is perhaps as it should be.  Though not especially realistic he is somehow lifelike, and is generally much more sympathetic than Bruce Banner himself.  There is a certain pathos in Hulk's animated features that most of the human actors never match.The biggest problems with this movie are script and direction.  The storytellers tried to do too much and fell short.  The fact that alterations to the details of the comic book were made is not so much the problem as is the overall direction the movie tries to go in.  The decision to make a dark movie was not necessarily a bad one, but the execution is sorely lacking.  Tim Burton's Batman is a dark comic book adaptation as well, but it retains the wonder and fun of its source material.  Ang Lee's Hulk is just downright depressing. A less heavy-handed approach would have worked better.For all that I don't like about this movie, I am glad the end leaves room for a possible sequel.  There is enough good in this effort to potentially build on, so perhaps the creators will learn from their mistakes and give the Hulk the movie he deserves.  Maybe we'll even get to see a CGI Abomination go toe to toe with a revitalized Hulk--what a battle that could be!  Until then, you might want to check out some of the old Bill Bixby and Lou Ferreigno episodes from the classic TV show.

584761,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00005JKC3,"Maine Writer ""David""","[2, 2]","There is something special about Ang Lee's Hulk.  Much of it has to do with his style.  Lee has an almost magical sense of story, wading deeply into the backwaters of the subconscious, drawing out performances that ripple on the surface just enough to reveal the deep storms shifting within.  He is Jungian and Zen at the same time, understanding that placid water often disguises complex harmonies, subcutaneous rhythms.  Lee is, in short, the perfect storyteller for this tale of modern man, of alienation, of repressed anger, of denial of our true natures as mystical, animal creatures and, at the same, time rational beings that are trapped in a world in which neat rules are nothing more than a veneer.  There is a scene at the very end of Hulk in which David Banner tells his son, David, that his essence lies not in the thin shell of humanity, but in the torrential subconscious beneath--the place from which all strength, all righteousness, and all virtue springs.  It is from that powerful place beneath the protective skin of rational thought that one man might find away to save humanity from itself, or destroy everything in trying.One might begin this review by acknowledging that the first half of Hulk might seem a bit slow, the way ordinary life seems slow, turgid, and familiar.  We are drawn into the lives of the characters in a way that current cinematic trends abhor.  Hulk does not begin with action and end with action.  It begins with veiled childhood memories, a story of dysfunctionality told through the eyes of a mysterious man who is both father and reckless scientist.  He is a man who, we learn later, is driven by that greatest of human qualities, and the wellspring of great peril: curiousity.  He is challenging the Heavens, we learn, by trying to improve upon man by unleashing man's essence.  And so, he turns the experiment upon himself, and then passes along the mutated genetics to a child who soon reveals himself as different, almost autistic in his connections to the world, and harboring the first generation of an almost alchemical secret, one which turns human flesh into a power that is almost God-like in its scope.From the mysterious events of his childhood, David Banner, like all of us, lives out the psychic wounds in a failed relationship, in an inability to emote, in a laser-beam like focus on his ""work.""  He is a modern day ""every man"" for whom denial and obsession with work mask deep-seated alienation, rage, and denial.  All it takes is a blast of gamma radiation to set the stage for a torrential emotional outburst.  Like the protagonist in Fight Club, this is a man getting in touch with his feral, emotional roots.  And, as might be expected, he likes it.The second half of Hulk is a stunningly efficient, and eminently satisfying, escapist adventure that amply fulfills the promise of the first, introspective hour.  The same kids who sat quietly through the first half will cheer at the amazing feats of strength, daring, courage, and, in two key sequences, compassion and heroism.

584762,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JKC3,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","Yes, the Incredible Hulk, that monstrous, green apparition that became the rage in comics in the early sixties and television icon in the seventies is back on screen. And although a normal man still grows in size enough to split his shoes and shirt, his pants remain made of some elasticized material that never breaks. Those of us on the heavier side are still seeking out this material as I write.HULK made its way to the big screen in the biggest way possible. It was being touted as the next best thing since sliced bread before it even arrived. Directed by Ang Lee who was coming off of his art house AND theatrical hit CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, many were making predictions that this film would combine the pop culture found in comics with the artistic integrity found in this director. Face it, it was a no win situation for critics everywhere.But for audiences it was different. The hype surrounding the movie was as enormous as the Hulk himself. Anyone who blindly accepted that this movie would be the best movie ever made had no choice but to walk away disappointed. But those who went in looking for nothing more than a good movie, a movie that would capture the essence and imagination found in the pages of those brightly inked comics of the past were delighted.Story time. The story begins in the past when David Banner is researching DNA and trying his best to make a human that will renew its own body cells when harmed or injured. When the military doesn't allow him to try this on humans instead of animals, he infects himself. Not long after, he and his wife have a child. Recognizing that his son's DNA contains cells that were affected, he begins to search for a solution to change him back. Stopped by the military when they discover what he has been up to, he blows up the base and heads home. This portion of the film takes up the first minutes and is told in quick fashion, ending with David's son Bruce not recalling all that happened and waking from this nightmare.Moving forward, Bruce (Eric Bana) has grown into a young scientist himself, researching much of the same ideas his birth father had. At his side in this research is Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), his now ex-girlfriend. All of their attempts to replicate the adaptive powers of amphibians, their ability to renew cells when damaged, have ended in short term success and long term failure. The frogs blow up. An accident in the lab exposes Bruce to the same nanomites and gamma radiation the frogs were hit with. But instead of blowing up, he changes. The experiment works on him, recharging his body.The down side is revealed that night when Bruce's nightmares awake an anger, a rage, within. That rage changes him as well. The passive Bruce Banner finds his body physically altering until he becomes the primal essence of man, of himself. He turns into the overpowering Hulk.Green skinned, standing well over 9 feet tall, body formed of hyper increased muscles, Hulk leaves the hospital bed Banner was sleeping in. And as he makes his way into the world, everyone is well aware that the military will take notice and track him down.Part of what change Bruce while in that bed was a visit by the night janitor. It turns out that he is very familiar with Bruce since he is in fact his father David (Nick Nolte). Revealing himself and portions of what happened in Bruce's past (since Bruce was raised by adoptive parents and never told the truth), he is the catalyst that invokes the rage inside if Bruce.A multiple cat and mouse game follows with Betty trying to help Bruce, her ex-beau Talbot (Josh Lucas) trying to steal the program they were working on and eliminate Bruce as a competitor for Betty's affections. Betty's father, General Ross (Sam Elliott) tries to save his daughter from a man he fears (knowing all about Bruce's past) and sets out to gather the results of this experiment for military purposes at the same time. Bruce's father David attempts to harness the power and change from Bruce by using DNA samples found in hair left behind and applying them to his dogs and later on to himself. And through it all, Bruce is left to sort out each event on his own, with no help from anyone save Betty who realizes just how much he truly means to her.This story could be called a simple retelling of Beauty and the Beast. But it goes beyond that. It talks about the rage that we all keep in check, never saying the things that we would love to say from complaining about low wages to flipping off the bad driver on the highway. It talks about the inner beauty of a person overcoming the surface that is visible. And it talks about the abuse of power, of scientist willing to risk their souls because perhaps they don't believe in them anymore. But most of all, this movie brings alive the pages that we once read so long ago and makes them real.The standout in this movie, the make or break necessary to pull it off, is of course the visualization of the Hulk himself. Lee decided not to follow in the footsteps of the television series and instead opt for complete CGI (computer generated image). And the folks behind the special effects here have made the Hulk seem more real than any CGI images we have seen before. The rampaging Hulk would have been the easiest thing to do, with quick cuts and motion galore. But the passive Hulk, the one with facial expressions and emotion, that is where they truly shine. And the fact that he actually DOES resemble Bana is remarkable.No easy sell as was SPIDER-MAN, this movie is entertaining throughout. Don't go in looking for the television series. You won't find it. Instead, go in looking for a return to the original story. Go in looking for a visual feast in special effects. Go in without unreasonable expectations. If you do so, you will find that this movie delivers on all counts.For die hard fans, the DVD comes with a glut of extras, everything from a look at how the Hulk was made on film to interpretations of various scenes if they were drawn by some of the top artists working in comics today. All of the extras make this DVD one worth owning.",4,PURPLE PANTS STILL REFUSE TO SPLIT,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,6111,"['Yes', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'monstrous', 'green', 'apparition', 'became',

584763,AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V,B00005JKC3,"Matthew Perri ""Matthew Perri""","[3, 4]","""What scares me the most is that when it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control, I like it.""--Eric Bana as Bruce Banner in ""HULK""I was ready to hate this film when I sat down to watch it. After the end credits rolled, the first word out of my mouth was, ""Wow"". I am now convinced that one of these days, Marvel Comics will fail, its luck will run out and they will make a comic book film that will fall flat on its face. With Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil and the X-Men sequel as well as the more visceral Blade series, and now, ""Hulk"", I don't see that happening anytime soon. And no, the doomed-to-fail-black-sheep-comic-son ""The Punisher"" doesn't count. I never got that comic anyhow.Eric Bana plays scientist Bruce Banner who has something under his skin. Something simmers ominously, waiting to bust out of his meager frame. He is hostile towards Talbot (Josh Lucas), a man who threatens to end his project, distant from his old girlfriend Betty (Jennifer Connelly), even though he works with her, and is generally always on edge.He also has horrible memory-flashes about a strange event in his childhood which includes the fate of his mother and father but much like the puzzle that is his life, he can't seem to put the pieces together well enough to solve things. What makes things worse is that he's being stalked by a strange decrepit old man who claims to be his father (Nick Nolte) who may hold the secret to everything he is.It isn't until Banner is involved in a potentially dangerous accident in his lab that everything is brought to a head. Banner protects one of his colleagues but throws himself on top of a machine that is highly radioactive...and it throws him into a coma. When he awakens in a hospital and is confirmed by a doctor as completely healthy, things still don't seem to make sense. Any other human being would have been killed by exposure to Gamma radiation, and by that rationale, Banner should be dead but instead, it proves to be the missing piece of Banner's puzzle.Upon another meeting with his father after his accident, his anger is suddenly unlocked. Banner gets upset...REALLY gets upset. Uncontrollaby, he transforms into a monster with incredible strength and agility and uses it to fight those who really tick him off, and that includes Talbot and Betty's father, General Ross (Sam Elliot), who want to extract his DNA and, true to ""secret government"" form, use it to build a race of soldiers who are indestructable and can fight forever.The film is directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), who once said to an interviewer ""I don't know how to make a comic book, but I do know how to make a Greek tragedy."" He lied to us...or at least he lied about not knowing how to make a comic book movie. Based on a script which includes the writing talent of comic book vets Stan Lee and the much-welcomed ""father"" of the ""Hulk"", Jack Kirby, Bruce Banner is portrayed as he should be: a conflicted human being whose fragile psyche has been traumatized left and right and who has been forever cursed with not being able to control his anger and frustrations in the beast that eventually rips things apart, causing people to loathe and fear him.In this story, we get to examine, first-hand, Banner's fears, worries, hopes, and the destruction of all of the forementioned. Bana is the perfect Banner. Nerdy, but not quite nerdy, contained, but conflicted, he expresses such emotion just by letting us look into his very deep, soulful eyes. Nolte, who plays Banner's father whose concern about solving our genetic flaws outweighs his care for his son, is fantastic. Jennifer Connelly is cast perfectly as Betty Ross who just wants Banner to get past his childhood.""HULK"" is a triumph, a tribute to the comic book as a form of storytelling and artistic talent, with heartfelt emotion rarely seen in a genre that, until recently, has been jeered at by critics and average movie-goers who have been scarred by bombs like ""Batman and Robin"" and the god-awful previews of ""Catwoman"". It's moving and surprisingly deep. Whereas Lee could have cut to more mindless action and things getting torn apart, we get lengthly discussions about life and unwanted memories and glimpse mental battles between father and son as well as father and daughter. Everyone expresses such genuine heart, you would think that they were all given copies of the recent series of ""Hulk"" comic books to read before they performed.The editing is brilliant and accentuates the experience. There are split-screen shots, wipes, and slide-shots that make you feel like you're watching a live-action comic. A great shot that still sticks out in my mind is when the Hulk is racing down a hallway and we see a small screen on the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. It's Talbot and he is trying to get a hold of General Ross to tell him that the Hulk is free and running loose. Ross appears in a small screen in the opposite corner. You see every scene as it happens so you don't miss anything, much like a comic. I haven't seen such inspired and creative editing like that since the first ""Creepshow"" film.Let's hope D.C. Comics is taking notes.***1/2 out of  ****--Matt",4,Big Beautiful Hulk,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,5198,"['What', 'most', 'when', 'when', 'when', 'totally', 'lose', 'control', 'like', 'Eric',

584765,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,B00005JKC3,M. Dog,"[2, 3]","This is a much better movie than I feared it might be. I'll keep this brief. When Bruce Banner gets mad, the movie easily fulfils all hopes. So often computer graphics disappoint in that there is no sense of ""reality."" The action has no weight, and there is no sense of real power. That is not the case here. The special effects folks did an amazing job in conveying the Hulk's sheer size and terrifying strength. When the green giant tangles with the tanks, It really seems like steel is being torn.  And, suffice to say, the &quot;dog fight&quot; scene is literally worth the purchase price (as was Nick Nolte's final raving scene).The Hulk was (and still is) my favorite comic, and I do not feel cheated by this version. But, it must be said, I think Mr. Lee missed something essential in the Hulk myth. What drove the Hulk/Banner character throughout the comic book was an extreme sense of isolation, of being an outsider from the rest of humanity. Bruce Banner was always a man on the outside because of this terrible beast within him, a terrible dark side that could tear loose at any second.  He could never have normal attachments, and he could never lead a normal life. He was just a drifter. Lost. Director Lee went instead with a very modern &quot;dysfunctional family&quot; theme as the source of the Hulk's rage. While it was an interesting take on it, I prefer the more traditional take on the Hulk; i.e. Bruce Banner drifting from town to town with his terrible secret haunting him at every step. This was the aspect that the television series, and original TV movie with Bill Bixby, captured so well. Perhaps we will see more of this in the sequel, as, admittedly, this was kind of an ""origin"" movie.Still, there is more to admire in this version than curse.

584769,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JKC3,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[14, 20]","Ang Lee is a superlative filmmaker, responsible for some of the most unforgettable moments, scenes and films of recent memory: ""The Ice Storm, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,""  ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" and the tender and loving ""Sense and Sensibility."" All of these films deal with the ultra personal aspects of its characters interior lives and Lee views these things from an emotionally available perspective. He is a humanist and a respectful observer of life.So it was with some surprise when I read that Lee was to direct ""The Hulk,"" yet I knew that his approach to this genre film would be like no other and that his take on the material, though unavoidably cut from the same cloth as ""Godzilla"" and ""Superman,"" would be unusual. I was not wrong.Lee's humanity suffuses ""The Hulk"" as the basic storyline deals with the father/child relationship: Bruce Banner (a stalwart Eric Bana), his father David (A wild Nick Nolte) and Betty Ross (an otherworldly, beautiful Jennifer Connolly) and her father Ross (Sam Elliott). Ideally, parents mold and form a child through instruction and example and David literally alters Bruce's life, in a morally suspect scene, by injecting him with toxins thereby setting the course of Bruce's life and the course of the film. David, like Dr. Frankenstein wants to create a super human and thereby control a world that he feels has cast him aside...that won't recognize his genius.""The Hulk"" is a physically beautiful film and Lee's mise en scene cannot be faulted even when he uses the split screen to emulate the comic book genesis of the Hulk character. But ultimately ""The Hulk"" is not a total triumph as the two factions of the film do not quite mesh: Lee's sensibilities and the action necessary to present the physical needs of the Hulk character and the telling of his story even though there are so many gorgeous things here on which to feast the eyes: the scenes of the digital Hulk jumping about the universe that make us forget about his computer origins, the scene with the immense Hulk carrying Betty to safety that recalls King Kong and Fay Wray and Nolte's final scene in which he rages at a cruel, unfair world that brings to mind Lear raging at the sky (I Kid you not...but that's the kind of film this is).""The Hulk"" is a strange hybrid: a rapturously personal, monster movie.

Very weird directing where the screen splits into four different scenes, does more harm than good.  Bruce Banner, a child of parents that lived in a military base that tested nuclear devices like Los Alamos, grows up to be a scientist too.  When he is exposed to a dose of gamma radiation, the genetically mutated cells in his body go crazy and he is transformed into the Hulk using Shrek-like animation techniques.The Hulk in this film looks and moves just like the Hulk in the comic book as opposed to the Lou Ferrigno (he makes a cameo as a guard at the beginning of the film) Hulk of the 80's.  He battles gamma-mutated dogs, the military and his gamma-mutated father (played in an incredibly boring fashion by Nick Nolte).Some of the special effects of the film are great while others look real cheap (the Hulk has a battle in the desert with airplanes that look like they came off a carnival ride instead of like real fighter jets).Sam Elliott is great as General Thunderbolt Ross.

I think people expected this movie to be a brainless blockbuster and were upset when it didnt turn out the way they expected it to be. Hulk is pretty good with a few flaws(which I will mention later). Its definitely better than its given credit for.The movie details Bruce Banner(Eric Bana)'s coming to be the Hulk. It deals with the Hulk's origin from Bruce's childhood to his teenage years. It also deals with his estranged father(Nick Nolte) coming back into his life. It deals with his relationship with Betty Ross(Jennifer Connelly)and her father Thaddeus(Sam Elliott)hatred for Bruce.The acting is good all around. Eric Bana gives a heartfelt performance as Bruce Banner. Jennifer Connelly is a sweetheart as Betty Ross and Sam Elliott is perfect as Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. Nick Nolte is also great as Bruce's eccentric father. Josh Lucas is the quintessential jerk as Talbot.As much as I like this movie I cant give it five stars because...Flaws: 1. The numerous attempts to get us to feel sympathy for Bruce being the Hulk. I applaud the effort but it just doesnt work for me. Bruce never hurts a loved one as the Hulk. We can only feel sympathy for him if he hurts everybody he loves as Hulk. But most of the people he hurts had it coming so to get us to sympathize with him is kind of difficult.2. The split screens. Split screens are useful when there is action. This movie tends to overdue them alot. When there is action split screens are useful but when nothing is happening on screen you waste the effect o split screens.3. Length. I have no problem with this movie being long but there are some scenes in the movie that are superfluous to the storyline and should have been cut.Other than that this movie is pretty good. I'll admit that at first viewing I thought it was decent but second viewing I liked it a lot more.Its definitely better than the instantly forgettable 2008 sequel. And before I leave I must settle this argument. While the 2008 sequel is not bad its not memorable. How can you forget Hulk battling the gamma mutated puppies in this movie? How can you forget the helicopter chase scene? How can you forget Hulk handing Talbot his rear end on a platter? How can you forget the insight about Science and the harmful experiments ran on humans and animals? Hulk 2008 the only thing you remember is a solid performance by Edward Norton and thats it.

It's NOT really a comic book film, although the delightful editing techniques certainly refer to the source material's heritage.This is a horror movie more than anything else. It's like Frankenstein meets Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde, albeit with a dollop of serious familial psychodrama mixed in for some texture.It's always visually and aurally interesting, and the special effects are astonishing.  (Reference made only for comic geeks)The Hulk character looks terrific, I thought. While it's not the character that Gollum was, remember, he has no lines. He roars and tosses tanks like a Olympian hammer throw athlete. There are plenty of glorious action scenes for those of you who care, yet there most definitely is a dense and detailed plot to back it up. After all, this IS Ang Lee we're talking about.I loved the sly references to classic horror films, like King Kong and Frankenstein.The cast is uniformly impressive; again, this IS Ang Lee. Bana, Connelly, Elliott, Nolte...yeah sure sometime they go a little &quot;over the top&quot;, but it all services the story.The visual &quot;look&quot; to the film is highly original as well. Maybe not &quot;original&quot; in that dictionary sense...it borrows a lot from comic book story-telling techniques...but I don't think you will have seen a film that LOOKS like this one does. Inventive color schemes, camera angles, music cue choices and the marvelous editing design all combine most effectively.I found myself more impressed with the film after I viewed the supplementary material. I found I wanted to tell people about this film...to give it a chance.

584779,A2UL0A8GJB4318,B00005JKC3,mljkb,"[57, 73]","The &quot;Hulk&quot; is a good movie, often times great.  The first half of the movie is a long, methodical character study of people under immense emotional torture, especially Bruce Banner (a pitch-perfect Eric Bana) and Betty Ross (Jennifer Connely).  It is hinted that they share a dark past filled with absentee fathers and a secret military project that they might now be working on again, 30 years later.  This first half or so is the reason why the &quot;Hulk&quot; was not well recieved among viewers and critics.  People were expecting either another &quot;Spiderman&quot; or another &quot;X-Men&quot; or its sequel, filled with those films'  brimming everyman qualities and light-pacing throughout, or the Hulk of the 70s t.v. show, who aided people when he had and anger spell.  But director Ang Lee opted for a more tragic approach, with plenty of Freudinized angst, along the lines of repressed memories manifesting themselves in dreams.  And while Lee sometimes overdoes it, his decision ultimately makes &quot;Hulk&quot; far more interesting than the t.v. show whose premise wore thin after a few episodes and a little more intriguing than Marvels past comic-book adaptations .  However, action junkies need not fear.  Things kick into high gear in the film's fast-paced and action-packed final act as Banner escapes from a military compound where they were hoping to harvest him for their own purposes.  He then proceeds to tear up the california desert in a wondrously shot sequence that shows off the ILM's incredibly life-like and belivable Hulk creation and the films' unique style of editing that makes the film feel like a comic-book with skillfully juxtaposed images from various camera shots that describe various scenes that occur simaltaneously in the film.It should be said, though, that &quot;Hulk&quot; is not  as artistically accomplished as Director Lee's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; or perhaps other acclaimed films in his catalog.  &quot;Hulk&quot; at times suffers from uneven pacing, some mind-numbing psycological probing and timid acting.  But overall, &quot;Hulk&quot; stands on its own as a dark, brooding and  spectacular comic-book adaption that had the balls to take the &quot;Hulk&quot; to places no one ever expected something like the &quot;Hulk&quot; to go.  And while having the guts to do something daring is instantly laudable, &quot;Hulk,&quot; even with its flaws, still succeeds surprisingsly well.",4,In the Opinion of the Humble...,1068940800,"11 16, 2003",2003,2466,"['quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'good', 'movie', 'often', 'great', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'long', 'methodical', 'character', 'study', 'people', 'immense', 'emotional', 'torture', 'especially', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'pitch-perfect', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Jennifer', 'Connely', 'hinted', 'share', 'dark', 'past', 'filled', 'absentee', 'fathers', 'secret', 'military', 'project', 'might', 'now', 'be', 'working', 'again', '30', 'years', 'later', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'reason', 'why', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'recieved', 'viewers', 'critics', 'People', 'were', 'expecting', 'quot', 'Spiderman', 'quot', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'sequel', 'filled', 'films', 'brimming', 'everyman', 'qualities', 'light-pacing', 'Hulk', '70s', 't.v', 'show', 'who', 'aided', 'people', 'when', 'had', 'anger', 'spell', 'director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'opted', 'more', 'tragic', 'approach', 'plenty', 'Freudinized', 'angst', 'lines', 'repressed', 'memories', 'manifesting', 'dreams', 'Lee', 'sometimes', 'decision', 'ultimately', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 't.v', 'show', 'premise', 'wore', 'thin', 'few', 'episodes', 'little', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Marvels', 'comic-book', 'adaptations', 'However', 'action', 'junkies', 'need', 'not', 'fear', 'Things', 'kick', 'high', 'gear', 'film', 'fast-paced', 'action-packed', 'final', 'act', 'Banner', 'military', 'compound', 'where', 'were', 'hoping', 'harvest', 'own', 'purposes', 'then', 'tear', 'up', 'california', 'desert', 'wondrously', 'shot', 'sequence', 'ILM', 'incredibly', 'life-like', 'belivable', 'Hulk', 'creation', 'films', 'unique', 'style', 'editing', 'film', 'feel', 'comic-book', 'skillfully', 'juxtaposed', 'images', 'various', 'camera', 'shots', 'describe', 'various', 'scenes', 'occur', 'simaltaneously', 'film.It', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'though', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'not', 'artistically', 'accomplished', 'Director', 'Lee', 'quot', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'other', 'acclaimed', 'films', 'catalog', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'times', 'suffers', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'mind-numbing', 'psycological', 'probing', 'timid', 'acting', 'overall', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'own', 'dark', 'brooding', 'spectacular', 'comic-book', 'adaption', 'had', 'balls', 'take', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'places', 'one', 'ever', 'expected', 'something', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'go', 'having', 'guts', 'do', 'something', 'daring', 'instantly', 'laudable', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'even', 'flaws', 'still', 'surprisingsly', 'well']",N/A

To begin with, he's a giant green man.  And when audiences see a giant green man smashing a tank with his bare hands, they generally aren't sure what to make of it.  It's absurd, sure, but let's be honest, all superheroes are absurd.The Hulk's biggest weakness is, oddly enough, the TV show that made him so popular.  Because it was TV and there weren't great special effects, people tend to think of him as a largish, bodybuilder with marginal superstrength.  Sorry.  The Hulk is a big dog in the world of megamuscles.  And by being truer to the comic than the show, most the audience was confused.Onto the film.  It's good, but slow.  I've watched it a couple of times, and I can't for the life of me figure out what I would've cut out, but it still does kind of creep along at points.  The performances are all strong, particularly Eric Bana as Bruce Banner.  It could've been a throwaway part, but he does solid work portraying a quiet man with deep psychological scars.The Hulk himself is an outstanding creation.  If you forget that giant green man part, you'll see just how incredibly realistic he is, and how soulful his virtual performance is.  The action scenes are terrific, especially the gamma dogs:  a fight that is every bit as brutal as it should be.  Unfortunately, the final confrontation and it's resolution could've been clearer.

Chodoba ""arrbogast""","[21, 29]","For fans of the HULK in all of his incarnations, this film cannot be the best thing ever, because of reasons I want to suggest here.  I rented this after missing it in the theaters so maybe I am missing the big screen experience, but here are my thoughts after watching the film and the extras.  If you havent seen it, then don't read this review.  there are some spoilers (I do think fans should see it, but I also was disappointed) so stop here if you do not want the experience ruined for you.Okay, first we have the origin story.  What made the Hulk's origin so moving is the desperation of the test with the &quot;gamma bomb&quot; and Bruce Banner saving Rick Jones, and sacrificing himself to the bomb's rays.  Here in the film, we have a pseudo-scientific update using &quot;nanomeds&quot; bathed in gamma rays that Bruce already possessed due to his Dr. Frankenstein-like father (Nick Nolte, I will say more about him later).  I have problems with that because why complicate the issue by making another prior origin to the event that transforms Bruce into the Hulk?  It becomes anti-climactic when Bruce is sacrificing himself in the movie.  I may incite arguments from people who loved the film, but really think about it.  Why have his transformation be a two step process? Unless the father/son thing was the impetus for the whole film (which it should NOT have been).  It is true that Peter David has psychoanalyzed Banner in the comics, and it is entertaining to a degree, but to make Bruce and his hulkness a product of his father's tampering, is to change the origin completely!  The tragedy of the Hulk (presented in HULK #1 by JACK KIRBY (shame on the filmmakers for not giving him more credit!) and Stan &quot;the man&quot; Lee) is that it is an accident, that happens to a decent man who is also a genius.  No offense to Eric Bana, but the Bruce Banner in the film is basically there to become the hulk.  You do not buy into his being a genius.  He is too young. My idea of a Banner would have been Kevin Speacy, who could have played a genius, and capture the humanity of the scientist.  Bana is not bringing anything to the table, and he admits it in the 2nd disc.The other thing that I noticed was the misuse of Nick Nolte as the father.  What could have worked were flashbacks to Bruce's childhood and maybe the intro of the anger issues.  But to use the father as the villain is (I'm sorry) stupid.  What made spider man such a success is that the origin story is straightforward, the villain intense, and the tragedy inherent.  HULK is the opposite.  The story is convoluted, the villain nonexistent (the army was always just a 3rd party that hunted the hulk. They do not qualify as &quot;villains&quot;.  They are just &quot;puny humans&quot;. Again, Nick Nolte as the final &quot;showdown villain&quot; makes no sense, even as we have been given his sort of backstory of madness and being locked up for 30 years (?) except maybe to show off some special effects) and the tragedy is less powerful than it could have been because of these things.  Why not have a pure villain? (The Leader, for instance, the REAL absorbing man, or even The Abomination) The film would have been SO much better if the origin was relegated to the first 30 minutes (like Parker's in Spider man) and the rest of the film the plight of the monster, but I guess I am just wishing for things here. For a 2 1/2 hour film, the editing did not speed up the process of telling the story at all, even with the split screening.I want to say something good about the film, and this is because I love comics.  It does try very hard to be a serious drama and succeeds in that you do not laugh at all. They gave HULK the big budget treatment, with a hot current director.  The music is intense from Danny Elfman, and worthy of praise.  It is an emotional film to a degree, but it is so bleak that you feel drained after watching it.  I compare it to Spider man, because Sam Raimi treated spider man seriously, but he kept the element of FUN and ADVENTURE that fans loved.  Ang Lee is so talented, but he is more interested in telling stories about people and their problems, than telling a straightforward action tale.  I don't fault him though, this was a project that probably had hundereds of people poking their noses into it until there was no story left to tell.On the second disc, Gale Anne Hurd (producer of such epics as the terminator series, and the Abyss and forgettable fare like the Relic and Virus.) says that they really &quot;tried to capture the essence of the comics and what comic fans loved about the Hulk.&quot;  Kudos for trying, but speaking as a long time fan of the comics: &quot;You failed Gale.&quot;",3,What's missing?

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 1]","Maybe I should have known better than to have high expectations I did for The Hulk, but considering the cast involved and who's sitting in the director's chair perhaps my expectations were justified.  But despite all the hype and the big names, this big screen mega budget adaptation of The Hulk is ultimately disappointing.  Eric Bana, who gave us such memorable lead characterizations in Chopper and Black Hawk Down, just seems a bit out of place as Bruce Banner: the man struggling to supress the beast within.  Jennifer Connelly, who gets more and more beautiful the older she gets, is a fine choice as Betty Ross, while Sam Elliot (who plays her father General Ross) overacts quite a bit and seems a bit out of place as well.  Nick Nolte however, gives the best performance in the film as Bruce's psychotic father.  Director Ang Lee's use of using split frame shots (like in comic books to fully illustrate scenes) is a nice idea, but it does get quite annoying.  Everyone seems to automatically nitpick the special effects and the CGI creation of the Hulk, but the big green machine himself is superbly animated and designed; and in a few shots actually looks real.  The action scenes themselves are superbly put together as well throughout the first three quarters of the film; up until the climax and finale of the film where the movie turns into an incoherent cartoon.  For me, that is where the film really fell apart, with the final fight scene and climax plus predictable ending which naturally sets the stage for the Hulk to smash and bash his way towards a sequel.  All in all, The Hulk is an ultimately disappointing mega budget miss that aimed high, but fell well below radar.

Okay, don't get me wrong, Ang Lee probably said to himself ""Okay, this movie is about the Hulk but it is also about family relationships, genetics and all these other things that should make this action film a little better"" which is good, but then he goes and directs a version of the Hulk that is anything but action packed at all and it ends up being a really sloppy soap-opera with zero drama or suspense.Eric Bana is usually great but here he delivers a totally flat performance. The story is extremely convoluted and while it tries so hard to be MARVEL, Lee just can not stop himself from playing with the AVID and while he toys with his new montage to make the film look like a comic (great idea but overused!), he forgets to EDIT the film at all. It does not even register as a Superhero movie and starts to move into ""Disaster Flick"" territory only to be completely confused about itself.

I doubt he's the first one in Berkeley to feel strange after playing with chemicals.The Lee brothers, Stan and Ang, put together YET ANOTHER alternate universe and change how a Marvel character was formed.  They do this by making Bruce's father, David, played during the present day scenes by Nick Nolte, injects himself with an experiment to improve physical self-repair. This was before Bruce was conceived; so, Bruce inherited the concoction genetically, and, with the gamma burst, becomes CGI Hulk.Nick Nolte is looking a lot like his recent mug shot and his acting isn't too far off that angle, either.Betty Ross, Bruce's love interest, is played by Jennifer Connelly.  There's only so far you can make a sexy woman seem very nerdy.  Ang Lee overkills the 'beauty and the beast' aspect for the movie.

584792,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00005JKC3,Ping Lim,"[8, 11]","I am more interested in the making of this movie more than the movie itself.  When it was revealed that Ang Lee was to direct this blockbuster, few eye-brows were raised of the choice.  If we sit through the making of the film, it was explained that he's needed to bring sense and sensibility to one of Marvel Comic's most successful franchise.  In the end, we end up with a movie that is neither nor.  It's just the way it is and expectedly, fingers are pointed.  Rumours started to spread about cast and production crews were tense working under a Director who was tunnel-visioned in actualising his vision (nothing wrong with that).  The making of the movie also divulged to us Ang Lee's donning of rubbery suits with sensors on them to feed datas to ILM's software to create the Hulk that he envisioned, & his involvements in the music creation (Ang Lee kept reminding Danny Elfman that his music score should be less Danny Elfman's).  For Ang Lee, the making of this movie is a challenge, to tackle something that he hasn't tackled before. For him, that means trying to merge the art of comics with the art of films and trying to portray the characters here in a three dimensional manner rather than cutboard characters from comics.  Ang Lee endeavoured to give us an insight into Banner and his alter-ago, his tulmutous relationship with his father (played brilliantly by Nick Nolte) who was really a mad scientist who played God, the forbidden love between Banner and Ross (Jennifer Connelly's character).  Sam Elliot was brilliant as a General who was dead-heat in pursuing and terminating Hulk.  He's not a Captain Ahab of Moby Dick's fame but rather, a humane General who was simply doing his job, to the resentment of his daughter, Ross who wanted to reconcile the relationship between the daughter and the father.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I respect the fact that a lot of thoughts and efforts have gone into making this a commendable adult comic movie.  I guess as a result, it becomes the victim of its own success.  People commented about the incredulity of Hulk flying on the air, of him jumping for joy in the Grand Canyon, not being faithful to the comics offering, of the unrealistic projection of the CGI Hulk.  However, if people can see beyond the fact that the CGI is simply a part of the total sum, then, people would start to appreciate how tragic this movie actually is.  This is a undeniably an ambitious movie.  I think Ang Lee has achieved his brief of making an adult movie out of a comic strips but majority of the audience actually wants a candy pop no brainer action movie.  All I can say is that the studio has misread the sentiment of the public and the fault is not with Ang for he did his bit brilliantly, perhaps, too brilliantly.

584796,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B00005JKC3,Ron Sullivan,"[2, 2]","That said though, I TOTALLY understand where people are coming from when they say they didn't enjoy it.Universal really fumbled the ball when they tried to advertise 'Hulk' as a front -to-back action movie. It just isn't, I can't put it any more simply then that. If that's what you are expecting (or had expected) I can almost guarantee you'd come away disappointed.Ang Lee is an art-house director ('Ice Storm' 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon') and that influence very clearly shows here. 'Hulk' is much more a character study of Bruce Banner then it is an action movie. The Hulk as a comic book character was always, quietly, one of the more complex characters in the Marvel universe, as opposed to the rampaging maniac that most people unfamiliar with the comic seem to think he is. Lee's choice to explore the former when most people were actually expecting the latter wound up alienating a great deal of the target audience.That's really a shame too because, although I wasn't a fan of the ending, it's really a terrific movie. The story and plot were really well thought out. The changes that were made to the Hulk's origin made a lot of sense. The performances were all great (Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot really stole the movie).

584797,A2RHBT46LS6DA3,B00005JKC3,"Ryk E. Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God""","[3, 4]","I didn't initially expect much from this movie; the only thing that held out any hope for me was that it was being directed by Ang Lee.This is a solid and well-done reinvention of the Hulk. Many moviegoers have complained about the slow start to action, or the focus on relationships and dramatic dialogue, but it strikes me that such people haven't really paid much attention to the original Hulk.The Incredible Hulk was only partially about a Giant Green Behemoth who Breaks Things When He's Mad. It is, to a great extent, about people -- about the monsters that live inside all of us, about relationships going through change, about obsession, paranoia, fear, and anger.With this movie, we see the seeds of disaster sown early (by Bruce Banner's father, not coincidentally named ""David Banner"" -- the same name chosen for the scientist in the TV version), allowing for a typically comic-book origin that is, at least, a bit easier to swallow for modern day audiences than the original ""exposed to Gamma Bomb radiation"" -- and which, at the same time, preserves virtually all of the ESSENCE of the Hulk's origin.The CGI Hulk works wonderfully on the big screen; the small screen actually detracts somewhat from the experience. I'm not sure if it's showing up flaws that for some reason are less evident on the  movie screen, or if it's just that this, like Titanic's Big Sinking Ship scenes, is something that can't really be fully appreciated on anything that isn't Really Big itself.I *CAN* (yes, can) understand why some people don't like The Hulk. Ang Lee uses many of the same atmospheric tricks he did in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Many of his dramatics are keyed both to the concept of bringing a comic to life, and to maintaining an almost mystical, dreamlike atmosphere to the action. Thus some events don't *quite* make sense, but yet somehow work in the context of the movie.Overall the acting is better than one might have expected -- even if there were mediocre actors cast (I don't know how good most of the main cast normally are) Ang Lee has clearly driven them to give decent performances. Bana's Banner is a heck of a nice guy overall, just with more and more problems always coming to roost right on top of him. This is the way Banner has always been portrayed, and it works. The Hulk himself is given a fair amount of character through expression and action; one interesting point that viewers will note is that the Hulk does his level best to avoid hurting people, even when it seems that it would be a LOT easier to ignore that point and just get to the smashing.Overall, a good movie.

584800,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B00005JKC3,Scott Kolecki,"[3, 4]","I liked it.I must note that it does not rank on par with some of the truly great superhero movies that have been filmed in recent years.  It is certainly not on par with Sam Raimi's &quot;Spiderman&quot; or Tim Burton's &quot;Batman&quot;, but then, the Hulk has never had the following or commercial popularity of these other characters.Much credit should be given to Ang Lee, whose vision of this well-known, (if never fully conceived) character remains truly to his own directoral style.  Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), son of David Banner (one of many &quot;tips of the hat&quot; to the original television series), grows up without his real parents, raised instead in a foster home.  Ambitious and bright, he pursues a career in advanced science, attempting to develop a new &quot;nano-technology&quot; that will enable people to rapidly heal.  Aided by Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), all seems to be going along fine until a mechanical malfunction results in Bruce's exposure to gama radiation.  This exposure unleashes the Hulk, whose presence in his body has been there since before his birth, when his father (Nick Nolte) performed an experiment on himself and inadvertantly passed his genetically enhanced and altered DNA onto his son.  Now unleashed, Bruce Banner becomes consumed by the anger and rage of the parents that abandoned himand thegovernment that would use him as a weapon.And, as Bruce admonishes, &quot;Don't make me angry...you wouldn't like me when I'm angry...&quot;For it is through his anger that he is transformed.  Ang Lee's monster, far more massive even than Lou Ferrigno's Hulk of the T.V. series, was created using some of the most advanced CGI to date.  The transformations between Bana and CGI are seemless, and, unlike so many CGI characters, the Hulk is convincingly real, with a degree of authenticity that really goes beyond most of what has been seen on the screen so far.There are, of course, weaknesses in this story.  Some can be forgiven, though personally, it felt as though Ang Lee spent too much time on exposition and character development, and not enough time on the culmination of his characters and their conflict.  (NOTE: SPOLIER AHEAD)  In the final showdown in the film, David Banner has transformed himself into a monster by exposing himself to the same gama radiation as his son.  His metamorphosis enables him to capture the energy and strength of whatever he touches, transforming himself into whatever he is in contact with.  As he confronts his son, the battle between the two rages, and suddenly, and with no obvious or appearant reason, his father is defeated.  An explination is given (won't ruin this for viewers), but it left me going, &quot;huh?&quot;In many ways, Lee's depiction of Bruce Banner is a Jekyll/Hyde character, and audiences would feel sympathetic to his plight, were it not for the very dry and unemotional portrayal of this character by Eric Bana.  I am not familiar with any of his other films, but in this particular offering, his performance is dry, without emotion.  Jennifer Connelly, on the other hand, is immensely believable as Betty, whose loyalty and tormented love of Bruce is balanced against her contempt for her father, a high ranking officer chiefly responsible for the torment of both David and Bruce Banner.Perhaps most dis-satisfying about the film was Lee's way of using small windows in the screen to tell portray the film as a series of vignettes placed together to resemble the layout of a comic book.  The idea is clever, and at moments, really works in this film, but for most of it, it is more distracting than anything, making it ever so much more difficult to follow the film.Those criticisms aside, this is still a well developed movie, and far better than some of the other recent superhero fare (Daredevil as one such example).  Rated PG-13 for moments of action style violence and some unsettling images, this is a film that is best suited for slightly older audiences, both for the forementioned reasons, and the level of complexity built into the story.For avid fans of the comic book or the television series, look for both Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno at the beginning of the film in a brief cameo.DVD extras are okay, designed more for the comic book fan than any serious film junkies.-Scott Kolecki",4,Despite The Many Bad Reviews....,1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,4313,"['liked', 'it.I', 'must', 'note', 'not', 'rank', 'par', 'truly', 'great', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'recent', 'years', 'certainly', 'not', 'par', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'quot', 'Spiderman', 'quot', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'then', 'Hulk', 'never', 'had', 'following', 'commercial', 'popularity', 'other', 'characters.Much', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'vision', 'well-known', 'never', 'fully', 'conceived', 'character', 'truly', 'own', 'directoral', 'style', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'son', 'David', 'Banner', 'one', 'many', 'quot', 'tips', 'hat', 'quot', 'original', 'television', 'series', 'up', 'real', 'parents', 'raised', 'instead', 'foster', 'home', 'Ambitious', 'bright', 'career', 'advanced', 'science', 'attempting', 'develop', 'new', 'quot', 'nano-technology', 'quot', 'will', 'enable', 'people', 'rapidly', 'heal', 'Aided', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'be', 'going', 'fine', 'mechanical', 'malfunction', 'results', 'Bruce', 'exposure', 'gama', 'radiation', 'exposure', 'Hulk', 'presence', 'body', 'been', 'birth', 'when', 'father', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'performed', 'experiment', 'inadvertantly', 'passed', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'altered', 'DNA', 'son', 'Now', 'unleashed', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'consumed', 'anger', 'rage', 'parents', 'abandoned', 'himand', 'thegovernment', 'would', 'use', 'weapon.And', 'Bruce', 'admonishes', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'angry', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', ""'m"", 'angry', 'quot', 'anger', 'transformed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'monster', 'far', 'more', 'massive', 'even', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Hulk', 'T.V', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'using', 'most', 'advanced', 'CGI', 'date', 'transformations', 'Bana', 'CGI', 'are', 'seemless', 'so', 'many', 'CGI', 'characters', 'Hulk', 'convincingly', 'real', 'degree', 'authenticity', 'really', 'most', 'been', 'seen', 'screen', 'so', 'far.There', 'are', 'course', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'personally', 'felt', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'exposition', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'culmination', 'characters', 'conflict', 'NOTE', 'SPOLIER', 'AHEAD', 'final', 'showdown', 'film', 'David', 'Banner', 'transformed', 'monster', 'exposing', 'same', 'gama', 'radiation', 'son', 'metamorphosis', 'capture', 'energy', 'strength', 'whatever', 'transforming', 'whatever', 'contact', 'son', 'battle', 'two', 'rages', 'suddenly', 'obvious', 'appearant', 'reason', 'father', 'defeated', 'explination', 'given', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'viewers', 'left', 'going', 'quot', 'quot', 'many', 'ways', 'Lee', 'depiction', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'character', 'audiences', 'would', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'plight', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'dry', 'unemotional', 'portrayal', 'character', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'other', 'films', 'particular', 'offering', 'performance', 'dry', 'emotion', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'other', 'hand', 'immensely', 'believable', 'Betty', 'loyalty', 'tormented', 'love', 'Bruce', 'balanced', 'contempt', 'father', 'high', 'ranking', 'officer', 'chiefly', 'responsible', 'torment', 'David', 'Bruce', 'Banner.Perhaps', 'most', 'dis-satisfying', 'film', 'was', 'Lee', 'way', 'using', 'small', 'windows', 'screen', 'tell', 'portray', 'film', 'series', 'vignettes', 'placed', 'together', 'resemble', 'layout', 'comic', 'book', 'idea', 'clever', 'moments', 'really', 'film', 'most', 'more', 'distracting', 'anything', 'making', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'follow', 'film.Those', 'criticisms', 'aside', 'still', 'well', 'developed', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'recent', 'superhero', 'fare', 'Daredevil', 'one', 'such', 'example', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'moments', 'action', 'style', 'violence', 'unsettling', 'images', 'film', 'best', 'suited', 'slightly', 'older', 'audiences', 'forementioned', 'reasons', 'level', 'complexity', 'built', 'story.For', 'avid', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'television', 'series', 'look', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'beginning', 'film', 'brief', 'cameo.DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'okay', 'designed', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'serious', 'film', 'junkies.-Scott', 'Kolecki']",N/A

However having picked the DVD cheap, and rewatched the film I have revised my opinion somewhat. This is actually rather clever, and mostly very entertaining, and would have got 3 and 1/2 stars if that was possible.The good things about it are the split screen effects, which recreate the comic book style well, and the story which has a little more depth to it than some comic book films. As for the Hulk himself he is a marvellous creation. For one thing he's much bigger than in the original comics, where he was maybe 7ft tall, in this I'd guess he's more like 20ft tall. Of course this doesn't help with the problem of how his trousers stay on!Strangely for me the CGI effects seem to work better at home than when I saw it in the cinema. Maybe I was just expecting too much at the cinema.On the down side I really only have one criticsm and that is that at 2 hours and 10 mins its a little too long.The extras are pretty good with the Hulk Cam certainly being worth watching, as it gives you an entertaining insight into how the film was made and some of the problems of filming around a main character who doesn't exist.So overall at the right price this is well worth getting.",3,Better the 2nd time round,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,1260,"['saw', 'cinema', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'impressed', 'However', 'having', 'picked', 'DVD', 'cheap', 'rewatched', 'film', 'have', 'revised', 'opinion', 'somewhat', 'actually', 'rather', 'clever', 'mostly', 'very', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'got', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'was', 'possible.The', 'good', 'things', 'are', 'split', 'screen', 'effects', 'recreate', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'well', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'Hulk', 'marvellous', 'creation', 'one', 'thing', 'much', 'bigger', 'original', 'comics', 'where', 'was', 'maybe', '7ft', 'tall', ""'d"", 'guess', 'more', '20ft', 'tall', 'course', ""n't"", 'help', 'problem', 'how', 'trousers', 'stay', 'Strangely', 'CGI', 'effects', 'seem', 'work', 'better', 'home', 'when', 'saw', 'cinema', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'cinema.On', 'down', 'side', 'really', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'criticsm', '2', 'hours', '10', 'mins', 'little', 'too', 'long.The', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Hulk', 'Cam', 'certainly', 'being', 'worth', 'watching', 'entertaining', 'insight', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'problems', 'filming', 'main', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'exist.So', 'overall', 'right', 'price', 'well', 'worth', 'getting']",N/A

Unlike so many comic-book adaptations, Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" aims for - and brilliantly achieves - another kind of realism: the emotional kind. James Schamus (surely the most under-appreciated champion of quality American films) has penned a superb story which ensures this isn't just another disposable summer film doing the groundwork for a franchise. It's actually ABOUT something: fatherhood, and the legacy we leave our children. Embracing both the Oedipal subtext and the need for thrilling action, Ang Lee, with typical confidence and subtlety, has delivered a film which is both stunningly entertaining and more than a little moving. The trailers hyped the digital effects, but there's so much more here to be enjoyed. Indeed, the trailers gave away absolutely nothing of Act 3 which includes a climactic performance from Nick Nolte which is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Innovative cinematography and editing are intelligently applied and, as always, Danny Elfman's thrilling score is a perfect match. ""Hulk"" is a film that can and should be enjoyed again and again - it's subtle, intelligent and above all interesting. What a refreshing change for Hollywood.

584812,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00005JKC3,Takis Tz.,"[1, 1]","Ok, who's left out from Marvel comics that hasnt been filmed yet?Well, of all the lines of ""super heroes"" that have paraded through the screens the last decade this has got to be the most entertaining adapration I've seen even if it's riddled with flaws from beginning to end.Explanation needed here, and I'll start out with the flaws:The movie commences in an admittingly very slow pace because those not familiar with the Hulk story need to be introduced to it. Fair enough and it's not that dramatic really as this actually results in the whole film being more compact. It could have been much more pacey and faster when it comes to the first 45 minutes or so.Then as the Hulk finally makes his appearance (and whoa that is some appearance!) other needless mistakes appear as well such as the Hulk being able to make tremendous mile-long leaps as he literraly bounces off mountain tops. The filming however, is so good that even that doesn't annoy as much as it could have.Being that the Hulk is portrayed as having such abilities he should be practically untrappable but yet he gets trapped on several occasions all for the need to set up mammoth fight sequences and showdowns.Then you have the army general responsible for containing da Hulk in his army bases who seems unable to learn any lesson even that involves whole neighborhoods being destroyed or half his personell and equipment being squashed as he gets constantly convinced by his daughter (and simoultaneously Hulk's amore) to ""give him one more chance"". One more chance at what exactly? Well, the Greenman is beyond such niceties as every time he's loose the earth trembles but no, the general is there again always prepared to go soft and let this indestructible creature wreak havoc extraordinaire.But then the positives are actually overwhlemingly dominating the negative aspects of the film.First of all Lee's (the director) excellent editing with multiple frames and freeze frames that pay hommage to the authentic design by the comic makers.Then of course the action scenes themselves. Once the film kicks in and the Hulk appears you wish it'd go on for another 3 hours. We're talking about some of the most entertaining, funny, and at the same time 100% convincing action scenes seen on celluloid. Now, that is bizzare in itself because it envolves scenes where the Hulk dismantles tanks and throws them 100s of meters away, chews at missiles and spits them back, or holds  onto fighter jets to be almost launched into space, and finally, takes on a squadron of fighter hellicopters and blasts them as if they were annoying lil mosquitoes. Huh? Yes, all this does actually seem incredibly believable and filmed in such frenetic pace (in pure contrast with the film's beggining) that it guarantees some serious jaw-dropping.But there's actually more than just the mindless brute force of the Hulkman that makes this film work. Subtle but hardly unnoticeable political touches are there as well as the Hulk's father (Nick Nolte) tries to instill in him some political conscience with anarchistic overviews. ""What about those in uniform and the crimes they've done??"" he screams at Hulk in one sequence. ""What about the poison of religions"" he continues and urges his green creation to keep on the struggle. Nolte incidentally is a very good cast here as he's a glove-fit for this role.The only character that comes across as being particularly poor is the army general but then again why would anyone with a functioning brain mind that? It is after all an army general and as any person dedicated to destruction and catastrophic ""secrets"" isn't ferociously smart to begin with the general's IQ makes actually sense.

584816,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKC3,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","I watched ""Hulk"" simply because it's a film directed by Ang Lee, whose previous works include ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.""  I thought he was not going to do anything wrong.  And I am sorry, but I was terribly mistaken.  Mr. Lee says here and there in the interviews to the effect that he saw something like Greek tragedy in ""Hulk.""  Excuse me, but Hulk is NOT a human being; it's a cultural icon.  You cannot change it like that.The story is long, too long, showing how Bruce Banner aka Hulk finds his power and secret in the past, after being exposed to the deadly gamma radiation.  The first unwise decision is, the film goes all the way back to the time of his father (hence, Greek tragedy) David Banner, who must have done something to his son.  And his son comes to realize his tragic history ... wait, but the film is supposed to be about ""Hulk,"" that ""Incredible"" Hulk?  So why take so much time to see HIM?Anyway, Bruce Banner knows his physical change, so the military people (again) take advantage of his power, led by unashamedly banal characters such as Josh Lucas's selfish tycoon Talbot taking over the institute, where Bruce Banner is working with his love Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  Of course, after being bullyed, Bruce gets very angry ... finally.  It looks like years to reach there.The rest of the story involves Hulk's fight against the army and the father, the latter played by hammy Nick Nolte.  The story is too predictable, even considering its comic book origin, and to make matters worse, the CGIs used to express the movements of Hulk need much improvement.  Actually, some of them are fantastic, when Hulk attacks the tanks and tears them apart.  But some of them are just awful, showing Hulk like a big green rubber ball bouncing up and down.  If that is intentional, I call it a misguided idea.Australian Eric Bana does a fine work as Bruce Banner, convincing as a scientist tormented by his childhood memory, but to be frank, the rest of the cast is huge disappointment.  Ms. Connelly does nothing but worrying and crying, and that worrying is not particularly good.  Worse is her father Sam Elliott, whose ""General"" is nothing but a cardboard character.  Maybe that's also intended so.  But as to Nick Nolte ... well, his overacting just reminded me of the time when he was really cool.In short, Ang Lee thinks too much.  Sorry to say this, but looking at the endless multi-screen shots that are made to resemble the pictures of the comic book, I have to say so.  Do we need that labored job that much?  Why cost so much pain there?  And misguided ideas like an exploding frog, which may make some of the viewers sick (I was).  Do we need that?  ANd that's when we want Hulk, incredibly angry Hulk?  Imagine this ""hulk"" was directed by some newcomer with MTV background.  The critics, who are inexplicably kind to this film, would hurl harsh reviews upon it.

584817,A2G8IR6ENZSQHF,B00005JKC3,"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[3, 4]","I had mixed expectations when I rented &quot;The Hulk&quot;.  It had been Marvel Comics' first post-&quot;X-Men&quot; film that flopped at the box office, and many critics had said it was overlong and far too slow.  And so I was very impressed with how much I enjoyed &quot;The Hulk&quot;.I have to assume that when everyone said the film was too slow, they were referring to its first 45 minutes.  It is true that viewing the first part takes a little patience, especially getting used to Ang Lee's sometimes bizarre camera tricks.  However, these beginning scenes are important buildup, and- unlike for &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot;- I never thought that I was being had with unecessary scenes that were there only to drag out the running time.  &quot;The Hulk&quot; has much higher goals in mind than other comic book films out there, so all of these beginning scenes of character development and talking actually increase the overall quality of the film.  It is true that it's a while before we finally get to see the Hulk, but in a way keeping him off the screen for that long makes his inevitable appearance that much more dramatic and thrilling.Once the action does kick into gear, it hardly ever lets up.  Contrary to what other reviewers have said, the CGI-ed Hulk is quite impressive looking, and the scene where he throws the army tanks and planes around like toys is one of the most memorable I've seen this year.Almost all of the major characters are complex and conflicted, so we feel for them and care what happens to them.  For example, two characters who are technically villains- General Ross and David Banner- both show moments of sympathy.  The guy who plays Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is adequate, though this wasn't an Oscar performance.  Jennifer Connelly is good as his girlfriend, who is also the only person that can calm the Hulk down.  I thought that Nick Nolte gave the most interesting performace- David Banner is completely insane, both sympathetic and dispicable.If the film does have a weak spot, it's the ending.  I'm still trying to figure out exactly what happened in the final battle between Bruce and David Banner.  I understand the outcome, but I'm not sure how or why.  Director Ang Lee probably could have made this whole scene clearer.  Also, the movie is a little on the long side, though as I said earlier not a whole lot obviously needed to be cut.So overall, I found this to be an enjoyable and interesting movie, up there with &quot;X2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; as one of the best comic book adaptations of the current decade.  In some ways, it was even superior to those films.  For those of you out there that haven't seen it, I would recommend it.  For those who don't like it, I won't try to change your mind, but there's no way that &quot;The Hulk&quot; was a complete disaster.  I for one will be sad that it did so poorly at the box office, because now there won't be a sequel.",4,One of the most underrated films of 2003,1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,2934,"['had', 'mixed', 'expectations', 'when', 'rented', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'had', 'been', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'first', 'post-', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'film', 'flopped', 'box', 'office', 'many', 'critics', 'had', 'said', 'was', 'overlong', 'far', 'too', 'slow', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'have', 'assume', 'when', 'everyone', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'were', 'referring', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'true', 'viewing', 'first', 'part', 'little', 'patience', 'especially', 'getting', 'used', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'sometimes', 'bizarre', 'camera', 'tricks', 'However', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'are', 'important', 'buildup', 'and-', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'quot', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'being', 'had', 'unecessary', 'scenes', 'were', 'only', 'drag', 'out', 'running', 'time', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'much', 'higher', 'goals', 'mind', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'there', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'character', 'development', 'talking', 'actually', 'increase', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'true', 'while', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Hulk', 'way', 'keeping', 'screen', 'long', 'inevitable', 'appearance', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'thrilling.Once', 'action', 'kick', 'gear', 'hardly', 'ever', 'up', 'Contrary', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'CGI-ed', 'Hulk', 'quite', 'impressive', 'looking', 'scene', 'where', 'army', 'tanks', 'planes', 'toys', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year.Almost', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'feel', 'care', 'what', 'example', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'technically', 'villains-', 'General', 'Ross', 'David', 'Banner-', 'show', 'moments', 'sympathy', 'guy', 'who', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'adequate', 'was', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'good', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'also', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'calm', 'Hulk', 'down', 'thought', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'gave', 'most', 'interesting', 'performace-', 'David', 'Banner', 'completely', 'insane', 'sympathetic', 'film', 'have', 'weak', 'spot', 'ending', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'final', 'battle', 'Bruce', 'David', 'Banner', 'understand', 'outcome', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'why', 'Director', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'whole', 'scene', 'clearer', 'Also', 'movie', 'little', 'long', 'side', 'said', 'earlier', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'obviously', 'needed', 'be', 'cut.So', 'overall', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'interesting', 'movie', 'up', 'there', 'quot', 'X2', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spider-Man', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'current', 'decade', 'ways', 'was', 'even', 'superior', 'films', 'there', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'change', 'mind', 'way', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'was', 'complete', 'disaster', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sequel']",N/A

584819,A7GSGC0G8R6PW,B00005JKC3,Tyler Tanner,"[3, 4]","Outside of some drawbacks, the Hulk is good and worth seeing multiple times, if at all for the surprising and multiple psychological layers. However if you are looking for major action instead of visceral drama, look elsewhere.I've seen a lot of movies where it looks like the studio and director influences are fighting with each other and the studio ultimatley wins out therby hindering the project. In this case it's the opposite. This is what happens when a director understands aesthetically what the comic is about, but not the general appeal. The Hulk is a very thoughtful and introspective film, but there are times here when thinking outside the box is the major flaw. Ang Lee got the look and the mood of the film down, but I cannot agree enough with another amazon reveiwer who said that the fun was missing from the film. Which is what this needed and what the studio was trying to do.The DVD makes every attempt to compensate for the movies shortcomings. The Bonus features are great. I loved the origin of the Hulk and and the obligitory Stan Lee interview that comes with all Marvel comic adaptations explaining how the character came to be. The in depth featurettes with the CG dogs and the films unique editing process I also enjoyed. Ang lee's commentary is the only feature left to be desired. If he says anything at all, it's mostly esoteric. Example, I swear I'm not lying:(in montone) ""He reminds me of Picasso painting watermelon clowns in pink.""  ............ookay! You go Ang!Back to the film, the CG worked, especially in a great tank battle set in the desert. This was true vintage Hulk and it did not disappoint.Both Nick Nolte and Sam Elliott are in their element and command the screen very time they show up. The chemistry actually is better with Elliot/Conelly then with Connely/Bana and I wound up caring more about the resolution betweeen the father and daughter. It was pleasant surprise that really worked.And kudos to Danny Elfman for not making a ""Danny Elfman"" score. If you would have played me the music with out telling me I never would have guessed. There is some arabic chanting that lends itself unexpectedly well.The editing and transitions were ingenious and well thought out. Where it really stood out was when the Hulk escapes an underground compound. It kept the action going and you could absorb alot at one time. However there were times of sheer grandstanding. An overly long chopper sequence flying in the desert being the prime offender.Another flaw in that stood out was establishing characterization. Which some have blamed on Bana's performance but I desagree. We needed to see a solid example of Bruce Banner's passiveness beforehand thereby making an actual need, cinematically, for the inevitable tranformation.When the first Hulk-Out occurs in the lab, it was, comparitavely, anti-climatic. Banner is alone and it just sort of ... well, happens. In the commentary Ang Lee states that Banner first tranformation was brought on by fear and anxiety. Interesting choice, but it should have been switched with the second Hulk-Out. In that one, the stakes were raised (Betty in Danger, Bruce being provoked)and there was a need for Hulk. I got goose bumps the second time the Hulk appears and was very much aware that I did not the first time, which after forty minutes of exposition, should have happened.Flaws aside, this is a decent watchable film. But it's something you really have to be in the mood for. However lacking in charm and fun, there is a lot of cerebral themes to gnaw on. But it might too much for those looking for a staightforward adaptation of a beloved character.",3,A Comic Book movie that isn't,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,3641,"['drawbacks', 'Hulk', 'good', 'worth', 'seeing', 'multiple', 'times', 'surprising', 'multiple', 'psychological', 'layers', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'major', 'action', 'instead', 'visceral', 'drama', 'look', 'elsewhere.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'where', 'studio', 'director', 'influences', 'are', 'fighting', 'other', 'studio', 'ultimatley', 'out', 'therby', 'hindering', 'project', 'case', 'opposite', 'what', 'when', 'director', 'aesthetically', 'what', 'comic', 'not', 'general', 'appeal', 'Hulk', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'introspective', 'film', 'are', 'times', 'here', 'when', 'thinking', 'box', 'major', 'flaw', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'got', 'look', 'mood', 'film', 'down', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'enough', 'amazon', 'reveiwer', 'who', 'said', 'fun', 'was', 'missing', 'film', 'Which', 'what', 'needed', 'what', 'studio', 'was', 'trying', 'do.The', 'DVD', 'attempt', 'compensate', 'movies', 'shortcomings', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'loved', 'origin', 'Hulk', 'obligitory', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'interview', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'adaptations', 'explaining', 'how', 'character', 'came', 'be', 'depth', 'featurettes', 'CG', 'dogs', 'films', 'unique', 'editing', 'process', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Ang', 'lee', 'commentary', 'only', 'feature', 'left', 'be', 'desired', 'anything', 'mostly', 'esoteric', 'Example', 'swear', ""'m"", 'not', 'lying', 'montone', 'Picasso', 'painting', 'watermelon', 'clowns', 'pink', 'ookay', 'go', 'Ang', 'Back', 'film', 'CG', 'worked', 'especially', 'great', 'tank', 'battle', 'set', 'desert', 'was', 'true', 'vintage', 'Hulk', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.Both', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'are', 'element', 'command', 'screen', 'very', 'time', 'show', 'up', 'chemistry', 'actually', 'better', 'Elliot/Conelly', 'then', 'Connely/Bana', 'wound', 'up', 'caring', 'more', 'resolution', 'father', 'daughter', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'really', 'kudos', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'not', 'making', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'music', 'out', 'telling', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'arabic', 'chanting', 'unexpectedly', 'well.The', 'editing', 'transitions', 'were', 'ingenious', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'Where', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'when', 'Hulk', 'underground', 'compound', 'kept', 'action', 'going', 'could', 'absorb', 'alot', 'one', 'time', 'However', 'were', 'times', 'sheer', 'grandstanding', 'overly', 'long', 'chopper', 'sequence', 'flying', 'desert', 'being', 'prime', 'offender.Another', 'flaw', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'establishing', 'characterization', 'have', 'blamed', 'Bana', 'performance', 'desagree', 'needed', 'see', 'solid', 'example', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'passiveness', 'beforehand', 'thereby', 'making', 'actual', 'need', 'cinematically', 'inevitable', 'tranformation.When', 'first', 'Hulk-Out', 'occurs', 'lab', 'was', 'comparitavely', 'anti-climatic', 'Banner', 'alone', 'just', 'sort', 'well', 'happens', 'commentary', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Banner', 'first', 'tranformation', 'was', 'brought', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'Interesting', 'choice', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'switched', 'second', 'Hulk-Out', 'one', 'stakes', 'were', 'raised', 'Betty', 'Danger', 'Bruce', 'being', 'provoked', 'was', 'need', 'Hulk', 'got', 'goose', 'second', 'time', 'Hulk', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'forty', 'minutes', 'exposition', 'should', 'have', 'happened.Flaws', 'aside', 'decent', 'watchable', 'film', 'something', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'mood', 'However', 'lacking', 'charm', 'fun', 'lot', 'cerebral', 'themes', 'gnaw', 'might', 'too', 'much', 'looking', 'staightforward', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'character']",N/A

So in some ways I can be too critical of some of their movies but in other ways I think I give them a lot of latitude cause I want to like them. I think Eric Bana is a very good actor and did a good job but I am not sure he was really right for the part of Bruce Banner. Jennifer Conley and Sam Elliot were excellent in their characterizations of Betty and Thunderbolt Ross. Nick Nolte? I didn't like the character of Banners dad, that part of the storyline or Nick Noltes acting in the role.Now to the star of the movie, THE HULK. I thought the CGI was fine. I have heard people say they didn't like it and say The Hulk looked like Shrek. I didn't see it that way. The best part of the movie were the scenes with The Hulk. He was done very well. The scene where he fights the irradiated dogs was both good for action and somewhat funny. I also liked when The Hulk went up against the jets, helicopters and tanks.I also heard people say they thought it took to long to get to The Hulk. I didn't mind cause it built the suspense and told the back story but it was a bit long in getting to the good stuff.",3,I liked some of it,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1129,"['am', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'fan', 'So', 'ways', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'critical', 'movies', 'other', 'ways', 'think', 'give', 'lot', 'latitude', 'cause', 'want', 'like', 'think', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'really', 'right', 'part', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Jennifer', 'Conley', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'were', 'excellent', 'characterizations', 'Betty', 'Thunderbolt', 'Ross', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'Banners', 'dad', 'part', 'storyline', 'Nick', 'Noltes', 'acting', 'role.Now', 'star', 'movie', 'HULK', 'thought', 'CGI', 'was', 'fine', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'say', 'Hulk', 'looked', 'Shrek', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'scenes', 'Hulk', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'scene', 'where', 'irradiated', 'dogs', 'was', 'good', 'action', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'also', 'liked', 'when', 'Hulk', 'went', 'up', 'jets', 'helicopters', 'tanks.I', 'also', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'thought', 'took', 'long', 'get', 'Hulk', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'cause', 'built', 'suspense', 'told', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'bit', 'long', 'getting', 'good', 'stuff']",N/A
584821,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00005JKC3,V. Berk,"[11, 15]","4.5/5 stars""Hulk"" 2003 is very different from what you would expect from a typical summer popcorn creature-feature.  From the advertising campaign it appeared to be a mindless special effects extravaganza with little to no plot whatsoever; AKA Summer Fun.  For those who went to see it with that mindset it was undoubtedly a not so pleasant surprise.  Most of whom who saw this on its initial theatrical release obviously had not foreseen Ang Lee's philosophical drama, and they instantly retaliated causing Hulk to fail in most ways.I was surprised, but not in the way these common viewers were, because I loved Hulk.  It is a superhero movie unlike any other comic based film in the last twenty-five years.  This is a film that is filled with heart and emotion and delivers it fully in ways no other film of this genre has done before it.  The art direction and special effects are astounding, and helps bring this comic character to life and oh so much more.The plot starts off rather simply with David Banner, a geneticist who has been studying regeneration, experimenting on various animals and finally ends up injecting himself.  Eventually the mustached scientist has a son - Bruce Banner - who has apparently inherited his father's lab created gene.We now skip forward several years as Bruce begins studying exactly what his father had all those years before: regeneration.  This only ends in what can only be described as disaster as an exposure of ""Gamma Rays"" causes his inherited gene to emerge transforming him into the not so jolly, green behemoth known as the Hulk.  From there we are thrown into several well done action sequences as the military under the command of Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (a very human and well-crafted performance by Sam Elliot) begins an attempt to capture Bruce/Hulk to obtain this gene.  Only complicating Bruce's hectic life is the reappearance of his crazed father who also cares more about the studies of his past opposed to his son's well-being which goes beyond abuse before finally leading up to an enormous CGI confrontation between mutated father and son.The Hulk does lack in the category of CGI at times with quality going up and down during a few cuts, and an adrenaline junkie will not enjoy the level of dialogue and drama that fills this plot that must have been a cinematic fusion between King Kong, Frankenstein and Marvel Comics.  Ang Lee perfectly utilizes the split frame, thus turning this film into a living comic book and the entire cast does their part in moving the plot along.  This isn't so much a superhero film as it is a doorway looking into the delicacy of humanity.  You know and care about the characters, and you can certainly care about the man beneath the giant green muscled frame of the Hulk.  That is what the movie is about, not a giant green man smashing things up for ninety minutes like so many 2003 movie goers were expecting.Sadly this film didn't hit the audience it should've due to Universal's careless advertising that passed this off as a popcorn film.  If you're someone who likes emotionally compelling and ambitious tales Hulk (2003) may be the superhero film for you.  If you liked Frankenstein or any of the King Kong adaptations Hulk will probably be a movie for you, just don't go in unprepared to think about the material you're viewing.  This is one that one should defiantly pay attention to because it is probably the most underrated film of the 20th century.",5,Hulk (2003),1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,3468,"['4.5/5', 'stars', 'Hulk', '2003', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'typical', 'summer', 'creature-feature', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'appeared', 'be', 'mindless', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganza', 'little', 'plot', 'whatsoever', 'AKA', 'Summer', 'Fun', 'who', 'went', 'see', 'mindset', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'not', 'so', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Most', 'whom', 'who', 'saw', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'obviously', 'had', 'not', 'foreseen', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'philosophical', 'drama', 'instantly', 'retaliated', 'causing', 'Hulk', 'fail', 'most', 'ways.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'not', 'way', 'common', 'viewers', 'were', 'loved', 'Hulk', 'superhero', 'movie', 'other', 'comic', 'based', 'film', 'last', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'film', 'filled', 'heart', 'emotion', 'delivers', 'fully', 'ways', 'other', 'film', 'genre', 'done', 'art', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'astounding', 'bring', 'comic', 'character', 'life', 'oh', 'so', 'much', 'more.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'simply', 'David', 'Banner', 'geneticist', 'who', 'been', 'studying', 'regeneration', 'experimenting', 'various', 'animals', 'finally', 'up', 'injecting', 'Eventually', 'mustached', 'scientist', 'son', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'who', 'apparently', 'inherited', 'father', 'lab', 'created', 'gene.We', 'now', 'forward', 'several', 'years', 'Bruce', 'studying', 'exactly', 'what', 'father', 'had', 'years', 'regeneration', 'only', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'as', 'disaster', 'exposure', 'Gamma', 'Rays', 'inherited', 'gene', 'emerge', 'transforming', 'not', 'so', 'jolly', 'green', 'behemoth', 'known', 'Hulk', 'are', 'thrown', 'several', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'sequences', 'military', 'command', 'Gen.', 'Thaddeus', ""'Thunderbolt"", 'Ross', 'very', 'human', 'well-crafted', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'attempt', 'capture', 'Bruce/Hulk', 'obtain', 'gene', 'Only', 'complicating', 'Bruce', 'hectic', 'life', 'reappearance', 'crazed', 'father', 'who', 'also', 'more', 'studies', 'past', 'opposed', 'son', 'well-being', 'abuse', 'finally', 'leading', 'up', 'enormous', 'CGI', 'confrontation', 'mutated', 'father', 'son.The', 'Hulk', 'lack', 'category', 'CGI', 'times', 'quality', 'going', 'up', 'down', 'few', 'cuts', 'adrenaline', 'junkie', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'level', 'dialogue', 'drama', 'plot', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'cinematic', 'fusion', 'King', 'Kong', 'Frankenstein', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'perfectly', 'split', 'frame', 'thus', 'turning', 'film', 'living', 'comic', 'book', 'entire', 'cast', 'part', 'moving', 'plot', 'along', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'superhero', 'film', 'doorway', 'looking', 'delicacy', 'humanity', 'know', 'care', 'characters', 'can', 'certainly', 'care', 'man', 'giant', 'green', 'muscled', 'frame', 'Hulk', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'not', 'giant', 'green', 'man', 'smashing', 'things', 'up', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'so', 'many', '2003', 'movie', 'goers', 'were', 'expecting.Sadly', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'audience', 'should', ""'ve"", 'due', 'Universal', 'careless', 'advertising', 'passed', 'off', 'popcorn', 'film', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'ambitious', 'tales', 'Hulk', '2003', 'may', 'be', 'superhero', 'film', 'liked', 'Frankenstein', 'King', 'Kong', 'adaptations', 'Hulk', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'unprepared', 'think', 'material', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'one', 'one', 'should', 'defiantly', 'pay', 'attention', 'probably', 'most', 'underrated', 'film', '20th', 'century']",N/A

I was incredibly dissapointed with this one.  I almost litterally fell asleep during it.  This one did the complete opposite of the 80's marvel blunders, and that was focus too much on story.The plot of the movie is that Bruce Banner gets involved in an incident involving Gamma Radiation.  What we discovered earlier is that his father injected him with a serum that he was experimenting with when Bruce was a babe.  After the Gamma incident the serum kicks in and when Bruce gets pissed he turns into a very cartoony looking hulk.  From there the military wantshim to be stopped and his Father wants to find out how it happened.  In the end his father also mutates into a creature that can absorb the elemnts and the hulk fights the monstrosity in and overly CGI battle.Overall this movie is pretty poor.
