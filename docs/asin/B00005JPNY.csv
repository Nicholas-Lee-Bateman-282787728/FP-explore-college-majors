The cinematography is dazzling ,the story is complex yet absorbing, and finally a fantasy tale,that encourages children and adults to wake up and guard the one precious gift they have been given-their minds!!!Writer/director Chris Weitz along with his production designer Dennis Gassner have recreated Pullman's world of dogmatic institutions and the rebellious free thinking world with a hodge-podge of Edwardian and Victorian industry and architecture.This is the only place where I feel the film lacks.We never have much chance to rest and gaze upon this marvel of set design and this ""mythical world"" because the story simply runs at a breakneck pace in order to tell the story of the the ""rough-edged diamond"",12-year-old Lyra (the name of the beautiful harp whose dulcet tones could subdue angry kings in the Bible!) whose acute perspective keeps her from being swallowed alive by having her ability to think for herself destroyed.She navigates her way through this maze of oppressive authoritarianism.The fact that Nicole Kidman's character is named ""Mrs.Coulter"" got me to laughing thinking about the ultra conservative ""journalist"" Ann Coulter who seems to be the mouthpiece for modern day non-free thinking!!!( Oh, that comment will be sure to upset! OUCH!)Yes, this film is rooted in the deep allegories of questioning religious authority, but if you allow yourself a moment to put aside your bisases,no matter what they are, ""The Golden Compass"" can point you in the direction that says ""decide for yourself-question what is told to you-do not take things at face value-keep yourself YOU at all costs"".This is a lesson that this reviewer hopes all can learn from this film!Frankly, as a person who navigated my way out of years of authoritarian thinking, I welcome this book and movie with open arms.Long live the open mind with all of it's God-given possibilities (at least if you believe in God....you don't have to, ya know!)",4,"Free thinking in an oppressive regime-POINT THE WAY,COMPASS!!!",1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,2068,"['rich', 'yet', 'streamlined', 'adaptation', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'finally', 'hit', 'screen', 'boy', 'doozie', 'cinematography', 'dazzling', 'story', 'complex', 'yet', 'absorbing', 'finally', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'children', 'adults', 'wake', 'up', 'guard', 'one', 'precious', 'gift', 'have', 'been', 'given-their', 'minds', 'Writer/director', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'production', 'designer', 'Dennis', 'Gassner', 'have', 'recreated', 'Pullman', 'world', 'dogmatic', 'institutions', 'rebellious', 'free', 'thinking', 'world', 'hodge-podge', 'Edwardian', 'Victorian', 'industry', 'architecture.This', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'feel', 'film', 'lacks.We', 'never', 'have', 'much', 'chance', 'rest', 'gaze', 'marvel', 'set', 'design', 'mythical', 'world', 'story', 'simply', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'order', 'tell', 'story', 'rough-edged', 'diamond', ',12-year-old', 'Lyra', 'name', 'beautiful', 'harp', 'dulcet', 'tones', 'could', 'subdue', 'angry', 'kings', 'Bible', 'acute', 'perspective', 'being', 'swallowed', 'alive', 'having', 'ability', 'think', 'destroyed.She', 'way', 'maze', 'oppressive', 'authoritarianism.The', 'fact', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'named', 'Mrs.Coulter', 'got', 'laughing', 'thinking', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'journalist', 'Ann', 'Coulter', 'who', 'be', 'mouthpiece', 'modern', 'day', 'non-free', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'comment', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'upset', 'OUCH', 'Yes', 'film', 'rooted', 'deep', 'allegories', 'questioning', 'religious', 'authority', 'allow', 'moment', 'put', 'aside', 'bisases', 'matter', 'what', 'are', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'can', 'point', 'direction', 'decide', 'yourself-question', 'what', 'told', 'you-do', 'not', 'take', 'things', 'face', 'value-keep', 'YOU', 'costs', '.This', 'lesson', 'reviewer', 'can', 'learn', 'film', 'Frankly', 'person', 'who', 'navigated', 'way', 'years', 'authoritarian', 'thinking', 'welcome', 'book', 'movie', 'open', 'arms.Long', 'live', 'open', 'mind', 'God-given', 'possibilities', 'least', 'believe', 'God', '.you', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know']",The Golden Compass
654006,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00005JPNY,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[5, 9]","""Golden Compass"" succeeds as a fantasy film-there are plenty of amazing special effects (zeppelins,horseless carriages,the cold sterility of Bolvangar),the acting is great. Between the unintentional hilarity of ""Eragon"" and the plodding,turgid bore of ""The Seeker: The Dark is Rising"",""Golden Compass"" works as a fantasy movie. The ending is a perfect cliffhanger,whetting the viewer's appetite for more.The opening,with witch Serafina Pekkala (Bond girl Eva Green),mirrors Galadriel's opening narrative of ""Fellowship of the Ring."" Serafina discusses the mystical properties of Dust. The opening scene of Lyra frolicking with her friends recalls the carefree atmosphere of Hobbiton. It's a tribute to the earlier trilogy&it; succeeds. Lyra is a curious and rebellious girl. She's fascinated with the Northern Lights&seeing; the lands of the North.Daniel Craig is warm&paternal; as Lord Asriel,Lyra's alleged uncle&actual; father. Nicole Kidman is pitch-perfect as a '30s femme fatale as Asriel's former lover,Mrs.Coulter. She is a deeply conflicted character,torn between her loyalty to the theocratic Magisterium&her; love for her daughter Lyra.In the movie,the Magisterium remains a theocracy (it is called the Church in the books as well)It's the only children's fantasy movie that uses the term ""heresy"" instead of something watered down like ""treason."" The Magisterial building in Norroway has Eastern Orthodox icons painted on it as well as censers. Mrs. Coulter's apartment has a stained glass window depicting the expulsion from Eden. Even the evil polar bear king Ragnar has a palace that resembles a ruined cathedral. Mrs. Coulter explains the origin of Dust as coming from ""ancestors' disobedience to the Authority."" The Magisterial officials,with a menacing Derek Jacobi,a devious Simon McBurney&a; Saruman-like Christopher Lee (his few words leave one expecting a crazed consultation of a palantir) The theological issues aren't entirely swept under the rug,to director/screenwriter Chris Weitz's credit.The movie has its significant weaknesses- it feels rushed (there will be an extended edition DVD,complete with the original ending),the cultures of the gyptians&the; witches aren't elaborated on, the ice bear fight (with former Gandalf Sir Ian McKellen voicing a disgraced&exiled; ice bear king) is gruesome,and some details are completely missed. There needed to be more explanation. Underneath it all lies Philip Pullman's shallow atheistic,anti-religious philosophy,but that's not Chris Weitz's fault.There are some strengths as well-the artistry is amazing. The acting is great. Dakota Blue Richards is a natural,sympathetic child actress. She brings wide-eyed wonder&charm; to her role. She's believeable. Nicole Kidman slinks into her role as the seductive Mrs. Coulter. Daniel Craig has too few scenes as Lord Asriel. Lord Asriel's battle with the Samoyeds on an ice floe looks like it came straight out of a Bond movie (and it's not in the book). Crucial revelations in the movie- Lyra's parentage, Serafina Pekkala's former relationship with the gyptian Farder Coram (Tom Courtenay,who was once the atheistic revolutionary Pasha in ""Doctor Zhivago""),and the circumstances of Iorek Byrnison's (Ian McKellen) exile are handled better than in the book. In the book,these revelations are loooong,talky narratives. In the movie,these revelations are truly surprising. Kidman gets to have her ""Lyra,I am your mother"" moment.""Golden Compass"" is a seductive movie in its own way. It makes Pullman's atheism,anti-Catholicism&anti-religious; views appealing. The cliffhanger at the end leaves one wanting more. It's a thoughtful fantasy film unlike ""The Seeker"" and ""Eragon""-both its biggest strength and its Achilles heel,if one dares to explore further.",3,Golden Compass looking for its way,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,3772,"['Golden', 'Compass', 'fantasy', 'film-there', 'are', 'plenty', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'zeppelins', 'horseless', 'carriages', 'cold', 'sterility', 'Bolvangar', 'acting', 'great', 'unintentional', 'hilarity', 'Eragon', 'plodding', 'turgid', 'bore', 'Seeker', 'Dark', 'Rising', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'ending', 'perfect', 'cliffhanger', 'whetting', 'viewer', 'appetite', 'more.The', 'opening', 'witch', 'Serafina', 'Pekkala', 'Bond', 'girl', 'Eva', 'Green', 'mirrors', 'Galadriel', 'opening', 'narrative', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'Serafina', 'mystical', 'properties', 'Dust', 'opening', 'scene', 'Lyra', 'frolicking', 'friends', 'carefree', 'atmosphere', 'Hobbiton', 'tribute', 'earlier', 'trilogy', 'Lyra', 'curious', 'rebellious', 'girl', 'fascinated', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'seeing', 'lands', 'North.Daniel', 'Craig', 'warm', 'paternal', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Lyra', 'alleged', 'uncle', 'actual', 'father', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'pitch-perfect', ""'30s"", 'femme', 'fatale', 'Asriel', 'former', 'lover', 'Mrs.Coulter', 'deeply', 'conflicted', 'character', 'torn', 'loyalty', 'theocratic', 'Magisterium', 'love', 'daughter', 'Lyra.In', 'movie', 'Magisterium', 'theocracy', 'called', 'Church', 'books', 'well', 'only', 'children', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'term', 'heresy', 'instead', 'something', 'watered', 'down', 'treason', 'Magisterial', 'building', 'Norroway', 'Eastern', 'Orthodox', 'icons', 'painted', 'as', 'well', 'censers', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'apartment', 'stained', 'glass', 'window', 'depicting', 'expulsion', 'Eden', 'Even', 'evil', 'polar', 'bear', 'king', 'Ragnar', 'palace', 'ruined', 'cathedral', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'origin', 'Dust', 'coming', 'ancestors', 'disobedience', 'Authority', 'Magisterial', 'officials', 'menacing', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'devious', 'Simon', 'McBurney', 'Saruman-like', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'few', 'words', 'leave', 'one', 'expecting', 'crazed', 'consultation', 'palantir', 'theological', 'issues', 'are', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'swept', 'rug', 'director/screenwriter', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'credit.The', 'movie', 'significant', 'weaknesses-', 'rushed', 'will', 'be', 'extended', 'edition', 'DVD', 'complete', 'original', 'ending', 'cultures', 'gyptians', 'witches', 'are', ""n't"", 'elaborated', 'ice', 'bear', 'fight', 'former', 'Gandalf', 'Sir', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'voicing', 'disgraced', 'exiled', 'ice', 'king', 'gruesome', 'details', 'are', 'completely', 'missed', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'explanation', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'shallow', 'atheistic', 'anti-religious', 'philosophy', 'not', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'are', 'strengths', 'well-the', 'artistry', 'amazing', 'acting', 'great', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'natural', 'sympathetic', 'child', 'actress', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'charm', 'role', 'believeable', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'role', 'seductive', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'too', 'few', 'scenes', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'battle', 'Samoyeds', 'ice', 'floe', 'came', 'straight', 'Bond', 'movie', 'not', 'book', 'Crucial', 'revelations', 'movie-', 'Lyra', 'parentage', 'Serafina', 'Pekkala', 'former', 'relationship', 'gyptian', 'Farder', 'Coram', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'atheistic', 'revolutionary', 'Pasha', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'circumstances', 'Iorek', 'Byrnison', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'exile', 'are', 'handled', 'better', 'book', 'book', 'revelations', 'are', 'loooong', 'talky', 'narratives', 'movie', 'revelations', 'are', 'truly', 'surprising', 'Kidman', 'have', 'Lyra', 'am', 'mother', 'moment', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'seductive', 'movie', 'own', 'way', 'Pullman', 'atheism', 'anti-Catholicism', 'anti-religious', 'views', 'appealing', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'one', 'wanting', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Seeker', 'Eragon', 'biggest', 'strength', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'one', 'explore', 'further']",The Golden Compass

654016,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B00005JPNY,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 2]","When Harry Potter came out I ran across an internet article that described a number of children's films as more or less Harry Potter wannabes that failed to capture audience share.  The comments posted on the article suggested that a number of readers felt this was a harsh assessment, so I decided to view some of these films and read the books upon which they were based. The Golden Compass was one of those cited.The story is hardly a Harry Potter wannabe, though it probably owes a lot toThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Movie Tie-in Edition (Narnia).  While it deals with the same issues facing young people--friendship, courage, loss, development of an identity--these are all things that are part of the genre and not specific to Harry Potter.  Almost all literature is based to some degree on predecessors.  There is probably only one children's book I can think of that seems truely divorced from all other formats and that isAlice in Wonderland, thoughThrough the Looking Glass: Complete and Unabridgedmight be said to have given even that a ""copycat.""The story of The Golden Compass essentially describes what actually happens to children in society at large.  Schooling, society's priorities and stern discipline of infractions do indeed mold people to ""fit,"" whether they want to or not.  In essence children's spirits, or here their ""demons,"" are forced to conform or be lost.  The question isn't whether or not they are, but to whose agenda they are ultimately molded, and that is determined by a society almost always dominated by adults.  It comes as no surpise that it is the child's own mother who is among the forces suppressing other children and their families while protecting her own daughter and her demon from similar forces.The universal ""correctness"" of society is what the young always question, and it is usually the young and spirited that force society itself to change by degree over time.  It is for this reason that life now is so different from life in ones grandparent's generation.  The difference is easier to see when looking back three generations.  It is hardly surprising then that it is children that are perceived as ""dangerous"" by the adult powers in this story.  Adults have a heavy investment in the status quo; any changes can work to their distinct disadvantage and to that of their children.  At base, the Golden Compass might be seen as an unbiased guide to how society is ""supposed to be,"" which is why the adults want to suppress it and why only a child can ""read"" it.Although I have yet to read the book, I did watch the film.  I was a little disappointed in it.  While it certainly deals with the issues facing children, it seemed to lack charm.  I couldn't help wonder if the problem was less the children and more the adults.  A number of high profile actors played adult roles and did so superbly.  However, the quality of their acting ended up overwhelming the child roles, creating a sense that the story was more about adults and less about children and the ""magic"" of youth.  This is an odd way to convey philosophical information to adults, most of whom know it already and a disappointing way of presenting it to children.  (For myself I worried less about either and more about the animal ""demons"".)  Somehow it just didn't come together well.Perhaps the problem is that the actual goal of the film--which was probably about making money and not about messages at all--even perhaps of the book on which it was founded, was indeterminate.  Was the story about adults who feared change?  Or was it about the spirit of children and the necessity, even imperative, of change.  Maybe it was simply left to the audience to decide for themselves: sacrifice security and tradition and endure rigidity and loss of creativity, or endure anarchy and shifting fortune for the privilege of creativity and change.  In the end the film seemed ambivalent.  History tells us that time is not.  (Evolution tells us that it cannot afford to be.)The film is a nice blend of CGI characters and live action (though I couldn't help feel that the whole metaphor of the ""spirit"" of youth captured in ""demon"" animals was a little heavy handed).  I enjoyed all of the animals immensely.  The genre has come a long way sinceWho Framed Roger Rabbit (Vista Series)!  The sets and costumes were beautiful and evocative of the 1930s and that quintessential of all ridged and totalitarian regimes, the Nazis of the same period.  It was precisely this that made the decision for the viewer that change and creativity must be more valuable than stability.

Perhaps if I was under 18, it would be great. Comes close. But then I read the book first. I kept wondering how it would be if I had seen the film first, and then read the book. I think the movie would indeed stimulate me to read the book.Dakota Blue Richards is a charming young girl who plays Lyra Belacqua in a world similar to, but not quite the same, as our own.  The movie does stick close to the plot line of the book, although as always, things have to change to accommodate the different medium.As everyone knows by now, Nicole Kidman plays Mrs. Coulter, who seems ever so beautiful and sweet and fake. She's mysterious in that she says all these nice things about the Magisterium, while the rest of us can tell early on that they are a bunch of power-mad pompous asses. It's clear they represent the Established Church in this world.This world is different from ours in several ways, but the most significant one is that people's souls are not inside them, but outside in the form of animals. They are called daemons. A child's daemon changes shape pretty much at will, but an adult's settles into a single form. You can tell a lot about a person by the nature of their daemon. Mrs. Coulter's is a nasty-tempered golden monkey. Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), who starts the movie by making it clear that the Magisterium and he hate each other, has a leopard. The other thing you should know is that, with rare exceptions, the daemon is of the opposite gender from the human.Think about that one for awhile. Carl Jung would understand.It's all very confusing, but I suspect twice as confusing if you've never read the book. The special effects are quite believable, and add a visual dimension to what I read. The spy flies are especially interesting; keep your eye on them.I enjoyed it, but I'm not as crazy about the movie as I was of the book.

An excellent liar who saves her from many situations, she may someday find her assets are liabilities. A chance visit by her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), will change her life for ever.Well movies can not be the book and many times for brevity speeches are cut and locations are rearranged (from a 400 page book to a 110 page script.) But you have to draw the line some where. Unfortunately this is one of those times where they left the action in and changed the story form a multifaceted mystery to a black and white good guy vs. bad guy. We may as well have been watching Saturday afternoon cowboys with black and white hats. Some of the facets were skillfully woven into the non-verbal part of the film with the hope that you read the book and know what is happening. Still the focus switched from a coming of age story to free the slaves and what not. And what is with introducing a bad guy from the next installment to an earlier scene at Jordan collage that masking the turmoil of conciseness at the college?I do agree that the movie needed to stop short of the cliffhanger end of the book. Let us see what happens when Lyra brings her father what he needs.On the plus side, the costumes and props were excellent. The CGI did not overwhelm the story. Daemons knew their place. The music matched the scenes and did not overwhelm the dialog. They did a great job of choosing the actors. We can hope they will be around for ""The Subtle Knife"" (2009).""

654023,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPNY,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 7]","I had high hopes for THE GOLDEN COMPASS. The cast. The special effects. The story. It promised to be a dazzling cinematic experience. But the dazzle fell into Dudsville as Philip Pullman's magical novel got off to horrible start.Before I get started, however, I think it's noteworthy to mention how ridiculous I found the claims surrounding the persecution of Christianity and The Church with regards to this film. You might be able to draw parallels between atheism and some of what was seen. But it could also represent Nazism. I know that Pullman WAS an atheist, but to say his books (and this film) represented that view is simply untrue. With the release ofThe Chronicles of Narnia, Christianity has nothing to fear. Which is also why this review is tough for me.I don't prescribe to any particular faith (you might even call me *gasp!* an atheist), but I don't go to movies in order to reinforce my beliefs. I go to be entertained. And, as I've said many times before, entertainment starts with a good (or great) script. And The Golden Compass' start was exceptionally unimpressive.Jumping around like a child with A-D-D, The Golden Compass lacked perspective and a unified focus. The story is SUPPOSED to focus on Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl who's parentage is in question on a parallel world where ""beasts"" (see Animals) are part of ones being. They tag along beside you and are basically your soul (Oh my God! Christians Unite! *Whoops! There I go!*) Each person has a different animal/beast and young people's animals can change from one to another until they settle on a shape as they approach adulthood. Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig,Casino Royale) is a scientist who goes against the grain of this parallel world and its leaders. He's found that ""dust"" from other worlds is flowing into theirs and he wants to discover what this dust is all about. But the powers that be want to stop him.Enter Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman,Happy Feet), a dangerous player within a government that seeks to control everything, including Lyra. Marisa fraudulently befriends Lyra and takes her on a trip North, but not before Lyra receives a magical golden compass from a high councilor at the school where her uncle worked. The compass, it is said, is the last of its kind and can tell the truth and possibly the future.Encounters with giant polar bears, flights in massive zeppelins, child prisons in the far-north, all culminate to form ... a disaster. And I don't mean a disaster for Lyra, but a disaster for the movie-watcher.The canvas is simply too broad to be a coherent whole. Multiple side stories are mentioned and then never seen again or quickly wrapped up with little-to-no understanding. The script obviously was very choppy; perhapsAmerican Piedirector Chris Weitz wasn't the best person to write it?The only upside to the film is the incredible special effects. Most of the scenes were pure ga-ga for the eyes. Which means that The Golden Compass is more fluff than substance. By contrast, The Chronicles of Narnia was exceptionally well put together with a few duds in the special effects arena.

Erland,"[18, 24]","Not knowing anything about `The Golden Compass' nor the book `Northern Lights' by Philip Pullman upon which this film is based, I must say I was not only pleasantly surprised, but amazed by what I saw and heard on my initial viewing. The visuals are astounding and the storyline is original, highly controversial (at least in the mind of some religious groups) and abnormally complex.Maybe even more amazing to me than how good this film is, was the high volume of criticism and low ratings it has compiled from Amazon reviewers. I can discern only three possible reasons for this unlikely occurrence;1- It's to be expected if the film diverges from the book, something purist cannot tolerant. (Again, not having read the book in question I cannot comment on its faithfulness to the source material).2- It might be a case of not appreciating the complexity of the story. You can't just jump into this film and immediately know what's going on. You have to exert a little effort and brain power to work your way into this alternate universe before settling down for the ride.3- However I'm certain that the biggest body of complaints come from Christian factions that don't like their belief system challenged in any form. The portrayal of an evil ruling body known as the Magisterium may hit a little too close to home for some Catholics and those within the Protestant camp will most certainly be bothered by seeing every human accompanied by what appears to be an animal familiar referred to as a daemon* (no it's not a demon, think of the Hellenistic concept of the daemonic).*These animals are part of the individual. In this imaginary world the soul is separated from the body and exists as a companion creature that accompanies the individual throughout life.If that wasn't enough to cause some of the faithful to begin beating their war drums and rattling their sabres it doesn't help to see a heroine who's furry companion is named Pan (short for Pantalaimon), an alluring Queen of the Witches with the angelic sounding name Serafina (i.e.: Seraphim) who fights with the ""good guys"", and the heroine's courageous Uncle, Lord Asriel who's name is all too similar to that of the fallen angel Azriel, long  associated with the Devil.These religious/mythological cross-references don't stop here. I noticed a couple borrowed from Norse mythology as well. There's Lorek Byrnison ( possibly referring to Loki, the trickster God) and the immense warrior, polar bear Ragnar Sturlusson could be a subtle reference to Ragnarok, the Nordic version of the Apocalypse.Of course there's always the possibility that someone simply doesn't like the film for reasons I've yet to comprehend, but I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy such an imaginative, allegorical, fantasy adventure.

654027,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPNY,Caleb Williams,"[2, 2]","As I am sure many people, I am not a part of the breed of fans that have read the book and then hastily decided to check out the film. In fact, until this film arose, I had never heard of anything-called ""The Golden Compass"" so it is quite an interesting film. After all a film that stars both Daniel Craig and the wonderful Nicole Kidman, regardless of whether I've read the book or not I was going to see this film.I have to be perfectly honest and tell you that although it was a good bit of fun with a very out there premise. Set in an alternate universe where, rather than a persons soul being encapsulated within their body it manifests itself as an animal form outside the body known as Daemons. The main character Lyra is fascinated by a presentation she accidentally stumbles upon by her uncle Asriel about mysterious particles known as Dust, which is apparently a way of transporting between universes.Her uncle is due to travel North in search of these particles, but holding no hope of going with him, she is asked to travel north with a very mysterious woman known only as Mrs. Coulter as her personal assistant. During that time, she comes into possession of the mysterious Golden Compass, which allows her to see all truths along with her companions also such as her Daemon and a large ferocious polar bear.Even before its release, thanks to the oppressive Magisterium in the film. The Golden Compass brought in unwanted controversy as it was believed that the Magisterium was a religious undertone relating to the Catholic Church. I suppose really that unless your child is extremely intelligent, that controversy and ""message"" means pretty much nothing to them.Due to it being a high budget fantasy film it required a lot of CGI and let me be honest and say, sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not. In one of the ways it did not, work was the attempting interaction between the actors and their chosen daemon. It was especially apparent when Kidman's character hit her daemon and then attempted to apologise by hugging it. The mix between reality and CGI did work, but the faults were noticeable, but it is passable due to what it did achieve. The fight scene between a King bear and Lyras polar bear companion was also another way in which the CGI worked very well. The look of the bears was spot on and quite realistic at some points the fighting was intense and very attractive.One of the best parts of the whole thing was the superbly frightening acting by Nicole Kidman. Her role as Mrs. Couter was something to be experienced and she really plays the role of a manipulative evil ""ice queen"" of sorts very well. Daniel Craig, although not a particularly prominent role, still managed to make the movie special and hold my interest. After all, I could not expect anything less as he is one of the reasons I decided to watch this in the first place.It was a wonderful fantasy film and about the only thing I have negative to say about it is in relation to the Daemons. From what I saw there seemed to be no explanation as to why the Daemons took the shape they did. Lyra's Daemon was that of a cat most of the time but took different shapes from time to time. Mrs. Couters Daemon was that of a golden monkey and Uncle Asriels was a tiger.Other than that little discrepancy, there is honestly nothing to complain about with this picture.",4,Wonderful,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,3362,"['am', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'am', 'not', 'part', 'breed', 'fans', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'hastily', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'fact', 'film', 'arose', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'anything-called', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'quite', 'interesting', 'film', 'film', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'wonderful', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'regardless', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'not', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'film.I', 'have', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'tell', 'was', 'good', 'bit', 'fun', 'very', 'there', 'premise', 'Set', 'alternate', 'universe', 'where', 'rather', 'persons', 'soul', 'being', 'encapsulated', 'body', 'animal', 'form', 'body', 'known', 'Daemons', 'main', 'character', 'Lyra', 'fascinated', 'presentation', 'accidentally', 'uncle', 'Asriel', 'mysterious', 'particles', 'known', 'Dust', 'apparently', 'way', 'transporting', 'universes.Her', 'uncle', 'due', 'travel', 'North', 'search', 'particles', 'holding', 'hope', 'going', 'asked', 'travel', 'north', 'very', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'known', 'only', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'personal', 'assistant', 'time', 'possession', 'mysterious', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'see', 'truths', 'companions', 'also', 'such', 'Daemon', 'large', 'ferocious', 'polar', 'bear.Even', 'release', 'thanks', 'oppressive', 'Magisterium', 'film', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'brought', 'unwanted', 'controversy', 'was', 'believed', 'Magisterium', 'was', 'religious', 'undertone', 'relating', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'suppose', 'really', 'child', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'controversy', 'message', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'them.Due', 'being', 'high', 'budget', 'fantasy', 'film', 'required', 'lot', 'CGI', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'sometimes', 'worked', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'ways', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'was', 'attempting', 'interaction', 'actors', 'chosen', 'daemon', 'was', 'especially', 'apparent', 'when', 'Kidman', 'character', 'hit', 'daemon', 'then', 'attempted', 'apologise', 'hugging', 'mix', 'reality', 'CGI', 'did', 'work', 'faults', 'were', 'noticeable', 'passable', 'due', 'what', 'did', 'achieve', 'fight', 'scene', 'King', 'bear', 'Lyras', 'polar', 'bear', 'companion', 'was', 'also', 'way', 'CGI', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'look', 'bears', 'was', 'spot', 'quite', 'realistic', 'points', 'fighting', 'was', 'intense', 'very', 'attractive.One', 'best', 'parts', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'superbly', 'frightening', 'acting', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Couter', 'was', 'something', 'be', 'experienced', 'really', 'role', 'manipulative', 'evil', 'ice', 'queen', 'sorts', 'very', 'well', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'not', 'particularly', 'prominent', 'role', 'still', 'managed', 'make', 'movie', 'special', 'hold', 'interest', 'could', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'one', 'reasons', 'decided', 'watch', 'first', 'place.It', 'was', 'wonderful', 'fantasy', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'negative', 'say', 'relation', 'Daemons', 'what', 'saw', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'explanation', 'why', 'Daemons', 'took', 'shape', 'did', 'Lyra', 'Daemon', 'was', 'cat', 'most', 'time', 'took', 'different', 'shapes', 'time', 'time', 'Mrs.', 'Couters', 'Daemon', 'was', 'golden', 'monkey', 'Uncle', 'Asriels', 'was', 'tiger.Other', 'little', 'discrepancy', 'honestly', 'nothing', 'complain', 'picture']",The Golden Compass
654028,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B00005JPNY,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[1, 3]","The movie is just good entertainment like ""Narnia"", ""Star Wars"", or ""The Lord of the Rings"". It has absolutely nothing to do with religion unless you consider people fighting for free will anti-religious, you belong to a meglo-maniac religion that likes to brainwash children, or you are a fan of the Spanish Inquisition. I suppose you could say a small part is religious since in their world their souls live in an animal known as a Daemon that keeps them company all their life. If either the animal or they are badly injured they both die and you see their dust disappear. But that is the only thing you can remotely say ties to religion. The rest the movie is about the adventure of a young girl and her daemon trying to get a golden compass to her father. Along the way they are hampered by a woman (rich and stylish Nicole Kidman) and her daemon (orange monkey with bad attitude) secretly working for the government, but Lyra is helped by her own daemon (switches between bird, feret, and cat), a group of people called Gyptians (Gypsies in steamships), a warrior polar bear (prince that should have been king but he lost a fight), a cowboy aeronaut (white haired and haggerd Sam Elliot that flies a balloon) and his daemon jack rabbit, and bow toting flying witches. The compass is a threat to the GOVERNMENT (Magesterium), not the CHURCH, since it tells the truth. The government is trying to suppress the truth since it has it's own spin on what it wants the truth to be. They have even gone to the extent of kidnapping children to brainwash them from childhood and separate them from their daemon. The ending is left up in the air like many trilogies. They talk of a war coming and Lyra's importance in the scheme of things at the end which sort of reminded me of the ""Empire Strikes Back"" ending. So even though there is some scary stuff, it is in fact something like a childrens fairy tale.

The brightest spots in her life are the occasional visits of her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), a noted explorer, whose life she saves when the college's senior faculty set him up to be poisoned.  She hopes that this action will inspire him to take her along on his next expedition, but this he refuses to do.  Sullen and disappointed, she's easy prey for the glamorous Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who invites her to become a sort of apprentice and assistant but turns out to have an agenda of her own, which includes acquiring the alethiometer (the ""golden compass"" of the title) that Lyra has inexplixcably been given by one of the professors.  Delivered from sinister kidnappers by a band of ""gyptians"" (apparently her world's analogue of gypsies), Lyra finds herself going north after all, and turning out to be an indispensable linchpin in the search for many missing children (gyptian and otherwise), with allies who are an odd assortment of human (Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, an aeronaut whose natal Texas seems to have retained her independence in this reality), sentient animal (Ian McKellan as Iorek Byrnison, the exiled heir to the kingship of the giant ice-bears), and possibly slightly miraculous (Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala, a leader of the airborne, bow-wielding witches).  Full of twists, turns, and unexpected revelations, the script closely follows the original bookThe Golden Compass, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 1)(Rough-cut), though you should read the latter for a better picture of Lyra's society, and is full of splendid special effects, suspense, and adventure, capped by a ferocious battle between Iorek and the usurping Ragnar Sturlusson (Ian McShane) and a wild confrontation (in Arctic night) between the gyptians and the witches on one side and the kidnappers and their Tartar allies on the other.

654041,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPNY,Chris Pandolfi,"[182, 236]","The special effects and the cinematography of ""The Golden Compass"" are wonderful, but it's the subtext that really shines through, making for one of the most unique, fascinating, and entertaining fantasy films of recent memory. Just as it is in the film, the plot of Philip Pullman's original novel suggested that free will was kept under strict control. The film brings this idea to the surface and allows the audience to analyze it; in a parallel universe--in which a person's soul is separate and physically represented by an animal--a ruthless organization called the Magisterium tries to enforce rules against free will. Anyone who challenges its authority will be condemned as a heretic. Because they wanted to ensure total compliance, the Magisterium sought to destroy every last alethiometer, or golden compass--a magical, watch-like mechanism that literally tells the truth by pointing at strange symbols.The one alethiometer that survived is now in the possession of Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), a college professor who defies the Magisterium by confirming the existence of dust. I'm not referring to the allergy-inducing particles that settle on ordinary surfaces; I'm referring to the magical substance that's somehow related to a rift between their universe and ours. Because this has put him at odds with the Magisterium, he gives the alethiometer to his orphaned niece, Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl raised by the professors at a university. Lyra, who absolutely hates being called a lady, is clever, bold, and incredibly headstrong, with an adventurous spirit that occasionally gets her into trouble. Her spirit--or daemon, as referred to by the characters--is Pan (voiced by Freddie Highmore), who hasn't quite decided which animal form to take. He spends most of his time as a ferret, but he also turns into a cat, a bird, and a mouse.When Lyra hears that her uncle is traveling to the snowy north to find the dust and open this cross-dimensional rift, she wishes to join him. Asriel refuses to let her, and he warns her against speaking of dust to anyone. Here enters Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), the wicked, controlling head of the Magisterium; she quickly learns that the alethiometer is in Lyra's possession and vows to reclaim it by tricking Lyra onto her good side. Mrs. Coulter's true nature is soon revealed, and upon escaping, Lyra is put under the protection of the Gyptians, a band of rebels who were once aided by Lord Asriel. As they journey north with Lyra, she also meets: Serafina (Eva Green), an elegant, almost ethereal witch; Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott), a grizzled pilot who speaks like a Texan from the Old West; and Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen), a disgraced polar bear who was once a great warrior among an entire clan of polar bears. To rid himself of his shame, he decides to reclaim his stolen armor and protect Lyra at whatever cost.This is pretty much the foundation for the adventure that follows, an adventure so big that it isn't over even when the movie ends. But in the grand scheme of things, the adventure is fairly superficial and only part of what makes it so wonderful; ""The Golden Compass"" is just as thought provoking as it is enjoyable, filled to the brim with intelligent, meaningful undertones. This isn't to say that the film exists entirely as one big commentary--a good portion of it functions at a level of pure entertainment, from the convincing special effects to the stunning set designs to the fantastic mechanical creations. The story is not one of the future, the past, or even the present; its unique setting has essentially made any sense of time meaningless. And let's not forget a number of lighthearted moments between Lyra and her best friend, Roger (Ben Walker), both of whom are more like bonded siblings.But there is a dark side to this story. For one thing, the Magisterium is involved in a sinister plot to kidnap children and sever the connections between them and their daemons. The sooner they lose their spirits (pun definitely intended), the quicker they can be controlled. There's also a general sense of foreboding that runs through the entire film, as if to say that certain things are not as simple as they may first appear. Consider the fact that a person's physical pain is also felt by his or her daemon, and vice versa: What exactly will happen if one of them dies? Can one exist without the other? And how exactly are daemons a threat to free will?The fact that I'm asking these questions is a good thing, because it proves that ""The Golden Compass"" is a stimulating film. Rarely is a fantasy story allowed to transcend the limiting clich&eacute;s of princesses, castles, dragons, swords, and predictable Hero's Journeys. Here's a film that actually brings something new to the genre, something fresh, exciting, daring, and determined. This is not a mind-numbing rehash; it's a thoroughly original experience, highlighted by delightful performances, a solid structure, and a well-rounded social commentary. I suppose I should make a note about the Catholic Church's poor reception of this film, but why bother? Religion--or lack thereof--has nothing to do with it. It has everything to do with being engaging, smart, and imaginative.",5,The Fight for Free Will,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,5250,"['special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'are',

654048,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B00005JPNY,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[4, 5]","WARNING: This review may contain spoilers!I suppose it's not surprising, what with the current trend of adapting fantasy literature into films, that Philip Pullman's novelThe Golden Compassshould become a major motion picture. What is surprising is who ended up writing the screenplay and directing the film. Chris Weitz, best known as one of the producers of theAmerican Piefilms, seems an odd choice to adapt the epic fantasy story for the silver screen and yet his commercial success gave New Line Cinema the courage to greenlight the project.Adapting Philip Pullman's novel proved to be a daunting task and though much of the more controversial subject matter within the plot has been omitted, the film is fairly faithful to the conceit of the book. But the film suffers from a lack of thematic depth, which can be attributed to the removal of the book's religious and political commentary.It should also be noted that the film ends in an abrupt and emotionally unsatisfying manner. Apparently this is because the studio was not confident that the film would be successful and they didn't wish to end the film with a cliffhanger.The story, which is set in a universe parallel to our own where people's souls take on the physical form of animals called dmons, follows a feisty and rebellious young girl named Lyra Belacqua, an orphan who lives at Jordon College in England. After a series of widespread kidnappings Lyra half-jokingly promises to rescue her best friend Roger if he is ever kidnapped. Little does she suspect that such a thing will actually happen.When Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel, makes a visit to the college to announce a startling discovery in the Far North, Lyra has no idea of the far-reaching implications. Lord Asriel has discovered a connection between the mystical substance Dust and the divisions that separate parallel worlds. This controversial revelation places both he and Lyra under the watchful eye of the Magisterium, a vast totalitarian government, which uses religion to subjugate the masses. But all is changed when the beautiful and authoritative Mrs. Coulter invites Lyra to join her at her home and then journey with her to the Far North.Before her departure, Lyra is given a tremendous gift from the Master of the College, who bestows unto her an alethiometer (or Golden Compass). The alethiometer has the power to tell the truth to anyone who can read its symbols.At first Lyra relishes the attention and the luxuries that Mrs. Coulter showers upon her, but then Lyra begins to see a controlling, manipulative side to her new guardian. One night Lyra and her dmon Pan come across a list of children's names and to her shock, she finds Roger's name is on the list. She then realizes that Mrs. Coulter is behind the kidnappings. Lyra runs away, but she is pursued by sinister agents. Luckily she is rescued by Gyptians, a nomadic people, who are seeking revenge on the Magisterium.Learning to read the alethiometer, Lyra soon realizes that a great destiny is set upon her. She meets and befriends an Armoured Bear named Iorek Byrnison, a beautiful witch named Serafina Pekkala, and an aeronaut named Lee Scoresby. Lyra continues her travels north, and along with her new allies, overcomes many perils including savage Armoured Bears, and soldiers.Yet nothing can prepare Lyra for what she finds in the Far North. There she learns what became of the kidnapped children and the horrible truth about Mrs. Coulter. In the end Lyra and her companions must face the power of the Magisterium, and either succeed in freeing their world and all others from its tyrannical grasp or die trying.The film features a spectacular cast including Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter, Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, and Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala. The film also features Christopher Lee, Derek Jacobi, and the voices of Ian McKellen, Freddie Highmore, and Kathy Bates. The entire cast is superb especially the young Dakota Blue Richards, whose portrayal of plucky heroine Lyra has unfairly been overlooked by most critics.The Golden Compass, which is the first part in a trilogy, failed to become a hit in the U.S., so it's questionable whether or not the next two books in the series shall ever be adapted into films. Sadly, this means that the adventures of Lyra (at least cinematically) are left without an ending. This certainly detracts from the enjoyment of watching the film, but perhaps there is still hope that the next two books will be given a cinematic treatment and thus provide viewers with a sense of closure.It's unfortunate that the film was a Box office disappointment and that we may never find out how Lyra's adventures come to their end, but there are reasons for the film's poor reception from audiences. One of those reasons is New Line's overly ambitious and foolhardy marketing strategy. In the very first trailer they dared to make a comparison between this film and the belovedThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This in itself was like committing Box Office suicide. Another reason for the film's failure to attract large audiences is the controversial thematic materials of the books. A major theme of Philip Pullman's books is that of rebelling against authority and religious dogma. Cleverly (and some would say subversively) exploiting taboos within Judaeo-Christian beliefs, Pullman weaves a tale of redemption, not through a higher power but through the power of the self. As a result the Catholic Church boycotted the film, deeming it heretical in its content.Overall, The Golden Compass is an admirable yet deeply flawed epic. Though it features a strong cast and gorgeous visual effects, these can also be found in theHarry PotterandThe Chronicles of Narniaseries. What really hurts the film is the inexperience of its writer/director and the lack of faith that the studio placed in him. It's ironic, but ultimately the film about a Golden Compass finds itself lost.Also recommended:His Dark Materials Trilogyby Philip PullmanHarry Potter: Books 1-7by J.K.

The story is compressed to the point of ridiculousness and, much as the fans of the book would have hated a more ruthless abridgement, it would have been better to have lost /sections/ of the story rather than to try to cram them all into a 2 hour playing time as the director, scriptwriter and editor have done here.

What alarms me most is that secular newspapers are printing articles asking people not to watch this movie on religious grounds! I find that quite astonishing! I'm sure there are numerous religious groups that would like the public not to watch, or read, something because it's against their beliefs. What I'd like to find out is why these outrageous attacks on The Golden Compass are being printed as hard news, instead of being delegated to the editorial page where it's appropriate to express one's beliefs!And I'd also love to know what public relations firms these Catholic organizations were using because it appears to be an extremely well-orchestrated effort!The Dark Materials trilogy is some of the most profound pieces of literature I have had the good fortune to read in my entire life! It's on par with the Lord of the Rings as far as emotional depth is concerned. While the movie can never capture the endless rich nuances of the book - it was a good try.I enjoyed all three books in the trilogy, but The Golden Compass is just a warm-up for the next two books, which will knock your socks off. The theology and imagination that runs through this trilogy is absolutely subversive and incredibly moving. It will drive conservatives crazy because it attacks religious authoritarianism with such mind-boggling intensity. Something truly unparalleled in modern fantasy literature.My concern while driving home after watching this movie is simply this - will the next two sequels be neutered by Hollywood because it will drive conservatives within the Catholic church bonkers? I hope the author, Philip Pullman, makes sure this does not happen. I would rather see this be the first, and last, Dark Materials trilogy film if some weenies up in Hollywood Central intends to sterilize the remaining story by ripping out its heart and soul!See:Sin and Censorship: The Catholic Church and the Motion Picture IndustryandThe Catholic Crusade Against the Movies, 1940-1975",5,A Film That Was Under Attack By Reactionary Elements Within The Catholic Church!,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,2133,"['had', 'seen', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'articles', 'MAJOR', 'newspapers', 'attacking', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'reactionary', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'organizations', 'was', 'even', 'released', 'What', 'most', 'secular', 'newspapers', 'are', 'printing', 'articles', 'asking', 'people', 'not', 'watch', 'movie', 'religious', 'grounds', 'find', 'quite', 'astonishing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'numerous', 'religious', 'groups', 'would', 'like', 'public', 'not', 'watch', 'read', 'something', 'beliefs', 'What', ""'d"", 'like', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'outrageous', 'attacks', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'are', 'being', 'printed', 'hard', 'news', 'instead', 'being', 'delegated', 'editorial', 'page', 'where', 'appropriate', 'express', 'one', 'beliefs', ""'d"", 'also', 'love', 'know', 'what', 'public', 'relations', 'firms', 'Catholic', 'organizations', 'were', 'using', 'be', 'extremely', 'well-orchestrated', 'effort', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'trilogy', 'most', 'profound', 'pieces', 'literature', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'read', 'entire', 'life', 'par', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'as', 'far', 'emotional', 'depth', 'concerned', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'capture', 'endless', 'rich', 'nuances', 'book', 'was', 'good', 'try.I', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'books', 'trilogy', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'just', 'warm-up', 'next', 'two', 'books', 'will', 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'theology', 'imagination', 'trilogy', 'absolutely', 'subversive', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'will', 'drive', 'conservatives', 'crazy', 'religious', 'authoritarianism', 'such', 'mind-boggling', 'intensity', 'Something', 'truly', 'unparalleled', 'modern', 'fantasy', 'literature.My', 'concern', 'driving', 'home', 'watching', 'movie', 'simply', 'will', 'next', 'two', 'sequels', 'be', 'neutered', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'drive', 'conservatives', 'Catholic', 'church', 'bonkers', 'hope', 'author', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'sure', 'not', 'happen', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'be', 'first', 'last', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'trilogy', 'film', 'weenies', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'Central', 'sterilize', 'remaining', 'story', 'ripping', 'out', 'heart', 'soul', 'See', 'Sin', 'Censorship', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'IndustryandThe', 'Catholic', 'Crusade', 'Against', 'Movies', '1940-1975']",The Golden Compass

654055,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B00005JPNY,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[12, 34]","Philip Pullman's stated plan is to ""undermine the basis"" of Christianity. ""The Golden Compass,"" the movie version of part one of Pullman's trilogy of novels, is an inept and chaotic film whose flimsy philosophical underpinnings are nothing more than a self-deluding narcissism that could only appeal to a sophomoric consciousness.As bad as it is, ""The Golden Compass"" deserves at least two stars. Nicole Kidman -- the swanky, evil Mrs. Coulter -- reveals yet again that her gifts, in addition to flawless beauty, include acting finesse and fierce craft. Daniel Craig (Lord Asriel) is one of the sexiest men alive; it is criminal that ""The Golden Compass"" uses him for only about ten minutes. Given how little Craig is onscreen, he really should be listed as a cameo, rather than as a featured player. The suggestion of a relationship between masterful, macho, Asriel and tragic ice queen Coulter is delicious; Kidman and Craig's pairing in just these roles would ignite the screen. But they share no screentime.The special effects are very pretty to look upon, indeed.As a movie, though, ""Golden Compass"" is all computer generated gimmickry, geegaws and gimcracks. If watching a computer generated bear talk with Ian McKellan's voice makes your day, ""The Golden Compass"" is for you.Me? I felt like I was lost in a shopping mall overstuffed with cheap, lead-impregnated, Chinese import toys during holiday rush hour. For fantasy to work, the fantasy world has to have internal logic and address deep truths. Viewers who have never traveled to Oz all know, within minutes of first watching the ""The Wizard of Oz"", that Dorothy needs to cling to the Ruby Slippers, and that the Wicked Witch covets them. ""There's no place like home"" resonates for us all. There is no similar internal logic or truth in ""The Golden Compass.""Characters lack depth and arrive merely to fill some gapping hole in what passes for a plot. When the heroine, Lycra, is lost in the Arctic, a Texas cowboy on a dirigible shows up to rescue her. Sure, why not? It may as well have been Amelia Earhart. Some will find this disregard of coherence charming; I found it to be the most shameless deus ex machina. Ironic that Pullman wants to kill God; this cinematic ""Compass"" can't function without resort to a god from the machine.Much has been made of the fact that the main character is a heroine. We are supposed to celebrate Pullman's feminism. Hogwash. Lycra is as pretty as Botticelli's Venus and she's, for the most part, as passive as a 1950s Disney cartoon princess. A talking bear rescues her, a cowboy rescues her, a sky-ful of CGI witches rescues her, even the evil villainess, Mrs. Coulter, rescues her. If Lycra shows creativity, courage, or spunk, never mind a convincing adolescent girl's character, it must have been while I was dozing off. And Mrs. Coulter's purely feminine evil is misogyny at its ugliest.For a story that wants to be revolutionary, ""The Golden Compass"" is entirely retro. The fantasy world is, of course, England, just as it is in ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Narnia"" and ""Harry Potter."" Nobody writes blockbuster fantasy novels about Yiddish-speaking characters; no one has yet given us a blockbuster fantasy world set in New Jersey. That would be too real, too gritty, too working class. And fantasy England is not today's England, of course, a multicultural land of active trade unions. This is Victorian England, when the sun never set on Pullman's ancestors' empire and the lower classes knew their place. Servants, in Pullman's world, are accompanied by docile and loyal doggy daemons. In short, meet the new boss, same as the old misogynist, classist, imperialist boss.The musical score kept trying to do what the story could not, standing there, hands on hips, shouting, ""You should care about this scene! It's very climactic!""And I kept wanting to shout back, ""Blast, it's the movie's job to construct a story that makes me feel like the battle is climactic, even if it is filmed silently, as Kurosawa did it! Lay off with the endless crescendos, already!""The bad guys are priests who inhabit a rectangular version of Vatican City, ""The Magisterium."" ""Magisterium"" is, of course, the Latin word for the teaching authority of the Catholic Church. Christianity kidnaps and tortures little children, lies about ""dust"" (had to keep from sniggering during the ""dust"" scenes) and is responsible for all evil in the world. In short, ""The Golden Compass"" is to Christianity what ""Birth of a Nation"" is to African Americans or ""The Eternal Jew"" is to persons of the Jewish faith.Outside the evil Magisterium, everyone is good and kind and noble and peaceful. So, they have to eliminate persons of faith in order to make the world a better place.Atheists tried to do just that during the last century, in the Soviet Empire, in Mao's China and in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. Any knowledge of consensus reality renders ""The Golden Compass"" less a charming children's tale and more what it actually is -- propaganda. And that makes the film sound more exciting than it is.",2,Inept Propaganda; Kidman is Excellent,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,5072,"['Philip', 'Pullman', 'stated', 'plan', 'undermine', 'basis',

654056,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B00005JPNY,D. A. Reed,"[5, 6]","Before I start this review, I would like to comment on the ""religious"" factors of this film. I am a Catholic and loved this! There was nothing atheist about it. The way I viewed the Magisterium was a Communist government. Even if it was a jab at the church, it was probably referencing back to old times when the people of the church did want to control everything (Uber-Christians should really learn their history). And, judging by how some people reacted to these ""atheist"" tones, they must be working for the Magisterium, trying to say what's best for others when they should just mind their own business and let people decide for themselves.Now to the movie. Dakota Blue Richards is a very good actress and one of the very few child actors who aren't annoying. She seems undaunted for her first film and I really hope they film the next two installments as I would like to see her improve and hone her talent. Daniel Craig, Eva Green (reuniting from Casino Royale but have no scenes together), Sam Elliot and Nicole Kidman (can't believe I'm saying something good about her) are all excellent in their supporting roles. Though I will admit that Craig floats in and out of the picture like that Prudence character from Across the Universe (though not as much as her, at least Craig's character is important to the plot) and Kidman's revelation that she is Richards' mother seems a little out of left field though Mrs. Coulter could be lying. Christopher Lee has very good billing in the end credits for having one line of dialog in a very small scene. I wish the explanation of dust had gone into a little more detail instead of the Magesterium just talking about it like its a drug or whatever. Action scenes are spectacular, especially the final battle in the north. Music is also very good and, if they ever film the next two, I certainly hope they use the same composer. A fine film that I hope to be the next successful book-to-film translation like Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/James Bond.",4,Good But Feels A Little Uneven,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,2001,"['start', 'review', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'religious', 'factors', 'film', 'am', 'Catholic', 'loved', 'was', 'nothing', 'atheist', 'way', 'viewed', 'Magisterium', 'was', 'Communist', 'government', 'Even', 'was', 'jab', 'church', 'was', 'probably', 'referencing', 'back', 'old', 'times', 'when', 'people', 'church', 'did', 'want', 'control', 'everything', 'Uber-Christians', 'should', 'really', 'learn', 'history', 'judging', 'how', 'people', 'reacted', 'atheist', 'tones', 'must', 'be', 'working', 'Magisterium', 'trying', 'say', 'what', 'best', 'others', 'when', 'should', 'just', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'let', 'people', 'decide', 'themselves.Now', 'movie', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'undaunted', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'hope', 'film', 'next', 'two', 'installments', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'improve', 'hone', 'talent', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Eva', 'Green', 'reuniting', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'have', 'scenes', 'together', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'something', 'good', 'are', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'will', 'admit', 'Craig', 'floats', 'picture', 'Prudence', 'character', 'Universe', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'least', 'Craig', 'character', 'important', 'plot', 'Kidman', 'revelation', 'Richards', 'mother', 'little', 'left', 'field', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'could', 'be', 'lying', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'very', 'good', 'billing', 'end', 'having', 'one', 'line', 'dialog', 'very', 'small', 'scene', 'wish', 'explanation', 'dust', 'had', 'gone', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'instead', 'Magesterium', 'just', 'talking', 'drug', 'Action', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'final', 'battle', 'north', 'Music', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'ever', 'film', 'next', 'two', 'certainly', 'hope', 'use', 'same', 'composer', 'fine', 'film', 'hope', 'be', 'next', 'successful', 'book-to-film', 'translation', 'Lord', 'Rings/Harry', 'Potter/James', 'Bond']",The Golden Compass

654061,AVPM4HFPBHGFK,B00005JPNY,Deborah P,"[0, 5]","This movie (and I assume the book) started out with what could have been a great premise. People in a parallel universe live with their souls outside their bodies.The special effects in the movie made the scenes wonderful to watch. However, I didn't go to the theater in order to go to a kind of moving picture art museum; I went to see a movie. And a movie requires enough character development for me to care whether or not the heroine lives or dies or the person she's trying to save lives or dies. Consequently, there's no comparison between this and Lord of the Rings. None at all.People who read the book already might have had the character development in their heads. And if so, maybe that's how someone could give this thing three stars.So what's even worse than the lack of character development (and therefore lack of a story worth caring about) is that the movie didn't even get close to resolving like Lord of the Rings did at the end each segment. And you can't call the end of the movie a cliff hanger because....you don't care what happens to the characters next.But the thing that was most alarming about this film was how directly the author of the book (or the film makters)attack the Catholic Church, if not people of faith in general. I had heard some of the religious hoopla about the film before I went to see it, but there's been religious hoopla about movies before that didn't amount to very much(Example: The Last Temptation of Christ) That is NOT the case here.Even though I'm not Catholic and am very aware of the Catholic Church's troubled history and some of its abuses, I could see that this movie was not a representation of a difference of opinion OR simply lopsided in its representation of organized religion. It was a hate-fest. I suppose this should have been clear from the beginning of the movie--before I saw how the Catholic imagery was handled--but I was trying to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. However, I doubt there's another reason to name the souls outside the body ""demons,"" no matter how you spell it, other than to put Catholics and people who believe in God down. (Except for creating enough religious hoopla and controversy that people go to see the movie)Then again, it also seems like the author must have been hurt very deeply at some point by someone who CLAIMED to be a person of faith which is a very sad thing. And I'm sorry for him or her.But back to the movie--I almost hope someone redoes the movie (and the book it's based on) and does the story again without the anti-religious messages.

The golden compass which is an alethiometer. which seeks to help tell find the truth to the puzzles on her journey. Along the way, she discovers grave conspiracies and receives help from the Egyptians, the witches as well as the an armoured bear.Dakota Blue Richards who play the orphaned girl, Lyra Belacqua, is excellent in her part due to the maturity she displays as the quick-witted Lyra.

Kidman's eyes possesses the kind of menace that is intended to kill.The film does suffer at having to adapt a large amount of the book into 2 hours.

654068,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00005JPNY,DonAthos,"[13, 27]","Once upon a time, there was a show called Mystery Science Theater 3000. The premise of this show was to take bad movies from bygone days and riff snarky comedy off of them.Watching MST3k (as it was known by its fans, the MSTies), I was always led to wonder about the original films. For most of them, presumably, there was a day when the movie was taken kind of seriously. I mean, maybe not Manos, but some of those others -- they had writers, directors, and actors who wanted to produce a decent, money-making product (not to mention the investors/producers!). I also bet that a number of the movies spoofed by Joel, Mike & the bots had fans at one point. That they were not complete flops at the theater, or in the minds of the theater-goers.In many respects, cinema has changed from then to now. Budgets are up all-around, and standards have changed so that we're not likely to see the zippers on monsters anymore. But, as the expression goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Bad writing is still bad writing. Zippers on costumes have been replaced with bad CG effects. And high-budget schlock is arguably worse than the low-budget variety. I expect that 30 years from now, we'll again be able to support an MST3k-type venture. If so, certainly there are movies from our age that they could slam with justice.I submit to you that The Golden Compass is one of those movies.Reading Philip Pullman's novel was a decent experience. I enjoyed it. After having read the following two novels in his trilogy, I eventually decided that (sadly) Pullman doesn't really know what he was doing, and that The Golden Compass was more the exception than the rule.Watching this film, where all of the main plot events are presented at a break-neck, frenetic pace, it made me feel foolish for ever having liked the first novel to begin with. The characters are cardboard (what acting talent went to waste, here!), the plot events are unbelievable (even given the grand latitude I cut children's fantasy), and whatever thematic material there is, is convoluted and obscure.This isn't a good movie. It stuffs a mess of exposition into an opening voice over then runs from event to event without time to enjoy anything. I remember in reading the novel that there was some time at the beginning to get to know Lyra before she set out with Mrs. Coulter; here, it happens in the space of about 15 minutes. Seeing the characters come to life points out their basic absurdity, like Lee Scorsby who I could take somewhat seriously in the novel, but not at all here -- he becomes a Texan caricature. Even with its CG world and creatures, this movie never achieves the sense of wonder of, say, a Neverending Story; it has no time for a sense of wonder, and Iorek and Serafina Pekkala are cold substitutes for the likes of Falkor.At the least, the movie tries to address some of the shortcomings of Pullman's book, in reorganizing the final events to end on the main plot's climax, and small things like making Lyra's the only extant alethiometer. But those (good) changes can't overcome the central weaknesses of the story which are only heightened by seeing it try to come to life on the screen.His Dark Materials is often compared (grossly unfairly) with The Lord of the Rings. They are similar, however, in that I'd imagine it would be hard to make either into good films, given the amount of action and detail in them. The Lord of the Rings was given the running time and the care to pull it off in glorious fashion. The Golden Compass, however much money was put into it, was a failure. It disappoints its source material which, in the final analysis, was never all that great. The only good thing to really come out of this film is that, it did so poorly both financially and critically, that the sequels will almost certainly not get made.Another good can be made from this film: fodder for a future version of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[4, 7]","The film that this movie is most likely / most frequently going to be compared to isThe Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full Screen Edition).  This makes sense as both have talking animals and take place in a sort of fairy-tale land of imagination.  Both involve children who either are British or have British accents.However, if one watches both closely, the parallels soon come to a quick halt.  C.S. Lewis' story is a transparent allegory of Jesus and it tacitly exalts Christianity & Christian virtues.  COMPASS, on the other hand, pokes fun at religion in general and has obvious allusions to the Spainish Inquisition & various other nefarious abuses-of-power by religious groups.This, of course, is huge reason why COMPASS didn't do nearly so well at the box office as NARNIA did.  A lot of people may have mistakenly thought that they were going to get a variation on NARNIA and storyling that espouses religious doctrine.  Am sure they must have been shocked to find out that this wasn't a Christian-friendly film!For myself, I found this to be a unique and entertaining story.  I've always been a fan of Nicole Kidman, and I applaud her for not being afraid of the Catholic societies who would condemn her for being a part of the film (which, in fact, they did).  The incorporation of the legendary Derek Jacoby brings credibility to the cast.  Dakota Blue Richards is an outstanding child actress who performed brilliantly in a difficult role.So, if you're not afraid of being accused of heresy and you're looking for a compelling story, then what you just might need to do is grab a golden compass.

654073,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00005JPNY,D. S. Thurlow,"[1, 1]","2007's ""The Golden Compass"" has a lot going for it: an outstanding cast, a high concept plot, and astonishingly good special effects.  It is all the more frustrating that after a good running start, the movie leaves its story seriously incomplete.In the alternate universe of The Golden Compass, people's souls, called daemons, are embodied as animals that walk or fly in company with their owners.  The people in this universe dress in the manner of the early 20th century but use of mixture of old and new technologies.  They are controlled by the Magisterium, a mysterious, semi-religious organization dedicated to peace at the expense of free will and other inconvenient aspects of individuality.At the center of the story is one Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards), a precocious and brave young orphan in the care of a university. Her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is a seeker of truth; he leaves early in the movie for the Far North, to discover the origins of a mysterious dust that may provide a link to other worlds.  After his departure, a Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman as ice queen), arrives to take Lyra in hand and follow Lord Asriel to the North.  It seems that Lyra is special; the university secretly entrusts her with a golden compass that only she can read and that tells the truth about all things.Lyra shortly becomes aware that Mrs. Coulter is far from being the smooth society lady she appears to be.  She escapes and links up with a group of sea-going gypsies to travel to the Far North herself.  Her mission and that of the gypsies is to free a group of kidnapped children, one of whom is Lyra's best friend from the orphanage.  Along the way, Lyra will meet a friendly witch (Eva Green), a great armored polar bear (voiced by Ian McKellan), a helpful aeronaut (Sam Elliot), and tribes of strange warriors.  Her path leads her to a strange laboratory in the Far North, run by the Magisterium, where she will have a fateful confrontation with Mrs. Coulter.The storyline is epic, on the scale of ""The Lord of the Rings"".  The superb special effects make possible the fascinating landscapes of London and the Far North; battle scenes involving Tartar warriors, polar bears, and witches; and the seamless interaction between humans and their daemons.

We all went out afterwards and had a discussion about the film.I was astounded that the children did not see this film as an attack on religion,as much as they saw it as their need to always scrutinize things,to think for themselves and that a promise to a friend is a bond!

However as a movie the jist I got was that its about an orphan girl in an alternate universe, wear peoples souls are on display outside their bodies in the form of an animal they call a daemon.  The State is controlled by The Authority that is apparently a semi religious order, children are disappearing, no one is to talk of ""dust"", there is a race of warrior polar bears who talk, gyptians which are a cross between gypsies/pirates and witches.  The girl has been raised at a college where her uncle does research and when he goes away to the north for futher research into the dust the girl is kidnapped, he is hunted and the chase is on from there......I gotta admit that this is a a rollercoaster ride of a film and it looks technologically nifty but there are some rough patches in the editing when someone is taken and then others are hot on her heels to save her but you don't know how they figured out where to go.  In addition a large world is built for you but you never see the real people and therefore are not sure how they would really react to the Authorities grand plan considering it would be orchestrated on their children in the end and would steal from them something that every parent has spent their entire lives tied to.  It just feels like a few pieces of the puzzle are missing and unintentionally so.  While rarely a proponent for longer films it really dis seem like the Studio cut 10-15 minutes of transitional scenes, explanation and character development.  If not the studios then the director, who has no prior experience on big budget, speciall effects films, simply wasn't up to the task......Still it is a fun film though pretty violent and scary for little kids.  When the bear appears to get his jaw knocked off I was pretty surprised.  Kid torture, animial torture, etc. don't take the under 10 crowd unless they have been desensitized......As to the whole anti religion thing, I see hints of it in the film but then again I am looking for it and am fairly well read but otherwise it seems harmless enough that organized religion should give it a rest.",3,Jaw droppingly average,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2175,"['..I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'transition', 'went', 'However', 'movie', 'jist', 'got', 'was', 'orphan', 'girl', 'alternate', 'universe', 'wear', 'peoples', 'souls', 'are', 'display', 'bodies', 'form', 'animal', 'call', 'daemon', 'State', 'controlled', 'Authority', 'apparently', 'semi', 'religious', 'order', 'children', 'are', 'disappearing', 'one', 'talk', 'dust', 'race', 'warrior', 'polar', 'bears', 'who', 'talk', 'gyptians', 'are', 'cross', 'gypsies/pirates', 'witches', 'girl', 'been', 'raised', 'college', 'where', 'uncle', 'research', 'when', 'away', 'north', 'futher', 'research', 'dust', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'hunted', 'chase', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'film', 'technologically', 'nifty', 'are', 'rough', 'patches', 'editing', 'when', 'someone', 'taken', 'then', 'others', 'are', 'hot', 'heels', 'save', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'figured', 'out', 'where', 'go', 'addition', 'large', 'world', 'built', 'never', 'see', 'real', 'people', 'therefore', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'would', 'really', 'react', 'Authorities', 'grand', 'plan', 'considering', 'would', 'be', 'orchestrated', 'children', 'end', 'would', 'steal', 'something', 'parent', 'spent', 'entire', 'lives', 'tied', 'just', 'feels', 'few', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'missing', 'unintentionally', 'so', 'rarely', 'proponent', 'longer', 'films', 'really', 'seem', 'Studio', 'cut', '10-15', 'minutes', 'transitional', 'scenes', 'explanation', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'studios', 'then', 'director', 'who', 'prior', 'experience', 'big', 'budget', 'speciall', 'effects', 'films', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'task', 'Still', 'fun', 'film', 'pretty', 'violent', 'scary', 'little', 'kids', 'When', 'bear', 'get', 'jaw', 'knocked', 'off', 'was', 'pretty', 'surprised', 'Kid', 'torture', 'animial', 'torture', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', '10', 'crowd', 'have', 'been', 'desensitized', 'whole', 'anti', 'religion', 'thing', 'see', 'hints', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'am', 'looking', 'am', 'fairly', 'well', 'read', 'otherwise', 'harmless', 'enough', 'organized', 'religion', 'should', 'give', 'rest']",The Golden Compass

Morris ""Backroads""","[25, 33]","True, it's been a about three or so years since I've read Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, the books upon which this film is based, if you didn't know. But as that time three years ago was my second time going through the trilogy, I still like to think I had a decent memory of them along with a decent opinion. At the risk of offending fans, I always felt Pullman's characters--Lyra, Mrs. Coulter, Will, the whole gang--to be on the weak side of characterization, a few hops from being completely two-dimensional. STILL, I thought the story and theme to be on another plane entirely, certainly enough to make the books as famous as they are and even flesh out an entertaining movie.I promise, I tried my best to like this movie, for the sake of those books. For the sake of Sam Elliot and the goddess Nicole Kidman. Heck, even for that cute little new girl. They all did their best, but frankly this movie was fluff, and it's hard to work with fluff. How could they take such thought- and controversy- provoking books and turn them into fluff? I'm hardly an atheist, but I had appreciated the story's urge for free thought, free will, and a keener look at authority. The smidgen they put in here was all too welcomed, but not enough to give this movie proper heart and soul.What we are left with is a rushed train of lovely cinematography, scenery, and special effects that accompany an equally rushed plot. Yes, there is a lot of story to get into this movie, but making that the priority left me cold toward these characters who were weak in the book and utterly two-dimensional on screen. I felt like I was an infant teenager being instructed in the ways of generic fantasy. Talking bears? Soul-daemons? Other worlds? Texas as a country? Wonderful, fantastic ideas that appeared on the big screen like toys in hurried images.I'm sorry, but while the director was having fun with the camera, the audience was confused by the random jumping from scene to scene, plot to plot.So maybe it was a tragic result of putting a plot-based rather than character-based story in a movie that led to all story and show and no emotional depth. Maybe it was a tragic result of playing it safe by removing all blatant references to religion. Maybe I'm just a whiney book purist.All I know is that the result was flashy, heartless, and boring.",1,"Well, it's pretty to look at",1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,2336,"['True', 'been', 'three', 'so', 'years', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Pullman', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'trilogy', 'books', 'film', 'based', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'going', 'trilogy', 'still', 'think', 'had', 'decent', 'memory', 'decent', 'opinion', 'risk', 'offending', 'fans', 'always', 'felt', 'Pullman', 'characters', 'Lyra', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'Will', 'whole', 'gang', 'be', 'weak', 'side', 'characterization', 'few', 'hops', 'being', 'completely', 'two-dimensional', 'STILL', 'thought', 'story', 'theme', 'be', 'plane', 'entirely', 'certainly', 'enough', 'make', 'books', 'as', 'famous', 'are', 'even', 'flesh', 'out', 'entertaining', 'movie.I', 'promise', 'tried', 'best', 'like', 'movie', 'sake', 'books', 'sake', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'goddess', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Heck', 'even', 'cute', 'little', 'new', 'girl', 'did', 'best', 'frankly', 'movie', 'was', 'fluff', 'hard', 'work', 'fluff', 'How', 'could', 'take', 'such', 'thought-', 'controversy-', 'provoking', 'books', 'turn', 'fluff', ""'m"", 'hardly', 'atheist', 'had', 'appreciated', 'story', 'urge', 'free', 'thought', 'free', 'will', 'keener', 'look', 'authority', 'smidgen', 'put', 'here', 'was', 'too', 'welcomed', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'proper', 'heart', 'are', 'left', 'rushed', 'train', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'scenery', 'special', 'effects', 'accompany', 'equally', 'rushed', 'plot', 'Yes', 'lot', 'story', 'get', 'movie', 'making', 'priority', 'left', 'cold', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'weak', 'book', 'utterly', 'two-dimensional', 'screen', 'felt', 'was', 'infant', 'teenager', 'being', 'instructed', 'ways', 'generic', 'fantasy', 'Talking', 'bears', 'Soul-daemons', 'Other', 'worlds', 'Texas', 'country', 'Wonderful', 'fantastic', 'ideas', 'appeared', 'big', 'screen', 'toys', 'hurried', 'images.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'director', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'camera', 'audience', 'was', 'confused', 'random', 'jumping', 'scene', 'scene', 'plot', 'plot.So', 'maybe', 'was', 'tragic', 'result', 'putting', 'plot-based', 'rather', 'character-based', 'story', 'movie', 'led', 'story', 'show', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Maybe', 'was', 'tragic', 'result', 'playing', 'safe', 'removing', 'blatant', 'references', 'religion', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'whiney', 'book', 'purist.All', 'know', 'result', 'was', 'flashy', 'heartless', 'boring']",The Golden Compass

654086,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00005JPNY,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[2, 4]","Going into this movie, I was either expecting to get hit over the head with the atheist book of nothingness, or sit through a torturous movie that defines why the fantasy genre should just give up now. And while I did not get hit over the head, nor was I tortured, I was just bored. And yes, the fantasy genre just keeps sinking lower with every copycat that tries to make a fast buck with a big budget. Really people, not every ""bestselling"" book that has the genre of fantasy should be made into a movie.The story and mythology had me more confused then that time when I woke up on the moon, then realized it was just a dream. And if confusing wasn't enough, it was just plain weird. I mean, everybody except the polar bears and the witches had an animal following them all over the place, which was somehow connected to their soul or whatever, and these animals were called ""demons."" Which is even more confusing since the demons or witches in the movie aren't really ""demons"" or ""witches.""The visual effect and action are what really keep the movie on its feet though. The ""Steam-Punk"" look of the cities, and the sheer magnificence of the backgrounds are sure to impress. In terms of action, to add to more confusion, the fight between polar bears, reminded me a lot of the fight between Peter and King Miraz from Narnia 2, in the fact that it didn't excite me, and tended to lean boring, since it was fight for the sake of fight, for fight's sake.But don't let cute, almost Narnian look of this movie fool you, this is not for kids at least under 13, because you will scare the crap out of them, and even kids under 10-13 will have a hard time processing the film's more tense moments, and the sheer evality of the villains.However, the film does deliver in the climax when Lyra escapes from the ""experiment"" proceeds to blow up the place, then run into a battle with a bunch of Russin lookin' characters with swords. And although it would have been a lot cooler if the Polar Bear brought his army to the battle, but hey, I'll take what I can get from this film. The battle offers the film's most exiting moments, and actually shows a glimpse of hope of a good movie.The casting is rather good. Whether the cast was used to their full potential is another thing. Sam Elliot is great in his role, as is Nicole Kidman. The girl who played Lyra was good and kept you interested. But the voice cast on the other hand was thrown away. They were all interchangeable, and could have, and probably should have worked with lesser known actors portraying the roles, since no voice performance really stood out, or was in the least bit memorable. And even though Daniel Craig was put as a featured star, he was in the film for all of five minutes. Christopher Lee on the other hand could have had 30 seconds.Fortunately, this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, instead of the 2 hours it could have been. Unfortunately, this movie banked way too much on having sequels, so the ending is hanging off a cliff with 1 finger. It offers no satisfaction, and it makes you wait for a sequel that probably will never come now. I mean, nothing is really resolved, except for a couple of side-quests. No bad guys are killed, and nothing is really done.And to make matters worse, the credits song takes the award for WORST credits song of all time. It's a lazy effort with pathetic lyrics that has the musical-quality of singing rocks. And frankly, singing rocks is a lot more entertaining.Random Rant: I was disappointed that the polar bear didn't drink Coke at any point in the movie, and Coke didn't have any advertising campaign associated with the movie that I can remember.And although I have not, and will not read the source material, I'm glad they didn't stick to it. The movie was made better for me because I didn't feel like I was being preached at, although I expected to be. And while watching the movie, you don't feel like you're being whacked over the head with some atheistic crap. Sorry to offend all you people that believe in nothing, which is something (confusing I know), but Philip Pullman is the most offensive thing this side of a Nas record.So overall, while this movie does have its moments; they are few and far between. Between the moments are a lot of information that flies over your head, a story that doesn't make much sense, and plot-turns and side-quests that are there just for the sake of being there, and don't really make sense. I don't care if the movie is congruent with the book, just give me a good movie.",3,"OK At Best, Boring At Worst",1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,4530,"['Going', 'movie', 'was', 'either', 'expecting', 'get', 'hit', 'head', 'atheist', 'book', 'nothingness', 'sit', 'torturous', 'movie', 'why', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'should', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'now', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'hit', 'head', 'was', 'tortured', 'was', 'just', 'bored', 'yes', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'just', 'sinking', 'lower', 'copycat', 'make', 'fast', 'buck', 'big', 'budget', 'Really', 'people', 'not', 'bestselling', 'book', 'genre', 'fantasy', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'movie.The', 'story', 'mythology', 'had', 'more', 'confused', 'then', 'time', 'when', 'woke', 'up', 'moon', 'then', 'realized', 'was', 'just', 'dream', 'confusing', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'mean', 'everybody', 'polar', 'bears', 'witches', 'had', 'animal', 'following', 'place', 'was', 'somehow', 'connected', 'soul', 'whatever', 'animals', 'were', 'called', 'demons', 'Which', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'demons', 'witches', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'demons', 'witches', 'visual', 'effect', 'action', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'keep', 'movie', 'feet', 'Steam-Punk', 'look', 'cities', 'sheer', 'magnificence', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'sure', 'impress', 'terms', 'action', 'add', 'more', 'confusion', 'fight', 'polar', 'bears', 'reminded', 'lot', 'fight', 'Peter', 'King', 'Miraz', 'Narnia', '2', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'excite', 'tended', 'lean', 'boring', 'was', 'fight', 'sake', 'fight', 'fight', 'sake.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'cute', 'almost', 'Narnian', 'look', 'movie', 'fool', 'not', 'kids', 'least', '13', 'will', 'scare', 'crap', 'even', 'kids', '10-13', 'will', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'processing', 'film', 'more', 'tense', 'moments', 'sheer', 'evality', 'villains.However', 'film', 'deliver', 'climax', 'when', 'Lyra', 'experiment', 'proceeds', 'blow', 'up', 'place', 'then', 'run', 'battle', 'bunch', 'Russin', 'lookin', 'characters', 'swords', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'cooler', 'Polar', 'Bear', 'brought', 'army', 'battle', 'hey', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'battle', 'film', 'most', 'exiting', 'moments', 'actually', 'glimpse', 'hope', 'good', 'movie.The', 'casting', 'rather', 'good', 'cast', 'was', 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'thing', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'great', 'role', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Lyra', 'was', 'good', 'kept', 'interested', 'voice', 'cast', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'thrown', 'away', 'were', 'interchangeable', 'could', 'have', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'worked', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'portraying', 'roles', 'voice', 'performance', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'least', 'bit', 'memorable', 'even', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'was', 'put', 'featured', 'star', 'was', 'film', 'five', 'minutes', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'other', 'hand', 'could', 'have', 'had', '30', 'seconds.Fortunately', 'movie', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'instead', '2', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'banked', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'having', 'sequels', 'ending', 'hanging', 'off', 'cliff', '1', 'finger', 'satisfaction', 'wait', 'sequel', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'now', 'mean', 'nothing', 'really', 'resolved', 'couple', 'side-quests', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'killed', 'nothing', 'really', 'done.And', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'credits', 'song', 'award', 'WORST', 'credits', 'song', 'time', 'lazy', 'effort', 'pathetic', 'lyrics', 'musical-quality', 'singing', 'rocks', 'frankly', 'singing', 'rocks', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining.Random', 'Rant', 'was', 'disappointed', 'polar', 'bear', 'did', ""n't"", 'drink', 'Coke', 'point', 'movie', 'Coke', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'associated', 'movie', 'can', 'remember.And', 'have', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'read', 'source', 'material', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'being', 'preached', 'expected', 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'being', 'whacked', 'head', 'atheistic', 'crap', 'Sorry', 'offend', 'people', 'believe', 'nothing', 'something', 'confusing', 'know', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'most', 'offensive', 'thing', 'side', 'Nas', 'record.So', 'overall', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Between', 'moments', 'are', 'lot', 'information', 'head', 'story', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'plot-turns', 'side-quests', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'sake', 'being', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'congruent', 'book', 'just', 'give', 'good', 'movie']",The Golden Compass

654088,AHB0L35LOICAN,B00005JPNY,"GB Banks (publisher, author) "", author""","[3, 5]","I've never read the original books by author Philip Pullman, but I heard much about them leading up to the release of this much anticipated film adaptation. One of the things I hate most about such pre-hype for a film like this is that you can't help but form biased opinions about the success or failure of the project even though you've yet to see it with your own eyes. Given that the original books were written as an expression of Mr. Pullman's atheist beliefs, which though I disagree with, I have the utmost respect for, and having heard that the movie had been changed to downplay that particular angle, I was afraid that what would be left would be a watered down, generic fantasy with a lot of special effects and action but little or no depth. So I'm happy to say that when I finally saw this film the other night, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, one of the gripes I do have with the film is that I'm not sure that it ever really provides the audience with a full understanding of what's at stake. We quickly learn that on this world, daemons are living, physical manifestations of a person's soul that walk alongside their human counterparts, appearing in animal form. There is also reference to Dust, which is believed to connect this world with the many other parallel worlds out there, and which is somehow related to why a child's daemon can change form at will but an adult's cannot. Lord Asriel, played in the film by current James Bond star Daniel Craig, believes that he can use this discovery as a way to travel between worlds. Meanwhile, Mrs. Coulter, portrayed in a wonderfully scary way by Nicole Kidman, represents the Magisterium, an organization that seeks to, for some unexplained reason, control people through their beliefs. The Magisterium also has been kidnapping children in an evil plot involving the children's daemons. Lyra, portrayed by Dakota Blue Richards, is Lord Asriel's niece, an orphan being raised at Oxford, who is given a device which is capable of discerning the truth of things. Lyra, along with her alethiometer, or golden compass, proves to be a child prophesied long ago who will ultimately determine the future of everyone.While I can sort of fill in the gaps on my own, I never felt satisfied that I had been given a firm explanation for the Magisterium and the full implications of their plan. I suspect that this is the point where the removal of any anti-religious content may have left a gap in the story, a missing piece that was left ambiguous rather than filling it with something contrived. That absence, along with parts of the story early on that felt a bit rushed, keep me from giving the story 5 stars. But it is beautiful visually, in some ways even more so than Lord of the Rings. The story is certainly more than exciting enough for the young and young at heart, and if you pay close attention, even with the missing allusions to the books original undercurrent, you can sense the message is still there, and I felt that was a very big plus.I will definitely be looking forward to the anticipated second film in the trilogy, and I think once you've seen it, so will you.- Gregory Bernard Banks, author ofThe Summoner, and other books",4,"A ""Golden"" Story with a Relevant Message",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,3208,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'original', 'books', 'author', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'heard', 'much', 'leading', 'up', 'release', 'much', 'anticipated', 'film', 'adaptation', 'One', 'things', 'hate', 'most', 'such', 'pre-hype', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'form', 'biased', 'opinions', 'success', 'failure', 'project', 'even', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'Given', 'original', 'books', 'were', 'written', 'expression', 'Mr.', 'Pullman', 'atheist', 'beliefs', 'disagree', 'have', 'utmost', 'respect', 'having', 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'downplay', 'particular', 'angle', 'was', 'afraid', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'would', 'be', 'watered', 'down', 'generic', 'fantasy', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'little', 'depth', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'when', 'finally', 'saw', 'film', 'other', 'night', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.First', 'off', 'one', 'gripes', 'do', 'have', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'really', 'audience', 'full', 'understanding', 'what', 'stake', 'quickly', 'learn', 'world', 'daemons', 'are', 'living', 'physical', 'manifestations', 'person', 'soul', 'walk', 'human', 'counterparts', 'appearing', 'animal', 'form', 'also', 'reference', 'Dust', 'believed', 'connect', 'world', 'many', 'other', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'there', 'somehow', 'related', 'why', 'child', 'daemon', 'can', 'change', 'form', 'will', 'adult', 'can', 'not', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'played', 'film', 'current', 'James', 'Bond', 'star', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'can', 'use', 'discovery', 'way', 'travel', 'worlds', 'Meanwhile', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'portrayed', 'wonderfully', 'scary', 'way', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Magisterium', 'organization', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'control', 'people', 'beliefs', 'Magisterium', 'also', 'been', 'kidnapping', 'children', 'evil', 'plot', 'involving', 'children', 'daemons', 'Lyra', 'portrayed', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'niece', 'orphan', 'being', 'raised', 'Oxford', 'who', 'given', 'device', 'capable', 'discerning', 'truth', 'things', 'Lyra', 'alethiometer', 'golden', 'compass', 'be', 'child', 'prophesied', 'long', 'ago', 'who', 'will', 'ultimately', 'determine', 'future', 'everyone.While', 'can', 'sort', 'fill', 'gaps', 'own', 'never', 'felt', 'satisfied', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'firm', 'explanation', 'Magisterium', 'full', 'implications', 'plan', 'suspect', 'point', 'where', 'removal', 'anti-religious', 'content', 'may', 'have', 'left', 'gap', 'story', 'missing', 'piece', 'was', 'left', 'ambiguous', 'rather', 'filling', 'something', 'contrived', 'absence', 'parts', 'story', 'early', 'felt', 'bit', 'rushed', 'keep', 'giving', 'story', '5', 'stars', 'beautiful', 'visually', 'ways', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'story', 'certainly', 'more', 'exciting', 'enough', 'young', 'young', 'heart', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'even', 'missing', 'allusions', 'books', 'original', 'undercurrent', 'can', 'sense', 'message', 'still', 'there', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'plus.I', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'anticipated', 'second', 'film', 'trilogy', 'think', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'will', 'you.-', 'Gregory', 'Bernard', 'Banks', 'author', 'ofThe', 'Summoner', 'other', 'books']",The Golden Compass

Yes, this is still a fantasy film, but the emphasis is more on stylish creation of various animals (in the forms of 'daemons' that accompany children as their souls, morphing into various animal life at will) than tiresome explosions and flying beasties.Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is clearly the star of this adventure that explores the possibility of other, parallel worlds whose interaction with the world as we know it is controlled by various groups of good guys and bad guys, all seeking the source of secrecy contained in a Golden Compass that can only be read by a single girl - Lyra, a poor child living in the presence of scholars.  Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) places the Golden Compass in Lyra's knowing hands and heads off to the far North to investigate the element that binds all life together - Dust. The tale is set in motion by the enigmatic Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) who gains Lyra's confidence and offers to take her to the great North.  All manner of adventures occur on the journey - friends of Lyra's  are threatened to be separated from their various daemons in the cruel hands of the bad guys, Lyra's encounter with a witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), her assistance from a friendly astronaut (Sam Elliott) and an armored bear - and with all fantasies, good prevails - or does it?  Tune in for the very obvious next installment.The pleasures are many, not the least of which are the voices and changing forms of the little animal daemons.

I was extremely psyched when I heard that a movie would be made of the first book, but never got around to seeing it until it was out on DVD.Lyra is a young orphan girl (roughly 11 or 12) who has been raised by the scholars at Jordan College in Oxford (similar to England).  Lyra's world is very like our own, except for one distinct difference: people's souls, or daemons, can be found externally in the form of various animals.  Lyra accidentally overhears her uncle Asriel, some Jordan College scholars, and a representative of the Magisterium talking about Dust.  Dust seems to be a hot topic in her world - Lord Asriel is trying to find a way to get to parallel worlds to learn more about Dust; the Magisterium, with the aid of the mysterious Mrs. Coulter, is trying to suppress Dust; and children are going missing in freaky experiments involving Dust.  When Lyra's friends Billy and Roger are taken, she sets off on an epic adventure to save them.Overall, the movie stays very true to the original novel, and it's beautifully done.  The special effects (flying witches, talking bears) are well done and not cheesy at all.  The acting is superb and, in my opinion, the movie itself is excellent.Some things could have been confusing for viewers not familiar with Pullman's trilogy.  Daemons are sort of explained in the beginning, but in addition to being part of someone's soul, they're also a physical manifest of someone's personality, so the animals of the adults are very telling about their character.  That's also the reason why the children's daemons keep shifting; their ""permanent"" personalities are still being formed.  They're also very personal entities, which is why it freaks a person out when their daemon is handled by another person (and there's an unspoken taboo about it in Lyra's world, too).  I know they can't put all of that in a movie, but those little tidbits, found in the book, are extremely helpful to understanding the movie.I did wonder about the ending - they chose to end it on a hopeful note instead of the dark, dramatic one in the book.  I had heard rumors that, depending on how well ""Golden Compass"" did, they weren't necessarily going to make the second movie, so the cliffhanger ending from the first book probably had to get shuffled aside.  It certainly makes me curious about how they're going to handle it in a sequel.There was a lot of fuss when this movie was released because the books are, in tone, fairly anti-religious.  These books (and movie) are pretty dark with some heavy philosophical questions.  They aren't intended for children necessarily, even though the protagonist is a child.  (Which always makes me wonder why they're shelved in the children's section?!)  However, Pullman doesn't pull out the heavy anti-religious stuff until book three, and I have to wonder how the script writers are going to handle it, because you can't really tweak it without changing the entire story line.  But we don't have to worry about that for right now, since movie two hasn't even been released yet.Overall, a great movie, beautifully done with a great cast.  Definitely worth checking out, even if you've never read the books.  If you're thinking of watching this with young children, definitely heed the PG-13 rating.",4,masterfully done movie of a modern classic,1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,3415,"['Philip', 'Pullman', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'trilogy', 'Golden', 'Compass/Subtle', 'Knife/Amber', 'Spyglass', 'are', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'books', 'fantasy', 'was', 'extremely', 'psyched', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'first', 'book', 'never', 'got', 'seeing', 'was', 'out', 'DVD.Lyra', 'young', 'orphan', 'girl', 'roughly', '11', '12', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'scholars', 'Jordan', 'College', 'Oxford', 'similar', 'England', 'Lyra', 'world', 'very', 'own', 'one', 'distinct', 'difference', 'people', 'souls', 'daemons', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'externally', 'form', 'various', 'animals', 'Lyra', 'accidentally', 'uncle', 'Asriel', 'Jordan', 'College', 'scholars', 'representative', 'Magisterium', 'talking', 'Dust', 'Dust', 'be', 'hot', 'topic', 'world', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'learn', 'more', 'Dust', 'Magisterium', 'aid', 'mysterious', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'trying', 'suppress', 'Dust', 'children', 'are', 'going', 'missing', 'freaky', 'experiments', 'involving', 'Dust', 'When', 'Lyra', 'friends', 'Billy', 'Roger', 'are', 'taken', 'off', 'epic', 'adventure', 'save', 'them.Overall', 'movie', 'very', 'true', 'original', 'novel', 'beautifully', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'flying', 'witches', 'talking', 'bears', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'superb', 'opinion', 'movie', 'excellent.Some', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'confusing', 'viewers', 'not', 'familiar', 'Pullman', 'trilogy', 'Daemons', 'are', 'sort', 'explained', 'beginning', 'addition', 'being', 'part', 'someone', 'soul', ""'re"", 'also', 'physical', 'manifest', 'someone', 'personality', 'animals', 'adults', 'are', 'very', 'telling', 'character', 'also', 'reason', 'why', 'children', 'daemons', 'keep', 'shifting', 'permanent', 'personalities', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'formed', ""'re"", 'also', 'very', 'personal', 'entities', 'why', 'person', 'out', 'when', 'daemon', 'handled', 'person', 'unspoken', 'taboo', 'Lyra', 'world', 'too', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'movie', 'little', 'tidbits', 'found', 'book', 'are', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'understanding', 'movie.I', 'did', 'wonder', 'ending', 'chose', 'end', 'hopeful', 'note', 'instead', 'dark', 'dramatic', 'one', 'book', 'had', 'heard', 'rumors', 'depending', 'how', 'well', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'did', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'going', 'make', 'second', 'movie', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'first', 'book', 'probably', 'had', 'get', 'shuffled', 'aside', 'certainly', 'curious', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'handle', 'sequel.There', 'was', 'lot', 'fuss', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'books', 'are', 'tone', 'fairly', 'anti-religious', 'books', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'dark', 'heavy', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'are', ""n't"", 'intended', 'children', 'necessarily', 'even', 'protagonist', 'child', 'Which', 'always', 'wonder', 'why', ""'re"", 'shelved', 'children', 'section', 'However', 'Pullman', ""n't"", 'pull', 'out', 'heavy', 'anti-religious', 'stuff', 'book', 'three', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'script', 'writers', 'are', 'going', 'handle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tweak', 'changing', 'entire', 'story', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'right', 'now', 'movie', 'two', ""n't"", 'even', 'been', 'released', 'yet.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'done', 'great', 'cast', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'books', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'watching', 'young', 'children', 'definitely', 'heed', 'PG-13', 'rating']",The Golden Compass

It is the first in a trilogy, The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass . The story is set in an alternate earth and is about a young girl named Lyra Belacqua who stumbles upon a political conflict occurring amongst the adults in her life. Her uncle, Lord Asriel is conducting controversial research on this mysterious thing called Dust. This research is opposed by the Magesteriem who are the controlling authority in the setting and are determined to save the population from Dust's corrupting influence. But when Lyra's best friend Roger gets abducted by the GOBBLERS she needs to head to the north pole to rescue him. She teams up with Mrs. Coulter who takes a special interest in Lyra and promises to take her to see the North Pole. Before Lyra departs the school she is given a secret to guard and protect by the head master. A secret she must epically keep from Mrs. Coulter.The movie Starred:Marisa Coulter Nicole KidmanLord Asriel Daniel CraigLyra Belacqua Dakota Blue RichardsRoger Ben WalkerPantalaimon (voice) Freddie HighmoreIorek Byrnison (voice) armored ice bear Ian McKellenSerafina Pekkala Eva GreenJohn Faa Jim CarterFarder Coram Tom CourtenayRagnar Sturlusson (voice) bear king Ian McShaneLee Scoresby aeronaut from Texas Sam ElliottFirst High Councilor Christopher LeeStelmaria (voice) Kristin Scott ThomasSecond High Councilor Edward de SouzaHester (voice) Kathy BatesFra Pavel Simon McBurneyMagisterial Emmissary Derek JacobiMa CostaGyptian matriarch Clare HigginsI really enjoyed this film and had a lot of fun watching it. The acting quality was really outstanding with even the CGI Characters behaving in a realistic manner. The animation is consistent throughout the film so as not to break the immaculate reality of the setting. The steam punk elements were visually stunning leaving me memorized in my seat. The film was exciting and entertaining but it didn't quite reach the knock out film level which is why I give it 4.5 stars. I will own it and want to watch it over and over again. I have also included a section for those who are familiar with the book.I loved the acting quality in the film. I felt that the people involved with the film really had a firm familiarity with the materials both the script and the book. I say this because many of the actors and actresses really hit the right emotional note for their scenes. This is particularly difficult feat with this project because there are a lot of subtle actions being taken and secrets that are not reveled until a latter point in the movie. Some of those things are only revealed in the book. I really appreciated seeing the responses that I expected see to seemingly innocuous events.The quality of the CGI characters just amazed me both through the amount of emotion that was shown through the characters and through the realistic behaviors and movements. I was very touched to see Iorek's feelings toward Lyra develop and grow. I was also very entertained in the scenes with Mrs. Coulter's monkey, where she was able to be so reserved hiding her emotions and her monkey was not able to hide anything showing her true feelings. I was most amazed by the realistic movements of the various CGI animals. The animators really captured the natural movements and behavior quarks of each animal lending a delightful realism to the film.The animation was consistent throughout the movie maintaining the immaculate reality. I was able to be pulled into Lyra's world.The steam punk elements were visually stunning. I particularly enjoyed the gyroscopic propulsion elements and how they were consistent throughout the film whether it was on an air ship or on a carriage. I found it a nice visual addition.The movie was not a knock out film though. The events were exciting but the end just didn't pop. This was not a big surprise and I would bet that the studio felt the same and for that reason gave the movie a December release instead of a summer release.For those who are familiar with the book.Book Was better but it's rare for that not to be the case. In the book Phillip Pullman is able to really build a tension and excitement that just drove me all the way through the last 1/3rd of the book. The ending was more of a knockout in the book although more controversial and darker too.They made some changes to adapt the book to the movie. the first 2/3rds was true to the timeline with the events occurring in order as they were in the book. The last 1/3rd of the movie had a different order of events than the book but this was done so that they could end the story on a happy note.That being said the abridgement of the movie was very well done cutting out material to make the movie fit into it's time constraint but also maintaining the spirit of the story. I was very impressed with the movie for that because it is very hard to make the length of a book fit into the short time space of a movie.",4,I really enjoyed this movie,1197417600,"12 12,

First animals who are fascinatingly good on the good side and outrageously bad on the bad side, with the polar bears in between, good or bad according to the king they have. Animals have always fascinated children. Then some good special effects to make the movie a dreaming machine with all types of possible fantasies and visions beyond the surface of things. The film is thus conceived as a mirror handed and stretched out to girls for them to fall in the Wonderland it proposes. At the same time it is modern too and tries to get the boys in the theaters by having some good battles, particularly the general one between Marisa Coulter's army and the gypsies who are on the right side and helped by the bears. There definitely is some charm in this film and girls are coming back to the forefront after a long long absence from it. Dorothy and Alice were so long ago. Unluckily we will have to waif for some time if we want to know whether Lyra will save her father or not. That's the only thing I regret. The general meaning is that a child, a girl as well as a boy, must remain rebellious and must disobey orders from adult authority because that adult world is hiding the truth of life and is aiming at cutting these children off (castrate them in a way) from their wild, free and imaginative animal spirits. We have to save children from normalization and standardization, so that they can forever see the cosmic dust that surrounds us and follow the tracks of the golden compass of their imagination and dreams.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Finally a new heroin in the world of fantasy,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,2366,"['are', 'invited', 'revisit', 'so', 'many', 'old', 'tales', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Dororthy', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Snow-white', 'bad', 'step', 'mother', 'Cinderella', 'own', 'bad', 'stepmother', 'must', 'admit', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'very', 'far', 'when', 'look', 'most', 'traditional', 'image', 'women', 'girls', 'fairy', 'tales', 'other', 'children', 'stories', 'Think', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'who', 'wolf', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'finger', 'first', 'spinning', 'wheel', 'tale', 'girls', 'tale', 'built', 'couple', 'one', 'side', 'bad', 'guy', 'Marisa', 'Coulter', 'other', 'side', 'good', 'girl', 'Lyra', 'Refreshing', 'make', 'modern', 'charming', 'author', 'two', 'elements', 'First', 'animals', 'who', 'are', 'fascinatingly', 'good', 'good', 'side', 'outrageously', 'bad', 'bad', 'side', 'polar', 'bears', 'good', 'bad', 'according', 'king', 'have', 'Animals', 'have', 'always', 'fascinated', 'children', 'Then', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'movie', 'dreaming', 'machine', 'types', 'possible', 'fantasies', 'visions', 'surface', 'things', 'film', 'thus', 'conceived', 'mirror', 'handed', 'stretched', 'out', 'girls', 'fall', 'Wonderland', 'same', 'time', 'modern', 'too', 'tries', 'get', 'boys', 'theaters', 'having', 'good', 'battles', 'particularly', 'general', 'one', 'Marisa', 'Coulter', 'army', 'gypsies', 'who', 'are', 'right', 'side', 'helped', 'bears', 'definitely', 'charm', 'film', 'girls', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'forefront', 'long', 'long', 'absence', 'Dorothy', 'Alice', 'were', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'will', 'have', 'waif', 'time', 'want', 'know', 'Lyra', 'will', 'save', 'father', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'regret', 'general', 'meaning', 'child', 'girl', 'as', 'well', 'boy', 'must', 'remain', 'rebellious', 'must', 'disobey', 'orders', 'adult', 'authority', 'adult', 'world', 'hiding', 'truth', 'life', 'aiming', 'cutting', 'children', 'off', 'castrate', 'way', 'wild', 'free', 'imaginative', 'animal', 'spirits', 'have', 'save', 'children', 'normalization', 'standardization', 'can', 'forever', 'see', 'cosmic', 'dust', 'follow', 'tracks', 'golden', 'compass', 'imagination', 'dreams.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",The Golden Compass

654113,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B00005JPNY,Jem,"[9, 13]","As a viewer that hasn't read the book yet, I enjoyed this film very much.  So much so that I have already purchased the books so that I can get the full picture and continue the tale.  There are very few films that can match the quality and story of the novel they are based on.  So, it's important to keep expectations at a reasonable level.  Hundreds of pages do not shrink to less than 2 hours without losing something.  After speaking with some of my friends who read the book, I think they kept to the spirit of the story if not the letter.  Ironically, the film made far more money in Europe where the books are much more popular.  However, I wasn't watching this for life lessons or implied religious themes.  I wanted an interesting story, engaging characters and a fun adventure.  They delivered all three with some awesome special effects to boot!The acting by the adults in the film was a little over the top, but fit with the grand adventure style of story-telling.  I completely bought Nicole Kidman as a snobby elitist who lives by ""the ends justify the means.""  I liked that good actors were placed even in bit roles (such as Sam Elliot), but the young star and the animals truly stole the show.  Lyra's character will appeal to fans of Hermione Granger and other smart little rebels.  I found myself cheering for her and her daemon.  The producers did a great job with the talking animals.  They blended with the story very well.  I never felt like they were zooming in on every animal every time - ""see, the animals are talking!""  This helped them feel more like characters in the movie than CGI stunts.  The dialog between Lyra and Pan was much like between any two good friends at that age.  And I loved the polar bear.  Who wouldn't get excited about a massive polar bear wearing armor!?  And voiced by Ian McKellan, priceless.  The subject matter is a little more grave than other movies of this genre.  The PG-13 rating was deserved, though much less so than movies like ""Alien vs Predator""!  The ending was a little abrupt, but seeing as it's based on the first book of a trilogy, I can't complain.  The filmakers didn't leave viewers with a killer cliffhanger, just in case the second film isn't made (which I truly hope it is).This 2-disc DVD set is nice.  The extra features have a nice variety with your usual ""making of"" and behind the scenes stuff, but also a feature on the book and adaptation.  The packaging is standard, though I really like the outer sleeves that so many special editions come with these days.  There is no chapter insert - just an advertisement for the World Wildlife Fund and their promotion based on the film (adopt plush animals that represent endangered animals depicted in the film).  I'm happy I bought the 2-disc set.Overall, I thought this was an entertaining film, with great special effects and a unique story.  I am glad I bought the DVD as I will certainly rewatch it.  Though I missed seeing this in the theatre, I would definitely see the sequel on the big screen.

And while there are a lot of very strong reviews for this film there were one or two which really slated it, so I expected an average forgettable film which might at least entertain me. And I do like fantasy stories.This movie was an if for me at first, being that it just seemed like one of the many quickly thrown together fantasy novels/movies that have supposed huge followings. However, I found myself sitting in my living room, and to be honest, I was somewhat impressed at first, the effects were very good, and although you can still obviously tell CGI versus live action, very smooth. The actors did a great job with what they had, and what they had is what ruined the movie. The script was rough at best, with randomly thrown together scenes that were leading towards an Aha! moment that never came. The whole movie kept building, and the plot kept thickening. However, in the end we are left with a sub par battle and more questions than when the movie started.Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is clearly the star of this adventure that explores the possibility of other, parallel worlds whose interaction with the world as we know it is controlled by various groups of good guys and bad guys, all seeking the source of secrecy contained in a Golden Compass that can only be read by a single girl - Lyra, a poor child living in the presence of scholars. Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) places the Golden Compass in Lyra's knowing hands and heads off to the far North to investigate the element that binds all life together - Dust. The tale is set in motion by the enigmatic Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) who gains Lyra's confidence and offers to take her to the great North. All manner of adventures occur on the journey - friends of Lyra's are threatened to be separated from their various daemons in the cruel hands of the bad guys, Lyra's encounter with a witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), her assistance from a friendly astronaut (Sam Elliott) and an armored bear - and with all fantasies, good prevails - or does it?It seems as if the sole purpose for this movie was to be the directors vehicle for a sequel, as the end comes at a point in the story which traditionally would be the arc of the plot, however we end up getting rolling credits in place of explanation. If there is one thing that I did actually enjoy in this movie, I will say once again, the Golden Compass was visually pleasant and well acted but lacked direction. In the end I saw a fantasy adventure which left me longing for more scenes of fighting polar bears. While my kids saw, a somewhat disjointed visual presentation of a well loved book series. Even though I've encountered the glitz and general awe over Nicole Kidman's wardrobe, the overall experience wasn't so delightful.",2,2.5--Golden Compass fails to strike Gold,1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,2841,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'past', 'couple', 'weeks', 'are', 'lot', 'very', 'strong', 'reviews', 'film', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'really', 'slated', 'so', 'expected', 'average', 'forgettable', 'film', 'might', 'least', 'entertain', 'do', 'fantasy', 'stories.This', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'being', 'just', 'seemed', 'one', 'many', 'quickly', 'together', 'fantasy', 'novels/movies', 'have', 'supposed', 'huge', 'followings', 'However', 'found', 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'somewhat', 'impressed', 'first', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'still', 'obviously', 'tell', 'CGI', 'versus', 'live', 'action', 'very', 'smooth', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'what', 'had', 'what', 'ruined', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'rough', 'best', 'randomly', 'thrown', 'together', 'scenes', 'were', 'leading', 'towards', 'Aha', 'moment', 'never', 'came', 'whole', 'movie', 'kept', 'building', 'plot', 'kept', 'thickening', 'However', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'sub', 'par', 'battle', 'more', 'questions', 'when', 'movie', 'started.Lyra', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'clearly', 'star', 'adventure', 'possibility', 'other', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'interaction', 'world', 'know', 'controlled', 'various', 'groups', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'seeking', 'source', 'secrecy', 'contained', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'read', 'single', 'girl', 'Lyra', 'poor', 'child', 'living', 'presence', 'scholars', 'Lyra', 'uncle', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Lyra', 'knowing', 'hands', 'heads', 'far', 'North', 'investigate', 'element', 'life', 'together', 'Dust', 'tale', 'set', 'motion', 'enigmatic', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'gains', 'Lyra', 'confidence', 'take', 'great', 'North', 'manner', 'adventures', 'occur', 'journey', 'friends', 'Lyra', 'are', 'threatened', 'be', 'separated', 'various', 'daemons', 'cruel', 'hands', 'bad', 'guys', 'Lyra', 'encounter', 'witch', 'Serafina', 'Pekkala', 'Eva', 'Green', 'assistance', 'friendly', 'astronaut', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'armored', 'bear', 'fantasies', 'good', 'prevails', 'sole', 'purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'directors', 'vehicle', 'sequel', 'end', 'point', 'story', 'traditionally', 'would', 'be', 'arc', 'plot', 'however', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'rolling', 'credits', 'place', 'explanation', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'once', 'again', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'was', 'visually', 'pleasant', 'well', 'acted', 'lacked', 'direction', 'end', 'saw', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'left', 'longing', 'more', 'scenes', 'fighting', 'polar', 'bears', 'kids', 'saw', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'visual', 'presentation', 'well', 'loved', 'book', 'series', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'glitz', 'general', 'awe', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'wardrobe', 'overall', 'experience', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'delightful']",The Golden Compass
654116,A3CWEK9HY2VPDL,B00005JPNY,J. Green,"[5, 8]","I've heard the rhetoric against this movie and Mr. Pullman's books, and as a religious person myself I was a bit concerned.  But we acquired this movie with a bunch of others at a PTA fundraiser so we watched it with the kids.  And while I think I can see where Mr. Pullman is going - he is an outspoken atheist and I'm told his series of books end with the children killing ""God"" - it seemed very toned down in this movie.  At any rate, such an idea isn't really developed in the movie and my kids didn't pick up on any anti-religion agenda.As near as I could tell the story takes place in a parallel universe where people's souls appear as an animal companion (called a ""daemon,"" but pronounced ""demon"") which doesn't settle into a single form until the child becomes an adult.  A young orphan girl named Lyra lives at a university with her demon, Pan, which is usually in the form of a ferret.  She is given a Golden Compass, or alethiometer, which tells her truth, and she is a natural at using it.  There's also a government of sorts called the Magisterium, which we're told is trying to control everyone (and apparently kidnapping uncooperative children), and there's something about ""Dust"" which was a little vague - sort of a link between the parallel universes, I think.  There's a kingdom of polar bears, good witches, a bunch of pirates or gypsies called ""Gyptians,"" a wise cowboy who flies a blimp, and a bunch of evil Nazi or Communist-like bad guys.The CG animation is done well enough (not as good as the Narnia movies, although parts are rather stunning) and the acting is fine, but the movie is just plain stupid.  I'm guessing that in order to tone down anti-religious sentiments from the book they've left out so much of the plot as to render the movie practically impotent - either that or the book is stupid as well, but I'll give the book the benefit of the doubt.  I agree with the theme of encouraging children (and grownups) to think for themselves, but that doesn't make it worthwhile.  But all the gushing reviews comparing it to ""The Lord of the Rings"" and other fantasy movies are ridiculous.  The plot was dull, characters aren't developed, the polar bears were cartoonish, the obvious cliff-hanging setup for a sequel(s) was annoying, and in the end it just wasn't entertaining.  I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because one of my kids liked it, but the others were bored stiff. (EDIT: Since then the one child who initially liked it has watched it again and changed her mind).So, if you haven't seen it yet, forget about all the fearful cautions from the religious groups and the overenthusiastic giddiness of the anti-religious groups, and just skip it altogether.",2,Comparisons to The Lord of the Rings are ridiculous,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,2698,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'rhetoric', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Pullman', 'books', 'religious', 'person', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'acquired', 'movie', 'bunch', 'others', 'PTA', 'fundraiser', 'watched', 'kids', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Pullman', 'going', 'outspoken', 'atheist', ""'m"", 'told', 'series', 'books', 'end', 'children', 'killing', 'God', 'seemed', 'very', 'toned', 'down', 'movie', 'rate', 'idea', ""n't"", 'really', 'developed', 'movie', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'anti-religion', 'agenda.As', 'could', 'tell', 'story', 'place', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'people', 'souls', 'appear', 'animal', 'companion', 'called', 'daemon', 'pronounced', 'demon', ""n't"", 'settle', 'single', 'form', 'child', 'adult', 'young', 'orphan', 'girl', 'named', 'Lyra', 'university', 'demon', 'Pan', 'usually', 'form', 'ferret', 'given', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'alethiometer', 'truth', 'natural', 'using', 'also', 'government', 'sorts', 'called', 'Magisterium', ""'re"", 'told', 'trying', 'control', 'everyone', 'apparently', 'kidnapping', 'uncooperative', 'children', 'something', 'Dust', 'was', 'little', 'vague', 'sort', 'link', 'parallel', 'universes', 'think', 'kingdom', 'polar', 'bears', 'good', 'witches', 'bunch', 'pirates', 'gypsies', 'called', 'Gyptians', 'wise', 'cowboy', 'who', 'blimp', 'bunch', 'evil', 'Nazi', 'Communist-like', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'CG', 'animation', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Narnia', 'movies', 'parts', 'are', 'rather', 'stunning', 'acting', 'fine', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'order', 'tone', 'down', 'anti-religious', 'sentiments', 'book', ""'ve"", 'left', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'render', 'movie', 'practically', 'impotent', 'book', 'stupid', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'give', 'book', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'agree', 'theme', 'encouraging', 'children', 'grownups', 'think', ""n't"", 'make', 'worthwhile', 'gushing', 'reviews', 'comparing', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'other', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'was', 'dull', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'polar', 'bears', 'were', 'cartoonish', 'obvious', 'cliff-hanging', 'setup', 'sequel', 's', 'was', 'annoying', 'end', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', ""'ll"", 'give', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'one', 'kids', 'liked', 'others', 'were', 'bored', 'stiff', 'EDIT', 'then', 'one', 'child', 'who', 'initially', 'liked', 'watched', 'again', 'changed', 'mind', '.So', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'forget', 'fearful', 'cautions', 'religious', 'groups', 'overenthusiastic', 'giddiness', 'anti-religious', 'groups', 'just', 'skip', 'altogether']",The Golden Compass

654118,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JPNY,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[3, 7]","The Golden Compass is one of those fantasy series that just released one movie just to see how it would do. I honestly hate when film-makers do that. I mean I liked a Series of Unfortunate Events and couldn't wait for another part and then I hear it won't happen because the first didn't make enough money. That movie at least tried to end everything in one movie just in case. The Golden Compass basically ends with nothing being resolved. So if it doesn't make enough money we'll never find out what happens next, well unless you read the books.What also bugs me is that the cast is great and if sequels do happen none of them are even signed on for more. Plus if it takes years to make another Dakota Blue Richards might be too old for the part which would be a shame. Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig get to make a better movie together since the Invasion and are really good. But it's Dakota Blue Richards that's really needed if another is made. She's a talented young actress that literly came out of nowhere who really owns the part. If the girl in Little Miss Sunshine could be nominated for that then give Dakota Blue Richards a nomination as well.The movie looks great and does have some cool battles. Most of the fights are owned by the big Polar Bear who's also a good thing about the movie. It's just that the movie makes you think ok that part was cool and so was that part but that's all ? It could've easily have been longer and the actors really deserved it to be because they are all in top form. It's too short and anti-climatic than they deserved but hey the movie is still 100 times better than Eragon at least.

654119,A1OI9O2S4UOB5O,B00005JPNY,"JL ""J""","[0, 0]","When I discuss this movie with people, they are often surprised to note that it is based on a series of Novels known as the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy.The Golden Compassis the first of the three novels, and to date the only one made into a motion picture (and based of the general controversy and dismal box office number in the US it's likely to remain that way). I should start by noting that I'm not one of those people who always believes that the book is better than the movie. There are several examples of movies and TV series that really out perform their print editions; Bones, Practical Magic, etc. I do believe; however, that it should be noted that this movie is significantly different from the novel. Please note, if you are a Golden Compass book or His Dark Materials fan, you may want to rent this one before buying.This movie is geared toward a younger child than the books. Given its intended audience it does rather well. There's not much room for character development so Lyra's actions don't always make a great deal of sense.The biblical reference to the ""Authority"" from the book trilogy has been cleverly removed from the film so it's also not as clear what the character's motivations are. There are some spirited performances; however, from Dakota Blue Richards (Lyra), Nicole Kidman (Ms. Coulter), and Ian McKellen (Iorek Byrnison). Freddie Highmore's vocalization of Pantalaimon (Lyra's Daemon) almost made me turn off the film on 4 separate occasions.Beyond the characters and plot, the visuals are amazing. It's very clear that this movie had a great deal of special effects budget. It was also not afraid to hold some gorey punches (pun intended) here and there.The soundtrack isn't bad, but it's certainly not going to be iTunes' top-seller.The bonus content on the BluRay edition of this film is definitely worth the extra for the two disc edition. Speaking of BluRay, if you are trying to decide between it and the DVD copy for this film I would highly recommend the BluRay edition. There's a lot of graphical wizardry, the kind that BluRay does extremely well.Overall, I think it's worth a rent if you have children, or if you enjoy family type movies. As a fan of the ""His Dark Materials"" novels I was extremely disappointed, especially with the end of this film. If you are concerned about renting or purchasing this for your family due to the controversy surrounding it, as always make the decision that's right for you, but know that they've greatly downplayed the parts that caused most of the controversy in the novels (for better or worse).If you are interested in other books in the same series as the one this movie was based off of, here you go:-The Subtle Knife, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 2)(Rough-cut)-The Amber Spyglass, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 3)(Rough-cut)-Lyra's Oxford",3,"A fair movie, loosely based on the book",1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,2888,"['When', 'discuss', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'surprised', 'note', 'based', 'series', 'Novels', 'known', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'trilogy.The', 'Golden', 'Compassis', 'first', 'three', 'novels', 'date', 'only', 'one', 'made', 'motion', 'picture', 'based', 'general', 'controversy', 'dismal', 'box', 'office', 'number', 'US', 'likely', 'remain', 'way', 'should', 'start', 'noting', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'always', 'book', 'better', 'movie', 'are', 'several', 'examples', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'really', 'perform', 'print', 'editions', 'Bones', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'etc', 'do', 'believe', 'however', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'movie', 'significantly', 'different', 'novel', 'Please', 'note', 'are', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'book', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'fan', 'may', 'want', 'rent', 'one', 'buying.This', 'movie', 'geared', 'younger', 'child', 'books', 'Given', 'intended', 'audience', 'rather', 'well', 'not', 'much', 'room', 'character', 'development', 'Lyra', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'great', 'deal', 'sense.The', 'biblical', 'reference', 'Authority', 'book', 'trilogy', 'been', 'cleverly', 'removed', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'are', 'spirited', 'performances', 'however', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'Lyra', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Ms.', 'Coulter', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Iorek', 'Byrnison', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'vocalization', 'Pantalaimon', 'Lyra', 'Daemon', 'almost', 'made', 'turn', 'off', 'film', '4', 'separate', 'occasions.Beyond', 'characters', 'plot', 'visuals', 'are', 'amazing', 'very', 'clear', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'afraid', 'hold', 'gorey', 'punches', 'pun', 'intended', 'here', 'there.The', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'bad', 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'iTunes', 'top-seller.The', 'bonus', 'content', 'BluRay', 'edition', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'extra', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'Speaking', 'BluRay', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'BluRay', 'edition', 'lot', 'graphical', 'wizardry', 'kind', 'BluRay', 'extremely', 'well.Overall', 'think', 'rent', 'have', 'children', 'enjoy', 'family', 'type', 'movies', 'fan', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'novels', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'concerned', 'renting', 'purchasing', 'family', 'due', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'always', 'make', 'decision', 'right', 'know', ""'ve"", 'greatly', 'downplayed', 'parts', 'caused', 'most', 'controversy', 'novels', 'better', 'worse', 'are', 'interested', 'other', 'books', 'same', 'series', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'here', 'go', '-The', 'Subtle', 'Knife', 'Deluxe', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'Book', '2', 'Rough-cut', 'Amber', 'Spyglass', 'Deluxe', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'Book', '3', 'Rough-cut', '-Lyra', 'Oxford']",The Golden Compass

654122,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00005JPNY,John F. Rooney,"[4, 8]","I viewed The Golden Compass completely unaware this might be the first in a series of three movies, fully incognizant of the three books the series is based upon, and supremely ignorant of the religious controversy swirling around the books. I did not notice anything controversial in the movie or anything thought-provoking for those looking for serious enlightenment. The flick is mostly fantasy with some pseudo-scientific gobbledygook thrown in to make you think you're seeing something of import.The first thing that puzzles nave viewers like myself is that everyone is accompanied by some kind of a personal animal, some of them very weird looking and all apparently capable of morphing into other creatures. These are individual daemons, and if one loses one's daemon, one can be radically altered by bad guys. There always seemed to be a lot of creatures underfoot. Does one have to take them out for a walk so they can do their business?The movie has well-known actors, often playing small roles. Sam Elliott plays a cowboy with an airship. Derek Jacobi, Tom Courtenay,  and Ian McShane are on hand as is Ian McKellen's voice as the good polar bear. Nicole Kidman is a baddie, and why she was chosen for this non-romantic role is a mystery. She has a particularly vile monkey daemon.At the beginning of the movie I thought I saw Radcliffe Camera, a round building that is part of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. Other scenes seemed like Oxford and a Victorian-looking London. At the beginning with the gang of boys there was a distinctly Dickensian and Victorian feel to the story. And were they trying to remind us of the Harry Potter franchise? Jules Verne, anyone?The computerized special effects in the movie will get your attention. The huge polar bears are an important element in the movie. My advice would be just sit back and enjoy this as a fantasy-adventure with clever special effects, and a story which may or may not make any sense to you.

654123,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JPNY,John Kwok,"[12, 21]","I had been eagerly anticipating this film after seeing some impressive movie trailers earlier this year (I am also indebted to Richard Cleary for reminding me of the film's original source material: Philip Pullman's anti-religious young adult fantasy trilogy ""His Dark Materials"" from the 1990s.). Much to my amazement, the hype I have heard about ""The Golden Compass"" was quite true. This is, without question, the best recent fantasy film I have seen since Peter Jackson's instant cinematic classic, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Director Chris Weitz has rendered a mostly faithful adaptation of most of Pullman's first novel, ""The Golden Compass"", via excellent direction, a superb script that he wrote, and excellent casting. If there is a complaint about this film, then I must echo the sentiments of others who've remarked that it ended too abruptly; the film itself could have easily added an additional twenty to thirty minutes in length to resolve some plot threads without being tedious at all.Weitz has done an admirable job in staying true to Pullman's original intentions, without emphasizing too much, the anti-religious themes of both the novel ""The Golden Compass"" and the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy. Indeed, the church, or ""Magisterium"" comes across more as a benign theocracy, until a series of unexpected discoveries lead to the uncovering of a sinister plot involving the church itself. Other major reasons to see this film include its excellent cast. Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards is especially quite captivating as young, plucky heroine Lyra. Nicole Kidman is icily beautiful and brilliant as her nemesis, Mrs. Coulter. Daniel Craig appears all too briefly as Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel. And there's other excellent performances too, ranging from the witch queen Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green) to Texas aeronaut Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliot). If there is one film to take yourself and your family to this Christmas, then ""The Golden Compass"" has to be it.",5,"The Best Fantasy Film Since Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" Saga",1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,1974,"['had', 'been', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'film', 'seeing', 'impressive', 'movie', 'trailers', 'earlier', 'year', 'am', 'also', 'indebted', 'Richard', 'Cleary', 'reminding', 'film', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'anti-religious', 'young', 'adult', 'fantasy', 'trilogy', 'Dark', 'Materials', '1990s.', 'Much', 'amazement', 'hype', 'have', 'heard', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'was', 'quite', 'true', 'question', 'best', 'recent', 'fantasy', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'instant', 'cinematic', 'classic', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'rendered', 'mostly', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'most', 'Pullman', 'first', 'novel', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'excellent', 'direction', 'superb', 'script', 'wrote', 'excellent', 'casting', 'complaint', 'film', 'then', 'must', 'echo', 'sentiments', 'others', 'who', ""'ve"", 'remarked', 'ended', 'too', 'abruptly', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'added', 'additional', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'length', 'resolve', 'plot', 'threads', 'being', 'tedious', 'all.Weitz', 'done', 'admirable', 'job', 'staying', 'true', 'Pullman', 'original', 'intentions', 'emphasizing', 'too', 'much', 'anti-religious', 'themes', 'novel', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'trilogy', 'Indeed', 'church', 'Magisterium', 'across', 'more', 'benign', 'theocracy', 'series', 'unexpected', 'discoveries', 'lead', 'uncovering', 'sinister', 'plot', 'involving', 'church', 'Other', 'major', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'include', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Newcomer', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'especially', 'quite', 'captivating', 'young', 'plucky', 'heroine', 'Lyra', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'icily', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'nemesis', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'too', 'briefly', 'Lyra', 'uncle', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'other', 'excellent', 'performances', 'too', 'ranging', 'witch', 'queen', 'Serafina', 'Pekkala', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Texas', 'aeronaut', 'Lee', 'Scoresby', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'one', 'film', 'take', 'family', 'Christmas', 'then', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'be']",The Golden Compass

654131,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JPNY,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 12]","It seems like anytime a movie becomes embroiled in some form of controversy regarding its content, actors, or whatever the case may be, the controversy surrounding the picture seems to have the opposite effect from what was initially intended by those opposing whatever it was that had caused the uproar. The reason for this is because the controversy catches people's attention and causes some amount of interest to be generated due to the public's curiosity about what is so controversial in the film; so instead of turning people away from the movie as intended, the controversy ends up driving many people towards it. Now, this is generally the case for many of the controversial films that Hollywood releases; however, sometimes this is not the case and the controversy actually serves the purposes of those that were upset by the film. The latter just so happened to be the result of the massive controversy surrounding the recent fantasy release of Philip Pullman's novel ""Northern Lights"" called ""The Golden Compass"" starring Nicole Kidman (""The Invasion""), Daniel Craig (""007: Casino Royale""), and newcomer Dakota Blue Richards.""The Golden Compass"" is the story of a parallel world of fantasy and wonder, where a young girl named Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is destined to hold the fate of the entire universe in her hands, as a powerful gift known as the Golden Compass is given to her to protect. As she begins to use the Compass more and more, Lyra discovers that her world and other world's beyond her own are being threatened by a dangerous woman known as Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). With the aid of a heroic man named Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) and a misfit group of allies that includes talking polar bears, Lyra begins her quest to save her world and the entire universe before it's too late.I must admit that for me the controversy surrounding ""The Golden Compass"" did get my attention, and it did keep me from wanting to see the movie in theaters at least; however, I did still want to see it, if for no other reason than to see for myself if the controversy held any merit. If you are not aware of what the controversy surrounding this movie entailed, then I will enlighten you. Apparently when author Philip Pullman wrote his series of novels that comprise the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, he had one agenda in mind which was to attack Christianity, and make our benevolent and loving God into a being of corruption and oppression. Because of this agenda, which from what I've heard is significantly more prominent in the novels than in the movie adaptation, many religious groups opposed the film's release. In a rare turn of events the uproar surrounding a Hollywood film actually resulted in significantly diminished box office returns here in the states from what had been expected; however, overseas the box office was much more successful but the outcry was far less over there. Regarding the controversy, upon viewing the movie I can see in a few places where the story could be construed as being anti-Christian or anti-religion, but the story for the most part must have been so diluted from what was in the original novels, that I can't really see why the film caused as massive of an uproar. My guess is that most of the opposition was aimed at the books rather than the film, because what was contained in the film would have come off as nothing but typical fantasy movie content had no one pointed out the intent to be anti-Christian. Because if you really think about it, most fantasy movies feature elements that could be construed as anti-Christian or anti-religion, a prime example occurs in ""Star Wars - Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith"" when Obi-Wan is fighting Anakin. In the scene, Obi-Wan says something along the lines of `Only a Sith speaks in absolutes', well as a Christian I speak in absolutes when I say that Jesus is the only way, so by that statement I could take what Obi-Wan was saying as a slap in the face to my religion, but I don't because I know it is a fantasy film and therefore I view it as nothing more than a work of fiction with no real bearing on the real world or my faith.That's enough talk about the controversy surrounding the film, now it's time to focus on what I actually thought about the movie in general. I've got to say that as a fantasy film, ""The Golden Compass"" is not among the best entries into the genre, especially when compared to the far more superior films that have come before it in the forms of the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"". The pace in this film is incredibly slow, for the most part I was bored watching this movie, and was almost tempted to quit watching several times throughout the two hour running time. Working in the film's favor were the very entertaining fight scenes featuring the polar bears, which coincidentally would turn up around the time I would lose so much interest in the film that I was preparing to turn it off, but I wouldn't thanks to those scenes. Those fight scenes were incredible from the impressive CGI effects employed to create the armored polar bears, to the hard-hitting action contained within the scene, everything about those scenes were terrific. As entertaining as those fight scenes were, the brutality of the scenes actually pushed the movie into a much darker tone than I expected. Even without the fight scenes the movie's tone felt a bit darker than most fantasy movies, but when you add those scenes to the mix the tone really takes a turn for the dark, and most likely caused many parents to not give the movie much repeat business, if they gave it any business at all after word of mouth got out regarding the darker subject matter of the movie.The actors in this movie were all very talented A-listers, but some of them seemed a bit wasted in their roles. Nicole Kidman seemed to be genuinely enjoying her scene chewing villainous turn as Mrs. Coulter, a role that was quite a bit different from anything we've seen from her previously in her career. Daniel Craig was good as Lord Asriel, but his role felt more like a cameo than an actual lead role in the film, which surprised me due to the marketing for the film making him seem like a major player in this movie. Most likely his character would see more screen time in the sequels that may or may not occur due to the lacking box office here in the states. Dakota Blue Richards was good as the young heroine, Lyra, although I sometimes felt she was a bit on the annoying side, but for a newcomer she did a good job handling such a large role that required a lot of imagination especially in the scenes where she is supposed to be interacting with her soul (as personified by various animals) or with talking bears. The voice-over actors that personified the various animals featured throughout the film were very good, and were actually the biggest highlights among the cast. From talented veterans Sir Ian McKellan (`Lord of the Rings' trilogy), Ian McShane (""We Are Marshall""), and Kathy Bates (""American Outlaws"") to newcomer Freddie Highmore (""The Spiderwick Chronicles""), the animals were given some of the best voices in Hollywood with which to speak and the movie definitely benefited from their presence.Overall, ""The Golden Compass"" was an extremely dull and boring entry into the generally entertaining fantasy genre. Boasting an incredible cast of actors and actresses, impressive visual effects, and very entertaining and hard-hitting fight scenes, ""The Golden Compass"" could have been among the best that fantasy had to offer; instead, the movie's poorly paced story drained it of any interest for me and left me wishing it would end sooner rather than later.""The Golden Compass"" is rated PG-13 for

I wish they hadn't moved the Bolvangar scene to after the Svalbard scene but I can live with it because they were well done. But, what really bugged me is why they left out the most gripping part of the book, the ending. I mean the revelation of how crazy Azriel is is one of my favorite part. They shouldn't have left out his kidnapping poor Roger and Lyra's attempt to rescue him and they should have left in the opening of the gate and the romantic talk between Coltier and Azriel at the gate. That was my big beef with the movie and they had better put it in the Subtle Knife movie or I will be mad. Oh yeah, the only other thing that truly bugged me was Lyra finding the Costa boy separated from his daemon, It was not him in the book it was Tony Makarios and his daemon was Ratter not the Costa boy's.

654133,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B00005JPNY,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[9, 14]","I have read all three books in the His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman, and I enjoyed the entire series.  I also have read several articles on the making of The Golden Compass, so I was aware, very early on, that this film would end earlier than the book, and that the ending of THIS book would be the beginning of the NEXT movie.  Therefore, I was not as disappointed in the end of this film as many others apparently were.IMHO, the casting of this film is dead on:  Dakota Blue Richards shines as the very determined, single minded Lyra, Daniel Craig is very good as the slightly touched, windmill tilting Lord Asriel, Nicole Kidman is excellent as the true believer, yet evil Mrs. Coulter.  The entire supporting cast does a fine job as well.The cinematography and the animation are both very well done. The settings are truly gorgeous.  Live action and animation blend well, but do have noticeable differences.  This contrast adds to the fantasy element of the film and helps to keep the viewer firmly entrenched in the world of the story.Out of necessity, this movie hits the ground running and keeps up a fast pace.  The book is action-packed and filled with adventures; I imagine that there was much difficultly keeping the viewing time down to a reasonable length.  That being said, an audience who had not read the book could have a hard time keeping up.  I, at least, was able to fill in any gaps.I look forward to the next installment.  I believe that you will like this film, especially if you are a fan of fantasy/adventure stories.

654146,A1XX37HBK45UG8,B00005JPNY,L. Wallach,"[0, 0]","My (now 8-year-old) daughter and I read The Golden Compass and finished it the same night we watched this on Amazon.  We were both disappointed, her especially.For those who've read the book, as to be expected there were many shortcuts, twists of the story to suit something faster-paced and characters conflated or just not given adequate attention to feel like you knew what their personality or motives were.But beyond this, the movie just seemed like a rush to get through as many scenes from the book that they could manage, without really much of any character development.  IE, all plot and little character.  I feel like I have to go back and re-watch it because I'm sure I missed a lot because it was so rushed.The movie did do a great job visualizing everything in the book.  For the most part, everything was more or less how I had imagined this world to be.  Unfortunately, because of the pacing, one didn't get a great chance to really admire all that scenery, because it just went by too quickly.Due to that speed, I would guess that those who hadn't read the book would by and large be somewhat confused about the point of all this.  To them it probably seems like just a crazy fantasy adventure with animal spirits and odd steampunkish devices and vehicles.**Spoiler alert: I'll try to details some of the things I missed from the book that would have made a difference, so if you don't want to know about some of the details of the movie/book, you might want to stop reading.**There was almost no talk of the aurora or the city in the sky, something central to the book.  They do mention mention dust once or twice, but it's mostly Lyra suddenly figuring out what dust is on her own.  The only time there's discussion of it by an adult I think is in the initial scene with Lord Asriel at Jordan.Lyra's character was plucky but had very little range.  There are numerous times in the book where she cried quite a bit.  I guess crying in the movie would have meant either too much time, or somehow would have shown her not to be &#34;strong.&#34;  You got a tiny glimpse of how Lyra could lie/spin a yarn, but just barely.Lord Asriel was in the movie for all of two minutes probably.There was a scene in the movie that was not in the book that made zero sense - Mrs. Coulter slapping her daemon, then comforting it.  We haven't read the other two books in Pullman's series, so maybe this presages something in one of those?  But I kind of doubt it.  The only thing I can think is that either Mrs. Coulter has been separated from her daemon or she is a masochist, because you are supposed to feel everything your daemon feels - something the movie actually shows well for other characters.In general, the movie leaves out the more disturbing scenes, possibly because they thought they were too dark for a younger audience?  For example, while they do show the scene where Lyra discovers the child who's daemon has been separated from him (albeit it's a different character from the one in the book), at the end the import of this is spoiled because a) the child does not die, and b) his mother, comforting him, acts as if it's like he's lost a pet which she promises to find for him.  There is none of the shock of this, only a few signs that this might be more serious than losing a pet.  That's another omission here, although they mention at the very beginning that the animal daemon is part of the person's soul, they don't reinforce this with any other statement throughout the book.  About the only other indication is when a daemon (I think it's mainly just Pantalaiman) is attacked once or twice and it's human seems to feel it's pain.  So the whole idea of &#34;severing&#34; doesn't have nearly the import it does in the book.  I can imagine those who haven't read the book scratching their heads as to that whole idea, and just not getting that it was about the worst thing imaginable - even worse than death - for most people of this world.The movie didn't even include the final scene of the book - the opening of the bridge to the other world.Again, it was really disappointing from an adaptation point of view.  It was interesting to see the visualizations, but ultimately frustrating due to the limitations of film.  Peter Jackson made The Hobbit, a book much shorter than The Golden Compass, into a three-part movie.  If this movie had been given that degree of attention and breathing room, it could have really been much better, even great.It all comes down to money I guess.  Authors and publishers want to make money selling the film rights, and movie studios want to translate that investment into ticket sales and DVD rentals (or whatever the equivalent is for streaming) as quickly as possible.  It does take someone with deep pockets, vision, stubbornness and perhaps just their own movie studio, to pay adequate homage to a longer book that is relatively complex.  It's seldom done, and so we end up with very mediocre stuff like this film, which is ok for a family movie night, but probably never watched afterwards.  It pales so much in comparison to the book.  If you are watching this with your kids, I would highly recommend reading the book to them or have them read it, because it has so much more depth than this mere shell of a movie...",2,"For those

654147,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,B00005JPNY,Mad Max,"[8, 11]","This was the best fantasy movie to come along in years. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of the fantasy genre, but I found the movie incredibly enjoyable for the ""thinking"" person, and I'm now finding the books equally enjoyable.To the avid fans who complain about the adaptation - I would point out that the objective of a movie is not the same as the objective of a book. Of course some of the complexities and characters have to be changed a bit, or else you'd have a 10-hour movie. Give it a break - this was a decent adaptation, and for those who don't want to read the books, the movie stands on its own.And to the fundamentalists who complain about the ""demons"" in the movie...get an education. The concept of the Dmonic was actually popularized by a Christian psychologist, Rollo May, in a book that was inspired by Paul Tillich.Also, before seeing the movie, I heard a lot about it being an ""atheist"" version of Narnia - it is nothing like Narnia, and the cosmology presented here, though complex, is a form of gnosticism, an early (possibly the earliest) form of Christianity. Get a brain, people. Everything outside your extremely narrow brand of right-wing theology is not ""atheism"" - there are a huge variety of spiritualities, consciousness movements, humanistic and transcendental belief systems, gnosticisms and agnosticisms, etc., which hold themselves to much higher moral standards than your fundamentalism.I actually liked this better than most of the Harry Potter movies, and much better than Narnia or Lord of the Rings. For a movie with a fraction of the budget, this was incredible. The acting was superb, the special effects were superb, and this movie actually had something to say (if you pay attention and listen).

654150,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B00005JPNY,Marc Cabir Davis,"[18, 33]","Learning that ""The Golden Compass"" won the Oscar for Best Special Effects in 2008 should push the makers to produce its' sequels. As a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy story-telling, this was one book-to-movie adaptation I had waited for, and this was one rare instance where I found the film excelling the book in certain aspects.One of the prime reasons I liked the book was because of its new take on Christianity and the Catholic Church in general. It didn't really say anything new, but the fact that a 'childrens' book could even address such topics was of course controversial to a certain degree. That said, the film does away with explicit reference to the Church, though everyone acts and behaves in a manner suited to the old guard of the Catholic Church. Believe me, the religious subtext in this movie is quite subtle - but if you pick up on certain lines and bits of dialogue, they did manage to slide a lot in here that I'm glad censors didn't pick up on it. For this alone, it breaks new ground.Second, I am probably the only person around who doesn't think too highly of both the 'Harry Potter' and 'The Lord of the Rings' movie franchises. I never particularly cared for LOTR as a book, and the film versions seemed overwrought and way too pretentious for their own good. But thats just me. ""The Golden Compass"" is far superior to both those book series, in my opinion, and in a movie it soars past both of them. THIS is what a fantasy film should look like - challenging situations, amazing use of CGI (most of which was created by an obscure design firm in Mumbai, India of all places) and a spectacular acting job by the young leads.The concept of a 'daemon' (pronounced 'demon') was always interesting to me from the start - but the wondrous use of imagery elevates this concept to a whole new level here - it really is something you've never seen on the screen before. Nicole Kidman's daemon is a golden monkey - one of the more luminous creatures in this film - and she is caught in a battle of love and hate with it.The young actress who plays the lead should be especially commended. In her scenes as conniving wench who acts as instigator between the two great polar bears, she is superb. Eva Green plays a witch who believes in eternal love, and this beautiful French actress should have been given more screen time. However, its in its' scenes with Nicole Kidman that give this movie an edge of fear and suspense - she plays it straight, with no emotion in her eyes except calculation and scheming - and her scenes crackle with intensity.""The Golden Compass"" is a big-screen movie, but no doubt it rightfully will find a place in your DVD library. It definitely deserves to. As an adult, the film spoke to me of so many mature, adult themes, leading me to believe that Pullman wrote these books with the world at large as his audience, not just children. In fact, the thought that your daemon can change its' shape repeatedly when you're young, but settles down into one form as you grow older - is a direct confirmation of social conditioning and personal self-worth and identification. The film challenges religious beliefs, but doesn't condemn religion. If you're worried about anti-Christian sentiments here, don't worry. Your children won't pick up on any of it - but they might come back to you with lots of questions. In my book, a great thing.Films like this are one in a million.

I'm a complete atheist; but was raised by hardcore religious fanatics so I have to say I love anything that artfully attacks god and religion.That being said - the books were great - they weren't really anti-theological so much as anti-Christian; but in fact what it did was bring the Christian religion into the realm of fiction where it belongs; brilliant.The movie; though - was just, just terrible. Amazingly terrible. All of the interesting little nuances were leaving not so much a skeleton of a plot but rather assorted parts of a skeleton such as a femur, left shin, spine and foot all duct taped together incoherently.Couple of examples - after diverting from the sequence of events in the book - using a thin bridge of ice over a huge, yawning canyon to separate two characters in order to 'merge' back into the original story. (i.e. the ice breaks after the first character (the one who belongs in the next scene) crosses) Give me a break.Another example - when Nicole K (forget characters name) just RANDOMLY out of no where with no supporting conversation tells Lyra about the bear king's obsession. It's like - insulting the audience by making so, so sure that you are aware of this piece of information so you can see how smart Lyra is for making use of it later. It's a kids movie, not a developmentally disabled kids movie.The one cool thing was the daemon's transformations; as far as effects went.For character design - Iorek sucked; the uncle guy sucked (better if they had the magesterium leader guy play him (sauron)) . What was up with the bears armor? It's supposed to be utilitarian not all flowery and weird and crap (Iorek's) - actually Iofurs armor seems less ornate by comparison which is the opposite of the point.Oh yeah - and the balloon guys jackrabbit was frickin' cool. He wasn't a bad character choice either...Anyways - don't see this movie unless you are lame in which case you will probably like it. Read the books, though.

654155,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00005JPNY,Mel Odom,"[9, 17]","I'd tried to read THE GOLDEN COMPASS by Philip Pullman at an earlier date on the recommendation of a friend.  I just couldn't hammer my way through it.  The prose seemed too dense, or the pacing was too slow, or there were too many things coming at me at one time.  Whichever it was, I put the book aside.I never found out that one of the characters was an armored polar bear that was a king who'd been kicked from the throne.  I didn't find that out till the trailers started airing.Then, while in San Diego at ComicCon, I ran across the huge display they had up for the movie.  I gawped.  I don't often get to write that word, but it's the only one that fits when you turn a corner and run into a gigantic polar bear nose-to-nose.So I was a tad more curious.  Then my 10 year old started seeing the trailers and I found out what the polar bear was all about.  And we saw the trailers in the theater.  I was blown away.  The hook had been set and my appetite thoroughly whetted.A few days before I went to see the movie, I heard there was an anti-Christian theme tied to it and a lot of people were going to boycott the film.  I was really curious at that point.  I'd expected a lot of fallout over THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, but people seemed to be okay with that.Anyway, I tend to make up my own mind about such things.  So I went.I had a blast.  So did my son.  And I didn't see any anti-Christian themes in the movie.  Sure, the Church was kind of represented as the bad guy, but only if you think that was your church.  Dan Brown did a lot of church-bashing in his book, THE DA VINCI CODE, which was way more edgy in my opinion.I chucked any theological assumptions at the door and just enjoyed the computer-generated imagery, fantastic characters brought to life by exactly the right mix of actors and actresses, and had a grand adventure in a world that was brilliantly different than my own.Dakota Blue Richards was absolutely marvelous as Lyra.  Ian McKellen provided the perfect bear's voice for Prince Iorek Byrnison.  Sam Elliott (one of my absolute favorites) played Texas aeronaut Lee Scoresby.  And Nicole Kidman was marvelous as the villainess, Mrs. Coulter.  Daniel Craig breezed through his role as Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel.  Serafina Pekkala portrays the winsome witch queen with proper regal ease.The movie is a road trip, more or less, and Lyra ends up moving from one obstacle to the next perilous path at a constant pace.  Even though the movie is two hours long, I felt like I'd just sat down when it was time to get up and go.In addition to providing an adventurous and headlong story, THE GOLDEN COMPASS also provides a visual feast for the eyes.  The city is stunning in all its detail and beauty.  The mix of Victorian pageantry mixed with steam-punk was outstanding, and there was hardly a scene shot that didn't include some impossible or imaginative thing in the background.The battle at the end of the movie felt like it had a cast of thousands, yet everything that transpired was carefully choreographed.  I watched from the edge of my seat as the events that had been set into motion had played out.  By the time the movie was over, I felt wrung out.I can't say that anyone involved in the movie had ulterior motives for what they did.  What I can say is that THE GOLDEN COMPASS is one of the best fantasy films I've seen all year.  I think it's perfectly suitable for the whole family.Now my son and I are going to have to read the books.  We want to know EVERYTHING that happens, and we don't want to have to wait two years for the next movie.",5,Magnificent Fantasy Epic,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,3593,"[""'d"", 'tried', 'read', 'THE', 'GOLDEN', 'COMPASS', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'earlier', 'date', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'hammer', 'way', 'prose', 'seemed', 'too', 'dense', 'pacing', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'coming', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'put', 'book', 'aside.I', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'one', 'characters', 'was', 'armored', 'polar', 'bear', 'was', 'king', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'kicked', 'throne', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'trailers', 'started', 'airing.Then', 'San', 'Diego', 'ComicCon', 'ran', 'huge', 'display', 'had', 'up', 'movie', 'gawped', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'write', 'word', 'only', 'one', 'when', 'turn', 'corner', 'run', 'gigantic', 'polar', 'nose-to-nose.So', 'was', 'tad', 'more', 'curious', 'Then', '10', 'year', 'old', 'started', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'polar', 'bear', 'was', 'saw', 'trailers', 'theater', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'hook', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'appetite', 'thoroughly', 'whetted.A', 'few', 'days', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'heard', 'was', 'anti-Christian', 'theme', 'tied', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'going', 'boycott', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'curious', 'point', ""'d"", 'expected', 'lot', 'fallout', 'LION', 'THE', 'WITCH', 'AND', 'THE', 'WARDROBE', 'people', 'seemed', 'be', 'okay', 'that.Anyway', 'tend', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'such', 'things', 'So', 'went.I', 'had', 'blast', 'So', 'did', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anti-Christian', 'themes', 'movie', 'Sure', 'Church', 'was', 'kind', 'represented', 'bad', 'guy', 'only', 'think', 'was', 'church', 'Dan', 'Brown', 'did', 'lot', 'church-bashing', 'book', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'edgy', 'opinion.I', 'chucked', 'theological', 'assumptions', 'door', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'computer-generated', 'imagery', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'exactly', 'right', 'mix', 'actors', 'actresses', 'had', 'grand', 'adventure', 'world', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'different', 'own.Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'was', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'Lyra', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'provided', 'perfect', 'bear', 'voice', 'Prince', 'Iorek', 'Byrnison', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'played', 'Texas', 'Lee', 'Scoresby', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'marvelous', 'villainess', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'breezed', 'role', 'Lyra', 'uncle', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Serafina', 'Pekkala', 'winsome', 'witch', 'queen', 'proper', 'regal', 'ease.The', 'movie', 'road', 'trip', 'more', 'less', 'Lyra', 'up', 'moving', 'one', 'obstacle', 'next', 'perilous', 'path', 'constant', 'pace', 'Even', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'felt', ""'d"", 'just', 'sat', 'down', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'get', 'up', 'go.In', 'addition', 'providing', 'adventurous', 'headlong', 'story', 'THE', 'GOLDEN', 'COMPASS', 'also', 'visual', 'feast', 'eyes', 'city', 'stunning', 'detail', 'beauty', 'mix', 'Victorian', 'pageantry', 'mixed', 'steam-punk', 'was', 'outstanding', 'there', 'was', 'hardly', 'scene', 'shot', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'impossible', 'imaginative', 'thing', 'background.The', 'battle', 'end', 'movie', 'felt', 'had', 'cast', 'thousands', 'yet', 'everything', 'transpired', 'was', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'watched', 'edge', 'seat', 'events', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'motion', 'had', 'played', 'out', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'wrung', 'out.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anyone', 'involved', 'movie', 'had', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'what', 'did', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'THE', 'GOLDEN', 'COMPASS', 'one', 'best', 'fantasy', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'think', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family.Now', 'son', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'want', 'know', 'EVERYTHING', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'wait', 'two', 'years', 'next', 'movie']",The Golden Compass

She lives at a college, and one day Ms. Coulter (Kidman) is there attending a meeting.  Ms. Coulter picks Lyra to take a trip with her up north.  Although excited to see the ice bears, she is reluctant to leave when her best friend Rober (Walker) is taken away by the Gobblers, a mysterious group of people stealing children.  Before she leaves, the Master of Jordan College gives her an alethiometer.  She is told it will reveal the truth of things to her, but she must not tell Ms. Coulter about it.  When life with Ms. Coulter turns out to not be not what she expected, she runs away to look for her friend Roger.  Lyra though, may be the child of the witches' prophecy, and destined for greater things.There is more to ""The Golden Compass"" than this, and it all moves pretty fast.  In fact, the film could have used an extra 15-20 minutes of running time to feel less rushed.  Religious undertones from the novel have all been removed, and it will be interesting to see how they continue to pull this off if the final two films in the trilogy get made.  Richards is good as Lyra,  bringing her sassiness and enthusiasm from page to screen successfully.  Kidman is perfect as the evil Ms. Coulter.  Craig has limited screen time but gets the job done as well.  Aside from the running time, the other problem is the lack of an ending.  The end was chopped off to give it a happier ending, and presumably the footage will show up in the next film if it gets made.  Without it though, the film feels a bit incomplete.

654158,A2J3M7FDSP185H,B00005JPNY,Mike,"[1, 5]","I didn't want to be confused by learning what this movie was about by first reading other people's reviews. This movie is a combination of The Wizard of Oz; Narnia, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; Invaders From Mars, and perhaps bits and pieces of others.The Magisterium is a group that wants to kidnap kiddies (and presumably everyone and anyone else), so as to make them have unquestioned obedience and become one of THEM. Our heroine Lyra is perhaps the only one who can keep the Magesteriun from conquering the world. She is given a Golden Compass, but she can use it only if she is THE CHOSEN ONE. (Where have we heard that before?)Speaking of the golden compass itself, it seems the further the movie goes along everybody-- the good guys, the bad guys, and everybody else in between-- loses interest and gets apathetic about the golden compass. Toward the end everybody knows she has the golden compass. A number of the evil adults could've just manhandled our heroine Lyra and grabbed it from her, but they treat it like it is just a mildly amusing topic of conversation-- such as, ""Did you ride your bike today?"" or, ""Did you hug your dolly today?""There are a bunch of witches flying about, and one of them-- a beautiful woman whose name escapes me-- occasionally lands and talks with Lyra. But nobody seems to know if these witches are from the East or from the West. At one point Dorthy-- er, I mean Lyra-- asks the big ol' bear if they are good witches or bad witches, and even the big ol' bear says he doesn't know.Then we come to Nicole Kidman. I wish she could've dressed a little more sexy-- like a strapless & backless cocktail dress, with maybe slits up each side, but she dresses more conservatively than I would've liked.I read reviews in the paper where it was said that Nicole Kidman was largely absent in the movie, but I think she shows up about as much and as often as any of the other adults.At one point in the movie we get a fight to the finish between two big ol' bears for the right to be called Papa Bear of the North. There is a nice scene or two that leads up to it, such as when our just kidnapped Lyra finds herself presented to the bad ol' bear, and she engages in a verbal duel with it about how she would be more valuable to him alive than dead. It's the sort of thing James Bond would do if he were to suddenly find himself prisoner in front of his arch enemy. Okay, so the two bears have their fight, and the good one wins; and the bear army stands up on its hind legs, lift their heads up, and they all go, ""Yaoooooooo...!"" And then everybody seems to forget about the bear army.One thing I really liked about the movie is the fantastic photography, and I don't just mean the special effects. Just the little scenes where people are alone in an office are masterpieces of photography. This movie was one of those rare gems where it was done a little better than it had to be in a number of places. Movies like that are always a pleasant surprise for me.Except I didn't like the battle scene at the end of the movie, which takes place at midnight in the snow. I think it is unethical for a movie to skimp on the budget by making the battle scenes take place in the middle of the night.All in all it wasn't such a bad movie, and the movie is a fun movie to write a review about. But, in the sequel we really need Nicole Kidman to dress a little more sexy. It may be out of character and incomprehensible for Nicole to be dressed up as if she's ready for cocktails, or as if she's ready for her next photo shoot, but the movie is already incomprehensible, and some of us bigger boys could use a little something extra to occupy our minds as we sit through The Golden Compass, II.",3,A Combination of Things,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,3723,"['did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'confused', 'learning', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'first', 'reading', 'other', 'people', 'reviews', 'movie', 'combination', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Narnia', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Invaders', 'Mars', 'perhaps', 'bits', 'pieces', 'others.The', 'Magisterium', 'group', 'kidnap', 'kiddies', 'presumably', 'everyone', 'anyone', 'else', 'so', 'make', 'have', 'unquestioned', 'obedience', 'become', 'one', 'THEM', 'heroine', 'Lyra', 'perhaps', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'Magesteriun', 'conquering', 'world', 'given', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'can', 'use', 'only', 'CHOSEN', 'ONE', 'Where', 'have', 'heard', 'Speaking', 'golden', 'compass', 'further', 'movie', 'everybody', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'everybody', 'else', 'interest', 'apathetic', 'golden', 'compass', 'end', 'everybody', 'golden', 'compass', 'number', 'evil', 'adults', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'manhandled', 'heroine', 'Lyra', 'grabbed', 'treat', 'just', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'topic', 'conversation', 'such', 'Did', 'ride', 'bike', 'today', 'Did', 'hug', 'dolly', 'today', 'are', 'bunch', 'witches', 'flying', 'one', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'name', 'occasionally', 'talks', 'Lyra', 'nobody', 'know', 'witches', 'are', 'East', 'West', 'one', 'point', 'Dorthy', 'er', 'mean', 'Lyra', 'big', 'ol', 'bear', 'are', 'good', 'witches', 'bad', 'witches', 'even', 'big', 'ol', 'bear', ""n't"", 'know.Then', 'come', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'dressed', 'little', 'more', 'sexy', 'strapless', 'backless', 'cocktail', 'dress', 'maybe', 'up', 'side', 'more', 'conservatively', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked.I', 'read', 'reviews', 'paper', 'where', 'was', 'said', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'largely', 'absent', 'movie', 'think', 'up', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'often', 'other', 'adults.At', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'get', 'fight', 'finish', 'two', 'big', 'ol', 'bears', 'right', 'be', 'called', 'Papa', 'Bear', 'North', 'nice', 'scene', 'two', 'up', 'such', 'when', 'just', 'kidnapped', 'Lyra', 'presented', 'bad', 'ol', 'bear', 'verbal', 'duel', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'valuable', 'alive', 'dead', 'sort', 'thing', 'James', 'Bond', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'suddenly', 'find', 'prisoner', 'front', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Okay', 'two', 'bears', 'have', 'fight', 'good', 'one', 'bear', 'army', 'up', 'hind', 'legs', 'lift', 'heads', 'up', 'go', 'Yaoooooooo', 'then', 'everybody', 'forget', 'bear', 'army.One', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'photography', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'special', 'effects', 'Just', 'little', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'alone', 'office', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'photography', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'gems', 'where', 'was', 'done', 'little', 'better', 'had', 'be', 'number', 'places', 'Movies', 'are', 'always', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'me.Except', 'did', ""n't"", 'battle', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'place', 'midnight', 'snow', 'think', 'unethical', 'movie', 'skimp', 'budget', 'making', 'battle', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'middle', 'night.All', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'movie', 'movie', 'fun', 'movie', 'write', 'review', 'sequel', 'really', 'need', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'dress', 'little', 'more', 'sexy', 'may', 'be', 'character', 'incomprehensible', 'Nicole', 'be', 'dressed', 'up', 'ready', 'cocktails', 'ready', 'next', 'photo', 'shoot', 'movie', 'already', 'incomprehensible', 'bigger', 'boys', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'something', 'extra', 'occupy', 'minds', 'sit', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'II']",The Golden Compass

It's been knocked for all the wrong reasons.  The most severe criticism, I think, is that the storytelling is rushed.  Chris Weitz (a salute to Chris) had so much to pack in, and he should have been allowed at least another twenty minutes to fill out the story and give the audience a few moments to breathe and just take in the marvelous invention of the production design and the variety of Pullman's imaginings.  The plus side wins, though.  Weitz firmly prevents the kind of shallow overacting that plagues fantasy epics; the characters, even the animated ones, feel like real people.  The casting is the best of any fantasy film since The Wizard of Oz.  Really.  Kidman, who has been getting dumped on for bad choices lately, brings something to Mrs Coulter not even present in the books: a note of piercing, authentic tragedy.  Dakota Blue Richards is a natural, and makes Lyra appealing in a way the sometimes tiresome Lyra of the books is not.  The CGI is superb, the most perfectly integrated dramatically of any yet seen (even the sainted LOTR).  I sincerely hope Wietz is allowed to film the rest of the series.***January 4, 2008: a few days after this film was released, David Germain of AP labeled it a flop.

Happy, because I think it was beautiful to look at and interesting.  Angry, because I know that since it didn't make any money, there won't be any more sequels to finish up the book series.  And also angry, because bowing to pressure from religious organizations, a lot of the book got cut out of this movie.  With said religious organizations probably being another reason the sequels were not made.Based off the of the book series, The Golden Compass covers most of the first book in the series by Philip Pullman.  Lyra, a young girl who is a ward of Jordan College has a pretty carefree life.  She studies, runs around with other young kids, and has fun with her Daemon.  Oh yeah, Daemons, this is an alternate universe, where every human being is accompanied by an animal spirit.  One that can change shapes until the human matures.  But everything isn't fine in Lyra's world.  Children have gone missing and the only thing they hear is about the mysterious Gobblers who take them.Characters:Dakota Blue Richard: Lyra BelacquaFreddie Highmore: PantalaimonNicole Kidman: Mrs. CoulterDaniel Craig: Lord AsrielSam Elliott: Lee ScoresbyIan McKellan: Iorek ByrnisonEva Green: Serafina PekkalaKathy Bates: HesterThis film has a heck of a cast.  Almost all of them are very well known.  But you know, Richard as Lyra outacted all of them.  She was great and had the right amount of arrogance and pride and bravery to really play Lyra to full effect.  I can't say I'd pictured Lyra any differently.  Kidman put in a solid role as Mrs. Coulter too.  Like sweet poison, she manages to be both abusive and loving at the same time.  Craig was barely in the movie, so I can't comment on him too much at all.  McKellan and Bates also played smaller roles.  And Pan, with his voice actor of Highmore, wasn't what I expected.  I realize they wanted to use a younger voice for him to make him the same age as Lyra, but I just didn't think the voice fit.This film didn't follow the book entirely.  There were a lot of differences, such as the order of some of the scenes, the demphasis on the Magisterium, and the ending.  And some of the background that let you know who these characters were was left out.  The pace was also rushed a bit more.  There was a lot of controversy surrounding this movie (and the book admittedly) because of its approach to religion.  However, the movie was much more mild than the book is and it shows.  All that controversy and ideas that make the book an eye-opener are noticeably missing in this movie.  And that's because it had a lot of opposition even before it came out.  Which I don't understand.  If you don't agree with it, why watch it?  It would be like me watching ""Prince of Egypt"" and hating it because of its thoughts on religion and demanding that it not be made rather than not watching it, or if having watched it, weighing it on its filmography, storyline and script (I actually did enjoy Prince of Egypt by the way).And you can't really deny that the special effects and animation in The Golden Compass are well done.  The way they show the Daemons, the colors, the Ice Bears, the witches.  Just everything is animated quite well.  It looks realistic but still magical at the same time.  And even the violence was a bit surreal.  There is an Ice Bear fight that can get kind of graphic, but it was a smaller part of the film as a whole.  The music in the film was, like most, instrumental, and was neither distracting or fantastic.  It was just there in the background where it didn't effect much.It's sad to know that we won't be seeing more of this series on film, at least not with the same actors (as they will have aged out).

If you like Sci-Fi / Fantasy then you will enjoy this.  If not, then probably not.  It's a shame that a sequel will not be made.  Also, I do not understand the fury over billing this as an anti religous movie.  Opponents tried to paint this as a picture (and book series) aimed at convincing children that religion is silly and bad and that all intelligent people should be atheists.  Perhaps I don't try hard enough to find messages in movies - I sit back and enjoy them - but the anti religion aspect on this movie seems like quite a reach.  This will no more corrupt your children than Harry Potter. Personally, I think the true hatred of this movie by religous supporters stems from the fact that the author of the series is a confirmed atheist and they don't want to see him succeed and / or gain any type of forum.  My belief is to each their own and I would have loved to see a sequel.  Although, I must say studios are generally bloodsuckers so I'm guessing they quashed a sequel not out of pressure from the Vatican or religous advocates but rather because they felt like it wouldn't be profitable.  I'm sure if they could make money from it, they would do it in a heartbeat.  To me there is some irony that the same parents who were duped into keeping their children away from this movie are the same parents who allow their children to worship all things Harry Potter much like my generation worshipped all things Star Wars!P.S. I grew up worshipping Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars and have enjoyed Harry Potter in the last decade.

Even films like the Lord of the Rings or the Harry Potter series don't really measure up to the original books they were based upon -- but in the case of those films, especially the Lord of the Rings series, the movies work on their own.  They establish their own world and it feels like a real world -- the characters seem to live there, and to understand it without constantly explaining it to each other.  In the case of the Golden Compass, unfortunately, that just isn't true.  Lyra explains things about their connection to her daemon Pan, and several characters give fairly long speeches explaining details to each other that they either would have known or that the filmmakers should have found more cinematic ways to make clear to the audience.So far this sounds like I'm griping, and maybe I am -- I had high expectations for this film, since the books are brilliant and have a very strong visual component.  In the hands of someone like Peter Jackson, this could have been an amazing film.  As it stands it is merely competent -- the actors were chosen very well for their parts, but the script makes their dialogue a bit wooden, with every character announcing who they are and explaining their history every time someone new shows up.  Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter and the young woman who plays Lyra are the only characters who are really given enough space to come across as real.  The daemons who are so central to the book feel more like sidekick pets than external manifestations of the living soul of the characters.On the other hand -- the film looks very good and for the most part the CGI components of the world mesh well with the realistic elements.

654170,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00005JPNY,Newton Ooi,"[1, 1]","This movie is based on a book, the first book of a trilogy.  I have never read any of these books, and have no intention to, so this review is purely of the movie itself, as a standalone piece of entertainment.First of, contrary to what some other reviews have suggested, there is minimal resemblance between this movie and the LOTR, Narnia, and Harry Potter movies of recent release.  Unlike LOTR, this movie is more intellectual and the conflicts more subtle and nuanced.  For example, the relationships between the protagonists and antagonists seem more complicated, with more twists and turns.  And instead of a focus on magic like in the Potter movies, this story rests on a background of other wordly technology.  The dress, speech and personal manners seem of Victorian time, yet some of the technology seem all too futuristic.  Probably the biggest difference between the Golden Compass and other recent fantasy tales is the former's use of females as the chief protagonist and antagonist.This movie features the most distinguished cast of actors and actresses of any fantasy movie with names such as Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Sam Elliot, Christopher Lee and Ian McKellen.  Only the main character is fairly unknown.  It seems this movie's producers decided to hire an all-star cast to help take some weight of the main actress.  Does it work?  Partly.  Kidman's character seems perfectly tailored for the actress's skills, while everyone else could have been replaced with unknowns and the film quality would have stayed the same.Probably the biggest failing of the movie was the soundtrack, or the lack of one.  The main song comes at the ending credits and is quite forgettable.  And there are no grand schemes anywhere thru the movie; though this is appropriate as there are no grand scenes anywhere thru the movie, which is probably the next biggest failing.  Every fantasy movie deserves a climax, that emotional peak to wow and exhaust the audience.  There is none in this movie.There are two aspects of this movie that is all too familiar for fans of fantasy movies.  First is the abundance of British accents; even the bear has a British accent.  Second is the characterization of dark-skinned people as evil.  The movie features two groups of ""bad guys"", Tartars and Samoyeds.  The former come across as ruthless mercenaries, and the latter come across as criminals; both sets are shown to be orientals.  Interesting that the only non-white characters in this movie are all bad guys.  The Gyptians, which are supposed to be ""good guys"" are all white.  They are modeled after gypsies of real life, even though many gypsies come from Southern and Eastern Europe, and often have darker skin hues.So overall, this movie is worth the two hours to watch on DVD; though not worth the price of a movie ticket.",3,Innovative in some respects; old fashioned in others,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,2833,"['movie', 'based', 'book', 'first', 'book', 'trilogy', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'have', 'intention', 'review', 'purely', 'movie', 'standalone', 'piece', 'entertainment.First', 'contrary', 'what', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'suggested', 'minimal', 'resemblance', 'movie', 'LOTR', 'Narnia', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'recent', 'release', 'LOTR', 'movie', 'more', 'intellectual', 'conflicts', 'more', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'example', 'relationships', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'seem', 'more', 'complicated', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'instead', 'focus', 'magic', 'Potter', 'movies', 'story', 'background', 'other', 'wordly', 'technology', 'dress', 'speech', 'personal', 'manners', 'seem', 'Victorian', 'time', 'technology', 'seem', 'too', 'futuristic', 'Probably', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'other', 'recent', 'fantasy', 'tales', 'former', 'use', 'females', 'chief', 'protagonist', 'antagonist.This', 'movie', 'most', 'distinguished', 'cast', 'actors', 'actresses', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'names', 'such', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Only', 'main', 'character', 'fairly', 'unknown', 'movie', 'producers', 'decided', 'hire', 'all-star', 'cast', 'help', 'take', 'weight', 'main', 'actress', 'work', 'Partly', 'Kidman', 'character', 'perfectly', 'tailored', 'actress', 'skills', 'everyone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'unknowns', 'film', 'quality', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'same.Probably', 'biggest', 'failing', 'movie', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'lack', 'one', 'main', 'song', 'ending', 'credits', 'quite', 'forgettable', 'are', 'grand', 'schemes', 'anywhere', 'thru', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'are', 'grand', 'scenes', 'anywhere', 'thru', 'movie', 'probably', 'next', 'biggest', 'failing', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'climax', 'emotional', 'peak', 'wow', 'exhaust', 'audience', 'none', 'are', 'two', 'aspects', 'movie', 'too', 'familiar', 'fans', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'First', 'abundance', 'British', 'accents', 'even', 'bear', 'British', 'accent', 'Second', 'characterization', 'dark-skinned', 'people', 'evil', 'movie', 'two', 'groups', 'bad', 'guys', 'Tartars', 'Samoyeds', 'former', 'come', 'ruthless', 'mercenaries', 'latter', 'come', 'criminals', 'sets', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'orientals', 'Interesting', 'only', 'non-white', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'Gyptians', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'white', 'are', 'modeled', 'gypsies', 'real', 'life', 'even', 'many', 'gypsies', 'come', 'Southern', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'often', 'have', 'darker', 'skin', 'hues.So', 'overall', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'watch', 'DVD', 'not', 'price', 'movie', 'ticket']",The Golden Compass

However in the movie they bring her to the polar bears (for no reason that is explained), an event which Iroek just happens to the know exactly where she is and starts running there without the help of the gypies.another major flaw of the movie is the lack of desperation in the characters.  in the book we see Lyra not only evolve, but express clear destress befitting a child in her position.  However in the movie she just kinda floats through the different events.  Also some scenes that i felt added to the danger level where omitted, like the finding of the separated daemons and the party at Miss Coulter's house.  These darker elements are completely wiped from the movie.yes, one must admit that the special effects were stunning, and they did capture the style of Lyra's world.  But that doesn't lessen the blow of watching a movie that can't in any respect hold a candle to the books.  even though one must except different elements, this movie is pretty disappointing nevertheless. too much was omitted with not enough added.i only recommed this movie to people who haven't read the book and even then not without much gusto.  ironically as always, this movie, as the book, does stick to the tradition of having a controversally existence.  the church still hate the book and thus still hate the movie due to the anti-theology message found in the books.  the fans of the book still love the book and thus still hate the movie due to the obvious plot holes and lack of real content.",2,a faint shadow of the real thing...,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,2888,"['just', 'want', 'something', 'off', 'bat', 'NOT', 'golden', 'compass', 'story', 'will', 'find', 'book', 'pretty', 'highly', 'flashy', 'children', 'fairy', 'tale', 'based', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'story', 'church', 'day', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'mention', 'church', 'review', 'something', 'completely', 'backwards', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'review', 'crucial', 'theological', 'comparation', 'movie', 'refused', 'add', 'element', 'director', 'states', 'will', 'continue', 'next', 'movies', 'i', 'only', 'wonder', 'horror', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'protrayed', '.the', 'characters', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'are', 'feeble', 'outline', 'true', 'form', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'knocking', 'actor', 'skills', 'i', 'think', 'were', 'actually', 'perfect', 'choices', 'included', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Lyra', 'i', 'have', 'series', 'problem', 'script.EVERYTHING', 'different', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'just', 'meaning', 'thought-provoking', 'conversations', 'were', 'omitted', 'were', 'be', 'excepted', 'i', 'am', 'refering', 'complete', 'jig-saw', 'puzzle', 'order', 'events', 'took', 'three', 'major', 'events', 'north', 'just', 'mixed', 'up', 'illogical', 'order', 'spoiler', 'example', 'gypsies', 'are', 'attacked', 'Lyra', 'brought', 'book', 'station', 'Bolvanger', 'logically', 'kids', 'are', 'valued', 'there', 'experimental', 'purposes', 'hunters', 'are', 'paid', 'return', 'However', 'movie', 'bring', 'polar', 'bears', 'reason', 'explained', 'event', 'Iroek', 'just', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'running', 'there', 'help', 'gypies.another', 'major', 'flaw', 'movie', 'lack', 'desperation', 'characters', 'book', 'see', 'Lyra', 'not', 'only', 'evolve', 'express', 'clear', 'destress', 'befitting', 'child', 'position', 'However', 'movie', 'just', 'kinda', 'floats', 'different', 'events', 'Also', 'scenes', 'i', 'felt', 'added', 'danger', 'level', 'where', 'omitted', 'finding', 'separated', 'daemons', 'party', 'Miss', 'Coulter', 'house', 'darker', 'elements', 'are', 'completely', 'wiped', 'movie.yes', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'stunning', 'did', 'capture', 'style', 'Lyra', 'world', ""n't"", 'lessen', 'blow', 'watching', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'respect', 'hold', 'candle', 'books', 'even', 'one', 'must', 'except', 'different', 'elements', 'movie', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'nevertheless', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'omitted', 'not', 'enough', 'only', 'recommed', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'even', 'then', 'not', 'much', 'gusto', 'ironically', 'always', 'movie', 'book', 'stick', 'tradition', 'having', 'controversally', 'existence', 'church', 'still', 'hate', 'book', 'thus', 'still', 'hate', 'movie', 'due', 'anti-theology', 'message', 'found', 'books', 'fans', 'book', 'still', 'love', 'book', 'thus', 'still', 'hate', 'movie', 'due', 'obvious', 'plot', 'holes', 'lack', 'real', 'content']",The Golden Compass

The  special effects are wonderful and the storytelling was great. I did have to watch it twice to understand most of it.

Nichole Kidman does a wonderful job as a villian, and it was very well thought out to not only capture adult's imagination but children's as well. The little girl who plays the title role does a excellant job as well. The Polar Bears, especially a particular fight scene involving them, add color to a sometimes slow movie.

654184,A2GFZT48YTZASN,B00005JPNY,Pavelow,"[0, 0]","I watched this movie with no memory or knowledge of the controversy surrounding its release.  Apparently both sides of the religion and free speech argument had plenty to say.  I'm not here to stir that pot.  Certainly the controversy precipitated a mediocre box office showing upon the film's release just before Christmas.  Yet, the box office intake quadrupled once it hit the international scene, garnering over $360 million.  Instead, I rented the DVD with only the knowledge that my wife and kids refused to watch.  No matter, there are plenty of films they have self banned to include the Harry Potter series, and I had nothing else to watch on a Sunday afternoon while they were at church.As the plot opens we are thrust into a fantasy world where our characters exist in a parallel universe.  Their souls exist in the form of different kinds of animals called daemons and walk side by side with their human hosts throughout their lives.  The kid's daemons can change shapes into different animals, but by the time they are adults the souls become one kind of animal.  Our main character Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is an orphan who is somewhat of a leader among her peers and challenges her friends, foes, and adults to get to the bottom of a mystery.  Her child friends are being kidnapped by the ""Gobblers"" and taken to a far away place in the north.  Her mission is to somehow find them and save them from whatever dark fate awaits them.  At the start of her journey we meet her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) who is trying to prove the existence of ""dust"" which he believes exists in a parallel universe and enters a person's body through their daemon.  Lord Asriel obtains funding from the College and proceeds north to prove his theory.  Mean time Lyra his taken away from the college by Mrs. Coulter (Nichol Kidman) under the story of being her assistant.  Lyra is a little wary of her new found supporter and before she leaves the college is given an alethiometer by the master of the college.  The alethiometer, also called the Golden Compass, is an ancient device banned by the Magesterium, the ruling religious party, because it can be used to find the answer to any question as long as the user is skilled in the interpretation of the device.  Confusing yet?  Lyra escapes her would-be supporter and captor and enlists the services of many adults to include the Gyptians, a head witch, a Texan aeronaut (Sam Eliot), and an outcast armored polar bear as she heads north to solve the mystery and rescue her friends.  The pace and sequence of this trek was at a minimum confusing and downright disjointed.  I found myself wondering who edited this thing because the transitions from one plot line to the next were as if something important was left on the cutting room floor.  For example, Lord Asriel is captured by some nasty tribes of the north and for nearly an hour of the flick we don't know his fate.  Then suddenly a narrator says basically he's OK because he bribed his captors....what?  The ending seemed absolutely abrupt, and apparently the original ending was deleted in order to bring it back as the start of a planned sequel.  On the good side however, the special effects were excellent and garnered an Academy Award.  The acting OK and predictable, especially the somewhat type cast antagonist Nichol Kidman and our rustic hero Sam Eliot.  I'm thinking kids could probably follow this better than I and would be thoroughly entertained.  We have a kid hero on a mission of mercy assisted by all her new found friends and she is the only one that can read the Golden Compass to keep everyone on track.  I probably won't be buying this one, but it is certainly worth a watch...that is unless you have religious reservations.",3,A little disjointed.,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,3758,"['watched', 'movie', 'memory', 'knowledge', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'release', 'Apparently', 'sides', 'religion', 'free', 'speech', 'argument', 'had', 'plenty', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'stir', 'pot', 'Certainly', 'controversy', 'precipitated', 'mediocre', 'box', 'office', 'showing', 'film', 'release', 'just', 'before', 'Christmas', 'box', 'office', 'intake', 'quadrupled', 'once', 'hit', 'international', 'scene', 'garnering', '360', 'million', 'Instead', 'rented', 'DVD', 'only', 'knowledge', 'wife', 'kids', 'refused', 'watch', 'matter', 'are', 'plenty', 'films', 'have', 'self', 'banned', 'include', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'were', 'church.As', 'plot', 'are', 'thrust', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'characters', 'exist', 'parallel', 'universe', 'souls', 'exist', 'form', 'different', 'kinds', 'animals', 'called', 'daemons', 'walk', 'side', 'side', 'human', 'hosts', 'lives', 'kid', 'daemons', 'can', 'change', 'shapes', 'different', 'animals', 'time', 'are', 'adults', 'souls', 'become', 'one', 'kind', 'animal', 'main', 'character', 'Lyra', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'orphan', 'who', 'somewhat', 'leader', 'peers', 'friends', 'foes', 'adults', 'get', 'bottom', 'mystery', 'child', 'friends', 'are', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'Gobblers', 'taken', 'far', 'away', 'place', 'north', 'mission', 'somehow', 'find', 'save', 'dark', 'fate', 'awaits', 'start', 'journey', 'meet', 'uncle', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'trying', 'prove', 'existence', 'dust', 'exists', 'parallel', 'universe', 'enters', 'person', 'body', 'daemon', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'funding', 'College', 'proceeds', 'north', 'prove', 'theory', 'Mean', 'time', 'Lyra', 'taken', 'away', 'college', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'Nichol', 'Kidman', 'story', 'being', 'assistant', 'Lyra', 'little', 'wary', 'new', 'found', 'supporter', 'college', 'given', 'alethiometer', 'master', 'college', 'alethiometer', 'also', 'called', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'ancient', 'device', 'banned', 'Magesterium', 'ruling', 'religious', 'party', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'find', 'answer', 'question', 'as', 'long', 'user', 'skilled', 'interpretation', 'device', 'Confusing', 'yet', 'Lyra', 'would-be', 'supporter', 'captor', 'services', 'many', 'adults', 'include', 'Gyptians', 'head', 'witch', 'Texan', 'aeronaut', 'Sam', 'Eliot', 'outcast', 'armored', 'polar', 'bear', 'north', 'solve', 'mystery', 'rescue', 'friends', 'pace', 'sequence', 'trek', 'was', 'minimum', 'confusing', 'downright', 'disjointed', 'found', 'wondering', 'who', 'edited', 'thing', 'transitions', 'one', 'plot', 'line', 'next', 'were', 'something', 'important', 'was', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'example', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'captured', 'nasty', 'tribes', 'north', 'nearly', 'hour', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fate', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'narrator', 'basically', 'OK', 'bribed', 'captors', '.what', 'ending', 'seemed', 'absolutely', 'abrupt', 'apparently', 'original', 'ending', 'was', 'deleted', 'order', 'bring', 'back', 'start', 'planned', 'sequel', 'good', 'side', 'however', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'excellent', 'garnered', 'Academy', 'Award', 'acting', 'OK', 'predictable', 'especially', 'somewhat', 'type', 'cast', 'antagonist', 'Nichol', 'Kidman', 'rustic', 'hero', 'Sam', 'Eliot', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'kids', 'could', 'probably', 'follow', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'have', 'kid', 'hero', 'mission', 'mercy', 'assisted', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'keep', 'everyone', 'track', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'one', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watch', 'have', 'religious', 'reservations']",The Golden Compass

In the book you figure it out on your own and feel clever about it when you do so.This is the case for half the plot of the book. It is just told to you in synopsis form by a narrator and all of the joy of DISCOVERING things is taken from you.I don't know who the director is, but I intend to find out and avoid his future movies. Hopefully they hire him to finish out the series (doubtful, since this one was dismal at the box office) so he won't ruin any other movies for a while.In short, if you liked the book - and Golden Compass was a good book, even if you are an intolerant right wing person this book shouldn't have offended you, they don't start really offending the Catholics until book three in my opinion - then you will be disappointed by the movie.

I was expecting a cheesy kids movie, perhaps not unlike Narnia.What I got was a good story with fantastic special effects throughout and a whole lot more violence than I had anticipated.  I'm honestly surprised that they got away with a PG-13 rating.  No gore, but plenty of killings.All of the standard fantasy genre elements are there (strangely, this is why some people rated it poorly) -- you got your drunken warrior brought out of retirement to bring down a king and generally save the day; you got your evil-witch-type person, your good-witch-type person, your evil government workers, your easily fooled scholars and your mystical device that everyone wants in the hands of a girl.It's a winning formula and made for an enjoyable movie.

For one particularly important mission Lord Asriel heads to ""The North,"" and again Lyra is left behind. Her savior comes in the form of a woman, the Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who says she is about to travel to the North and could use an assistant. For safety on her voyage with Mrs. Coulter, Lyra is given a strange instrument and told to keep it a secret. The instrument is an Alethiometer and if you can read it, it always shows you the truth. With the help of the Alethiometer and some new friends she meets along the way, Lyra must find and save kidnapped children and then find her uncle.The movie is based on the world created by Philip Pullman in the His Dark Materials series, a three-book set with The Golden Compass being the first. While I have not read the books, I will assume that much of the movie was as it was in the books. For example, I will credit Pullman with the dmons -- in this parallel world a person's soul travels alongside the body, in animal form, rather than inside it. This was a wildly imaginative element to the story and one of those ""Why didn't I come up with that?"" ideas.I really like Daniel Craig, but he is not in the movie very long. You get the impression that he might get more on-screen time later in the story, but Lyra is our star. As Lyra, Dakota Blue Richards was everything she needed to be, when she need to be. She was stubborn, sassy, strong, and lots of other things that don't start with the letter S.I don't like Nicole Kidman. In almost every role she is sneaky, rude, cold and nasty. And that is exactly how she was in The Golden Compass, and I loved it. Mrs. Coulter is each and every one of those things.The animation for the movie was very well done. There were many parts of the movie where the animators could have made it look less animated, but they didn't. I think it added to the fantasy element of the story to keep it this way.The story moves pretty quickly. There is a lot of information packed into just one movie. Normally I would gripe about the lack of depth given to certain parts of the plot, but I am making an exception for The Golden Compass under the assumption that things will be explained in the next two installments of the series.It was PG-13 and the only reason I could see was for animated violence. Many people died, but there was little or no blood.You can call this a children's movie if you want, but I think it is time we re-evaluated that category.

It is as if the producers and ""writer/director"" found a diamond and were not smart enough to even recognize what they held in their hands, passing it back and forth until all they had were a few grains of shiny sand that no longer held value or even together.

Demons grow as the soul of their owners grows.  They are also the opposite sex of their human counterparts (i.e. girl would have a male demon and vice versa) and take animal form.  In the beggining young adults have spirit that is free and uncompromising; but the local ""ministry"" wants them to obey and conform unconditionally.  So this is a universal battle of good and evil in its psychological form.  There is also a metaphysical component of the movie where narrator mentions parallel universe and people form the parallel world that are connected by the universal ""dust"". I liked the fact that the main character of the film is a girl - that premise gives some hope to humanity of this little made up universe.  Also the visual effects are great.  Most ""demons"" are such fantastic animals full of personality and charm.  cast is definitely superior, but by the middle of the film - story starts to fade and becomes boring.

It's..."" A-list actors, ""The Golden Compass"" tells the tale of Lyra, an orphan girl living in a University in a version of Earth that's very different to our own. She's invited by the sinister Mrs. Coulter, an employee of the shadowy Magisterium, to accompany her on a mission to the North, where Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel is researching the mysterious properties of Dust (a mystical and feared substance). When Mrs. Coulter turns out to be something more than she first believed, Lyra escapes and goes on a quest to find her kidnapped friends, reinstate the king of the bears, free imprisoned children from the Magisterium's grasp and return the legendary truth-finding device known as the Alethiometer to her Uncle.So much for the basic plot. Performance-wise, Dakota Blue Richards is very good as Lyra, and Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (for the two-and-a-half seconds he's actually IN this movie), Eva Green and Sam Elliot do perfectly passable jobs in their roles. There's not much of a chance to really act, given the limitations of the script and editing, and so the supporting human roles, as well as those voice roles filled by the likes of Sir Ian McKellen and Kathy Bates, fall kind of flat.The script, for what it is, feels often like a mere explanation for the visual effects, as opposed to developing characterisation or furthering the story: it's not terribly memorable and contains nothing you'll not have seen before.The visuals are amazing, for the most part: top-drawer art and production design coupled with some gorgeous CGI make for some very compelling scenes - there are really only one or two points (Lyra riding on the back of Iorek Byrnison immediately springs to mind) where things look fake. The bottle-of-orange-soda effects when the Alethiometer is doing its thing do begin to grate after a while, though, and the Witches look just like every other Evanescence Emo-wannabe you'd love to smack with a broomstick. But, for the most part, ""The Golden Compass"" is a visual treat.The editing is really what lets ""The Golden Compass"" down: scenes jump from conflict to resolution at a disappointingly rapid pace, and there's absolutely no chance to develop a sense of connection with any one character because of the lack of time spent on any one situation. Also, the direction is infuriatingly pedestrian: in ""About A Boy"" Chris Weitz proved himself capable of more than silly little American Pie tragedies, but here, he seems to be out of his depth as the potential of Lyra's world and the stunning effects and art of ""The Golden Compass"" go largely unexploited.This is a very disappointing movie: if you've read the books then don't waste an evening in theatres watching this: a one-time DVD rental will be enough to satisfy your curiosity.

I had to give this film a pass when it first came out even though I wanted to see it. Life got in the way and many moons later I finally viewed the film on DVD, a rental to boot.I have to say, I'm not sure why this film has so many mixed reviews when I, my wife and college age daughters all loved it.Why? Because we did. We found the characters to be both complex and sympathetic. The story is very intriquing and well paced. I'm glad it was rated PG13 because it had a few rough spots (the polar bear warriors fighting was particularly savage). As I don't own this film (a problem I'll rectify soon) I have to forego with explicit descriptions and character's names since it has been a few weeks since we viewed the film. Despite that it left its mark on me. The young lady (Lyra?) was a treat. She was payed with just the right amount of precociousness and innocence as well as drive to make her the perfect foil for adults who disregard youth as simply precocious and naive. Her rescues, escapes and minor triumphs are all worthy of acclaim. Her friends (rescuers and defenders) may have their agendas but they also sincerely help her. The polar bear warrior king was (voiced by Ian McKellen) was perfect as her loyal protector with a history that needed to be resolved.I've read the complaints about this film and was prepared for the worst. It's too bad their noise prevailed in making this film so unpopular.Now, thanks to that rabble, I'll have to read the books to get to the finish of the tale. That's not so terrible but this franchise deserved better than it received at the box office. I'm sure the nay-sayers are delighted in their results.As for the complaints that this film (and the books?) impugned ""mother church"", well, I saw no such evidence to validate those claims.No surprise there.",4,Didn't read the book.... sorry,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,1894,"['never', 'heard', 'books', 'then', 'as', 'far', 'i', 'knew', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Potter', 'was', 'rage', 'had', 'give', 'film', 'pass', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'even', 'wanted', 'see', 'Life', 'got', 'way', 'many', 'moons', 'later', 'finally', 'viewed', 'film', 'DVD', 'rental', 'boot.I', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'when', 'wife', 'college', 'age', 'daughters', 'loved', 'it.Why', 'did', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'complex', 'sympathetic', 'story', 'very', 'intriquing', 'well', 'paced', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'rated', 'PG13', 'had', 'few', 'rough', 'spots', 'polar', 'bear', 'warriors', 'fighting', 'was', 'particularly', 'savage', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'film', 'problem', ""'ll"", 'rectify', 'soon', 'have', 'forego', 'explicit', 'descriptions', 'character', 'names', 'been', 'few', 'weeks', 'viewed', 'film', 'left', 'mark', 'young', 'lady', 'Lyra', 'was', 'treat', 'was', 'payed', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'precociousness', 'innocence', 'as', 'well', 'drive', 'make', 'perfect', 'foil', 'adults', 'who', 'disregard', 'youth', 'simply', 'precocious', 'naive', 'rescues', 'escapes', 'minor', 'triumphs', 'are', 'worthy', 'acclaim', 'friends', 'rescuers', 'defenders', 'may', 'have', 'agendas', 'also', 'sincerely', 'help', 'polar', 'bear', 'warrior', 'king', 'was', 'voiced', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'was', 'perfect', 'loyal', 'protector', 'history', 'needed', 'be', 'resolved.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'complaints', 'film', 'was', 'prepared', 'worst', 'too', 'bad', 'noise', 'prevailed', 'making', 'film', 'so', 'unpopular.Now', 'thanks', 'rabble', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'books', 'get', 'finish', 'tale', 'not', 'so', 'terrible', 'franchise', 'deserved', 'better', 'received', 'box', 'office', ""'m"", 'sure', 'nay-sayers', 'are', 'delighted', 'results.As', 'complaints', 'film', 'books', 'impugned', 'mother', 'church', 'well', 'saw', 'such', 'evidence', 'validate', 'claims.No', 'surprise', 'there']",The Golden Compass

654200,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B00005JPNY,R. Kyle,"[11, 19]","""Golden Compass'"" storyline is one that's a well-known favorite for fantasy readers.  It's both an adventure-quest and a coming of age tale for a young orphan. What makes the movie such a standout is the execution of the story both visually and sonically.""Golden Compass"" world is made up of a variety of life forms. Humans all have daemon bonded to them.  Daemons shapeshift at will while the child's soul is still developing and at some point in their maturity take a fixed animal shape. Witches have the gift of magic, plus the daemons bound to them do not have to remain as close as those bound to mere humans. Ice bears (polar bears) are one of the fiercest and strongest of the peoples and armored ones are often hired as bodyguards.In the beginning, orphaned Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) has no knowledge of her true parentage. She and her daemon, Pan, are currently the ward of her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig). She attends a boarding school, Jordan College.The story opens with Lord Asriel returning to Jordan College to advise the administration that he's found 'dust' in the Northern Country. 'Dust'is the constituent material of parallel worlds and Asriel believes he can travel between the worlds.  He's asking the College to fund his research.The Magisterium is a body that's attempting to regulate the world's magical gifts and keep them under control Their representative at the College opposes this research and tries to convince the academics not to sponsor it.  Failing at that, he poisons the wine Lord Asriel was to drink at his presentation.  Fortunately, Lyra was spying and she warned her Uncle before he could take that fateful sip.The college agrees to sponsor Lord Asriel's research and he's setting about on another mission to the North. Lyra asks to come, but he will not permit it. She is to remain safe at school. Needless to say, this edict doesn't sit well with the strong minded young woman.After Asriel has departed, Lyra is given the Alethiometer, a Golden Compass, which tells the truth--as long as the person using it knows how to both frame the questions posed and read the answers from the symbols around the compass'outer ring. She's told to keep the device a secret. At one time there were several such devices.  The Magisterium has them all now.Enter the lovely Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who Lyra first meets at a Jordan College dinner. Mrs. C. takes an immediate fancy to Lyra and offers her a chance to come along with her on a trip to the North to see the Ice Bears. Despite misgivings, the Headmaster releases Lyra into Mrs. C's care.Lyra quickly learns she has no freedom in Mrs. Coulter's house.  Worse, the Compass keeps displaying GOB, GOB, GOB....Almost too late, Lyra realizes that Mrs. Coulter is one of the Magisterium and a Gobbler to boot--the Gobblers are people who are kidnapping children, who are never seen again.Lyra and Pan escape. They're helped by a band of Gyptians (wanderers) who get them to Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliot) who is willing to help her if she can get his ship out of hock and help his friend Iorek Byrnison (voice: Ian McKellen) armored ice bear.The rest of the story is for you to see, but it's very worth the price and the lines at the theatres this time of year.""Compass"" is one of the most beautifully filmed fantasies since LOTR.  The cast was very well chosen.  I was impressed with Ms. Blue's debut and am hoping to see her in future films.  Voice-overs were perfect for their respective characters and the music was also lovely.I would not want to miss this show at the theaters.

654201,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPNY,RMurray847,"[16, 21]","I have never read any of the books, so I entered the film with very little in the way of an expectation of what the plot would be.  Obviously I had seen the movie trailers, so I knew this was probably something in the NARNIA, ERAGON, perhaps even LORD OF THE RINGS vein.First of all, it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that this movie is in same category as LOTR.  Those films dared to take their time to tell a story, stretching to epic length.  They developed characters we truly cared about.  And much of the films actually took place in real landscapes.  Think of all the breathtaking New Zealand locations that were used.GOLDEN COMPASS is almost totally located in a CGI world.  Not for one second does it feel solid or tangible.  It's all very pretty to look at, but honestly it just feels a bit cold.  NARNIA was the same way...it needed some sets that were REAL.In addition, COMPASS zooms through its story, taking virtually no time to establish characters beyond simple archetypes.  For instance, think of the character Sam Elliott plays.  He's an ""aeronaut,"" basically a pilot for hire (except he flies a motorized hot-air balloon concoction).  Basically, his character is that same guy that Sam Elliott always plays...twinkly eyes, big mustache, grizzled look.  That's it.  We like him, because we always like Sam Elliott.Anyway, I haven't touched on the plot, which is what has gotten so many people in an uproar, apparently.  The story takes place in a ""parallel"" world, where people's souls live on the outside of them, are called ""daemons"" and take the shape of an animal of some sort.  This is a neat idea...and allows for some of the more fanciful special effects, as we get to see each animal that is attached to a person.  (For children, their ""daemons"" aren't settled yet, so the animal form will change.)  In this world, things seem to be run primarily by The Magesterium...a powerful group of what seems like semi-fascist folks who are against ""free will.""It's my understanding that in the books, this Magesterium is clearly a reference to the catholic church.  That may be, but in the movie, it feels like a generic ""big brother"" type of organization.  Their goal seems to be to figure out how to separate children from their ""daemons"" so that they are left ""soulless"" or at least without the gumption to resist the Magesterium.  There seems to be any little real logic to any of this...we just have to accept it.The young girl Lyra is entrusted with The Golden Compass, a device that ""sees what is hidden.""  Naturally, the Magesterium are eager to get this from her, and to thwart her, they send Nicolle Kidman as a charismatic, glamorous woman of means to entice the girl to serve as her assistant.  Lyra learns fairly soon not to trust this woman, and suddenly she sets out on a quest to free the children who've been kidnapped so that their souls can be stolen.I'm guessing my plot summary is a bit confusing...and frankly, trying to sort all the tangents, politics, allegiances, etc. is tricky, and ultimately not very interesting.  Mostly you just end up watching the movie in order to see all the spectacular scenes.  Are there are some.  The Ice Bears are impressive creations, and the big duel between a couple of them is a highpoint.  Daniel Craig, as Lyra's uncle, has a brief but exciting chase scene out on the frozen tundra.So the special effects ARE pretty special, for the most part.  (Although I say again, I missed the tangibility of REAL landscapes.)  But the script is trying to pack in too much in short span of time.  The actors are more or less lost in the shuffle.  Kidman looks the part, and she's always been good at playing cold, insincere parts.  Craig has nothing to do, but his eyes look great.  The young lady who plays Lyra is pretty game and well cast.  But no one is going to win an Oscar for this film.  Costumes and makeup do most of the acting.Even though the film runs just under two hours, I frankly found myself bored at times.  Ironically, I think that if the movie had been longer and taken the time to make us care about the character and to delineate what was at stake a bit better, I would have been more engaged.

the facts,no one needs to be running off willy-nilly tilting at windmills.The story here involves a parallel world to ours where ""dust""(the stuff of life) connects everyone and everything in the universe.Lyra Belacqua(Dakota Richards)is an 11 year old whose ""Uncle"" Asriel(Daniel Craig)is a professor at a university who has discovered what he believes is the secret to this ""dust"" and mounts an expedition to the far north to prove it.However the Magisterium(the ruling body)wants him stopped as it would mean an end to their power and influence.During his trip he is captured and Lyra,befriended by Mrs Coulter(agent for the Magisterium)starts on her journey not only to rescue him but many friends and other young people who are mysteriously disappearing;courtesy of the Gobblers, the agents of the Magisterium.The head of her school(and friend to Asriel)gives her an Elithiometer(Golden Compass)which reveals the reality of any notion or event of the users wishes;the only one known to exist.When Mrs.Coulters' real and assumed purpose in ""helping"" Lyra becomes clear,Lyra escapes.During this time a group of water-faring nomads called the Egyptians step in and rescue her and assist her on her journey north.Along the way she enlists the help an aeronaut by the name of Mr Scoresby(Sam Elliot) and a polar bear in exile by the name of Iorek Byrnison(voiced by Ian Mckellin).Also a representative of the witch clan,Serafina Pekkala(Eva Green),joins in the quest.Iorek becomes invaluable to Lyra who in turn helps him re-unite with his polar bear brothers and claim his rightful place as king.After this she infiltrates the Bolvingar prison where all the children have been taken in order to seperate their bodies from their souls.A gigantic battle ensues near the end of the film with Lyra and her compatriots winning the day.The battle is not yet over though and as the movie ends she,a friend and Iorek sail away in Mr Scoresbys' air machine to continue their quest.The movies' special effects are seamless in this film and constitute a big part of its' charm.Things like the retro but futuristic vehicles(both ground and air),the myriad of different animals that appear which contain people's souls and that constantly walk,crawl and/or fly beside them and most especially Iorek the bear that comes to astounding but believable life and who is an integral part of this film.All in all amazing to behold.This set contains two discs and the first contains the film.Beautifully transferred with its original 2:35:1 aspect ratio and surround 5:1 sound.The second disc is chock full of specials including featurettes on Phillips the author,director Chris Weitz's screenplay,the character of Lyra,costumes,music,production design,a behind the scenes look at the films'opening in Cannes and promo tour,a closer look at the bears,the golden compass itself,daemons(the name for the animals that human souls inhabit),and many others.In conclusion this a film for the family(for children of about 10 and up) to enjoy and savour.Its' storyline is lush and it grabs you almost from the outset.It is a time honoured good versus evil film done in a most imaginative way,with Lyra,Prof.Azriel,Iorek,Mr.Scoresby,et al on one side and the Magisterium,the Gobblers,its' rep Mrs Coulter and all their assorted henchmen on the other.The acting is top notch by everyone involved and the special effects are fabulous and bring to life one of its' chief and most beloved characters,Iorek the polar bear.This is definitely one that belongs on everyone's shelf.",5,An enchanting and a golden gem of a film!,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,4718,"['review', 'have', 'deferred', 'about', 'two', 'years', 'let', 'initial', 'controversies', 'surrounding',

654203,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JPNY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","The Golden Compass (Chris Weitz, 2007)I am very much in love with His Dark Materials, the Phil Pullman trilogy from which this film gets its sensibility. I tried not to let that affect my judgment while watching this, and I knew going in that no filmmaker would be able to replicate the brilliance of the books. But, even before the movie came out, I knew we were in trouble; Chris Weitz (American Pie) was slated to write and direct. You want to tell me this guy can do Pullman justice? Then came the reports, in 2004, that Weitz was taking some liberties with the script (those who've both read the books and seen the movie are all too well aware of those). How good could it be? I got the expected answer: nowhere near good enough.Dakota Blue Richards stars as Lyra Belacqua, the girl around whom everything in the books turns. Her character is the second most notable thing toned down; many of the book's critics rightly point out that Lyra is a shrill, almost harridan-like character in the first book, while the intention here seems to have been to make her cuddly, likable, and full of wonder. Which kind of makes the whole character-development-through-growth-and-change thing null and void (and, as we all know, one of the main rules of writing is that your main character must somehow change). As well, the good guys and the bad guys have been desperately simplified here, and yet paradoxically made somewhat less monstrous/heroic than in the books; I'm still trying to figure out how that happened. The cast (with Daniel Craig as the main good guy and Nicole Kidman as the winter queen-like Mrs. Coulter), however, does the best with what they've got, and a number of the performances are quite good, if you can divorce them from the source material. The special effects are, of course, stunning. As we learned from the horrible adaptations of Eragon and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, Hollywood seems to think they can come up with another Lord of the Rings (in terms of box office receipts) as long as they keep the cutting-edge effects coming. They neglected to note Jackson's attention to the character depth and development in his seemingly legendary adaptations of Tolkein.Do yourself a favor and see the movie before reading the books. That way you won't know what you're missing (and many of the plot holes will not show up for you, though you will probably wonder why as character like Serafina Pekkala-- who should be a major character-- just kind of pops up now and again, then disappears), and you can go back later, read the book, and actually understand what it was Pullman was on about. **",2,Destroyed the book's integrity over and over again.,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,2623,"['Golden', 'Compass', 'Chris', 'Weitz', '2007', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'Phil', 'Pullman', 'trilogy', 'film', 'sensibility', 'tried', 'not', 'let', 'affect', 'judgment', 'watching', 'knew', 'going', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'replicate', 'brilliance', 'books', 'even', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'knew', 'were', 'trouble', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'American', 'Pie', 'was', 'slated', 'write', 'direct', 'want', 'tell', 'guy', 'can', 'do', 'Pullman', 'justice', 'Then', 'came', 'reports', '2004', 'Weitz', 'was', 'taking', 'liberties', 'script', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'well', 'aware', 'How', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'got', 'expected', 'answer', 'nowhere', 'good', 'enough.Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'Lyra', 'Belacqua', 'girl', 'whom', 'everything', 'books', 'character', 'second', 'most', 'notable', 'thing', 'toned', 'down', 'many', 'book', 'critics', 'rightly', 'point', 'out', 'Lyra', 'shrill', 'almost', 'harridan-like', 'character', 'first', 'book', 'intention', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'cuddly', 'likable', 'full', 'wonder', 'Which', 'kind', 'whole', 'character-development-through-growth-and-change', 'thing', 'null', 'void', 'know', 'one', 'main', 'rules', 'writing', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'somehow', 'change', 'well', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'been', 'desperately', 'simplified', 'here', 'yet', 'paradoxically', 'made', 'somewhat', 'less', 'monstrous/heroic', 'books', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'happened', 'cast', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'main', 'good', 'guy', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'winter', 'queen-like', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'however', 'best', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'number', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'can', 'divorce', 'source', 'material', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'course', 'stunning', 'learned', 'horrible', 'adaptations', 'Eragon', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'terms', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'as', 'long', 'keep', 'cutting-edge', 'effects', 'coming', 'neglected', 'note', 'Jackson', 'attention', 'character', 'depth', 'development', 'seemingly', 'legendary', 'adaptations', 'Tolkein.Do', 'favor', 'see', 'movie', 'reading', 'books', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'will', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'will', 'probably', 'wonder', 'why', 'character', 'Serafina', 'Pekkala', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'major', 'character', 'just', 'kind', 'pops', 'up', 'now', 'again', 'then', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'later', 'read', 'book', 'actually', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'Pullman', 'was', '**']",The Golden Compass
654204,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPNY,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2Based on the novel by Philip Pullman (the first of a trilogy), ""The Golden Compass"" takes us to a parallel universe where humans mind-meld with shape-shifting creatures known as daemons, children are kidnapped and ""re-programmed"" to live without those daemons, and society is ruled by a mysterious, all-powerful Magisterium that tells people what they are to think and how they are to live.  Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is a feisty young orphan whose uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is hot on the trail of a scientific discovery regarding the nature of the universe - a discovery that, if proven true, could completely upend the paradigm that allows the Magisterium to remain in power.  Naturally, Lyra is one of only a handful of very special people who possess the gift of unlocking the mystery of a golden compass said to hold the key to something or other of great importance (in all honesty, this type of mystical mumbo-jumbo is not exactly my cup of tea).  British and American acting stalwarts Ian McKellen, Tom Courtenay, Christopher Lee, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, and Nicole Kidman round out the cast.Much has been made of the supposed anti-religion/pro-science slant in the story (""magisterium"" is the term for the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church), and, indeed, Pullman, a renowned Freethinker, has admitted that he wrote his trilogy of fantasy novels (called, collectively, ""His Dark Materials"") partly as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis' ""Narnia"" series - though the Magisterium doesn`t seem to be any more objectionable as a literary device than the societal super-structures we find in ""Brave New World"" or ""1984"" or ""Fahrenheit 451,"" or countless other such tales (though I gather that the movie somewhat dilutes this aspect of the original story anyway).If truth be told, I really don`t have much use for films of this genre, but I will say that I find the movie version of ""The Golden Compass"" to be a bit more imaginative and a trifle less plodding than the recent cinematization of ""Chronicles of Narnia.""  Plus, ""Compass"" provides a sometimes breathtakingly beautiful vision of what life might be like on a parallel planet.  But, when all is said and done, it's still just the same old mishmash of talking animals, mythological creatures, precocious youngsters, fantasy battle sequences and over-worked allegory we`ve encountered oh so many times before.Stay tuned for the next installment.",2,a true mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2428,"['**1/2Based', 'novel', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'first', 'trilogy', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'humans', 'mind-meld', 'shape-shifting', 'creatures', 'known', 'daemons', 'children', 'are', 'kidnapped', 're-programmed', 'live', 'daemons', 'society', 'ruled', 'mysterious', 'all-powerful', 'Magisterium', 'people', 'what', 'are', 'think', 'how', 'are', 'live', 'Lyra', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'feisty', 'young', 'orphan', 'uncle', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'hot', 'trail', 'scientific', 'discovery', 'regarding', 'nature', 'universe', 'discovery', 'proven', 'true', 'could', 'completely', 'upend', 'paradigm', 'Magisterium', 'remain', 'power', 'Naturally', 'Lyra', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'very', 'special', 'people', 'who', 'possess', 'gift', 'unlocking', 'mystery', 'golden', 'compass', 'said', 'hold', 'key', 'something', 'other', 'great', 'importance', 'honesty', 'type', 'mystical', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'not', 'exactly', 'cup', 'tea', 'British', 'American', 'acting', 'stalwarts', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'round', 'out', 'cast.Much', 'been', 'made', 'supposed', 'anti-religion/pro-science', 'slant', 'story', 'magisterium', 'term', 'teaching', 'authority', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'indeed', 'Pullman', 'renowned', 'Freethinker', 'admitted', 'wrote', 'trilogy', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'called', 'collectively', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'partly', 'rebuttal', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Narnia', 'series', 'Magisterium', 'doesn', 't', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'objectionable', 'literary', 'device', 'societal', 'super-structures', 'find', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', '1984', 'Fahrenheit', '451', 'countless', 'other', 'such', 'tales', 'gather', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'aspect', 'original', 'story', 'anyway', '.If', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'really', 'don', 't', 'have', 'much', 'use', 'films', 'genre', 'will', 'say', 'find', 'movie', 'version', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'imaginative', 'trifle', 'less', 'plodding', 'recent', 'cinematization', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'Compass', 'sometimes', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'vision', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'parallel', 'planet', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'still', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'mishmash', 'talking', 'animals', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'precocious', 'youngsters', 'fantasy', 'battle', 'sequences', 'over-worked', 'allegory', 've', 'encountered', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'before.Stay', 'tuned', 'next', 'installment']",The Golden Compass
654205,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JPNY,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","In some (nearly) parallel universe, things are quite different.  Human beings walk alongside their ""demons"", almost tangible avatars of their souls.  The war between church and academia (irrational faith and enlightened reason) has virtually been lost to the ""Magisterium"", a workable stand-in for organized religion.  The only hope for freedom is an understanding of ""dust"", some quasi-cosmic substance that flows into humans through their demons.  The Magisterium sees Dust as a threat to their rule (if only because it's not found in their scriptures, and nothing that powerful can remain outside their control) and plans both covertly and in the open to cut man off from it.Lyra Belacqua, a precocious 12 year older living in some otherworldly version of Oxford, finds herself at the crossroads of this conflict.  Her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) mounts an expedition to the North where the Aurora Borealis reveals a cascade of Dust flowing to a man through his demon.  Marissa Coulter (Nicole Kidman in seduction-overdrive), an agent of The Magisterium, takes an extreme interest in Lyra and offers to take her on an expedition North.  Before leaving (and once Coulter's odiousness has clearly emerged from her charming demeanor) the master of her school gives her the last remaining Alethiometer - the Golden Compass - an instrument which she doesn't understand.  The master's commands are simple - keep it secret, keep it safe.  It is only after Coulter virtually imprisons Lyra in her London home (looking like Kensington, with carriages drawn by lightning instead of horses) that Lyra realizes that something is very wrong.  Snooping around, Lyra finds evidence linking Coulter with the systematic kidnapping of children (including at least one of her friends) and escapes with her Alethiometer.  Hooking up with Gyptians (tough but honorable sea-going nomads) in search of their own lost children, Lyra heads North.In her search for her missing friend, Lyra will encounter Iorek Byrnison (I know I couldn't have spelled that right - just think of a polar bear with battle armor and the voice of Ian Mckellen) a witch named Serrafina Pekkala (let's just put spell-check aside, this is a parallel universe) played by Eva Green, an ""aeronaut"" from Texas (and therefore played by Sam Elliot) and various other characters.  Her search will bring her to a remote polar research station run by the Magisterium where cruel experiments are conducted on children to separate them from their demons, their personal conduits for Dust.NOW THAT I'VE WAXED ON THE STORY...There's a lot of material underlying the ""Dark Materials"" trilogy, of which GC is the 1st part.  Unfortunately, none of it actually works its way into the narrative of this movie.  The script excised much of the story's barb against organized religion, reducing the Magisterium to a bunch of generic odious characters in funny clothes plotting something, and ever extending their authority.  It's hard to imagine how well the flick would have done were its script larded down with polemic of any kind (let alone anti-religious), but the movie fails because it fails to become a story about anything.  It would be easy for the fans to blame Hollywood for taking god out of the picture (as ironic a charge that is for the left) but fantasy stories have always been based on characters who were analogs for those of real life (or acknowledged as such in real life), and The Magisterium of the books could have been replaced with one just as potent without condescending to religious viewers.  I mean, this is a parallel universe - it's all about finding different versions of what we already recognize.Unfortunately, rather than playing shell-games with its symbols, GC decides not to play anything at all.  The Magisterium never becomes more than generic baddies (and because they don't do much at all, its hard to envision them as villains at all); there's a war between polar bears that will see Iorek returned to the throne - even though the bears as a whole never become a factor in the story once that happens; there are witches and an evil army of cossak-looking guys, scientists and ofcourse Mrs. Coulter.  There's plenty of CGI designed to make us think that things are happening, and the story includes a northbound journey to make it seem like the story is going somewhere when it doesn't.  The movie climaxes on a pitched battle between the cossak-looking guys on one side and witches, gyptians and Iorek on the other - it's old stuff to anybody who sat through Narnia and at least 2 of the Rings movies, and since it's shot at night, it's harder to see what's going on.  Though the movie preserves at least some of the book's rich material, the narrative sloppily integrates it into the story - using embarrassingly obvious expository dialog and bombarding Lyra with a number of characters who exist if only to show/tell Lyra what to do next.  Virtually every plot element in the story is told to us rather than discovered by Lyra.  (The Alethiometer is supposed to tell truth, but it to becomes a convenient plot device, a GPS for Lyra to navigate the story's otherwise unnavigable byways.)There's actually a moment in GC that promises what the rest of the movie fails to deliver.  Lyra, having been chased to the doors of her College-home by a band of Gyptian children, warns them back.  She threatens them with unspeakable horrors should they cross the gates of the school.  The gyptian boy isn't one to suffer threats easily, so he and Lyra engage in duel of wits that ends with the combatants cheerily scheduling a later time to resume their war.  The scene embodies everything that the rest of the movie doesn't: a horrible fate, an unceasing belief (or unceasing refusal to believe) in it, and the unique capacity of children to create a great story, live it and know its limits.",3,The big story about nothing,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,5868,"['nearly', 'parallel', 'universe', 'things', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'Human', 'beings',

654208,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00005JPNY,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 2]","I haven't read any of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials Triology (His Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass) (His Dark Materials)), so I'm judging The Golden Compass on its own merits. In the tradition of Tolkien or Rowling, Pullman has created an amazingly complex alternate universe populated by armored polar bears, daemons (a human's soul, which is present as an animal that walks alongside its owner and mirrors his/her behavior), and the ominous Magisterium, which seeks to control any hint of magic, including the mysterious Dust.The film opens with the precocious Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards)  defying some other children her own age; she's always getting into trouble at school. However, her penchant for being where she's not supposed to saves the life of her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig, better known as the new Bond), who's wrapped up in discovering the source of Dust and alternate worlds. As such, he's a threat to the Magisterium, and they want him eliminated.  The beautiful, icy Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) swoops in and dazzles Lyra, offering to take her up North where the armored bears live. Meanwhile, children are mysteriously disappearing from school, taken by the Gobblers, and when Lyra's friend Roger disappears, she sets off to find him (strangely enough, my first thought at seeing how the male children were dressed in this universe was Afghanistan; their vests and hats bore a striking resemblance to Afghani costume).It only becomes more confusing from there as the backstory is not adequately explained; we have no gradual introduction to the characters or their motivations, and it took me a while to sort everything out. There are numerous elements at work, including the Gyptians, Magesterium, and armored bears.  The film's stellar cast (Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Freddie Highmore, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee) felt underutilized, and what could have been powerful performances felt like overacted cameos. The film may be a visual treat, steeped in impressive CGI and eye-popping Art Deco that reminded me ofSky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition), but many times it seemed that the visuals upstaged the tattered story. The storytelling was disjointed at times, feeling too rushed in some places and too slow in others. The climactic battle scene felt forced, unnecessary, and far too long (and disturbingly graphic for what was otherwise a generally non-violent movie).  The PG-13 rating for the violence didn't mesh with the storytelling and execution, which seemed geared towards a much younger audience. The ending is clearly set up for a sequel, and felt disappointing after sitting through the too-long battle scenes; just as the final confrontation approached, the credits played.  But overall, Golden Compass is richly imagined and a visual treat, and I look forward to reading the books that inspired it.",3,"A stylish, if disjointed, tale",1212710400,"06 6, 2008",2008,2942,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'Triology', 'Dark', 'Materials', 'Trilogy', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Subtle', 'Knife', 'Amber', 'Spyglass', 'Dark', 'Materials', ""'m"", 'judging', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'own', 'merits', 'tradition', 'Tolkien', 'Rowling', 'Pullman', 'created', 'amazingly', 'complex', 'alternate', 'universe', 'populated', 'armored', 'polar', 'bears', 'daemons', 'human', 'soul', 'present', 'animal', 'owner', 'mirrors', 'his/her', 'behavior', 'ominous', 'Magisterium', 'control', 'hint', 'magic', 'including', 'mysterious', 'Dust.The', 'film', 'precocious', 'Lyra', 'Dakota', 'Blue', 'Richards', 'defying', 'other', 'children', 'own', 'age', 'always', 'getting', 'trouble', 'school', 'However', 'penchant', 'being', 'where', 'not', 'supposed', 'saves', 'life', 'uncle', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'better', 'known', 'new', 'Bond', 'who', 'wrapped', 'up', 'discovering', 'source', 'Dust', 'alternate', 'worlds', 'such', 'threat', 'Magisterium', 'want', 'eliminated', 'beautiful', 'icy', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'dazzles', 'Lyra', 'offering', 'take', 'up', 'North', 'where', 'armored', 'bears', 'live', 'Meanwhile', 'children', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'disappearing', 'school', 'taken', 'Gobblers', 'when', 'Lyra', 'friend', 'Roger', 'find', 'strangely', 'enough', 'first', 'thought', 'seeing', 'how', 'male', 'children', 'were', 'dressed', 'universe', 'was', 'Afghanistan', 'vests', 'hats', 'bore', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Afghani', 'costume', 'only', 'more', 'confusing', 'backstory', 'not', 'adequately', 'explained', 'have', 'gradual', 'introduction', 'characters', 'motivations', 'took', 'while', 'sort', 'everything', 'out', 'are', 'numerous', 'elements', 'work', 'including', 'Gyptians', 'Magesterium', 'armored', 'bears', 'film', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'felt', 'underutilized', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'performances', 'felt', 'overacted', 'cameos', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'visual', 'treat', 'steeped', 'impressive', 'CGI', 'eye-popping', 'Art', 'Deco', 'reminded', 'ofSky', 'Captain', 'World', 'Tomorrow', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'many', 'times', 'seemed', 'visuals', 'upstaged', 'tattered', 'story', 'storytelling', 'was', 'disjointed', 'times', 'feeling', 'too', 'rushed', 'places', 'too', 'slow', 'others', 'climactic', 'battle', 'scene', 'felt', 'forced', 'unnecessary', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'disturbingly', 'graphic', 'what', 'was', 'otherwise', 'generally', 'non-violent', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'storytelling', 'execution', 'seemed', 'geared', 'much', 'younger', 'audience', 'ending', 'clearly', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'felt', 'disappointing', 'sitting', 'too-long', 'battle', 'scenes', 'just', 'final', 'confrontation', 'approached', 'credits', 'played', 'overall', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'richly', 'imagined', 'visual', 'treat', 'look', 'forward', 'reading', 'books', 'inspired']",The Golden Compass

This time, though, I'm doing it backwards.  Pullman's worlds are interesting places, if not original in how he creates them.  Conceptually he's not doing anything new, metaphorically indicating the mind control of organized bodies exerting control over children.  What is a bit new is that neither in his discussion around the text nor in the progression of the film, itself, does he hold back that he's doing just that.  In no way is it veiled, the influence of life-altering mind control through the vehicle of a children's story.  If that is unsettling or rouses your ire, this is not your world to explore.  Apart from the challenging concepts driving the film Pullman's very obvious plays on words as charged language reclaimed is remarkable.On to the pretty: Chosen ""orphaned"" girl saves lives against all odds, with lovely graphic effects and shapeshifting daemons.  The deeper emotional implications of her journey were fairly lacking, which I thought a bit thin.  The visual impact of the film was lovely, coupled with the psychological leaps viewers are expected to make solely based on sheer images.  Speaking off--when did Nicole Kidman gets her lips fluffed?  And Dakota Blue Richards is Tilda Swinton in a time warp, I swear it.I did come away with one question that I couldn't decipher if it was related to the book or the film.  How was Lyra reading the Alethiometer?  There were the tactile mechanics of the device, yet the special effects of the film indicated she was having an internal experience rather than merely reading the compass.  For me this was problematic in following the base logic of the premise, which is that Lyra is the only one who can read the Alethiometer.  I always have issues in fiction when technology is required to fuel the knowledge of the soul.  In this case it made me question if Lyra was a tool for the Alethiometer, or if it was a tool for her.  Perhaps it doesn't matter, but for me, if it's the former I'm again frustrated with the lack of the imagination to rest knowledge confidently on intuition.

The overall storytelling is terrible, and the characters' motivations are never explained.It starts in the narration at the beginning when we're told that the Magisterium wants to preserve their truth so they've destroyed all the alethiometers (which reveal hidden truths) and banned the mention of dust. What does the Magisterium fear from dust?? We're never told. And what ""truths"" is the Magisterium trying to protect? We're never told. The movie basically says, ""They're the bad guys"" but gives no other explanation.What is the motivation of Nicole Kidman's character to do what she does? We're never told. How do the Gyptians (or whatever they're called) know that the missing kids have been taken to the north? We're never told.  Why does the movie billing say that it stars Daniel Craig when he only appears in the first five minutes? We're never told!However, we are ""told"" lots of the story. Instead of *showing* the story to us, several of the characters have long lines explaining all sorts of things for the benefit of the audience. Boring and contrived. And two characters tell Lyra bits of information that she uses later in the story, but the characters have no reason to tell her those things at the time that they tell her. Very awfully contrived.One of the worst aspects of this movie is that it is an incomplete first installment that makes no attempt to wrap up any story lines so that the audience feels any sense of closure. The Harry Potter stories are all complete in themselves. The Narnia stories are all complete in themselves. This movie is just an ad for sequels. By the very end of the movie they have managed to assemble most (not all) of ""the team"" that is obviously intended to go on together. But even that is incomplete, with Lyra saying ""Now let's go pick up my dad and add him to the team"" but then the movie ends. They don't rescue dad. They don't explain the dust. They don't explain anyone's motivations. And they don't give the audience a satisfying movie experience.I haven't read the book, but I'll be generous and assume that the author did a much better job with all this, and they just couldn't find a way to fit all the bits into the movie.

Hollywood is too anxious to make the next series of LOTR's or Harry Potter's that they are hardly putting any work into the storylines or CGI to make it interesting at all. This movie is full of so many gaps that it does the novels extreme injustice. A fantasy-based movie like this should not be under 2 hours if you're trying to encompass a huge story as The Golden Compass is supposed to be. And if it was going to be over 2 hours, at least make it more interesting.

654216,A1MTPO0O59D94O,B00005JPNY,S. Rosenbaum,"[5, 10]","I saw the movie of ""The Golden Compass"" before reading the book, though I had read news articles about the controversy over the making of it.  I wanted to like the film, being impressed with the story's highly original ideas, and by its strong young heroine as a champion for freedom of thought.  Yet, I was bothered by a number of things.One was the all-too-obvious CGI effects, which made the alternate universe in which the story is set look less realistic and more cartoonish than it should have.  A more skilled director than Chris Weitz(Alfonso Cuaron for instance) could have worked wonders with some of the visual set pieces that the book provides.Another was knowing that some of Weitz's deviations from Philip Pullman's novel were made, not for cinematic reasons, but as self-censorship.  His  attempt to make the story less offensive to religious groups, who were opposed to the novels, made the story less coherent, and the religious groups came out against the movie anyway.The big surprise coming in a way that's very close to a very famous scene in a very famous film.  (The book reveals the surprise much earlier and in a different, though, admittedly, less cinematic way.)Then there was the awkward non-ending, which left people in the audience I saw it with feeling cheated.  It also violated one of the prime directives of screenwriting:  show, don't tell.  We're told what happened to Lord Asriel instead of getting a climactic scene with him.Not so, in Pullman's version, which I just finished reading.  The final scenes of the book are astounding, and they end with a cliffhanger more cinematic than anything in the movie.  By failing to incorporate these scenes into the film, and cutting off the story where he did, Weitz effectively cut his movie off from its daemon.  ""Just a little cut,"" one might say.  But this cut was fatal.",3,Failure to incorporate the book's climactic scenes kills the film,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,1854,"['saw', 'movie', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'reading', 'book', 'had', 'read', 'news', 'articles', 'controversy', 'making', 'wanted', 'film', 'being', 'impressed', 'story', 'highly', 'original', 'ideas', 'strong', 'young', 'heroine', 'champion', 'freedom', 'thought', 'was', 'bothered', 'number', 'things.One', 'was', 'all-too-obvious', 'CGI', 'effects', 'made', 'alternate', 'universe', 'story', 'set', 'look', 'less', 'realistic', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'skilled', 'director', 'Chris', 'Weitz', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'instance', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'wonders', 'visual', 'set', 'pieces', 'book', 'provides.Another', 'was', 'knowing', 'Weitz', 'deviations', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'novel', 'were', 'made', 'not', 'cinematic', 'reasons', 'self-censorship', 'attempt', 'make', 'story', 'less', 'offensive', 'religious', 'groups', 'who', 'were', 'opposed', 'novels', 'made', 'story', 'less', 'coherent', 'religious', 'groups', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'anyway.The', 'big', 'surprise', 'coming', 'way', 'very', 'close', 'very', 'famous', 'scene', 'very', 'famous', 'film', 'book', 'surprise', 'much', 'earlier', 'different', 'though', 'admittedly', 'less', 'cinematic', 'way', 'Then', 'was', 'awkward', 'non-ending', 'left', 'people', 'audience', 'saw', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'also', 'violated', 'one', 'prime', 'directives', 'screenwriting', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'told', 'what', 'happened', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'instead', 'getting', 'climactic', 'scene', 'him.Not', 'so', 'Pullman', 'version', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'final', 'scenes', 'book', 'are', 'astounding', 'end', 'cliffhanger', 'more', 'cinematic', 'anything', 'movie', 'failing', 'incorporate', 'scenes', 'film', 'cutting', 'off', 'story', 'where', 'did', 'Weitz', 'effectively', 'cut', 'movie', 'daemon', 'Just', 'little', 'cut', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'cut', 'was', 'fatal']",The Golden Compass

654226,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPNY,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 8]","For all of its bells and whistles, of which it has many, The Golden Compass is still unable to surpass the status of a replication of one of the countless existing family-friendly fantasy films out there. Even with the astute devising of daemons and the heart-stirringly massive armored bears, it is essentially another version of ""Narnia"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"". It's solid entertainment, but of the repetitious kind - much like it's the sequel to something else, even though it is clearly the first of a series.Young Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) lives in an alternate world to earth - many of the locations and lands are similar to our planet, but certainly not to be mistaken for the same. The most noticeable difference, aside from the science fiction fantasy blend of technology, is that the souls of humans appear on the outside of their bodies, in the form of animals called Daemons, that faithfully accompany them. Lyra's ever-changing Daemon is known as Pantalaimon (voiced by Freddie Highmore).When Lyra hears about a forbidden magical particle called dust, beguiling scientist Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman) asks Lyra to join her on a journey to the north as an assistant. Lyra is eager for a chance to escape her schoolwork and follow after her uncle Lord Asrial (Daniel Craig), who is also journeying to the Arctic Circle to investigate a sighting of large quantities of dust. Shortly after her departure, Lyra discovers that Mrs. Coulter is working for the Magisterium, the strict government that rules over the land. Linking Coulter to the recent disappearance of her best friend, Lyra sets out to locate a villainous facility where kidnapped children are used for cruel experimentation. During her travels she is aided by a band of Gyptians, a Texas airship pilot (Sam Elliott), the mysterious witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green) and a giant armored ice bear named Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen) to carve out a path of freedom for the captured children. Along the way she also obtains an Alethiometer, a strange golden compass that tells the truth to those who know how to read (and sure enough she knows how to read it).There are quite a few innovative ideas at work in The Golden Compass, the first of Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy adaptations. Daemons, the souls that take the shape of animals are unique and well-developed and allow for much of the photorealistic computer graphics work. The fact that they speak and serve as a physical conscience is even more fascinating.Another aspect, which is certainly not as unique, is the Magisterium, the totalitarian government that controls the alternate world. They keep people in line by telling them what to do - something rebellious little Lyra has great difficulty accepting. The Catholic Church has been in an uproar ever since this project was announced, and has banned its viewing by members due to the Magisterium's loose resemblance to their religious hierarchy. The only way anyone could take offense to possible symbolism in a completely fictitious work is by assuming that such characters resemble them too closely. But the Magisterium is simply an Orwellian dictatorship as witnessed in countless other films. In the movie they are clearly villains - could it be that the church views itself as despotic antagonists?The armored bear is perhaps the finest accomplishment for the film, although at times he wanders dangerously close to unrealistic. But considering a giant talking bear is already unbelievable, The Golden Compass does a spectacular job of bringing him to life with nearly flawless movement and extraordinary muscle and fur interaction. Several of the daemons are less impressive, including Mrs. Coulter's golden monkey, which at times barely resembles an animal.Films like The Golden Compass usually have a difficult time with their introduction due to the difficulty of quickly defining an entirely foreign world. They have to provide enough information to make you believe in the fantasy, without overloading you with complex jargon. Despite the ridiculous names that are impossible to keep track of, The Golden Compass does introduce its wonders quickly and relatively clearly so that most audiences won't be left with too many questions.

654228,AJ88Z1U0SS1IY,B00005JPNY,"Tim Warneka ""Leadership Expert, Keynote Speak...","[42, 83]","Let's start with my ""credentials"" (such as they are). I'm a very big fan of fantasy. I read Lord of the Rings as a teen in the mid-80's and loved the movies. I've read most of the existing fantasy stories and have seen the movies as well. I've studied Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell long and hard. As a leadership coach and consultant, I constantly try to support the underdeveloped metaphorical, symbolic approaches in people and organizations.Okay, actually, I'm a PUSH-OVER when it comes to fantasy. I'm pretty much willing to give any fantasy story the benefit of the doubt.So remember: I WANTED to like this movie.Having said that, after watching this movie with my 12-year-old son, all I can say is, ""Huh?""  This movie barely made any sense. Characters remained under-developed (most of the adults). The heroine appeared simply to be a brat who got lucky. I'm a big fan of Nicole Kidman, but she seemed to overpower the role she was placed in ... and almost everyone she appeared in a scene with.The stereotypical pseudo-archetypes were rampant in this one. Let's see, we've got ...* evil, nasty mother figure.* Uninvolved, unknown father figure.* Evil, power-drunk priest-figures.* Highly skilled warrior who gets dragged out of a drunken forced retirement to save the day (okay, he WAS a polar bear in this movie, but still ...)* Overly young children precociously being heroes (what IS it with this culture's fixation on young children in hero roles? Anyone ever heard of an older teen-ager or young adult?)* Precocious young children just ""knowing"" how to use a special magic item that other people had to spend years studying.* An evil being who killed the king and usurped the throne. (okay, HE was a polar bear, TOO. But still ...)* A kindly cowboy (I mean, ""aeronaut"").* A sexy witch.* Friendly pirates (excuse me, ""Gyptians."").* Evil-yet-incompetent henchmen/scientists who seem to be unable to: (1) lock doors; (2) stop kids from getting away.Yep. I think we covered them all here.But, Lord, the star power. The aforementioned Kidman, Daniel Craig, Derek Jacobi, Sam Elliot, Ian McKellen, Kristen Scott Thomas, Jim Carter (an under-rated actor) and on and on. Talent mostly wasted in this movie.During the ""nasty-woman-discloses-she-is-the-mother-of-the-young-heroine"" scene, I practically started laughing. I wanted to stand up and shout, ""Luke, I am your father!""! One could probably superimpose the same scenes from both movies and find that they are pretty close to each other.Some of the scenes were interesting. The neo-Art Deco props were interesting to look at, although the start of the movie seemed unclear whether it wanted to give a nod to Charles Dickens or Harry Potter.Finally, the ending was lame. Extremely lame. When the movie finished, my 12-year-old son (who has read the books) simply sat staring at the screen with his jaw hanging open. He said that the book ended much better (as some other reviewers have also reported).The books may have some real mythological material in them. Sometimes watching this movie was like trying to watch a  hour TV sitcom cover Romeo & Juliet - you know there's something of value there, but can quite seem to get to it.If one was a cynic, one might wonder if all of the ""anti-God"" hoopla was created simply to salvage an ailing movie. One wonders. I'm going to give the books a read, just to see if there's anything to salvage after this atrocious movie.",1,Huh?!?,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,3425,"['Let', 'start', 'credentials', 'such', 'are', ""'m"", 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'fantasy', 'read', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'teen', 'mid-80', 'loved', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'existing', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'well', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'long', 'hard', 'leadership', 'coach', 'consultant', 'constantly', 'try', 'support', 'underdeveloped', 'metaphorical', 'symbolic', 'approaches', 'people', 'organizations.Okay', 'actually', ""'m"", 'PUSH-OVER', 'when', 'fantasy', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'much', 'willing', 'give', 'fantasy', 'story', 'benefit', 'doubt.So', 'remember', 'WANTED', 'like', 'movie.Having', 'said', 'watching', 'movie', '12-year-old', 'son', 'can', 'say', 'Huh', 'movie', 'barely', 'made', 'sense', 'Characters', 'remained', 'under-developed', 'most', 'adults', 'heroine', 'appeared', 'simply', 'be', 'brat', 'who', 'got', 'lucky', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'seemed', 'overpower', 'role', 'was', 'placed', 'almost', 'everyone', 'appeared', 'scene', 'with.The', 'stereotypical', 'pseudo-archetypes', 'were', 'rampant', 'one', 'Let', 'see', ""'ve"", 'got', 'evil', 'nasty', 'mother', 'figure', '*', 'Uninvolved', 'unknown', 'father', 'figure', '*', 'Evil', 'power-drunk', 'priest-figures', '*', 'Highly', 'skilled', 'warrior', 'who', 'dragged', 'drunken', 'forced', 'retirement', 'save', 'day', 'okay', 'WAS', 'polar', 'bear', 'movie', 'still', '*', 'Overly', 'young', 'children', 'precociously', 'being', 'heroes', 'what', 'culture', 'fixation', 'young', 'children', 'hero', 'roles', 'Anyone', 'ever', 'heard', 'older', 'teen-ager', 'young', 'adult', '*', 'Precocious', 'young', 'children', 'just', 'knowing', 'how', 'use', 'special', 'magic', 'item', 'other', 'people', 'had', 'spend', 'years', 'studying', '*', 'evil', 'being', 'who', 'killed', 'king', 'usurped', 'throne', 'okay', 'HE', 'was', 'polar', 'bear', 'TOO', 'still', '*', 'kindly', 'cowboy', 'mean', 'aeronaut', '*', 'sexy', 'witch', 'Friendly', 'pirates', 'Gyptians.', '*', 'Evil-yet-incompetent', 'henchmen/scientists', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'unable', '1', 'lock', 'doors', '2', 'stop', 'kids', 'getting', 'away.Yep', 'think', 'covered', 'here.But', 'Lord', 'star', 'power', 'aforementioned', 'Kidman', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'under-rated', 'actor', 'Talent', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'movie.During', 'nasty-woman-discloses-she-is-the-mother-of-the-young-heroine', 'scene', 'practically', 'started', 'laughing', 'wanted', 'stand', 'up', 'shout', 'Luke', 'am', 'father', 'One', 'could', 'probably', 'superimpose', 'same', 'scenes', 'movies', 'find', 'are', 'pretty', 'close', 'other.Some', 'scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'neo-Art', 'Deco', 'props', 'were', 'interesting', 'look', 'start', 'movie', 'seemed', 'unclear', 'wanted', 'give', 'nod', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Harry', 'Potter.Finally', 'ending', 'was', 'lame', 'Extremely', 'lame', 'When', 'movie', 'finished', '12-year-old', 'son', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'simply', 'sat', 'staring', 'screen', 'jaw', 'hanging', 'open', 'said', 'book', 'ended', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'also', 'reported', '.The', 'books', 'may', 'have', 'real', 'mythological', 'material', 'Sometimes', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'watch', 'hour', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'cover', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'know', 'something', 'value', 'there', 'can', 'quite', 'seem', 'get', 'it.If', 'one', 'was', 'cynic', 'one', 'might', 'wonder', 'anti-God', 'hoopla', 'was', 'created', 'simply', 'salvage', 'ailing', 'movie', 'One', 'wonders', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'books', 'read', 'just', 'see', 'anything', 'salvage', 'atrocious', 'movie']",The Golden Compass

654234,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B00005JPNY,trashcanman,"[7, 15]","""The Golden Compass"" tries very, very hard to appeal to an adult audience with clumsy attempts at moralization and championing freedom of thought, but it can't seem to get over it's own childish nature and become a movie worth watching.  Considering the stink made by religious groups, one would think this was a blatantly anti-religion film.  It is not.  Anyone who says so likely has not seen it and therefore should have no opinion on it.  What the ""The Golden Compass"" IS is an anti-establishment rebellion against authoratative theocracy based on suppression of dissenting opinions.  This, naturally, would make the Catholic Church nervous since they have fostered more bad will on this planet than Bush/Cheney, Kim Jong-Il, and Bin Ladin put together.  I've also heard that the film's villains, an organization known as The Magisterium, represents Catholicism.  Funny, The Magisterium never does anything in this film as blatantly evil as The Inquisition so if what they say is true, I'd say organized religion got off lightly.I decided to set the record straight on this film after reading Roger Ebert's embarrassing gushings about it.  And I am myself a master of the gush so it takes a lot to embarrass me.  Let's just say he places it aboveThe Lord of the Rings,The Chronicles of Narnia, ANDHarry Potter] on the fantasy genre.  The man has committed his share of film atrocites, but this ranks even above his razing ofA Clockwork Orangeon the ""you-get-paid-for-this?!"" scale of mainstream reviewer gaffes.But first, the good.  The film looks great, has at least one great and surprisingly violent moment, and at least attempts to delve into deep metaphors that most fantasy films wouldn't even touch.  The daemons (pronouced like ""demons"" but spelled in the old english way that meant ""spirits"" before the meaning and spelling were corrupted) are a great device.  Each human's spirit accompanies them in the form of an animal which can change shape (like a child's mind and personality) during a person's formative years before settling on one form later in life.  That is where the good ends because ,unfortunately, the animals talk.  At least the heroine's does, and good god is he annoying.  Thus the fantastic metaphor is reduced to a yammering ferret most of the time that reminds you every minute or so that you are watching a children's movie.Now the rest of the bad. The film's overall message is a good one, but the execution of the story is atrocious.  The dialogue is a constant irritation.  Original author Phillip Pullman obviously does not have the mastery of language that Tolkien, Lewis, and even Rowling displayed with such ease.  The fantasy masters create entire languages all their own that roll off the tongue and are fun to read and speak.  ""The Golden Compass"" throws words like ""alethiometer"", ""gobblers"", and ""dust"" around.  Why call the golden compass an alethiometer?  Obnoxious pseudo-intellectualism, the same type that forces a word like ""daemon"" -whose original meaning is dead, buried, and replaced- down our throats when any of a hundred others would have been wiser.  What is dust?  They don't really say and most of the characters don't know but apparently it connects worlds together and is talked about incessantly as if it is super-important. [snore] Are gobblers killer turkeys or something; I mean, we're supposed to be afraid of them, right?  No, they aren't turkeys and yes they are meant to sound menacing; but is ""gobblers"" really the scariest thing they could have called the Magisterium's child kidnapping squad?  Why not just call Gyptians gypsies?  Did Pullman just touch a globe and remove the first vowel in the name of the country he landed on to come up with that?  I could go on, but I'll stop now.  No, one more.  After hearing almost everbody talk in perfect king's english the whole movie I wasn't about to cheer for a little girl shouting ""he ain't nuthin'"" to her polar bear (oh, I'm sorry, ICE bear) friend about to fight for their lives like she was 50 Cent.  And can somebody tell me why there's a COWBOY in this movie?Naturally, every character and group comes together suddenly with no premable for a big epic battle at the end.  Not really sure why most of the people were there, but I'll assume it was to fight evil.  And why is The Magisterium so evil?  Sure there's the power and all that, but Nicole Kidman's character seems to have no motive whatsoever.  She just scowls around the place trying to look evil with all her icy-hotness and then looks even more evil when she smiles.  Nice trick, but what's really in it for her?  The Compass scenes were cool the first few times, but then we're shown it again and again and again and I'm over it.  And what exactly is all this leading up to?  Tune in next time and hope it makes sense!Obviously, this is a shot at a big money franchise, but it falls way short.  I am not that guy that hated the first LOTR film, rushed to the midnight showing of the second, hated it, and waited in line overnight to catch the third and am still talking about how much those movies sucked.  You get one shot with me and if you miss, I'm out.  This movie cribs from the best of them but falls far short of any attempt at a cohesive story, a believable world, likeable characters, or even any outstanding action scenes.  It is beyond ridiculous and I was embarrassed when my wife (a Potter fantatic) walked in on me watching it.  Seriously. The religious protesters need to sit the hell down and stop behaving like over-the-top villains if they want to stop being compared to them and Roger Ebert needs to get a real job. This is one project that is not worthy of anybody's attention.  The kids may enjoy it, but anybody intelligent enough to comprehend the depth this film tries so hard to achieve will likely be put off from this series permanently by the clumsy and amateurish execution and childish language.  Anyone who says otherwise is likely doing so to spite the aforementioned religious nuts.  I say there are plenty of ways to do that without stooping to defending a third rate B-movie in bloated big-budget clothing.  MST3K, where are you?1 1/2 stars rounded up to spite those religious nuts.",2,Your compass should point elsewhere,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,6211,"['Golden', 'Compass', 'very', 'very', 'hard',

654235,A1XOQOW2HJSOIV,B00005JPNY,"Trekkintheplains ""Take a sad song and make it...","[0, 0]","I'll start of by saying that I am extremely pleased with some movie adaptations of books I've really enjoyed.  I'll cite Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings as some.  While there are some variations in Harry Potter I take issue with, for the most part, they are true to the original purpose.Now I'll say I know exactly why The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass were never adapted.  It's the same reason the Narnia series was cancelled after The Dawn Treader - poor casting, poor acting, and a serious deviation from a beloved storyline.  When directors and scriptwriters' heads get too big for them, the movie goes down the tubes.  The reason a book is adapted is because people love it!  Don't change it so much it becomes a story loosely based on a book!This movie skews so far in some ways.  First off, the casting.  Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman DO NOT fit the descriptions given for Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter.  Their looks, their personalities, etc. are just not right.  Then there are a lot of small things that add up to a jumbled tale - the Master is supposed to poison the wine. Fra Pavel was an aleithiometer reader, not the antagonist.  Lyra knows Roger has been taken by the Gobblers before she leaves Jordan college and is already set on rescuing him.  Then, she escapes at a party unnoticed, she never find the golden monkey in her room and darts out the window.  Plus, the Gyptians weren't looking for and over Lyra once she left Jordan, Lyra meets Lord Faa and Farder Coram in the Fens, not on a big ships.  Gyptians travel by longboats in canals and waterways.  And there are lots of people who know things they aren't supposed to know.  It all moves very quickly.  I understand it's a movie and has to move quickly, but you lose so much of the feel of Lyra's Oxford this way.  Plus we miss a very large part of the background of Lyra, her parents, and the part of the Gyptians, which I believe is an important part of the story.  As is her time in the Fens, another interesting area I would have liked to have seen in the film.Then the Gyptians are off to get the Gobblers in no time, and then they show Mrs. Coulter in league with Fra Pavel, and Serafina Pekkala shows up on the deck of the ship instead of her daemon Kaisa, as it should have been.  All wrong.  Lyra doesn't meet Serafina until she's flying with Lee Scoresby.  Nor does she pose such a dumb question for Lyra to ask the aleithiometer.  Also, she should know that Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter are her parents at this point, thanks to Ma Costa.  And Billy Costa NEVER experiences intercision, it's a kid named Tony Makarios Lyra and Iorek find in the fish hut in the village.  Lyra's being taken to Svalbard, Iorek's ascension to king, and the progression to Bolvangar take place out of sequence and not as they happened in the book as well.  Lyra should free the daemons at Bolvangar, aided by Kaisa, and when she goes to Lord Asriel, she should be with a contingent of armored bears, not in the balloon.  And we never see the cliff ghasts or really learn anything about the armoured bears.What it boils down to is this: all the elements that Philip Pullman worked so hard to integrate into his story, to make Lyra's world such a rich, full, complex, and unique one are watered down.  We don't get the feel for her world.  And we know it's possible - I cite the Harry Potter series, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  They got the mood, complexities, feelings, and characters *just* right.  You can feel you're a part of a vibrant world in those movies.  This feels washed out and watered down, like we're just skimming the surface instead of being immersed in it.Even worse?  The movie ends before the book does.  And that's it.  1 hour and 43 minutes.  Not enough time to get the right story or the true feeling of the book.  Lyra's character has no real depth.  She's just a kid darting from one thing to the next.  Her true mind and drive don't come through clearly in the movie.It's a shame the movie turned out so poorly, as this is one of my favorite trilogies.  Its casting shows a hope for better  things.  Despite their being wrong for the parts, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig are no small-time actors.  Add to that the voice of Ian McKellan, Sam Elliott, the voice of Freddie Highmore, and Derek Jacobi, and you would think it would be a better movie.  Jim Carter has since made a name for himself in Downton Abbey as well.  All name and no oomph.I'm so disappointed in this movie, and that they were cut off so quickly.  I hope a better screenwriter and director take them up again someday.",3,"Skews so far from the book, skims the surface, so disappointing",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,4598,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'books', ""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', ""'ll"", 'cite', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'are', 'variations', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'take', 'issue', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'true', 'original', 'purpose.Now', ""'ll"", 'say', 'know', 'exactly', 'why', 'Subtle', 'Knife', 'Amber', 'Spyglass', 'were', 'never', 'adapted', 'same', 'reason', 'Narnia', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Dawn', 'Treader', 'poor', 'casting', 'poor', 'acting', 'serious', 'deviation', 'beloved', 'storyline', 'When', 'directors', 'scriptwriters', 'heads', 'get', 'too', 'big', 'movie', 'down', 'tubes', 'reason', 'book', 'adapted', 'people', 'love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'change', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'ways', 'First', 'casting', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'DO', 'NOT', 'fit', 'descriptions', 'given', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'looks', 'personalities', 'etc', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'Then', 'are', 'lot', 'small', 'things', 'add', 'up', 'jumbled', 'tale', 'Master', 'supposed', 'poison', 'wine', 'Fra', 'Pavel', 'was', 'aleithiometer', 'reader', 'not', 'antagonist', 'Lyra', 'Roger', 'been', 'taken', 'Gobblers', 'Jordan', 'college', 'already', 'set', 'rescuing', 'Then', 'party', 'unnoticed', 'never', 'find', 'golden', 'monkey', 'room', 'out', 'window', 'Gyptians', 'were', ""n't"", 'looking', 'Lyra', 'once', 'left', 'Jordan', 'Lyra', 'Lord', 'Faa', 'Farder', 'Coram', 'Fens', 'not', 'big', 'ships', 'Gyptians', 'travel', 'longboats', 'canals', 'waterways', 'are', 'lots', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'know', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'understand', 'movie', 'move', 'quickly', 'lose', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'Lyra', 'Oxford', 'way', 'miss', 'very', 'large', 'part', 'background', 'Lyra', 'parents', 'part', 'Gyptians', 'believe', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'time', 'Fens', 'interesting', 'area', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'film.Then', 'Gyptians', 'are', 'get', 'Gobblers', 'time', 'then', 'show', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'league', 'Fra', 'Pavel', 'Serafina', 'Pekkala', 'up', 'deck', 'ship', 'instead', 'daemon', 'Kaisa', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'Lyra', ""n't"", 'meet', 'Serafina', 'flying', 'Lee', 'Scoresby', 'pose', 'such', 'dumb', 'question', 'Lyra', 'ask', 'aleithiometer', 'Also', 'should', 'know', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'Mrs.', 'Coulter', 'are', 'parents', 'point', 'thanks', 'Ma', 'Costa', 'Billy', 'Costa', 'NEVER', 'intercision', 'kid', 'named', 'Tony', 'Makarios', 'Lyra', 'Iorek', 'find', 'fish', 'hut', 'village', 'Lyra', 'being', 'taken', 'Svalbard', 'Iorek', 'ascension', 'king', 'progression', 'Bolvangar', 'take', 'place', 'sequence', 'not', 'happened', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'Lyra', 'should', 'free', 'daemons', 'Bolvangar', 'aided', 'Kaisa', 'when', 'Lord', 'Asriel', 'should', 'be', 'contingent', 'armored', 'bears', 'not', 'balloon', 'never', 'see', 'cliff', 'ghasts', 'really', 'learn', 'anything', 'armoured', 'down', 'elements', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'integrate', 'story', 'make', 'Lyra', 'world', 'rich', 'full', 'complex', 'unique', 'one', 'are', 'watered', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feel', 'world', 'know', 'possible', 'cite', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'got', 'mood', 'complexities', 'feelings', 'characters', '*just*', 'right', 'can', 'feel', ""'re"", 'part', 'vibrant', 'world', 'movies', 'feels', 'washed', 'out', 'watered', 'down', ""'re"", 'just', 'skimming', 'surface', 'instead', 'being', 'immersed', 'it.Even', 'worse', 'movie', 'book', '1', 'hour', '43', 'minutes', 'Not', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'right', 'story', 'true', 'feeling', 'book', 'Lyra', 'character', 'real', 'depth', 'just', 'kid', 'darting', 'one', 'thing', 'next', 'true', 'mind', 'drive', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'clearly', 'movie.It', 'shame', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'poorly', 'one', 'favorite', 'trilogies', 'casting', 'hope', 'better', 'things', 'being', 'wrong', 'parts', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'are', 'small-time', 'actors', 'Add', 'voice', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'voice', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'made', 'name', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'as', 'well', 'name', 'oomph.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'so', 'quickly', 'hope', 'better', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'take', 'up', 'again', 'someday']",The Golden Compass

But one sad thing is the film itself doesn't have magic. It lacks a compelling story that would make its audiences willing to share the adventures with the heroine.The film follows the story of the strong-minded young girl Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) living among Oxford scholars. While her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) travels to find out the truths of magical particles ""Dust,"" Lyra finds herself in the middle of the fierce struggle involving beautiful and commanding Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). And young Lyra is yet to know that the results of the battles may determine the fate of her world and ours too.Set in the parallel universe where everyone has his/her own ""daemons,"" ""The Golden Compass"" centers on Lyra and her long journey to the North. The film has a variety of supporting characters including cowboy aeronaut Lee Scoresby (Sam Shepherd) and great armoured polar bear Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen). Unfortunately, however, we have little time to know these characters. Gorgeous Eva Green appears as green-eyed witch Serafina Pekkala, but she has little to do in the story. And if you blink your eyes, you may miss Christopher Lee.Sometimes ""The Golden Compass"" seems only providing the backgrounds for its subsequent films and has forgotten to tell its own story. Lyra remains attractive, and so is Mrs. Coulter, thanks to the superb performances from Richards and Kidman, but there is no character development. The concept of ""daemons"" is not fully developed and though the idea of ""Alethiometer"" or the Golden Compass is intriguing, the process of Lyra's decoding it could have been made more so.""The Golden Compass"" is part of the trilogy written by Philip Pullman. I hear many complaints from the original book's fans who claim the book is much better. Not having read the book, I cannot say anything about it, but maybe director Chris Weitz is trying to please everyone. If so, he shouldn't. Perhaps he should have brought in his own vision and interpretation of Lyra and her journey. ""The Golden Compass"" is not a bad film at all.

The special effects are truly wonderful and first rate and is really the only thing that keeps your interest.The plot is all over the place and jumbled. And it is certainly not helped by the awful editing. It jumps way too quickly from scene to scene and we never really know how much time has passed. That is probably the biggest flaw of the film, next to the script.Furthermore, the ending that pretty much leaves off in the middle of nowhere is desperately in need of a sequel. But from what I have heard, since the movie turned out to be not so profitable, no word of a second movie has been heard, which is unfortuate.

I've always believed that the ability to make animal's lips move does not preclude the need for good storytelling. And this movie has attention-deficit storytelling. This thing jumps all over the place. Since this film is aimed squarely at youth, it leaves little question as to the origin of ""Attention Deficit Disorder"" in kids. But then, the drug companies makes millions selling a drug to pill-craving Americans to ""cure"" it, so everyone is happy, but that's another story. Every third scene in this film pauses to lay additional foundation ahead of the film before they have even solidly established where they currently are in the story. A movie that has to constantly explain itself as it goes along is a big tip-off that it doesn't know what it wants to be, or is trying to be too much but doesn't have a clue to how to manage it in two hours.

The technology keeps getting better every year, and this movie rides the wave. The bears are about as convincing as anything I've seen, down to the rippling of their thick hides when two crash together in combat. The adventure never stops, keeping a solid pace from one scene to the next, right to the very end.That's where the not-to-like part of the movie comes in. It seems to end about two chapters before where the book ended. That omission cut out one of the most dramatic sequences in the book, albeit an obvious cliff-hanger and sequel bait - maybe those scenes really do belong at the start of the inevitable next movie rather than the end of this one. One other scene translated badly to movie form, too: finding the ""cut"" child and what followed. The book's version was much darker, maybe a bit much for the film's intended audience. Those were probably the two most crucial scenes in the book. I'd say the movie got pretty much everything right except for those two scenes - the two that really mattered. Oh, and the scene where she discovers her parentage, that suffered badly in translation to the big screen, too.Like the plot elements, the characters were bleached to pale, bland ghosts of their book form. It's probably just as well. If Lyra had much of a real personality about her, it might have been hard to swallow her effortless skipping from one dramatic victory against crushing odds to the next. A real girl might have had a case of the nerves in single-handedly facing down hundreds of sword-bearing warriors and wolves, or in other of her dramatic moments. Just a little, at least. Not our Lyra - something as credible as a bit of fear or doubt would have smudged the Barbie-like slickness of our little heroine's image.It's fair adventure and fantasy, with lots for the eyes to enjoy. Not much gets past the optic nerve and into the thinking mind, though.-- wiredweird",3,Enjoyable fantasy,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,1992,"['lot', 'like', 'movie', 'let', 'start', 'there', 'CGI', 'outstanding', 'example', 'technology', 'getting', 'better', 'year', 'movie', 'wave', 'bears', 'are', 'as', 'convincing', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'down', 'rippling', 'thick', 'hides', 'when', 'two', 'crash', 'together', 'combat', 'adventure', 'never', 'keeping', 'solid', 'pace', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'right', 'very', 'end.That', 'where', 'not-to-like', 'part', 'movie', 'end', 'two', 'chapters', 'where', 'book', 'ended', 'omission', 'cut', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'dramatic', 'sequences', 'book', 'obvious', 'cliff-hanger', 'sequel', 'bait', 'maybe', 'scenes', 'really', 'do', 'belong', 'start', 'inevitable', 'next', 'movie', 'rather', 'end', 'one', 'One', 'other', 'scene', 'translated', 'badly', 'movie', 'form', 'too', 'finding', 'cut', 'child', 'what', 'followed', 'book', 'version', 'was', 'much', 'darker', 'maybe', 'bit', 'much', 'film', 'intended', 'audience', 'were', 'probably', 'two', 'most', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'book', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie', 'got', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'right', 'two', 'scenes', 'two', 'really', 'mattered', 'Oh', 'scene', 'where', 'parentage', 'suffered', 'badly', 'translation', 'big', 'screen', 'plot', 'elements', 'characters', 'were', 'bleached', 'pale', 'bland', 'ghosts', 'book', 'form', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Lyra', 'had', 'much', 'real', 'personality', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'swallow', 'effortless', 'skipping', 'one', 'dramatic', 'victory', 'crushing', 'odds', 'next', 'real', 'girl', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'case', 'nerves', 'single-handedly', 'facing', 'down', 'hundreds', 'sword-bearing', 'warriors', 'wolves', 'other', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Just', 'little', 'least', 'Not', 'Lyra', 'something', 'as', 'credible', 'bit', 'fear', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'smudged', 'Barbie-like', 'slickness', 'little', 'heroine', 'image.It', 'fair', 'adventure', 'fantasy', 'lots', 'eyes', 'enjoy', 'Not', 'much', 'optic', 'nerve', 'thinking', 'mind', 'though.', 'wiredweird']",The Golden Compass

Character development, poor in the books, is of course worse in the movie. But most significant in comparison between the book and film is the avoidance entirely of who the Magisterium represents and so who the war is really against. As a result the plot must seem simply baffling to those who have not read the trilogy. The bears become the most interesting thing and it makes sense why an Oscar went in that direction. In short, this one is not a keeper. I have no interest in watching it again to seek nuances I might have missed nor would I be interested in seeing the other two books treated the same way. But as an interesting movie for kids it was beautifully done.
