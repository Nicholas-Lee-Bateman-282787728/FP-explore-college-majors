I enjoyed especially the colorful settings and the excellent acting.  I was so moved by the movie that I decided to read a biography about Aylward.  I wanted to find out what finally happened between her and her beloved.  Alas!  I was disappointed to learn that the romantic aspects of her real life story were unlike those depicted in the movie.  I'm sure that Hollywood felt it was necessary to tell the story in such a way as to satisfy the emotional needs of audiences, and I don't entirely fault the movie-makers for doing that.  I've decided to appreciate the movie story and Gladys's real life story as two, more or less separate entities, both of which are compelling and inspiring.  A lot of the movie IS true to the real facts of the life of this woman who lived out such an extraordinary destiny.  The movie is, in my estimation, a classic to cherish.  I like to watch it over again every couple of years.",5,A Christian woman's love for China,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,1039,"['loved', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'ways', 'told', 'enthralling', 'story', 'Gladys', 'Aylward', 'experiences', 'China', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'colorful', 'settings', 'excellent', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'movie', 'decided', 'read', 'biography', 'Aylward', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'finally', 'happened', 'beloved', 'Alas', 'was', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'were', 'depicted', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Hollywood', 'felt', 'was', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'such', 'way', 'satisfy', 'emotional', 'needs', 'audiences', 'do', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'fault', 'movie-makers', 'doing', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'story', 'Gladys', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'two', 'more', 'less', 'separate', 'entities', 'are', 'compelling', 'inspiring', 'lot', 'movie', 'true', 'real', 'facts', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'out', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'destiny', 'movie', 'estimation', 'classic', 'cherish', 'like', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'couple', 'years']",N/A

Based on the true story of Gladys Aylward, a house maid in England who was &quot;not qualified&quot; to be sent to China as a missionary, so went there on her own, saving every shilling earned for a ticket on the Trans-Siberian railroad. Taking place in the pre-WWII era, it's an adventure story of great spiritual courage, the chaos of war, and a romance between two independent people who never thought they would find love.Ingrid Bergman is luminous as Gladys. It is one of her very best performances, and my personal favorite. Robert Donat, who passed away before the film was released, is also marvelous as the Mandarin of Yang Cheng, and Curt Jurgens as Captain Lin Nan is handsome and believable as the man who falls in love with Gladys. In a small but pivotal part, Athene Seyler is terrific as Jennie Lawson, the elderly missionary who helps Gladys in her early years, and Peter Chong is a delight as Yang the cook.It is odd that the only Oscar nomination went to director Mark Robson; perhaps Bergman was overlooked because she had received a &quot;Best Actress&quot; for &quot;Anastasia&quot; two years earlier, but Bergman fans will give this film their own five-star award.The fabulous location filming by Freddie Young was done in Snowdonia National Park, North Wales, a remarkable substitute for Shaanxi Province, in the heart of China. The village reproductions are very well done,  and look incredibly similar to films I have seen shot in China. The lovely score by Malcolm Arnold adds much to the film, and Alan Burgess, whose book &quot;The Small Woman&quot; is the basis of the story, wrote the script, which is witty, wise and wonderful, with Isobel Lennart.Many times I've laughed out loud , and many times I've cried watching this film; it's good for several viewings, as it is epic in scope, and the script has an intelligence that makes it a rare gem. total running time is 158 minutes.In the film, Chinese tradition has five &quot;Happiness&quot; wishes: Wealth, longevity, good health, virtue, and a peaceful old age and death.  &quot;Each person must decide in their heart what the sixth happiness is&quot;.",5,following God's call,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,2249,"['magnificent', 'film', 'aspect', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'landscapes', 'beautiful', 'drama', 'intense', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'Gladys', 'Aylward', 'house', 'maid', 'England', 'who', 'was', 'quot', 'not', 'qualified', 'quot', 'be', 'sent', 'China', 'missionary', 'so', 'went', 'there', 'own', 'saving', 'shilling', 'earned', 'ticket', 'Trans-Siberian', 'railroad', 'Taking', 'place', 'pre-WWII', 'era', 'adventure', 'story', 'great', 'spiritual', 'courage', 'chaos', 'war', 'romance', 'two', 'independent', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'find', 'love.Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'luminous', 'Gladys', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'performances', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'also', 'marvelous', 'Mandarin', 'Yang', 'Cheng', 'Curt', 'Jurgens', 'Captain', 'Lin', 'Nan', 'handsome', 'believable', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'Gladys', 'small', 'pivotal', 'part', 'Athene', 'Seyler', 'terrific', 'Jennie', 'Lawson', 'elderly', 'missionary', 'who', 'Gladys', 'early', 'years', 'Peter', 'Chong', 'delight', 'Yang', 'cook.It', 'odd', 'only', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'went', 'director', 'Mark', 'Robson', 'perhaps', 'Bergman', 'was', 'overlooked', 'had', 'received', 'quot', 'Best', 'Actress', 'quot', 'quot', 'Anastasia', 'quot', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'Bergman', 'fans', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'own', 'five-star', 'award.The', 'fabulous', 'location', 'filming', 'Freddie', 'Young', 'was', 'done', 'Snowdonia', 'National', 'Park', 'North', 'Wales', 'remarkable', 'substitute', 'Shaanxi', 'Province', 'heart', 'China', 'village', 'reproductions', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'look', 'incredibly', 'similar', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'shot', 'China', 'lovely', 'score', 'Malcolm', 'Arnold', 'much', 'film', 'Alan', 'Burgess', 'book', 'quot', 'Small', 'Woman', 'quot', 'basis', 'story', 'wrote', 'script', 'witty', 'wise', 'wonderful', 'Isobel', 'Lennart.Many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'cried', 'watching', 'film', 'good', 'several', 'viewings', 'epic', 'scope', 'script', 'intelligence', 'rare', 'gem', 'total', 'running', 'time', '158', 'minutes.In', 'film', 'Chinese', 'tradition', 'five', 'quot', 'Happiness', 'quot', 'wishes', 'Wealth', 'longevity', 'good', 'health', 'virtue', 'peaceful', 'old', 'age', 'death', 'quot', 'person', 'must', 'decide', 'heart', 'what', 'sixth', 'happiness', 'quot']",N/A
351775,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6303037380,Byron Kolln,"[8, 8]","THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS tells the story of one ""Small Woman"" who helped to change the course of a whole country.  Based on true events, the movie stars Ingrid Bergman as Gladys Aylward, a parlour-maid in England who wants to become a Chinese missionary.  Leaving her job in Liverpool, Gladys travels to London and the mission society, only to be told she's simply not qualified for life overseas.  While the society finds her a new position in London, Gladys still clings to her dream of going to China, and saves her money to buy a passage on the Trans-Siberian railway.Finally in China's province of Wang-Cheng, Gladys joins up with missionary Mrs Lawson (Athene Seyler) and together they open an inn for traveling muleteers, called The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, where people can get a hot meal, a place to sleep, and hear stories from the Bible.  When Gladys queries her on the sixth happiness, Mrs Lawson replies ""Each person decides in his own heart what the sixth happiness is"".  While Gladys is initially unwelcomed by the villagers, she's soon taken in and loved by everybody, including the Mandarin (Robert Donat in his final role); as well as the handsome Eurasian, Captain Lin Nan (Curd Jurgens).Life in Wang-Cheng continues it's natural path for Gladys and the other villagers, until Japanese forces threaten to invade, and the lives of innocent people are endangered.  The Mandarin orders the entire village to flee for the hills, and in a tearful sequence, he says farewell to his 'Jenai'.  But Gladys' most important mission is yet to come.  She must lead 100 children over the mountains to the safety of a Christian missionary school.Based on ""The Small Woman"" by Alan Burgess, THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS was a very successful movie, but it did change a lot of historical truths in favour of Hollywood fantasy.  The real Gladys Aylward was appalled at the alleged romance between her character and Captain Nan; but of course the film works better if we know that Gladys is a complete woman with romantic inclinations (Bergman and Jurgens have good chemistry too).  The location filming was done throughout North Wales and London (and the locations do create a convincing sense of being in China).Robert Donat died before the movie was released.  He's so wonderful as the Mandarin, you just want to get up and hug him in that final scene!  Curd Jurgens is equally fine as Lin.  Ingrid Bergman brings all her best qualities and strengths to the role of Gladys; this is one of her best performances.  Despite her work, Bergman was not nominated for an Academy Award, probably because of her recent win for ""Anastasia"".  The film was directed by Mark Robson, following his work in ""Peyton Place"" the previous year.  He acquits himself nicely here; and while the scenes often border on epic, in essence it is a small story about one ""small woman"".You'll adore this inspirational and heart-warming movie masterpiece.",4,"one ""small woman"" can move the world...",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2939,"['INN', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'HAPPINESS', 'story', 'one', 'Small', 'Woman', 'who', 'helped', 'change', 'course', 'whole', 'country', 'Based', 'true', 'events', 'movie', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Gladys', 'Aylward', 'parlour-maid', 'England', 'who', 'become', 'Chinese', 'missionary', 'Leaving', 'job', 'Liverpool', 'Gladys', 'London', 'mission', 'society', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'simply', 'not', 'qualified', 'life', 'overseas', 'society', 'new', 'position', 'London', 'Gladys', 'still', 'dream', 'going', 'China', 'money', 'buy', 'passage', 'Trans-Siberian', 'railway.Finally', 'China', 'province', 'Wang-Cheng', 'Gladys', 'up', 'missionary', 'Mrs', 'Lawson', 'Athene', 'Seyler', 'together', 'open', 'inn', 'traveling', 'muleteers', 'called', 'Inn', 'Sixth', 'Happiness', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'get', 'hot', 'meal', 'place', 'sleep', 'hear', 'stories', 'Bible', 'When', 'Gladys', 'sixth', 'happiness', 'Mrs', 'Lawson', 'person', 'own', 'heart', 'what', 'sixth', 'happiness', 'Gladys', 'initially', 'unwelcomed', 'villagers', 'soon', 'taken', 'loved', 'everybody', 'including', 'Mandarin', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'final', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'handsome', 'Eurasian', 'Captain', 'Lin', 'Nan', 'Curd', 'Jurgens', '.Life', 'Wang-Cheng', 'natural', 'path', 'Gladys', 'other', 'villagers', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'threaten', 'invade', 'lives', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'endangered', 'Mandarin', 'orders', 'entire', 'village', 'flee', 'hills', 'tearful', 'sequence', 'farewell', ""'Jenai"", 'Gladys', 'most', 'important', 'mission', 'yet', 'come', 'must', 'lead', '100', 'children', 'mountains', 'safety', 'Christian', 'missionary', 'school.Based', 'Small', 'Woman', 'Alan', 'Burgess', 'THE', 'INN', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'HAPPINESS', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'movie', 'did', 'change', 'lot', 'historical', 'truths', 'favour', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy', 'real', 'Gladys', 'Aylward', 'was', 'appalled', 'alleged', 'romance', 'character', 'Captain', 'Nan', 'course', 'film', 'better', 'know', 'Gladys', 'complete', 'woman', 'romantic', 'inclinations', 'Bergman', 'Jurgens', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'too', 'location', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'North', 'Wales', 'London', 'locations', 'do', 'create', 'convincing', 'sense', 'being', 'China', '.Robert', 'Donat', 'died', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Mandarin', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'hug', 'final', 'scene', 'Curd', 'Jurgens', 'equally', 'fine', 'Lin', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'best', 'qualities', 'strengths', 'role', 'Gladys', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'work', 'Bergman', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'probably', 'recent', 'win', 'Anastasia', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Mark', 'Robson', 'following', 'work', 'Peyton', 'Place', 'previous', 'year', 'nicely', 'here', 'scenes', 'often', 'border', 'epic', 'essence', 'small', 'story', 'one', 'small', 'woman', ""'ll"", 'adore', 'inspirational', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'masterpiece']",N/A
351776,A35LWA8VY66G8F,6303037380,Daniel G. Madigan,"[12, 13]","Ingrid Bergman took on this task thinking that it would be a great tribute to a true missionary from China, Gladys Alywood. But Gladys hated the film that everybody else loves.It is a broad interpretation but so senitive to detail and to the reality of missionary life that it rings true at every turn. Ingrid Bergaman rarely goes wrong, and here she goes completely right. Her humility, her devotion to the children she cares for,  and especially her interaction with the old mandarin, Robert Donat, who would actually die very soon after that last scene she had with him was completed, is a marvel..Ingrid Bergman knew that Donat would die soon, and her tears at his imminent death are there in the film, but integrated into the scene with him and his farewell to the village. The control here and the acting through all of it, show how Ingrid Bergman makes art out of real pathos, submits to the calling of her profession as an actress, and yet lets us see the real, only a glimpse, that touches on a real tragedy off screen, which she brings on screen.The score is first rate, and it underlines events well, especially when the story line threatens to become superficial. But Ingfrid Bergman and Curt Jergens as well, manage this all with great style.

351777,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,6303037380,Phillip Oliver,"[48, 54]","Overlong but fairly engrossing bio of Gladys Aylward, an English-woman who, despite her lack of qualifications, becomes a missionary in China. The film is episodic and covers Aylward's brief career as a parlor maid (saving money for her trip to China), her journey to China, her work at the Inn of the Sixth Happiness and the Chinese-Japanese war which results in her guiding 100+ children in an arduous journey through the mountains to a safer village. I didn't find the film as moving as other reviewers but it is well mounted and nice to look at. Bergman is outstanding as are other supporting players, most notably Curt Jergens and Robert Donat. This was Donat's last film (he died before it was released) and his last screen words are prophetic - &quot;We shall not see each other again, I think. Farewell.&quot;What is most notable about this dvd release is the excellent commentary by Nick Redman, Aubrey Solomon and Donald Spoto. Redman talks about the real Gladys Aylward, Solomon talks about the film production and Spoto discusses Ingrid Bergman. There were many things changed for the film version and many of them are small and inexplicable. For example, Aylward's given Chinese name was Ai-weh-deh (not Jenai), an adopted child was actually named Ninepence (Sixpense in the movie), etc. Other changes were more larger in scope - Aylward's journey to China was quite harsh and she almost died several times. The inn-keeper, Jeanne Lawson (memorably played by Athene Seyler) was no as agreeable a woman as portrayed in the film - she was actually a cantankerous person prone to fits and thought to be quite mad by the villagers. Aylward herself was thought by many to be fanatical and to put it bluntly, off her rocker. Many other fascinating aspects about the film and the women (both Aylward and Bergman) are included.",4,Bergman shines in religious epic,1061769600,"08 25, 2003",2003,1832,"['Overlong', 'fairly', 'engrossing', 'bio', 'Gladys', 'Aylward', 'English-woman', 'who', 'lack', 'qualifications', 'missionary', 'China', 'film', 'episodic', 'Aylward', 'brief', 'career', 'parlor', 'maid', 'saving', 'money', 'trip', 'China', 'journey', 'China', 'work', 'Inn', 'Sixth', 'Happiness', 'Chinese-Japanese', 'war', 'results', 'guiding', '100+', 'children', 'arduous', 'journey', 'mountains', 'safer', 'village', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'as', 'moving', 'other', 'reviewers', 'well', 'mounted', 'nice', 'look', 'Bergman', 'outstanding', 'are', 'other', 'supporting', 'players', 'most', 'notably', 'Curt', 'Jergens', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'was', 'Donat', 'last', 'film', 'died', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'screen', 'words', 'are', 'prophetic', 'quot', 'shall', 'not', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'think', 'Farewell.', 'quot', 'What', 'most', 'notable', 'dvd', 'release', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'Nick', 'Redman', 'Aubrey', 'Solomon', 'Donald', 'Spoto', 'Redman', 'real', 'Gladys', 'Aylward', 'Solomon', 'film', 'production', 'Spoto', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'changed', 'film', 'version', 'many', 'are', 'small', 'inexplicable', 'example', 'Aylward', 'given', 'Chinese', 'name', 'was', 'Ai-weh-deh', 'not', 'Jenai', 'adopted', 'child', 'was', 'actually', 'named', 'Ninepence', 'Sixpense', 'movie', 'etc', 'Other', 'changes', 'were', 'more', 'larger', 'scope', 'Aylward', 'journey', 'China', 'was', 'quite', 'harsh', 'almost', 'died', 'several', 'times', 'inn-keeper', 'Jeanne', 'Lawson', 'memorably', 'played', 'Athene', 'Seyler', 'was', 'agreeable', 'woman', 'portrayed', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'cantankerous', 'person', 'prone', 'fits', 'thought', 'be', 'quite', 'mad', 'villagers', 'Aylward', 'was', 'thought', 'many', 'be', 'fanatical', 'put', 'bluntly', 'off', 'rocker', 'Many', 'other', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'film', 'women', 'Aylward', 'Bergman', 'are', 'included']",N/A
