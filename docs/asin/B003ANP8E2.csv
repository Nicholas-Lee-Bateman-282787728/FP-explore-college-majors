What an incredibly disappointing letdown.  The movie destroyed the book in every possible way. For starters, anyone who hasn't read the book would find it near impossible to follow the storyline or understand John Rain's underlying background (critical to the entire series) and modus operandi.  I suppose the director assumed everyone had already read the novel.John Rain is known as a ""shadow"" assassin for hire.  ""Shadow"" because he is able to clandestinely operate throughout society with almost ghost-like stealth.  The director must have taken ""shadow"" literally and shot the film in near darkness.  It was hard to visually see (not just watch) the movie.The pace of the film was molasses-like.  Painfully slow.  The director replaced most of the book's action sequences with insipid meaningless mood-setting (mood-killing) dialogue.  The best scene was at the end where John Rain goes into a biker-bar (something not in the original novel) where some good ass-kicking is about to happen.  Great buildup and just before the anticipated action is about to unfold......the film ends.I could go on but I am just grateful that I chose to rent the movie instead of purchasing it.  Wish I had skipped it entirely so as not to diminish my great respect for the series.  Barry Eisler must not have had veto authority (or any say whatsoever) when he sold the movie rights.  I'm betting that all of the 1-star reviews are from fans who first read the book then had the misfortune to watch the movie.",1,What a Dog of a Movie!,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1618,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Barry', 'Eisler', 'have', 'enthusiastically', 'read', 'entire', 'John', 'Rain', 'series', 'Could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'What', 'incredibly', 'disappointing', 'letdown', 'movie', 'destroyed', 'book', 'possible', 'way', 'starters', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'would', 'find', 'impossible', 'follow', 'storyline', 'understand', 'John', 'Rain', 'underlying', 'background', 'critical', 'entire', 'series', 'operandi', 'suppose', 'director', 'assumed', 'everyone', 'had', 'already', 'read', 'novel.John', 'Rain', 'known', 'shadow', 'assassin', 'hire', 'Shadow', 'able', 'clandestinely', 'operate', 'society', 'almost', 'ghost-like', 'stealth', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'shadow', 'literally', 'shot', 'film', 'near', 'darkness', 'was', 'hard', 'visually', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'watch', 'movie.The', 'pace', 'film', 'was', 'molasses-like', 'Painfully', 'slow', 'director', 'replaced', 'most', 'book', 'action', 'sequences', 'insipid', 'meaningless', 'mood-setting', 'mood-killing', 'dialogue', 'best', 'scene', 'was', 'end', 'where', 'John', 'Rain', 'biker-bar', 'something', 'not', 'original', 'novel', 'where', 'good', 'ass-kicking', 'happen', 'Great', 'buildup', 'just', 'anticipated', 'action', 'unfold', 'film', 'ends.I', 'could', 'go', 'am', 'just', 'grateful', 'chose', 'rent', 'movie', 'instead', 'purchasing', 'Wish', 'had', 'skipped', 'entirely', 'so', 'not', 'diminish', 'great', 'respect', 'series', 'Barry', 'Eisler', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'veto', 'authority', 'say', 'whatsoever', 'when', 'sold', 'movie', 'rights', ""'m"", 'betting', '1-star', 'reviews', 'are', 'fans', 'who', 'first', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'had', 'misfortune', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A
1334855,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B003ANP8E2,G. Teslovich,"[3, 3]","I knew this movie was in trouble when:(a.) I see a professional assassin pointing a gun with the intent of shooting someone from a reasonable 10 foot distance walk up to within arm's length of the victim - first dumb.  The result is having the victim move their entire arm 3 feet faster than the professional assassin can move their finger 2 mm and he loses the gun - second dumb. Then he loses his life - third dumb.(b.) The CIA covert operation looks like a midday luncheon with a couple of staff in a secretary's office - fourth dumb.(c.) A dozen cheap flat screen TVs meant to represent CCTV camera coverage of all of Tokyo and a part of Japan. I haven't checked recently but aren't there quite a few people in Tokyo? And, aren't there a couple of spots where cameras aren't located? Let's see, my math skills suggest that at least a million cameras would be needed to cover what was indicated in the movie and imagine following all that on twelve screens not only in real time but also in viewing archived video - five+ million dumbs.(d.) The main coverup plot in this movie was that the Americans are trying to figure out how to lift importing restrictions so they can sell more of their cars and rice to Japan. Give me a break Japan doesn't need poorly made cars and contaminated rice. Besides I would think they would be more concerned about truly competitive imports from Korea and China and the rest of the Far East - more dumb.(e.) If the CIA is as loud, obnoxious, mistake prone and out of control as was represented by Oldman then the CIA is truly as dumb as many people believe they are - in fact they're (100,000+ textbook memorizing, B.A. diploma on a cubicle, white collar desk sitters) dumb dumb.",1,This is how you use a gun.,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1714,"['knew', 'movie', 'was', 'trouble', 'when', 'see', 'professional', 'assassin', 'pointing', 'gun', 'intent', 'shooting', 'someone', 'reasonable', '10', 'foot', 'distance', 'walk', 'arm', 'length', 'victim', 'first', 'dumb', 'result', 'having', 'victim', 'move', 'entire', 'arm', '3', 'feet', 'faster', 'professional', 'assassin', 'can', 'move', 'finger', '2', 'mm', 'gun', 'second', 'dumb', 'Then', 'life', 'third', 'dumb.', 'b', 'CIA', 'covert', 'operation', 'midday', 'luncheon', 'couple', 'staff', 'secretary', 'office', 'fourth', 'dumb.', 'c', 'dozen', 'cheap', 'flat', 'screen', 'TVs', 'meant', 'represent', 'CCTV', 'camera', 'coverage', 'Tokyo', 'part', 'Japan', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'recently', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'Tokyo', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'couple', 'spots', 'where', 'cameras', 'are', ""n't"", 'located', 'Let', 'see', 'math', 'skills', 'suggest', 'least', 'million', 'cameras', 'would', 'be', 'needed', 'cover', 'what', 'was', 'indicated', 'movie', 'imagine', 'following', 'twelve', 'screens', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'time', 'also', 'viewing', 'archived', 'video', 'five+', 'million', 'dumbs.', 'd', 'main', 'coverup', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'Americans', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'lift', 'importing', 'restrictions', 'can', 'sell', 'more', 'cars', 'rice', 'Japan', 'Give', 'break', 'Japan', ""n't"", 'need', 'poorly', 'made', 'cars', 'contaminated', 'rice', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'truly', 'competitive', 'imports', 'Korea', 'China', 'rest', 'Far', 'East', 'more', 'dumb.', 'e', 'CIA', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'mistake', 'prone', 'control', 'was', 'represented', 'Oldman', 'then', 'CIA', 'truly', 'as', 'dumb', 'many', 'people', 'believe', 'are', 'fact', ""'re"", '100,000+', 'textbook', 'memorizing', 'B.A', 'diploma', 'cubicle', 'white', 'collar', 'desk', 'sitters', 'dumb', 'dumb']",N/A

I generally don't mind subtitles.  However, this was not billed as a foreign film?  The majority of the dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles, except for when Gary Oldman rants in American accent or the John Rain character speaks acceted English (was he not born and raised in the US?)2.)
