Both movies have hate inspired themes played to grotesque proportions, both movies speak to those who hate and enjoy hating.  This movie can be summed up in one cliche: ""Preaches to the Choir.""  Well, ok, this isn't a movie, it is a ""point of view"" waste of time.  People called the first Left Behind movie preachy!  Well, maybe and maybe not, but this movie does the same in that it preaches to what atheists and other fascists wish to hear--why they should continue to hate.  If you really wanted to bring about discussion, you would have not been so fearful to not bring your (you the movie makers) questions and your remarks to people like Billy Graham and Josh McDowell and Dr. David Stern (a Messianic Jew) and Ravi Zacharias and Doctor James Dobson.  Let's see how high and mighty you (the film makers) find yourselves after talking to these individuals of the Christian church today.  I'd be the first to want to see your reaction to the truth of the Bible presented by such men as these.  Instead, you bring up paper thin reasons to hate any and all Christians solely because they are Christians, and just let it drop there...while thumping your chest acting as if you were silverbacks!

955798,A1O3RACPMOQY4N,B000CAPZBC,Amazon Customer,"[16, 23]","Brian Flemming has made an interesting and entertaining documentary film that explores important issues, but its effectiveness is undermined by his narrow view of the questions and some errors of fact and logic.He makes the common mistake of assuming that the Bible, and particularly the New Testament, must be taken literally or rejected. Some theologians, notably John Shelby Spong, speak of a different approach, of taking the writings ""seriously, but not literally."" Flemming never demonstrates any understanding that the question need not be either/or.It is true that the gospels are heavily mythologized, and that there are probably only a few echoes of the earthly life of Jesus reflected in them. It doesn't follow from that, as Flemming believes, that a historical Jesus didn't exist.He seems to base some of his conclusions about the purported ignorance of modern Christians on scant evidence. After showing two or three brief interviews in which believers only have a vague idea of how Christianity spread, he concludes that Christians, as a group, just don't know. That may be true or may not, but he doesn't prove the case.The documentary is weakened by some factual errors and faulty reasoning. Among the more important ones:* He says, correctly, that Mark was the first gospel to be written, and then incorrectly that the other three are derived from Mark. Only Matthew and Luke use Marcan material in their accounts. John is from a completely different strand of tradition. For a documentarian to make such a basic error throws his more sophisticated analysis into doubt.* He claims that Paul ""does not know"" of the events of Jesus's earthly life, based on the fact the Paul doesn't mention those events in his epistles. That does not logically follow. Given that Paul was writing to groups of Christians in various parts of the world, mostly to address specific issues they were dealing with at the time, it may simply be that they already knew the story and didn't need it repeated.* He believes the book of Hebrews is one of Paul's letters. It is not. Again, this suggests a lack of rigor in his research.There are parts of the film that are far more effective. He ably demonstrates the intolerance and ignorance of the religious right. Then again, it's an easy target. He's completely right, but the point is completely obvious (to anyone who isn't part of he religious right, anyway, and they won't be persuaded.) He also does a good job of showing the delusions of those who believe Armageddon is near and interpret current events as fulfillment of Bible prophecy. But again, that's fish in a barrel.But then he goes right off the rails to criticize moderate Christianity for not taking the Bible literally in all ways, as the fundamentalists do.  This again betrays his binary thinking, that it is all literally true or else worthless. Many contemporary theologians would say the Bible is the record of primitive human beings trying to understand God, rather than the inerrant word of God. Flemming doesn't address that idea at all.Flemming makes a good case against fundamentalism, and in this time where fundamentalists have unprecedented and dangerous influence over American politics, that's important. But he ultimately fails to prove much of anything else, so the value of the film is limited.Flemming once was a fundamentalist, and I suspect that is the source of his either/or approach. Sadly, that means he is still a fundamentalist, because he still has not learned any other way to think.",3,"Interesting, but fatally flawed",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,3522,"['Brian', 'Flemming', 'made', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'film', 'important', 'issues', 'effectiveness', 'undermined', 'narrow', 'view', 'questions', 'errors', 'fact', 'logic.He', 'common', 'mistake', 'assuming', 'Bible', 'particularly', 'New', 'Testament', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'literally', 'rejected', 'theologians', 'notably', 'John', 'Shelby', 'Spong', 'speak', 'different', 'approach', 'taking', 'writings', 'seriously', 'not', 'literally', 'Flemming', 'never', 'understanding', 'question', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'either/or.It', 'true', 'gospels', 'are', 'heavily', 'mythologized', 'are', 'probably', 'only', 'few', 'echoes', 'earthly', 'life', 'Jesus', 'reflected', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Flemming', 'historical', 'Jesus', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist.He', 'base', 'conclusions', 'purported', 'ignorance', 'modern', 'Christians', 'scant', 'evidence', 'showing', 'two', 'three', 'brief', 'interviews', 'believers', 'only', 'have', 'vague', 'idea', 'how', 'Christianity', 'spread', 'Christians', 'group', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'may', 'not', ""n't"", 'prove', 'case.The', 'documentary', 'weakened', 'factual', 'errors', 'faulty', 'reasoning', 'more', 'important', 'ones', '*', 'correctly', 'Mark', 'was', 'first', 'gospel', 'be', 'written', 'then', 'incorrectly', 'other', 'three', 'are', 'derived', 'Mark', 'Only', 'Matthew', 'Luke', 'use', 'Marcan', 'material', 'accounts', 'John', 'completely', 'different', 'strand', 'tradition', 'documentarian', 'make', 'such', 'basic', 'error', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'analysis', 'doubt', 'Paul', 'not', 'know', 'events', 'Jesus', 'earthly', 'life', 'based', 'fact', 'Paul', ""n't"", 'mention', 'events', 'epistles', 'not', 'logically', 'follow', 'Given', 'Paul', 'was', 'writing', 'groups', 'Christians', 'various', 'parts', 'world', 'mostly', 'address', 'specific', 'issues', 'were', 'dealing', 'time', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'already', 'knew', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'repeated', '*', 'book', 'Hebrews', 'one', 'Paul', 'letters', 'not', 'Again', 'lack', 'rigor', 'research.There', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'ably', 'intolerance', 'ignorance', 'religious', 'right', 'Then', 'again', 'easy', 'target', 'completely', 'right', 'point', 'completely', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'part', 'religious', 'right', 'anyway', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'persuaded', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'delusions', 'who', 'believe', 'Armageddon', 'near', 'interpret', 'current', 'events', 'fulfillment', 'Bible', 'prophecy', 'again', 'fish', 'barrel.But', 'then', 'right', 'rails', 'criticize', 'moderate', 'Christianity', 'not', 'taking', 'Bible', 'literally', 'ways', 'fundamentalists', 'do', 'again', 'binary', 'thinking', 'literally', 'true', 'else', 'worthless', 'Many', 'contemporary', 'theologians', 'would', 'say', 'Bible', 'record', 'primitive', 'human', 'beings', 'trying', 'understand', 'God', 'rather', 'inerrant', 'word', 'God', 'Flemming', ""n't"", 'address', 'idea', 'all.Flemming', 'good', 'case', 'fundamentalism', 'time', 'where', 'fundamentalists', 'have', 'unprecedented', 'dangerous', 'influence', 'American', 'politics', 'important', 'ultimately', 'prove', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'value', 'film', 'limited.Flemming', 'once', 'was', 'fundamentalist', 'suspect', 'source', 'either/or', 'approach', 'Sadly', 'still', 'fundamentalist', 'still', 'not', 'learned', 'other', 'way', 'think']",The God Who Wasn't There

I liked the very in-depth details he brought up about dates in history and how they correspond with the bible. He made some interesting points about the lack of knowledge and information about the time after Christ as well.Just when I was really starting to find his data credible, he ended the movie with an interview that bombed it for me. The man who runs the Christian School he attended growing up agreed to talk on camera with him. When he realized he had been duped into a debate on religion, he said that he was not going to continue because he (the films creator) was just doing this because he was ""angry for being punished"" for something he had done while attending school there. If the director had mentioned anything about what that issue from the past was, it might have lended more credibility to the film. But since nothing about this was mentioned, it leaves one wondering if he really just getting back at the school.What was this thing that happened and why doesn't he mention it to clear up that this is not the issue at hand? It seems an important thing to include if your trying to de-bunk 2000+ years of religious history. Ending the film without this tiny bit of information left me feeling that this was nothing more than an angry former student from this school who wanted to publicly tell them all that they were wrong.What saves this movie from being a 2 star and brings it up to a 3 star is the on-camera interviews with other authors.

Ort ""aorto""","[9, 13]","This is basically a film about a guy who has lost his faith, has educated himself in Christianity vs. Paganism 101 and the apparent similarity (i.e. borrowing, stealing, whatever) of Jesus to the pagan myths of the cultures in which it embedded itself and decided to make a film about it, attempting to pass it off as an accurate historical record.  There is a sense of bitterness attendant with it which is apparent in his cynical little digs at the faith and those who profess belief in it.  Then again, there are many out there who feel as he does.The first twenty minutes are stunning (and quite humorous), especially when the list of pagan gods/figures rolls on and their similarities to Jesus are brought out in an onslaught of information.  This is where the film is most effective as it is revelatory and eye opening.His choice of scholars/characters (e.g. Robert Price, Richard Dawkins sided with quotes from goofy Christian fundies, e.g. Jerry Falwell, and naive Christians) is one-sided and any attempt at a balanced film is lopsided; of course,it's pretty clear up front what the film maker is attempting to say and objectivity isn't one of them.He falls prey to certain simplistic arguments that are passed around in critical circles, taking them as absolutes, even though they are simplified aphorisms that have been filtered down from the ivory towers of academia to the masses.  For example, he narrates:""Paul doesn't believe that Jesus was ever a human being. He's not even aware of the idea.""This is a fallacious argument, an argument from silence.  Just because it seems Paul does not make mention of a ""human"" Jesus (he gives no indication that Jesus is not human) does not mean he is not aware of the idea.  That is like taking the words of the Bible to the opposite extreme that fundamentalists take it.What this does is make Paul sound as if he is preaching just another pagan deity, which, of course, is the point the director is trying to make.  But if both sides are studied in some depth the shallowness of this quote becomes clear.  But the statement is pithy enough, and simple enough, that it can become a sound byte for those who seek to discredit Paul and, by extension, Christianity as a whole.The music (kind of a techno/electronica thing), the editing and the overall pace of the film is slick, though there's a certain smugness of the narrator/director that is a bit disconcerting at times.  But it's his film.  It's worth watching though it ultimately says little that hasn't already been said.  Still a brave document that would have been unheard of not too long ago.His pseudo-documentary ""Nothing So Strange"" about the murder of Bill Gates and the hysteria of conspiracy theories (a la JFK) is an interesting watch as well.

955802,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B000CAPZBC,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 8]","I'm not a Christian or Atheist, but I love hearing about the history of the Bible and interpretations of what could have ""really"" happened. Books like The Gods of Eden, Misquoting Jesus, Who Wrote the Bible? and Fingerprints of the Gods are literature that I usually recommend to anyone who's in the same boat as me. I never try to push my own personal beliefs on anyone unless they really, really want to know what I believe in (this rarely goes well when it happens), but I sure as heck don't go around trying to debunk what someone honestly believes in. Why should I? Everyone has a right to believe in something. That being said, The God Who Wasn't There disappointed me in several big ways, with one of the big ones being that it came off as a documentary made by a video site commenter who shoots down anyone who says they believe in Jesus. The only good things I can say about this documentary are small things that I found interesting, which include the number of non-violent minutes in The Passion of the Christ and a few semi-book recommendations.The documentary starts out somewhat decent: it gives a little timeline of Jesus' early years, then points out a gap in time where he was seemingly missing, and asks several Christians questions about how Christianity expanded once Jesus was gone. Everyone has the same answer more or less, that it was spread by word of mouth and through the Holy Spirit. This answer isn't good enough for Brian Flemming, the narrator and director. Suddenly we go off track from talking about Jesus and that space of time where he was gone, which would've been interesting, to him trying to shoot down various passages, pointing out the flaws in Christian schools, and just throwing together a bunch of old news clips of absurd people talking about how we need to lead America in god's name or something like that (you know, the people that give Christians a bad name similarly to how people with the mindset of Flemming give Atheists a bad name). Fortunately, Brian chose to interview a couple of people who are educated in not just the Bible, but other topics like folklore as well. The most interesting part of this documentary is an interview with Alan Dundes, author of Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore. Alan points out a couple of things that make you think, including his 'Greek hero pattern' that you can do a quick search for and go from there. The documentary reaches a quaint climax, for lack of better term, where Flemming goes back to his old Christian school and asks one of the people in charge about how they can teach young children about god and the Bible when there's no definitive proof that any of it happened. Honestly, it seems like the guy isn't giving him the overreaction that he was hoping for, and Flemming keeps pushing question upon question upon him until the interview finally gets cut short.At about an hour long, The God Who Wasn't There is a giant mess only worth watching under certain circumstances. If you're the kind of person that rubs your hands together and licks your lips when you merely hear someone talk about god, then rush in to shoot them down (be it in-person or, more likely, online), this is the kind of thing you will eat up no matter what. If you're a skeptic looking for an informative documentary, keep looking and save your time by passing this movie and going with a good book instead. Or, if you're planning on making a religious documentary, you definitely should see The God Who Wasn't There, to serve as an example of what not to do. Others have been kind enough to not dock the score for the production values and how it was produced, but I won't be so nice. Between generic laid back DJ music that sounds like it's a demo program on a keyboard, to the horrible way the movie is narrated with an ""uh"" breaking up nearly every sentence, and how there's no set topic, there's nothing that the movie does right, aside from showing some cool clips of old Jesus movies, which was probably the most expensive part of making this thing. I'll admit that I laughed when, for no reason, they pointed out the very low number of minutes in The Passion of the Christ where a bloody Jesus isn't shown, but after they were done and moved on, never going anywhere with that subject, it just irritated me even more. What, you simply wanted to point out that the best selling Jesus movie was the most violent one? That's it?It was a chore to sit through the whole thing, with each little annoyance pushing me to hit the stop button every couple of minutes. Brian Flemming comes off as a wanna-be Michael 'the Hutt' Moore or Morgan Spurlock. This documentary proves nothing and feels self-congratulatory, even at the end when it's noted how serious denying the Holy Spirit is, and goes the extra mile of saying he doesn't believe in it, apparently just to show off how 'smart' he is. Unfortunately I can't recommend any good documentaries about Christianity to watch over this one aside from the obvious Deliver Us From Evil and Jesus Camp. If you haven't seen either one yet, check 'em out. With The God Who Isn't There, there's nothing really objective because it never goes anywhere long enough.

That this adds another voice to the debate is surely positive - that we are still having the Judaeo-Christian god debate in 2012 is intellectually very sad indeed.Whilst there is no way to challenge believers (should one even wish to do so), no way to argue against blind faith or call people to account for value systems that guide both their lives and some elements of society and government, there is the historical record and THE historical record is something we can, or should be able to discuss rationally and academically as fellow beings seated around a table not screaming at each other on pavements or anonymously  posting hate on websites. That this film then doesn't really go any way to academically and anthropologically deconstructing the historical Jesus fable/myth/folklore (which is what it is) is something of a great shame because that is really all that can be achieved in an argument which is ultimately about personal beliefs and lifestyle aspirations.There is a body of scholarly evidence out there which can almost dismiss the existence of an historical Christ Jesus figure and it is really that which this platform should have been used to present as a cohesive hypothesis, a hypothesis which would then have been passed to the non-secular side of the table to refute a la. disjunctive syllogism, which by failing to be disproved would have proved the hypothesis accurate and authentic.

955804,A2VMT89TCSF105,B000CAPZBC,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[1, 1]","I've seen the shorter version of ""The god who wasn't there"" on Youtube. Perhaps the DVD version with additions is better, but the original documentary comes across as somewhat weak, if the purpose is to convince the viewer that Jesus was a myth.The interviews with Richard Carrier, Robert Price and Sam Harris are interesting, but only as appetizers. The theory that Jesus was a completely invented and fictitious character is considered ""out there"" even by mainline *secular* scholars such as Bart Ehrman. The narrator, Brian Flemming, seems to accept it wholesale, even claiming that Paul considered Jesus to be a purely mythical character, rather than a recently deceased, actual person! Such a bold statement requires a lot of additional discussion, lest it sounds Biblically illiterate...After declaring that Jesus wasn't there and hence is silent, Flemming attacks Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion of the Christ"", interviews a rapture-ready Christian blogger and finally reveals that he (Flemming) is a recovering fundamentalist. The documentary ends with a somewhat awkward interview with the principal of Flemming's old Bible school.""The god who wasn't there"" is essentially a movie about one man's journey out of fundamentalism, and some of the things that made him quit. Nothing wrong per se, but not what I expected either.

955805,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000CAPZBC,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","This is a documentary with a rather interesting point of view. Brian Flemming, who produced and narrated the film, was once a fundamentalist Christian. In fact, one of the most interesting segments is when he visits the Christian private school he attended as a child and interviews the director. The director states on film that he knows this will be seen by the public and he's OK with that. But when Flemming starts asking him uncomfortable questions, he asks him to turn off the recording and speak to him ""off the record."" When Flemming asks him why, he repeats his request to turn off the videotape, and then walks out of the camera range.He starts the film with a variety of quick questions for people out in front of a religious organization, but I'm afraid I don't remember which one. I think it was for a conference of some sort. He asks them questions about their religious knowledge and beliefs, and it becomes apparent that they are not very well informed about their own religion, let alone any others.Another interesting character is Scott Butcher, a born-again Christian who runs a web site [...] where you can have his computer prepare a letter to your friends and loved ones to be sent after the rapture to explain why you have disappeared. There's even a video version for $7.00. I don't know exactly how sincere he is, but apparently he's had thousands of responses. He says several people have prepared rapture letters for President Bush (this is 2005, remember), but that he, Butcher, is confident that the president will be raptured.There are a group of clips from old life of Jesus movies which Flemming uses to give a basic outline of the story of the gospels. These were pretty amusing. But he also discusses and extensively displays the Passion of Christ by Mel Gibson, where I had to turn my head. It is incredibly gory! He did a minute-by-minute study of the film, and pointed out that after the first ten minutes or so almost every minute there is something bloody on the screen. He points out that this must be what Christians want, because it was extremely popular, made a lot more money than other religious films, and was promoted by a lot of churches and other Christian organizations.Several biblical experts and philosophers are interviewed, including most famously Sam Harris. There's a professor of mythology from U.C. Berkeley, writers of several scholarly works about Christianity and biblical history, etc. It's an interesting collection, and they have some useful things to say.One of the most telling graphic presentations in the film is a time line of the biblical era. As various elements are positioned on the time line, certain interesting gaps become clear. If we take as a given that the life of Jesus was from 0 to 33 a.d., and accept that scholars are right in figuring the book of Matthew was written somewhere around 70 to 80 a.d., then the only ""testimony"" of the early period of the church is from Paul, formerly Saul of Tarsus. Saul was not an apostle, and in fact never met Jesus in the flesh. So very little indeed is known about the early church. Even the gospels (from say 70 to 120 a.d.), say little about the early church.I will not attempt to reproduce the arguments which the film examines, but I will say that the one hour and two minutes which make up the main feature is but the tip of the iceberg. There is actually considerably more material in the ""special features"" on this DVD. All of it fascinating, occasionally amusing, and sometimes infuriating.

The best part of this doc are the interviews with scholars such as folklore expert Alan Dundes and Jesus Seminar member Robert Price. These academics make a convincing case that the life of Jesus, as recorded in the Bible, was based on previous mythological stories, such as those about Zeus and Dionysus, rather than actual historical events. None of this scholarly evidence is particularly new or groundbreaking. But it is still likely to confound and disturb fundamentalist Christians.Unfortunately, Flemming's film making skills are way below those of such documentary directors as Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock. Fleming's approach lacks humor and he goes off on way too many tangents, such as his ""hatchet job"" interview with his former Christian school principal, that tend to detract from the strong central thesis that the life of Jesus is based on mythological sources.As an atheist I am definitely sympathetic to this film's point of view.

The documentary is filmed in a somewhat old school way that was slightly bothersome and the narrators voice is pretty monotonous which was a let down.  Also, the documentary portion of the film is less than an hour long, which surprised me because the I had read the DVD has 5 hours of footage.

955812,ACJVGDN8G386P,B000CAPZBC,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[8, 10]","""The God Who Wasn't There"" is not quite in the same league as Michael Moore's similar offerings, such as ""Bowling for Columbine"" or ""Sicko"". At 62 minutes running time, it felt like one-half of a documentary film that wasn't nearly finished. The film does not have the ample length to explore the subject that it sets out to uncover. I am not complaining about the subject matter per se, which is I think one that needs great delving into from all sides, and I applaud Flemming for tackling this most contoversial of subjects. And I will even say that I am somewhat politically and religiously on Flemming's side. However, the entire experience seemed underdone, rather haphazardly edited, and put together in a way you might expect someone still navigating through a community college film course. Overall, the film comes off as a half-baked realization of its subject that abruptly ends just as it was starting to get interesting with the interview with Ronald Sipus, the principal of Village Christian School in the SF Bay Area. The film's main weakness is that it had problems staying focused on and developing the issues that it sets out to investigate. The film meanders from one interviewee to another, often comparing anti-fundamentalist scholars with dogmatic hardcore religious fanatics.There were two main issues that Brian Flemming sets out to explore. First: Was there an historical Jesus and why do we think he existed? Second: How are leaders of fundamentalist Christian communities teaching young Christians and/or potential converts about who Jesus was? Are they really teaching about Jesus from an historical perspective based on scholarship or simply regurgitating dogma set forth by church fathers who formulated an interpretation about Jesus' life from between the middle of the first century until the fifth century? First off, Flemming spends about 6 to 10 minutes going through the precepts of the Christian doctrine and the traditional view of Jesus' life, which unless you have been living under a rock, is quite well-known. When you only have 62 minutes, that's a high percentage of the film. He goes on to interview between real scholars and fundamentalists who, if they were ever locked into a room together, might tear each other to smithereens. He also asks Christians at some retreat about what they know of other mythical beings such as Mithras and Osiris. Did he really think that these people would know that Mithras birthday is also celebrated on Dec 25th? The point is that much religious scholarship has shown Christianity's indebtedness to other popular mythologies like Mithras and Osiris, but that never quite gets satisfactorily developed. He really needed some of the heavy-hitter scholars like John Dominic Crossan and Elaine Pagels.Probably the strongest moment of the film is his assessment of the modern films about Jesus. This kind of critical analysis worked very well, with thought-provoking comparisons between ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""Passion of the Christ"". I remember the horrific crucifixion scene from ""Jesus of Nazareth"" when it first aired when I was a kid, not knowing what this was really about until I saw it. ""Passion"" makes ""Nazareth"" seem tame by comparison. I wished the rest of the film was as well-done as this segment which in many ways saves the film from being a total disaster.And then we finally get to the interview with his old nemesis Ronald Sipus. At first Flemming asks good questions to get his interviewee talking, and much of what Sipus says does very well to prove some of the absurdity concerning the philosophy of his Christian schools. In other words, Flemming's innocent questions get right to the meat of Sipus' fundamentalism without it being forced. But then Flemming makes the biggest faux pas of the production: he starts to debate Sipus on-camera, questioning his interviewee's motives. Sipus then shuts down and refuses to continue the interview. Flemming needed to have a session with someone like Llowell Bergman of PBS' Frontline (formerly of CBS' 60 Minutes) or David Frost to learn how to bring out what you want from your interviewee without putting him or her on the defensive. I really wanted to hear more of what Sipus had to say about his philosophy which would speak for itself. Instead, Flemming inadvertently pushes the ball into foul territory which ends the game. And Flemming, I guess because he failed in his interview, decides to end the whole documentary. I would have liked at least some reaction from a scholar about what Sipus said. Overall, a noble effort that does not quite get there. As an undergraduate student project it would get an A. As a professional project, it gets more like a C.",2,Noble Effort that Seems Incomplete and Even Amateurish at Times,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,4738,"['God', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'league', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'similar', 'offerings', 'such', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'Sicko', '62', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'felt', 'one-half', 'documentary', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'finished', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'ample', 'length', 'explore', 'subject', 'out', 'uncover', 'am', 'not', 'complaining', 'subject', 'matter', 'se', 'think', 'one', 'great', 'delving', 'sides', 'applaud', 'Flemming', 'tackling', 'most', 'contoversial', 'subjects', 'will', 'even', 'say', 'am', 'somewhat', 'politically', 'religiously', 'Flemming', 'side', 'However', 'entire', 'experience', 'seemed', 'underdone', 'rather', 'haphazardly', 'edited', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'might', 'expect', 'someone', 'still', 'navigating', 'community', 'college', 'film', 'course', 'Overall', 'film', 'off', 'half-baked', 'realization', 'subject', 'abruptly', 'just', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'interesting', 'interview', 'Ronald', 'Sipus', 'principal', 'Village', 'Christian', 'School', 'SF', 'Bay', 'Area', 'film', 'main', 'weakness', 'had', 'problems', 'staying', 'focused', 'developing', 'issues', 'out', 'investigate', 'film', 'meanders', 'one', 'interviewee', 'often', 'comparing', 'anti-fundamentalist', 'scholars', 'dogmatic', 'hardcore', 'religious', 'fanatics.There', 'were', 'two', 'main', 'issues', 'Brian', 'Flemming', 'out', 'explore', 'First', 'Was', 'historical', 'Jesus', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'existed', 'Second', 'How', 'are', 'leaders', 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'communities', 'teaching', 'young', 'Christians', 'and/or', 'potential', 'converts', 'who', 'Jesus', 'was', 'Are', 'really', 'teaching', 'Jesus', 'historical', 'perspective', 'based', 'scholarship', 'simply', 'regurgitating', 'dogma', 'set', 'forth', 'church', 'fathers', 'who', 'formulated', 'interpretation', 'Jesus', 'life', 'middle', 'first', 'century', 'fifth', 'century', 'First', 'Flemming', 'spends', '6', '10', 'minutes', 'going', 'precepts', 'Christian', 'doctrine', 'traditional', 'view', 'Jesus', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'quite', 'well-known', 'When', 'only', 'have', '62', 'minutes', 'high', 'percentage', 'film', 'interview', 'real', 'scholars', 'fundamentalists', 'who', 'were', 'ever', 'locked', 'room', 'together', 'might', 'tear', 'other', 'smithereens', 'also', 'Christians', 'retreat', 'what', 'know', 'other', 'mythical', 'beings', 'such', 'Mithras', 'Osiris', 'Did', 'really', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'know', 'Mithras', 'birthday', 'also', 'celebrated', 'Dec', '25th', 'point', 'much', 'religious', 'scholarship', 'shown', 'Christianity', 'indebtedness', 'other', 'popular', 'mythologies', 'Mithras', 'Osiris', 'never', 'quite', 'satisfactorily', 'developed', 'really', 'needed', 'heavy-hitter', 'scholars', 'John', 'Dominic', 'Crossan', 'Elaine', 'Pagels.Probably', 'strongest', 'moment', 'film', 'assessment', 'modern', 'films', 'Jesus', 'kind', 'critical', 'analysis', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'thought-provoking', 'comparisons', 'Greatest', 'Story', 'Ever', 'Told', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'remember', 'horrific', 'crucifixion', 'scene', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'saw', 'Passion', 'Nazareth', 'seem', 'tame', 'comparison', 'wished', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'well-done', 'segment', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'being', 'total', 'disaster.And', 'then', 'finally', 'get', 'interview', 'old', 'nemesis', 'Ronald', 'Sipus', 'first', 'Flemming', 'asks', 'good', 'questions', 'get', 'interviewee', 'talking', 'much', 'what', 'Sipus', 'very', 'well', 'prove', 'absurdity', 'concerning', 'philosophy', 'Christian', 'schools', 'other', 'words', 'Flemming', 'innocent', 'questions', 'get', 'right', 'meat', 'Sipus', 'fundamentalism', 'being', 'forced', 'then', 'Flemming', 'biggest', 'faux', 'pas', 'production', 'debate', 'Sipus', 'on-camera', 'questioning', 'interviewee', 'motives', 'Sipus', 'then', 'down', 'continue', 'interview', 'Flemming', 'needed', 'have', 'session', 'someone', 'Llowell', 'Bergman', 'PBS', 'Frontline', 'formerly', 'CBS', '60', 'Minutes', 'David', 'Frost', 'learn', 'how', 'bring', 'out', 'what', 'want', 'interviewee', 'putting', 'defensive', 'really', 'wanted', 'hear', 'more', 'what', 'Sipus', 'had', 'say', 'philosophy', 'would', 'speak', 'Instead', 'Flemming', 'inadvertently', 'ball', 'foul', 'territory', 'game', 'Flemming', 'guess', 'failed', 'interview', 'end', 'whole', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'least', 'reaction', 'scholar', 'what', 'Sipus', 'said', 'Overall', 'noble', 'effort', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'there', 'undergraduate', 'student', 'project', 'would', 'get', 'A', 'professional', 'project', 'more', 'C']",The God Who Wasn't There

Brian then begins the film by offering a six minute overview of Jesus' life that is tedious to say the least.Following this he begins to offer a look into the 30-60 years that fell between Jesus' life and the writings of the Gospels. This is where things really seem to fall apart for Brian. Brian then points to the character of Paul who was working between the death of Jesus and the writing of the Gospels, he states that Paul was uninformed of Jesus' life and ministry and that he didn't see Jesus as an earthly player but rather as a heavenly one. Here Brian mentions that Paul never heard about many events in Jesus' life though he fails to mention that Paul actually does mention the Last Supper. He then misquotes a verse from Hebrews to make it look as though Paul didn't actually think of Jesus as a man, there are two problems with this, one is that even Christians don't believe Paul wrote Hebrews, and the other is that the translation he uses is incorrect as well as misconstrued.Another quote he misuses is when he takes a verse from Luke that presents itself as though Jesus is actively telling his disciples to bring his enemies before him so he may kill them, the problem though is that this is taking place within a parable and isn't actually expressing Jesus' actions.The final nail in this movie's coffin comes in the ending, though the movie builds up the presentation of Christians and does its best to present them as blood-thirsty and ignorant, the moment of truth comes in an interview between Brian and his former principal. Brian immediately turns the interview into an attack and the principal eventually tells Brian he's not continuing the interview, the implications are clear, Brian is implying that the principal is pig-headed and ignorant, although the principal was doing what anyone would do in that situation, walk away.In the end we get a glimpse into the real reason Brian made this documentary, he wants someone to feel bad for him. He wants someone from his school to apologize to him and tell him everything is going to be ok, this movie is ultimately just a self-centered rant of a film that does more damage than good. It ends with him denying the Holy Spirit which is the ultimate proof of his self-centered attitude.I don't hate films like this, I am a Christian and I watch films like this to get a glimpse of Christianity from another perspective. This movie though is just an ignorant, inflammatory, misinformed mess.

955814,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000CAPZBC,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 3]","All in all, I'd recommend this DVD for its provocative nature, and many good points, but calling it a documentary is tough. It's far more like the agitprop of Michael Moore. Not that that's bad, for he is a very good crafter of filmic art, as long as you realize his work, and this film, is agitprop with no attempt at objectivity, and that agitprop is designed, at its core, to appeal to the heart, not the head. That said, it is, with only a couple of minor Biblical textual exceptions, good history, but only meager agitprop- Flemming has neither Moore's skill with film and its presentation, nor his humor, but there are glimmers that he could get better, and a return trip to this material when he has improved would be welcome. Hopefully, there will be other documentary filmmakers who will tackle some of this film's many questions, for, far too often, Flemming sounds like he's still trying to convince himself of the fact God does not exist, yet, if he were truly irreligious he'd not really care. With more balance, rather than using only the two morons who provide the pro-Jesus point of view, the digs against the manifest stupidity of the Jesus claims would stand out all the more plainly, and Flemming would not come off as such a bully, picking on the mentally deficient, or seeming as an ex-alcoholic ready to torch a bar in a Carry Nation crusade, as too often the converts from any system of belief to another are the worst sorts of supporters for the new belief system.As the old apothegm says, if a glass of water is clear that fact will be readily apparent by merely holding it up to the light. To quote yet another apothegm, in ending, a little more light and a little less heat would have been welcome, as well as better art and dialectic. For better or worse, the strength and honesty of dialectic all too often determines the outcome of the minds who listen, and this film's strength and honesty could and should be higher, closer to its art. Such unity of purpose and presentation is what all good critics should strive to seek. Few do, and as a consequence the art, the artist, and the art lovers suffer. Thus, I urge Flemming to seek to get better, for voices as his are needed- they just need to be as clear as they are strong.",2,So-so,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,2256,"[""'d"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'provocative', 'nature', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'calling', 'documentary', 'tough', 'far', 'more', 'agitprop', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Not', 'bad', 'very', 'good', 'crafter', 'filmic', 'art', 'as', 'long', 'realize', 'work', 'film', 'agitprop', 'attempt', 'objectivity', 'agitprop', 'designed', 'core', 'appeal', 'heart', 'not', 'head', 'said', 'only', 'couple', 'minor', 'Biblical', 'textual', 'exceptions', 'good', 'history', 'only', 'meager', 'agitprop-', 'Flemming', 'Moore', 'skill', 'film', 'presentation', 'humor', 'are', 'glimmers', 'could', 'get', 'better', 'return', 'trip', 'material', 'when', 'improved', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'other', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'will', 'tackle', 'film', 'many', 'questions', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'Flemming', 'sounds', 'still', 'trying', 'convince', 'fact', 'God', 'not', 'exist', 'yet', 'were', 'truly', 'irreligious', ""'d"", 'not', 'really', 'care', 'more', 'balance', 'rather', 'using', 'only', 'two', 'morons', 'who', 'provide', 'pro-Jesus', 'point', 'view', 'digs', 'manifest', 'stupidity', 'Jesus', 'claims', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'plainly', 'Flemming', 'would', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'such', 'bully', 'picking', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'seeming', 'ex-alcoholic', 'ready', 'torch', 'bar', 'Carry', 'Nation', 'crusade', 'too', 'often', 'converts', 'system', 'belief', 'are', 'worst', 'sorts', 'supporters', 'new', 'belief', 'old', 'apothegm', 'glass', 'water', 'clear', 'fact', 'will', 'be', 'readily', 'apparent', 'merely', 'holding', 'light', 'quote', 'yet', 'apothegm', 'ending', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'little', 'less', 'heat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'art', 'dialectic', 'better', 'worse', 'strength', 'honesty', 'dialectic', 'too', 'often', 'outcome', 'minds', 'who', 'listen', 'film', 'strength', 'honesty', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'higher', 'closer', 'art', 'Such', 'unity', 'purpose', 'presentation', 'what', 'good', 'critics', 'should', 'strive', 'seek', 'Few', 'do', 'consequence', 'art', 'artist', 'art', 'lovers', 'suffer', 'Thus', 'urge', 'Flemming', 'seek', 'get', 'better', 'voices', 'are', 'needed-', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'as', 'clear', 'are', 'strong']",The God Who Wasn't There

955817,A1YFG3PQ7K7A02,B000CAPZBC,Daniel M. Hobbs,"[4, 8]","Few films make me angry - but this one did!! First off, the title is a cheat - it's not primarily about God or Jesus, but about the filmmaker's issues with a very one-sided and pernicious version of Christian teaching. Second, the film is not an in-depth investigation of anything, simply an hour of polemic built around some faux-cool pop music, un-snazzy graphics, and one-sided claims. Flemming chooses the most inflammatory texts and quotes these out of context to indict the figure of Jesus, who - whether or not he actually existed - is surely one of the great moral beacons humankind has produced. Finally, while Flemming's interviews include at least one reputable critic of Christianity, Sam Harris, he also interviews several believers who, like many Christians, are clearly inexperienced in fielding questions about their faith. In doing so, he makes these believers look ignorant - as they indeed are - but he makes **himself** look petty and snide.It's not that this film is against Christianity - I'm a refugee from a version of fundamentalist Christian teaching very similar to the one Flemming rails against. I have a deep contempt for those who teach children - anyone, for that matter - a ""turn or burn"" religion, that God loves you and just can't hardly keep Himself from sending you to eternal torment.  But I have to say, the person I really cheered for in this film was the president of Flemming's Christian alma mater, who walked out of the interview, accusing Flemming of setting up the interview under false pretenses.If you want a real critique of Christianity, there are lots of writers - Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, others - who have done their homework, along with well-meaning scholars trying to determine what we can really know, if anything, of the man from Galilee, what he claimed and who he thought he was.The subtitle of this film is ""A Film Beyond Belief"". He got that right! The sheer lopsidedness, the lack of any creditable research, the triumph of rant - and it **is** rant, even if it's spoken softly - over any kind of balanced treatment is what is ""beyond belief.""

955823,A3BFKY618DR43K,B000CAPZBC,Elizabeth A. Root,"[5, 10]","I hesitated before giving this five stars, since it has some real flaws, but between the documentary and the featured materials, it offers so much information, and so much direction to other sources, that I would strongly recommend it to those interested in the historicity of Jesus and Christianity.  It is a wonderful demonstration of the power of electronic media.  In addition to the documentary itself, it includes valuable features, including extended interviews with those featured in the documentary, and a tour of the sources of further information,  including links to a variety of web sites.  The links include some of Flemming's opponents; he certainly isn't afraid to direct his audience to them.  Apparently most of this is old hat to some people, but I learned a great deal and there are always beginners.  I borrowed the copy I watched, but I intend to buy my own.The documentary could do with a little reworking. I think that presenting Charles Manson as an example of Christians is pretty dubious. Fleming also very occasionally includes obscene language, which I would prefer he didn't.  It seems likely to alienate some of his potentially sympathetic audience. My other issue is the inclusion of material from The Passion of Christ by Mel Gibson. I do believe in copyright, and I hope that was fair use. Come to think of it, if someone is going to sit through those segments, why am I worrying about a few obscenities?  In the end, I wasn't convinced of everything, but I look forward to further investigation of the matter.I am not under the impression that a documentary needs to be objective or present all sides (unless it claims to be doing that), just that it be factual and fair, which is not the same thing.  I would no more fault Flemming for failing to feature more traditional theologians than I would fault Billy Graham for failing to invite atheists to speak at his rallies.  He presents support for his thesis, just as numerous Christian productions have presented for theirs.  As it is, he presents interviews with Christian believers, and treats them respectfully, allowing them to speak for the most part without interruption.  Parts of interviews cut for lack of space are included in the features.  He perhaps should have presented more information about the communications leading up to his interview with Dr. Sipus.  He discusses this on his blog on slumdance.com.  I don't think that Sipus' description of the interview coincides with what we actually saw.  He was permitted to speak at length on his philosophy of teaching, and got angry as soon as Flemming began to ask questions.Depending on how narrowly one interpretes the title, Flemming did miss one possible argument.  That is that there could have been a historical person Jesus (although variants in the time line might argue against this),  and that the mythological elements were accreted to his life.  Of course, one could still argue that even if there was a Rabbi Jesus there wasn't a divine Jesus, and so it is still a GOD who never was.I don't think that it will convert committed Christians, but it has a lot of food for thought for those willing to consider the subject.",5,An extremely rich introduction to the topic,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,3181,"['hesitated', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'real', 'flaws', 'documentary', 'featured', 'materials', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'so', 'much', 'direction', 'other', 'sources', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'interested', 'historicity', 'Jesus', 'Christianity', 'wonderful', 'demonstration', 'power', 'electronic', 'media', 'addition', 'documentary', 'valuable', 'features', 'including', 'extended', 'interviews', 'featured', 'documentary', 'tour', 'sources', 'further', 'information', 'including', 'links', 'variety', 'web', 'sites', 'links', 'include', 'Flemming', 'opponents', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'direct', 'audience', 'Apparently', 'most', 'old', 'hat', 'people', 'learned', 'great', 'deal', 'are', 'always', 'beginners', 'borrowed', 'copy', 'watched', 'intend', 'buy', 'own.The', 'documentary', 'could', 'do', 'little', 'reworking', 'think', 'presenting', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'example', 'Christians', 'pretty', 'dubious', 'Fleming', 'also', 'very', 'occasionally', 'obscene', 'language', 'would', 'prefer', 'did', ""n't"", 'likely', 'alienate', 'potentially', 'sympathetic', 'audience', 'other', 'issue', 'inclusion', 'material', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'do', 'believe', 'copyright', 'hope', 'was', 'fair', 'use', 'Come', 'think', 'someone', 'going', 'sit', 'segments', 'why', 'am', 'worrying', 'few', 'obscenities', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'everything', 'look', 'forward', 'further', 'investigation', 'matter.I', 'am', 'not', 'impression', 'documentary', 'needs', 'be', 'objective', 'present', 'sides', 'be', 'doing', 'just', 'be', 'factual', 'fair', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'no', 'more', 'fault', 'Flemming', 'failing', 'feature', 'more', 'traditional', 'theologians', 'would', 'fault', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'failing', 'invite', 'atheists', 'speak', 'rallies', 'support', 'thesis', 'just', 'numerous', 'Christian', 'productions', 'have', 'presented', 'theirs', 'interviews', 'Christian', 'believers', 'respectfully', 'allowing', 'speak', 'most', 'part', 'interruption', 'Parts', 'interviews', 'cut', 'lack', 'space', 'are', 'included', 'features', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'presented', 'more', 'information', 'communications', 'leading', 'up', 'interview', 'Dr.', 'Sipus', 'blog', 'slumdance.com', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Sipus', 'description', 'interview', 'what', 'actually', 'saw', 'was', 'permitted', 'speak', 'length', 'philosophy', 'teaching', 'got', 'angry', 'as', 'soon', 'Flemming', 'began', 'ask', 'questions.Depending', 'how', 'narrowly', 'one', 'title', 'Flemming', 'did', 'miss', 'one', 'possible', 'argument', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'historical', 'person', 'Jesus', 'variants', 'time', 'line', 'might', 'argue', 'mythological', 'elements', 'were', 'accreted', 'life', 'course', 'one', 'could', 'still', 'argue', 'even', 'was', 'Rabbi', 'Jesus', 'was', ""n't"", 'divine', 'Jesus', 'still', 'GOD', 'who', 'never', 'was.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'convert', 'committed', 'Christians', 'lot', 'food', 'thought', 'willing', 'consider', 'subject']",The God Who Wasn't There
955824,A3IPHLD7B59IJ3,B000CAPZBC,"Enigma ""Cheers""","[13, 21]","There are so many errors in this film it's tough to know where to start. But let me start this way, I am an atheist, I don't believe in god(s) and I have no problem debating theists. However, I also have no problem debating atheists that use logical errors, lie (or are highly misinformed), twist history and generally mislead other people; all to try to prove that atheisms is correct. Personally I like to take the high road and as an atheist I try to be as factually correct as possible.Anyhow my low rating for this film is because it's rife with false historical claims and logical errors. If this is your sole source of information of 'Christianity' you will be horribly misled. And if you choose to use this films talking points in a debate you will look uniformed and down-right ignorant of history and Christianity in particular.Here are some of my notes that I took while watching the film:The film is wrong, the bible doesn't say the sun revolves around the earth, this is especially sad since this is the opening claim of the film and it gets it stunningly wrong, this is really not off to a good start.The film dogmatically claims that Mark was the first gospel written -  Small problem with that assertion,  there is no empirical proof of this claim. There are historians that 'think' Mark may have been first but there also historian that 'think' Matthew or Luke was written first. Luke being written first is a minority position but  Matthew has some very good arguments for it and is actually becoming the majority position among secular historians. The reasons are many but one of the most compelling is that linguists have strong evidence that suggests Matthew was originally written in Aramaic. Since almost all scholars and linguists seem to agree that  the Mark and Luke were written in Koine Greek with the exception of Jesus' sayings which seem to be translated from Aramaic. There is almost unanimous agreement that the author of Mark did not speak Aramaic and only wrote in Koine Greek so he had to have gotten Jesus' saying from some Aramaic source. The Markian priority group know this so in order to keep their theory they have invented a ""Q"" gospel which is supposed to be the original saying of Jesus written in Aramaic. However we still have one problem, there is no mention of this book in any historical source, there is no mention of it by the church fathers, there is no mention of it in the ancient church catalogs, there are no papyri fragments of this book. In fact it was never mentioned, alluded to or even hypothetically thought of until something conjured it up in the 20th Century. The bottom line is the film wants us to accept that Mark is first through some magical knowledge they have, but the fact is there is no evidence to support this theory and quite a lot to promote others that seem more plausible.MAJOR LIE: Mark does not say the temple was destroyed as the author blatantly claims, in fact all three of the synoptic gospels are written with the temple still standing. One of Jesus' most audacious claims was that the temple, the most revered Jewish holy site, was going to be destroyed. When he spoke of this the Jewish Pharisee's tried to stone and kill Jesus. Throughout the gospels the writers continually point to the fulfilling of prophecy as proof that Jesus was who he said he was. Many even argue, not without merit, that the gospel writers were so zealous of showing that prophecy had been fulfilled that they misinterpreted old testament prophecies and wrongly attached them to Jesus. With all of their zealotry to attach prophesy to Jesus one has to wonder why did none of the gospel writers mention the ""greatest"" prophecy that Jesus uttered had come true?????Logic dictates that they would have shouted this out in their books, or in the epistles but they are all ominously silent - WHY? The logical conclusion that secular historians come to is that when Mathew, Mark and Luke were penned the temple was still standing. Couple this with the fact that the film aggress that Luke was the third gospel written (as do most secular historians) and you run into even greater problems with trying to late date it. Almost all historians agree that Luke and Acts were written by the same author, and many accept the fact that they were the trial documents that had to be submitted for Paul's defense in Rome. That is why Acts mysteriously ends with Paul in Rome awaiting trail, they seem to be a documentary of Jesus and then Paul's missionary life. If that is the case then Luke was finished by 63AD which is the exact time frame that it ends (with the temple still standing). Since the movie agrees that Mark and Matthew were written pre-Luke it makes it a very hard sell to claim that they were written before 63AD yet after 70AD.MAJOR LIE: Claims that the epistles don't speak of Jesus or if they do it's all in a mythical realm. This is so blatantly false that I don't even know if I have to go into debunking it. Anyone can perform a cursory reading of the epistles to check the veracity of this claim and probably less than 30 minutes into they too would deem that this claim is laughably false.For example, there are 357 versus that explicitly talk about Jesus in the Epistles, here is just a smidgen of the highlights about Jesus you would glean from reading only the epistles:He was born of women,Baptized,Preached the gospel to men,Ate food,Had disciples,Taught in the temple,Healed the sick,Was crucified by the Romans,Suffered a painful deathHung on a tree/cross, was entombedRose from the deadAscended to heaven.It appears to me that the epistles say quite a bit about Jesus and all of it was based on earth not in some mythical realm that the filmmaker has made up. In fact when the filmmaker claims that Paul never thought Jesus was real person on earth you really have to wonder how stupid he thinks his audience is. The fact is one of Paul's main arguments throughout his epistles was his  continually urging of his readers to speak to the eyewitnesses of Jesus' earthly ministry. If Jesus had been purely mythical idea in Paul's mind why did Paul and the rest of the NT writers continually beseech people to speak to the eye-witnesses to back up their accounts??????? Remember even the Jewish Pharisees of that time admitted that Jesus lived but they denied that he was the son of God. You would think that if this claim had ANY merit the contemporaries of a mythical Jesus would have pointed out that he never lived!The next thing he tries to sell the readers is a strange rewriting of history. His claim is that  Jesus lived (wait i thought he was mythical!?!?!?), then Jesus died and everyone forgot about him for a 40-60 years. But this ignores many historical manuscripts that talk about the Christian sect growing and becoming troublesome for the Jews BEFORE the temple was destroyed (70AD). We have records of Christians being martyred throughout the time period of 40-70AD. We know that they could be saved from death if they simply denied Jesus as God but they didn't and instead were killed for their belief. Even though there was rank persecution going on we have records that this religion was growing and expanding. So again the filmmaker lies/distorts history by ignoring it.His complaint about The Passion of the Christ was just silly, the movie was about the crucifixion of Christ and what Christ endured leading up to and then during the crucifixion. The filmmaker  complains that they show the crucifixion of Christ and what he endured and this somehow makes Christian bloodthirsty. HUH, that's like watching a war documentary about Hitler and then getting charged with being pro-Hitler and Pro-War.MAJOR ERROR: As most historians admit, the inquisition was a political movement much more than a religious one but the filmmaker again lies to the public and claims the exact opposite even claiming that it is the embodiment of Christianity. I guess Mother Theresa didn't get that memo.MAJOR ERROR: The most venerated people of the bible are the Jews, Christians are some of the most outspoken proponents of protecting Israel and the Jews yet according to the filmmaker none of that is true. In fact the bible is about hating Jews and Christians despise them too. I guess all those fundamentalist churches that support Israel didn't get that memo either.MAJOR ERROR: Sam Harris makes a leap of logic so huge that you probably need an airplane to bridge the gap. There are believers who think that Jesus is coming back in their lifetime, however they also believe that they are commanded by god to be ""good stewards"" of the earth, to protect it and take care of it. Sam accepts the first but denies the later and says Christians actually will do the opposite never giving a reason why they believe A and supposedly not B even though they are both in the book they say is 100% correct.Sam Harris also makes another illogical claim - this time he says that it's terribly scary and troubling that these Christians might elect leaders that are in Christians. Newsflash to Sam Harris, that's been happening since the founding of the country. In fact our country and our elected leaders were much more religious and much more biblical literalist than we are today. In fact early in the history of this country 60%+ of congressmen were practicing clergy members. On Sunday many of them would be leading churches so Sam Harris is so historically incorrect its laughable. The sad part is I usually like Sam Harris and have recommended his books on many occasions but these two flubs are an embarrassment and I may have to rethink if I will ever recommend him again.The filmmaker claims he was a fundamentalist Christian but what becomes very apparent is that he doesn't have a clue about Christianity or much of its history. For example he claims that if you deny the holy spirit you will not be forgiven, yet that's not what the bible says. The passage that he is referring to is a hotly debated one among Christians (something he would know if he was ever a Christian) and even they don't agree what it means but after checking 15 different sources I couldn't find one that says it's the simple denial as the author claims. But it gets even more wacky, he claims he was ""scared to death"" that he had at one time doubted the holy spirit (he kind of changed it from denying to doubting) and he would pray feverishly about this issue. The sad part is he was either highly misinformed or had a very active imagination and is prone to being scared about things but projecting his irrationality on others doesn't help his case. BTW, after his interview with the president of the school where he claims he got this information it appears that the later is the case.MAJOR ERROR: The filmmaker asks what naturalistic proof do you have proof for a supernatural being. HUH????? Talk about a major class confusion, I guess such sophistry might fool a third grader but anyone with a basic logic class sees through this arrantly stupid question.That's all of my notes, sorry folks but this film is just too ridden with errors to make it worthwhile.Cheers",1,The Logic that wasn't there,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,11129,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'errors', 'film', 'tough', 'know',

The filmmaker, himself a recovering Christian fundamentalist, draws on varied, primarily non-controversial (at least, in academic circles) sources to argue that Jesus of Nazareth was, in fact, a mythical figure with no basis in history. The filmmaker, in the role of equal opportunity offender, selects particularly odious bible verses to underscore the bind in which many ""moderate Christians"" find themselves (i.e., having to reconcile their contemporary mores with scriptures whose values are often anything but contemporary). Finally, in one of the most uncomfortable scenes I've ever come across in documentary film, the filmmaker meets with his former high school principal and confronts him over the practice of indoctrinating children and confusing beliefs with facts. (Seeing the principal twist in the wind when asked in what sense ""hell"" was a ""reality"" given the absolute lack of empirical support for it was itself worth the ticket price.)Does he provide ironclad proof that Jesus did not exist and that Christianity is based completely in ahistorical myth? Of course not, given that this is an hour long documentary and the subject itself is complex and far from agreed upon even by scholars. The questions he raises allow the viewer to consider this possibility, though, and that is why this film is so valuable.As is my wont, I do have a few minor bones to pick with the filmmaker. His use of selected Bible verses to underscore his points is done without contextualizing the quotes and also without indicating the source of the translation, which is definitely problematic. As well, I rankled at his glibness in describing the murdered Branch Davidians as ""crispy"" cultists or somesuch; instead of mocking these dead, many of whom were innocent kids, he could have used this as another opportunity to skewer Christian hypocrisy, in this case that of a ""Christian"" nation whose government murders people who ""misuse"" the First Amendment.Sadly, this movie probably won't be viewed by those who most desperately need to see it. Instead, this absent audience, the current crop of smart kids growing up like the filmmaker (or this reviewer) in fundamentalist Christian homes, will continue to be stifled and taught that doubting and thinking critically are sinful habits of mind.",4,"Surprisingly fun, confrontational documentary that will, unfortunately, play mostly to the choir",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2673,"['seeing', 'name', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'connection', 'DVD', 'expected', 'shrill', 'humorless', 'screed', 'fundamentalist', 'atheist', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'instead', 'engaging', 'witty', 'irreverent', 'movie', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'viewers', 'reconsider', 'assumptions', 'very', 'existence', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'pivotal', 'figures', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'filmmaker', 'recovering', 'Christian', 'fundamentalist', 'varied', 'primarily', 'non-controversial', 'least', 'academic', 'circles', 'sources', 'argue', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'was', 'fact', 'mythical', 'figure', 'basis', 'history', 'filmmaker', 'role', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'offender', 'particularly', 'odious', 'bible', 'verses', 'underscore', 'bind', 'many', 'moderate', 'Christians', 'find', 'i.e.', 'having', 'reconcile', 'contemporary', 'mores', 'scriptures', 'values', 'are', 'often', 'anything', 'contemporary', 'Finally', 'one', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', 'documentary', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'confronts', 'practice', 'indoctrinating', 'children', 'confusing', 'beliefs', 'facts', 'Seeing', 'principal', 'twist', 'wind', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'sense', 'hell', 'was', 'reality', 'given', 'absolute', 'lack', 'empirical', 'support', 'was', 'ticket', 'price', 'provide', 'ironclad', 'proof', 'Jesus', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'Christianity', 'based', 'completely', 'ahistorical', 'myth', 'course', 'not', 'given', 'hour', 'long', 'documentary', 'subject', 'complex', 'far', 'agreed', 'even', 'scholars', 'questions', 'viewer', 'consider', 'possibility', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'valuable.As', 'wont', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'bones', 'pick', 'filmmaker', 'use', 'selected', 'Bible', 'verses', 'underscore', 'points', 'done', 'contextualizing', 'quotes', 'also', 'indicating', 'source', 'translation', 'definitely', 'problematic', 'well', 'rankled', 'glibness', 'describing', 'murdered', 'Branch', 'Davidians', 'crispy', 'cultists', 'somesuch', 'instead', 'mocking', 'dead', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'innocent', 'kids', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'opportunity', 'skewer', 'Christian', 'hypocrisy', 'case', 'Christian', 'nation', 'government', 'murders', 'people', 'who', 'misuse', 'First', 'Amendment.Sadly', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'viewed', 'who', 'most', 'desperately', 'need', 'see', 'Instead', 'absent', 'audience', 'current', 'crop', 'smart', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'filmmaker', 'reviewer', 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'homes', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'stifled', 'taught', 'doubting', 'thinking', 'critically', 'are', 'sinful', 'habits', 'mind']",The God Who Wasn't There

955834,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000CAPZBC,Jean E. Pouliot,"[2, 5]","As an open-minded Christian, I enjoy reading the work of atheists. Richard Dawkins does a nice job of elucidating the atheist viewpoint. Even the recently-departed Christopher Hitchens, he of the vicious attacks on moral superheroes, makes a great case for the danger of religious thought.But poor director Brian Fleming. His ""The God Who Wasn't There"" is all bluff and puffery, and not well-though-out at all.This basic contention is that between 33AD, when Jesus died, and the writing of the first gospel around 70AD, very little happened. Jesus, in his lifetime was known, then was forgotten for thirty-five years, and then ""remembered"" again. This would indeed be compelling evidence if it were true. Fleming correctly states that Paul, who wrote in the 40s and 50s, did not write about the sayings of Jesus, his healings, the virgin birth or the other miracles. Fleming claim therefore that Paul did not know of these events at all. Which is a stretch - no consideration is given to the possibility that Paul knew of them but chose not to write about them.But this argument is silly on a couple of fronts. Fleming omits the book of Acts, admittedly written around 85AD, that tells the story of the early church. In many cases, Acts at least parallels what Paul writes about, providing a source of some internal consistency. Fleming also ignores that Paul was not a historian, but an  apostle and preacher. All that mattered to Paul was that Christ, born of a woman, had been crucified, raised from death, and was soon  to return in glory. Who cared where he was born and what color his hair was?Fleming resurrects the old argument that many gods in the ancient world were born of virgins, crucified, rose from the dead and are seated among the gods. This old dog sure has made the rounds. And it seems persuasive to those who don't study the ancient world. These claims are either hilariously wrong, or describe religions that came into being *after* Christianity and cribbed from its influence and powerful stories.On the positive side, I appreciated the animated comparison of the Resurrection stories that Fleming included. If I taught religion, I would incorporate it into the curriculum. While fundamentalists might think it blasphemous to show discrepancies among the gospel accounts of Christ's rising, it's not so at all. Mainline scholars have known of the differences for years. Whether proclaiming the appearance at the tomb of a young man (Mark), two men (Luke), or one angel (Matthew), the gospel differences provide important insights into the minds of the evangelists and the development of the early church. The fact that the early church retained such radically different accounts - when harmonizing them would have made it look better - is a testament to its high regard for truth, no matter how uncomfortable. But Fleming's exegisis, while fun to watch, tells us nothing about the Resurrection and less about the gospel writers. He seems to believe that either the gospels (and the Bible) are literally true and thoroughly consistent, as he was taught, or that they are completely untrue. A subtle mind is needed to understand the Good Book, something Fleming sadly does not possess.I admired that Fleming seems hell-bent on facing down the scars left by his fundamentalist education. It was courageous to enter the chapel where three times (after moments of doubt) he declared Jesus as his personal Savior. It was brave (if a little theatrical) to now deny the existence of the Holy Spirit there. But it absolutely excruciating to watch him assault his old school principal with his new and heretical beliefs. I can understand the catharsis that Fleming was after, but his confrontation (with a restrained, if pained principal) was an adolescent fantasy of patricide that did not advance Fleming's thesis or argue well for his maturity.I was disappointed by interviews taken out of context. Barbra Mikkelson, of the wonderful, legend-busting Snopes.com, weighed in to say that certain fictional stories, when heard by new listeners, are told as true. By extension, Fleming suggests, fictional stories about a crucified messiah, when heard years later, were taken as (pardon me) gospel. Certainly, it is not impossible that this kind of human error skewed the transmission of stories about Jesus. But Fleming's claim that the Jesus stories are fiction relies heavily on the belief that for 35+ years after his death, everyone forgot about Jesus, and that around 70AD, a new batch of listeners heard the stories as true. This completely ignores the existence of Jesus's apostles (whom even Paul admits to meeting) and a church community that personally knew Jesus and transmitted his story, however imperfectly.""The God Who Was Not There"" is a ""cri de coeur"" from a young man wounded by a twisted experience of faith. But he is in error to declare that the truth must be the polar opposite of whatever he was taught, and that everything he learned as a student, including the very existence of Jesus, was utterly false. Let's hope that as he matures, Fleming does not make the mistake of others who held passionate, if erroneous, beliefs while young, and that he learns more nuanced way of understanding Jesus and the gospels.",2,The argument that wasn't there,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,5249,"['open-minded', 'Christian', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'work', 'atheists', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'nice', 'job', 'elucidating',

955835,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B000CAPZBC,Jeff  Farrow,"[5, 7]","Most of the core ideas presented in this film have been explored in literary fashion by others--and have been reviewed  & otherwise memorialized on Parallel Perspectives--but this cinematographic presentation represents the icing on a very heretical cake.The film opens with an animated depiction of the sun revolving around the earth. Producer/Narrator Brian Flemming's voice tells us that Christianity once believed that this was the way the universe functioned. Next Flemming says, ""If Christianity could be wrong about this, could it also be wrong in other areas of life?"" The opening transitions  to what are my favorite scenes, consisting of motion pictures of archival silent & 1950  Bible Stories.Then the scene changes again to a message board image with dozens of pictures of Jesus covering it. Then, one be one, a picture is replaced by an actual person being interviewed regarding their Christian faith. The people represent many races, many different walks of life. They look like anybody you might meet walking down a pleasant street or living next door--and this is what makes their delusional thinking really chilling. They are like pod people.The film continues to intersperse archival & humorous scenes with interviews of believers & non-believers. One segment that I really related to was on the subject of ""The Rapture."" For those who have been spared knowing what that is, it refers to the ""End of Times"" when ""real"" Christians (i.e. Fundamentalists) will be ""assumptioned"" or fly bodily up into heaven like The Virgin Mary. Then while they (the ""Saved"") watch from their lofty location with Jehovah et al., everybody left on earth will be tortured & cast into hell by the Anti-Christ right before their eyes. The blueprint  for this universal massacre is found in ""Revelations."" I say I related to this because our site  features a historical materialist interpretation of the Armageddon motif by Friedrich Engles: 666 and Historic Materialism.  In it, the earliest of Marxists expresses his astonishment at the sheer delight the author of Revelations takes in anticipating the approaching suffering of all non-believers.Moving along, there is an interview with a Fundamentalist (I call them the Religious Mafia) who started a website called ""The Rapture Letters."" No kidding. It provides a program for fellow believers who want to leave a message for their unbelieving relatives & friends who get left out of the fast lane to Jehovah.  It's like saying, ""Nani-nani-nah-nah, we made it & you didn't--TOLD YOU SO!"" It's ludicrous--but don't forget, these Fundamentalists occupy positions of authority on all levels of society. I saw an interview on TV with a real life police detective who had absolutely no compunction saying that all ""the bad guys"" he fights on the street are, in fact, demons! And he meant that literally.He's not the only religiously challenged cop out there in ""The Force,"" I'm sureSee also,THE NEANDERTHAL LEGACYWhen Christians in the movie are asked how they can reconcile ideas in the Bible that don't fit in with the image of the loving Father in Heaven, their invariable response is 1. Outright denial or ignorance of the issues involved, or 2. ""It's all part of God's Will.""This is like the Salem Witchcraft trials (and, no, I don't believe there were any ""real"" witches.) When asked for proof of a defendants guilt, the accusers offered ""spectral evidence,"" things that could range from nightmares to an upset stomach. Nothing we would call today ""material evidence.""Another section I liked in the film is how the idea that Jesus may never have existed is presented. In line with this, there is a funny archival clip depicting the Apostle Saul's conversion to Paul, and becoming the great propagandist for the successful Romanized version of Christianity. I found it really interesting when the narrator stated that Paul never demonstrated any knowledge of the Gospels of Mathew, Mark, Luke & John.See also,THE NEW TESTAMENT CODE Robert EisenmanInterviews with folklorists in the film show just what a cut-and-paste creation Christianity is--and the numerous points of identity connecting Jesus with a host of more ancient Pagan hero/resurrection figures.See also,THE JESUS MYSTERIESSECRET BOOKS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICSTHE GOD WHO WASN'T THERE includes a fairly extensive clip from Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF CHRIST. The idea was to show just how meticulous Gibson was in showing graphic, bloody violence. This was important because the motif of blood sacrifice is absolutely central to the confessional/Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam.) The film also made a point first documented by Eisenman, that is, the depiction of the Sanhedrin (Jewish Council that condemned Jesus) as the  embodiment of pure evil. Interestingly, both Eisenman & GOD, etc producer Brian Flemming indicate how ridiculous it was to state, as the Bible does, that the Sanhedrin would have become involved  in such a complex case during Passover. Eisenman goes further & says that they couldn't unanimously agree about anything. Anyone with a background in city government can appreciate the humor. [Above left, The Sanhedrin, from an 1883 encyclopedia]I'm not going to comment any further on Gibson's abomination because, like a violent rape, it makes me sick to think about.See also,SEX, DRUGS, VIOLENCE & THE BIBLEThe film draws a valid analogy between the evolution of the Christian ""Party Line"" and how a hoax story on the internet morphs into a story considered as fact.  Don't forget, they can justify anything because ""God wills it."" Book Burning. Murder. Pogroms. Homophobia. Discrimination. Segregation. Genocide...the Religious Mafia has its pudgy little fingers into everything that doesn't fit in their single dimensional, distorted worldview.There's only 2 problems I had with the film.1. The advance promo material overstates its ""dazzling motion graphics."" They're OK, but there are plenty of ""ancient history"" type productions--including several brilliant programs dealing with the Gnostics & Knights Templar (see review below.) Again, the producer's enthusiasm aside, the ideas presented in the film are not particularly new, they've been bouncing around in the public domain for quite some time now.2. The core dramatic/animated segment ended too soon. I would easily have watched another 30 minutes or so--but then it's good to leave the audience asking for more--and I sincerely hope we see more of related subject matter in future DVDs.",3,A Skeptics

That notwithstanding, here are my impressions.The just over an hour long main feature is well produced and is very interesting. It seemed somewhat overambitious for the length. Producer/writer/narrator Fleming would have done better to stick with only one of his two themes - 1.) that Jesus is a mythical figure and 2.) Christian morality is deeply flawed.Fleming comes off as somewhat of a jerk. A lot of the film seems unnecessarily Christian bashing in tone. He comes across as a disturbed man with an ax to grind and scores to settle. His interview with the superintendent (Sipus) of his former Christian school has every earmark of an ambush. It was just petty not to grant Sipus' request that the interview not be made public.The special features are of great interest here. The interview with Robert Price is especially absorbing. I could listen to Price talk all day long. I don't know if he's on the lecture circuit or not but he should be. Some of the other extended interviews feature a lot of Bush fear mongering that seems silly in light of subsequent political events but are interesting nonetheless.The commentary tracks were of less interest to me. They are recorded phone conversations played over the main feature but aren't really commentary on the feature as such. Indeed, the feature tended to distract from the commentary.I also thought that Fleming showed much more of Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" movie than could have been defended as ""fair use"" but he seems to have gotten away with it.Summing up, I recommend this DVD to believers and nonbelievers alike despite flaws.",4,More provocative than it needed to be,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,1691,"['product', 'almost', '300', 'reviews', 'hard', 'find', 'anything', 'new', 'say', 'notwithstanding', 'here', 'are', 'impressions.The', 'just', 'hour', 'long', 'main', 'feature', 'well', 'produced', 'very', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'overambitious', 'length', 'Producer/writer/narrator', 'Fleming', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'stick', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'themes', '1', 'Jesus', 'mythical', 'figure', '2', 'Christian', 'morality', 'deeply', 'flawed.Fleming', 'off', 'somewhat', 'jerk', 'lot', 'film', 'unnecessarily', 'Christian', 'bashing', 'tone', 'across', 'disturbed', 'man', 'ax', 'grind', 'scores', 'settle', 'interview', 'superintendent', 'Sipus', 'former', 'Christian', 'school', 'earmark', 'ambush', 'was', 'just', 'petty', 'not', 'grant', 'Sipus', 'request', 'interview', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'public.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'interest', 'here', 'interview', 'Robert', 'Price', 'especially', 'absorbing', 'could', 'listen', 'Price', 'talk', 'day', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lecture', 'circuit', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'other', 'extended', 'interviews', 'feature', 'lot', 'Bush', 'fear', 'mongering', 'silly', 'light', 'subsequent', 'political', 'events', 'are', 'interesting', 'nonetheless.The', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'were', 'less', 'interest', 'are', 'recorded', 'phone', 'conversations', 'played', 'main', 'feature', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'commentary', 'feature', 'such', 'Indeed', 'feature', 'tended', 'distract', 'commentary.I', 'also', 'thought', 'Fleming', 'showed', 'much', 'more', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'defended', 'fair', 'use', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'it.Summing', 'up', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'believers', 'nonbelievers', 'alike', 'flaws']",The God Who Wasn't There
955837,A311QT2NYDS6UD,B000CAPZBC,"Jinger Jarrett ""Internet Marketer, Author, Wr...","[2, 17]","I rented this DVD because I was curious. I had seen it advertised all over the Internet using Google Adwords.If nothing else, it certainly is amusing, but the scholarship presented here is so shoddy as to be ridiculous.First, of all, one of the claims made here is that in the 40 years after the death of Christ, nothing happened, i.e. Christianity didn't grow.Here's the problem here: if the creation of Christianity in the first century wasn't important, why did Nero consider Christians to be such a significant threat? After all, he is the one who blamed the burning of Rome on Christians. This led to the martyrdom of thousands who claimed to be Christian.Then there is the way that this guy ambushes the head administrator at the Christian school he attended. Richard Carrier basically lies to get an interview with this administrator. When the administrator realizes he is being ambushed, he asks Carrier to leave.Carrier comes across as being angry over having religion shoved down his throat. As someone who grew up in an authoritarian religious home, I understand how he feels. However, that was just never enough to make me walk away from God, just religion.Finally, let's not forget that Carrier completely ignores the historical account written by Josephus. Any accurate and coherent discussion on this topic would have to include this important historian.I am all for honest intellectual discussions on the topic of God, as long as they are respectful and devoid of name calling. This is neither.I respect the right of others to believe whatever they want to. After all, where you spend eternity is a big decision. I just don't think it's fair to purposefully mislead others, and Richard Carrier is misleading others with this film. It is short on fact, and long on complaints about how he was forced to become a Christian.Quite frankly, I would recommend anyone who is curious to watch it. Even with only a very basic fundamental knowledge of Christianity, which is what most Christians have, you'll be able to shoot down his arguments easily.",1,The Scholarship That Wasn't There,1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,2058,"['rented', 'DVD', 'was', 'curious', 'had', 'seen', 'advertised', 'Internet', 'using', 'Google', 'Adwords.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'certainly', 'amusing', 'scholarship', 'presented', 'here', 'so', 'shoddy', 'be', 'ridiculous.First', 'one', 'claims', 'made', 'here', '40', 'years', 'death', 'Christ', 'nothing', 'happened', 'i.e', 'Christianity', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow.Here', 'problem', 'here', 'creation', 'Christianity', 'first', 'century', 'was', ""n't"", 'important', 'why', 'did', 'Nero', 'consider', 'Christians', 'be', 'such', 'significant', 'threat', 'one', 'who', 'blamed', 'burning', 'Rome', 'Christians', 'led', 'martyrdom', 'thousands', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'Christian.Then', 'way', 'guy', 'head', 'administrator', 'Christian', 'school', 'attended', 'Richard', 'Carrier', 'basically', 'get', 'interview', 'administrator', 'When', 'administrator', 'being', 'ambushed', 'Carrier', 'leave.Carrier', 'being', 'angry', 'having', 'religion', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'authoritarian', 'religious', 'home', 'understand', 'how', 'However', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'enough', 'make', 'walk', 'away', 'God', 'just', 'religion.Finally', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Carrier', 'completely', 'historical', 'account', 'written', 'Josephus', 'Any', 'accurate', 'coherent', 'discussion', 'topic', 'would', 'have', 'include', 'important', 'historian.I', 'am', 'honest', 'intellectual', 'discussions', 'topic', 'God', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'respectful', 'devoid', 'name', 'calling', 'neither.I', 'respect', 'right', 'others', 'believe', 'want', 'where', 'spend', 'eternity', 'big', 'decision', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'purposefully', 'mislead', 'others', 'Richard', 'Carrier', 'misleading', 'others', 'film', 'short', 'fact', 'long', 'complaints', 'how', 'was', 'forced', 'become', 'Christian.Quite', 'frankly', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'curious', 'watch', 'Even', 'only', 'very', 'basic', 'fundamental', 'knowledge', 'Christianity', 'what', 'most', 'Christians', 'have', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'shoot', 'down', 'arguments', 'easily']",The God Who Wasn't There

He has created an excellent short documentary on Christianity as seen from a vantage point only a few of us have ever attained. Those who remain in Christianity's grip may grimace at the failure of some Christians when interviewed, but by the time the end of the movie is reached, they may be downright stunned by what they will probably (but erroneously) call ""foolish pride"".The documentary offers a short synopsis of what Christianity actually is, then proceeds to start deconstructing it, often with very powerful little tidbits, ending with a personal statement of faith that I found more brave than any statement I heard when I was in the midst of Christianity myself.  The trip back to his childhood Christian academy as a different person than when he left, is a journey all people make at some point in their lives. He just had the added drama of having rejected what he was taught as a child. Those of us who have done likewise, that were willing to rise above the pedestrian philistine parochialism of their small childhood world, will feel a deep rapport with this man as he seeks to confront the demons of his past.Even better than the feature itself though are the over 200 minutes of additional material, including extended interviews with some of the people that appear in the movie, the most memorable being  Richard Dawkins, and the MIT guy that reveals that rather than being finely tuned to produce life, the universe actually seems finely tuned to produce black holes.This movie is well-researched, bold, provocative and gives Christianity a very good thumping.

The last 20 minutes or so of the movie were almost painful to watch, as we see this fellow get revenge (or convince himself that he is doing so) against the parochial school teachers who brainwashed him.This is NOT a movie exploring the falsity of the Jesus myth, but one man's personal crusade against his religious upbringing.

955843,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B000CAPZBC,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[23, 27]","So says Brian Flemming, former fundamentalist Christian, in this brave new film. In it, Fleming examines the ""Jesus myth"" and finds it exactly that - a myth. This, he uses as a vehicle to call the whole of Christianity (based, as it is, on this myth) into question.The first third of the film is devoted to exploring the ""history of Jesus"" the church doesn't highlight. From the fact that we have NO first-hand witnesses to Jesus's existence to the fact that just about all Jesus's attributes were borrowed from earlier ""Christs,"" we get a pretty thorough treatment on this score. No believer in Jesus the ""Christ"" will be left untouched here.From here, we explore the nature of Christianity today. We are treated to scenes (used without Gibson's permission) from the ""Passion of the Christ"" - what Fleming terms ""The Smashin' of the Christ"" - to question what kind of religion makes a blood-and-guts movie a best seller! Further, we are treated to some of the finer points of the old testament's ""morality"" and even an explosive interview with Fleming's former Bible-based grade-school teacher.Along the way, we run into such scholars as the biblical scholar Robert M. Price, ""End of Faith"" author Sam Harris, historian Richard Carrier, and (in the special features) zoologist Richard Dawkins. While this film isn't the most in-depth exploration of Christianity (it is, after all, about an hour), it is intellectually ""action packed,"" and offers the theist and atheist (the former moreso than the latter)something to mull over.Fleming made most of this film himself, using computer graphics, self-conducted interviews, movie footage, and his own narration. If it is a good film intellectually, it is as much so aesthetically. The graphics are great, the very conversation-like narration works well, and the bold music is a perfect fit with the mood of the film.There are only certain complaints I have to do with the fact that sometimes, I feel Fleming is more rhetorical than reasoned (in the vein of Farenheit 9/11). But I cannot get into too many of those nit-picky details without divulging a good amount of the film's content.

955846,AAG1G1VAIQJIT,B000CAPZBC,"K. Tarin ""EveryoneIsBlindnDeaf""","[12, 73]","Until recently, I had never encountered a person who seriously questioned the existence of Jesus. Sure, I've known folks who said he was an admirable, if deluded teacher, or that his followers misunderstood him or elevated his status, but none have suggested that he didn't exist.Then in a discussion with an academic philosopher, I was informed that ""Biblical scholars tend to fudge the issue, but historians are much clearer: there is no evidence of Jesus' existence. He goes completely under the radar of the Roman records, the Palestinian historians -- everyone.Everyone? I asked. That would be news to Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny, and Suetonius who, by the way,((( weren't particularly inclined toward this messianic character )))or his fringe following.Unfortunately, that comment didn't carry sufficient heft for the academian.A troubling question--if Jesus never existed, how did a Christian community arise within the living memory of those who were his contemporaries?Even more--why did they allow themselves to be thrown into the Coliseum by Nero for a fictitious hero?For whatever one may believe about the historical evidence about Jesus, one stubborn fact remains: the emergence (and persecution!) of a first century community that grew out of the teachings of a leader whose credentials could have been checked out from any number of surviving eyewitnesses.Jesus myth - Did He really live?Is the Jesus myth true? Is Jesus just the fabrication of a bunch of religious zealots? Some people would like us to believe that the existence of Jesus is nothing more than a myth. To examine this question, let's start by looking at how some people have defined the word ""myth.""a traditional story accepted as history; serves to explain the worldview of a peoplea story, usually of teleological content, that relates not historical fact but historical ""experience"" of its writer or culture. It is not a chronicle of ""what was or is"" but a profound expression of ""how things are.""an anonymous tale emerging from the traditional beliefs of a culture or social unit. Myths use supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. They may also explain cosmic issues like creation and death.If Jesus did not really exist, He would fit these definitions because He would not be part of history or historical fact. Conversely, even if He really did exist, the last definition implies that who He claimed to be could still be a myth if the supernatural miracles He performed had natural explanations or He was not the Creator He claimed to be or He really didn't have power over death He claimed to have.It appears that the person who wrote the last definition tailored it to fit Jesus. He apparently believed that Jesus was not what He claimed to be and consequently was a myth.Raising the potential mythology of Jesus is a fair question and believing in the Jesus myth is an acceptable position as long as such a conclusion is based upon a careful, unbiased examination of the evidence and not based upon what we want to believe.Many of us may want to jump to that conclusion just to avoid our responsibility toward God and to our neighbors that we would be forced to consider if Jesus is real and is who He says He is.Any careful and objective study of the facts that surround Jesus birth, life, death, and resurrection will convince anyone that Jesus is real and that He is who He said He was.Many people have done research specifically to discredit the reality of Jesus and who He claimed to be or examined their atheistic beliefs and ended up proclaiming the truth of Jesus and the Bible.Some of these that have written their story in a book include Josh McDowell, Lee Strobel, Sir William M. Ramsey, and Randall Niles.Without even getting into many detailed historical, archeological, scientific, and documentary facts, consider the following to see if Jesus' existence and His claim to be God are consistent with the facts:Our calendar is based upon the birth of Jesus both counting backwards (BC) before His birth and forwards (AD) after His birth. Why would we base our calendar on a myth?Why have Christians been persecuted throughout history if Jesus is a myth?If Jesus is a myth, why do people take His name in vein?Why does the mere name of Jesus instill such hatred and controversy and why is just mentioning the name of Jesus taboo if He is a myth?If Jesus and His resurrection was a myth, why did all the apostles die for what they knew to be a lie?How have so many lives been transformed from unsatisfying, self-destructive behaviors that are like a curse on themselves, their families, and society to a purposeful, satisfying life that is a blessing to society?How do you explain the wisdom that Jesus had when answering peoples questions when they tried to trick and trap Him?How do you explain how Jesus fulfilled all the messianic prophecies in the Old Testament that could not have been fulfilled by random chance?Why was Jesus crucified and why were the apostles murdered if it's all a myth?Many religious concepts are consistent with human thinking. Some promise to make us gods. Some promise many virgins. Some promise utopia. These concepts are consistent with human thinking. How do you explain God's plan that includes Jesus giving up His God status to become a lowly man; to live a perfect life and to die for us by our own hand and to save us from our sins. This is clearly not a concept that men would create.In the beginning was the Word,and the Word was with God,and the Word was God.He was with God in the beginning.Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned,but whoever does not believe standscondemnedalreadybecause he has not believed

955847,A2VWPJGE6YSGAN,B000CAPZBC,Kurgan,"[10, 15]","If there is one good reason to view this DVD then that is to see the mindset of a young man burned by a fundamentalist protestant upbringing embrace atheism and try to get you fired up about it too.If there is another reason to watch it, it would be to see a rundown of bad arguments used by atheists against Christianity. The main argument of this movie is that Jesus ""never existed."" Of course in putting that out there, he is setting himself outside the mainstream even of atheists, and setting himself squarely up against historical and biblical scholarship the world-over. Not all of his viewers may be aware of this fact however, so caution is warranted. This is getting into conspiracy theory territory.Apparently his intended audience was primarily meant to be young atheists who were struggling with just why they were giving up their Christian faith or agnostics sitting on the fence about the whole ""God"" idea. At one point Mr. Flemming, who produced and directed this ""documentary"" (propaganda film) was giving about ""666 copies"" of the movie through his fans, as part of a ""War on Easter"" campaign. Fans were supposed to get copies and put them in churches or other places where Easter-going Christians would see them. This is the atheist equivalent of fundamentalist Christians leaving Chick tracts at bus stops, laundromats, bathroom stalls, etc. though putting them in a neighbor's house of worship seems a little more intrusive to me.In his movie, Flemming starts by comparing Christians being wrong about Geocentrism to them being wrong about other stuff, like the existence of Jesus. At least that's what its made clear the movie is eventually about. This of course is a mistake, because he's comparing the scientific consensus at the time of Galileo to the foundational historical basis for Christianity.Flemming goes on to complain about how bloody ""the Passion of the Christ"" was (as if manipulating viewers or using blood to sell tickets isn't something that all sorts of filmmakers and documentary makers do, regardless of religion or lack thereof).He mocks people ""on the street"" coming out of a Billy Graham style revival for not knowing the history of various ancient pagan gods (I doubt most people coming off of a college campus would know those names either, unless they were taking a course specifically on it).He reiterates discredited theories like those of ""Acharya S"" (Dorothy Murdock) which also appear in ""Zeitgeist the Movie"" and ""Religulous"" (shame on you Bill Maher) that come from Kersey Grave's obsolete work ""The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors"" which purported to claim that all of the various religions (including the Abrahamic faiths) were derived from ancient sun-worship and that all the pagan gods were basically the same person, etc. This ""mythicist"" background is not solely the work of Graves however, as Gerald Massey (a ""self taught"" archeologist nearly a century ago wrote a bunch of stuff attempting to tie Christianity to ancient Egypt, at a time when Egyptology was in its infancy and has long since moved on). In addition, more recent writers like Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy wrote about them in ""the Jesus Mysteries"" (a book featuring an amulet of a crucified figure on the cover now recognized by most archeologists as a fake). Jordan Maxwell spun similar types of theories using false etymologies for words and made-up historical ""facts"" (apparently to try to get people to believe in space aliens). Retired pastor Tom Harpur even recently shocked his former academic colleagues by supporting the pagan copycat theory which casts the existence of Jesus into doubt. The related theory that Christianity was hopelessly corrupted by ""paganism"" and ""politics"" at some early stage is advocated even by some radical Christian writers, like the ""house church"" advocates Frank Viola and George Barna. So Flemming's demagoguery is merely giving a stage to some of the ideas that are out there (again, mostly from the internet and the speculation outside academic scholarship).Flemming interviews people like Robert Price who say bizarre things about Jesus not existing, comparing him to comic book characters (historical figures whether their accounts are exaggerated or not are not the same as characters created as deliberate fiction intended for entertainment). Dr. Price, a legitimate New Testament scholar (though one on the fringe, last I heard he taught a distance learning course from some website, though he used to run an internet journal of ""Higher Criticism"" primarily for atheists and radical critics of religion) says that ""Some Christians"" believed that Jesus lived a century earlier (than is commonly believed) during the time of Alexander Janneus. The trouble is that this statement is completely dishonest. I know exactly what he is referring to, a polemical Jewish (not Christian) work called the 'Toledoth Yeshu' (look it up) which if anyone reads it, can see is clearly satire from a writer who is familiar with the New Testament and Christian doctrine. This is not a serious alternative account of the history of Jesus, and certainly not a representation of what early Christians actually believed (considering it was written many centuries after the NT).Flemming misquotes ancient writers like Justin Martyr, much in the way that Zeitgeist does, with the idea that somehow this ancient Christian was forced to admit the pagan religions were all just like Jesus, and so his only excuse was to say that the devil traveled back in time and change everything so it would look that way. The message we're meant to take away is that even the ancient Christians ""knew"" their religion was just a plagiarism, and Jesus probably never existed. But as Justin's writings are available for free viewing online and can be read in context (they are pretty short, as ink and paper were expensive back then), we can see that Justin is arguing no such thing, and really he has been badly misrepresented. In fact, no ancient critic of Christianity argued that Jesus didn't exist, or that he was copied from pagan gods, and no Christian argues against such a position (leading one to believe the Jesus Myther position didn't exist in ancient times). In fact, the Myther position was first proposed in the 19th century by Bruno Bauer, and has failed to gain any credence since, except amongst conspiracy theorists in the radical atheist community (especially on the internet, where even the worst ideas achieve a degree of immortality).In arguing that the date of the Gospels is too late to contain reliable history, again this is something anyone familiar with New Testament scholarship (and for the record, many NT scholars are not practicing Christians, as if one should assume all Christians must be liars!) knows that our knowledge of the historical existence of Jesus is not dependent upon the four gospels alone, but also the works of Paul (which are much earlier than the Gospels, and despite what silence Mythicist Earl Doherty says, do indeed depict Jesus as a real human being, a Jewish man who walked the earth in living memory of Paul, James his brother, John and Simon Peter his disciples), and the hypothetical ""Q"" Document. It is noteworthy that the ""Q"" theory is not favored by most evangelical Christians and those of the fundamentalist bent, but is accepted even by secular critical scholars. Again, these sources are very early, and even the Pauline letters cite earlier material. All again pointing to a real historical man that lived in the recent past, not a dreamy, other-worldly mythical being dreamt up in the minds of the writers (and why indeed dream up such a figure? if they were just making it up, why not make him a lot bigger and more successful like an Augustus or Alexander or Gilgamesh?). Next one could start arguing that James, John, Paul, and Peter never existed either (which some mythers are happy to do!). One might as well argue that Josephus, our primary ancient non-Christian source for Jesus, also didn't exist. Mythers are also inclined to dismiss any reference to Jesus as an ""interpolation"" or corruption, but usually in a knee-jerk manner, without justification. We can't simply dismiss a piece of evidence as a forgery without justification for doing so, simply because it doesn't fit a pre-determined conclusion. That's not how historical scholarship works, but people like Flemming (and his intended audience) are either unaware or uncaring of such standards, it seems.Flemming complains about fundamentalism, specifically the Religious Right (which of course are the target of complaints by many Christians as well, don't forget that). He quotes Luke 19:27 out of context to imply that Jesus wanted all non-believers killed, or that Christians think Jesus taught that. Reading the context (the entirety of Chapter 19 of Luke's Gospel) makes it clear he is quoting a character in a parable, not asking his followers to kill in his name. Anyone who can read, can see that's not the case, so Flemming has little to fear from hoards of bloodthirsty Christians storming his home anytime soon. It's also worth mentioning that chapter and verse numbers were a medieval addition to the Biblical texts as an aide to scribes and lectors, so the ""context"" of a passage often extends beyond the chapter and verse where one finds a quotation.Flemming interviews Richard Carrier, an atheist graduate student writer who talks about how a person doesn't need to be religious to be moral (Carrier at this time was studying to be a historian, he has since earned his doctorate and is in the process of writing a book on how he thinks Jesus probably didn't exist, though he takes the ""silence"" approach instead of the pagan copycat theory). Carrier, to his credit, knows that Kersey Graves' work is worthless (and to Flemming's credit, he later admitted it was a mistake to use any of Graves' work in the movie).That's another thing, Flemming here seems to be exploring the many possible ""alternatives"" and trying to gather reasons to reject Christianity.He argues that pastors are mean, preachers say politically incorrect things, that Passion movies are violent, that people at revivals are ignorant. He says maybe Jesus was a pagan copycat savior. Or maybe there isn't enough evidence to prove Jesus was really a historical figure (silence mythers say this, people like Earl Doherty).The fact is though that this is bad scholarship. Even agnostic writers like Bart Ehrman have written debunkings of the ""silence myther"" and ""pagan copycat"" theories of Jesus Mythicism. Of course they are getting incredible flack from people like Acharya S and Richard Carrier who seek to profit from the publicity amongst internet atheists and atheist students that these types of theories generate. Can't sell books and make speaking appearances if real scholars are discrediting your work now can you? But I'm not a conspiracy theorist.The ideas Flemming presents in the movie are either irrelevant (the truth of Jesus' claims are not invalidated by modern people who claim to follow him but fail at it; a religion isn't judged solely by one filmmaker's artistic representation of it which is based on tastes anyway, etc) or contradictory (Jesus could not be both a known pagan copycat and simply not exist for lack of historical evidence while being portrayed from ancient times as a historical person who actually lived on earth). The ""experts"" he quotes don't agree with him, and don't agree with each other. All he seems to be looking for are a bunch of different reasons to ""doubt.""Moving on, Flemming tries to get the people behind ""Snopes.com"" to admit that Christianity started as an urban legend, but kinda fails.He interviews Alan Dundes (the often controversial expert on folklore at USC Berkley) to get him to say that Jesus fits a ""heroic template"" kind of deal (using Lord Ragland's list) and therefore is probably a figure of folklore rather than history. One can argue with this method as being so overly broad and cherry-picking as to be useless. Sadly Prof. Dundes died shortly afterward.Flemming ends the movie by holding an interview with his former Christian school principal and then ambushing partway through about how he shouldn't have taught people that his faith was true and scaring people without proof. It ended badly and Flemming put the interview in the movie even though the principal asked him not to. He proceeds to the old chapel where he says he prayed to Jesus and basically ""got saved"" so many times and dramatically looks into the camera and says ""I deny the Holy Spirit.""The explanation is that Mr. Flemming thought, growing up, that there was an ""unforgivable sin"" and if you doubted the existence of the Holy Spirit, you could not be forgiven and would be eternally damned to hell. Here he is asserted his ""faith"" that Christianity is false, God doesn't exist, and calling all atheists to 'come out of the closet.' This lead to the youtube ""Blasphemy Challenge.""Of course anyone schooled in actual Biblical theology (rather than fearful memories of a fundamentalist school principal) whether Catholic or Protestant will know that in context, the ""blasphemy of the Holy Spirit"" has nothing to do with doubting the existence of God. In context, it refers to Matthew chapter 12 (which anyone can read for free online in a variety of translations or in the original Greek for that matter), where some Jewish opponents of Jesus witness him casting out demons, then declare ""He casts out demons by Beelzebul."" I encourage you to read it for yourself, but it refers to those who witness the miracles of God and attribute them to the power of the devil. The only other sense that theologians (Catholic, for instance) regard the ""unforgivable sin"" is in terms of a person's stubborn rejection of the Holy Spirit's ability to forgive our sin. As long as one remains in that mental state, they cannot be forgiven, because they are rejecting forgiveness itself. That is not truly unforgivable however, as the person may come out of that and accept God's forgiveness. In Christianity theology, one can have reassurance that if one fears one has committed the ""unforgivable sin"" they probably haven't.So in sum total I would give this video zero stars just for sheer misinformation. Sadly, by waving the ""proud atheist"" banner, Flemming gets far more of a pass from viewers than he deserves. I give him far more credit than I do the director of ""Zeitgeist."" In a way, I come from this movie feeling sorry for Mr. Flemming more than angry at him for so distorting the truth.The movie is very low-budget, with cheap looking sets and lighting and lots of stock footage (much like Peter Joseph's ""Zeitgeist""), the sort of thing you'd prefer to watch online than pay actual money to see on a physical media.I imagine some people unfortunate enough to end up with those 666 copies are still trying to pawn them off. At one time this was viewable (even with the ""dvd extras"" which are extended interviews) on sites like youtube for free. For a much better defense of atheism, read Christopher Hitchens or Bertrand Russell. For a much better treatment of the historical Jesus, there are a myriad of writers to choose from (Luke Timothy Johnson, NT Wright, Bart Ehrman, Geza Vermes, Mark Allen Powell, E.P. Sanders, Robert Van Voorst). Even Marcus Borg would be more profitable time spent.Many websites have gone exhaustively over Flemming's movie and corrected his errors on the Bible or the history of the Church. So if you want to seek ""the truth"" it is out there. But save your money this time.",1,"""This is just a simulation"" of a factual documentary",1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,15600,"['one', 'good', 'reason', 'view', 'DVD', 'then', 'see', 'mindset',

955848,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B000CAPZBC,Larry L. Looney,"[9, 10]","As most of the positive reviews of this film have pointed out, there are a lot of good points made, and a wealth of valuable information and insight presented by the filmmaker.  The best parts, in my view, were the direct interviews : Robert Price, Richard Carrier, and especially Sam Harris (Harris' two books are must-reads, by the way).  Their comments were thoughtful, probing and insightful.  Where the film fell short (again, this is my take) is when Brian Flemming (who wrote, directed and narrated this film) opens his mouth.  I don't disagree with his viewpoint necessarily, but he comes across as what could only be described as 'snarky' too much of the time, sometimes descending to a level that were it not for the technical polish of the project would lead me to believe this was some sort of high-school project.  The scene where he finds the chapel at his old religious school open and goes inside with his camera, winding up stepping in front of it to 'deny the holy spirit' on camera had too much of a 'I'm a naughty-boy, nyah nyah nyah' feel to it for me.Also, in one of the bonus interviews, where Flemming is speaking with Sam Harris on the subject of morality, and how its existence is not dependent on religion as a foundation, Flemming makes a joke about the Swedes (who were brought up by Harris as an example of a country NOT dependent on religion for moral values) being 'sheep-f'ers' (and yes, I GET IT, that he's being sarcastic, supporting Harris' premise that morality does not need religion to exist).  The look that passes across Harris' face, only for a second, shows that he's surprised by this comment, and, I would hazard to guess, perhaps thinks it's more than a little inappropriate or over the line in what should be more of an intellectual discussion.None of these 'offenses' I've listed affected me because of any religious feelings I harbor -- believe me, there aren't any.  As I said, I believe that the information Flemming is presented is important and needs to be heard / seen by more people.  I just don't think this film is going to change anyone's mind, mainly because the attitude projected is simply too sarcastic.Needless to say, others have differing opinions, and I don't expect anyone to make up their mind without seeing it.",3,good points and bad points...,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,2280,"['most', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'points', 'made', 'wealth', 'valuable', 'information', 'insight', 'presented', 'filmmaker', 'best', 'parts', 'view', 'were', 'direct', 'interviews', 'Robert', 'Price', 'Richard', 'Carrier', 'especially', 'Sam', 'Harris', 'Harris', 'two', 'books', 'are', 'must-reads', 'way', 'comments', 'were', 'thoughtful', 'probing', 'insightful', 'Where', 'film', 'fell', 'short', 'again', 'take', 'when', 'Brian', 'Flemming', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'narrated', 'film', 'mouth', 'do', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'viewpoint', 'necessarily', 'across', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', ""'snarky"", 'too', 'much', 'time', 'sometimes', 'descending', 'level', 'were', 'not', 'technical', 'polish', 'project', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'was', 'sort', 'high-school', 'project', 'scene', 'where', 'chapel', 'old', 'religious', 'school', 'open', 'inside', 'camera', 'winding', 'up', 'stepping', 'front', ""'deny"", 'holy', 'spirit', 'camera', 'had', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'naughty-boy', 'nyah', 'nyah', 'nyah', 'feel', 'me.Also', 'one', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'where', 'Flemming', 'speaking', 'Sam', 'Harris', 'subject', 'morality', 'how', 'existence', 'not', 'dependent', 'religion', 'foundation', 'Flemming', 'joke', 'Swedes', 'who', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'Harris', 'example', 'country', 'NOT', 'dependent', 'religion', 'moral', 'values', 'being', ""'sheep-f'ers"", 'yes', 'GET', 'IT', 'being', 'sarcastic', 'supporting', 'Harris', 'premise', 'morality', 'not', 'need', 'religion', 'exist', 'look', 'Harris', 'face', 'only', 'second', 'surprised', 'comment', 'would', 'hazard', 'guess', 'perhaps', 'more', 'little', 'inappropriate', 'line', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'intellectual', 'discussion.None', ""'offenses"", ""'ve"", 'listed', 'affected', 'religious', 'feelings', 'harbor', 'believe', 'are', ""n't"", 'said', 'believe', 'information', 'Flemming', 'presented', 'important', 'be', 'heard', '/', 'seen', 'more', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'going', 'change', 'anyone', 'mind', 'mainly', 'attitude', 'projected', 'simply', 'too', 'sarcastic.Needless', 'say', 'others', 'have', 'differing', 'opinions', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anyone', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'seeing']",The God Who Wasn't There
955849,A3JHO01J3H0GJ9,B000CAPZBC,"Leon Baradat ""Homebrewer""","[2, 7]","I hate to say, this movie was a disappointment. It sounded like a serious, thorough look (or as much as can be covered in an hour) at descriptions of Jesus and maybe giving solid reasons why the historical Jesus may well not have existed. It got off to a good start, discussing the stories of Jesus in the first three gospels, and then showing what's wrong with that (they were written much later, they Very Closely Parallel other figures of the time we consider mythical, etc.), and touching on how Paul is an inadequate stopgap between the two. Interesting stuff so far. Then he gets into some of the down sides to religion, which is fine, then slides down into showing segments from The Passion of the Christ. That would have been ok if he'd been going somewhere constructive, but instead, that led him... To go back and interview the principal of the parochial school he attended.

You don't have to be either an atheist or non-religious to think that Jesus never existed.

There's a name for us: we're called Jews and Buddhists and Hindus.The question of atheism is another matter altogether. This DVD deals with the question of whether Christianity is founded on the basis of a complete falsehood. That question too is a phony. It's entirely possible that there was a rabbi named Yeheshua to whose biography a lot of amplifications have been added. The real issue is whether the Jesus stories are complete or partial fabrications.It's possible to be a devout Christian and admit that there's some myth added to the history. It's also possible to be a thoroughgoing atheist and allow that there was a fellow named Yeheshua or Jesus who preached in Israel about 2000 years ago.This DVD does a worthwhile job of raising the question, but it doesn't begin to explore the issue in any depth.

I truly believe that despite all the arguments from xians that Jesus Ben Pantera was crucified and because Jewish tradition was looking for a messiah the convergence of that event, the build up of a necessary messiah in Jewish folklore and the previous messiah myths that Jesus Ben Pantera got transformed into the idea we read about today in the bible.

955853,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000CAPZBC,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 7]","The God Who Wasn't There unequivocally questions whether Jesus was the son of God--and it goes further to say the least. The film spends time exploring whether or not Jesus ever even lived--although it stops short of any conclusive statement that Jesus was a mythical character. Needless to say, as someone else already noted, if you're a devout follower of someone like Rev. Pat Robinson, you should probably stay away from this movie. Although filmmaker Brian Flemming makes a clear effort to give equal time to those who preach about Jesus and believe in him, you can tell Flemming isn't truly interested in their side of the story. On the other hand, however, if you do want to gain some insight and information about the origins of Christianity that you may not have had before, then I recommend that you do watch this film.At the beginning of this film we see the history of Christ but it's almost exclusively during the last one or two years of his life. There is his baptism by John the Baptist; the miracles Jesus is said to have performed; Jesus' entry into Jerusalem riding on a donkey; Jesus becoming furious with the financial traders at the temple; Jesus being sentenced to death and having to carry his own cross to the mountain where he is crucified. Flemming then gradually begins to make his case against the existence of Christ by noting that the earliest written accounts of Jesus came from Mark, Matthew, Luke and John--but since they were written at least forty years after Jesus died, Flemming wonders aloud in this film if these four men got their stories straight.Brian Flemming also wastes little time in letting people know that he is no longer a devout Christian; now he doubts if Jesus even existed. Brian interviews some very well spoken people including historian Richard Carrier; Alan Dundes, Professor of Folklore at UC Berkeley; Scott Butcher, a devout Christian who believes Jesus is coming soon and Dr. Ronald Sipus, Superintendent of Village Christian Schools where Brian himself was a student some years ago. The interviews are presented in such a way that it's all very interesting even if I didn't agree with everything that everybody said. In addition, we also get brief film clips of religious leaders speaking including one film clip of Dean Wycoff of The Moral Majority; he equates homosexuality to murder and other sins.Although Brian Flemming would have us all believe that Jesus was and remains fictional, that is something everyone has to decide for themselves. Flemming presents his case in a somewhat biased light, although one of the stronger parts of his case is that there aren't many writings at all about Jesus until a long period of time had elapsed after Jesus died. This does raise the question of the accuracy of the writings--did Mark, Matthew, Luke and John ever actually meet Jesus? We're left wondering; we just don't know for sure. We also learn that Paul never mentioned anything of Jesus' life except the crucifixion, the resurrection and the ascension. This lack of information from Paul could be one reason why so many Christians don't know much about the origins of their own religion.As for the ending, I'm not giving that one away. However, I will say that there are one or two quick shockers that end the film with quite a punch!The DVD has a few good extra features; the extended interviews are quite well done. We also get optional running commentary tracks from scientist Richard Dawkins and Earl Doherty.The God Who Wasn't There is a very good documentary that examines whether or not Jesus was the Messiah and it spends a fair amount of time compiling its evidence that Christ might not have lived at all. While this film is clearly not for the devout and deeply religious Christian, it could make an impact on others who do want to examine these issues. Indeed, some of the factual evidence we get along the way is fascinating.",4,now talk about a controversial film !!!,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,3905,"['God', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'unequivocally', 'questions', 'Jesus', 'was', 'son', 'God', 'further', 'say', 'least', 'film', 'time', 'exploring', 'not', 'Jesus', 'ever', 'even', 'lived', 'short', 'conclusive', 'statement', 'Jesus', 'was', 'mythical', 'character', 'Needless', 'say', 'someone', 'else', 'already', 'noted', ""'re"", 'devout', 'follower', 'someone', 'Rev', 'Pat', 'Robinson', 'should', 'probably', 'stay', 'away', 'movie', 'filmmaker', 'Brian', 'Flemming', 'clear', 'effort', 'give', 'equal', 'time', 'who', 'preach', 'Jesus', 'believe', 'can', 'tell', 'Flemming', ""n't"", 'truly', 'interested', 'side', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'do', 'want', 'gain', 'insight', 'information', 'origins', 'Christianity', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'then', 'recommend', 'do', 'watch', 'beginning', 'film', 'see', 'history', 'Christ', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'last', 'one', 'two', 'years', 'life', 'baptism', 'John', 'Baptist', 'miracles', 'Jesus', 'said', 'have', 'performed', 'Jesus', 'entry', 'Jerusalem', 'riding', 'donkey', 'Jesus', 'becoming', 'furious', 'financial', 'traders', 'temple', 'Jesus', 'being', 'sentenced', 'death', 'having', 'carry', 'own', 'cross', 'mountain', 'where', 'crucified', 'Flemming', 'then', 'gradually', 'make', 'case', 'existence', 'Christ', 'noting', 'earliest', 'written', 'accounts', 'Jesus', 'came', 'Mark', 'Matthew', 'Luke', 'John', 'were', 'written', 'least', 'forty', 'years', 'Jesus', 'died', 'Flemming', 'wonders', 'aloud', 'film', 'four', 'men', 'got', 'stories', 'straight.Brian', 'Flemming', 'also', 'little', 'time', 'letting', 'people', 'know', 'no', 'longer', 'devout', 'Christian', 'now', 'Jesus', 'even', 'existed', 'Brian', 'very', 'well', 'spoken', 'people', 'including', 'historian', 'Richard', 'Carrier', 'Alan', 'Dundes', 'Professor', 'Folklore', 'UC', 'Berkeley', 'Scott', 'Butcher', 'devout', 'Christian', 'who', 'Jesus', 'coming', 'soon', 'Dr.', 'Ronald', 'Sipus', 'Superintendent', 'Village', 'Christian', 'Schools', 'where', 'Brian', 'was', 'student', 'years', 'ago', 'interviews', 'are', 'presented', 'such', 'way', 'very', 'interesting', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'everything', 'everybody', 'said', 'addition', 'also', 'get', 'brief', 'film', 'clips', 'religious', 'leaders', 'speaking', 'including', 'one', 'film', 'clip', 'Dean', 'Wycoff', 'Moral', 'Majority', 'homosexuality', 'murder', 'other', 'sins.Although', 'Brian', 'Flemming', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Jesus', 'was', 'fictional', 'something', 'everyone', 'decide', 'Flemming', 'presents', 'case', 'somewhat', 'biased', 'light', 'one', 'stronger', 'parts', 'case', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'writings', 'Jesus', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'had', 'elapsed', 'Jesus', 'died', 'raise', 'question', 'accuracy', 'writings', 'did', 'Mark', 'Matthew', 'Luke', 'John', 'ever', 'actually', 'meet', 'Jesus', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'also', 'learn', 'Paul', 'never', 'mentioned', 'anything', 'Jesus', 'life', 'crucifixion', 'resurrection', 'ascension', 'lack', 'information', 'Paul', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'Christians', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'origins', 'own', 'religion.As', 'ending', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'one', 'away', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'quick', 'shockers', 'end', 'film', 'punch', 'DVD', 'few', 'good', 'extra', 'features', 'extended', 'interviews', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'get', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'scientist', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'Earl', 'Doherty.The', 'God', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'not', 'Jesus', 'was', 'Messiah', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'compiling', 'evidence', 'Christ', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'lived', 'film', 'clearly', 'not', 'devout', 'deeply', 'religious', 'Christian', 'could', 'make', 'impact', 'others', 'who', 'do', 'want', 'examine', 'issues', 'Indeed', 'factual', 'evidence', 'get', 'way', 'fascinating']",The God Who Wasn't There

Until recently, I thought my faith was even more affirmed by Gibson's version of Jesus' passion. However, this film affirmed my suspicions about Jesus, the Bible, if not God himself.I recently decided to take it upon myself to do extensive research on Jesus to see if he is recorded anywhere in history as an actual historic figure. While I have found evidence of a person who closely resembles a man that is similar to Jesus, he was not divine. As this film points out, there are no records of Pontius Pilate having ordered the execution of anyone named Jesus at all.Despite the film's terrible production values, it makes some interesting and factual points. For example, I was also stunned to learn about the 40 year gap between the year of the alleged 'death' of Jesus and when the Book of Mark was authored. The other points the interviewees brought up were interesting as well. For example, as the film points out when the Jewish Pharisees held their trial for Jesus on passover eve would have been contrary to Judaism and that the story of Jesus correlates with many other previous pagan/mythological tales.My father was an Episcopalian priest. I was born and raised to believe in God, the Bible and Jesus himself and that Jesus and God actually exist. However, after watching this film and conducting my research I have concluded that, there are not any gods or supernatural phenomena to believe in at all.If you are a Christian, Jewish, or even Muslim, this film is certain to provoke you to think and I urge you to watch it and/or question your religion's beliefs. While I do not regret my strong faith (which magnified the past few years since seeing Gibson's film) it is clear that one cannot base his or her beliefs entirely on faith which is the basis of religion itself.As far as the alternatives to religion are concerned, I plan on getting involved in non-sectarian charitable work or even a secularist group.

However, please don't see it if you're a fundamentalist Christian easily offended by challenges to your dogma.  You'll hate it.  Of course, one of the biggest criticisms the movie puts forth is that many Christians cannot tolerate ideas counter to what they accept as truth even if presented as theory.  In other words, Christianity works because people refuse to hear anything that might be construed as questionable.  Yes, many hardcore Christians are blissfully ignorant.

I don't know what I was expecting, but I thought it was a bit dumbed down and focused too much on popular culture, but I think now that that was the point.

The interviews of Christians outside the Billy Graham Crusade at the Rose Bowl explaining the life of Jesus and then struggling with ambiguities how they believe Christianity spread after Christ's death is the knowledge most Christians have about their faith.  Most people are not going to be historians of ancient times who will dive into their studies with questions that might put doubt into their beliefs.  I never wondered how the Christian religion spread, so the information produced in this documentary was very eye-opening.Brian Flemming, who produced this film, was a student of Village Christian School in Sun Valley, California.  He learned that the one thing that was unforgivable and would send you to damnation was the denial of the Holy Spirit.  This caused Flemming great terror and anxiety when doubts crept into his mind.  In this film, he returns to the school and chapel that were the scenes of his fears.  He questions the Superintendent until the Superintendent begins to suspect a rat and leaves.  Then Flemming gets some closure at the chapel.  Before all that, these are the most important points I learned from this documentary.A gap of 40 years exist between the life of Christ and the Book of Mark which documents his ministry.  The Apostle Paul who wrote about Christianity and sought Christian converts during this gap only knew of Jesus's death and resurrection.  He did not place these events on earth.  No one seemed to remember that Jesus lived on earth until the Book of Mark.Folklore Professor Alan Dundes lists the 22-points of the mythological hero which uses Oedipus as the model.  Jesus shared 19 of these characteristics and, it was acknowledged at the beginning of the Christian church, that Jesus's story was similar to that of pagan gods told long before.  The explanation Christian leaders gave was that Satan foresaw Jesus and counterfeited his story through other pagan gods beforehand so his story would not be believed.Other parts of the hour-long documentary discuss the military aspect of Christianity and the obsession with blood sacrifice.  With extremists being more in line with the literal translation of the Bible, where does moderate Christianity fit in?  Then there is the Rapture Letters guy.  He has a website where you can submit email addresses and he will send out emails when the Rapture comes explaining that the sender has gone to Heaven.  I can picture it:  ""It's Armageddon!?  Wait!  I need to get on my laptop so I can send out these emails!""The bonus material includes extended interviews and ""commentaries"" with such people as ""The Jesus Puzzle"" author Earl Doherty, the ""Raving Atheist"" blogger and Richard Dawkins.  Actually, they aren't really commentaries but telephone interviews pasted together.  I don't know why the documentary needs to be playing in the background.  It's distracting.  In sum, this documentary was not earth-shattering, but it did bring up important points of which I was not aware and, for that, I  am glad I purchased it.  Christians and scholars who are more knowledgeable will probably not gain much from it and won't be swayed one way or another.",4,"""I am not afraid""--Brian Flemming",1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,3477,"['was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'dumbed', 'down', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'popular', 'culture', 'think', 'now', 'was', 'point', 'So', 'many', 'mainstream', 'Christians', 'get', 'knowledge', 'movies', 'Christ', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'interviews', 'Christians', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Crusade', 'Rose', 'Bowl', 'explaining', 'life', 'Jesus', 'then', 'struggling', 'ambiguities', 'how', 'believe', 'Christianity', 'spread', 'Christ', 'death', 'knowledge', 'most', 'Christians', 'have', 'faith', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'historians', 'ancient', 'times', 'who', 'will', 'dive', 'studies', 'questions', 'might', 'put', 'doubt', 'beliefs', 'never', 'wondered', 'how', 'Christian', 'religion', 'spread', 'information', 'produced', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'eye-opening.Brian', 'Flemming', 'who', 'produced', 'film', 'was', 'student', 'Village', 'Christian', 'School', 'Sun', 'Valley', 'California', 'learned', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'unforgivable', 'would', 'send', 'damnation', 'was', 'denial', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'caused', 'Flemming', 'great', 'terror', 'anxiety', 'when', 'doubts', 'crept', 'mind', 'film', 'school', 'chapel', 'were', 'scenes', 'fears', 'questions', 'Superintendent', 'Superintendent', 'suspect', 'rat', 'leaves', 'Then', 'Flemming', 'closure', 'chapel', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'points', 'learned', 'documentary.A', 'gap', '40', 'years', 'exist', 'life', 'Christ', 'Book', 'Mark', 'documents', 'ministry', 'Apostle', 'Paul', 'who', 'wrote', 'Christianity', 'sought', 'Christian', 'converts', 'gap', 'only', 'knew', 'Jesus', 'death', 'resurrection', 'did', 'not', 'place', 'events', 'earth', 'one', 'seemed', 'remember', 'Jesus', 'lived', 'earth', 'Book', 'Mark.Folklore', 'Professor', 'Alan', 'Dundes', '22-points', 'mythological', 'hero', 'Oedipus', 'model', 'Jesus', 'shared', '19', 'characteristics', 'was', 'acknowledged', 'beginning', 'Christian', 'church', 'Jesus', 'story', 'was', 'similar', 'pagan', 'gods', 'told', 'long', 'before', 'explanation', 'Christian', 'leaders', 'gave', 'was', 'Satan', 'foresaw', 'Jesus', 'counterfeited', 'story', 'other', 'pagan', 'gods', 'beforehand', 'so', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'believed.Other', 'parts', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'discuss', 'military', 'aspect', 'Christianity', 'obsession', 'blood', 'sacrifice', 'extremists', 'being', 'more', 'line', 'literal', 'translation', 'Bible', 'where', 'moderate', 'Christianity', 'fit', 'Then', 'Rapture', 'Letters', 'guy', 'website', 'where', 'can', 'submit', 'email', 'addresses', 'will', 'send', 'out', 'emails', 'when', 'Rapture', 'explaining', 'sender', 'gone', 'Heaven', 'can', 'picture', 'Armageddon', 'Wait', 'need', 'get', 'laptop', 'can', 'send', 'out', 'emails', 'bonus', 'material', 'extended', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'such', 'people', 'Jesus', 'Puzzle', 'author', 'Earl', 'Doherty', 'Raving', 'Atheist', 'blogger', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'Actually', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'commentaries', 'telephone', 'interviews', 'pasted', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'documentary', 'be', 'playing', 'background', 'distracting', 'sum', 'documentary', 'was', 'not', 'earth-shattering', 'did', 'bring', 'up', 'important', 'points', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'Christians', 'scholars', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'knowledgeable', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'gain', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'swayed', 'one', 'way']",The God Who Wasn't There

955861,A3KWVFQ9GAXJ6R,B000CAPZBC,Oannes,"[2, 4]","I too, came to this DVD, in the hope that it would be a satisfying and interesting examination of the ""facts"" surrounding the early years of Christianity, the writing of the Christian Gospels, and the examination of any existing archeological evidence for Jesus Christ in the first place. Whilst I found the presentation of the above topic areas to be fairly well presented/explained, for a general audience, I felt more detail could have been presented in the interesting area of the similarity of some of the ""Pagan"" Deity's, such as Mithras, Osiris, Prometheus and the like, but overall I felt that this part was reasonably well done, after all a few Internet searches is all one needs these days.Where I felt that Brian Fleming went a bit ""off the beam"" was his treatment of the school Pastor, Dr Ronald Sipus? from Mr Flemings old Christian school, this part had me feeling sorry for the pastor, and I was cringing in my seat. This almost seems to me to be a ""cheap shot""  and could have been better handled, it's like blaming the Janitor for the sins of the CEO's and corporate heads? I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of a discussion about the ""brainwashing"" methods of fundamentalist ""cults"", how they keep people in a state of control, through fear, financial issues, and the like, but that's going pretty far into other areas.Perhaps a run down of contemporary areas of Theology, covering Gnosticism, mystery religions and esoteric Judaism, is a bit of an ask for a general documentary such as this, I would say that it was entertaining overall and moved along at a good pace, but by the time the films ends I was left wanting more, it seemed to just peter out a bit.Good supplementary material, and extended interviews with Robert M.

955862,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000CAPZBC,OverTheMoon,"[12, 15]","Brian Flemming is an ex-evangelical. His theology is thus based on post-reformation interpretations of Christianity. This documentary may sway evangelicals or give atheists an angle on something new (mythology) but Catholic apologetics will counter it. Horrifically Brian Flemming has undergone something that the Catholic Church stays well clear from since Vatican II (see aggiornamento). That is to stay away from the focus on salvation through fear (imperfect contrition). The Catholic Church understands that this is theology in the wrong direction. Christianity without love is considered heretical anyway. It appears that Brian has gone through the darker side of Christianity (if it can be called Christianity). In many ways Brian is interpreting the Bible for himself. This is pretty much the standard evangelical stance but Catholic policy has always maintained that guidance is important. Brian's case is a good example of why that guidance cannot be underestimated.`The God who wasn't there' (TGWWT) starts by saying that Christianity was wrong when the Church did not approve heliocentricity forwarded by scientists (some of whom where also clergy). This is true and culminated in the Galileo affair but a complete understanding of this part of the historical record shows that there where many problems on both sides. The Church relied on arguments styled on biblical interpretations that Saint Augustine warned against (using direct literal interpretations rather than understanding their historical context [see Dei Verbum for the St. Augustine ref. in section 12]). The Pope believed that Galileo (his childhood friend) had insulted him publicly (which was a criminal offense at that time) in one of Galileo's works.TGWWT then introduces us to happy Christians but also Christians who did bad things or are hoping for an apocalypse. We get a short movie about the life of Christ edited into a montage from various films about Jesus. The documentary filmmaker, Brian Flemming then interviews a woman taking care of her baby to explain the history of Christianity to him. When she limits her response to the day of Pentecost Brian Flemming complains about how inadequate her knowledge is. I would personally like to see him try that one on with a Bishop instead of a mother taking care of her infant. He then questions other evangelicals on the history of the Church. This is actually a sore spot for evangelicals because they want to avoid mentioning Catholicism. Catholicism would have given better answers in that Jesus started a Church with apostolically succeeded Bishops who can trace their Church history back to Christ as a matter of the historical record. That would have given Flemming more meat to chew on than homing in on a busy evangelical mom. However Brian Flemming was probably brought up to reject the Catholic Church so maybe we can't blame him for not seeing that angle.Flemming then starts a timeline. He says that the Gospels came after Christ (who was crucified in 33 AD) and says that the other three are derived from Mark (known as Markan priority). He claims that since Mark talked about the destruction of the temple that the Gospels must occur after 70 AD. This might not be the case if we take it that the writing is prophetical (it could have prophesized the destruction before). Since this is more about historical criticism rather than supernatural possibilities historians go for the plus 70 AD date but it need not be. There are many early Christian writings not in the Bible (such as the Didache). Really a person needs to sit down and learn the history of the Bible here and the history of the early Church including the Judaism that came before it!Brian Flemming then asserts that Saul (St. Paul) was responsible for the gap between 33 AD and 70 AD based only on a post-resurrection experience of the risen Christ and that he did not know anything about Christ's actual life. However Paul meets the apostles in Acts 9:26 at the Council of Jerusalem. You can read about that Council elsewhere. Flemming then quotes Heb 8:4 to say that Paul believed that the death burial and resurrection of Christ was mythical. The Heb 8:4 says ""If Jesus had been on Earth"". Better translations read ""Now if he were on Earth"" (in relation to Jesus staying on Earth as opposed to going to heaven in this context). So Brian Flemming is probably victim to a bad translation but this is more like verse mining to push a point. Brian Flemming then claims that Paul is not even aware that Jesus was human. Paul calls Jesus a man in Rom 5:15, 5:17, 1Ti 2:5 for examples. The Council of Jerusalem pretty much shows that the Church was active during this timeframe where Brian Flemming says everyone forgot. The big problem here is that the history is with the Catholic Church, not with evangelical movements who don't want to talk about that Church which they historically parted with.Brian Flemming then goes for folklore professors (who thinks the apocryphal stories are rejected because of mysticism when in fact it was the Church that pronounced which books where to be accepted and rejected (see Council of Carthage III). Modernism is actually a 20th century phenomena and not an early Church position. See Modernism (Roman Catholicism). Read Lamentabili Sane. However the actual historical evidence for Jesus, whatever criteria is used, should be applied to all historical figures at that time. That is important. This area of research can be fun for everybody. There is lots more than just what Brian Flemming presents so the viewer doesn't really get a complete case history here.Robert M. Price has some interesting comments which should be verified by any serious researcher. The hero pattern myth theory is well presented as are the arguments of Price. These arguments can also be found in the controversial findings of the popular `Jesus seminar' and have a lot to do with early apologetics. It is called the Mythographic perspective of Jesus and is used by Brian Flemming to conclude that Jesus is mythological. This section of TGWWT is about Saint Justin Matyr who argued that devils where responsible for creating the pagan heros who are similar in person or deeds to Jesus is a whole topic that requires an apologists full attention and you need to check sources and date them. Saint Justin Matyr was actually a pagan convert who understood pagan mythology. Saint Justine claimed that pagans had gotten some of their ideas from earlier Jewish scriptures (believed to have contained the prophecies of Jesus) and had tried to imitate the actual messiah of the Jews, acts of which St. Justine attributes to the devil. These Greek myths may not predate Christ (there sources are post-Christ). Some occurred during Christ. The sources for these greek myths are post-Christian sources although archaeological coverage turns up shrines etc., the stories when dated usually conform to post-Christian events. Read up on Dionysus and Mithras. Study up on this whole topic. There are actually better `Jesus' candidates out there (Zalmoxis for example). The bigger issue here though is the Hellenzation of Judaism and its influence on Christianity. No historian can deny this but saying Christianity took from these legends may be a stretch.The history of the U.S Christian soldiers gets coverage (essentially fighting for God) and the problem with fundamentalism with respect to extremists groups who ignore the pacifism and non-retaliatory instructions of Christ (say an `Our Father' to find out about non-retaliatory) or read Luk 6:27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,. Brian Flemming uses Lk 19:27 to imply that Jesus asks his followers to kill for him. Luk 19:11-12 shows that Jesus is actually quoting from a parable. Lk 19:27 is popular with anti-Christianity quote mining.The rapture gets coverage. The rapture argument is post-reformation and is maybe 200 years old at best. It doesn't have a historical usage before that. It is based on Bible misinterpretation along the lines of the alleged `imminent return prophecy that didn't come to pass' conundrum. Sam Harris is quite interesting to listen to when he appears.While Jesus did imply that denying the Holy Spirit meant that the sin was unforgivable (so Brian Flemming sees only hell as the result of saying or thinking this) Jesus gave his apostles and those who succeeded them (see Act 1:26 for example) the power to forgive any sin in Jn 20:23. The denial of the Holy Spirit verse in Mat 12:31 may actually imply that people who are in the spirit, but do not explicitly acknowledge Jesus, may get into heaven. Seeing Brian say that he denies the Holy Spirit on camera is just silly more than anything. It just goes to show that his version of Christianity is probably one of the most warped ones around. I would agree with him that fundamentalism is out of control (as he plainly demonstrates by his version of Christianity, even if it draws a negative). I think there are many alternatives other than just letting completely go.I kind of feel sorry that he didn't do some better research but then again film festivals are a great way to make some money and I think his documentary is very good overall for a low-budget film maker. Kudos for that. I hope he makes a career out of making documentaries. Maybe go a little deeper next time?Oh yeah and that school principle. He isn't a good scientist but maybe he does a good job keeping kids from physical harm.

The filmmaker himself tries to push his atheist ideas on believers to question their faith . My question is Why ? What for ? People are free to decide to believe in God or not . I have read countless books on the subject and yes I believe in Jesus and in God . There was a historical Jesus as noted and written  down by ancient historians such  as Josephus  1 st c AD, The Roman historian Tacitus 1st c  AD also  Pliny  who was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. Even in the Jewish Talmud the Jews make reference to Jesus even though they do not believe him to be the messiah they acknowledged a real Jesus at the time existed  .Quote ; On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. Let me ask a question here .. do you think normal people hundreds of thousands  at the time with random  persecutions going on in the Roman empire would gladly die ""peacefully non violently ""in the arenas or tortured and burned  at the hands of their accusers if they did not really  believe in Jesus ? or maybe ,prehaps  had revelations to them from the holy spirit ,,.Yet they died willingly . Why because they believed in something real and had faith  .Do not confuse modern Christianity with  the real early apostolic  Christianity  . The inquisitions in the middle ages and crusades were not bible related or sanctioned by God but by men wrongly interpreting the word of God to their benefit or gain lets be clear on this. And this includes idiots like Pat Robinson, Jimmy Swaggert , and so on  he even makes a reference to charles manson as Jesus  etc . Now yes these references to Dionysus or Adonis or Osiris or Mithra  have similar stories to Christs life death and resurrection ""but these are all deceptions"" of the evil one to lay a foundation to confuse people before the truth and light came to this earth. So folks don't believe the hype of this film and to add to insult the filmmaker purposely deceives the school director as you will see.Also in the school chapel the filmmaker shouts out aloud an insult against the holy spirit to prove a point  , but why insult the holy spirit ? how childish .Jesus would ask why do you hate me so ?

Not because of the subject matter but it is so poorly done.  The historical elements should have more thoroughly dealt with.  The interviews with the believers don't serve much purpose since we know how little people really think when it comes to religeous matters.  The interviews with the academics was more interesting and proved to be of value.  Also of value were the excerpts from Mel Gibson' film about Christ.  It showed what a sadistic piece of garbage it is!  Had Jesus been subjected to the beatings that Gibson shows he would never have made it to the cross alive.  There is no justification in the Bible itself for the extent of the violence shown.  Clearly Gibson set out to make as exploitative film as he possibly could.

955871,AMWL7BL6SXNWK,B000CAPZBC,Scientific Mind,"[7, 8]","A colleague of mine loaned this DVD to me and I gave it a viewing. The narrator in a calm and nonchalant manner questions and brings up the fallacies of belief. He interviews several people including Alan Dundes who is an anthropology professor at the  University of California, Berkeley, neurology scientist Sam Harris and history professor Richard Carrier. Another individual is a superintendent of a Christian school in California which ends abruptly when the interviewee becomes entangled in his own answers and the narrator Brian Flemming points out the inconsistencies and fallacies in his answers. The superintendent does not wish to speak any further when he is backed into a corner of not being able to substantiate and backup his claims and reasons for teaching young children that the Christian view of the world is correct and reality.Christians won't like the video because it illustrates in the film the number of religious followings that had their own ""heros"" with an uncanny similar story to the biblical story of Jesus. One of the many problems for Christianity is that most of these stories which are very similar (virgin births, resurrections etc...) pre-date the birth of Jesus. So it calls into question the whole Jesus story as being nothing but a story and a myth. Flemming also touches on the psychology of how stories that are untrue and nothing but pure fiction gain traction and then switch to being factual and non-fiction in the human mind. Interesting.The film ended quickly and there was much more that could have been explored, but maybe Flemming was running out of time and money. It is a good piece of filmmaking (although not on the level of a NOVA or National Geographic program). Although not as polished as the previous mentioned programs, it still should bring up questions for Christians and definitely some red flags.

He has since abandoned his faith, and all faith in general.  Here, he calls upon people involved in the various organizations or schools of thought that fall under the umbrella term ""freethought,"" such as the Center For Inquiry (secular humanism) and infidels.org.  For balance, he also interviews practicing Christians (found at a Billy Graham Revival in California during 2004) and for a climactic showdown of sorts, Ronald Sipus, the head of Village Christian School, where Flemming attended.  Some clearly biased reviewers, who seem not to have actually seen the film, claim ""The God Who Wasn't There"" aims to make people of faith look foolish.  Mr. Flemming's interview style is gentle and polite, and he never ridicules anyone, even out of earshot.  What he does hold up to ridicule, however, is some of the more extreme beliefs that Christian leaders foist upon their followers, such as the idea that the Rapture (a.k.a. the End of the World) is coming within our lifetimes.  Needless to say, people have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of the world, and exactly zero of them have been right, so the current Armageddon fad (exemplified by the ""Left Behind"" series of novels) richly deserves skepticism and yes, ridicule.  The true believers presented here, including Mr. Sipus, are allowed to speak, and would only seem foolish if you don't share their enthusiasm for the Son of God.  The whole point of the film, of course, is to demonstrate that Jesus, from a historical point of view, was most likely a fictional character cobbled together from much older myths of heroes and blood sacrifice.  Along the way, Mr. Flemming disects ""modern"" Christianity's preoccupation with violence, concluding with scenes (shown without permission!) from Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ.""  In a scene by scene analysis, he shows the ""bloody Jesus"" (his words) has only a few minutes without gruesome violence, and notes how this is far and away the most popular version of the Jesus myth.  The overall style of the film is quick and witty (in the vein of ""Super Size Me""), and is aided by computer graphics and clips from old films to illustrate his point.  In any event, it never comes off like an academic snooze-fest, even if some can complain it's just a little too slick.  The feature run time is merely one hour, but the extended interviews included as special features add on another hour.  Also, if you insert the disc in your computer, you're provided with links to many of the research materials that Mr. Flemming used.  Also, at the very end of the film, we find out that a thematic sequel of sorts is in the works, called ""The Beast.""  This is due for release on June 6 of this year (that's right, 6/6/06--!).  This will apparently take much of the material in this film and put it in the context of a ""conventional"" narrative film whose basic story echoes (I would guess on purpose) ""The Da Vinci Code.""  Forgive me if that sounds in any way like an ad--I don't know Mr. Flemming or am involved in any of his projects--but it all sounds too juicy to pass up.  After all, it's hard out here for a non-believer, so we take what we can get.",5,God isn't dead.

I see religion the same way as any other human activity - it has inspired great music, literature, art, architecture, and philosophy, while at the same time, is responsible for untold suffering and destruction.  I can appreciate the music of Olivier Messiaen, and also decry the Catholic Church's facilitation of child molestation.It became clear by the end of the film that Flemming is very bitter about having been forced to attend a private religious school, and that this is his way of dealing with it.  His agenda led him to make several choices that were detrimental to the film.Assuming that Jesus did not exist, because of the lack of information covering the period between the assumed date of his death and the writing of the gospels, is unwarranted.  Paul does not tell the story of Jesus' life because his letters were addressed to other believers who would already be familiar with this information, so there would be no need to repeat it.  Later, as the story had to be disseminated to more people, the gospels were written.  Flemming makes the mistake of claiming that Mark was the first one, with the other three based on it.  Current scholarship posits a lost ""Q"" gospel that along with Mark, contributed to Matthew and Luke, while John is clearly from another source entirely.  Flemming makes a mistake similar to that made by the New Age community with regard to the gap in the record for Jesus' life from age 13 to 30, where they claim he went to India during this time and became a Buddhist.  Gaps in the record aren't necessarily meaningful - the existence of Julius Caesar is indisputable, and not called into question just because we may not have a complete record of his life.  A more fruitful inquiry would be to accept that Jesus lived, but to question whether he said and did what the gospels claim.Buttonholing attendees at a Pat Robertson rally and asking questions about obscure antecedents to Christianity is unfair.  How many people who accept the Theory of Natural Selection could explain the difference between Punctuated Equilibrium and Phyletic Gradualism, or say who Lamarck was?Flemming was clearly going for a Michael Moore moment in his interview with Sipus.  He missed a great opportunity here.  When someone Moore is interviewing asks to say something off-camera, Moore will tell his cameraman to turn it off, but will keep it running anyway.  Sipus probably would have fallen for this.  Or, if Flemming wasn't comfortable with this deception, he could have ignored the request until Sipus walked away.  Instead, I found myself sympathizing with the subject, as he got up to walk away from Flemming's incessant whining.On the positive side, the sections with the various commentators were excellent.  I have always found Robert Price and Sam Harris to be brilliant and insightful, and the other ones were good also.  I especially liked the one at the end who said that if he found himself in heaven, knowing that others were condemned eternally to hell, would be hell for him also.",2,Making up for childhood trauma,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,3102,"['should', 'preface', 'stating', 'do', 'not', 'practice', 'religion', 'see', 'religion', 'same', 'way', 'other', 'human', 'activity', 'inspired', 'great', 'music', 'literature', 'art', 'architecture', 'philosophy', 'same', 'time', 'responsible', 'untold', 'suffering', 'destruction', 'can', 'appreciate', 'music', 'Olivier', 'Messiaen', 'also', 'decry', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'facilitation', 'child', 'molestation.It', 'became', 'clear', 'end', 'film', 'Flemming', 'very', 'bitter', 'having', 'been', 'forced', 'attend', 'private', 'religious', 'school', 'way', 'dealing', 'agenda', 'led', 'make', 'several', 'choices', 'were', 'detrimental', 'film.Assuming', 'Jesus', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'lack', 'information', 'covering', 'period', 'assumed', 'date', 'death', 'writing', 'gospels', 'unwarranted', 'Paul', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'Jesus', 'life', 'letters', 'were', 'addressed', 'other', 'believers', 'who', 'would', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'information', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'need', 'repeat', 'Later', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'disseminated', 'more', 'people', 'gospels', 'were', 'written', 'Flemming', 'mistake', 'claiming', 'Mark', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'other', 'three', 'based', 'Current', 'scholarship', 'lost', 'Q', 'gospel', 'Mark', 'contributed', 'Matthew', 'Luke', 'John', 'clearly', 'source', 'entirely', 'Flemming', 'mistake', 'similar', 'made', 'New', 'Age', 'community', 'regard', 'gap', 'record', 'Jesus', 'life', 'age', '13', '30', 'where', 'claim', 'went', 'India', 'time', 'became', 'Buddhist', 'Gaps', 'record', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'meaningful', 'existence', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'indisputable', 'not', 'called', 'question', 'just', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'complete', 'record', 'life', 'more', 'fruitful', 'inquiry', 'would', 'be', 'accept', 'Jesus', 'lived', 'question', 'said', 'did', 'what', 'gospels', 'claim.Buttonholing', 'attendees', 'Pat', 'Robertson', 'rally', 'asking', 'questions', 'obscure', 'antecedents', 'Christianity', 'unfair', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'accept', 'Theory', 'Natural', 'Selection', 'could', 'explain', 'difference', 'Punctuated', 'Equilibrium', 'Phyletic', 'Gradualism', 'say', 'who', 'Lamarck', 'was', 'Flemming', 'was', 'clearly', 'going', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'moment', 'interview', 'Sipus', 'missed', 'great', 'opportunity', 'here', 'When', 'someone', 'Moore', 'interviewing', 'asks', 'say', 'something', 'off-camera', 'Moore', 'will', 'tell', 'cameraman', 'turn', 'off', 'will', 'keep', 'running', 'anyway', 'Sipus', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'Flemming', 'was', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'deception', 'could', 'have', 'ignored', 'request', 'Sipus', 'walked', 'away', 'Instead', 'found', 'sympathizing', 'subject', 'got', 'up', 'walk', 'away', 'Flemming', 'incessant', 'positive', 'side', 'sections', 'various', 'commentators', 'were', 'excellent', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'Robert', 'Price', 'Sam', 'Harris', 'be', 'brilliant', 'insightful', 'other', 'ones', 'were', 'good', 'also', 'especially', 'liked', 'one', 'end', 'who', 'said', 'found', 'heaven', 'knowing', 'others', 'were', 'condemned', 'eternally', 'hell', 'would', 'be', 'hell', 'also']",The God Who Wasn't There

955878,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B000CAPZBC,Theo,"[2, 2]","I harbor no illusions about changing anyone's opinion on Christianity. So I'm just going to talk about what I consider the strengths and weaknesses of this particular film. Hopefully I'm also going to help you decide whether or not you want to see this film, and whether you want to buy it.I myself did not buy it. I watched it for free on YouTube. And I do recommend that you do the same before making the decision to buy anything. What you do after you've seen it is of course up to you.So is this a film worth buying? Or even seeing?""The God Who Wasn't There"" is one man's critique of Christianity. It belongs to the category of polemical films essentially made by one individual with a camera. In this regard it's a lot like Morgan Surlock's famous indie documentarySuper Size Me. Unfortunately, many of this film's problems stem directly from the limitations inherent in that form. There are times where more depth, perspective, and sheer research are called for than this lone auteur seems able to provide.On the plus side, the film does do a good job of introducing the viewer to the issue of just how much the gospels share in common with far older stories. Stories that most of us would have no problem describing as ""myths"". If you are at all interested in Christianity, as either a believer or a non-believer, you really need to know this stuff. Feel free to explain the commonalities any way you want. But if you don't at least know about this issue, there are some major gaps in your religious education.But on the down side, the most basic flaw with this film is that it compares and contrasts its own ideas solely with those of Christian believers - both ""moderate"" and ""fundamentalist"". It acts as if these were the only other games in town. They're not. The film would have benefited enormously from a more objective overview of mainstream secular scholarship in the field of New Testament Biblical studies. The most serious problem here is that the filmmaker doesn't even seem to be aware of just how controversial many of his own claims would be among secular scholars. My own understanding is that the current consensus is that we can be reasonably certain that there was a real historical Jesus, and that he was crucified. Even if everything else is up for grabs, we can at least be sure of that much. Whether you agree with that consensus or not, the problem with this film is that its maker doesn't even seem to be aware of it. His own take on the story of Jesus is that it is a purely symbolic myth, and that any other viewpoint is based on nothing more than irrationality and ignorance.The film's characterization of ""moderate"" Christianity is also rather questionable, to say nothing of being internally inconsistent. The filmmaker himself (who is also the narrator) sarcastically sums up moderate Christianity by saying that ""Jesus was only sort of the son of God? He only somewhat rose from the dead? Your eternal soul is at stake but you shouldn't make a big deal of it?"" I find this rhetoric especially dubious given that in the closing minutes of this very film we hear directly from one man whom I think most would describe as a ""moderate"" Christian: Robert M Price.Price, a former fundamentalist Baptist and now a practicing Episcopalian, speaks openly of how he came to the view that the Bible ""just couldn't be realistically dealt with if you believe that it was an inspired book with no contradictions or errors"". He then goes on to say of his own current church that ""I love what is going on there and the symbolism and the liturgy precisely because I understand it is mythology.""  Regardless of what you might think of the truth of this world view, it is certainly a more legitimate representation of what ""moderate"" Christians tend to believe than the one the filmmaker himself gives. While few may go so far as to use the word ""mythology"", the key defining features of the moderates would seem to lie the in twin beliefs that their tradition is (to some degree at least) but one among many; and that while the Bible may contain something of the divine, it is not necessarily infallible from beginning to end.Even in the realm of the film's greatest strength - introducing the viewer to just how much of the gospel is identical to stories found in far older traditions - there's a great deal that the film doesn't tell us. The problem here is not so much that there's any one thing that was omitted that I believe should have been included. Rather, it's that the film includes very little at all beyond the level of vague generalities. This is a fairly short film, coming in at barely a full hour. So a great deal more detail and depth of analysis _could_ have been included without making the work overly long.For those interested in doing their own research in this area, in addition to the myths referenced in the film itself, I would also suggest you might start by reading up on just how much of the Madonna/Christ-Child iconography was copied wholesale from Egyptian images of Isis and Horus - right down to the level of the tradition of clothing the Madonna in blue. The life story and worldly following of Jesus could also stand to be compared with those of both Osiris and Mithras in rather greater detail and depth.Finally, I notice that some other reviewers have slammed this film for its final interview, in which the filmmaker confronts the superintendent of the fundamentalist school where he himself was educated. Rather unsurprisingly, the interview does not go well.As I see it, there are two issues here:First, the filmaker undeniably comes at his target ""hard"". He puts him on the spot and asks tough, confrontational questions. I personally have no problem with this.But second, the interview ends with the superintended first asking for the camera to be switched off so that he can ask his interviewer something off camera; then, when the interviewer refuses, the superintendant asserts that the filmmaker has been dishonest in the way he set up the interview, removes his microphone, and walks away.Was the filmmaker dishonest in the way he set up the interview? I honestly have no idea. That's because this is yet another thing the film doesn't tell us. It does come out on camera that the interview was set up with an email. We could have been shown that email so that we could judge for ourselves. But we weren't. Once again we were left in the dark.But hey, maybe if you buy the DVD the special features will help fill in some of the gaps.Or not.Theo.",3,The Flaws Are Mainly In What It Doesn't Say,1364688000,"03

955882,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B000CAPZBC,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[6, 11]","Introduction:I had read reviews of this film that claimed it was excellent. I was hoping for an objective presentation of facts about the historical plausibility of Jesus. I wanted to know both sides of the discussion, that of Secular scholars and that of Christian scholars.Sadly, this is not what was presented.The film does point out the time gaps between when Jesus was supposed to have lived and when the gospels were written, but the film maker does not cite his sources... and they are easy to find, even on the Internet! These gaps, and his reliance on the writings of Paul, lead to his assertion that most of what is told about Jesus must therefore have been invented. Unfortunately, this is not presented or refuted by any scholars. So it is just the film maker's opinion. This lacks a certain objectivity.And while the historical gaps leading to Jesus being ""invented"" could be true, without any evidence to back his claims, or a reason given as to why anyone would invent a ""god"", let alone one who has become so popular, the film maker falls short of what a documentary should do, that is: present facts and evidence.The Plot:Please note: The rest of this review contains spoilers.He spends some time comparing Jesus to acknowledged mythical god figures such as Osiris, Dionysus, Hercules and Mythras. He concludes that because there are parallels (some of which aren't very exact), that therefore, Jesus is also mythical. But circumstantial evidence and innuendo are not proof. For example:My dog looks like my neighbor's dog, same breed, same coloring, same age, same gender. So, if the neighbor's dog goes missing, can my neighbor say he has proof that I have his dog because of the above similar characteristics? Obviously more evidence is required to make the case.And so it is with the ""mythical"" Jesus argument as presented in this film when it is based so poorly on parallels with known mythical figures.While this stuff is all weak, and shows a lack of proper scholarship (even a few footnotes would have helped), the film gets worse.The filmmaker presents the life of Jesus as portrayed in some Hollywood movies. That's insulting to Christians and Atheists alike. Very disappointing. This is supposed to be a serious discussion, not a rehash of some of the cheesiest films about Jesus ever made (and some of the clips are laughable in their own right because the films are so bad.)The film also blatantly misquotes Jesus, and this is more than a faux pax. It is inexcusable in a documentary that is supposed to be arguing for truth and objectivity. The quote is from the gospel of Luke, Chapter 19. Anyone can look it up in any number of versions of the Bible (even on line) and see that the quote is taken completely out of context! If people argue that some Christians ""cherry pick"" the Bible, then it is a very weak counter-argument when you do the exactly same thing!We also get treated to a rather long series of unauthorized (not good for establishing scholarship when you pirate something) clips from the Mel Gibson movie, ""The Passion of the Christ"", which the film maker claims was a hugely successful movie because of its violence. I did not see the Mel Gibson movie because I don't like torture porn films - such as this was reported to be - and I had to skip this section of ""The God Who Wasn't There"" because such scenes are so disturbing to me. There was no reason to show the clips (he could have just referenced the movie and avoided copyright infringement) to make his point.But even his point was unsubstantiated. He claimed that the movie grossed more money than ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""The Temptation of Christ"" (both of which I DID see because they weren't gore fests), but did not take into account inflation, publicity, social and audience expectations, or film history. His point was that Christians gladly embrace violence because the Mel Gibson movie did so well at the box office. This assumes that the majority of the people who went to the movie were Christians, and that they went for the gore and violence. Without evidence to back up that assertion, it comes down to looking like using sensationalism to prove an argument.There is no question that the history of Christianity is riddled with violence of a terrible nature. We have historical evidence (such as the Spanish Inquisition and the burning of heretics - all documented events) but Christianity does not have an exclusive license to violence. Inhumanity of the most atrocious nature can be found in almost all cultures and religions. The question that would have been interesting to address is why humanity has such a proclivity for violence and more importantly, why Christianity doesn't take a much stronger stance against violence, rather than embrace it by recommending or attending slasher Jesus movies.Finally, the film suffers meltdown at the end when the film maker interviews the leader of a Christian School (which the film maker attended). I was hoping for an objective discussion. In parts we do get the leader's opinion and beliefs, but then the film maker argues with him and tries to make him look irresponsible, at which point, the man ends the interview because what was being filmed and what he was told would be filmed are two different things. I don't blame him for leaving, I did too! I skipped through to the end and sighed, ""What a waste of time and money.""I have seen the movie ""Religulous"" which makes the same mistake. In that movie, the film maker encounters people of faith, asks what they believe, and then proceeds to argue with them about what they believe - which gets them into trouble. ""The God Who Wasn't There"" does this as well, which is embarrassing to watch.I would much rather have seen the film maker interview people of faith, listen to their beliefs, then say ""Thank you"" and leave them alone. If their beliefs are absurd, there is no need to argue with them. The absurdity should be obvious. If they are profound, that too should be obvious. Let the audience decide, and at least give both sides of the story objectively.Conclusion:I was hoping of a scholarly, objective, rational and scientific approach to understanding the history of Jesus, why he may or may not have existed as an historical person. I knew this film would argue that he wasn't historical, and that would have been fine, if there were any objective, supportable arguments given. But they were not.Personally, I thought the film was disappointing and at times, embarrassing. It could have been so much better.",1,Very Disappointing and Embarrassing.,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,6542,"['Introduction', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'claimed', 'was', 'excellent', 'was',

955883,A240HREJROJG79,B000CAPZBC,"Uber Duck ""Life's Graven Image""","[6, 8]","If it were possible to give this DVD a 6 star rating, I would.This isn't a big Hollywood production. It's not an expensive network Documentary piece.Rather, it's a personal project created by a young man who use to be a Theist and then woke up! And is now an atheist. And in the process of arriving at his personal revelation, he decided to make a DVD documenting where he'd been, with an interview with his former Christian school Principle, who was also his former Pastor, so as to explain the journey to arriving at atheism.The Pastor in this piece is the best part. There he sits in his office, in the Christian school he runs, his desk and comfortable office chair situated before a wall of credentials. All framed so as to silently communicate in writing, this is a man who knows what he's talking about. And in that the guest to his chamber, sitting in a smaller less comfortable chair stationed before the Pastors desk, is intended to be intimidated, assured, confident that behind that Pastors head is framed proof on display that they can trust every word he says, as a emissary of his lord god.And in the course of the interview with Mr.Flemming, that Pastor admits, when asked if he believes the Jesus of the Bible did actually exist, that it is a matter of faith for all Christians that he did.A matter of faith! I.E. Christians hope he did exist. They believe he did exist.However, faith precludes fact. And there is no non-Biblical independent evidence that the Jesus described in the Bible, did in fact exist.Then Mr.Flemming continues in the interview with his former Pastor and building upon that aforementioned statement regarding faith Jesus did exist, the Pastor says, in order to be a Christian one has to set aside the intellect.POW! Truth! Spoken by a man who's pride mounts for all to see, his credentials so that on sight one is to take him at his word in all matters of faith and god, since he's so obviously a learned man.In other words, one has to dumb down, revoke critical, rational, thought in order to accept the myth of Christ and Christianity as true.No kidding!And yet true enough, that Pastor back peddles just as soon as Mr.Flemming repeats what the Pastor said about setting aside the intellect. He denies he said it.What cowardice. Especially when the interview was being recorded and Mr.Flemming offered to rewind the video and show him where the Pastor had spoken those words.After quite some time spent denying his words, proving himself not a man of his word, not mature enough to accept responsibility for his former statement, even going to the extent of accusing Mr.Flemming of ulterior motives in asking for the interview in the first place, which has no bearing whatsoever on the Pastors former statement about having to set aside the intellect in order to be a Christian, the Pastor ends up walking out of his own office, in outrage!Priceless!I use to attend a Christian school. For 2 years, I witnessed hypocrisy, egoism, elitism and physical violence. All exhibited in the name of insuring one faith's supremacy in the mind and heart of impressionable young minds.It's like any other MONO-Theistic faith. IF there is only one god, then there can be no other god's before or after or in competition with it. If there is only one, then no other faith, no other rituals, no other sect of believers be they afforded any name as such, can worship anything other than that one.So that all the fighting, all the elitist proclamations by Fundamentalist, Evangelical and now what's worse than them, Dominionists (Aka/New Apostolic Reformationists) is simply a war of words. A conflict for supremacy of Semantics!And to think of all the lives lost, the bloody slaughter, the loss of cultural histories, languages, writings, etc... due to that battle to have ""The One"" referred to by only one religious ideology; Christianity. That in and of itself, is not and never has been a religion of peace, for all the infighting that occurs among Christians in the name of sectarianism. One god, one way to see god, one way to worship god, or else!This video is an awesome revelation. It's produced by a young man who sought the truth for himself. Found it, and then thought to make a video offering an opportunity to review the Christian faith and it's god, and decide for ones self, as the viewer, if any of Christianity (Or Theism in general) makes sense.With regard to Christianity, no! It does not. In a nutshell, Christianity declares the individual was declared guilty of sin before they were born. And once alive they were forever in deficit and deemed imperfect by their creator. Always guilty, they have to struggle to be redeemed, forgiven, for being made as the infinite omnipotent creator of all that is, made them to be before they were conceived.(NIV)Psalm 51:5) Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.So that salvation is simply a journey to find god, in his demi-god form of Jesus, so as to ask him to save us from the damnable sinners he made us to be. Salvation is asking to be saved from god. Because left unredeemed, unsaved, one dies as a sinner and thus suffers the Hell of his creation. Where he deems the damned sinners to suffer for all eternity.If god couldn't forgive the first of our kind, Adam and Eve, for their first mistake as newborns in his created Paradise, having eaten of ""forbidden"" fruit that god planted there in the first place, how can he generations later, and after having drowned the whole world, save for one family, for being sinners, send himself to rearrange the rules of damnation that he wrote himself?If god is god, why did he create humans imperfect and then curse them for his mistake?I agree with that spineless Pastor who couldn't even admit to his own words, much less then be deemed fit to lead anyone to be better people from the pulpit; one has to set aside the intellect, in order to be a Christian.This DVD is a must have for any atheist. And it's an opportunity to awaken from selective ignorance, for any Christian.Look at the world as it stands now. Nearly 7 billion individuals inhabit it, the majority of which are Christian. War, poverty, famine, pandemic AIDS, suffering, etc...All those people who believe in god, pray for salvation, pray for grace, pray to be saved from their present mortal plight.Does it appear anything is listening? And if it were, does it appear as if it cares?NO!There's an answer for why.People are begging to be saved by the God who ISN'T there!Save yourself.Stop believing in poorly written fictions that can't even save you from dumbing down in order to hope it's true in the end.

Perhaps it was a gradual process, but he doesn't let us in on that either.At one hour for running time, the film barely skims the surface of a very complicated subject and is hardly objective.  Evidence of this is seen at the beginning, when Flemming inclues images of maniacs like Charles Manson as ""examples"" of Christians.  Come on---that's just intellectually dishonest.The ending also loses a lot of the shock value it might have had because it is so quick and contrived.There just isn't much to chew on here.
