My daughter-in-law and I discuss each episode and also try to figure out the up coming episodes! It is about as true to life as entertainment can allow! I think it is one of the best shows on TV today.  They had talked of canceling the show but apparently the ""fans"" of the show wouldn't hold still for that! One finds themselves feeling like a member of the family in this show. You laugh, cry, worry, do all the things with them that any military family does. If anyone wants to have a glimpse of military life, this is a great way to experience it for yourself!  Thanks to my son and his wife, I now own every season of ""Army Wives""!  It was my Christmas present amd I couldn't have wished for anything better! I don't know what else to say about ""Army Wives"" but that, to me, it is the best show out there at this time.It shows life on the Army base called Ft. Marshall! There are 5 families, each with the military person a different rank from general down to Sgt. There is even a female LT.Col. The whole series is mainly about the close friendships one forms while going through the different experiences that military families go through  during tours of duty at different posts!
