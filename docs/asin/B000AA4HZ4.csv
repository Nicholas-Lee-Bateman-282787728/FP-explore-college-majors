Miller ""Cmiller""","[2, 5]","This dvd is about 50 total mins, with the breakdown of: introduction- 4 mins, core work- 19 mins, leg work-9 mins, full body work- 12 mins, cooldown-6 mins.  Poor production quality, irritating instructor, and I wasn't loving the flow of exercises. I felt like there was an annoying amount of deep breathing exercises in the beginning and then most of the other exercises required either a lot of flexibility, or were just hard. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking to get their feet wet with pilates.",2,Not for beginners,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,509,"['dvd', '50', 'total', 'mins', 'breakdown', 'introduction-', '4', 'mins', 'core', 'work-', '19', 'mins', 'leg', 'work-9', 'mins', 'full', 'body', 'work-', '12', 'mins', 'cooldown-6', 'mins', 'Poor', 'production', 'quality', 'irritating', 'instructor', 'was', ""n't"", 'loving', 'flow', 'exercises', 'felt', 'was', 'annoying', 'amount', 'deep', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'beginning', 'then', 'most', 'other', 'exercises', 'required', 'either', 'lot', 'flexibility', 'were', 'just', 'hard', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'get', 'feet', 'pilates']",Janis Saffell Beverly Hills Pilates
924704,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B000AA4HZ4,CPTScott,"[12, 13]","I had found out about Janis Saffell because I picked up her Beverly Hills Yoga DVD (see my review of that on my amazon page). I've had a daily Yoga practice for the past 9 years and the main part of my home practice is driven by DVD/VHS programs so I'm always looking for more variety.Since I was extremely pleased with her Yoga DVD and I figured I'd give this Pilates disc a try.Once again Janis came through!This is a very well done routine, all the poses start from a simple foundation and then build to harder variations. She does a beautiful job demonstrating the movements and is very pleasent to listen to (I have a difficult time with instructors who are too much like ""Rah Rah"" Aerobics teachers).While this is not ""Classic Pilates"", Janis's unique approach to the system is really interesting! In fact I think this creative approach is a really wonderful addition and complement to the more traditional Pilates programs out there. I also found that this DVD worked my body in a way that is a different but definitely complimentary practice to Yoga. I was certainly challenged!In fact, I took the suggestion of someone who has been doing both Yoga and Pilates and followed the Pilates practice with some Yoga and that was perfection!Though that is a personal preference I'm sure that many folks would enjoy this DVD as a practice in and of itself.The routine, minus the introduction, take about 40 minutes from start to finish so it's long enough without being overwhelming.Highly recommended!Namaste",5,"Janis Saffell, Good To The Core!",1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,1509,"['had', 'found', 'out', 'Janis', 'Saffell', 'picked', 'up', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'see', 'review', 'amazon', 'page', ""'ve"", 'had', 'daily', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'past', '9', 'years', 'main', 'part', 'home', 'practice', 'driven', 'DVD/VHS', 'programs', 'so', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'more', 'variety.Since', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'Pilates', 'try.Once', 'again', 'Janis', 'came', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'routine', 'poses', 'start', 'simple', 'foundation', 'then', 'build', 'harder', 'variations', 'beautiful', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'movements', 'very', 'pleasent', 'listen', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'instructors', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'Rah', 'Rah', 'Aerobics', 'teachers', 'not', 'Classic', 'Pilates', 'Janis', 'unique', 'approach', 'system', 'really', 'interesting', 'fact', 'think', 'creative', 'approach', 'really', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'complement', 'more', 'traditional', 'Pilates', 'programs', 'out', 'there', 'also', 'found', 'DVD', 'worked', 'body', 'way', 'different', 'definitely', 'complimentary', 'practice', 'Yoga', 'was', 'certainly', 'challenged', 'fact', 'took', 'suggestion', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'followed', 'Pilates', 'practice', 'Yoga', 'was', 'perfection', 'personal', 'preference', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'folks', 'would', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'practice', 'itself.The', 'routine', 'introduction', 'take', '40', 'minutes', 'start', 'finish', 'long', 'enough', 'being', 'overwhelming.Highly', 'recommended', 'Namaste']",Janis Saffell Beverly Hills Pilates
924705,A3QJVN9IXSNO9F,B000AA4HZ4,M. Black,"[5, 5]","If you read any of my other reviews, you will quickly find I'm a big Janis Saffell fan.  I was somewhat skeptical that she could transition to doing as good a pilates wokout as her other strength/kickboxing videos.  I was pleasantly surprised by this video, she cues well just like her other videos and presents pilates in a very nice manner, increasing the difficulty of each move with modifications.  Most of the exercises are traditional with a few ""hybrids"" thrown in.  Her manner is nice and relaxed with complimentary music.  This is just a really good, nicely produced workout which I highly recommend adding to your rotation whether beginner or intermediate!

924706,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000AA4HZ4,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]","Don't let the calming music at the start of this workout fool you into thinking this will be a relaxing workout. The intensity increases throughout and there are many balance challenges. Janis Saffell does a unique roll up with legs crossed - something I've never seen in any other Pilates workout. She then takes you through a Double Leg Stretch which requires a good deal of core strength.The Roll Over is for the adventurous and Bridge with leg extensions again tests your full body strength. Single Leg Stretch, Scissors and Criss-Cross follow. The exercise on all fours with a leg and arm extension tests your balance and core strength.The garden setting is colorful with pink gardenias and vines climbing a wall. Janis Saffell works out on a turquoise mat and shows you how to obtain better posture and long lean muscles. While this workout claims to workout your entire body it mainly focuses on the core muscles and the legs. Plank does workout the upper body but upper body strength is not really the focus of this workout.~The Rebecca Review",5,Intermediate Challenge,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,1051,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'calming', 'music', 'start', 'workout', 'fool', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'relaxing', 'workout', 'intensity', 'are', 'many', 'balance', 'challenges', 'Janis', 'Saffell', 'unique', 'roll', 'up', 'legs', 'crossed', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'Pilates', 'then', 'Double', 'Leg', 'Stretch', 'good', 'deal', 'core', 'strength.The', 'Roll', 'Over', 'adventurous', 'Bridge', 'leg', 'extensions', 'again', 'tests', 'full', 'body', 'strength', 'Single', 'Leg', 'Stretch', 'Scissors', 'Criss-Cross', 'follow', 'exercise', 'fours', 'leg', 'arm', 'extension', 'tests', 'balance', 'core', 'strength.The', 'garden', 'setting', 'colorful', 'pink', 'gardenias', 'vines', 'climbing', 'wall', 'Janis', 'Saffell', 'out', 'turquoise', 'mat', 'how', 'obtain', 'better', 'posture', 'long', 'lean', 'muscles', 'workout', 'workout', 'entire', 'body', 'mainly', 'core', 'muscles', 'legs', 'Plank', 'upper', 'body', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'not', 'really', 'focus', 'workout.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Janis Saffell Beverly Hills Pilates
924707,AM2M5QEBL0WIB,B000AA4HZ4,"Shoppaholic ""buddy_boy""","[1, 1]","With a title of Beverly Hill Pilates, I wasn't expecting the outdoor scenary and also very nice soft background ballet type music and that was a pleasant surprise, very nice scenary and calming music.  I have only tried one other Janis workout in the past and did not connect with her as an instructor.  I am glad I gave this DVD a try because I think she is a fantastic Pilates instructor with great form and tips.  I like the way she talks you into the move so you can get the proper alignment and get the breathing in place as you extend into more advanced levels of the exercise.  I enjoyed the flow and elongating style of this workout and felt really good after the workout.  The slower pace did allow me to really get into the muscles well and can be used to build your strength as you practice the moves.  You will work and it is a nice challenge.  I was actually hoping there would be a 15 or 20 min consolidated faster moving segment at the end or as an add-on bonus segment but there isn't one.In the beginning, it does seem a bit slow and I found myself a bit antsy the first 10 mins in but I now use this time to focus on the mind, body and breathing connection.  I will keep this workout in my collection as it is different than your traditional pilates workouts but doesn't stray too much into too much like some Pilates workouts that really are too fusioned with other disciplines for my tastes.  I can see myself reaching for this as an evening workout when I am tired but still want to do something.I will also plan to use the beginning of this workout to help destress, stretch and unwind.  This would also be good to use to kick off an active rest day.Minus one star for the amateur video editing that in my opinion detracted from the overall quality of the DVD.",4,Nice workout to add to your Pilates collection for variety,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1782,"['title', 'Beverly', 'Hill', 'Pilates', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'outdoor', 'scenary', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'soft', 'background', 'ballet', 'type', 'music', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'very', 'nice', 'scenary', 'calming', 'music', 'have', 'only', 'tried', 'one', 'other', 'Janis', 'workout', 'past', 'did', 'not', 'connect', 'instructor', 'am', 'glad', 'gave', 'DVD', 'try', 'think', 'fantastic', 'Pilates', 'instructor', 'great', 'form', 'tips', 'way', 'move', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'proper', 'alignment', 'get', 'breathing', 'place', 'extend', 'more', 'advanced', 'levels', 'exercise', 'enjoyed', 'flow', 'elongating', 'style', 'workout', 'felt', 'really', 'good', 'workout', 'slower', 'pace', 'did', 'allow', 'really', 'get', 'muscles', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'build', 'strength', 'practice', 'moves', 'will', 'work', 'nice', 'challenge', 'was', 'actually', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', '15', '20', 'min', 'consolidated', 'faster', 'moving', 'segment', 'end', 'add-on', 'bonus', 'segment', ""n't"", 'one.In', 'beginning', 'seem', 'bit', 'slow', 'found', 'bit', 'first', '10', 'mins', 'now', 'use', 'time', 'focus', 'mind', 'body', 'breathing', 'connection', 'will', 'keep', 'workout', 'collection', 'different', 'traditional', 'pilates', 'workouts', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'really', 'are', 'too', 'fusioned', 'other', 'disciplines', 'tastes', 'can', 'see', 'reaching', 'evening', 'workout', 'when', 'am', 'tired', 'still', 'want', 'do', 'something.I', 'will', 'also', 'plan', 'use', 'beginning', 'workout', 'help', 'destress', 'stretch', 'unwind', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'use', 'kick', 'off', 'active', 'rest', 'day.Minus', 'one', 'star', 'amateur', 'video', 'editing', 'opinion', 'detracted', 'overall', 'quality', 'DVD']",Janis Saffell Beverly Hills Pilates
