1608402,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00AF6B22E,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[0, 1]","Let's face it; this film has very little to do with being a pilot, flying, a plane crash, etc. It's mostly about a drunk and coke head who befriends a heroin addict.This film has been done many times before of course, even the drunk pilot concept with Cliff Robertson in &#34;The Pilot&#34;. The script writer was able to cram enough elements into this film to have something for everyone...that is except for those of us interested in well done original film-making. It's got a plane crash, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, John Goodman as a coke dealer, a cancer victim, a heroine addict/hooker, a father-son thing, an all-star cast.But the worst aspect of this aside from its trying to squeeze money out of a weak script by over-blowing it, is the unbelievability of the scenario. This is extremely unlikely to occur in a US commercial flight: a drunk coked-up pilot mixed with a catastrophic failure of the aircraft all at once. My final comment is that the actor playing the copilot's wife gave the the most ridiculous performance I've seen in a long time.On one level though they came in for a perfect landing. The destination was the twin airports of BBD (big bucks made by dumbing it down) and ILD (injecting a lethal dose of Stupid into film junkies). They had a slight diversion to the city of BSC (big stars act like cartoon characters), but after connecting through the airport of OHC (overhype and crass), came in smoothly and landed on the tarmac of OPA (overpaid actors) and the final destination of OCM (overcharged moviegoers).I recommend instead 1964's &#34;Fate is the Hunter&#34; starring Glenn Ford and Rod Taylor or my favorite flight film: &#34;Flight of the Phoenix&#34; (1965) with Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborough, and Hardy Kruger.",1,Perfect Landing!,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,1753,"['Let', 'face', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'being', 'pilot', 'flying', 'plane', 'crash', 'etc', 'mostly', 'drunk', 'coke', 'head', 'who', 'heroin', 'addict.This', 'film', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'course', 'even', 'drunk', 'pilot', 'concept', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', '34', 'Pilot', '34', 'script', 'writer', 'was', 'able', 'cram', 'enough', 'elements', 'film', 'have', 'something', 'everyone', 'interested', 'well', 'done', 'original', 'film-making', 'got', 'plane', 'crash', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'John', 'Goodman', 'coke', 'dealer', 'cancer', 'victim', 'heroine', 'addict/hooker', 'father-son', 'thing', 'all-star', 'cast.But', 'worst', 'aspect', 'aside', 'trying', 'squeeze', 'money', 'weak', 'script', 'over-blowing', 'unbelievability', 'scenario', 'extremely', 'unlikely', 'occur', 'US', 'commercial', 'flight', 'drunk', 'coked-up', 'pilot', 'mixed', 'catastrophic', 'failure', 'aircraft', 'once', 'My', 'final', 'comment', 'actor', 'playing', 'copilot', 'wife', 'gave', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.On', 'one', 'level', 'came', 'perfect', 'landing', 'destination', 'was', 'twin', 'airports', 'BBD', 'big', 'bucks', 'made', 'dumbing', 'down', 'ILD', 'injecting', 'lethal', 'dose', 'Stupid', 'film', 'junkies', 'had', 'slight', 'diversion', 'city', 'BSC', 'big', 'stars', 'act', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'connecting', 'airport', 'OHC', 'overhype', 'crass', 'came', 'smoothly', 'landed', 'tarmac', 'OPA', 'overpaid', 'actors', 'final', 'destination', 'OCM', 'overcharged', 'moviegoers', '.I', 'recommend', 'instead', '1964', '34', 'Fate', 'Hunter', '34', 'starring', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'favorite', 'flight', 'film', '34', 'Flight', 'Phoenix', '34', '1965', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'Hardy', 'Kruger']",Flight Combo

Denzel Washington portrays airline pilot Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic and drug user, who saves many lives aboard his flight when a technical mishap occurs. He's hailed a hero, but it comes up that there was alcohol in his blood after the crash. Now, Whip is trying his best to avoid jail time when an investigation into the crash is conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

So routinely drunk on a rainy morning he manages the impossible that is to save the life of many people.  Robert Zemeckis has made films in the past which have ordinary folks in extraordinary events and this film is no exception.Denzel Washington is simply superb as Whip right from the start to the end and delivers one of his more memorable performances in recent years. Robert Zemeckis also makes a return to live action fter years of animation and displays why he is one of the best in the business.The crash scene is very scary and well directed and makes you wonder about the sobriety about pilots ( not that they all drink before flying). I would not recommend watching this film just before you are going to catch a flight.The story is not about a functional alcoholic hero but his journey afterwards as federal investigations reveal that Whip was drunk and that caused the crash and Whips  insistence that the plane was faulty. This clash of facts and opinion make the film watchable.The film is about an addicts insistence that they are not having a problem with drinking. Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a woman on a downward spiral through addiction who meets Whip in the hospital is great and so is John Goodman as Whips drug dealer- I felt that his role should have been more developed. Don Cheadle is good as the lawyer.Denzel Washington is the heart of the movie from the beginning to the end. Almost 60 he looks great and gives us one of his best performances in recent times.

It caused a type of mental ""claustrophobia"" wherein this segment of the pilot's life was like looking through a keyhole, instead of through a window; it was not a broad enough storyline to place in some sort of context. Whether or not that was the intent of identifying the process of addiction or not, it made for a grim movie start to finish.

It isn't awful, but it becomes rather pointless by film's end because it never manages to become anything more than an elaborate exaggeration.`Flight' attempts to be a moral tale revolving around an alcoholic pilot named Whip who uses cocaine to sober up after binge drinking before a flight.  When the plane has problems and starts to descend rapidly, Whip winds up landing the plane in a rather remarkable manner and saves the lives of many on board (only losing a few).  He was a hero, until his toxicology report shows that he was drunk and high at the time of the flight.  Over the course of the next two hours, Zemeckis beats us over the head with Whip's addiction to the point where I just wanted him to get hit by a drunk driver and let the irony completely take over.I'm not trying to belittle addiction, because it is truly something serious, but the manipulative nature of `Flight' is too much.  Washington is in fine form, but this is a breeze for him.  He's played a similar character before and he doesn't really shade Whip with anything other than the obvious.  The introduction of Nicole was unnecessary and yet again completely part of Zemeckis's approach.  There is no subtlety here.

Reviews will tell you &#34;Flight&#34; starring Denzel Washington, is a &#34;riveting and powerful thriller.&#34; It is not. There is about five minutes of interesting Airmanship in the first fifteen minutes of the movie. After that it is a boring crapfest about alcoholism. It's two hours and eighteen minutes of nothing. Garbage. Don't even watch it if its free. It won't be worth the time of you burned to watch it. You can better spend that two-plus hours of your life watching a cat sleep, or some paint dry, or a corner do nothing. Light yourself on fire maybe. Any of these choices would be better use of your time than watching this movie. The cat sleeping is probably the best one. I would sue someone but I didn't pay to see this cinematic refuse, except with my life, two hours of it. I don't think I can get that back, even if I won the lawsuit. That would be great if I could get it back. Maybe I'd watch &#34;Last of the Mohicans&#34; again. The excellence of that movie could erase the memory of the horribly depressing and suicide-inducingly boring travesty that was &#34;Flight&#34;. Look, I've only seen one movie that sucked more than this. It was &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34; which starred Daniel Day-Lewis who was, ironically, also the lead in &#34;Last of the Mohicans.&#34; &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34; was so terrible I had nightmares. Not about any of the things that happened in it, just that I was still watching the movie. I hope when I go to sleep tonight I don't see Denzel  Washington.

For some reason that was an impression I got from earlier previews. However, that is really not what the story was about. The movie reminded me of something that might have been made int he 70's. Dark, with nudity for no reason, and a lot of drugs ad alcohol. The very beginning of the movie has a full on nudity scene (female, of course), that was just totally unnecessary to the story. You can give us the idea that this couple is having an affair without having to do that. Then after the crash, the movie is just basically about an addict who can't and doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions. The movie dragged in parts, and much of the scenes look like they can be cut out to shorten the movie for regular TV and you won't miss a thing.

I was hoping for some spectacular ending which could make all that other stuff worth it, but I admit, it fizzled as well. I can not recommend this movie.

1608570,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B00AF6B22E,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[1, 1]","Denzel Washington and Robert Zemeckis team up to make a movie that is way out of the common mold for both. Neither have worked together previously. It's a raw and edgy role for Denzel, but I thought it was a terrific film for all kinds of reasons; and I highly recommend seeing Flight without reviews or spoilers (such as follow this paragraph) for maximum impact. Just the fact that Denzel is in it should be enough.Washington plays Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic, commercial airline pilot, whose plane crashes for ambiguous reasons. Though he miraculously crash lands the plane in a Georgia field, saving many lives and emerging a hero, his troubles slowly begin to mount. Airline pilots are among the most respected professions in our society, but when Washington as an icon of the public trust comes under suspicion of having piloted a flight under the influence of a drink, his life slowly falls apart.Any number of A-list actors could have turned down a role such as this, which probes the fundamental weaknesses of a man under the influence of an addiction. But Denzel picks up the mantle of a character full of contradictions, and delivers a fully-fleshed, depressing yet fascinating story of a man in crisis.There is also a parallel story of a heroin-addicted woman, played by Kelly Reilly, who manages to pull herself out of a death spiral, while also watching Captain Whitaker go down the tubes.Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood play Whitaker's supporters from the Airline Pilots Union, who will stand by their man to the last straw, but their efforts are sorely tested by Whitaker's alcoholism. But if Cheadle and Greenwood are the angels on Whitaker's right shoulder, Harling Mays as Whitaker's coke dealer (John Goodman) is perched on Whitaker's other shoulder, ready to lead him into a paradise of vice, injecting massive doses of humor into the film's most tense moments.The film seems a bit long, but as the story drove on to its last third, I was totally absorbed in what was going to happen next. Will Whitaker fly to Jamaica and escape his legal troubles? Will the airline be found negligent because pilots are forced to fly stressful schedules?Denzel's willingness to take on roles that probe the inner crisis of a middle-aged man demonstrate great flexibility and a prolonged career path for Washington. Whitaker's aircraft and his life may be falling apart, but Flight holds together marvelously.",4,Denzel and Zemeckis team in a raw and edgy story of a professional man in trouble,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,2414,"['Denzel', 'Washington', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'team', 'up', 'make', 'movie', 'way', 'common', 'mold', 'have', 'worked', 'together', 'previously', 'raw', 'edgy', 'role', 'Denzel', 'thought', 'was', 'terrific', 'film', 'kinds', 'reasons', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Flight', 'reviews', 'spoilers', 'such', 'follow', 'paragraph', 'maximum', 'impact', 'Just', 'fact', 'Denzel', 'should', 'be', 'enough.Washington', 'plays', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'alcoholic', 'commercial', 'airline', 'pilot', 'plane', 'crashes', 'ambiguous', 'reasons', 'miraculously', 'plane', 'Georgia', 'field', 'saving', 'many', 'lives', 'emerging', 'hero', 'troubles', 'slowly', 'begin', 'mount', 'Airline', 'pilots', 'are', 'most', 'respected', 'professions', 'society', 'when', 'Washington', 'icon', 'public', 'trust', 'suspicion', 'having', 'piloted', 'flight', 'influence', 'drink', 'life', 'slowly', 'apart.Any', 'number', 'A-list', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'such', 'fundamental', 'weaknesses', 'man', 'influence', 'addiction', 'Denzel', 'up', 'mantle', 'character', 'full', 'contradictions', 'fully-fleshed', 'depressing', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'story', 'man', 'crisis.There', 'also', 'parallel', 'story', 'heroin-addicted', 'woman', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'who', 'pull', 'death', 'spiral', 'also', 'watching', 'Captain', 'Whitaker', 'go', 'down', 'tubes.Don', 'Cheadle', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'play', 'Whitaker', 'supporters', 'Airline', 'Pilots', 'Union', 'who', 'will', 'stand', 'man', 'last', 'straw', 'efforts', 'are', 'sorely', 'tested', 'Whitaker', 'alcoholism', 'Cheadle', 'Greenwood', 'are', 'angels', 'Whitaker', 'right', 'shoulder', 'Harling', 'Mays', 'Whitaker', 'coke', 'dealer', 'John', 'Goodman', 'perched', 'Whitaker', 'other', 'shoulder', 'ready', 'lead', 'paradise', 'vice', 'injecting', 'massive', 'doses', 'humor', 'film', 'most', 'tense', 'moments.The', 'film', 'bit', 'long', 'story', 'drove', 'last', 'third', 'was', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Will', 'Whitaker', 'fly', 'Jamaica', 'escape', 'legal', 'troubles', 'Will', 'airline', 'be', 'found', 'negligent', 'pilots', 'are', 'forced', 'fly', 'stressful', 'schedules', 'Denzel', 'willingness', 'take', 'roles', 'probe', 'inner', 'crisis', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'demonstrate', 'great', 'flexibility', 'prolonged', 'career', 'path', 'Washington', 'Whitaker', 'aircraft', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'falling', 'apart', 'Flight', 'together', 'marvelously']",Flight Combo

The dialog is very believable, and funny, throughout appropriate parts of ""Flight.""  There is a scene in a stairwell at a hospital -- after the crash -- that involves Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilley, and some guy (I don't know his name) who has cancer.  Now, the cancer part surely isn't funny, but the cancer patient's dialog is hilarious.  As a matter of fact, I was cackling for the majority of the film.Personally, I feel that this is Mr. Washington's finest performance to date.  He is a very flawed protagonist in this film, but he's simultaneously also very sympathetic.  I would imagine that this is a tricky role to pull off as an actor, as you most likely walk a very fine line trying to pull this off.  But he is excellent.  Throughout, I was really pulling for his character, and I believe that he and the director did a great job in this respect.Even Don Cheadle is really good.  I've been a little hit and miss with him, as I feel that many times, his characters come off as a little preachy to me.  It's not necessarily him per se; it's strictly the roles that he has chosen in his career.  Now, he's a little straight-laced once again in this role, but there is a comic scene in the third act (let's just say that Nancy Reagan would be rolling her eyes) where Mr. Cheadle lightens up a bit, and I had a really good laugh.But naturally, this is supposed to be a somewhat serious film as well dealing with serious subjects.  The film doesn't get too preachy; it allows the viewer to make up his or her own mind on some of these issues.  That is a big plus.

His performance is flawless as an airline pilot who is unparalled in ability but also has hopeless addiction problems.  The first thirty minutes of the film itself are edge of your seat viewing as his plane loses all hydraulics and he has to try and land it.  He turns it upside down to stop the downward plummet which is really great. His copilot is a study in contrast as he is stone cold sober but also barely competent as a pilot, worthless in a crisis and not particularly courageous in trying  to save the flight.This presents some very interesting questions for the viewer and I wish the film had spent more time focusing on them instead of the legal investigation which followed.  We've all seen that done before.  What we haven't questioned before is would you rather have a pilot who can outfly anyone, drunk or sober, be your pilot in a crashing plane or would you rather have a sober but incompetent, paniced, cowardly one instead?  This question resonates clear across the board in every profession and occupation out there from surgeons to lawyers to artists and musicians and everyone else.  In most cases, the staid one does not do the brilliant work.Washington does an indelible portrait of a professional trapped in substance abuse.

1608632,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B00AF6B22E,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","Akin to cancer, there are no rules when it comes to alcoholism. Victims come from every background. By the time the epiphany takes place -- ""I am an alcoholic,"" -- there's usually a huge wake of subtle destruction in the rear view mirror. What happens in ""Flight,"" director Robert Zemeckis' harrowing 2012 film, is anything but subtle. Denzel Washington plays airline pilot ""Whip"" Whitaker, a likable veteran who arrives at the airport after a night of booze and cocaine. He wears sunglasses and stumbles as he boards the jet airliner with more than 100 souls. He requests black coffee and Advil and his young co-pilot (Brian Geraghty) gives him a troubled stare. Maybe he has the flu.It's not a spoiler when I say the airplane's going to crash, as the scenes are heavily emphasized in the trailer. After contemplation, I realized multiple incidents taking place before the crash are open to interpretation. Whip decides to fly through a violent thunderstorm much to his co-pilot's consternation. Certainly not the product of sober thinking, was such reckless behavior a contributing factor to what eventually happens? There's a loud metallic bang, and suddenly the airliner is nose-diving for the ground.Everything that happens during the beginning of ""Flight"" is plausible. We are familiar with Sully Sullenberger's miraculous landing of his crippled airliner on the Hudson River. There's also the 2000 tragedy of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, suffering an identical malfunction as the plane of this film. What pilots attempted in an effort to halt a dive is exactly what Whip achieves. It's an incredibly unorthodox maneuver which could only have been accomplished because he was under the influence. Okay, that's as far as I'm going on the crash, suffice to say it's one of the most extraordinary scenes ever devised.Zemickis has forged a unique r&eacute;sum&eacute;  over the years marked by experimentation and respectable gloss. He gave us the hilarious cult classicUsed Cars (1980), followed closely byBack to the Future Trilogy [Blu-ray]. His high mark was the American fableForrest Gump, which won him the Academy Award. He gave us another fable with the wonderfulCast Away. ""Flight,"" his most serious film, is arguably his least commercial. It too is a fable, replete with demonic tapping and the haunting siren call of a refrigerator possessing glistening bottles of vodka.Saying Washington gives a great performance is redundant, as he never gives a bad performance. His undeniable gifts are coolly reminiscent of Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, or more recently Jack Nicholson. Whip Whitaker is one of the greatest roles of his career. He's chunky, in need of a shave and on the verge of a breakdown. He repeatedly awakens with a hangover, quickly striding to the kitchen to pour the remaining liquor down the drain. The hangover wears off, and his coffee table is soon covered with beer bottles. He begins a tentative relationship with Nicole (Kelly Reilly), a recovered heroin addict. She tries to help him attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. In the immortal reaction of all alcoholics, he uncomfortably sits in the back and leaves early.""Flight"" is a brave film dealing with a serious subject, though one wonders if the airliner crash was the hook allowing it to be financed. I admit I enjoyed details involving the investigation, including the political machinations of a lawyer (Don Cheadle) and union rep (Bruce Greenwood) as they attempt to hide Whip's failed toxicology report. Slowly, Whip achieves his epiphany, though in a forum so public I found it unconvincing. Call me cynical, but I don't believe Washington's character would announce his sickness in such a manner. Epiphanies take place in a jail cell, or hard Sunday mornings on the bathroom floor.In spite of its symbolism, not to mention comedic forays with John Goodman as drug dealer Harlan Mays (who knows, maybe the devil does wear a Hawaiian shirt), ""Flight"" has moments of overwhelming truth. I knew a friend who turned his life around after viewingClean and Sober, the brilliant and underrated 1988 film starring Michael Keaton.

Airline CEO's fire drunk pilots faster than a jet at VR.  3. If anyone suspects a pilot (or any crew member ) of drinking during the 8 hour ""bottle to throttle"" rule, EVERY time they land, (or even prior to take off)  they'll either pee in the cup or blow in the tube. 4. Once you are under an NTSB investigation you are literally locked away until they finish their questions.  5. The FAA in a situation like this is your WORST enemy and where were they in this movie? 6. If this guy is a drunk pilot who killed people, it's Federal..so the FBI gets involved, too.  7.

Washington has been nominated many times and he has won twice.  It goes without saying that he is one of the best actors working today.I am of the opinion that characters who seem to have it all, a successful career, charisma, looks, etc. who succomb to drugs and alcoholism, are particularly impressive to the public and the academy.  A long time ago, I watched the movie ""The Days of Wine and Roses"" and Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick received accolades for playing a couple destroyed by alcohol.The scene is set in ""Flight"" in the very first scene when Washington is shown, doing cocaine and alcohol with a stewardess, she is later killed in the movie, before he has to go on a fairly routine flight from Florida to Georgia.  At first, Washington is hailed as a hero for landing a plane that was flawed and it is mentioned that no other pilot could have done this.  However, when an investigation indicates that he had drugs and alcohol in his system while flying the aircraft, the end result is that he ends up in jail for at least five years.  He actually admitted to the fact that he had coke and alcohol in his system at the time.I thought that Tamara Tunie was good as a surviving stewardess, and I wish that Garcelle Beauvais had been in the film for more than one scene.  Don Cheadle is a great actor but I think that he was miscast as the attorney for Washington character.  The greatest supporting character was John Goodman who was the supplier for Washington and who actually saved his life.  Goodman was hilarious. I am not familiar with the man who played the co-pilot but he did well as the moral conscious of the movie who knew that Washington was drunk during the flight and the co-pilot is now going to ruined for life and blames Washington (not the fact that the plane was flawed).Many stories are written about people who's downfall is within themselves.  It is known as hubris and most of us are existing with it.  This portrayal is one of the better ones in recent years and is truly brought to light by a great actor,  Denzel Washington. However, I do believe that like a lot of great actors, Washington is playing himself more in movies than playing the character.  John Wayne and many others became so comfortable playing themselves that they are hardly to be considered acting anymore. Unfortunately, Denzel is falling into that category as well but if you like him as an actor, you will certainly enjoy this film. It is well written but not suspenseful because you can pretty much tell what the end result will be.",4,Another best actor nomination for Denzel Washington,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,2649,"['Anytime', 'can', 'consistently', 'be', 'nominated', 'academy', 'award', 'are', 'certainly', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'Washington', 'been', 'nominated', 'many', 'times', 'won', 'twice', 'saying', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'today.I', 'am', 'opinion', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'successful', 'career', 'charisma', 'etc', 'who', 'succomb', 'drugs', 'alcoholism', 'are', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'public', 'academy', 'long', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'received', 'accolades', 'playing', 'couple', 'destroyed', 'alcohol.The', 'scene', 'set', 'Flight', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'when', 'Washington', 'shown', 'doing', 'cocaine', 'alcohol', 'stewardess', 'later', 'killed', 'movie', 'go', 'fairly', 'routine', 'flight', 'Florida', 'Georgia', 'first', 'Washington', 'hailed', 'hero', 'landing', 'plane', 'was', 'flawed', 'mentioned', 'other', 'pilot', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'However', 'when', 'investigation', 'had', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'system', 'flying', 'aircraft', 'end', 'result', 'up', 'jail', 'least', 'five', 'years', 'actually', 'admitted', 'fact', 'had', 'coke', 'alcohol', 'system', 'time.I', 'thought', 'Tamara', 'Tunie', 'was', 'good', 'surviving', 'stewardess', 'wish', 'Garcelle', 'Beauvais', 'had', 'been', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'great', 'actor', 'think', 'was', 'miscast', 'attorney', 'Washington', 'character', 'greatest', 'supporting', 'character', 'was', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'was', 'supplier', 'Washington', 'who', 'actually', 'saved', 'life', 'Goodman', 'was', 'hilarious', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'co-pilot', 'did', 'well', 'moral', 'conscious', 'movie', 'who', 'knew', 'Washington', 'was', 'drunk', 'flight', 'co-pilot', 'now', 'going', 'ruined', 'life', 'Washington', 'not', 'fact', 'plane', 'was', 'flawed', '.Many', 'stories', 'are', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'downfall', 'known', 'hubris', 'most', 'are', 'existing', 'portrayal', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'recent', 'years', 'truly', 'brought', 'light', 'great', 'actor', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'However', 'do', 'believe', 'lot', 'great', 'actors', 'Washington', 'playing', 'more', 'movies', 'playing', 'character', 'John', 'Wayne', 'many', 'others', 'became', 'so', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'are', 'hardly', 'be', 'considered', 'acting', 'anymore', 'Unfortunately', 'Denzel', 'falling', 'category', 'as', 'well', 'like', 'actor', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'well', 'written', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'what', 'end', 'result', 'will', 'be']",Flight Combo

1608646,A2S3ZLA5CZU4Q7,B00AF6B22E,C. L. Messina,"[0, 0]","Plot: Substance abusing pilot pulls off truly miraculous airplane recovery with relatively little loss of life. Investigation probes his secret life of addiction while other stakeholders try to keep his name clean, whether he's willing or even capable of going along with their hopes and efforts.Acting: Doesn't get much better. Everyone is believable.Photography: Very easy on the eye visuals throughout.I just had to state that. This IS a very good film for many reasons, but it has one aspect that is hard for me to get over- the premise.Denzel's character recovers the plane from an inevitable crash, but how he does it makes every recovery effort in the history of mankind seem like child's play. His recovery IS a true miracle, and an outstanding bit of directorial work that makes the film worthwhile on it's own. In addition to pulling off a miracle, the manner in which Denzel's character executes it is legendary. He's in the middle of a true catastrophy overloaded with bewildering amount of information (bad and good info, all that has to be sorted faster than the blink of an eye), yet he eases through it like he was driving a van through a car wash. Again, this character's feat is miraculous. It doesn't go unnoticed, either- people directly next to him during that feat live to tell.Do they tell a story of heroics? Do they talk about a miracle that boggles imagination? Are they grateful and feel any debt of gratitude?NOOOO! No one does. In fact, most seem somewhat indignant about it and the investigation brushes all that aside to make the point that the character has a possible drinking problem. Actually, the investigators findings only prove that, at most, he's had two mini-bar sized vodkas before or during the flight.So, put all this into perspective. A meteor the size of a lake is about to destroy the Earth. A man with a bow and arrow believes if he can be lifted into space with a hot air balloon and aims at the right angle he can deflect it (Others have deflected pebble sized meteors like this before in this scenario so bare with me). Beyond all hope and odds, he pulls it off but five people die from some a spoonful sized bit he couldn't deflect. We found out he had two mini-bar sized bottles of vodka before he went up, and what do the people of Earth do? They crucify him! They want his blood! They want him in jail for life, at the very least!That's basically what the premise of this movie felt like and it was VERY difficult to sit through.I mean, it's easy to see Denzel's character has serious substance abuse issues- but that's something WE know about, not the investigators. But we still have to consider their logic- drinking is bad. Even under the guise that it impairs performance, how does that reasoning stand up to a miraculously, flawless, incredible performance?What if Michaal Phelps drank a bottle of vodka before every meet and STILL managed to win all his gold medals? Would we want blood? Would we vilify him?OK, done with my rant.Great film if you can overlook that aspect of it.",4,"Almost perfect, but...",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,3041,"['Plot', 'Substance', 'abusing', 'pilot', 'pulls', 'off', 'truly', 'miraculous', 'airplane', 'recovery', 'relatively', 'little', 'loss', 'life', 'Investigation', 'secret', 'life', 'addiction', 'other', 'stakeholders', 'try', 'keep', 'name', 'clean', 'willing', 'even', 'capable', 'going', 'hopes', 'efforts.Acting', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Everyone', 'believable.Photography', 'Very', 'easy', 'eye', 'visuals', 'throughout.I', 'just', 'had', 'state', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'many', 'reasons', 'one', 'aspect', 'hard', 'get', 'over-', 'premise.Denzel', 'character', 'plane', 'inevitable', 'crash', 'how', 'recovery', 'effort', 'history', 'mankind', 'seem', 'child', 'play', 'recovery', 'true', 'miracle', 'outstanding', 'bit', 'directorial', 'work', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'own', 'addition', 'pulling', 'off', 'miracle', 'manner', 'Denzel', 'character', 'legendary', 'middle', 'true', 'catastrophy', 'overloaded', 'bewildering', 'amount', 'information', 'bad', 'good', 'info', 'be', 'sorted', 'faster', 'blink', 'eye', 'yet', 'was', 'driving', 'van', 'car', 'wash.', 'Again', 'character', 'feat', 'miraculous', ""n't"", 'go', 'unnoticed', 'either-', 'people', 'directly', 'next', 'feat', 'live', 'tell.Do', 'tell', 'story', 'heroics', 'Do', 'talk', 'miracle', 'imagination', 'Are', 'grateful', 'feel', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'NOOOO', 'one', 'fact', 'most', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'indignant', 'investigation', 'aside', 'make', 'point', 'character', 'possible', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Actually', 'investigators', 'only', 'prove', 'most', 'had', 'two', 'mini-bar', 'sized', 'vodkas', 'flight.So', 'put', 'perspective', 'meteor', 'size', 'lake', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'man', 'bow', 'arrow', 'can', 'be', 'lifted', 'space', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'aims', 'right', 'angle', 'can', 'deflect', 'Others', 'have', 'deflected', 'pebble', 'sized', 'meteors', 'before', 'scenario', 'so', 'bare', 'hope', 'odds', 'off', 'five', 'people', 'die', 'spoonful', 'sized', 'bit', 'could', ""n't"", 'deflect', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'two', 'mini-bar', 'sized', 'bottles', 'vodka', 'went', 'up', 'do', 'people', 'Earth', 'do', 'crucify', 'want', 'blood', 'want', 'jail', 'life', 'very', 'least', 'basically', 'what', 'premise', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'VERY', 'difficult', 'sit', 'through.I', 'mean', 'easy', 'see', 'Denzel', 'character', 'serious', 'substance', 'issues-', 'something', 'WE', 'know', 'not', 'investigators', 'still', 'have', 'consider', 'logic-', 'drinking', 'bad', 'Even', 'guise', 'performance', 'how', 'reasoning', 'stand', 'up', 'miraculously', 'flawless', 'incredible', 'performance', 'What', 'Michaal', 'Phelps', 'drank', 'bottle', 'vodka', 'meet', 'STILL', 'managed', 'win', 'gold', 'medals', 'Would', 'want', 'blood', 'Would', 'vilify', 'OK', 'done', 'rant.Great', 'film', 'can', 'overlook', 'aspect']",Flight Combo

Don't read the next paragraph if you plan to see this movie.The plot isn't all that complex. An airline pilot named Whit has been up all night and presumably needs to rush to the airport for a short flight between Atlanta and Orlando. To give himself a little pick me up he does a couple lines of coke. looking not exactly bright eyed, Whit is working with a new co-pilot. The rest of the flight crew are the flight attendants he knows, including his current girlfriend who is his partner in sex, drink, and drugs. The takeoff almost immediately turns bad. I wasn't sure if this was his own bad condition or a legitimate problem, but the plane was shaking like crazy which reminded me of a recent flight I took that left me ill and white knuckled. Once things are stabilized, Whit personally comes out to tell the passengers that it was all a freak occurrence and that everything is o.k. However, he is standing by the galley while making all this comforting banter and what the passengers and crew can't see is Whit emptying three bottles of booze into a bottle of o.j. He returns to the cockpit and ends up taking a snooze (or is passed out) when a system malfunction occurs.  Whit wakes up and all hll is breaking loose. The plane loses altitude, is destabilized, and eventually starts nose diving before it does a 180 degree flip that has it flying upside. Whit manages to pull off the impossible and lands the plane in a field, but not before shearing off a church steeple. Loss of life was inevitable, but only four passengers and two flight attendants die. Whit is hailed as a hero to the extent that he us up there with Sully Sullenberg. Everything is sort of blissful. Whit goes to his farm and destroys what can only be likened to a mini liquor store appears to be shaken enough to possibly change his bad habits ...... for awhile. What Whit doesn't seem aware of, but most viewers would is that they have taken bloods samples that reveal a very high alcohol level and the presence of cocaine. With the NTSD investigating, the airline hires hires a lawyer that will kill the blood test results and all Whit has to do is stay clean and evade and lie. Whit denies initially that he is an alcoholic and that he has a drug problem, but he is so far beyond self control that he proceeds to have a running party with his favorite addictions.I liked this movie but found it depressing and hard to take as the movie progressed. The movie might have been called Addiction instead of Flight. It was brutal, sad, frustrating, and no doubt too realistic. While Whit has something akin to a moment of clarity near the end when it was obvious that the cause of the crash was poor airline maintenance, the ending that was tacked on seemed a little unrealistic based on Whit's abysmal relationship with his son. I didn't things would seemingly heal only fourteen months after the crash and logically trust would have to be earned over a period of time. However, that was probably my only real problem with a movie that was very realistic and very painful for someone touched by alcoholism or drug abuse.",4,"Exciting, Well Acted, And Frightening",1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,3331,"['never', 'made', 'out', 'movies', 'see', 'heard', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'had', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'so', 'cashed', 'expiring', 'Best', 'Buy', 'Bucks', 'bought', 'deluxe', 'copy', 'was', 'only', 'copy', 'left', 'store', '.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'next', 'paragraph', 'plan', 'see', 'movie.The', 'plot', ""n't"", 'complex', 'airline', 'pilot', 'named', 'Whit', 'been', 'up', 'night', 'presumably', 'rush', 'airport', 'short', 'flight', 'Atlanta', 'Orlando', 'give', 'little', 'pick', 'couple', 'lines', 'coke', 'looking', 'not', 'exactly', 'bright', 'eyed', 'Whit', 'working', 'new', 'co-pilot', 'rest', 'flight', 'crew', 'are', 'flight', 'attendants', 'including', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'partner', 'sex', 'drink', 'drugs', 'takeoff', 'almost', 'immediately', 'turns', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'own', 'bad', 'condition', 'legitimate', 'problem', 'plane', 'was', 'shaking', 'crazy', 'reminded', 'recent', 'flight', 'took', 'left', 'ill', 'white', 'knuckled', 'things', 'are', 'stabilized', 'Whit', 'personally', 'out', 'tell', 'passengers', 'was', 'freak', 'occurrence', 'everything', 'o.k', 'However', 'standing', 'galley', 'making', 'comforting', 'banter', 'what', 'passengers', 'crew', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Whit', 'emptying', 'three', 'bottles', 'booze', 'bottle', 'o.j', 'cockpit', 'up', 'taking', 'snooze', 'passed', 'out', 'when', 'system', 'malfunction', 'Whit', 'up', 'hll', 'breaking', 'loose', 'plane', 'altitude', 'destabilized', 'eventually', 'nose', 'diving', '180', 'degree', 'flip', 'flying', 'upside', 'Whit', 'pull', 'off', 'impossible', 'plane', 'field', 'not', 'shearing', 'off', 'church', 'steeple', 'Loss', 'life', 'was', 'inevitable', 'only', 'four', 'passengers', 'two', 'flight', 'attendants', 'die', 'Whit', 'hailed', 'hero', 'extent', 'there', 'Sully', 'Sullenberg', 'Everything', 'sort', 'blissful', 'Whit', 'farm', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'likened', 'mini', 'liquor', 'store', 'be', 'shaken', 'enough', 'possibly', 'change', 'bad', 'habits', 'awhile', 'What', 'Whit', ""n't"", 'seem', 'aware', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'bloods', 'samples', 'reveal', 'very', 'high', 'alcohol', 'level', 'presence', 'cocaine', 'NTSD', 'investigating', 'airline', 'lawyer', 'will', 'kill', 'blood', 'test', 'results', 'Whit', 'do', 'stay', 'clean', 'evade', 'lie', 'Whit', 'initially', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'problem', 'so', 'far', 'self', 'control', 'have', 'running', 'party', 'favorite', 'addictions.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'found', 'depressing', 'hard', 'take', 'movie', 'progressed', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Addiction', 'instead', 'Flight', 'was', 'brutal', 'sad', 'frustrating', 'doubt', 'too', 'realistic', 'Whit', 'something', 'akin', 'moment', 'clarity', 'end', 'when', 'was', 'obvious', 'cause', 'crash', 'was', 'poor', 'airline', 'maintenance', 'ending', 'was', 'tacked', 'seemed', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'based', 'Whit', 'abysmal', 'relationship', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'things', 'would', 'seemingly', 'heal', 'only', 'fourteen', 'months', 'crash', 'logically', 'trust', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'earned', 'period', 'time', 'However', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'very', 'painful', 'someone', 'touched', 'alcoholism', 'drug', 'abuse']",Flight Combo

It is a good but not great film, with more than a few flaws that cannot be overlooked.Let&#8217;s start with the positive.  Denzel Washington gives strong performance in a role that is absolutely the centerpiece of the film.  The events of the actual airplane flight of the title are gripping, and the action sequences of the flight itself are very well done, and will cause many a viewer to wonder how they were faked. (&#8220;Did they really crash a plane into a field to generate that footage?&#8221;)  The story &#8220;Flight&#8221; is really about, one man&#8217;s battle with alcohol and drug addictions, is a compelling one.Now to the flaws.  Flight aspires to be a serious film, yet it has characters and scenes that detract from the emotional impact the film is attempting to make.  One of these characters is the pilot's drug dealer friend, whose appearances are so over-the-top with quick wittedness that he comes across as a stand-up comic doing a rehearsed routine, rather than a real person.  The co-pilot is an idiot (could any trained, licensed pilot really be that bad under pressure?) whose stupidity is only exceeded later in the film by his wife, a mindless Christian automaton who could have been portrayed by a piece of cardboard with &#34;Praise Jesus!&#34; written on it.As for scenes, several of the &#34;drinking to excess&#34; scenes seem over-the-top (is it really possible to consume that much alcohol and survive?), and it is a bit hard to believe that the pilot would think and act that well during the crisis in flight after a night of heavy boozing and drugs, with barely any sleep.  The movie builds towards a courtroom drama scene, yet the courtroom is really a NTSB hearing, and any viewer will immediately be able to cite several hundred other more dramatic courtroom scenes from film and TV history.If you are looking for a much more compelling film about the evils of alcohol and how they can put a person on a long downward spiral, I recommend &#34;Leaving Las Vegas&#34; with Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue.  That film is more difficult to watch because of the powerful emotions its images conjure up, but it ultimately does a much better job than &#34;Flight&#34; of conveying the same messages.",3,"&#8220;Flight&#8221; doesn&#8217;t soar, but neither does it crash",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,2337,"['am', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'see', '8220', 'Flight', '8221', 'many', 'Top', '10', 'Best', 'Movies', '2013', 'lists', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'more', 'few', 'flaws', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked.Let', '8217', 's', 'start', 'positive', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'strong', 'performance', 'role', 'absolutely', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'events', 'actual', 'airplane', 'flight', 'title', 'are', 'gripping', 'action', 'sequences', 'flight', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'cause', 'many', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'how', 'were', 'faked', '8220', 'Did', 'really', 'crash', 'plane', 'field', 'generate', 'footage', '8221', 'story', '8220', 'Flight', '8221', 'really', 'about', 'one', 'man', '8217', 's', 'battle', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'addictions', 'compelling', 'one.Now', 'flaws', 'Flight', 'be', 'serious', 'film', 'characters', 'scenes', 'detract', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film', 'attempting', 'make', 'One', 'characters', 'pilot', 'drug', 'dealer', 'friend', 'appearances', 'are', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'quick', 'wittedness', 'across', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'doing', 'rehearsed', 'routine', 'rather', 'real', 'person', 'co-pilot', 'idiot', 'could', 'trained', 'licensed', 'pilot', 'really', 'be', 'bad', 'pressure', 'stupidity', 'only', 'exceeded', 'later', 'film', 'wife', 'mindless', 'Christian', 'automaton', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'piece', 'cardboard', '34', 'Praise', 'Jesus', '34', 'written', 'it.As', 'scenes', 'several', '34', 'drinking', 'excess', '34', 'scenes', 'seem', 'over-the-top', 'really', 'possible', 'consume', 'much', 'alcohol', 'survive', 'bit', 'hard', 'believe', 'pilot', 'would', 'think', 'act', 'well', 'crisis', 'flight', 'night', 'heavy', 'boozing', 'drugs', 'barely', 'sleep', 'movie', 'towards', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'scene', 'courtroom', 'really', 'NTSB', 'hearing', 'viewer', 'will', 'immediately', 'be', 'able', 'cite', 'several', 'hundred', 'other', 'more', 'dramatic', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'film', 'TV', 'history.If', 'are', 'looking', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'film', 'evils', 'alcohol', 'how', 'can', 'put', 'person', 'long', 'downward', 'spiral', 'recommend', '34', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'film', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'images', 'conjure', 'up', 'ultimately', 'much', 'better', 'job', '34', 'Flight', '34', 'conveying', 'same', 'messages']",Flight Combo
1608670,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00AF6B22E,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","""Flight"" is the first live-action Robert Zemeckis directed film since ""Cast Away"" back in 2000 and after viewing it you'll wonder why Zemeckis took so long to return to the format. This is the man who brought us the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" and ""Forrest Gump."" Despite how charming ""The Polar Express"" might be, Zemeckis kind of wore out the alluring nature of motion capture animation with the sub-par ""Beowulf"" and the decent enough ""A Christmas Carol."" Zemeckis is at his best with his live-action roots. ""Flight"" is also the first R-rated Zemeckis film in over 20 years.Expectations going into this were somewhere along the lines of, ""So this is basically going to be Denzel Washington portraying Quagmire from 'Family Guy,' right?"" ""Flight"" is driven by alcoholism and the belief in God. Whip (Washington) is an alcoholic, but refuses to admit it. He drinks constantly, relies on cocaine to even him out, and tends to have sex with whoever he can. He has an ex-wife and a fifteen year old son who want nothing to do with him. Whip is eventually put under investigation with not only his job on the line, but jail time as well. Whip lands a plane that fell apart in the air; 96 of the 102 passengers lived because of Whip's incredible maneuvering in the sky, but alcohol was in his system so that's where the jail time could come in.From the very first scene, you know that R-rating is going to be pushed to its limit as there's plenty of nudity, vulgarity, and drugs as soon as Whip is woken up by that phone call from his ex-wife early in the morning. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but there's this rushing close up of Washington's face as he does a line of coke before it jumps to the next scene that is pretty great. You're introduced to how serious Whip's addiction is as he takes oxygen hits before the plane takes off and dumps alcohol into his orange juice while he's talking to the passengers. This may be the performance of Denzel Washington's career as he finally seems to be stepping outside his comfort zone and delivering in ways you didn't expect going in.The flight sequence itself is done in a very realistic way. It's already pretty intense when they're trying to get through the patch of rough weather, but turns into a white knuckled frenzy once the plane begins to malfunction. Your breath quickens as the events inside that plane become horrifying and the devastating aftermath will leave you completely breathless. You see Whip get pulled from the wreckage, but the film suddenly switches to first person and you see what Whip sees. It's pretty extraordinary.The hospital scene is really emotional as Whip wakes up and is told the extent of not only his injuries, but the crash itself. As Whip talks to Charlie (Bruce Greenwood), there's this moment when Whip is smiling but tears begin to stream down his face that just breaks your heart. John Goodman is the funniest he's been since ""The Big Lebowski"" as Whip's friend Harling Mays. He plays interference for Whip during the investigation as he brings Whip everything he needs while reporters wait outside of his condo. On Whip's last night at the hospital, he steps onto the staircase to smoke and meets a heroin addict named Nicole (Kelly Reilly). The cancer patient they encounter in that stairwell (James Badge Dale) is the most entertaining character of the film and you'll wish there was more of him. He's extremely humorous and witty while offering a little bit of insight.As the film progresses, Whip loses more and more control. It's kind of ridiculous what finally triggers Whip to realize things are bad. Losing his family didn't do it and neither did being responsible for six people losing their lives, but once blame is about to shift directions that's when Whip decides he's had enough. The film also teaches you that if you're incredibly drunk, you can just do a few lines of coke to even out. That bathtub full of cocaine you've got sitting at home will finally come in handy. The ending also feels like a bit of a cop out.

Well it's the flight gone to hell and the extraordinary action that takes place as a pilot does something that not one other pilot is later able to duplicate in a simulator.  Yes, this pilot is just that good, as is the knuckle-whitening action of this part of the movie.  5 stars for the flight scenes.  This is what had me purchasing the movie instead of just renting it or getting it from the library.  I fully expected that I'd be watching this movie again in the future.What we aren't told just from watching the trailer is that more than the flight, this movie is about a man with a serious alcohol addiction and his ability, for the most part, to function while drunk.  As a matter of fact, this aspect is the bulk of the movie.  Denzel Washington once again does an incredible job and not just because he stumbles around drunk on occasion.  We get to know a man who is a very flawed hero as we witness his complete denial about his problem,  Much of the movie has you  disgusted with this person, amazed at the quantity he drinks as well as hopeful that he'll beat his addiction.  It's difficult to watch him mess up time and time again as different people in his life try to help him.  5 stars for the acting.But it's a very difficult movie to sit through.  Worth it?  Yes.

The opening sequence includes perhaps the most hair-raising plane crash scene ever, so spectacular that even if you know what to expect, that won't prevent you from crushing your popcorn box from the tension of it. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.At the wheel of the stricken jet is Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who pulls off a landing only less miraculous than the real life exploit of Chesley Sullenberger who landed his own craft in the Hudson River in 2009, losing not a soul aboard. There is one major difference however. Whitaker is both drunk and stoned when he is piloting the craft although his condition is not the reason the airliner malfunctions.It is the twin truth, acknowledged by all involved (including the viewer,) that Whitaker is both a self-centered alcoholic AND the only pilot with the chops that could have saved the 96 passengers on Flight 227. However, six others perished, including a crew member with whom he was having a fling with, and so the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is called in to investigate.Despite his heroics, Whitaker is under suspicion for the high level of alcohol found in his system and the two empty vodka bottles retrieved from the airliner's trash compartment. It having been a non-beverage service flight, only the crew is suspect although we had seen Whip empty them into an orange juice container right before the airplane lost control.As Whitaker waits for the NTSB hearing that will either clear his name or place him in prison for manslaughter, the audience is torn between sympathy and revulsion. Sympathy because he did indeed save the plane and revulsion because he is a classic addict, living a life encumbered by lies and excuses.What transpires at the hearing and the night before is the watershed moment of both the movie and the life of Whip Whitaker.  The subsequent ending, based on what transpires, contains an ambiguity that is both justified and satisfying.Washington is flawless here, his acting abilities never put to better use.

It shows how the unions will protect and defend even the worst of it's people, and of course most lawyers will say and do anything for money as we all know. The justice system was never intended to let the clearly guilty go free, but was designed to ferret out the guilty and give them a ""FAIR"" punishment, and not the death penalty for jay-walking lets say as an example.In this society, we've made the guilty all victims of our society, when the real victims are now the good people that do the right things everyday and on the side of right.

I saw the stabilizer falling like a leaf, and the small plane spiraling down.

All the way through the movie he lies to himself, his family, his friends, and everybody else because of his underlying desire to drink all the time.  He is so drunk all the time that he ""has to"" use cocaine to get him up and running, so he can function as a pilot. As a ""functioning alcohol"", only those close to him know what is really going on with his alcohol and cocaine abuse.  The ""big day"" finally comes when he has to pilot a 102 passenger plane with what turned out to be a defective elevator.  He has to roll the plane upside down to get it out of a nose dive, and then roll it back again right-side-up to land it in a field.  Everyone believes he is a hero, until things start to unravel because of his alcoholism.  What I loved about this movie was the ending, because the pilot finally came to gripes with his addictions.  It all came to a head in a Federal hearing, when he was asked if it was his opinon that one of the deceased flight attendants consumed the two, (empty) vodka bottles found on board the doomed flight.  Up to that point, he had been lying all through the hearing. He could have pinned it on her and walked away ""free"", but his conscience finally gets the best of him and he admits he drank the vodka on board, that he drinks all the time to excess, that he was drunk every day up to the date of flight, and that he was drunk now in court.  I won't tell you the whole ending - but it gets better.  I gave it three stars because of some nudity, rampant use of the ""f"" word, and cocaine use scenes.

I have to assume were they more truthful, fewer people would have forked over the dough to see it.Here's the scoop. Denzel wakes up on the morning of his next flight. He's in bed with a flight attendant. They're drinking and doing cocaine. During said flight a malfunction threatens the plane. He's able to miraculously bring it down and only lose 6 ""souls"" in the process. During his recovery it's discovered that he has a lot of liquor and drugs in his system, so industry politics sets in to try and keep him from going from being a hero to a criminal. It's a rough road and he stumbles a lot.I thought this plot was going to be more mechanical. That it would tighten and tighten until the investigators found the crucial element that brought the plane down and exonerated Denzel. Nope. This is a drama about him coming to terms with his alcoholism. You see all the fits and starts. You hear all the lies he says to everyone, including himself, as he journeys down an uncertain path.Zemeckis has come a long way as a director. This is much more subtle an outing than we're used to seeing from him. The scene where the plane is going down, as harrowing and white knuckling as it is, is much less 'in your face' than it might have been had he done it a decade ago. It's quieter overall as well. Given the subject matter there could have been a lot more histrionics than there were. The scenes and performances are more subdued and introspective. It also sports a softer look. He goes for a more natural feel. His projects usually aim for visual excess.Michael Phillips, reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, loved this film. He gave it his highest rating. As much as I liked it, I didn't think it achieved quite the level he did. Not because it wasn't done well. I'm just not convinced that some of Washington's struggles with his beast haven't already been done before in films such as ""Clean and Sober"" and ""The Lost Weekend"" to name just a few.

Besides, Nadine Velazquez is quite beautiful in that scene.There are so many, but here are a few of my favorite scenes:The lead up to the crash. &#34;We're gonna roll it.&#34; Washington and Brian Geraghty were brilliant in that. Washington for his cool control and Geraghty for his aghast yet still maintaining professionalism and executing commands.Harling Mays enters the hospital ward. Classic modern day pusher. Bling, blending in. Seeing Goodman with Washington brought back memories of &#34;Fallen.&#34; You hate that cocaine is what makes them &#34;buddies&#34; in Flight, yet there is something about their relationship that also feels good. You know they have each others back.The hospital stairway scene with Washington, Kelly Reilly and James Badge Dale were great in that unusual scene. Dale philosophizing as a dying man was really thought provoking. His insight into why they had &#34;accidentally&#34; converged in that stairwell proved to be key to the rest of what happened in the move.Washington pays unexpected visit to his ex wife's home. Great scene showing how a drunk no longer processes decorum properly. Washington thinks he is being a great dad in that scene, but has actually brought terror into that home. I almost felt sorry for Washington in that scene. I knew he was lost when I saw it. Of course, like a good alcoholic, seconds later he was giving a sentimental statement to the press that indeed garnered sympathy.All the scenes with Kelly Reilly. Great actress. The British actresses Georgia peach accent was awesome.The real fun was racking my brain trying to figure out who the heck she was. I nearly kicked over the table when &#34;Caroline Bingley&#34; popped into my brain. Yeah, she plays a fairly raunchy character in the beginning, but there is still something pure about her and that plays out well in the final scenes.Washington finds the stash of booze in the adjoining hotel suite. Like a lot of viewers, I really prayed on that one hoping he wouldn't mess up the effort at staying sober. The long focus on that lone tiny bottle of destruction and then his hand swooping in to grab it was great cinema.Washington with Reilly outside her new job. Really a nice, hopeful, scene, but when she mentions the AA meeting, you know things are about to go downhill.The hearing scene with &#34;Miss Block.&#34; All the great men sitting there waiting for Washington to put them back in secure positions. The press waiting to confirm him a bona fide &#34;hero&#34; but his love and respect for all of the women in the movie, especially Trina, Nicole and Margaret, overcomes him and he decides it's &#34;now or never.&#34; Again, I was left a bit dismayed thinking about all the effort that had gone into patching things up for him, but the overriding thought was that him taking himself out of the sky with lives in his hands at the controls of jet airplanes was the right thing to do, despite the appearance that that is not why he did it.Overall, a 5 star movie for me because it was just so very different than any movie I've ever seen.

Many believe that the first half hour, the ""flight in the air"" segment, is terrific; but the reactions of most people to the remainder of the film, i.e., the ""flight on the ground"" segment, range from ""just O.K."" to ""a snore,"" with many people putting the blame on ""the television-quality script.""Upon further questioning, I have found that what seems to bother people the most is their belief that, drunk or not drunk, high or not high, Whip Whitaker would have landed the aircraft successfully, so what's all the fuss about Whip being legally drunk while piloting the aircraft?It doesn't seem to help that many people are cognizant of the fact that many alcoholics and heavy drinkers eventually reach the point where almost no one can tell if they are drunk because they don't act drunk; and if they don't act drunk, then they are most likely not significantly impaired, or so goes the reasoning.  So people ask, ""How does the film justify Whip going to jail?""I surmise they have some difficulty dealing with the ambiguity and the complexity of what is going on.  That it was illegal for Whip to be piloting an aircraft with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit just isn't enough reason to justify Whip going to jail.Interesting.  In real life would these same people be concerned if, for example, they found out that a person driving under the influence went unpunished because a court determined that the person was driving with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit but  was not significantly impaired?  Of course not. But evidently they can accept this in a film.  They can handle the ambiguity in real life but not in a film.(I loved the ""flight in the air"" segment, but didn't like the rest of the film, upon my first viewing.  But I felt compelled to figure out why I didn't like the remainder of the film, so I watched it again, and came up with the above.

A functioning alcoholic, Whip's personal life and career success are disjointed pieces of a puzzle that begin to form a picture of a flawed, sometimes unlikeable, often endearing, heroic, and complex man. On the fateful morning that begins the film, Whip is hungover after drinking the night away with a stewardess. In the early morning light of a hotel room, Whip faces a telephone argument over child support with his ex-wife and has a line of coke to start the day off right in preparation for work. In the cockpit later that day, it's clear that Whip is a natural- while his type A copilot freezes up during in-flight turbulence, Whip takes command of the situation, and all appears right. Steadying his nerves afterwards with a couple of small vodkas from which Whip concocts his own in-flight screwdriver, the jet hurtles forward until more turbulence is hit. What enfolds during and after the fateful flight comprise the movie's plotline. But the real plotline is a man struggling to find his integrity and sobriety, and what the definition of truth is that he can face up and live with. A spectacular cast, soundtrack, script, and film, ""Flight"" is not  for the faint-hearted or those who want escapist entertainment.

1608891,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B00AF6B22E,Get Serious,"[2, 8]","This film is a hodgepodge of events concerning 'heavy' aircraft and the pilots who fly them. Let's look at the subplots:*An aircraft fails due to faulty maintenance.*A heroic black pilot saves the plane and most of the passenger's lives through an impossible performance.*Said pilot is dysfunctional and a veteran alcoholic.The film is about an hour too long, being extremely repetitive in watching Washington's character feed his addiction in continuously drinking. The actual action which takes place is short and overly abbreviated, the writer/producers concentrating on what amounts to a basic unrecoverable alcoholic, the rub being the character has a job in which drinking is completely prohibited. The film showcases blacks in positons-of-authority: the lead pilot (Washington) is black; the head of the NTSB is black; the EMT is black. I could not tell if this was an unintentional casting or if a message was being sent. Sexuality is biracial, which was intentional.The accident--the accident is a far-fetched redition of the Alaska Airlines 261 crash over the ocean near LA(2000), in which a horizontal trim stabilizer jackscrew failed in a McDonal-Douglas MD-83 aircraft, due to extended maintenance schedules and poor design. In a severe dive the pilots attempted to fly the plane upside down, as the stabilizer froze the plane in a nose-down dive. This was unsuccessful and all 88 souls died instantly when the aircraft hit the ocean! What the producers did in the film (having the pilot fly the aircraft upside down 500 feet AGL) was overtly impossible and ridiculous! And of course only six people die! The message is ""sure I'm an alcoholic, but I'm black so I'm capable of the impossible!"" The film loses ALL credibility here. The producers attempted to send a propaganda message utilizing weak science, which makes this film absolutely suck!Don't even bother to seek this film out...it would be a waste of your time!As an aside, pilots associations have stated that having a veteran alcoholic pilot would be impossible to get by without detection!Alaska replaced all MD-80s and switched to Boeing 737's.

That is what this movie is really all about -- the fall-out that happens when you drink/do drugs & do anything..........drive...........fly a plane..........get married/have kids...........it is very well acted by everyone here & Denzel is captivating as a man who IS a hero but a flawed one at best. The 2 are not mutually exclusive. That is what makes this movie worth seeing. Put yourself on that plane...............do you want this Pilot flying it??  If so..........why or why not?  Being morally perfect doesn;t make you a better pilot.

Denzel knows who he is and what he is & you can see the slow realization that he has become a person that even HE cannot abide. A lying, dis-honorable man who had the potential to be a much better human being. And wants to get back to that guy he used to think he could be. The ending is a melodramatic mess & I didn;t believe he would &#34;come out&#34; at that public of a meeting BUT Denzel pulls it off because you believe him by then. He inhabits this person. We all know someone who would be much better off if they never had another drink & we all know the utter frustration of watching them keep on drinking. Denzel becomes that guy -- the father,the friend, the Hero pilot, the husband, the junkie ,the drunk who cannot stop himself from destroying himself ....... the user, the role model & finally the convict. Denzel covers a lot of emotional ground  & he does it with style. The supporting actors are all very good. And the crashing plane sequence is astonishing. Accurate? I have no idea but Holy Moly it grabs you & throws you around the plane along with the crew & passengers & frankly -- heck yeah - I want him as my Pilot in that situation! And I want him fully juiced so he can handle it and THEN he can go to re-hab. When you're up against the devil you need a Priest who has seen Satan a time or 2.

1608904,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AF6B22E,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","FLIGHT is a film that attracts devotees of Denzel Washington - and for good reason because he gives a convincing performance as a conflicted alcoholic cocaine addict who despite the fact that he wastes most of his life and relationships with his substance abuse, he still is one of the finest pilots in the air. And if that is the reason for watching his overly long attenuated movie then the rewards will be there.The story as written by John Gatins and directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future etc) begins correctly enough with a wasted Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) still drunk and drug addled with his flight attendant girlfriend Trina (Nadine Velazquez) interrupted by a telephone call form Whips ex-wife requesting tuition, money for their son. The two snort cocaine to get going from their hangovers and they are off to a flight to Atlanta.  Once aboard Whip's instability is noted by his anxious new co-pilot Ken (Brian Geraghty) but despite poor weather the flight takes off only to crash a bit later: Whip manages to pull it together enough to bring the airplane down in a field losing only six people in the crash (one being Trina).  The rest of the film is an endless diatribe of Whip recovering, getting control of his substance abuse only to repeatedly lose if again, meeting a pretty junkie Nicole (Kelly Reilly in a stand out role) who becomes his lover, meeting a terminal cancer patient Tiki (Charlie E. Schmidt), being counseled by his best friend Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) who brings in a lawyer Hugh (Don Cheadle) to attempt to coverup the fact that the investigation of the crash has shown that Whip was impaired by his excesses. A `resource' Harling Mays (John Goodman) keeps Whip supplied with drugs up to the last moment and it is only at the hearing (finally) that Whip confesses to investigator Ellen (Melissa Leo) that he was indeed drunk during the flight and in turn pays for the guilt with which he has been struggling in his semi-sober moments.The cinematography during the airplane crash is excellent and the supporting cast is very strong, but despite Washington's performance the movie misses on so many levels due to incomplete working through of sidebar plot lines.  The salvation for the film is in the last five minutes of fine acting by Washington, but by that time the audience is very tired of the manner in which a gifted pilot has wasted his (and everyone else's around him) life that clock watching takes over.

I understand why so many people had such mixed reaction to this film in the theaters. Here is one of the best action footage of an airplane in trouble over a rather dreary and mundane story. The action happens early in the film and then the adventure fizzles.We know from the beginning that Pilot Whip Whitaker, played wonderfully by the great Denzel Washington, has a drinking and drug abuse problem. He knows how to fake ""sober"" as he gets into the cockpit of his plane but the signs are clear. While into the flight, the plane is struck by mechanical failure and certain doom is on the horizon. The few minutes of a flight in peril were amazing and spellbinding. This is filmmaking at its best as it grabs the attention of the audience and we feel the peril.Whitaker performs the miraculous and saves the plane with only 4 lives lost. He becomes an instant hero having saved the majority of the occupants from certain death. Here we have the fascinating moral twist of the story. Whitaker is legally drunk while at the helm of the plane. Here is the moral conundrum. Despite being intoxicated, it appears that Whitaker is the only pilot on earth who could have saved the plane from a deadly crash and a total loss of life. It is thought provoking situation to consider as the NTSB investigation begins. Here the promise of the story is muddled in a stream of predictable cliches. Whitaker begins a romance with a drug addict on her way to being recovery while he decends further into the depths of his hell. The story becomes so tedious and so predictable that all interest is lost.Don Cheadle has a understated role as the pilot union attorney eager to keep Whitaker ""clean"" and ready for the investigation. While Cheadle is understated, add in John Goodman in a flamboyant roll as the drug dealer. So many talented actors in a mediocre film.The light of the film returns near the end of the film as Washington gives his all to Whitaker. Finally, we see why Denzel Washington is one of America's top actors. Will there be redemption? There is a great twist to the story that finally adds credibility to the story.FLIGHT is a film that excels at the beginning and at the end--everything in between is the low point.

Now many reviewers are not happy at all with what this movie, I suppose because the trailer leads one to believe it's an action packed movie and just that.  Well, there was the plane sequence and it was lively alright.  But the movie turns out really not to be about landing a plane expertly at all.  It's focus is about drug and alcohol addiction and how it affects your life and the ends people will go to to maintain an appearance of a normal life, and some pull it off pretty darn well, as was the case here.  I was not mad or bothered by the fact that the movie took a different turn than I expected.  Fact is, anymore, I don't really have an expectation that I know what a movie is going to be about, as trailers are really good at fooling you and leading you on.  So, if I like the leading actor or actress, and I like the general type of movie, (action,  adventure, etc)  then I roll the dice once in a while.As far as getting upset about the nudity in this picture,  all I can say is where there are drugs, alcohol, and a general out of control lifestyle, there is going to be sex.  It was not overly focused on, in my opinion,  that's just the real world, why sugar coat it.  I will say, I like the fact that in the end, the pilot confesses that he was drunk and had been for a long time, and made the decision to tell the truth instead of having it end with a slick lie and sliding out of it.  Some would probably have preferred that ending, and in reality it would be possible.

1609087,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00AF6B22E,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Flight, for me, is one of those movies that takes you completely by surprise. The way I understood it from the trailer we had a pilot (Denzel Washington) who does the unthinkable by saving close to 100 people in a plane crash. Then it turns out that doctors found high alcohol levels in his blood after performing a toxicology report while he was unconscious. Now, originally, I thought Flight was going to be a movie about him proving his innocence. Maybe someone set him up or something of that nature, but I was completely wrong.Flight follows the story of Whip Whitaker (Washington) after the aforementioned plane crash. What the trailer didn't tell you was that Whitaker is a raging alcoholic and, essentially, that's what this entire movie is about. Yes, there is a plane crash and yes he did save those people, but that lays the groundwork for something much more powerful. On the surface you have the plane crash, but when you dig deeper it's a strong story about alcoholism and drug addiction.While in the hospital recovering from his, surprisingly, mild injuries, Whitaker meets a drug addict by the name of Nicole (Kelly Reilly). These two eventually form a bond when Whip finds her being thrown out of her apartment complex not too long after he was released from the hospital. After we reach this point in the story things start to get really serious as the viewer starts to see just how bad Whip's alcoholism really is.One of the things I found most enjoyable about Flight was not only the powerful narrative, but the strong character development as well. As you watch Whip constantly get hammered it's hard not to feel something towards his character. Time and time again we see him attempt to quit and every time I found myself rooting for him, but he just doesn't have the willpower to put down the bottle of whatever his drink of choice is that night. It's almost heartbreaking because you can tell that he wants to stop, but he can't.Then there's Nicole. Towards the beginning of the movie I had a hard time understanding what her role was in the big picture because they give you little to no explanation about why she's there, but eventually her role becomes more apparent and, just like Whip, you feel for her. The only difference is that she truly wants to get clean. So she gets herself a job and starts going to AA meetings. Now I don't know how difficult it is to play a recovering addict, but Reilly did a fantastic job at portraying the constant struggle that these individuals have to go through to avoid a relapse.Along with the main gunners you have the supporting cast which consists of Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, and John Goodman. Cheadle plays Whip's lawyer Hugh Lang. I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like everything I see Cheadle in he's basically playing the same character with a different occupation. He's not a bad actor by any means, it just feels like he gives off the same persona in every role and that stops the viewer from creating any sort of emotional attachment with the character. With that said, he did a solid job as Hugh and I couldn't help but chuckle at a few of his facial expressions towards the end of the film. Bruce Greenwood plays Whip's old friend Charlie Anderson (talk about a plain name) who works for the airline's pilots union. He doesn't get a lot of screen time, but he gave a solid performance in the scenes he was in. Then you have Goodman who plays the hilarious drug dealer Harling Mays. What I loved about Goodman's character, other than his fantastic performance, was that it provided just enough comic relief so the movie didn't feel like an emotional burden. This is a serious topic so that little spice of comedy scattered throughout allows you to enjoy the story without leaving depressed.Overall Score: 8/10 - To say that Flight caught me off guard would be an understatement. I went in expecting one thing and instead was given a very powerful story about drug and alcohol dependency. Denzel comes through with another fantastic performance proving once again that he can bring just about any character to life. Couple that with a solid supporting cast and you have yourself a nice little film. It's hard for me not to recommend Flight because I grew up with family members who dealt with the same issues that are addressed in this film. Still, I understand that it's not for everyone, but if you have the time I definitely recommend you give it a chance.",4,8/10 - Good,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,4498,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Flight', 'one', 'movies', 'completely', 'surprise', 'way', 'understood', 'trailer', 'had', 'pilot', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'unthinkable', 'saving', 'close', '100', 'people', 'plane', 'crash', 'Then', 'out', 'doctors', 'found', 'high', 'alcohol', 'levels', 'blood', 'performing', 'toxicology', 'report', 'was', 'unconscious', 'Now', 'originally', 'thought', 'Flight', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'proving', 'innocence', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'set', 'up', 'something', 'nature', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong.Flight', 'story', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'Washington', 'aforementioned', 'plane', 'crash', 'What', 'trailer', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'Whitaker', 'raging', 'alcoholic', 'essentially', 'what', 'entire', 'movie', 'about', 'Yes', 'plane', 'crash', 'yes', 'did', 'save', 'people', 'groundwork', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'surface', 'have', 'plane', 'crash', 'when', 'dig', 'deeper', 'strong', 'story', 'alcoholism', 'drug', 'addiction.While', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'surprisingly', 'mild', 'injuries', 'Whitaker', 'drug', 'addict', 'name', 'Nicole', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'two', 'eventually', 'form', 'bond', 'when', 'Whip', 'being', 'thrown', 'apartment', 'complex', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'released', 'hospital', 'reach', 'point', 'story', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'really', 'serious', 'viewer', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'Whip', 'alcoholism', 'really', 'is.One', 'things', 'found', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'Flight', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'powerful', 'narrative', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'Whip', 'constantly', 'get', 'hammered', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'something', 'character', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'see', 'attempt', 'quit', 'time', 'found', 'rooting', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'willpower', 'put', 'down', 'bottle', 'drink', 'choice', 'night', 'almost', 'heartbreaking', 'can', 'tell', 'stop', 'Nicole', 'beginning', 'movie', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'role', 'was', 'big', 'picture', 'give', 'little', 'explanation', 'why', 'there', 'eventually', 'role', 'more', 'apparent', 'just', 'Whip', 'feel', 'only', 'difference', 'truly', 'get', 'clean', 'job', 'going', 'AA', 'meetings', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'difficult', 'play', 'recovering', 'addict', 'Reilly', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'constant', 'struggle', 'individuals', 'have', 'go', 'avoid', 'relapse.Along', 'main', 'gunners', 'have', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Cheadle', 'Whip', 'lawyer', 'Hugh', 'Lang', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'everything', 'see', 'Cheadle', 'basically', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'different', 'occupation', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'means', 'just', 'feels', 'same', 'persona', 'role', 'viewer', 'creating', 'sort', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'character', 'said', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'Hugh', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'few', 'facial', 'expressions', 'end', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Whip', 'old', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'Anderson', 'talk', 'plain', 'name', 'who', 'airline', 'pilots', 'union', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'scenes', 'was', 'Then', 'have', 'Goodman', 'who', 'hilarious', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Harling', 'Mays', 'What', 'loved', 'Goodman', 'character', 'other', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'was', 'provided', 'just', 'enough', 'comic', 'relief', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'emotional', 'burden', 'serious', 'topic', 'little', 'spice', 'comedy', 'scattered', 'allows', 'enjoy', 'story', 'leaving', 'depressed.Overall', 'Score', '8/10', 'say', 'Flight', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'went', 'expecting', 'one', 'thing', 'instead', 'was', 'given', 'very', 'powerful', 'story', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'dependency', 'Denzel', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'bring', 'just', 'character', 'life', 'Couple', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'hard', 'not', 'recommend', 'Flight', 'grew', 'up', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'dealt', 'same', 'issues', 'are', 'addressed', 'film', 'Still', 'understand', 'not', 'everyone', 'have', 'time', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'give', 'chance']",Flight Combo

1609090,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B00AF6B22E,J. SHARP,"[0, 0]","This is the first live-action film Zemeckis has directed since ""Cast Away"" in 2000. Like that film, it has a huge, edge-of-your-seat plane crash scene then becomes a two-hour character study. The trailer makes you think it's either an action-packed rage-against-the-system flick or a courtroom drama. It's neither, although it has elements of those. It's really more like ""Lost Weekend"" or ""Clean and Sober.""The airplane is a metaphor for its pilot, William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a functional alcoholic who is privately crashing during a time when he is publicly flying high as a national hero. Whip coolly and inventively landed the defective airliner, saving most of the 102 souls aboard. But it's discovered that he was legally drunk when the accident occured. Can he come out of his nose-dive before he loses the one soul aboard his personal flight?Washington's tremendous skill and intense humanity keep you invested in Whip but it's not easy. Whip - as addicts often do - gets increasingly repugnant as the story progresses and the movie dares you to keep caring about him no matter how bad he gets. Kelly Reilly (Dr. Watson's wife in the current Sherlock Holmes movies) also does a terrific, natural job here as a fellow addict/love interest who wants to get sober.The film poses many questions about God's role in tragedy and accidents, his help in self-control, the efficacy of prayer, and predestination. Christian symbols appear throughout the film. Some of the questions are taken very seriously, some not.It also keeps you in a very tense, emotional Catch-22 between definitely wanting Whip to be absolved for this particular crash, for which he was not responsible and in which he acted heroically, and definitely wanting to see him be held accountable for his long history of flying drunk.Some conservative viewers may admire the film's message but may not be able to sit through its very graphic and realistic content.",4,Plane and Sober,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1949,"['first', 'live-action', 'film', 'Zemeckis', 'directed', 'Cast', 'Away', '2000', 'film', 'huge', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'plane', 'crash', 'scene', 'then', 'two-hour', 'character', 'study', 'trailer', 'think', 'action-packed', 'rage-against-the-system', 'flick', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'elements', 'really', 'more', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Clean', 'Sober', 'airplane', 'metaphor', 'pilot', 'William', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'functional', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'privately', 'crashing', 'time', 'when', 'publicly', 'flying', 'high', 'national', 'hero', 'Whip', 'coolly', 'inventively', 'landed', 'defective', 'airliner', 'saving', 'most', '102', 'souls', 'aboard', 'discovered', 'was', 'legally', 'drunk', 'when', 'accident', 'occured', 'Can', 'come', 'nose-dive', 'one', 'soul', 'personal', 'flight', 'Washington', 'tremendous', 'skill', 'intense', 'humanity', 'keep', 'invested', 'Whip', 'not', 'easy', 'Whip', 'addicts', 'often', 'do', 'increasingly', 'repugnant', 'story', 'movie', 'keep', 'caring', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'Dr.', 'Watson', 'wife', 'current', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'movies', 'also', 'terrific', 'natural', 'job', 'here', 'fellow', 'addict/love', 'interest', 'who', 'get', 'sober.The', 'film', 'poses', 'many', 'questions', 'God', 'role', 'tragedy', 'accidents', 'help', 'self-control', 'efficacy', 'prayer', 'predestination', 'Christian', 'symbols', 'appear', 'film', 'questions', 'are', 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'not.It', 'also', 'very', 'tense', 'emotional', 'Catch-22', 'definitely', 'wanting', 'Whip', 'be', 'absolved', 'particular', 'crash', 'was', 'not', 'responsible', 'acted', 'heroically', 'definitely', 'wanting', 'see', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'long', 'history', 'flying', 'drunk.Some', 'conservative', 'viewers', 'may', 'admire', 'film', 'message', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'very', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'content']",Flight Combo

1609099,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B00AF6B22E,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[4, 6]","""Flight"" is about Denzel Washington, the actor who has taken chances, proved himself worthy, and now accepts all kinds of roles. Playing an alcoholic and becoming that person convincingly highlights once again Denzel's exceptional talent. I've always been a fan.That said, I must include in my positive things these negatives:1. I don't like it one bit that he is showing signs of aging. He can't help it, none of us can, but I want to remember him as that beautiful man he was when he was young. I am being totally unreasonable, but there it is.2. My biggest objection is also questionable. In my memory Denzel has never had a relationship onscreen with a white woman. He does this time. She is also half his age, but then again, her race and age are irrelevant to the arrogant, obnoxious dude he plays. Being a player is part of who he is only as it reflects his addictions to both drugs and alcohol. In a movie from his younger years he plays a sheriff in Haiti who has a brief affair with a white woman. The test audience, or the black women in that audience, were incensed and the film maker changed that part of the film to a black woman. I think, here in this film, he had to break with his tradition because that is what his character would have done. So, I guess I say kudos now.3. I did not realize the film was about addiction. Not my favorite subject. A personal dislike. Also unfair to the film.What I did like about the film:1. Denzel's acting. He is completely convincing as an addict. Completely.2. The addiction is dealt with in a fair way.3. Two lines are memorable and will be repeated as such: He tells his paramour: ""I chose to drink. I chose to drink"" even in face of losing each person in turn in his life. Bravado, false. Braggadocio, false. But still a line memorably shouted. The second line almost makes hair stand up on one's arms: ""Who are you?"" To give it in context would be a spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.This is a review about Denzel, my man. Others have written excellent reviews about theme and events. I'll stick with Denzel because he does redemption like no other.Oh yes, the title. It's obvious: a flight goes down. However, the pilot, loaded on drugs and alcohol, miraculously lands it. He's a hero, but not a hero. What takes flight is the symbolism behind the title. Flight. Flying. Freedom.

While Whip may be a great pilot he's a human being with a lot of problems that take up as much room in his life as his heroism.Washington's Whitaker is a pilot who we seem from the outset has a lot of problems in his life, an ex-wife, a drinking problem, and a bit of cocaine habit which all might not be so bad if he weren't an airline pilot about to board a flight he's piloting.The flight starts off rocky, Whitaker takes off through a rainstorm and powers through it to clear air, with a bit of lying to the control tower about what he's doing, the rest of the flight is uneventful until the plane starts to malfunction and to save the plane he flies it inverted before flip it back and landing in a field with only minimal deaths onboard. The rest of the movie deals with how Whitaker deals with his problems and his addictions as its discovered that he was drunk at the time of the crash and the NTSB hearing looms ever closer and jail time is the outcome if he's found negligent.Washington has one of his best performances in ""Flight"" it's a low key and understated performance and most of it is realized in Whitakers attitude as he moves through the ordeal from a confident and cocky pilot, to a man worried about his future and he tries to influence the testimony of the crew on the airplane, Margaret (Tamara Tunie) and his co-pilot (Brian Gerahty). John Goodman puts in a flamboyant performance as Whitaker's on-call drug dealer and he almost steals the show with a performance that should be over the top but isn't. Kelly Reilly has a great role as Nicole, a heroin addict who moves in with Whitaker but can't take his addictions and denial.The songs played on the soundtrack are kind of an obvious telegraphing what's going on, but one intriguing aspect was the heartbeat played at appropriate moments.""Flight"" is the kind of movie made to highlight good performances, everything from the special effects to the acting to serves to make a poignant and powerful film.",5,Portrait of a Hero...and a Man,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,2092,"['Moments', 'make', 'heroes', 'not', 'lifetimes', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performance', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'Flight', 'Whip', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'pilot', 'human', 'being', 'lot', 'problems', 'take', 'up', 'as', 'much', 'room', 'life', 'heroism.Washington', 'Whitaker', 'pilot', 'who', 'seem', 'outset', 'lot', 'problems', 'life', 'ex-wife', 'drinking', 'problem', 'bit', 'cocaine', 'habit', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'airline', 'pilot', 'board', 'flight', 'piloting.The', 'flight', 'rocky', 'Whitaker', 'off', 'rainstorm', 'powers', 'clear', 'air', 'bit', 'lying', 'control', 'tower', 'what', 'doing', 'rest', 'flight', 'uneventful', 'plane', 'malfunction', 'save', 'plane', 'inverted', 'flip', 'back', 'landing', 'field', 'only', 'minimal', 'deaths', 'onboard', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'how', 'Whitaker', 'deals', 'problems', 'addictions', 'discovered', 'was', 'drunk', 'time', 'crash', 'NTSB', 'hearing', 'ever', 'closer', 'jail', 'time', 'outcome', 'found', 'negligent.Washington', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Flight', 'low', 'key', 'understated', 'performance', 'most', 'realized', 'Whitakers', 'attitude', 'ordeal', 'confident', 'cocky', 'pilot', 'man', 'worried', 'future', 'influence', 'testimony', 'crew', 'airplane', 'Margaret', 'Tamara', 'Tunie', 'co-pilot', 'Brian', 'Gerahty', 'John', 'Goodman', 'flamboyant', 'performance', 'Whitaker', 'on-call', 'drug', 'dealer', 'almost', 'show', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'top', ""n't"", 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'great', 'role', 'Nicole', 'heroin', 'addict', 'who', 'Whitaker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'addictions', 'denial.The', 'songs', 'played', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'kind', 'obvious', 'telegraphing', 'what', 'going', 'one', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'was', 'heartbeat', 'played', 'appropriate', 'moments', 'Flight', 'kind', 'movie', 'made', 'highlight', 'good', 'performances', 'everything', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'serves', 'make', 'poignant', 'powerful', 'film']",Flight Combo

Side note, I seriously have no idea why half the audience gasped at this scene in the film. Read the freaking rating. Flight is rated R for a bunch of reasons, one of them being nudity. Nudity means private parts, like boobs and butts, and sometimes genitals, so don't be surprised when you see that in the movie. The film continues to follow the life of Whip Whitaker, pilot and alcoholic. Whip leads the fast life of drugs, booze, and sex, and it catches up to him when a routine flight goes wrong. This film focuses on his addiction to alcohol and how it destroys his life and those around him. I really liked the man vs. self theme in this film, as well as how Whip is his own worst enemy. Whip is the only thing holding himself back from moving on with his life and reconnecting with his ex wife and son. Some critics say this is Denzel's best film. I would argue there are much better films he has been in, but his performance here is still nothing short of fantastic, as always.I had a lot of issues with this film. A lot of the characters aren't likable (especially the lead) which makes it difficult to have any real moral compass in a film that lacks any moral center whatsoever. Plagued with lies, drinking to excess, and an almost abusive father figure, Whip is not a very likable character. Even his girlfriend gets annoying. I didn't like John Goodman either, even though it seemed like most of the audience did. My biggest issue with this film is one scene that features Whip's attorney and NTSD buddy helping him cover up that he's drunk by doing cocaine. This seemed extremely far fetched and silly, and it took away from the serious tone of the film.Flight takes off because of Denzel Washington's fine performance as an alcoholic and unrepentant liar, but doesn't quite level off because of some silly scenes that make what could've been a great film a good one.

1609148,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AF6B22E,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 20]","I know that some viewers might feel like there is a bit of a bait-and-switch when sitting down to watch the very adult drama ""Flight."" I was primed to see a movie about a harrowing plane crash. And indeed, this initiating sequence is staged with tremendous suspense and gut wrenching detail. It may be one of the more memorable scenes you are likely to see this year. But ""Flight"" is not really about this crash. It is, instead, a character study about addiction, about faith, and about taking responsibility. The heroic pilot that acted on that day is none other than Denzel Washington. But this is no ordinary hero, this is a mess of a man who fuels his life with drugs and drink. He is estranged from his family, defying propriety, and thinks that the rules don't apply to him. He's a great pilot, to be sure, that saved many souls. But he was also completely out of control when he did so. That is the moral dilemma at the heart of the movie. He is a hero. His bad acts did not cause the accident. And yet, he will still be cast in a villainous light if the truth emerges.There are very few movies I go to these days where I really don't know what to anticipate. ""Flight"" started out in a completely unexpected way. We meet Washington right after a night of heavy drink and sex with a flight attendant. You know he shouldn't be flying, you know that tragedy is inevitable (if from the previews, if nothing else). But just as you are settling in, the movie takes us on a ninety degree tangent. We are than spending time with a junkie (Kelly Reilly) as she attempts to score her next fix. I was genuinely confused by this digression. Washington and Reilly split screen time during the opening scenes and fate will bring them together in the hospital. For the remainder of the movie, Reilly actively tries to rebuild her world while Washington struggles mightily to maintain the illusion of his normality. As the consequences of his addiction rise before him, Washington continues to back pedal. As a trial looms, will Washington pull it together? Will he ever be honest with himself?At the center of ""Flight"" is a handful of strong and interesting performances. Without a doubt, this is one of Washington's finest roles. Even those that may not love the film itself would have to see the complexity, despair AND strength in this multi-layered character. But director Robert Zemekis (Oscar winner for the more fanciful Forrest Gump) has assembled a first rate cast to back up this bravura leading man. Don Cheadle displays a brash assuredness as Washington's attorney, Bruce Greenwood is earnest and supportive as an important ally, and John Goodman is over-the-top but effective as his drug hook-up. In smaller roles, Tamara Tunie, Nadine Velazquez, and Brian Geraghty all score pivotal moments as members of the flight crew on that fateful day. And then we have Reilly. The British actress is given an extremely meaty role as a ravaged soul fighting her way to salvation.As an addiction drama, ""Flight"" is an in-your-face and provocative illustration of a man in denial. The movie also looks at faith in a way few studio films do. I appreciated that the movie (and its screenplay by John Gatins) doesn't shy away from complex issues. It is more thoughtful, more contemplative than you might initially be aware of. I'm not sure, in the end, that I believed some of the final moments and decisions. But in many ways, this was more about the journey than the destination. As long as you aren't expecting an action movie, ""Flight"" has a lot to recommend it. It isn't perfect, but this contemplative drama will give you a lot to think about. And it also boasts a slew of terrific performances.

But as the investigation of the crash unfolds, it's clear that the truth is closing in on him, as he continues to drink to excess and to deny it whenever he can. How he eventually faces up to this does make for some dramatic moments, and Denzel is brilliant, as are all the supporting cast.

He chose to stay on faces, floors and eyeballs for a really long and inappropriate (and sometimes obnoxious) amounts of time. His direction seemed very dull and not as dynamic as most of his other films. It wasn't a fun film to look at, although definitely an interesting subject.The shining points of this film was definitely the performance of Denzel Washington (Unstoppable, Safe House) and his honest portrayal of a man who is a true alcoholic. He is real, he is direct with his intent and most of all you understand the angst of what an alcoholic does to hide his addiction.What makes this film a little different was the fact that this was a pilot of a major commercial airline who saves a plane from crashing while under the influence of over double the legal limit in his blood of an average alcoholic. And yes, he saves the plane in some fantastic flying maneuvering and incredible special effects.Written by John Gatins (Real Steel, Coach Carter) who gave a great series of good scenes and monologues to Denzel, he just didn't fill in the gaps too well, because it was slow and dragging throughout most of the film to the point of boredom.Other stand out performances included Bruce Greenwood ( Star Trek 2009, I, Robot) as the union rep that was sent to defend Denzel's character in order to keep him from going on trial for negligence. Bruce is always sharp and direct in his performances which complimented Denzel in many ways.Don Cheadle (Crash, Iron man 2) also chimes in with a good performance as the lawyer that has to keep Denzel out of jail. Don and Bruce together really understand the issues and compassions that this pilot is going through but also know their job maybe too much to handle.Another noticeably weird, yet extremely humorous performances came from none other than John Goodman (Flintstones, The Artist) who must have had a blast has the hippie who deals in drugs and cures for anyone who has an addiction of any kind. John was giving it his all but overall the character didn't seem to fit the film for me.Overall the film is very slow. Not a lot of camera movement and other than the performances mentioned, when they are performing, it was an interesting movie.

That said, the story line of this movie was exceptional.  It gave you a brief glimpse into the life of an alcoholic, and many of the issues that are associated with this very real DISEASE.  This statement is kind of a ""Spoiler Alert"", but what was the most striking scene in the movie (for me)was the one where the character is looking at the nips in the fridge. He's made up his mind not to drink anymore. He's serious! He's not playing this time... everything is riding on this pivotal moment... and then the demon takes over... He's helpless to resist it, and so... he gives himself over to it... and the fall of it was great. Addiction is exactly like that. People often wonder, ""...why don't they just quit?!"" But what they don't understand is, it is not as easy as that.

It ultimately is a story of addiction, denial, loss and redemption.Director Robert Zemeckis artfully guides a powerhouse cast in an uncompromising portrait of a man refusing to admit his addiction, regardless of the collateral damage.  Oscar winning Denzel Washington is deservedly nominated again this year for his stunning portrayal of Whip, a pilot who miraculously crash lands his plane, saving 96 people but losing 6.  He is a hero until evidence emerges he was drinking and using cocaine the morning of the disaster.  Washington shoulders the weight of the film and gives perhaps his best performance in a totally controlled portrait of the addicted pilot.The opening crash scene is brilliantly executed and disturbing.  Denzel is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast---Don Cheadle. John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Brian Geraghty, Melissa Leo and the underappreciated Tamara Tunie (Law and Order SVU's Dr. Warner).  I liked Kelly Reilly as fellow addict Nicole, but often had trouble understanding her which diminished my appreciation of her performance.I highly recommend FLIGHT mainly on the basis of Washington's devastating performance.

However it's only about 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie you see Denzel's struggle (which he did a phenomenal job of acting). You learn in the first minute of the movie that Denzel's character clearly has a huge alcohol and drug problem. However he does the impossible he saves 100 lives while only loosing 6. No other pilot could have done what he did. However he was still drunk and high when he managed the impossible. The question in the movie is does his heroic actions eliminate the wrong of what he's done? Denzel thinks so and the movie goes on with his struggle when he won't even admit he has a problem and views himself as a hero. The true plot of the movie is truly a heart wrenching film about a man struggling with his addiction and denial.

El-Hewie""","[1, 1]","The flow of events was wisely planed, starting from few hours prior to taking off, with a pilot intoxicated with drugs, liquor, wasted in a hotel room with a hooker, burdened with his troubled son and scattered family. That setting evolved into the sequence of events that led to the airplane crash, in which the intoxicated pilot reacted with outstanding ingenuity to overcome inevitable dive crashing to the ground by rolling his airplane in order to regain lift.The very intense moments of taking off in very severe weather conditions left me thinking on whether such aggressive handling of the airplane would result in potential damage to the elevator flaps of the airplane. Even though Captain Whitaker managed to rise above the clouds, level the airplane, with apparently charismatic and heroic endeavors, it would remain ultimately unknown whether such rough handling of the airplane would have precipitated the subsequent failure.The very few intense minutes from getting into a downward dive, rolling, and undoing the rolling, to the final crash landing were very educational, dramatic, and charging the imagination of the viewer till the very end of the movie. The captain succeeded very will in announcing every step in his procedure to escape death and save lives, with impeccable coordination of his copilot and fight assistant.The legal drama that followed the crash was also engaging, reasonable, and educational. As the legal team managed to suppress legal evidence of intoxication, and the pilot started patching his life to deal with drug addiction, his broken family, attempting to start another while being treated, forensic evidence made a twist of fate when the pilot had to explain the presence of two bottle of vodka in the cockpit  disposal.The world of drugs and prostitution where the pilot relied upon as a support social net to keep mental calm would gradually collapse over his fate, leading him to prison. The one last lie which Captain Whitaker resisted making extricated him from the gloom and loss of intoxication.The end of the movie was also appropriate, with a cleaned up, sober prisoner gaining strength and lively outlook, attending to writing and reading, instead of inhaling, drinking, smoking, and fooling with strangers, responding to a visit from his son, who has resented his father for leading irresponsible lifestyle.The federal hearing and testimony of the pilot was also educational, harsh, and methodical.Well Done.Mohamed D.

Whitaker, a seasoned pilot for a regional airline. Whip is so good at what he does, that he also manages to bed one of his flight attendants (stunning Nadine Velazquez) and gets plastered the night before seemingly without consequence.Hung over as he is, he straightens out by polishing off warm beer with a couple lines of cocaine as a chaser. I don't know if that works in the real world but it does for Whip. Some of the TV ads give the impression that Whip is a hero by pulling off a Sullenberger landing maneuver (he does) but is being hounded because of a small amount of alcohol was found in his system. Make no mistake this guy was hammered and should not be flying.Still with the help of a little vodka, he manages to control a doomed airliner saving the vast majority of the passengers. Unexpectedly once the NTSB/FAA begins their investigation, Whip feels invincible and doesn't slow down. Washington performance stands out of course. He plays a realistic drunk and seems to have all the facial tics, bobs and wrinkles on full throttle. Washington gets plenty of supporting help along the way. Kelly Reilly is a reformed druggie that gets involved with Whip after a hospital meet. Brian Geraghty is Whip's born again co-pilot. Tamara Tunie is the supervising flight attendant and longtime friend. Bruce Greenwood is Whip's union chief. Melissa Leo is the lead federal investigator. Don Cheadle is his lawyer and John Goodman brings some needed comedic relief as Whip's ""Goodtime Charlie"" supplier.It all works, including the great flight scenes leading up to the crash and some well-placed rock classics.

1609394,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B00AF6B22E,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[4, 12]","I am getting tired of films and TV shows that glamourize and glorify alcohol and drug abuse.  This does both.  The film centers around Captain Whip Whitman (played by Denzel) who miraculously crash lands a jetliner that suddenly starts to nosedive.  Before the plane takes off we see the Captain drinking and taking cocaine. Now the important thing is that the drug and alcohol abuse has nothing to do with the plane crash.After the plane crash the movie crashes. After the crash, Whip rids his life of alchol.  This is a great series of scenes where he goes through his grandfather's farmhouse (which he owns but is trying to sell) and starts by flushing his pain killers down the toilet and then bottle after bottle and six pack after six pack.  It appears that Whip is going to straighten out his life.  But then the film starts down the wrong road.  Whip goes to a meeting with his friend, now working for the pilot's union.  When he gets there he finds a lawyer (wonderfully played by Don Cheadle) and is told that there is a drug and alcohol report that states he was three times over the legal limit for alcohol and he tested positive for cocaine. If these results hold up, this means jail time.  My first thought is the film is going to be about Whip being railroaded and made the scapegoat.  But no, what next happens is he gets drunk and picks up a recovering drug adict he met in hospital (another great performance). Before the big finally, he is once again sober, its the night before his testimony before the ATSB.  He is in a hotel room, his mini bar is stocked with Coke products.  He hears a knocking.  He determines it the adjoining door.  He opens his side of the door to find the other side unlocked and he finds an empty room and a full mini bar which he proceeds to empty.  The next day, his friend and attorney buy him cocain to bring him around!  Come on without you stupid ending there would be no consequences for his actions.How can you make this worse, start making it preachy.  Whip and Nicole (Kelly Reilly) attend an AA meeting with an over the top preachy testimonial.  Then another preachy scene is when he goes to visit his co-pilot in the hospital. And it ends with when Whip has a chance to escape it all with one final lie he decides he cannot and finally tells the truth which puts him in jail.Now Denzel's performance is be hailed by many but come on its easy to play a drunk.  The better performaces come from Don Cheadle (and I am guessing many of his scenes probably wound up on the cutting room floor because he outclassed Denzel in every scene), Kelly Reilly who makes you feel that she is in love with Whip but will not let him bring her down and Tamara Tunie as the surving flight attendant who helps save the plane and then Whip.  These are the reason that I gave this film three stars and not Denzel or the script.One final note, John Goodman is one of the greatest character actors around but this performace is one of his worst.  So over the top (almost as bad as performance in A Christmas Carol at the Kodak Theatre).If you really want this film, I would say wait a few months and pick it up in the clearance bins at Big Lots.",3,Glorifying the American Drunk,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,3178,"['am', 'getting', 'tired', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'glamourize', 'glorify', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'abuse', 'film', 'centers', 'Captain', 'Whip', 'Whitman', 'played', 'Denzel', 'who', 'miraculously', 'crash', 'jetliner', 'suddenly', 'nosedive', 'plane', 'see', 'Captain', 'drinking', 'taking', 'cocaine', 'Now', 'important', 'thing', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'nothing', 'do', 'plane', 'crash.After', 'plane', 'crash', 'movie', 'crashes', 'crash', 'Whip', 'life', 'alchol', 'great', 'series', 'scenes', 'where', 'grandfather', 'farmhouse', 'trying', 'sell', 'flushing', 'pain', 'killers', 'down', 'toilet', 'then', 'bottle', 'bottle', 'six', 'pack', 'six', 'pack', 'Whip', 'going', 'straighten', 'out', 'life', 'then', 'film', 'down', 'wrong', 'road', 'Whip', 'meeting', 'friend', 'now', 'working', 'pilot', 'union', 'When', 'there', 'lawyer', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'told', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'report', 'was', 'three', 'times', 'legal', 'limit', 'alcohol', 'tested', 'positive', 'cocaine', 'results', 'hold', 'up', 'jail', 'time', 'first', 'thought', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'Whip', 'being', 'railroaded', 'made', 'scapegoat', 'what', 'next', 'happens', 'drunk', 'up', 'recovering', 'drug', 'adict', 'met', 'hospital', 'great', 'performance', 'big', 'finally', 'once', 'again', 'sober', 'night', 'testimony', 'ATSB', 'hotel', 'room', 'mini', 'bar', 'stocked', 'Coke', 'products', 'knocking', 'adjoining', 'door', 'side', 'door', 'find', 'other', 'side', 'unlocked', 'empty', 'room', 'full', 'mini', 'bar', 'empty', 'next', 'day', 'friend', 'attorney', 'buy', 'cocain', 'bring', 'around', 'Come', 'stupid', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'consequences', 'actions.How', 'can', 'make', 'worse', 'start', 'making', 'preachy', 'Whip', 'Nicole', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'attend', 'AA', 'meeting', 'top', 'preachy', 'testimonial', 'Then', 'preachy', 'scene', 'when', 'visit', 'co-pilot', 'hospital', 'when', 'Whip', 'chance', 'escape', 'one', 'final', 'lie', 'can', 'not', 'finally', 'truth', 'jail.Now', 'Denzel', 'performance', 'be', 'hailed', 'many', 'come', 'easy', 'play', 'drunk', 'better', 'performaces', 'come', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'am', 'guessing', 'many', 'scenes', 'probably', 'wound', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'outclassed', 'Denzel', 'scene', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'who', 'feel', 'love', 'Whip', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'bring', 'down', 'Tamara', 'Tunie', 'surving', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'save', 'plane', 'then', 'Whip', 'are', 'reason', 'gave', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'not', 'Denzel', 'script.One', 'final', 'note', 'John', 'Goodman', 'one', 'greatest', 'character', 'actors', 'performace', 'one', 'worst', 'So', 'top', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'performance', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Kodak', 'Theatre', '.If', 'really', 'want', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'wait', 'few', 'months', 'pick', 'up', 'clearance', 'bins', 'Big', 'Lots']",Flight Combo

So the moral of the story is that it's okay to crash the plane (as every single other pilot did in simulation) as long as you're not an addict. Got it. He did what no other pilot could do, but let's crucify him since he's an addict. Great lesson to turn out more sheep. HATED IT!  Had the drunk drug addict NOT been piloting that flight that day, everyone on that flight would be dead.  For me, End of Story.Updated my review for clarification April 2, 2013:  My problem with this movie's message is...  Crucifying someone because they went to work drunk & high, eventhough they do a better job (are a better pilot) EVEN drunk & high than most, if not all others in any condition.I understand why we have these rules and limits, because MOST people cannot function well on diminished brain function.  However, here is a pilot that not only can, but did so stupendously.  Yet, we hang him out to dry for his drug & alcohol abuse, no matter how amazing of a job he did do while on it.We have gone so far overboard on watching and enforcing measuring sticks (limits), that we have lost sight of why we put those limits in place in the first place.  He landed the plane like no other pilot was able to in the simulations.  Honestly, that's all I need to know.  I don't care if he was drunk, high, blind or ANYTHING else.Think of it like this from a documentary I saw on aging:  There is this heart surgeon out there that is amazing in his field.  But he is forced to live a lie and hide something from his patients because of the stigma put on his affliction.  This surgeon's affliction is that he is 95 years old.  On the surface, who would want a 95 year old doing anything so important?  But he is the best at what he does, nothing else should matter.  Right?  Just a thought...And that also goes along with when we hear about a fatal car accident.  The penalty is greater if the person was DUI and then THAT becomes the focus.  Why?  DUI may be the reason they caused the accident, but the end result is the same - they killed someone.  End of story.  Again, we are paying so much attention to those aids we use to identify possible trouble spots that we can't see the forest for the trees.  If an inexperienced and reckless teenager had the same fatal car accident, but was sober, the end result is the same - at fault manslaughter.  We don't crucify the teenager for being reckless or stupid or inexperienced...and shouldn't.  Crucify him for killing somebody.  Judge the end result.  Rise above your emotions.Setting ""standards"" is an aid to help us make pre-determinations on what we can reasonably expect from most people / situations.  But those ""standards"" should be merely aids or tools and NOT the final word.",1,what a let down,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,2792,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'Had', 'potential', 'became', 'afternoon', 'school', 'special', 'moral', 'story', 'okay', 'crash', 'plane', 'single', 'other', 'pilot', 'did', 'simulation', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'addict', 'Got', 'did', 'what', 'other', 'pilot', 'could', 'do', 'let', 'crucify', 'addict', 'Great', 'lesson', 'turn', 'out', 'more', 'sheep', 'HATED', 'IT', 'Had', 'drunk', 'drug', 'addict', 'NOT', 'been', 'piloting', 'flight', 'day', 'everyone', 'flight', 'would', 'be', 'dead', 'End', 'Story.Updated', 'review', 'clarification', 'April', '2', '2013', 'problem', 'movie', 'message', 'Crucifying', 'someone', 'went', 'work', 'drunk', 'high', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'are', 'better', 'pilot', 'EVEN', 'drunk', 'high', 'most', 'not', 'others', 'condition.I', 'understand', 'why', 'have', 'rules', 'limits', 'MOST', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'function', 'well', 'diminished', 'brain', 'function', 'However', 'here', 'pilot', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'did', 'so', 'stupendously', 'hang', 'out', 'dry', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'matter', 'how', 'amazing', 'job', 'did', 'do', 'it.We', 'have', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'overboard', 'watching', 'enforcing', 'measuring', 'sticks', 'limits', 'have', 'lost', 'sight', 'why', 'put', 'limits', 'place', 'first', 'place', 'landed', 'plane', 'other', 'pilot', 'was', 'able', 'simulations', 'Honestly', 'need', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'drunk', 'high', 'blind', 'ANYTHING', 'else.Think', 'documentary', 'saw', 'aging', 'heart', 'out', 'there', 'amazing', 'field', 'forced', 'live', 'lie', 'hide', 'something', 'patients', 'stigma', 'put', 'affliction', 'surgeon', 'affliction', '95', 'years', 'old', 'surface', 'who', 'would', 'want', '95', 'year', 'old', 'doing', 'anything', 'so', 'important', 'best', 'what', 'nothing', 'else', 'should', 'matter', 'Right', 'Just', 'thought', 'also', 'along', 'when', 'hear', 'fatal', 'car', 'accident', 'penalty', 'greater', 'person', 'was', 'DUI', 'then', 'THAT', 'focus', 'Why', 'DUI', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'caused', 'accident', 'end', 'result', 'same', 'killed', 'someone', 'End', 'story', 'Again', 'are', 'paying', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'aids', 'use', 'identify', 'possible', 'trouble', 'spots', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'forest', 'trees', 'inexperienced', 'reckless', 'teenager', 'had', 'same', 'fatal', 'car', 'accident', 'was', 'sober', 'end', 'result', 'same', 'fault', 'manslaughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'crucify', 'teenager', 'being', 'reckless', 'stupid', 'inexperienced', 'should', ""n't"", 'Crucify', 'killing', 'somebody', 'Judge', 'end', 'result', 'Rise', 'emotions.Setting', 'standards', 'aid', 'help', 'make', 'pre-determinations', 'what', 'can', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'most', 'people', '/', 'situations', 'standards', 'should', 'be', 'merely', 'aids', 'tools', 'NOT', 'final', 'word']",Flight Combo

This is a man whose life is figuratively, and pretty soon literally, in freefall.  The opening act of the movie is a plane crash that is both visceral and believable.. a reminder of Zemeckis the director who knows the value of special effects and how they help you tell a story.  The rest of the movie reveals a different director altogether, the director of Castaway, Forrest Gump and Contact, who understands how to reveal character and make people 3 dimensional.  After that crash, the movie's drama is all based on the character.  He is told he has to stay clean and off the booze, and his battle with that is what drives the movie forward, as the movie explores the period up to the Federal investigation hearing.  As the debris from the plane is pulled to together to investigate the crash, the movie starts to explore the wreckage that is Denzel's life.  The middle stretch of the movie is a bit baggy for sure, but it's hard to say what should have been cut, because every minute of Washington on screen is electric.  If it hadn't been for Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, I'm sure the Oscar would have been his.  A memorable scene involves him and a hotel mini-bar, in a will he-won't he moment that is wonderfully cut together and shows the director and actor in top form.  His personal flight from facing his addiction is gripping in its own way, but it's worth also mentioning a supporting cast that rise to the occasion - from Kelly Reilly as the woman he meets in hospital who tries to sober him up, to Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood his support system for the legal battle, to John Goodman his supplier of medicinal pick-me-ups and source of most of the movies few laughs, there isn't a wrong step.There are plenty of ideas explored here, about relationships, faith as well as addiction, which stretch the running time a bit.  So yes, it's a little sluggish to be a masterpiece.  But the performances here make this a must see nonetheless, and if you have had experience with alcoholics then the lies and behaviors here will ring scarily true.

1609461,A237RLQXTL55RG,B00AF6B22E,off the tropic,"[3, 5]","Robert Zemeckis's ""Flight"" is one of the standout films of the year. This absorbing and unique story of a pilot fighting his addictions is another brilliant showcase for Denzel's Washington's talent. It is heartening to see Denzel Washington getting better at his craft with age. The aura of this veteran actor still transcends the movies he is in, and as much as he effortlessly repeats this in Flight the brilliant direction and story is a worthy complement to his performance as ace pilot Whip Whittaker, who runs into bad weather, literally and figuratively.Flight's writer, John Gatins, an unpretentious and upcoming talent who penned the imaginative, underrated, Real Steel with Hugh Jackman from early 2012, proves that he is only beginning to find his Hollywood muse. Flight is similarly entertaining, but it is much heavier on serious drama. It is that curious mix of old fashioned big budget entertainment and intimate involving drama focusing on human foibles leading to tragic consequences.Robert Zemeckis is one of the least self-indulgent directors working in Hollywood. He is a master of light-hearted, entertaining fare, for kids and adults alike, in the best tradition of Hollywood films -  Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future - being proofs of his great sense for spectacle and storytelling. But he has also made big mainstream movies with remarkable emotional power  and seriousness that has stood the test of time - Contact and Castaway, being notable examples.With Flight he has proved once again that he is also a master of this more serious fare that instructs and delights. Much of his effectiveness in making big budget films that turn into lyrical, intimate dramas, stems from his remarkable eye for casting, and his ability to hire great actors and leave them alone to find new directions in performance they have not gone before. As such, he seems to be that rare example of an action director who is also an actor's director, a great collaborator with the actors he has chosen for his title roles. One hopes there is more to come from the Washington-Zemeckis collaboration in the future because Washington, like Zemeckis, has broken new ground.Seeing Denzel Washington play the tortured role of Whip Whittaker to perfection in ""Flight"" got me thinking of his acting talent once again. He plays the victor and the vanquished with his characteristic pathos and honesty. The ups and downs of Whip's life are relentless and the chaos in Whip's life is hard to watch only because Washington gives his all in a precise and controlled performance. It takes a good deal of serenity, paradoxical as this may sound, in an actor to convincingly portray extremes of self-loathing and self-confidence on screen without it all floundering clumsily into messy melodrama.

This film can be ranked up there with the best of the best, with one caveat: The subject matter of the film is raw and intense. In fact, it is the theme that makes it shine as a movie of timeless value.Robert Zemeckis is the producer/director of this film and you will remember him for movies like Cast Away, Forest Gump, and Back To The Future. However, this movie deals with a far more serious topic which I will not spoil in this review therefore, Flight is quite a bit more intense than his previous works. If you are a very conservative person, there may be aspects of this film that will be uncomfortable for you such as; the script/dialog is quite ""in your face"" as it were. With that said, you may want to read some spoilers so that you know what you are getting into, the material is not family oriented, this is not Forest Gump.I am convinced that if you have little or no previous knowledge about this production and you just get it and watch it, you too with be floored, as it can be a very profound experience. It is the humanity, the culture, the sociology that gives this work its power.Much like other movies such as The Game, The Edge, Seven Pounds, The Village, there is meaning to be gleaned from the greatness of the story. Do yourself a favor and purchase it ""sight unseen"" as the old saying goes and I am confident that you will not only be glad you did, you will understand exactly why I suggest this so strongly.

Denzel Washington plays a pilot with a serious drug and alcohol problem who nevertheless manages to guide a plane smoothly through some serious turbulance and later crash-lands it when the machine's engines fail, preventing what would have otherwise been a horrif disaster.  However, his heroic efforts are forgotten when a blood test taken while he was unconscious in the hospital after the crash shows that he had been drinking and doing drugs before takeoff.  Now faced with the very real possibility of losing and going to prison, Washington turns to his friend, a union representative played by Bruce Greenwood, and an attorney played by Don Cheadle to get him out of this mess while still keeping in touch with his friend, a drug dealer played by John Goodman (a likable drug dealer...who'd have thought...)  Along the way, Washington's character, who has one marriage already behind him, meets a recovering addict played by Kelly Reilly who has her own demons to deal with.  This film succeeds largely because we can be drawn in by Denzel Washington's performance of a man we can't exactly like but nonetheless want to root for.  All the cast work together nicely even when their characters don't and this film isn't the crash it portrays.  It's definetely worth watching.

1609556,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00AF6B22E,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","I have been meaning to watch this movie for a long time.  What held me back is that most of the people would describe this film as a story about one man's fight with his addiction(s) to alchohol and drugs.  Once I saw the film, I found that for me personally, this movie is far more than that.  It is a story about a man with intelligence and talent.  As successful as he is in his profession, his personal life is in shambles.  He cares about his personal life, his marriage, his wife and child, but it seems that differences and divisions are so deeply seated between all of them that reconciliation of any kind is impossible.  Any human being can identify with the pain of loosing someone we love dearly and not being able to do anything about making things right again.  Everything seems to get in a way: job, family members, cruelties of everyday life itself.  And when pain becomes unbearable, people turn to ways of making that emotional pain more managable.This particular story is a a story about a pilot.  In his job, he is responsible for lives and safety of both his passengers and his crew.  He is deeply aware of it and in  his own mind he finds the best way possible to reconcile his personal failures and shortcomings with self medication by combining alchohol and drugs.  As faith will have it one day acident happens.  This accident is not entirely his fault but the main character (played by Denzel Washington) is ""found out"" to be under influence of drugs and alchohol while on duty.  There is too much at stake: financially, legally and ethically.  Can a slick Chicago lawyer (played by Don Cheadle) rescue this pilot and his union and shift the blame on plane manufacturer?  Can this case be won on technicality and what is the price for that?This is where I found film to get its full value.  At the cruicial moment, when all of this can be put side and pilot can walk away free simply by following technicality of the investigative (not even legal) proceedings, his true self comes out.  Behind all addictions and pain there is a decent human being, honest and kind - willing to take a full responsibility for events that took place on himself even though techncially he is not at fault.  He is willing to sacrifice everything and even go to jail in order to preserve dignity and integrity of another human being he cares about.  In spite of all of his weaknesses this man is a hero - because he follows his own convictions and is own moral code.  By the time story comes to its end we learn to respect him and what he stands for.

I rate movies based on whether the movie was good enough to talk about after the movie ends. It was. My family enjoyed it and did sit on their edge of their seat during much of the movie. The movie scenes were artfully done. The movie grabbed you from the very beginning scenes and then kept your interest  through to the end because the plot was well planned and scripted. No fluff, no filler to extend the time of the movie. All scenes had a purpose. Although it did keep you in suspense much of the time, it left no unanswered questions at the end of the movie..This movie did stimulate discussions after it ended. This lasted for days. The movie gives you an in your face realization and reminder that ALL people are human and may very likely have shortfalls, or in this case, addictions and relationship issues, that can and does affect their performance when doing their job, and will quite likely affect many people as well. The character was thought provoking, and brought up many conversations regarding other areas of life long after the movie was over, i.e. What did your surgeon do in the 24 hours before he performed surgery on you?? Does your Doctor have his mind on you during your medical visit, is he/she prescribing you a medication without justification, has he/she slept at all in the last day or so?? Did the bus driver have a fight with his wife before leaving for work, becoming very upset and therefore he's unable to keep his mind on his driving?? When you put your life in a professional's hands, how does their life issues affect their ability to perform their job??I could not find any reason to give this movie less than 5 stars. Lastly, Denzel Washington gave a stellar performance and was exceptionally believable in his performance of the different affects of an addicted person during a 24 hour period. As an RN, I would have had a hard time believing Denzel was under the influence at times during the movie; much like a real addict, Denzel was a functional addict in the character he portrayed; this is as close to real life as you can get and this occurs among people in all walks of life.I would recommend this movie as being very good entertainment. If you study the actor's character, their individual moralities and consequent actions  become well evident due to their character's development being well written into the script.

""Ginger Vitus""","[4, 6]","Let's begin with the obvious... you probably won't find this film on the list of choices for in-flight movies the next time you ""fly the friendly skies"".We've come to expect great performances from Denzel Washington and his flawed character in ""Flight"" does not disappoint. His portrayal of ""Whip"" Whitaker, a skilled veteran pilot battling his demons via booze and blow, is believable and near brilliant. From the first scene it is obvious he has issues. And as the film progresses, layer after layer is of his chaotic life is exposed. After painting himself into a corner, Washington's character must make a life altering decision. And it is this journey that's the subject of the film. It's a movie about choices, and how one man finds redemption, if not peace, by shelving his denial and taking personal responsibility, but not without great sacrifice.As is abundantly clear in most of his roles, Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker has the gift of cool. Even as all hell is breaking loose at 20,000 feet, he has the skill to do the impossible and at the same time displays the forethought to tell crew member Tamara Tunie's character: ""...Tell your son that you love him. Remember the black box. Tell him how much you love him"". He does all this without a wink's worth of sleep the night before, assisted only by a rookie first officer, a couple of lines of coke and an in-flight vodka screwdriver. And all without breaking a sweat.Anyone who has dealt with issues related to substance abuse should be able to identify with Washington's character. The at-times feelings of invincibility and highs that often result in the lowest of lows. Capable in the face of disaster, Whip's impairment plays a role in his greatest triumph and is responsible for his personal destruction. He eventually redeems himself at great personal loss and it is this transformation from denial to acceptance that makes his performance so compelling. Denzel Washington has never looked more human than he does in ""Flight"".Not to be overlooked, director Robert Zemeckis returned from his 12 year hiatus without missing a beat. His vision of the roller coaster that is Whitaker's life is well planned and transferred to the screen with the skill of an artisan. As is the case with Washington, Zemeckis can be counted on to deliver the goods whenever his name is on the marquee.Good supporting performances by John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Kelly Reilly, Don Cheadle, and Tamara Tunie.""Flight"" is worth the price of a ticket.",4,Denzel bares all when he brings his baggage to work.,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,2501,"['Let', 'begin', 'obvious', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'list', 'choices', 'in-flight', 'movies', 'next', 'time', 'fly', 'friendly', 'skies', '.We', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'great', 'performances', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'flawed', 'character', 'Flight', 'not', 'disappoint', 'portrayal', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'skilled', 'veteran', 'pilot', 'battling', 'demons', 'booze', 'blow', 'believable', 'near', 'brilliant', 'first', 'scene', 'obvious', 'issues', 'film', 'layer', 'layer', 'chaotic', 'life', 'exposed', 'painting', 'corner', 'Washington', 'character', 'must', 'make', 'life', 'altering', 'decision', 'journey', 'subject', 'film', 'movie', 'choices', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'redemption', 'not', 'peace', 'shelving', 'denial', 'taking', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'not', 'great', 'sacrifice.As', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'most', 'roles', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'gift', 'cool', 'Even', 'hell', 'breaking', 'loose', '20,000', 'feet', 'skill', 'do', 'impossible', 'same', 'time', 'forethought', 'tell', 'crew', 'member', 'Tamara', 'Tunie', 'character', 'Tell', 'son', 'love', 'Remember', 'black', 'box', 'Tell', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'wink', 'worth', 'sleep', 'night', 'assisted', 'only', 'rookie', 'first', 'officer', 'couple', 'lines', 'coke', 'in-flight', 'vodka', 'screwdriver', 'breaking', 'sweat.Anyone', 'who', 'dealt', 'issues', 'related', 'substance', 'abuse', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'Washington', 'character', 'at-times', 'feelings', 'invincibility', 'highs', 'often', 'result', 'lowest', 'lows', 'Capable', 'face', 'disaster', 'Whip', 'impairment', 'role', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'responsible', 'personal', 'destruction', 'eventually', 'great', 'personal', 'loss', 'transformation', 'denial', 'acceptance', 'performance', 'so', 'compelling', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'human', 'Flight', '.Not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'returned', '12', 'year', 'hiatus', 'missing', 'beat', 'vision', 'roller', 'coaster', 'Whitaker', 'life', 'well', 'planned', 'transferred', 'screen', 'skill', 'artisan', 'case', 'Washington', 'Zemeckis', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'deliver', 'goods', 'whenever', 'name', 'marquee.Good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Tamara', 'Tunie', 'Flight', 'price', 'ticket']",Flight Combo
1609601,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00AF6B22E,RMurray847,"[7, 10]","FLIGHT is a gripping & well-made movie that has far less to say than it thinks it does (I felt much the same about CLOUD ATLAS...only that movie's ""point"" was even more mundane considering the effort spent in making it).  Robert Zemeckis is a consistently solid director, pushing technical boundaries and giving us complex characters.  Whether BACK TO THE FUTURE or CAST AWAY (to name just a couple), he knows how to make truly entertaining movies.  I've never spent a boring time in one of his films.  But FLIGHT is clearly reaching to do more than entertain, and this is where it fell short.  I was WELL entertained, but not terribly enlightened.Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is a pilot who apparently frequently comes to work drunk.  He's a ""functional"" alcoholic, but we meet him shortly before his next flight, and get a quick sense of how much booze and cocaine he is pouring into his system.  But flying is so second-nature to him that he's not having any issues flying safely.  But on THIS flight, things go wrong.  The plane has a colossal failure and begins to plummet to the ground.  Whitaker executes an amazing maneuver (I won't spoil it for you in case you haven't seen the trailer for the film), and brings the plane down in spectacular fashion.  (Zemeckis never skimps on the effects in his films).  Whitaker is injured, and when he awakens in the hospital, he discovers he is a national hero.There's also the uncomfortable fact that the routine blood-alcohol test that was run on him while he was out shows he was enormously drunk.  I don't remember the exact number, but it was something like 0.24 (about 3 times the normal legal level).  There is no doubt he was not operating optimally.  There is no doubt that no one else could have brought the plane down safely.  There is little doubt that the fact that the plane failed at all had NOTHING to do with ""pilot error.""Essentially, the film is an exploration of alcoholism.  Whitaker is a ""deep"" alcoholic.  His private life has been destroyed by his drinking.  He is enabled by co-workers who see what a great pilot he is.  And during this crisis, he is aided in hiding his affliction because the consequences of discovery by the world at large are pretty heft for the pilot's union, the airline, etc.  We get many chances to see Whitaker drinking a great deal.  And we watch the evolution of his character...his journey to the realization that he is an alcoholic.This subject has been explored MANY times before.  There is no question that Washington gives one of the most powerful modern depictions of the ravages of alcohol & drug abuse.  It's certainly one of his best performances in a career full of them, because he is well and truly the star of the film.  Lots of close-ups.  Lots of scenes with JUST Washington in them...and he commands them all.  He is never to be over-shadowed (except in a couple of amusing scenes with John Goodman as his old friend and supplier).  Certainly the psychological journey he goes through is compelling viewing.But FLIGHT tries to overlay this journey onto the much grander story of the plane crash.  It APPEARS to be morally or ethically complex, but it really isn't.  Stripped away of all the legal maneuverings and NTSB investigations...it's the story of an alcoholic.  There is no question that Whitaker's actions were heroic...and there is no question that this man is a danger to himself and others.  The only ethical conflict, really, is the fact that the viewer is inclined to root for this guy to ""get away with it"" because we've spent so much quality time with him.  So one could argue we are complicit in the attempt to enable Whitaker vicariously...but frankly, when you've got an actor as charismatic as Washington, how can you not want things to work out for him?  I hardly felt my conscience stirring because I was somehow crossing my fingers for him.However, let me say again that the film (despite this serious shortcoming, or overreaching, if you will) is highly entertaining.  Washington is great.  Goodman is hilarious.  Don Cheadle is extremely compelling in his small role.  Bruce Greenwood does solid work.  And best of all in the supporting cast is the relatively unknown Kelly Reilly as a heroin addict who forms a nice, textured relationship with Washington.  Their scenes are probably the best in the film.  The movie is well-paced, often quite tense, frequently quite funny and technically immaculate.  I give it 4 stars, because it is solid & stolid entertainment.  The missing star is for the failed attempt to force something onto this already good story that simply isn't there.",4,A gripping and well-built film that falls just a little short.,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,4626,"['FLIGHT', 'gripping', 'well-made', 'movie', 'far', 'less', 'say', 'felt', 'much', 'same', 'CLOUD', 'ATLAS', 'only', 'movie', 'point', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'mundane', 'considering', 'effort', 'spent', 'making', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'consistently', 'solid', 'director', 'pushing', 'technical', 'boundaries', 'giving', 'complex', 'characters', 'Whether', 'BACK', 'TO', 'THE', 'FUTURE', 'CAST', 'AWAY', 'name', 'just', 'couple', 'how', 'make', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'never', 'spent', 'boring', 'time', 'one', 'films', 'FLIGHT', 'clearly', 'reaching', 'do', 'more', 'entertain', 'where', 'fell', 'short', 'was', 'WELL', 'entertained', 'not', 'terribly', 'enlightened.Whip', 'Whitaker', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'pilot', 'who', 'apparently', 'frequently', 'work', 'drunk', 'functional', 'alcoholic', 'meet', 'shortly', 'next', 'flight', 'get', 'quick', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'booze', 'cocaine', 'pouring', 'system', 'flying', 'so', 'second-nature', 'not', 'having', 'issues', 'flying', 'safely', 'THIS', 'flight', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'plane', 'colossal', 'failure', 'plummet', 'ground', 'Whitaker', 'amazing', 'maneuver', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'film', 'plane', 'down', 'spectacular', 'fashion', 'Zemeckis', 'never', 'effects', 'films', 'Whitaker', 'injured', 'when', 'hospital', 'national', 'hero.There', 'also', 'uncomfortable', 'fact', 'routine', 'blood-alcohol', 'test', 'was', 'run', 'was', 'out', 'was', 'enormously', 'drunk', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exact', 'number', 'was', 'something', '0.24', '3', 'times', 'normal', 'legal', 'level', 'doubt', 'was', 'not', 'operating', 'optimally', 'doubt', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'plane', 'down', 'safely', 'little', 'doubt', 'fact', 'plane', 'failed', 'had', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'pilot', 'error', 'Essentially', 'film', 'exploration', 'alcoholism', 'Whitaker', 'deep', 'alcoholic', 'private', 'life', 'been', 'destroyed', 'drinking', 'enabled', 'co-workers', 'who', 'see', 'what', 'great', 'pilot', 'crisis', 'aided', 'hiding', 'affliction', 'consequences', 'discovery', 'world', 'large', 'are', 'pretty', 'heft', 'pilot', 'union', 'airline', 'etc', 'get', 'many', 'chances', 'see', 'Whitaker', 'drinking', 'great', 'deal', 'watch', 'evolution', 'character', 'journey', 'realization', 'alcoholic.This', 'subject', 'been', 'explored', 'MANY', 'times', 'before', 'question', 'Washington', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'modern', 'depictions', 'ravages', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'abuse', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'full', 'well', 'truly', 'star', 'film', 'Lots', 'close-ups', 'Lots', 'scenes', 'JUST', 'Washington', 'never', 'be', 'over-shadowed', 'couple', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'John', 'Goodman', 'old', 'friend', 'supplier', 'Certainly', 'psychological', 'journey', 'compelling', 'viewing.But', 'FLIGHT', 'tries', 'overlay', 'journey', 'much', 'grander', 'story', 'plane', 'crash', 'be', 'morally', 'ethically', 'complex', 'really', ""n't"", 'Stripped', 'away', 'legal', 'maneuverings', 'NTSB', 'investigations', 'story', 'alcoholic', 'question', 'Whitaker', 'actions', 'were', 'heroic', 'question', 'man', 'danger', 'others', 'only', 'ethical', 'conflict', 'really', 'fact', 'viewer', 'inclined', 'root', 'guy', 'get', 'away', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'quality', 'time', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'are', 'complicit', 'attempt', 'enable', 'Whitaker', 'vicariously', 'frankly', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'actor', 'as', 'charismatic', 'Washington', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'want', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'hardly', 'felt', 'conscience', 'stirring', 'was', 'somehow', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'him.However', 'let', 'say', 'again', 'film', 'serious', 'shortcoming', 'overreaching', 'will', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'Washington', 'great', 'Goodman', 'hilarious', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'small', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'solid', 'work', 'best', 'supporting', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Kelly', 'Reilly', 'heroin', 'addict', 'who', 'nice', 'textured', 'relationship', 'Washington', 'scenes', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'movie', 'well-paced', 'often', 'quite', 'tense', 'frequently', 'quite', 'funny', 'technically', 'immaculate', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'solid', 'stolid', 'entertainment', 'missing', 'star', 'failed', 'attempt', 'force', 'something', 'already', 'good', 'story', 'simply', ""n't"", 'there']",Flight Combo

Greenwood as Charlie Anderson,and many others in this nice tight cast of acting veterans and new comers.The story starts out with a bang but the rest of the film is taken up with the protagonist wrestling with both inside and outside demons.I saw this film in theatres and I knew from the get go it would elicit a variety of reactions.On one level Washington is bringing in close to an OSCAR winning performance.On the other the story,as good as it seems,works against him throughout.The story finds Denzel as a flight captain.The movie starts in a rather shocking manner as he wakes up beside,as it turns out,a good looking stewardess and snorts a line of cocaine.Off he goes to pilot a passenger plane,having some vodka and OJ along the way.Just before landing approach time,the plane runs into severe turbulence.Denzel takes the controls and the upshot is,through his amazing piloting skills,while the plane crashes in a field,only six lives are lost.Denzel lays in a hospital bed and is visited by the NTSB and his union rep.Also someone comes along(Goodman)who we at first think is quite the flamboyant friend,but turns out to be his go to drug connection.While there he meets up with a red head who also has been going through her own hell with booze and drugs.Denzel meets with the union rep and their lawyer,then the airline boss.This sends Denzel into the deep end and again he is drinking like a fish.Drunk he seeks out the redheads apartment,who it happens,is just getting kicked out.He offers his residence to crash in and and they end up closerthanthis.The investigation starts getting hot and heavy which sends Denzel heading for more drink and drugs from his pusher.This also pushes his girl friend to the limit,who leaves.Denzel has an emotional meeting with his ex and his son,who doesn't really know or want to know his alcoholic father.The union and their lawyer only can do so much,and a formal hearing is held.Time and again his union has tried to get him sober,and gets all the promises from Denzel,but he never fails to disappoint.This time,of all times,is no different.With the help of his pusher he is ""sobered"" up and attends the hearing.All Denzel has to do is lie,as he has all along,about whether or not he had been under the influence of any substances or drink that flight.His team is expecting a ""no"",but Denzel cannot take it any longer and says ""yes"".The ""hero"" pilot goes to jail.The film ends as a now sober Denzel,in the can,meets with his son and reconciles,apologizing for all the years of hurt and pain he has caused.I found the opening scene with Denzel in bed,a little ""raw"" for my taste,but I could see what the director was aiming for as far as realism goes.Then comes the titled""flight"" and it is gripping.Afterwards,the emotional ride we just experienced starts to quickly wane as Denzel recovers,then slowly but surely the film shifts its focus from pilot hero,to a drug and booze soaked man with alot of inner demons.The fact that Denzel was one of only a few who could have done what he had done gets pushed aside as Denzel spirals ever downward.The rest of the film turns into a look at the sordid life and the extremes people in Denzel's state will go to to maintain their habit/addiction.Alongside this is his girlfriend who has gone through what he has experienced too,and we watch as she is able to overcome her problems,and Denzel sinks ever deeper.The pace never changes too much as we switch back and forth between watching Denzel abuse himself,to his on off relationship with the red head and to his legal problems.This,it seems,is the films real focus,the flight was just the catalyst for the events to come.And it is a long and windy road we go down;some of it interesting,but most I found a bit ponderous,with a been there,done that feel in so far as the addiction part goes.It was just dressed up prettier.This is an approximately 2 1/2 hr.film after all.As I said in the beginning I could see a lot of divergent opinions about this.Some will concentrate just on Denzels fine performance,while others will dislike it for its pace and length.Personally I am torn,as both sides have a point,and that is why I'm falling somewhere in the middle here.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.All in all a good film but saddled with a terrible length and slow pace after the initial flight takes place.Denzel turns in a good performance but the film itself works against him,I thought, far too much.3 1/2 stars.",3,"It takes off

""Since hollywood wants to do nothin...","[0, 2]","This film struck me as a hollow (hence my review title) Oscar vehicle meant to appeal to those who have never truly dealt with people in positions in which they may benefit from their complete lack of morals. A lot to digest in one sentence? So is the naivete engaged in by the writers of this loose, wholly unrealistic film. Unfortunately, a good performance by Washington was wasted because some Hollywood writer who was obviously out of ideas, felt the need to make the character an abusive, selfish heel rather than giving his character other conflicts.SPOILER ALERT: Washington plays a narcotics-addled alcoholic airlines pilot who (after getting completely pissed & coked-up the previous night) manages to crash-land a mechanically-deficient airplane in a heroic act. That is the high point for Washington's character. As the movie progresses, you'll see his character devolve into a verbally abusive, soused, completely unappreciative (of friends and family alike) ___hole who is hailed by the media as a hero until questions arise as to his blood-alcohol level immediately after his rescue. To save time (and I'm not exaggerating) Washington's character spends the next one hour and thirty minutes in a beer and drug-induced stupor which spans literally right up to his tribunal before the FAA.The kicker? The reason why spineless syndicated reviewers hailed this weakly-conceived film as ""Powerful?"" Just as he is about to go scot-free despite being three-sheets-into-the-wind AND freshly revved on cocaine (AT the hearing, mind you), Washington's character decides to come clean and tell the truth that he was on a coke binge the previous evening before the fateful flight. That's right. His character - after almost 2 hours of repetitive unredeeming character flaws - decides to FINALLY tell the world that he was drunk AND high while piloting the airplane.Did a child write this movie? This was nothing more than typical Hollywood candy-coating and extremely weak, amateurish writing. Think of the ambitious, upper management types in your life. When faced with the option of: A) getting away with a heinous crime and being hailed as a hero, or B) admitting wrong doing when they don't have to and then going to prison - which do you think an ambitious person would choose. I pointed out ""ambitious"" people because make no mistake, had Washington's character simply lied, he would have been lauded as a hero and easily could have coasted into retirement on a book and movie deal. But, he chose prison instead?

But this movie is not far from that sort of mentality. Only it&#8217;s unlikely that &#8220;Flight&#8221; will ever achieve the status of being &#8220;campy.&#8221; Its preaching is too self-conscious. It takes a certain innocent obliviousness to produce a movie like &#8220;Reefer Madness&#8221; that becomes camp.Here the airplane pilot, played by Denzel Washington, anguishes over the fact that he was drunk and high when he maneuvered his defective airplane to a landing. So the film, intent on sending a message, sends a mixed one. The viewer is supposed to deplore the fact that Washington habitually flew his plane with at least a buzz on &#8211; and yet much of Washington&#8217;s skill seems to stem from his mind-altering indulgences.The film devolves into a commercial for AA, with a heavy dose of religiosity thrown in. When Washington wishes someone a &#8220;good day,&#8221; he is primly corrected. No, have a &#8220;blessed&#8221; day, comes the reproach. Washington, and by proxy, the audience, is made to pause to supposedly find some real meaning in this rebuke.The point of the film is not, as I thought, to take us through a crash scene investigation. The point becomes to pilot Washington into a 12-step program where he is chastened into proclaiming a mea culpa and where he is made to atone &#8211; for exactly what we&#8217;re not sure.If you want a real movie about the investigation of a plane crash to determine whether the pilot&#8217;s drinking was at fault, or whether there was some other cause of the accident, I suggest you check out the 1960&#8217;s classic &#8220;Fate is the Hunter.&#8221; Steer away from this nosedive into the drink.",2,Heavy-Handed and Illogical Preaching,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,1849,"['People', 'now', 'tend', 'laugh', '1950', '8217', 'movies', '8220', 'Reefer', 'Madness', '8221', 'made', 'reformer', '8217', 'zeal', 'impressing', 'young', 'people', 'horrors', 'drug', 'addiction', 'movie', 'not', 'far', 'sort', 'mentality', 'Only', '8217', 'unlikely', '8220', 'Flight', '8221', 'will', 'ever', 'achieve', 'status', 'being', '8220', 'campy.', '8221', 'preaching', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'certain', 'innocent', 'obliviousness', 'produce', 'movie', '8220', 'Reefer', 'Madness', '8221', 'camp.Here', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'fact', 'was', 'drunk', 'high', 'when', 'maneuvered', 'defective', 'airplane', 'landing', 'film', 'intent', 'sending', 'message', 'mixed', 'one', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'deplore', 'fact', 'Washington', 'habitually', 'flew', 'plane', 'least', 'buzz', '8211', 'yet', 'much', 'Washington', '8217', 'skill', 'stem', 'mind-altering', 'indulgences.The', 'film', 'commercial', 'AA', 'heavy', 'dose', 'religiosity', 'thrown', 'When', 'Washington', 'someone', '8220', 'good', 'day', '8221', 'primly', 'corrected', 'No', 'have', '8220', 'blessed', '8221', 'day', 'reproach', 'Washington', 'proxy', 'audience', 'made', 'pause', 'supposedly', 'find', 'real', 'meaning', 'rebuke.The', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'thought', 'take', 'crash', 'scene', 'investigation', 'point', 'pilot', 'Washington', '12-step', 'program', 'where', 'chastened', 'proclaiming', 'mea', 'culpa', 'where', 'made', 'atone', '8211', 'exactly', 'what', '8217', 'not', 'sure.If', 'want', 'real', 'movie', 'investigation', 'plane', 'crash', 'determine', 'pilot', '8217', 'drinking', 'was', 'fault', 'was', 'other', 'cause', 'accident', 'suggest', 'check', '1960', '8217', 'classic', '8220', 'Fate', 'Hunter.', '8221', 'Steer', 'away', 'nosedive', 'drink']",Flight Combo

Very seldom have I been disappointed by his movies, that said, when I started watching Flight I was not so sure I made a good choice.  I kept watching and I have to say I grew to love it.  The story information may be hard to watch for some but it rings very true because I remember the days when some Pilots used to drink all the time in the various lounges in the airports I traveled through.As a matter of fact I met quite a few pilots back in the day and shared a few drinks with them to settle my fear of flying nerves.  These days though I am glad that the Airline industry is doing a better job of helping pilots with their possible addictions.

Instead this movie is more of a story about the life of the pilot after the amazing landing, he did after the plane failed in mid-air. It is said that no pilot could had done what he did. They even tested that many times with many different pilot in the simulator.The movie is a slow peace movie there is no action but just talking after the landing of the airplane. And, all the of the major action scenes will be in the beginning, so you can just get up and leave after the crash, if you just wanted an action movie. Please, leave now.Now, for the rest of you that are still willing to learn what happens to a pilot after a big crash, you will be pleasantly surprised. This movie can be very entertainment, if you give it a chance. You can get into the movie earlier on and enjoy finding out a little by little who is this pilot and how he could had done his amazing landing? You will find out that later, after a big crash, there is a court case and hearing for the pilot. The hearing is to see if the pilot is responsible for the crash or was it something else?The movie does a great job trying to build up to the final climax for the court appearance. At the appearance is where, the pilot future will be. Would the pilot ever fly again? Will he go to jail? Will he just skip and leave the country?

I just knew it had to do with a plane crash, and I was thinking it was an action movie or something like that. To my surprise, this is not at all what this is about. The accident is the catalyst for a wonderful story to come.This is about a man's battle with his addiction, and how this affected his life. The way in which the situation is presented is clever and thought-provoking. The reason I am saying that is because Whip, a pilot that is an alcoholic and drug user, is in charge of a flight when things go wrong with the plane. Even though Whip was inebriated, he performed a series of miraculous maneuvers and landed the plane saving most of the passengers. Almost no one could have prevented everyone from dying, but now comes the question, even if the fault was mechanical, is the fact that Whip was fulfilling his duties in that state criminal behavior?The moments after the crash get a little slow, but the intensity of the movie soon picks up. Denzel Washington delivers an amazing performance, and we completely believe he is drunk / high when we see him on screen. The many relationships Denzel's has in the plot provide this story with multiple layer of complexity and we end up feeling like we watched a masterpiece.This is not a movie to watch if you are looking for some light entertainment, or for a relaxing-have-a-good-time type of film.

1609693,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00AF6B22E,Sesho,"[1, 3]","In Flight, Denzel Washington plays boozer alcoholic jet pilot Whip Whitaker who is always living on the edge of disaster. Frequently before flights, he drinks himself into oblivion, then snorts lines of cocaine to get himself in shape to fly. This occurs sometimes less than an hour before taking the lives of his crew and passengers into his hands.In the opening minutes of the film, Whip's routine jet flight takes a turn for the deadly when his plane carrying 102 passengers experiences a mechanical failure which causes it to nosedive towards the ground. Making an unorthodox and risky aerial manuever, Whip is able to crashland the plane with minmal loss of life. Of course, after the accident, a NTSB investigation team arrives and one of the first things they find is that Whip's blood shows that he was intoxicated and high on cocaine at the time of the crash. Suffice it to say, things don't look good for Whip.Flight asks a great question of the viewer. Should Whip get out of his predicament because he saved the lives of almost all of his passengers and crew, or should he be punished for his substance abuse? It's a tough question, and it's one that Denzel's character wrestles with most of the movie. I mean, yeah, he might be able to beat the charges and walk away a hero, but then again, if he gets off, eventually his boozing and drugging are going to get people killed. It's just a matter of time. It's an age old question really. Does one heroic act make up for criminal behavior. Should he be forgiven? Should he be able to beat the system. Does his saving of 96 lives make up for the fact that over his career, he has put thousands if not tens of thousands of lives at risk? The more I think about it, to me the answer is NO.Denzel Washington has been nominated for Best Actor for his role as Whip, and I would have to say he might win it, because the Academy has a soft spot for roles portraying drug addicts and the mentally and physically disabled. But he's gonna face stiff competition in the form of Daniel Day Lewis, who I predict will ultimately win the award. The problem with Flight is that too often when Denzel gets drunk in this movie, it almost comes off as comedy or even a parody of alcoholism. It isn't helped by John Goodman's farcical take on a drug supplier that makes the audience laugh. Some people say it's not pleasant to be around a drunk. I would codify that more. It's ANNOYING. They get on your nerves. Everytime Whip got wasted in Flight, I was like rolling my eyes and muttering ""OMG, do I have to see this AGAIN!"". When you see him fall into a coffee table, instead of being horrified, it strikes you as akin to a Saturday Night Live sketch.There's also an underlying religious theme at work in Flight as well. Time and again we are reminded that God Himself is making this movie happen. That God caused the deaths of the innocent people on the plane just so Whip could be taught a lesson. That part came off as so much hogwash. That God would allow people to die just so a drunk scumbag could see the truth of his life. Ugh.It was nice to see Bob Zemeckis try his hand again at live action moviemaking instead of his bizarre and disturbing experimentation with performance capture, which I feel had driven him to a 10 year dead end. He's like George Lucas, but to an even worse extreme. But unlike George, I feel that Bob could return to making good movies if he tried. Much like Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi in the gloriously flawed Prometheus, I think Bob is rusty at doing what he used to be one of the best at. Here's hoping his next film will be better.",2,FLYING HIGH,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,3613,"['Flight', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'boozer', 'alcoholic', 'jet', 'pilot', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'always', 'living', 'edge', 'disaster', 'Frequently', 'flights', 'oblivion', 'then', 'lines', 'cocaine', 'get', 'shape', 'fly', 'sometimes', 'less', 'hour', 'taking', 'lives', 'crew', 'passengers', 'hands.In', 'opening', 'minutes', 'film', 'Whip', 'routine', 'jet', 'flight', 'turn', 'deadly', 'when', 'plane', 'carrying', '102', 'passengers', 'mechanical', 'failure', 'nosedive', 'towards', 'ground', 'Making', 'unorthodox', 'risky', 'aerial', 'manuever', 'Whip', 'able', 'crashland', 'plane', 'minmal', 'loss', 'life', 'course', 'accident', 'NTSB', 'investigation', 'team', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'find', 'Whip', 'blood', 'shows', 'was', 'intoxicated', 'high', 'cocaine', 'time', 'crash', 'Suffice', 'say', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'Whip.Flight', 'great', 'question', 'viewer', 'Should', 'Whip', 'get', 'predicament', 'saved', 'lives', 'almost', 'passengers', 'crew', 'should', 'be', 'punished', 'substance', 'abuse', 'tough', 'question', 'one', 'Denzel', 'character', 'wrestles', 'most', 'movie', 'mean', 'yeah', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'beat', 'charges', 'walk', 'away', 'hero', 'then', 'again', 'off', 'eventually', 'boozing', 'drugging', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'people', 'killed', 'just', 'matter', 'time', 'age', 'old', 'question', 'really', 'one', 'heroic', 'act', 'make', 'up', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'Should', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Should', 'be', 'able', 'beat', 'system', 'saving', '96', 'lives', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'career', 'put', 'thousands', 'not', 'tens', 'thousands', 'lives', 'risk', 'more', 'think', 'answer', 'NO.Denzel', 'Washington', 'been', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'role', 'Whip', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'might', 'win', 'Academy', 'soft', 'spot', 'roles', 'portraying', 'drug', 'addicts', 'mentally', 'physically', 'disabled', 'gon', 'face', 'stiff', 'competition', 'form', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'who', 'predict', 'will', 'ultimately', 'win', 'award', 'problem', 'Flight', 'too', 'often', 'when', 'Denzel', 'drunk', 'movie', 'almost', 'off', 'comedy', 'even', 'parody', 'alcoholism', ""n't"", 'helped', 'John', 'Goodman', 'farcical', 'take', 'drug', 'supplier', 'audience', 'laugh', 'people', 'say', 'not', 'pleasant', 'be', 'drunk', 'would', 'codify', 'more', 'ANNOYING', 'get', 'nerves', 'Everytime', 'Whip', 'got', 'wasted', 'Flight', 'was', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'muttering', 'OMG', 'do', 'have', 'see', 'AGAIN', 'When', 'see', 'fall', 'coffee', 'table', 'instead', 'being', 'horrified', 'akin', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketch.There', 'also', 'underlying', 'religious', 'theme', 'work', 'Flight', 'as', 'well', 'Time', 'again', 'are', 'reminded', 'God', 'Himself', 'making', 'movie', 'happen', 'God', 'caused', 'deaths', 'innocent', 'people', 'plane', 'just', 'so', 'Whip', 'could', 'be', 'taught', 'lesson', 'part', 'came', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'hogwash', 'God', 'would', 'allow', 'people', 'die', 'just', 'so', 'drunk', 'scumbag', 'could', 'see', 'truth', 'life', 'Ugh.It', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Bob', 'Zemeckis', 'try', 'hand', 'again', 'live', 'action', 'moviemaking', 'instead', 'bizarre', 'disturbing', 'experimentation', 'performance', 'capture', 'feel', 'had', 'driven', '10', 'year', 'dead', 'end', 'George', 'Lucas', 'even', 'worse', 'extreme', 'George', 'feel', 'Bob', 'could', 'return', 'making', 'good', 'movies', 'tried', 'Much', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'return', 'sci-fi', 'gloriously', 'flawed', 'Prometheus', 'think', 'Bob', 'rusty', 'doing', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'Here', 'hoping', 'next', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'better']",Flight Combo

The movie's trailers suggest that it is packed with action and thrills.  Yes, there are moments like that, but the majority of this film is a character study of a commercial airline pilot, played by Denzel Washington and of others.There were a few places where better direction and tighter editing were needed and some scenes could have been shortened.  The character of lead investigator for the NTSB (Ellen Block) was intended to be a no-nonsense, strident individual.  IMHO, she over-acted, making the role a caricature of women in power.Washington captured the nuances of his pilot character (Whip); a fast-living sky jockey who eventually needs to come down to earth to face his demons and accusers.John Goodman's character of a 'candy-man' was well-played.  Casting him in this role was an excellent choice and he brought comedic relief to an intense scene.Kelly Reilly played Nicole.  Her character was a troubled and struggling young woman who desperately wanted to live a different life.  Her portrayal was realistic and touching.Set your expectations.  If you ignore the hype and watch FLIGHT more for its characters and less as a powerful, action-filled movie, you will probably enjoy it more.",3,"WATCH, BUT SET YOUR EXPECTATIONS FIRST",1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,1337,"['Sometimes', 'hype', 'movie', 'warranted', 'expectations', 'are', 'met', 'FLIGHT', 'interesting', 'movie', 'not', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'trailers', 'suggest', 'packed', 'action', 'thrills', 'Yes', 'are', 'moments', 'majority', 'film', 'character', 'study', 'commercial', 'airline', 'pilot', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'others.There', 'were', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'better', 'direction', 'tighter', 'editing', 'were', 'needed', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'character', 'lead', 'investigator', 'NTSB', 'Ellen', 'Block', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'no-nonsense', 'strident', 'individual', 'IMHO', 'over-acted', 'making', 'role', 'caricature', 'women', 'power.Washington', 'captured', 'nuances', 'pilot', 'character', 'Whip', 'fast-living', 'sky', 'jockey', 'who', 'eventually', 'come', 'down', 'earth', 'face', 'demons', 'accusers.John', 'Goodman', 'character', ""'candy-man"", ""'"", 'was', 'well-played', 'Casting', 'role', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'brought', 'comedic', 'relief', 'intense', 'scene.Kelly', 'Reilly', 'played', 'Nicole', 'character', 'was', 'troubled', 'struggling', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'live', 'different', 'life', 'portrayal', 'was', 'realistic', 'touching.Set', 'expectations', 'ignore', 'hype', 'watch', 'FLIGHT', 'more', 'characters', 'less', 'powerful', 'action-filled', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'more']",Flight Combo

Its not surprising that many people do not like seeing Denzel in a role where the character is completely flawed, we like to see Denzel as the nice guy, good guy hero. I think Denzel should be very proud of this performance as it is a difficult role. The flight crash in this film is thrilling but it only takes up a small portion of the film, the rest is a character study of a man who had achieved greatness but sacrifices it all. Its a morality play where someone has the choice of lying and ridding themselves of a steep penalty or telling the truth where the only reward is a clean conscience and a sense of personal integrity. The choice may seem obvious but its not. After watching the film there was a part of me that felt he should have just lied, just one more time, that the stakes were too high and he would sacrifice too much but those stakes are ones that would have saved this characters life.

I was not impressed with the character's flying abilities and I blamed him for the plane crash, though the story showed that there were mechanical problems with the plane.  Had he not been high, he may have done his walk around (the plane) properly before the flight and discovered the mechanical problem or he may have turned the plane around when he initially encountered the storm.  I think the storytellers also made a mistake suggesting the co-pilot was green - the audience, most of us having no idea how to fly a plane, had to rely on the co-pilot as he was the only non-impaired pilot in the cockpit and the co-pilot showed very clearly the captain was off the rails (though the audience already knew this as we witness his cocaine use and drinking on the job).  Had the audience been given a medium level experienced co-pilot, perhaps we wouldn't have seen the Denzel Washington character as bizzarly as the co-pilot obviously did.  Anyway, a more experienced co-pilot would have helped serve the audience better, in my opinion, than a greenish one; would have helped us understand more clearly that the captain, even impaired, had a huge flying talent - that would have been a better story strategy; it would have helped us see the captain as something more than just a negligent drunk, though he obviously was both negligent and a drunk.  A more experienced pilot would have helped us see the Denzel Washington character's genius; I think that was what the storytellers were aiming for, but they missed the mark, sticking the audience with a green co-pilot.  Also, there were four people who knew the pilot was not capable of flying the plane; the pilot, the co-pilot, and two of the stewardesses, none of those four people stepped up.  The pilot was deranged from coke and alcohol, but the stewardesses and co-pilot were not impaired and risked their lives and the lives of all the passengers, why?  Didn't like how the Denzel Washington character tampered with witnesses in a federal investigation, and got away with it - also not believable that he would have gotten away with it.

1609763,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00AF6B22E,Steve Douglas,"[1, 2]","Anyone reading this already knows what the film is about and has heard a myriad number of opinions on this and that, so I will focus upon only the actual quality of the film's transfer to Blu Ray and my rating is based upon that and not the movie itself.  That said, I like the film though it can be slow at times, and the acting is spot on great.VIDEO.....The video transfer to Blu Ray doesn't get much better than this.  There was no artifacting of any kind nor aliasing when in certain scenes both aliasing and stair stepping could have visually presented themselves.  Color grading is fairly warm in appearance but very naturally so.  Post production editors did not overly boost colors nor crush the blacks so your image is very lifelike in all scenes.  No bleach bypassing either which has grown to be found in more and more films these days.  You have to look hard to find the barest hint of grain and then it would be on walls in the background. Contrast is perfect, not too sharp nor soft and details in most dark scenes are readily identifiable  Mbps rates seemed to average in the high 20s to low 30's depending upon the action in the film.  5 Stars for the video transfer.AUDIO.....I read elsewhere another reviewer's thoughts on the audio.  He thought it was great.  I was very disappointed in the audio transfer of this film.  Much of a reviewer's credibility lies in how they see a film i.e. what monitor were they watching, what speakers were they listening through, did they have a stereo system or a 5.1 or 7.1 home theater setup, what is the quality of their amps, preamp and processor, Blu Ray player and speakers and subwoofer. I have a very high end, esoteric home theater and the audio of a film is just as important to me as the video.  So I am okay with another person's contrary opinions to mine.  For the film Flight, you are presented with a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio and the lossless audio will always be better than a lossy one.  However, while most of this film is dialogue driven there are plenty of opportunities for foley audio fx for the surrounds but the audio editors failed to take advantage of them.  Almost all the film is presented in the front stage with very rare use of the rear stage.  This might be okay for some but the big jet crash scene should have made you feel as if you were in the jet itself as it was going down.  While the LFE channel got a great workout for  this scene, almost all the audio was widely placed across the front sound stage with very little discreet directionality of that audio.  It sounded as if the front left, center and front right channels were all getting the same info.Despite the lossless codec, this film's dialogue audio levels sounded too low for me, not because of background soundtracks or foley fx, its just that while most times the dialogue could be transparently clear, at many times it almost went to a whisper.  An example is when Denzel's character is listening to a phone message.  Yes, the message should have a different audio tonality but it should be loud enough to clearly understand.  It not always was in both this scene and several others.  I sadyl give the audio a 3 star rating at best.EXTRAS...Do you call 3 advertisement previews for other films extras?  I don't.  They force you to pay for advertising, which is what these previews are, and take up more disc space instead of leaving room for even less compression of the feature film.  I really hate having to pay for previews.Other extras include a typical 'Making of', production origins, a panel discussion about the film which I haven't watched yet and a short doc on the crash itself.  There are no out takes or deleted scenes.Also included is the Standard Def version on disc which is always handy and, IMHO, a worthless Ultraviolet serial number for downloading the film.  I have never talked to anyone who likes Ultraviolet.  Having the SD DVD is enough.All my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray and the disc itself and I do hope that this review has been of some help to your in deciding upon your purchase.Thanks for reading.",4,Flight 2 disc combo on Blu Ray,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,4133,"['Anyone', 'reading', 'already', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'heard', 'myriad', 'number', 'opinions', 'will', 'focus', 'only', 'actual', 'quality', 'film', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'rating', 'based', 'not', 'movie', 'said', 'like', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'slow', 'times', 'acting', 'spot', 'great.VIDEO', '..The', 'video', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'artifacting', 'kind', 'aliasing', 'when', 'certain', 'scenes', 'aliasing', 'stair', 'stepping', 'could', 'have', 'visually', 'presented', 'Color', 'grading', 'fairly', 'warm', 'appearance', 'very', 'naturally', 'so', 'Post', 'production', 'editors', 'did', 'not', 'overly', 'boost', 'colors', 'crush', 'blacks', 'so', 'image', 'very', 'lifelike', 'scenes', 'bleach', 'bypassing', 'grown', 'be', 'found', 'more', 'more', 'films', 'days', 'have', 'look', 'hard', 'find', 'barest', 'hint', 'grain', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'walls', 'background', 'Contrast', 'perfect', 'not', 'too', 'sharp', 'soft', 'details', 'most', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'readily', 'identifiable', 'Mbps', 'rates', 'seemed', 'average', 'high', '20s', 'low', '30', 'depending', 'action', 'film', '5', 'Stars', 'video', 'transfer.AUDIO', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'reviewer', 'thoughts', 'audio', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'audio', 'transfer', 'film', 'Much', 'reviewer', 'credibility', 'how', 'see', 'film', 'i.e', 'what', 'monitor', 'were', 'watching', 'what', 'speakers', 'were', 'listening', 'did', 'have', 'stereo', 'system', '5.1', '7.1', 'home', 'theater', 'setup', 'what', 'quality', 'amps', 'preamp', 'processor', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'speakers', 'subwoofer', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'end', 'esoteric', 'home', 'theater', 'audio', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'video', 'So', 'am', 'okay', 'person', 'contrary', 'opinions', 'mine', 'film', 'Flight', 'are', 'presented', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'audio', 'lossless', 'audio', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'better', 'lossy', 'one', 'However', 'most', 'film', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'are', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'foley', 'audio', 'fx', 'surrounds', 'audio', 'editors', 'failed', 'take', 'advantage', 'Almost', 'film', 'presented', 'front', 'stage', 'very', 'rare', 'use', 'rear', 'stage', 'might', 'be', 'okay', 'big', 'jet', 'crash', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'jet', 'was', 'going', 'down', 'LFE', 'channel', 'got', 'great', 'workout', 'scene', 'almost', 'audio', 'was', 'widely', 'placed', 'front', 'sound', 'stage', 'very', 'little', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'audio', 'sounded', 'front', 'left', 'center', 'front', 'right', 'channels', 'were', 'getting', 'same', 'info.Despite', 'lossless', 'codec', 'film', 'dialogue', 'audio', 'levels', 'sounded', 'too', 'low', 'not', 'background', 'soundtracks', 'foley', 'fx', 'just', 'while', 'most', 'times', 'dialogue', 'could', 'be', 'transparently', 'clear', 'many', 'times', 'almost', 'went', 'whisper', 'example', 'when', 'Denzel', 'character', 'listening', 'phone', 'message', 'Yes', 'message', 'should', 'have', 'different', 'audio', 'tonality', 'should', 'be', 'loud', 'enough', 'clearly', 'understand', 'not', 'always', 'was', 'scene', 'several', 'others', 'sadyl', 'give', 'audio', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'best.EXTRAS', 'Do', 'call', '3', 'advertisement', 'previews', 'other', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'force', 'pay', 'advertising', 'what', 'previews', 'are', 'take', 'up', 'more', 'disc', 'space', 'instead', 'leaving', 'room', 'even', 'less', 'compression', 'feature', 'film', 'really', 'hate', 'having', 'pay', 'previews.Other', 'extras', 'include', 'typical', ""'Making"", 'production', 'origins', 'panel', 'discussion', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'short', 'doc', 'crash', 'are', 'out', 'deleted', 'scenes.Also', 'included', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'disc', 'always', 'handy', 'IMHO', 'worthless', 'Ultraviolet', 'serial', 'number', 'downloading', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'talked', 'anyone', 'who', 'Ultraviolet', 'Having', 'SD', 'DVD', 'enough.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'actual', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase.Thanks', 'reading']",Flight Combo

He certainly was not always a likable person, and couldn't be trusted in some ways. However, he was a damn good pilot, and he saved nearly all of the persons on the plane, due to his skill. They proved that there was mechanical malfunction of the plane, and it was also a fact that the one flight attendant died because she was not seated and buckled in. Was the child in his own seat and fell out, or was he being held on his mother's lap? At any rate, I thought it was wrong that Whit was sent to prison. It was not his fault that the plane malfunctioned, there was no negligence on his part, and there was nothing that he could have done to change what happened. Instead, as said, he saved 96 lives and avoided the deaths of everyone nearby on the ground. He was a hero. I didn't like the relationship with Nicole and felt it pointless. It added nothing.I also didn't at all like his exwife or son. While he may not have been the best husband and father, he was supporting his son, as we see in the first minute of the film. He was paying for the son's private school, and also the home they were living in, and yet they treated him like dirt, while they were trying to get money from him. I didn't like the ending scene with the son either who seemed to want to twist the knife, and just demanded that Denzel spill his guts. They didn't seem to have any real relationship. I say again, if you don't want someone in your life, then stop harassing them for money, and pay your own way.Maybe Whit needed to have a house fall on him, in the form of being sent to prison, to finally get that he needed to change his ways, but I thought that the ending didn't fit the crime, since it was said that he had lost everything, and had no future.

The aircraft's pilot, a former naval aviator hopped up on booze and drugs, does what should've been impossible - recover an MD-80 series aircraft from an uncontrollable dive and with his first officer manage to land it in a field, near a church, and right across a stream from where baptisms are occurring.  Alas, one of the flight attendants dies, which means the NTSB must investigate, putting the pilot's career in jeopardy and leading to a major crisis in courage.In real life, an Alaska Airline MD-83 aircraft, a relative of the MD-80, did experience such a failure, putting the aircraft into an extreme dive, in early 2000.  Though the pilots were able to recover from one dive, they couldn't recover from a second, even when they tried to roll the aircraft inverted.  Eighty-three passengers and five crew members died that day.  Which means that when the MD-80 in ""Flight"" tried the same thing, it should've all been over.""Flight"", then, is a movie built around a premise that it simply cannot sustain.  In fact, everything after the crash is essentially a moot point.  All this despite normally reliable star power than includes John Goodman (who was grating), Don Cheadle (who was wimpy), and Denzel Washington (who did not have Rosario Dawson, Chris Pine, and 2,000 tons of locomotive to bail him out as he did in ""Unstoppable"").A much better movie in a similar vein is ""The High and The Mighty"", which is considered to be one of the prototypes of the modern disaster movie.  It starred John Wayne and Robert Stack as two pilots who run into trouble with their DC-6 during a routine flight from Honolulu to San Francisco.

You cannot help but think of so many public figures who have failed us and inspired us:  Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Mark McGuire, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Bill Clinton, Oscar Pistorius.  The list goes on.  By stepping into the public spotlight, it exposed their brilliance and their flaws.  We held them up to a higher standard because we believed.  We found in the end they were just like the rest of us.  They were human.I gave this film a chance because I wondered what the director Bob Zemeckis was up to after having his motion capture studio shut down by Disney after making several mediocre movies that underperformed at the box office.  I once believed that Zemeckis was a master storyteller who could do no wrong:  Back to the Future, Castaway, Forrest Gump, even the okay films like What Lies Beneath and Who Framed Roger Rabbit had appealing stories.After seeing this story unfold on screen, it's clear that very few directors can hold a candle to Zemeckis.  This is a story about redemption.  How you have to lose everything to reclaim your soul.  How you pay for your sins in ways you don't ever expect or imagine.  It is a heartfelt journey that is impossible to look away from.Denzel Washington is in top form.  If you saw his performance in Man on Fire as a bodyguard with an alcohol problem or his Oscar winning role in Training Day, you see how this actor has matured and grown.  It is one of the greatest performances in recent memory.  This is a brilliant, earnest performance.The movie is not perfect.  John Goodman kicks the doors in and in many ways, his comic performance takes us out of the story.  It's distracting unlike his performance in Argo where he stole the show.  At times, it is too much.  Don Cheadle is excellent and understated as a smart union lawyer.  The actor in the stairwell playing a cancer patient is amazing.  The apex of the film happens at the hearing.  I only wish it was a close up on Denzel's face when he says &#34;God Help Me.&#34;I also think some of the characters are underdeveloped.  The NTSB interrogator does not seem scary enough.  Please see a movie called The Verdict with Paul Newman and see how they created a demon with James Mason in only a few scenes.  I wish they showed a close up of her at the plane wreckage scene.  Also, I got lost with who the pretty woman was in the hotel.  Was she the same character as the stewardess on the doomed flight?On another note, I think it is time someone tells the director that showing women with ample assets is an immature choice.  Did anyone see the scene in Beowulf where the barmaid is scantily clad?  It was embarrassing to watch it with my pre teen son.  Same sort of feeling with the opening scene.  You get the feeling that the actress is preening for the camera.  Why the angle with her chest in the opening shot?  Doesn't the director know how distracting this choice is for the audience?  Please make the same choices with showing less at times and more at other moments.There was a scene of intimacy between the pilot and his new found love.  Please see Monster's Ball and how honest and true it was when Halle Berry let her guard down.  Flight leaves us short changed emotionally as these two consenting adults find an emotional connection.It is worth a look.

1609826,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00AF6B22E,The People's Critic,"[4, 7]","Director Robert Zemeckis has given us the latest ""disaster"" movie. In the case of Flight however, Zemeckis' first live-action film since 2000&#8242;s Cast Away, this is less the Die Hard kind of ""disaster"" and more the Leaving Las Vegas type. Zemeckis is a well-known director, whose films have peppered the pop-culture lexicon for the past 35 years. He is a pioneer who took Marty McFly Back to the Future, taught Forrest to run in Forrest Gump, and broke new ground in live-action/animation film making with films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beowulf, The Polar Express, and A Christmas Carol. This year, Zemeckis showcases his craft with a strong character study of a disturbed pilot in Flight.The intensity and effectiveness of Flight rests on the shoulders of its star, Denzel Washington, and it turns out Denzel Washington has some pretty strong shoulders. Washington dives head first into the character of pilot Whip Whitaker (a classic ""pilot"" name). Whitaker is a closeted addict, shrouded in denial. He routinely drinks to excess and uses stimulants to even out before flights. His lifestyle has cost him virtually any relationship or contact with his wife and son and has led him down the path of womanizing and heavy substance abuse as a desperate form of distraction.Flight sets out to tell a story of moral ambiguity. Its protagonist is one who tests the ethical boundaries of the audience where at one moment we are rooting for him and the next, we are disgusted by him. This ambiguity fuels the pace and power of the film, and makes its 138 minute running time literally ""fly"" by. Washington is excellent, but Zemeckis is precise in his style, editing, and (yes, Pam and Eric) in his cinematography. Washington makes us see Whitaker's struggle, but Zemeckis makes us feel it with expert use of camera movements, showing us a static sober Whitaker and a flowing, frantic intoxicated Whitaker. The crash sequence is compelling and exceeds expectations, regardless of its assumed predictability. These nuanced touches make Flight deeply engaging and provide for some harrowingly primal audience reaction.Furthermore, Washington's stellar performance is complemented at every turn with a pitch perfect supporting cast including Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, Melissa Leo, and John Goodman (who is 2 for 2 with electric supporting roles this year with Flight and Argo). While the performances and the story are excellent, Flight does not accomplish all it is trying to do. A motif of religious purpose and providence feels crow barred in. Also, while excellent, the soundtrack is a bit heavy-handed in its relevance to what's happening on the screen, which can be distracting. However, these are minor quibbles. Overall, Flight is an excellent narrative that explores the dangers of addiction in an impressively unique way. This is a strong film that expertly demonstrates the talent of its cast and director.

1609827,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B00AF6B22E,The Separator,"[0, 0]","In this 2012 film, Director Robert Zemeckis shows-off his filmmaking chops in the film&#8217;s first forty-five phenomenal minutes. The plane crash in Flight is spectacular and original. A fresh new take and a welcome addition to the genre, it&#8217;s unlike any other plane crash I&#8217;ve seen before.Preparing for its final decent into Atlanta the MD-80 aircraft of Southjet Flight 227 severely malfunctions. The elevator, the hinged wings on the plane&#8217;s tail stick downward, sending the plane into a steep dive. A disastrous crash is almost certain, but with ace pilot Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) at the controls, he and his crew pull off a remarkable feat and save hundreds of lives.After the gripping first act, the rest of film the film is propelled forward solely by Washington who is in fine form, yet despite this, the film mostly drags on. Many long, unnecessary, and awkward scenes could have easily have been cut, and the film would have been better for it. Parts of the back-story of Whitaker&#8217;s life work great, while others are just too convenient to be believable.Flight tries to be more than just a plane crash film. The film delves deep into the destruction alcoholism can cause, and also attempts to tackle the question of what it is to be a hero.While drudging up some very interesting and heavy material, considering the film&#8217;s length of 2hr 18min, a much clearer statement of intent would have been nice. Since Captain Whitaker is an alcoholic, there is a ton of backlash against him, but the dialogue on the subject of whether or not a drunk can be a hero, is far from concluded.7.5/10Errata: Can an MD-80 aircraft fly upside down? These aircraft were never designed to fly inverted, obviously, but can they? According to Larry Goodrich, the film&#8217;s flight consultant, the answer is no, or at least not for very long. He says the aircraft&#8217;s wings would lose lift, and after that the plane would come down[1].[1] Can airliners really fly upside down? - CNN.comGet more reviews at getthebonwesaw.blogspot.com",4,Best Plane Crash Scene of all time?

1609837,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00AF6B22E,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","Many films suffer from under-exposure. People don't hear about or have the opportunity to see a great film filled with great performances because the film is produced and released by a small company and it never reaches movie theaters in the suburbs. When it reaches DVD and Streaming, people have another opportunity, but a theatrical release is the main driving force behind a DVD release, so it may be ignored here as well.Robert Zemeckis' new film ""Flight"" suffers from just the opposite. From the moment people started to see it, at festivals and screenings, praise and hype has been heaped on the film and Denzel Washington's performance. All of this praise has amped up our expectations to a place it would be difficult to meet. And it didn't meet my expectations.Zemckis has spent the last few years making motion-capture computer animated films. He uses this technology to film actors wearing specially designed suits as they act out their roles. Then, his technicians add a layer of computer animation to place these characters in rich and impressive landscapes. This technology allows Zemeckis to put his characters in created landscapes it would be too costly and prohibitive to make otherwise.The experiment has yielded very good (""A Christmas Carol""), good (""Monster House""), strange (""The Polar Express"") and abysmal results (""Beowulf""). But the experiment seems strangest of all because Zemeckis, a director made famous by his fantasy and action films, films memorable because of the humanity of the actors, became so enthralled with technology that ultimately takes away that layer of humanity.In ""Flight"", Zemeckis returns to a story very much grounded (har har!) in reality. This may be one of the reasons the film is receiving so much praise; people are happy to see humans in a Zemeckis' film again. No more soulless, blank-eyed zombies trying to entice children onto a train destined for a far away land.The other reason ""Flight"" is receiving so much praise is Washington's performance. It is pretty remarkable and unlike anything he has done before. Raw, vulnerable, emotional, very conflicted. On the outside, he appears to be every bit the archetype Washington hero. But as we watch the performance unfold, Washington brings so many new layers to the role, giving us a three-dimensional portrait of Whip Whitaker, a very troubled pilot working for a small airline.From the opening frames, you realize Washington is going for something different, very different from what we have seen before. The actor has stated in interviews that he avoids scenes of intimacy because he doesn't want to make his wife uncomfortable. Because of this, we rarely if ever see him kiss his on-screen love interest. In ""Flight"", all of these notions are thrown out the window.Whip Whitaker is an addict. He shows up hung over for his quick flight from Orlando to Atlanta. After checking the exterior, in torrential rain, he boards and gets every one ready for take-off. The flight immediately runs into very bad turbulence, but he and his co-pilot lead the plane out of the bad weather. About a half hour later, the plane experiences more trouble.As soon as Whip realizes the plane is in trouble, his senses and faculties kick into razor-sharp focus. All of the previous alcohol and drug-use seem to completely dissipate. He guides the plane to safety, saving most of the passengers and crew from a more fatal crash landing.All of this happens in the first act. And it is compelling and insanely watchable. Every so often, a film depicts an event so well, your mind remembers it every time the subject is broached. In ""Flight"", the turbulent landing of the jet is such an event. You won't find this film playing on any commercial flight. Nor should you watch it while flying on a plane. No good will come from such an act. ""The Gray"" was the last film I saw with such an intense, realistically depicted plane crash. ""The Impossible"", out in December, features a harrowing depiction of the tsunami that hit Thailand a few years ago.But once act 2 begins, ""Flight"" veers off course. It really starts to do this much earlier. As we watch Whip starting his day, the narrative suddenly, inexplicably shifts to follow Nicole (Kelly Reilly, Mary Watson in ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"") as she tries to score. Ultimately, Nicole's life intercepts with Whips, but these initial moments are jarring because they pull us out of and distract us from Whip's more interesting story. Worse, Nicole's story has been done and seen millions of times. And many of these have been much more convincing. Just about every time Nicole enters the story, the film loses focus.As Whip recovers in the hospital, people begin to show up. Everyone is ready to acknowledge he is a hero, but there is also an undercurrent of sentiment leading people to begin questioning his sobriety. Enter Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood), the Pilot's Union President, and Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), the lawyer they hire to represent Whip. The entire second act is about Whip trying to fight his addiction; he retreats to his childhood home and camps out, trying to evade reporters. He tries valiantly to stay sober, but the urge proves too great.Ultimately the film mars Washington's performance by becoming too preachy. He seems to be doing well; he throws all the alcohol away, he attends AA, he meets various survivors and their families, all-eager to heap gratitude on Whip. But all of this only serves to drive Whip closer and closer to the bottle of the drugs as he falls back on his old, self-destructive habits.Washington's performance is very good and very realistic. He is clearly going to some dark places to reveal parts of Whip's character. But the story doesn't show us anything new or take Whip to anyplace we haven't seen before. Charlie and Hugh, both charged with helping Whip avoid any criminal charges, pop up every few minutes to explain the situation and warn Whip about the consequences of his behavior. Ultimately, they are warning us, preaching to us about the consequences. It makes the progression of Whip's problems seem a little too 'movie-of-the-week'. At one point, Whip attends an AA meeting, but leaves early because it isn't for him, he doesn't need it, and he can handle his addiction. Really? We have seen this so many times before, in television shows, television movies, feature films, etc. I understand that most addicts will probably go through this type of experience, but it doesn't mean we have to watch every addict on screen go through the same thing. Unless they experience something new related to it.John Goodman appears as Harling Mays, Whip's dealer. His performance is another scene-stealer and worthy of praise.Melissa Leo pops up in the final moments as a NTSB Investigator. Her role is too brief and one-note to add anything special.Written By John Gatins (""Real Steel"", ""Coach Carter""), the story was inspired by his own travels through addiction. But he doesn't really offer anything new because we've seen these highs and lows before. And his background writing Hollywood-style inspirational movies lead us to a similar extremely conventional, and predictable, Hollywood-like ending in ""Flight"" that just seems false.Zemeckis has assembled all of the elements of a fantastic, intense nail-biter. But he wimps out; he doesn't seem to have the conviction to show us a true depiction of a man's harrowing journey through addiction. He seems to shy away from painting a truly dark, uncompromising vision, something that would be truly memorable.",3,Washington's Great Performance is Marred When The Film Crashes...,1353974400,"11 27,

Flight is about the extraordinary pilot who, despite being very drunk, performs a crash landing that saves nearly all onboard.

The story explores the character's flight from truth--his failure as a husband and father, his failure to acknowledge his addiction, his failure to live with any sense of integrity. Stories about alcoholism and addiction are hard to watch, especially if the character has great talent. This one approaches classic Greek tragedy. Is Washington's pilot a hero? Yes, but, without giving any more of the plot away, his heroism has nothing to do with flying an airplane. Flight is Zemeckis' most adult film to date, a film about grownups to be viewed by grownups.

Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, so I was going to see it either way, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. The previews and commercial all focused on the crash and the hero who made an impossible move to land the plane safely, but in reality that's just a small part of the movie. The true focus of the movie is on the troubled life of pilot, Whip Whitaker (Washington), whose demons seem to find him wherever he goes. When he's in the air, Whip is at peace and away from a life of hardship and disappointments, but after the crash, he's unable to fly and has to face that life head on. The film itself was actually a bit slow after the thrilling introduction and the excitement on board the plane. At parts during this film, I was bored, but it's necessary to bring the story together into an unexpected conclusion. Sometimes, a film is slow and it's just not worth it to sit there, but Flight is different. The film may lack something in the middle, but it is well worth you're time. The story is out of this world and Denzel Washington shows that he hasn't lost a thing. This man brings such a strong presents to everything that he does, that often times I find myself overlooking the entire rest of the cast. There are a lot of big names in this film, that all become forgettable after the performance Washington gives.

1609852,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00AF6B22E,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","FLIGHT is film that belongs in the ""airplane disaster"" genre of films. In a nutshell, a senior-level airplane pilot has a severe and chronic problem with alcohol, recreational drugs, and hookers. During a routine flight, the plane experiences a mechanical problem which prevents the tail rudder from functioning, and the plane spontaneously dives into a crash mode. Fortunately, the pilot is able to rescue the plane (by flying it upside-down), releases excess fuel into the atmosphere, and skillfully lands it in a grassy field. Most of the film is spent disclosing the pilot's indulgences in alcohol, cocaine, and other sleazy behaviors.The entire film is a journey to a destination that takes the form of a plus/minus choices. An example of the plus/minus choices are: (1) Should the pilot be held responsible for the crash and for the few passenger deaths, because of his unique alcoholism and recreational drug activities with the consequent loss of control of the craft, or (2) Should the pilot be lauded as a hero, because of his astonishing skill in maintaining control of the airplane during the mechanical failure, and because of the fact that he prevented the deaths of dozens of passengers? The surprise ending is that the destination of the movie is located in a legal ""gray area."" (Don't worry, I do not tell how the story ends.)TECHNICAL ASPECTS. The technical aspect of the film is based on a real event, namely, Alaska Airlines flight 261. In flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft experienced a fatal accident on January 31, 2000 over the Pacific Ocean about 2.7 miles north of Anacapa Island, California. The two pilots and 83 passengers on board were killed.The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the cause was a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system screw assembly's acme nut threads. Towards the end of the movie (Flight), the viewing audience watches a federal inquest as to the causes of the crash, and the viewing audience learns that the failure was due to excess wearing of the same screw assembly.OPENING MOMENTS. The opening moments of the movie will come as a surprise. The viewer will be treated to an abundance of mammary footage and gluteal footage of Denzel Washington's drug addict girlfriend. I was wondering if we were going to see naked footage of Mr.Washington, but fortunately the viewer is spared. In the opening minutes, we also see Mr.Washington snorting cocaine, we see bag of marijuana, and we see the girlfriend injecting heroin. Now the question that arises is, whether adult viewers will have a stomach for this sort of thing. Certainly, male viewers will welcome the excellent anatomy of the female actress. However, the nude scenes, and the drug scenes, seemed to me, to be X-rated material. At any rate, this is the only nudity that occurs in the film, and the nudity is similar to that shown in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, when we see Dustin Hoffman's girlfriend. It is my opinion that the material is suitable for children, but only for the age of 12 and over. Younger kids will likely respond with bad dreams. In my opinion, this film is an excellent teaching device for kids of the age of 12 and up, since it provides a case history of alcoholism and addiction. The film does NOT include any Sam Pekinpah-style violence. However, parents who have made up their minds that their children should NOT see nude scenes and should NOT be exposed to scenes of alcoholism and drugs, should refrain from buying the DVD.TENOR OF THE FILM. The film provides a guided tour of some of the gray areas of life. During the flight, the young copilot is alarmed by Mr.Washington's bizarre activities in the cockpit, e.g., his behavior in pretending that the oxygen mask is a recreational drug that is to be inhaled. And so the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the naive young copilot, or of not making any committed decision at this point. While on the ground, Mr.Washington tries to become reacquainted with his son, who lives with the divorced mother, and who is totally alienated from his father. And so, the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the son's decision to cut of ties with the father, or to favor Mr.Washington's attempts at reconciliation. As the plot matures, Mr.Washington's girlfriend takes him to an alcoholics anonymous (AA) meeting, but Mr.Washington resists the hackneyed preaching of the meeting leader, and excuses himself from the meeting. And so, the viewing audience is given the choice of deciding that Mr.Washington is a lost cause, as far as his alcoholism is concerned, or of maintaining some belief that Mr.Washington will be able to reform himself eventually. For your information, it is the case that up to the very last minutes of the film, Mr.Washington continues to snort cocaine and to drink hard liquor. Another gray area is that blood samples were withdrawn from the entire crew and passengers, as well as from the dead crash victims. The result was that Mr.Washington's blood tested positive for cocaine and alcohol. The relevant gray areas (or sources of ambiguity) are as follows. The equipment from the clinical testing laboratory was not calibrated thereby leading to doubt of the validity of the lab results, and leading to the airlines officials successful sealing Mr.Washington's laboratory results, thereby preventing the positive results from being disclosed during the federal inquest. The gray area is, therefore, were the lab results really incorrect, or were they valid, in showing Mr.Washington's high alcohol and drug levels.SPECIAL EFFECTS. The crash landing scene is a work of art. After flying the airplane upside-down for several minutes, Mr.Washington rights the airplane, approaches a grassy meadow. One of the wingtips slices through a church steeple, causing parishioners to scatter, and we see the plane twisting and buckling as it lands in the field, in a dramatic manner that recalls the drama of the whaling scenes in MOBY DICK, starring Gregory Peck. Another special effect (though a low tech special effect) occurs when Mr.Washington is in a hotel room at night, waiting to meet government officials the next day. During the night, the door to the next suite, accidently left unlocked, invitingly bangs against the door latch, due to the evening wind, puffing into the adjoining hotel suite. Mr.Washington rises, walks through the door to the next suite, and stands before the open window. This is a great suspensful moment, achieved with zero expense, aside from the need for one of the film crew to jar the door a few times (thus simulating the wind). The suspense of this scene continues, when Mr.Washington spots the hotel fridge and opens it, revealing dozens of bottles of liquor and beer. Mr.Washington takes out one of the liquor bottles, and the movie camera focuses upon it closely, and the 4 inch high liquor bottle takes up the entire screen. Suspense comes, because the audience will wonder if Mr.Washington will open the bottle, or if he will resist to temptation (and decidedly turn a new leaf before his meeting the next day with airline officials who are investigating the crash).CONCLUSION. The film is one of the most intelligent films to come out of Hollywood. The film is similar to another movie starring Denzel Washington, namely, CRIMSON TIDE. CRIMSON TIDE also featured a government inquest, this one involving a submarine, and the issue of firing nuclear weapons. The journey of this movie navigates through the black and white territory involving the question of who behaved correctly, Denzel Washington or Gene Hackman. But unexpectedly, at the last moment, the plot line of CRIMSON TIDE takes an unexpected turn, and navigates away from the black and white area, and concludes in a harbor known as the ""gray area."" FLIGHT also takes a similar unexpected turn at the conclusion of the film. FIVE STARS.",5,One of the few intelligent movies to come out of Hollywood.

Then his past catches up with him and his career and life are in jeopardy. I was looking forward to this movie because of Denzel. After watching it I have to say not only was the movie fantastic but I am again amazed at how good he is in this. For someone of Denzel's stature usually you watch and only see the actor himself. For example I like him a lot but when I see Kevin Costner every once in awhile watching him I think that's him and it takes me out of the movie for a second. All that rambling is to make a point. The entire movie I didn't once see Denzel, all I saw was an alcoholic pilot who was trying to save his own skin. You aren't sure if he is a good guy or not throughout.

I won&#8217;t say what happened in the end, but it&#8217;s one of those situations where he did something that virtually no one else could do and because of his mistakes he may have to pay dearly (i.e., loss of job, income, freedom, etc&#8230;).  I felt that the pacing was great throughout the movie and I wasn&#8217;t terribly disappointed in the ending (I feel that it delivered a good message).Interesting side note: This movie was loosely based off of a true story.  In the true story the plane experienced the same type of malfunction as in the move and the pilot tried to use the same maneuver Denzel Washington did in the movie.  Unfortunately for victims and the victims&#8217; families the maneuver did not work and everyone on the plane died.

Now in ""Flight"" Denzel Washington plays a pilot Captain Whip Whitaker, who pulls off a near-impossible landing, saving the lives of most of the passengers and crew.Despite the suspenseful crash landing sequence, ""Flight"" is no more an action film than ""Cast Away"" is. Robert Zemeckis's new film focuses on the character Whip Whitaker, who, though hailed as a hero, has a secret that he desperately wants to keep from the people. We learn what the secret is right at the start of the film. In ""Flight"" an airplane accident serves only as a starting point for the story that follows, which is pretty predictable, but manages to keep us interested thanks to the star Denzel Washington's nuanced acting.The same cannot be said about the supporting characters, however. Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle deliver solid performances as a union representative and a lawyer respectively, but their characters are rather flat. John Goodman's comic relief and the romantic subplot involving a recovering heroin addict (Kelly Reilly) only make the film longer, not better.But the filmmakers have made one right choice and that is Denzel Washington.

1609870,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00AF6B22E,Turfseer,"[6, 11]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0'Flight', Robert Zemeckis' first live-action film in twelve years, starts off with one of the most spine-tingling, harrowing plane crash disaster scenes in cinematic history. Denzel Washington as the plane's alcoholic pilot, Captain William ""Whip"" Whittaker, crash lands his jet into a field after a broken jackscrew causes a catastrophic loss of control. Loosely based on a fatal Air Alaska crash in 2000, Whip successfully saves 96 out of 102 lives, by inverting the aircraft, right before it goes down.Whip winds up in the hospital and soon recovers from minor injuries. Despite being hailed as a hero (a la the real-life Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger), Whip was drunk during the flight and the National Transportation Safety Board now has a toxicology test taken when he first arrives at the hospital, that proves it. Fortunately for him, his tough as nails attorney, Hugh Lang (played by Don Cheadle), is able to quash the report due to irregularities in the blood test.While the aforementioned plane crash is riveting, the bulk of 'Flight' is unfortunately just another tale of a sad sack alcoholic wrestling with his demons. Some may be impressed by the ambiguity of a man who can be both a hero and an angry, aggressive, self-destructive alcoholic at the same time--but most of 'Flight' is a story we've seen before.While in the hospital, Whip meets Nicole who is recovering from a heroin overdose. Earlier, we see Nicole before she meets Whip and it's quite clear that her addiction is extensive. It seems rather odd that Whip would take Nicole under his wings at this juncture especially with the possibility of extensive media scrutiny, but he decides anyway to bring her back to his (now) deceased father's farm (why it takes the media a few days before they actually go out and confront Whip at the farm, doesn't ring true at all).Nicole is there to contrast her quick transcendence over her addiction as opposed to Whip's continuing denial (it seems awfully convenient that such a severe addict as Nicole, is able to see the light, so quickly!). Still, Denzel Washington does a fine job in conveying just how hard it is to deal with someone who is an alcoholic (some of the best later scenes are Whip's confrontations with Nicole).The rest of 'Flight' chronicles Whips' continuing downward spiral. There is Whip's visit to his ex-wife and son which ends quite badly and Charlie Anderson (the union rep) along with his attorney's attempt to sober him up before the big NTSB hearing. That whole scene is perhaps the least convincing in the film. You'll recall that Whip is placed in a hotel room where he has no access to alcohol. Even though they hire a bodyguard to watch the room, they don't bother to check to see if the adjoining room is stocked with alcohol. Furthermore, why would the door to the adjoining room be unlocked?--unless you've paid for the other room, a hotel would not leave such a door open.In the end, Zemeckis must opt for the 'Hollywood' ending. At the crucial moment, Whip suddenly has a change of heart, and admits 'everything' at the NTSB hearing. In this case, he won't let the flight attendant he was sleeping with before the ill-fated flight, be blamed for 'drinking while on duty' (Whip won't impugn her reputation since she was responsible for saving a child during the crash). Is this enough for a man so in denial as Whip is, to suddenly 'come clean'? Unlikely. It would have been a lot more troubling if Zemeckis showed Whip staying in denial and is cleared at the hearing--but Zemeckis needs a feel good ending. Whip does go to prison afterward but is on his way to reconciliation with his son (who visits him in prison) and presumably with the ex-wife. There's also a rather obvious moral tale here--Whip articulates it when he states at the film's conclusion that he finally feels 'free' in prison, as he is no longer hitting the bottle.Despite a pretty positive critical reception, there were a number of critics who refused to jump on the bandwagon--recognizing that the story surrounding Denzel's performance, in the words of LA Times critic Kenneth Turan, ""is not as subtle or involving as his performance."" Turan feels that 'Flight"" ""plays at times like a feature-length infomercial for the powers of AA."" David Fear agrees: ""Take out the opening jaw-dropper, and you've essentially got The Lost Weekend Redux. Despite Washington going the full nine yards ugly-drunk-wise, there's little to distinguish this from every other entry in the cinema du addiction genre: You'll get the requisite denial, hitting rock bottom and then rockier bottom, relapse and, finally, a moment of clarity.""Stan Hall in the Portland Oregonian feels that Zemeckis' ""best-known work has a tendency to go for grand gestures, old-fashioned moralizing and outcomes that can often be spotted from miles away."" And he finds that, ""there's not much real value to this oddly slick stab at popcorn entertainment about a person's debilitating alcoholism."" Andrew O'Hehir in Salon concurs that Zemeckis is a ""technical wizard"" but ""drama just isn't his instrument"": ""Slowly but surely, ""Flight"" degenerates from a tale of moral paradox and wounded romance into a mid-1990s after-school special about addiction and recovery. You get the feeling the filmmakers are aiming for a star-driven combo of the Sully saga and ""Crime and Punishment.""I quote these critics to point out that I'm not the only one who has reservations about this film. I think most of us will agree that the plane crash scene and Denzel's excellent performance are the highlights of the film. I'm not sure how many will agree with me and these other discerning critics, that Flight's narrative is nothing special, with its pedestrian emphasis on one man's quest to purge his alcoholic demons and the obvious exhortation to embrace sobriety.",2,Tale of a Captain Sully with a drinking problem nosedives after sensational crash scene opening,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,5893,"['***',

On a flight from Orlando to Atlanta something goes wrong with the plane and it starts to make a nosedive. Without many options, Whitaker decides to crash the plane saving 96 lives out of 102. Whitaker is considered a hero that is until his blood test comes out and reveals that he was intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine. Now under investigation he is told to stay away from alcohol however letting go of his addiction is not easy, as it seems.Denziel proves again why he is possibly one of the best actors out there. He plays the role of an alcoholic to almost perfection. In addition, this movie was Denziel's first Oscar nominated role since his early 2000's role in the movie Training Day. He made the audience believe that no matter what he did he could not stop drinking alcohol, which is not an easy part to play at all.Whitaker vs. Alcohol. Alcohol is a recurring theme in Whitaker's life. All he is ask of after the plane crash is to refrain from the use of alcohol. However, it's harder done than said. It seems like every opportunity Whitaker gets he drinks some kind of alcohol. More importantly he is in denial that he may be an alcoholic. He describes himself as someone that just likes to drink. Throughout his life alcohol has always got the best of him, but will he find a way to overcome his obsession and admit that he may have a problem? You will need to watch the movie and find out for yourself.I recommend this movie.

Absolutely riveting, particularly during the flight scene, you cannot look away from the screen. Denzel gives a great performance, though he'll never be my favorite actor. I find him very one-dimensional, always intense, broody, smug, cocky; but he did a fantastic job with this role, despite that. All of the acting in this movie is excellent, from the pitifully endearing addict, Nicole, to the loud-mouthed, bigger-than-life pusher played perfectly by John Goodman, to the heroic and selfless stewardesses on the plane, who risk their lives to help others without hesitation.The first half of the movie revolves around the tremendous suspense and action sequence of the titular ""flight"", then the second half slows down a bit and focuses in on the characters, their struggles, their pain, their setbacks, and ultimately their redemption.If the producers had skipped the aforementioned drug/sex/profanity, I would've given this 5 stars. You can tell a story without so graphically portraying these things. Show a man and woman closing to the door to the bedroom, you knew they were going to have sex, you didn't have to show anything. Show a drug addict contemplating a needle and then pan away; you know what they're about to do. Shoving the gritty, awful images into the audience's fact does not make the story better. Long gone are the ""classy"" methods of telling a hard-hitting drama tale, and it's a shame. We all know the realities of life and the world, the audience isn't ""learning"" anything by watching such scenes. But I digress.My only other complaint is the painfully obvious socio-political slant on some of the characters and stereotypes. Whites are sparse and portray the weaker characters, while minorities get to play all the heroes. The heroic pilot is black (granted, he has other issues, but he ""overcomes"" and is still the hero). The heroic stewardesses are black and hispanic (the lone white stewardess stupidly ignores safety regulations on the plane). The uptight, nerdy co pilot is white (said co pilot and his wife are later shown to be radically Christian, which comes across as comical and loony, not by accident I'm sure). The one other mention of God is by a white cancer patient who has ""chemo brain"" and behaves spastically rather than coherently. The brilliant young lawyer is black. The drug addict Nicole is white. The persecuting NTSB staff is white. The drug pusher is white. The life-saving doctor is Indian. Oh, and Denzel has ONE white friend in the entire movie.Great story, incredible action and suspense, excellent acting, just a shame it was tainted with too-graphic imagery and language, and a very blatantly politicized undertone.",4,"Riveting and heartbreaking, but...",1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,2829,"['story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'just', 'poignantly', 'excessive', 'profanity', 'nudity', 'graphic', 'drug', 'usage.All', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'Absolutely', 'riveting', 'particularly', 'flight', 'scene', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'Denzel', 'great', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'favorite', 'actor', 'find', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'always', 'intense', 'broody', 'smug', 'cocky', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'role', 'acting', 'movie', 'excellent', 'pitifully', 'endearing', 'addict', 'Nicole', 'loud-mouthed', 'bigger-than-life', 'pusher', 'played', 'perfectly', 'John', 'Goodman', 'heroic', 'selfless', 'stewardesses', 'plane', 'who', 'risk', 'lives', 'help', 'others', 'hesitation.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'tremendous', 'suspense', 'action', 'sequence', 'titular', 'flight', 'then', 'second', 'half', 'down', 'bit', 'characters', 'struggles', 'pain', 'setbacks', 'ultimately', 'redemption.If', 'producers', 'had', 'skipped', 'aforementioned', 'drug/sex/profanity', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', '5', 'stars', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'graphically', 'portraying', 'things', 'Show', 'man', 'woman', 'closing', 'door', 'bedroom', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'sex', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'show', 'anything', 'Show', 'drug', 'addict', 'contemplating', 'needle', 'then', 'pan', 'away', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'do', 'Shoving', 'gritty', 'awful', 'images', 'audience', 'fact', 'not', 'make', 'story', 'better', 'Long', 'gone', 'are', 'classy', 'methods', 'telling', 'hard-hitting', 'drama', 'tale', 'shame', 'know', 'realities', 'life', 'world', 'audience', ""n't"", 'learning', 'anything', 'watching', 'such', 'scenes', 'digress.My', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'socio-political', 'slant', 'characters', 'stereotypes', 'Whites', 'are', 'sparse', 'weaker', 'characters', 'minorities', 'get', 'play', 'heroes', 'heroic', 'pilot', 'black', 'granted', 'other', 'issues', 'overcomes', 'still', 'hero', 'heroic', 'stewardesses', 'are', 'black', 'hispanic', 'lone', 'white', 'stewardess', 'stupidly', 'safety', 'regulations', 'plane', 'uptight', 'nerdy', 'co', 'pilot', 'white', 'said', 'co', 'pilot', 'wife', 'are', 'later', 'shown', 'be', 'radically', 'Christian', 'comical', 'loony', 'not', 'accident', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'other', 'mention', 'God', 'white', 'cancer', 'patient', 'who', 'chemo', 'brain', 'spastically', 'rather', 'coherently', 'brilliant', 'young', 'lawyer', 'black', 'drug', 'addict', 'Nicole', 'white', 'persecuting', 'NTSB', 'staff', 'white', 'drug', 'pusher', 'white', 'life-saving', 'doctor', 'Indian', 'Oh', 'Denzel', 'ONE', 'white', 'friend', 'entire', 'movie.Great', 'story', 'incredible', 'action', 'suspense', 'excellent', 'acting', 'just', 'shame', 'was', 'tainted', 'too-graphic', 'imagery', 'language', 'very', 'blatantly', 'politicized', 'undertone']",Flight Combo

Whitaker runs into mechanical trouble during a routine flight from Florida to Atlanta and the plane crashes but he manages to save the life of many of the passengers due to his skill as a pilot. Unfortunately, the NTSB investigation uncovers Whip's problem putting into question if he could have caused the crash himself.While in the hospital recovering Whip meets Nicole (Kelly Rilley)a recovering drug addict that he becomes romantically involved with as his life continues to take a dive as severe as the plane crash he walked away from.END OF SPOILERS:The taunt direction of Robert Zemeckis adds to the power of John Gatins script which features well drawn characters giving the actors plenty of material to work with during the film.The blu-ray looks marvelous--the transfer is sharp, filled with detail and nice, natural skin tones/color.Audio sounds terrific as well with dialogue clear throughout even during the most active sequences.We get four featurettes on the production of the film. The best piece is ""Anatomy of a Plane Crash"" that takes us behind the scenes on the stunning visual effects of the film and the on set physical effects that sell the sequence.We also get a  question and answer session done after the film was screened featuring Gatins and Zemeckis.It's a pity we don't get a commentary track for the film.This edition includes a DVD with just the feature film.Please note that ""Flight"" is rated ""R"" for nudity, language and drug use.""Flight"" is a strong film and features a great performance from Washington as well as strong support from Reilly as well as John Goodman, Tamara Tunie, Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood.",4,"""Flight"" features an Oscar quality performance from Denzel Washington",1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,1922,"['title', 'Flight', 'refers', 'much', 'more', 'flight', 'plane', 'crash', 'Captain', 'Whip', 'Whitaker', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'role', 'life.SPOILERS', 'Whip', 'flight', 'everything', 'life', 'drowned', 'drugs', 'drink', 'Whitaker', 'mechanical', 'trouble', 'routine', 'flight', 'Florida', 'Atlanta', 'plane', 'crashes', 'save', 'life', 'many', 'passengers', 'due', 'skill', 'pilot', 'Unfortunately', 'NTSB', 'investigation', 'uncovers', 'Whip', 'problem', 'putting', 'question', 'could', 'have', 'caused', 'crash', 'himself.While', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'Whip', 'meets', 'Nicole', 'Kelly', 'Rilley', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict', 'romantically', 'involved', 'life', 'take', 'dive', 'as', 'severe', 'plane', 'crash', 'walked', 'away', 'from.END', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'taunt', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'power', 'John', 'Gatins', 'script', 'well', 'drawn', 'characters', 'giving', 'actors', 'plenty', 'material', 'work', 'film.The', 'blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'transfer', 'sharp', 'filled', 'detail', 'nice', 'natural', 'skin', 'tones/color.Audio', 'terrific', 'well', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'even', 'most', 'active', 'sequences.We', 'get', 'four', 'featurettes', 'production', 'film', 'best', 'piece', 'Anatomy', 'Plane', 'Crash', 'scenes', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'film', 'set', 'physical', 'effects', 'sell', 'sequence.We', 'also', 'get', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'screened', 'featuring', 'Gatins', 'Zemeckis.It', 'pity', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'film.This', 'edition', 'DVD', 'just', 'feature', 'film.Please', 'note', 'Flight', 'rated', 'R', 'nudity', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'Flight', 'strong', 'film', 'great', 'performance', 'Washington', 'as', 'well', 'strong', 'support', 'Reilly', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Tamara', 'Tunie', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood']",Flight Combo

1609935,AP3B615GM191G,B00AF6B22E,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[13, 19]","The funny thing about the cinematic experience sometimes is that, for all that moviegoers seem to want more ""realism"" on the big screen (e.g. the dark, gritty, ""Dark Knight"" series, a movie completely steeped in reality falls a bit short. Why? Because, generally speaking, we go to the cinema to ESCAPE our own realities, not get sucked up in them once again. Thus, for all the good things that ""Flight"" accomplishes, it is just too ""grounded"" to ever real produce the kind of emotional response needed to make it truly great.For a basic plot summary (containing some minor spoilers), ""Flight"" sees pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) perform an incredible feat of flying by landing a large commercial airliner that is literally falling apart around him. The only problem? Mr. Whitaker is an alcoholic who also uses cocaine to ""rev himself back up"" and continue flying. When both substances are found on his toxicology report after the crash, Whip embarks on a personal journey that ultimately ends with him confronting his own personal demons.There are some things that this film does very well. The direction from Robert Zemeckis is sound, Denzel turns in a great performance, and the airplane sequences are absolutely captivating. The plot and auxiliary characters are also just good enough to make it a solid effort despite my biggest critique:I have never viewed a film so down-to-earth and utterly devoid of an ounce of contrived drama. Usually that is a good thing (as so many films go the opposite route), but in this case it just makes for a flick that doesn't really arouse any deep emotions or feelings towards the on-screen proceedings. Every step of Whip's journey is laid out for us, there are no surprises, and even the moments that could have been filled with drama are instead a bit anti-climactic because they have already been explained to us.Overall, then, I can't rank ""Flight"" as anything significantly better than average.

Whip Whitaker (Washington) is an alcoholic airline pilot who saves everybody's life (except four people) while trying to land a defective plane. He is also a cocaine addict. Because of the investigation, his drug addiction is revealed and we are in for a solid, amazing, and great performance from Washington that ends as expected. During the movie John Goodman's role as a drug dealer is just fabulous. He is arrogant, funny, and efficient and he is needed by the upper echelon of our society! The movie also reveals the corruption of the pilot's union who are trying to get out of the NTSB investigation by lying. It is not surprising that the union thugs will lie, will do whatever it takes to save their own, and are all corrupt. It just confirms my opinion of the unions.I am not certain that Denzel Washington will win the Oscar against Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln, or Joaquin Phoenix in the Master, but all three of them deserve it, although Lincoln is an outstanding movie and the entire cast was nominated as expected.Four stars because of Washington and Goodman and because of the music. The soundtrack is fabulous.

1609939,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B00AF6B22E,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 2]","here's a certain wobble to Denzel Washington's chin that starts to appear when he's getting emotional. He sucks it in, he juts it out. With most actors, their eyes let you know when they're feeling deeply. For Washington, it's his chin. And in ""Flight,"" for which he earned his sixth Academy Award nomination, Washington's chin works overtime.As Whip Whitaker, a cocksure but troubled pilot who wakes up to naked flight attendants, lines of cocaine and angry calls from his ex-wife before heading to the airport to get behind the controls of an airplane, Washington's chin seeks not only to convince those around him, but, ever so subtly, to convince himself of his strength and reliability.But when the flight equipment goes wonky on what should be a straightforward 52-minute stint from Orlando to Atlanta, Whitaker must seize control of both his own mind and his plane. With help from his mustachioed copilot (Brian Geraghty) and the head flight attendant, Whitaker pulls some daring steering stunts (beautifully and brutally executed by director Robert Zemeckis) and crash-lands the plane in a field, sparing the majority of those on-board a terrible death.Alas, Whip Whitaker is no Sully Sullenberger, and despite his seemingly heroic efforts, his toxicology report reveals unconscionable levels of intoxicants in his system, raising new questions. Was this crash due to equipment failure or human failure? And how much does it really matter? More importantly, how much can be proven?A big-shot lawyer from Chicago (played with a detached intensity by Don Cheadle) is sent in to protect Whitaker (and the pilot's union) from a damaging trial. Let the behind-the-scenes cover-up begin.Meanwhile, Whitaker meets a stunning junkie (played with a nice mix of grit and brokenness by Kelly Reilly) and is in the right place at the right time often enough (twice) to have her move in with him and provide him with attention, connection and a clear example of the redemptive power of self-rehabilitation.Along with composer Alan Silvestri's rich score, the film's weightier themes attempt to mask the heavy-handedness of it all, but the kind of deep-seated serendipity Zemeckis hooks into in films like ""Forrest Gump,"" ""Cast Away"" and even the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy feels too obvious here, as screenwriter John Gatins blatantly lays out our hero's path to destruction (and possible redemption) while slathering on the religious undertones.""The way you landed that lane was nothing short of a miracle,"" says one breathless friend. ""God landed that plane,"" declares another. A chain-smoking cancer patient, more plot device than actual character, appears in a hospital stairway and solemnly intones ""You're a stupid *&%#@! if you don't believe in God."" For you-know-who's sake, the wing of the plane takes out the steeple of a church before crashing in a field as a group of believers are praying.By the time ""an act of God"" has been declared as one of the probable causes of the plane crash we get the point. God's doing his very best to look out for Whip Whitaker, to warn him towards the straight and narrow. The ""Big Book"" of Alcoholics Anonymous lays it out fairly succinctly:""The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink... neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must come from a Higher Power.""All this set-up means that when Whitaker angrily claims ""I choose to drink,"" we know it's not true. He must drink. He must drink until he can face himself and face this higher power that is monkeying with his flight equipment, sacrificing innocent passengers and setting him up with hot heroin addicts. But why is that more interesting than a functioning alcoholic who actually does choose to drink? Wouldn't a twisted man who crashes a plane, sobers up enough for a phony, finagled trial and then goes unhappily on his way be fascinating?Gatins carefully carves a path from action-thriller to detective drama to character study and Washington tears admirably through all of it, his wobbly chin lending gravitas to every scene. Sure it's nice that there's a story of redemption deep down at the heart of this fast-paced and engaging film, but it feels a bit unnecessary.
