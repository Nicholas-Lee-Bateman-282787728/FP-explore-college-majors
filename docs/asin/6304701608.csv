Niedt,"[8, 12]","Imagine my sense of serendipity when, having just finished reading Jack London's classic ""Call of the Wild"" with my 9-year-old, I found this DVD release on sale for a dollar!  (Some company called Double D has just released a series of ""classic"" films, TV shows and cartoons at this rock-bottom price.)  Well, let me say it was worth the buck (pun not intended), but just barely.  My son enjoyed watching it, but mainly because he's just finished the book.  He had fun pointing out the incosistencies with the book, too.  (It only took a 9-year-old to figure that out.)  First and foremost, John Thornton becomes the main character throughout the story, rather than near the end as in the book.  (I guess Heston wanted a bigger part.)  But enough about that.  If it weren't for Heston (not my favorite actor, but by far the best one in the film), this wouldn't be worth the plastic it was burned on.  The ""international cast"" (I've learned to beware of that label ever since watching those Robert Halmi miniseries fiascos on TV) are unknowns, and rightfully so, and the dubbed-in dialogue for the foreign-speaking actors is even worse.  The soundtrack - early 70's bad electronic - is atrocious.  And the DVD was apparently copied from a scratchy print.  Lastly, as mentioned by other reviewers, this is not a film (or story, for that matter) for very young children.  There is mild profanity and moderate violence, particularly the dogfights, which were so vicious that I hope ""no animals were harmed in the making of this picture."" It desrves at least a PG.  But it is, apparently, the only version of the story on DVD (or VHS?).  So if you really want a rather bowlderized version of a classic story for a dirt-cheap price, or if you'll watch Charlton Heston in anything, by all means buy it.(P.S.: If you want to see a Jack London tale done well, buy or rent the 1991 film ""White Fang"", starring Ethan Hawke and Klaus Maria Brandauer.)",2,"Heston Saves It from Being a Total...

In his acting--can't say a bad thing about him.I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for the longest time, so why haven't I gotten it yet? Guess I'm waiting for the right time.

This one's just for me, dispite the it's somewhat an oldie, sort of--in a way, from my point of view.But in Call of the Wild, it really isn't Heston that's the star, it's the dog who potrays Buck. He's the one who more or less, 'runs away with show/bone', so to speak. Early on in the film, Buck feet bleeds and is made booties until he can take the pace. And after a while Buck prooves he can stand on his own; his love for John is unyielding. Between man & dog, it is a powerful story; what a man won't do for a dog and what a dog won't do for a man.

Silly acting, weak photography, and a mediocre script that only sparks when it turns violent and nasty. In Charlton Heston's thoughtful 'In the Arena' autobiography, he considers this film ""a total failure"". He may not know good politics, but he has enough taste and sense to avoid film debacles most actors of his age have lived off for decades. So if Chuck actually writes ""please don't watch this"", listen to the man. Or listen to Paramount Studios, which shelved this film after they saw it.""The Call of the Wild"" is not unwatchable, but it's bad enough, one of the worst movies in Heston's career. Place this on the Turkey shelf next to Heston's equally bad ""The Awakening"", a ridiculous 1980 Exorcist/Omen knockoff. I haven't read Jack London's book, but this movie seems, um, a very loose adaptation.The extras in the Alaska town are played by an assortment of German/Italian/British/American/Spanish actors, mostly overdubbed. What gems they say: one jumps onto a bicycle and yells ""Yippee! Yippeeeee!"" (Note: ""Yippee!"" will never be acceptable in a Hollywood script, and is punishable if done in real-life.) Heston's human co-star runs into that same town, yelling ""Hi! Hi! Hi!"" like a stoner coming down from the mountain commune. If all of the movie was as corny as the townspeople, we might have had a comedy for the ages. Alas.As amusing as the vomiting town drunkard was, it was Charlton Heston, always a powerful presence, who kept me watching. He looks a little grumpier than usual, perhaps he noticed that the many wolves in the film are actually hybrid dogs that don't look much like North American wolves. However, his scenes with Buck are touching, against all odds and logic. I never thought of actors having on-screen chemistry with animals, but Heston proves it does exist. Those scenes keep the film from being a complete waste of film stock, but there aren't nearly enough of them.Still, this dull film contains one classic Chuck Heston line - words he was born to speak: ""Mister, if you touch that dog again I'm gonna shoot ya!""
