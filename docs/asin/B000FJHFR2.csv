Much as I love my normal teacher, Neon, she's tiny and it's hard for me to know if i'm doing something exactly correct because it looks different on someone who is bigger.I loved the way the sections were broken down, she has a lot of good information to cover and it all adds to my dance repertoire.Cons:Poor Jehan, she isn't much of a teacher, at least not for me. She is a good dancer, but her teaching side is a bit lacking. If I hadn't been working with Neon already, I would have been totally lost here. I wouldn't know how anything was supposed to feel on my body or where I was to be tightening up, or relaxing, or anything. There is very little explanation on moves. She does them and tells you to practice on your own time. Now certainly the DVD could get better I only did disc one at the time of this review.It seemed like she was uncomfortable doing this as well. She stuttered through some instruction. I think it might have been better for me if she had someone else narrate for her and just let her be the on screen talent as it were.",3,A dancers take,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1321,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'dancer', 'awhile', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'one', 'said', 'anything', 'DVD', 'beginners', ""n't"", 'really', 'beginner.The', 'Pros', 'have', 'admit', 'i', ""'m"", 'bigger', 'dancer', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'move', 'should', 'look', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'size', '0-4', 'Much', 'love', 'normal', 'teacher', 'Neon', 'tiny', 'hard', 'know', 'i', ""'m"", 'doing', 'something', 'exactly', 'correct', 'different', 'someone', 'who', 'bigger.I', 'loved', 'way', 'sections', 'were', 'broken', 'down', 'lot', 'good', 'information', 'cover', 'dance', 'repertoire.Cons', 'Poor', 'Jehan', ""n't"", 'much', 'teacher', 'least', 'not', 'good', 'dancer', 'teaching', 'side', 'bit', 'lacking', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'working', 'Neon', 'already', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'lost', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'anything', 'was', 'supposed', 'feel', 'body', 'where', 'was', 'be', 'tightening', 'up', 'relaxing', 'anything', 'very', 'little', 'explanation', 'moves', 'tells', 'practice', 'own', 'time', 'Now', 'certainly', 'DVD', 'could', 'get', 'better', 'only', 'did', 'disc', 'one', 'time', 'review.It', 'seemed', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'doing', 'as', 'well', 'stuttered', 'instruction', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'someone', 'else', 'narrate', 'just', 'let', 'be', 'screen', 'talent', 'were']",Sacred Bellydance

Jehan's set of two DVDs was recommended to me by the belly dancers I admire most. Learning by-video-only I wanted to somehow get a fraction of the sensuality with which they dance.Having reached somewhere with the isolations you need for this amazing dance, and dabbled with basic combinations and choreography, I wanted to be able to do the serpentine and flowing movements I've seen. You freeze the frame at any time---and the dancer will be in a pose that any statue would be happy to be in.From the very first run through of the DVDs (I sat and watched both at one go for about 3 hours) I agreed this was the right choice. Sacred Bellydance is supposed to be level one of  encyclopedia, but rather than being just a reference it teaches you the fundamentals in a complete manner. Jehan's voice-over instructions, as she leads you through the moves unhurriedly, tells you what muscles to use, what to emphasise, and even what to feel. Even if you've learnt the moves before, you begin to do them in a whole new way. For example, I've worked on snake arms (the lovely S shaped arm moves in belly dance) before, but she tells you how to begin the movement from the very base of your spine. This not only makes it more complete but it feels pleasurable and less of a strain to do.The two discs are replete with moves, examples of how to use them, the feeling they generate, culture related information, and beautiful oriental poses. The slow pace of the instruction gives you plenty of time to examine and understand the technique and then rewind and dance along.Jehan seems to be fairly spiritually inclined and this is evident in almost every part of the instruction and explanation. Although I am not, I think the attitude does enhance the dance moves to make them more meaningful and intense.The one thing that confuses me a little is what level of dancer it's meant for. I suppose just as regular encyclopedias are meant for everyone, so is a dance encyclopedia. I don't know if it would be sensible to begin belly dancing using this set of DVDs because I was glad I had been through precise instruction on isolations separately and welcome this instruction as the next step in making each of those isolations look like a dance move in the way I want most. Personally, I would say learn isolations and use this as a companion to refine and perfect and also to dance with easy sensuousness and pleasure.What's on the DVDsDisc 1A visually rich introductionA ""body prayer""Breathing and beautiful stretchesHip circles--specially the luscious large hip circleFoot stretchesFluidity exercises and posesArms and hand movementsWhole body undulationsInfinity loopsVariations on hip circlesShoulders and chest movementsShimmies and vibrationsDisc 2Hip lifts, drops, accents, twistsPractice for hip combinationsPelvic contraction and releaseTwo sections on walksArm circlesIntro to veil workIntro to cymbalsEverything down to the tilt of the head is explained. The production quality is okay--not thrilling but good enough. Everything is visible enough but not crackling and crisp. The sheer amount of instruction and content, about three hours of it, on these two discs is phenomenal. Specially for the price. I bought it at a higher price before it became available here and even at that price, considered it worthwhile. The one wonderful thing about this ""encyclopedia"" is that equips and encourages you to put your own combinations together and be your own choreographer. Your body is the temple--and dance is your prayer.

991699,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B000FJHFR2,atisheh,"[16, 16]","I bought this DVD set on the recommendations of other reviewers (like Mala), so in a sense, this review should be superfluous. However, I wanted to write one anyway for two reasons: first, to convince people who might be turned off by certain aspects of Jehan's belief system that they have something to gain from this video, and second, to add a few notes about who I think this set is good for.First, the ""sacred"" stuff. If it's your bag, great. If, like me, you're pretty convinced you're not a goddess (just a decent human being), you might be turned off by Jehan's beliefs -- which do, indeed, come up throughout the video. I urge you to overcome this aversion. It's a great video, and you don't have to pay attention during the goddess stuff. On the other hand, I also have to say that I respect Jehan because I get the sense that she is communicating something she believes deeply, not just putting on a trendy pose. And her positive remarks on women really are pretty appropriate for bellydance!Now, who is this video for? I actually wouldn't recommend it for learning the basic dance moves, but I think it's great once you already know the moves, and want to add finesse, power, and expressiveness to them. If you want to work on your arms, following along with Jehan's flowing movements is great. (And your arms will HURT, incidentally. In a good way.)The brilliance of the video is that, although it's an ""encyclopedia,"" the segments flow together nicely. For this reason, I've used it more as a stretching workout than to learn from. And here is why I want to suggest that EVERYONE, dancer or not, buy this video. If you have been sitting in a chair for too long, if your body is tired and tense, Sacred Bellydance is amazing at stretching and relaxing it all out. And not just the back and arms -- the neck, fingers, hands, feet, toes, everything! I've pretty much only used Sacred Bellydance in this way, and it makes me feel amazing.One final thing. Although bellydancers come in all shapes and sizes, the ones publishing videos are usually on the commercially thin side. Jehan is a womanly woman, and I think this is important. You might feel more comfortable watching her if your body is like hers, but more importantly, it's good to see how correct posture looks on a body which is rounded... well, where women's bodies *should* be rounded.",5,Surpringly wonderful!,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2358,"['bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'recommendations', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Mala', 'so', 'sense', 'review', 'should', 'be', 'superfluous', 'However', 'wanted', 'write', 'one', 'anyway', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'convince', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Jehan', 'belief', 'system', 'have', 'something', 'gain', 'video', 'second', 'add', 'few', 'notes', 'who', 'think', 'set', 'good', 'for.First', 'sacred', 'stuff', 'bag', 'great', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'convinced', ""'re"", 'not', 'goddess', 'just', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'Jehan', 'beliefs', 'do', 'indeed', 'come', 'up', 'video', 'urge', 'overcome', 'aversion', 'great', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'goddess', 'stuff', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'respect', 'Jehan', 'get', 'sense', 'communicating', 'something', 'deeply', 'not', 'just', 'putting', 'trendy', 'pose', 'positive', 'remarks', 'women', 'really', 'are', 'pretty', 'appropriate', 'bellydance', 'Now', 'who', 'video', 'actually', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'learning', 'basic', 'dance', 'moves', 'think', 'great', 'once', 'already', 'know', 'moves', 'want', 'add', 'finesse', 'power', 'expressiveness', 'want', 'work', 'arms', 'following', 'along', 'Jehan', 'flowing', 'movements', 'great', 'arms', 'will', 'HURT', 'incidentally', 'good', 'way', 'brilliance', 'video', 'encyclopedia', 'segments', 'flow', 'together', 'nicely', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'used', 'more', 'stretching', 'workout', 'learn', 'here', 'why', 'want', 'suggest', 'EVERYONE', 'dancer', 'not', 'buy', 'video', 'have', 'been', 'sitting', 'chair', 'too', 'long', 'body', 'tired', 'tense', 'Sacred', 'Bellydance', 'amazing', 'stretching', 'relaxing', 'out', 'not', 'just', 'back', 'arms', 'neck', 'fingers', 'hands', 'feet', 'toes', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'used', 'Sacred', 'Bellydance', 'way', 'feel', 'amazing.One', 'final', 'thing', 'bellydancers', 'come', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'ones', 'publishing', 'videos', 'are', 'usually', 'commercially', 'thin', 'side', 'Jehan', 'womanly', 'woman', 'think', 'important', 'might', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'body', 'hers', 'more', 'importantly', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'correct', 'posture', 'body', 'rounded', 'well', 'where', 'women', 'bodies', '*should*', 'be', 'rounded']",Sacred Bellydance

991701,A21BJRAY0I5WM9,B000FJHFR2,Eden Russell,"[52, 52]","I have to admit this DVD set was very low on my ""I want to get"" list for a long while because the title and the whole Temple of Jehan concept made me think it would have more neo-pagan elements than I could handle. I'm glad a friend of mine was intrigued by it and I paid closer attention to the details and other people's reviews which helped a lot. Unfortunately a good number of times have totally betrayed my high expectations of them because the descriptions sounded great and the content was cheesy. Besides, I already have a good number of instructional DVDs and I think it pointless to spend my money on yet another program that would teach me figure 8s and hip lifts. This set isn't the cheapest on the market and as I buyer I want to optimize my modest budget. However, the final decision was made when I considered that for run time of more than THREE HOURS this set would have at least one hour of useful information.I'm so glad I made this purchase. It's the most systematic, informative and inclusive set I've ever seen on the market. There are 2 disks included, each one about an hour and a half, both of them with excellent instruction and good quality. This is really outstanding value for my money.The setting is very pleasant, Jehan is in a small room with white curtains behind her back. She is an excellent dancer, very well proportioned with rounded hips which is great to watch (unlike some really skinny bellydancers who intimidate me as I'm a plump girl). She has a semi-transparent skirt reaching her calves and opens to the front, so when you need to see her legs and knees, she pulls it aside. Her feet can be seen at all times as well which is extremely important for weight shifts.There is a menu available that lets you choose which part you'd like to play. You can also skip to the next chapter if you want to see that instead. Jehan teaches very well even though she doesn't go into endless explanations. She points out the essentials while showing the move. Even though usually I don't enjoy voice-over she does it with seamless precision and it works very well.As I mentioned above, I was afraid to purchase a product that would show me the same old stuff only with a new face. At this point I consider myself intermediate, so that was a good possibility. This DVD was of particular use to me because it helped me correct some previous flaws in my technique I couldn't quite put a finger to before. The set is good for total beginners since all basic moves are shown with excellent instruction but it's even better for those who have a bit of previous basic experience. Even advanced dancers will probably find new things in this set. The way Jehan does it is first she shows the basic move, gives it some repetition, all that with explanation, then adds variations and combinations. In other words a beginner would first want to see the basic moves, then when she feels comfortable enough, can proceed to the layering and combinations still using the same DVD. This set has at least a couple of months packed in content.What I find of *particular use* is the second disk with its long section of practice, walks and traveling steps. Unfortunately this is a section very poorly presented in a lot of instructional DVDs. Nothing is worse than learning a bunch of steps, mastering them, then asking oneself, ""how do I string these up now?!"". I haven't seen many of her walks and steps anywhere else and I like all of them.The intro to veils and cymbals is indeed just an intro - to give you a feel of these two. If you need more detailed props instruction you should check out something else as well.To sum up, as a proud owner of over 15 DVDs, this is one of my top 3 favorite together with Jenna's Heartbeat of Bellydance and Leyla Jouvana's 21 shimmies DVD. It's worth every cent I paid for it, longest run time ever, great music (mid-eastern tunes), excellent structure and instruction and good quality.The only thing I didn't like really was the performance at the end of the second disk. Given the quality of moves she teaches she could have created a much more impressive choreography. There are movements when she wallows on the floor and at some points the camera is focused on her vibrating loins which I found in bad taste. This is only my humble opinion.I heartily recommend this DVD to everyone, beginner, intermidiate, even advanced. I'm very happy with it and I think everyone else would be as well. :-)",5,Quality and Quantity,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,4451,"['have', 'admit', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'want', 'get', 'list', 'long', 'while', 'title', 'whole', 'Temple', 'Jehan', 'concept', 'made', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'neo-pagan', 'elements', 'could', 'handle', ""'m"", 'glad', 'friend', 'mine', 'was', 'intrigued', 'paid', 'closer', 'attention', 'details', 'other', 'people', 'reviews', 'helped', 'lot', 'Unfortunately', 'good', 'number', 'times', 'have', 'totally', 'betrayed', 'high', 'expectations', 'descriptions', 'sounded', 'great', 'content', 'was', 'cheesy', 'already', 'have', 'good', 'number', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'think', 'spend', 'money', 'yet', 'program', 'would', 'teach', 'figure', '8s', 'hip', 'lifts', 'set', ""n't"", 'cheapest', 'market', 'buyer', 'want', 'optimize', 'modest', 'budget', 'However', 'final', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'considered', 'run', 'time', 'more', 'THREE', 'HOURS', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'hour', 'useful', 'information.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'made', 'purchase', 'most', 'systematic', 'informative', 'inclusive', 'set', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'market', 'are', '2', 'disks', 'included', 'one', 'hour', 'half', 'excellent', 'instruction', 'good', 'quality', 'really', 'outstanding', 'value', 'money.The', 'setting', 'very', 'pleasant', 'Jehan', 'small', 'room', 'white', 'curtains', 'back', 'excellent', 'dancer', 'very', 'well', 'proportioned', 'rounded', 'hips', 'great', 'watch', 'really', 'skinny', 'bellydancers', 'who', 'intimidate', ""'m"", 'plump', 'girl', 'semi-transparent', 'skirt', 'reaching', 'calves', 'front', 'so', 'when', 'need', 'see', 'legs', 'knees', 'aside', 'feet', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'times', 'well', 'extremely', 'important', 'weight', 'menu', 'available', 'choose', 'part', ""'d"", 'like', 'play', 'can', 'also', 'skip', 'next', 'chapter', 'want', 'see', 'instead', 'Jehan', 'very', 'well', 'even', ""n't"", 'go', 'endless', 'explanations', 'out', 'essentials', 'showing', 'move', 'Even', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'voice-over', 'seamless', 'precision', 'very', 'well.As', 'mentioned', 'was', 'afraid', 'purchase', 'product', 'would', 'show', 'same', 'old', 'stuff', 'only', 'new', 'face', 'point', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'was', 'good', 'possibility', 'DVD', 'was', 'particular', 'use', 'helped', 'correct', 'previous', 'flaws', 'technique', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'set', 'good', 'total', 'beginners', 'basic', 'moves', 'are', 'shown', 'excellent', 'instruction', 'even', 'better', 'who', 'have', 'bit', 'previous', 'basic', 'experience', 'Even', 'advanced', 'dancers', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'new', 'things', 'set', 'way', 'Jehan', 'first', 'basic', 'move', 'repetition', 'explanation', 'then', 'variations', 'combinations', 'other', 'words', 'beginner', 'would', 'first', 'want', 'see', 'basic', 'moves', 'then', 'when', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'can', 'proceed', 'layering', 'combinations', 'still', 'using', 'same', 'DVD', 'set', 'least', 'couple', 'months', 'packed', 'content.What', 'find', '*particular', 'use*', 'second', 'disk', 'long', 'section', 'practice', 'walks', 'traveling', 'steps', 'Unfortunately', 'section', 'very', 'poorly', 'presented', 'lot', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'Nothing', 'worse', 'learning', 'bunch', 'steps', 'mastering', 'then', 'asking', 'how', 'do', 'string', 'up', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'walks', 'steps', 'anywhere', 'else', 'like', 'them.The', 'intro', 'veils', 'cymbals', 'indeed', 'just', 'intro', 'give', 'feel', 'two', 'need', 'more', 'detailed', 'props', 'instruction', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'something', 'else', 'well.To', 'sum', 'up', 'proud', 'owner', '15', 'DVDs', 'one', 'top', '3', 'favorite', 'together', 'Jenna', 'Heartbeat', 'Bellydance', 'Leyla', 'Jouvana', '21', 'shimmies', 'DVD', 'worth', 'cent', 'paid', 'longest', 'run', 'time', 'ever', 'great', 'music', 'mid-eastern', 'tunes', 'excellent', 'structure', 'instruction', 'good', 'quality.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'really', 'was', 'performance', 'end', 'second', 'disk', 'Given', 'quality', 'moves', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'choreography', 'are', 'movements', 'when', 'floor', 'points', 'camera', 'focused', 'vibrating', 'loins', 'found', 'bad', 'taste', 'only', 'humble', 'opinion.I', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'beginner', 'intermidiate', 'even', 'advanced', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'think', 'everyone', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'well']",Sacred Bellydance
991702,AEV6T72PZFEHX,B000FJHFR2,"Ettell ""ettell""","[10, 14]","I would suggest that whether in a class or learning on one's own, Jehan's Sacred belly Dance, Level One is an excellent guide and companion.For a beginner such as myself, learning on my own, I have found everything that I need in here:  breathing, posture, stretching exercises, fluidity and muscle-toning tips, variations on each theme, moves from head to toe and advice to end each set in an elegant pose right from the start!I own 4 other instructional Belly Dance DVDs and I would say that what Jehan's encyclopedia has over them is DEPTH.One could argue that there is a bit too much bare flesh - Jehan could have worn a pair of stretch pants underneath her skirts, but I suppose Jehan is completely at ease with her body, whatever anyone else might think.I have no idea what Jehan's age is. At first, she looked to me like a 50-year old lady with too much lipstick. As the video progresses, however, she appeared to be around 35, then 25 then 15.  I tried to make sense of this, for neither she nor her make-up had changed. I can only surmise that as she conscientiously reveals her secrets to us, the beauty of her spirit shines through, rendering her ageless.First, I watched the whole video through, and at the end, I had a strange feeling of having visited a holy place...I think Jehan was neither being pompous nor presumptuous when she named her art ""Sacred"", for she has succeeded in presenting this dance (scantily clad as she is) in what I would describe as a reverential manner.Excellent! Well done, Jehan!To conclude, I would say, if you are thinking of buying just one instructional DVD, this is definitely the one to go for.

This is not a video that will completely break each thing down, though I felt that Jehan took her time explaining each movement. What I really enjoyed was her variations of each movement. Demonstrating the movements in their most basic form and transitioning into a wider varitey of form and expression using different arm poses and pathways, different angles, traveling, and level changes. I personally love her form of expression with a lot of the movements. She shows you how clean and beautiful a movement can look if it is not rushed, but felt, deep down inside. This is a beautiful demonstration of transitioning between beggining dance and learning to feel what we are doing so that the artistry and expression can be shared.I am really liking these excyclopedia videos. I pick one thing i really like out of a video and encorprate it into my practices, when I have it in my muscle memory and it is a part of me, I go back for something else.

I saw women of all shapes and sizes.  I did not see any ultra-skinny women.  (I have to wonder if they are not attracted to belly dancing for some particular reason.)2.  You will see cabaret-performance scenes, which appear to have been filmed live as opposed to a staged studio performance.3.  Jehan's voice is calm yet authoritative with the instructions.  She has an American accent, which is to be expected as she was born in the U.S. according to her biography.  (Other DVD reviews in this genre were critical of not being able to understand the instructor.)4.  I did not feel rushed or like I was trying to ""win a race"".5.  Due to the individual dancer preferences, you will see several types of costumes if you aren't sure what to buy.  (I have looked online at ""American Fantasy"" (i.e. anything goes), Tribal, Egyptian, and Turkish belly dance costumes.)I really like Jehan even though her set was a little more expensive than some others, but then again there are 2 DVDs instead of one.  I would also recommend taking a look at Jenna (the Sex Goddess from Sex in the City).",5,The Encyclopedia of Belly Dance,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1323,"['described', 'intro', 'encyclopedia', 'belly', 'dance', 'seem', 'be', 'true', '2', 'DVD', 'set.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'repeat', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'so', 'will', 'just', 'mention', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'important.1', 'saw', 'women', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'ultra-skinny', 'women', 'have', 'wonder', 'are', 'not', 'attracted', 'belly', 'dancing', 'particular', 'reason.', '2', 'will', 'see', 'cabaret-performance', 'scenes', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'live', 'opposed', 'staged', 'studio', 'performance.3', 'Jehan', 'voice', 'calm', 'yet', 'authoritative', 'instructions', 'American', 'accent', 'be', 'expected', 'was', 'born', 'U.S.', 'according', 'biography', 'Other', 'DVD', 'reviews', 'genre', 'were', 'critical', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'instructor.', '4', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'rushed', 'was', 'trying', 'win', 'race', '.5', 'Due', 'individual', 'dancer', 'preferences', 'will', 'see', 'several', 'types', 'costumes', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'buy', 'have', 'looked', 'online', 'American', 'Fantasy', 'i.e', 'anything', 'Tribal', 'Egyptian', 'Turkish', 'belly', 'dance', 'costumes', 'really', 'Jehan', 'even', 'set', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'expensive', 'others', 'then', 'again', 'are', '2', 'DVDs', 'instead', 'one', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'taking', 'look', 'Jenna', 'Sex', 'Goddess', 'Sex', 'City']",Sacred Bellydance

So, here's my take on this DVD on a one to five scale one is blah and five fabulous.5- Visuals; good nothing distraction and can see legs5-Bang for buck is outstanding5-replayability is also outstanding5-  costumes:  loved them very sexy5- instructor likability, she seemed to enjoy the dance; most of this dvd if not all is in voice over5- thoroughness of instruction; as others have mentioned from arms to hips, to traveling, veil, posture, belly dance history is covered.I have tons of belly dance DVD.

I like how she doesn't dissect things to the point where you can't foresee what you trying to do.  She does the movements up to speed, slows a little, but for the most part you have every idea of what you are trying to do and that, in my opinion, is more helpful than drastic breakdowns.
