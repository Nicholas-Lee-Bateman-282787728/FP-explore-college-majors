900564,A2B1KCDHHB1TIX,B00092ZMDY,,"[6, 6]","Before sitting down to watch NBC's broadcast of the show I was a bit apprehensive.  Having flown out to Colorado to see Crosby, Stills and Nash this past summer and being completely disappointed and disillusioned I was hoping for the best in seeing another of my all time favorites.  I didn't want to have my bubble bursted again by seeing a similar disappointing show of out of key vocals and forgotten lyrics.Believe me when I say  I was not disappointed, as a matter of fact it was one of the best shows I've seen in years.  Having seen the Eagles 3 times in their hay day and owning all of their albums thats right albums not cd's, it was like a refreshing journey back to my youth.The harmonies were studio quality, the bridges were right on and the riffs and timing of the songs were exactly as I remembered them.  From Frey and Henley's strong vocals to Walsh's picture perfect licks this is truly one of the all time great performances. You can't help but sing along with every song and let yourself drift back in time.Two thumbs up!!!

You would think that at this point they might just mail it in, but they give an absolutely electric performance.  Don Henley is just amazing.  His voice is stellar, although his rendition of ""Hotel California"" seemed just slightly off.  Maybe if they had put it earlier in the concert instead of at the end, his voice would have been more fresh.  But he hits everything else just right. Glenn Frey is great too. Yeah, he's got a few corny jokes, such as dedicating ""Lyin Eyes"" to his ex wife, Plaintiff. (Get it?) His version of ""Already Gone"" is just amazing. Although he looks kind of silly dancing while Henley sings ""All She Wants to Do is Dance.""  I also gained new appreciation for Timothy B. Schmit.  People rag on him all the time that he's not a ""real"" Eagle and not as good as Randy Meisner, but I think he definitely holds his own.  ""Love Will Keep Us Alive"" is such a beautiful song.  And no Don Felder - who cares!  Steuart Smith proves to be a more than capable replacement. There are also some funny outtakes at the end of the second disc, especially one involving Don Henley and his guitar.

Unfortunately their success drove the other 50% of the band away. Ever since its been a Don Henley/Glen Frey solo project with whomever to help out with the instruments. Don and Glen are great, don't get me wrong. Love them! But please don't call this outfit The Eagles. The real Eagles, the four guys who wrote and recorded virtually all of their trademark songs, were Henley and Frey and Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon. The Eagles name was made by these four - in fact it was Bernie who came up with the name. After Bernie and Randy left the other two had every right to carry on performing the songs they wrote; they should have come up with a new band name. I just don't think it's right for other musicians to cash in on the work and the name of other people. (I will applaud Timothy B. Schmidt for paying tribute to Randy Meisner when the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Randy was really moved by that gesture and it shows what a class act Timothy is.) Anyway, there have been lots of great old bands carrying on with new people under the old name, and I have never been okay with this. Great new musicians should have their own band name and let people judge them on their owm merits.

But watching this is kinda like waiting in the waiting lounge at the doctors office.  It's not every exciting, in facts it very boring and you cant wait to get the hell outta there.  OK, so the band sounds great, and all members are still at the top of their game, however its just all seems too sterile for me.  It's like watching a Fleetwood Mac concert from 2004 as apposed to 1979.  The 2004 version has the classic line up (except 1 Christine McVie) and a bazillion other musicians on stage trying desperately to re-create that studio sound.  Thats the same thing here. It's all calculated, cued, perfectly executed rock that is never outta tune, messed up or spontaneous.  While Fleetwood Mac has still retained some of their spontinuity, thanks heavily to Lindsey's atmospheric guitar jammimg,  the Eagles just Take It Easy, literally.  It's like their all  playing on auto pilot.  Yeah, that new guy on guitar, Steuart whachamacallhim is good, of course he would be, and yeah, he nails all on Don Felder's solo perfectly, but isn't that what he's suppose to do and suppose to play. I'm glad these guys are still around, especially Joe Walsh, but c'mon, I'd rather see (and hear) the Bomber (aka Joe walsh) perform solo than with the Eagles. It's more risky and exciting.  Joe Walsh is a clown in concert, and he use to be like that with the Eagles, but now he's just takes it one day at a time.  Like I first mentioned, I like the Eagles, they were exciting live when it was just the 5  guys on stage jamming, and probably under some kind of influence.

Finally a DVD release from a band with a peerless catalogue which doesn't skimp on material - on Farewell 1, they give you EVERYTHING - I can guarantee you, that was played at this concert.The sound is superb, the filming appears to have been done on HD which works fine; the look is filmy - not harsh like older video formats. This concert's material is perfectly chosen - I can't think of any track that I would have wished for - maybe 'Pretty Maids in a Row' but you can always run back to your copy of 'Hell Freezes Over' for that. Everyone is in great voice - it's nice to see Glen Frey taking his rightful place as band leader - he looks like he's having a ball - as if it's all new for him again. 'Take it to the Limit' is absolutely superb, even without Randy Meisner. You don't exactly miss Don Felder's presence although I think the extra 10% of having his wonderful touch on the guitars would've been the icing on the cake. They appear to be very unified without him though so maybe this is the only way it works for the band. Lots of terrific tracks from the solo careers - particularly Henly. Joe Walsh has a day out, playing crankin' solos and clowning around. 'Life's been good' has been needed sorely on DVD for years. 3 hours of vintage Eagles, beautifully played, very faithful to recorded versions, perfect harmonies - what more could you ask for? I was aware of some criticisms here of overuse of fiddle on the arrangements. I disagree. The arrangements are excellent and the fiddle is tastefully used and faithful to the feel of every song in which it features. Just purists who can't open their minds, even a little!

For those few Eagles fans on here, if you do not have that disc from this 2004 concert, released in 2005, you really ought to get it.Unlike Hell Freezes Over from five years earlier, the Eagles have hit stride, and they are more forgiving in letting each member shine individually:No More Cloudy Days (New Track), Hole In the World (new), You Belong to the City, Walk Away, Rocky Mountain Way, Sunset Grill, Life's Been Good, Dirty Laundry, are some of the tunes.  Joe Walsh really is a guitar God.  And it shows on this DVD.Also, it is after they kicked--for no good reason at all--original guitarist Don Felder out of the group. On this disc, a fellow that looks like a hatchet-faced greaseball in an oversize Texas roadsuit plays the lead guitar with gusto and vigor, note-for-note like Donnie Felder. And this is crucial as (trivia bomb) the Eagles feature two songs with the very uncommon guitar solo outtro (end of the song) with Life in The Fast Lane and Hotel California--check it out next time you listen to those cuts. The Eagles stil soar without Felder, and by tossing just a few sheckles into this studio journeyman's Fedora, the remaining Eagles split the cash cow in fewer pie pieces.  Ingenious.The Long Road to Eden, available only from the Walton family, is a sad countrified piece of grisle compared to this juicy concert from yesteryear.

They rocked the house better than any band I'd ever seen up too and beyond that point. The song selection was fantastic, Don Felder was still with the band, they didn't ""dumb down"" their material by injection a horn section and overplaying the weak solo material. When Joe Walsh played ""Funk 49"", ""In the City"" and ""Walk Away"", it was ROCKIN'!This show is completely different and not in a good way.The lack of Don Felder in the band really, really shows. The tunes that used to really rock, are now ""pop synthesized"" so often, that it no longer has the weight that the old songs used to have. It's like they decided to intentionally make it easy listening instead of crankin' it up and just jammin' like they used to. It's so obviously the Glenn Frey/Don Henley show, with Schmidt and Walsh as supporting cast, that it takes away the ""band"" feel of the show.This show was way too contrived, with an obvious agenda towards appealing to the pompous and the yuppies who weren't cool in the 70's and 80's, but who can now afford a ticket to one of the most expensive concerts on the planet. Corporate sell out at it's finest.And by the way..... the guitarist who ""replaced"" Don Felder, and I use that word lightly, does not hold a candle to Don Felder as a guitarist.

900614,A3PGGPL7FM9F81,B00092ZMDY,Docendo Discimus,"[7, 10]","...so what's with the four stars?Well, I happen to think that the Eagles were one of the three best American rock bands of the 70s. One of the best of all time, in fact. And this concert proves once again how timeless most of their music was and how well it has stood the test of time. (Their new album is pathetic and a blemish on their record, but the old stuff is great...)Anyway. There are plenty of highlights on this lenghty two-disc concert recording. Tremendous renditions of songs like ""Heartache Tonight"", ""New Kid In Town"", ""Desperado"" and ""One Of These Nights"". And Don Felder's replacement, lead guitarist Steuart Smith, is magnificent.But I don't love the arrangements. The blaring, monotonous horn section threatens to drown out everything else...most of these songs obviously weren't written with a horn section in mind, and the grotesque trumpet solos on the otherwise lovely ""Tequila Sunrise"" are an abomination.There are too many slick synthesizers and 80s-style keyboards here, and it makes some of the songs sound badly dated...especially the ones from Don Henley's solo albums. And what's with that utterly bizarre violin droning away on ""Already Gone""?!Sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?Well, it really isn't. The horns only marr the outro to ""Hotel California"", not the song itself, and they are completely absent on several songs, as is the violin. Don Henley is fantastic on the slowies ""Desperado"" and ""Wasted Time"", and Glenn Frey does a terrific ""Lyin' Eyes"". And Joe Walsh's new song, the highly personal ""One Day At A Time"" is a must-hear, one of the best songs of the entire set.Walsh, the only showman of the lot, also clowns around in his most charming fashion on an enjoyable ""Life's Been Good So Far"", and his vocals are stronger than ever...he hits the high notes with impressive ease, sounding better than he did on 1994's ""Hell Freezes Over"".The Eagles can't quite make Walsh's ""Walk Away"" or ""Funk #49"" sound convincing, but they do a great ""Boys Of Summer"" (the mid-80s Don Henley-single), and a lovely rendition of their newest single, the gospel-like ""Hole In The World"". And I can't get over how great guitarist Steuart Smith is...his guitar sounds much better and more smooth than Joe Walsh's sometimes metallic-sounding Stratocaster, and he plays every fill and every solo to perfection.So, a lot of good here and some minor annoyances as well. The horn section should have been left at home, and solo violins don't belong in hard rock. But fans will most certainly want a look anyway, and most of this DVD is a very fine testament to the longevity of the Eagles and the immense quality of their music.",4,"Great music, great sound, great picture...",1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2644,"['so', 'what', 'four', 'stars', 'Well', 'happen', 'think', 'Eagles', 'were', 'one', 'three', 'best', 'American', 'rock', 'bands', '70s', 'One', 'best', 'time', 'fact', 'concert', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'timeless', 'most', 'music', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'new', 'album', 'pathetic', 'blemish', 'record', 'old', 'stuff', 'great', 'Anyway', 'are', 'plenty', 'highlights', 'lenghty', 'two-disc', 'concert', 'recording', 'Tremendous', 'renditions', 'songs', 'Heartache', 'Tonight', 'New', 'Kid', 'Town', 'Desperado', 'One', 'Nights', 'Don', 'Felder', 'replacement', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Steuart', 'Smith', 'magnificent.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'arrangements', 'blaring', 'monotonous', 'horn', 'section', 'drown', 'out', 'everything', 'else', 'most', 'songs', 'obviously', 'were', ""n't"", 'written', 'horn', 'section', 'mind', 'grotesque', 'trumpet', 'solos', 'otherwise', 'lovely', 'Tequila', 'Sunrise', 'are', 'abomination.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'slick', 'synthesizers', '80s-style', 'keyboards', 'here', 'songs', 'sound', 'badly', 'dated', 'especially', 'ones', 'Don', 'Henley', 'solo', 'albums', 'what', 'utterly', 'bizarre', 'violin', 'droning', 'away', 'Already', 'Gone', 'pretty', 'bad', ""n't"", 'Well', 'really', ""n't"", 'horns', 'only', 'marr', 'outro', 'Hotel', 'California', 'not', 'song', 'are', 'completely', 'absent', 'several', 'songs', 'violin', 'Don', 'Henley', 'fantastic', 'slowies', 'Desperado', 'Wasted', 'Time', 'Glenn', 'Frey', 'terrific', 'Lyin', 'Eyes', 'Joe', 'Walsh', 'new', 'song', 'highly', 'personal', 'One', 'Day', 'A', 'Time', 'must-hear', 'one', 'best', 'songs', 'entire', 'set.Walsh', 'only', 'showman', 'lot', 'also', 'clowns', 'around', 'most', 'charming', 'fashion', 'enjoyable', 'Life', 'Been', 'Good', 'So', 'Far', 'vocals', 'are', 'stronger', 'ever', 'high', 'notes', 'impressive', 'ease', 'sounding', 'better', 'did', '1994', 'Hell', 'Freezes', 'Over', '.The', 'Eagles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'Walsh', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Funk', '49', 'sound', 'convincing', 'do', 'great', 'Boys', 'Summer', 'mid-80s', 'Don', 'Henley-single', 'lovely', 'rendition', 'newest', 'single', 'gospel-like', 'Hole', 'World', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'great', 'guitarist', 'Steuart', 'Smith', 'guitar', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'smooth', 'Joe', 'Walsh', 'sometimes', 'metallic-sounding', 'Stratocaster', 'fill', 'solo', 'perfection.So', 'lot', 'good', 'here', 'minor', 'annoyances', 'as', 'well', 'horn', 'section', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'home', 'solo', 'violins', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'hard', 'rock', 'fans', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'want', 'look', 'anyway', 'most', 'DVD', 'very', 'fine', 'testament', 'longevity', 'Eagles', 'immense', 'quality', 'music']",N/A

900620,A3IONOAE8EKJH1,B00092ZMDY,"Eric Cartman ""LYJY""","[1, 1]","I waited a long time to purchase this DVD.  It wasn't because of the set list because the band chose basically all the classic Eagles songs plus some solo hits from Walsh, Henley, and one from Frey along with three new songs.  It wasn't because I wasn't an Eagles fan because they are one of my favorite bands.  It was because Don Felder was absent.  But then I started to read reviews of the DVD which were mostly very positive and I rationalized that I did own the Who DVD (post Moon) Royal Albert Hall and I still think it's outstanding so I figured why not give the Eagles Farewell 1 tour a shot.  I'm very glad that I did because it has become one of my favorite concert DVDs.  The sound on this DVD is amazing and the camera work is fantastic.  Also, like the other reviewers said, the Eagles perform their songs as they should be heard and they perform almost all their classic songs and then some.  Okay, Felder is absent from the concert, but Henley, Frey, Walsh, and Schmitt help you forget about him plus Stuart Smith plays Felder's parts just as Felder would have played them.  Plus, Felder never sang lead vocals that much with the Eagles and the Eagles are a band that concentrates on vocals as much as instruments.  Speaking of the band, they all sound great.  Henley has gained some weight but his singing is still top notch, his drumming and percussion skills are both excellent, and he even plays some acoustic and electric guitar.  He is an underated musician but his drumming was always a vital part of the Eagles sound just like his singing.  Frey thankfully sings a lot more here than he did on Hell Freezes Over (only 3 songs on that one).  Some reviewers said his voice was going a little but I totally disagree.  His voice (probably best voice in the band) still is outstanding and he does a fantastic job on guitar and keyboards.  Frey is also underated as a musician but his guitar and keyboard playing were also vital to the Eagles sound.  Frey is also the one who talks to the audience the most during the concert.  Walsh is definitely a true rock and roll star.  Both his guitar playing and singing during this concert are extraordinary.  He is definitely one of the best American guitar players ever.  Some Eagles fans did not think Walsh fit in with the band but I have to disagree.  Songs like ""Hotel California,"" ""The Long Run,"" ""Life In The Fast Lane,"" and ""Heartache Tonight"" would not have sounded as good without Walsh.  Schmitt is a little bit overshadowed by the other three in terms of singing but he still does a fantastic job on his two signatures songs (""I Can't Tell You Why"" and ""Love Will Keep Us Alive"") and on bass and high harmonies.  Oddly enough, Schmitt is the only one who plays his instrument on every song throughout the DVD (there is at least one song where the other 3 only sing without playing anything).  The extra musicians do not hurt the performance at all and the horn section works here unlike with some other bands such as on The Who's Encore Disc of Tommy and Quadrophenia live.  The spotlight is still on Henley, Frey, Walsh, and Schmitt.  Highlights of this concert include ""Heartache Tonight,"" ""Hotel California,"" ""Life In The Fast Lane,"" ""Already Gone,"" ""Peaceful Easy Feeling,"" ""Lyin' Eyes,"" ""Dirty Laundry,"" ""Take It Easy,"" ""In The City,"" ""Walk Away,"" ""You Belong To The City,"" ""Funk 49,"" ""The Boys Of Summer,"" ""New Kid In Town,"" ""One Of These Nights,"" ""I Can't Tell You Why,"" ""Tequila Sunrise,"" ""Wasted Time,"" ""The Long Run,"" ""Rocky Mountain Way,"" ""One Day At A Time,"" ""Life's Been Good,"" and ""Hole In The World.""  The only performance that doesn't do it for me is ""Desperado.""  Don't get me wrong because I really like that song, but none of the Eagles really PLAY on it this time.  Frey doesn't play piano like he should and Henley should be behind the drums.  The performance for Hell Freezes Over is better.  That's the only let down, but Henley still sings the song very well.  For those who appreciate good humor, watch Frey and Walsh during ""All She Wants To Do Is Dance.""  Anyway, if you are an Eagles fan and appreciate good music I would definitely recommend this DVD.

This is addressed eloquently by Joe Walsh (""I was drunk once - for twenty years"")in a new song called ""One Day At A Time"" - an exhilerating and typically Joe Walsh song that caught my attention from the very first note. Joe has always been my favourite Eagle anyway; he seems to have the best approach to life, and certainly he would have to be in the running for Funniest Rock Musician. He'd definitely have my vote.This two-disc set covers The Eagles from the start, and incorporates all the individual high points. As already stated, the energy level is way up there; it was recorded in Melbourne, Australia, with an audience ranging from little kids to oldsters like me, and not only is it a packed house, everybody is singing and dancing. No dozers here. And on stage, you'd never know these guys are cruising toward that nasty word ""old"" (Joe Walsh will be 59 in November; Don Henley is already there, and Glenn Frey will be 58, also in November); they never were a group to gyrate and race around on stage, but here they get together on some of the songs and hop in time to the music, clearly enjoying each other's music and style.All the great songs are here; ""One Of These Nights"",""New Kid In Town"" ""Peaceful Easy Feeling"";one of my personal favourites, ""Heartache Tonight""; along with a spate of Henley's most singable, best-loved songs, ""Dirty Laundry"", ""Boys Of Summer"" ""All She Wants To Do Is Dance"", and Glenn Frey's hits as well, ""Take It Easy"", ""Desperado"". Joe Walsh's music is also well represented, but Joe really only has to be there for it to be worth watching; he makes a party wherever he goes. During ""Life's Been Good"" here, he dons a hardhat with camera attached and films the audience.This is a high-powered, well-produced concert; makes me wish I'd been there.

900629,A3SIWHT05QZGDL,B00092ZMDY,GALLI,"[4, 5]","Now here is what you call a Masterpiece DVD (if the audio in DTS is corrected!)..., or what Stereophile Magazine calls: M2DF (Music To Die For). This is an extremely well produced DVD, from its outstanding jewel box, inside pamphlet, 2-DVD's (it's 3 hours long!), its camera works and edition, and its performance ambience captured at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia in 2004. The people from the Downunder got a real treat of America's legendary band at its best. This DVD should be played loud through your Surround System... but mind you, it was mixed solely on the DTS format (and not Dolby Pro-Logic - a mistake!), and in my opinion, they could have done a much better job, as in some instances you cannot hear the background musician solos, and in other cases, you can even hear some ""wow & flutter"" on the lower frequences, something that I found very annoying for such a fine concert well edited on the video section. I do hope that Executive Producer, Glenn Frey, is able to pick-up on this, as he is very finniky about good sound, and are able to correct the audio portion on the numerous DVD's that are already out in the market with digital errors on the DTS mix that need to be seriously corrected.Oh, and by-the-way, if you like this DVD (which you should buy) and its music, check out also a band from Australia, BSG (Birtles, Shorrock and Goble) which just released their DVD in the US and its titled ""Full Circle"" (Capitol). They are as good as The Eagles in terms of their fine voices, music material and stage presence, also in a live performance recorded in Melbourne in 2003.

If that's not enough for you, the Eagle's if shell out a few new tunes. Joe Walsh contributes a song he wrote about being sober called ""One Day at a Time"", and Glen Frey & Don Henley chime in with a song they wrote the night after September 11th called ""Hole in the World"". An interesting note about this song is that the group was sent to enter the studio on that day.Disc two is a ten song set that serves as a best of the best as the concert nears its conclusion. You're still getting the solo songs; ""Life's Been Good"", ""Dirty Laundry"", ""Mountain Way"", and ""All She Wants to Do is Dance"", and now you're getting the mega-hits; ""Heartache Tonight"", ""Life in the Fast Lane"", Hotel California"", ""Take It Easy"" and ""Desperado"". The second disc also contains the only bonus feature which is an interview with the group. There's not much to it, but the Eagles talk about their sound, each other, and what's changed. Be sure to find out what the `circle of fear' is.Now that I've talked about the content, let's talk about the show. If I had to sum it up into one word, it would be sensational. Every member's performance is damn near perfect. I mean, even the solos are note for note. There's no denying their talent and musicianship with this performance. Frey sound wonderful vocally and nails down all of his piano and guitar parts with ease. Don Henley is the consummate frontman who also shows that time has not conquered his voice or drumming skills.Bassist Timothy Schmit's falsetto is still as pleasant and soothing, and Joe Walsh (still wacky) displays his knack for the fretboard without breaking a sweat. The group's five part harmonies are the heart and soul of the music, and despite different music styles and voices, manage to make it sound exceptional. The stage is rather large with a decent amount of back-up player in the shadows. The brass and string section really add texture to the music. The Eagles really know how to work the crowd by bringing the energy up for the up-tempo numbers, and bringing it back down for the ballads.The BadIt's sad that I know a few of the Eagles songs from television commercials that they've appeared in.The VerdictWhether you buy a ticket to their live performance (cha-ching) or buy this DVD, rest assured that you won't regret spending your hard-earned money.

I agree.

900636,A2J8WWG4W0OFYQ,B00092ZMDY,Gordon Pfannenstiel,"[1, 1]","To be honest, I wasn't looking to buy this.  I've never been a huge Eagles fan.  In fact, the reason I own Hell Freezes Over is because when I bought my DVD player it was one of the few high quality concert DVDs available.  It was impressive, both in sound and performance, and definitely gave me a new appreciation for the band.But, as I said, I still wasn't looking to buy this DVD.  I just happened upon it at Wal-Mart, and it was just too good of a buy to pass up (under 10 bucks), WITH a bonus CD!  So I bit.  I was a bit skeptical, because let's face it, those vocal parts are pretty high and those voices are now pushing 60 years of age. I've heard many ageing rockers that just can't get up there anymore.All in all, this is a wonderful concert.  It's 2 1/2 hours long, it's well recorded, both sound and picture wise, and the 5.1 surround is actually utilized much better than Hell Freezes Over was.Does this mean that this concert DVD is better than HFO?  In a word, no.  First, I think the excitement of the '94 reunion rubbed off on both the audience and the performers.  Secondly, I think the sound is warmer on HFO, as that was recorded under almost studio like conditions.  And even though Felder's replacement is a pro, and no doubt a more versatile and accomplished guitarist than Felder, I still miss his presence.  He was a full-fledged band member, and a sideman, no matter how talented, is still a sideman.  Also, even though the vocals on this DVD were still OK, I think that they've all lost a bit of their vocal power and range, with the possible exception of Joe Walsh.  They can still hit the notes, but not with the power and quality that they displayed on Hell Freezes Over.  Also, at least three of the backing musicians sing along with almost all the backing vocal parts.  On HFO, it was all Eagles and nothing BUT Eagles singing.But don't get me wrong here.  I am not criticizing this release.  It's top-notch, and I think it's admirable that they do as well as they do, considering their age and the fact that most singers of their vintage could not pull it off with the panache that they do.  It's just that they ARE showing their age, particularly with the vocals.  It's subtle, but when you listen to the songs that are common to both the HFO and Farewell Concert 1 back to back, it is noticable.So enjoy 'em while you can, I say.  These guys are consumate professionals, and I'm sure that when they can't cut it anymore, they will not comprimise their show or their name, even for boatloads of money.

I've been a fan since the James Gang days back in the late 60's, and I've never really followed the Eagles that closely. He gets to perform quite a few solo numbers on this dvd, yet calling them ""solo"" isn't right because the Eagles blend in and make them fit right in with the set and it seems so natural and seamless with the rest of the set. Joe's new song, ""One Day At A Time"" about his newly found sobriety is particulary touching, and he and the band give ripping performances of ""Rocky Mtn. Way"", ""Life's Been Good"", ""In The City"", plus two songs from the James Gang days - ""Funk #49"" and ""Walk Away""!!!

There are so many great things happening on this concert that it's amazing. First, their songs are timeless. They are great, great songs with memorable melodies, great lyrics and wonderful harmonies. Another key thing is that these guys are so tuned into the groove! Man, I can just imagine what a feeling overtakes this band when they're deep into these grooves. I find it very fascinating that, in their interviews in the bonus material, they mention factors that make them great. One of them is groove. Intonation, harmony voicing, rhythmical togetherness, blend....all key elements of this great band.It takes work and a commitment to excellence to have a band be this good. These guys are seasoned and know how to do it better than anyone. Their supporting musicians are fabulous as well. The horn section really adds to the life of these songs.I read someone's review that criticized Joe Walsh acting like a fool. I think his antics are hilarious,(check out the 'helmet cam'- ""Life's Been Good"" made me laugh out loud!) classy fun and indicate that these fellas have nothing to prove anymore. Their longevity and the sheer number of people who STILL go to see them and buy their recordings are testaments to that.

Fortunately the Eagles didn't take that route with this DVD as the entire concert is shown featuring excellent picture and sound.The set list pretty much covers all the big hits, save for a few (""Best Of My Love"", ""James Dean"", and ""Victim of Love"" were missed).  The Eagles were never known for being an electrifying band live as they've always dedicated making their live performances sound as close to the studio recordings as possible. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing.  A good thing because you're getting a polished performance.  A bad thing because the performances tend to come off a little stiff.  Thankfully Joe Walsh (easily the most entertaining person in the band) manages to keep his songs fairly loose.The performances themselves are very solid.  Don Henley is finally starting to show his age, but is still in very fine voice (even though he cheats a little and performs a few of his solo songs in a lower key).  I find it interesting that Henley dedicates ""Dirty Laundry"" to FoxNews daddy Rupert Murdoch.  Considering recent blasphemous reporting by such ""credible"" sources as Newsweek and CBS that got them in hot water, it is fairly amusing that, like a good liberal, Henley turns a blind eye to them and attacks those no-good conservatives instead.

The Eagles have got to be if not the best than at least in the top three super bands of all time.  From the vocals to the instrumentation to the personalities, the Eagles continue to soar high above the clouds making today's musical attempts at song writing and performing seem so contrite and generic.  They even sounded better in this concert than they did in the 70's.  All four sounded simply perfect in their solo performances and totally awesome in their harmonization.  Even Joe Walsh's voice was impeccable.  If I had to nitpick on any of the performances is that I missed the banjo originally played by ex-Eagle Bernie Leadon in ""Take it Easy"".  I was also a little disappointed when an interviewer asked Don Henley what he enjoyed most about performing and his response was ""playing the last song in the set"".  Somehow I think this was tongue-in-cheek but it no less took away from a fan's perception that they really enjoy what they're doing.  If he did mean it, it's understandable after performimg many of the same songs for 40 years.  A super dvd, a super concert, and a super band.

I'm not sure if the blu-ray mastering was done any differently than that of HD-DVD, but I recall (whether real or imagined) that the overall 5.1 mix of the HD-DVD was a bit 'thin' and somewhat unbalanced.  The Blu-Ray release seems fuller in the bass and has a better overall musical balance.  I would have liked to have a bit more concert hall ambiance/audience feel in the mix, but it's a fine line between antiseptic (as on the &#34;America - Live in Chicago&#34; blu-ray which is crisp, but all the audio seems to be processed through the board with little ambient noise) and overblown (as on the Rush Blu-Ray &#34;Snakes and Arrows&#34; where the crowd is sometimes too much in the mix.) One of the best (unfortunately non-bly-ray) concert mixes to my ears is that on the Eric Clapton DVD &#34;One More Car One More Rider&#34;  I realize audio is extremely subjective however.

Unfortunately, there really aren't that many who are still standing and making great live performaces from the 70's. Yet, The Eagles have really triumphed those storms several years ago with the last concert, Hell Freezes Over, and they have finally done it again recently with their farewell tour. Arguably, it is a shame the group will no longer tour anymore for their songs, because those songs are one of the very few cornerstones of music today. That has been shown, in a well-put concert worthy of the music.Eagles: Farewell 1 Tour: Live From Melbourne, is a remakrable double disc DVD concert which makes up for what was left behind from Hell Freezes Over. The compilation includes some great live recordings of great classic like Hotel California, I Can't Tell You Why, New Kid In Town, the soulful Desperado, and other great songs. Also like Hell Freezes over, a few new never-before heard songs were also premiered on this compiled live set. The songs here are lively, and still have a great feeling of bravado that the music never died. The DVD also features a couple of songs Don Henley and Glenn Frey performed from their solo efforts including Dirty Laundry, which Lisa Marie Presley recently covered, and You Belong To The City.Arguably, it is still a shame that The Eagles won't be touring anytime soon. There is just so much great material they've made over the years, and this live DVD package is a must have for all Eagles fans old and new.

I noticed a couple of things with the audio that I wasn't too crazy about, however. One, it doesn't sound like a concert but sounds more like a studio recording because the acoustics of the arena and the audience noise is minimal. So it sounds like they are in your living room rather than being viewed in a large hall concert venue. Some of you may prefer that, but the sound doesn't match the setting to me.  Secondly, the bass, especially the kick drum, is very prominent in the mix.

Like fine wines, somethings do  get BETTER with time--this is not always true with aging muscians and their music however this is not the case!  Even the once wild, perpetually  inebriated Joe Walsh could not have predicted he and his bandmates would endure creative differences, multiple separations, limited solo successes to unite again.....here is &#34;America's Band&#34; back together and BETTER THAN EVER!!!!  Witness the four guitarists, sitting side by side, singing in perfect harmony and playing almost ALL of their treasured hits before a mixed audience of fans (age wise) backed up by some of the most accomplished studio band members and orchestra instrumentalists.  Glen Frey and Don Henley, the two most creative minds of the Eagles, have been the song writing machine of the group; they have set aside their tempestous relationship and have seemingly become respectful and friendly to each other; Timothy Schmit, the only longhaired-remnant of the group, still plays perfect  Bass accompanyment with the Angelic voice and pitch-perfect harmony ; Joe Walsh, the former founder of the Jame's Gang (&#34;Walk Away&#34;) and lead guitarist shows that sobriety and dedication is the perfect ingredient to the group's current and future success.  Here are 30 incredible songs performed with musical perfection (the audio is unbelievable as is the video) from America's most popular supergroup--who amongst us has not sang &#34; Hotel California, Heartache Tonite&#34; in the shower or marvelled at the serene melody of the hauntingly beautiful &#34;Wasted Time&#34; or the Eagles's tribute to chosen loneliness &#34;Desperado&#34;?

900702,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B00092ZMDY,moviemusicbuff,"[5, 6]","I thought Hell Freezes Over was one of the best concerts on DVD; this one tops it.  This concert includes solo hits by Don Henley (The Boys of Summer, All She Wants to Do is Dance, Dirty Laundry, Sunset Grill), Glenn Frey (You Belong to the City), and Joe Walsh (Funk #49, Life's Been Good,  Rocky Mountain Way), and some newer songs by the Eagles (Hole in the World, One Day at A Time). The one band member that was missing (and sorely missed) was Don Felder.  He has been replaced by a session guitarist Steart Smith.  Even though Smith plays the guitar solos very precisely and close to the versions on disc, I missed the nice guitar interplay and chemistry between Felder and Walsh that was in ""Hell Freezes Over.""  There is a lot less chemistry between Stewart and Walsh.The highlight of this concert disc is Joe Walsh.  He is such an incredible guitarist and his guitar solos are impeccable.  On the solo on Hotel California at the end, he totally blows away the session guitarist.  Joe Walsh's solo songs and hits from James Gang days are a very welcome addition to this concert.What is also great in this disc are the inclusion of hits such as ""The Long Run,"" ""Heartache Tonight,"" ""New Kid in Town,"" ""One of These Nights,"" and ""In the City.""

All of the band and the musicians are in top form and there is an unbelievable amount of music packed into these DVD's. Simply a must for Eagles fans, especially ones (like me) who couldn't afford concert tickets.That said, I think the people that easily dismiss Don Felder are way off the mark. The Eagles really reached a musical plateau when Felder joined the band for the ""On The Border"" sessions. He is a tremendous guitar player. When Walsh joined, the band had 2 tremendous guitar players who really played well off of and with each other. A hired giuitar player ( like on this CD) cannot duplicate the interaction that Walsh and Felder built up over the years. It's the one thing I really misssed here.

This DVD, filmed in Melbourne, Australia, is the next best thing to being there.The sound and picture quality are both excellent. Each member of the band, including the horn section and backup players, had their moment to shine.Now for the Eagles themselves. Those guys have only gotten BETTER with age. Their harmonies are just about the most perfect I have ever heard. Each one of them gets to sing lead and do some of their solo works (Henley's ""Boys of Summer"" is fantastic). Joe Walsh, the court jester of rock and roll, seems to be having the time of his life and brings a refreshing amount of comic relief to the band without overdoing it. It's obvious that these guys have long since gotten over their differences and now enjoy a level of chemistry that is far beyond what they had ever had in the past.The concert is full-length and sports some pretty good extras featuring back stage moments and interviews with the band.Of particular note is the NEW Frey-penned song ""No More Cloudy Days"".

I just love to crank it and spank it when I can and feel the beer kick in.  That is where it fails.

My one other Blu-ray, Joe Satriani Live in Montreal, does not have any problem burying the volume nor does dozens of my mdvds either.This concert is a no brainer to own but I am not sure if you really want it in Blu-ray over mdvd if you love to bury your volume like I do.

I understand that though, completely. I love the Eagles.1) The lack of Don Felder is obvious in the sound of the band. The 'Eagles' sound that we've listened to for years is lacking without him. Don Felder and Joe Walsh always played off of each other and now it just doesn't happen. Sorry.2) The overt and heavy-handed use of a horn section, another guitarist and another keyboardist is just too painful to listen to. The clean, vibrant and very-much in-the-pocket performances from 'Hell Freezes Over' DVD are gone, replaced by what seems to be an attempt to tour just for the sake of it and to keep the ""proverbial"" pool heated (a term concerning touring musicians once coined by Lars Ulrich). If it's just about making money now, then I'll prefer to keep mine, thank you. Sorry.3) The DTS mix DOES sound brittle as several other reviewers have pointed out. The DTS processing clearly wasn't completed with as much thought as the 'Hell Freezes Over' DVD. Sorry.4) Don Henley, Glenn Frey & Timothy B. Schmit looked a little too 'geriatric'. Joe Walsh seems to have a lot of problems just enunciating his words for some reason. It really looked as though he was wearing `Depends' under his sarong pants he was wearing onstage during the second nights performance.  I hate saying this about the Eagles, seeing that I've always appreciated them for their ability to perform and make great music. Their albums and music though, thankfully will continue to be timeless, even if they're not. Sorry.5) If you own `Hell Freezes Over' DVD and own the `Selected Works' CD box set (which includes the Millennium concert that has a lot of songs that were played on tour but not on the DVD) then keep and cherish that as it really is the definitive work by these guys. Sorry.6) A lot of the performances by Don Henley (on this release) are just unwatchable because he's lost his ability to really carry the music and vocalize, gaining the weight maybe hasn't helped him much either. Sorry.Listen, I really love the Eagles in every way, but if you have to decide what you want to spend your $25 on, this aint it, get `Hell Freezes Over', and if you already own it, then be thankful and appreciate the previous releases.

The 5.1 soundtrack is also impressive. The performance is pretty much flawless. The Eagles are rich in vocal ability and it shows. All 4 of the main-stays, Henley, Frey, Walsh, and Schmidt are bonifide lead singers in their own right. Together, they are very impressive. Their instrumental abilities also do not disappoint. Walsh is an accomplished guitar player. Schmidt is an excellent bass player, very under-rated. Henley is a very able and steady drummer. Frey is a good rhythm guitar player. Henley frequently switches to guitar, but seems to use it as a prop as much as acually playing it. Frey switches to keyboards and though not fancy, does a fine job. With their supporting cast of talented players, it hardly matters anyway. Bottom line, they switch because they feel like it, not because thay have to. Sadly, many famous groups/bands really can't sing or play very well at all. The Eagles are the real deal. Unfortunately, the music business is just that, a business. Too often, talent takes a back seat to market-a-bility. I always enjoy hearing The Eagles many group and individual hits again. Great songs are always great. I also own their ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD, which is also quite good. But this one looks better, sounds better, and has more songs. A+ in every way.

The baggage involving Don Felder seems to have been lifted by the presence of his replacement, Steuart Smith, and, from a tape of the show made for me before I owned this DVD, I see that the band is playing the old songs better than they have in a long time, as well as throwing in a few new ones. The best of the latter is Joe Walsh's ""One Day At A Time"", which he says is about his recovery from alcoholism, but could be about getting over ANY addiction.

900752,A25JHXYK10F0A6,B00092ZMDY,"Thomas D. Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[35, 44]","Back in the `70s, the Eagles latched onto something that seemed very creative at the time. The `country rock' sound that was developed by Gram Parsons and the Byrds in the late `60s got polished to a high-pitched sheen by Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon, eventually abetted by Don Felder on lead guitar. Their first four albums were all crucial to their era, and brought `country-rock' to the forefront of popularity. By the time that they released ""Hotel California,"" they were recognized as huge stars, and their creativity reached significantly beyond the standard arrangements of country rock. Then, `punk rock' attempted to change all that. The Eagles dismissed the do-it-yourself aesthetic of punk as a laughable aberration. Instead, they entered the recording studio for what seemed like years, only to emerge in 1979 with the most boring and ill-conceived album of their career, a poorly focused effort that was appropriately entitled ""The Long Run."" Judging by sales figures, the Eagles were right, though. Bands like the Buzzcocks and Stiff Little Fingers languished and then fell apart, while ""The Long Run"" went platinum. Still, though, the band recognized that their relevance was diminishing, and they disbanded soon afterward. They haven't released a studio album since then.Twenty-five years later, the band is touring and drawing crowds as if they had never left. In the interim, a collection of their greatest hits has become the best-selling album of all time, so in reality, they never really did go away. Without any considerable addition to their catalog of tunes, the band has toured sporadically, demanding outrageous ticket prices, and yet continually selling out stadiums around the world. This time around, the tour was mockingly entitled the ""Farewell 1 Tour"", and this DVD captures one complete show as performed in Melbourne, Australia. As this audience ascertains, fans of the band now consist of a mixed group of three generations, all of whom seem to think that the year is 1977, and ""Hotel California"" is still at the top of the charts. (As a side note, it is rather obvious that for this show at least, the band sent out roadies to ensure that the front row was filled entirely with attractive women, a rather transparent and ridiculous maneuver at this point of the band's career.)The strange thing, though, is that three of the five `original' bandmembers are no longer aboard, and their contributions are unacknowledged here, except for a performance of Meisner's ""Take It to the Limit"". Joe Walsh has been an Eagle for the last two albums only, and Timothy B. Shmit didn't join until the sessions for their last album, yet they now consist of 50% of the `official' band, along with leaders Glenn Frey and Don Henley. As a longtime fan, I will always consider Schmit as a member of Poco (with whom he released over ten records and wrote nearly one hundred songs) and Joe Walsh as a solo artist. From a historic perspective (but certainly not a financial one), their careers as ""Eagles' seems secondary to me, but it is their presence that fleshes out what otherwise would have been reduced to a singing/songwriting duo.Interestingly, this collection relies heavily on the subsequent solo work of Frey and Henley (""The Boys of Summer"", You Belong to the City"" ""Dirty Laundry""), and the previous solo work of Walsh (""Rocky Mountain Way"", ""Funk #49""). Classic tracks like ""Peaceful Easy Feeling,"" ""Life in the Fast Lane,"" ""Lyin' Eyes,"" ""New Kid in Town,"" ""Hotel California"" and ""Already Gone"" are the reason that people show up, though, and here, they sound like spit-and-polish versions of the original studio recordings. There is no doubt that this band has the goods to play these tunes to perfection. For me, though, the net result is that I really miss Meisner, Leadon and Felder. They were integral to the band when the band was at its most creative, and their absence is palpable. In this configuration, the performances are extremely tight and well-rehearsed, leaving virtually every note sounding processed to perfection. Apparently, this is exactly how their contemporary audience loves them, so I cannot deny the `new' Eagles their extended run of popularity. Still, though, I can't help but wonder how I could ever miss them if they won't ever go away.

900759,A3W1XR6747TRR2,B00092ZMDY,Wine Guy,"[8, 9]","Just got finished watching this, and I came away once again very impressed with the pure muscianship and attention to production. These guys are known perfectionists and it shows. Some say their live performances sound too much like the records, but on this one they spice it up a little more than on Hell Freezes Over, though there aren't many cool acoustic ones like on that DVD. This one is less stiff than HFO too.  Don Felder is missing on this one (out of the band since '01), but the guy filling in does a OK job, though it's just not the same on Hotel California. I thought the best performance was Walsh's Funk #49. It demands to be rocked LOUD in DTS. As with HFO, the recording quality is superb with DTS as the only surround option (just as HFO & Henley's DVD). The Eagles do this as DTS is better than Dolby as it uses less compression, and they can increase the video resolution when the Dolby track is left off.  In fact, I think this DVD sets the standard in sound quality for live mixes.  I have the Hotel California DVD-Audio, and the mix and realism sounds better here due to more available tracks to mix from and it utilizes higher resolution digital recording (though nothing can touch the resolution on a DVD-Audio or SACD).  Overall, there's more songs, and it's more of a rockin' set than HFO. Frey & Schmit look great while Henley, and especially Walsh, are starting to show their age (was that Hermes pajama bottoms Walsh was wearing?). Though Walsh's voice sounds the freshest. If you like great music, buy this. If you have a great sound system, buy this, as it will really show it off and make you glad you spent the big bucks.  As a last note, the Eagles share my passion for wine.  When their manager, Irving Azoff, shared some Lafite Rothschild with them in 1974, they began putting in their tour contracts that first growth Bordeaux would be in their dressing rooms.
