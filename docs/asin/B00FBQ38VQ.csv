Craig Ferguson is a breath of fresh air. The people that he refers to with distain as in the &#34;entertainment crowd&#34; are the reason that I stopped watching TV three years ago. Finding these types of shows on Amazon Prime is tempting me to pay more attention again. TV, and radio, use to be useful, informative tools for our lives. With Craig on board, they might be again.

Well, these &#34;Special Events&#34; are of some guy interviewing Craig about his life, etc.  I smiled a few times, just because I think Craig Ferguson is just funny...but this was a huge disappointment, I must say.

Love to watch his nightly show as well and am very sad it will be off the air after Dec. 2014. His double intendre' comedy is like no one else. Letterman, Fallon & Kimbel only wish they could be Craig. What's even more astounding is the man does his nightly show unrehearsed, it is totally ad lib and ends up being some of the best TV I watch all week.
