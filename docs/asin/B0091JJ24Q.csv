1583928,AZ4JHTB28WC39,B0091JJ24Q,Criterion Collector,"[4, 8]","I didn't know what to expect from this movie since I had read that none of the Replacements appear, there is no footage of them performing, and there is none of their music on the soundtrack.  Another concern I had was that since the movie consists mostly of interviews, some of them fan interviews, this might be an amateurish fan-boy effort.  No worries on either account!  Gorman Bechard has done an outstanding job of creating a lively, compelling, thoroughly engrossing documentary despite no involvement from the band.  And the whole thing is very professionally done.It's true that without any of their music this film probably won't sell the Mats to someone who hasn't heard them - although they may be motivated to learn more based on the heart-felt tributes from their fans.  However, I think anyone with any interest at all in the Replacments will really enjoy this film, as I did.  There is plenty of inside info that I did not know, and many funny stories.  I pre-ordered a copy of this as soon as it was available.  I am looking forward to seeing it again, along with the additional interview material that is included.For me, one of the film's interesting elements is the inclusion of the sales figures for each of their records, including the re-issues.  I was surprised to see that none of the numbers for their initial releases are outstanding, even their best-known ones.  And the figures for the re-issues are 1/10th or less of the original releases.  For a band that simultaneously held the titles of World's Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band and World's Greatest Cover Band (and, yes, occasionally The World's Worst in both categories), this was a bit dismaying.  It is shocking to think that a band this good might actually be slipping into obscurity.  Here's hoping that this documentary will spark a revival of interest in this great band.",5,"If you like the Replacements, you will like this very much",1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,1858,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'had', 'read', 'none', 'Replacements', 'appear', 'footage', 'performing', 'none', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'concern', 'had', 'was', 'movie', 'mostly', 'interviews', 'fan', 'interviews', 'might', 'be', 'amateurish', 'fan-boy', 'effort', 'worries', 'account', 'Gorman', 'Bechard', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'creating', 'lively', 'compelling', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'documentary', 'involvement', 'band', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'professionally', 'done.It', 'true', 'music', 'film', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sell', 'Mats', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'heard', 'may', 'be', 'motivated', 'learn', 'more', 'based', 'heart-felt', 'tributes', 'fans', 'However', 'think', 'anyone', 'interest', 'Replacments', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'did', 'plenty', 'inside', 'info', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'many', 'funny', 'stories', 'pre-ordered', 'copy', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'available', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'additional', 'interview', 'material', 'included.For', 'one', 'film', 'interesting', 'elements', 'inclusion', 'sales', 'figures', 'records', 'including', 're-issues', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'none', 'numbers', 'initial', 'releases', 'are', 'outstanding', 'even', 'best-known', 'ones', 'figures', 're-issues', 'are', '1/10th', 'less', 'original', 'releases', 'band', 'simultaneously', 'held', 'titles', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'Band', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Cover', 'Band', 'yes', 'occasionally', 'World', 'Worst', 'categories', 'was', 'bit', 'dismaying', 'shocking', 'think', 'band', 'good', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'slipping', 'obscurity', 'Here', 'hoping', 'documentary', 'will', 'spark', 'revival', 'interest', 'great', 'band']",The Replacements - Color Me Obsessed: A Film About The Replacements
1583929,A1CBWIOEDH5PNP,B0091JJ24Q,"Gorman Bechard ""don't ask why""","[4, 6]","Greetings,Just want to let everyone know how proud we are of this DVD release.  On it you'll find 6 hours of extras including 19 deleted scenes, the complete interviews with Grant Hart of Husker Du, famed rock critic Robert Christgau, and Sound Opinions hosts Greg Kot & Jim DeRogatis, a behind the scenes interview with me, and another with Hansi Oppenheimer who originated the project years ago.  Plus there are two commentaries, one from me, and the other from our Minneapolis producer Jan Radder.  Throw in 4 trailers, and you have one hell of a DVD!!!Color Me Obsessed was a blast to make.  And for anyone wondering why there's no band or music, that was the concept from the start.  We never even asked to speak with the band, never asked to use the music.  Never.  From the get-go I wanted to turn the rock doc genre on its ear.  And for a band who shot a stereo speaker for 4 minutes for its first music video, I think this approach is appropriate and more than fitting.A number of critics seem to agree.  Rolling Stone called it one of ""the seven best new music documentaries of the year."" The Village Voice called it ""the rock version of Rashomon."" David Carr, the NY Times columnist tweeted ""You can feel The Replacements in every single frame."" And the raves go on and on (even check the IMDb user comments).For fans, you will be reaching for your Mats albums the moment the end credits roll.  (NOTE: the film doesn't end with the end credits.  There's more!)And for music lovers not familiar with The Replacements, you will be armed with everything you need to discover them and fall in love with them as we did so many years back.As CHARTattack said, ""the film is a shockingly refreshing and invigorating experience for anyone who ever care about any kind of music at all.""Hope you enjoy it!Gorman BechardP.S. My second rock doc, What Did You Expect?What Did You Expect?: Live at Cat's Cradleis being release on the same day as Color Me Obsessed. It is a document of the Archers of Loaf live in concert.

1583931,A3O8XFP3N8UP4H,B0091JJ24Q,Michael,"[46, 52]","I will tell you the one problem I had with the film at the end of this review. I will start by saying that this has become my favorite documentary ever!! Now, unlike everyone who appeared in this film and unlike most viewers or fans, I wasn't alive when The Replacements were in their prime. I'm only in my early 20s and I discovered the band back in 2008 from a friend of mine. They have become my favorite band, to the point of obsession.I won't go on about how there is no music or interviews from the band in the film. I will just say that this was the best way to tell the band's story. The Replacements were sort of that band that you herd about, you knew the name but you didn't know who they were completely. They seemed to be this legend that people had told. It was something that a lot of people had talked about but somewhere in the place of rock history, they were left out when The Beatles, The Velvet Underground or R.E.M. are mentioned. You just knew from what you had heard that they were an important band and you were either curious to listen to their songs or just simply not interested. But my point is, you knew or heard something about them and that is their legacy. The band that no one knows of was simply the greatest band of the 80s or the pioneers of Alternatvie rock.Was the band that great? I am here to say that yes, they were!! Maybe the only important band to come out of the 80s underground. This film is amazing!! So much insight, humor and heart are in these interviews and it shows what it means to have passion for anything. You don't have to be a fan, even if you're not a Mats fan, you know what it means to have something touch you, make an impact and shape you into the person that you are today. That you're not alone and there is something out there for anyone. Gorman Bechard did a great job with these interviews and got the best out of these fans, fellow musicians or collaborators with The Replacements. This is storytelling and it completely covers a legend that has been told before but never at this scale. This was a little band from Minneapolis that with no record sales, no commercial success has become an important part of rock music and what it is today.I will end this review by saying the one thing that I didn't like about this film. It's that there is very little praise for the Tim record that The Mats did. Everyone talks about how great Let It Be or Pleased To Meet Me is but hardly any love for Tim. I know it's a difference of opinion but I consider this the best record the band ever did and also, the greatest rock album in history. Still, this is a great film. One that I hope will lead others to discover these songs. Believe me, once you've herd ""Left Of The Dial"", you will never be the same.",5,Great film about my favorite band but I only have one problem.,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,2764,"['will', 'tell', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'end', 'review', 'will', 'start', 'saying', 'become', 'favorite', 'documentary', 'ever', 'Now', 'everyone', 'who', 'appeared', 'film', 'most', 'viewers', 'fans', 'was', ""n't"", 'alive', 'when', 'Replacements', 'were', 'prime', ""'m"", 'only', 'early', '20s', 'discovered', 'band', 'back', '2008', 'friend', 'mine', 'have', 'become', 'favorite', 'band', 'point', 'obsession.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'how', 'music', 'interviews', 'band', 'film', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'best', 'way', 'tell', 'band', 'story', 'Replacements', 'were', 'sort', 'band', 'herd', 'knew', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'were', 'completely', 'seemed', 'be', 'legend', 'people', 'had', 'told', 'was', 'something', 'lot', 'people', 'had', 'talked', 'somewhere', 'place', 'rock', 'history', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'when', 'Beatles', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'R.E.M', 'are', 'mentioned', 'just', 'knew', 'what', 'had', 'heard', 'were', 'important', 'band', 'were', 'either', 'curious', 'listen', 'songs', 'just', 'simply', 'not', 'interested', 'point', 'knew', 'heard', 'something', 'legacy', 'band', 'one', 'was', 'simply', 'greatest', 'band', '80s', 'pioneers', 'Alternatvie', 'rock.Was', 'band', 'great', 'am', 'here', 'say', 'yes', 'were', 'Maybe', 'only', 'important', 'band', 'come', '80s', 'underground', 'film', 'amazing', 'So', 'much', 'insight', 'humor', 'heart', 'are', 'interviews', 'what', 'have', 'passion', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Mats', 'fan', 'know', 'what', 'have', 'something', 'touch', 'make', 'impact', 'shape', 'person', 'are', 'today', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'something', 'out', 'there', 'anyone', 'Gorman', 'Bechard', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'interviews', 'got', 'best', 'fans', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'collaborators', 'Replacements', 'storytelling', 'completely', 'legend', 'been', 'told', 'never', 'scale', 'was', 'little', 'band', 'Minneapolis', 'record', 'sales', 'commercial', 'success', 'become', 'important', 'part', 'rock', 'music', 'what', 'today.I', 'will', 'end', 'review', 'saying', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'praise', 'Tim', 'record', 'Mats', 'did', 'Everyone', 'talks', 'how', 'great', 'Let', 'Be', 'Pleased', 'Meet', 'Me', 'hardly', 'love', 'Tim', 'know', 'difference', 'opinion', 'consider', 'best', 'record', 'band', 'ever', 'did', 'also', 'greatest', 'rock', 'album', 'history', 'Still', 'great', 'film', 'One', 'hope', 'will', 'lead', 'others', 'discover', 'songs', 'Believe', 'once', ""'ve"", 'herd', 'Left', 'Dial', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same']",The Replacements - Color Me Obsessed: A Film About The Replacements
