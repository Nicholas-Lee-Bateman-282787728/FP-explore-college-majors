One of my favorite Steves quotes--one I always tell my friends who are about to go to Europe--is ""The more money you spend, the bigger the wall you build between yourself and the culture you traveled so far to visit."" These programs are perfect for budget-conscious travelers and demonstrate how easy it is to have a fulfilling European vacation without spending a lot of money. His books are always in my hand when traveling, and his DVDs are always playing when I'm home.This set of 80 shows, plus extras, just about covers everything you need to know about traveling in Europe. They are a balanced mix of sightseeing and travel tips. Half of the shows are widescreen transfers of the original HD episodes, and they look fantastic. And the older 4:3 shows look terrific, as well; none of them seem dated. Rick's presentation is energetic and informative, and you can tell he really loves what he's doing.",5,The right way to travel,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1024,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Rick', 'Steves', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'public', 'television', 'travel', 'philosphy', 'resonated', 'immediately', 'One', 'favorite', 'Steves', 'quotes', 'one', 'always', 'tell', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'go', 'Europe', 'more', 'money', 'spend', 'bigger', 'wall', 'build', 'culture', 'traveled', 'so', 'far', 'visit', 'programs', 'are', 'perfect', 'budget-conscious', 'travelers', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'easy', 'have', 'fulfilling', 'European', 'vacation', 'spending', 'lot', 'money', 'books', 'are', 'always', 'hand', 'when', 'traveling', 'DVDs', 'are', 'always', 'playing', 'when', ""'m"", 'home.This', 'set', '80', 'shows', 'extras', 'just', 'covers', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'traveling', 'Europe', 'are', 'balanced', 'mix', 'sightseeing', 'travel', 'tips', 'Half', 'shows', 'are', 'widescreen', 'transfers', 'original', 'HD', 'episodes', 'look', 'fantastic', 'older', '4:3', 'shows', 'look', 'terrific', 'as', 'well', 'none', 'seem', 'dated', 'Rick', 'presentation', 'energetic', 'informative', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'what', 'doing']",N/A

193297,AZQHYOURLCLZH,1598802402,"Heather ""Here To Help""","[20, 20]","I love Europe. And these DVDs are just the fix I need in between visits. Besides making the wait easier for ""Europhiles"" this dvd set is also great for first time visitors to acquaint them with the different countries and give them valuable information that will save them time, money, and hassle on their trip. Rick's narrative is outstanding. He is enthusiastic, but not overly ""perky"" (like some of the travel guides out there). He also gives you just the right amount of history and art history, just enough so you know what you're looking at but not enough to lose your interest if you are not a history buff. Rick also comes across as the type of tourist I aspire to be - respected by the Europeans and enlightened, NOT the stereotypical tourist lugging huge bags, visiting every tourist trap imaginable, and ignoring every etiquette. Rick shows you the important sights, but he shows you the REAL Europe, not the one ""manufactured for tourists"". The camera work is excellent, and Rick visits many of the places you'd want to go and sights within those destinations. There is no better travel companion. This dvd set also features areas outside of Europe such as Iran, Egypt, Israel, and a day trip to Morocco, if you want something more exotic. There are also two of Rick's lectures, one on travel tips and one on travel as a political act. Both are outstanding. I can't get enough of these dvds. I watch them over and over again, never getting tired of them. Rick is truly a pleasure to ""travel"" with (through watching his shows) and these dvds are truly inspiring for planning your trip. You'll know what your ""must see"" destinations are after watching these, and you'll have the will power to save up and visit them! And if it's a place you won't get to, instead of wondering what you're missing you'll at least have a great introduction to the place (maybe next time!). I can't recommend these dvds enough. If I could only keep one dvd or dvd set in my collection it would be this one. If you want a small sample of what his shows are like check out Rick Steves' Europe video podcast on iTunes (make sure it's the video one). They are actually very abbreviated clips from his shows (and free!)",5,"Informative, entertaining, and just the fix I need between visits",1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,2204,"['love', 'Europe', 'DVDs', 'are', 'just', 'fix', 'need', 'visits', 'making', 'wait', 'easier', 'Europhiles', 'dvd', 'set', 'also', 'great', 'first', 'time', 'visitors', 'acquaint', 'different', 'countries', 'give', 'valuable', 'information', 'will', 'save', 'time', 'money', 'hassle', 'trip', 'Rick', 'narrative', 'outstanding', 'enthusiastic', 'not', 'overly', 'perky', 'travel', 'there', 'also', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'history', 'art', 'history', 'just', 'enough', 'so', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'not', 'enough', 'lose', 'interest', 'are', 'not', 'history', 'buff', 'Rick', 'also', 'type', 'tourist', 'aspire', 'be', 'respected', 'Europeans', 'enlightened', 'NOT', 'stereotypical', 'tourist', 'lugging', 'huge', 'bags', 'visiting', 'tourist', 'trap', 'imaginable', 'ignoring', 'etiquette', 'Rick', 'important', 'sights', 'REAL', 'Europe', 'not', 'one', 'manufactured', 'tourists', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'Rick', 'many', 'places', ""'d"", 'want', 'go', 'sights', 'destinations', 'better', 'travel', 'companion', 'dvd', 'set', 'also', 'areas', 'Europe', 'such', 'Iran', 'Egypt', 'Israel', 'day', 'trip', 'Morocco', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'exotic', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'Rick', 'lectures', 'one', 'travel', 'tips', 'one', 'travel', 'political', 'act', 'are', 'outstanding', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'dvds', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'getting', 'tired', 'Rick', 'truly', 'pleasure', 'travel', 'watching', 'shows', 'dvds', 'are', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'planning', 'trip', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'must', 'see', 'destinations', 'are', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'have', 'will', 'power', 'save', 'up', 'visit', 'place', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'instead', 'wondering', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', ""'ll"", 'least', 'have', 'great', 'introduction', 'place', 'maybe', 'next', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'dvds', 'enough', 'could', 'only', 'keep', 'one', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'set', 'collection', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'want', 'small', 'sample', 'what', 'shows', 'are', 'check', 'Rick', 'Steves', 'Europe', 'video', 'podcast', 'iTunes', 'make', 'sure', 'video', 'one', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'abbreviated', 'clips', 'shows', 'free']",N/A

I cringed as my 2-month old Sony top line DVD Recorder kept trying to find episodes that didn't exist.  Amazon was terrific & replaced each set overnight & by 2-day @y request--I felt guilty!  The first set Germany, France & both Italy were bad.  2nd set France & Italy's citites were bad.  3rd set, sooo sadly, Italy's Cities would only at first 2 episodes.  I need this set to study for ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" and I'm dejected they couldn't have better quality control in place.  Amazon did everything they could, but their hands were tied & they couldn't send me a free copy of Italy's cities & allow me to keep the defective set.

193303,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,1598802402,Willy D. Reviewer,"[3, 6]","I bought the set new, not used.  Even so, every disc had a glitch in it during one of the programs, making it not viewable.  I had to take the disc out, re-insert it, and skip to the next episode.  Again, this was on every disc -- even after I cleaned them!First, Rick Steves' personality is milk toast.  His major appeal must be to senior citizens with his plastic smile and demeanor.  He never gets excited about great art, great food, or great views, nor does he ever get perturbed with poor restaurant service, terrible food, or the rudeness of the people in travel countries.  He's just blah, with a conceited obsession about how his hair looks on camera.Secondly, I was anticipating a ""how to"" series, and not a mediocre travelog.  For example, what is the best way to get from the airport to downtown?  Should I take a bus, a cab, subway, or a trolley?  How much should I expect to pay?  To tell me that the public transportation system is good throughout Europe, does not help me navigate that system -- especially in France where the population refuses to respond to questions in English.Also, Rick recommends the small side street cafes in Paris.  But none of the small cafes have menus that are bilingual.  (And very few of the Paris Metro signs are in English.  Which often is a big problem.)  He tells us that the cost of a great French lunch in a side street cafe is little more than fast food on the Blvd., which is misleading.  The cost of a Big Mac is $22.50 American, without the $6.00 soda in downtown Paris.  And take note of the things Rick eats; e.g. raw herring, octopus, tripe, etc. -- things you would probably never eat at home.  (And when he eats the foreign food, could he possibly tell us every item on his plate, and then turn to the camera and tell us how it tastes?  He only goes ""Hmmmmm."" and we don't know what he is eating.  Has the man never heard of adjectives?  In every city he eats the food, but keeps his likes and dislikes a secret.)Note well: In many major cities, he has a native tour guide (affiliated with his books) show him around.  The tour guide explains the city, the transportation system, and reads the menu -- and orders -- for him.  Rich Steves has bragged that he has written his books in such a way that you don't need a tour guide or someone to translate the menu.  Oh really?  I went to that little Italian cafe in Rome that is open only for lunch, that he highly recommends.  Yes, it has a menu written on a chalk board in Italian that changes daily, and not one person (staff or patron) spoke English.  The owner became very frustrated because I was taking so long referring to Rick's Italian/English translation section of his book and the menu.Again, Rick does not tell you how to precisely navigate the city/country, nor does he tell you the cost of the meals, the B&B;, etc.  He expects you to buy his books, where those items are listed.  That fact reduces this series to a travelog that others have done far better.Buy his books, and forget about the DVDs.",1,Very Disappointing,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,3023,"['bought', 'set', 'new', 'not', 'used', 'Even', 'so', 'disc', 'had', 'glitch', 'one', 'programs', 'making', 'not', 'viewable', 'had', 'take', 'disc', 'out', 're-insert', 'skip', 'next', 'episode', 'Again', 'was', 'disc', 'even', 'cleaned', 'First', 'Rick', 'Steves', 'personality', 'milk', 'toast', 'major', 'appeal', 'must', 'be', 'senior', 'citizens', 'plastic', 'smile', 'demeanor', 'never', 'excited', 'great', 'art', 'great', 'food', 'great', 'views', 'ever', 'get', 'perturbed', 'poor', 'restaurant', 'service', 'terrible', 'food', 'rudeness', 'people', 'travel', 'countries', 'just', 'blah', 'conceited', 'obsession', 'how', 'hair', 'camera.Secondly', 'was', 'anticipating', 'how', 'series', 'not', 'mediocre', 'travelog', 'example', 'what', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'airport', 'downtown', 'Should', 'take', 'bus', 'cab', 'subway', 'trolley', 'How', 'much', 'should', 'expect', 'pay', 'tell', 'public', 'transportation', 'system', 'good', 'Europe', 'not', 'help', 'navigate', 'system', 'especially', 'France', 'where', 'population', 'respond', 'questions', 'English.Also', 'Rick', 'small', 'side', 'street', 'cafes', 'Paris', 'none', 'small', 'cafes', 'have', 'menus', 'are', 'bilingual', 'very', 'few', 'Paris', 'Metro', 'signs', 'are', 'English', 'Which', 'often', 'big', 'problem', 'cost', 'great', 'French', 'lunch', 'side', 'street', 'cafe', 'little', 'more', 'fast', 'food', 'Blvd.', 'misleading', 'cost', 'Big', 'Mac', '22.50', 'American', '6.00', 'soda', 'downtown', 'Paris', 'take', 'note', 'things', 'Rick', 'eats', 'e.g', 'raw', 'herring', 'octopus', 'tripe', 'etc', 'things', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'eat', 'home', 'when', 'foreign', 'food', 'could', 'possibly', 'tell', 'item', 'plate', 'then', 'turn', 'camera', 'tell', 'how', 'only', 'Hmmmmm', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'eating', 'man', 'never', 'heard', 'adjectives', 'city', 'food', 'likes', 'secret', 'Note', 'well', 'many', 'major', 'cities', 'native', 'tour', 'guide', 'affiliated', 'books', 'show', 'around', 'tour', 'guide', 'city', 'transportation', 'system', 'menu', 'orders', 'Rich', 'Steves', 'bragged', 'written', 'books', 'such', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tour', 'guide', 'someone', 'translate', 'menu', 'Oh', 'really', 'went', 'little', 'Italian', 'cafe', 'Rome', 'open', 'only', 'lunch', 'highly', 'Yes', 'menu', 'written', 'chalk', 'board', 'Italian', 'changes', 'daily', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'staff', 'patron', 'spoke', 'English', 'owner', 'became', 'very', 'frustrated', 'was', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'referring', 'Rick', 'Italian/English', 'translation', 'section', 'book', 'menu.Again', 'Rick', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'precisely', 'navigate', 'city/country', 'tell', 'cost', 'meals', 'B', 'B', 'etc', 'buy', 'books', 'where', 'items', 'are', 'listed', 'fact', 'series', 'travelog', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'far', 'better.Buy', 'books', 'forget', 'DVDs']",N/A
