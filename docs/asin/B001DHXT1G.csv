1180459,A155X6KYOPQEZ5,B001DHXT1G,"#1 Cardinal Fan ""Afe""","[0, 0]","The Incredible Hulk. The title itself is great. Just to start things off. Edward Nortan stars in this sci-fi film about how a man always has something inside him. Something that has a bad temper. Something thats INCREDIBLE. I won't give away much as some of you don't want to hear any major spoilers. I will go by each disc and break down the major things contained on it.DISC 1-The film The Incredible Hulk. As with all dvds it has language, subtitles, and all of that stuff.DISC 2-This is the ultimate disc!!! On this disc are 17 deleted scenes! That alone is fantastic. Then is has the making of the Incredible Hulk, how they filmed some of the battle scenes from the movie, an alternate opening to the movie, and oh soooo much more I cannot remember because I have a friend borrowing it right now!DISC 3-The digital copy to the film. Even as we speak I have the movie right o my mac computer! And also on a video iPod! Digital copys are becoming very popular. And they are also very handy as if you have someone borrowing the movie (as in my case) you can watch it on your computer! The digital copy is a must. And the quality is very nice too, I might add.Now lets move on to the effects. I cannot explain how amazing the special effects are in this movie. The hulk himself looks more realistic than ever before. I have never seen the 2003 version, but I can imagine this version is A LOT better! The movie has almost no ""bad scenes"" in it. When the back of the dvd says ""brief suggestive content"" they aren't kidding about ""brief"". The suggestive content lasts for about 15 seconds and then the movie continues. It does have a PG-13 rating for a reason, though. If you buy this movie, be prepared for violence. There is really not much blood as such. Its just how many people are killed that makes the violence level go up. So don't be fooled by that. Overall, this movie is great and I definitely recommend this to you!!!",5,"Way Better than ""Incredible!!!""",1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,1928,"['Incredible', 'Hulk', 'title', 'great', 'Just', 'start', 'things', 'off', 'Edward', 'Nortan', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'how', 'man', 'always', 'something', 'Something', 'bad', 'temper', 'Something', 'thats', 'INCREDIBLE', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'major', 'spoilers', 'will', 'go', 'disc', 'break', 'down', 'major', 'things', 'contained', 'it.DISC', '1-The', 'film', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'dvds', 'language', 'subtitles', 'stuff.DISC', '2-This', 'ultimate', 'disc', 'disc', 'are', '17', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alone', 'fantastic', 'Then', 'making', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'how', 'filmed', 'battle', 'scenes', 'movie', 'alternate', 'opening', 'movie', 'oh', 'soooo', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'have', 'friend', 'borrowing', 'right', 'now', 'DISC', '3-The', 'digital', 'copy', 'film', 'Even', 'speak', 'have', 'movie', 'right', 'mac', 'computer', 'also', 'video', 'iPod', 'Digital', 'copys', 'are', 'becoming', 'very', 'popular', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'handy', 'have', 'someone', 'borrowing', 'movie', 'case', 'can', 'watch', 'computer', 'digital', 'copy', 'must', 'quality', 'very', 'nice', 'too', 'might', 'add.Now', 'lets', 'move', 'effects', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'how', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'movie', 'hulk', 'more', 'realistic', 'ever', 'have', 'never', 'seen', '2003', 'version', 'can', 'imagine', 'version', 'LOT', 'better', 'movie', 'almost', 'bad', 'scenes', 'When', 'back', 'dvd', 'brief', 'suggestive', 'content', 'are', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'brief', 'suggestive', 'content', 'lasts', 'about', '15', 'seconds', 'then', 'movie', 'have', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'reason', 'though', 'buy', 'movie', 'be', 'prepared', 'violence', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'blood', 'such', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'violence', 'level', 'go', 'up', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'Overall', 'movie', 'great', 'definitely', 'recommend']",N/A
1180460,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B001DHXT1G,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 4]","Louis Leterrier's `Incredible Hulk' does everything in reverse:  When watching comic action-adventure films, we expect the special effects to be perfect with a script that's flawed.  Not here. With a properly pensive screenplay by Zak Penn, and a sensitive, yet gripping reading by Edward Norton, this `Hulk' gets only what's important right.Briefly Bruce Banner (Norton) hides out in Brazil, trying yoga from an Eastern trainer who can help to keep his temper and heart-rate low to soothe his inner beast.  Contacting an anonymous professor, code named Mr. Blue, in NYC, he sends blood samples to find an antidote to his radiation-afflicted condition.Tracking him from the Pentagon, General Ross (William Hurt) wants to make his gamma-ray rages into the army's new weapon of mass destruction.  On his side is guinea pig wannabe and Brit-accented Maj. Blonsky (Tim Roth) who is Banner and Hulk's nemesis.  Banner is on the run until he can catch up undetected to NYC and try Mr. Blue's hopeful cure to his raging condition.  Threading the main plot is his reunion with the general's daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Ross (an equally terrific Liv Tyler).  Their love brings a decency and tenderness to the film, providing a real antidote to the Frankenstein proceedings.  The father-daughter relationship is pivotal as well.  The movie makes it plain if indeed blood is truly thicker than water.This `Incredible Hulk' gets it right in the software (heart) if not the hardware (special effects).  The emotional context is right as we can only sympathize with Banner's plight.  Seeing the monster and some army maneuvering we're made so aware of the digitalized effects, I felt sometimes like I was watching the stiffness of video game graphics.  The running chases are far more impressive.  When the director gets up close to the scenes as they pass by, the effect is properly enthralling.  The suspenseful mood is often present, and the time it takes to tell the story is laudably spare.  Praiseworthy themes such as bio-ethics and combat ethics are explicitly weaved through the story.  It's also good to see William Hurt with a fresh performance as a crusty martinet after some stale roles.  I did feel the ending was a bit of a roadblock.  Smacking of signaled sequels, the ending made me feel I was a theatre-goer of old watching a serial drama.  Just tune in next year.  Yeah, but you can bet I'll be there.A J.P.'s Pick 3.5 *'s= Good-Very Good",4,'Beauty and the Beast',1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2439,"['Louis', 'Leterrier', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'everything', 'reverse', 'When', 'watching', 'comic', 'action-adventure', 'films', 'expect', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'perfect', 'script', 'flawed', 'Not', 'here', 'properly', 'pensive', 'screenplay', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'sensitive', 'yet', 'gripping', 'reading', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Hulk', 'only', 'what', 'important', 'right.Briefly', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Norton', 'out', 'Brazil', 'trying', 'yoga', 'Eastern', 'trainer', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'keep', 'temper', 'heart-rate', 'low', 'soothe', 'inner', 'beast', 'Contacting', 'anonymous', 'professor', 'code', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'NYC', 'blood', 'samples', 'find', 'antidote', 'radiation-afflicted', 'condition.Tracking', 'Pentagon', 'General', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'make', 'gamma-ray', 'rages', 'army', 'new', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction', 'side', 'guinea', 'pig', 'wannabe', 'Brit-accented', 'Maj.', 'Blonsky', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'nemesis', 'Banner', 'run', 'can', 'catch', 'up', 'undetected', 'NYC', 'try', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'hopeful', 'cure', 'raging', 'condition', 'Threading', 'main', 'plot', 'reunion', 'general', 'daughter', 'Dr.', 'Elizabeth', 'Ross', 'equally', 'terrific', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'love', 'decency', 'tenderness', 'film', 'providing', 'real', 'antidote', 'Frankenstein', 'proceedings', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'pivotal', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'plain', 'indeed', 'blood', 'truly', 'thicker', 'water.This', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'right', 'software', 'heart', 'not', 'hardware', 'special', 'effects', 'emotional', 'context', 'right', 'can', 'only', 'sympathize', 'Banner', 'plight', 'Seeing', 'monster', 'army', 'maneuvering', ""'re"", 'made', 'so', 'aware', 'digitalized', 'effects', 'felt', 'sometimes', 'was', 'watching', 'stiffness', 'video', 'game', 'graphics', 'running', 'chases', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', 'When', 'director', 'up', 'close', 'scenes', 'pass', 'effect', 'properly', 'enthralling', 'suspenseful', 'mood', 'often', 'present', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'laudably', 'spare', 'Praiseworthy', 'themes', 'such', 'bio-ethics', 'combat', 'ethics', 'are', 'explicitly', 'weaved', 'story', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'William', 'Hurt', 'fresh', 'performance', 'crusty', 'martinet', 'stale', 'roles', 'did', 'feel', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'roadblock', 'Smacking', 'signaled', 'sequels', 'ending', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'theatre-goer', 'old', 'watching', 'serial', 'drama', 'Just', 'tune', 'next', 'year', 'Yeah', 'can', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there.A', 'J.P.', 'Pick', '3.5', ""*'s="", 'Good-Very', 'Good']",N/A

1180467,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B001DHXT1G,A. Gammill,"[6, 7]","WARNING: This review contains SPOILERS.Coming on the heels of the terrificIron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition), I was a little concerned that lightning wouldn't strike twice for Marvel.  But I'm happy to report that The Incredible Hulk was every bit as good as Iron Man.  Maybe, in some small ways, even better.I was a huge fan of the Bill Bixy/Lou Ferrigno t.v. series, even though it bore little resemblance to the Marvel comic book.  But it was great entertainment, full of action, and a better-than-average peformance from Bill Bixby as Dr. David Banner.  Louis Letterier's big-screen reboot wisely takes a note (several notes, in fact) from the series, turning the film into a sort of ""Fugitive"" with gamma radiation.  There are several sly references to the t.v. show, including cameos by Ferrigno, the late Bixby, a young journalism student named Jack McGee, and for one brief nostalgia-laden moment. . .that aching, unforgettable piano theme which closed each episode.OK, fine, you say, what about the film itself?  Norton, who also co-wrote the script, handles his duties as Banner as well as can be expected.  I've never been a huge fan of Liv Tyler, but she's also well cast as Betty Ross (reportedly Norton wrote the part with Tyler in mind).  William Hurt overracts like mad as General Ross, who's probably the most ""comic book"" character in the film.  Well...no, Eli Roth's character becomes another rampaging creature, in a predictably CGI-heavy climax.Still, for all its occasional predictability and reliance on special effects, the film offers many fine moments.  The 2 or 3 big action set pieces are expertly-realized, with a standoff on a college campus standing out as one of the most memorable sequences.  And, like the Hulk of comic book origin, this Hulk can talk.  And although he's a creature of few words, I guarantee you'll remember each one.Although it was eclipsed by Iron Man in box office receipts, The Incredible Hulk was a solid hit, and is certainly a welcome addition to big-screen Marvel universe.  A closing cameo from Robert Downey Jr. ties the two films together neatly.  And you can bet we'll be seeing more Hulk on the big screen in the future.",4,"A pleasant surprise, and a fine tribute to the Bixby series",1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,2197,"['WARNING', 'review', 'SPOILERS.Coming', 'heels', 'terrificIron', 'Man', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'lightning', 'would', ""n't"", 'strike', 'twice', 'Marvel', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Maybe', 'small', 'ways', 'even', 'better.I', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Bill', 'Bixy/Lou', 'Ferrigno', 't.v', 'series', 'even', 'bore', 'little', 'resemblance', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'great', 'entertainment', 'full', 'action', 'better-than-average', 'peformance', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Banner', 'Louis', 'Letterier', 'big-screen', 'reboot', 'wisely', 'note', 'several', 'notes', 'fact', 'series', 'turning', 'film', 'sort', 'Fugitive', 'gamma', 'radiation', 'are', 'several', 'sly', 'references', 't.v', 'show', 'including', 'cameos', 'Ferrigno', 'late', 'Bixby', 'young', 'journalism', 'student', 'named', 'Jack', 'McGee', 'one', 'brief', 'nostalgia-laden', 'moment', 'aching', 'unforgettable', 'piano', 'theme', 'closed', 'episode.OK', 'fine', 'say', 'what', 'film', 'Norton', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'duties', 'as', 'Banner', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'expected', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'reportedly', 'Norton', 'wrote', 'part', 'Tyler', 'mind', 'William', 'Hurt', 'like', 'mad', 'General', 'Ross', 'who', 'probably', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'film', 'Well', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'character', 'rampaging', 'creature', 'predictably', 'CGI-heavy', 'climax.Still', 'occasional', 'predictability', 'reliance', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'many', 'fine', 'moments', '2', '3', 'big', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'expertly-realized', 'standoff', 'college', 'campus', 'standing', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'Hulk', 'comic', 'book', 'origin', 'Hulk', 'can', 'talk', 'creature', 'few', 'words', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'was', 'eclipsed', 'Iron', 'Man', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'was', 'solid', 'hit', 'certainly', 'welcome', 'addition', 'big-screen', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'closing', 'cameo', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'two', 'films', 'together', 'neatly', 'can', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'more', 'Hulk', 'big', 'screen', 'future']",N/A

1180471,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B001DHXT1G,Allen Bowers,"[3, 26]","I saw this movie in theatres with my girlfriend 3 months ago and damn were we both disappointed! Forgive me but I see that I am not in the majority of the Hulk fans who actually loved the first movie directed by Ang Lee. And I'm not ashamed to admit it either! But this movie on the other hand was just GOD-AWFUL!!! I admit what with them picking Edward Norton to play Bruce Banner I had my doubts anyway! I mean come on the script and the acting were as big a travesty as was for Blade Trinity, the casting was completely better in concept, the action just couldn't measure up to the other movie, and there was just too many needless cameos. Don't get me wrong Edward Norton is a great actor and all but he's just not an action star. And as for his performance well he just phoned it in. Liv Tyler who's really friggin' hot and drop-dead gorgeous and who usually puts in a decent performance was just dreadful here. To say nothing of the fact that acting and performance wise she's just not the best replacement for Jennifer Connelly as Betty. And other than that she kept on talking with this unbearably corny orgasmic voice! Which the way she did it was more annoying than sexy. William Hurt just didn't make it as Betty's soldier father. And why did he act like he was severly constipated all through the movie. Somebody please get this guy some Metamucil! Sam Elliot I would say did a so-so job at that role. And Tim Roth who I'm a big fan  of(and have been since Rob Roy) was trying too hard to put in a performance unlike like his usual best which just blew up in his face! Tim just shouldn't be trying so hard and just be consistent with his usual best. It's was also a huge mistake the way the Incredible Hulk was portrayed. Why did they have to make him out to be really stupid and lacking in common sense?! The Incredible Hulk I know would not have run the opposite direction when he's being shot at. Yay! he threw the soldier vehicles towards them! Wake me up when he's done! The Hulk I know would have thrown them,knocked their blocks off,or he would have pounded the ground to send a big shockwave their way more than he did. Also when the Hulk and Betty are sitting on a cliff and they lightning on the horizon, why would he do something stupid like throw a rock at the lightning?! Alot of good that'll do!! LOL!! The brief cameo by Stan Lee was just pointless. I mean why would they show him drinking a beverage that Bruce Banner accidently bled in only to never show you what happened to him afterwards. Tim Blake Nelson was however enjoyable enough as the comic relief when he portayed the scientist who had access to Bruce's Hulk DNA. The only problem was after Tim Roth roughs him up to steal Bruce's superpowered DNA you don't get much of a sense what the radiation that was given off did to Tim Blake Nelson's character! Needless to say the only truly cool cameo was that of Lou Ferrigno's security guy. Lou will always be The Incredible Hulk to me!

Intentionally channeling the Bill Bixby series more than its predecessor, this ""Hulk"" finds Banner on the run in South America, still trying to find a cure for his transformations into the Big Green One. Circumstances, of course, get in the way, with the military -- including General Ross (William Hurt) -- in hot pursuit of Banner, going so far as to send a newly Gamma-infused soldier (Tim Roth) into the fray in order to stop the Hulk from causing further damage. Banner, meanwhile, seeks help from old love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), who hasn't spoken to her military dad since Banner's accident, as well as a scientist (Tim Blake Nelson) who hopes to provide a serum to help our hero at least control his transformations.Loaded with effects and chase sequences, this ""Incredible Hulk"" is a lot more faithful in spirit and execution to the Marvel Comics -- as well as the old CBS series -- than its predecessor, no question. In-jokes and references for fans abound, from a quote of Joe Harnell's series theme to Lou Ferringo's cameo and vocal performances of the Hulk's dialogue as well (there's no mistaking Big Lou's ""Hulk SMASH!"" line). The Zak Penn script (which Norton rewrote, though without final credit) doesn't aim to be anything other than a basic, straight-ahead action movie, but the set-pieces are well-executed and the final brawl between the Hulk and the Abomination -- with splendid Rhythm & Hues effects -- is something that kids and comic book fans ought to find perfectly satisfying.The performances are all fine, and although one wishes there was more of a human element to this ""Hulk"" (something that Norton lamented was lost in Marvel's final cut, and could possibly be rectified by an extended DVD this fall), it's still an entertaining summer fantasy that finally does the Incredible one justice on the big screen.",4,"An Underappreciated ""Hulk"" That's Worth Your Time",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2180,"['2008', 'interesting', 're-boot', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'character', 'across', 'sequel', 'origin', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'Pretending', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'interesting', 'bonkers', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'never', 'happened', 'director', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', 'colorful', 'comic-book', 'saga', 'kinder', 'more', 'identifiable', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'form', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Intentionally', 'channeling', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'series', 'more', 'predecessor', 'Hulk', 'Banner', 'run', 'South', 'America', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'transformations', 'Big', 'Green', 'One', 'Circumstances', 'course', 'get', 'way', 'military', 'including', 'General', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Banner', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'send', 'newly', 'Gamma-infused', 'soldier', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'fray', 'order', 'stop', 'Hulk', 'causing', 'further', 'damage', 'Banner', 'meanwhile', 'help', 'old', 'love', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'who', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'military', 'dad', 'Banner', 'accident', 'as', 'well', 'scientist', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'who', 'provide', 'serum', 'help', 'hero', 'least', 'control', 'transformations.Loaded', 'effects', 'chase', 'sequences', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'lot', 'more', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'execution', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'CBS', 'series', 'predecessor', 'question', 'In-jokes', 'references', 'fans', 'abound', 'quote', 'Joe', 'Harnell', 'series', 'theme', 'Lou', 'Ferringo', 'cameo', 'vocal', 'performances', 'Hulk', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'mistaking', 'Big', 'Lou', 'Hulk', 'SMASH', 'line', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'script', 'Norton', 'rewrote', 'final', 'credit', ""n't"", 'aim', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'basic', 'straight-ahead', 'action', 'movie', 'set-pieces', 'are', 'well-executed', 'final', 'brawl', 'Hulk', 'Abomination', 'splendid', 'Rhythm', 'Hues', 'effects', 'something', 'kids', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'ought', 'find', 'perfectly', 'satisfying.The', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'one', 'wishes', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'human', 'element', 'Hulk', 'something', 'Norton', 'lamented', 'was', 'lost', 'Marvel', 'final', 'cut', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'rectified', 'extended', 'DVD', 'fall', 'still', 'entertaining', 'summer', 'fantasy', 'finally', 'Incredible', 'one', 'justice', 'big', 'screen']",N/A

I mean, we can't expect all of our superhero films to have the depth of character that Nolan or even Rami brought to their respective franchises, but we should expect that they are visually impressive.  `The Incredible Hulk' is just blandly created and looks so garish.  The Hulk himself looks awful, but the real sinker visually was that thing that comes of Tim Roth.  Seriously, that was a mess.  Other than the ridiculous use of CGI, the storyline is messy and the acting is terrible.  Edward Norton, who is usually VERY good, is wooden and merely a prop that leads to bigger and dumber things.  Liv Tyler first of all looks awful and her hushed voice is used desperately here.  She sounds like an idiot, and her performance lacks all conviction.

Ang had to go all Brokeback Hulk with 20 extra minutes of daddy issues and a WTF was that ending? The Incredible Hulk is simply put: AWESOME! It is a reboot that kicks Ang Lee and his daddy issues movie's ass. It pays homage to the HULK t.v. show most of us all loved (see opening sequence and listen for some familiar music). The cast is even better than last time. Eric Bana was good, but Bruce Banner was made for Ed Norton! And for the record, Tim Roth is one of hollywood's best actors and plays a fantastic antagonist, again (i.e. Rob Roy and Planet of the Apes). The movie follows Banner on the run still searching for a cure. General Ross is desperately seeking to capture the Hulk and turn him into the weapon he intended. Once he tracks him down the mayhem ensues and Ross' top soldier Blomsky wants the power of the Hulk for himself! It all leads to a knock your socks off battle that is one of Marvel's best!NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The Incredible Hulk rages on this transfer. Universal does it again with amazing picture and sound. I thought that the CGI Hulk would look less real on Blu because the clarity would only highlight flaws...I WAS WRONG! The blacks are great and actually the finer detail is picked up and makes the Hulk more lifelike! All the special features are carried over (watch the Alt Opening and see if you can find Captain America)! FINAL VERDICT: Seriously, I will HULK OUT if you don't upgrade.

I wouldn't go that far, but this Hulk is pretty good.More of a big-screen adaptation of the TV series than a sequel to 2003's ""Hulk"" (which I also enjoyed), this new ""Incredible Hulk"" cleverly pays homage to the enduring performances of Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, as well as to the overall asthetic of the TV show (the classic ""Lonley Man"" tune, for example). The human performances are excellent, particularly Ed Norton's, who was born to play troubled nerd Bruce Banner. Unfortunately, the ""Hulk"" himself is far from incredibly rendered by the CGI animators. Five years later, the Hulk still looks just as cartoonish, out of place, and, well, silly as he did in Ang Lee's 2003 endeavor (albeit a darker shade of green, and with a low-carb body fat percentage). Lately, I have seen some really good CGI that blends more or less seamlessly into the action. In this movie, there are fleeting moments when the Hulk seems like he might actually be there smashin' stuff, but those are few and far between.In addition to being a distractingly poor computer-generated cartoon, this film's Hulk is also kinder, gentler, and more vulnerable than the character's previous incarnations. Contrary to Dr. Banner's timeless warning, I like the Hulk when he's angry. For some reason, this version of the Hulk doesn't seem particularly perturbed. In fact, he moves and acts more like a shy, startled gorilla than like the embodiment of repressed anger gone berzerk. Humbug! The Hulk isn't a misunderstood, loveable ""Mighty Joe Young."" He is the epitome of explosive human rage! That's what makes him so dangerous - and compelling.Seeing a(nother) poorly animated, soulless version of the Hulk makes me reflect on the old TV series and just how inspired Lou Ferrigno's performance was. When Mr. Ferrigno put on the green makeup, the Hulk didn't need a hug. The Hulk was MAD! He was OUT-OF-CONTROL!

Genius.Victim of a Gamma Ray experiment gone horribly wrong.Dr. Bruce Banner. Hulk.And the military knows it. They were there. They saw what he became--a hulking, big green behemoth made of pure muscle, rage and power--and the damage he caused.Bruce (Edward Norton) has been on the run from them ever since, keeping a low profile and doing everything within his power to find a cure for the gamma poisoning that created the beast caged inside him. And now he thinks he has one, so he ventures back to the States to meet a scientist codenamed ""Mr. Blue"" whom he's been chatting with over a secure internet line to work up a cure. He also accidentally runs into the love of his life, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), and the two are now on the run from Betty's hotheaded military father, General Thaddeus ""Thunerbolt"" Ross (William Hurt), who wants to turn the Hulk into a weapon.They evade him for the most part until General Ross decides to supe-up his special soldier, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), and, once that super soldier proves not enough of a threat to the Hulk, Emil takes it on himself to make himself a greater match and forces Dr. Blue, aka Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), to turn him into something else--an Abomination.Now only the Hulk can stop this new mammoth creature and the two wage a crazy, awe-inspiring war through the streets of New York.It's time for Hulk to smash.I admit when I first heard about this movie I was leery. It was only five years before that Ang Lee's Hulk came out and I knew that The Incredible Hulk was meant to be a reboot, so I wasn't sure what to expect and, really, a reboot after only five years was just plain silly.As it turns out, this movie wasn't a reboot per se, but more of a do-over, in that during the credits it quickly gave the Hulk's origin story and then got into a story of its own without referring to the Hulk movie of 2003. And to make things even more ""separate,"" there was that oh-so-cool cameo at the end by you-know-who that cemented this new Hulk movie into the current timeline that Marvel's got going on in the movies, one that will take us up to The Avengers in 2012.What can I say? This movie was way better than Hulk. More action. Cooler story. More realistic. This really was a solid Hulk-smash type of movie that didn't get bogged down in so much drama like the one in 2003. I loved Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. Not only did he look the part of a scrawny scientist, he also acted like one plus also did a good job conveying the burden he carries and the suffering he has to go through because of what he is (i.e. sometimes living on the street).There was a chemistry between him and Liv Tyler, too. The two of them could easily pass as real-life lovers. This kind of realism was crucial in showing the sacrifices Bruce had made in order to protect those he cared about from the Hulk.The sheer power shown by the Hulk throughout this movie was just plain awesome. The strength displayed was astounding. The coolest display, in my opinion, was when the helicopter Betty was in caught fire and Hulk clapped his hands together so hard it sent a shockwave through the air to put out the flame.I enjoyed Tim Roth as the good-guy-turned-bad. He's always convincing. And when he became Abomination, the big fight between Abomination and Hulk was terrific: two giant titans going head-to-head, muscle against muscle, power against power. Fantastic.The Incredible Hulk was such a great movie and made you look forward to any sequels or cameos the Hulk will have in the future.Recommended.A.P.

Where Lang's film had its heart and basis in the comic books, the new version staring Edward Norton has its heart in the 1970s TV series.The film has some major ""slow"" spots, But the 3 or four main action sequences that are in the film are wll done. And there's a truly wonderful sequence where Edward Norton (non-Hulk mode) does his best Matt Damon impression and has a Jason Bourne-esque chase sequence through the slums of Brazil.Norton does a great job portraying Bruce Banner's desperation, but Jennifer Connely is sorely missed as Banner's paramour. Tim Roth does a decent job as the film's main villain, Abomination as well. Fans are also introduced to two other key Hulk comic book characters throughout the course of the film (I won't mention names here lest I spoil the surprise for Hulk fans).However, I will say the film has a very intriguing end  shot of Edward Norton that shakes up a bit what the traditional Hulk mythos has been.

I just never found it interesting as a kid so I wasn't going into this movie with high hopes or expecting a classic.  If anything, I expected another movie similar to King Kong, and well, that's sort of what the Incredible Hulk is.A big jolly green monster jumping around through the streets with a nasty attitude that suddenly develops whenever he turns big and green and scary.  It's like you can't be big and strong with a positive and welcoming attitude.He is more than capable of picking up vehicles and throwing them through the air, and that's also his main thing- picking up cars and slamming them down.  He does this quite a bit throughout the movie, and while I was already aware of his car-slamming techniques before watching the movie despite not knowing much about the Incredible Hulk character, it's good to know those little details were included in the movie.Also, there was plenty of action that kept me interested, such as TWO mega hulks grabbing a helicopter with a hot woman inside and trying to bring it down.  They eventually did.I knew there would be plenty of special effects and the film certainly delivers in that area.  Though one thing that kind of bugs me is how the regular guy keeps turning into the Hulk character while inside a dark area, so you don't actually see the transformation very often.  You almost do in one scene, and I appreciated that, but other than that one part I can't remember getting the opportunity to see him turn into the green monster.So what do we have as a final thought?

1180504,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B001DHXT1G,billy,"[5, 12]","The Incredible Hulk, the latest in the seemingly endless line of Marvel Comics affiliated movies is neither a sequel to nor a remake of Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003.  It's officially being called a reboot.  Though it's a better film than Lee's version which was filled with embarrassing moments like crazed mutated poodles and Nick Nolte, this version of the Incredible Hulk is about as underdeveloped plot wise as I've seen in a Marvel movie.  It flies by with little to no characterizations, plot development, or emotional connection for any of the characters.  Instead it's mostly loaded with chases and fights, which are generally well done, but they feel disconnected because the plot development is so lacking.One thing I enjoy about the Marvel movies is that they can generally be enjoyed by folks who aren't fans of the comic book.  They usually include an origin, establish the character, and outline the important relationships in his or her life early on in the movie.  This isn't the case with the Incredible Hulk.  We don't get much of an origin to speak off.  Instead, all we see is Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) being strapped in to some kind of machine during the opening credits.  We see glimpses of Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), General Ross (William Hurt) standing around watching Banner go through his experiments.  We see him turn in to the Hulk, trash some things, and in about two minutes we're done.  Being a comic book fan, I'm aware of Banner's origin and I'm familiar with the basic details of the Hulk.  But for a non-fan this can be confusing.  We don't get to see what led up to Banner's experiments, and the film makes a halfhearted attempt to explain it through some vague dialogue later on that's really not all that helpful.So after the cliff notes origin, we zip five years later to Brazil where Banner is working in a soda bottling factory and hiding from the US Government who's hunting him.  These scenes suffer from the same thin development as the origin scene.  He apparently has a love interest, an attractive woman who he works with, but we don't see them interact really.  He's also apparently working on keeping his anger under control, but we don't see him really struggle with it.  That's part of the appeal of the Hulk.  Banner struggles with having this immense power that he can't control.  Eventually General Ross gets wind of his location and we get first of the major action set pieces in the movie.  It's basically a mad dash through the small Brazilian Village that ends in a confrontation with the Hulk and Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) in the Soda Bottling plant.  Again, these set pieces are good visually and are exciting, but I find myself not caring because nothing has been established character-wise or plot-wise.From there we see Banner seek out his girlfriend Betty Ross and try to find a cure through the mysterious Mr. Blue/Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson).  We get more thin development of their romance, and another big action piece, but this time Blonsky is beefed up with super solider serum.  We're suppose to believe in Blonsky's growing obsession with the Hulk that drives him to further and further extremes, eventually ending in his becoming the Abomination.  Unfortunately, Roth, normally a good actor, seems too monotone to be believable.  I just didn't buy in to his whole aging warrior mentality and his obsession with Banner/Hulk.I don't think I need to summarize the rest of the plot.  It's zip along briskly until the last confrontation with Abomination and the Hulk.  We don't get any information on Betty's and the General's relationship either besides some superficial arguing, and we see a bit of Samuel Sterns who turns in to an important villain later on, but not much.  We also get to see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) make a cameo and tease an Avengers movie.  He's so much more charismatic than anyone else in the Marvel film universe.  Maybe they can just scrap an Avengers movie and make it an Iron Man and Wolverine movie instead.  Those are by far the most interesting characters they've put to film so far.This reboot of the Hulk is superficially entertaining, but it's thinly developed plot kept me from enjoying it too much.  They appear to be teasing a sequel, with Banner working on controlling the Hulk, and Sterns becoming a villain in the sequel.  They sort of botched the groundwork here though.  After Iron Man, this is a definite step down for the Marvel movies.",2,ADD Theater,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,4453,"['Incredible', 'Hulk', 'latest', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'line', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'affiliated', 'movies', 'sequel', 'remake', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', '2003', 'officially', 'being', 'called', 'reboot', 'better', 'film', 'Lee', 'version', 'was', 'filled', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'crazed', 'mutated', 'poodles', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'version', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'underdeveloped', 'plot', 'wise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'little', 'characterizations', 'plot', 'development', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters', 'Instead', 'mostly', 'loaded', 'chases', 'fights', 'are', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'feel', 'disconnected', 'plot', 'development', 'so', 'lacking.One', 'thing', 'enjoy', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'can', 'generally', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'folks', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'usually', 'include', 'origin', 'establish', 'character', 'outline', 'important', 'relationships', 'life', 'early', 'movie', ""n't"", 'case', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'origin', 'speak', 'off', 'Instead', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'being', 'strapped', 'kind', 'machine', 'opening', 'credits', 'see', 'glimpses', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'General', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'standing', 'watching', 'Banner', 'go', 'experiments', 'see', 'turn', 'Hulk', 'things', 'about', 'two', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'done', 'Being', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', ""'m"", 'aware', 'Banner', 'origin', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'basic', 'details', 'Hulk', 'non-fan', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'what', 'led', 'up', 'Banner', 'experiments', 'film', 'halfhearted', 'attempt', 'explain', 'vague', 'dialogue', 'later', 'really', 'not', 'helpful.So', 'cliff', 'notes', 'origin', 'zip', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'Brazil', 'where', 'Banner', 'working', 'soda', 'bottling', 'factory', 'hiding', 'US', 'Government', 'who', 'hunting', 'scenes', 'suffer', 'same', 'thin', 'development', 'origin', 'scene', 'apparently', 'love', 'interest', 'attractive', 'woman', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'interact', 'really', 'also', 'apparently', 'working', 'keeping', 'anger', 'control', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'really', 'struggle', 'part', 'appeal', 'Hulk', 'Banner', 'having', 'immense', 'power', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'Eventually', 'General', 'Ross', 'wind', 'location', 'get', 'first', 'major', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'movie', 'basically', 'mad', 'dash', 'small', 'Brazilian', 'Village', 'confrontation', 'Hulk', 'Emil', 'Blonsky', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Soda', 'Bottling', 'plant', 'Again', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'good', 'visually', 'are', 'exciting', 'find', 'not', 'caring', 'nothing', 'been', 'established', 'character-wise', 'plot-wise.From', 'see', 'Banner', 'seek', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'try', 'find', 'cure', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Blue/Samuel', 'Sterns', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'get', 'more', 'thin', 'development', 'romance', 'big', 'action', 'piece', 'time', 'Blonsky', 'beefed', 'up', 'super', 'solider', 'serum', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'believe', 'Blonsky', 'growing', 'obsession', 'Hulk', 'further', 'further', 'extremes', 'eventually', 'ending', 'becoming', 'Abomination', 'Unfortunately', 'Roth', 'normally', 'good', 'actor', 'too', 'monotone', 'be', 'believable', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'whole', 'aging', 'warrior', 'mentality', 'obsession', 'Banner/Hulk.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'summarize', 'rest', 'plot', 'zip', 'briskly', 'last', 'confrontation', 'Abomination', 'Hulk', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'information', 'Betty', 'General', 'relationship', 'superficial', 'arguing', 'see', 'bit', 'Samuel', 'Sterns', 'who', 'important', 'villain', 'later', 'not', 'much', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'make', 'cameo', 'tease', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'charismatic', 'anyone', 'else', 'Marvel', 'film', 'universe', 'Maybe', 'can', 'just', 'scrap', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'make', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'instead', 'are', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'put', 'film', 'so', 'far.This', 'reboot', 'Hulk', 'superficially', 'entertaining', 'thinly', 'developed', 'plot', 'kept', 'enjoying', 'too', 'much', 'appear', 'be', 'teasing', 'sequel', 'Banner', 'working', 'controlling', 'Hulk', 'Sterns', 'becoming', 'villain', 'sequel', 'sort', 'botched', 'groundwork', 'here', 'Iron', 'Man', 'definite', 'step', 'down', 'Marvel', 'movies']",N/A

I actually thought it was a pretty good movie and stayed true to the comic book mythos. Given, Ang took a few liberties here and there with things but, for the most part, it was worth going to see- to me. Other people, however, didn't think the first one was any good because of the fact that it wasn't like the TV show. Too, maybe it was the fact that there wasn't any real butt-whooping in the movie like Hulk is so big on doing in the comics. That's where the second movie comes in.The Incredible Hulk starts off with Banner in Brazil working at a soda company and living in the slums with his dog. He tries to live a quiet life while trying to work on a cure with an online friend of his called Mr. Blue. When General Ross finds out where Banner is hiding, he takes his group of military people and goes after him. Unfortunately, things don't turn out too well. A member of that squad named Blonsky is out for blood because his squadmates didn't make it so he talks Ross into letting him stay in the loop in tracking him down. That, my friends, is when things get interesting. Without giving anything away, let's just say that Hulk gets a little more than he bargains for.The Incredible Hulk-which was directed by Louis Leterrier(best known for Transporter 1&2)- is a more action-packed movie than its' predecessor. It moves at a brisker pace than the original and is, overall, a better movie for it. However, in my opinion, it is far from being as spectacular as the Spider-Man movies or the X-Men movies or even the recent Iron Man. It certainly has potential, though. Potential that I see Louis Leterrier expanding on if kept as the film series director. I did find several things kind of annoying concerning The Hulk in this movie. All were, basically, visual. First off, His color looked a little too dark to me. I'll admit, Ang Lee's version wasn't right either but it was more in the right direction. Second, there's not much resemblance between Banner and The Hulk when there should be. Banner's hair is brown whereas Hulk's is black.  Third, and lastly, his size isn't consistent throughout. Course, it is known that the angrier that Hulk gets, the bigger he becomes. While these are minor things, as a whole, it's those little things that make it a little less interesting to me.At any rate, overall, The Incredible Hulk is a great movie. Much better than the first and more rewarding on account of it. I highly recommend it.

1180506,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001DHXT1G,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 3]","Hulkamania is back on the screen! He's green! He's mean! He's ...uh ...green and mean.With less than five years separating Ang Lee's 2003 version entitled simplyHulk, French director Louis Leterrier (who's done a few questionable films in the recent past, includingTransporter 2and DANNY THE DOG akaUnleashed), takes up the Marvel comic book reigns and takes a shot at the pi$$ed off Bruce Banner.Replacing Erica Bana (Munich) as the Hulk/Bruce Banner is film star Edward Norton (The Painted Veil). Norton's film repertoire up to now has been fairly superlative:American History X,Death to Smoochy,Fight Club,The Italian Job,Down in the Valley, The Illusionist, and several other high caliber films decorate his resume, so I was expecting another engaging film from him. Although I found his performance to be good, the story suffered from a lack of direction; it's goal seeming to be only to tell you that another film is coming with the Hulk's involvement. In other words, no plot.Marvel has had a couple of successes lately, though, and one can't necessarily knock them for doing what they're doing, which is setting comic book fans up for ""something big"". Their highest claim to fame is undoubtedly Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. I loved Iron Man. Downey Jr. encapsulated the character and was both funny and cocky. A great match. But here, with THE INCREDIBLE HULK, we get a mish-mash of quality.Part of the problem is undeniably due to the fact that this film comes off the heals of Ang Lee's version. Lee's Hulk was anything but perfect, let's make that perfectly clear. But it did reinvent Hulk and gave us a unique look at the dynamics behind the character. Here in The Incredible Hulk, we get a forced love story (with no background, really), an intro to the Abomination, and lots and lots (and LOTS) of guns. The Abomination's inclusion will obviously play a vital part in upcoming films, and I appreciate that, but let's tell a good story along with it. Lee's Hulk, at the very least, did that.There are a few positive qualities here, though. The cast is fairly strong except for another wooden performance by William Hurt (Into the Wild). He seemed to be just going through the motions. There's also the fact that the film feels more like the television series, jumping us right into Bannon's life and his isolation due to his medical condition.

His ""Incredible Hulk"" is ever so much the wild, jaw-dropping blockbuster that Ang Lee's well-intentioned mood piece could and should have been. For me to simply say I was enthralled would be a gross understatement. This exciting, masterfully executed film blew me clear out of my chair!Edward Norton is Bruce Banner, hands down. He channels Bill Bixby's persona from the television series so perfectly, it's practically uncanny. And, the Hulk? Let me just say, seeing is believing! This is a phenomenally vast improvement over the spotty and altogether underwhelming CGI from Lee's film. The closing showdown with the equally impressive Abomination definitely makes an impact! It therefore goes without saying that I left the theater a very happy man.And now, I get to relive it whenever I want on DVD. The Three-Disc Special Edition, despite its hefty price tag, is clearly the one to go with. It offers extensive behind-the-scenes insight, most of which details the overall good times and dedication shared by everyone who helped make this movie so very satisfying. These are all people who obviously harbor a true understanding and respect for the source comic and television show. It is their sheer enthusiasm that makes sitting through this material all the more enjoyable. There are also quite the number of deleted scenes, spread out between discs one and two, that I found particularly interesting. That as it may be, I can still see why most of them were omitted from the final cut. Disc three, as many will already realize, grants viewers an opportunity to download a digital copy of the complete film to their I-Pod or personal computer. That may not personally appeal to me, but I still believed the remaining features were certainly more than enough to warrant a purchase.I'm fairly positive most others will feel the same.",5,"The TRUE ""Hulk"" Movie!",1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1912,"['Louis', 'Leterrier', 'should', 'now', 'be', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'fan', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'wild', 'jaw-dropping', 'blockbuster', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'well-intentioned', 'mood', 'piece', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'say', 'was', 'enthralled', 'would', 'be', 'gross', 'understatement', 'exciting', 'masterfully', 'executed', 'film', 'clear', 'chair', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'down', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'persona', 'television', 'series', 'so', 'perfectly', 'practically', 'uncanny', 'Hulk', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'seeing', 'believing', 'phenomenally', 'vast', 'improvement', 'spotty', 'altogether', 'underwhelming', 'CGI', 'Lee', 'film', 'closing', 'showdown', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Abomination', 'definitely', 'impact', 'therefore', 'saying', 'left', 'theater', 'very', 'happy', 'man.And', 'now', 'get', 'relive', 'whenever', 'want', 'DVD', 'Three-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'hefty', 'price', 'tag', 'clearly', 'one', 'go', 'extensive', 'behind-the-scenes', 'insight', 'most', 'details', 'overall', 'good', 'times', 'dedication', 'shared', 'everyone', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'very', 'satisfying', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'obviously', 'harbor', 'true', 'understanding', 'respect', 'source', 'comic', 'television', 'show', 'sheer', 'enthusiasm', 'sitting', 'material', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'spread', 'out', 'discs', 'one', 'two', 'found', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'may', 'be', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'why', 'most', 'were', 'omitted', 'final', 'cut', 'Disc', 'three', 'many', 'will', 'already', 'realize', 'grants', 'viewers', 'opportunity', 'download', 'digital', 'copy', 'complete', 'film', 'I-Pod', 'personal', 'computer', 'may', 'not', 'personally', 'appeal', 'still', 'believed', 'remaining', 'features', 'were', 'certainly', 'more', 'enough', 'warrant', 'purchase.I', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'positive', 'most', 'others', 'will', 'feel', 'same']",N/A

Still, I'm glad some executive somewhere saw the potential in this character and decided to give it another shot. This one had a lot more action than the first, and the Hulk actually talked! Very nice!What was weird was how this movie paid homage to the first film in a lot of ways, yet still managed to stay as its own. I can't say I was stoked to hear that Edward Norton would be taking over as Bruce Banner, but he managed to turn in a great performance. That final scene in the cabin was absolutely incredible in setting the stage for future movies.While this one made the least amount of money of the ""Big Three"" (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, and The Dark Knight), I still think it was a nice addition to the Summer.What Worked:* We saw the hero in the first 15 minutes of the film! For some reason, Ang Lee thought we were paying good money to see a movie call ""The Hulk"" but we didn't really want to see the big green guy, so he held out for the first hour before bringing him in. Bad move.* Action! Yes, we saw the inner struggle of Bruce Banner, but there was smashing in this one! The Hulk/Abomination fight was just like you'd imagine a real comic book smackdown to be like. He fought the army and the bad guy, and looked cool. I think Lou Ferrigno was a great guy, but his Hulk never jumped through the city at high speeds, or clapped out a fire. And yes, I know the Hulk looked like a video game character, but it's still better than getting some professional wrestler to wear green body paint for an hour!* Iron Man! To have a cameo like that from a movie that came out a month earlier was a home run!

And it's waaaaayyyy better than the last one.  There are inevitably comparisons to Iron Man since they are both superhero movies.  No, it's not as good as Iron Man.  But yes, it is a very fun watch.  I'd say that the plot of Iron Man is better than Hulk.  This film is pretty straightforward without much in the way of plot twists and such.  But that's fine.  The important part is HULK SMASHES.Edward Norton stars as David Banner.  His talents are wasted here to some degree, but he does a good job of making the character believable.  Liv Tyler is Betty Ross.  This was an interesting casting decision because she pretty much looks like a soccer mom plus collagen these days.  It's an interesting casting decision because she fits the character quite well, but the tendency in Hollywood is to choose a ""hot"" actress as the leading lady and I'd say Liv Tyler doesn't fit that bill anymore.  Ultimately I thought she was a good choice if a little atypical.The movie had great action and gave a good sense of what Hulk was always about:  rage, power, and revenge.  The final scenes were pretty open ended, but it didn't feel incomplete.  The story in the movie was finished but it still left a sense of wonder about what is going to happen next.

Sure it was aweful, and made some of us sweat with sheer hatred at the boredom we suffered. When made aware of this film some simply sighed and said, ""keep Ang Lee as far away as possible"" he's a great director but isn't a comic book movie maker. This adaptation wasn't a sequel, nor was it a reinvention, it was simply a nudge in the right direction and had Louis Leterrier say this is how it should have been done.Ed Norton now takes the role as Bruce Banner and is supported by the sexually appealing Liv Tyler. Yes, I said sexually appealing. The film starts off in Brazil where Bruce is hiding from the United States army and keeping the Hulk at bay. He works in a bottling plant and one day cuts himself leaving a drop of blood in one of the bottles, which makes an un-witting Stan Lee very ill indeed. By the way, off topic a little but can Stan Lee please stop with the cameos. Yeah, we get it Stan, you came up with the characters it doesn't mean you have to appear in every single Marvel movie ever made.Back on topic. The Army track Bruce through the sick Stan Lee and employ Emil Blonsky, a man who's very high ranking in the British Royal Marines and is entrusted to bring Banner back to the states. Things don't go too well and the Hulk is awakened and destroys the soldiers, escaping once again. Blonsky isn't happy and with the help of General Thadeus Ross, he is put in the super soldier program for round two with the Hulk.Meanwhile, Banner wants a cure for the Hulk so he seeks out Betty Ross to help him cure himself along with the help of the mysterious Mr. Blue.I can't really go further into the story as it all comes together at the end in one excellent climax, but as you can see in the cover it involves Abomination in some way. In my review title I mention that this is a nod to everything Hulk and I wasn't kidding. Just the little things you tend to notice more if they're familiar to you. The nod to the TV show with Lou Ferrigno having a cameo and a nod to the games in the final scene, Hulk smashes a police car in two and uses the parts as make shift boxing gloves. Comparing it to the first movie, this has definitely taken more inspiration from the comics. Utilising comic villains and giving a possible hint to a villain in a future installment. The look and general feel of the film are very cartoon like but are still very cool.Hopefully this, along with Iron Man will lead to much more comic inspired comic book movies being made. Sure, you can give us a comic movie with the main hero, but it's not really a comic movie if you take that character and change the world around them. A very enjoyable movie and worth the time, especially for the end fight sequence between Abomination and Hulk.",5,A Great Nod To Everything Hulk,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,2823,"['think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', ""'ve"", 'put', '2003', 'attempt', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'minds', 'Sure', 'was', 'aweful', 'made', 'sweat', 'sheer', 'hatred', 'boredom', 'suffered', 'When', 'made', 'aware', 'film', 'simply', 'sighed', 'said', 'keep', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'far', 'away', 'possible', 'great', 'director', ""n't"", 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'maker', 'adaptation', 'was', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'was', 'reinvention', 'was', 'simply', 'nudge', 'right', 'direction', 'had', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', 'say', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done.Ed', 'Norton', 'now', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'supported', 'sexually', 'appealing', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Yes', 'said', 'sexually', 'appealing', 'film', 'Brazil', 'where', 'Bruce', 'hiding', 'United', 'States', 'army', 'keeping', 'Hulk', 'bay', 'bottling', 'plant', 'one', 'day', 'leaving', 'drop', 'blood', 'one', 'bottles', 'un-witting', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'very', 'ill', 'indeed', 'way', 'off', 'little', 'can', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'please', 'stop', 'cameos', 'Yeah', 'get', 'Stan', 'came', 'up', 'characters', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'appear', 'single', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'ever', 'made.Back', 'topic', 'Army', 'track', 'Bruce', 'sick', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'employ', 'Emil', 'Blonsky', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'high', 'ranking', 'British', 'Royal', 'Marines', 'entrusted', 'bring', 'Banner', 'back', 'states', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'well', 'Hulk', 'awakened', 'soldiers', 'escaping', 'once', 'again', 'Blonsky', ""n't"", 'happy', 'help', 'General', 'Thadeus', 'Ross', 'put', 'super', 'soldier', 'program', 'round', 'two', 'Hulk.Meanwhile', 'Banner', 'cure', 'Hulk', 'out', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'help', 'cure', 'help', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Blue.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'further', 'story', 'together', 'end', 'one', 'excellent', 'climax', 'can', 'see', 'cover', 'Abomination', 'way', 'review', 'title', 'mention', 'nod', 'everything', 'Hulk', 'was', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'Just', 'little', 'things', 'tend', 'notice', 'more', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'nod', 'TV', 'show', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'having', 'cameo', 'nod', 'games', 'final', 'scene', 'Hulk', 'police', 'car', 'two', 'parts', 'make', 'shift', 'boxing', 'gloves', 'Comparing', 'first', 'movie', 'definitely', 'taken', 'more', 'inspiration', 'comics', 'Utilising', 'comic', 'villains', 'giving', 'possible', 'hint', 'villain', 'future', 'installment', 'look', 'general', 'feel', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'cartoon', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'cool.Hopefully', 'Iron', 'Man', 'will', 'lead', 'much', 'more', 'comic', 'inspired', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'Sure', 'can', 'give', 'comic', 'movie', 'main', 'hero', 'not', 'really', 'comic', 'movie', 'take', 'character', 'change', 'world', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'time', 'especially', 'end', 'fight', 'sequence', 'Abomination', 'Hulk']",N/A

1180526,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001DHXT1G,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","It's a nice tradeoff. While Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" was more character-driven, Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is an action spectacle, taken straight from the pages of a Marvel comic book. What fun, a movie so free with its implausible material yet not so over-the-top as to seem ridiculous. The entire concept is essentially a reworked version of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" with mild-mannered scientist Bruce Banner transforming into a monstrous green giant every time he gets angry. We pity him more than we fear him, even when he tosses cars through the air and punches out entire walls and aims deafening screams to the sky; his rage is not only uncontrollable, it's literally devastating. The Hulk may not be the most substantive character, and Banner is certainly not original as far as comic book scientists go, but they work nicely nonetheless, especially in a story this entertaining.Taking the reigns from Eric Bana is Edward Norton, who convincingly plays Banner as a driven man with many regrets in life, most of which stem from his altered genetic structure and his failure to control them. He's introduced in the Brazilian City of God, by day working in a soda-bottling factory, by night secretly communicating with an American scientist via e-mail. Known only as Mr. Blue, he sends Banner a number of things to help him find a cure for his rage. All appear to have failed, which is why he's being taught to manage his anger with deep-breathing exercises, the kind that push all your strong emotions into your stomach. He's always mindful of his pulse, because if it gets too high, he can no longer control himself. It isn't long before the American government finally locates him; they send a military team led by General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), now obsessed with extracting Banner's rage and creating an invincible super army.Ross' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler), eventually reunites with Banner, who had made his way from Guatemala to the state of Virginia in just seventeen days. Betty hasn't spoken to her father in a couple of years, which is understandable given his plan to use Banner's curse as a military weapon. We want to believe that there's some ounce of humanity left in this man, some remnant of awareness that what he's doing is wrong. Maybe there is, although his cold expression and distant voice make it difficult to say for sure; he may look as sinister as a classic power-hungry comic book villain, but I suspect that there's a decent person lurking somewhere underneath. It's possible that Betty suspects this too, because for better or worse, he will always be her father.It doesn't seem as if anything good can be found in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), assigned to Ross' team for his military expertise. After encountering the Hulk in Brazil, Blonsky subjects himself to genetic experimentation, which is designed to increase strength and agility. Of course, it also amplifies aggression, and this is bad because he was a hothead to begin with. He and Ross track Banner to New York City, where genetic scientist Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) may be able to cure Banner's rage. Unfortunately, Sterns is a little too ambitious for his own good, and much like Ross, he too is seduced by the idea of creating unstoppable super humans. He gives Blonsky a dose of Banner's special gene, which essentially unleashes a creature even more dangerous than the dreaded Hulk. A monstrous confrontation is imminent at this point, one that invariably sees the stylistic destruction of roads, cars, and buildings.And why not? I expect nothing less in a film about the Incredible Hulk, a character that functions purely on instinct, not on logic or reason. He doesn't want to save the day--he just wants to smash things. Only in a comic book adaptation would the American government want to harness and duplicate this destructive power, especially if it will earn them some respect. Does this mean that ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a social commentary? Probably not, although I did consider the idea that breeding an army of Hulks and using them as protection is akin to slavery. In all likelihood, this movie exists purely as escapist entertainment.You know this is true when you reach the ending, which cleverly combines ""The Incredible Hulk"" with another comic book franchise. You'll have to see for yourself which one it is; I suspect this merging will please a lot of movie audiences, mostly because two strong storylines will soon be working together. Be that as it may, there are plenty of other reasons to see ""The Incredible Hulk,"" not the least of which is Edward Norton's fine performance as the determined yet vulnerable Bruce Banner. You can't really say much about his angry alter ego, considering he's a nothing but a computer-generated green behemoth that destroys things (while managing to keep his pants on). We obviously feel very sorry for him, a man who can't be with the woman he loves, can't go anywhere without being chased, and can't escape his own anger. The movie doesn't explore this too deeply, but the special effects and fight sequences more than make up for it.",4,"The Mean, Green Anger Machine Returns",1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,5113,"['nice',

This puts in me in good company with Roger Ebert, but that's about it. And that's too bad, cause it was a good movie, it just wasn't what people wanted in a film about the Hulk. Having watched The Incredible Hulk, I know now what people wanted. What they wanted, simply, was ""HULK SMASH!"" Boy, do you ever get that in this movie, which reboots the Hulk franchise.Edward Norton turns in a memorable performance as Bruce Banner, tortured scientist who must remain calm as possible under any circumstances (he can't even have sex anymore cause it excites his body too much). He's being hunted down by General Ross, and has a love affair with Ross' daughter, Betty. He's trying to find a cure, living a solitary life, dodging the authorities, etc, etc. Really, it doesn't matter. The plot is entirely tacked-on and doesn't do much but serve as links between scenes where the Hulk gets to pop up.That the movie succeeds despite this is saying something. As I said, it isn't much more than scenes of pointless plot followed by lotsa action, but that action is damn impressive! It's amazing how much the effects have improved just since the first Hulk movie came out. Some people compared the original Hulk's look to Shrek, or animated lime Jell-o. He, and the Abomination, both look very impressive and reasonably convincing.But I have to say, much as I liked this movie, it wasn't nearly as deep or, frankly, good, as Iron Man. That point really gets driven home as you're constantly reminded of that better movie, as the military types use weapons from Stark Industries and Tony Stark himself puts in an appearance at the end of the movie. SHIELD gets their name dropped a lot, too. That does at least lend a sense of continuity with the previous film, as do references to the super soldier serum that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America.You also get a bit of a feeling of deja vu if, like me, you watched the old Hulk TV series back in the day. Not only doe Lou Ferigno do a cameo appearance in person, but he also voices the Hulk. Bill Bixby even turns up in a brief little cameo. Best of all, they use what Family Guy described as ""The sad walking-away music"" on the soundtrak. Very cool.Do I recommend this movie? Yes, but I strongly recommend seeing it on the big screen, since I think on TV it won't look nearly as impressive. Plus since there's apparently plans for movies with Thor, Captain America and Nick Fury, culminating in a film about the Avengers, it's worth seeing this movie so you'll have a better idea how it will link together with those.Even just as a stand-alone film, it is pretty damn entertaining and lots of fun.

Additionally, Ed Norton was a much more enjoyable and believable choice for Bruce Banner instead of Eric Bana's lethargic character. So Betty Ross and Banner WERE in love after all?!  You would have never known in the confusing mess of the Ang Lee movie.As a fan of The Incredible Hulk series and of the comic, there's rift in what people are expecting in the movie theaters. I actually applaud Ang Lee in his attempt to create something unique, because that's what was needed. However, Louis Leterrier was much more successful in capturing the sincerety of both the Banner and Hulk character without an overly artsy or psychological analysis. Sure there were some inconsistencies (changing back and forth from day to night during the village chase scene), and the effects still don't seem to be quite at a level to make them seamless with live-action...but both the writing and action were much better this time around.While there are various origin stories at this point, most people understand the concept by now. The Hulk is a great character: The classic innocent brute who has a basic concept of good, but who is persecuted by the world around him.

1180535,A1435P5AMCPB3X,B001DHXT1G,"Concerned One ""Thrashfan""","[3, 5]","This movie re-tells the tale of ""Hulk"" with new cast of characters.  Ed Norton plays Bruce, Liv Tyler plays Betty, and William Hurt as ""The General"".  They pick up in Brazil where Banner was at the end of the last ""Hulk"" movie, and negate the whole storyline of David banner passing on the ""Hulk"" gene to Bruce, who unlocks it in a lab accident. Then the rest of the movie develops around how the general is going to capture the Hulk back for the military use.Why three stars from me on this movie, and four for ""Hulk""?Here, they montage the creation of the hulk together in the opening credits by showing banner self experimenting and getting gamma poisoning and having a bad reaction with the test chemicals, unleashing the hulk.  This is what happened on the TV show and in the comics, but I thought it was too discounted and poor form to do underneath the opening credits.  That brought my rating down a bit.  Also, this animated version of the hulk i didn't care for as much as the ""HULK"" movie.  The details were just to overdrawn, to many ripples and textures. Finally, having Ed Norton play hulk and Liv Tyler play betty was like having Ben Affleck play DareDevil, bad casting.  I kept quoting Fight Club and Armaggeddon throughout the movie.  Too much actor baggage to bring along to characters who need to develop on their own.  They needed to keep Eric Bana, who brings fresher acting skills, like Tobey Mcguire did to Spiderman.  Overall, if marvel would have just had this movie made first, or made a sequel to Hulk to tie in the Avengers, it would have been better.I still recommend this movie, just not stongly. The Blu Ray format is excellent here with all the action and details, and worth picking up.FYI: The Alternate Opening is nothing to look forward to, a good choice to go with the montage, even though I didn't care for it, the lesser of two evils.",3,"Dissapointed since they negated ""Hulk"", But entertaining",1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1872,"['movie', 'tale', 'Hulk', 'new', 'cast', 'characters', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Bruce', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Betty', 'William', 'Hurt', 'General', 'pick', 'up', 'Brazil', 'where', 'Banner', 'was', 'end', 'last', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'negate', 'whole', 'storyline', 'David', 'banner', 'passing', 'Hulk', 'gene', 'Bruce', 'who', 'lab', 'accident', 'Then', 'rest', 'movie', 'how', 'general', 'going', 'capture', 'Hulk', 'back', 'military', 'use.Why', 'three', 'stars', 'movie', 'four', 'Hulk', 'Here', 'montage', 'creation', 'hulk', 'together', 'opening', 'credits', 'showing', 'banner', 'self', 'experimenting', 'getting', 'gamma', 'poisoning', 'having', 'bad', 'reaction', 'test', 'chemicals', 'unleashing', 'hulk', 'happened', 'TV', 'show', 'comics', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'discounted', 'poor', 'form', 'do', 'opening', 'credits', 'brought', 'rating', 'down', 'bit', 'Also', 'animated', 'version', 'hulk', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'HULK', 'movie', 'details', 'were', 'just', 'overdrawn', 'many', 'ripples', 'textures', 'Finally', 'having', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'play', 'hulk', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'play', 'betty', 'was', 'having', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'play', 'DareDevil', 'bad', 'casting', 'kept', 'quoting', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Armaggeddon', 'movie', 'Too', 'much', 'actor', 'baggage', 'bring', 'along', 'characters', 'who', 'need', 'develop', 'own', 'needed', 'keep', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'who', 'fresher', 'acting', 'skills', 'Tobey', 'Mcguire', 'did', 'Spiderman', 'Overall', 'marvel', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'movie', 'made', 'first', 'made', 'sequel', 'Hulk', 'tie', 'Avengers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better.I', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'stongly', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'format', 'excellent', 'here', 'action', 'details', 'worth', 'picking', 'up.FYI', 'Alternate', 'Opening', 'nothing', 'look', 'forward', 'good', 'choice', 'go', 'montage', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'lesser', 'two', 'evils']",N/A
1180536,AUCISQA1YXX86,B001DHXT1G,Confederate,"[2, 6]","Although IRON MAN was highly moralistic in many respects, making it a far better film, this is simply a reworked version of the old television show and a comic book. That the film would not only tip its hat, but adopt many of the same elements, including the four-note da-da-da-da in the background of one shot, made it a disappointment.This movie sets the stage for future movies. First, although the guest appearance of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) presages an AVENGERS movie, it's quite obvious that we'll see ""Mr. Blue"" reemerge later as THE LEADER, the gamma-charged superbrain (don't tell me you missed Mr. Blue's bulging brain as the ABOMINATION exits the laboratory....), and of course Roth's ABOMINATION isn't dead, which is a loose end in my book.Honestly, I preferred the first HULK movie. Not only was Banner (Eric Bana) a more rounded personality, Betty (Jennifer Connelly) was much more beautiful than the horsey Liv Tyler, whose lips had more silicone pumped into them than the HULK's bicuperous biceps. The story, while dark and complicated at times, was far more substantial. To pretend it didn't exist in this reworking is an almost Marxist disavowal of the first movie. Unfortunate.The evil Tim Roth was the superstar of this movie as he was the only one with real acting ability, and this ultimately makes this film a forgetter. It has some beautiful camera work and mood setting scenes, but it doesn't follow through with anything substantial. It's probably worth having in one's collection for a future rainy Saturday, but if you haven't seen it, don't expect too much from it.

Some folks might find it a big slow going in the first half hour but I enjoyed the colors and South American scenery during that time. I also enjoyed the acting of Edward Norton, who usually excels in whatever roles he plays.When the ""Hulk"" appears, it's pretty awesome even thought its also pretty obvious how computer-generated it looks....but who cares? The Green Monster might not have looked as realistic as the TV days when Lou Ferrigno was the big guy, but it looked very cool because of its size. If you enjoyed ""The Sandman"" in the last Spiderman movie, you'll enjoy this 2008 version of the Hulk, too.  By the way, if you can, watch both of those on Blu-Ray as they look incredible.One thing filmmakers do these days that I think is very nice is to pay tribute to the old actors who were in these stories years ago, either in film or on television. Here, there is a nice cameo scene by Ferrigno, who still looks in great shape, by the way. The former bodybuilder who was the green monster in the TV series that starred Bill Bixby, has a few lines in here as a security guard that will make you smile. I'm sure they would have had Bixby in this movie, too, had the man been alive. In the recent Superman film, ""Superman Returns,"" we saw Jack Larsen and Noel Neill, who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, respectively, on the 1950s ""Adventures of Superman"" TV series. This has been done in a few other movies, too.The ending to this film also was clever and tied in with another recently-issued movie. That's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the surprise. It makes me anticipate what's on the horizon.

She almost steals the show from everyone else involved on the screen.  She works extremely well with Edward Norton, who also makes an excellent Bruce Banner.  The struggle of fighting against the government's plan to use genetic manipulation as a war weapon always makes for a good action flick, and The Hulk does not drop the ball on that history.The storyline keeps moving along, and the rich landscape scenes make this movie play out like an artistic wonderland filled with covert operations and outright war in the streets.  The CGI was able to make The Hulk come off the pages of the comic books and appear on screen.  That said, I still had a problem with the cartoon-look at different times in the movie.  I also found it a little strange that in the final fight scene of the movie there just happened to be a giant chain to for The Hulk and Abomination to choke each other with.  I mean what are the odds that such a huge chain would just fall into the battle in the middle of the city.I do believe Sam Elliot would have been a better choice than William Hurt in the role as General Ross.

A commentary track featuring director Louis Leterrier and actor Tim Roth is first. The track begins with the work that went into the film's opening credit sequence. Not only does this sequence pay homage to the original television show, but it sets up the film by establishing itself as a separate entity from Ang Lee's film (thank God!). From there, the track offers fairly standard stuff, with some light discussion of sets and shooting locations, Stan Lee's cameo, the work of the other cast and crew members, the special effects, make-up, sound design, and other tidbits. It's a very average track, worth a listen for hardcore fans, but skippable for most of us. The Incredible Hulk is also U-Control enabled. There are several options to choose from. The Thunderbolt Files provides biographies of various characters, Bruce Banner's location, and Ross' mission parameters. Scene Explorer allows viewers to see various sequences in the film in several stages of development. Comic Book Gallery shows various images from the Hulk comics. Animated Comic showcases how scenes from the film were influenced by scenes found in previous comic books. Finally, a standard picture-in-picture feature is available that features behind-the-scenes videos, cast and crew interviews, and more.An alternate opening to the film (1080p, DTS-HD MA 5.1, 2:34) is next, followed by 23 deleted scenes (480p, 42:45). The Making of Incredible (1080i, 29:54) examines Louis Letterier's initial involvement and the strengths he brought to the film, the casting of the primary characters, shooting locations, special effects, shooting techniques, and more.The Incredible Hulk is BD-Live (Blu-ray profile 2.0) enabled. The disc offers a brief text-based introduction to the technology. Upon accessing the BD-Live home page, users must first create an account to access the extra content. The main page is attractive and easy to navigate.The Incredible Hulk is a fine example of a comic book movie done right. It offers amazing visuals and plenty of action, but, more important to the story, never falters in the areas of character development and narrative, which are crucial in creating a fulfilling cinematic experience. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Bat Man Begins and The Dark Knight are all shining examples of the comic book-based movie done absolutely right, and 2008 will be remembered as one of the best years the genre has seen to date. Universal brings The Incredible Hulk to Blu-ray in a package that is a definite must-own. Featuring excellent video quality and a reference-grade soundtrack that raises the bar for action movie extravaganza mixes, not to mention a jam-packed supplemental section, a digital copy of the film, and a unique green-colored Blu-ray case, the disc is impossible to resist. The Incredible Hulk comes highly recommended to all comic book-based movie fans.Are you still reading this?

Going up against 2 of the greatest comic book movies in the same year (Iron Man & The Dark Knight) doesn't help 'The Incredible Hulk' but the #1 problem with this movie is how few chances this movie takes.  None of the casting choices are great (although none are poor), and the script is so blah it's the kind of movie that you want to just sit down, veg and not think too much about.At the beginning of the movie we get a quick rundown of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk, we see he's on the run and General Ross is going after him.  Ross is commissioned Emil Blonsky (who later becomes the Abomination) who help lead the team to get the Hulk and there is a weak love story with Banner and Ross' daughter Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler).  Possibly worse than the script is the pitifully weak acting by said Tyler.  In the comics Betty was always a stronger character but here she is the mega damsel in distress.  She is supposed to be a Phd. but she's very wimpy and the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  Norton is acceptable but he's 10 years since his amazing 'American History X' role and he's subdued but nothing special.The thing that is special is the CGI which is fantastic.  The last 15 minutes of the movie is a CGI tour de force and it's amazing how computer work gets better every 6 months or so.  Much more believable than the 2003 Hulk movie this is a grand accomplishment.If you want a popcorn movie that is just something to watch and you can leave your brain on the shelf this is nice.

This movie was marketed as appropriate for adult audiences, but it's actually an annoying story written for ten-year-olds!It's been a long time since I seen such a boring and tedious film! Even Iron Man with all its many flaws was better than this sorry story! And what's up with Edward Norton? His acting was so bad it felt like he was reading off of a teleprompter! It was incredibly distracting. Was he drugged, or something? - One things for certain: Bill Bixby, he ain't!I also got a laugh out of Hollywood thinking an American audience is so dumb about world geography they would believe the teeming slums of some major city in Brazil is next to the Guatemalan/Mexican border! - Let's say you are in Northern Brazil. To make it to the Guatemalan/Mexican border you have to go through either Venezuela, Columbia or both! Then you must cross through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and then Honduras. Quite a distance! But the Incredible Hulk, who has neither wings, nor magic, nor teleporting abilities or a private jet, makes it all the way to the Guatemalan/Mexican border in less than a night!Memo to Hollywood: I know you're going for the quick buck after losing so much money during the Writer's Strike! There have been so many awful movies this past Spring (2008) that I'm getting worn out! But I'm an optimistic person. Could you please, please, make your next Comic Book related film as brilliant as Spiderman #3, X-Men #2, or as good as any of the six Star Wars films? Is that asking too much?

1180551,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B001DHXT1G,Daryl B,"[1, 1]","It seems Marvel has done a wise thing in producing the movies based on their beloved comic book characters.  With ""Iron Man"" a huge hit and quickly approaching the 300 million dollar mark domestically, they've proved they can give their superheroes the treatment they deserve.  Now, they've rebooted the Hulk franchise with a convincing if not entirely complete success.Almost everyone who saw the first film a few years ago are bound to compare the two.  While the first movie was not as bad as many thought, it just lacked the action and true spirit that this film supplies.  With the origin story out of the way, this second film can focus on Bruce Banner and his fight with the green demon inside him.  Also, we are treated to the action in a quicker manner and the story moves along with a better flow than its predecessor.This time around, the General, Betty's father (played well by William Hurt in this film) is determined to capture Banner to create the perfect weapon, superhuman soldiers who would be nearly invincible. With the help of an overzealous and blood-thirty marine (played wickedly by Tim Roth), the duo stalk Banner at every turn until he must return home to the US and try again to cure his powerful alter-ego.  Once home, Banner (Ed Norton in a performance that is quietly reminiscent of Bill Bixby) looks for the woman he loves, Betty Ross.  On the run with Betty, Bruce is desperate to find a way to exterminate the hulk, no matter the cost.  Unfortunately, the creation of the evil Abomination, proves to be a reason to keep the green giant alive...for now.The director of ""The Incredible Hulk"" gives fans of the comic character what they truly want---action.  Ang Lee, a superb director, misfired with his film adaptation but this version will appease most fans.  Norton and Tyler as Bruce and Betty have good chemistry and Roth makes a chillingly evil villain.  My one complaint (and its really a small one) is that I hope in the future they will continue to work on the CGI hulk.  He wasn't bad but I think they can continue to improve the visuals to make him look more realistic in time.  The final fight sequence was great and the cameos of Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno (as well as a nod to Bill Bixby at the beginning of the film) are nice touches.  And the final cameo, Robert Downey Jr, as Tony Stark was a great way to end the film (as well as setting up the inevitable Avengers movie)!Recommended for all those who enjoyed the Hulk comics, for fans of action films and for anyone who enjoys a good summer popcorn movie!

I've heard that Marvel Studios insisted on deleting a lot of the more character driven moments to deliver a leaner film, and I recall some intriguing clips from the theatrical trailer that did not appear in the final version.  Hopefully, a director's cut will be released on DVD, because I think the film would have benefited from more of a human dimension.  Nevertheless, I was swept up in the story and had a great time.  Marvel seems to be laying the groundwork for a whole set of interrelated films through the cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, passing references to SHIELD and Stark Industries, and the use of the super-soldier serum, which appears to be laying the foundation for a Captain America movie.  (By the way, Farscape's Ben Browder would be ideal for that role, although I'm sure they would prefer to go with a bigger name.)

People may think of this as mainly an action film and compared to Ang Lee's version, there is a lot more action but it is far more than that. The action is brilliant but it's also the relationships between characters, the chase element of the movie, the good dialogue and the great acting, that make this a great movie. Personally, I thought this was better than the Ang Lee version although I don't mind that version either.It's a fairly fast paced action thriller balanced just right with enough slower paced scenes. Hulk as the protaganist taking on the US army, including a bad ass/superpowered Tim Roth and then the supervillian Abomination at the end, is all very cool. The whole build up of the movie where he's hiding out in Brazil, living in the favelas and working in a local factory is great.Liv Tyler makes a great Betty Ross, the love interest. In fact all the characters are handled very well by the actors and Ed Norton is by far the best Bruce Banner I've seen. Shame he wasn't in the Avengers film.Definitely check it out!, especially if you're a superhero film fan and goes without saying if you're a Hulk fan.

The sound was powerful at times, and the DTS sound was powerful and effective during shooting and ""thunderous/base"" portions. It was not as powerful as some other Blu-Ray films I've seen.I prefer a gripping story over over the top effects, but you expect the latter when you watch a super hero action movie. I am a fan of Ed Norton and thought his portrayal as a meager guy engulfed in his superpower worked for the film. His ""every-day guy"" look worked to express the juxtaposition with the hulk. Liv Tyler continues to be flat in her affect for most of her films, so I just could not sympathize with her character.I do wish that the movie was paced faster. Aside from 3 action scenes, this was a slow moving film in the super hero genre. The last 20 minutes of the film were a standout, where effects are concerned, and the tie in with Iron Man was a welcomed tidbit at the end, which showed continued promise for the franchise.I had hoped that they would take an opportunity to share more info about how the Hulk had gotten his superpower and what research had been done with Betsy's character.

This creature was so cartoonish my suspension of disbelief evaporated even faster than a Liv Tyler tear, making the INCREDIBLE HULK a most annoying viewing experience.  Don't get me wrong:  I truly admire comic-based movies that are engaging and well made (case in point,Iron Man); but when the action hero is presented so grotesquely over the top as this version of The Hulk, all bets are off.Which is kind of sad, as I'm a big fan of Ed Norton films (and this is the first one of his movies that I did not enjoy); yet Norton's considerable talent is wasted here, as he's little more than a prop between monster manifestations.  Liv Tyler is a solid thespian as well (and easy on the eye), but she, too, seems to be going through the motions.  William Hurt plays a great villain, and is one of INCREDIBLE HULK's few positives, while all I could do was just laugh at Tim Roth as a deranged soldier turned Hulk Antagonist (and if you think Hulk is over the top, wait 'til you see Roth's Cloverfield-looking get-up).Lastly, Norton's Bruce Banner character always wears elastic-band pants under his everyday clothes so that should he ""change"" he will at least be modestly attired.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","In 2003, Ang Lee directed a brooding, inward-looking movie about the Incredible Hulk... and it bombed at the box office as badly as it did with fans.So there was much rejoicing when the franchise got rebooted five years later with ""The Incredible Hulk."" This is what a movie about a giant green rage-monster should be -- a lean, muscular action movie with a thread of bittersweet romance, and solid performances by William Hurt, Edward Norton and Liv Tyler.A few years ago, Bruce Banner was exposed to gamma radiation in a failed military experiment, which turned him into a giant green berserker. Ever since then, the cruel General Ross (Hurt) has been mercilessly pursuing him, so they can create giant green soldiers.And after a few years hiding in Brazil, Banner is finally found by the military... only to end up on the run after he Hulks his way out of the confrontation. He may be able to get a cure, but only if he gets the original data from the experiment, which means sneaking back into the US to see his ex-girlfriend Betty (Tyler). Betty is also Ross's daughter. Awkward.And after the military attacks him again, Banner ends up hulking out, then goes on the run with Betty to find a cure. But he doesn't know that Ross has taken special measures to capture him, by dosing elite soldier Neil Blonsky (Tim Roth) with a supersoldier serum -- which unleashes a monster far worse than the Hulk.""The Incredible Hulk"" gave audiences everything that Ang Lee's movie was missing. It has pretty much everything you can ask from a movie about a giant green id-monster -- lots of explosions, gunfire, chases, and a core story about a man whose life is destroyed by the ambitious people who want to use the Hulk's power.And the movie lopes along at a fast pace, slowing down for the occasional romantic scene when Betty and Bruce are alone. There are some funny moments (""Don't make me... hungry!""), but the overall mood is a somber one -- you're always aware of danger, and how much Bruce has lost through no fault of his own.The one problem I have with this movie? Edward Norton. Don't get me wrong, his performance is absolutely stellar, and his rewrites of the script made the movie even better. But he doesn't quite work as the quiet, shy nerd -- he can't turn off the wiry intensity that he always exudes.But the other actors are spot on -- Hurt as a cold, sociopathic soldier who doesn't care who dies as long as he gets the Hulk, Tyler as the loving supportive Betty who can soothe the savage beast, and Roth as a battle-happy soldier whose obsession with fighting turns him into a monster.""The Incredible Hulk"" is exactly what you'd want from a Hulk movie -- romance, tragedy, and Hulk smashing.

1180577,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B001DHXT1G,E. David Swan,"[3, 3]","I am one of the few people who thought that Ang Lee's Hulk was a brilliant film that transcended traditional super hero films. The 2008 Hulk is 6% higher on Rotten Tomatoes than Lee's effort and made just slightly more money but the general consensus seems to be that it is a significantly better representation of the Hulk. I humbly disagree.The film starts off well enough with David Banner working at a bottling plant in South America. He spends his spare time training himself to control his heart rate. Apparently The Hulk is unleashed when he reaches the dreaded 200 BPM. Seems like a pretty high threshold but you'd be surprised out how often Banner gets up there. While fixing a machine switch Banner manages to slice his hand and several drops of blood drop onto the production line causing Banner to run down and stop the conveyor belt. He wipes off the blood but fails to notice that one drop made it into a bottle. The viewer gets to watch the bottle sealed and shipped where an unsuspecting Stan Lee pops it open, takes a swig and... what... dies??? I'm not sure. He just drops to the ground. It turns out this entire sequence was useless filler and this is one of my great problems with the film. Why so much filler in a film that clocks in at less than 2 hours.My next issue is with casting. William Hurt is a great actor and he has the look of Gen. `Thunderbolt' Ross down but Hurt has such a calming voice and relaxed demeanor it just doesn't fit the character. Sam Elliot was perfect. I also miss Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross. Edward Norton does a fine job as David Banner and I always enjoy Tim Roth except that he's British and Emil Blonsky was Russian.So after his cover is blown Banner makes his way back to the states setting up perhaps the best scene in the movie when Betty Ross spots Banner for half a second in a diner. It really was well done. Unfortunately it's spoiled when Betty walks outside and the audience sees Banner cowering behind a dumpster. In the next scene Banner is walking down a road and Betty pulls up in a car so the impact of the diner scene is completely spoiled.At this point the movie finds its raison d'Etre, the repeated encounters between Banner and Blonsky. So the Army manages to locate Banner and launches a full scale assault prompting the Hulk to appear. Despite there being at least a dozen or so military vehicles Betty Ross magically knows that one contains her father and blocks its path. Meanwhile Blonsky has had a small dose of the same formula that created The Hulk and dances around dodging the Green Goliaths attacks like a Mexican jumping bean. Long story short, Hulk smashes puny army men. Blonsky stands right in front of the Hulk taunting him with, `Is that all you've got' prompting the Hulk to punt him like a football. Why would Blonsky do something so retarded? Because later we get to see his incredible healing powers, in other words because it's in the script.More filler including a long sequence that stretches back to the beginning of the film where Banner tries to find a cure. It goes nowhere but sets up the big finale. Banner is captured and to my utter bewilderment is taken away in an army helicopter awake and unshackled. Why would they leave Banner unrestrained with Betty Ross? Seems like it would be a rather tense situation for Banner, he might even get angry and you wouldn't want to see him angry. Elsewhere Blosnky gets a full dose of Gamma radiation and goes into full Abomination, wreaking havoc on a busy city street. Aha, Banner needed to be free so he could fight Blonsky. Now THAT is some lazy scripting.Hulk try to save puny humans by smashing ugly Abomination while Betty and the General stand there slackjawwed like a couple of country yokels. I mean seriously. Blonsky wants to kill the General and The Hulk has to work hard to protect them because the Ross's are too dumb to flee. As a final insult to the viewing audience The Hulk is about ready to finish off Blonsky when Betty asks him to stop. With his job done the Hulk bounds off into the sunset. At this point I assume the Abomination then wakes up and finishes off the city.This movie really insulted my intelligence. The scripting is silly. I much preferred the look of the Hulk in the first movie rather than this hyper ripped Hulk. Most of the fight scenes are very dark particularly the excessively long finale versus The Abomination. I like the fact that they kept the Hulk's size consistent and the scene of the Hulk roaring in fury at thunder was classic but I stand in the vast minority who thinks this movie pales in comparison to Ang Lee's version.",3,Hulk Smashes Puny Audiences Intelligence,1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,4627,"['am', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', 'was', 'brilliant', 'film', 'transcended', 'traditional', 'super', 'hero', 'films', '2008', 'Hulk', '6', '%', 'higher', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'Lee', 'effort', 'made', 'just', 'slightly', 'more', 'money', 'general', 'consensus', 'be', 'significantly', 'better', 'representation', 'Hulk', 'humbly', 'disagree.The', 'film', 'starts', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'David', 'Banner', 'working', 'bottling', 'plant', 'South', 'America', 'spare', 'time', 'training', 'control', 'heart', 'rate', 'Apparently', 'Hulk', 'unleashed', 'when', 'dreaded', '200', 'BPM', 'pretty', 'high', 'threshold', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'out', 'how', 'often', 'Banner', 'up', 'there', 'fixing', 'machine', 'switch', 'Banner', 'slice', 'hand', 'several', 'drops', 'blood', 'drop', 'production', 'line', 'causing', 'Banner', 'run', 'down', 'stop', 'conveyor', 'belt', 'blood', 'notice', 'one', 'drop', 'made', 'bottle', 'viewer', 'watch', 'bottle', 'sealed', 'shipped', 'where', 'unsuspecting', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'open', 'swig', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'just', 'ground', 'out', 'entire', 'sequence', 'was', 'useless', 'filler', 'one', 'great', 'problems', 'film', 'Why', 'so', 'much', 'filler', 'film', 'less', '2', 'hours.My', 'next', 'issue', 'casting', 'William', 'Hurt', 'great', 'actor', 'look', 'Gen.', 'Thunderbolt', 'Ross', 'down', 'Hurt', 'calming', 'voice', 'relaxed', 'demeanor', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'character', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'was', 'perfect', 'also', 'miss', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'fine', 'job', 'David', 'Banner', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'British', 'Emil', 'Blonsky', 'was', 'Russian.So', 'cover', 'blown', 'Banner', 'way', 'back', 'states', 'setting', 'up', 'perhaps', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'spots', 'Banner', 'second', 'diner', 'really', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'spoiled', 'when', 'Betty', 'walks', 'outside', 'audience', 'Banner', 'cowering', 'dumpster', 'next', 'scene', 'Banner', 'walking', 'down', 'road', 'Betty', 'up', 'car', 'impact', 'diner', 'scene', 'completely', 'spoiled.At', 'point', 'movie', 'raison', ""d'Etre"", 'repeated', 'encounters', 'Banner', 'Blonsky', 'Army', 'locate', 'Banner', 'full', 'scale', 'assault', 'prompting', 'Hulk', 'appear', 'being', 'least', 'dozen', 'so', 'military', 'vehicles', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'magically', 'one', 'father', 'path', 'Meanwhile', 'Blonsky', 'had', 'small', 'dose', 'same', 'formula', 'created', 'Hulk', 'dances', 'dodging', 'Green', 'Goliaths', 'attacks', 'Mexican', 'jumping', 'bean', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'Hulk', 'puny', 'army', 'men', 'Blonsky', 'right', 'front', 'Hulk', 'taunting', ""'ve"", 'got', 'prompting', 'Hulk', 'punt', 'football', 'Why', 'would', 'Blonsky', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'retarded', 'later', 'get', 'see', 'incredible', 'healing', 'powers', 'other', 'words', 'script.More', 'filler', 'including', 'long', 'sequence', 'back', 'beginning', 'film', 'where', 'Banner', 'find', 'cure', 'nowhere', 'up', 'big', 'finale', 'Banner', 'captured', 'utter', 'bewilderment', 'taken', 'away', 'army', 'helicopter', 'awake', 'unshackled', 'Why', 'would', 'leave', 'Banner', 'unrestrained', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'tense', 'situation', 'Banner', 'might', 'even', 'get', 'angry', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'angry', 'Elsewhere', 'Blosnky', 'full', 'dose', 'Gamma', 'radiation', 'full', 'Abomination', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'busy', 'city', 'street', 'Aha', 'Banner', 'needed', 'be', 'free', 'could', 'fight', 'Blonsky', 'Now', 'THAT', 'lazy', 'scripting.Hulk', 'try', 'save', 'puny', 'humans', 'smashing', 'ugly', 'Abomination', 'Betty', 'General', 'stand', 'there', 'slackjawwed', 'couple', 'country', 'yokels', 'mean', 'seriously', 'Blonsky', 'kill', 'General', 'Hulk', 'work', 'hard', 'protect', 'Ross', 'are', 'too', 'dumb', 'flee', 'final', 'insult', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Hulk', 'about', 'ready', 'finish', 'off', 'Blonsky', 'when', 'Betty', 'stop', 'job', 'done', 'Hulk', 'off', 'sunset', 'point', 'assume', 'Abomination', 'then', 'up', 'finishes', 'city.This', 'movie', 'really', 'insulted', 'intelligence', 'scripting', 'silly', 'much', 'preferred', 'look', 'Hulk', 'first', 'movie', 'rather', 'hyper', 'ripped', 'Hulk', 'Most', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'particularly', 'excessively', 'long', 'finale', 'Abomination', 'fact', 'kept', 'Hulk', 'size', 'consistent', 'scene', 'Hulk', 'roaring', 'fury', 'thunder', 'was', 'classic', 'stand', 'vast', 'minority', 'who', 'movie', 'comparison', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'version']",N/A

The flashback reminders that zip through the opening credits don't help.  They never paused long enough to jar one's memory or give a boost to someone who has absolutely no idea who or what the Hulk is and why it's dangerous to make him angry.Never mind, sorry, no time to pause... before you know it, ready or not, new story, new locale, new actor, brief homage to Bill Bixby and a walk-on by Lou Ferrigno, and we're off.Why is he in Brazil of all places?  I know he's hiding out and all that, but still, Brazil?  It's not as if he wasn't easily found there.  I'd also like to know exactly where he lost his personality, Mexico?  Did they hire Edward Norton only because he sufficiently looked the part of a scientist/geek?  Or did they want someone so invisible that when the Hulk appears he really stands out?  And why was Tim Roth in this movie?  Anyone could have played that part, a stand-in even.  Was he hired for his lack of height?  As for William Hurt (I don't care if he did win an Oscar several decades ago), he only comes across as ruthless because they wrote him that way; he brings absolutely no menace to the part on his own.  Come to think on it, the only good parts in this movie were the three action sequences set so far apart I almost fell asleep waiting for them.  Each one an ambush; how many times can you ambush this guy before it figures it out, which he didn't, so I guess the answer is: he's a sucker for a good or bad ambush every time!  And this guy was supposed to be a brilliant scientist!  Hello!  He had enough sense not to use credit cards or cell phones yet he sends an email that's easily traced!?  Now that's congenitally stupid.This, for me, was an extremely frustrating movie (the very end only made it worse).  I hope there's not a 3rd attempt to get the green guy right.(I had a hunch I wasn't going to like this movie, which explains why I stalled so long before watching it.

I try to avoid judging a film based on its original source if it has one (in this case; the comic books).  However, ""The Incredible Hulk"" sort of forces you into mentioning the source material.  It also is helpful to use the first film ""The Hulk"" as a point of comparison since Marvel did not dispense with that films story line completely.  With that said, lets get into the point of the title above; though entertaining, this film had serious flaws that kept it from the greatness achieved by the landmarks ""Spiderman"" and ""Iron Man"".-BETTER THAN BADMany people absolutely loathed the first Hulk film.  The story was slow and drawn out, Eric Banna was inappropriate as Bruce Banner, the villain was horrible and many complained of the CGI as looking too ""Video Game"". The new film corrects much of this.  The stories pacing moved along nicely and with purpose.  Ed Norton fit into the Bruce Banner ""suit"" perfectly in both physique and demeanor.  The villain (Tim Roth) was both well developed and formidably exciting.  The visual FX... the visual FX...  Well 3 out of 4 isn't so bad I suppose.-WORSE THAN GREATIf you thought the first Hulk film looked fake then be prepared; this stuff does not look real at all.  I actually thought the first film did a more convincing job of capturing the texture of skin.  In the new film the Hulk's skin looks like salamander skin; always shiny.  Unfortunately this was not the only glaring flaw.  In a comic book movie you expect to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the obviously preposterous characters.  That's cool.  However, you should not be expected to suspend logical behavior and reason.  The military conduct in this film would certainly result in, at the very least a court marshal and at worst, public execution.  I thought the days of open warfare on college campuses were over since Kent State (Never mind the heart of downtown anywhere).  There are also other annoying plot holes and miss-steps that knock this film down a little.  On a personal taste level, I felt the final battle could have been more exciting if some extreme haymakers were included.  You know; punching your rival half way across town?  It was more of a cat fight with scratching and pushing that suffered a little from O.A.D. (Obscured Action Disease).-IF ONLY IT WERE INCREDIBLEHere's where source material actually becomes important.  If you never watched the Hulk TV show, read the original comic books or even saw the first Hulk film then you will NOT get the most out of what this film has to offer.  The main reason the first film matters at all is to understand how he got to where he is at the start of this film.  This might be the only thing from the first film that was kept.  Despite the flaws I pointed out, I enjoyed this film much more than the first one because it maintained the spirit of what the Hulk is; ""HULK SMASH!!!!.  In the theater where I saw this, there were about four little clusters of ""Hulk Savvy"" viewers who chuckled, clapped and snickered at all the little inside jokes.  These may have been the highlights of the film for me.  For those not familiar with the Hulk history; you will not get the jokes and the film will lose a fair chunk of its value.  Unlike ""Iron Man"" this film does not stand alone quite so well.-THE VERDICTCompared to ""Iron Man"" and ""Spiderman"" this is a much darker film and not nearly as high on the fun factor.  I would not bring younger children to see this.  The violence is very scary, the language a little rough and there is one bedroom scene that starts out a little hot and then calms down for safety reasons.  Though not without flaw, this is certainly better than ""The Hulk"" and especially entertaining for those familiar with the history of this comic book icon.  The first film, ""The Hulk"" gets 2.5 stars.  I give ""The Incredible Hulk"" 3.5 stars.

When the General decides to make his own Hulk-like experiment on Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), chaos breaks out.  Then, it's up to Banner to utilize his genetic accident and transform into the Hulk and stop Blonsky.I have to admit, my expectations were rather low given the Hulk's big screen history.  2003's ""Hulk"" featured the green beast romping aimlessly around the desert jumping miles at a time.  The plot seemed to have the same characteristics...it was an aimless romp with the Hulk smashing things around.  However, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is so much better than its predecessor on so many levels.For starters, there was actually a plot to this film.  Banner was trying to rekindle his love interest in Betty (Liv Tyler), seeking to find a cure for his condition and battle Blonsky.  The most important area of improvement was the CGI.  It looked amazing and the action scenes were truly captivating, especially the end fight scene.  Furthermore, no more long distance jumping.

Since that time, I have purchased the special 3 disc set and now its Blu-Ray version! Both look great on an HDTV and the Blu-Ray version is VERY clear!As for the film itself, let me tell you it will make you forget about the 2003 film Hulk! While the TV version with the late Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno will always be the Hulk to me, this is the way you should do the comic Hulk!These guys definitely took the best from both the TV show and the comics and blended them together into one great film. This film definitely gets a 5 star rating from me for non-stop action and a little bit of drama and storytelling. While I am sure everyone knows, it ties into the recent Iron-Man release. Perhaps a showdown between the two on the big screen soon? We'll see!Back to this, the transformations are great and they make more sense here than in Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003. While the Hulk did get stronger as he got angrier, I don't recall any version of him growing due to the rage! That made it a bit ridiculous to me. Here, he stays a consistent size and it just as menacing and scary at times. The villian Emil Blonsky (The Abomination) is much better than the villian in Hulk (though Nick Nolte did do a good job with what he had in 2003) and an actual threat to The Hulk.Overall, this won't be a waste of your money, no matter what version you get!

The first time we saw Edward Norton on the big screen he was playing a key role alongside Richard Gear in Primal Fear. Norton was so amazing in his performance that we have become fans of his.Here, Norton plays Bruce Banner, a scientist that travels fast from place to place, avoiding detection by those who want to turn what he carries inside into a powerful weapon. We find him working and surviving among the thousands that live in the Fabellas of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where from a bottling company, he is in communication with a US scientist, attempting to eliminate the effects of the military experiment that has transformed him into an enormous creature, capable of anything, with a powerful force that can send automobiles into the air as if they were Frisbees.Bruce is also learning the art of self control while receiving training on how to lower his heart rate through breathing and muscle exercises. When his heart rate is fast, he transforms, so we see him struggle to keep it low and to control emotions such as passion, rage, anger and love.William Hurt plays the part of General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, the man responsible for the project that has left Bruce in his present condition and who is after Bruce so he can make many just like him. The General also happens to be the father of the girl Bruce is in love with; Betty, played by Liv Tyler.The General is unable to capture Bruce in Brazil and Bruce escapes. We see him next in Guatemala, where a farmer finds him shivering in the cold of the jungle and takes him into town. There we see a rather funny scene as Bruce acquires clothing that can stretch as he transforms into the Hulk and because he can't determine the size... he tests it against the bottom of a rather large female that stands behind him.Next, he returns to the USA in search for a solution from the scientist he has been corresponding with, and when he finds him, he realizes that the doctor has kept samples and has test subjects that can progress the experiment. By now, the General has enlisted the help of an older soldier who seems to be capable of anything and wants nothing but to remain a fighter. This soldier confronted the Hulk back in Brazil and dreams of being able to fight against him, so he agrees to undergo experiments to see if he too can transform into a powerful ""abomination.""The scenes that follow are amazing, the fights a bit contrived, but the pace of this movie is wonderful as we go from place to place following the struggle between the two monsters. Hulk is simply a movie worth seeing and a wonderful resurfacing of one of our favorite superheroes.

I was, initially, pleased that Ed Norton and Liv Tyler were going to be the stars of this film, but I still wasn't quite ready to put all my eggs in one basket.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.The Incredible Hulk takes a new spin on the Hulk franchise where scientist Bruce Banner undergoes an experiment with gamma rays.  He becomes poisoned.  Thus, when his heart rate reaches 200 bpm, he transforms.  The government, wanting to replicate what happened to Banner's blood to make super-soldiers, hunts him down.  Banner goes into seclusion, for years, away from the love of his life (the Liv Tyler character) and his home.  What makes him return is hope.This time, the film is shot as if it were an actual film and not a comic strip.  The villain, a spin on Abomination, is developed just as thoughtfully as the Banner character.  The CGI, although not entirely convincing, is well put together.  There was one scene where the Hulk is walking through a stream and it doesn't look like his giant, clodhopper feet are disrupting the water at all and Tim Roth's transformation stunts are a bit under budgeted.  The action sequences aren't overbearing and are well placed in the film, combined with traditional Hulk moves.Certainly a more well thought out film that makes the disgrace of 2003 a distant memory.",5,The Hulk How it Should Be,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1425,"['ultimate', 'debacle', 'first', 'Hulk', 'film', 'back', '2003', 'was', 'naturally', 'skeptical', 'new', 'movie', 'was', 'initially', 'pleased', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'stars', 'film', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ready', 'put', 'eggs', 'one', 'basket', 'Thankfully', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.The', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'new', 'spin', 'Hulk', 'franchise', 'where', 'scientist', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'experiment', 'gamma', 'rays', 'poisoned', 'Thus', 'when', 'heart', 'rate', '200', 'bpm', 'government', 'wanting', 'replicate', 'what', 'happened', 'Banner', 'blood', 'make', 'super-soldiers', 'hunts', 'down', 'Banner', 'seclusion', 'years', 'away', 'love', 'life', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'character', 'home', 'What', 'return', 'hope.This', 'time', 'film', 'shot', 'were', 'actual', 'film', 'not', 'comic', 'strip', 'villain', 'spin', 'Abomination', 'developed', 'just', 'as', 'thoughtfully', 'Banner', 'character', 'CGI', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Hulk', 'walking', 'stream', ""n't"", 'look', 'giant', 'clodhopper', 'feet', 'are', 'disrupting', 'water', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'transformation', 'stunts', 'are', 'bit', 'budgeted', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'overbearing', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'film', 'combined', 'traditional', 'Hulk', 'moves.Certainly', 'more', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'film', 'disgrace', '2003', 'distant', 'memory']",N/A

Though the movie is more action orientated, that doesn't mean it leaves the characters and their story arcs behind, as Bruce Banner truly grows from his experiences throughout the movie, getting past his need to ""cure"" himself, and moving forward in accepting what he is. Casting of this movie was great, headed by the remarkable Edward Norton, playing Bruce Banner on the run perfectly, with equal parts tragedy & humanity, as he comes to terms with the power he holds within himself. As the dual foils for Bruce/Hulk to play off of is William Hurt as ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, on his Ahab like search for his green whale, also along for the ride is Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination, finally, as the calming force in Bruce's life is Liv Tyler as Betty Ross.

1180597,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001DHXT1G,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","THE INCREDIBLE HULKI remember not so long ago when a film by Ang Lee hit the theaters that was called simply ""Hulk"", and I liked unlike a lot of others apparently. I still to this day can not see why people did not like that film because I thought it was really good. The character driven emotional study of this man/creature was perfect. Lee did a great job with the film in my opinion and while it was not a classic was still very good. But the overwhelming out cry for another so called ""better' Hulk film was so much that they made this one. New cast, new crew, and even new Hulk were added to this one to please those who did not care for the first one. What they got was a film that was equally entertaining in my opinion I thought this was just as good as the last one and neither surpassed the other. They are two very different films and takes on the character and for that I view them separately and do not compare the two.This film is all about Banner [Edward Norton] trying to get in touch with some one who may be able to help get rid of his big green curse. It is in his search that the military can close in on him during their search. It is here that General Ross [William Hurt] and his number one soldier Emil Blonsky [Tim Roth] take their first failed shots at the Hulk. It is also here that Emil begins his obsession with battling him again. The story is basically your seek and destroy story from this point on with Ross's daughter trying her hardest to help Bruce as much as possible. So let the battles begin as they say with so many sides going against each other, and poor Hulk is caught in the middle, all Hulk want do is smash.Director Louis Leterrier really brought a whole other style to this film and quickens the pace up a bit as action is found throughout the film. To me both of the films are on the same level as I enjoyed both about the same, so I can't say that Louis did the better job. But if you want more action this one is for you as Zak Penn's script called for more action. Still the story is very fun and all the performances are great as well, Roth in particular. Tim Roth struck me as the perfect villain for this film and I really wish he would get more roles in theatrical films. Edward Norton was great as well as the new Bruce Banner and played the role perfectly. I still feel that the script could have beefed up Banner's character a little more so Norton could properly portray him, I felt the character [not performance] was a little underdeveloped. Still I really feel that Roth was the sow stealer here, he did a great job.Liv Tyler and William Hurt are great as the daughter and father Ross in this film, I remember never being a huge fan of Tyler back in the day but I have come to like her a now. I think it is because she looks just like some one I know [who I dislike], oh well. Also while every one in this film is great I must say seeing Lou Ferrigno in this was classic, as was Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr reprising his Tony Stark character [Avengers here we come, also in an opening scene Cap's shield is visible], and the LEGENDARY Rickson Gracie appearing as Banner's Aikido Instructor. I was super excited to see that as was my brother, loved it.Of course the special effects for the film are top notch as the two monsters that go at it on here look amazing, also the Hulk doesn't look cartoonish and Abomination looks great. As do all of the fights, explosions and such that come with this type of film. But I think the biggest story that came out of this was the comparisons between the two Hulk films. Like I said earlier I like both of them about the same, they are two very different films with very different styles. This three disc addition is packed full of all kinds of special features and is well worth the price of purchase, or at least I think so. I have to say I really enjoyed the commentary by the director and Tim Roth. I recommend watching both Hulk films as I enjoyed both myself. Also there are all kinds of features on this set so enjoy.",4,"HULK LIKE FILM, BUT HULK LOVE THREE DISC",1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,4024,"['INCREDIBLE', 'HULKI', 'remember', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'film', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'hit', 'theaters', 'was', 'called', 'simply', 'Hulk', 'liked', 'lot', 'others', 'apparently', 'still', 'day', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'character', 'driven', 'emotional', 'study', 'man/creature', 'was', 'perfect', 'Lee', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'classic', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'overwhelming', 'out', 'cry', 'so', 'called', 'better', 'Hulk', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'made', 'one', 'New', 'cast', 'new', 'crew', 'even', 'new', 'Hulk', 'were', 'added', 'one', 'please', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'first', 'one', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'opinion', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'last', 'one', 'surpassed', 'other', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'character', 'view', 'separately', 'do', 'not', 'compare', 'two.This', 'film', 'Banner', '[', 'Edward', 'Norton', ']', 'trying', 'get', 'touch', 'one', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'get', 'rid', 'big', 'green', 'curse', 'search', 'military', 'can', 'close', 'search', 'here', 'General', 'Ross', '[', 'William', 'Hurt', ']', 'number', 'one', 'soldier', 'Emil', 'Blonsky', '[', 'Tim', 'Roth', ']', 'take', 'first', 'failed', 'shots', 'Hulk', 'also', 'here', 'Emil', 'obsession', 'battling', 'again', 'story', 'basically', 'seek', 'destroy', 'story', 'point', 'Ross', 'daughter', 'trying', 'hardest', 'help', 'Bruce', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'So', 'let', 'battles', 'begin', 'say', 'so', 'many', 'sides', 'going', 'other', 'poor', 'Hulk', 'caught', 'middle', 'Hulk', 'want', 'do', 'smash.Director', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', 'really', 'brought', 'whole', 'other', 'style', 'film', 'pace', 'up', 'bit', 'action', 'found', 'film', 'films', 'are', 'same', 'level', 'enjoyed', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Louis', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'want', 'more', 'action', 'one', 'Zak', 'Penn', 'script', 'called', 'more', 'action', 'Still', 'story', 'very', 'fun', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'Roth', 'particular', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'struck', 'perfect', 'villain', 'film', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'get', 'more', 'roles', 'theatrical', 'films', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'played', 'role', 'perfectly', 'still', 'feel', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'beefed', 'up', 'Banner', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'so', 'Norton', 'could', 'properly', 'portray', 'felt', 'character', '[', 'not', 'performance', ']', 'was', 'little', 'underdeveloped', 'Still', 'really', 'feel', 'Roth', 'was', 'sow', 'stealer', 'here', 'did', 'great', 'job.Liv', 'Tyler', 'William', 'Hurt', 'are', 'great', 'daughter', 'father', 'Ross', 'film', 'remember', 'never', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Tyler', 'back', 'day', 'have', 'come', 'now', 'think', 'just', 'one', 'know', 'who', 'dislike', ']', 'oh', 'well', 'Also', 'one', 'film', 'great', 'must', 'say', 'seeing', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'was', 'classic', 'was', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'reprising', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'character', '[', 'Avengers', 'here', 'come', 'also', 'opening', 'scene', 'Cap', 'shield', 'visible', ']', 'LEGENDARY', 'Rickson', 'Gracie', 'appearing', 'Banner', 'Aikido', 'Instructor', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'see', 'as', 'was', 'brother', 'loved', 'it.Of', 'course', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'two', 'monsters', 'go', 'here', 'look', 'amazing', 'also', 'Hulk', ""n't"", 'look', 'cartoonish', 'Abomination', 'great', 'do', 'fights', 'explosions', 'such', 'come', 'type', 'film', 'think', 'biggest', 'story', 'came', 'was', 'comparisons', 'two', 'Hulk', 'films', 'said', 'earlier', 'same', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'very', 'different', 'styles', 'three', 'disc', 'addition', 'packed', 'full', 'kinds', 'special', 'features', 'well', 'price', 'purchase', 'least', 'think', 'so', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Hulk', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'Also', 'are', 'kinds', 'features', 'set', 'so', 'enjoy']",N/A

Edward Norton gently altered the intelligent script to artfully integrate The Hulk's narrative. Norton brings a level of pathos and depth to his role. I first became interested in watching this film after seeing Mark Ruffalo's distinctive version inMarvel's The Avengers. Ruffalo will be reprising his role in Joss Whedan's sequel in 2015, ""Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron.""This chapter in The Hulkdom oeuvre does not disappoint, as Ang Lee's version did. Watch for a great cameo by Lou Ferrigno (Hulk's voice too), another little bit of twisted Stan Lee humor with Banner working in Stanley's Pizza Parlor, and the corrupted Dr. Samuel Sterns (the great Tim Blake Nelson, memorable as Delmar, loved-up and turned into a horny toad inO Brother, Where Art Thou?). The one negative is that the film feels like it was wrapped-up abruptly. It begins vividly, with Norton's Dr. Banner/The Hulk hiding out in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, desperately searching for a cure while for his Hulk-condition while collaborating with the mysterious ""Mr. Blue,"" and loyally protected by his super-smart dog companion. The end is not as strong; it would have helped to have a final scene with Banner waking threadbare and footloose, trying to cope with closure with Betty (Liv Tyler), his angst, and survival.Sometimes, life can be so stressful that folks just need a little fun entertainment.

Edward Norton is the best Bruce Banner of all time, his performance allows people relate to Dr. Banner's...unique position. This film erases any memory of Ang Lee's Hulk, which wasn't exactly....the best film. The film is in a way a half reboot/ half sequel to that film as the origin story is provided in the opening credits. The film in my opinion is better than Iron Man and The Dark Knight (although I love both those films).Edward Norton remains strong throughout the film. The chase scenes are jam-packed adds a never-decaying level of excitement to the entire film, Hulk may seem like a villain fighting the military, but you sure want to cheer him on!

Eye-candy through and through.  You can see the smallest beads of sweat of the characters faces as well as enjoy the eye-popping special effects which look amazing.  I got this on sale from amazon for 9.49, which is unbeatable.  If you're a fan and love Bluray, go for it.The movie is an excellent action movie with a lot to recommend.  The clear discussion here is comparing this version to Ang Lee's.  Although this movie is a kind of reboot, it's a sequel to that film, only with a new cast and director.  As story goes, I prefer Ang Lee's ""Hulk"".  That film was as invested in the story, characters and drama as it was with its spectacular action and effects.  There was more poetry in it.  This version is more what people expected the first time around.  More straight forward action, although even those set pieces are nowhere near as imaginative as the duels Ang Lee put together.  Tim Roth is a great addition, adding another terrific villain to his repertoire as Emil Blonsky.  Norton, Tyler, and Roth are fabulous, but it's William Hurt that grated on me.  I wish Sam Elliot had reprised his role.  Hurt always seems to think he's in MacBeth and his line delivery is kind of ridiculous.  Elliot was more authentic, conflicted and sympathetic.  Hurt comes off as a common creep.Still, this version also makes the links between ther Justice League, with references to Stark Industries and a cameo by Robert Downey Jr. which are prepping us for the big movie event coming which includes all of Stan Lee's superheroes and the actors who have played them.Sit back and enjoy.

His fugitive status of hiding out in a soda bottle factory in Brazil was well done.Liv Tyler gave another stellar performance as Doctor Elizabeth Ross.  Her relationship with Leonard Samson quickly changed when Bruce Banner reentered her life serendipitously.  You have to feel for Leonard who sadly realizes that he has lost the girl of his dreams to her old love.William Hurt gives a fine performance as General Thaddeus Ross who helped create the Hulk with his daughter Elizabeth and Banner.  Of course his character is presented as the bad military who want to use everything as a weapon.  The General does show some compassion here and there.Perhaps, the best performance is by Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky, the tough as nails Special Forces commando, who is driven by the ultimate desire to be the super soldier. Unfortunately, with the help of the General and Dr. Samuel Sterns, played brilliantly by Tim Blake Nelson, Blonsky becomes the ultimate weapon.Lou Ferrigno, the original Hulk from the television series, has a cameo.  The late Bill Bixby, who played Bruce Banner from the television series, is briefly shown as well on a television set playing in the background.The special effects are excellent.  The tragic elements of romance between Elizabeth and Bruce are well done.The story by Zak Penn takes some liberties from the comic books and television show, but it is a compelling story.  In addition he wrote the story for the Avengers movie which is due out in the Summer of 2012.Unfortunately, Edward Norton will not reprise his role in The Avengers.  Mark Ruffalo will play the tormented scientist who is brought into the S.H.I.E.L.D. fold to help save the earth.In addition I chose not to compare this film to the previous 2003 film.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","Bruce Banner (lurking in South America and looking to purchase a pair of pants from a street vendor): ""Tienes mas stretchy?""2008's THE INCREDIBLE HULK eases up on the psychological angst which so bogged down Ang Lee's 2003 version (Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)). But let's not twist it, Bruce Banner suddenly isn't some happy-go-lucky bloke. He's still pretty damn tormented, he and his alter ego still the modern incarnations of Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Nomad scientist Bruce Banner will always be teeteering on the edge of losing control. Else, what's the point of his character? Just like he'll always be on a quest for a cure. And just like he'll always fail to find one.As a nod to Ang Lee's HULK and its conclusion, this one opens up with Bruce Banner still in Brazil, but now toiling as a day laborer in a soda-bottling plant. In his ongoing efforts to dampen his emotions, he's even resorted to taking martial arts lessons (not that Bruce becomes a wushu master or anything). He's got a watch which monitors his heart rate (any number nearing 200 beats is a worrisome thing).For a bit now, Bruce has been corresponding via e-mail with a Mr. Blue (can you guess what Bruce's code color is?). Mr. Blue has been assisting him with his latest attempt at a cure. But it's not too long of a wait before Bruce learns that the cure, isn't. In the short term, though, that's the least of his worries. General Ross has finally tracked him down and he mobilizes a strike force to fetch Banner.The film makes a point of keeping a running tally of Days Without Incident onscreen, the latest reading being 158 days. Ooops. Reset the count.I do think that Norton improves on Eric Bana, but I prefer Sam Elliott to William Hurt as the cold-hearted General Ross. And I think it's a wash between Jennifer Connelly and Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler is hotness on legs, and, as Betty Ross, she does well with the emotional, pining scenes. But I don't quite believe her as a biologist (she's a friggin' elf, isn't she?). But she and Norton produce some good chemistry, and you even buy into the tender Beauty & the Beast moments with her and the Hulk. Banner's core persona is marked by repression, by a tamping down of emotions. What's left is this husk desperate to stay even-keeled and unengaged and still. In a sexy and funny bedroom scene between Bruce and Betty, we learn that it's not only fear and rage which may trigger the change. Bruce, no matter what, just cannot afford to get too excited (Betty protests: ""Not even a little excited?""). Thankfully, Norton is able to bring out nuances and some liveliness to Banner, even if much of the acting has to be done internally. But there's only so much you can do with that. Bill Bixby, bless his soul, got the most out of all the actors to have ever played this role. Still, the Hulk usually has to pick up the slack, and he doesn't do this thru snappy dialogue and fancy emoting.The movie is still character driven, but much more accessible than the Ang Lee adaptation. THE INCREDIBLE HULK benefits most from driving up the pace. This film is more action oriented and showcases more of what makes the Hulk so much fun. Know your audience, says the box office guru. And the Hulk's audience clamors for the mean, green monster to break stuff and demolish a bad guy or two. Maybe occasionally yell out: ""Hulk is strongest one there is!"" or ""Hulk smash!""  No one takes to a rampage quite like the Hulk, and that's the candy we crave.General Ross is the recurring villain, but the main adversary for the Hulk here is Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a veteran paramilitary operative who envies the power unleashed by the Hulk. Of course, the old science-gone-mad schtick enters the picture, framed in General Ross's scheme to dust off the ancient super soldier project. Risky experimentations enable cellular changes within Emil Blonsky, who soon mutates to freakish, super strong stature. I don't think the film officially labels him this, but Emil Blonsky becomes the Abomination, one of the Hulk's perennial adversaries in the comics. His clash with the Hulk is of epic proportions, brutal and earth-shaking, and taking place in the crowded New York streets. There is much fan joy here.No disrespect to Bruce Banner, Betty and General Ross, but the film perks up most, obviously, whenever the Hulk manifests. While I did like how Ang Lee's Hulk was CG'd, this new version looks better, more ferocious and somehow more grounded to reality, more fixed into his surroundings. He's featured in three pulse-pounding action set pieces, the best of which is the aforementioned Hulk Vs. Abomination shatterfest (although the other two segments ain't nothing to sneeze at, either).Keep an eye out for the film's fond winks to Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee, and the late Bill Bixby, as well as a tongue-in-cheek take on Banner's famous line. Also, I'm digging the coda scene, as a character from another Marvel Comics title pops in for a cameo and with a very significant offer to General Ross. More fan joy, indeed.The other day, in one of those throwaway stream-of-consciousness conversations one sometimes gets into, someone was asking me whether Bruce Banner prefers briefs or boxers. I broke it down for her.",4,"""Don't make me hungry. You wouldn't like me when I'm...hungry.

This Hulk is fun, but like Lee's, the 3D animation is not what it should have been. More to the point, this Hulk is just more formulaic. Edward Norton is an excellent actor, but he just doesn't have the presence. And if you've seen Mark Ruffalo in Avengers, you've seen what can be brought to the role. Tim Roth is good, but under-used. The 3D effects for his beast are weaker, I think, than those for the Hulk. The last 20 minutes of the film with the showdown between the Hulk and Roth's beast are the weakest part of the film.

1180624,A2Y4S4CNGKF21S,B001DHXT1G,H. Swanson,"[2, 5]","I saw this movie on a whim on opening night, and it turned out to be so-so for me. It begins well past the point when Bruce has become afflicted by gamma rays, and he's already trying to learn how to control what's inside him. Of course, the government and all their bad guys come to hunt him down, bringing his heartrate up to 200 again and again. (We find out it's his heartrate that brings out the Hulk, so he's got to be on the lookout, depending on his faithful wristwatch whenever it comes to anger, running, or yes, sex.) Eventually he encounters Blonsky, a soldier who quickly becomes obsessed with the Hulk. Blonsky (Tim Roth) becomes dangerous when he offers for himself to become something that could combat Hulk, but his greed and lust for power get in the way, and he's soon out of control. Isn't that how it always is? The special effects in this movie are pretty much amazing, just about the most high-tech you can get nowadays, and the fight scenes will blow you away. I loved the character of Bruce, and Liv Tyler was lovely. Sure, it was entertaining, and I suppose that's all that matters, but if you want to get critical here, well...I enjoy Edward Norton. But he shouldn't have been cast in this. He's a wonderful Bruce Banner, but when he becomes the Hulk, I see absolutely no connection between the two; I cannot picture this skinny, nerdy guy (no offense, but hey) to be anywhere inside that thing. Now, I'm sure this is what the producers may have been going for: let's cast someone who's the complete opposite of what he turns into, so when he turns into it, wow, it'll be even more amazing because he'll look all the more bigger and stuff! Uh-huh, didn't work. The only other downfall is that this movie, unlike many other Marvel movies I've seen, is also catered VERY much only to guys. I'll explain this by saying that there were several references that I, as a girl, just didn't get. Not sure what it is, but you've got to up to date with your Marvel knowledge to catch all the goodies.Overall a pretty good movie!

Transporter director Louis Leterrier turns up the action, while maintaining a light touch without compromising the drama. But, like Iron Man released earlier that summer, it's utterly brainless entertainment with no lasting merit whatsoever.Bruce Banner (now more appropriately played by Edward Norton instead of Eric Banana) is living in South America, away from the authorities who want to turn his curse into a weapon. Over-confident Army soldier Emil Blonsky (a very small, old, and un-threatening Tim Roth) wants a shot at capturing the Hulk, but gets smashed in the process. He is quickly repaired with a magic potion and turns into The Abomination, a creature even more fake than the big, green CGI guy.Like other comic-book movies that preceded it, the ending is nothing but two CGI effects thumping each other until one of them doesn't get back up, while the surrounding environment is destroyed for our 'enjoyment'. I am honestly sick to death of this. The Punisher, with Thomas Jane, kept it real and gritty and it flopped. But CGI trash like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk and Fantastic Four make hundreds of millions. It doesn't make sense to me.Personally, I feel that comic-books are more suited to TV where the characters and plots can be developed over long periods of time instead of rushing through everything with generic, tired motivations in 110 minutes. While this movie is not bad, even the 1978 TV show was better. It sets up a lot for the long-in-development Avengers movie, which is so low on my priorities list it's completely subterranean, including the creation of 'The Leader'. But I doubt we will ever see the character in any sequel, mid-quel, prequel, or spin-off. There's just too much material, and not enough time to fully explore everything.The Incredible Hulk is an inoffensive time-waster.

Still suffering from the effects of the gamma rays that metabolized him into the Hulk every time his heart rate and blood pressure increases above the level. He tries to control it the best he can and is still looking for a botanical cure...any cure.At his work at the bottling company, he cuts himself on the electrical box switch and his infected blood drips and falls below. Knowing the health and safety laws, Bruce races down the conveyer belt and finds the blood spill. He cleans it up. Unbeknownst to him, part of his blood has already passed through onto an open bottle being processed. The bottle ends up in the United States in the refrigerator of a man (Stan Lee in a cameo appearance). He drinks of it and suddenly the bottle falls to the floor. We don't see what happened to him, but we are told he got quite a kick.General Ross (now played by William Hurt) is told of this incident and it puts him on the right track to Bruce. He knows for sure that Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk, but he is also after Bruce for the military secrets he knows.General Ross has a secret weapon of his own to conquer the Hulk in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who has been injected to morph as the Abomination beast.With the help of his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (now played by Liv Tyler), he will try to control his rampage.All this leads to a showdown between the Hulk and the Abomination beast in downtown Harlem.The very last minute of this film (before the end credits) contains a nice surprise cameo appearance ensuring the Hulk will return in another movie in the near future.Thanks to some lighting effects in the film, we also get to see the Hulk in his original comic book grey color.Bill Bixby, who played ""Dr. David Bruce Banner"" in the original live action tv series, ""The Incredible Hulk"" (1972-82,88,89,90) is seen in archive footage from the tv series,The Courtship of Eddie's Father: The Complete First Season (4

David Banner searches for a cure to his disease while the US military tries to create their own super soldier from his DNA.As a fan of Hulk comics, this was the movie I wanted to see ( as opposed to the Ang Lee version). I've watched it several times and still want to yell at the screen when the Hulk puts a beatdown on the Abomination. The Hulk looks great, the movie is short compared to most super hero movies and sticks to action as opposed to lengthy scenes of dialouge and melodrama. As much as I liked Iron Man and Dark Knight, Hulk is my personal favorite this summer.As for the Blu Ray - this is my new Blu Ray showcase. The dialouge can be difficult to hear and the action sequences are exceptionally loud. Overall though, the movie is about action sequences and the sound mix delivers. The picture quality is amazing. The opening scene in Brazil is simply incredible. The housing and rainforest pop off the screen. The action sequence on the college campus is another eyepopper. The Blu Ray format really excells in lush, bright environments, and it does not dissapoint.The Blu Ray is on one disc with all of the various features available during the movie. Again, this is a great way to show off some of Blu Ray's technical features, including the online BD Live features.This is an excellent movie and is worth the extra 10 bucks for those with a Blu Ray player.",5,Great Movie and awesome showcase for Blu Ray,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,1474,"['better', 'worse', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'sentance', 'David', 'Banner', 'searches', 'cure', 'disease', 'US', 'military', 'tries', 'create', 'own', 'super', 'soldier', 'DNA.As', 'fan', 'Hulk', 'comics', 'was', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'opposed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'version', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'still', 'want', 'yell', 'screen', 'when', 'Hulk', 'beatdown', 'Abomination', 'Hulk', 'great', 'movie', 'short', 'compared', 'most', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'sticks', 'action', 'opposed', 'lengthy', 'scenes', 'dialouge', 'melodrama', 'As', 'much', 'liked', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Hulk', 'personal', 'favorite', 'summer.As', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'new', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'showcase', 'dialouge', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'hear', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'loud', 'Overall', 'movie', 'action', 'sequences', 'sound', 'mix', 'delivers', 'picture', 'quality', 'amazing', 'opening', 'scene', 'Brazil', 'simply', 'incredible', 'housing', 'rainforest', 'pop', 'screen', 'action', 'sequence', 'college', 'campus', 'eyepopper', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'format', 'really', 'excells', 'lush', 'bright', 'environments', 'not', 'dissapoint.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'one', 'disc', 'various', 'features', 'available', 'movie', 'Again', 'great', 'way', 'show', 'off', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'technical', 'features', 'including', 'online', 'BD', 'Live', 'features.This', 'excellent', 'movie', 'extra', '10', 'bucks', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player']",N/A

We liked all of the movies but the Incredible Hulk was the only one we didn't get to see in the theater.This version was a much better action film than the last Hulk movie, which we thought played more like a Sci-Fi soap opera. There's plenty of action, although not quite as much as in the Bourne films and the latest 007 film. This movie benefits from a better cast. Edward Norton's portrayal of tortured soul Bruce Banner plays well against the ruthless team of General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Special Forces Officer Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).Again, parents shouldn't share this with young children. The movie is rated PG-13 because of the violence and language. I wish there was a good, animated Hulk movie to recommend but there isn't one available now. Also, please avoid the new Avengers animated DVDs. I made the mistake of picking these up without checking the ratings -- they feature the Hulk, but the stories and the language are not for young children either.If you're looking for better choices for your little superhero fan, check out my Amazon Listmania List, ""Batman / Dark Knight entertainment for little boys"" and have fun!",4,Liked Iron Man?

Figgered a remake so soon after the last Hulk movie would be as close to straight to video as one could get.  However, the idea of Ed Norton playing half the lead character intrigued me.  I consider him one of the best actors of this generation - always convincing without overpowering his roles.I am certainly glad I did watch this film. The pace was perfect - I loved rooting for the Hulk and despising the General.  My favorite part of the movie was its plug for the old show and especially seeing Lou Ferrigno treated with such respect.

This movie however stayed close to the roots of the Hulk, portraying the Hulk far better as an essentially immature being that acts on instinct and emotion, especially anger, with little rational thought, then focusing on the two main aspects of the Hulk story; Banner's search to cure himself of the Hulk, and the Hulk's attempt to survive and evade the military.  Actor-wise, Ed Norton was a good pick, and William Hurt is an even better Thunderbolt Ross than Sam Elliot, who I thought was pretty good.  I am however a big fan of Jennifer Connelly and missed her as Betty Ross, although, if she had to be replaced Liv Tyler is definitely a beautiful alternative.  I liked the set up for both the Avengers film and a potential 3rd film starring the Leader.

1180646,A10BWW5GU19AD,B001DHXT1G,Jeff Wiley,"[3, 4]","A few years ago, Universal Pictures came forward and announced a new 'Hulk' movie. Their 2003 effort had failed both with critics and with its audience. They termed their upcoming film ""a do-over"", doing what most people cannot do : acknowledge incompetence.Apology accepted, Universal Studios.The best piece of advice I could offer is to not pre-judge this Hulk film based on the last one. This one is so good, it completely renders its predecessor unwatchable. It makes what was already a bad movie laughably bad. The film starts smart by encapsulating the Hulk's origin into the time it takes to run the opening credits., rather than waste valuable movie time drudging it out. Once the movie begins, with Brazil as a backdrop, the ride really begins.Edward Norton is excellent as Dr. Bruce Banner. He's probably one of the 5 or 6 best actors alive, and he was a great fit for the part. Liv Tyler as Dr. Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross was decent. I don't view her as an actress with a lot of range, but she was fine for this part. The biggest casting challenge, to me, would have been filling the tall shoes of Sam Elliott (the best part of the last film, and most wasted talent) portraying General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. William Hurt did more than an ample job in the role. General Ross is not so much a villain as he is an well-meaning antagonist. The villain role is reserved for Tim Roth who, as Blonsky, makes you hate him from the get-go. His quest for power is the antithesis for Banner's quest to remove his unwanted abilities, and as the saying goes, the immovable object ultimately meets the irresistable force.There are numerous references to the Hulk TV series scattered throughout, and mostly in a humorous manner. They don't parody the series, but they pay homage in a tip-of-the-cap fashion. And, as has been the modus operandi for Marvel character films, Stan ""The Man"" Lee, creator or co-creator of nearly every Marvel character in history, makes a cameo appearance. Humor is used subtlety yet effectively throughout the movie, but make no mistake : this movie is NOT a comedy, nor is it unintentionally funny as the last movie was. This is a movie about a man who is thrust into a situation where he needs to move continuously in order to find his inner peace. Banner is a man who seeks a cure not only for his body, but his soul.The action scenes are great, fast, and furious. The CGI is maybe the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie, and that says a lot, as this film's title character may have had to rely on it more than any of his super peers. The story is interesting, and keeps you involved.Marvel has taken over production of their character's movie production. In 2008, they've stepped up to the plate twice, and have hit the ball deep over the centerfield wall twice. This is not a ""guy"" movie, nor is it a children's film. This is a summer blockbuster that can be enjoyed by all, although the violence may be a little too much for very young children.As much as I liked 'Iron Man', I sincerely believe 'The Incredible Hulk' to have surpassed it. There is no need to stay through the end credits, as was the case with 'Iron Man', for a hidden scene gem. I wouldn't go as far as to say that 'The Incredible Hulk 2' has been set up by the end of the film, but I will say this : 'The Avengers' movie is coming, kids. Until then, I highly recommend this movie for fellow comic-book nerds, and even the casual moviegoer.",5,"Makes the 2003 film look like ""an abomination"".",1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3448,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'came', 'forward', 'announced', 'new', ""'Hulk"", 'movie', '2003', 'effort', 'had', 'failed', 'critics', 'audience', 'termed', 'upcoming', 'film', 'do-over', 'doing', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'acknowledge', 'incompetence.Apology', 'accepted', 'Universal', 'Studios.The', 'best', 'piece', 'advice', 'could', 'offer', 'not', 'pre-judge', 'Hulk', 'film', 'based', 'last', 'one', 'one', 'so', 'good', 'completely', 'predecessor', 'unwatchable', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'bad', 'movie', 'laughably', 'bad', 'film', 'smart', 'encapsulating', 'Hulk', 'origin', 'time', 'run', 'opening', 'credits.', 'rather', 'waste', 'valuable', 'movie', 'time', 'drudging', 'out', 'movie', 'Brazil', 'backdrop', 'ride', 'really', 'begins.Edward', 'Norton', 'excellent', 'Dr.', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'probably', 'one', '5', '6', 'best', 'actors', 'alive', 'was', 'great', 'fit', 'part', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Dr.', 'Elizabeth', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'was', 'decent', 'do', ""n't"", 'view', 'actress', 'lot', 'range', 'was', 'fine', 'part', 'biggest', 'casting', 'challenge', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'filling', 'tall', 'shoes', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'best', 'part', 'last', 'film', 'most', 'wasted', 'talent', 'portraying', 'General', 'Thaddeus', 'Thunderbolt', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'did', 'more', 'ample', 'job', 'role', 'General', 'Ross', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'villain', 'well-meaning', 'antagonist', 'villain', 'role', 'reserved', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'Blonsky', 'hate', 'get-go', 'quest', 'power', 'antithesis', 'Banner', 'quest', 'remove', 'unwanted', 'abilities', 'saying', 'immovable', 'object', 'ultimately', 'irresistable', 'force.There', 'are', 'numerous', 'references', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'series', 'scattered', 'mostly', 'humorous', 'manner', 'do', ""n't"", 'parody', 'series', 'pay', 'homage', 'tip-of-the-cap', 'fashion', 'been', 'modus', 'operandi', 'Marvel', 'character', 'films', 'Stan', 'Man', 'Lee', 'creator', 'co-creator', 'nearly', 'Marvel', 'character', 'history', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Humor', 'used', 'subtlety', 'yet', 'effectively', 'movie', 'make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'unintentionally', 'last', 'movie', 'was', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'thrust', 'situation', 'where', 'move', 'continuously', 'order', 'find', 'inner', 'peace', 'Banner', 'man', 'who', 'cure', 'not', 'only', 'body', 'soul.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'fast', 'furious', 'CGI', 'maybe', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'superhero', 'movie', 'lot', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'rely', 'more', 'super', 'peers', 'story', 'interesting', 'involved.Marvel', 'taken', 'over', 'production', 'character', 'movie', 'production', '2008', ""'ve"", 'stepped', 'plate', 'twice', 'have', 'hit', 'ball', 'deep', 'centerfield', 'wall', 'twice', 'not', 'guy', 'movie', 'children', 'film', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'violence', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'young', 'children.As', 'much', 'liked', ""'Iron"", 'Man', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'have', 'surpassed', 'need', 'stay', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'case', ""'Iron"", 'Man', 'hidden', 'scene', 'gem', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', ""'The"", 'Incredible', 'Hulk', '2', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'coming', 'kids', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fellow', 'comic-book', 'nerds', 'even', 'casual', 'moviegoer']",N/A

His alter ego is played by the vulnerable Edward Norton, an excellent choice. The special effects are at times magnificent, convincingly in harmony with the real life cinematography. Liv Tyler plays a sensual, sympathetic girl friend and John Hurt delivers cold determination with the prophecy of redemption in his caring eyes. Some parts of this well filmed movie take place in beautiful Brazil. Overall, a good film.It is a film that unexpectedly turns its cultural attention, for a time, away from our shores, and to South America. I enjoyed the attempts at expanding its borders and giving a scale larger than its predecessors, and perhaps its comics. The boost is needed for a film that really, perhaps, shouldn't have been given another chance considering the hushed hype that this franchise has. Its fans, are no doubt, no less enthusiastic than say, Spider mans, but the numbers are surely lesser.But the Hulk, is a change in what we know to be superhero's. He is unstable, and unpredictable, and can you say that the green monster really is a good guy all the time? He is a beast, with mega strength, and an anger problem that is dangerous, and like a loaded gun, only needs to be pointed in a direction. If you happen to be standing in the way, you are in trouble. And for me, there isn't a classic nemesis to battle with the Hulk that has yet to catch our nations attention. We don't have, say, supermans Lex Luther. We have mutated poodles? That is lame.Hulk is presented in sometimes good CGI, but it never amazes as the title would lead you to think. It's editing is more impoved over Ang Lee's version, which did not stick to a winning formula. Here, the pull back a bit on the Comic page edits, and for a time tried to be more serious, like Christopher Nolans Batmans serious, but don't get me wrong, it never operates on the classic level of Nolan's Batman series.",4,"Enjoyable, with good characters and exotic locations.",1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1967,"['Hulk', 'more', 'visceral', 'other', 'Comic', 'character', 'made', 'silver', 'screen', 'alter', 'ego', 'played', 'vulnerable', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'excellent', 'choice', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'times', 'magnificent', 'convincingly', 'harmony', 'real', 'life', 'cinematography', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'sensual', 'sympathetic', 'girl', 'friend', 'John', 'Hurt', 'delivers', 'cold', 'determination', 'prophecy', 'redemption', 'caring', 'eyes', 'parts', 'well', 'filmed', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'beautiful', 'Brazil', 'Overall', 'good', 'film.It', 'film', 'unexpectedly', 'cultural', 'attention', 'time', 'away', 'shores', 'South', 'America', 'enjoyed', 'attempts', 'expanding', 'borders', 'giving', 'scale', 'larger', 'predecessors', 'perhaps', 'comics', 'boost', 'needed', 'film', 'really', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'considering', 'hushed', 'hype', 'franchise', 'fans', 'are', 'doubt', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'say', 'Spider', 'mans', 'numbers', 'are', 'surely', 'Hulk', 'change', 'what', 'know', 'be', 'superhero', 'unstable', 'unpredictable', 'can', 'say', 'green', 'monster', 'really', 'good', 'guy', 'time', 'beast', 'mega', 'strength', 'anger', 'problem', 'dangerous', 'loaded', 'gun', 'only', 'be', 'pointed', 'direction', 'happen', 'be', 'standing', 'way', 'are', 'trouble', ""n't"", 'classic', 'nemesis', 'battle', 'Hulk', 'yet', 'catch', 'nations', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'supermans', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'have', 'mutated', 'poodles', 'lame.Hulk', 'presented', 'sometimes', 'good', 'CGI', 'never', 'title', 'would', 'lead', 'think', 'editing', 'more', 'impoved', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'stick', 'winning', 'formula', 'Here', 'pull', 'back', 'bit', 'Comic', 'page', 'edits', 'time', 'tried', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'Christopher', 'Nolans', 'Batmans', 'serious', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'never', 'classic', 'level', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'series']",N/A
1180648,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B001DHXT1G,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","In an effort to redo the start of a potentially good franchise, Marvel Studios offers up a great story about the one character who doesn't want the power he has.The Incredible Hulk starts the origins over with a bit of everything thrown into the mix.  This movie is part comic book origin, part TV series origin and assumes most of the events that took place in the first movie still happened.  Bruce Banner is the brilliant scientist who experimented on himself due to the confidence in his work and converted himself into the raging green giant that becomes The Hulk.  His work was preliminary weapons research but he was not aware of it.  He was lured into thinking it was research for making soldiers more resistant to toxins and radiation, but really it was for creating a new breed of soldier.Ang Lee's Hulk that was released back in 2003 took a very deterred look at the Hulk and added elements of repressed anger and paternal gene splicing.  In other words, the father messed with his own DNA and passed it on to his son, who then witnessed his mother's death at the hands of his father.  Way too much existentialism added to what should have just been a man who had been given a power that came at a price.  There is enough drama and character development in the basics of Bruce Banner/Hulk that you don't need to pull in sins of the father elements to make it more complicated.This movie throws most of that into the trash and works with the premise that Banner (Edward Norton), now on the run, is hiding out and working to cure himself from a small town in Brazil.  He is a fugitive, which draws on the serial plot of the original TV series.  Bill Bixby's cameo is brilliant, BTW.  Once he finds out that he must travel back to the US for a potential cure, the chase is on.  Before he can pack up and start heading north, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and his squad of special forces led by Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).  They fail to capture him, but are successful at meeting The Hulk.Blonsky finds himself curious as to the origins of the Green monster.  When The General reveals to him that it was the result of experiments gone wrong (or right) he wants a piece of that power, which the General obliges.  As Bruce makes his way to New York, he reveals himself to Betsy Ross, the Generals daughter, whom he was in love with before the accident.  They find their way to Dr. Samual Sterns in New York for the ultimate cure and eventually the high end climax occurs.The best thing Marvel did here was to just make a good movie.  Too many times in Hollywood they make every movie the be-all-end-all...so how do your follow that up.  Just make a good story.  And this move does that.  It's entertaining, it's got great action and a good script.  Thank God Marvel has it's own studio to do their movies they way they should be done.  All the actors perform well; Roth is a great villian (again), while Hurt shows a deep level of deceptive character that I've never seen before.  Norton is well balanced as the brilliant scientist who wants no self pity and shows great determination to get rid of this rage driven curse.  He and Tyler have good chemistry as well.  And of course Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno make cameos along with Bill Bixby.",4,Good Green Movie,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",2008,3275,"['effort', 'redo', 'start', 'potentially', 'good', 'franchise', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'up', 'great', 'story', 'one', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'power', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'origins', 'bit', 'everything', 'thrown', 'mix', 'movie', 'part', 'comic', 'book', 'origin', 'part', 'TV', 'series', 'origin', 'most', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'happened', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'who', 'experimented', 'due', 'confidence', 'work', 'converted', 'raging', 'green', 'giant', 'Hulk', 'work', 'was', 'preliminary', 'weapons', 'research', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'was', 'lured', 'thinking', 'was', 'research', 'making', 'soldiers', 'more', 'resistant', 'toxins', 'radiation', 'really', 'was', 'creating', 'new', 'breed', 'soldier.Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', 'was', 'released', 'back', '2003', 'took', 'very', 'deterred', 'look', 'Hulk', 'added', 'elements', 'repressed', 'anger', 'paternal', 'gene', 'splicing', 'other', 'words', 'father', 'messed', 'own', 'DNA', 'passed', 'son', 'who', 'then', 'witnessed', 'mother', 'death', 'hands', 'father', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'existentialism', 'added', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'power', 'came', 'price', 'enough', 'drama', 'character', 'development', 'basics', 'Bruce', 'Banner/Hulk', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'pull', 'sins', 'father', 'make', 'more', 'complicated.This', 'movie', 'most', 'trash', 'premise', 'Banner', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'now', 'run', 'hiding', 'out', 'working', 'cure', 'small', 'town', 'Brazil', 'fugitive', 'serial', 'plot', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'cameo', 'brilliant', 'BTW', 'Once', 'out', 'must', 'travel', 'back', 'US', 'potential', 'cure', 'chase', 'can', 'pack', 'up', 'start', 'heading', 'north', 'tracked', 'down', 'General', 'Thunderbolt', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'squad', 'special', 'forces', 'led', 'Emil', 'Blonsky', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'fail', 'capture', 'are', 'successful', 'meeting', 'Hulk.Blonsky', 'curious', 'origins', 'Green', 'monster', 'When', 'General', 'reveals', 'was', 'result', 'experiments', 'gone', 'wrong', 'right', 'piece', 'power', 'General', 'Bruce', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'Betsy', 'Ross', 'Generals', 'daughter', 'whom', 'was', 'love', 'accident', 'find', 'way', 'Dr.', 'Samual', 'Sterns', 'New', 'York', 'ultimate', 'cure', 'eventually', 'high', 'end', 'climax', 'occurs.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Marvel', 'did', 'here', 'was', 'just', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'movie', 'be-all-end-all', 'so', 'how', 'do', 'follow', 'up', 'Just', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'move', 'entertaining', 'got', 'great', 'action', 'good', 'script', 'Thank', 'God', 'Marvel', 'own', 'studio', 'do', 'movies', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'actors', 'perform', 'well', 'Roth', 'great', 'villian', 'again', 'Hurt', 'deep', 'level', 'deceptive', 'character', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Norton', 'well', 'balanced', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'who', 'self', 'pity', 'great', 'determination', 'get', 'rid', 'rage', 'driven', 'curse', 'Tyler', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'make', 'cameos', 'Bill', 'Bixby']",N/A

Being an avid admirer of the Bixby/Ferrigno series in the late seventies and early eighties I found this film to be closer in spirit to the series and I definitely liked that.The Hulk's origins are played out at the very beginning and once that's over and done with audiences are in for a fast paced and enjoyable ride. The film attempts to keep people who liked the series happy as well as the crowd who want it firmly rooted in Marvel tradition. The Hulk battles a foe called The Abomination in the final third, and by the way that fight is pretty amazing, and I gather that that's a person to be found in the original comics.While Eric Bana was one of the few things that was positive about Hulk (2003), Norton betters him here. He's such a natural performer and he can convey so much with mere expressions. He was the perfect choice to play Banner, in some ways he reminded me of Bixby. Tim Roth is one of those actors who's always good and he doesn't falter here. But William Hurt really surprised me. I've always thought he was good but I'd have to say this is his finest performance in many years. General Ross is a much better written character here than in the 2003 version and Hurt simply excels in the part.As for the CGI, they work really well. The Hulk looks extremely cool and far better here. He doesn't continue to grow as he gets angrier and while that may annoy some I actually found it a plus. And those huge leaps are history as well, he jumps far enough but nothing compared to Ang Lee's version.The Incredible Hulk does well what it intends to do which is entertain.

1180655,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B001DHXT1G,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 1]","This new version of the Hulk has less talk and more action. It also scraps the idea from the 2003 film that Banner got powers due to his father experimenting on him. The opening credits ""which is a lot like the ones to the 70's tv series"" explains how he became the Hulk.Norton's Banner goes into hiding right after getting his powers. In Brazil he tries to learn how to control his anger better. It's going ok until the military finds out where he is.The Incredible Hulk is also a success for Marvel after Ironman. However it has less of a story than the 2003 film. It also feels like the same movie in some areas. You have Betty's father (this time played by William Hurt, not Sam Elliiot) after Bruce yet again. When we already know that weapons of the military are useless against the Hulk. We learned that bullets bounce off of him in the 2003 film already.However they do learn that if they want to be a match for him they need someone as strong as him. Tim Roth's character is more than eager to be experimented on after seeing how unstoppable Banner is.The movie has so much energy that I was yawning by the middle of the film. However it is well made and the action is very well done. It is the fun comic ""Hulk Smash"" film that people hoped the 2003 film to be. I do prefer some of the casting of the 2003 over the casting here though. I think Sam Elliot did better work in the same part than William Hurt does. Hurt hams it up and overacts a little too much, which is why I took Elliot more serious in the role since he didn't ham it up or overact. While I liked Jennifer Connely a little more as Betty than Liv Tyler. Although Tyler does some of her better work here I admit.I didn't have a problem with the idea of Eric Bana coming back again either. With more to do he could have been a good Hulk. However Norton does shine here and gets to have more fun with the part with a lot less of an overly serious script.",4,"The ""Hulk Smash!""

Unlike the 2004 &#34;Hulk&#34; with Eric Bana, Marvel Studios worked on this movie. That is why it has that feel of the other Marvel Studios movies. This movie makes the Banner/Hulk character seem more human. It shows  the effects of the change taking it's toll on Banner. I'm not a huge Edward Norton fan, but he plays the role very well. Liv Tyler has that calming presence as Betty (and seems similar to her role in Lord of The Rings).Unlike &#34;Hulk&#34;, where the character was fighting for survival, this movie has villains. The Hulk first takes on General Ross (played by William Hurt - who is more believable as Betty's dad), before taking on The Abomination (played by Tim Roth). While some things seem a bit unbelievable (like Roth's Matrix-like moves in a fight scene), it falls in line with the rest of the Marvel storyline.For those who were fans of the tv show, this has more similarities than the 2003 movie.Norton was scheduled to return as the Hulk in The Avengers before differences between himself and Marvel led to Mark Ruffalo taking over the character.

1180659,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B001DHXT1G,J. O. Booker,"[3, 9]","I don't get it. I thought that this version of the Hulk was supposed to be all that. Everybody griped about how bad Ang Lee's Hulk was and how this version was so much better. After all, with this Hulk you had one of the Hulk's old nemesis in the Abomination, which promised way more action. Also, with this hulk, you had not one but two credible actors in Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs) and Edward Norton (Fight Club) albeit with an unknown director in Louis Letterier. All the critics raved that this Hulk had not only vindicated Ang Lee's so-called debacle, but that this Hulk almost rivaled the much vaunted Iron Man. So, I guess, I had to check the Hulk out for myself and see if all the salivation and sloppy oral service was worth it.It wasn't. First, the story was a cliche bastard, meaning that Marvel goofed. Anyone who's read the comic knows the true origin of how Dr. Robert Bruce Banner (not David damnit)became the Hulk. I won't go into a long explanation of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk, but it sure wasn't the way the writers of this movie portrayed Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk. I won't ejaculate on how counterfeit this movie was; instead, I'll stick to the merits of this movie--there were hardly any. I thought this Hulk would have more action. More action?!There were only two or three Hulk sequences in the entire film, and those sequences were abbreviated and inebriated. The special effects of this Hulk were less sophisticated than the special effects in the first (Ang Lee's) Hulk. Hulk looked like a big, green, veiny wad of rubber. Actually, he looked like an alien erection. If you've yet to see this Hulk, imagine this: choke down four sloppy double-cheese white castles, a jar of jalepenos, a bean burrito with guacamole sauce, an oxtail, a bowl of hot chili, and a couple of warm beers. A few hours later, take a crap, then turn around and look at what you did--that's the Hulk. Tim Roth and Ed Norton are great actors, but this movie proves that--no matter who's the star and no matter how awesome the intentions-- you need good writing. Take a look at the Batman franchise prior to Christopher Nolan. Batman was the Ocean's Eleven of superhero movies--a vehicle for big stars to get a lot of underserved publicity and to get an easy paycheck. Batman had gotten so putrid that George Clooney GEORGE CLOONEY played Batman. People have midget memories. Think back! Batman was camp fodder before Nolan took over and made it respectable again, or probably for the first time ever. Ang Lee tried to make the Hulk respectable and, to this reviewer, he did make this movie respectable, much more so than this dumb version of the Hulk which couldn't seem to make up its mind on what movie it wanted to sample. First, it wanted to be King Kong by taking the woman up to a cave overlooking the city, then he breaks out hollering and screaming like a damn idiot. Then, at the end of the movie, the Hulk goes away bouncing off of buildings a la Spiderman. This franchise needs an injection of heart and commitment, not more Gumby-like special effects.

While he searches for a cure to his condition, General Ross (William Hurt) has discovered where he is and tracks him down so he and his soldiers can take them alive to conduct experiments. As Banner returns back to the states, he is reunited with the love of his life Betty (Liv Tyler) and accidently releases his rage to become the Hulk on some soldiers with Betty as the only thing that can calm the creature down. KBG agent Emil Bronsky (Tim Roth) conducts an experiment on himself with the same gamma that made Banner the Hulk when he's angry as it later transforms him into a hideous monster called The Abomination who's powers matches the Hulk's as the green goliath is the only one that can stop it.Exciting and action-packed reboot of the 2003 Ang Lee film which wasn't too bad but left a bad taste to most people's mouths. Director Louis Leterrier and star Edward Norton has made a stand-alone movie that remains more true to the roots of both the comic books and the classic 70's TV show with Bill Bixby. The special effects are a vast improvement over the last one with the Hulk being more convincing and less cartoonish this time, the action is non-stop and the performances are just terrific including Norton as the tortured soul Bruce Banner. There's special appearences by Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee and Robert Downy Jr as Tony Stark which leads up to a big Marvel event movie coming in 2011.This Blu-Ray offers the best quality picture and sound that is mindblowing like the film itself! the extras are outstanding like the U-Control mode where you can watch extras during the movie or after the movie. There's a BD-Chat where you can hook the internet to your Blu-Ray player to make your own commentary with other people on-line plus some great extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, alternate opening, Comic Book gallery, character files, picture in picture access where you can see interviews and behind the scenes footage during the movie, animated comic, four featurettes and digital copy with the Blu-Ray box-cover in limited edition 3-D.Nice to see Marvel getting back on track on film with this and ""Iron Man"" being examples.",5,Smashing movie!,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,2419,"['Bruce', 'Banner', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'run', 'authorities', 'conducting', 'experiment', 'made', 'green', 'powerful', 'brute', 'called', 'Hulk', 'Voiced', 'Lou', 'Ferringo', 'Brazil', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'inner-peace', 'cure', 'condition', 'General', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'discovered', 'where', 'down', 'so', 'soldiers', 'can', 'take', 'alive', 'conduct', 'experiments', 'Banner', 'back', 'states', 'reunited', 'love', 'life', 'Betty', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'accidently', 'rage', 'become', 'Hulk', 'soldiers', 'Betty', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'calm', 'creature', 'down', 'KBG', 'agent', 'Emil', 'Bronsky', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'experiment', 'same', 'gamma', 'made', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'when', 'angry', 'later', 'hideous', 'monster', 'called', 'Abomination', 'who', 'powers', 'Hulk', 'green', 'goliath', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'stop', 'it.Exciting', 'action-packed', 'reboot', '2003', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'most', 'people', 'mouths', 'Director', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', 'star', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'made', 'stand-alone', 'movie', 'more', 'true', 'roots', 'comic', 'books', 'classic', '70', 'TV', 'show', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'vast', 'improvement', 'last', 'one', 'Hulk', 'being', 'more', 'convincing', 'less', 'cartoonish', 'time', 'action', 'non-stop', 'performances', 'are', 'just', 'terrific', 'including', 'Norton', 'tortured', 'soul', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'special', 'appearences', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Robert', 'Downy', 'Jr', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'up', 'big', 'Marvel', 'event', 'movie', 'coming', '2011.This', 'Blu-Ray', 'offers', 'best', 'quality', 'picture', 'sound', 'mindblowing', 'film', 'extras', 'are', 'outstanding', 'U-Control', 'mode', 'where', 'can', 'watch', 'extras', 'movie', 'movie', 'BD-Chat', 'where', 'can', 'hook', 'internet', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'make', 'own', 'commentary', 'other', 'people', 'on-line', 'great', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'opening', 'Comic', 'Book', 'gallery', 'character', 'files', 'picture', 'picture', 'access', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'interviews', 'scenes', 'footage', 'movie', 'animated', 'comic', 'four', 'featurettes', 'digital', 'copy', 'Blu-Ray', 'box-cover', 'limited', 'edition', '3-D.Nice', 'see', 'Marvel', 'getting', 'back', 'track', 'film', 'Iron', 'Man', 'being', 'examples']",N/A
1180663,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B001DHXT1G,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Let me state unequivocally at the outset that in comparing Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" and Louis Leterrier's ""Incredible Hulk"" movies, I believe Ang Lee's version is superior. My reason for this can be summed up by a paraphrase of a quote from Roger Ebert's review of ""1984"": ""(Leterrier's) version of (Marvel's tormented green character) turned (the Hulk's plight) into a cautionary, simplistic (superhero) tale. (Ang Lee's ""Hulk"") penetrates much more deeply into (the character's psychological) heart of darkness."" If you are interested in a more detailed explanation of my reasoning, I refer you to my ""Ph.D. thesis"" review of Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" on IMDb.However, all that psychological complexity elicited a lot of discomfort and hostility from ""Hulk"" viewers. They didn't want to see a tragic, emotionally reserved character struggling with mental and father dilemmas and abuse as well as his gamma-irradiated condition. God damn it, they wanted an unambiguous superhero rising up to beat the bad guys to a pulp and save humanity, the world, or something. They wanted the most unconventional, unlikely ""superhero"" of all to follow the old movie superhero formula: 1) Origin of good guy superhero, 2) Origin of good guy superhero's nemesis, 3) Circumstances that bring the superhero and nemesis together to fight. Apparently, the corporate suits listened to this plea and gave the world ""The Incredible Hulk"".Consequently, Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" takes the character nuances and motivations Lee's ""Hulk"" worked so hard to cultivate and makes them slicker, simpler and more basic. The Hulk/Bruce Banner no longer is the reluctant or accidental hero who only wants to live a peaceful life and inherits his powers by accident. This time Banner (Edward Norton) is a rash, ambitious graduate student who deliberately subjects himself to gamma radiation almost as a lark, to see what superpowers he'll get and soon rues his choice. The Hulk's/Bruce's anger no longer arises from trauma suffered from years of parental abuse. This time, being chased around by the military because he is ""U.S. government property"" as General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) puts it, and has a power Ross and many others want to scientifically duplicate, makes Banner lose it and ""Hulk out"". General Ross himself is no longer an ambivalent character, a dutiful soldier bent on crushing the menacing Hulk but also obsessively protective of his only child, Betty Ross. Instead, he is a purely unscrupulous, selfish villain. However, the Hulk himself does manage to keep most of his pathos and sympathy in spite of Leterrier's efforts to steer him into superhero status.Leterrier glosses over the Hulk's creation in a frantic montage, instead of Lee's deliberate, contemplative origin story. Conversely, however, he takes more time following the creation of the Hulk's ultimate nemesis, another gamma creature known as the Abomination (not named in the film). The Abomination is actually Emil Blonsky, a Slavic (?) mercenary Ross retains to help his troops capture the Hulk. Blonsky, a veteran soldier past his prime, is apparently an adrenaline and power junkie. Impressed by his first encounter with the Hulk in South America, and gradually learning from the reticent Ross about his origin, Blonsky is insanely eager to become a match for the Hulk.Meanwhile, chased from his hideout in the Rio favela slums by Ross's troops but escaping to Culver University in Virginia (I think) partly by transforming into the Hulk, Banner reunites with Betty Ross and conspires with her to go to New York and meet with Dr. Samuel Sterns, to whom he has shipped blood samples in hopes of finding a cure. Unfortunately, Banner learns to his shock that the animated Dr. Sterns too has jumped on the ""Super Soldier"" bandwagon and has cloned his blood proteins to discover their amazing properties. Before Dr. Stearns can proceed with his research, Ross, Blonsky, and the military arrive. Having received an initial dose of the ""Super Soldier formula"" from Ross and already lost to the Hulk in an initial confrontation, Blonsky comes back for Round 2. Blonsky forces Dr. Stearns to give him a booster shot of Banner's proteins, which completely transform him into the Abomination. He goes on a rampage.To save New York, Banner skydives from a military helicopter without a parachute to compel himself to transform into the Hulk. He does so just in time before hitting the pavement. He collides with the Abomination in the night-time New York streets and the two behemoths have a battle royal which culminates on a building roof. After about a half-hour of punishing blows, the Hulk eventually triumphs and jumps away. Humanity is saved (and the Hulk has caused minimal collateral damage).Despite the ""dumbing-down"" of this iconic ""monster"", I still enjoyed ""The Incredible Hulk"" as a well-paced, exciting action flick that makes some improvements on Ang Lee's version. Much as I like Eric Bana in Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", he's really too tall and muscular to play Bruce Banner. Edward Norton's slighter build is more suitable to the role. Norton's Banner also projects more vulnerability and desperation. Liv Tyler's performance as Betty Ross reinforces Banner's humanity even as the Hulk even more than Jennifer Connelly's version in ""Hulk"". Tim Roth's manic, driven Blonsky/Abomination promises to give the Hulk more headaches in sequels. And we get to see the Hulk act truly heroic, with hints that he will do so again in the future, if Banner has anything to say about it.",3,We'll make a conventional superhero out of the Hulk

1180664,A3F9VH8916IA40,B001DHXT1G,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[3, 3]","Man, Marvel should do this more often. First they come out with the instant classic that was Iron Man, a film that will go down in history as one of the greatest super hero movies of all time, and now they forever wipe the Hulks hands clean of the blood stains still left over from that horrible first film,Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition). Gone are the split screens and insanely lousy action scenes, replaced by the tried and true super hero formula which made Iron Man and other hero films, such as the first two Spider Man films, so great and memorable. No, this is NOT a terribly unique film; for those who've seen Iron Man its eerily similar in both pacing and battle sequences, its really Iron Man with The Hulk standing in but that's okay, because with a movie like this I just wanted to have some super hero ""Hulk smash"" fun, and that's exactly what I got. I'll go see The Happening when I want twisted plot twists and suspense, but to get my action fix I go to The Hulk.Bruce Banner (AKA The Hulk) is on the run in Brazil. The military is after his blood, literally, planning to test it and create an army of super human soldiers to use as weapons of war. But Bruce is too cunning for them, that is until a drop of his blood falls into an empty bottle of soda at the bottling plant he works in. Tracing it back to Banners place of work (after some old guy drank the soda and dies of poisoning) the military desperately attempts to find Banner and subdue him, only to run into, ta da, THE HULK!I must admit that the first hour or so of The Incredible Hulk is more then a little bit boring. You only see The Hulk once and he's hidden away in the shadows and it's too dark to see with any clarity. But bare with it, although the first hour or so is VERY slow the action picks up very well from there on. Please people, but the original Hulk film out of mind; bury it in your backyard and forget it ever existed.Once Bruce gets back to the states and meets up with his old girlfriend things pick up from a slow dreary walk to a brisk pace, then zooms ahead into a full out sprint. The first real battle Hulk fights is with the military (who are for some reason still wearing their old uniforms, come on, the new digi camo uniforms are MUCH cooler) on the campus of some Virginia university. Although, yes, your going to have to suspend your belief more then a little here (come on, open military campaigns in the middle of a school? Humvee's and gun ships?) it is, never the less, very entertaining to watch. Don't get your brain too fried trying to figure out all the things that don't make sense, that's not the point at all, the point is just to have a good time. Plus there is plenty of hummer. One scene has Bruce and Betty are getting quite passionate with one another, only to have Bruce's heart monitor start going crazy.""No, I can't get exited"" Bruce says, a bit disappointed.""Not even a little bit?"" Betty replied. Man that was funny.There are a few things that didn't sit well with me though. Like I said, the whole military invading some university was a bit much, and the quirky ""Dr. Blue"" was more annoying then anything else. I've loved Liv Tyler since The Lord of the Rings films, but this is far from her best work, she talks in a whisper almost the entire time. Plus the ending battle was too much like Iron Man's; Iron Man fought a bigger, badder Iron Man in his film, so why does the Hulk only get to fight a bigger badder Hulk? Doesn't he have any villains of his own to deal with? I mean Spider Man didn't jump out and fight a bigger badder Spider Man, nor did Batman or the Fantastic Four (although that was an awful movie). I'm not a big Hulk know it all, I've never read the comics and have only seen a few episodes of the TV show, but surly he has better villains then ""bigger badder Hulk guy.""Oh, and an added treat for those who saw Iron Man as well, Tony Stark makes an appearance at the end of the film, and tells the general that he's ""putting together a team' and is interested in Bruce. Could this be the beginning of a super hero team for the future? Just wait until Captain America and Thor get their shots at glory (I hear its going to happen by 2010) and we may see marvels version of The Justice League. We can only wait and see.Okay, I've ranted enough here. Time to bring this review to a close.PROS.-Good action scenes.-Likable characters.-Good effects.-Good acting for the most part and a well written script.CONS.-Liv Tyler whispering all her lines. That got annoying.-A slow beginning.-Too much unbelievably, although I found it easy to overlook this.-Too much in common with Iron Man.Replay value; high.Word of the day; Hulkified; when you see Bruce Banner, or anyone for that matter, transform from a normal human being to the/a Hulk, he's being Hulkified. Yes I made it up, but its an awesome word.",4,"Not quite incredible, but close enough for me",1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,4859,"['Man', 'Marvel', 'should', 'do', 'more', 'often', 'First', 'come',

1180668,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B001DHXT1G,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[20, 26]","A few observations about the mostly successful, mostly entertaining 2008 film ""The Incredible Hulk""...The movie is billed as a reboot or totally new version of the Hulk, not a sequel to the 2003 Ang Lee film that was simply titled, ""Hulk"".  I'd call the movie more of a semi-reboot.  Why?  Well, the earlier movie ends with Bruce Banner in hiding in South America, with General Ross and his cronies madly searching for him.  And the new film, well... opens with Bruce Banner in hiding in South America, with General Ross and his cronies madly searching for him.  I think Marvel smartly structured the film to appease both camps: if you liked the earlier movie you can- contrary to all the ""forget the earlier movie!"" hype- view this one as the next chapter in the story.  And if you didn't like the earlier film, you can point to the recasting of the actors and the less introspective,  more ""big summer movie"" tone and say, ""Whew, it's NOT the same storyline!""  Your money, your choice.The new film offers a more kinetic, visceral, action-oriented story, peppered with just enough quietly dramatic moments (in other words, talking scenes) so the movie doesn't turn into a relentless, flashing, pinball machine.  If you ever read the comic book, it really feels like a three-issue run from the mid-70's ""Hulk Smash! era.The deleted scenes in the 3-disc special edition are interesting.  Apparently a more pronounced love triangle between Betty, Bruce, and Betty's new boyfriend Leonard (who we learn, via one deleted scene, is actually comics character Leonard Samson, pre-irradiation experiment) was a bigger part of the original conception of the film.  Though the five or six deleted scenes involving this triangle are intriguing to see, I think I like the final film's decision to simply allude to the tension between the three characters instead of turning the middle part of the movie into an episode of ""As the Hulk Turns"".There are one or two deleted scenes involving General Ross that I wished were kept in the film.  Though never depicting him as warm and fuzzy, a couple of those scenes showed that his motivation to capture the Hulk and harness his power, though misguided, didn't come from an evil place.  If they were included in the film, those scenes would have made it easier to swallow the General's semi-change of heart at the end when he decides to extend an olive branch to Bruce and join forces with him to take down the Abomination.  That's a quibble, though.  The film and its developments in the current cut still work; there's just less explicit evidence on display that the General is capable of making that emotional leap.Other treats abound. There's a fun little cameo involving Iron Man's alter-ego Tony Stark which was clearly moved from its original ""Easter egg"" post-closing credits position to the final scene in the main body of the movie after the huge success of ""Iron Man"".  As said, it's an enjoyable cameo, but a little confusing: Is Tony asking General Ross to help him recruit the Hulk into the new super-team he's forming or offering the use of that team to help Ross take down the Hulk?  I guess we'll have to wait for the next round of Marvel movies to find out.  Also fun but somewhat under-written was the obligatory Stan Lee cameo, where we see him as an innocent bystander who drinks some gamma-infected soda pop (the scenario is not as inane as it sounds) and then freezes up and drops the soda bottle.  It's amazing to me that they missed the opportunity to have him writhe on the ground and turn at least a little green, if only for a moment.  Oh, well.More about the three-disc DVD I bought:  Though generous, the set is not as lavish as the term ""three-disc DVD"" might suggest.  The first disc is the movie (looks and sounds great) along with a commentary track; the second disc contains a thirty-minute or so ""making of"" piece, a few short (about ten minutes each) companion pieces that provide additional details about different aspects of the production, the deleted scenes I mentioned, and a cute piece (a few minutes long) showing how a scene from the movie was inspired by a scene in the comics.  The third disc is simply a digital copy of the film that you can upload and watch on your PC.I hope that the DVD release of ""The Incredible Hulk"" puts the movie over the top financially, offsetting its somewhat lackluster box office (so much for blowing the Ang Lee film out of the water). It would be be nice to see another chapter in this saga, after all, and without having to suffer through another re-boot, or semi-reboot, or whatever confusing technique they'd end up employing in a hand-wringing gesture to overthink the concept of what people want from this character that's simultaneously highly commercial and ""what's he really about?"" offbeat.",4,Probably the Hulk that most

1180671,A2T2MJP3IH8PT3,B001DHXT1G,J. Rogers,"[3, 4]","Well, well. Finally an appropriate redemption from that piece of crap ""Hulk"" movie from 2003. The new Hulk was true to its comic form, relevant, the actors were believable, the storyline kept you interested and the Action, was omg- Action packed!! Edward Norton was fantastic as Banner, not that I had any doubts. Although there are rumors that hes a perfectionist and hard to work with on the set, after seeing the finished product, it all paid off. He was completely realistic and relatable both as Banner and the Hulk. He had a slight vulnerability to  him in both roles that made him come across as the guy next door. He worked odd jobs in the movie,  moving from here to there quite frequently to be undetected by the Us government, which stayed true to the series. There were also salutes to Hulks past, giving very creative homage to the now deceased Bill Bixby, and the still in amazing shape, Lou Ferrigno who had a great cameo as a beefy security guard. Even Liv Tyler was very good. I wasnt sure she would be, as I did prefer Jennifer Connelly in the first movie. However, the chemistry she had with Edward Norton sold the movie and kept you interested in the underlying love story theme. All in all, you were in your seat fixated on the movie the whole time, and you left panting for more. The villians in the movie were also fantastic- at some point the government tries to make another Hulk-like super solider that ends up fighting the Hulk in the climactic final scene. It was a tad unbelivable that someone would volunteer to have that kind of transformation take place on purpose, where you want to become an enourmous Hulk-like creature, but hey, we have to suspend reality somewhere, after all, we are watching a super hero movie...lol! That villian was very cool, although they didnt need to have him talking. Being that he was initially a human, they had the human talking in the monster body. I think that took away from it ever so slightly. I love that the Hulk doesnt really say much except for a grunt here or there. It makes him more believable as a monster. (how funny is that last line... believable as a monster-lol!) When Hulk is Hulk, Banner isnt talking through him. They are very much seperate entities and that sells it. The villian they made reminded me a little of the movie ""The Mask"". When the mask was in the hands of the bad guy, he transformed into this monster but still ran around and spoke as the bad guy/human character. Whereas when Jim Carrey was the mask, he was a seperate entity altogether and one didn't remember any of the experiences of the latter. That is how the Hulk was. Banner did not have any complete memories of what happened when he was the Hulk. The end had some surprises also- as a cameo was made by Mr. Ironman himself, Tony Stark!! I almost jumped outta my seat on that one, as IronMan was a great kickoff to the summer but it did leave you wanting alot more. That movie was more of a preview to the sequels than a complete movie, as Hulk was. Now that leaves the door open to enjoy The Avengers perhaps, with some fantastic crossover action until Ironman2 and Hulk2 are ready for viewing.My take on the first Hulk was this. Ang Lee killed it. It wasnt supposed to be Crouching Hulk, Hidden Monster, ok. It was supposed to be what the new movie was. Hulk as Hulk. Thats it. Simplicity at its finest. If it aint broke, dont give it a damn Daddy Complex and make it way more deep that it needs to be. If you turned that movie on in the middle of it- youd never know youre watching the Hulk. It was like a damn lifetime movie. Way Tooo much thinking and creative liscense was taken with that movie and the end result was a hunk of crap. I couldnt believe how bad it was. Now I did feel for the actors- they were very very good, but the awful script and directing couldnt save them. I feel Jennifer Connelly was great and believable, as was Sam Elliot, who made a way better general than the one in the new film. However, you throw in killer poodles, and Hulk jumping over continents like SuperMario on crack and we got a problem. Love Hulk for what he is at his simplest form and dont add any filler. The story is good enough  and you dont need it.I LOVED this new movie and highly recommend it to everyone. Cannot wait to see what theyre going to do next in the Marvel franchise!!!

1180672,A1Q6SDPOCNEM3K,B001DHXT1G,J. Tester,"[7, 12]","This film is about one thing and one thing only: action. The film starts off w/the credits flying by in a haze of flashback scenes depicting the Hulk's origins, getting around the hour-long development which ""plagued"" the previous version (HULK - 2003). After the flashback sequences are finished, the movie throws you directly into the story as it has developed thus far. Banner is in hiding from the US Army, in South America, attempting to cure himself of the curse that has afflicted him. The film quickly moves into action, w/a chase sequence which leads the viewer through back streets and over the rooves of an enormous 3rd world city of shacks and decaying apartment buildings. One of the most popular scenes in the film takes place on a college campus, where military personnel attempt to take Banner into custody, but instead cause him to transform into his enormous, green counterpart.An action movie through and through, this film still has good performances from Edward Norton and Tim Roth. Less than Incredible performances from Liv Tyler and William Hurt keep this movie from attaining too much life, though. Roth's enjoyable portrayal of the self-centered and egomaniacal Major Emil Blonsky keeps things moving along despite sharing numerous scenes w/Hurt's slow and lackluster atttempts at character portrayal. Live Tyler works w/what she's given in this film which, unfortunately, wasn't much. Better writing for the character of Betty Ross would have been nice, but is not absolutely necessary, as Miss Ross' character is used primarily as a driving force for the Hulk's outbursts. When Hulk isn't about to be on-screen, her lines are primarily of a semi-comedic nature, which keeps the film feeling lightweight and fun, albeit nothing more.Overall, this film is just about everything the 2003 version was not - an over-the-top action-adventure story, full of cars being ripped apart and earth-shaking punches.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 2]","""The Incredible Hulk"" is a romp in a Marvel Comics translation into film, but lacks the depth ofIron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)orThe Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy). What could have been absolutely astonishing becomes only credible viewing enjoyment, a great popcorn movie, as other reviewers have described it.Edward Norton is fine as the scientist Bruce Banner, but not outstanding. He does a credible job with the script as presented, but motive is lacking, a foundation for the story. The film--its writers, director--assumes viewer knowledge of the Marvel story, but a great film would fold the viewer into the story by providing missing background. We know what the Colonel wants but not why Banner was participating.So the film ends up being superficial--all show and no depth. I want to know more about Tim Roth's character, what motivates him. The film certainly gives nod to the stereotype of the military seeking troop enhancement at all costs. Are they all like that? As for William Hurt as the Colonel, he went beyond his usual acting portrayals to give us at least a thoughtful ""villain"" rather than his usual bullish portraits. I thought this character was the highlight of the film.And moon-struck Betty? How did these two get together? I have to assume that Betty and Banner worked together, but how? Showing her wearing a lab coat cannot take the place of some kind of explanation. What is their connection? I know that a film cannot be all-inclusive but some are.Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)did just that! Now there's a five-star film!""Incredible Hulk"" is certainly a well-made film--the cinematography is awesome!--but it takes more than film editing and CGI to make an incredible movie.

Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[3, 3]","After seeing the incredibly good superhero movie, Iron Man, in May, I knew any other superhero movies or summer action movies in general had a bar set high by such a good movie. The Incredible Hulk doesn't reach that level, but is surprisingly good as I went in with low expectations (particularly after seeing other genre movies not live up to the hype, as in Indiana Jones IV). Everywhere the 2003 Hulk movie failed, The Incredible Hulk seemed to succeed and give the audience what they were looking for.As with Iron Man, the production values are high from Marvel Studios. The acting from Norton is what shines as it has always been important to empathize with the Bruce Banner character (something not easy to do with Eric Bana's emotionless performance). Also, the ""fugitive on-the-run"" aspect was always important, particularly in the TV series and to some part in the comics. That is very apparent here as it runs 30min. or so before the Hulk even appears (similar to Batman's appearance in Batman Begins, though not as long) and even then, it is in the shadows of a factory. (It did remind me a little of Iron Monger's appearance from the shadows in Iron Man. I do think Marvel tried and succeeded for the most part in tying both of these movies together with several references, though some would only be obvious to the die-hard fans of the comic.)The acting from the rest of the cast is either appropriate for the character (Liv Tyler's Betty Ross) or somewhat over-the-top as with Hurt's General Ross and Roth's Abomination. (Also, noteworthy, Marvel seems to have used two villains in Iron Man and in The Incredible Hulk that are late generation villains instead of pulling some from the 40-year old depository. In fairness, Iron Man and Hulk have never had the most famous or memorable villains.)The cameos from Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno are as enduring as ever, as a nod to the creator of and the first actor to play the Hulk.This movie mixes enough drama and action to get to the heart of what makes this kind of movie work. Ang Lee tried to make a cerebral, artsy type of movie in 2003 and it failed to reach even the die-hard fans. The Hulk is what he is, a smashing, no-nonsense abnormality where action is a must.The plot/story follows Bruce (Norton) as he is in South America looking for a cure to rid him of the Hulk. (They show how he became afflicted in the opening credits.) There is a nice roof-level chase through a run-down mountainous village that gets things going. Special forces force him to leave and head back to the states which is where the rest of the movie takes place and where drama is mixed nicely with action.The CGI Hulk looks far better than the 2003 version. The interaction with the actors and the CGI Hulk is far more believable.The musical score is a very good with one musical cue reference to the old TV show, which I thought was very nice.The moments between Bruce and Betty are nicely done and seem more natural, less forced than the relationship in the 2003 movie. (It's probably because the acting is much better, and Norton plays vulnerable so very well.)POSSIBLE SPOILERS, THOUGH DOUBTFULAs stated earlier, their are significant cross-references with Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, with some being references to S.H.I.E.L.D.--the special military group in Iron Man; Stark Industries as the weapon supplier to the special forces team hunting down the Hulk; and the ultimate cameo of Tony Stark towards the end of the movie, suggesting a team is being formed--foreshadowing the inevitable Avengers movie.END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERSAs I mentioned, I went in skeptical, but came out very impressed. There were even audience members clapping afterwards, which I certainly didn't hear when Indy IV ended.Go see it and help support Marvel Studios independent productions.

1180678,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001DHXT1G,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","The summer of 2008 proved to be an extremely lucrative one for Marvel with the one-two punch of ""Iron Man"" followed by ""The Incredible Hulk"". Granted in terms of monetary value and profit margin, Marvel gained more from ""Iron Man"" than their second attempt at adapting the not-so jolly green giant for the big screen. Even so, under their new Marvel Studios filmmaking branch it seems that the self-proclaimed ""House of Ideas"" is off to a terrific start, and has chosen to make very solid, entertaining film adaptations that hold true to their source material. As some of you may remember, and no doubt many of you did (due to the lower box office totals, I would say it's safe to say most of you did), Marvel's previous attempt to adapt their angry jade ""hero"" didn't exactly go over very well with comic book fans and general moviegoers, essentially making ""Hulk"" into Marvel's first flop of the new comic book movie age.Which brings us to Marvel's second, yet first self-produced, remake ""The Incredible Hulk"" (their first re-do was 2004's ""The Punisher""). To me the film would be more accurately viewed as Marvel's way of saying, ""We are incredibly sorry for stealing away two hours of your life with the psycho-babble in Ang Lee's whine-fest of an excuse for a movie."" But that tagline for the film would probably be too long and distracting. Thus, we now find ourselves with yet another Hulk movie on our hands, but is this film all that different from what came before? In a word...yes. The difference between the two adaptations is basically as follows:  unlike 2003's ""Hulk"" (Ang Lee's version, for those not keeping up) this new film knows what it takes to make the character work for audiences. Although it's really a shame that this Hulk wasn't able to smash so much more at the box office (we can all thank Ang Lee for ruining that possibility), after all the character's potential was fully and spectacularly realized in this adaptation.""The Incredible Hulk"" tells the story of brilliant scientist Bruce Banner, who has been living in secrecy from the prying eyes of the United States government for several years as he attempts to rid himself of a very strong curse...the Hulk that resides within. After some unfortunate events lead to the military discovering his whereabouts, Banner soon discovers that he has no choice but to stand and fight against those who would use the monster within him as a weapon of destruction.After I watched this film there was only one string of thoughts I had running through my mind, ""Now, that is what an Incredible Hulk movie is all about! Intense action, plenty of drama, bits of romance and comedy sprinkled throughout, not to mention a talented cast of actors and actresses, and visual effects that will blow you away. If you haven't been able to forget about Ang Lee's travesty, then you haven't seen this film yet."" Well, maybe my thoughts weren't exactly like that, but they were similar in nature, I know that for a fact.Anyways, let's begin by discussing the actors chosen to bring their respective comic book counterparts to life on the big screen. Each cast member was perfectly chosen, even if the choice didn't seem that obvious from the get-go. For instance, actor Edward Norton (""American History X"") was not my first choice for Bruce Banner/The Hulk, and even after the initial trailers were released I still wasn't sure if he could do some of the non-Hulk action that the film was clearly calling for. I do not doubt that Edward could handle the dramatic side of the character, but all the running, jumping, and even some fighting were not things this actor is normally known for in his work. However, I am more than willing to admit that I was mistaken in my uncertainty regarding his abilities, and Norton truly owned the role of Banner. He imbues this tortured soul with such an anxious intensity and passion for finding a cure that the audience fully understands and relates to everything he is going through. Beneath all the angst over his curse, Norton also reveals a man broken down by his lot in life and the sacrifices he's been forced to make to protect those he loves from himself. Every aspect of Edward's portrayal was perfectly in keeping with the character's emotions, motivations, and thought processes in the comic books.Joining Edward Norton is the talented veteran actor William Hurt (""A History of Violence"") portraying the man hunting Bruce Banner, General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. This casting choice made perfect sense to me, as William always seems to immerse himself into any character thrown his way, and it's that very dedication to his craft that made him the prime candidate for this modern day Captain Ahab. William delivers a performance that is rife with an intense hatred that drives him forward on his borderline nihilistic mission to capture Banner and unleash the beast. Assisting Ross in this dangerous endeavor is Tim Roth (TV's ""Lie to Me"") as Emil Blonsky, a military man past his prime, yet still thriving on the thrill of battle. Roth creates in Blonsky a warrior without any sense of remorse, in essence a sociopath whose mindset makes him both the ideal soldier for Ross' mission and the perfect weapon for the general to throw into the Hulk's path.Lastly, actress Liv Tyler (""Armageddon"") as Betty Ross was even more of a maligned pick in my book than Edward Norton. I've never been all that taken by Liv in any of her roles, and even after her performance here (which is very good by the way) I still would have preferred Jennifer Connelly (who portrayed Betty in Ang Lee's ""Hulk""), but that is driven more by her appearance than anything else. That being said, Liv does a very good job with Betty, giving her plenty of dimension and depth of character, making her much more than just the damsel in distress. She's very much an independent woman, and her portrayal is one that is probably more believable, in terms of appearance, than that of Jennifer Connelly, who let's face it didn't really look like she would actually be a scientist.The story for ""The Incredible Hulk"" was written by Zak Penn (""X-Men: The Last Stand"") and co-written (although not credited) by Edward Norton. This adaptation of the Hulk was much more faithful to the comics that inspired it, no doubt influenced by the fact that Marvel itself was financing the picture. Unlike its predecessor, ""The Incredible Hulk"" opted for a much more streamlined approach to the origin story, something that other comic book adaptations could take to heart. What took Ang Lee two hours or more to create, this script accomplished in a much more concise, and altogether clearer manner. Gone is all the psycho-babble, daddy issues of ""Hulk"", and in their place we have a crystal clear storyline, full of character-driven drama that is both gripping and intriguing, loaded with action and spectacle, plus a flawed hero that is much more believable and charismatic than anything the former could muster. On every single level ""The Incredible Hulk"" delivers a top-notch story that comic book fans have always hoped for, and all their loyalty and patience has been brilliantly rewarded.Directing this latest adaptation we have action director Louis Letterier (""Unleashed""). For Ang Lee's vision of the Hulk's story, we were treated to some very stylistic, yet questionable choices about the editing and look of the overall film. Louis Letterier wisely chose to avoid over-stylizing the movie, opting for more of a down-and-dirty action film that felt much grittier and even realistic (which is an odd thing to say when discussing a movie that's subject is a giant green monster). Truly the only stylized element Letterier brought to the film, in my opinion, were his trademark fast-paced, quick cut action scenes that are designed to heighten the intensity of the moment even more than what the story was doing on its own. It's a gimmick used by many filmmakers today to assist in creating even more powerful action-heavy sequences, and it is probably one that is used far too often as a crutch more than anything else. However, Letterier has mastered the art of the quick cut, and deftly uses it to his advantage in every film he directs, and ""The Incredible Hulk"" is no exception.Finally, the visual effects for this incarnation of Hulk is leaps and bounds above anything featured in Ang Lee's version (this should be the last comparison to that film). The talented people at Rhythm and Hues were responsible for creating the surprisingly lifelike CGI creations of Hulk and Abomination. Truthfully, making an audience believe that a giant green monster is actually present amongst humans cannot be an easy endeavor; however, the stunning visual effects work done in this film (similar to what was done for ""King Kong"") is as close to creating a realistic human-esque monster as we can probably get (at least for a little while). Out of all the CGI-intensive films released in 2008, ""The Incredible Hulk"" boasted the very best the industry had to offer, and it was a shame that the film and its creative geniuses weren't recognized for it this last award season.""The Incredible Hulk"" is a fast-moving, intense action film that boasts some of the most impressive visuals you will see in a film for quite some time. This movie effectively recreates the film version of the character to be more inline with his comic book counterpart, becoming the definitive Hulk for audiences to enjoy watching for years to come.""The Incredible Hulk"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",5,"Forget Ang Lee's Version, This Is The Hulk Fans Want...",1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,9551,"['summer', '2008',

1180680,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B001DHXT1G,Justin G.,"[1, 1]","Despite my longtime obsession with comic books, I've never really been a Hulk fan. I was vaguely interested in the cartoons and the live action series as a kid, and I seem to recall having a Hulk action figure at some point (did it have a rubber head?) but never went out of my way to read the comics, and wasn't at all interested in the 2003 movie. Still, I was riding a post-Iron Man high and was intrigued enough by the previews to check out the Incredible Hulk.The Incredible Hulk had a few things going for it that the first Hulk didn't namely a fine cast (Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, and William Hurt) and a Hulk that despite being entirely CGI-rendered did not look like Shrek's big brother. Drawing more from the old Hulk television series than the comic books was also a smart move. The brief ""origin"" sequence at the beginning was very reminiscent of the old series opening, and effectively satisfied the origin requirement in a minimal amount of time. Playing up the fugitive aspect from the show also made for a more interesting movie, and combined with the exotic locales gave it a Bourne Identity feel. The theme music and ""don't make me angry (or hungry, apparently)"" lines also brought back that classic Hulk vibe.I loved the pace of the story, and there was just enough balance between Banner's quest for chemical salvation and the Hulk's rage-induced rampages. The final conflict between the Hulk and Tim Roth's Abomination was completely predictable, but was still great cinematic eye candy. I still have issues with characters that are totally CGI, but I have to admit the Hulk looked pretty impressive. Not quite real, but definitely more ""there"" than most CGI creations.Naturally my favorite scene was the epilogue. Similar to the bonus scene in Iron Man, it sets the stage for things to come. I was convinced early on that we'd see another cameo, expecting (MINOR SPOILER ALERT) Mr. Blue to turn out to be Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, but alas that was not to be.It's not quite the triumph that Iron Man was, but the Incredible Hulk is a very impressive comic book movie and a first-rate action movie as well.

Lots of great action and computer work.The incredible hulk is a great flick.  Modeled after the TV series starring Bill Bixby, and the comic book series too, I believe.  The basic premise is:  He gets mad and turns into a huge green thing. Great animation.  The flick is filmed in NY, Rio, and Toronto?  Ed Norton does a great job as The Hulk, as does Liv Tyler as his friend and former girlfriend.  William Hurt plays a hot shot General, who wants to disect whatever is making Ed Norton turn into The Hulk, so he can use ""it"" as a weapon.An experiment goes haywire and Norton (Bruce) turns into this huge green thing, whenever he gets really excited.  He runs off to Brazil, to hide out from everybody and try to figure out how to control his body chemistry. (You think you got it bad when your deodorant fails.)  Anyway, he is off in Brazil, wearing a heart monitor wristband and trying to keep his heart rate below 200. He tries anger management through breathing techniques. Meanwhile, he is quietly working in an old delapidated bottled soda/juice factory, hiding out while he searches for a cure from gamma ray poisoning. When a drop of his very special blood accidentally gets into a bottle on the line and makes a man sick, the government finds out and the chase is on. As he is being chased across the rooftops of Brazil, his heart rate begins to increase. The story line has him next in Guatemala and then Mexico and still being chased.Dr Elizabeth/Betty Ross (Liv) now has a boyfriend.

Loria,"[5, 8]","Naturally comparisons to the 2003 Hulk movie are inevitable due to the proximity of release, the original was that bad, but the INCREDIBLE HULK seems to have a better handle on what fans want to see in a action movie / comicbook movie tie-in.  The pacing is great, dumping the all too familiar origin into the opening credits is editing genius.  If you're a continuity purist, you may even be able to connect the movies in your mind, but it is obviously intended to reboot the Hulk and ignore the 2003 release which is fine by me.After a brief glimpse of Banner, played superbly with all the pathos you'd expect by Ed Norton,  we are thrown right into the chase. General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) and the US Army in hot pursuit of Dr. Banner, inevitably  leading to a ""Hulk-fight"" in a factory. This fight introducesTim Roth as  comicbook villain Emil Blonsky, initially only a soldier who wants to beat the Hulk by experimenting with the ""Super-soldier serium (a plot line tied to the origin of Captain America) later transforming into The Abomination, a creature maybe surpassing the Hulks own incredible super-strength and aggression.The CGI is better than last time, but still not perfect.  I like the mix of live prosthetics and CGI used in the Extraordinary League of Gentleman for Hyde, better. The Hulk combat is classic and cool , isn't that the real reason to make a big budget Hulk film?Cool Cameos to watch for :Tim Blake Nelson (best known as Pendanski from HOLES) aka Samuel Sterns aka Mr. Blue aka THE LEADER is a major supervillain. In the movie we see events, probably cut, that make it clear he'll be back and brainy! Originally, in comic form a janitor at Banner's lab when hit by the same gamma radiation that turned Bruce into the Hulk. He green too, but evil and smart. Given the name games in the new HULK movie, and the altered nature of his origin, he may be BLUE this time.A cameo in itself is the original Hulk TV Theme by the late Joseph Hartnell (who died in 2005) which turns up now and then throughout the movie soundtrack. Thanks guys.The Hulk's original purple pants, briefly appear.The classic TV line: ""Don't make me angry...you wouldn't like me when I'm angry"" shows up, but not quite as you'd expect.Actor Nicholas Rose appears as McGee  in an homage to the reporter (actor Jack Colvin)  who pursued ""David"" Bruce Banner throughout the 70's TV series. This time he is a campus reporter for the college paper witnessing the HULK vs the ARMY.LOU FERRIGNO aka the ORIGINAL TV HULK is again a security guard (this time without Stan Lee). Lou is in great shape there, but this time he serves an even cooler role as the voice of the speaking HULK!!  Sweet!!  LOU you are still the MAN!!Even Ferrigno's TV counterpart, the late great Bill Bixby aka the original TV DR.BANNER shows up on the screen in a TV clip from what looks like the ""Courtship of Eddie's Father.""Comic series / creator / writer STAN LEE makes his cameo in this one as the guy who get a Hulk-contaminated drink. I don't know if this one connects to a comic reference or not, but it is always great to see STAN ""the Man"" LEE, hopefully he's hard at work on Iron Man 2 , Thor and Avenger screenplays.",5,HULK ANGRY!

1180687,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B001DHXT1G,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[10, 17]","Yes, there's more action in this movie. For some that may be all the recommendation they'll need for ""The Incredible Hulk,"" the sequel/franchise reboot to Oscar winner Ang Lee's film that underperformed at the box office a few years ago. That film was denounced by uneducated film viewers (AKA: teenagers) as being a slow, action-less film that could have used more Hulk in it. Well, this new film does contain more Hulk. More Hulk, more CGI, and more action. Midway through the film you'll feel as though you were watching a video game that you could no longer control. But let's start at the beginning. In keeping with their promise to rebuild the franchise into something that has a better box office life-span, the director opens the movie with the origin of the Hulk.The origin is rushed and oversimplified to a great extent, but then the film makers have lots of action sequences they want to get to. So the movie opens with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton, who replaces Eric Bana) living in Brazil (even though the last we saw Hulk was in Africa), working in a soda factory and trying to cure himself of the Hulk blood that runs through his veins. So paranoid is Bruce that he takes up self-meditation and wears a heartbeat tracker, which leads to an awkwardly funny moment later on in the film when there is the potential for sex on the horizon. Since the movie is more about action then it is about story though, we all know Bruce can't stay safe in the haven he's created. Not long after that General Ross (William Hurt replacing the wonderful Sam Elliot) finds out where Bruce is and orders an attack on the guy.So the military tries getting him in Brazil. Then at a college university. Then in the middle of the city. As this went on I was wondering whether or not the general had some superiors of his own to answer to. Surely the government does not approve of hostile military force on home and foreign soil, all blowing things up relentlessly without any foreseeable results? Well, results or not, none of this registered with me because I've spent most of my life watching movies where cities get destroyed, that to simply destroy things without an ounce of style or wit seems like a futile effort. Watching a clown make balloon animals would be more interesting at this point. But alas, the movie is not content to let Hulk fight the army itself, and so the army reveals that they want the Hulk's DNA to create their own line of super human soldiers (foreshadowing for the Captain America movie maybe?).The result is that the Army ends up creating the Abomination, an ugly...something or other that's just as big, just as mean, and just as fake looking as the Hulk. So, of course, the two have to fight each other creating what will likely be the fakest looking climax of the summer. The ending to the last Harry Potter film looked more realistic then this, and that had wizards, lizards, and sprites in it. Okay, so the creators obviously wanted to steer the franchise away from Ang Lee's somber affair and sell this as an action movie. I can understand that. Lee's ""Hulk"" was certainly a more sophisticated effort, one that required more patience then the average superhero movie, and I knew it would be a tough sell once word-of-mouth got out on how little action there really was in the film.But geez, did they have to simplify the film THIS MUCH!?! ""Hulk"" may not have been a very loved film, but at least it was ABOUT something! Bruce Banner was an interesting character who struggled with his curse, and even admitted he fears it because he likes it so much (a metaphor used by alcoholics). This Bruce describes his experience with the words a hippie might use to describe being high. Lee's ""comic book"" style of film, where boxes and lines made the movie look like a living comic book, has been excused for a more straightforward approach to filming. Therefor the look of the film is typical and average.Getting rid of Jennifer Connely as Betty Ross was a big mistake, as Liv Taylor does nothing interesting with the role. The same goes with replacing Sam Elliot with William Hurt as the General. Hurt should have been good in this role, but he looks like he's making a kids movie or something (then again...maybe he is). Does any of this really matter? I have to be honest: I have no idea. Yeah, this smells like box office success, but I just get the feeling that it's going to be a small victory. As time has gone by, Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" was starting to develop a cult following of people who were growing up, and now appreciating the complexity of the story. ""The Incredible Hulk"" on the other hand feels like the B movie of the week: lots of actions, instant gratification, and something you won't even remember by the time the next special effects powerhouse comes out.Rating: ** stars",2,Not So Incredible,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,4810,"['Yes', 'more', 'action', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'recommendation', ""'ll"", 'need', 'Incredible', 'Hulk',

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","No longer weighed down by the angst and downright boring emotional drivel of the Ang Lee vision, ""The Incredible Hulk"" allows the big green angry guy to flex his muscles a bit more.  I'm sure there are some fans out there who enjoy their Hulk with tears and a blanket, but I believe that most fans really just want to see him smash and crash his way through everything.Edward Norton takes the purple pants from Eric Bana and gives us a more convincing portrayal, albeit in limited screentime, of Dr. Banner. Also in a limited role is William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross.  While he does a sufficient job, a part of me longed to see Sam Elliott back in the role.  Tim Roth provides the film with a villain in the form of Blonksy.  Liv Tyler takes on Betty Ross, but, as with the rest of the actors in this film, has limited screentime compared to the big green one.The story finds our hero (Norton) hiding out in South America and trying to learn how to control and/or cure his emerald alter-ego.  When the military finally catches up to him, though, the story's pace quickens and features a chase that takes us from a college campus to the city streets.  Hulk fights through sonic weapons, helicopters and automobiles and uses a few jeeps, chains and whatever else happens to be nearby as a weapon.  In short, the meat of this film is action, and fans of action will go to bed after watching ""The Incredible Hulk"" with a full stomach.Light on story, heavy on action and plenty of nods to the classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno television series make ""The Incredible Hulk"" a big improvement over its big screen predecessor.  There are also a few blinks of what is to come in the future ""Avengers"" film.Is ""The Incredible Hulk"" perfect?  No, but it's still an excellent film.

I had to smile at the homage references to the Hulk TV series.  The opening section of the movie in the Brazilian slums was a nice touch - it was certainly a different setting for a movie like this.For me in many ways it was the final scenes of this movie that were the most interesting, and if you enjoyed Iron Man you should pick up this movie for that alone.  I've given this review three stars because of the over-extended fight sequence at the end of it (shades of Spider Man 3!) and the cgi which disappointed me a little as they seem to have relied on it to make up for the lack of character relationships (one of the highlights of the TV series), but if there is a sequel to this movie I'll watch it on DVD if nothing else.",3,"Lots of cgi but still an enjoyable, if long, movie",1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,940,"['have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'up', 'last', 'fight', 'sequence', 'seemed', 'drag', 'made', 'hit', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'sections', 'feeling', 'lost', 'anything', 'had', 'smile', 'homage', 'references', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'series', 'opening', 'section', 'movie', 'Brazilian', 'slums', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'was', 'certainly', 'different', 'setting', 'movie', 'this.For', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'Iron', 'Man', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'alone', ""'ve"", 'given', 'review', 'three', 'stars', 'over-extended', 'fight', 'sequence', 'end', 'shades', 'Spider', 'Man', '3', 'cgi', 'disappointed', 'little', 'seem', 'have', 'relied', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'character', 'relationships', 'one', 'highlights', 'TV', 'series', 'sequel', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A

Nelson,"[3, 3]",Well first  I'm going to tell what I liked about Lees so called Hulk and going I'm going to tell you what I really liked about The Incredible Hulk. I will also tell what problems the Hulk had and if they fixed it in the new First Hulk.It started out really slow. Plus they did this comic book trick with some of the scenes that was pretty dumb. I did however like the action. I think it would have been a better idea to let one of the dogs go and latter on he could fight again. The acting wasn't that good. I thought that they shouldn't have cast Eric Bana as Dr. Banner. I thought he was a little to buff to be him. I thought The Hulk looked good at times but also thought it looked to green. Nick Nolte was really bad in his role. The fight towards the end wasn't all that good either.Problems1. Bad Acting2. Comic Book scenes3. Bad Casting4. Hulk didn't look right5. Not that much good actionSecond The Incredible HulkThis was a very fast paced movie but good. The casting here was so perfect here. I really liked Tim Roth as Blonskey. He was a really better villain than in the other Hulk movie. I also liked the story telling. The best things here is the acting and the cgi . The Hulk green was toned down and looked better. Especially during dark scenes. The abomination looked  good to. The acting was also better in this movie. I also liked how the set up the next villain in the next movie. It also sets up also a future Avengers movie. Now for the action. It was 100x better now. The visuals during the college fight was so nicely done when they shot this sound cannon at him. The big showdown between The Hulk and The Abomination was so cool. Also it was very violent and physical. There was no problems here. They fixed everything.Compared to this and Ironman. Story wise I like Ironman. Action wise I choose The Incredible Hulk. They improved a lot better with this movie. I'm hoping this movie will get people back on track to go see a good movie when the first movie (like The Hulk) sucked.,5,"Ang Lee's  ""Hulk"" Got Smashed",1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,2006,"['Well', 'first', ""'m"", 'going', 'tell', 'what', 'liked', 'Lees', 'so', 'called', 'Hulk', 'going', ""'m"", 'going', 'tell', 'what', 'really', 'liked', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'will', 'also', 'tell', 'what', 'problems', 'Hulk', 'had', 'fixed', 'new', 'First', 'Hulk.It', 'started', 'out', 'really', 'slow', 'did', 'comic', 'book', 'trick', 'scenes', 'was', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'did', 'however', 'action', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'idea', 'let', 'one', 'dogs', 'go', 'latter', 'could', 'fight', 'again', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'thought', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'cast', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Dr', 'Banner', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'buff', 'be', 'thought', 'Hulk', 'looked', 'good', 'times', 'also', 'thought', 'looked', 'green', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'role', 'fight', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'either.Problems1', 'Bad', 'Acting2', 'Comic', 'Book', 'scenes3', 'Bad', 'Casting4', 'Hulk', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'right5', 'Not', 'much', 'good', 'actionSecond', 'Incredible', 'HulkThis', 'was', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'good', 'casting', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'perfect', 'here', 'really', 'liked', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Blonskey', 'was', 'really', 'better', 'villain', 'other', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'also', 'liked', 'story', 'telling', 'best', 'things', 'here', 'acting', 'cgi', 'Hulk', 'green', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'looked', 'better', 'Especially', 'dark', 'scenes', 'abomination', 'looked', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'better', 'movie', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'next', 'villain', 'next', 'movie', 'also', 'up', 'also', 'future', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'Now', 'action', 'was', '100x', 'better', 'now', 'visuals', 'college', 'fight', 'was', 'so', 'nicely', 'done', 'when', 'shot', 'sound', 'cannon', 'big', 'showdown', 'Hulk', 'Abomination', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'Also', 'was', 'very', 'violent', 'physical', 'was', 'problems', 'here', 'fixed', 'everything.Compared', 'Ironman', 'Story', 'wise', 'Ironman', 'Action', 'wise', 'choose', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'improved', 'lot', 'better', 'movie', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'people', 'back', 'track', 'go', 'see', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'movie', 'Hulk', 'sucked']",N/A

Lee's version had action ""choreographed"" better while in this movie some fights look too cartoonish and cheesy. The sequence when the two superhumans run and jump towards each other was silly and boring, for example.At the end the problem Bruce Banner has was well realized with a sense of dread and almost hopelessness and all that simultaneous with Hulk gaining more respect and actual fame instead of infamy.The film has a nice low key and dark visual style, almost reminiscent of low budget movies but at the same time being able to afford to pay full attention to details.

This is how the story goes: Scientist Bruce Banner desperately hunts for a cure to the gamma radiation that poisoned his cells and unleashes the unbridled force of rage within him: The Hulk. Living in the shadows--cut off from a life he knew and the woman he loves, Betty Ross--Banner struggles to avoid the obsessive pursuit of his nemesis, General Thunderbolt Ross, and the military machinery that seeks to capture him and brutally exploit his power. As all three grapple with the secrets that led to The Hulk's creation, they are confronted with a monstrous new adversary known as The Abomination, whose destructive strength exceeds even The Hulk's own. To stop it, one scientist must make an agonizing final choice: accept a peaceful life as Bruce Banner or find heroism in the creature he holds inside--The Incredible Hulk. The cast led by Edward Norton (excellent as Bruce Banner / The Incredible Hulk), Liv Tyler (as Betty Ross), Tim Roth (as Emil Blonsky / The Abomination), and William Hurt (as General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross) is excellent!

The casting by Laray Mayfield (who also did the casting to the upcoming ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button (2008), ""Zodiac"" (2007), ""Panic Room"" (2002), & ""Fight Club"" (1999, also starring Norton), which were directed by David Fincher) is excellent! The production design by Kirk M. Petruccelli (who also did the production design to ""Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" (2007), ""Ghost Rider"" (2007), & ""Blade"" (1998) is excellent! The art direction by Page Buckner, Daniel T.

(And people wonder why I love Wonder Woman.)  Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003 was a huge disappointment!  Those comic book panels didn't sit well with me and the CGI was laughable.I was hesitant as I saw this movie.  Hmmm...not bad.  The storyline continues from 2003.  Banner is in hiding, somewhere in South America, and is working in a factory.  Meanwhile, he has been emailing with someone in search of a treatment for his exposure to gamma radiation.  This contact, we only know him as Mr. Blue.General Ross, with help, discovers Banner's hiding place and sends a team, headed by Emil Blonsky to capture him.  Of course, Banner, as Hulk, is unstoppable and is able to get away.  After this escape, as Banner, he reunites with Betty Ross.Not one to be discouraged, Blonsky continues his search.  However, Ross tells Blonsky about a special serum that could give him super soldier strength.  Blonsky asks for the injection and his next confrontation with the Hulk becomes interesting.In search for answers, Banner and Betty finally meet Mr. Blue, who is really a research professor, Dr. Sam Sterns.  Sterns is able to synthesize an antidote.  However, Banner and Betty disagree with Sterns' mission for the antidote and persuade Stern to destroy the supply.  Unexpectedly, Blonsky arrives and forces Stern to inject him with this antidote.  Of course, things go wrong and Blonsky becomes Abomination, who seems to be much bigger than Hulk.And it's the fight of all fights.The storyplot...ok.  Special effects...ok.  I just get bored with these angry men/creatures fighting like primitives.P.S. - At the end, you'll see Tony Stark (aka Ironman) approaching General Ross about assembling a team.  If you're current with Hollywood gossips and news, The Avengers is next (slated for 2011).  However, not before Ironman 2 and a Wolverine movie.  Apparently, Spider-Man, Ironman, Hulk and Wolverine will be the Avengers.  (I'm already disappointed with the team lineup.  No Thor?  No Spiderwoman?  No Black Widow?  No Hawkeye?  No She-Hulk?  And if you know your comics, Wolverine isn't an Avengers.  He's an X-Man.  Hulk isn't a team player.

He adds reality and commitment to even the comic book world of the Hulk.  Norton has two Oscar nominations for ""Primal Fear"" in 1996 & ""American History X"" in 1998.  He was nominated as Best Actor by the Independent Spirit Awards for the lyrical and movingThe Painted Veil.  As Bruce, his calm demeanor is the perfect foil for the wild anger of the Hulk.Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross (sounds like Betsy Ross) who was in love with Bruce.  She carries her torch for him and serves as the damsel in distress.  Oscar winner William Hurt plays Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, a military man who wears his patriotism with blinders on & places his own career interest above his daughter's love & respect.  Tim Roth does a great job as the loony Emil Blonsky who transforms into a bigger hulk.  Tim Blake Nelson was named Best Director for ""O"" by the Seattle International Film Festival.  In this film he plays Samuel Sterns, aka Mr. Blue, who is jazzed about the scientific possibilities that the Hulk's physiology contains.  Ty Burrell who was in ""Black Hawk Down"" has a strong appearance as Leonard, Betty's new beau who sticks up for her to her father, even after she's dropped everything to help Bruce.  Christina Cabot who was inThe Maldonado Miraclehas a strong showing as Major Kathleen Sparr who stands up for what's right.  The DVD deleted scenes are interesting.

Admittedly, 'Superman's III and IV' and the moronic Joel Shumacher 'Batman' films certainly requires liberal doses of liquid brain bleach when screened. But I've always categorized those as infantile satire - not real films.No question Lee has talent - none. But let's be honest and say there are obvious limits to that talent. And his attempt at the world of comicdom is where that line exists. Sans flying kung fu priestesses and lonely men in tents, the first incarnation of the Hulk redefined the term ""the living dead"" - as most of the audience, including myself, were virtually flatlined having sat through that mind-numbing crapfest.An announced revamp of the entire project did little to recharge my enthusiasm. There was absolutely no way I was going to go through another monstrosity without the monster. A difficult decision given how much of a fan I am all the actors attached to the sequel; most especially Tim Roth, a favorite performer. But I usually make an effort to avoid the axiom definition of insanity.Fast forward four years. Just screened 'Marvel's: The Avengers'. Wow - incredible film!My curiosity was piqued. Watch the only original Avenger flick that I intentionally avoided? Take the chance of being ticked off again at expending funds and, more importantly, wasting time screening another pile?Ah screw it.Couple of hours later - I was wrong.This was not bad. Not bad at all. It wasn't quite the quality of the 'Iron Man' films, 'Thor' or 'Captain America' - but it was close. And any improvement from the Lee disaster would be reason to celebrate. So I'm giving a lot of credit to Director Louis Leterrier. He saved the character from the well-deserved bitterness directed at the utter failure of the first film.Had a decently fun time and, more importantly, I was able to engage the characters this time around. Bruce, Betsy, William Hurt's lesser interpretation of General Ross (Sam Elliot was the lone performance from the original that I enjoyed) and even the fully CGI'd Other Guy.The script struck the right blend of action and thoughtful insight - bringing us into the terrible existence of Dr. Banner as he runs, hiding in various third-world bleep holes, desperately trying to avoid the relentless pursuit by the government. The refreshing plot proposition that he's ""property"" owned by the United States, and not a man with an illness, certainly added unexpected depth to the story.Additionally, the clever nods to the original television Hulk - incorporating Joe Harnell's haunting soundtrack, the rain soaked walking man, and other fun cameos added a lot of value to the rental fee. However, I do kinda wish the filmmakers showed what happened to Stan Lee when he drank that very special bottle.  :-DMovie Note:- Again, having recently watched 'The Avengers', I noticed the calendar. Almost a full decade had passed since that terrible first film. Amazing how much better, how much more improved the character was when Mark Ruffalo took on the role. Proof that some particularly adept directors, like Joss Whedon, can learn from the mistakes of others. I'm always amazed that some directors actually listen to fans; they're usually so high on themselves, disconnected from reality - i.e. Joel Shumacher - that nothing penetrates their egos.Personal Note:- Disliked one of the plot threads because it was left unanswered: What happened to Bruce's dog? As a person who considers the four-legged ones his kids, stuff like this tends to irritate. Would you forget your kid?

Some how, the process turns Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) into a giant green monster, the Hulk.But that was several years ago. (How many, we are never sure.) These days, Bruce is hiding out in Brazil working at a soda bottle company and learning to control his anger.But he can't stay hidden forever, and soon General Ross (William Hurt) gets a bead on his location. He sets up a team to go in and retrieve him, even bring in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help.When things don't go as planned, Bruce decides it is time to head home and get help. But that means reconnecting with General Ross' daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Is there a cure for Bruce's condition? Can the two get it?This movie started our fairly slowly, making me glad that so much hit the cutting room floor.  But once Liv Tyler's Betty is introduced, things really pick up.  Not necessarily the action, but the drama.  Betty and Bruce's complicated relationship captured me and pulled me into the story.  Those two have some wonderful scenes together.  And the two actors capture the tenderness and chemistry perfectly, which doesn't surprise me at all.  Every time I have seen them, I have been blown away by their performances.  Not that I'm detracting from the rest of the cast, who are fine.  And watch for fun cameos by Stan Lee and TV Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, not to mention in the very last scene.The Hulk was created with a combination of motion capture and computer animation.  Sometimes, that foundation was obvious.  But most of the time you could believe what you were seeing on the screen was real.  And they never took me out of the film, which is important because the climatic battle was very emotional, not just some big fight scene.The original Hulk was just okay, but this one really made me care about the characters.

1180723,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001DHXT1G,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","Back in the seventies television attempted to bring the story of the Incredible Hulk, Marvel Comics gargantuan green goliath to the small screen. It succeeded in telling not the story of just the monster but of the man inside, trying to find a way to stop the dangerous beast inside.In 2005, we had another version arrive, this time directed by Ang Lee. While Lee is noted for his storytelling ability, there was no way he was the man to bring this character to the big screen. Plotlines were change to accommodate the times and the director leaving fans with a less than favored film.This year director Louis Letterrier who worked with Corey Yuen on THE TRANSPORTER and directed THE TRANSPORTER 2, takes over and finally give the monster his due. With touching scenes between ill fated lovers and fight sequences that have to be seen to be believed, this film finally does the tale justice.The film semi-bypasses the last by giving us glimpses of the creation of the Hulk. Gamma radiated scientist Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) has no chance of stopping the release of his inner rage in the form of the giant green monster that dwells within. Somewhat of a take on the old Jekyll and Hyde story, the Hulk destroys his lab and injures the love of his life, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler).The Hulk also incurs the wrath of the man behind the project, Gen. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt). Warning Banner to stay away from Betty, his daughter, Banner heads out. When he realizes Ross wants what is inside to use as a weapon, he leaves.We learn all of this from the credits as the story unfolds with no dialogue. We end in Brazil with Banner working in a soft drink bottling plant and messaging back and forth with a ""Mr.Blue"" as he continues to search for a cure. But Gen. Ross gets a lead on him and sends in the troops to capture him, led by Maj. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).Blonsky fails to capture Banner/The Hulk but is fascinated with what he saw. Demanding to be put in the loop, he eventually convinces Ross to use him as a guinea pig in a process that may result in a soldier with the power to take down the Hulk.After Banner reunites with Betty, Ross finds him and a clash is at hand. Cornered, Banner turns once move into the Hulk on a small Virginia college campus. With soldiers and a ton of firepower behind them as well as the now enhanced Blonsky, the Hulk takes to the battlefield. It is only when he fears for Betty's safety that he finds the strength to turn the tide, running off with Betty in hand.Now an accomplice to Banner's attempt to find a cure, Betty aids him in an attempt to unite with Mr. Blue to find the cure. At the same time, Blonsky finds himself altering even more. When he gets Mr. Blue to provide the same sort of radiation that Banner suffered, he becomes the Abomination, a nearly unstoppable creature that perhaps only the Hulk can stop.The film moves back and forth on three levels. The first and most obvious is the monster whose rampages leave in their wake a ton of destruction. The second is the unrequited love story between Banner and Betty. And the last is the story of a man literally possessed who seeks release.The acting in this film is fantastic as two dimensional characters are given life on screen. Norton not only looks the part but turns in a performance that ranges from rage to pathos, at times showing an almost unbearable sadness in little more than a look. Tyler does a great job as well, offering a love interest that cares deeply about the man she loves. Hurt and Roth both do a commendable job as well, but leave their characters in their two dimensional forms offering little more.The CGI used to simulate the Hulk is top of the line. It is like a seamless painting where the entire landscape is laid before your eyes. You will believe that this creature exists.

Daneker,"[2, 3]","I never had issues with Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" besides some minor ones with the silly dad-made-him story and the goofy looking flashbacks that seem to belong in an Oliver Stone film. More-or-less though, I liked it.The one problem, no sequel. After all, the point of the ""origin"" film is to set up at least two sequels, so you accept the slow pacing and the emphasis on how and why knowing that the set-up will pay off in the second film. But, what if there's not a second film?Now the ""Hulk"" is ""Incredible"" and they're correct, I don't quite believe it. I've read that Norton envisioned a longer, more emotionally complex film and the studios, in typical studio fashion, slashed and burned it. So what is left?While the new Hulk still looks a little too waxy on the skin to be alive (why is it only George Lucas can make completely CGI characters that truly blend?) his emotions come through better thanks to Norton acting out all the scenes for the animators (including a new, hi-def 3-D motion capture for facial expressions) and the result is a more engrossing Hulk character. Unfortunately he has little to do.The film is a simple, long chase. The only twist is that the person doing the chasing is an aging commando who wants a ""gamma"" induced boost, which he eventually OD's on and becomes a monster. The result is the obligatory clash of the titans, a destroyed NY city and a finale, almost. The films doesn't want to explain or tie up anything and that's a problem. Once again, there's no end, and no planed sequel.The film shows a third possible mutation / nemesis for Hulk, but only for a second and never returns. Meanwhile the big, bad second hulk monster is not killed, and doesn't return to human form, and is simply unconscious when last we see it. So the movie is supposed to be about Bruce Banner finding a cure, he doesn't and the Hulk defeating the bad guy, he doesn't, and a love story, unresolved, and a chase thriller, that stops chasing, then stalls.The movie lacked the depth needed to carry such an open ending, and with no sequel in site (the movie made scarcely more than Ang Lees but was far more expensive) all that's left is a second origin film and no end in site.",3,"Just an action vehicle, there's no meat on this Hulk",1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,2191,"['never', 'had', 'issues', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', 'minor', 'ones', 'silly', 'dad-made-him', 'story', 'goofy', 'looking', 'flashbacks', 'seem', 'belong', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'More-or-less', 'liked', 'it.The', 'one', 'problem', 'sequel', 'point', 'origin', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'least', 'two', 'sequels', 'accept', 'slow', 'pacing', 'emphasis', 'how', 'why', 'knowing', 'set-up', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'second', 'film', 'what', 'not', 'second', 'film', 'Now', 'Hulk', 'Incredible', ""'re"", 'correct', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Norton', 'envisioned', 'longer', 'more', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'film', 'studios', 'typical', 'studio', 'fashion', 'slashed', 'burned', 'what', 'left', 'new', 'Hulk', 'still', 'little', 'too', 'waxy', 'skin', 'be', 'alive', 'why', 'only', 'George', 'Lucas', 'can', 'make', 'completely', 'CGI', 'characters', 'truly', 'blend', 'emotions', 'come', 'better', 'thanks', 'Norton', 'acting', 'out', 'scenes', 'animators', 'including', 'new', 'hi-def', '3-D', 'motion', 'capture', 'facial', 'expressions', 'result', 'more', 'engrossing', 'Hulk', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'little', 'do.The', 'film', 'simple', 'long', 'chase', 'only', 'twist', 'person', 'doing', 'chasing', 'aging', 'commando', 'who', 'gamma', 'induced', 'boost', 'eventually', 'OD', 'monster', 'result', 'obligatory', 'clash', 'titans', 'destroyed', 'NY', 'city', 'finale', 'almost', 'films', ""n't"", 'want', 'explain', 'tie', 'up', 'anything', 'problem', 'Once', 'again', 'end', 'planed', 'sequel.The', 'film', 'third', 'possible', 'mutation', '/', 'nemesis', 'Hulk', 'only', 'second', 'never', 'returns', 'Meanwhile', 'big', 'bad', 'second', 'hulk', 'monster', 'not', 'killed', ""n't"", 'return', 'human', 'form', 'simply', 'unconscious', 'when', 'last', 'see', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'finding', 'cure', ""n't"", 'Hulk', 'defeating', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'love', 'story', 'unresolved', 'chase', 'thriller', 'chasing', 'then', 'stalls.The', 'movie', 'lacked', 'depth', 'needed', 'carry', 'open', 'ending', 'sequel', 'site', 'movie', 'made', 'scarcely', 'more', 'Ang', 'Lees', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'expensive', 'left', 'second', 'origin', 'film', 'end', 'site']",N/A

Let's face it, you're watching a cartoon when you watch CGI.  And the CGI in TIH is hit-and-miss.  The premise is fairly straightforward -- Bruce Banner strives to elude authorities while searching for a cure to his condition.  It's the same theme used in the TV series of the same name starring Bill Bixby.  I didn't think Norton and Tyler were as good in roles of Banner and Betty Ross as Bana and Connelly -- and Sam Elliot was definitely superior to William Hurt as General Ross.  And then there's Tim Roth.  I enjoyed him as Thade in Tim Burton's revisioning of Planet of the Apes, but his performance and appearance in this movie really annoyed me.  As a former member of the military, it grates on me when the military is portrayed in an unrealistic manner.  Roth walking around in a military dress uniform, him unshaven and his hair hanging over his ears?  I don't think so -- not to mention his constant swagger when he walked leading me to wonder if he wasn't a bit drunk.  His performance crosses the line between tough-guy and buffoon (or at least camp).The action was enjoyable, if a bit over the top.  The aforementioned storyline was only adequately conveyed.

1180737,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B001DHXT1G,Mel Odom,"[5, 6]","After seeing Ang Lee's version of the Incredible Hulk a few years ago, I was dead-set against seeing the new release.  Just didn't need the aggravation.  But two things changed my mind.  IRON MAN and Robert Downey Jr. just blew me away, and my ten year old developed a raging interest in the Hulk while at a recent science fiction convention.So bright and early this morning, after reconstructive nasal surgery yesterday, I took my wife and son to see the movie at 10:30.  I'd stayed away from any reviews because I wanted to see the film cold and walk away with my own opinion.  I figured being post-op would allow me to be numbed if the movie stunk.Instead, I got a trip back to my childhood, and a chance to introduce my son to the television Hulk I grew up with (not exactly the Marvel Comics, but close).  The second film has evidently completely done away with the previous film and leapfrogged from the television series that starred Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.  While the title shots rolled, so did a similar short backstory that echoed everything that the television series had perpetrated during the creation of the Hulk.Interestingly enough, the serum that changed Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) into the Hulk was part of the same Super Soldier project that created Captain America back in World War II, though General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt in a great supporting role) didn't mention Cap by name.  However, that link was one more linchpin tying the Marvel/Hollywood universe together.  The cameo with Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark was another one.  There are also references to SHIELD although Nick Fury was conspicuously absent.After the opening credits finished and the backstory was in place, the movie jumped right into Bruce Banner's life just as it would have in one of those television episodes.  The backdrop of Brazil was amazingly beautiful, and watching Banner trying to learn the language and co-exist with the culture while maintaining his isolation was great.  The premise of a man on the run isn't a new one, but it's really well rendered in this movie.  I felt immediately for Banner's plight.The story seemed to move slowly at first.  I have to admit, I had a Hulk jones.  Probably most filmgoers did.  My ten year old took it in stride, though his patience was waning at the end.  We wanted the Hulk, we wanted, ""Hulk smash!"" echoing in our ears.The first taste we got of it only left us wanting more.  The fight scenes were occluded by the shadows and the darkness of the factory, but the choreography was pretty well done.  I was almost frustrated, but I knew it was early in the movie.  The monster remained just out of sight.Tim Roth plays Emil Blonsky/the Abomination and does a really good job though the role is somewhat truncated by needing to fit the film into a two-hour delivery.  The bits between Ross and Blonsky, where Blonsky basically sells his soul to the general in exchange for power, are well done.  Ross is a complicated character, and Hurt portrayed both sides of the man fairly.Liv Tyler was terrific as Bruce's love, Betty Ross.  She's intelligent, emotional, and - next to the Hulk - incredibly fragile.  The scenes she shared with the monster (especially since we know they were computer-generated and nothing was really there for her to act with) were fantastic.  I loved the scene with her and the Hulk in the cave, especially when the lightning and thunder arced across the night and scared him into growling back at it and throwing a boulder.I also enjoyed the fact that Banner wasn't reduced to simply being a geeky wimp.  He learned to fight, adding martial arts to his doctoral degrees, and handled himself well until he was outmatched.  This was the same kind of intelligent, resourceful Banner we got in the comics and in the television show.  Man and monster were both given time on the stage, and both worked well.Of course, the movie wouldn't be a Marvel movie without a Stan Lee cameo, and it was there.  I didn't expect it the way it was shown, but it was funny.  However, what would have happened to him if he drank a soda containing some of Banner's gamma-spiked blood?The movie paces itself well throughout, and doesn't quite become a scream-fest of action till the end.  The section where Banner meets Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), a confidant he's been doing research with on the gamma radiation, is quite unexpectedly humorous.  It doesn't last long, but Sterns's obvious fanboy appreciation of the monster before him plays well.Looking at all the numerous crumbs seeded throughout the movie, I knew that Marvel hopes this will only be the start of a brand-new Hulk franchise.  Betty is dating a psychologist named Leonard Samson (Doc Samson in the comic series) and Sterns is said to be set up to become the Leader (another gamma-radiation spawned opponent for the Hulk).I had a good time with the movie.  It wasn't IRON MAN but I enjoyed it a lot.  The Hulk is a difficult character to deal with, and I think this approach was probably the best way to take it at this time.  I was really thankful we weren't marched through another origin story so soon after the last movie.  This way we got Hulk action nearer the beginning.Go see the movie and enjoy.",5,Nostalgia and Great Fun,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,5241,"['seeing', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'version', 'Incredible', 'Hulk',

Thelead character is played by Edward Norton in the role of Bruce Banner.He is exposed to gamma radiation which in turn creates the Hulk when he is angered. He is pursued by General Ross who wants to create a super soldier in the mold of the Hulk. His daughter is the love of Banner's life. Banner escapes from South America and returns to America to see Betty Ross. He is again pursued by General Ross. There is nonstop actionof the Hulk doing battle with the Army soldiers. General Ross has a majorplayed by Emil Blonsky. The major wants to be a monster like the Hulk. Heis finally able to do this. He is horrible and mean. He and the Hulk havea battle to the death.

The whole movie basically is the last 20 minutes of the film and we are left with the front of it having Banner in a wild goose chase all over Southern America! Such a waste. I could have written such a more explosive story from beginning to end on just one of the thousands of great comic book episodes from Stan Lee who looks so pitiful in all his cameos in his franchises films. How dare he OK this BS. The same goes for Lou Ferrigno who is always a petty security guard. They should have let him have so much more dialogue as the voice of The Hulk ala ""Puny Humans! Hulk Smash!!"" and so much more. The Hulk is such a wimp in this and the only thing they actually got right was ""The Abomination"" character which like I said doesn't rear his head until the final 20 minutes. No matter how strong they made him The Hulk should have taken him to school in strength, anger and sheer aggression(The madder he gets the stronger he gets!) but instead we see him hesitant, passive and unsure in times where it is most valid for him to lose control. I liked how lean they made him this time around but I think he should have been way more muscular and a little taller(if he was 10ft they should have made him 12 just like The Abomination).One of the only things that I liked about what he did while being Hulk was when he came up with the idea to split the police car in two and used them as boxing gloves to whoop on The Abomination.

An accident at the factory where he works alerts General Ross (Hurt) to Banner's location, and he sends a team led by Emil Blonsky (Roth) to capture him.  He is able to elude the team by turning into the Hulk, and heads back to America to retrieve data from his accident that his ex-girlfriend Betty Ross (Tyler) has.  Meanwhile, General Ross has Blonsky injected with a super soldier serum to help him capture Banner, not counting on Blonsky being somewhat unstable.Unlike many, I was a fan of Ang Lee's ""Hulk"".  ""The Incredible Hulk"" reboots the franchise and takes a more action oriented approach that will satisfy most fanboys out there.  This film works in different ways than its predecessor, and brings us all one step closer to an eventual ""Avengers"" movie.  Norton is adequate as Banner, but his acting skill is somewhat lost on the part.  No one wants to see Banner onscreen, only the Hulk.  Tyler is forgettable as Betty, and there is minimal chemistry with Norton.  Hurt and Roth are both excellent in their roles as well as Tim Blake Nelson as the mysterious ""Mr. Blue"".  Nods to the TV show are there in appearances by Lou Ferrigno and even Bill Bixby.  The effects are good, but not great.  Overall, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is worth seeing, and enjoyable.  It does not reach the lever of ""Iron Man"" earlier this year, but is a solid entry into the Marvel lineup.

Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[1, 2]","If you enjoy a wonderful sequel to a classic movie and TV show, you will enjoy this the latest installment of the Incredible Hulk. There are a few changes in this latest movie...Liv Tyler now plays the love interest; William Hurt plays the General; and Edward Norton now plays the tortured Dr. Bruce Banner. There is the same old theme of a tormented Dr. Banner trying to cure himself (i.e., by using calming techniques taught to him and by sending data to a professor at the University) while trying to elude his nemesis General Ross (who is still trying to capture and control the Hulk), and rekindling a romance with Betty (Ross' daughter). The new additions to the story is the angry, power hungry soldier, Emil Blonsky who Ross' is willing to experiment on to insure that he has someone who can rival the Hulk. Blonsky doesn't mind being experimented on if it means that he will have super strength. He feels the power already.While there are some cheesy moments (cameos of both a deceased Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, not to mention the creator of Marvel Comics), over all I think this movie was extremely enjoyable, and I think Norton ended up being a decent Hulk. He definitely looks and acts tortured. And the lesson is clear, you can continue to fight the rage inside you or you can learn to control and use it. But more importantly, the movie sets the tone for future Hulk movies and future storylines...the Doctor helping Banner I think could be the Doctor with the large cranium from the comic books/cartoons, not to mention Banner's continued search for a cure.

1180750,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B001DHXT1G,Mike S.,"[1, 2]","Ang Lee's version of The Hulk is pretty widely panned, and mostly for good reason.  I think that Eric Bana and Jennifer Connely were the only things that movie had going for it.  This, thankfully pretended that version never existed.  The purpose was twofold.  The big one was to help set up the Avengers movie, and secondly to bring a movie version that paid homage to the series and the comic.  There was the requisite Lou Ferrigno cameo, and a posthumous cameo of Bill Bixby via a clip played on TV.I think Norton did a great job as Bruce Banner here.  It is unfortunate that he was replaced (although I do think Mark Ruffalo did a fine job as Banner in the Avengers), although if the rumors of Norton being difficult when it came to making this film are true I can see why he was.  Norton did a great job portraying the conflicted nature of Banner, the frustration and the fear that the character feels.  I also think he has fairly good chemistry with Liv Tyler who played Betty Ross, which was necessary given the role her character played in the story.  The movie does set up a possibility of a sequel, but obviously Marvel has put higher stock in the Iron Man, Captain America and Thor franchises. Whether a sequel to this movie ever gets made, and if so whether it continues the story started here remains to be seen.I think the CGI Hulk is far better in this movie than it was in the Ang Lee version.  I think it was one of the things that detracted from that version of the movie, but the technological advancements in CGI have come a long way, and while the Hulk does not look totally realistic, it looked a lot better.  Ferrigno has gone on record saying he thinks that Hulk should be played by a real person, but given that he is supposed to be 9 feet tall, that is just not practical.  If you notice in the film while Ferrigno is substantially bigger than Norton, he is not that much taller.  And they would have had to go back to the tricks used to film the series like cut aways and filming Ferrigno from below to make him look taller.  A CGI Hulk just works better.  Especially for the battle scenes.  There is just really no way they could have done any of the battles (especially the end battle with Abomination) without the CGI.The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.  The special features consist of some behind the scenes material, making of documentaries, deleted scenes and trailers.  In all, if you are a fan of the Marvel series of movies, while not as strong as the first Iron Man or Avengers, it is on par with the others, and definitely worth adding to your collection.",4,Closer to the roots of the TV series,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2603,"['Ang', 'Lee', 'version', 'Hulk', 'pretty', 'widely', 'panned', 'mostly', 'good', 'reason', 'think', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Jennifer', 'Connely', 'were', 'only', 'things', 'movie', 'had', 'going', 'thankfully', 'pretended', 'version', 'never', 'existed', 'purpose', 'was', 'twofold', 'big', 'one', 'was', 'help', 'set', 'up', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'secondly', 'bring', 'movie', 'version', 'paid', 'homage', 'series', 'comic', 'was', 'requisite', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'cameo', 'posthumous', 'cameo', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'clip', 'played', 'TV.I', 'think', 'Norton', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'here', 'unfortunate', 'was', 'replaced', 'do', 'think', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Banner', 'Avengers', 'rumors', 'Norton', 'being', 'difficult', 'when', 'came', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'true', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'Norton', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'conflicted', 'nature', 'Banner', 'frustration', 'fear', 'character', 'feels', 'also', 'think', 'fairly', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'who', 'played', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'was', 'necessary', 'given', 'role', 'character', 'played', 'story', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'possibility', 'sequel', 'obviously', 'Marvel', 'put', 'higher', 'stock', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Captain', 'America', 'Thor', 'franchises', 'sequel', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'so', 'story', 'started', 'here', 'be', 'seen.I', 'think', 'CGI', 'Hulk', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'version', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'things', 'detracted', 'version', 'movie', 'technological', 'advancements', 'CGI', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Hulk', 'not', 'look', 'totally', 'realistic', 'looked', 'lot', 'better', 'Ferrigno', 'gone', 'record', 'saying', 'Hulk', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'real', 'person', 'given', 'supposed', 'be', '9', 'feet', 'tall', 'just', 'not', 'practical', 'notice', 'film', 'Ferrigno', 'substantially', 'bigger', 'Norton', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'taller', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'tricks', 'used', 'film', 'series', 'cut', 'aways', 'filming', 'Ferrigno', 'make', 'look', 'taller', 'CGI', 'Hulk', 'just', 'better', 'Especially', 'battle', 'scenes', 'just', 'really', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'battles', 'especially', 'end', 'battle', 'Abomination', 'CGI.The', 'movie', 'looks', 'great', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'special', 'features', 'consist', 'scenes', 'material', 'making', 'documentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'are', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'series', 'movies', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Avengers', 'par', 'others', 'definitely', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",N/A

This one is different.  Edward Norton is convincing as Dr. Bruce Banner, and Liv Tyler does a good job with her role too.  William Hurt looks the part as the General, and Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee make brief but satisfying cameo apperances.  I also liked the computer animation, which always seemed real.  This movie had more suspense than the last one, and a better storyline I think.  You get a good idea of Bruce's inner struggle and there are several places where it becomes apparent.  A good deal of the movie involves his laying low and trying to escape, but when he is the Hulk, he doesn't have to run anywhere.  There are many ultra cool moments in this film.  Any action movie lover or comic book hero aficionado should see it.

Dr. Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) exposed himself to gamma radiation while working on a medical research project for General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), who, unbeknownst to Banner, intended the research to create an enhanced soldier. When the experiment turns Banner into an enraged green Hulk, he is forced to flee Gen. Ross, who wants to dissect the beast and propagate its enhanced physique. Having eluded capture for five years, Banner is compelled to return to the U.S. to retrieve data from his old love and research partner Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). He has been communicating with a scientist calling himself Dr. Blue who may be able to use the data to cure Banner's condition.Be sure to watch this backstory play out over the opening credits. This is an economical way for director Louis Leterrier to set the movie up, but audiences could miss it. This film is a well-conceived and relevant adaptation of the Hulk comic from screenwriter Zak Penn. Like ""The Incredible Hulk"" television series of 1978-82, it emphasizes Bruce Banner's fugitive status and his constant battle to control his emotions. Edward Norton makes a good nerdy scientist who is, nonetheless, determined and resourceful. The audience really feels for his predicament, which is the film's great achievement. And, for most of its duration, Banner acts like a person would really act in his situation, lending credibility to a story that obviously stretches it. Liv Tyler is a little to breathy to be a cell biologist, but she plays well with Norton and Hurt.I found this Hulk, who is voiced by none other than Lou Ferrigno, more affecting that the cartoonish version in the 2003 film, but still not entirely lifelike. Ferrigno and Hulk co-creator Stan Lee also make brief appearances in the film. The final confrontation between the Hulk and the Abomination runs too long, but ""The Incredible Hulk""  shows promise as a new franchise. I look forward to the next episode. It's a good cast, and the themes of a man struggling to control himself and another striving to bend nature to his will are compelling, thought the latter might have been more explicit.The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition contains 5 deleted scenes, 1 extended scene, and a feature commentary with director Louis Leterrier and actor Tim Roth, who plays Emil Bronsky, a soldier employed by General Ross to capture Bruce Banner. It is a conversational but constant scene-by-scene commentary, sometimes with Roth acting as an interviewer. They share their recollections of filming, and Leterrier comments on locations, supporting cast, his intentions with each scene, and what he added that was unscripted. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French.

While I was not completely disappointed, I wasn't completely satisfied either. The story blows through the origin while the opening credits are on screen. I guess this was a good idea, as it will allow some of us not to completely write off the first Hulk film! I liked the first film to a point, but it was very far from the perfect incarnation I hoped for! The only problem with not spending more time with the origin is the filmmakers lose the opportunity to show the drama of the creature being born!....This was handled well in the first movie and it was one of it's strongest scenes.So, blowing past the origin we find Dr. Banner discovering ways not get excited or ""Hulk Out""!. With on screen data of the last time he had a ""Hulk' incident, Banner is far from home and the many people who want his power for evil. Ed Norton does a fine job as Banner and this is so important to these films! The need for a gifted captivating star to fill the screen when there is no action! Toby Maguire, Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr. have proven this!....along with great scripts and direction! Ed Norton and Liv Tyler have good chemistry and the tragic predicament they're in is heartfelt.The Hulk action looks awesome and the CGI works well. Although I didn't have a problem with the CGI in the first film except for the Hulk growing to ridiculous proportions! The Hulk doesn't do any 3 mile jumps in this film, but we do see some new signature moves missed in the last installment....I won't spoil them for any of you!......they are cool as........... H E L L !Over all this film is better than the first film, but I will consider this 'The Hulk 2' in my book. You would think not having the origin to take up screen time, they would be able to tell a thorough story, but the film seems to have a lot going on and time seems to be running out! I don't think the franchise has peaked yet and there is 'still' a great Hulk film to be made... now that they have started to repair the series, I hope they make a third installment, that can take the time to have a little fun with the character. Instead of the third film in a series being the worst all the time, it might be the best for a change!

Parker ""Hallowscorp""","[5, 5]","Although Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" was interesting from a creative standpoint, summer movie goers were not prepared to watch a convoluted psychodrama about repressed emotions playing out amid visual meditations on microcosm and macrocosm. Hulk's final confrontation is with his DAD?!? Transformed into a giant jellyfish made out of water?!? W.T.F.?!? Lee's film registered with audiences as an ambitious failure -ponderous and unwieldy.Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is an aggressive attempt to gather all Hulk fans under one tent pole, and is largely successful, providing a tightly paced story with big budget thrills while staying close to it's pulpy, heroic action/weird science monster roots.The opening credit montage serves as shameless retro homage to the 1970's TV show, a retelling of the origin story of the Hulk and re-establishment of the basic characters: Dr.Banner (Edward Norton), General Ross (William Hurt), Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and their conflicting relationships.When a military team led by Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) sent by General Ross catches up to Dr. Banner, the resulting chase though a Brazilian favela is reminiscent of something you would see in a Bourne movie with a bit of parkour thrown in for good measure - exciting, but not all that original.The first confrontation with the Hulk is set in a darkened factory and, while providing only teasing glimpses, gives a solid example of his destructive power when provoked. What Blonsky experiences in that confrontation plants the seed of his obsession with the Hulk - his desire for that kind of power leads him to undergo dangerous experiments in the pursuit of 'performance enhancement'.After Dr. Banner recovers from his Hulk-out, we get a sense of the toll each episode takes - that he has to rebuild his life each time. There's not a whole lot of character development for him, but Norton plays it with a quietly desperate intensity that works.Dr. Banner reconnects with Betty in his search for a cure and the old flames of romance are rekindled. Norton and Tyler have good chemistry in their scenes together. Tyler does a great job of conveying her character's deep connection to Dr. Banner and it doesn't hurt that she's easy on the eyes.The military closes in again, and Banner's second Hulk-out is the heart of the film. All of the character conflicts collide and the action delivers the goods. Leterrier creates images that are ripped out of the pages of the Hulk comics and breathes life into them on the screen. When the military hits hulk with some experimental sonic cannons, the result is pure weird science goodness!After Hulk/Banner and Betty get a little down time, Blonsky begins his transformation into the Abomination. This is what fans have been waiting for: a downtown super-brute smash-em-up! ""HULK SMASH!""All in all, this movie does a solid job of balancing character drama and big budget spectacle without really taking any risks.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[1, 1]","Ang Lee's 2003 take on the Hulk was an ambitious, but ultimately flawed, adaptation of the classic Marvel character that managed to somewhat capture the tragedy of the character, but proved supremely underwhelming in delivering the action goods.  With this reboot directed by Louis Letterrier (Transporter 2, Unleashed), the Hulk gets a fresh start, and it's all the better for it.  The Incredible Hulk stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, who has managed to evade capture by living in Brazil for the past few years, and keeping his monstrous alter-ego at bay as well.  A search for a possible cure brings Bruce out of hiding, as his nemesis General Ross (William Hurt) employs spook agent Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to bring Banner in, by any means necessary, even if it means turning Blonsky into some sort of Abomination (I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself).  With loads of odes to the comic and even more to the classic 70's series, The Incredible Hulk delivers in terms of action and excitement, and even manages to pull out some surprises as well.  The only real flaws of The Incredible Hulk are some plot-holes in the story and the mis-casting of a stale Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, but that aside, this film still makes up for the Ang Lee mis-fire.

1180787,AHF97M45JFCB,B001DHXT1G,ONENEO,"[1, 2]","Well, it certainly took me a while to get to this one and I think part of my reluctance stemmed from the 2003 film Hulk, which left me with mixed emotions.  The story was entirely too dry and drawn out for my tastes and what little screen time the title character received had more in common with video game graphics of the era then big-budget Hollywood feature films.  However, I did say mixed emotions on account of the fact that Eric Bana's interpretation of the Bruce Banner character was pretty solid and as poorly animated as they were, a few of Hulk's frenzies were the stuff of comic fan-boy dreams (traveling from town to town like a bouncing ball and tossing tanks as if they were a shot-put to mention a few).Enter The Incredible Hulk where five years of hiatus brought with them a new director, new script, and even a new leading male to pick up the torch as everyone's favorite ""green machine"".  It should be noted that to a majority of industry insiders, this film is not considered a direct sequel to the 2003 Hulk, but calling it an entirely independent tale isn't accurate either.  As such this work is what's commonly classified as a ""loose sequel"" and for the most part, succeeds in nearly every area where the original came up short.The film opens right where the former title left off with an apprehensive Banner trying to establish a new life for himself in South America after his last violent encounter with the military.  Working at a soda-bottling factory in Rocinha while searching for a cure for his condition, Banner is constantly at odds with his own biology as he practices calming techniques to control his heart rate with trained masters.Perhaps the coolest developed link-up in recent action-film history occurs when a drop of Banner's infected blood finds its way onto the glass of one of the soda bottles on the assembly line, ends up getting shipped to the States, finds its way into a Wisconsin resident's fridge, poisons the poor thirsty fool (played by none other than Stan Lee himself), and results in the government getting the trace on the scientist/ monster at-large.Without breaking down the plot too thoroughly (after all, why bother watching it if so), let's just say that the military wants what fuels Banner, Banner just wants to rid himself of the condition, Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross wants closure on her ex-boyfriend's condition, and rogue soldier Emil Blonsky feels like if given the chance, he could better-control the powers bestowed upon Banner.Where the 2003 film was a slightly misguided stab at drama, the 2008 picture is all action; bordering on the definition of a ""popcorn flick"".  As such the pacing is much more swift and efficient throughout with perhaps the longest non-action segment occurs right in the opening where Banner's attempt at a normal life in Brazil is established.  By the time Uncle Sam sends his goons down to retrieve the fugitive Banner, the viewer has passed the point of no return: hold on and enjoy the ride!Directed by Frenchman Louis Leterrier and written by Zack Penn opposed to Ang Lee and James Schamus respectively, the production team is only a part of the switch-ups Marvel Studious/ Universal Pictures implemented between Hulk and The Incredible Hulk.  Edward Norton replaces Eric Bana as Bruce Banner; Liv Tyler plays Betty Ross instead of Jennifer Connelly; and William Hurt takes over for Sam Elliott as General Thaddeus Ross.  And what would a Hulk film be without paying homage to the living legend Lou Ferrigno?  Lou delivers with both a cameo appearance as well as having provided the few spoken lines the Hulk delivers.Particularly noteworthy is the addition of a new villain intended to pose a more realistic threat to the Hulk than the military could possibly offer in the form of ""The Abomination"".  The presentation of this enemy is a bit reminiscent of the Gray Hulk Marvel comic story thread (only on the opposite side of the coin) and upon completing some research, it turns out that screenwriter James Schamus was indeed planning a sequel around the time the 2003 film was released that would indeed feature the Gray Hulk story arc.  However as time went on (and a new crew was assembled to do the film), Silver Age villain Abomination was recruited to provide the antihero moments with an updated look that subconsciously pays homage to the ""Baby"" alien design of Alien Resurrection.Perhaps my own crowning moment takes place at the conclusion of the film when Robert Downy Jr. appears as Tony Stark to assure a drunken General Ross that a new team of heroes was on the cusp of formation, of course hinting toward Marvel's next major motion picture: The Avengers set to release in 2012.  Additionally, and also appreciated by fans who have followed the comic's continuity, Samuel Sterns (played by Tim Blake Nelson) makes an appearance which sets up his eventual transformation from slightly mad scientist to green-skinned, large brained, massive skulled, super-intelligent villain, The Leader.In all it's easy to become thrilled with this project simply for the potential for future franchise efforts hinted toward throughout if not for the much-publicized improvements made over the 2003 picture.  And this coming from a reviewer who thought the 2003 film wasn't all that bad to start with.  While the computer generated imaging has drawn criticism by some fans once again, the truth of the matter is that this incarnation of the Hulk is truly ""larger than life"" as the character need be portrayed.  For the most part, it works, especially in the battle between Hulk and Abomination throughout the cityscape that comes off as a clash of titanic proportion more at home in the mythology of the ancient Greeks than on the pages of a comic book.  And in the end that's what makes for a solid comic to cinema translation as far as I'm concerned.",4,A Successful Follow-up Piece on Many Levels,1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,5853,"['Well',

If you felt that Ang Lee's The Hulk was like something out of a Danielle Steel novel and just want to see the comic book realized onto the big screen with lots of action upon action and are prepared to sacrifice character content for monsters throwing each other through buildings then The Incredible Hulk is exactly what you want.The Premise is quite simple and works as a sequel to Ang Lee's The Hulk even if it does change the story somewhat. Bruce Banner (Norton) finds himself in South America learning martial arts techniques to control rage while the military try to get him to convert his unique biology into a weapon and dose up a super solider to track him down only to find that the super solider has lost control and so they need The Hulk to save the day.

In comparing it to other movies of the superhero genre, we weren't blown away by it, but we had few complaints.  It was a fun stay-at-home date movie, and something we wanted to watch prior to seeing the new Avengers film.For us, personally, we would have liked to have seen the plot begin earlier in the Hulk's history -- to see how he became the Hulk.  The beginning credits do a fairly good job of catching the viewer up by showing newspaper headlines and short video clips that depict that story in brief, so someone who had really never seen a Hulk story before wouldn't be totally lost.  I think we're just used to the ""typical"" superhero movie spending more time on the creation story of each main character.  I could appreciate by the end of the film why the producers chose not to spend unnecessary time on that aspect -- so this particular episode could bring us farther along in the story without making the film unbearably long.  I guess it just felt more like a sequel to us.  If you watch it with that idea in mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed.The story line, acting, and special effects were all good.  Again, we really had no complaints.  Of course, it's not 100% believable, but I think that's to be expected with this type of film.  One watches a superhero movie to be entertained, not educated, and to see good triumph over evil.  The Incredible Hulk did not disappoint in any aspect of that formula.

The first one tried to be serious; this one just tries to be fun.  In my view, both have succeeded in what they set out to do.Bottom line: If you were disappointed by Lee's version, you'll probably like this one.

For five years, scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has kept hidden from the world while searching for a cure to his gamma-irradiated DNA that transforms him into an unbelievably strong creature known as the Hulk. Banner struggles to control the raging power within him and prevent the US Army from turning this power into a devastating living weapon. Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 1 & 2), ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a fast-paced action-packed adventure that succeeds over the previous 2003 film. The latest comic book adaptation offers plenty of excitement and well embraces the popular 1970's television series. The climatic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is really exciting. ""The Incredible Hulk"" also stars Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson and Academy Award-winner William Hurt, and features cameos by series star Lou Ferrigno and comic book creator Stan Lee.With its stunning picture quality and intense audio, ""The Incredible Hulk"" packs quite a punch on Blu-Ray. The 2008 comic book movie is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The Blu-Ray has a nicely detailed and remarkably sharp video transfer. Its 5.1 DTS-HD audio is really dynamic. The special features include 40 minutes of deleted scenes, a comic book picture gallery, alternate opening sequence and a feature-length audio commentary with director Louis Leterrier and star Tim Roth. ""The Making of The Incredible Hulk"" documentary offers several interviews with director, cast and production crew. It also includes four short behind-the-scenes featurettes: Becoming the Hulk, Becoming the Abomination, Anatomy of a Hulk Out and From Comic Book to Screen.

1180816,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B001DHXT1G,RJ Smoove,"[2, 2]","Just watched The Incredible Hulk again, for the umpteenth time, and I have to say. It seems to get better every time I watch it. I am a huge fan of the character, but Ang Lee's Hulk did not do him the justice he deserved, in my opinion. Besides the fact that it was kind of long and boring, I just felt like there wasn't anything of value in that movie to retain my interest. For this one, it really made me happy to see such a devoted team work to bring fans the movie they deserved. It also made me happy to see that it was more of a continuation of where Hulk (2003) left off in the South American jungle, rather than a standard reboot. Ed Norton is to this film, what Ryan Reynolds will be to the Deadpool spin-off. He actually cared about the character, and had previous knowledge of who Bruce Banner and the Hulk were. That is always better than an actor who has to play catch up before shooting begins. I love Ed Norton, so I hope he returns for a second, and makes an appearance in The Avengers. I know the studio had his script rewritten and pissed him off, but hopefully they will work all of that out. Another huge plus this movie had going for it was Tim Roth as the villain. He was fantastic in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And say what you want about Planet of the Apes, but he was very convincing as Thade. Another thing I really like about The Incredible Hulk is how tightly edited it is. The cinematography is beatiful, and the editors did a great job at cutting the scenes together. I wish there was a little more film for them to edit though. Nevertheless, it had a consistent flow in the pacing.There was a fair amount of breathtaking action. My favorite action set piece is on the college campus, but the final fight was sick as well. The narrative is definitely the star of this one. It brings joy to my heart that writers are taking comic book movies more serious. I never felt like the story was getting off track, or boring. There's alot of things that I love about this movie, but there are definitely a few flaws. The biggest flaw would have to be Liv Tyler's phoned in performance. Is it just me, or is she overrated? Her performance in The Lord of the Rings was pretty good, but how hard was that role? Another problem I had was that there was not enough character development for the Hulk, himself. Sure Bruce Banner was well developed, but what about the Hulk? In the comics and cartoons he held full conversations, but in the live action movies he can only utter two or three words. It gives viewers the false impression that he is all smash and scream, with no real thought process, except to protect Betty. I also felt that there wasn't enough variety. To me the movie went by too quickly. Is that a bad thing? I don't know, but I like this movie alot. Especially because the character is special to me. Of course this movie is no Iron Man or Spider-man, but it was a nice addition to my library of comic book films. In the mean time, I will keep impatiently waiting for the next installment. Even if the studio pissed Ed Norton off, I still hope he can get over that before a sequel for this movie becomes obsolete. Actually a sequel will never become obsolete because I love the Hulk.Now for the BD's transfer. The Incredible Hulk has a just about pristine transfer. The picture was fantastic, albeit minorly flawed. There were not enough issues with the PQ for me to dock the transfer any points. The audio is perfection. Loud, bombastic, and it just abuses the Home Theatre. You want to wake your neighbors? Put on the scene where we see Bruce change into the not-so-jolly green giant for the first time. When he lets out the bellowing roar, my windows rattled. There's nothing else I can say about it. It's pure demo material. The Incredible Hulk stands alone as the only Blu-ray available in both a green Elite case and lenticular slipcover. The packaging is all a geek can dream of. I love it. The extras are very well done. I enjoyed the featurettes, but I really wish the ""making of"" was longer. Hey, a half hour is better than some half-assed little interview right? Also, I was disappointed that Ed Norton didn't take the time to input his opinions in the otherwise engaging and entertaining audio commentary.7.5/10",4,The Jade Giant Gets His Due,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,4264,"['Just', 'watched', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'again', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'get', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'character', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'deserved', 'opinion', 'fact', 'was', 'kind', 'long', 'boring', 'just', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'value', 'movie', 'retain', 'interest', 'one', 'really', 'made', 'happy', 'see', 'such', 'devoted', 'team', 'work', 'bring', 'fans', 'movie', 'deserved', 'also', 'made', 'happy', 'see', 'was', 'more', 'continuation', 'where', 'Hulk', '2003', 'left', 'off', 'South', 'American', 'jungle', 'rather', 'standard', 'reboot', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'film', 'what', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'will', 'be', 'Deadpool', 'spin-off', 'actually', 'cared', 'character', 'had', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'who', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'were', 'always', 'better', 'actor', 'who', 'play', 'catch', 'up', 'shooting', 'begins', 'love', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'hope', 'second', 'appearance', 'Avengers', 'know', 'studio', 'had', 'script', 'rewritten', 'pissed', 'off', 'hopefully', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'huge', 'movie', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'villain', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'Thade', 'thing', 'really', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'how', 'tightly', 'edited', 'cinematography', 'beatiful', 'editors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'cutting', 'scenes', 'together', 'wish', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'edit', 'Nevertheless', 'had', 'consistent', 'flow', 'pacing.There', 'was', 'fair', 'amount', 'breathtaking', 'action', 'favorite', 'action', 'set', 'piece', 'college', 'campus', 'final', 'fight', 'was', 'sick', 'as', 'well', 'narrative', 'definitely', 'star', 'one', 'joy', 'heart', 'writers', 'are', 'taking', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'more', 'serious', 'never', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'getting', 'off', 'track', 'boring', 'alot', 'things', 'love', 'movie', 'are', 'definitely', 'few', 'flaws', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'phoned', 'performance', 'just', 'overrated', 'performance', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'role', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'Hulk', 'Sure', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'was', 'well', 'developed', 'what', 'Hulk', 'comics', 'cartoons', 'held', 'full', 'conversations', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'can', 'only', 'utter', 'two', 'three', 'words', 'viewers', 'false', 'impression', 'smash', 'scream', 'real', 'thought', 'process', 'protect', 'Betty', 'also', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'variety', 'movie', 'went', 'too', 'quickly', 'bad', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'like', 'movie', 'alot', 'Especially', 'character', 'special', 'course', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Spider-man', 'was', 'nice', 'addition', 'library', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'mean', 'time', 'will', 'keep', 'impatiently', 'waiting', 'next', 'installment', 'Even', 'studio', 'pissed', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'still', 'hope', 'can', 'get', 'over', 'sequel', 'movie', 'obsolete', 'Actually', 'sequel', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'obsolete', 'love', 'Hulk.Now', 'BD', 'transfer', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'just', 'pristine', 'transfer', 'picture', 'was', 'fantastic', 'minorly', 'flawed', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'issues', 'PQ', 'dock', 'transfer', 'points', 'audio', 'perfection', 'Loud', 'bombastic', 'just', 'Home', 'Theatre', 'want', 'wake', 'neighbors', 'Put', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'Bruce', 'change', 'not-so-jolly', 'green', 'giant', 'first', 'time', 'When', 'out', 'bellowing', 'roar', 'windows', 'rattled', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'pure', 'demo', 'material', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'alone', 'only', 'Blu-ray', 'available', 'green', 'Elite', 'case', 'lenticular', 'slipcover', 'packaging', 'geek', 'can', 'dream', 'love', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'enjoyed', 'featurettes', 'really', 'wish', 'making', 'was', 'longer', 'Hey', 'half', 'hour', 'better', 'half-assed', 'little', 'interview', 'right', 'Also', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'input', 'opinions', 'otherwise', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'audio', 'commentary.7.5/10']",N/A

1180820,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001DHXT1G,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","I was not as down on the 2003 Ang Lee version of the story of the big green guy (note:  as first drawn by Jack Kirby, he was gray, though he very quickly underwent a color change) as many, but it clearly wasn't as good as it ought to have been.  The biggest fault was the CGI.  Although according to the official Marvel specs the Hulk can leap several miles in a single bound, it was rather silly watching him do so.  For one thing, he would bounce several hundred yards in a single, impossibly quick leap.  As a result the Hulk appears to have no mass or even any reality.  You simply couldn't buy into the fantasy.  The Hulk in this film, on the contrary, possessed only a fraction of the leaping ability of the Ang Lee Hulk -- possessing vastly less mobility than the comic book version as well -- but the gains were enormous, with the new Hulk having mass, solidity, and some reality.  Some of this could be laid on the development of new CGI software since 2003, but more than that was simply the decision to make him denser and slower.  When the 2003 Hulk moved I cringed; when the new one moved I had a great time.By all accounts Edward Norton was deeply involved in the making of the movie, and not merely as the star.  Though he did not receive official writing credit, enough people working on the project have acknowledged that he wrote a complete draft that featured many elements that were incorporated in the final film and that he was rewriting scenes immediately before shooting.  This is not new for Norton.  He has been involved in the writing of the scripts for many of his films, usually with no credit.  It is expected that he will write the draft for any Hulk sequel.Sequels.  Although THE INCREDIBLE HULK did not do as well at the box office this summer as they had hoped, the film did make money.  Part of the disappointment might have resulted from the far superior box office performance of IRON MAN.  One of the executive producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK has insisted that she plans on making a sequel with Norton at the center of things.  And with Marvel Studios clearly moving towards an Avengers movie, the Hulk would clearly play a role.  The Hulk, however, is one Avenger who can either be friend or foe, either a member of the team or the Big Bad of the movie.  There have been no official announcements as of yet, but the final scene in the film, showing Tony Stark approaching a very drunk General Ross in a bar and telling him, ""We are putting together a team,"" shows that the team is being put together.  General Ross had a portrait of Steve Rodgers (i.e., Captain America) on his office wall and a cut scene from THE INCREDIBLE HULK showed a glimpse of Captain America in frozen ice.  Upcoming films focusing on Thor and (believe it or not) Ant-Man show that Marvel does indeed intend to put the whole team together as soon as feasible.  I think it is going to take a bit longer than they had hoped.  Films that were earlier announced for 2010 and 2011 are still in pre-production.  I think 2012 and 2013 is more likely.  They have also been set back by casting problems.  Daniel Craig turned down an offer to star as Thor.  At least the news shows their intent to continue to cast major actors in the key roles.THE INCREDIBLE HULK begins in medias res, giving a bit of a recap of a prequel that never quite existed (the events recounted are not quite the same as the Ang Lee film) in the opening credits to jump to Bruce Banner in Rio de Janeiro, where he is living while working on a cure to his condition.  I think this was a brilliant decision.  As a result they could just go ahead and skip the ""making of the Hulk"" story that is a crucial part of almost all superhero movies.  One of my beefs with most of movies of the genre is that we don't really get anything new for fans of the comics.  IRON MAN was redeemed by a fantastic lead performance by Robert Downey Jr.  I'm not saying that Edward Norton wasn't good in this film, but a lot of the joy of the film is that we got to move the whole story forward.  I liked the decision to focus on the Abomination, though they altered him a bit from his classic presentation, making him larger than the Hulk, whereas in the official Marvel spec sheet he is slightly smaller.  Tim Roth is great in the film as Klonsky/The Abomination.  And just as in the comics the Hulk does not kill him, but is locked away by the military, so in this film he resists, at Betty's pleading, the temptation to kill him.This later detail actually points to how much the film goes out of the way to acknowledge both the larger world of Marvel Comics and its prior versions of the Hulk.  In the earlier category are things like references to Nick Fury in the opening credits and the portrait of Steve Rodgers, but also the slightly bulging head of Dr. Sterns near the end of the film (foreshadowing his possible appearance in a sequel as The Leader).  In the latter we get things like Bruce Banner watching THE COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER in Portugese in Brazil, which starred, of course, Bill Bixby, who played David Banner in the TV version of The Hulk.  Lou Ferrigno, who played Banner when he turned green, played a security guard (and I have to say, was looking pretty good) and voiced the Hulk.  And Toronto actor Paul Soles, who plays the pizza joint owner Sandy, voiced Bruce Banner in the sixties cartoon version of the comic (he also did Peter Parker in the cartoon version of Spider-Man).I think the superiority of this new film could mainly be seen in the great fight scene from the end of the picture in which the Hulk and the Abomination face off.  Most such fight scenes in movies are either disappointing or anti-climatic, sometimes merely a necessary add on.  But this one was exciting, involving, and helped move along the story of Bruce Banner's transformation as something more than just an enraged monster.This is not as good as IRON MAN, but it was the second of two very good films that represent the initial products of Marvel's new film production company.  If forthcoming productions are as good as these two, then we have a lot of great popular entertainment to look forward to.",5,A huge improvement over the 2003 film,1224979200,"10 26,

1180823,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001DHXT1G,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 7]","Louis Leterrier's ""The Incredible Hulk"" dispenses with all the how-Dr.-Bruce-Banner-became-a-hulking-monster stuff in the opening credits (the result of gamma ray poisoning from an experiment that went terribly awry, for those who don`t already know), thereby making the film more of a sequel to the Ang Lee version from 2003 than a remake of it (even though all the parts are played by different actors).  Though far from perfect, that earlier ""Hulk"" was, I believe, unfairly pilloried for being just a tad too brooding and a trifle too thoughtful for a mind-numbing, feel-good summertime blockbuster (it WAS an Ang Lee film, after all).  Well, most of that ""problem"" has been eliminated in this new version, which has streamlined its story into a virtual nonstop orgy of chase sequences, exploding vehicles and general CGI mayhem.  The good news, though, is that ""The Incredible Hulk"" boasts the highly gifted Edward Norton as Bruce, who gives the film a human heart anyway.For the most part, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is one big long chase story interrupted by occasional romantic interludes between Bruce and his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Live Tyler), the fellow scientist who accidentally helped to make Bruce the man/monster hybrid he is today.  Bruce's main nemesis is Betty's father, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), the military officer who wants to capture the young man - who has spent the last several years in hiding, futilely searching for a cure - so that he can replicate the experiment and turn out a veritable army of indestructible incredible hulks.Norton and Tyler make a fine romantic pair, and Tim Roth does his usual superlative job as the villainous (are there any other kind?) former KGB agent who wants to be first in line to volunteer to be ""hulked.""  The filmmakers, moreover, manage to fork over a little screen time to Lou Ferrigno in a cameo appearance (he also provides the voice for the Hulk) and even the late Bill Bixby who shows up in a brief clip from TV`s ""The Courtship of Eddie`s Father.""The controversy over which of the two ""Hulk"" films is better (i.e. more faithful to the spirit of the original) is sure to rage on for years to come.  I have no real desire to either enter the fray or belabor the point (I like them both about equally), but let me just say that this latest ""Hulk"" is really all about the action and, for the most part, it delivers on that level.  But thanks to Norton and Tyler, like the Lee version, it has some much-needed soul as well.",3,big and loud but with a certain amount of heart,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,2505,"['Louis', 'Leterrier', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'how-Dr.-Bruce-Banner-became-a-hulking-monster', 'stuff', 'opening', 'credits', 'result', 'gamma', 'ray', 'poisoning', 'experiment', 'went', 'terribly', 'awry', 'who', 'don', 't', 'already', 'know', 'thereby', 'making', 'film', 'more', 'sequel', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'version', '2003', 'remake', 'even', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'different', 'actors', 'far', 'perfect', 'earlier', 'Hulk', 'was', 'believe', 'unfairly', 'pilloried', 'being', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'brooding', 'trifle', 'too', 'thoughtful', 'mind-numbing', 'feel-good', 'summertime', 'blockbuster', 'WAS', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'Well', 'most', 'problem', 'been', 'eliminated', 'new', 'version', 'streamlined', 'story', 'virtual', 'nonstop', 'orgy', 'chase', 'sequences', 'exploding', 'vehicles', 'general', 'CGI', 'mayhem', 'good', 'news', 'though', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'highly', 'gifted', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Bruce', 'who', 'film', 'human', 'heart', 'most', 'part', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'one', 'big', 'long', 'chase', 'story', 'interrupted', 'occasional', 'romantic', 'interludes', 'Bruce', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Live', 'Tyler', 'fellow', 'scientist', 'who', 'accidentally', 'helped', 'make', 'Bruce', 'man/monster', 'hybrid', 'today', 'Bruce', 'main', 'nemesis', 'Betty', 'father', 'General', 'Thaddeus', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'military', 'officer', 'who', 'capture', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'hiding', 'futilely', 'searching', 'cure', 'so', 'can', 'replicate', 'experiment', 'turn', 'out', 'veritable', 'army', 'indestructible', 'incredible', 'hulks.Norton', 'Tyler', 'make', 'fine', 'romantic', 'pair', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'usual', 'superlative', 'job', 'villainous', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'kind', 'former', 'KGB', 'agent', 'who', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'volunteer', 'be', 'hulked', 'filmmakers', 'moreover', 'manage', 'fork', 'over', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'also', 'voice', 'Hulk', 'even', 'late', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'who', 'up', 'brief', 'clip', 'TV', 's', 'Courtship', 'Eddie', 's', 'Father', 'controversy', 'two', 'Hulk', 'films', 'better', 'i.e', 'more', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'original', 'sure', 'rage', 'years', 'come', 'have', 'real', 'desire', 'enter', 'fray', 'belabor', 'point', 'like', 'equally', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'latest', 'Hulk', 'really', 'action', 'most', 'part', 'level', 'thanks', 'Norton', 'Tyler', 'Lee', 'version', 'much-needed', 'soul', 'well']",N/A

I do not intend to get into many details of the film as other reviewers have already done so, the franchise reboot was indeed of great help, the cast and their performances are simply incredible and very serious for a film of this kind. What made this Hulk movie better than the previous one is the fact that the people behind it are trying to set the Marvel universe in a real-world scenario, with great results. Add the factor of Marvel being involved, the special cameo by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), several references to the ""super-soldier"" and the imminent coming of an ""Avengers"" film and even non-fans will want more!The picture and audio quality in the BD are superb, while the movie does not have too many sequences that could take advantage of the format (such as ""Speed Racer"" by the Wachowski brothers) the fight sequences look and sound clean and sharp. The level of detail high definition brings is very notorious in this BD as the deleted scenes included are presented in standard definition, so after watching a HD film presentation and going to the extras to watch the material not included the difference in quality is huge (Not sure really why the deleted scenes were not presented in HD though)The ExtrasAll extras except the deleted scenes are presented in full HD.The famous alternate opening sequence is included, Leterrier was known of being very fond of this sequence that was removed in the end. The digital effects in this sequence however, were not finished for this release, so the little bit we see of the Hulk is a rough CG shot.An animated comic in which they based one of the sequences of the film is also included, for me, watching a comic book drawn by Tim Sale animated in HD was a very interesting experience being a fan of him. As a reference and if you are not familiar with his work, he also draws all the paintings used in the TV show ""Heroes"".Documentaries included are ""Making of the Incredible"", ""Becoming the Hulk"", ""Becoming the Abomination"" and ""Anatomy of a Hulk out"". Each of them has interviews with the people involved in each process, from the motion capture artists to the actors bringing those characters to life in the film.The picture in picture feature provides a lot of details and interesting facts but it requires of course of watching the movie at least a couple times more. The UControl feature also includes data from the comic books that inspired shots in the film as well as character files.The feature I was more excited about is the only one presented in standard definition. There are several deleted scenes included; watching them you can see that one of the sequences that suffered more is the one with Betty and Banner at her house. Also there were more references to the ""super soldier"" that were removed. Unfortunately the fact that these are not HD makes them look bad and out of place in a HD presentation.Audio for the main feature is presented in DTS-HD 5.1, Dolby digital 2.0, Spanish and French 5.1.

Its convoluted story and wonky action pieces were just scratched the surface of the Hulk's universe.  One could say it was just a down right odd story from the start.  The Incredible Hulk is set to erase that from the memory of anyone who endured it.Here we see Edward Norton step in the role of Bruce Banner rather then Eric Bana.  Norton brings little new to the lead role but does manage to have some fun with it.  It might sound odd seeing him in the role but all in all is a good fit.  Jennifer Connelly is replaced with Liv Taylor and to be honest doesn't really matter.  I like Connelly better but either one of them could've been replaced by anyone else seeing that Betty Ross doesn't bring anything to the table.  Then there's Tim Roth, who replaces Nick Nolte as the bad guy in the film.  Roth's Emil Blonsky (Abomination) steals the show every part he's in.  Roth's Emil is even better to watch then the Hulk.  Roth hasn't been this cool on screen in a long time.The major draw to this film is the action and this time around the movie doesn't disappoint.  No longer do we have to wait a good hour to get a glimpse of the green giant.  Since the gamma radiation has taken effect before the beginning credits even end.  The F/X team did a good job with the set pieces and director keep the focus tight and fast paced, making this one of the better summer movies of 08.

Trying to live a quiet life in Brazil, Bruce is trying to find a cure for his gamma-radiated alter ego, while keeping his heart rate and anger under control.  When an accident at work, allows the government to trace his location, Bruce must once again flee and seek help where he can find it.After Ang Lee's craptastic Hulk five years ago, I had little hope for the Hulk movie franchise. From a ridiculous-looking Stay-Puff-Marshmallow-Man-Hulk to even more ridiculously silly radioactive killer dogs, I was glad to hear that this new movie was going to completely ignore the Ang Lee version.It wasn't so surprising that Ed Norton did an amazing job as Bruce Banner. He was the sole reason that I had a glimmer of hope for the movie. Getting back to the more dramatic feel of the Hulk tv show, Norton and company was finally able to do the franchise justice. Norton delivered the depth and complexity to the Bruce Banner/Hulk persona that not many could do successfully.  Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, and the rest of the supporting cast were exceptional as well. Liv Tyler, as Betty Ross, had great chemistry with Norton. Tim Roth played Blonsky/Abomination and was an intense power-hungry villain. William Hurt played the role of General Ross, Betty's father and the person in charge of hunting down The Hulk in order to exploit his abilities. Tim Blake Nelson, as Samuel Sterns, played a great ""mad scientist"" role. And there were some fun cameos by Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee, and Mr. Iron Man himself: Robert Downey Jr.The special effects and action scenes were much better in this film as well. The Hulk finally gets to battle a worthy adversary. And in ignoring the first Hulk movie, they were able to re-tell the origin story in just the beginning credits in the classic style of the tv show. There is even a point in the movie where we get to hear the classic theme song. Not corny, but dramatically fitting.With having the origin story out of the way, we are able to jump into the story and concentrate on the depth of the Bruce Banner character and his search for a cure. With a great story, complex characters, and quality special effects, please try to forget if you saw the first Hulk, and watch this one with no preconceptions. Of course, not quite as good as last month's Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk was a very fun, action-packed, dramatic movie.

It's not really a reboot, simply a change in style and creative team.  This happens all the time in the comics.  After a title sequence recap, the story picks up directly after the last one, with Banner hiding out in Brazil and learning how to control his emotions while searching for a cure for his condition.  A random accident alerts the U.S. military to his whereabouts, and the chase is on.I won't say anything more about the plot, because there isn't a whole lot more, and I don't want to give everything away.  This is a very different film from its predecessor.  People were strangely dissatisfied with that one; they said it was too ""intellectual.""  If you're in that camp, you'll love this version.  It's the simple action movie you were looking for.  Sadly, INCREDIBLE does away with all the depth and complexity that made HULK--the film and the character--intriguing.I preferred the original cast, but their replacements are adequate for the most part.  (Liv Tyler is kind of wishy-washy.)  One thing that has improved is the look of the Hulk.  The rendering is a lot better; he has more weight and solidity now.  More detail, too.For what the film tries to do, it does it very well.  It's actually better than I expected. The phrase ""dumbed-down"" kept echoing through my head when I was hearing about the film, but it's not dumb; it's just not as smart.  It's a different interpretation and that's okay.  It's just that I just don't find this kind of movie as interesting.  I need more substance; I don't care if it is a summer ""popcorn flick.""  I've never understood why that mattered.On the technical side, the Blu Ray disc looks and sounds amazing.  If you want to show off your high-def system, this is a disc you'll use.  There is a fairly interesting feature commentary with director Louis Leterrier and actor Tim Roth, some making-of featurettes, and many, many deleted scenes including an alternate opening sequence.  You can bookmark your favorite bits and play them back.  Finally, there is a feature called U Control, with which you can view various supplemental materials while you are watching the film.

Look, Im no fan of Edward Norton, he's surly, unattractive, and never has any chemistry with his female leads, I suppose maybe they find him as hideous as I do, but I digress.  Honestly, he's not bad in this, Banner is sort of a loner and skin flint, so it works in this role, though again no sparks between he and Tyler.  The Abomination is a great choice as a villian, he's as stong as the Hulk and much more destructive, the Hulk was never as blessed as Spider Man when it came to villian in the Marvel Universe, the Abomination is about as good as he ever got.  I wish he had appeared earlier in the film, we only really get to see him in full form at the end when he tangles with the Hulk.

Rather than being nothing more than a new director's take on an old classic, The Incredible Hulk is both an engaging film and a love letter to every other incarnation of the The Hulk that proceeded it.  This film truly endeavors to understand and assimilate the entire history of the character into one new project, and boy does it succeed.At the center of The Incredible Hulk is an ambitious attempt to marry the two most popular and conflicting visions of the character.  The film borrows many elements from the fondly remembered1970s television seriesbut also incorporates many of the more important elements fromthe comic book.  It's a tough balancing act, but the film makes the disparate elements mix together in a way that makes complete sense and (I believe), leaves fans of both series feeling satisfied.  The origin and characterization come largely from the TV series (though, thankfully, it's Dr. BRUCE Banner this time), but the more memorable supporting characters and conflicts from the comic are worked in as well (though Rick Jones was quite fortunately forgotten).  Additionally, the enemy is a highly logical choice from the comic book series.  Finally, the bad memories of a mutated Nick Nolte are beginning to subside.The film also incorporates minor elements fromthe TV movies,the previous film(which is neither acknowledged nor completely contradicted), and even the previousHulk video game.  Of course there are also many wonderful nods to fans of each of the Hulk incarnations.  The flashing danger light, the appearance of student reporter ""Jack McGee,"" and Stan Lee's cameo proved to be my personal favorites.  Lou Ferrigno also receives a far better cameo than in the previous film.Most importantly, whether you have any interest in previous Hulk incarnations or not, this film is exceptionally well plotted.  It resists the urge to shine the light fully on Hulk or Dr. Banner, instead carefully developing the two in unison.  Dr. Banner (masterfully played by Ed Norton, who actually outshines Bill Bixby) gets farther than his television counterpart was ever allowed, and that experience necessarily changes him.  The transformation is satisfying, yet still allows the franchise to return to familiar territory by the end.In parallel, the monster also receives his share of development, though this isn't made clear until the end.  His final scene cements this film's brilliant unison of television series and comic book, leaving no doubt that this is the most impressive project ever to come out of the Hulk franchise.  I was left so excited, so convinced for the first time that the character had truly come to life, that I almost expected Doctor Strange and the Defenders to show up in the next moment.  For only the third time in all my movie going experiences, a beloved comic book character actually seemed real (or at least possible), even in spite of the sometimes questionable computer animation.Finally, true Marvel fans will be amazed to see just how much continuity this two hour film packs.  Clear and meaningful ties are made to Captain America,Iron Man, and S.H.I.E.L.D., and just you wait for the film's final scene!  While DC is still trying to decide who should play Superman and Batman for their Justice League movie, you can rest assured that Marvel is getting ready to tie their films together in a meaningful and impressive way.

I recently sawIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and the green screen special effects were so obvious that it was distracting to the action. That kind of blatant ""fakeness"" would not be good in a movie like The Hulk whose 'big' star is CGI technology. No. The Hulk delivers a realistic looking CGI protagonist (and a cool looking antagonist).The story flow is a little slow at times, and I'm not sure that Ed Norton was a slam-dunk Bruce Banner. The movie was good while Ed and his supporting cast were on-screen, but the movie was great when his CGI counterpart smashed onto the screen.The Incredible Hulk takes you from a brief introduction of how Bruce Banner became The Hulk, who uncontrollably destroyed everything in his path, to perhaps the first real confrontation that earned The Hulk superhero status. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. I was thoroughly entertained.The story is well-written for the screen by X-men screenwriter Zak Penn. The really good news is that Penn has announced that he is working on the screenplay that will bring The Hulk,Iron Manand the rest of TheAvengerstogether on the big screen perhaps as early as 2010 (wishful thinking).The Hulk needs some friends to help move his movies along when he's not in the green.

Also, I felt the special effects fighting scenes dragged on way too long. I'm a big fan of special effects, but this movie seems to be trying to get by on them along with some big name fine actors.Frankly, nothing I've seen comes close to the old TV series, and that was without all of the special effects.

Surprisingly, it's not.  It's better!  How can this be?  Oh, it be!This movie is not a sequel to 2003's ""Hulk"" but rather is a reinvention that establishes a new back-story where Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton, who rewrote some of the script) becomes the Hulk as a pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate a ""super soldier"" program through gamma radiation.  (Why and how Banner becomes the Hulk is established in the movie's opening credits.)On the run, Banner attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he's captured by General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt).  The General's worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier (Tim Roth) becomes a similar but more Hulk-like creature (called the ""Abomination"").This movie has it all: action, drama, humour, (dare I say) incredible special effects, and good acting (with one exception).I missed Jennifer Connelly who played Dr. Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross in the 2003 movie.  Here she's replaced by Liv Tyler who's rather bland.The CGI creation of the Hulk was quite good.  This movie did not over rely on special effects but let the actors do their jobs.  It was only at the end where (as you can probably guess) there's a confrontation between the Hulk and the Abomination that the movie becomes cartoon-like.Be sure to look for a few cameo appearances.  Do not miss, especially, Lou Ferrigno (who played the Hulk in the late 1970's television series).  He voiced the words said by the CGI Hulk in this movie.  (Lou...what a guy!!)I also liked the ""Days without Incident"" meter.  I thought this was a nice touch.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2008) has good picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.In conclusion, this is a surprisingly entertaining Hulk movie.  Be sure to watch it to discover why you shouldn't get Bruce Banner mad.

1180859,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B001DHXT1G,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[1, 1]","I wish I could explain eloquently how changed I am about an opinion on a film. Watching the BD is experiencing an entirely different and much better movie.Technically, this is a 5 star product. I played it both on plasmas and LCDs over the last few days and it looks excellent. Paused well over 50 different scenes (motion and still scenes) and everything looks as it should for what they were trying to create. The filmmakers held an exclusive BD screening to show off their special effects and their pride in how the fx came across, so the resulting look is reasonably solid. The usual Universal menus and selection sounds are throughout, and all of the typical BD features are enabled/possible here.The resounding difference here are the deleted scenes. There are over 42 minutes of all the best parts left for us to interject back into the film. The reason I did not give this a 5 star is they should have made the choice to have the BD be the 2 hour 35 minute cut. The majority of every gripe I have heard about this film is answered or fixed with these scenes. Christina Cabot (Major), Ty Burrel (psych boyfriend), and Peter Mensah (the other General) all had their characters ripped to shreds with this theatrical cut. There was actually a good side to Roth, there was actually tons of character development; all apparently cut (in my opinion) to dumb down the film. What a waste.Be sure to have your speakers adjusted correctly because this sound mix can blow a sub or mids if you have them set to high. Great sounds, great clarity and plenty of features. Highly recommend as a purchase, and the only shortcoming is on the director for giving a 3 second intro to the deleted scenes that stated nothing of why he destroyed this film by cutting them.",4,What a different film the BD is...,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,1756,"['wish', 'could', 'explain', 'eloquently', 'how', 'changed', 'am', 'opinion', 'film', 'Watching', 'BD', 'experiencing', 'entirely', 'different', 'much', 'better', 'movie.Technically', '5', 'star', 'product', 'played', 'plasmas', 'LCDs', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'excellent', 'Paused', 'well', '50', 'different', 'scenes', 'motion', 'still', 'scenes', 'everything', 'looks', 'should', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'create', 'filmmakers', 'held', 'exclusive', 'BD', 'screening', 'show', 'off', 'special', 'effects', 'pride', 'how', 'fx', 'came', 'resulting', 'look', 'reasonably', 'solid', 'usual', 'Universal', 'menus', 'selection', 'sounds', 'are', 'typical', 'BD', 'features', 'are', 'enabled/possible', 'here.The', 'resounding', 'difference', 'here', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', '42', 'minutes', 'best', 'parts', 'left', 'interject', 'back', 'film', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', '5', 'star', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'choice', 'have', 'BD', 'be', '2', 'hour', '35', 'minute', 'cut', 'majority', 'gripe', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'answered', 'fixed', 'scenes', 'Christina', 'Cabot', 'Major', 'Ty', 'Burrel', 'psych', 'boyfriend', 'Peter', 'Mensah', 'other', 'General', 'had', 'characters', 'ripped', 'shreds', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'side', 'Roth', 'was', 'actually', 'tons', 'character', 'development', 'apparently', 'cut', 'opinion', 'dumb', 'down', 'film', 'What', 'waste.Be', 'sure', 'have', 'speakers', 'adjusted', 'correctly', 'sound', 'mix', 'can', 'blow', 'sub', 'mids', 'have', 'set', 'high', 'Great', 'great', 'clarity', 'plenty', 'features', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'director', 'giving', '3', 'second', 'intro', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'stated', 'nothing', 'why', 'destroyed', 'film', 'cutting']",N/A
1180860,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B001DHXT1G,Steven Hancock,"[1, 2]","Marvel Studios followed their exceptional ""Iron Man"" with ""The Incredible Hulk,"" another terrific comic book adaptation. Dispensing with the overall seriousness of the previous film, the Ang Lee-directed ""The Hulk,"" this film returns to the storyline as seen in the 1978 television show. In fact, one of the film's pluses is that it brings elements from the show into the film, such as Lou Ferrigno, who lends his voice to the Hulk, as well as a cameo appearance as a security guard; and the TV theme makes a welcomed return.While not as good as ""Iron Man,"" this is a terrific film that features some awesome action sequences, terrific visual effects and fine storytelling. The performances are good as well. Edward Norton is great as Bruce Banner, bringing the character elements that Bill Bixby made famous, while also adding some great little character nuances, while not making the character too dark or depressing, such as Tobey McGuire did in the overrated ""Spider-man"" films. The beautiful and talented Liv Tyler provides some smarts and sexyness as Banner's love interest, while William Hurt and Tim Roth give menacing performances as Banner's villainous rivals. And a welcomed cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark is not only memorable, but also continues the march toward ""The Avengers"" in 2011.With ""The Incredible Hulk,"" Marvel Studios has made two well-done superhero films.

Hubbard ""AA Suspense/Intrigue Roman...","[1, 2]","Green is GOLD for Marvel!!!!When I was little, I remember my oldest sister begging to be allowed to see The Incredible Hulk. She was the Sci-fi person in the house. She used to watch Ultraman and Godzilla - things we as the younger children in the house weren't allowed to see. Bedtime was 7pm and all the scary shows were off limits to our young eyes. My sister Sharon used to run under the bed when Batman came out the cave every episode.Yet I was curious about my older sister's eagerness to watch the ""new"" show back then and I snuck back down and peered over the banister of the top of the steps to watch David Banner, the nicest and most handsome white man I ever saw turn into this angry huge giant.I don't think my eyes could go any wider as I watched the green giant tear things apart and knock things over. I didn't think that they could ever re-invent ""The Hulk.""I stand up for Stan Lee. He should be immortalized as a creative genius. He's taken the green giant to a higher level carefully using technology and our imagination to create a story that will blow your mind away.The other Incredible Hulk was only on the borderline that they made a few years ago. This one created under the Marvel Film Studio does justice! True Justice to the legend of this wondrous Super Hero.In this version, they pick up kind of where the one they made a couple of years left off, giving the viewer a way to not have to start at the beginning again, which I liked. Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton, is on the run from the government and General Ross (William Hurt).Bruce is desperate to get this out of him using any and all natural means to contain his anger so ""The Hulk"" doesn't take control. He corresponds with ""Mr. Blue,"" played by Tim Blake Nelson to help him out, but in order to do that they need to original data, which means Bruce must ""go home."" Home meaning back to where he started the experiment. - back to the lab and back to being near his old love, Betty Ross, played by Liv Tyler, who is also General Ross's daughter.""His whole body is considered government property,"" General Ross tells Emil Blonsky, a military mercenary (Tim Roth), who's hired to help capture Bruce.Blonsky sees the beauty of power in ""The Hulk"" when it takes out his men and picks up forklifts ""like softballs."" Greed drives him to convince General Ross to give him ""a taste"" of that power. The taste leads to wanting more and Blonsky convinces ""Mr. Blue"" to give him some of the blood from Bruce's body.This leads to the horribly morphed monster that now is so enraged, so out of control, the government and General Ross now have to ask Bruce for help.And the pinnacle of this movie is like experiencing visual Ecstasy. The madder the Hulk gets the more you enjoy it.Technology was a beautiful thing in this instance mixed with reality where these two monsters went head to head all over New York City. Tearing, ripping, breaking, growling and just trying to kill each other.Loved IT!!Not only did I enjoy the actors who didn't even make me feel like they were acting, but the synergy with the past, present and even the future of potential sequels, off stories and more were just beautiful.You will not be disappointed and stay until the very end!

In this previous film, Ang and the screenplay writers concocted a backstory involving Bruce Banner's father that wasn't in the comic book, adding a soap opera element that didn't bolster the story, wasted the talents of Eric Bana (who played Banner), Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, and Sam Elliott, and featured a fight between The Hulk and three genetically altered dogs, including a poodle!This film picks up the thread of the previous film, but to much better affect. The father is thankfully absent, Bana is replaced by Edward Norton, Connelly is replaced by Liv Tyler playing Betty Ross, Banner's girlfriend, and William Hurt replaces Elliott, and plays General Thunderbolt Ross, the army officer chasing the Hulk and Betty's father. Banner is on the run and hiding out in Brazil when he is tracked down by the US Army and has to flee. In the meantime, he has found online a scientist who might be able to reverse the gamma radiation damage that cause Banner to become the Hulk. Tim Roth plays a Special Forces soldier who is willing to do anything to catch the Hulk, including becoming just like him.Although Roth's character becomes The Hulk's comic book nemesis, The Abomination, this movie is not the abomination Ang Lee's film turned out to be. This is a film that should appeal to most Hulk fans and seems more like the kind of film that comic books fans would expect.

Although the film has a surfeit of action and gargantuan battle sequences (involving more devastation than Cloverfield), Leterrier's Hulk is little more than King Kong. An insipid love story, predictable villains and jargon-drenched palavers don't help the mighty green giant from becoming anything more than a typical superhero. At least the attention to seriousness is comparable to Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of Batman.Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has accidentally unleashed a gamma poisoning mutation within himself that causes his body to transform into a hulking green monstrosity. Unable to control the raging Hulk, which is summoned by his anger, he hides away from the world in the crowded favelas of Brazil. Bruce converses with a mysterious Mr. Blue through an encrypted satellite connection, in the hopes of learning the secret to removing the contamination from his body.Meanwhile, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) diligently scours the globe looking for the elusive Banner, who he tricked into experimenting with the radiation for use as a military weapon. The General's daughter, Betsy (Liv Tyler), is still in love with Bruce, but he keeps his distance to prevent hurting her or causing the deaths of innocent people. To help with the manhunt is Russian professional tough guy Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), on loan from the Royal Marines. But after witnessing Banner's unbridled powers as The Hulk, Blonsky desires such abnormal invincibility for himself - leading to further freakish experimentations that will unleash an abomination.The opening title sequence for The Incredible Hulk rapidly sums up the entire Hulk origin, thereby leaving the brunt of the film to serve merely as an episode of adventure. The General occasionally fills us in on missing pieces of integral information, but for the most part, this film could serve as both a remake and a continuation (a retcon, in comic fandom) of Ang Lee's Hulk from 2003. Not having much to live up to, The Incredible Hulk easily outperforms its predecessor, but not to the point of undeniable success. In an age where comic book movie adaptations are no longer once-a-year or out of the ordinary, this latest attempt sadly feels like a typical superhero movie. The special effects are better, the editing is certainly more tolerable, and the characters are handled with more sincerity and seriousness, but the story is frightfully familiar and rather un-involving.Attempting to create reason behind unexplainable elements such as The Hulk's ability to keep his pants on (which is both impossible and largely unnecessary), the film temporarily forgets that it is still leaps and bounds from being even slightly reasonable. It does distract us with Cloverfield-rivaling destruction at Culver University and New York City, and the Hulk-Abomination fracases are magnificently constructed and shot. The Hulk doesn't defy gravity or fly around like Lee's original version, but occasionally his movements are too light and graceful for his tree-stump figure.Director Louis Letterier does succeed in making a darker, more violent and more serious Hulk, and the references to other Marvel creations, the expected cameos, and explosive action remains. But despite crafting a better Hulk, the story and overall entertainment value can't compete with the choice superior superhero movies that demonstrate both creativity and heart - such as Iron Man and Batman, which are more frequent than ever before.- Mike Massie",3,The Incredible Hulk Movie Review,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,3592,"['Incredible', 'Hulk', 'infinitely', 'superior', '2003', 'Hulk', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'achieve', 'film', 'surfeit', 'action', 'gargantuan', 'battle', 'sequences', 'involving', 'more', 'devastation', 'Cloverfield', 'Leterrier', 'Hulk', 'little', 'more', 'King', 'Kong', 'insipid', 'love', 'story', 'predictable', 'villains', 'jargon-drenched', 'palavers', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'mighty', 'green', 'giant', 'becoming', 'anything', 'more', 'typical', 'superhero', 'least', 'attention', 'seriousness', 'comparable', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 're-imagining', 'Batman.Bruce', 'Banner', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'accidentally', 'unleashed', 'gamma', 'poisoning', 'mutation', 'body', 'transform', 'hulking', 'green', 'monstrosity', 'Unable', 'control', 'raging', 'Hulk', 'summoned', 'anger', 'away', 'world', 'crowded', 'favelas', 'Brazil', 'Bruce', 'mysterious', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'encrypted', 'satellite', 'connection', 'hopes', 'learning', 'secret', 'removing', 'contamination', 'body.Meanwhile', 'General', 'Thaddeus', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'diligently', 'globe', 'looking', 'elusive', 'Banner', 'who', 'tricked', 'experimenting', 'radiation', 'use', 'military', 'weapon', 'General', 'daughter', 'Betsy', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'still', 'love', 'Bruce', 'distance', 'prevent', 'hurting', 'causing', 'deaths', 'innocent', 'people', 'help', 'manhunt', 'Russian', 'professional', 'tough', 'guy', 'Emil', 'Blonsky', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'loan', 'Royal', 'Marines', 'witnessing', 'Banner', 'unbridled', 'powers', 'Hulk', 'Blonsky', 'such', 'abnormal', 'invincibility', 'leading', 'further', 'freakish', 'experimentations', 'will', 'unleash', 'abomination.The', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'rapidly', 'sums', 'up', 'entire', 'Hulk', 'origin', 'thereby', 'leaving', 'brunt', 'film', 'serve', 'merely', 'episode', 'adventure', 'General', 'occasionally', 'missing', 'pieces', 'integral', 'information', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'could', 'serve', 'remake', 'continuation', 'retcon', 'comic', 'fandom', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Hulk', '2003', 'Not', 'having', 'much', 'live', 'up', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'easily', 'predecessor', 'not', 'point', 'undeniable', 'success', 'age', 'where', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'once-a-year', 'ordinary', 'latest', 'attempt', 'sadly', 'typical', 'superhero', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'better', 'editing', 'certainly', 'more', 'tolerable', 'characters', 'are', 'handled', 'more', 'sincerity', 'seriousness', 'story', 'frightfully', 'familiar', 'rather', 'un-involving.Attempting', 'create', 'reason', 'unexplainable', 'elements', 'such', 'Hulk', 'ability', 'keep', 'pants', 'impossible', 'largely', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'temporarily', 'still', 'leaps', 'being', 'even', 'slightly', 'reasonable', 'distract', 'Cloverfield-rivaling', 'destruction', 'Culver', 'University', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Hulk-Abomination', 'fracases', 'are', 'magnificently', 'constructed', 'shot', 'Hulk', ""n't"", 'defy', 'gravity', 'fly', 'Lee', 'original', 'version', 'occasionally', 'movements', 'are', 'too', 'light', 'graceful', 'tree-stump', 'figure.Director', 'Louis', 'Letterier', 'succeed', 'making', 'darker', 'more', 'violent', 'more', 'serious', 'Hulk', 'references', 'other', 'Marvel', 'creations', 'expected', 'cameos', 'explosive', 'action', 'crafting', 'better', 'Hulk', 'story', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'value', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'choice', 'superior', 'superhero', 'movies', 'demonstrate', 'creativity', 'heart', 'such', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Batman', 'are', 'more', 'frequent', 'ever', 'before.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
1180870,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B001DHXT1G,The Man With No Name,"[1, 3]","Back in 2003 we the Fanboys were given 'The Hulk', directed by Ang Lee and staring Eric Bana as Bruce Banner.  While the fight scenes were pretty epic at times, this film utterly failed, namely by ignoring the source material.  I plan on doing a review of 'The Hulk' here shortly...So, since the first 'Hulk' was not loved by the fans, and also to get a prequel in that would conincide with the 'Avengers' release, Marvel went back to the drawing board.  It was a good decision.  One, 'The Hulk' came out 9 years ago, so a more updated prequel/film was needed.  Two, a better back story needed told.  They achieved this.--Story/Premise--  **(Spoilers ahead)**The movie begins with us the viewer seeing Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) living down in South American and trying to get by, working in a soda factory.  He is also trying desperately to contain the monster within him and find a cure.  He is currently in correspondence with another scientist back in the states.Enter General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt), father of Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), a military man on the hunt for Bruce, aka The Hulk.The film gives a decent but simple backstory for the Hulk's birth.  Dr. Banner was developing a serum that would make people immune to gamma radiation.  I guess his goal was to make people immune and take away the threat of nuclear attacks.  People with this immunity to radiation could work in nuclear facilities without fear.  Cancer could be abolished as well.Well he tries the formula on himself and bombards himself with gamma radiation, in a machine strait from the Bill Bixby tv series.  Well...things don't go as planned, and the formula combined with the gamma beam transform him into the Hulk.  He injures Betty and General Ross and completely destroys the lab.Shortly afterward he flees and has been on the run from the U.S. Government ever since.  This is a very similar premise and tone to the much loved television series from the 1980s, another reason this film was good.FYI, it turns out the base material for the serum he was working on was similar to the super-soldier serum that infused Captain America with his strength.  A cool unifying point here.  If you watch Captain America, after the scientist who developed the serum is killed, blood samples are drawn from Steve Rogers in hopes that it can be someday be duplicated again.  This imperfect serum is what is used in the 'Incredible Hulk'.  I also will take a guess that Nick Fury has taken a form of it, and is quite older than he appears.  Time will tell if my theory is right...Needless to say General Ross wants the Hulk back and to discover how he has so much strength and power.  Thus the chase is on.  Enter Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a transferred soldier from Britain brought in to join Ross's black ops team.  Their goal is to get Banner, alive.  After a slip up by Bruce, they determine he is in South America and attempt to capture him with force.This fails of course, Banner transforms after months of successful calmness and gets away.Jumping ahead, Ross has the bright idea to try a version of the super-soldier serum he has been working on, on Blonsky.  It works, Blonsky is infused with energy, strength and goes up against a transformed Banner.  He however loses, and the Hulk kicks him HARD, smashing him against a tree and leaving him more broke than Evel Knievel.The Hulk escapes with Betty Ross and manages to make it to his mystery scientist, which he has been communicating with, Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson).Meanwhile Blonsky to the surprise of his doctors, fully heals from his injuries, thanks to the super-soldier serum, and is ready again for action.  Ross, thinking a little does good so a lot must do better, has even more of the serum injected in Blonsky.  This seems to have psychological influences on him and starts to cause monstrous qualities in him, just look at his back...Banner and Dr. Stern trigger a Hulk transformation and Stern infuses the Hulk with a purple formula derived from a plant.  This ceases the transformation and causes Banner to return, seamingly cured.  To Bruce's horror he soon discovers that Dr. Sterns has cloned his blood and has quite a stockpile of it.  Before he can do anything about it though, he is tranked by Ross's black ops team and apprehended.But...things are not over.  Blonsky want's MORE power and forces Sterns to infuse him with the Hulk's blood, transforming him into the Abomination.  He then starts to wreck havock on the city and calls out the Hulk to fight him.  Banner, not sure if he will still transform, jumps out of the helicopter and hurtles to the ground below.  It seems he isn't going to transform and slams into the pavement, but...he transforms at the last minute.An epic battle ensues between the two monsters.  Fans of the 'Hulk' video games will like the part where the Hulk weaponizes himself by smashing a police car and uses it's two halves as iron gloves.  Awesome fight scene, with the Hulk finally uttering his famous line ""Hulk Smash!!!""  The film ends with the Hulk getting away and the Abomination smashed up pretty good.  The movie closes with us the viewer seeing Dr. Banner trying desperately to keep the Hulk inside with meditation, but eventually failing.  The film concludes with Banner smiling, his eyes turning green...--Possible 'Thor' Easter Egg--FYI, there is supposed to be a scene that ties 'Thor' to this film.  Apparently there are posts going around stating that during the end movie fight, if you watch the horizon you'll seen a random bolt of lightning.  This lightning strike is said to be the part where Thor is banished to Earth by Odin.  I can't confirm this, in fact I don't recall seeing anything of the sort when I have watched the movie.  I can only suggest you watch it for yourself.  Maybe I'm missing something.  Thought this was worth mentioning.--After Credits Clip--We find General Ross in an army bar getting plastered.  Who walks in?  None other than Tony Stark himself.  There is a brief banter between the two, then Tony mentions that ""they"" are putting a team together and he wants Ross in on it.  I guess this means that the Avengers want the Hulk.  Kind of an obscure scene.  Still, it shows that the 'Avengers' has been a project years in the making and in development since 'Iron-Man' came out.  Well, the wait is over...--Casting Choices--Edward as Bruce Banner was a pretty good decision.  Norton definitely has the chops for acting and rarely disappoints.  I am not sure if he was the PERFECT choice, and evidently wasn't as he was canned.  Mark Ruffalo has just signed a 6 film 'Hulk' deal, so maybe he is much better.  I'll soon see.  Overall Norton gives a good performance.  However he has nothing to do with the Hulk.  Once the CG transformation is over, Norton went to his trailer.  The Hulk was actually voiced by Lou Ferrigno, who did a good job.  Norton however in my opinion is probably better left to projects like 'Fight Club' and 'Primal Fear'.Liv Tyler as Betty Ross?  Not good at all.  She is in my humble opinion not the best actress.  Although she did alright in 'Lord of the Rings'.  This film however, they should have gone with Olivia Wilde.  Big fan of hers.William Hurt as General Ross?  Hurt wasn't the worse casting decision, BUT I still prefer Sam Elliot as Ross.  Hurt, while good in films like 'Michael' felt out of place slightly in this film.  Still they could have done worse.Tim Roth was a good decision at Emil Blonsky/Abomination.  Roth is good in just about anything and can go from dramas to action flicks at the drop of a hat.  I hope we see his Abomination's return in the future.--Home Releases--The Hulk was released on DVD and Blu-Ray.  I personally own the 3-Disc edition.  FYI, this ""3-Disc"" is just the 2-disc edition with a digital copy of the film thrown in.  It's not even in the jacket itself.  If comes in a paper sleeve, and will never fit in the case again after you remove it.  I never installed the digital copy, and actually think the time limits for installation have expired.  I could be wrong...  The biggest plus to buying the Blu-Ray or 2 or 3-Disc DVD are the numerous special features you get.  If you love special features, get at least the 2-disc edition, as the 1-disc is kind of lacking on features.  Or better yet, buy the Blu-Ray edition, it's pretty cheap now.--In Conclusion--This is the film we the fans wanted back in 2003 and failed to get.  Thank you Marvel for redoing this film AND doing it correct this time.  Some nice winks in this film at 'Iron-Man' and possibly 'Thor', and yet another hint at the 'Avengers'.  Good stand alone film and prequel to quite possibly the biggest release this summer, the 'Avengers'.Well, that's my thoughts.  I'll let you know how the 'Avengers' is soon...--References--1.

1180872,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B001DHXT1G,The Wickerman,"[1, 1]","I cannot tell you how pleased I was with this movie.  Not that it was particularly brilliant in and of itself, but it was a massive improvement over its jaw-droppingly horrible predecessor, ""Hulk"".  With its perfunctory script, poor action sequences, and blatant overuse of splitscreen effects, that movie disappointed me beyond belief.  But, leave it to Edward Norton and Zak Penn to redeem the series, and bring the big green guy to the big screen like it should be.Here we see Bruce Banner struggling with his newfound affliction, and attempting to contain his little rage problem.  After striking up an online friendship with a mysterious scientist (who I won't identify here, but we'll see him again), Banner may have found a way to cure himself for good.  But, when a new hulk-like creature (The Abomination) shows up and begins wreaking havoc, Banner must rethink this decision.Overall, this is pretty much just everything you need in a superhero movie. It lacks the depth of something like ""The Dark Knight"", for example, but it's well-written and tons of fun.  The action sequences are so much better than they were in ""Hulk"", which I found to be really choppy and disorienting.  Here, the effects are magnificent and the fight sequences are crisp and exciting.  The Hulk still looks a little too Jolly Green Giant-ish in my opinion, but it's forgivable this time around.  The Abomination looks really cool though.  A lot like Doomsday from the Superman comics, but I wouldn't call it a ripoff because one I'm not sure which character was created first, and two they were always pretty similar anyway.All in all, this is just a really well-accomplished flick, and Edward Norton is perfect as always, proving once again that there's no genre he can't handle.  You also get fun cameos, like Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee (of course), original Bruce Banner Bill Bixby appearing on a TV screen, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu master Rickson Gracie, and another Marvel hero who shall here remain nameless.Definitely check this out.

So far the only consistant character in both films has beenLou Ferrigno. Granted the new characters are great (love Liv Tyler as much as I do the chick fromLabyrinth. And Ed Norton does a great job of being not-so nerdy and not whimpy as Bruce Banner. William Hurt is perfect as the General, and the limey with the thick, British accent inPulp Fictionplays a superb villian) and the animation is good too, but they could have done something different.We've already seen the ""birth"" of the Hulk. How about something more, something fresh?? It doesn't have to be an abomination likeThe Incredible Hulk Returns & The Trial of the Incredible Hulk, where you had Thor and Daredevil ""helping"" David Banner get out of trouble. But it could have been different.There aren't much extras on this version. So you'd be better off picking up theThree-Disc Special Editionfor anything good. There's a commentary (big deal) and a handful of deleted scenes. Plus some signlanguage stuff for deaf people (my guess is that Lou Ferrigno had them put that in, since the dude is deaf as a fax machine), but nothing else.I'm waiting another couple years for another version of the same movie to come out.

I mean think about it, this scientist whose trying to create a super soldier tries the solution on himself, and now when he gets angry he turns into a WWE Superstar! As for the film, it's not much better. I love Edward Norton, he's a big name and a star in his own right, but he's just about the last person I would choose to be the Hulk. His whole personality wasn't right for the part. I like his co-star, Liv Tyler too, and it wasn't that she was bad in this film, it's that her role was a joke and she had absolutely no chemistry with Norton. Tim Roth was the bright spot in the movie, as he's one of those guys who can adapt to any role and I think I'd have preferred to see him as the Hulk. As for the story, parts of it were decent, but they skipped the whole part of the story that I wanted to see! The film starts five years later, in Brazil, I wanted to see how the story started and what prompted banner into doing this. I hate superheroes and I hate their movies, but the Avengers stories have been different. With the exception of Thor, they have for the most part been somewhat realistic and believable. The story here is lame and the movie is based on special effects which did nothing to help the film.

However, I'm always up for a well-made superhero movie, and Louis Leterrier's revision is quite entertaining to say the least. Growing up I never really followed the Hulk. His character just never interested me with the whole duality struggle between Bruce Banner and Hulk. Admittedly, if you think about it in the long run there could be some really good potential for some interesting theme exposition, but I've yet to actually witness it through the comics or other forms of media. This particular movie, however, is still very enjoyable as an action flick. You've got chases, drama, smashing, more drama, more chasing again, and finally an epic battle between two behemoths in the film's finale. I was very surprised at how well-choreographed all the action is. But because the majority of focus is on that action, I feel the movie falters a bit in character development. I like Edward Norton a lot. He's a great actor when given something good to work with. Unfortunately, they don't do much to build Bruce Banner as any kind of real character, other than what we see in the opening credits. I like how Banner was trying to suppress/control his Hulk self throughout the film, but it's always in spurts and they never really utilize that to convey anything to the narrative effectively enough. I remember hearing a rumor of a potential Director's Cut that was supposed to have 70 extras minutes of footage, but I don't know what happened. If Universal should ever decide to double-dip, though, I'd certainly consider it. The Incredible Hulk is a very good movie, and I'm anxious to see more cameos in future Marvel productions.Video - 5.0Colors and flesh tones look outstanding, especially greens. I really like the cinematography at the beginning with the shots of Brazil and other landscape environments. CG integration of the Hulk and Abomination also looks seamlessly perfect. I didn't detect any signs debris or artifacts through my viewing, nor did I see any signs of image manipulation. There is a fine layer of grain to the photography, but I think it actually gives the film an extremely gritty look, which fits the thriller-esque nature very well. Contrast levels never falter, making all sorts of shades feel like you were right there in front of the camera yourself. Black levels are deep as well, and detail is particularly sharp. Everything from the blades of grass in the park to the wrinkles on Liv Tyler's pouty lips look.. incredible. This is easily the best the Hulk has ever looked in the film medium.Audio - 5.0Universal presents The Incredible Hulk to us with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track. And yes, to be clich&eacute;, you can take whatever Marvel superhero adjective you can think of and apply it right here -- incredible, amazing, spectacular, uncanny, fantastic. The sound design and audio placement is flawless. Directionality is very impressive during the action sequences; bullets, rockets, explosions, propellers, sonic cannons, roars, tearing metal, shattered earth; everything is perfectly placed throughout the entirety of the movie, and all with absolutely zero loss in dialogue quality. Speech, sound effects, and a surprisingly good soundtrack by Craig Armstrong are all as crisp and dynamic as you can get. And of course, LFEs are rightfully booming. The Hulk's and Abomination's thunderous footsteps will give your subs a thorough workout.Extras - 4.0As I mentioned before, I was never a big fan of the Hulk. But after watching the special features, I have to say I'm a little more intrigued now by the whole concept and central theme of ""duality."" I guess you could look at the Hulk as representing two sides of ourselves. You've got the normal, controlling, happy-go-lucky human side that we see in the mirror everyday that does his routine, wants to be happy, goes to work, comes home, and repeats. But inside, there's a part of us that's a bit of a savage, some kind of hedonist that, if fully unleashed, can amount to any kind of potentially destructive force controlled by rage or whatever kind of negative emotions we're keeping inside. Granted, this movie didn't emphasize it enough, but I wish it did. I also find it interesting that Norton almost turned the movie down, which I'm most certainly glad he didn't. Also of special note is the alternate opening, presented in full 1080p and with DTS-HD. It's a nice twist to start the movie with. It's just too bad they didn't make that Director's Cut that was rumored.Overall - 4.5I didn't know what to expect. I really like Leterrier for Danny the Dog, and even a little for Transporter 2. Both were entertaining in their own respective rights, though I'd be lying if I said I didn't want The Incredible Hulk to carry over the same kind of writing/directing as his first effort. Regardless, though, The Incredible Hulk is still entertaining enough to make up for the loss in actual character development. With a reference A/V presentation and some pretty good explanatory features, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone of the comic book genre that's looking for a quick fix in action.",5,The

The director of the new Hulk movie is Louis Leterrier responsible for his actions ""Danny the Dog"" and ""Transporter 2"" and like the laconic hero Jason Statham played, the new ""Hulk"" gets to the point straight away. No more father-and-son conflict; no more talky script; just a quick introduction of Banner or the Hulk, and his love Dr. Elizabeth Ross, ignoring what happened in the 2003 film.Edward Norton is Bruce Banner, now a fugitive working at a bottle factory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Because of one small accident (which involves a cameo Stan Lee himself), Bruce is hunted down again, running away from the soldiers led by Gen. Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). This time Bruce runs like Jason Bourne in the narrow streets of the town before turning into the Hulk. Then actions, I mean, the Hulk's actions begin.The actions are supported by computer graphics, and they get bigger and bigger as the story unfolds, leading us to the climax fighting sequence in the big city. The CGI Hulk's actions are fun, but some may think they get too big or even over-the-top. But maybe we should remember that there is no point in making a movie about the Hulk without such big and over-the-top actions.Between these actions ""The Incredible Hulk"" slows down to take time for character development and humor. Some ideas work, some don't. Edward Norton is brilliant as always, giving intelligence and sadness to the character he plays (plus his uncredited contribution to the script). The new cast includes Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson and Tim Ross, with amusing cameos from Rickson Gracie, Robert Downey Jr. and of course, Lou Ferrigno, but it is Edward Norton's splendid performance that really fascinates us.Some might find the new Hulk too fast and noisy, especially those who loved the Ang Lee film.

The show's executive producer, Kenneth Johnson, is a master storyteller and realized that if you tell a story that's nothing but action with no characterization, you don't have much of a story.  I was excited to see Ang Lee's 2003 HULK movie when it was released in theatres, but like many viewers was disappointed.  The film was a huge box office bomb and was stoned by most critics.  After that, I thought that would be the last we would see of the Mean Green Machine on the big screen for awhile.  But, Marvel wasn't ready to give up on one of their most famous characters soon announced plans for another Hulk film.  They promised that the movie would be a better film and would relaunch the character into cinema stardom.  The big wigs at Marvel believed in the project so much that they bet their future as an independent film company on it (IRON MAN was the other film that the studio hoped would turn them into a film studio of reckoning).  At first I was skeptical about the project, but then I learned Ed Norton had signed on to star as Bruce Banner and I felt better about the whole thing. The result is THE INCREDIBLE HULK: an action comic-book movie full of character development that stays true not only to the spirit of the original comic book, but the beloved 1970s television show as well as loosely connecting with 2003's HULK.The movie opens five years after HULK ended.  If viewers will remember, the movie ended with Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) living in South America.  He's (Edward Norton, now) still there and has been able to stay completely off the grid and below the radar, even though he has secretly been looking for a cure for his ""disease"".  Correspondence with a Mr. Blue in the United States have made him very hopeful and he plans to visit Mr. Blue in the near future.  However, those plans are thrown out of balance when the military, led by top soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) and under the official command of Gen. Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), discover Banner's location and seek to bring him in.  The confrontation is a disaster, Blonsky's troops are wiped out and Blonsky is critically injured.  Meanwhile, Banner escapes and finds his way to the U.S. to meet with the love of his life, Betty Ross, and attempts to locate Mr. Blue in hopes of eradicating the monster within.I really enjoyed THE INCREDIBLE HULK. It's not the best comic book/super hero movie ever made, but it is a good one and is just a very entertaining and exciting overall film.  The acting is superb, the special effects are great, there's just the right temperance of character development and action, etc.  The film does a superb job of synthesizing the previous incarnations of Hulk and uniting them together in a coherent whole that both geeks and casual film-goers alike can enjoy.",4,This Hulk Smashes Good.,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",2008,2886,"['When', 'was', 'younger', 'used', 'watch', 're-runs', '1970', 'INCREDIBLE', 'HULK', 'television', 'show', 'show', 'executive', 'producer', 'Kenneth', 'Johnson', 'master', 'storyteller', 'realized', 'tell', 'story', 'nothing', 'action', 'characterization', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'Ang', 'Lee', '2003', 'HULK', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'many', 'viewers', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'was', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'was', 'stoned', 'most', 'critics', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'would', 'see', 'Mean', 'Green', 'Machine', 'big', 'screen', 'awhile', 'Marvel', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'characters', 'soon', 'announced', 'plans', 'Hulk', 'film', 'promised', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'would', 'relaunch', 'character', 'cinema', 'stardom', 'big', 'wigs', 'Marvel', 'believed', 'project', 'so', 'much', 'bet', 'future', 'independent', 'film', 'company', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'was', 'other', 'film', 'studio', 'hoped', 'would', 'turn', 'film', 'studio', 'reckoning', 'first', 'was', 'skeptical', 'project', 'then', 'learned', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'had', 'signed', 'star', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'felt', 'better', 'whole', 'thing', 'result', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'HULK', 'action', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'full', 'character', 'development', 'true', 'not', 'only', 'spirit', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'beloved', '1970s', 'television', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'loosely', 'connecting', '2003', 'HULK.The', 'movie', 'five', 'years', 'HULK', 'ended', 'viewers', 'will', 'remember', 'movie', 'ended', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'living', 'South', 'America', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'now', 'still', 'been', 'able', 'stay', 'completely', 'grid', 'radar', 'even', 'secretly', 'been', 'looking', 'cure', 'disease', 'Correspondence', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'hopeful', 'visit', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'near', 'future', 'However', 'plans', 'are', 'thrown', 'balance', 'when', 'military', 'led', 'top', 'soldier', 'Emil', 'Blonsky', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'official', 'command', 'Gen.', 'Thaddeus', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'discover', 'Banner', 'location', 'seek', 'bring', 'confrontation', 'disaster', 'Blonsky', 'troops', 'are', 'wiped', 'Blonsky', 'critically', 'injured', 'Meanwhile', 'Banner', 'way', 'U.S.', 'meet', 'love', 'life', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'attempts', 'locate', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'hopes', 'eradicating', 'monster', 'within.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'HULK', 'not', 'best', 'comic', 'book/super', 'hero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'one', 'just', 'very', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'overall', 'film', 'acting', 'superb', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'just', 'right', 'temperance', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'etc', 'film', 'superb', 'job', 'synthesizing', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'Hulk', 'uniting', 'together', 'coherent', 'whole', 'geeks', 'casual', 'film-goers', 'alike', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

To be honest I can't decide between the two, which is a better film.  I believe that both movies stand alone strongly and neither is the right version.  However, this film has a much more broad potential for a franchise or Avengers spinoff.  It was a much more fun approach and definetly more action-based.Ang Lees Hulk, I think survived because of its cast and epic proportion.  What didn't work was the Comic panel frames.  There were few people that appreciated that creation.  The action worked and the story worked, but It was just too much length and emotion for its viewers.What works in this film is its simplicity and comic relief for the audience, as well as performances by Edward Norton and Tim Roth.  Also the creativity in the action sequences was much appreciated.  I think I was drawn more to Connelly's portrayal of Betty rather than Liv Tyler's but I'm happy that no one in this film did a horrible job.  I think the majority would say that the pace and action of this film is way more enjoyable.Our special features do their justice.  I certainly got to see a million behind the scenes episodes, which is good.  The U-Control feature was a little tedious and I hope it's revised in the future releases.  Other than that I was glad to pick up my Blu-Ray version.  This is a great quality delivering Blu-Ray.So I reccomend this film to collectors and viewers alike.

Ed Norton just keeps getting skinnier and his acting abilities seem to need a boost of gamma radiation. I wanted to like this movie because I am a big Marvel Comics fan but this movie just wasn't that good. The casting was pretty poor. William Hurt did a good job as Thunderbolt Ross but Liv Tyler is just an awful actress and delivers every line like she is a 2 year old trapped in a womans body (with big pillowy lips). Tim Roth is a good actor but... why Tim Roth? He is suppose to be a great commando and then he takes his shirt off and he looks like a 3 pack a day horribly unfit homeless person who hasn't had a wash or a good meal in about 5 years. Then when he gets some of the super soldier formula they hilariously try to paint muscles on his horrible body. Also standing by William Hurt he looks to be about 4 feet tall which is ok considering that Ed Norton appears to be about 120 pounds of rippling skin and bones which is about 50 pounds less than his love interest Betty Ross.This movie just wasn't that good. I heard that Norton was not pleased and if you watch the deleted scenes you can see that a lot of the humanity of The Hulk (Banner) ended up on the cutting room floor. I have to disagree. There was nothing in the deleted scenes that shouldn't have been deleted except maybe the extended scene between Hurt and Roth.Watch the first one. It was better and it wasn't that good.

I've always liked Ed Norton and while the casting may be strange, I figured he would try something different and interesting with the role.I had a hard time trying to rate this film. I think without a doubt the first half of the film is the strongest, while the latter half was sort of ridiculous and over the top in a bad way. The plot is somewhat mangled, the characters range from uninteresting to downright annoying and the 'bad guy' Hulk was pretty stupid.Ed Norton brought some personality to the title role but even he couldn't save this film. He has a specific look that works so well in most of the films he does, but here, well, it was sometimes odd to see him in character. Liv Tyler did the best she could with her boring role. Her and Norton's character couldn't be more different and trying to picture them together in anyway just didn't work.The climax of the film, as I mentioned earlier is shockingly ridiculous. It is unintentionally funny and just loud and annoying. My 3 star rating is generous-it would be more like 2.5, but like I said, the first half of the film is respectable and had great potential.

1180901,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B001DHXT1G,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 4]","The first thing you'll notice is that there are no giant poodles in ""The Incredible Hulk"". That's a good thing. While Ang Lee's first film had merit, it was flawed and we won't even discuss the silliness factor of a trio of giant dogs attacking Hulk in that film. Director Louis Leterrier's film manages to be both a smashing action film AND a bit of character study returning unashamedly to the comic book roots of the character. This is a fun popcorn flick with really good performances.The opening titles of the film give us a recap of how Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) became the Hulk ignoring the more complex origin of Lee's film. We catch up with Banner in South America working in a soda factory and working on a cure with the help of ""Mr. Blue"" a researcher in the United States. All it takes is a drop of blood in a contaminated soda bottle for General Ross (William Hurt) to locate Banner who he considers to be government property. Putting Blodsky (Tim Roth) a Russian born British soldier in charge of the retrieval, Ross and his team try and take Banner only to have him Hulk out on them.When ""Mr. Blue"" suggests that if he had all the data he might have a cure for him, Bruce Banner visits the only person that would have it--Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Unfortunately for Banner, General Ross manages to track him down and sents a genetically altered Blodsky after Banner with destructive results.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with great picture quality. In fact it's so good that you can see some scenes that should have been rendered in CGI a bit better than they were but weren't because of budget constraints. Nevertheless, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a step up visually from Ang Lee's film from 2003 with Eric Bana with a ribbed but more realistic looking Hulk and his foe Abomination. The final showdown between the two of them combines CGI and miniature work nearly seamlessly.The extras include about 40 minutes of deleted/edited scenes including an alternate opening where Bruce treks to the Arctic and, supposedly, if you look really carefully you can see Captain America buried in the ice just before Banner Hulks out. The deleted scenes are in 480i.We also get a number of cool featurettes including two that show how they used motion capture and the actors to create their CGI counterparts in the film. There's also a ""Making of"" featurette (sponsered by Volkswagon!), a dossier that gives us information on the characters, picture-in-picutre (courtesy of Ucontrol)that allows you to compare scenes from the comic book that inspired scenes in the film as well as animatics and storyboards. The Blu-ray Live feature is also enabled for this disc so if you have a Playstation 3 you can go on line to discuss the film, etc. There's also a digital version of the film that you can load on to your PC and into iTunes or a Windows player if you so choose.""The Incredible Hulk"" may lack the angst of Ang Lee's film ""Hulk"" but it does make up for that lack of angst with a load of action. It's a pity that we didn't get the theatrical cut and Edward Norton's more character driven version as well on this set as that might have rivaled Lee's film in that department. It's hard to tell from the deleted scenes included here simply because they aren't integrated into the film. A lot were cut for good reason while some would have given the film additional depth.""The Incredible Hulk"" is a very good action flick that could have used a bit more character depth but even as presented it's a fun piece of entertainment that almost equals ""Iron Man"".",4,"Entertaining action flick that reinvents character after disasterous ""The Hulk""",1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,3555,"['first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'are', 'giant', 'poodles', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'good', 'thing', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'merit', 'was', 'flawed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'discuss', 'silliness', 'factor', 'trio', 'giant', 'dogs', 'attacking', 'Hulk', 'film', 'Director', 'Louis', 'Leterrier', 'film', 'manages', 'be', 'smashing', 'action', 'film', 'bit', 'character', 'study', 'returning', 'unashamedly', 'comic', 'book', 'roots', 'character', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'really', 'good', 'performances.The', 'opening', 'titles', 'film', 'give', 'recap', 'how', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'became', 'Hulk', 'ignoring', 'more', 'complex', 'origin', 'Lee', 'film', 'catch', 'up', 'Banner', 'South', 'America', 'working', 'soda', 'factory', 'working', 'cure', 'help', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'researcher', 'United', 'States', 'drop', 'blood', 'contaminated', 'soda', 'bottle', 'General', 'Ross', 'William', 'Hurt', 'locate', 'Banner', 'who', 'be', 'government', 'property', 'Putting', 'Blodsky', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Russian', 'born', 'British', 'soldier', 'charge', 'retrieval', 'Ross', 'team', 'try', 'take', 'Banner', 'only', 'have', 'Hulk', 'out', 'them.When', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'had', 'data', 'might', 'have', 'cure', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'only', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Unfortunately', 'Banner', 'General', 'Ross', 'track', 'down', 'genetically', 'altered', 'Blodsky', 'Banner', 'destructive', 'results.The', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'fact', 'so', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rendered', 'CGI', 'bit', 'better', 'were', 'were', ""n't"", 'budget', 'constraints', 'Nevertheless', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'step', 'up', 'visually', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', '2003', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'ribbed', 'more', 'realistic', 'looking', 'Hulk', 'foe', 'Abomination', 'final', 'showdown', 'two', 'combines', 'CGI', 'miniature', 'work', 'nearly', 'seamlessly.The', 'extras', 'include', '40', 'minutes', 'deleted/edited', 'scenes', 'including', 'alternate', 'opening', 'where', 'Bruce', 'Arctic', 'supposedly', 'look', 'really', 'carefully', 'can', 'see', 'Captain', 'America', 'buried', 'ice', 'just', 'Banner', 'Hulks', 'out', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', '480i.We', 'also', 'get', 'number', 'cool', 'featurettes', 'including', 'two', 'show', 'how', 'used', 'motion', 'capture', 'actors', 'create', 'CGI', 'counterparts', 'film', 'also', 'Making', 'featurette', 'sponsered', 'Volkswagon', 'dossier', 'information', 'characters', 'picture-in-picutre', 'courtesy', 'Ucontrol', 'compare', 'scenes', 'comic', 'book', 'inspired', 'scenes', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'animatics', 'storyboards', 'Blu-ray', 'Live', 'feature', 'also', 'enabled', 'disc', 'so', 'have', 'Playstation', '3', 'can', 'go', 'line', 'discuss', 'film', 'etc', 'also', 'digital', 'version', 'film', 'can', 'load', 'PC', 'iTunes', 'Windows', 'player', 'so', 'choose', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'may', 'lack', 'angst', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'Hulk', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'angst', 'load', 'action', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'set', 'might', 'have', 'rivaled', 'Lee', 'film', 'department', 'hard', 'tell', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'here', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'integrated', 'film', 'lot', 'were', 'cut', 'good', 'reason', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'additional', 'depth', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'flick', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'character', 'depth', 'even', 'presented', 'fun', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'almost', 'equals', 'Iron', 'Man']",N/A

1180909,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001DHXT1G,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[76, 87]","""THE MADDER HULK GETS, THE STRONGER HE GETS"". Apparently, ol' Jade-Jaws has been rebooted for the screen under the moniker; ""Incredible Hulk"" with a new director; Louis Letterrier, a new script by Zack Penn and has a new lead actor in Edward Norton. To be honest, I'm one of the few who appreciated Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", appreciated but didn't love. Sure, it was too moody, nary a smile on anyone's face, full of human angst and fake looking CGI,  but I thought it was reminiscent to the comic book when Paul Jenkins was at its helm.  2008's version of the Green Goliath trumps the 2003 version, with a different origin, more action and the CGI is a vast improvement over its predecessor. No, it is not a sequel to the 2003 film but a re-imagining that has close links to the ""Hulk"" (except for the color) who appears in Marvels' ""The Ultimates"" comic book.Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding out somewhere in South America, looking for a cure for his gamma-induced affliction, trying to keep his temper in check, keeping a low profile and avoiding a certain General Ross (William Hurt) who intends to make an army of super-soldiers from his own D.N.A.. After being pursued by a team led by Emil Blonsky (Eli Roth), Banner returns to America to pursue a cure and asks longtime love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) for her help in finding a man named ""Mr. Blue"" who may be able to cure him of his gamma-powered alter-ego. Blonsky is hot on their trail and asks Ross to experiment further with the workings of gamma radiation and cellular manipulation with him as the guinea pig. Blonsky is a man who wants power--at any cost.The origin of the Hulk has been re-written from its 2003 version. Banner is a scientist who is unknowingly performing experiments on gamma applications to try to replicate a serum based on a World War II super-soldier serum (Captain America anyone?) that apparently got out of hand. Ross wants it as a weapon (no surprise) and Banner is the victim. Readers of Marvel's ""the ULTIMATES"" may see some similarities and may applaud this move. It was a good move to incorporate a new script to this 2008 film and Louis Letterrier seems to be the right man for its directorial duties. The script by Zack Penn in the hands of this director still has the usual touches of human drama and a moody atmosphere but at a better pace than Lee's rendition of ol'greenskin.The CGI effects is a step forward from its previous incarnation; an improvement but still not perfect. The Hulk looks more ferocious and feral than the 2003 version and the moments where he says ""Hulk Smash"" still puts a smile on my place. I was waiting on the line ""Hulk is the Strongest one there is"" but I guess this would ruin the film's mood, and become a bit too comical. The battle with the Abomination is the film's main draw. The fight is fierce, savage and above all, very hard-hitting. You feel the impact of the blows, and the snarls add a lot of animal-like ferocity. There is also quite a decent number of action sequences dispersed throughout the film. Banner's encounters with a Black-ops team in the first 20 minutes and with a small army contingent helps the film's pace. Hulk smashes cars, humvees, and crushes almost everything in sight; Hulk also ""claps"" with such devastation. There are also moments that put Hulk's relationship with Betty in the spotlight and the savage monster is truly only savage when provoked. Hulk gets to display some emotion and sensitivity in the presence of Betty. Nice touches, truly reminiscent of the comic book.Edward Norton's Bruce Banner may well be a little underdeveloped but by now, the film is probably relying on the fans to know what he is all about. Banner has that nerdy look but at the same time, strong and determined. Banner trains in the Brazilian style martial arts to try to control his anger by discipline. I almost wanted him to say: ""Hulk knows Kung fu"" but thankfully that didn't materialize. Norton gives a strong performance as our tortured scientist, I rather thought that he displayed the right emotions when one is afraid of losing himself. William Hurt is an outstanding General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, his character is reminiscent of the other ruthless ones, Hurt has played throughout his career. Ross is a man of duty and has that `someone needs to get their hands dirty' attitude that gives his character a lot of depth. Liv Tyler is on par with Jennifer Connelly's Betty Ross. She's the anchor that pulls Bruce through the hardened moments.While the film has the tendency in becoming a bit overlong and fall to the pitfalls of too much melodrama and excessive display of human angst, the film has some cleverly placed bits of satire that assists the film's pace. You wouldn't believe Banner's attempts in communication in Portuguese; ""..you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry."" Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno makes cameo appearances which also add some subtle bits of humor.Ultimately, ""Incredible Hulk"" is a success and an effective reboot from Ang Lee`s 2003 version. The film managed to stay focused in its context of a ""Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde"" formula and the same time delivered a cleverly action-filled popcorn film that delivers the goods. There are hints of an underlying plan with Robert Downey's guest appearance and the hints of a ""super-soldier"" does give comic book fans something to look forward to. The film is a great comic book adaptation and it comes highly recommended from me who has seen Jade-Jaws' ups and downs since 1979.HULK SAYS RECOMMENDED!

1180910,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B001DHXT1G,Wuchak,"[4, 4]","I just viewed the '03 and '08 versions back to back and it's interesting comparing their strengths and weaknesses because they're essentially the same movie. The main difference is that the '08 version omits the conflict Bruce has with his father and exchanges the Absorbing Man (Bruce's father) for the Abomination.The 2008 version starts out better than the 2003 version, more interesting and entertaining, but tends to lose steam by the third act with the ultra-cartooney fight between Hulk and the Abomination. By contrast, the '03 version starts out slow and relatively boring but strongly revives interest by the 90-minute mark when the Hulk has that spectacular rampage that starts in the desert and ends in San Francisco, which lasts a whole 22 minutes. In fact, this rampage is easily one of the most entertaining action pieces in the history of cinema and worth the price of admission. The '08 version has some quality action, for sure, but nothing that even comes close to the main rampage in the '03 version.Edward Norton in the '08 version plays a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana. Not that Bana isn't likable, it's just that he's simply too much of a tall, muscleman to fit the role. He looks like he could kick some serious arse without even becoming the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept.Although the Hulk in the '08 version has a grittier overall appearance, the filmmakers opted for a snot-greened hue, whereas the '03 Hulk has a better shade of green. Furthermore, '03 Hulk looks more realistic and less cartooney, although the facial features of the '08 Hulk are excellent.The '03 version also shows the Hulk jumping around with incredible leaps - almost flying - as he does in the comics, which the '08 version barely implies. The likely reason for this is that the filmmakers rightly realized they couldn't even touch Ang Lee's film in this area.Of course the '03 Hulk is bogged down by the origin story, while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes. To make matters worse for the '03 version, changes were made that slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In Hulk '03 the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.The '08 version changes the Hulk's origin as well, making it similar to the TV show, plus tying it in to the ""super soldier"" serum. The '08 version wins the prize on this front.Some say that the '08 version opts for brawn over the brainy approach of the '03 version, but -- with the exception of Hulk's fight with the Abomination at the end -- this isn't even remotely true. Each film has a lot of drama and I was impressed with the reverent, realistic tone both films have in their non-hulk portions. Banner's relationship with Betty Ross is particularly well-done and moving, especially in the '08 version. Great job by the principles here -- Bana, Norton, Jennifer Connelley and Liv Tyler.Great soundtracks in both versions.So, both films are quality Hulk flicks with some great moments and the '03 version with its spectacular 22-minute Hulk rampage, but each have their strengths and weaknesses. Take the best parts of both and you'd have an incredible Hulk film! (Sorry)Needless to say, if you're a Hulk fan it's necessary to purchase BOTH films.GRADE: B+",4,Comparing the '08 and '03 versions,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,3677,"['just', 'viewed', ""'03"", 'versions', 'back', 'back', 'interesting', 'comparing', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', ""'re"", 'essentially', 'same', 'movie', 'main', 'difference', ""'08"", 'version', 'conflict', 'Bruce', 'father', 'exchanges', 'Absorbing', 'Man', 'Bruce', 'father', 'Abomination.The', '2008', 'version', 'out', 'better', '2003', 'version', 'more', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'lose', 'steam', 'third', 'act', 'ultra-cartooney', 'fight', 'Hulk', 'Abomination', 'contrast', ""'03"", 'version', 'out', 'slow', 'relatively', 'boring', 'strongly', 'interest', '90-minute', 'mark', 'when', 'Hulk', 'spectacular', 'rampage', 'desert', 'San', 'Francisco', 'whole', '22', 'minutes', 'fact', 'rampage', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'action', 'pieces', 'history', 'cinema', 'price', 'admission', ""'08"", 'version', 'quality', 'action', 'sure', 'nothing', 'even', 'close', 'main', 'rampage', ""'03"", 'version.Edward', 'Norton', ""'08"", 'version', 'better', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Not', 'Bana', ""n't"", 'likable', 'just', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'tall', 'muscleman', 'fit', 'role', 'could', 'kick', 'serious', 'arse', 'even', 'becoming', 'Hulk', 'away', 'whole', 'concept.Although', 'Hulk', ""'08"", 'version', 'grittier', 'overall', 'appearance', 'filmmakers', 'opted', 'snot-greened', 'hue', ""'03"", 'Hulk', 'better', 'shade', 'green', 'Furthermore', 'Hulk', 'more', 'realistic', 'less', 'cartooney', 'facial', 'features', ""'08"", 'Hulk', 'are', 'excellent.The', 'version', 'also', 'Hulk', 'jumping', 'around', 'incredible', 'leaps', 'almost', 'flying', 'comics', ""'08"", 'version', 'barely', 'likely', 'reason', 'filmmakers', 'rightly', 'realized', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'area.Of', 'course', ""'03"", 'Hulk', 'bogged', 'down', 'origin', 'story', ""'08"", 'version', 'literally', '3', 'minutes', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', ""'03"", 'version', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'slow', 'story', 'down', 'needlessly', 'complicate', 'comic', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'became', 'Hulk', 'accidentally', 'being', 'exposed', 'gamma', 'rays', 'huge', 'government', 'test-bomb', 'desert', 'Hulk', 'Hulk', 'origin', 'complicated', 'being', 'tied', 'Bruce', 'mad', 'scientist', 'father', 'who', 'experimented', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'one', 'allow', 'latitude', 'comic-to-film', 'translation', 'changes', 'definitely', 'slow', 'story', 'down', 'make', 'origin', 'less', 'immediately', 'gratifying', 'BUT', 'offer', 'father/son', 'conflict', 'table.The', 'version', 'Hulk', 'origin', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'similar', 'TV', 'show', 'tying', 'super', 'soldier', 'serum', ""'08"", 'version', 'prize', 'front.Some', 'say', ""'08"", 'version', 'opts', 'brawn', 'brainy', 'approach', ""'03"", 'version', 'exception', 'Hulk', 'fight', 'Abomination', 'end', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'true', 'film', 'lot', 'drama', 'was', 'impressed', 'reverent', 'realistic', 'tone', 'films', 'have', 'non-hulk', 'portions', 'Banner', 'relationship', 'Betty', 'Ross', 'particularly', 'well-done', 'moving', 'especially', ""'08"", 'version', 'Great', 'job', 'principles', 'here', 'Bana', 'Norton', 'Jennifer', 'Connelley', 'Liv', 'Tyler.Great', 'soundtracks', 'versions.So', 'films', 'are', 'quality', 'Hulk', 'flicks', 'great', 'moments', ""'03"", 'version', 'spectacular', '22-minute', 'Hulk', 'rampage', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'Take', 'best', 'parts', ""'d"", 'have', 'incredible', 'Hulk', 'film', 'Sorry', 'Needless', 'say', ""'re"", 'Hulk', 'fan', 'necessary', 'purchase', 'BOTH', 'films.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
