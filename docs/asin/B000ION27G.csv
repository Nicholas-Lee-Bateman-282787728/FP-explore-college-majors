1021710,A358XP3X4U0X45,B000ION27G,bookloversfriend,"[52, 54]","This movie is a find!  It manages to deal with real people in a realistic way without resorting to the usual easy gimmick of making the people nasty and hostile.  The people here are not perfect, but they are sympathetic.Also, the relationships in this family are very realistic--again without making anyone a pain or an impossible person.  Whoever wrote this had a lot of understanding of the relations between grown siblings and between grown children and their parents.The film also explores some of the big questions of life and how important ""little things"" are in those big questions.  The mother's admitting that she gave an incomplete version of her recipe to a friend who had admired the dish, and that she had been bothered by that and wants to make it right--this was priceless.  Also, her determination to return the library book!The transitions of the characters are well-developed and believable.  They manage to work things out without everyone suddenly becoming angelic creatures without a fault in the world.If you like human dramas about real but decent people, this is not a film to be missed.
