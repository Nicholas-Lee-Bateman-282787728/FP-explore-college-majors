1233477,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001RJXG9U,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Ghosts of Goldfield is a disaster the entire way through.  A really low budget type of horror that does nothing at all in ANY category (no horror whatsoever, no interesting concept, no quality acting, *nothing* at all).  I think what hurts it the most is that it tries to implement a ghost character that the teenagers can SEE but... it looks so much like a regular woman instead of a ghost that it's VERY hard to take seriously, haha.The one scene in particular that strikes me as really awful is when the teens first spot the ghost and they follow her down the stairs of a hotel room.  Honestly, the only good thing about this spot is the unintentional parts- that being, the camera view that shows the ghost from the front side which means we see the flashlight reflection on the walls that the teens were using to follow the ""ghost"".  Unintentionally unique lighting that initially made me think that something supernatural was responsible for the lighting.  They kind of ruined the scene by continuing to show us more of the teens following the ghost.The overexaggeration from the one guy working at the hotel is laughable.  He's REALLY mean towards the kids, and there's no clear reason why he'd act in such a manner other than the movie writers were playing on the old cliched horror trick that ""There must be a scary mean guy to frighten the teens"", haha.  Reminded me of Scooby Doo!The storyline is totally disgusting.  Instead of focusing on actual hauntings and ghosts, it mainly takes us on a sinking ship (not literally unfortunately, I mean metaphorically) of nothing but ""relationship"" scenes between the teens.  You have one of the teens (the brunette girl) that likes to be naughty and steal things, and her presence is basically what ruins the entire story because all she does is either secretly roam around the hallways and steal the things that she likes, or, cheats on the other girls boyfriend.  I actually didn't even realize initially that the blonde girls boyfriend was that one guy until the brunette starting jumping on his lap in one segment later on (you know what I mean by this!)  Unbearable!The only segment that did sort of frighten me through all the horrible acting and storytelling is when the one male teen got pushed down the stairs, and the camera view showed the old lady ghost from the fallen teens point of view (that being the bottom of the stairs where you could anticipate her face moving across the top step) and then suddenly the old lady was just THERE at the bottom of the stairs to finish the teen off using her hands.  That was honestly the best moment in the entire movie.  The way some of the other teens die is just... ugh!  Really really average.Just a really embarrassingly bad attempt at horror.  Nothing went right.  All the characters mannerisms weren't believable, and there's so many problems that it's best to just award it the 1-star rating it deserves and not even give it a second thought.",1,ugh!,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2955,"['Ghosts', 'Goldfield', 'disaster', 'entire', 'way', 'A', 'really', 'low', 'budget', 'type', 'horror', 'nothing', 'ANY', 'category', 'horror', 'whatsoever', 'interesting', 'concept', 'quality', 'acting', '*nothing*', 'think', 'what', 'most', 'implement', 'ghost', 'character', 'teenagers', 'can', 'SEE', 'so', 'much', 'regular', 'woman', 'instead', 'ghost', 'VERY', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'haha.The', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'really', 'awful', 'when', 'teens', 'first', 'spot', 'ghost', 'follow', 'down', 'stairs', 'hotel', 'room', 'Honestly', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'spot', 'unintentional', 'parts-', 'being', 'camera', 'view', 'ghost', 'front', 'side', 'see', 'flashlight', 'reflection', 'walls', 'teens', 'were', 'using', 'follow', 'ghost', 'Unintentionally', 'unique', 'lighting', 'initially', 'made', 'think', 'something', 'supernatural', 'was', 'responsible', 'lighting', 'kind', 'ruined', 'scene', 'continuing', 'show', 'more', 'teens', 'following', 'ghost.The', 'overexaggeration', 'one', 'guy', 'working', 'hotel', 'laughable', 'REALLY', 'mean', 'kids', 'clear', 'reason', 'why', ""'d"", 'act', 'such', 'manner', 'other', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'playing', 'old', 'cliched', 'horror', 'trick', 'must', 'be', 'scary', 'mean', 'guy', 'frighten', 'teens', 'haha', 'Reminded', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'storyline', 'totally', 'disgusting', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'actual', 'hauntings', 'ghosts', 'mainly', 'sinking', 'ship', 'not', 'literally', 'unfortunately', 'mean', 'metaphorically', 'nothing', 'relationship', 'scenes', 'teens', 'have', 'one', 'teens', 'brunette', 'girl', 'be', 'naughty', 'steal', 'things', 'presence', 'basically', 'what', 'entire', 'story', 'secretly', 'roam', 'hallways', 'steal', 'things', 'cheats', 'other', 'girls', 'boyfriend', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'initially', 'blonde', 'girls', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'one', 'guy', 'brunette', 'starting', 'jumping', 'lap', 'one', 'segment', 'later', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Unbearable', 'only', 'segment', 'did', 'sort', 'frighten', 'horrible', 'acting', 'storytelling', 'when', 'one', 'male', 'teen', 'got', 'pushed', 'down', 'stairs', 'camera', 'view', 'showed', 'old', 'lady', 'ghost', 'fallen', 'teens', 'point', 'view', 'being', 'bottom', 'stairs', 'where', 'could', 'anticipate', 'face', 'moving', 'top', 'step', 'then', 'suddenly', 'old', 'lady', 'was', 'just', 'THERE', 'bottom', 'stairs', 'finish', 'teen', 'using', 'hands', 'was', 'honestly', 'best', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'way', 'other', 'teens', 'die', 'just', 'ugh', 'Really', 'really', 'average.Just', 'really', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'attempt', 'horror', 'Nothing', 'went', 'right', 'characters', 'mannerisms', 'were', ""n't"", 'believable', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'best', 'just', 'award', '1-star', 'rating', 'not', 'even', 'give', 'second', 'thought']",Ghosts of Goldfield
