Frances Dee is beautiful and a much under rated actress. They were good together. One note. When he throws her over his shoulder and carries her that was supposed to be a stunt woman, but Duke surprised he and that was her. Something she and her husband Joel McCrea laughed at for many years. The two stars carry the film. It is good seeing Duke as a young man. Thought I saw all his films till this popped up.",3,A MAN BETRAYED,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,515,"['love', 'John', 'Wayne', 'so', 'anything', 'fine', 'other', 'hand', 'script', 'was', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'Frances', 'Dee', 'beautiful', 'much', 'rated', 'actress', 'were', 'good', 'together', 'One', 'note', 'When', 'shoulder', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'stunt', 'woman', 'Duke', 'surprised', 'was', 'Something', 'husband', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'laughed', 'many', 'years', 'two', 'stars', 'carry', 'film', 'good', 'seeing', 'Duke', 'young', 'man', 'Thought', 'saw', 'films', 'till', 'popped', 'up']",N/A
