I find it interesting that back then they used to drink and smoke on stage. I suppose they might still drink however from what I've seen on Jay Leno (which is now Jimmy Fallon I believe) it's hidden and made to look like coffee or water. You just can't tell anymore. They didn't hide any of it back then, though. Johnny definitely had a knack for hosting and it shows in this. Some very funny highlights and skits. I think most potential buyers won't need to read a review to buy this.",4,Interesting even if you didn't watch Johnny Carson,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,600,"['bought', 'dad', 'watched', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'back', 'day', 'checked', 'out', 'just', 'curiosity', 'find', 'interesting', 'back', 'then', 'used', 'drink', 'smoke', 'stage', 'suppose', 'might', 'still', 'drink', 'however', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'now', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'believe', 'hidden', 'made', 'look', 'coffee', 'water', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anymore', 'did', ""n't"", 'hide', 'back', 'then', 'though', 'Johnny', 'definitely', 'had', 'knack', 'hosting', 'very', 'funny', 'highlights', 'skits', 'think', 'most', 'potential', 'buyers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'read', 'review', 'buy']",The Best of The Tonight Show - King of Late Night

1057254,A3U1WPDQLP9CQ,B000NJL4SK,Lemon,"[19, 19]","This 2 DVD set includes 4 programs previously available on 4 individual DVDs.  It is a great set to get a real feel for Johnny's 30 years on television.  Anyone who was a fan loved it when Johnny would interact with his strange animal guests, and Animal Hijinx has some of the best appearances by many furry friends.  Kids especially like this one.  Tonight Show Memories features short highlights of the most famous moments from the the 30 year history of the show.  Return to Studio One is a really interesting full episode from the late 60's - when guests would show up unannounced. Johnny apparently kept a full-stocked bar back stage, and Dean Martin and Bob Hope showed up to have a few drinks and visit unexpectedly.  It is terrific to watch television that is not entirely planned and scripted.  And the Final Show is a classic in television history.  For fans who want more content, I would still advise buyingThe Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments from The Tonight Show (Vols. 1-3) (1962-1992)over this one, as it has many more hours of content, and then buyJohnny Carson - The Tonight Show: Return to Studio One, 3/6/69as a single disc, but for the price this is a great collection.",5,Great Snapshot of Tonight Show History,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,1215,"['2', 'DVD', 'set', '4', 'programs', 'previously', 'available', '4', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'great', 'set', 'get', 'real', 'feel', 'Johnny', '30', 'years', 'television', 'Anyone', 'who', 'was', 'fan', 'loved', 'when', 'Johnny', 'would', 'interact', 'strange', 'animal', 'guests', 'Animal', 'Hijinx', 'best', 'appearances', 'many', 'furry', 'friends', 'Kids', 'especially', 'one', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Memories', 'short', 'highlights', 'most', 'famous', 'moments', '30', 'year', 'history', 'show', 'Return', 'Studio', 'One', 'really', 'interesting', 'full', 'episode', 'late', '60', 'when', 'guests', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'unannounced', 'Johnny', 'apparently', 'kept', 'full-stocked', 'bar', 'back', 'stage', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'showed', 'up', 'have', 'few', 'drinks', 'visit', 'unexpectedly', 'terrific', 'watch', 'television', 'not', 'entirely', 'planned', 'scripted', 'Final', 'Show', 'classic', 'television', 'history', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'content', 'would', 'still', 'advise', 'buyingThe', 'Ultimate', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Collection', 'Favorite', 'Moments', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Vols', '1-3', '1962-1992', 'one', 'many', 'more', 'hours', 'content', 'then', 'buyJohnny', 'Carson', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'Return', 'Studio', 'One', '3/6/69as', 'single', 'disc', 'price', 'great', 'collection']",The Best of The Tonight Show - King of Late Night
