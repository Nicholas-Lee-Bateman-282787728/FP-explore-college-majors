Arthur ""Al the webmaster""","[0, 0]","On the surface, this is a brilliant show about the mysterious world of the polygamy lifestyle and it's place in modern Mormon life. But it's also a very entertaining and engaging exploration of what it means to be a family. The writing is excellent and the cast is a rich tapestry of some of America's best and most interesting actors. The producers have done an amazing job of transforming a weird and icky topic into a thought provoking old fashioned TV series about family values. I think this is one of the best TV series ever, and I highly recommend it!",5,Entertaining and thought provoking,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,558,"['surface', 'brilliant', 'show', 'mysterious', 'world', 'polygamy', 'lifestyle', 'place', 'modern', 'Mormon', 'life', 'also', 'very', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'exploration', 'what', 'be', 'family', 'writing', 'excellent', 'cast', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'America', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'actors', 'producers', 'have', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'transforming', 'weird', 'icky', 'topic', 'thought', 'provoking', 'old', 'fashioned', 'TV', 'series', 'family', 'values', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1007113,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000GTLQVW,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 14]","Polygamy.  While I do believe this is currently happening in the United States and around the world, it is a darkened corner that the media hasn't really attached itself to consciously.  I have seen quite a bit of films and television, and until Big Love, I don't remember anything that tackled this forgotten issue.  It seems that most media venues would rather focus on the structured lifestyle of Mormonism in Utah, instead of this much smaller, yet very radical sect.  Well, that is to say, until HBO decided to raise its very powerful little hand.  HBO has been a cable station that has pushed the envelope of dramatic and comedy television successfully over the course of the past six years.  Their programming has been influential, charismatic, and groundbreaking - while continuing to be entertaining (a tough combination for mainstream networks).  While their shows (like The Sopranos, Deadwood, and Curb Your Enthusiasm) depict over-the-top antics, it is their characters, with their emotional stories behind them, which keep their shows grounded and continuous repeat viewers.  HBO is the station for amazing television.  That is why I am not surprised to see them conquer (of sorts) polygamy in their new series Big Love.  While it is not the best original outing that I have seen come from HBO, I am still impressed and eager to see how they plan on developing their characters after the ""GASP"" at the end of this first season.As mentioned before, what makes HBO television worth enjoying are the characters.  It seems that from Larry David to Tony Soprano to now Bill Hendrickson, there is a level of connectivity that HBO brings to the screen.  While I don't engage in polygamy, I still found myself drawn to the show because of two grand reasons - 1) the unknown and 2) the characters.  Shame on me, but I know very little about polygamy outside of films depicting the Middle East.  Because of the lacking detail from our American media department, I was oblivious to the day-to-day lifestyle of those that lead ""the principle"", so I was instantly pulled in.  I watched as Bill Hendrickson (played extra dry by Bill Paxton), owner of Hendrickson's Home Plus (a Lowe's or Home Depot), walked into one house to keep up ""normal"" appearances, but instantly walked into a big backyard combining the two houses next to his.  These were his families, and like any family, they are all different.  Bill's first wife, ""Boss Lady"" Barb (played by Jeanne Tripplehorn) is his rock.  She is his first wife, and he has a much older family with her.  She is his right hand, because she can be seen in public with him, while the other wives (or sisters) cannot due to legal reasons.  Bill's second wife Nikki (Chlo Sevigny) is the firecracker of the group, constantly fighting the normality of the situations and constantly seeking attention.  Her story about this marriage is a bit cloudy, but hopefully will be discovered a bit further with Season Two.  Finally, there is Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin) who seems the least likely to be in the polygamy lifestyle.  She is the outcast, being the third wife, who constantly struggles for approval.It is with these four highly different, yet completely developed characters that Big Love is a show that you cannot put down.  HBO releases each episode with having these characters engulfed in smaller dilemmas, but never forgetting about the big picture that constantly hangs on Bill's shoulders.  This is a series about family, in a non-conformist sort of way.  It is interesting to see how HBO used polygamy to bring about a show that is, at the core, about family values.  It is a program about seeing the differences of your family, and accepting the truth about them.  While, again, with Big Love it is more over-the-top, a trained eye can see that Bill loves his family, and throughout this series fights for their well being.  For those worried that Big Love is a highly religious show, I would have to wean you from that thought.  Big Love does take place in Utah, and there is some outside references to LDS, but it is very small.  In fact, it is the LDS community (those smaller characters like my favorite -- Tina Majorino's Heather Tuttle) that keeps the questions that we would typically find ourselves asking at the top of our minds.  The series continues to evolve from episode one, giving us both the issues facing the external problems (i.e. the community at large), but also the internal struggles with three completely different wives and the families that they foster.  HBO gives us these problems tactfully and with ease, with subtle moments that make this series all HBO - for example, the estranged relationship between Margene and Bill's eldest son, who is currently coping with the phasing steps of his high school relationship.  All fun - all engrossing.That is finally to say that Big Love doesn't have its faults.  This series will frustrate you because of how well the cast works.  You have characters that are annoying, that make you nervous and that you down right dirtily hate, but yet it continues to pull you in each and every episode.  Alas, this is not a show that I could watch over and over again.  It reminded me of the Showtime series Weeds in that not enough was developed from the beginning and not enough is disclosed through the first season.  Big Love demonstrated the tact of having post-issues with the characters (issues that we have not seen on screen), but did not deconstruct them very well.  Bill's childhood is unfamiliar.  The medical dilemma that brought Bill back into the ""principle"".  Bill's brother's football story.  The history of the wives and their interconnection with Bill ... and finally - are there polygamist gangsters?  I felt for a short time that HBO was capitalizing on The Sopranos with Bill's conflicts with Roman Grant.  I also was missing the connection on why Roman's daughter Nikki was married to Bill ... all questions that I thought would be answered, but alas, I have to wait until season two.Overall, I must give high marks to this show for its originality and experimentation into a world within our own that is hardly spoken about, but it lacks repeat viewings.  It isn't a show that I could own or re-watch like The Sopranos or Deadwood because of some slower moments in the center of the series.  I loved the characters, but sometimes the over-the-top conflicts were too much.  Again, I cannot restate my confusion with polygamist gangsters ... I would like more literature on this please!  I would suggest this series to friends, but just for one viewing.  It isn't going to be for everyone, but well worth the time if you decide to carry it out.  Overall, Big Love began with mediocrity, but I think it has the potential to pull forward.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Who wants Big Love on a Utah highway?,1164499200,"11 26,

Breland ""Mrmad2007""","[1, 2]","what can i say about big love...love it or hate it but you cant ignore it . its a great show. hbo does it again with the classics like with oz, the wire and now they look into the world of polygamy. a strange world but a entertaining world. will you love the show yes you will...you will love the cast especially bill paxton who is such a underrated actor. i love his work like a simple plan and one false move. i love his character bill because his character is such a complex character....you want to hate him love him, you laugh with him, he can be a control freak with his wives, he can be scary but i love his cut throat business deals where he will do what it takes to secure his very large family. he is already rich but he will get more if it means that he has to scam his way thru everything. that is what i love about the show is that he is such a greedy person. there are sad moments like episode where barb was going to be mother of the year. that is a very powerful episode. when you watch these episodes keep an open mind about the show. dont judge it right away till you seen all the stories. if you are looking for graphic sex scenes it has it here. barb doesnt really get naked but his other two wives nikki and margene do. barb does a lot of BJs in the show. i have no idea why she does a lot of that i mean she got butt naked for basic instinct go figure on that one. but for the most part....the stories are really good that looks into the polygamy world its a very disturbing world where you seen men with dozens of wives and the women in the compound have no real say. the men are total control freaks on the compound. but what i love about the show is how bill and his family try to intergrate with the rest of society but yet have to hide their family from the world because it is against the law. i also love the relationship between the wives its like there is a good one, an evil one and the bossy one. you get to see the jealous behavior when it comes to bill and how they join together to get what they want from bill. they can also be nutty too like when the wives were working out their wills or when nikki has a shopping addiction and it will cost the family loads of money. you will see for yourself what i am talking about. so what i am saying is that this is a great show. its worth buy. amazon does have it cheap here i seen in stores that they want 90 dollars for this collection i say they can keep it if its 90 dollars. if you are waiting for the price to go down that is understandable too. but its worth buy when you are ready to get your hands on it!

Fact is, I never would have watched the Soprano's had I not given it at least a few episodes. This one, I gave even more than that. I kept peaking in during the enitre season's run hoping my initial reactions were inconclusive. The first couple episodes, though they necessarily laid the groundwork, weren't very compelling. Even two of my favorite actresses, Jean Tripplehorn and Chloe Sevigny, weren't enough to maintain my attention through mundane dialogue and, ""who the heck cares"" plot lines. Bill Paxton proves why he'll always be on the B list of actors, and perhaps hoped that this show could resuscitate a not too aspring acting career. It doesn't. I suppose if one likes the ""excitement"" of something like, say, ""Desperate Housewives"", they may find this yawner of a program appealing, perhaps even moreso given cable's ability to take network ideas to unedited levels. I don't. This could be one of the most boring, most reaching for originality programs HBO ever produced. And I give HBO lots of latitude. This show had lots of casting imagination, but that's where the creativity ends. A program has to have some characters you care about. I suppose for the briefest of moments even this show has at least that much. But that's all I can say about it. Even the occasional romps in the hay, particularly those with Sevigny that cater to some male demographics, are few and far between. In fact, I imagine that was the idea around the table when HBO execs were coming up with the idea for this show- ""let's make use our cable outlets to one-up the networks steamy programming.""

The show actually takes a very even-handed look at what a polygamist family COULD be like: Paxton's family is far from perfect, but it seems to be held together by the sheer force of his character's love for all three of his wives.  Whether or not you think it is practical, feasible, or even moral for one man to genuinely love three women, on this show that's what's going on.This is balanced by some of the creepier, more cultish aspects of organized polygamy, personified by Harry Dean Stanton in a wonderfully understated villainous turn.Where the show really shines for me is in the depiction of the extremely complicated relationship Bill's three wives have with each other.  They see each other as sisters, as rivals, as friends, as enemies, as servants, as bosses . . . sometimes all within the same scene.  These are very deep relationships, and all three of the actresses are very well suited to their roles.Another fine aspect of the show is the depiction of how difficult it is for this family to keep the fact of their polygamy to themselves, lest they be looked upon as pariahs.  It is a difficult task for them, and has great practical and moral implications within their lives, and the lives of their children.Like most of HBO's original shows, this one works both as terrific entertainment, and as fundamentally sound art TV.  Also like most of HBO's shows, this box set is probably a bit more expensive than it ought to be.  But the episodes are terrific, and hopefully this will be merely the first season of a long run.",4,very worthwhile debut season,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,1774,"['big', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'fan', 'was', 'determined', 'watch', 'Big', 'Love', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed.The', 'series', 'been', 'criticized', 'glorifying', 'polygamy', 'think', 'critics', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'show', 'actually', 'very', 'even-handed', 'look', 'what', 'polygamist', 'family', 'COULD', 'be', 'Paxton', 'family', 'far', 'perfect', 'be', 'held', 'together', 'sheer', 'force', 'character', 'love', 'three', 'wives', 'Whether', 'not', 'think', 'practical', 'feasible', 'even', 'moral', 'one', 'man', 'genuinely', 'love', 'three', 'women', 'show', 'what', 'going', 'on.This', 'balanced', 'creepier', 'more', 'cultish', 'aspects', 'organized', 'polygamy', 'personified', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'villainous', 'show', 'really', 'depiction', 'extremely', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Bill', 'three', 'wives', 'have', 'other', 'see', 'other', 'sisters', 'rivals', 'friends', 'enemies', 'servants', 'bosses', 'sometimes', 'same', 'scene', 'are', 'very', 'deep', 'relationships', 'three', 'actresses', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'suited', 'roles.Another', 'fine', 'aspect', 'show', 'depiction', 'how', 'difficult', 'family', 'keep', 'fact', 'polygamy', 'lest', 'be', 'looked', 'pariahs', 'difficult', 'task', 'great', 'practical', 'moral', 'implications', 'lives', 'lives', 'children.Like', 'most', 'HBO', 'original', 'shows', 'one', 'terrific', 'entertainment', 'fundamentally', 'sound', 'art', 'TV', 'Also', 'most', 'HBO', 'shows', 'box', 'set', 'probably', 'bit', 'more', 'expensive', 'ought', 'be', 'episodes', 'are', 'terrific', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'merely', 'first', 'season', 'long', 'run']",N/A
1007122,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000GTLQVW,calvinnme,"[142, 156]","I have to admit that I didn't expect to like this HBO original series, but the intriguing cast of characters and the plotlines drew me in. ""Big Love"" is the story of Bill Hendrickson and his very extended family, including his three wives and seven children, who have to constantly be on the alert that they will somehow be ""outed"" by the community at large. This is important not only from a legal standpoint, but from a financial one, since Bill is part-owner with another polygamist in a budding chain of big-box home improvement stores, and thus preserving a stellar public image is important to the success of his business.Bill grew up on a compound of fundamentalist Mormons that still practice the principle of polygamy, and he was thrown out of the compound and his family when he reached adolescence and became perceived as competition for the affection of young girls who were coming of age. At this point, betrayed by his family and his religion, he turned his back on the teachings of his youth until his first wife Barb became gravely ill.Jeanne Tripplehorn portrays Barb, Bill's first wife and the sweetheart of his youth. You get the feeling that if he could, Bill would really like to ditch his other two wives and ride off into the sunset with Barb. Barb is a confident and educated woman who is very mindful of her own mortality due to having recovered from uterine cancer several years earlier. She is also very mindful of the fact that she must share Bill with her ""sister wives"" in order for Bill to abide by his conscience by ""living the principle"".Bill's second wife Nicki, portrayed by Chloe Sevigny, is the daughter of compound Prophet Roman Grant. Nicki is very much her father's daughter, calculating her every move, and always playing everyone in the family in order to get her own way. Her many stunts include running up a 58K credit card debt, and when the debt is discovered by Bill, pretending that she slept in a homeless shelter for a night to play the part of discarded wife in order to garner Bill's sympathy. In fact, she had spent the night at a comfy hotel. However, she is also capable of fierce loyalty and courage, going out into the street one night to confront her mentally off-balance brother, Alby, when he shows up in a menacing mood at the Hendrickson household, and also defending Barb against her passive aggressive sister's cutting remarks.Bill's third wife, Margene, is only 23 years old and is fighting feelings of being somewhat trapped since she already has two infant children and must spend most of her time alone since she cannot risk having anyone know the true nature of her arrangement with Bill. Nicki treats Margene like a personal assistant when she needs her, and like an errant child whenever Margene makes a mistake in judgement. Margene realizes her importance to the family, though, when she discovers Barb's youngest daughter feels guilty for submitting her own mother for mother of the year since she feels that Margene and Nicki are her mothers too and doesn't want them to feel left out.The main thread winding through this first season, though, is Bill's antagonistic relationship with Prophet Roman Grant, played to perfection by the superb Harry Dean Stanton. Stanton's portrayal of Roman Grant is chilling, as he comes across as part Tony Soprano and part Elmer Gantry. Roman has made a loan to Bill in return for a share in his business. However, Roman is overstepping his bounds and trying to collect revenue on the second of Bill's stores as well as the first. The entire season is about Bill's naive attempts to shed himself of Roman's shadow. Bill can't seem to learn the lesson that when you play hardball with a crazy man, the crazy man returns fire with Napalm. In many ways their season-long struggle seems like a long running Warner Brothers cartoon with Bill's Wile E. Coyote versus Roman's Roadrunner. In the season finale, the Hendrickson family's polygamous lifestyle is revealed to the world in the most unlikely and embarassing of venues. The final scene shows Bill sitting in the backyard, staring at his three houses, and pondering what he may have lost.Even the supporting roles are intriguing and performed with excellence. There are Bill's completely dysfunctional and bickering parents who would rather see each other dead than happy. Then there is Bill's brother Joey, a recovering addict and former football star, and Joey's wife, Wanda, who is devoted to Joey but has probably watched ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" one too many times. Finally, there are Bill and Barb's three children, who were not born into polygamy but are trying to find a way to have normal childhoods and also protect the family secret. I truly enjoyed this first season of ""Big Love"", and I can't wait to see where the second season takes matters.",5,An unexpected pleasure,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,4815,"['have', 'admit', 'did',

1007123,A15G4HQNY9TDOM,B000GTLQVW,"Daniel Middleton ""Publisher, 711 Press""","[1, 1]","I just watched the first season of Big Love on DVD, the HBO drama about a polygamous family in Utah trying to cope with the demands of such a life, while attempting to keep their polygamous ways hidden from the public. Bill Henrickson runs Henrickson Home Plus, an up-and-coming Utah-based competitor to giants such as Lowe's, Home Depot, and Wal-Mart. He has three wives, but only the first, Barbara Henrickson, is legally wed to him, while the other two are wives through religious practice. The wives take turns . . . uh, servicing Bill, with rotating shifts, so to speak (each wife shares a bed with Bill every third night, and the nights begin at 9:00 a.m.--it gets complicated).There are various rules associated with this lifestyle, including adherence to almost complete isolation from neighbors, co-workers who exist outside of the ""Principle,"" and anyone else for that matter. Bill has spread his wives and children out in three separate and abutting houses, and there is one big backyard shared between them. Every evening, Bill enters the same house, the one shared by him and his first wife, Barbara, despite whose shift it is. He will then head over to the house of one of the other two wives via the back entrance, if it is either of their shifts--this is done to avert suspicion. As the show progresses, the layers of the Henrickson household are slowly pealed away, allowing viewers to enter into the inner chambers of their unique belief system and practices. By the middle of the season, one will find oneself completely familiar with the characters, being privy to their secrets, their desires, and their fears.Bill's protagonist is wonderfully opposed by the sinister Roman Grant, a said to be ""prophet"" and the apparent head of the United Effort Brotherhood (UEB), a fundamentalist offshoot of the LDS church. Bill and Grant are bitter enemies, and the surprising ties between them, which are revealed as intriguing and important plot points throughout the season, help to keep things interesting, as these ties only lock them closer in combat. Both men go to various extremes to stick it to each other. Grant, meanwhile, has somehow managed to acquire a stake in Bill's two stores, earning 15% on each of them (what he believes is his due, in the form of ""tithes"" and ""offerings""). Bill intends to open up a third store, but his expansion is hampered by Grant's outstretched hand, as he aims to get a piece of that pie as well.The most appealing feature this show has going for it is its uniqueness. In a time when dramas and situation comedies have grown stale by repeating what has gone before, and in remarkably poor taste, Big Love seems to have captured lightning in a bottle, delivering a fresh, entertaining, and highly engrossing story about a family the likes of which has never been seen in this medium before.Definitely worth a look.",4,Original and Well-Conceived,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,2867,"['just', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'Big', 'Love', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'drama', 'polygamous', 'family', 'Utah', 'trying', 'cope', 'demands', 'life', 'attempting', 'keep', 'polygamous', 'ways', 'hidden', 'public', 'Bill', 'Henrickson', 'Henrickson', 'Home', 'Plus', 'up-and-coming', 'Utah-based', 'competitor', 'giants', 'such', 'Lowe', 'Home', 'Depot', 'Wal-Mart', 'three', 'wives', 'only', 'first', 'Barbara', 'Henrickson', 'legally', 'wed', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'wives', 'religious', 'practice', 'wives', 'take', 'turns', 'uh', 'servicing', 'Bill', 'rotating', 'shifts', 'so', 'speak', 'wife', 'shares', 'bed', 'Bill', 'third', 'night', 'nights', 'begin', '9:00', 'a.m.', 'complicated', 'are', 'various', 'rules', 'associated', 'lifestyle', 'including', 'adherence', 'almost', 'complete', 'isolation', 'neighbors', 'co-workers', 'who', 'exist', 'Principle', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter', 'Bill', 'spread', 'wives', 'children', 'out', 'three', 'separate', 'abutting', 'houses', 'one', 'big', 'backyard', 'shared', 'evening', 'Bill', 'same', 'house', 'one', 'shared', 'first', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'shift', 'will', 'then', 'head', 'house', 'one', 'other', 'two', 'wives', 'back', 'entrance', 'shifts', 'done', 'avert', 'suspicion', 'show', 'layers', 'Henrickson', 'household', 'are', 'slowly', 'pealed', 'away', 'allowing', 'viewers', 'enter', 'inner', 'chambers', 'unique', 'belief', 'system', 'practices', 'middle', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'completely', 'familiar', 'characters', 'being', 'privy', 'secrets', 'desires', 'fears.Bill', 'protagonist', 'wonderfully', 'opposed', 'sinister', 'Roman', 'Grant', 'said', 'be', 'prophet', 'apparent', 'head', 'United', 'Effort', 'Brotherhood', 'UEB', 'fundamentalist', 'offshoot', 'LDS', 'church', 'Bill', 'Grant', 'are', 'bitter', 'enemies', 'surprising', 'ties', 'are', 'revealed', 'intriguing', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'season', 'help', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'ties', 'only', 'lock', 'closer', 'combat', 'men', 'go', 'various', 'extremes', 'stick', 'other', 'Grant', 'meanwhile', 'somehow', 'managed', 'acquire', 'stake', 'Bill', 'two', 'stores', 'earning', '15', '%', 'what', 'due', 'form', 'tithes', 'offerings', 'Bill', 'open', 'up', 'third', 'store', 'expansion', 'hampered', 'Grant', 'outstretched', 'hand', 'get', 'piece', 'pie', 'well.The', 'most', 'appealing', 'feature', 'show', 'going', 'uniqueness', 'time', 'when', 'dramas', 'situation', 'comedies', 'have', 'grown', 'stale', 'repeating', 'what', 'gone', 'before', 'remarkably', 'poor', 'taste', 'Big', 'Love', 'have', 'captured', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'delivering', 'fresh', 'entertaining', 'highly', 'engrossing', 'story', 'family', 'likes', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'medium', 'before.Definitely', 'look']",N/A

I thought the idea was different, and I loved the tagline ""Polygamy loves company.""  Who else would have a show on polygamy but HBO?  After the first show, my mother couldn't make it through the episode (she needs something scandalous and racy to keep her attention, ie: Queer As Folk, The Sopranos, Nip/Tuck), but I loved it and wanted more.  Some people just can't get past the fact that the show is about polygamy - however, it doesn't promote it.. it simply shows you what life could be like.  The struggles of having three wives, three sets of kids, three houses, a well known business, and trying to uphold a public figure while hiding who you really are.  It's extremely interesting and addictive.If you're looking for something uber scandalous with lots of action and lots of drama packed in, you probably won't like 'Big Love.'  You definitely need to pay attention while watching this, and soon you'll find yourself loving to hate Nikki, hating to love Margene, loving Barb, sympathizing with Bill, and wondering when the next new episode is coming on.  It's a mellow drama - there's humor, sex, lies, betrayal - unlike other shows, it's not straight forward all the time.  A lot of the time they're trying to give you history, so that you can understand and know more.I say give it a chance.

The interaction between his three wives is much more enthralling, especially between the First Wife, who was the only wife in the beginning when they lived a life normal to most people, and the Second Wife.  The Second Wife (like Bill) grew up in the Compound, where the normal is clearly very different.  They represent the cultural clash between this very private religious world and the outside world.Power struggles, revenge, love, jealousy, ignorance, faith...this show is fascinating, especially since very few television programs use religious motivation on such a grand scale or dare to present something that is so outside the norm.Can't wait to watch Season 2!",4,Interesting Series,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1160,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'show', 'not', 'took', 'episode', 'three', 'really', 'pull', 'now', 'am', 'fascinated', 'lifestyle', 'other', 'family', 'one', 'issues', 'are', 'magnified', 'man', 'being', 'married', 'three', 'women', 'having', 'hide', 'situation', 'Not', 'only', 'marriage', 'Eternity', 'also', 'tensions.To', 'be', 'honest', 'Bill', 'Hendrickson', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'least', 'interesting', 'characters', 'interaction', 'three', 'wives', 'much', 'more', 'enthralling', 'especially', 'First', 'Wife', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'wife', 'beginning', 'when', 'lived', 'life', 'normal', 'most', 'people', 'Second', 'Wife', 'Second', 'Wife', 'Bill', 'grew', 'up', 'Compound', 'where', 'normal', 'clearly', 'very', 'different', 'represent', 'cultural', 'clash', 'very', 'private', 'religious', 'world', 'outside', 'world.Power', 'struggles', 'revenge', 'love', 'jealousy', 'ignorance', 'faith', 'show', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'very', 'few', 'television', 'programs', 'use', 'religious', 'motivation', 'grand', 'scale', 'dare', 'present', 'something', 'so', 'outside', 'norm.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'Season', '2']",N/A

I only watched the pilot and the next two episodes and that's going to be it. I was quite-bored right-away during the pilot and found nothing of interest, which continued. The acting was fine, but it was all just a dull soap opera (and any of those are the dregs in TV-land).Since this was all a surprise to me, I went into it with different expectations. From what I saw on one of the DVD cases, I believed it was going to be some sort of comedy/drame about difficulties of being a bigamist. I thought it would deal with the guy trying to keep it from the others wives somehow, while trying to raise multiple kids from multiple women and struggling to remain sane.I don't think that concept would have lasted many seasons, but I can't imagine how this one actually did. It's full of depressing moments right at the start that show complexities of relationships. Moments that one doesn't want to have in real life and are just annoying to watch. I found it all just very banal, dry, and too-serious (and not in a worthwhile way).This will get two stars, which means 'I don't like it'. There's little to even like in ""Big Love"", and I'm leaning more to one star, but that's tougher because if you pick that it means 'I hate it'.

1007140,AG7XI6B33D9QK,B000GTLQVW,Jeffrey S. Lybarger,"[0, 0]","I will never forget when HBO started airing commercials about a new series titled: Big Love. A show about polygamy and all the stresses that a family endures in that type of situation. It certainly piqued my curiosity and when the first episode aired in March of 2006, I was glued to my TV.Trying to sum up this series is truly difficult; it's so whacked, so out there, so beyond anything most of us could imagine, that it just pulled me in instantly! It is a series that has peaks and valleys and if you are like I am, and you get invested in the characters of a series, then you too will feel the things that these people - Bill, Barb, Nicki and Margie - had to deal with.The writers did a superb job and the actors - every single one of them - were absolutely fantastic! You have your villains, namely Roman Grant, his son Alby, Hollis Green and Frank, Bill's dad. You have some who were so deceitful and just downright mean that you would find it very difficult at times to like them at all, and those include Nicki, her mother Adaleen, and the young and quite talented Rhonda, played by Daveigh Chase and whose singing is on display in numerous episodes and her voice, unlike her character, was just Heaven sent. You also have characters who you just can't help but root for and you feel so sorry when anything bad would happen to them, like Margie and Cara Lynn.All that aside, Big Love was somewhat shocking, even for HBO, and it was as popular during its run as any series could have hoped to be. Thanks to Amazon Prime I was able to relive the series, all five seasons, only this time I didn't have to wait a week between shows or a year between seasons.If you were out of the country or didn't have HBO during this series' run, and if you love great drama that is written so perfectly and acted out even better, then Big Love is something that I feel you will fall in love with. I gave the first season a 5/5 stars, but the reality is the entire series is a 5/5 - or better yet - a 10/10!I really do miss the weekly drama that this show brought into our living rooms during its time, but they were smart and ended the series before it became too old, too clich&eacute;d or just boring.

I must say that this series is definitely different and its concept is amazing and original. HBO has really been hitting with their original series in the past years and Big Love is one of them. The series is based on a polygamist Bill Hendrickson (Bill Paxton) and his very big family. Bill has three wives, the first is Barb who Bill married 17 years ago, second is Nikki, and third is Margene who is also the youngest. The first wife basically holds the power over the other wives and a good amount of the tension in the series stems from that but still somehow they all love each other and act like sisters. In all reality why would someone want more than one wife or husband, I mean it has a few benefits but a ton of complications and the series shows both.Bill has children with all of his wives for a total of seven kids. Thanks to the big bucks rolling in from His growing chain of home improvement stores he was able to buy each of his wives a home in the same neighborhood right beside each other in beautiful suburban Utah. Unfortunately for Bill and his family Polygamy is very illegal in Utah and banned by the Mormon Church. Somehow he got very lucky and picked a mostly Mormon based neighborhood that is always on polygamist watch but bill is always just slipping by his nosey neighbors. The family spends time together just like a regular family and each wife loves one another and takes care of each other as if they're married to each other and not Bill. They have a schedule so Bill can spend time with everyone equally and also share love, which is made clear in episode two. In a lot of ways Big Love is very easy to get but in many it is hard like trying to explain how every character has a story. His wife Nikki who is the daughter of a very dysfunctional man called the prophet who is also the sick villain of the series.Not only does Bill have worries about his own family a little comedy and drama comes in with his two crazy parents. They are also polygamist and live on a fundamentalist compound that is basically an enclosed to the world polygamy community ran by none other than Nicki's father Roman but best known to everyone as The Prophet. For some reason mostly everyone in the community loves Roman but they don't know about his dirty secrets. When your watching the series you'll wonder why The Prophet and his buddies get to roll around in very new hummers. Nobody knows about Bill being a polygamist except for his friend who is also one and the people of the compound but his secret starts to leak more and more through the episodes.This series doesn't really seem to be trying to put points across about polygamy but more giving viewers a good show with a thought provoking concept. The acting is fantastic and I saw no weak links in this first season. The characters that pulled me in the most were Margene (Gennifer Goodwin) because she is the most fragile of all the wives and has the most normal past. Also Ben Henrickson (Douglas Smith) who is bill's son but he's having a terrible time trying to stay true to his morals and keep a normal teenage life which is mainly keeping his hot girlfriend happy but him and those morals are at a constant battle. Big love does shine a somewhat bright light on polygamy and a lot of people may be against this way of living but this still is a great show and a hilarious one too. This series is definitely one that will get you addicted to see how this family defeats a money hungry prophet, nosey people, and worst of all temptation.Season 1 Episodes, 01 Pilot, 02 Viagra Blue, 03 Home Invasion, 04 Eclipse, 05 Affair, 06 Roberta's Funeral, 07 Eviction, 08 Easter, 09 A Barbecue for Betty, 10 The Baptism, 11 Where There's A Will, 12 The Ceremony",5,Hate It Or Love It,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,3826,"[""'m"", 'reviewing', 'series', 'not', 'DVD', 'get', 'information', 'will', 'add', 'later', 'must', 'say', 'series', 'definitely', 'different', 'concept', 'amazing', 'original', 'HBO', 'really', 'been', 'hitting', 'original', 'series', 'past', 'years', 'Big', 'Love', 'one', 'series', 'based', 'polygamist', 'Bill', 'Hendrickson', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'very', 'big', 'family', 'Bill', 'three', 'wives', 'first', 'Barb', 'who', 'Bill', 'married', '17', 'years', 'ago', 'second', 'Nikki', 'third', 'Margene', 'who', 'also', 'youngest', 'first', 'wife', 'basically', 'power', 'other', 'wives', 'good', 'amount', 'tension', 'series', 'still', 'somehow', 'love', 'other', 'act', 'sisters', 'reality', 'why', 'would', 'someone', 'want', 'more', 'one', 'wife', 'husband', 'mean', 'few', 'benefits', 'ton', 'complications', 'series', 'both.Bill', 'children', 'wives', 'total', 'seven', 'kids', 'Thanks', 'big', 'bucks', 'rolling', 'growing', 'chain', 'home', 'improvement', 'stores', 'was', 'able', 'buy', 'wives', 'home', 'same', 'neighborhood', 'right', 'beside', 'other', 'beautiful', 'suburban', 'Utah', 'Unfortunately', 'Bill', 'family', 'Polygamy', 'very', 'illegal', 'Utah', 'banned', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'Somehow', 'got', 'very', 'lucky', 'picked', 'mostly', 'Mormon', 'based', 'neighborhood', 'always', 'polygamist', 'watch', 'bill', 'always', 'just', 'slipping', 'nosey', 'neighbors', 'family', 'time', 'together', 'just', 'regular', 'family', 'wife', 'one', 'care', 'other', ""'re"", 'married', 'other', 'not', 'Bill', 'have', 'schedule', 'so', 'Bill', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'everyone', 'equally', 'also', 'share', 'love', 'made', 'clear', 'episode', 'two', 'lot', 'ways', 'Big', 'Love', 'very', 'easy', 'get', 'many', 'hard', 'trying', 'explain', 'how', 'character', 'story', 'wife', 'Nikki', 'who', 'daughter', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'man', 'called', 'prophet', 'who', 'also', 'sick', 'villain', 'series.Not', 'only', 'Bill', 'have', 'worries', 'own', 'family', 'little', 'comedy', 'drama', 'two', 'crazy', 'parents', 'are', 'also', 'polygamist', 'live', 'fundamentalist', 'compound', 'basically', 'enclosed', 'world', 'polygamy', 'community', 'ran', 'none', 'other', 'Nicki', 'father', 'Roman', 'best', 'known', 'everyone', 'Prophet', 'reason', 'mostly', 'everyone', 'community', 'Roman', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'dirty', 'secrets', 'When', 'watching', 'series', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'Prophet', 'buddies', 'get', 'roll', 'around', 'very', 'new', 'hummers', 'Nobody', 'Bill', 'being', 'polygamist', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'people', 'compound', 'secret', 'starts', 'leak', 'more', 'more', 'episodes.This', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'put', 'points', 'polygamy', 'more', 'giving', 'viewers', 'good', 'show', 'thought', 'provoking', 'concept', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'saw', 'weak', 'links', 'first', 'season', 'characters', 'pulled', 'most', 'were', 'Margene', 'Gennifer', 'Goodwin', 'most', 'fragile', 'wives', 'most', 'normal', 'past', 'Also', 'Ben', 'Henrickson', 'Douglas', 'Smith', 'who', 'bill', 'son', 'having', 'terrible', 'time', 'trying', 'stay', 'true', 'morals', 'keep', 'normal', 'teenage', 'life', 'mainly', 'keeping', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'happy', 'morals', 'are', 'constant', 'battle', 'Big', 'love', 'shine', 'somewhat', 'bright', 'light', 'polygamy', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'living', 'still', 'great', 'show', 'hilarious', 'one', 'too', 'series', 'definitely', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'addicted', 'see', 'how', 'family', 'money', 'hungry', 'prophet', 'nosey', 'people', 'worst', 'temptation.Season', '1', 'Episodes', '01', 'Pilot', '02', 'Viagra', 'Blue', '03', 'Home', 'Invasion', '04', 'Eclipse', '05', 'Affair', '06', 'Roberta', 'Funeral', '07', 'Eviction', '08', 'Easter', '09', 'A', 'Barbecue', 'Betty', '10', 'Baptism', '11', 'Where', 'A', 'Will', '12', 'Ceremony']",N/A

1007152,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000GTLQVW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[34, 39]","HBO has crafted another complex, well made show.  ""Big Love"" with it's polygamy background hits DVD as a ""hot button"" concept show, and as such has achieved the requisite controversy that it was banking on.  Well, I'm not particularly shocked and nor will I comment on any political/religious debate.  I will review this show as a family drama, which is exactly what it is, albeit with a particularly large and extended family.The show is extremely successful when dealing with the intricacies of raising three families in the modern world.  I particularly enjoyed the details paid to the lifestyles in the home.  The juggling, scheduling, jealousies, and secrets are all shown to good effect as the wives attend to the daily logistics of their situation.  Home as politics--this is an interesting living arrangement, and one that hasn't been presented dramatically very often before.  Throw in kids and in-laws and things can be very messy.  But as the wives compete with each other in many regards, they support and love each other as well.  The complexity of the relationships in ""Big Love"" stand as it's greatest achievement.Some of the other storylines were a bit extravagant.  The biggest plot driver involved the polygamist sect that our family had distanced itself from, and yet could not break free of.  The power struggle played out here was entertaining, but not always as compelling as normal, everyday life.  It was a bit overcooked....while a few lesser storylines were undercooked.The actors are beyond reproach.  Some veterans--Harry Dean Stanton, Mary Kay Place, Bruce Dern and Grace Zabriskie--are all used to good effect.  Chloe Sevigny is a delight in perhaps the showiest role.  The rest of the cast is solid.  But I must make particular mention of Jeanne Tripplehorn.  She's been around such a long time, but has never had a better role or performance.

1007153,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000GTLQVW,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[6, 9]","HBO knows a thing or two about good television and Big Love is no exception.  The show focuses on a fictional Utah family headed up by Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton).  Bill is the proprietor of Henrickson's Home Plus, a home improvement store that is modeled similar to Lowe's and Home Depot.  He is also the master of three homes all in a row on a quiet suburban street... and the three wives who inhabit them.Bill's first wife, Barbara, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, is the woman in charge as far as this family is concerned.  Called ""Boss Lady"" by the other wives, she is in charge of the family budget, has a job outside the home, and is the only wife that Bill acknowledges publicly.  We learn in the first episode that it is Barb's bout with cancer that caused Bill to doubt his religious choices and make the decision to start living ""the principle"" (or engage in polygamy).Nicki Grant, played by Chloe Sevigny, is Bill's second wife. Nicki is a fundamentalist Mormon with the looks to go with it.  As Barb mentions once, Nicki's long braided hair, long dresses, and lacy, high-collared clothes basically scream ""I'm engaged in polygamy."" Nicki's father, Roman Grant, is the leader of the United Effort Brotherhood, the Mormon compound Bill was exiled from as a child.  Coming from a family that taught her the best thing you can do is relinquish material wealth and going on to marry a successful man who has left the church, it's no wonder that Nicki develops a slight shopping addiction.The third and final wife, Margene, is played by Ginnifer Goodwin.  Margene is the most removed from the polgygamist lifestyle and was not raised a Mormon.  Accordingly, she is at times in over her head and overwhelmed by the life she married into.  At only 23 years old, Margene has two small sons and a house, but no car, no job, and no friends besides Barb and Nicki.  Throughout the season, she struggles to find her place in the family.Big Love is more than the story of the Henricksons, but also about family in general.  Watching this show, their struggle becomes your struggle and no matter what your initial thoughts about polygamy, I think you'd be hard-pressed not to like this show.  I went into it with eyes wide open and was completely surprised by how much I wound up liking it.  My only problem is the price of the DVD boxed set. $100 retail and even $60 on sale is a little steep for 12 episodes.  Even if you bought them on the internet they'd likely only be $2 an episode, so paying 2.5 times that seems a bit ridiculous. Especially considering that the only DVD extras are previews and recaps for each episode and a behind the scenes look at the filming of the title sequence. Besides that, I'd still recommend watching this show.  I can't wait for the second season to begin airing on HBO, but I might be smarter this time around and just tape them.",4,Polygamy loves Company,1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,2865,"['HBO', 'thing', 'two', 'good', 'television', 'Big', 'Love', 'exception', 'show', 'fictional', 'Utah', 'family', 'headed', 'up', 'Bill', 'Henrickson', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Bill', 'proprietor', 'Henrickson', 'Home', 'Plus', 'home', 'improvement', 'store', 'modeled', 'similar', 'Lowe', 'Home', 'Depot', 'also', 'master', 'three', 'homes', 'row', 'quiet', 'suburban', 'street', 'three', 'wives', 'who', 'inhabit', 'them.Bill', 'first', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'played', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'woman', 'charge', 'as', 'far', 'family', 'concerned', 'Called', 'Boss', 'Lady', 'other', 'wives', 'charge', 'family', 'budget', 'job', 'home', 'only', 'wife', 'Bill', 'publicly', 'learn', 'first', 'episode', 'Barb', 'bout', 'cancer', 'caused', 'Bill', 'doubt', 'religious', 'choices', 'make', 'decision', 'start', 'living', 'principle', 'engage', 'polygamy', '.Nicki', 'Grant', 'played', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Bill', 'second', 'wife', 'Nicki', 'fundamentalist', 'Mormon', 'looks', 'go', 'Barb', 'mentions', 'once', 'Nicki', 'long', 'braided', 'hair', 'long', 'dresses', 'lacy', 'high-collared', 'clothes', 'basically', 'scream', ""'m"", 'engaged', 'polygamy', 'Nicki', 'father', 'Roman', 'Grant', 'leader', 'United', 'Effort', 'Brotherhood', 'Mormon', 'compound', 'Bill', 'was', 'exiled', 'child', 'Coming', 'family', 'taught', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'relinquish', 'material', 'wealth', 'going', 'marry', 'successful', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'church', 'wonder', 'Nicki', 'slight', 'shopping', 'addiction.The', 'third', 'final', 'wife', 'Margene', 'played', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Margene', 'most', 'removed', 'polgygamist', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'not', 'raised', 'Mormon', 'Accordingly', 'times', 'head', 'overwhelmed', 'life', 'married', 'only', '23', 'years', 'old', 'Margene', 'two', 'small', 'sons', 'house', 'car', 'job', 'friends', 'Barb', 'Nicki', 'season', 'find', 'place', 'family.Big', 'Love', 'more', 'story', 'Henricksons', 'also', 'family', 'general', 'Watching', 'show', 'struggle', 'becomes', 'struggle', 'matter', 'what', 'initial', 'thoughts', 'polygamy', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'not', 'like', 'show', 'went', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'was', 'completely', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'wound', 'up', 'liking', 'My', 'only', 'problem', 'price', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', '100', 'retail', 'even', '60', 'sale', 'little', 'steep', '12', 'episodes', 'Even', 'bought', 'internet', ""'d"", 'likely', 'only', 'be', '2', 'episode', 'paying', '2.5', 'times', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'Especially', 'considering', 'only', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'previews', 'recaps', 'episode', 'scenes', 'look', 'filming', 'title', 'sequence', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'watching', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'begin', 'airing', 'HBO', 'might', 'be', 'smarter', 'time', 'around', 'just', 'tape']",N/A

Bravim,"[2, 2]","Big Love - The Complete First Seasonis not a show that grabs hold of viewers from the opening scenes, like aNip/Tuck - The Complete First SeasonorEntourage - The Complete First Season. Instead, this carefully woven and superbly written series builds, slowly, but gracefully. Aside from main character Bill Henrickson being a polygamist, it is not an unconventional family drama. He has problems with in-laws, parents, children and either or all of the three wives. What makesBig Love - The Complete First Seasoninteresting is not polygamy itself, but any number of intricate, rich relionships in what surely is HBO's most underrated series.Bill is a succussful business owner and survivor of an FLDS compound not unlike those of the infamous Warren Jeffs. He married the strong, lovely Barb and lived a very normal life with three children for a dozen years. It was after this time that Bill received ""testimony,"" an ancient Mormon calling from God to consider the 'principle' of plural marriage. It was then that he married Nikki, the daugher of the compound leader and prophet Roman Grant. Just a year or two before the show begins Bill adds a third, young wife; former HomePlus employee Margine, easily the most naive and likable of the bunch. There are already seven children and more on the way.Bill and the family live in three connected houses just outside Salt Lake City, a few hours from the compound he grew up in and now despises. There is an excellent supporting cast and each episode in the first season stands up nicely on first and second viewings. There is sex in this series (it is HBO) but it is never gratuitous or pornographic. Do not expect any lesbian or group action, this is a righteous, prayful family that just happens to embrace a taboo principle in Western culture.Mormons need not take offense, most of the neighbors are LDS members who strongly frown upon polygamy.

This is a pretty interesting show about an individual named Bill Henrickson (played by Bill Paxton) who has three spouses and seven children, all whom live in the same household. However, very few in the outside world seem to know of this and Bill and his family are hoping to keep it that way. Will they succeed?There is probably a very good chance that this show will raise eyebrows with individuals who are strongly adversed to polygamy. I personally could care less one way or the other, but so far, the show has won me over for the following reasons: a) I couldn't help but notice the presence of Amanda Seyfried, who I had seen and liked in a couple of movies a while back, and only wish would appear in more things. In Season One of ""Big Love,"" the performer plays Bill Henrickson's eldest daughter Sarah, who seems to have her own opinions regarding polygamy; b) there is a scene where a couple of employees in a fast food restaurant are discussing their music interests and one of them says something about liking jazz, and (having a strong attachment to the genre myself) that sort of thing will make or break a TV show, movie, cartoon, or soap opera for me; and c) one is treated to some particularly amusing lines by the performers. I don't know why, but a close friend of mine and I just couldn't help but cackle like a couple of chickens at the part where one of the restaurant workers says... well, unfortunately, I can't write it here word-for-word, but it is the kind of line that one doesn't forget anytime soon. Despite the humor of what is said, there is a message behind it, which if taken seriously could cut down on the number of undesired pregnancies and STIs dominating the country as of this moment.The only thing for which I would subtract points is the episode consisting of an elderly man ejecting bodily fluids into a sink, the same one that is supposed to have no other use besides washing dishes. They actually show this and it just seemed somewhat unsanitary. Other than that, I would say give this TV show a try, unless of course you have strong beliefs against polygamy. One thing that would be better, though, is if there were a little more than just 12 episodes.

1007181,A2M6YQ9IXI0TIO,B000GTLQVW,"Risa Brannon ""bird girl""","[0, 0]","When I first heard about the premise of this show my immediate reaction was, &#34;Ugh!&#34;  Polygamy as a family drama just sounds so creepy.  I can see why it gets negative reactions from the Mormon community, too.  This program specifically portrays one family who, as the writers take pains to point out, is *not* representative of the norm.  Still, I also recognize subtle and not-so-subtle suggestions of an overall cultishness, and the lines are blurred as to whether the writers are aiming their commentary at this particular family or the community as a whole.The characters are very well defined.  Bill Paxton (as Bill, the main character and patriarch of this family) - portrays a man who is fundamentally very decent, loving, and principled.  But he is simply overwhelmed because he has bitten off much more than he can chew.  Three wives is a lot of wives, and I've lost track of how many children.  The wives themselves are archetypal.  Barb (the first wife played by Jeanne Tripplehorn) is the eldest and seems to be the one with the strongest connection with her husband.  Nicki, second wife, (Chloe Sevigny) is a bit younger, perhaps.  She is a darker, more brooding character, but has an admirable strength and ability to cope with all sorts of practical matters.  Margene,(Ginnifer Goodwin)  the third wife, is little more than a teenager, already with a baby on her hip.  She is spontaneous and effervescent and seems to be aching to rebel against the strict rules that govern her family life.  All three of the women are in love with and dedicated to Bill.  The most extraordinary thing to me is this:  Bill is completely committed to and in love with all three women. (And he does his best to keep up with the physical demands by popping Viagra like gumdrops.)I should mention that there is a formidable villain in this story:  Roman Grant (Harry Dean Stanton).  He is deliciously and maddeningly evil and seems to have tentacles spread throughout the community.  He also happens to be the father of Nicki, Bill's second wife, which helps to complicate matters. Bruce Dern as Bill's derelict father is almost too vile to believe, but believe it I do because he's so well scripted and so well portrayed.I find that by the end of an episode I am left hanging in suspense.  &#34;What will happen if. . .?&#34;  So it keeps me hooked on that level.  But I also find myself caring about the characters in unexpected ways.  I see the decency in Bill and realize that he is truly trying to &#34;Live The Principle&#34; against all sorts of obstacles.  I care about Barb, who as first wife is a kind of older sister-mother to the other two wives and does her best to overcome her own frustrations having to share the man she loves.

(Section 132 of Doctrine and Covenants is officially subtitled this way: ""Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, recorded July 12, 1843, relating to the new and everlasting* covenant, including the eternity of the marriage covenant, as also plurality of wives."")Harry Dean Stanton's character, Roman, is patterned directly on the Mormon ""prophet"" Joseph Smith, who nowadays would be rightly known as a charlatan and a creepy child molester. In the episode where Roman explains to a couple of news reporters, via a mural, the history of Mormonism, he's telling the exact truth: It is a cult of personality, founded upon the ludicrous belief in certain ""golden tablets"" unearthed and ""interpreted"" -- via ""sacred spectacles""(!) -- by the child molester/polygamist Joseph Smith. There's just no way around it, because that's what they profess to believe. Roman merely goes the whole nine yards in his Mormon fundamentalism. Sure, the Mormon church has tried to distance itself from its roots, because they know full well how bizarre it is to non-cultists. They'd rather sweep it under the rug and focus on so-called ""family values"".It's scary, weird, very sad and, yes, painfully comical to see grown adults in the 21st century embracing any of this. The characters are all acting from within this cult mindset, and the actors do an excellent job.*Well, perhaps not so ""everlasting"", as the Mormons deferred (officially, anyway) to the Federal government as it threated to withhold statehood for Utah.
