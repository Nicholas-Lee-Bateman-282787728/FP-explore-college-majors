There were no spiritial discernment in that Bapist Church. Not&#65279; even 1 person saw with their spiritial eyes the evil that was happening within the church. Therefore, this is how Christian cults are formed.

1214330,A1CHM200OEN65X,B001LIP8O8,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[8, 8]","We've seen it before, right? Half of the modern renditions of serial killers include religious motifs, with the cross, the Bible, and so on. As Steve Taylor once said in a song, ""A Christian can't get equal time, unless he's a loony committing a crime.""In ""Dangerous Calling,"" the loony committing a crime is indeed a church-going person, but the Daws Brothers refuse to let you settle into any expectations. The murder before the opening credits sets up a cat-and-mouse game in Small-Town, USA, when a young pastor and his wife show up to fill a position at a church torn by inner strife. The strife is instigated by one person: high-tithing, manipulative Miss Pat.This is one lady you won't forget after seeing this film. She is certifiable and creepy, and yet on the surface she wants only the best for her church, her community, and her son. She quickly realizes that her ""best"" doesn't match with the new pastor's or his wife's, and this leads to increasing tension that turns creepy, then downright pulse-pounding. The misguided and delusional dreams of Miss Pat push her and her son to violent measures, and the young pastor's wife is son caught in their web.It's hard to describe the levels of psychological suspense employed, because they are done so well. From TVs and phones, to snakes and chickens, all sorts of devices ratchet the tension while never neglecting character development and some tightly plotted scenes. At the end of this movie--once my heart was done pounding!--I sat back and realized that in a world full of religious extremists and Bible-toting psychos, we get a glimpse here of that deadly sickness compared to those who have Godly love for others.""Dangerous Calling"" is an extremely entertaining movie. It's also a call to Christians to stop complaining about the stereotypes and to start changing them by the way we live. This is one of those rare films that works both as psychological suspense and spiritual challenge.

1214333,ASVY2J1ICVB5U,B001LIP8O8,miditrax,"[0, 1]","Christian film - pretty good, if somewhat in-your-face gruesome, with one violent act committed in the first 5-10 minutes.Horror film - Okay, middling. Not as violent as ""Saw"" or as suspenseful as a Hitchcock or spy thriller. One can see through most of the plot holes.There are certain conventions in a Horror movie, like the setting, chases, and endings, that this film utilizes. I kept yelling at the screen for the protagonists to resist, fight, stop whimpering, moaning, screaming and run, or just to wake up and come to their senses. A lot of these situations bordered on the clich&eacute;d, like when somebody discusses the rumors circling around an antagonist, or one character chases another throughout the town, yet it's all a red herring, a fake.I don't usually like Horror but ordered this movie because of its take on church politics, and in that I wasn't disappointed. I didn't like the blood (I never do, close my eyes, but that's me personally) or the over-the-top violence at the end.The characters - colorful, if a bit clich&eacute;d. The creepy-sweet yet controlling Miss Pat and her 'strange' offspring, the wants-to-get-along yet stands-by-his-convictions Pastor, his God-fearing yet spirited wife, the caring yet somewhat clueless Youth minister.The setting - A small-town Baptist-type church, but the music, much of the dialogue, etc. was a bit too 'Christianized' for my taste. The 'Rock music' that Miss Pat rails against was guitar-led hymns and choruses with bongos. And her compound, a chicken farm set deep in the woods, with no cellphone reception? By the time I got to the end I was thinking of films like 'The Shining', which had a similar ending.The issues - The main one IMO was Miss Pat's agenda vs. the true function of the church, which is to worship God and welcome others into His fold. Instead this small church with a large building, set in its ways, focuses on being a 'country club' for its own, a fortress against the encroaching world. The trouble with that is that mindset excludes the very people you are trying to reach, thus the decline in attendance, the generational drift and the attempts by the previous Pastor to modernize by hiring a Youth minister. The one thing about Miss Pat being the 'meddler' is that in real life she would not have controlled the church alone, but probably would have a whole faction in the church on her side, with others opposing her group, leading to a church scandal or split.Overall, not bad...but not very thrilling or realistic, either...",3,a Horror/Christian hybrid?,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,2524,"['Christian', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'somewhat', 'in-your-face', 'gruesome', 'one', 'violent', 'act', 'committed', 'first', '5-10', 'minutes.Horror', 'film', 'Okay', 'middling', 'Not', 'as', 'violent', 'Saw', 'as', 'suspenseful', 'Hitchcock', 'spy', 'thriller', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'most', 'plot', 'are', 'certain', 'conventions', 'Horror', 'movie', 'setting', 'chases', 'endings', 'film', 'kept', 'yelling', 'screen', 'protagonists', 'resist', 'fight', 'stop', 'whimpering', 'moaning', 'screaming', 'run', 'just', 'wake', 'up', 'come', 'senses', 'lot', 'situations', 'bordered', 'clich', 'eacute', 'when', 'somebody', 'rumors', 'circling', 'antagonist', 'one', 'character', 'town', 'red', 'herring', 'fake.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'like', 'Horror', 'ordered', 'movie', 'take', 'church', 'politics', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'blood', 'never', 'do', 'close', 'eyes', 'personally', 'over-the-top', 'violence', 'end.The', 'characters', 'colorful', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'creepy-sweet', 'yet', 'controlling', 'Miss', 'Pat', ""'strange"", 'offspring', 'wants-to-get-along', 'yet', 'stands-by-his-convictions', 'Pastor', 'God-fearing', 'yet', 'spirited', 'wife', 'caring', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'clueless', 'Youth', 'minister.The', 'setting', 'small-town', 'Baptist-type', 'church', 'music', 'much', 'dialogue', 'etc', 'was', 'bit', 'too', ""'Christianized"", 'taste', ""'Rock"", 'music', 'Miss', 'Pat', 'rails', 'was', 'guitar-led', 'hymns', 'choruses', 'bongos', 'compound', 'chicken', 'farm', 'set', 'deep', 'woods', 'cellphone', 'reception', 'time', 'got', 'end', 'was', 'thinking', 'films', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'had', 'similar', 'ending.The', 'issues', 'main', 'one', 'IMO', 'was', 'Miss', 'Pat', 'agenda', 'vs.', 'true', 'function', 'church', 'worship', 'God', 'welcome', 'others', 'fold', 'Instead', 'small', 'church', 'large', 'building', 'set', 'ways', 'focuses', 'being', ""'country"", 'club', 'own', 'fortress', 'encroaching', 'world', 'trouble', 'mindset', 'very', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'reach', 'thus', 'decline', 'attendance', 'generational', 'drift', 'attempts', 'previous', 'Pastor', 'modernize', 'hiring', 'Youth', 'minister', 'one', 'thing', 'Miss', 'Pat', 'being', ""'meddler"", 'real', 'life', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'controlled', 'church', 'alone', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'whole', 'faction', 'church', 'side', 'others', 'opposing', 'group', 'leading', 'church', 'scandal', 'split.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'very', 'thrilling', 'realistic']",Dangerous Calling
1214334,A1NNQ5LS8YU3AF,B001LIP8O8,Robert J. Ruhf,"[0, 0]","""Dangerous Calling"" is a thriller that is set within the context of church politics.  A young minister and his wife arrive to take charge of a small town church shortly after its former pastor is murdered (though most people believe that his death was an accident).  It doesn't take long, however, for the minister and his wife to realize that there is more going on than what meets the eye.  At first, it doesn't seem like the church is different from any other church.  As elsewhere, there are those who are working for change and who want to reach out to the surrounding community.  There are also those who don't want change and who see community ""outsiders"" as threats to the well-being of the church.  But how far will those who don't want change go to protect the status quo?  In this church, it is deadly far!  I am surprised that this film has not gotten more attention than it has.  ""Dangerous Calling"" presents a realistic picture of the battles for control that can take place within churches, but then takes it up a notch by setting those battles within the context of a tense thriller that builds as the story progresses.  The characters are complex and realistic, and the ugliness of church politics is not watered down.  For a low-budget film, ""Dangerous Calling"" is very well done.",5,"""I have to kill the weak ones so the flock will stay strong.""",1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,1298,"['Dangerous', 'Calling', 'thriller', 'set', 'context', 'church', 'politics', 'young', 'minister', 'wife', 'arrive', 'take', 'charge', 'small', 'town', 'church', 'shortly', 'former', 'pastor', 'murdered', 'most', 'people', 'believe', 'death', 'was', 'accident', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'however', 'minister', 'wife', 'realize', 'more', 'going', 'what', 'eye', 'first', ""n't"", 'seem', 'church', 'different', 'other', 'church', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'working', 'change', 'who', 'want', 'reach', 'out', 'surrounding', 'community', 'are', 'also', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'who', 'see', 'community', 'outsiders', 'threats', 'well-being', 'church', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'go', 'protect', 'status', 'quo', 'church', 'deadly', 'far', 'am', 'surprised', 'film', 'not', 'gotten', 'more', 'attention', 'Dangerous', 'Calling', 'realistic', 'picture', 'battles', 'control', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'churches', 'then', 'up', 'notch', 'setting', 'battles', 'context', 'tense', 'thriller', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'realistic', 'ugliness', 'church', 'politics', 'not', 'watered', 'down', 'low-budget', 'film', 'Dangerous', 'Calling', 'very', 'well', 'done']",Dangerous Calling
