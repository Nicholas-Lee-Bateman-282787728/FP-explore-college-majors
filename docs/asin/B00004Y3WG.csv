Cooper ""possum""","[3, 5]","Suburbia is based on a real group of Los Angeles punk rockers who lived together in 1980 and 1981, called The Connected (TC); however, only the most superficial aspects of their life are touched upon in this movie. The characters are not portrayed with any kind of depth, and the overall feel of the film is one of exploitation.That said, punks don't have a lot of movies that speak to their experiences, so I suppose this one will have to suffice.",2,Okay for what it is... but it could have been much more,1003881600,"10 24, 2001",2001,448,"['Suburbia', 'based', 'real', 'group', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'punk', 'rockers', 'who', 'lived', 'together', '1980', '1981', 'called', 'Connected', 'TC', 'however', 'only', 'most', 'superficial', 'aspects', 'life', 'are', 'touched', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'kind', 'depth', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'one', 'said', 'punks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'movies', 'speak', 'experiences', 'suppose', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'suffice']",N/A

Anyway it's great that it's on DVD now. The picture quality is really good but the commentary sucks a bit. Penelope seems she's not sure what she's seeing or even talking about? It would be great to have the other ""punks"" comment on it or even some kind of ""special reunion"" mini-documentary on the ""TR kids"" but no, nothing. Or what ever happened to Ethan that little punk kid on the Big Wheel. There is a commentary by one of the girls but it wasn't Maggie Ehrig or the other punk girl.I grew up in L.A in the 70s and 80s and the movie is accurate but NOT 100% accurate on the L.A. punk life. What I mean is that in 1983 it was a time that the second wave of L.A. punk scene was already dying and devolving into something else. During those times there were also other L.A. gangs (both Latinos, cholos and whites I.E. Stoners, metal heads) with their own lifestyle, philosophy, and fashion statements that clashed with the punks but this movie doesn't seem to indicate that. It was just rednecks against the punks ..or the police against the punks or the ""regular normal"" people agaainst the punks. But nowhere in this movie shows a fight with any latino gang bangers, the hippie long haired crowd, skinheads or even from other punk gangs?! Or riding on the RTD bus and being harrassed because you had green hair or challenged to a fight with another gang member from a different gang! I remember punks never sitting in the back of the bus unless they want to get their behind kicked! Being lectured in junior high school by the teachers because you had spiky hair and wearing a ripped Black Flag t-shirt.. Yes growing up as a punk in L.A was dangerous and at times you would have to come across other gang members that didn't like your look or clothes and a fight would ensue. That's why it was never a cool idea to walk alone in L.A. as a punk especially in other gang territories.

557723,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00004Y3WG,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[36, 42]","Disinfected youth...er, I mean disaffected youth...for each generation there seems to be a film out there to relate the rebellious, discontented, estranged, insurgent, anarchistic elements within said generation...the 50's presented us with Marlon Brando as The Wild One, the 60's came forth with Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda in Easy Rider, the 70's brought us Roller Boogie with Linda Blair (okay, maybe that's not the best example, but then the 70's were pretty lame), and the 80's brought Suburbia (1984)...written and directed by Penelope Spheeris (The Decline of Western Civilization, Wayne's World), the film stars Chris Pedersen (Night of the Comet), along with a bunch of people you've probably never heard of who's only acting credit is this film (Spheeris used a lot of `real life kids' instead of actors, assumingly to present the story as realistically as possible).  There's one other notable person appearing in that of a very young Flea (a wee flea?  I know, I know, that's pretty lame), from the band The Red Hot Chili Peppers, credited as Mike B. The Flea (his real name is Michael Peter Balzary).The film begins with a pretty shocking scene that seems to have little to do with anything (later we'll see it's sort of a metaphor, as there's quite a few throughout), and then cuts into a scene of a teenage boy named Evan difficulties within his home life that lead to him running away (moms is an angry drunk), wandering the streets of L.A.  Evan soon falls in with a group of homeless teens who call themselves T.R., short for The Rejected, lead by Jack Diddley (Pedersen), at least he appears to be the leader as he seems the oldest and the only one with a car.  The teens live among a condemned series of houses, and survive by begging or stealing what they need from residents in nearby populated neighborhoods (here's a tip if you live in L.A. near the airport...keep your garage door closed, as an open door is an invitation to roving gangs to come in and take whatever isn't nailed down).  The tax-paying residents, who are feeling the frustrations stemming from the effects of Reaganomics (various plants have closed down, forcing many out of work), are growing increasing angry at the kids and their antics, and also at the police for their ineffectual manner in dealing with the situation (the residents do have a valid argument in this, as the police in this film really don't seem to do much of anything).  As a result, the more redneck elements of the residents decide to take matters into their own hands, trying to scare off the homeless kids with forceful tactics, with pretty predictable consequences (i.e. someone gets killed).This isn't a happy film...there are a few funny moments, but there's an overall nihilistic sense to the story.  As the movie progresses, we get some insight on where the kids come from, the circumstances that led them to where they're at now, along with the antagonistic attitudes they must face on a daily basis of a society that doesn't want them, and doesn't know how to deal with them.  They don't appear to be bad, as they formed their own little family unit, relying on each other for some basic needs, but more products of circumstances out of their control, left to their own devices, surviving anyway they can (much like the wild dogs that roam the area where the kids live)...the style of direction matches the attitude of the material on the screen very well, appearing very raw, unfocused, lacking the polish one would normally see theatrical release.  As I said, many of those appearing are not professional actors, so the performances may appear amateurish, but I think that's the intent.  The dialogue is pretty simplistic, but then this also serves to further highlight the pragmatic nature of the story.  There's no candy coating interpretations, no buffoonish characterizations, only a raw, warts and all, glimpse into a world many of us would probably not have had a chance to experience.  I've read some opinions that state you really need to be a fan of punk rock (there's some great performances by bands like T.S.O.L., The Vandals, and D.I.) to appreciate this film, and while I think it would really help, I don't necessarily agree with the exclusivity of those sentiments (I was actually indoctrinated to punk music back in the late 80's when I found a Dead Kennedy's cassette for sale at a used record shop).  I think most all can enjoy a good film, especially one that offers viewers a chance to understand a segment of the population that appears so completely foreign.  You may not gain any real insight, or even develop a liking where there might have originally been a disliking (people often despise what they don't understand), but I think one can appreciate, at the very least, the effort to give a voice to those who few would listen to otherwise.I really wanted to give this release 4 stars, but the picture quality, presented in full screen (it states `digitally remastered' on the case), pan and scan format looks pretty rough, much like that of a VHS tape.  It would have been nice if someone had sprung to clean it up a bit, and release it in the original aspect ratio, but this is a Roger Corman release, and he seems not so inclined to spend any more than necessary than he has to (cheap b@stard)...the DVD does contain a few interesting special features, including a commentary track by writer/director Spheeris, along with brief biographies of Corman, Spheeris, and Pedersen, original and alternate theatrical trailers (the film was originally titled Rebel Streets), and some trailers for other Corman releases including one for Saint Jack (1979) and Piranha (1978).  If you liked this film, check out a movie called Over the Edge (1979), featuring Matt Dillon in his first, feature role, not yet on DVD.Cookieman108",3,"""What are you all dressed up for?

557725,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00004Y3WG,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[2, 3]","""Suburbia"" is a rather interesting film that paints a much different perspective on the life of street punks who are often branded as `major undesirables' and how the central characters often are at major odds with the `normal' suburban establishments.The story begins with a very disturbing scene involving stray dogs but then cuts to the story of a highly disillusioned adolescent named Ethan whose life is utter hell with his unpleasant mother (who's become a very angry alcoholic) who runs away from home in search of a better life. Later he is taken in and becomes a part of a large gang of rowdy punk rockers. Later in the movie we see a whole barrage of scenes of the lifestyles of the punk rockers in their `alternate' lifestyle in a run down home.At first the movie seems to be directed at a more of a `trailer trash' society but at the same time, it is actually a much more socially-conscious insight into the broken home lifestyle and also questions the way that the authoritarian side of normal society (police, politicians, businessmen, and a large sector of the normal people) treats the youth and what causes the gang act the way they do but also the wild behavior of these individuals. The `normal' side of the movie showcases them as `dangerous to society' and need to be dealt with by any means necessary yet the `alternate' part of the movie showcases the `normal' society as repressive towards the different lifestyle of the gang and how that the cultures between them and the establishment can barely even coexist without major confrontations.My take on this I could not write in stone. I first saw this movie in a social problems class so I couldn't help but want to write my side on this. I sometimes think that both sides are victims as well as perpetrators of the problems of the community. The victims are the people whove been harmed or worse, lost their lives. The `normal' side of society seems more victimized by the vandalism by the gang who spray offensive graffiti on the store walls and on buildings yet the punk rockers themselves seem to be victims of the repressions of the authoritarian nature of the established society by being threatened with being evicted from their dilapidated home due to the increasing property value and while the neighborhood that they live in is rather tired, the increasing property value is viewed by them as an assault on their livelihood by the `rich folks'. That's my interpretation.This is a very interesting movie and am very glad to have stumbled upon it. It has a very unique kind of appeal to it in the way it shows the varying perspectives of the many characters. In ways, some of the `anti-punks' who are a pair of middle-aged trailer trash men commit worse acts than what the punks did. The ending is rather suprising and kind of depressing yet it is so sudden that it dilutes the emotional quality.The movie, as good as it is, was not very well made. Yes, the movie is very good for a cheap low-budget movie but the scenes are a bit blurry and the sound quality is also muffled. The acting is also quite campy but it's interesting how a lot of the actors and actresses never acting an any movies since this time.The DVD itself offers NO improvement on the old VHS release from the early 1980s. The biggest disappointment is that the picture and sound quality are utterly ATROCIOUS and makes the movie look much older than it really is. Sure movies from around 1984 may have a rather gritty appearance in their original look but ""Suburbia"" suffers immensely from the really gritty picture quality especially during nighttime scenes. The sound quality is also a bit muffled. Compared to some special editions of lets say ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""The Godfather DVD Collection"" which the new versions sounds like a heavy towel is lifted off the television speakers, this one sounds garbled and the combination results in a movie that looks and sounds dated as hell.Other than the ancient sound and look of the film, ""Suburbia"" is a really good but very obscure little treasure that may not be picked up by most people's radars.

We grew up in NY, but we felt for some reason as though we belonged in California.  It's great to see Suburbia again after all these years with commentary by director Penelope Spheeris to boot.Penelope Spheeris used real kids as opposed to seasoned actors.  As a result, the movie has a genuine punk rock vibe, although the acting is nothing to write home about.  Listening to the director's commentary, one learns the ins and outs of how and why certain aspects of the film occur.  She took a lot of events taking place at that time and incorporated them into the script, such as the wild dogs in the beginning of the movie.  One thing that I am kinda bummed out about is how she seems to be a bit embarassed by the movie.  She almost makes excuses at times.  Yes, the scene in which the two men shoot the wild dogs is a bit hard to stomach and we all know that that type of scene would never make it into a movie today.  But that is one of the aspects that I love about Suburbia.  It's a low budget, honest, straight out of the 80's movie.  Penelope Spheeris should be 100% proud of it.The music and live concert footage is great.

This is a film that UNDERSTANDS alienation, and why kids who were intelligent enough to see past the lies they'd been fed and the distractions intended to placate them felt so disenfranchised.  We see kids who've come from broken homes...whose parents don't understand the world their kids are living in...who are, in essence, The Rejected.  Conventional society rejects them...so they, in turn, reject conventional society.  As a punk rocker, this film has always struck a chord with me because of that very reason.  What do you do, after all, when you realize that your parents are full of (...)?  When you realize that your teachers are full of (...)?  What do you do then?  What CAN you do?  This film relates the story of a group of young people who became easy scapegoats in their community.  When something goes wrong, it's easy to blame the outsiders, isn't it?  It's so easy to point the finger at people who already DON'T FIT.  That is what this film portrays so honestly, and so plainly.  True, the acting is sub-par...but who cares?  This film's insight is enough to carry it.  And there are beautiful moments throughout, mainly fueled by Flea's performance as Razzle.  I can't count the times I've uttered the immortal line ""Happy Easter, ***hole"" in various convenience stores across the Midwest.  And the scene in which Chris Pederson says ""Where's that house, Flea?"" and Flea responds to the question...then adds, about thirty seconds later, ""Hey, my name's Razzle, man"" is priceless.  This film was not afraid to show off, even PARADE, its flaws.  And what makes it so perfect, so real, was Penelope Spheeris's use of real punk rock kids in this film, as opposed to actual ACTORS.  She sums it up best in her own personal philosphy...""It's easier to teach punks to be actors than it is to teach actors to be punks.""",5,Insight.........,1008892800,"12 21, 2001",2001,1997,"['What', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'most', 'punk', 'rock', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'accomplish', 'give', 'real', 'insight', 'why', 'punk', 'movement', 'happened', 'why', 'HAD', 'TO', 'happen', 'film', 'UNDERSTANDS', 'alienation', 'why', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'see', 'lies', ""'d"", 'been', 'fed', 'distractions', 'intended', 'placate', 'felt', 'so', 'disenfranchised', 'see', 'kids', 'who', ""'ve"", 'come', 'broken', 'homes', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'world', 'kids', 'are', 'living', 'who', 'are', 'essence', 'Rejected', 'Conventional', 'society', 'so', 'turn', 'reject', 'conventional', 'society', 'punk', 'rocker', 'film', 'always', 'struck', 'chord', 'very', 'reason', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'realize', 'parents', 'are', 'full', 'When', 'realize', 'teachers', 'are', 'full', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'then', 'What', 'CAN', 'do', 'film', 'story', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'became', 'easy', 'scapegoats', 'community', 'When', 'something', 'wrong', 'easy', 'blame', 'outsiders', ""n't"", 'so', 'easy', 'point', 'finger', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'FIT', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'honestly', 'so', 'plainly', 'True', 'acting', 'sub-par', 'who', 'film', 'insight', 'enough', 'carry', 'are', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'mainly', 'fueled', 'Flea', 'performance', 'Razzle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'times', ""'ve"", 'uttered', 'immortal', 'line', 'Happy', 'Easter', '***hole', 'various', 'convenience', 'stores', 'Midwest', 'scene', 'Chris', 'Pederson', 'Where', 'house', 'Flea', 'Flea', 'question', 'then', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'later', 'Hey', 'name', 'Razzle', 'man', 'priceless', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'off', 'even', 'PARADE', 'flaws', 'what', 'so', 'perfect', 'so', 'real', 'was', 'Penelope', 'Spheeris', 'use', 'real', 'punk', 'rock', 'kids', 'film', 'opposed', 'actual', 'ACTORS', 'sums', 'up', 'best', 'own', 'personal', 'philosphy', 'easier', 'teach', 'punks', 'be', 'actors', 'teach', 'actors', 'be', 'punks']",N/A

To my delight (ew), I found a really awesome movie to watch over and over. It's the kind of movie that has unintentionally funny parts, for instance, the opening scene. I don't want to give much away, but let's just say that something tragic happens, but the effects are so low-budget,  it is laughable. But that doesn't lessen the quality of this film. The movie is about a teenage boy named Ethan, who runs away from his abusive, alcoholic mother and younger brother . He has nowhere to go, and then he follows some kids he sees to a punk rock show, and then befriends a older kid named Jack. He takes Ethan to the squat him and his friends live in called the TR house (TR stands for ""The Rejected"") . There all the kids who didn't belong anywhere else or had no where else to go stay, and become the only family they will ever really know or want.  They are so dedicated to each other, they brand the TR logo on their flesh like cattle. Now that's Punk Rawk!!! The transformation of Ethan, and then his little brother, whom Ethan later takes away from his mom after she gets arrested, is amazing. Just the image of not even a ten year old boy on a big wheel with a mowhawk and an army jacket is to me breathtaking.  Also look out for Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame) as one of the kids living in the TR house.Most of the movie is about how these kids couldn't get along well in their own houses, but together they can survive. And the cops understand their ways more than the townspeople do in this movie.  It's a pretty cliche story plot, but it still works as an original movie.Penelope Spheeris has always been a big name director in the punk and metal scene. She directed all the Decline of Western Civilization movies, and even the Wayne's World pics. She knows how to film punk rock shows. In this movie, when the bands (TSOL, Vandals, et.c) play, she knows how to capture the flow of the crowd.  And people might say the acting in this movie is bad. But just keep in mind that Penelope had real punk rock kids in this movie. So they were not actors playing punks, they were punks being actors!The best way to see this movie is the DVD version, with widescreen. The commentary with Penelope Spheeris is good. She reveals a bit of secrets from the set. Did you know that the kids really did sleep and live at the TR house during filming?Oh, and one thing to check in the movie that they do not reveal in the commentary, which I hoped they would.  In one scene,  the actor playing Jack calls Flea by his his real name; not his characters' name!Enjoy watching Suburbia! Don't compare this movie to SLC Punk. At least these kids were real punks!

So, why four stars if it was so crappy?  Because of what the film was about!  Predictability aside, this movie captures the essence of Punk.  Not just &quot;punk rock&quot; mind you.  If you're just lookin' for the &quot;rock&quot; part of punk, go throw on a Blink 182 or Sum 41 (whats with the numbers by the way?) album, 'cause thats as close as you're gonna get!  Punk was, is, and always will be a way of life.  The scene may be all but dead in this country right now, (thanks to the afore-mentioned bands killing the very essense of the the movement) but to those who understand what it is and why it was will always follow it.  Its not a philosophy, its a way of life.  And it can't be explained on paper, or even in film for that matter.  It has to be experienced...wether you're a poor kid from nothing, kickikng ass in the pit, or a suburban brat, sick of everyone's B.S. around you and just hoping you find something better to connect with, Punk is a way of life that speaks louder than the music it comes with!  This movie, along with some of the British and American documentaries, is the closest thing I've ever seen to capturing that feeling of what we've decided to call Punk.  The characters, what little we know about them, they're music, the people who are against them, and the fact that they only have each other, and aren't willing to give that up for nothing, are the very things that has kept the Punk scene alive all these years, despite the so-called &quot;posers,&quot; etc., butting they're ugly lil heads in trying to claim it as they're own.  Wether you're a punk, or a skinhead, or even, since the 90s anyway, a goth, hardcore kid, grunge-type druggie person (you know what i mean!), if you get this movie, then chances are you don't need some silly review to help you undertstand why this film was so important. To the rest of you out there...you're on your own.

It shows how self-righteous and ignorant parents can be of their own children's pain and isolation, even though usually they caused it themselves.If you have yet to see this movie, be aware that the end will catch you off guard.

557746,A5UMUVEV1RUS9,B00004Y3WG,SuperJenn,"[3, 3]","My 4-star rating is for the movie itself. Suburbia was a pleasant surprise. I don't remember seeing this in the 80's, and honestly, I grabbed it off the shelf by accident (I was thinking of a movie I wanted called Crime & Punishment in Suburbia) but after watching it, I was certainly happy I'd made a mistake. Suburbia is about a group of teens who are rejected from their homes for various reasons, and our main character has an alcoholic mom who can barely take care of him or his younger brother so he leaves to try to lighten her load and winds up running around with other forgotten youths who call themselves The Rejected, or T.R. for short. It's not a happy-ending tidy kind of film, so don't think this is some shiny happy people living in suburbia thing. It's not, but it shows us a different perspective and aspect of life. The kids have learned how to adapt to survive, living in abandoned homes that have long been forgotten about and getting their groceries in a way most of us would never imagine (which is one of my favorite parts and I'll say no more as not to spoil it). Great live punk performances and and interesting story really hold Suburbia up. The acting seems a little amateur in parts but to me can be easily overlooked. Great movie, and my only complaint is the transfer. It's crappy, to be polite, though there's a different word I'd rather use to describe it. If you can get past the poor transfer quality, and the description of the movie sounds interesting to you, check it out.
