42804,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,0783113196,Amazon Customer,"[6, 7]","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It is fascinating to imagine a lost tribe of Indians living in an isolated wilderness, and having had no contact with White society since the 19th century.  The story is well told, and the chemistry between Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey is good.  It's also intereting to imagine oneself in the shoes of Berenger's or Hershey's character, knowing that if the existence of this lost tribe were to be revealed to the world at large, it would mean the end of their way of life.  The only two big plot holes that hurt the story is, first, that with our knowledge of genetics, we know that a tiny, isolated population comprises too limited a gene pool to sustain a viable population in the long run, and will eventually suffer the effects of inbreeding if they don't get an infusion of genetic material from outside (i.e. the lost tribe will be doomed anyway, and will ultimately degenerate and die out like the Norse colony in Greenland did).  And the second (spoiler warning) is that when Barbara Hershey's character chooses to remain with the Cheyenne, she's leaving behind a life in the civilized world, friends and family who will miss her, and students who knew that she went off alone into the wilderness with Tom Berenger's bounty hunter, and that she was at least slightly suspicious of him when she set out.  When he comes back and she doesn't, it is almost certain that people would suspect foul play, and mount a search for her, and that could lead them to the lost tribe of Cheyenne.  If she really wanted to protect them from discovery, she'd need to leave them and return to her own society.",4,A fascinating premise and a well told story,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,1637,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'imagine', 'lost', 'tribe', 'Indians', 'living', 'isolated', 'wilderness', 'having', 'had', 'contact', 'White', 'society', '19th', 'century', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'good', 'also', 'intereting', 'imagine', 'shoes', 'Berenger', 'Hershey', 'character', 'knowing', 'existence', 'lost', 'tribe', 'were', 'be', 'revealed', 'world', 'large', 'would', 'mean', 'end', 'way', 'life', 'only', 'two', 'big', 'plot', 'holes', 'hurt', 'story', 'first', 'knowledge', 'genetics', 'know', 'tiny', 'isolated', 'population', 'comprises', 'too', 'limited', 'gene', 'pool', 'sustain', 'viable', 'population', 'long', 'run', 'will', 'eventually', 'suffer', 'effects', 'inbreeding', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'infusion', 'genetic', 'material', 'outside', 'i.e', 'lost', 'tribe', 'will', 'be', 'doomed', 'anyway', 'will', 'ultimately', 'degenerate', 'die', 'out', 'Norse', 'colony', 'Greenland', 'did', 'second', 'spoiler', 'warning', 'when', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'character', 'remain', 'Cheyenne', 'leaving', 'life', 'civilized', 'world', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'will', 'miss', 'students', 'who', 'knew', 'went', 'alone', 'wilderness', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'was', 'least', 'slightly', 'suspicious', 'when', 'set', 'out', 'When', 'back', ""n't"", 'almost', 'certain', 'people', 'would', 'suspect', 'foul', 'play', 'mount', 'search', 'could', 'lead', 'lost', 'tribe', 'Cheyenne', 'really', 'wanted', 'protect', 'discovery', ""'d"", 'need', 'leave', 'return', 'own', 'society']",N/A

42809,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,0783113196,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","Movie - 5 starsDVD - 3 stars, maybe even 2This film about a modern cowboy and a beautiful anthropologist who find an isolated camp of Cheyenne living in the remote mountains is full of charm, excitement, and mystery. It is filmed in some of the most majestic and gorgeous scenery in the world. Tom Berenger is spot on as the rugged, understandably self-destructive outdoorsman initially ordered into the wilderness to find and return three escaped convicts. The movie, however, is stolen by his dog Zip. As ""Doc"" observers at one point, ""It's disconcerting to realize that the smartest member of our expedition is a dog!"" As we watched this film again with friends last night, one of them observed, ""Well, here's your earlier version of Avatar"". It was meant as a joke, but he did have a point. As our two modern heroes begin to assimilate into the hostile tribe of Cheyenne, they learn a respect for the people and their culture that engenders in them a need to protect it. It is a stunning, moving film, and I recommend it without reservation.The actual DVD presentation is another story, however. Produced in 1995, it was before the popular era of theater-wide big screen TVs. I'm sure it looked beautiful in its letterbox format on a smaller screen, but on our 55"" theater-wide set the picture was just OK. It was always grainy in the way that happens when a lower resolution image is magnified, and the wide screen image had a very wide black margin on all four borders (not just top and bottom as you'd expect in a letterbox presentation at 2.35 to 1). Your eyes adjust, but that's not really the same thing as a top of the tech transfer. This is a film that deserves a good blu-ray transfer, but is highly unlikely to get it, as the sales demand probably is just not there.The prices for this out of print DVD on Amazon are outrageous.

42826,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,0783113196,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[73, 83]","December 5, 2008: I just finished watching the DVD version and it is fantastic.  Most exciting for me was learning that my Master's Degree (Native American Studies) adviser, Dr Henrietta (Whiteman) Mann, was the Cheyenne consultant on the film.  I am negotiating to keep the DVD that I got to watch, but I will definitely be updating my review before the end of the year.--KarlJanuary 18, 2011:  Having just watched ""Last of the Dogmen"" on DVD (for the tenth time) I wanted to add a few words on the differences between the DVD and the VHS versions of the show.  The VHS is in full screen format while the DVD is in wide screen format; however, on a wide screen TV the picture has black bars on the top, bottom and sides, which means that one could set it to be full screen if so desired.  The DVD also allows you to turn off the voice over and has bonus material: 1) a Director's commentary, 2) an Original Costume Sketch Gallery, 3) the Original Theatrical trailer and TV spots, and 4) three featurettes: ""The Story,"" ""Building the Cheyenne Village,"" and a ""Behind the Scenes"" montage. All of the bonus features are very good, in my opinion, while the commentary does add some insight on the film.--KarlAs a former professor of Native American Studies, I have been asked numerous questions about this thought provoking, well photographed (although I wish they would actually film movies about Montana, in Montana), and touchingly portrayed movie.  After reading many of the reviews, including the editorial reviews, I find myself compelled to write my own review; and have waited this long only in hopes of viewing the DVD version first.  But, after two years of unanswered letters to the production company requesting that the movie be re-released, I purchased the VHS version.  To the best of my knowledge, the primary difference, which is unfortunate, is that the VHS version is full screen.First off, I can not comment on what the producers/director/writer were thinking or intending to accomplish with this film; I can only comment on what I think about the film as I view it.  And, as such, let me start by stating that the movie is NOT ABOUT Cheyenne Indians, Dog Soldiers, bounty hunters, or Montana.  The movie IS NOT a western, a historical film, a cinema that ""pours 'Dances with Wolves' syrup into some parallel copy cat fashion,"" or an escapist adventure.What the movie IS, as stated to those listening, is a modern day legend; a fanciful, romantic tale told in ""campfire"" tradition.  The movie IS a story being told--not acted out or portrayed--to the viewer; it IS AN ORAL tradition, rendered in cinematic format.  As an oral story, then, the ""irritating, tacked-on voice-over narration that somebody must have thought was necessary to make sense of the story (it wasn't),"" is in fact an intrinsic component of the movie experience: the viewer is listening to the story teller and imagining the story in their mind.  Equally important, the story teller tells us--the listener/viewer--that the events may or may not be so (i.e., true).  It is from this context--of, what if it were true--that the content of the tale opens up to juxtaposing history and wish-fullness into one beautiful, touching story.In the tale of the ""Last of the Dogmen,"" Lewis Gates (Tom Berenger's character) is repeatedly described in reviews as a bounty hunter, which clearly is not the case.  I can only suppose that the fact that Gates is being hired (or that Dr Lillian Sloan (Barbara Hershey's character) sarcastically calls him a bounty hunter), somehow implies this, but anyone paying attention to the story can see that he is given a badge and Gates is an experienced back country guide (for which Montana has many such men and women).  Such individuals are frequently part of search and rescue operations, and, when required, paid well for their work.  I find Berenger's portrayal as such a person very accurate, and true of the one or two I personally know.  As for the ""Oxbow"" region of Montana, I can only suppose that this is a quirky reference to the ""Oxbow Incidence,"" and the use of the term to refer to a ""U"" shape bend in a river.  Based upon other comments in the movie, I must assume that the movie is supposed to take place from the western part of Glacier National Park (where Logan Pass is located) to the Kootenai Forest; while the town of Yaak, Montana, could be the town portrayed in the movie.  Are there rugged parts of Montana where few people go? Yes--especially the region I just described.  Can someone hide there for long periods of time?  Yes; just look at Biathlon World Championship Kari Swenson's story (""Abduction"" (aka The Abduction of Kari Swenson) (VHS Tape - 1989); or 'Mountain men' case captured national attention, By GAIL SCHONTZLER, (Bozeman, Montana) Chronicle Staff Writer).However, the character I most related to--and I suppose why so many ask me about the movie--is Dr Lillian Sloan (Barbara Hershey's character).  Her love and respect (yes, I was disgusted with the fact that she was in charge of an archaeological ""dig"") for Native American cultures is nothing less than a reflection of myself.  Is everything she states accurate? NO.  Accuracy, in true non-Native American ""campfire"" tradition, is surrendered to what sounds best.  Then again, without this bending of the truth, the premise of the tale is lost: survivors of the Massacre at Sand Creek ""escaped"" to northwestern Montana (which Hershey's character fairly well summarizes; also, see my review of ""Soldier Blue"" for comments on this massacre).  Again, this is a ""trick"" of campfire tales: in 1864, there were literally only a few hundred non-Native Americans living in Montana, not the other way around!  Moreover, there were no Dog Soldiers (a fraternal/men's social organization found among the Cheyennes and other tribes--although Wikipedia claims they were a band) at Black Kettle's encampment at Sand Creek; nor was Lone Wolf, a revered TRIBAL--not band--leader,  present at the Sand Creek Massacre in southeast Colorado.  To answer a question raised in another review, Dog Soldiers did not ""pin"" themselves to be the last one's fighting (as suggested by Hershey's character, Dr Sloan), BUT frequently acted as a rear guard during moves.  In fact, there were many survivors at Sand Creek (but all were Southern Cheyenne/Arapaho Indians, not Northern Cheyenne--who reside in southeast Montana), not just a few as alleged by Dr Sloan (Hershey's character) in the movie.  There was another mens society, frequently referred to as Contraries, that did ""pin"" themselves to be the last one(s) fighting (which is alluded to in the movie during Gate's dream), but they were as rare as they have become colorful in stories.  Dog Soldiers--most likely because of their name--have been stereotyped by the media for centuries, as as such are a convenient group to tell stories about.  To the movie's credit (albeit, mistakenly so most likely), they use the name Dogmen instead of Dog Soldiers.  Lastly, I did not find Dr Lillian Sloan's (Barbara Hershey's character) interest in the Cheyenne to be ""swooning over the 'noble savages'.""  I find her actions to be just what I would do, given the chance to find myself back in time when traditions were unchanged by European influences.  Nor do I feel that the portrayal of the Cheyennes is stereotypical or romantic.While the movie, like all movies, has flaws that detract from the film, Hershey and Berenger give wonderful performances, and the movie is one that will stand the test of time as a great form of entertainment, that can be watched over and over (hopefully on DVD soon).As one final note, I would welcome any questions concerning the Cheyennes, one of four Native American nations I have studied for over 30 years.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

Reviewers are often the lowest of the low, incapable of independent thought, and certainly incapable in the creative process. How many of them could make a film? (Sorry for the rant.)A film like this appeals to the better side of our nature, and offers rare rewards. The viewer would have to be capable of enjoying a fantasy, and falling in synch with the director's intention. I've seen reviews by prickly and vaguely prejudiced people, reacting to the alleged revisionist message that white man - bad and Indian - good. No, this movie is a fantasy, supposing the existence of a survived Cheyenne tribe and held in great value by the two white people making the discovery. Naturally, their goal becomes to preserve and protect something of rare and incalculable value from our exploitive world.This film is very moving, and stands up to repeated viewings. It should have been wildly popular, but was stopped by the same people who promoted Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Fortunately, when purchasing DVDs, we have a forum like this.

A tribe of Cheyenne manage to survive for a century deep in the American wilderness isolated from the rest of the world, all the while maintaining much of their traditional lifestyle.  Thanks to Lewis Gates (Tom Berenger) that all could change.  After three fugitives he's been hired to track down meet a mysterious death, he becomes convinced that there may actually be Indians out there.  So along with Dr. Sloan (Barbara Hershey), an anthropologist who's devoted her life to the study of the Cheyenne, he sets out to find whatever is out there.  And find it he does, and nearly gets killed because of it.  However, presumably because Dr. Sloan can speak passable Cheyenne, they, unlike all of the other outsiders who have encroached on the Cheyenne's territory, are allowed to live.  They become, therefore, witnesses to an unreal spectacle, a real and functioning traditional Indian village in modern America.  But when Lewis Gates returns to civilization in order to obtain medication for an ailing Cheyenne, he obtains this medication in such a way that a posse is formed in order to track him down, and, just as importantly, find out what it is that he's out in the wilderness he's looking for.  As such, something that he's come to value--the Cheyenne and their traditional ways--has potentially become compromised because of his 1) typical Anglo-European need to explore, investigate and understand the unknown, and 2) typical Anglo-European lack-of-concern-for-consequences problem-solving techniques.  But, of course, everything does turn out right in the end.Overall, Last of the Dogmen is an entertaining movie.  My only real complaint is that more time should have been devoted to the Cheyenne village, and I think the lack of development of bonds between Lewis Gates and Dr. Sloan and the Cheyenne detracts somewhat from the movie.Still, in the end, a movie very much worth seeing.",4,Interesting movie that could have been better *spoilers*,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1919,"['only', 'were', 'true', 'tribe', 'Cheyenne', 'manage', 'survive', 'century', 'deep', 'American', 'wilderness', 'isolated', 'rest', 'world', 'while', 'maintaining', 'much', 'traditional', 'lifestyle', 'Thanks', 'Lewis', 'Gates', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'could', 'change', 'three', 'fugitives', 'been', 'hired', 'track', 'down', 'meet', 'mysterious', 'death', 'convinced', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'Indians', 'there', 'So', 'Dr.', 'Sloan', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'anthropologist', 'who', 'devoted', 'life', 'study', 'Cheyenne', 'out', 'find', 'there', 'find', 'nearly', 'killed', 'However', 'presumably', 'Dr.', 'Sloan', 'can', 'speak', 'passable', 'Cheyenne', 'other', 'outsiders', 'who', 'have', 'encroached', 'Cheyenne', 'territory', 'are', 'allowed', 'live', 'become', 'therefore', 'witnesses', 'unreal', 'spectacle', 'real', 'functioning', 'traditional', 'Indian', 'village', 'modern', 'America', 'when', 'Lewis', 'returns', 'civilization', 'order', 'obtain', 'medication', 'ailing', 'Cheyenne', 'medication', 'such', 'way', 'posse', 'formed', 'order', 'track', 'down', 'just', 'importantly', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'out', 'wilderness', 'looking', 'such', 'something', 'come', 'value', 'Cheyenne', 'traditional', 'ways', 'potentially', 'become', 'compromised', '1', 'typical', 'Anglo-European', 'need', 'explore', 'investigate', 'understand', 'unknown', '2', 'typical', 'Anglo-European', 'lack-of-concern-for-consequences', 'problem-solving', 'techniques', 'course', 'everything', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'end.Overall', 'Last', 'Dogmen', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'more', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'Cheyenne', 'village', 'think', 'lack', 'development', 'bonds', 'Lewis', 'Gates', 'Dr.', 'Sloan', 'Cheyenne', 'somewhat', 'movie.Still', 'end', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'seeing']",N/A

What more could a film lover ask for?The plot revolves around a Montana tracker, named Lewis Cates, who believes there to be a lost tribe of Native American in the wilds of Montana. In fact, legend had it that a tribe of Cheyenne had been swallowed up by the Montana wilderness sometime towards the end of the nineteenth century and never heard from nor seen again. A loner with some personal issues, Cates teams up with Professor Lillian Sloan, an anthropologist and professor of Native American studies who happens to speak the language of the Cheyenne and is familiar with their customs. Together, they go off exploring in the remote and  vast, breathtaking  woodlands of the American Northwest, looking for this lost tribe. It is there that the Cheyenne find them, rather than the other way around.Tom Berenger is perfectly cast as the rugged tracker, and he gives a low key, commanding performance.  Barbara Hershey, one of the best, though most under rated, actresses around, gives a simply superlative performance. Through her one gets a sense of the wonder she feels at the opportunity that has presented itself to her. It is a chance of a life time to get to know a people who remain uncorrupted by the influence of other cultures. It is an opportunity to live a piece of history. There is a profound respect for people and their customs that she radiates, as befitting a serious anthropologist. There is also a budding romance between Cates and Sloan, which Berenger and Hershey pull off well, as it seems to be a romance that is founded on mutual respect.Those who play the roles of the Native Americans are excellent, with special kudos to those who play the characters Lone Wolf and Yellow Wolf. These roles are played with a certain dignity and stoicism that lend an air of authenticity to their existence in the film. Their humanity is palpable, making it believable that Sloan and Cates would want to stay with them and share in the simplicity of their lives. Last, but certainly not least, mention must be made of director Tab Murphy, who beautifully directed this most memorable of films. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

42850,A2ZSC81MXLBELX,0783113196,"L. Shirley ""Laurie's Boomer Views""","[112, 113]","This review refers to the HBO DVD edition of ""Last Of The Dogmen""...""Last of the Dogmen"" is a beautiful story that takes my breath away everytime I watch it. It's one of those films that even if you start out viewing it alone, pretty soon, you'll find the rest of the family gathered around simply because one glimpse of the scenery,one paragraph of the dialouge,one look at the story and it's got a hold on you.It's a modern Western, with all the romantic adventure of one that may take place 100 years ago. Lewis Gates(Tom Berenger) is a bounty hunter hired to track three deadly criminals who have escaped deep into the ""Oxbow"" of the Montana wilderness. As he follows their trail, he begins to uncover a 100 year old mystery. One of the clues is an arrow that could only have been used by a tribe of Cheyennes that existed over a century ago.He can't let go of what the possibilities may be and convinces the beautiful Dr Lillian Sloan(Barbara Hershey), expert in Native American culture, that there may be something incredible out there. Their search begins as they try to uncover the past, and what they find is a way of life too beautiful to be spoiled by modern day man and it is up to them to save it!It's just an incredibly beautiful film that interweaves the search for the past with Gates' own ghosts from his past. The friendships formed,the evolving romance, the cinematogrpahy, the musical score, and the heartwarming story all combined for a wonderful film.Even ""Zip"" the dog(played by ""Zip""), will be tugging at your heart.Berenger and Hershey worked beautifully together, and Steve Reevis and other American Indian actors were not only wonderful but lent a great deal of realism and authenticity to the film...Bravo!The DVD presents a wonderful widescreen picture, taking in all the majesty of the Rockies. The DD5.1 is very good. The sounds of nature and the modern day sounds of helicopters and such, are quite a contrast to behold in surround sound.The DVD also has some nice features. It may be viewed with the sound in either the Theatrical version, or the Director version. Both are in DD5.1, and the main difference I found was that the Theatrical version has the captivating narration by Wilfred Brimley,and the Director's version does not. There is the option of Director(Tab Murphy) commentary, and it also provides subtitles in English, French and Spanish for those needing them.There are other features that include, cast bios and costume sketches as well.If you liked ""Dances With Wolves"", give this one a try. I can not say enough good things about it. If you have already seen it, you will enjoy it again on this DVD. It's for Western lovers, adventure lovers, romance lovers and anyone who just wants to get lost in a good story for a couple of hours.It is rated PG(there is some violence and mild langauge)Happy trails and enjoy.....Lauriealso recommended:Public Eye [VHS](Barbara Hershey)Great American Western V.11, The(4 films - stories of the American Indian)",5,Modern Day Western With A Century Old Feel,1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,2998,"['review', 'HBO', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Last', 'Dogmen', 'Last', 'Dogmen', 'beautiful', 'story', 'breath', 'away', 'everytime', 'watch', 'one', 'films', 'even', 'start', 'out', 'viewing', 'alone', 'pretty', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'find', 'rest', 'family', 'gathered', 'around', 'simply', 'one', 'glimpse', 'scenery', 'one', 'paragraph', 'dialouge', 'one', 'look', 'story', 'got', 'hold', 'you.It', 'modern', 'Western', 'romantic', 'adventure', 'one', 'may', 'take', 'place', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'Lewis', 'Gates', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'hired', 'track', 'three', 'deadly', 'criminals', 'who', 'have', 'escaped', 'deep', 'Oxbow', 'Montana', 'wilderness', 'trail', 'uncover', '100', 'year', 'old', 'mystery', 'One', 'clues', 'arrow', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'tribe', 'Cheyennes', 'existed', 'century', 'ago.He', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'what', 'possibilities', 'may', 'be', 'convinces', 'beautiful', 'Dr', 'Lillian', 'Sloan', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'expert', 'Native', 'American', 'culture', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'incredible', 'there', 'search', 'try', 'uncover', 'past', 'what', 'find', 'way', 'life', 'too', 'beautiful', 'be', 'spoiled', 'modern', 'day', 'man', 'save', 'just', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'search', 'past', 'Gates', 'own', 'ghosts', 'past', 'friendships', 'formed', 'evolving', 'romance', 'cinematogrpahy', 'musical', 'score', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'combined', 'wonderful', 'film.Even', 'Zip', 'dog', 'played', 'Zip', 'will', 'be', 'tugging', 'heart.Berenger', 'Hershey', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'together', 'Steve', 'Reevis', 'other', 'American', 'Indian', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'wonderful', 'lent', 'great', 'deal', 'realism', 'authenticity', 'film', 'Bravo', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'taking', 'majesty', 'Rockies', 'DD5.1', 'very', 'good', 'sounds', 'nature', 'modern', 'day', 'sounds', 'helicopters', 'such', 'are', 'quite', 'contrast', 'behold', 'surround', 'sound.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'nice', 'features', 'may', 'be', 'viewed', 'sound', 'Theatrical', 'version', 'Director', 'version', 'are', 'DD5.1', 'main', 'difference', 'found', 'was', 'Theatrical', 'version', 'captivating', 'narration', 'Wilfred', 'Brimley', 'Director', 'version', 'not', 'option', 'Director', 'Tab', 'Murphy', 'commentary', 'also', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'needing', 'are', 'other', 'features', 'include', 'cast', 'bios', 'costume', 'sketches', 'well.If', 'liked', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'will', 'enjoy', 'again', 'DVD', 'Western', 'lovers', 'adventure', 'lovers', 'romance', 'lovers', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'lost', 'good', 'story', 'couple', 'hours.It', 'rated', 'PG', 'violence', 'mild', 'langauge', 'Happy', 'trails', 'enjoy', '..Lauriealso', 'recommended', 'Public', 'Eye', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'Great', 'American', 'Western', 'V.11', '4', 'films', 'stories', 'American', 'Indian']",N/A

Yeah. Right!Which reminds me: Horses are plains animals and of very limited use in steep terrain. Indians hunting on horseback in those woods and mountains? Extremely unlikely!Why does Berenger bother to blow up the passage behind the waterfall after the sheriff and his cronies have just been on top of him in a helicopter? What was the purpose? There was no way those guys could NOT have seen the Indians, so the whole dynamite scene was pointless.Last but not least, I found the characters annoyingly stereotypical: the archaeothropologist is swooning over the ""noble savages""; the Indians are stoic; the white loner is rough because he's suffered a tragic loss, but that's just a facade anyway; whereas the sheriff is really arrogant and hateful - to name just a few.There was no chemistry between Hershey and Berenger whatsoever, and her character's ability to speak fluent Cheyenne was annoying.Overall I keep wondering what the point of this movie was - other than producing some sort of ""Dances With Wolves"" spinoff with a pseudo-dramatic end when she decides to stay with the Indians and he rides off into the sunset.I'm glad I watched this on cable and didn't spend any money on it!",2,SPOILERS!!!

'Last of the Dogmen' portrays the natives in this way.The truth is, of course, is that native americans were no more noble than anybody else and some practices of the plains tribes, of which the Cheyenne were one, would horrify most of us today.  Female captives were generally gang raped by the capturing war party until they returned to camp.  At this time she became the property of the warrior most responsible for capturing her.

42873,AQW0DI8M0W9LC,0783113196,"StargazySkye ""bookaholic""","[0, 0]","I am writing this as advice to anyone who goes looking for this hard to find movie. I have loved this movie for a long time. I had the VHS and figured that it was time to get the DVD. I did not purchase it on Amazon. I buy most of my movies here, but I was looking for something else that I couldn't get here and, when I found them both elsewhere, I ordered them. It was cheaper and touted as factory sealed. It was in the usual shrink wrap. I am not going to review the plot or performances. I have never found any fault with anything about it. I must say in reference to something I saw in another review that I find ""Last of the Dogmen"" to be paced much better than ""Dances with Wolves"" and Tom Berenger's transformative performance much more compelling than Kevin Costner's. He made a great Elliot Ness because he never had to move his face - a perfect imitation of Robert Stack.Now to the warning. When it came today, the DVD I purchased has a different cover picture from the movie: a closeup of Berenger and Hershey at the top with a shot of Berenger climbing rocks with his rifle below. The DVD itself has the same photo as you see here, but it has that extreme pebbled texture I have seen on some homemade DVDs. The background on the package is extremely orange. The packaging also has nothing I can see to identify the company that produced it on either the package or the DVD itself. The packaging displayed on the site was the same as you see here.It has no extras, just the movie and chapter selections. It is without the narration by Wilford Brimley, which I find a great loss. Brimley himself was a working cowboy out West and brings a certain flavor and much romance to the tale as he explains some background on Lewis Gates as we go along. I haven't watched the entire movie, but I know that the impact of the ending will be halved by his absence.The scenery is gorgeous in widescreen and the color is preserved at least on a par with a VHS tape from 1995. HOWEVER, the sound quality is horrible. Not from background noise, but it is at about half volume. Even with my laptop and additional speakers all at full volume, I cannot hear all the dialogue, and I can recite much of it by heart or nearly. With a pair of honkin' SMS headphones on, I can hear everything, but it is still murky, if I may apply that term to sound. The higher and lower frequencies are squashed by poor quality work into a slightly muddy sound. This is going to be a real problem if more than one person wants to watch at the same time.In spite of the usual threatening messages about bootlegging, I can't help wondering if this may be an illegal copy. This is just an FYI about the quality in case you see this orange cover. It is not a superior version of the movie. I will be dealing with my issues with the vendor, although I foresee no success. As I said, I did not buy this on Amazon and nothing derogatory should be imputed to them. This is a wonderful movie, which I can recommend highly, but not in this version. Also, oddly, the movie's French subtitle, ""Le Dernier Cheyenne"" appears in very small print on the spine and in the credit info on back, although there are no language choices as speaking tracks or subtitles. The only language is English.

Tom Berenger plays a bounty hunter who's engaged to track three escaped convicts in the Oxbow, a multi-thousand square mile area of rugged and unexplored wilderness in northern Montana.  Berenger doesn't get his man, or men, but he does stumble across some mighty suspicious looking rider obscured in a fog.  Barbara Hershey plays an anthropologist he engages to help him investigate the mystery.Filmed in Mexico and Canada, this movie looks good.  Berenger is appropriately rugged and Hershey appropriately professorish, they have a good Bogart/Hepburn AFRICAN QUEEN chemistry going, the dog is cute.LAST OF THE DOGMEN held my attention but it didn't make me say `wow'.  There's a lot more character interaction than action and things bog down at times.  There's are some plot inconsistencies as well - for instance, if the Dogmen capture or kill everyone who discovers their presence, how does Berenger's character escape the first time they see him?Movies like open with inspiration and require a lot of perspiration before they can close.  The idea of a hidden tribe is intriguing.  How you go about finding it, and what you do after you've found it, is the trick.  In 1937 Frank Capra found the winning formula in LOST HORIZON, while almost bankrupting Columbia in the process.  Even though LAST OF THE DOGMEN is listed under ""Adventure,"" I'd put it in the same category as Capra's speculative fantasy.  In any event, both are about a retreat back to an idyllic, primitive past.

42877,A9VYPWQRVK726,0783113196,"TTQC Driver ""CWK""","[1, 1]","I think this is an excellent movie because it is able to depict the native americans as human beings that just want to live in a group in harmony with their environment.  One of the failures of The Founding Fathers is they were unable to implement a policy that included the native americans in society.  (Another major failure was not addressing slavery, but that is another story.)  So, Manifest Destiny took over which led to the near extinction of buffalo and the unneccessary slaughter of many native americans.  It was nice to have this fantasy story where some of them survived and continued their own way of life, even if it is fiction.There is a shop in Mendocino, California that sells a T-shirt with a picture of Apaches with rifles on the front.  The caption is: ""Homeland Security Since 1492.""  I find that applicable.  Once in 1969 I made a comment to a Blackfoot person at a gas station just East of Glacier Park.  I was intending to be sympathetic, but in retrospect it was probably gratuitous.  The fellow's retort was:  ""yeah, we should have killed that ****er Columbus when he stepped off the boat.""
