Aaron Eckhardt was great as the tortured monster created by Dr. Frankenstein, still bitter and resentful. But then after 200 years of having to live in hiding, looking more monster than man, he has a right. But when he becomes the hunted of both good and evil, he must decide whether to run, or to fight back against both sides that seek his destruction. Along the way, he encounters a scientist who has discovered her benefactor has more in mind than he has let on. She is more caught up in the experiment of creating life from death than caring just how it will effect mankind. Until she meets the First and the one that holds the key to immortality.  I admit it could have been so much better, the storyline was there as were the characters, and lets face it, Eckhardt is an outstanding actor, whether he plays a tortured soul having lost the woman he loves, a post apocalyptic soldier with PTSD or as the creation of a mad scientist. He carries the film but that might not be enough for most critics, it was, however for me. If the director had more of a story to work with, or could better direct the other actors, it would have been a great movie. Or maybe a lot of the good parts wound up on the cutting room floor.

1554636,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B008JFUN1O,Amanda Pike,"[1, 3]","Disclaimer: I write this review on nearly two and a half days without sleep and functioning on two cups of black tea.I just watched I, Frankenstein and in all honesty... It's not bad.First let's start with The Creature, Frankenstein's Monster, Adam.  The scarring and hair was better in the 1790s flashbacks.  Why the Hell did they change that?  He looked more like the literary version in those scenes.  There was even the nice touch of dark rings under his eyes.  They should have kept him like that, maybe a little paler.  And for God's sake don't give him ""sexy abs.""  His physical strength should be surprising, not obvious.  Also they should have done some cheap trick photography to make him taller. They were able to make Luke Goss look eight feet tall in the Hallmark mini-series inexpensively so why does he look roughly ordinary human height here?  He should have been kept abnormally tall.  Focus on the height, not the muscles.  Slender, corpse-like would have been fine.Adam's personality is pretty true to the book.  He's bitter at the world.  Longs to be human even though he tries to hide it because he thinks it's impossible. He's lonely and angsty and this is just right for the character.  It's cliche now but The Frankenstein Monster was always this way.  He can't help it.  It's in his nature.  And he clearly feels guilt for what he had done to Victor and Elizabeth. In the novel he was also accountable for the deaths of Victor's younger brother, William, Justine (whom he framed for William's murder), Henry Clerval, Elizabeth, Victor's father (as he died of a broken heart) and then Victor himself.  And he regretted all of this and longed to atone for his acts of vengeance.  He was very remorseful.Adam is broody and tragic and speaks well, not that annoying slow stroke-like speech they give him in the 1994 film and the Danny Boyle play.He also had the full head of hair at the moment of his creation like in the novel.  Pause here to think about how ridiculous the concept of the flat head truly is over all, how someone could creact life but not a decent skull cap.  This is also why I don't care for the bald versions of the Frankenstein Monster.  Mary Shelley said he had long black hair.  Victor studied metaphysics, alchemy, and sorcery.  So why impose modern brain surgery in there?  If he can stitch a body together he can't add hair?  It's actually anti-realistic that he couldn't get a simple thing like hair right but he can create life.My biggest qualm (and this might be petty for some) is when our ""Genius"" scientist Terra says that in the 1790s no one would have known how to harness electricity. I guess she's never heard of Benjamin Franklin and his Lightning rod theory about conductivity?  Somehow it's more realistic to get electric eels in Bavaria to create life then to use lightning?  The Mary Shelley novel goes out of it's way to describe Victor seeing lightning strike a tree at age seventeen and being in awe at it's power.  He chose an attic to do his work.  And when he brought his creation to life, though the explanation as to how he did it was left vague, it was storming that November night in the novel.  This is one thing the older films got right.  Lightning was likely involved.And the writers should have seriously checked their history about when harnessing electricity was accomplished.  Mary Shelley knew about  Erasmus Darwin (who died in 1802) and his theories on electricity.  Someone writing this knows NOTHING about eighteenth century science.  They clearly didn't know about Benjamin Franklin's lightning rod conductivity theories and experimentations or about Erasmus's theory about electrical energy.  Now yes, in the novel Victor also read the work of Paracelsus (an alchemist) and Agrippa (a sorcerer) when he found the secret of life but lightning's electricity (not electric eels) was clearly involved.  And again, I found it brilliantly stupid that a modern scientist didn't know that conducting electricity was possible (Without electric eels!) in the 1790s.  As an occultist AND science lover and one who has studied theoretical physics, parapsychology and even, yes metaphysics (I have an honorary doctorate in that)  this bothered me to no end.  To me this was actually the worst mistake the film made.An electrophysiologist who doesn't know when electricity conduction was started and is clearly not even thirty yet with her own laboratory.  Yeah, okay...They also made Victor Frankenstein too old. In the novel he was seventeen when the idea hit him.  And twenty two or twenty four when he brought his creation to life.  He was a university student at Ingolstadt.  His father was only in his forties.  His youngest brother was barely six.  Victor was young!The dialogue and plot were predictable. I guessed the entire story in advance.  And I have qualms about the beings of ""Good"" being forbidden from love considering how Corinthians goes on and on about it being the greatest virtue and closest thing to God. But it IS cheesy fun.I liked it.  It was cheesy fun and the first monster mash to have a version of the Frankenstein creature close to what Mary Shelley described.  They should have kept his 1790s look for the bulk of the film though.I liked that the gargoyles had a lair in a castle and then a clock tower. That is a nod to the Disney TV series Gargoyles, which I loved as a kid.I also like the nods to the classic Frankenstein films. Lines like ""Frankenstein must be destroyed"" from the trailer is a Hammer horror film title, the hair style from the 1831 illustration, and the hallmark mini-series was recreated for the 1790s flashback, the very opening scene is directly from the final scene of the award winning 2004 Hallmark mini-series of Frankenstein and was also re-created for the Off Broadway Frankenstein musical in 2010.  The name Adam comes from The Frankenstein Monster's own comparing of himself to Adam in Paradise Lost in the original Frankenstein novel. He tells Victor in the book ""I am the Adam of your labors"" and ""I should have been thy Adam."" The first time a Frankenstein Monster officially answered to the name Adam was in the 1966 TV series Dark Shadows.  The mate being called Eve comes from Dark Shadows and the 1985 film The Bride.  The electric eels (though I hate them) are from the 1994 Frankenstein film.  The claim that he is soulless comes from the silent Frankenstein film ""Life without a soul"" (This idea is not from the original novel. In the novel he was very spiritual and fully believed he had a soul and no one doubted it).  The line ""It's alive"" is from the 1931 Boris Karloff film.  The restraint chair that The Gargoyles put Adam in briefly is from Bride of Frankenstein.  It's sad how many Frankenstein purists won't give this film a chance to see these lovely nods to previous Frankenstein incarnations.  You can tell someone who loves previous versions had a hand in this but there is an irrational rage and hatred against this movie that I, someone who loves Mary Shelley's novel, cannot fathom.Sure, it's flawed and cheesy and predicable but it IS a fun movie that is the victim of a lot of hyper negative over-reaction.  It's really not that bad.  This is brain candy, a popcorn movie, a guilty pleasure.It's like watching a role playing game come to life.  It was fun.  I would definitely watch it again.  And yes, I will buy it on DVD.  I hope the lost scene of the unfinished mate, Eve, is on the disc version.I give this film a 7.5 out of ten.  It could be better but it could be a lot worse and it was fun.  And the first cheesy action fantasy to use the Frankenstein Monster even roughly from the novel.Afterward musings:My reasons why I think Adam had a soul all along:1. In Mary Shelley's novel The Frankenstein Monster fully believed he had a soul. He talks about it many times and at one point questions if he's a new soul or the soul of one of the dead men and aniamls he's made from.2. In most religions the soul is your consciousness able to live on after death. ""It's not that I have a soul. I am a soul. I have a body."" - Harry Dresden in The Dresden Files. But then again this film's theology is strange.3. The free prequel graphic novel I, Frankenstein Genesis tells us that The Gargoyles can be wrong about people not having souls. In the backstory about Leonore the demons plan on tricking the gargoyles into accidentally killing humans (which they are forbidden from doing and results in the Gargoyle's own death) by hiding among humans in battle. The other gargoyles were unable to see the light in these humans until Leonore warned them about what the demons were planning. One even says something to the effect of ""Why wasn't I able to see the light in them before?""4. The Gargoyles went out of their way, convolutedly, to convince The Creature that he has no soul in the graphic novel prequel, going as far as to have one of them pose as a woman for a year to trick him into thinking he's in love with her, just to tell him that he's soulless for wanting to stay with her. (Because it would put her in danger, apparently...) Why do that if he does not have a soul? This hints to me they (or one or a few of them) know he has a soul but have a bias against him because of how he was created.5. We are told in the graphic novel prequel that gargoyles cannot kill someone who has a soul (a human), that gargoyle would die instead. Repeatedly in the graphic novel prequel graphic novel a gargoyle would either be talked out of killing Adam or would make up an excuse to not kill him. This suggests to me that they, at the very least, suspected that he had a soul.6. They say only someone soulless can kill a gargoyle but at the same time a Gargoyle cannot kill someone who has a soul. That gargoyle will die. They never say how. What if Gideon's death in this film was the fulfillment of this notion, that if a gargoyle tries to take the life of someone with a soul he'll die instead. They weren't exactly specific how the gargoyle would die.7.  As Gideon died he said ""God will surely damn you.""  How can you be damned without a soul to damn?  Gideon must have known in his dying moments that yes, Adam had a soul.8.  t was the acknowledgement of his identity (and maybe realizing he had a soul) that made Adam able to resist the demon at the end.9. Even Naberius  says ""You have a soul!""",4,I love Mary Shelley's novel and I do NOT hate this movie,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,10362,"['Disclaimer', 'write', 'review', 'nearly', 'two', 'half',

Why?  what's the connection?  Why are they called the &#34;Gargoyle Clan&#34;?!?Never did figure that one out.Villains, demons, didn't seem to have that sort of restriction or anything really similar.Villains could be quite easily &#34;vanquished&#34; and sent back to hell by spiking them with any weapon that had a sort of crucifix symbol (not really a crucifix either, but I'm at a loss for the proper name for it.).  Find a plank, draw this thing on it, whack em up side the head *poof*Now of course there's a battle for supremacy of the world, and God is of course keeping his hands out of it.  Why?  No idea, don't think they really tackled it all that well (though admittedly half way through it I was resorting to playing warcraft battlegrounds and just listening to this thing.).  Good guys are losing cuz their numbers are getting killed off and not replenished, whilst the badguys are either getting refreshed or were just more numerous than the good and better fighters.  That wasn't real clear either.Oh yeah, Frankenstein?  Yeah, they called him that off and on, but we all know that his name is really &#34;The monster&#34;, they dropped a lot of the surgical aspects of his scars in favor of making it look like he was clawed all over (closest description I can come up with),He has a major attitude, because... well, he has no soul.  Of course, I'm a simple person, I would think that in their universe you'd have to have a soul to be animate, but nay, not so much.Effects?  Glorious at some points, explosions, smiting, flying angels, buildings going up in flames, all sorts of fun looking stuff.Plot?  (See above), that's about as coherent as it gets, can't say much more without giving up what little surprise there might be.BUT, it's filled with lamely written stereotypes;o  Good guys want his help, but don't trust him (no soul)o  Good guys of course attempt to snatch him and make use of him.o  Betrayals aboundo  Insert any other basic cliche you've seen in any number of fantasy films (Thought I had flipped channels andwas watching Lord of the Rings with the High handed elves for a bit there.).Nice color schemes, good architecture, goodly amount of people spearing other people, watch it for the effects anddon't expect much beyond that and you could have a decent time.SpoilersWith the silliness of simply writing / engraving  the cross thing on any object to turn it into a holy weapon, my mindstarted thinking....  Well, why not come up with a fragmentation grenade that was stuffed with a bunch of fletchettesyou can fly, dive bomb, drop fletchettes, go out for a celebratory drink?DunnoAnd if a soul is a soul, how in the hell can someone grow a soul without some sort of intervention from God?I mean it's not like we're talking Wizard of Oz here (though admittedly some of the gargoyles did look like flyingmonkeys.).",3,Nice Special Effects,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,3142,"['Sometimes', 'see', 'movie', 'everyone', 'got', 'room', 'decided', 'what', 'sort', 'special', 'effects', 'wanted', 'do', 'then', 'attempted', 'build', 'story', 'would', 'work.This', 'one', 'sort', 'fits', 'bill.Angels', 'are', 'stoney', 'gargoyles', 'find', 'buildings', 'everywhere', 'Why', 'what', 'connection', 'Why', 'are', 'called', '34', 'Gargoyle', 'Clan', '34', 'Never', 'did', 'figure', 'one', 'out.Villains', 'demons', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'sort', 'restriction', 'anything', 'really', 'similar.Villains', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'easily', '34', 'vanquished', '34', 'sent', 'back', 'hell', 'spiking', 'weapon', 'had', 'sort', 'crucifix', 'symbol', 'not', 'really', 'crucifix', ""'m"", 'loss', 'proper', 'name', 'it.', 'Find', 'plank', 'draw', 'thing', 'whack', 'up', 'side', 'head', '*poof*Now', 'course', 'battle', 'supremacy', 'world', 'God', 'course', 'keeping', 'hands', 'Why', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'tackled', 'well', 'admittedly', 'way', 'was', 'resorting', 'playing', 'warcraft', 'battlegrounds', 'just', 'listening', 'thing.', 'Good', 'guys', 'are', 'losing', 'cuz', 'numbers', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'off', 'not', 'replenished', 'badguys', 'are', 'getting', 'refreshed', 'were', 'just', 'more', 'numerous', 'good', 'better', 'fighters', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'clear', 'either.Oh', 'yeah', 'Frankenstein', 'Yeah', 'called', 'off', 'know', 'name', 'really', '34', 'monster', '34', 'dropped', 'lot', 'surgical', 'aspects', 'scars', 'favor', 'making', 'look', 'was', 'clawed', 'closest', 'description', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'major', 'attitude', 'well', 'soul', 'course', ""'m"", 'simple', 'person', 'would', 'think', 'universe', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'soul', 'be', 'animate', 'nay', 'not', 'so', 'much.Effects', 'Glorious', 'points', 'explosions', 'smiting', 'flying', 'angels', 'buildings', 'going', 'up', 'flames', 'sorts', 'fun', 'looking', 'stuff.Plot', 'See', 'about', 'as', 'coherent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'giving', 'up', 'what', 'little', 'surprise', 'might', 'be.BUT', 'filled', 'lamely', 'written', 'stereotypes', 'o', 'Good', 'guys', 'want', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'soul', 'o', 'Good', 'guys', 'course', 'attempt', 'snatch', 'make', 'use', 'him.o', 'Betrayals', 'aboundo', 'Insert', 'other', 'basic', 'cliche', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'fantasy', 'films', 'Thought', 'had', 'flipped', 'channels', 'watching', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'High', 'handed', 'elves', 'bit', 'there', '.Nice', 'color', 'schemes', 'good', 'architecture', 'goodly', 'amount', 'people', 'spearing', 'other', 'people', 'watch', 'effects', 'anddo', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'decent', 'time.SpoilersWith', 'silliness', 'simply', 'writing', '/', 'engraving', 'cross', 'thing', 'object', 'turn', 'holy', 'weapon', 'mindstarted', 'thinking', 'Well', 'why', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'fragmentation', 'grenade', 'was', 'stuffed', 'bunch', 'fletchettesyou', 'can', 'fly', 'dive', 'bomb', 'drop', 'fletchettes', 'go', 'out', 'celebratory', 'drink', 'DunnoAnd', 'soul', 'soul', 'how', 'hell', 'can', 'someone', 'grow', 'soul', 'sort', 'intervention', 'God', 'mean', 'not', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'here', 'admittedly', 'gargoyles', 'did', 'look', 'flyingmonkeys']",N/A

At that point you could have substituted Lycans and Vampires, without having to change the script much.Adam nee Frankenstein (or his monster however you want to view it) is the missing link between soulless reanimation and demon re-population of Earth. Standing in the way of chief demon prince (Bill Nighy chewing scenery as he goes) are the Gargoyles, a religious order of shape shifting flying super warriors who ""ascend"" when killed, as their nemesis demons ""descend"" in a fiery ball during all the fight scenes.It's OK, but ridiculous really, filmed in Europe (like the Underworld movies) where everyone speaks English, and where a technologically advanced human race is somehow oblivious to flying gargoyles, demon destruction and immense buildings and cathedrals seemingly always vacant, it's a lot to accept, even suspending disbelief to the maximum.Eckhart swaggers around with a ripped physique and crooked hard stare most of the time, delivering monotone sound bytes, usually followed by slow mo swaggering with fire balls behind him.Predictable?

Well yeah, the fight sequences were the melee one would expect, but the reasons behind these battles were perfectly clear.I guess I would ask a potentially interested viewer what they thought of the &#34;underworld&#34; films as this has very similar overtones.

In the same vain as movies like ""Underworld"" and ""Van Helsing"", that explains on the surface what you will get when you hit play on this bluray. In fact, they are so similar that when Bill Nighy's evil character Naberius came onto the screen, I assumed that he was a crossover from the ""Underworld"" series until after the movie was over I remembered that Nighy's character from ""Underworld"" was named Viktor. In this sense, you know what you're getting and it primarily has to do with monsters fighting monsters. The effects are outstanding and the 3D is off the charts. In fact, I found the 3D to be so good, despite not liking the movie, I am glad I purchased it.The problem is, not unlike ""Underworld"" we are joining this movie in the middle of a war; somewhat. After the movie spends about 2 minutes slopping through the early events of Frankenstein's life and the culmination of his relationship with his creator, we are immediately thrown into some gargoyles fighting monsters on earth storyline.  The creators had about as much tact and setup as you would expect from people who could care less about the basics of making an audience care about your characters and just want to get to the videogamish chaos that they've become so incredibly good at.They have become incredibly good at creating chaos, and beautiful CGI chaos it is. Unfortunately, finding action, sci-fi movie-makers who know how to develop personality as well as visuals is like finding a bugger in a desert. I don't think it's the fault of the actors involved in this movie. I think they are given material and they made the most of it. The problem is that every time there was a moment that could give us a little insight or care-at-all into our characters, they brush-stroked over it like they figured the audience didn't care about formalities.Well, for the most part, we do care.

Frankenstein's monster survives the death of his maker, Viktor Frankenstein, and a nearly deadly encounter with two grave-robbing demons, to spent two hundred years in lonely and bitter exile in the Far North. An angry monster returns to modern-day London and a war between a dwindling band of heaven-sent gargoyles protecting humans, and the legion of demons out to enslave mankind. The movie is very much in the style of the &#34;Underworld&#34; series; if that wasn't your cup of tea, you've been forewarned.The demons, led by Bill Nighy as the urbane but nasty Prince Naberius, have a plan that involves duplicating Frankenstein. The monster (Aaron Eckhardt) would prefer to go his own way. He takes some persuading to pick a side in this fight; his choice will be influenced by Naberius' lovely chief scientist Terra Wade (Yvonne Strahovski), who will have her own eyes opened to a new reality.The plot is perilously thin in places.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[6, 13]","Even though most of them flop, Hollywood just seems determined to cram the glossy, witless supernatural thrillers down our throats. Consider: &#34;Legion,&#34; &#34;Constantine,&#34; &#34;Van Helsing&#34; and everything &#34;Underworld.&#34;And at times, &#34;I, Frankenstein&#34; seems like a massive crossover fanfiction of all those -- we have demons, angels, an ancient feud between warring immortal factions, a conspiracy to bring the undead to life... and gargoyles. It feels like a post-&#34;Underworld&#34; fanfic based on Mary Shelley -- cheesy, plodding and derivative, but it's also oddly harmless.After burying his maker, the Frankenstein monster (Aaron Eckhart) is immediately caught in a clash between demons and the angelically-assisted gargoyles. The gargoyle queen Leonore (Miranda Otto) declares that his name is Adam, and asks him to help them save the human race from demons. He refuses, but grabs a sanctified weapon and starts sending the demons back to hell.Fast-forward to the modern day. Adam is still hunting for the demon prince Naberius (Bill Nighy), who has begun scientific experiments to recreate Frankenstein's revivification techniques -- and is hunting for the monster and/or Frankenstein's notes. With one of those, he can unleash a new horde of demons on earth, which the dwindling gargoyle forces cannot hold back.&#34;I Frankenstein&#34; feels like a massive crossover fanfic. The style is very much &#34;Underworld,&#34; the main plot and villain motivation are from &#34;Van Helsing,&#34; and the angel/demon thing somewhat reeks of &#34;Legion.&#34; And of course, the Frankenstein monster is a tortured, angsty soul with abs that you can grate cheese on, who is redeemed for love of a bland scientist he just met.There is a certain charm in the movie's clear admiration for the original Mary Shelley novel, though. There are many nods (Adam's name) and references to the book, rather than to the more famous monster movies loosely adapted from it.However, &#34;I, Frankenstein&#34; is still a mess. The wafer-thin plot manages to be both simplistic and overcomplicated, with no twists or hidden layers. So it loads itself down with glossy slow-motion action sequences and flashy CGI (both gargoyles and demons expire in massive eruptions of light). The dialogue tends to be cheesy at best (&#34;Now all I see is darkness.&#34; &#34;I am not human, nor gargoyle, nor demon&#34;), and whenever the action dies down, the story lapses into a plodding, awkward pace.Aaron Eckhart seems to be showing us how he would have played a Christopher Nolan Batman -- lots of brooding and angsting (sometimes on rooftops), and talking in a gravelly monotone. He's not giving it his all, but he's putting more effort into it than the sleepwalking Nighty. Yvonne Strahovski is so blandly generic as a contrived love interest, she might as well be made of compressed Wonder Bread.Honestly, the only actor who seems to be really throwing herself into her roles is Miranda Otto, who puts a lot of trembling passion into her cheesy dialogue. God bless Otto, she's working hard on this, and she does add some moments of much-needed subtlety.&#34;I, Frankenstein&#34; is a pretty bad movie that derived almost everything from other movies, but it does have a little sliver of heart that makes it hard to hate.

When everything is considered, there's really not much there.  You have multiple bad guys in favor of disposing of Dr. Frankenstein's monster, newly dubbed Adam.  Everyone has ulterior motives.  There are many fight sequences in different locations, all amounting to the same thing.  There's a nave scientist who wants to create life from nothing, which would inadvertently help the demons in their agenda to take over the world.  Everyone wants Dr. Frankenstein's diary.  The consensus is no one wants a demon infested world.The look of this film is fabulous.  The FX is outstanding.  The acting is uniformly fine (although at 64, Bill Nighy is a little long in the tooth to be playing these types of bad guys).  The action is plentiful, fast, and furious.  My only complaints are a rushed prologue (to rapidly fill us in as though this was part two in a series, without there ever being a part one), and the disturbing ambiguity of the Gargoyle Order which was every bit as blood thirsty and duplicitous as the demons.  You can't very well state that God is your employer while you're busy lying at every opportunity (the treacherous Leonore, gargoyle queen), and just generally acting the same as the hounds from hell.I wouldn't mind if this became a series like Underworld but because of the disappointing reception at the box office and the critical response, it might not happen.In spite of its flaws, I really-really-really liked this movie.

1554727,A1MFGO518GH1WL,B008JFUN1O,Emale,"[1, 3]","A plot using the fight between good vs. evil is nothing new but this movie offers a different twist using Gargoyles vs. Demons (respectively) to accomplish the story. The creative approach to deliver the plot earned star #1. Star #2 was awarded for the cool way the two factions were sent to heaven or hell. When a demon was killed by a holy weapon (typically wielded by a Gargoyle - or the Frankenstein Monster) the demon bursts into flame and its life force augers down through the earth to hell. It actually leaves a hole. Very Kewel. Alternatively when Gargoyles are killed their life force/soul is sent to heaven in a bolt of blue white light that grows in intensity and brightness as it rises through the clouds up to heaven. These two effects were very neat and I had not seen this before. Star #3 was given for the story that showed an ancient history of war between the two factions about which humans were totally unaware (like Muggles were in the H. Potter series). In addition the Frankenstein ""Monster"" is bigger than life (literally). He is fair minded immensley fast and powerful is over 200 year old and has no soul and takes the name Adam. He might prove to be the coolest movie character since Indiana Jones.  Star #3 was rounded out by the general entertainment value of this movie. Note: I acknowledge this movie is not for everyone.

1554733,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUN1O,FNDNreview,"[8, 19]","Mary Shelly&#8217;s Frankenstein is one of the most easily recognizable characters in the history of storytelling.  Developed in 1818, Frankenstein will likely never be more appreciated than he is in his novelized form.  Over the years, there have been countless film incarnations of the character, the most prominent of which can be found in films that include The Curse of Frankenstein (portrayed by Christopher Lee), Young Frankenstein (portrayed by Peter Boyal) or in one of the more film variations, Mary Shelly&#8217;s Frankenstein (portrayed by Robert De Niro).  And, it was obviously only a matter of time before someone decided to create yet another re-envisioning of the character &#8211; which comes in the form of the new film, I, Frankenstein.From the producers (and a handful of others) that brought us the Underworld saga, Frankenstein &#8211; directed by Stuart Beattie (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Australia) &#8211; stars Aaron Eckhart as Frankenstein&#8217;s monster, Adam.  Upon his initial awakening, the monster doesn&#8217;t see eye-to-eye with his creator Victor Frankenstein (Aden young), inevitably leading to Victor&#8217;s death.  Doing the commendable thing, Adam decides to bury his creator &#8211; but is randomly attacked by a group of demons, and then saved by a group of gargoyles.It&#8217;s at this point that Adam learns from the head of the gargoyle order, Leonore (Miranda Otto), the world is more than it seems, and there&#8217;s a war going on between Heaven (gargoyles) and Hell (demons).  Feeling isolated and without anyone to guide him, Adam wonders the world for hundreds of years &#8211; constantly being hunted by the demons, on orders from their leader, Prince Naberius (Bill Nighy).  Posing as a wealthy industry leader going by the name Charles Wessesx, Prince Naberius is secretly relying on the work of a brilliant doctor, Terra (Miranda Otto), to solve the lost incarnation formula of Victor Frankenstein &#8211; with the intent to re-animate his army in waiting.In the modern day, humans are oblivious to the creatures that are living among them.  Adam, who is constantly being hunted by demons, decides to go on the offensive by eliminating them on his own.  However, during a battle, the death of human quickly leads to the gargoyles (protectors of man) decision to apprehend Adam and confine him for the good of humanity.  Now knowing the location of Adam, Naberius sends an army to apprehend him &#8211; putting Adam right in the middle of a brewing war between two very different sides of which he is both skeptical.Looking at I, Frankenstein as a standalone film is difficult since it resembles the Underworld films so closely.  This storyline basically replaces the gun-toting, leather-drenched Kate Beckinsale with a fit, stick-wielding Aaron Eckhart.  Naturally, if I had to choose &#8211; Beckinsale had much more appeal, but it&#8217;s not as though the Underworld films were anything special, either.  The franchise went on far longer than it probably should have, featuring a yawn-worthy drawn out war between vampires and werewolves, while I, Frankenstein features a similar premise &#8211; only with gargoyles and demons.  After Underworld: Awakening was released, rumors spread that the Underworld franchise was dead, so apparently the producers have thrown in the towel (for now) with the hopes that this film catches on.  But, to be honest, they shouldn&#8217;t hold their breath&#8230;Obviously, Aaron Eckhart&#8217;s most notable role to date is in playing Two-Face in The Dark Knight, and since then he&#8217;s really failed to do much to build off that role of lifetime.  He&#8217;s starred in Battle: Los Angeles and Olympus Has Fallen &#8211; both gaudy and forgettable.  Now, after playing a glorified, one-dimensional Frankenstein in a film that was doomed to fail from the get-go, it won&#8217;t help his cause in the future for acquiring significant roles.  Eckhart undoubtedly trained extensively for this role, but even with all of the action in this flick, there are still very few moments where Eckhart is able to showcase his acting ability.  Sadly, his version of a Frankenstein is nothing but an epic bore.While Eckhart was anything but memorable, his nemesis in the film &#8211; portrayed by Bill Nighy, was supremely enjoyable.  Nighy, who was also a villain in the majority of the Underworld films, plays a similar character here.  His demeanor is just so powerful and creepy that you can&#8217;t help but love him every time he plays the bad guys (which is more often than not).  His character quickly establishes himself as a man to be fear, and he sets the battle-centric tone that dominates the majority of the plot.Even though the cast is relatively expendable (meaning anyone could have done their job), the special effects are the standout achievement.  The beautiful darkness of the city, mixed with the explosiveness of the creatures (both gargoyle and demon) are surprisingly eye-pleasing, making the battle sequences the only part of the film that doesn&#8217;t make you want to check your watch or implore you to refill your popcorn.  Speaking of visuals, Eckhart looks far too much like Aaron Eckhart and not enough like a monster that was created from eight different corpses.  His voice and attire could have both gone in a better, creepier direction.  After all, Frankenstein should be scary &#8211; yet if I ran into Kate Beckinsale in a back alley, I&#8217;d be far more afraid of her than Eckhart&#8217;s version of Frankenstein.Overall, I, Frankenstein is handicapped right out of the gate by the fact that it resembles the Underworld franchise &#8211; which never really established itself as a commanding set of films to begin with.  This version of Frankenstein is mostly cartoon-ish, and not what you&#8217;d expect Frankenstein to be in the least.  Director Stuart Beattie shouldn&#8217;t even bare any of the blame when this film tanks because this script had bad news written all over it before production even started.  But, if Kate Beckinsale&#8217;s Selene character popped out during the credits and was preparing to face-off with Eckhart, maybe then this film would have generated a little excitement.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t happen and I, Frankenstein will no doubt land in whatever dark void bad movies go to after they tank at the box office.GRADE:  D+FNDNreview.com",1,"'I, Frankenstein'

(Sadly in  so many areas of contemporary culture there has been an attempt to minimize the importance of religious ethics, sometimes in a very biased ignorant way).I can already see the virulently ant-religious critics, skeptics, cynics sharpening their knives to criticize this film. How dare they mention &#34;God&#34;, &#34;angels&#34;, &#34;demons&#34;, etc.!!  These are not politically correct!! Sadly, many enemies of religion/films with strong ethical humanistic themes  have little to no knowledge of religion,(also theology, history). , and its major contributions to civilization. However, as a person of faith I believe that well  made movies that point to higher purposes (i.e. God), morals/ethics are in short supply. It's really good to see even Hollywood now coming out with mainstream movies (e.g. Noah & Son of God).This movie was exciting, creative, entertaining with solid acting and a solid script. The special effects were pretty good but that was not the overall theme of this movie. This was not just another horror/fantasy movie. This was a &#34;good vs evil&#34; film but that didn't turn it into a cliche. There are deeper levels here. I love the use of Christian imagery to include scapulars, sacramentals, gargoyles, angels and demons and of course the central ideas of God, the soul and redemption. Although a lot of these are from Catholic theology they also have a broader appeal to all Christianity, an audience that has been very badly ignored/dismissed by modern secularists and their ilk. I may be in the minority but I am really sick and tired of the domination of ever increasing senseless uses of sex and violence for so many films.

Going into this, I knew it was going to be a disaster, the trailers were ugly and uninteresting but I convinced myself that all films should be given an equal chance to prove its worthiness, so I watched this... I never wanted more in my life to leave. After about 14 minutes into this film I wanted to get up and run for my life, to prevent the risk of a heart attack watching this mess. The easiest titles to compare this to would be 'Underworld' and 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters'. 'Underworld' wasn't great but it was a modest film with some pure effort put into it. And 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' sucked, it was unbelievably bad, but I loved it because it was fun. This film is neither modestly good or even fun to watch, it's just bad. My review of 'I, Frankenstein'.'I, Frankenstein' tells the tale of Adam Frankenstein (Aaron Eckhart) who struggles to comp with his past as well as finding out how he is who he was. He is watched by a group of gargoyles who's leader (Miranda Otto) hides a secret book, which beholds the information on how Adam was created. But an evil business billionaire, Charles Wesexx (Bill Nighy) whose crew of demons discover that of Frankenstein's existence, seeks to capture Adam or his book of creation to reanimate his own army of monsters to fight against his enemy, the gargoyles, and take over the world. It's up to Adam and a scientist who seeks to reanimate substances to save the day along with the group of gargoyles.How visually poor could a film be? Watching this I felt as if I was watching one of those weekly Sci-Fi films that premiere every Friday. Maybe if this film were released in late 80's or early 90's before Jurassic Park was invented these effects would have been accepted, but for a film released in 2014, after the release of King Kong and Avatar? This is unacceptable. The visuals are crude, ugly, and unconvincing to say the least. The amateur work of it almost made me exit the room where I was watching it after we get our first glimpses of those fire demon things (I don't even know, they were just so ugly and blah)I have to talk about the mind aching editing and pace. The film goes by so fast, taking no time to sit and take a look at what it has, it just can't slow down, its dull action sequence after dull action sequence... and in the only second when the film isn't in an action sequence we get a highly awkward and un-necessary shirtless shot of our Frankenstein Monster. The endless action sequences are only made worse by the editing, with quick cuts all over the place to film the action; it's so hard to comprehend anything. There's no fun in any of it. The action is in such a large quantity, and poorly paste together form it comes out extremely dull and boring.This is a film only for a person who expects little to nothing from a film. The plot is so bland, so dull, so cheesy, so predictable that it's beyond laughable it's just sad. All the dialogue here is clunky and chunky and unbelievably stupid to say the LEAST. Not to mention the script includes an overabundance of action sequences (As I have already explained) and a high lack of character development. So in the end you care little for anybody, and you find it hard to become emotionally attached to Adam, who's only role in the film as the lead, is to fight and say 'I'm a monster'.That is why I feel sorry for the talent who were completely wasted here. 'Aaron Eckhart' who did a pretty nice job was no match for his unbelievably soupy dialogue, and lack of time to develop his character beyond a few lines in between action shots. 'Bill Nighy' who can make any bad role good, is left nothing to work with and 'Miranda Otto'... well I just liked her in this, no matter how predictable her character was. But 'Yvonne Strahovski' for the scientist? Really? All she was, was some unconvincing, miss-casted, hotty, and that's it. She was probably only brought in to attract young male audience members.All and all this is a complete disaster. The scripting is predictable; the visuals are worthy of a Sci-Fi channel film, and the action sequences lifeless and dull and leave no room for any character development. This wasted the present's of a mostly impressive cast aside from one completely un-necessary and horribly miscast 'Yvonne Strahovski'. F 5/23/14P.S After a dismal run at the box office it's safe to say we won't see Frankenstein's monster anytime soon... oh wait! We have that one with Daniel Radcliffe out in October 2015...'I, Frankenstein' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy action and violence throughout.

I mean I don't mind a different twist on classics or on historic people or subjects (such as Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) with some being more successful and original than others.  And therein lies the rub with this movie, I was entertained for sure as there was plenty of action but for originality of story is where the movie falls short.  I really felt like I was watching an Underworld sequel with a mix of Van Helsing thrown in.  They even go so far as to cast  Bill Nighy (Victor in Underworld) as the demon villain who essentially plays the same character (demon/vampire).  Anyone else recognize the actor who played a werewolf in Underworld also cast as one of the Naberius' guardian demons.  I don't mind using good character actors in the role as this guys are for sure but the story line was so similar, I really expected Kate Beckinsale to come flying in and save the day.  Oh wait, they did, but just made it a male actor and called him Adam.Bad movie, no, as I said, I was entertained and thought it was ok in the end, but in no way an original story and to me just really didn't make a good Frankenstein story.If you like the Underworld or Van Helsing type stories (although you might prefer to just go watch those as the Underworld series I think is much better), then you might like this as well, but if you are looking for a new original story with a unique twist that adds to the Frankenstein legend, then you might be disappointed here.",3,Different twist on Frankenstein for sure but could almost be called Underworld 4,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1680,"['different', 'twist', 'Frankenstein', 'story', 'Frankenstein', 'creature', 'caught', 'centuries', 'old', 'war', 'demons', 'gargoyles.After', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'exactly', 'story', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'different', 'twist', 'classics', 'historic', 'people', 'subjects', 'such', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'being', 'more', 'successful', 'original', 'others', 'therein', 'rub', 'movie', 'was', 'entertained', 'sure', 'was', 'plenty', 'action', 'originality', 'story', 'where', 'movie', 'short', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Underworld', 'sequel', 'mix', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'thrown', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'cast', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Victor', 'Underworld', 'demon', 'villain', 'who', 'essentially', 'same', 'character', 'demon/vampire', 'Anyone', 'else', 'recognize', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'werewolf', 'Underworld', 'also', 'cast', 'one', 'Naberius', 'guardian', 'demons', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'using', 'good', 'character', 'actors', 'role', 'guys', 'are', 'sure', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'so', 'similar', 'really', 'expected', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'come', 'flying', 'save', 'day', 'Oh', 'wait', 'did', 'just', 'made', 'male', 'actor', 'called', 'Adam.Bad', 'movie', 'no', 'said', 'was', 'entertained', 'thought', 'was', 'ok', 'end', 'way', 'original', 'story', 'just', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'Frankenstein', 'story.If', 'Underworld', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'type', 'stories', 'might', 'prefer', 'just', 'go', 'watch', 'Underworld', 'series', 'think', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'looking', 'new', 'original', 'story', 'unique', 'twist', 'Frankenstein', 'legend', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'here']",N/A

Some 200 years later, the &#34;monster&#34; has now returned.  Things are different.  Almost immediately, the monster is attacked by Demons!  Why?  Gargoyles come out of nowhere to try to help the monster!  What the heck?This is a high-action, very impressive CGI film.  It is a fight to save humanity from the Demons.  The Gargoyles are the good guys and, although the battle began long ago, it is now revved up.  The Demons want the monster, but no one knows why.  Meanwhile, we wonder if the monster is a cold-blooded heartless dead thing, or a being with a soul, maybe even human.Wonderful film and great job by Aaron Eckhart (aka-Adam/the Monster).

Perhaps not classic cinema, but better than average on all accounts, with fairly decent (if occasionally hokey) dialogue, an excellent cast of main characters, and commendable use of special effects.Beginning with a very terse introduction to the final pages of Shelly's original novel, Frankenstein's monster, referred to as Adam in this production, is merely borrowed for plot purposes here, so do not expect this to be a faithful adaptation. It was never intended to be, and is only an extended epilogue, taking place in the present day; though there are some subtle parallels regarding the ethics of certain scientific endeavors, and how that related to Victor Frankenstein's experiments two hundred years previous. In the here and now, Adam is sought after by demonic forces who wish to use his body, with all its preternatural strength, for reasons that are probably a bit spoilery, so I will say only that since he is a re-animated corpse, the demons /and/ gargoyles alike have made assumptions about the nature of his life.The gargoyles, it has been mentioned, seem a strange adversary for the demons - this is actually not the case. In medieval Europe, gargoyles were utilized as protectors of churches, as their countenances were thought to ward off evil spirits. This aspect I found refreshing, as while many of the demons were beautiful and alluring on the outside, goodness within was not always equated with an outer appeal. Kudos to the producers for that subtextual nugget of gold.Aside from battling the demons, the gargoyles true mission is to defend mankind from the demons whose sole purpose is to destroy humanity. Neither are initially portrayed as allies to Adam - they are essentially both using him for their own ends because there is one aspect both gargoyles and demons have not accounted for.I cannot agree there was no character growth in this movie. On the contrary, once Terra (a scientist unknowingly in the employ of Wessex, a.k.a. Naberius The Demon Prince) comes onto the scene, Adam's interactions with her eventually force his entire outlook upside down. Everyone has misjudged Adam, but none more than he has himself. The final revelation played heavily upon the overall theme, that is to say, that ""all life is sacred"", which is the reason I suspect so many reviewers are having conniptions over this movie. Based on its own merits, and not of other franchises, which it bore no resemblance to, this was a good, solid film in the vein of old school good vs. evil movies.",5,Brilliant Old School Good Vs.

1554805,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008JFUN1O,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","I've admitted on more than one occasion that I am a horror film fan. True horror fans love nearly every horror film made, the bad as well as the good. Truth be told the majority of those films fall somewhere in the middle, never quite reaching classic status but rarely being so bad as to be putrid. So when you find one that sits in the middle but teeters toward the good side it's a joy. I, FRANKENSTEIN falls into that category.The film opens with a retelling of the Frankenstein tale as told by the creature (Aaron Eckhart) to the point of his creator dying of cold at the North Pole. The creature returns his body to his homeland and buries him. Before leaving the graveyard he is attacked by demons. Saving the creature from their attack are the gargoyles. A nice twist on the concept of appearance is that the demons look like humans and the gargoyles are actually angles sent to protect mankind. They offer to protect him, going so far as to give him a name (Adam), but he turns them down, accepts the weapons they provide him and wanders the Earth for the next 200 years.During that time Adam finds himself fighting off demons with greater frequency until he is finally drawn back to where it all began, where he was given a chance at redemption. Why is it the demons are searching for Adam? What is it they could want?The story unfolds in bits and pieces, details of which I won't share here. Suffice to say that the lead demon (Bill Nighy) needs either Adam or the book written by Frankenstein himself which explains how he was able to re-animate the corpses he sewed together. It seems that Nighy is funding research on bringing back the dead for supposed scientific purposes. Face it; we all know this won't end well. The truth lies in the fact that Nighy is the lead demon and his real reasons won't be revealed early on.You know from the earliest moments in the film that an eventual beat down between the demons and gargoyles will happen before the film ends. You also get the idea that Adam will be caught in the middle of it all and will be taking out as many demons as he possibly can during that battle. But will he and the gargoyles succeed or will the demons win this battle? And what is their ultimate reason for seeking to re-animate the dead?All questions are answered by the end of the movie. It is the journey to that point that is enjoyable.  I've seen numerous reviews slam this movie as having the worst twist on the Frankenstein creature ever filmed but I have to disagree. With so many standard versions having been made it was nice to see a different direction taken for once. Most importantly with this twist is the discussion rarely held about the creature, the discussion of his having a soul or not. Does he or doesn't he? And if he doesn't is that something that can be changed?In such wild roles you would think actors would come off as over the top, but that's not the case here. Each and every one makes their character believable, not and easy task with this material. To help them along an extreme use of CGI (computer generated images) are used to make both demons and gargoyles seem alive on screen.Brought to you by the same people responsible for the UNDERWORLD series of films, this movie looks a lot like those with vampires and werewolves replaced by demons and gargoyles. It has that same blue tint to nearly the entire film and given that Nighy was in the earlier series there are moment you could see it as just another episode. But the change in creatures helps alter that a bit.Is this the greatest thing since sliced bread? By all means no. But it does offer a brief entertainment that will have you rooting for the creature and enjoying some fantastic special effects. It's one I've thought I might continue to enjoy in the future. It all depends on your likes and dislikes.

The fight scenes and the Gothic imagery really amped me up for some reason.  Maybe it&#8217;s because I love unique takes on existing mythologies.  But regardless of why, I knew I had to see this film!  And thankfully, the fine folks at Lionsgate saw fit to grant my request.  I, FRANKENSTEIN is an adrenaline-charged reimagining of Mary Shelley&#8217;s classic horror story and one heck of a ride!I didn&#8217;t realize this film was based on a graphic novel until after I watched it.  But what makes this piece of information impressive is that Kevin Grevioux, who portrays Dekar in the film AND who wrote the screenplay, actually wrote the graphic novel as well!  This guy is a major powerhouse!!  I loved the UNDERWORLD series, which he also wrote and starred in, so this is just one more feather in his cap.I, FRANKENSTEIN is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  Do yourself a favor and watch this in 3D; you will not be disappointed.  The lighting and imagery make the movie burst from the screen in 3D, and the result is a visual feast for the eyes.  The look of the movie is half of what makes it so good.But the story is the other half.  I&#8217;ve said before that I love unique twists on existing tales, and this is definitely one of those to love.  Grevioux weaves several new elements into the Frankenstein mythos and gives us so much more to love.  I particularly like the Gargoyles and how he makes them &#8216;guardians&#8217; commissioned by the Archangel Gabriel.  This is a wildly fascinating concept and shows the massive depths of the man&#8217;s imagination.There are many folks out there that will not enjoy I, FRANKENSTEIN, simply because it is way outside the normal parameters of entertainment.  Although it had a wide theatrical release, it is not a mainstream film.  But if you loved titles like UNDERWORLD, then this one is right up your alley.I, FRANKENSTEIN is a major win for me, and I suggest giving it a look.  Filled with impressive visuals and original concepts, this film has many different aspects for appeal and should attract a wide variety of genre-lovers.  Make sure you watch it on Blu-ray at least, though, so you can truly enjoy the effects.

The graphics were good. There was just enough of the original Frankenstein story to make it recognizable, but small twists to make it a little different. What I really enjoyed about the story was the introduction of gargoyles. During a tour in Europe, I was told that the gargoyles that I saw on various buildings were to ward off evil. Contrary to my previous understanding of what they meant (evil), I begin to embrace them and wondered why no one (besides the SyFy channel) has tackled the subject. The possibilities were endless. So, when I initially saw that this movie would include them, I was hooked and wanted to see it. Personally, I wasn't disappointed! I loved it. There was a brooding recreation (whose creator attempted to kill), evil demons, treacherous archangels, some good guys, some bad guys, son ""gray"" guys (not really good or bad), and tons of flying gargoyles (who were heroic and honorable). And for those who berate the graphics, I thought they were good. I mean... ok, we all know some CGI can be corny...and unrealistic, but what do you expect? How many gargoyles do you see change/morphs into a person on a daily basis. This is fantasy, pure fiction.... so the cornier the better.  And while I do agree with some reviewers that there were definite undertones of Underworld...in the setting and feel, that is ok, because I love that franchise too! And it probably doesn't help that Bill Nighy plays once again the bad/demon in this movie.  Regardless, I think I, Frankenstein was able to stand on its own. I give this movie 4 stars. Why? Because this was a solid play on the Shelley classic (a new twist on an old tale), there were some great fight scenes, a decent plot (retribution/redemption) and gargoyles.

It's connection with 'Underworld' is right there on the package. And of course it uses so many of the same actors in so many of the same sort of roles. The lighting and photography are obviously from the same hands too.But on just a little further consideration this Frankenstein seems to be more like 'Blade' in white face.In the Blade universe you have the humans - who are more or less just spectators because they lack enhanced powers. In 'I, Frankenstein' the same. In Blade the vampires when stabbed suddenly combust - same in Frankenstein. In Blade there are contending groups of vampires but Blade belongs to no faction - he is unique. This too is the same in Frankenstein.So on the whole this is very familiar territory. It is not, of course, anything like the Frankenstein story. The true Frankenstein story is just a brief set up at the beginning to explain why Aaron Eckhart has all those facial scars. Otherwise we might think he was just a graduate of some German University like Heidelberg.There is nothing very Frankenstinian about Eckhart. The Monster in the book is physically much larger as I remember. Most of the actors who played the monster were big men until little Robert De Nero took on the part.

1554833,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B008JFUN1O,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[1, 3]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;I, Frankenstein&#8221; (USA, 2014)1. One of the worst movies of 2014, this movie is really only useful to recalibrate your critical skills so you can better identify movies that are actually good.2. The first 2 minutes of the movie summarizes the original story of &#8220;Frankenstein&#8221;, and picks up where the creature is mourning the loss of Dr. Frankenstein. So the title character of the movie is dead within about 120 seconds. But whatever.3. While the creature is standing at the grave of his creator he is attacked by demons, who want to collect him. And it turns out that all those stone gargoyles on churches are actually alive. Their mission on Earth is to fight the demons. Somehow, the gargoyles see the attack on the creature, and come to his aid.4. Nine minutes into the movie, the creature is brought before the Gargoyle Queen, who realizes that the creature doesn&#8217;t have a name. So she names him Adam. At this point, the movie should probably be named &#8220;I, Adam&#8221;. But whatever.5. The demon leader is played by Bill Nighy, who also plays the vampire leader in the &#8220;Underworld&#8221; series. The filmmakers don&#8217;t even pretend that they aren&#8217;t copying that formula.6. The demons have been trying unsuccessfully for centuries to animate corpses, but even with all the modern technology they can&#8217;t figure out how to do it. They desperately want Dr. Frankenstein&#8217;s scientific diary, since he reanimated a corpse simply with a tub of eels and a little lightning. They need the corpses so that demons from hell can possess them, since only bodies without souls can be possessed. Which completely invalidates all the other horror movies about possession and exorcism. But whatever.7. At one point, the demons capture the Gargoyle Queen. This is bad for the gargoyles, because the Queen is the only one with a direct connection to Heaven. This seems to be pretty poor planning on God&#8217;s part. But whatever.8. The special effects are not very impressive. The whole thing feels like a TV-movie. It&#8217;s not remotely suspenseful. During a pivotal scene where Adam confronts the demon leader, I was so not riveted that I paused the movie to check my Facebook.9. There is something wrong with almost every single scene in the movie. It&#8217;s ridiculous. I actually think there&#8217;s a drinking game in here somewhere. But whatever.",1,This could turn into a drinking game.,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,2431,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Frankenstein', '8221', 'USA', '2014', '1', 'One', 'worst', 'movies', '2014', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'useful', 'recalibrate', 'critical', 'skills', 'can', 'better', 'identify', 'movies', 'are', 'actually', 'good.2', 'first', '2', 'minutes', 'movie', 'original', 'story', '8220', 'Frankenstein', '8221', 'up', 'where', 'creature', 'mourning', 'loss', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'title', 'character', 'movie', 'dead', '120', 'seconds', 'whatever.3', 'creature', 'standing', 'grave', 'creator', 'attacked', 'demons', 'who', 'want', 'collect', 'out', 'stone', 'gargoyles', 'churches', 'are', 'actually', 'alive', 'mission', 'Earth', 'fight', 'demons', 'Somehow', 'gargoyles', 'see', 'attack', 'creature', 'come', 'aid.4', 'Nine', 'minutes', 'movie', 'creature', 'brought', 'Gargoyle', 'Queen', 'who', 'creature', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'name', 'Adam', 'point', 'movie', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'named', '8220', 'Adam', '8221', 'whatever.5', 'demon', 'leader', 'played', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'also', 'vampire', 'leader', '8220', 'Underworld', '8221', 'series', 'filmmakers', 'don', '8217', 'even', 'pretend', 'aren', '8217', 'copying', 'formula.6', 'demons', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'centuries', 'animate', 'corpses', 'even', 'modern', 'technology', 'can', '8217', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'do', 'desperately', 'want', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', '8217', 'scientific', 'diary', 'reanimated', 'corpse', 'simply', 'tub', 'eels', 'little', 'lightning', 'need', 'corpses', 'demons', 'hell', 'can', 'possess', 'only', 'bodies', 'souls', 'can', 'be', 'possessed', 'Which', 'completely', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'possession', 'exorcism', 'whatever.7', 'one', 'point', 'demons', 'capture', 'Gargoyle', 'Queen', 'bad', 'gargoyles', 'Queen', 'only', 'one', 'direct', 'connection', 'Heaven', 'be', 'pretty', 'poor', 'planning', 'God', '8217', 's', 'part', 'whatever.8', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'impressive', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'TV-movie', '8217', 'not', 'remotely', 'suspenseful', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'where', 'Adam', 'demon', 'leader', 'was', 'so', 'not', 'riveted', 'paused', 'movie', 'check', 'Facebook.9', 'something', 'wrong', 'almost', 'single', 'scene', 'movie', '8217', 'ridiculous', 'actually', 'think', '8217', 's', 'drinking', 'game', 'here', 'somewhere']",N/A

Zwick,"[3, 4]","The whole time I was watching &#8220;I, Frankenstein,&#8221; I kept envisioning poor Mary Shelley turning over in her grave seeing what had become of her classic creation. In this sequel set in modern times, the story is as stitched-together as the main character, what with Victor Frankenstein&#8217;s &#8220;monster&#8221; being recruited by a race of living gargoyles whose sole mission is to protect humanity from Satan&#8217;s army of demons. I kid you not. Meanwhile, a group of scientists is intent on using the 200-year-old creature to try and duplicate the old doc&#8217;s unprecedented achievement in human reanimation.Director Stuart Beattie&#8217;s giggle-inducing screenplay - one wonders how the actors manage to keep a straight face while reciting the dopey dialogue - is just an excuse for a lot of incoherent action scenes, as hordes of animated statues and creatures straight from the pit of hell do battle with one another to no discernible point or purpose, while the filmmakers run amok with oodles and oodles of costly CGI. There&#8217;s nothing to engage the audience in either the story or the characters, which is a serious problem for any movie based on &#8220;Frankenstein,&#8220; since the main character, when played right, has the ability to evoke a deep pathos within the viewer, given all the maltreatment he endures at the hands of thoughtless, uncomprehending people. Popular misconceptions notwithstanding, Frankenstein&#8217;s monster is not really supposed to be this much of a stiff.I choose not to blame the normally fine, and now impressively buffed-out Aaron Elkhart (unless that too is a product of CGI) for this failing but rather the material he&#8217;s been given to work with here, but, either way, I seriously doubt that, in years to come,  the actor will be pointing to this as one of his prouder career moves.

He shows in this film that he doesn't have to rely on his appearance to do well. His acting and the special effects are by far the best things about this movie. The script, as is mentioned in the featurette about the making of the film, is a patchwork of the ideas of several writers, and it shows. It opens as a sequel to the original novel, filling us in on what happened after Dr. Frankenstein pursues his &#34;monster&#34; into the Arctic, hoping to destroy him once and for all. So far so good. The &#34;monster&#34; has become quite articulate and can even read, but that's acceptable after 200 years of being on the loose (despite the fact that he's supposedly on his own during most of that time). It gets messy when two groups of non-humans, demons and gargoyles, begin battling each other for possession of the &#34;monster&#34; and/or Dr. Frankenstein's scientific diary. Bothe of these non-human species can and do take human form and fly (demons without visible wings) when they aren't battling. The demons are obviously evil, but what about the demons? Can the &#34;soulless monster&#34; really trust them and, if so, when they deceive him once, should he trust them a second time?There are 2 scientists working for the demons, somehow unaware that they are helping the evil demons realize their plan to reanimate thousands of dead humans who, once dead, are soulless. Once they are reanimated, they, like the &#34;monster&#34; can be injected with evils demonic souls from hell. These dead humans with demon souls will then destroy the gargoyles and destroy and/or enslave the rest of mankind.Eckhardt, as the &#34;monster&#34;, has to deal with all this whether he likes it or not.It's an enjoyable watch with lots of high-tech special effects, mostly CGI, so I'd advise fans of the original story to see this, but it's probably not worth watching more than once.

It seems Naberius' boss is Satan himself, and I don't mean the hockey player. The reason why they want Frankenstein is unclear, but later reveals itself...and how.Since the powers of evil want Mr. F. Stein, so do the powers of good which are gargoyles. They are lead by Leonore (Miranda Otto) who now has elven ears, but too late; Viggo Mortensen isn't in this film. They want Frankenstein who she now names Adam (Aaron Eckhart) because that sounded significant to the script writers who haven't had a brilliant idea yet.The film moves to the current age (pun intended) where Mr. Wessox (Bill Nighy again- wink wink nudge nudge) leads a group of re-animaters (Yvonne Strahovski).The special effects were decent. When demons die they burst into flames like flash powder and nothing around them burns, sort of like CG fire. Indeed, the fighting was the best part of the film because when someone had to read a line, the film died. (pun almost intended).

1554895,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B008JFUN1O,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[7, 11]","When I saw previews of this movie, I thought, ""Underworld"" all over again. I thought the Frankenstein twist might be interesting however. Turns out, it wasn't. Not because Frankenstein's creature isn't an interesting character, but because in this movie, he's a cardboard cut-out. Well, so is everyone else as well. Plenty of people have commented on being confused about what this movie has to do with Frankenstein, the story, and their confusion is understandable. Frankenstein is a gimmick here, not a real character.That's the problem with basing movies on graphic novels. What works in them, doesn't always translate well to film unless you've got a really cracker-jack screen writing team. Without them, the broad strokes and oversimplifications and stereotypes common to a graphic novel just look silly. And so it does throughout this film.Aaron Eckhart actually does a good job playing ""Adam"" Frankenstein, the monster of the legendary story. But the writers gave him none of the depth, personality or humanity that Shelly did in the original novel. Instead he has one dimension -  being pissed off for being alive. Yeah, even scarred up he looks like a super model (so why does everyone reject him?) and could probably be a really nice guy if anyone treated him decently. People complain that Eckhart didn't do a good job with the character. I thought he did fine, considering there was almost NO character to deal with anyway! His Adam is just plain old pissed off. Never manages to get much beyond that.In the beginning of the film we can't even see WHY he is pissed. It is so vague what happens. Apparently, ""Daddy"" Frankenstein tries to kill him by tossing him off a bridge or something, and he retaliates by killing Daddy's new bride, and then Daddy chases him all over the place until he (Daddy) freezes to death. Yeah, this stuff was KIND of in the Shelly story, but that was an ENTIRE NOVEL, not a 5 minute synopsis. At this point, we leave the original story far behind for something much more cliche and less grand. No wonder the audience was confused!So Adam takes Daddy's body back home and buries it, and things are only going to get worse. Apparently, he is a source of great interest to a demon horde hoping to raise the dead so other demons can possess the bodies. Okay, fair enough, he's a type of precious resource, even if it's for the ""bad"" guys.But, then enter ""good guys"", a bunch of gargoyles/angels who apparently have one purpose -- wait for it -- to stop the demon horde from taking over the earth by possessing reanimated corpses. So, they too have an interest in Adam, if only to keep him out of the hands of the demons.This presents another confusion. Why neither of these two groups did anything with Victor Frankenstein (""Daddy"") while he was alive and could be of use to them is anybody's guess, except maybe cardboard characters really can't think in more than one dimension. Sigh, well to continue...What follows is the usual absurdity, similar to the first of the Underworld series. Adam is caught between the warring factions and must fight for his own survival. Of course, to do that he gets tossed between the factions and treated pretty much like a thing (the whole argument in the original novel is that he has HUMAN feelings and passions and deserves to be treated with kindness and compassion) driving home the point that he will never find acceptance, not on earth, nor in heaven, nor in hell. He is the ultimate loner.The angelic gargoyles treat him like a criminal (way to go, good guys, don't bother to right an injustice given the chance, just aggravate it!), the demons simply want to capture and exploit him. Quite frankly, for the first 3/4 of the film, I was on the side of going with the demons because they might at least give him a decent meal!Humanity on the other hand is totally ignorant and absent in all the conflict and proceedings. I guess humans have no say in the matter, and have just been dismissed (except for the vague references that the demons want to rule humans - why I cannot possibly imagine) and the angels don't want them to succeed.So basically we have conflict for conflict's sake, and because it makes a good excuse for some spiffy CGI effects. There are a couple of humans, scientists, who appear in the film, but they are just tools to help the demon prince revivify his army of corpses. This, of course, fails in the grand style that Dracula's children fail in Van Helsing.The problems with this film are:One dimensional characters who do not really develop over time.Pointless and uninteresting dialog.Confusion of good vs evil. If you're going to have this going for you, the good ought to DO good, and the evil ought to DO evil. Just saying they represent one or the other, while beating the crap out of each other, is morally bankrupt.Lack of a reason to care. We can almost care about Adam Frankenstein. He gets treated like garbage by everyone in the film, except for the female scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) Terra Wade, who is also one dimensional, but shows a slight amount of compassion for Adam when he is wounded in a fight. We almost care about her because of this, but she never develops.They brought in some powerful actors for this movie, including Bill Nighy as the demon prince. He walks through the part because, he has no real part to perform.In the end, it seems like this movie has less depth than a TV commercial, in fact, there are TV commercials that are far more

1554896,A1Q3GEO516I4VK,B008JFUN1O,Twisted Slasher,"[52, 65]","I, Frankenstein bears more than a little obvious resemblance to the Underworld series, including at least two actors returning from that series to play very similar characters.  Although Aaron Eckhart isn't as adorable in tight leather as Kate Beckinsale, in my humble opinion.But all fans of the Underworld films, or at least fans of the first movie in the series, should definitely enjoy this.  I, Frankenstein takes the premise of the Mary Shelley book then wildly develops into its own mythos to include Frankenstein's monster helping warriors from heaven (in the form of gargoyles) hunting down demons.  It sounds strange at first, and admittedly doesn't get less strange when it's revealed what in the world Frankenstein's monster has to do with any of this, but it's at least buyable for what this movie is trying to accomplish.Also like Underworld, the movie features tons of great action scenes and takes itself way too seriously for the type of film it is, but I think I prefer it that way compared to something like Van Helsing, where there were far too many cheesy one-liners for its own good.  Moreover, Bill Nighy plays the villain in this, and he's gloriously over the top in his wickedness, and it's awesome.The look of I, Frankenstein is the best part of the movie.  The settings are very gothic and give off a great atmosphere.  The CGI looks cartoony in spots, but mostly looks great.  The gargoyles look amazing, but the demons...are a little goofy.  At least two of the female actresses are easy on the eyes in this movie and Aaron Eckhart and Jai Courtney will give the ladies something to gawk at too.  So on that note, I, Frankenstein is a good...date movie?Well, the movie's certainly not for everyone and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for high class or a faithful version of the classic novel, but for check-your-brain-at-the-door action-horror, there's far worse out there.",3,Very entertaining,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1923,"['Frankenstein', 'more', 'little', 'obvious', 'resemblance', 'Underworld', 'series', 'including', 'least', 'two', 'actors', 'returning', 'series', 'play', 'very', 'similar', 'characters', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', ""n't"", 'as', 'adorable', 'tight', 'leather', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'humble', 'opinion.But', 'fans', 'Underworld', 'films', 'least', 'fans', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'should', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'Frankenstein', 'premise', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'book', 'then', 'wildly', 'own', 'mythos', 'include', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'helping', 'warriors', 'heaven', 'form', 'gargoyles', 'hunting', 'down', 'demons', 'strange', 'first', 'admittedly', ""n't"", 'get', 'less', 'strange', 'when', 'revealed', 'what', 'world', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'do', 'least', 'buyable', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'accomplish.Also', 'Underworld', 'movie', 'tons', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'type', 'film', 'think', 'prefer', 'way', 'compared', 'something', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'where', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'cheesy', 'one-liners', 'own', 'good', 'Moreover', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'villain', 'gloriously', 'top', 'wickedness', 'awesome.The', 'look', 'Frankenstein', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'settings', 'are', 'very', 'gothic', 'give', 'off', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'CGI', 'cartoony', 'spots', 'mostly', 'great', 'gargoyles', 'look', 'amazing', 'demons', 'are', 'little', 'goofy', 'least', 'two', 'female', 'actresses', 'are', 'easy', 'eyes', 'movie', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Jai', 'Courtney', 'will', 'give', 'ladies', 'something', 'gawk', 'too', 'So', 'note', 'Frankenstein', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'Well', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'high', 'class', 'faithful', 'version', 'classic', 'novel', 'check-your-brain-at-the-door', 'action-horror', 'far', 'worse', 'there']",N/A

The storyline did not come across as rehashed and had some interesting new twists. The special effects were very good. The fight scenes were well done and two fight scenes were excellent. Everything comes to a nice ending and I was not left with an impression anything was incomplete.Now to Aaron Eckhart. He did a lot better than I anticipated but he just didn't seem 'right' in this role. My biggest gripe with his acting was the constant scowl on his face and his anger mode. It looked forced and out of place. Unfortunately both the facial expressions and his odd anger preoccupied my attention more than it should have. It was just a bit over the top. However, it was not to the point that I did not enjoy the movie.No bad words, no nekkid people. Lots of violence and death scenes but no extreme blood and gore.

Both are obviously such thoughtless actions.  Both require minimal mental capability.  And both really occur with such frequency that we don't care anymore in our grander society.How many movies like this dreck get cranked out from the Hollywood factories?  It used to be a flick with this low grade quality and high budget would see release two or three times a year-tops.  But nots no more.  They put out this drivel on a nearly weekly basis.  And the same mindless drones that go to the movies line up and file into to see it.  Not many.  It tanked hard at the good ol' B.O. but it still attracted 1.9 million people.  I'm going to ponder that for 20 seconds (or the amount of time it took the film's screenwriter to plod out half a page of dialogue.)  What 1.9 million people actually needed, wanted or should have spent two hours watching this?  Are their standards for entertainment so low that they just had to see this film?And it's not just them.  Think of who is even buying this Blu Ray for their collection.  Is anybody buying this that is highly selective and sees this as fitting in their libraries.  Or do they just have a massive wall of Blu Rays cause they are too ignint to just get Netflix?And how about those that at least show some restraint and wait until it's on cable.  There are currently 781 movies on the premium channels on demand line ups across the wide spectrum.

The writers seem to think we need to see humans when the gargoyles speak.  Really distracting.  Also, they are essentially angels that can transform into living statues.  Why should we care?  The writers gave us nothing to make these creatures novel.  Just lazy.The demons are nothing special either.  In fact they really look like every vampire you've ever seen in movies.  They even die EXACTLY like the vampires in the Blade series!  Again, lazy.  They actually have to run everywhere.  Even vampires have powers.Frankenstein's monster--acted perfectly by Aaron Eckhart--is not as believable or imposing because of the same type of failure in make-up/costumes/effects.  Eckhart acts and moves as if he is a hideous and tortured being, but his look is just not intimidating.  His body is not a stitched together series of parts, but a good looking fit man with consistent skin tone (tanned) and some stitching scars.  His face is not disproportionate.  No big chin.  No weird head. NOTHING to remind us that this thing is not human.  You could put him on GQ in full movie make-up.  Lazy.The story is mildly interesting, but the laziness of this production comes through again.  The story is not developed to its true potential.  It's as if someone had a great starting idea and everybody just threw their hands up and cheered--we have a story!  No . . . No . . . read a book once in a while, Hollywood.  Every character, every group, every facet of the story is UNDEVELOPED.So, what is good about this movie?  When the gargoyles are gargoyles they are amazing and have some fun fight scenes.  The acting is excellent.  I mean, what a wasted cast!  You could really see Eckhart trying to BE Frankenstein's monster, but without proper effects or make-up, it just seems silly sometimes.Wasted cast.  Lazy effects and make-up.  Lazy writers.
