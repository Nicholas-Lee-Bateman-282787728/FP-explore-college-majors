Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 5]","Traveling vicariously with Ewan McGregor (Island) and Charley Boorman inLong Way Round, I was pleased to see them continue their adventures in LONG WAY DOWN, a trip from the top of Scotland to the bottom of Africa.I thoroughly enjoyed Long Way Round. Their travels were tremendously entertaining, with absent roadways, accidents, and playful banter that made it a fun travelogue. It was also strange to see such out-of-the-way places where roads vanished, streams swelled requiring special crossings, and the people that turned out and took them in. It was a microcosm event where we got inside the heads of both the travelers and those they visited.But things changed for the worse with Long Way Down.First is the overuse of the helmet cameras and microphones. The sound was often exceptionally muffled, forcing one to rewind the DVD and turn up the volume in hopes of hearing what was said. The helmet cams, too, gave poor quality video and were often grimy or rain-splattered, not letting the viewer enjoy the sites around Africa and beyond.And where Long Way Round started off with a bang, giving us some great entertainment right from episode one, Long Way Down didn't really pick-up for me until episode four when we are fully entrenched in Africa's amazing countries.It was also a bit perturbing to see so much time given over to their time with UNICEF. Although I think this is a very worthy cause, it isn't why I like watching travel diaries like this. I want to experience the road and the people and the countryside. Having it on the DVD's extra features was fine, which is where most of the UNICEF information should've remained (I still would've watched the extras, too).For those familiar with Long Way Round, they'll be happy to learn that Claudio is back in the saddle with our two boys, filming every move and crashing and burning yet again! The guy needs to pay closer attention to the road.There's been some negative comments made about Ewan's wife's choice to join them on one leg of the journey. I thought this was excellent. She turned out to be a good diversion for Ewan and Charley, as well as quickly becoming an adequate motorcyclist.I will also say that it was wonderful to see so many different cultures as the two crossed the African plains. I was particularly impressed with Ethiopa, which I'd always pictured as arid and depressing. But here we get to see the lushness of its green, verdant lands ...and it's incredibly gentle people.Indeed, all of the people Charley and Ewan meet are amazingly gracious and hospitable. Perhaps even more than the tough roads they traveled. Many miles and many friends were passed during this trip. And I'm glad I watched it. Just not as glad as when I'd finished Long Way Round.",3,Not As Good As Long Way Round ...But Still A Decent Travelogue,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,2744,"['Traveling', 'vicariously', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Island', 'Charley', 'Boorman', 'inLong', 'Way', 'Round', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'continue', 'adventures', 'LONG', 'WAY', 'DOWN', 'trip', 'top', 'Scotland', 'bottom', 'Africa.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'travels', 'were', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'absent', 'roadways', 'accidents', 'playful', 'banter', 'made', 'fun', 'travelogue', 'was', 'also', 'strange', 'see', 'such', 'out-of-the-way', 'places', 'where', 'roads', 'vanished', 'streams', 'swelled', 'requiring', 'special', 'crossings', 'people', 'turned', 'out', 'took', 'was', 'microcosm', 'event', 'where', 'got', 'heads', 'travelers', 'visited.But', 'things', 'changed', 'worse', 'Long', 'Way', 'Down.First', 'overuse', 'helmet', 'cameras', 'microphones', 'sound', 'was', 'often', 'exceptionally', 'muffled', 'forcing', 'one', 'rewind', 'DVD', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'hopes', 'hearing', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'helmet', 'cams', 'too', 'gave', 'poor', 'quality', 'video', 'were', 'often', 'grimy', 'rain-splattered', 'not', 'letting', 'viewer', 'enjoy', 'sites', 'Africa', 'beyond.And', 'where', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'started', 'off', 'bang', 'giving', 'great', 'entertainment', 'right', 'episode', 'one', 'Long', 'Way', 'Down', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'pick-up', 'episode', 'four', 'when', 'are', 'fully', 'entrenched', 'Africa', 'amazing', 'countries.It', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'perturbing', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'given', 'time', 'UNICEF', 'think', 'very', 'worthy', 'cause', ""n't"", 'why', 'like', 'watching', 'travel', 'diaries', 'want', 'experience', 'road', 'people', 'countryside', 'Having', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'was', 'fine', 'where', 'most', 'UNICEF', 'information', 'should', ""'ve"", 'remained', 'still', 'would', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'extras', 'too', '.For', 'familiar', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'learn', 'Claudio', 'back', 'saddle', 'two', 'boys', 'filming', 'move', 'crashing', 'burning', 'yet', 'again', 'guy', 'pay', 'closer', 'attention', 'road.There', 'been', 'negative', 'comments', 'made', 'Ewan', 'wife', 'choice', 'join', 'one', 'leg', 'journey', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'diversion', 'Ewan', 'Charley', 'as', 'well', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'adequate', 'motorcyclist.I', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'was', 'wonderful', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'cultures', 'two', 'crossed', 'African', 'plains', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Ethiopa', ""'d"", 'always', 'pictured', 'arid', 'depressing', 'here', 'get', 'see', 'lushness', 'green', 'verdant', 'lands', 'incredibly', 'gentle', 'people.Indeed', 'people', 'Charley', 'Ewan', 'meet', 'are', 'amazingly', 'gracious', 'hospitable', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'tough', 'roads', 'traveled', 'Many', 'miles', 'many', 'friends', 'were', 'passed', 'trip', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'Just', 'not', 'as', 'glad', 'when', ""'d"", 'finished', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round']",Long Way Down: Complete Series

1097020,A3LVXNUEVUQA9T,B000UX5GFQ,Echolocation,"[3, 4]",I'll make it short.  Long way round was very special because you had two friends in an adventure and struggle that was truly amazing to watch. It's a very rare event in life when you can leave the wife and family and trek across the world with one of your best friends.  Ewan ruined that whole dynamic by dragging his wife along for part of the journey without even asking anyone else involved and on top of that she never even RODE a bike before- awful.  Ewan's brother Colin had more reason to be there. The tension is palpable and puts a sour note over what had the potential to be a truly unique sequel.Granted there were other issues as people mentioned so I won't go into them but I really think this was a major one that needed to be touched on more deeply. I lost a lot of respect for Ewan and I'm sure Charley and their crew did as well for putting a damper on what was a very special thing. This is not an anti-female/anti-wife thing as the reviewer Amber pointed out but come on- she had to know this would cause tension and could have gone on a separate bike trip. Eve was probably at Ewan's bachelor party- that's if he was allowed to have one.,2,Ewan just had to bring the wife,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1157,"[""'ll"", 'make', 'short', 'Long', 'way', 'round', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'had', 'two', 'friends', 'adventure', 'struggle', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'watch', 'very', 'rare', 'event', 'life', 'when', 'can', 'leave', 'wife', 'family', 'trek', 'world', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'Ewan', 'ruined', 'whole', 'dynamic', 'dragging', 'wife', 'part', 'journey', 'even', 'asking', 'anyone', 'else', 'involved', 'top', 'never', 'even', 'RODE', 'bike', 'before-', 'awful', 'Ewan', 'brother', 'Colin', 'had', 'more', 'reason', 'be', 'there', 'tension', 'palpable', 'sour', 'note', 'what', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'truly', 'unique', 'sequel.Granted', 'were', 'other', 'issues', 'people', 'mentioned', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'major', 'one', 'needed', 'be', 'touched', 'more', 'deeply', 'lost', 'lot', 'respect', 'Ewan', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Charley', 'crew', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'putting', 'damper', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'thing', 'not', 'anti-female/anti-wife', 'thing', 'reviewer', 'Amber', 'pointed', 'out', 'come', 'on-', 'had', 'know', 'would', 'cause', 'tension', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'separate', 'bike', 'trip', 'Eve', 'was', 'probably', 'Ewan', 'bachelor', 'party-', 'was', 'allowed', 'have', 'one']",Long Way Down: Complete Series

They equipped themselves more effectively with customized SUV chase vehicles, and a revised loadout for their BMW GS1200 Adventure bikes. It also helped they didn't have to pack so much cold weather gear from what I could tell. Their trip through Europe and Northern Africa was a bit rushed based on their schedule, I would have liked to see them explore more of Egypt. There are 10 episodes, which was an improvement over Long Way Round. Eva, Ewan's wife, is shown learning to ride a bike, and tagged along for a portion of the journey towards the end. Although it must have been an exciting adventure for her, I felt she was just a third wheel in the whole scheme of things.I hope to see their journey in South and North America, if that ever comes to fruition!Overall: 5/5 stars",5,Better than the first,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,955,"['Long', 'Way', 'DownLong', 'Way', 'Down', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'mainly', 'crew', 'lessons', 'learned', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'Charley', 'excursion', 'Dakar', 'rally', 'equipped', 'more', 'effectively', 'customized', 'SUV', 'chase', 'vehicles', 'revised', 'loadout', 'BMW', 'GS1200', 'Adventure', 'also', 'helped', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pack', 'so', 'much', 'cold', 'weather', 'gear', 'what', 'could', 'tell', 'trip', 'Europe', 'Northern', 'Africa', 'was', 'bit', 'rushed', 'based', 'schedule', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'explore', 'more', 'Egypt', 'are', '10', 'episodes', 'was', 'improvement', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'Eva', 'Ewan', 'wife', 'shown', 'learning', 'ride', 'bike', 'tagged', 'along', 'portion', 'journey', 'end', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'exciting', 'adventure', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'third', 'wheel', 'whole', 'scheme', 'things.I', 'hope', 'see', 'journey', 'South', 'North', 'America', 'ever', 'fruition', 'Overall', '5/5', 'stars']",Long Way Down: Complete Series

I was *so* looking forward to seeing that vibe again in Long Way Down. It was mostly there, but there were three major detractors:1. Less focus on food and eating and what they were really thinking and doing, and what Claudio was doing, and their arguments, etc. (those appear to have been edited out or not filmed).2. Ewan was all clean-shaven the whole time and more self- and power-conscious. I hope he can get back to how he was before, guess that's not probably possible. I missed his self-immolation in the trip from the first one.3. Eve: I agree with an earlier poster that as a woman I am not criticising based on gender, but sorry, Eve just was not helpful on the trip. She was boring, it looked like she didn't even try to pick up her own bike when she fell over (many times). I concur with the earlier poster that Eve should not have inserted herself (for pretty much obviously selfish reasons). I was glad also that she wasn't there long. Charley was really nice and well-behaved about that whole thing. But Olly didn't drag things down by insisting on coming along, so he was out of the issue. Plus, Ewan and Charley are funny and interesting. When Eve was there, I found her quite dull, not being a guy who appreciates a cute face or whatever. I got tired of Ewan saying how great she was when she obviously wasn't, and I hope that Ewan and Eve can do their own trips separately from the ""Long Way"" series in future. Sorry to feel this way, as I'm all about girl power, but sheesh. I didn't sign on to see a girly girl with only a husband to recommend her get coddled along with the guys. Eve probably had a great time, and I'm glad Ewan liked having her there, but I found her to be a drag.Apart from these negative observations, I loved how the team went through Africa. I felt like getting more involved in HIV/AIDS volunteering.

I actually thought the Long Way Round was better between the two books, but when it comes to the video, Long Way Down was so much more rich and compelling.  I think it's because they had more time to get involved with meeting people and delving deeper in the culture.  These two are an absolute blast to watch because they are so different, but yet they compliment one another so well.  Ewan is committed and competitive, determined to keep on the throttle and not tip in the sand, vying for approval . . . while Charley is grinning like a kid on his first bike, popping wheelies, bunji jumping, and getting good and grubby.  It's a shame we don't see Charley on the big screen as much as Ewan because he's an absolute joy to watch and listen to.  I'm really looking forward to the Long Way Up because Ewan and Charley are the new dynamic duo in my book.
