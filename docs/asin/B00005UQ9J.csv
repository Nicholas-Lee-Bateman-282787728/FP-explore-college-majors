685342,A1QI4ATF368A9B,B00005UQ9J,Allison,"[1, 2]","A passable conman flick. Vince Vaughn plays telemarketing scammer Pendelton ""Penny"" Wise who sells phony vacations to unsuspecting callers. The firm he works for is about to go under. He takes care of his crippled friend, Joel (Rory Cochrane). When the firm goes out of business, Vaughn hooks up with infamous conman Kelly Grant (Ed Harris) and his gal pal Caitlin (Julia Ormond).The film starts out with colorful, interesting characters played by Stephen Tobolowsky, George Wendt, Wallace Shawn, and Kathy Baker, but it jettisons them completely once Vaughn's Penny goes to work for Harris' Kelly Grant.The performances by Vaughn, Cochrane, Harris, and Ormond are topnotch but the screenplay is pretty lackluster. First, the relationship between Penny and his childhood friend, Joel, is poorly developed. Why is Joel on crutches? Was he injured in an accident or is he handicapped? Why is Penny so devoted to his friend, who, quite frankly, is an immature loser and freeloader? Halfway through the film, Joel just seems to disappear. This character could have been completely cut out of the film, and it would not have made much of a difference. I give Cochrane credit for giving such an interesting performance despite the fact that his role is so woefully underwritten.Also, it's pretty obvious that Kelly and Caitlin are up to no good and should not be trusted, and yet, Penny works for them anyway. He seems smarter than that. I thought this stretched the credibility of the film.I also felt let down by the ending. It seemed too ambiguous. It left loose ends.I would recommend this for rental.

685347,A3PAS0KMTCFFGJ,B00005UQ9J,dd,"[4, 6]","I'm not sure if anyone got what I think is the real underlying message here. That is, nice guys finish last. Althought Vince Vaughn's character, Penny, chose a job that involved the sleazy business of telemarketing, he was a nice guy who generally liked and trusted people, at least in person. He had an unfailing yet somewhat naive ethic that assumed people deserve to be treated fairly, and should be defended when confronted by injustice. The movie suggests that these qualities, although noble, are ultimately the cause of Penny's undoing.Penny's likability was a magnet for desperate people (i.e. 1) his gutless co-workers: Penny was the one on whom they depended to stand up against bully employers who either didn't pay or was threatening blackmail; 2) his self-pitying brother: who used his handicap to prey on his good will, freeloading when he was more than capable of getting a job and taking care of himself; and of course, 3) Julia Ormond's character, who manipulated him into an arranged marriage.) Finally, at the end, he weighed his life's actions against their consequences, and decided to do what he thought was right for him.Although the film failed to explain clearly why a person with such compassion and a strong sense of right and wrong would decide to work in such a sleazy environment in the first place, it nevertheless presented a disturbing essay on how good people can be taken advantage of.",4,Disturbing,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,1420,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'got', 'what', 'think', 'real', 'underlying', 'message', 'here', 'nice', 'guys', 'finish', 'last', 'Althought', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'Penny', 'chose', 'job', 'involved', 'sleazy', 'business', 'telemarketing', 'was', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'generally', 'liked', 'trusted', 'people', 'least', 'person', 'had', 'unfailing', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'ethic', 'assumed', 'people', 'deserve', 'be', 'treated', 'fairly', 'should', 'be', 'defended', 'when', 'confronted', 'injustice', 'movie', 'qualities', 'noble', 'are', 'ultimately', 'cause', 'Penny', 'undoing.Penny', 'likability', 'was', 'magnet', 'desperate', 'people', 'i.e', '1', 'gutless', 'co-workers', 'Penny', 'was', 'one', 'whom', 'depended', 'stand', 'up', 'bully', 'employers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'was', 'threatening', 'blackmail', '2', 'self-pitying', 'brother', 'who', 'used', 'handicap', 'prey', 'good', 'will', 'freeloading', 'when', 'was', 'more', 'capable', 'getting', 'job', 'taking', 'care', 'course', '3', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'character', 'who', 'manipulated', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Finally', 'end', 'weighed', 'life', 'actions', 'consequences', 'decided', 'do', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'film', 'failed', 'explain', 'clearly', 'why', 'person', 'such', 'compassion', 'strong', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'would', 'decide', 'work', 'such', 'sleazy', 'environment', 'first', 'place', 'nevertheless', 'presented', 'disturbing', 'essay', 'how', 'good', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'advantage']",N/A

685352,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005UQ9J,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","In truth, I didn't expect much from ""Prime Gig"" and that lowered expectation probably served my viewing experience well. For overall, I did end up enjoying this film in a mild way. The beginning of the film is set within the confines of a failing telemarketing firm with a staff of sad sacks played by great character actors like Wallace Shawn, George Wendt, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Jeanetta Arnette. This was probably my favorite bit of the film and I thought it captured the desperation and shadiness incumbent in the typical telemarketing operation.The opening establishes Penny, played by Vince Vaughn, as the alpha dog seller and self proclaimed ""Norma Rae"" of the office. After an all too brief interlude in this intriguing environment, however, Penny is recruited by a mysterious new operation. Led by Julia Ormond and Ed Harris, this new job is a high stakes, high dollar market for selling shares of a gold mine. We quickly move into familiar territory as we meet the ruthless sales staff and are introduced to high pressure telemarketing. Covered many times before, ""Prime Gig"" lacks the poetry and dynamics of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and the glitz and energy of ""Boiler Room."" It's not badly done, it's just a paler imitation of more noteworthy movies.Ultimately, as in movies of this type, there are no heroes. Everyone is pretty much a scumbag looking to make it rich. This film is a bit disingenuous, though, it wants to have it both ways. We're meant to care about Penny too.  Hey, he's basically a good guy because he takes care of a handicapped friend. Well, that notion didn't particularly work for me. The movie moves toward the inevitable, predictable and still somewhat unconvincing ending. Once again, I think the movie is asking us to feel something for these somewhat reprehensible characters and again I didn't.I'd first recommend either of the similar (but better) movies mentioned above, but ""Prime Gig"" does feature some good performances. If this milieu interests you, you'll likely enjoy much of this film. Really about 3 1/2 stars, I'm rounding down ""Prime Gig"" for not truly embracing its sleaziness.

It's an adrenaline packed,emotionally charged story that carries viewers, on aunique experience or rollercoaster over more than  90 mins.Vaughn reprises, in part, an aspect of his humanity,similar to to one seen inthe other movie LOCUST, (in whichhe interacted with a disabled character called FLYBOY ).He  thereby demonstrates his psychological need to come tothe assistance of his disabled friend who, as said,  hasdifficulty suceeding in life and supporting himself,as abrother's keeper. This clearly lends credibility to hisrole, by making Penny multi-dimensional, not only aworkoholic salesman.Viewers are treated to a perfect synchronicity betweenreal situations and the soundtrack, not unlike was thecase elsewhere in BoilerRoom, (that also had a greatsoundtrack accompanying the story.) This clearly opens upthe sheer humanity of the sales persons, who must focus onreaping their commissions surrounding a gold mining stockpromotion in a boiler room in an undisclosed secretlocation, to regulatory authorities. This contrasts, inother words, with the stereotype of sales as a job, oftenseen as dehumanizing to those who participate in it, fromthe pressure in meeting the sales numbers, on time, and infull.Regarding the selling aspect, PRIME GIG is actually prettyrealistic, showing there's more than one way to skin acat, meaning, different sales people approach salesprospects with different techniques, although they share acommon objective, ""to kill, or fill"" the sales propspect.We see a couple of CD's containing ""leads"", headsets,dialers, a high pressure environment, a sales board,competition between reps for the most number of sales,commission bonuses, euphoria, depression, the illusion ofreps chasing a rainbow, in the job they accepted, as didthe prospects by accepting some sales for some products,that even the salespeople didn't know was a con.The movie has a dramatic, quick ending, bringing to lightanother scourge of modern society, the mortgage fraud.Clearly, viewers won't be able to say enough about theacting skills of Vaughn, Ed Harris, and Ormond as theirintensity on screen, is  simply unbeatable.",4,"An adrenaline packed, emotionally charged story about sales in USA",1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,2320,"['PRIME', 'GIG', 'showcasing', 'acting', 'talent', 'veteranactors', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'lovely', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'thecharismatic', 'head', 'honcho', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'more', 'just', 'aprofessionally', 'made', 'movie', 'adrenaline', 'packed', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'story', 'viewers', 'aunique', 'experience', 'rollercoaster', 'more', '90', 'mins.Vaughn', 'reprises', 'part', 'aspect', 'humanity', 'similar', 'one', 'seen', 'inthe', 'other', 'movie', 'LOCUST', 'whichhe', 'interacted', 'disabled', 'character', 'called', 'FLYBOY', '.He', 'thereby', 'psychological', 'need', 'come', 'tothe', 'assistance', 'disabled', 'friend', 'who', 'said', 'hasdifficulty', 'suceeding', 'life', 'supporting', 'abrother', 'keeper', 'clearly', 'credibility', 'hisrole', 'making', 'Penny', 'multi-dimensional', 'not', 'only', 'aworkoholic', 'salesman.Viewers', 'are', 'treated', 'perfect', 'synchronicity', 'betweenreal', 'situations', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'was', 'thecase', 'elsewhere', 'BoilerRoom', 'also', 'had', 'greatsoundtrack', 'accompanying', 'story', 'clearly', 'upthe', 'sheer', 'humanity', 'sales', 'persons', 'who', 'must', 'focus', 'onreaping', 'commissions', 'surrounding', 'gold', 'mining', 'stockpromotion', 'boiler', 'room', 'undisclosed', 'secretlocation', 'regulatory', 'authorities', 'inother', 'words', 'stereotype', 'sales', 'job', 'oftenseen', 'dehumanizing', 'who', 'participate', 'fromthe', 'pressure', 'meeting', 'sales', 'numbers', 'time', 'infull.Regarding', 'selling', 'aspect', 'PRIME', 'GIG', 'actually', 'prettyrealistic', 'showing', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'skin', 'acat', 'meaning', 'different', 'sales', 'people', 'approach', 'salesprospects', 'different', 'techniques', 'share', 'acommon', 'objective', 'kill', 'fill', 'sales', 'propspect.We', 'see', 'couple', 'CD', 'containing', 'leads', 'headsets', 'dialers', 'high', 'pressure', 'environment', 'sales', 'board', 'competition', 'reps', 'most', 'number', 'sales', 'commission', 'bonuses', 'euphoria', 'depression', 'illusion', 'chasing', 'rainbow', 'job', 'accepted', 'didthe', 'prospects', 'accepting', 'sales', 'products', 'even', 'salespeople', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'con.The', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'quick', 'ending', 'bringing', 'lightanother', 'scourge', 'modern', 'society', 'mortgage', 'fraud.Clearly', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'say', 'enough', 'theacting', 'skills', 'Vaughn', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Ormond', 'theirintensity', 'screen', 'simply', 'unbeatable']",N/A

Frankly it was just really boring. The tension didn't run high enough. You need an emotional investment in the characters in order to care what's going to happen when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan, and these characters don't have enough depth. Plus it's all very predictable...if you watched Boiler Room you have an idea where the film is going to go, but even that didn't pay off, because the downfall is too abrupt. And it's hard to feel sorry for Vaughn's character when he gets screwed at the end...he knew what he was getting into, he didn't trust the boss, and he was right, but he went along anyway.
