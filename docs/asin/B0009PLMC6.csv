All of the sudden Daisuke gets sick and it turns out that they can't do the school play without one of the main characters. Daisuke gets pulled into the world of his painting because of the art work known as the Second hand of time. It turns out that Freedert from the play in the previous dvd ""Ice and Snow"" had a different story to tell. It wasn't really called ""Ice and Snow"", but rather ""Ice and Dark"". The story really was about jealousy and hatred so for that it was a sad story. There was only one bad thing about this dvd. IT LEFT US RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE!!! Other than that this dvd was pretty good and I recommend this to the people who have previously watched the other 5 d.n.angel dvds!!!!",5,Mysteries start to unmask!!!!,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,824,"['learning', 'Mio', 'Hio', 'dissapeared', 'Satoshi', 'began', 'be', 'suspicious', 'being', 'work', 'father', 'sudden', 'Daisuke', 'sick', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'school', 'play', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Daisuke', 'pulled', 'world', 'painting', 'art', 'work', 'known', 'Second', 'hand', 'time', 'out', 'Freedert', 'play', 'previous', 'dvd', 'Ice', 'Snow', 'had', 'different', 'story', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'called', 'Ice', 'Snow', 'rather', 'Ice', 'Dark', 'story', 'really', 'was', 'jealousy', 'hatred', 'so', 'was', 'sad', 'story', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'bad', 'thing', 'dvd', 'IT', 'LEFT', 'US', 'RIGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIDDLE', 'A', 'BATTLE', 'Other', 'dvd', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'previously', 'watched', 'other', '5', 'd.n.angel', 'dvds']",D.N.

910550,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0009PLMC6,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","After the last volume being so good, I expected more from this DVD. Daisuke is trapped inside the painting that he gave to Riku. The girl inside this world is having him paint something for her. Her motivations are unclear. Dark, Riku, and Risa come to rescue him. They are captured; and by doing so they find where Daisuke is being kept. Dark escapes with the girls, but Daisuke stays behind to see if he can help the woman in the world of ice.So essentially nothing has changed.  Satoshi's ancestors apparently created the artifact that has caused this magical power to affect Daisuke's painting. Despite his rivalry, Satoshi is working brhind the scenes to save Daisuke as well.This is a pretty boring volume. Volume 5 is my favorite so far, so I expected more to happen in this DVD. The story has been like a roller coaster. It seems like there is a lot of filler in this anime. Many of the stories don't advance the plot at all. I think that this is one of those filler arcs. With only a few episodes left, D.N. Angel is gonna have to pull off an amazing finish to be above average. I like this series for the most part, but it seems to waste a lot of time with trivial stuff.",3,Stuck in a painting.,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1181,"['last', 'volume', 'being', 'so', 'good', 'expected', 'more', 'DVD', 'Daisuke', 'trapped', 'painting', 'gave', 'Riku', 'girl', 'world', 'having', 'paint', 'something', 'motivations', 'are', 'unclear', 'Dark', 'Riku', 'Risa', 'come', 'rescue', 'are', 'captured', 'doing', 'so', 'find', 'where', 'Daisuke', 'being', 'kept', 'Dark', 'girls', 'Daisuke', 'see', 'can', 'help', 'woman', 'world', 'ice.So', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'changed', 'Satoshi', 'ancestors', 'apparently', 'created', 'artifact', 'caused', 'magical', 'power', 'affect', 'Daisuke', 'painting', 'rivalry', 'Satoshi', 'working', 'scenes', 'save', 'Daisuke', 'well.This', 'pretty', 'boring', 'volume', 'Volume', '5', 'favorite', 'so', 'far', 'expected', 'more', 'happen', 'DVD', 'story', 'been', 'roller', 'coaster', 'lot', 'filler', 'anime', 'Many', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot', 'think', 'one', 'filler', 'arcs', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'left', 'D.N', 'Angel', 'gon', 'na', 'have', 'pull', 'off', 'amazing', 'finish', 'be', 'above', 'average', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'waste', 'lot', 'time', 'trivial', 'stuff']",D.N.

In the middle I started to get into it much more and now that I'm just about to see the ending I find myself surprisingly apathetic towards it. While the series has been good so far and the characters are likable, I just don't feel that emotional involvement I need to be really excited about seeing how the series will end and have no idea if I'm going to be sad to see it end. If you've stuck with it this long you owe it to yourself to see how it ends but now that I've gotten this far in I can't imagine paying full price for this series.
