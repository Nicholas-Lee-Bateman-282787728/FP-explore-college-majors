THIS DOCUMENTARY, WHICH TELLS OF THE MEN WORKING IN THE BOILER ROOMS, HAD STAYED ON THE TITANIC 2 KEEP HER ELECTRICITY ON TO SEND DISTRESS SIGNALS AND TO TRY 2 KEEP THE SHIP FROM SINKING. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS A NOBLE TASK, IT EVENTUALLY WAS A FAILURE. THE MEN ALSO WERE TOLD WHETHER OR NOT TO STAY AND TRY 2 SAVE THE SHIP 4 AS LONG AS THEY CAN. WATER IS CONSTANTLY FLOODING THE SHIP, THE BULKHEADS ARE BREAKING APART, AND MANY OF THE MEN ARE DROWNING. FEAR,DISPAIR, AND CHAOS ERUPTS. THE SHIP IS CREAKING, TILTING LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL IT BREAKS APART IN 2 AND SINKS. ALL OF THE CHIEF ENGINEERS PERISHED. THIS IS A TRULY FRIGHTENING TALE OF THE MEN WHO BRAVED THE ODDS 2 TRY 2 SAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL TRAPPED ON THE TITANIC WHEN ALL OF THE LIFEBOATS WERE LAUNCHED.

1530593,A3CHIONKNQ0MMR,B007G8MN1S,"Tom ""A music and movie  lover""","[3, 3]","This is a very well acted documentary that receates what life was like for those Titanic crew members who worked down in the boiler and engine rooms of the famous ship.  The film is told through the memories of Lead Fireman, Fredrick Barret.  Barret was one of the few men who remained onboard after the collision, toiling away in the boiler rooms of the ship; and he ended up being the only man to survive the sinking who had actually witnessed the impact from inside the vessel.  He personally saw the hull rupture, giving way to sea water flooding into the ship's first five compartments, and thereby assuring her loss.  The film tells his story in retrospect, while he's seated(presumably in England)before a group of Board members of the White Star Line.  They are looking for stories of heroism that they hope will counter all the negative news stories about the ship's sinking, that are so well known today.  The film traces Barrets actions from the time the ship leaves Belfast after her trials, it then covers the preparations for the start of the maiden voyage while docked at Southampton, and finally the start of the first voyage itself.  The viewer is introduced to a number of additional crew members, mainly Engineers, and Electricians, who, as Officers on the Titanic, were responcible for overseeing the daily mechanical operations of the new ship.But the film also tells its' story in relation to what it was actually like for people living at that time.  Along with their kits and clothing, these crew members brought additional, personal baggage onboard that really impacted how this group of men got along with each other. Things like the ridged class structure, the religious wars taking place, particularly in Ireland where the ship was built, and finally, the rank structure of the crew itself.  All of these elements combined and they directly affected these men's lives during their daily routines at sea.  This film tells the story of the hardest working section of the ship; it's also the section that ended up having the fewest survivors.  Many of the these men remained at their posts, trying first to save the ship, and then later, when fully aware that there was no longer any hope, their efforts then became to simply try to extend her life for as long as possible.  Their vital and heroic work saved hundreds of lives, and yet, their story is one of the less commonly covered aspects of this much written about disaster.  Everything about the production is truly first rate.  Excellent sets, and equally excellent acting, make this one of the best documentaries on this subject you will ever see.",5,The Heros who stayed at their posts.,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,2630,"['very', 'well', 'acted', 'documentary', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Titanic', 'crew', 'members', 'who', 'worked', 'down', 'boiler', 'engine', 'rooms', 'famous', 'ship', 'film', 'told', 'memories', 'Lead', 'Fireman', 'Fredrick', 'Barret', 'Barret', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'men', 'who', 'remained', 'onboard', 'collision', 'toiling', 'away', 'boiler', 'rooms', 'ship', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'only', 'man', 'survive', 'sinking', 'who', 'had', 'actually', 'witnessed', 'impact', 'vessel', 'personally', 'saw', 'hull', 'rupture', 'giving', 'way', 'sea', 'water', 'flooding', 'ship', 'first', 'five', 'compartments', 'thereby', 'assuring', 'loss', 'film', 'story', 'retrospect', 'seated', 'presumably', 'England', 'group', 'Board', 'members', 'White', 'Star', 'Line', 'are', 'looking', 'stories', 'heroism', 'hope', 'will', 'counter', 'negative', 'news', 'stories', 'ship', 'sinking', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'today', 'film', 'traces', 'Barrets', 'actions', 'time', 'ship', 'Belfast', 'trials', 'then', 'preparations', 'start', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'docked', 'Southampton', 'finally', 'start', 'first', 'voyage', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'number', 'additional', 'crew', 'members', 'mainly', 'Engineers', 'Electricians', 'who', 'Officers', 'Titanic', 'were', 'responcible', 'overseeing', 'daily', 'mechanical', 'operations', 'new', 'ship.But', 'film', 'also', 'story', 'relation', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'like', 'people', 'living', 'time', 'kits', 'clothing', 'crew', 'members', 'brought', 'additional', 'personal', 'baggage', 'onboard', 'really', 'impacted', 'how', 'group', 'men', 'got', 'along', 'other', 'Things', 'ridged', 'class', 'structure', 'religious', 'wars', 'taking', 'place', 'particularly', 'Ireland', 'where', 'ship', 'was', 'built', 'finally', 'rank', 'structure', 'crew', 'elements', 'combined', 'directly', 'affected', 'men', 'lives', 'daily', 'routines', 'sea', 'film', 'story', 'hardest', 'working', 'section', 'ship', 'also', 'section', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'fewest', 'survivors', 'Many', 'men', 'remained', 'posts', 'trying', 'first', 'save', 'ship', 'then', 'later', 'when', 'fully', 'aware', 'was', 'longer', 'hope', 'efforts', 'then', 'became', 'simply', 'try', 'extend', 'life', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'vital', 'heroic', 'work', 'saved', 'hundreds', 'lives', 'yet', 'story', 'one', 'less', 'commonly', 'covered', 'aspects', 'much', 'written', 'disaster', 'Everything', 'production', 'truly', 'first', 'rate', 'Excellent', 'sets', 'equally', 'excellent', 'acting', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', 'subject', 'will', 'ever', 'see']",Saving the Titanic

This is a true story of the century about the human spirit, with first class acting, incredible photography, effective dialogue as well as non-verbal messages throughout. The sacrifice of the workers in the boiler room whose super-efforts delayed the sinking of the ship and thereby gave time to save more lives is brought to light. These heroes did not receive the credit they deserved. Their courage to do the extremely hard work under the most difficult conditions should have been saluted to the full extent.There is a touch of information on the workers' personal lives, dilemmas and heartbreaks, pains of separation from their families, serious conflicts based on religion, general depression caused by the boiler room job (""Do you remember the Sun?""), and unfair treatments by bosses including over-work and pay-cuts, all of which give strong clues on the social, religious, and economic history of their times.It is the true story of human decency, going way beyond the call of duty, total sacrifice, standing up for principles, bravery, and jobs well-done strictly from the sense of duty and compassion-being human at its best.",5,Human Sprit At Its Best,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,1144,"['Superb', 'true', 'story', 'century', 'human', 'spirit', 'first', 'class', 'acting', 'incredible', 'photography', 'effective', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'non-verbal', 'messages', 'sacrifice', 'workers', 'boiler', 'room', 'super-efforts', 'delayed', 'sinking', 'ship', 'thereby', 'gave', 'time', 'save', 'more', 'lives', 'brought', 'light', 'heroes', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'credit', 'deserved', 'courage', 'do', 'extremely', 'hard', 'work', 'most', 'difficult', 'conditions', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'saluted', 'full', 'extent.There', 'touch', 'information', 'workers', 'personal', 'lives', 'dilemmas', 'heartbreaks', 'pains', 'separation', 'families', 'serious', 'conflicts', 'based', 'religion', 'general', 'depression', 'caused', 'boiler', 'room', 'job', 'Do', 'remember', 'Sun', 'unfair', 'treatments', 'bosses', 'including', 'over-work', 'pay-cuts', 'give', 'strong', 'clues', 'social', 'religious', 'economic', 'history', 'times.It', 'true', 'story', 'human', 'decency', 'going', 'way', 'call', 'duty', 'total', 'sacrifice', 'standing', 'up', 'principles', 'bravery', 'jobs', 'well-done', 'strictly', 'sense', 'duty', 'compassion-being', 'human', 'best']",Saving the Titanic
