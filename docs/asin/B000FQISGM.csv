The story line moves very well as the the 3 children discover different passages and rooms in the house and in the process become more in tune with the idea of happy haunting.  You do not see a lot of real life mickey and friends as in Disneyland Fun but you will have no doubt that this is a Disney film as they are presented in nearly every sing-along on the disc.  My 2 1/2 and 4 year old enjoys this dvd and in keeping with the ""spirit"" of Halloween ask for it on a regular basis.
