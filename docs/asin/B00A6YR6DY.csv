1606126,A1ATAX8H2WITBU,B00A6YR6DY,Douglas Kaiser,"[3, 3]","As mentioned in other reviews, the title and cover of this DVD are VERY misleading. Don't expect this to be a Japanese kaiju movie or gory creature feature with a giant croc eating everyone it meets. The original title was Million Dollar Crocodile--a more apt title as the crocodile swallows a purse containing 100,000 euros, which is equivalent to 1 million in Chinese money. It's an enjoyable sort of action/comedy/family flick with a good story, interesting characters, and a nicely rendered CGI crocodile. It provides some thrills and some laughs and, despite the subject matter, maintains a lighthearted tone throughout. That being said, it probably isn't for everyone as it is Chinese dubbed into English (and not dubbed well), does have a little bit of blood, and has full-frontal nude scenes of 10-year-old boys who go skinny dipping (the nudity is not salacious in any way). It also has mild profanity (numerous uses of the s-word, but no f-bombs).",4,MILLION DOLLAR CROCODILE,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,957,"['mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'title', 'cover', 'DVD', 'are', 'VERY', 'misleading', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'Japanese', 'kaiju', 'movie', 'gory', 'creature', 'feature', 'giant', 'croc', 'eating', 'everyone', 'original', 'title', 'was', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Crocodile', 'more', 'apt', 'title', 'crocodile', 'purse', 'containing', '100,000', 'euros', 'equivalent', '1', 'million', 'Chinese', 'money', 'enjoyable', 'sort', 'action/comedy/family', 'flick', 'good', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'nicely', 'rendered', 'CGI', 'crocodile', 'thrills', 'laughs', 'subject', 'matter', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'being', 'said', 'probably', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'Chinese', 'dubbed', 'English', 'not', 'dubbed', 'well', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'blood', 'full-frontal', 'nude', 'scenes', '10-year-old', 'boys', 'who', 'go', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'nudity', 'not', 'salacious', 'way', 'also', 'mild', 'profanity', 'numerous', 'uses', 's-word', 'f-bombs']",Croczilla
1606127,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00A6YR6DY,Einsatz,"[8, 8]","What an oddly sweet and funny ""monster"" movie.  The title, of course, is very misleading.  (The original title wasn't much of an improvement, though more to the point.)Yes, this particular crocodile is bigger than normal and she did dash through a building, but she isn't Godzilla-big nor does she possess any special powers.The story involves several converging scenarios.  There's a man who buys some crocodiles allowing the owner to believe they're going to a zoo (he actually plans on serving them to customers).  The BIG croc in question is loath to become anyone's meal and escapes.  An irate young woman (I found her funny, some might not), comes across the escaped croc and loses her handbag (containing her life savings in cash) down the gaping maw.  She tries enlisting the help of the police (here her tactics prove to be quite persuasive through sheer persistence alone), and ends up with a guy who's notorious for not being able to shoot straight.  Paths criss-cross, hunters get involved once the stomach contents are well known; it's oddly endearing how these strange people end up impacting each other's lives.  I liked this movie.  But it is less about the crocodile and more about the various people in hot pursuit.  Yes, things get a little bloody from time to time and yes, there is a skinny dipping scene with a group of little boys in the same lake that the crocodile heads for.  It makes for a tense moment.It's a keeper.",4,"Not quite a ""monster"" movie",1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,1444,"['What', 'oddly', 'sweet', 'funny', 'monster', 'movie', 'title', 'course', 'very', 'misleading', 'original', 'title', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'improvement', 'though', 'more', 'point', 'Yes', 'particular', 'crocodile', 'bigger', 'normal', 'did', 'dash', 'building', ""n't"", 'Godzilla-big', 'possess', 'special', 'powers.The', 'story', 'several', 'converging', 'scenarios', 'man', 'who', 'crocodiles', 'allowing', 'owner', 'believe', ""'re"", 'going', 'zoo', 'actually', 'serving', 'customers', 'BIG', 'croc', 'question', 'loath', 'become', 'anyone', 'meal', 'escapes', 'irate', 'young', 'woman', 'found', 'funny', 'might', 'not', 'escaped', 'croc', 'handbag', 'containing', 'life', 'savings', 'cash', 'gaping', 'maw', 'enlisting', 'help', 'police', 'here', 'tactics', 'prove', 'be', 'quite', 'persuasive', 'sheer', 'persistence', 'alone', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'notorious', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'shoot', 'straight', 'Paths', 'criss-cross', 'hunters', 'get', 'involved', 'once', 'stomach', 'contents', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'oddly', 'endearing', 'how', 'strange', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'impacting', 'other', 'lives', 'liked', 'movie', 'less', 'crocodile', 'more', 'various', 'people', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'Yes', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'bloody', 'time', 'time', 'yes', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'scene', 'group', 'little', 'boys', 'same', 'lake', 'crocodile', 'heads', 'tense', 'moment.It', 'keeper']",Croczilla

It's an extremely well made, very funny Chinese creature feature that was called ""Million Dollar Crocodile"" in China, but whose title was daftly changed to ""Croczilla"" in order to appeal to the dumbing down of American filmgoers (the same people who love dreck like Michael Bay and the ""American Pie"" films).This film was a bit too long, but it had likeable characters (the main woman was annoying, yes, but I liked her spunk, and she was funny) and really good CGI (much better than in a lot of American films). There was a sense of fun permeating this film that's missing from a lot of recent creature features. The humor in it was just so odd! Definitely one of the better giant animal films to come along.
