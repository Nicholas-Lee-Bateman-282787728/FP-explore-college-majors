The film employs numerous characters, but the main roles belong to Hedge, a 60 year old wealthy estate owner with three adult children, Christian, Helene, and Michael, who have arrived for his birthday celebration.  Christian, with the most shocking news, has a twin sister who commited suicide, hence, clue number one.  Michael is a racist and fairly wacked out himself, and sister Helene brings her black boyfriend.  Nobody is sane in the family, nothing is normal.From the minute the family arrives for the party, one gets an idea of what to expect with a severely dysfunctional and crazy family.  During the elaborate dinner party with numerous guests present, Christian drops a bombshell family ugly secret where father is the perpetrator.  But all is not over with this bombshell; the party goes on, craziness continues till another bombshell lands.There isn't a dull moment in this film; it is faced paced, filled with dramatic events, startling revelations, sprinkle of violence, and partygoers everywhere.  The camera take is via hand held, depicting the reality of walking in on a wild, shameful, hysterical  and crazy night of celebration.  Caution, if you look away, you may miss something, as there is a lot going on.

466914,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,6305495777,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[5, 6]","Danish director Thomas Vinterberg brings us this stark and stunning dark comic telling of a successful son named Christian (Ulrich Thomson) who reunites with his family for his father's sixtieth birthday, only to undercut the event with harsh accusations of a tortuous truth.  The chaos that follows is both calamitous and comic, sad and somber.A lot of what makes this psychological study so successful is in Vinterberg's direction, which is mostly in accordance with the doctrines of Dogme 95 - a set of precepts for production laid down by Vinterberg and Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves) in which no tripod or dolly shots are allowed, and the film stock and lighting contribute to a shaky, naturalistic and documentary-style finished product.This style serves to enhance the substance of the already substantial script, adding filmic flesh and muscle to a strong skeletal foundation.  And though the Dogme 95 rules are generally seen as being restrictive, in this movie they only serve to set the story free; the cinematography yields a result that is both starkly real and impressionistically atmospheric, which allows moods to merge, the normal and paranormal to fuse, and truth and metaphor to co-exist.Whereas some more traditionally shot mood pieces have to bludgeon the viewer with obvious symbolic images to penetrate the narrative, here narrative and image collide to become the symbolism.  It is this clever trick that empowers the actions of the screenplay, making them much more than the sum of their parts.There are some films that make it difficult to remerge with the everyday flow of the ""real"" world, because the reality created on the screen is so strong that it doesn't allow external constructs to filter through, even long after the credits have rolled.

One of their children finally decides to out the entire story during his father's birthday celebration.

466921,A328S9RN3U5M68,6305495777,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","FESTEN (The Celebration) as a title for this dark but brilliant film from Denmark 'assembled' by Thomas Vinterberg is more than the oxymoron that applies to the story at story's conclusion.  It is a powerful, immaculately acted and performed and photographed study on the level of the great Greek dramas, but placed oh so uncomfortably in modern times.Helge Klingenfeldt-Hansen (Henning Moritzen) is the patriarch of a large family whose 60th birthday is cause for a huge celebration, a party in the wake of the latest subterranean dark secret of this ominous group - the suicide death of the eldest sister (Lene Laub Oksen - seen only as a spirit), twin of Christian (Ulrich Thomsen).  Christian returns to the party from his successful Parisian restaurant career bringing with him his history of multiple institutionalizations for 'mental illness'.  He is joined by his brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), a ne're do well owner of a sleazy grill in Copenhagen and married to Mette (Helle Dolleris) in a 'challenging' domestic life (!), and his lawyer sister Helene (Paprika Steen) who quite against family rules is living with a black man Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah).  The only calm one among this disparate group is the mother (Birthe Neumann).Problems arise before the party begins, old sibling differences and family squabbles rising out of the cracks in the glorious old castle that houses the celebration.  But the clinker comes when Helge asks Christian to offer words at the feast, a task openly welcomed as it gives Christian the opportunity to flail out the truth about the Helge that everyone seems to admire but who in fact is the nidus for the dark submerged evils that permeate the family.  In the course of the celebration all of the family problems are revealed in a manner that is as stunning as the blackest of Greek tragedies.The cast is extraordinary: every actor is gifted and performs difficult roles to perfection.  Outstanding among them are Ulrich Thomsen and Paprika Steen who give notice of great acting talents.  Much has been said about the manner in which the film was made according to Danish codes: suffice it to say the code's rules magnify the importance of this wholly successful film.  It is a must see experience.

466923,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6305495777,Gregor von Kallahann,"[13, 13]","I hadn't seen any Dogme 95 films until quite recently.  I did have a passing familiarity with the tenets of the group--which got a fair amount of press due to the emergence of Lars von Trier as a director of note--but hadn't actually gotten around to viewing any of the releases available in this country until just a few months ago.A lot of what I had read was pretty negative.  Many reviewers found that the strictures under which Dogme 95 filmmakers operate were more limiting than liberating--and that even when the script and the acting were good, those strictures (particularly the grainy cinematography and lack of edits) often undermined the films' effectiveness.Since the first Dogme film I actually saw was ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS, I found myself in tentative agreement with the critics.  That film, a comedy-drama, seemed to beg for better lighting, better sound and an overall more professional look.  I remember thinking that the film's generally washed-out look  made one actress's bright red hair look oddly artificial).  It seemed oddly jarring that what was ultimately a bright, warmhearted film was presented so starkly.But I have to admit the experience had its effect.  The next few films I watched I saw through somewhat different eyes.  I became increasingly aware of the kind of tricks filmmakers employ--particularly in terms of cinematography.  There are certain visual conventions in films, particularly in American films, that have become cliched and deserve to be challenged.It remained to be seen how effective the Dogme 95 approach might be in a more dramatic context.  The very first entry in the series Thomas Vinterberg's CELEBRATION (am I even allowed to mention the director's name?) seemed promising on that score. The film concerns the secrets and lies of a well-to-do Danish family (which include incest, denial and suicide) set against the backdrop of the 60th birthday celebration of the family patriarch (and perpetrator).We've seen this kind of set-up before, and it can go one of two ways.  It can be as emotionally shattering as the subject matter would seem to warrant--or it can ring totally false and shift to unintentional self-parody.  Thankfully, THE CELEBRATION manages to pull it off, and, yes, it's in part due to solid writing and acting, but I think the minimalist Dogme approach serves this vehicle well.  The film evokes Bergman--without the cinematography of a Sven Nykvist.  As it turns out, it actually works.  Powerfully.Bergman is, of course, Bergman, and he would likely never have never have submitted to Dogme 95-like tenets.  On the other hand, he has approached same on occasion (SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE comes to mind), and a Dogme remake of any number of his films would be at least possible.CELEBRATION is a difficult film to watch, and the lack of cinematic trickery adds to the discomfort in a very real way.

Lars von Trier started the Dogma movement in order to get back to ""real cinema"".  As much as I admire Von Trier, this was a boneheaded move, as it forces undue restrictions on filmmakers.  There were only a handful of films that were released under this moniker.  Von Trier's The Idiots (the only film of his that was approved under Dogma rules), Harmony Korine's julien donkey-boy (the most artistic of the bunch, and one that bent the Dogma rules a bit), and this film were the only 3, as far as I know.  This one is the most intense, as it is a party of a 60 year old man who is a financially successful businessman, but who also was a monster who molested his own children.  The film has sometimes been billed as a dark comedy, and there are a few moments where there is humour, but overall the film is very brooding, depressing, sad, and angry.  I think it was just portrayed as a ""comedy"" in this country because over the last decade or so everything we see has to be funny and light.  Heaven forbid we take anything seriously.I saw this in a theater.  The digitial video detracted considerably from my enjoyment.  It wasn't shot on high definition, but the cheaper digital video, and when blown up to 35mm, it looked like garbage.  But on DVD, it looks better, and you won't get so distracted from having to strain your eyes to see what's going on.  This is a very good film, powerful, disturbing, and sad.

466926,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,6305495777,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[1, 3]","Altman type films - huge cast, thrown together with a story and left to piecemeal the scenes together - are not my cup of tea.  Without really strong director in this improv-style, actors tend to make every scene filled with crisis to make their roles more ""interesting""for themselves, and their events more dramatic.  This film has a stronger script than others of this type, more shape, but still that feeling.  Too much  a rabbit warren of hystrionics.The strongest performance is that of nordicly handsome Ulrich Thomson as Christian, a man coming home to a huge family reunion/birthday party to confront his famous patriarch about childhood incest.  The family history unfolds mainly around the dinner table in ""toastmaster"" style speaches.  This is all set up well.  Thomson, having the most devasting role, gives the most understated performance, and we are drawn to his detatchment.The truthfullness of the movie is that everyone is so anxious to punish the victim for speaking out... and the history that unfolds of the treatment the victim has repeatedly received, again, for having been a victim.  It is the great kernal of the story here that makes this movie rise above its style and plot elements.A big problem is the huge cast of people who seem completely unconnected at the dinner party.  They seem to have no feelings for the situation, the individuals, and that is a script and a directoral problem.  The cast could have been cut in half, it still would have been large enough to give a sense of society, but it would have worked better.  I also felt there were casting problems throughout, the mother gives a wonderful patrician performance, but she does not look like any of the children in any way.The overall problem is that the writer seems to be young, demanding very adolescent behavior from almost every character, which gets wearing and makes everyone a bit less interesting.All that said, I agree that this is a director who will be interesting to watch, and so much of this is very skillfully done, it is akin to watching a really marvelous class project - tremendous potential, as the director was clearly setting challenges for himself even beyond the restrictions of the festival.Being a Danish film, only the art house crowd in other countries is likely to see this, and if you are one of those folks - as I am - it is interesting to watch, and well done.",4,Interesting and Altman-esque,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,2389,"['Altman', 'type', 'films', 'huge', 'cast', 'thrown', 'together', 'story', 'left', 'piecemeal', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'really', 'strong', 'director', 'improv-style', 'actors', 'tend', 'make', 'scene', 'filled', 'crisis', 'make', 'roles', 'more', 'interesting', 'events', 'more', 'dramatic', 'film', 'stronger', 'script', 'others', 'type', 'more', 'shape', 'still', 'feeling', 'Too', 'much', 'rabbit', 'warren', 'hystrionics.The', 'strongest', 'performance', 'nordicly', 'handsome', 'Ulrich', 'Thomson', 'Christian', 'man', 'coming', 'home', 'huge', 'family', 'reunion/birthday', 'party', 'confront', 'famous', 'patriarch', 'childhood', 'incest', 'family', 'history', 'unfolds', 'mainly', 'dinner', 'table', 'toastmaster', 'style', 'speaches', 'set', 'up', 'well', 'Thomson', 'having', 'most', 'devasting', 'role', 'most', 'understated', 'performance', 'are', 'drawn', 'detatchment.The', 'truthfullness', 'movie', 'everyone', 'so', 'anxious', 'punish', 'victim', 'speaking', 'out', 'history', 'unfolds', 'treatment', 'victim', 'repeatedly', 'received', 'again', 'having', 'been', 'victim', 'great', 'kernal', 'story', 'here', 'movie', 'rise', 'style', 'plot', 'elements.A', 'big', 'problem', 'huge', 'cast', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'completely', 'unconnected', 'dinner', 'party', 'seem', 'have', 'feelings', 'situation', 'individuals', 'script', 'directoral', 'problem', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'half', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'large', 'enough', 'give', 'sense', 'society', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'also', 'felt', 'were', 'casting', 'problems', 'mother', 'wonderful', 'patrician', 'performance', 'not', 'look', 'children', 'way.The', 'overall', 'problem', 'writer', 'be', 'young', 'demanding', 'very', 'adolescent', 'behavior', 'almost', 'character', 'wearing', 'everyone', 'bit', 'less', 'interesting.All', 'said', 'agree', 'director', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'skillfully', 'done', 'akin', 'watching', 'really', 'marvelous', 'class', 'project', 'tremendous', 'potential', 'director', 'was', 'clearly', 'setting', 'challenges', 'even', 'restrictions', 'festival.Being', 'Danish', 'film', 'only', 'art', 'house', 'crowd', 'other', 'countries', 'likely', 'see', 'are', 'one', 'folks', 'am', 'interesting', 'watch', 'well', 'done']",The Celebration VHS

The party is a huge celebration which Helge's grown-up children are aware of as all the relatives and closest friends of the family are about to attend the festivities.  During the initial part of the festivities some disturbing elements of the family history are revealed and it begins to dampen the party atmosphere.  However, the party continues as if nothing ever happened, but someone is determined to spoil the party with the truth.Celebration is a well-planned and remarkable film as it is shot after the guidelines of Dogme 95, which produces an authentic atmosphere as the camera is handheld and shot with no extra lightening.  The realistic atmosphere that is set in the film enhances the disturbing elements of the story, and makes it almost comfortable to watch.  The cast also does a fantastic job in creating genuine characters that the audience can relate to them as they act both respectably and appallingly according to their characters.

They are gathering to celebrate the 60th birthday of the man who fathered four children--they who have now come to pay their respects with their wives, husbands, boyfriends and girlfriends.  The man has made a tidy sum thanks to his unnamed business, and he and his wife live quite comfortably.  Also invited are the older couple's friends, and by the time everyone has arrived, there is a full house indeed, all seated at the host's large dinner table.Speeches are made, glasses are chinked together in toasts, food is eaten.  The daughter has a black American boyfriend and it's a wicked foreshadowing that has him insulted by one of his girlfriend's brothers--an out and out racist remark.This sets the stage for a shocking turn of events when one of the man's sons stands and proposes a toast to his father that leaves the guests completely stunned.

One of the trademark strengths of Dogme 95 cinema, as many of us know by now, is its focus on story alone, without reliance on any special effects--CGI, lighting, or otherwise--and Vinterberg has here wisely chosen a story so strong that to ""enhance"" it with anything remotely resembling special effects would be doing it a major disservice--would be, in fact, blatantly stupid.This is one of the best Danish films of the 20th century and should absolutely not be missed.Very highly recommended.",5,Superior example of Dogme 95 film,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,1826,"['Thomas', 'Vinterberg', 'Celebration', 'question', 'one', 'best', 'Danish', 'Dogme', 'spelled', 'way', 'Denmark', 'not', 'Dogma', '95', 'films.As', 'film', 'see', 'various', 'people', 'groups', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'converge', 'large', 'house', 'walking', 'driving', 'bicycling', 'are', 'gathering', 'celebrate', '60th', 'birthday', 'man', 'who', 'fathered', 'four', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'now', 'come', 'pay', 'respects', 'wives', 'husbands', 'boyfriends', 'girlfriends', 'man', 'made', 'tidy', 'sum', 'thanks', 'unnamed', 'business', 'wife', 'live', 'quite', 'comfortably', 'Also', 'invited', 'are', 'older', 'couple', 'friends', 'time', 'everyone', 'arrived', 'full', 'house', 'indeed', 'seated', 'host', 'large', 'dinner', 'table.Speeches', 'are', 'made', 'glasses', 'are', 'chinked', 'together', 'toasts', 'food', 'eaten', 'daughter', 'black', 'American', 'boyfriend', 'wicked', 'foreshadowing', 'insulted', 'one', 'girlfriend', 'brothers', 'out', 'racist', 'remark.This', 'stage', 'shocking', 'turn', 'events', 'when', 'one', 'man', 'sons', 'stands', 'toast', 'father', 'guests', 'completely', 'stunned', 'A', 'dark', 'secret', 'revealed', 'so', 'place', 'reason', 'celebration', 'nothing', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'same', 'following', 'younger', 'man', 'toast.The', 'drama', 'here', 'powerful', 'intense', 'seething', 'One', 'trademark', 'strengths', 'Dogme', '95', 'cinema', 'many', 'know', 'now', 'focus', 'story', 'alone', 'reliance', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'lighting', 'otherwise', 'Vinterberg', 'here', 'wisely', 'chosen', 'story', 'so', 'strong', 'enhance', 'anything', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'major', 'disservice', 'would', 'be', 'fact', 'blatantly', 'stupid.This', 'one', 'best', 'Danish', 'films', '20th', 'century', 'should', 'absolutely', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Celebration VHS

466933,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305495777,Matthew Horner,"[45, 47]","""The Celebration"" was made under the rules of Dogma 95, a pact about how a movie is to be made. It was signed by several Danish filmmakers including Thomas Vintenberger, the director of ""Celebration"". The rules include using only hand held cameras, no artificial lighting, no props except those found on location. Dogma 95 is an attempt to get away from the artificiality of Hollywood-style movie making, but, in its own way, it's artificial itself because it works only with certain kinds of movies. ""The Celebration"", though, happens to fit perfectly into its rules. The hand held camera work, for example, only adds to the tension of this powerful and devastating film.A large family gathers to celebrate the 60th birthday of its patriarch. Among the celebrants are the man's grown children, a daughter and two sons. A fourth child, a twin of one son, recently killed herself in the family's country inn where the party takes place. One son, Michael [Thomas Bo Larson], is a loud and pushy guy who drinks a lot and is less than an understanding husband and father. Helene [Paprika Steen], the daughter, is an anthropologist who has traveled the world. We find out that she has good reason to distance herself from the family. Christian [Ulrich Thomson], the twin, is a man who has been in a mental institution more than once. For a time, the children try their best to put on a cheerful front. But there is a dark family secret which is about to come out. It will destroy the family.Despairing as it may be, this is one of the most riveting films I have seen in a long time. The acting is absolutely wonderful. The script is brilliant and brutally frank. Rarely have I seen a movie with so much insightful into the enormous complexities of relationships within a family. While your family hopefully does not have secrets this shocking, you should still be able to relate to the emotions involved.This is the kind of movie you have to pay close attention to. In particular, pay attention to a small piece of paper that keeps cropping up.Highly recommended to people who like highly charged dramas and who like some substance to their movies.",5,"Brilliant, devastating potrait of a family",1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,2143,"['Celebration', 'was', 'made', 'rules', 'Dogma', '95', 'pact', 'how', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'signed', 'several', 'Danish', 'filmmakers', 'including', 'Thomas', 'Vintenberger', 'director', 'Celebration', 'rules', 'include', 'using', 'only', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'artificial', 'lighting', 'props', 'found', 'location', 'Dogma', '95', 'attempt', 'get', 'away', 'artificiality', 'Hollywood-style', 'movie', 'making', 'own', 'way', 'artificial', 'only', 'certain', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Celebration', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'rules', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'work', 'example', 'only', 'tension', 'powerful', 'devastating', 'film.A', 'large', 'family', 'gathers', 'celebrate', '60th', 'birthday', 'patriarch', 'celebrants', 'are', 'man', 'grown', 'children', 'daughter', 'two', 'sons', 'fourth', 'child', 'twin', 'one', 'son', 'recently', 'killed', 'family', 'country', 'inn', 'where', 'party', 'place', 'One', 'son', 'Michael', '[', 'Thomas', 'Bo', 'Larson', ']', 'loud', 'pushy', 'guy', 'who', 'lot', 'less', 'understanding', 'husband', 'father', 'Helene', '[', 'Paprika', 'Steen', ']', 'daughter', 'anthropologist', 'who', 'traveled', 'world', 'find', 'out', 'good', 'reason', 'distance', 'family', 'Christian', '[', 'Ulrich', 'Thomson', ']', 'twin', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'mental', 'institution', 'more', 'once', 'time', 'children', 'try', 'best', 'put', 'cheerful', 'front', 'dark', 'family', 'secret', 'come', 'out', 'will', 'destroy', 'family.Despairing', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'riveting', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'script', 'brilliant', 'brutally', 'frank', 'Rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'insightful', 'enormous', 'complexities', 'relationships', 'family', 'family', 'hopefully', 'not', 'have', 'secrets', 'shocking', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'emotions', 'involved.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'particular', 'pay', 'attention', 'small', 'piece', 'paper', 'cropping', 'up.Highly', 'recommended', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'highly', 'charged', 'dramas', 'who', 'substance', 'movies']",The Celebration VHS

Picture the scene:  all the guests and the wait staff in black tie, french-style table service, everyone at their best behavior...that is except Christian who has chosen this auspicious occasion to unmask his father as a fraud and a sexual predator.Bear in mind that this is deadly serious stuff but the director Thomas Vinterberg, has seen fit to add extraordinary touches of the Absurd: the guests naturally dumfounded  at these revelations searching for the proper manner in which to contort their faces,place their hands, avert their eyes, look for the exit door, the mother's (Birtha Neumann)frozen smile, the kitchen staff watching everything on closed-circuit TV, commenting as if they were watching an episode of ""Dallas.""""The Celebration"" is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the code of secrecy and silence that can forever stain and cripple the core of a family: don't say anything that might upset your mother or father or sister, etc, don't say anything because the neighbors might find out, don't go out of the family circle...or else.This worked very well for this family for thirty years...the father, in particular, of course. But this birthday party, this celebration of his father's ""good life and gentle nature"" provides the needed venue for Christian's catharsis: his chance to be free of the guilt and emotional weight of the past.

As you watch, it becomes physically sickening to see how many people can be in denial about something in front of them. Here, pretty much the entire family refuses to see that the father, Helge (Henning Moritzen), is a dangerous individual who raped his children, making them into highly unstable adults. The lead character Christian, played by Ulrich Thomson, blamed himself, as is normally the case, and spent time for it in institutions. Just before Helge's celebrations, his daughter, Christian's twin sister had just killed herself, which brought suppressed memories back to the forefront for him, and his other sister, Helene, leading to his decision to out his father publicly.The high class setting is suitable for showing the different reactions you would expect to see. However, these reactions would be similar pretty much in any sphere of society with different personalities stepping in to whitewash the crime in their own way. When one targets dirty crimes at a high level, many people, allies included, might arrive to make pleas to be more reasonable. There is much sanity at stake.When Christian outs his father, he is attacked by his dolt of a brother, Michael, an open racist and wife abuser. The mother is a clueless socialite who was witness to the abuse, but chooses to dismiss her son's accusation as the product of a loser's imagination. The father does the same in private, suggesting that Christian is mentally ill. Helene tries her best to keep silent. As the other guests sit around the table, they look on, enjoying the scene, without any comprehension as to the seriousness of what they're hearing.It takes awhile and an amount of repetition by Christian to get through to the disbelieving group. He reads part of the suicide note written by his twin sister. At this point Helge's wife and Helene start to break down, and he loses the support from his family which was essential to maintaining the facade of normality.The Dogma film making style is well suited to this film, given the surreal and blunt nature of the subject. It is in a way like a documentary of Christian's anguish and the handheld camera's and plain lighting cuts through the glitz of the 'celebration'. The directing by Vinterberg is brilliant, as is Ulrich Thomsen's expressions as he plots his course. This film shows a level of reality that is far beyond what North American Reality TV films are capable of.",5,Skewers every level of society,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,2537,"['Festen', 'Celebration', 'first', 'off', 'subject', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'one', 'reason', 'watch', 'physically', 'sickening', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'denial', 'something', 'front', 'Here', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'family', 'see', 'father', 'Helge', 'Henning', 'Moritzen', 'dangerous', 'individual', 'who', 'raped', 'children', 'making', 'highly', 'unstable', 'adults', 'lead', 'character', 'Christian', 'played', 'Ulrich', 'Thomson', 'blamed', 'normally', 'case', 'spent', 'time', 'institutions', 'Just', 'Helge', 'celebrations', 'daughter', 'Christian', 'twin', 'sister', 'had', 'just', 'killed', 'brought', 'suppressed', 'memories', 'back', 'forefront', 'other', 'sister', 'Helene', 'leading', 'decision', 'out', 'father', 'publicly.The', 'high', 'class', 'setting', 'suitable', 'showing', 'different', 'reactions', 'would', 'expect', 'see', 'However', 'reactions', 'would', 'be', 'similar', 'pretty', 'much', 'sphere', 'society', 'different', 'personalities', 'stepping', 'whitewash', 'crime', 'own', 'way', 'When', 'one', 'dirty', 'crimes', 'high', 'level', 'many', 'people', 'allies', 'included', 'might', 'arrive', 'make', 'pleas', 'be', 'more', 'reasonable', 'much', 'sanity', 'stake.When', 'Christian', 'father', 'attacked', 'dolt', 'brother', 'Michael', 'open', 'racist', 'wife', 'abuser', 'mother', 'clueless', 'socialite', 'who', 'was', 'witness', 'abuse', 'dismiss', 'son', 'accusation', 'product', 'loser', 'imagination', 'father', 'same', 'private', 'suggesting', 'Christian', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'Helene', 'best', 'keep', 'silent', 'other', 'guests', 'sit', 'table', 'look', 'enjoying', 'scene', 'comprehension', 'seriousness', 'what', ""'re"", 'hearing.It', 'awhile', 'amount', 'repetition', 'Christian', 'get', 'disbelieving', 'group', 'part', 'suicide', 'note', 'written', 'twin', 'sister', 'point', 'Helge', 'wife', 'Helene', 'start', 'break', 'down', 'support', 'family', 'was', 'essential', 'maintaining', 'facade', 'normality.The', 'Dogma', 'film', 'making', 'style', 'well', 'suited', 'film', 'given', 'surreal', 'blunt', 'nature', 'subject', 'way', 'documentary', 'Christian', 'anguish', 'handheld', 'camera', 'plain', 'lighting', 'cuts', 'glitz', ""'celebration"", 'directing', 'Vinterberg', 'brilliant', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'expressions', 'course', 'film', 'level', 'reality', 'far', 'what', 'North', 'American', 'Reality', 'TV', 'films', 'are', 'capable']",The Celebration VHS

""Pop Culture Addict""","[2, 4]","Thomas Vinterberg's &quot;The Celebration&quot; examines what happens when the unease typically in the air at a family gathering transforms into horror upon the revelation of a dark family secret to everyone in attendance. Yet, the most noteworthy aspect of this film is not so much its story but the manner in which that story is told. &quot;The Celebration&quot; is a fascinating venture that is equal parts a straight drama and a surreal experimental work.Helge (Henning Moritzen) is celebrating his 60th birthday at his family inn at Denmark. His three children, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), and Helene (Paprika Steen) return home for the party but their joy is tempered by a recent suicide in the family. At the birthday celebration, Christian stands before the assembled guests and exclaims that his father is not the upstanding man that many believe him to be. In fact, Christian accuses his father of horrible acts committed upon his children when they were younger. The evening further spirals out of control when Helene's boyfriend becomes the target of the family's bigotry and a servant reveals an affair she had with a family member. By the next morning, the dynamics of Helge's family have irrevocably changed.&quot;The Celebration&quot; is one of the products of the &quot;Dogma 95&quot; document in which a group of Danish directors pledged to shoot films using only hand-held cameras and the natural sounds and props found on location. These films were not to include any special effects or musical scores. This minimalist approach to filmmaking proves fascinating as it allows the true essence of the creative process to filter through in the end product. Vinterberg had nothing at his disposal to enhance or salvage his film if what he had on film proved lacking. He had to produce an involving product with only his wits and instincts to guide him on a day-to-day basis. Did he succeed? Most definitely. One viewing of &quot;The Celebration&quot; proves that Vinterberg successfully crafted a quality film in as pure and raw a form as possible. It is a testament to the unconventional and unyielding vision of a talented director.",3,&quot;Every family has a secret.&quot;,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,2177,"['Thomas', 'Vinterberg', 'quot', 'Celebration', 'quot', 'what', 'when', 'unease', 'typically', 'air', 'family', 'gathering', 'transforms', 'horror', 'revelation', 'dark', 'family', 'secret', 'everyone', 'attendance', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'manner', 'story', 'told', 'quot', 'Celebration', 'quot', 'fascinating', 'venture', 'equal', 'parts', 'straight', 'drama', 'surreal', 'experimental', 'work.Helge', 'Henning', 'Moritzen', 'celebrating', '60th', 'birthday', 'family', 'inn', 'Denmark', 'three', 'children', 'Christian', 'Ulrich', 'Thomsen', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'Bo', 'Larsen', 'Helene', 'Paprika', 'Steen', 'return', 'home', 'party', 'joy', 'tempered', 'recent', 'suicide', 'family', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'Christian', 'assembled', 'guests', 'father', 'not', 'upstanding', 'man', 'many', 'believe', 'be', 'fact', 'Christian', 'father', 'horrible', 'acts', 'committed', 'children', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'evening', 'further', 'spirals', 'control', 'when', 'Helene', 'boyfriend', 'target', 'family', 'bigotry', 'servant', 'affair', 'had', 'family', 'member', 'next', 'morning', 'dynamics', 'Helge', 'family', 'have', 'irrevocably', 'changed.', 'quot', 'Celebration', 'quot', 'one', 'products', 'quot', 'Dogma', '95', 'quot', 'document', 'group', 'Danish', 'directors', 'pledged', 'shoot', 'films', 'using', 'only', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'natural', 'sounds', 'props', 'found', 'location', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'include', 'special', 'effects', 'musical', 'scores', 'minimalist', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'proves', 'fascinating', 'true', 'essence', 'creative', 'process', 'filter', 'end', 'product', 'Vinterberg', 'had', 'nothing', 'disposal', 'enhance', 'salvage', 'film', 'what', 'had', 'film', 'proved', 'lacking', 'had', 'produce', 'involving', 'product', 'only', 'wits', 'instincts', 'guide', 'day-to-day', 'basis', 'Did', 'succeed', 'Most', 'definitely', 'One', 'viewing', 'quot', 'Celebration', 'quot', 'Vinterberg', 'successfully', 'crafted', 'quality', 'film', 'pure', 'raw', 'form', 'possible', 'testament', 'unconventional', 'unyielding', 'vision', 'talented', 'director']",The Celebration VHS

It's referred to as a satire usually, and I've heard people claim they found it incredibly hilarious, but I think any comedic angle really gets lost in the translation. I saw it as an incredibly gripping drama, and it works beautifully.The whole point of Dogma was more or less to artificially force a filmmaker into concentrating on the substance of a film rather than the flash. If you rent or buy this flik you need to forget the whole Dogma aspect- don't view this film as some sort of &quot;cult&quot; film or an artistic excercise, that goes against the point of the Dogma project. Just view it as a story and you'll be amazed at just how intense, layered, and completely realized it is. It's really a fantastic film, just an incredible script, great direction, and great acting.This film is not a great &quot;Dogma&quot; film, it's not a great &quot;cult&quot; film, and it's not a great &quot;DV&quot; (digital video) film, it's just simply a great film. It wouldn't matter if it had been shot in IMAX, it'd still be great. The fact that it was shot with a prosumer DV camera, and no professional lighting, just shows you how it's all about the substance, not who is in it or how much money was poured into it.
