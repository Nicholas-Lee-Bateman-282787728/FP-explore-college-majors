I strongly believe that there first two albums  are still the best material they have released. This DVD consists of virtually all songs from those albums as well as one or two which were released afterwards on there later albums. As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's. The set list is as good as you could hope apart from one or two that were left out. SOund is fantastic, video is fantastic and it is an overall fantastic buy and must have for any fan of great music.",5,Corrs at there best and Great quality,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,717,"['am', 'huge', 'Corrs', 'fan', 'have', 'album', 'DVD', 'have', 'ever', 'put', 'out', 'strongly', 'believe', 'first', 'two', 'albums', 'are', 'still', 'best', 'material', 'have', 'released', 'DVD', 'virtually', 'songs', 'albums', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'two', 'were', 'released', 'afterwards', 'later', 'albums', 'As', 'enjoyable', 'Corrs', 'are', 'live', 'stadium', 'arena', 'type', ""'Unplugged"", 'session', 'best', 'Corrs', 'DVD', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'talents', 'also', 'best', 'sound', 'DVD', 'set', 'list', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'hope', 'apart', 'one', 'two', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'SOund', 'fantastic', 'video', 'fantastic', 'overall', 'fantastic', 'buy', 'must', 'have', 'fan', 'great', 'music']",N/A
549183,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B00004RJEG,Irishgal,"[2, 2]","1999 may have been the year of the Corrs. The group finished a whirlwind world tour, culminating in their famed Lansdowne Road concert in Dublin, sold millions of albums, and became one of the only acts ever to sing in an ""MTV Unplugged"" session that was taped for - and aired for - European fans only. However, with the long-awaited US release of the DVD, Americans can enjoy the concert for the first time.Backed by the Irish Film Orchestra and featuring their two road band members, Anto Drennan and Keith Duffy, the Corrs put forth a beautiful show full of their classic hits - 'Only When I Sleep', 'Runaway', 'Dreams', as well as two previously unreleased songs (that would later appear on the ""In Blue"" album), 'Radio' and 'At Your Side', as well as covers of favorite hits, such as 'No Frontiers' and 'Old Town'. With most of the tunes performed acoustically, the show was organic, raw, and touching.Why only four stars, then? While the DVD quality is extremely high, with a clear picture and great sound, this disc has absolutely no extras, which is a bit of a letdown. After waiting five years for Region 1 release, I had been hoping for something extra - but it was not meant to be. The show is, however, exquisite, thus the high rating.Looking for a beautiful acoustic show featuring great music, great songs, and an enjoyable ninety minutes?

Unplugged/acoustic music DVD's are always a measure of how much is real talent and musical proficiency. Especially with singing, there's no hiding a lack lustre performance behind sound effects and noisy crowds. Andrea's singing is spot on and the viewers are small in numbers so as she puts it, it is ""intimate"" giving it a different atmosphere to a concert of thousands.I think their set list worked well to, also giving Andrea a break by having the other two sisters perform a duo.I'd really like them to do another unplugged/acoustic set with some of their material as its been a few years now since this DVD was recorded.The Corrs are real musicians and artists. No need for lip syncing here.

549185,AZTVHB938DIG5,B00004RJEG,"K. S. Pang ""AlanP""","[1, 1]","For the melodies that they have in their songs (including cover songs), it's ideal for acoustic performances. Their family instruments are bohan, tin whistle, piano, guitar and violin. You can see them perform with those instruemtns. Violin sounded really good. So as the Guild guitars you hear in a few songs. The entire show was backed by a full orchestra. The instrumental songs can make you jump up and dance even it's an acoustic setting. Just so that you know, they played the best version of 'Radio' @ Unplugged.I just wish that there's another unplugged or acoustic concert dvd in the future. If you haven't look into their album 'Home', go and check it out. You'll be impressed by how far they can go with the genre of music they play. All the irish songs were absolutely beautifully polished if you like acoustic side of the Corrs.This unplugged dvd was recorded professionally. You can see how well they edited. You can feel the chorus is chorus, not just by listening but also seeing. Like Yanni said, the impressions on a performer is just as important as playing. It's an emotional feeling that they want to express when they playing each note or beat. It's all captured in this DVD!The quality of it is alright as it's recorded and produced a while ago. Don't expect it to be HD or anything. It's always the first dvd that i want to pick up when I decided watch the Corrs in a concert.",5,The Corrs were born for acoustic :),1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1400,"['melodies', 'have', 'songs', 'including', 'cover', 'songs', 'ideal', 'acoustic', 'performances', 'family', 'instruments', 'are', 'bohan', 'tin', 'whistle', 'piano', 'guitar', 'violin', 'can', 'see', 'perform', 'instruemtns', 'Violin', 'sounded', 'really', 'good', 'So', 'Guild', 'guitars', 'hear', 'few', 'songs', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'backed', 'full', 'orchestra', 'instrumental', 'songs', 'can', 'make', 'jump', 'up', 'dance', 'even', 'acoustic', 'setting', 'Just', 'know', 'played', 'best', 'version', ""'Radio"", '@', 'Unplugged.I', 'just', 'wish', 'unplugged', 'acoustic', 'concert', 'dvd', 'future', 'have', ""n't"", 'look', 'album', ""'Home"", 'go', 'check', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'impressed', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'genre', 'music', 'play', 'irish', 'songs', 'were', 'absolutely', 'beautifully', 'polished', 'like', 'acoustic', 'side', 'Corrs.This', 'unplugged', 'dvd', 'was', 'recorded', 'professionally', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'edited', 'can', 'feel', 'chorus', 'chorus', 'not', 'just', 'listening', 'also', 'seeing', 'Yanni', 'said', 'impressions', 'performer', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'playing', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'want', 'express', 'when', 'playing', 'note', 'beat', 'captured', 'DVD', 'quality', 'alright', 'recorded', 'produced', 'while', 'ago', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'HD', 'anything', 'always', 'first', 'dvd', 'i', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'when', 'decided', 'watch', 'Corrs', 'concert']",N/A
549186,A1J6788AD55AW5,B00004RJEG,Louie Bourland,"[16, 17]","It has taken awhile for The Corrs astonishing ""Unplugged"" performance to make it onto DVD in NTSC format but finally, the wait is over!!Captured live in October 1999 before a studio audience in Ireland's Ardmore Studios, The Corrs deliver an outstanding up-close-and-personal performance in a small intimate setting. In addition to what was then their current hits, The Corrs also debut two songs from their album ""In Blue"" (""Radio"" and ""At Your Side"") which are arguably superior than what would wind up on that studio album one year later.Additionally, the band throws in some stellar renditions of traditional Irish tunes which show off the full scope of their musicianship as well as cover versions of their favorite songs - R.E.M.'s ""Everybody Hurts"", Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"", Jimi Hendrix's ""Little Wing"" and Thin Lizzy's ""Old Town"" - which are played in a way that only The Corrs can play them.A genuine highlight of the entire performance would have to be the cover version of Jimmy McCarthy's ""No Frontiers"" in which Andrea Corr leaves the stage giving the vocal spotlight over to sisters Sharon and Caroline who give a stirring heartfelt performance here.Definitely, this DVD was well worth the wait. This is arguably The Corrs best performance on video. Andrea's voice is strong and powerful throughout, Sharon's violin and vocal harmonies are flawless while Caroline and Jim show off amazing versitility by switching between different instruments during the show (Caroline plays drums, bodhran, percussion and piano, Jim switches between many guitars as well as piano). The band's strong back up from Anthony Drennan, Keith Duffy, Mitchell Froom and the Irish Symphonic Film Orchestra give the performance an even bigger boost.Despite having a rather expensive price-tag, ""The Corrs Unplugged"" is worth every dollar and penny. It's a great companion to the CD and shows The Corrs at their very very best.A Must Have For All Corrs Fans!!",5,The Corrs Unplugged in NTSC At Last!!!!,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,1949,"['taken', 'awhile', 'Corrs', 'astonishing', 'Unplugged', 'performance', 'make', 'DVD', 'NTSC', 'format', 'finally', 'wait', 'Captured', 'live', 'October', '1999', 'studio', 'audience', 'Ireland', 'Ardmore', 'Studios', 'Corrs', 'deliver', 'outstanding', 'up-close-and-personal', 'performance', 'small', 'intimate', 'setting', 'addition', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'current', 'hits', 'Corrs', 'also', 'debut', 'two', 'songs', 'album', 'Blue', 'Radio', 'Your', 'Side', 'are', 'arguably', 'superior', 'what', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'studio', 'album', 'one', 'year', 'later.Additionally', 'band', 'stellar', 'renditions', 'traditional', 'Irish', 'tunes', 'show', 'full', 'scope', 'musicianship', 'as', 'well', 'cover', 'versions', 'favorite', 'songs', 'R.E.M', 'Everybody', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Dreams', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Little', 'Wing', 'Thin', 'Lizzy', 'Old', 'Town', 'are', 'played', 'way', 'only', 'Corrs', 'can', 'play', 'them.A', 'genuine', 'highlight', 'entire', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'cover', 'version', 'Jimmy', 'McCarthy', 'No', 'Frontiers', 'Andrea', 'Corr', 'stage', 'giving', 'vocal', 'spotlight', 'sisters', 'Sharon', 'Caroline', 'who', 'give', 'stirring', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'here.Definitely', 'DVD', 'was', 'well', 'wait', 'arguably', 'Corrs', 'best', 'performance', 'video', 'Andrea', 'voice', 'strong', 'powerful', 'Sharon', 'violin', 'vocal', 'harmonies', 'are', 'flawless', 'Caroline', 'Jim', 'show', 'off', 'amazing', 'versitility', 'switching', 'different', 'instruments', 'show', 'Caroline', 'drums', 'bodhran', 'percussion', 'piano', 'Jim', 'many', 'guitars', 'as', 'well', 'piano', 'band', 'strong', 'back', 'Anthony', 'Drennan', 'Keith', 'Duffy', 'Mitchell', 'Froom', 'Irish', 'Symphonic', 'Film', 'Orchestra', 'give', 'performance', 'even', 'bigger', 'boost.Despite', 'having', 'rather', 'expensive', 'price-tag', 'Corrs', 'Unplugged', 'worth', 'dollar', 'penny', 'great', 'companion', 'CD', 'Corrs', 'very', 'very', 'best.A', 'Must', 'Have', 'All', 'Corrs', 'Fans']",N/A
