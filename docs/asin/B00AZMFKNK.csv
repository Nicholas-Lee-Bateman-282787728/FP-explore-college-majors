Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The cinematography is grand and sweeping, with vibrant colors, deep blues, and rich greens. The period detail is rich and polished, though the language switch between English and Swedish may be slightly jarring  for some. At it&#8217;s heart, Kon-Tiki is an adventure story &#8211; one without much special effects, one with a human story at heart, filmed on the open sea, with a few amazing set pieces, great acting, and a star turn from Pl Sverre Hagen (6&#8217;5 of pure Norway!) as Thor Heyerdahl.While it may be slightly formulaic, and more than a little predictable, Kon-Tiki is a rousing, blood-pumping, visually stunning adventure film, crafted with style. What more can be said? If you're looking for more easy-to-watch, but smart foreign films, rather than arthouse drama...grab a copy of Kon-Tiki as soon as you can!

It starts off well with Thor Heyerdahl and his wife on the Polynesian islands before World War Two, increasingly curious about how they were initially colonised. His wife falls sick and when they hear the sound of the steamer coming in, Heyerdahl grabs his wife and runs through the rain, not caring that her biological work is ruined. Sub-text: he is a selfish man. After the war he breaks a promise to return to Norway from New York (remember: he's selfish) and instead grabs a crew in haphazard fashion and ends up in Peru with a bunch of balsa wood logs he has to lash together. This is where the problems in the script start: we know the raft made it, so there's no suspense there. We therefore need a great group dynamic and we don't get it. There are seven men on board and they all have flimsy back stories and they all look alike. So when tensions rise it's hard to figure out who is upset with whom, especially as the beards grow longer, and even harder to raise much enthusiasm. There should be a couple of great back stories and psychological traumas and we suffer from their absence. The tale drags and drags and it's a relief when they finally make shore.

Lovingly constructed and beautifully filmed with a sharp eye for the grandiose, it's eye candy on the same level as Planet Earth, if to a slightly more reasonable scale. The plot is a gentle balance between nature-watching and temper-managing, as the crew of six men and a parrot get to know a bit too much about one another over the course of their hundred-day adventure. Several of the journey's more dramatic moments feel manufactured (and, upon review, actually are) but I'd hardly call that unexpected and it may have been necessary to give the story a bit of punch.

1619064,A3ML55ELQGBY0S,B00AZMFKNK,Gregory,"[1, 2]","I recently saw this movie at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art. The start of the movie was delayed in lieu of the HUGE crowd of people waiting in line to buy a ticket in the hot sun. They had three showings, and when I went on Sunday it was the last showing. When the movie started there were only a handful of empty seats, which is very rare for the OMOA. I have seen many docudrama's on TV about events at the turn of the 19th century. The entire set, cars, planes, and clothing date back to that age. That also applies to this movie. One thing I loved about this movie is they also told the story leading up to the launch of Kon Tiki. The film made it very clear that the entire crew knew this was a very dangerous voyage. Yet knowing that everyone of the crew had no doubt about going on the voyage. That is the entire scientific community predicted it was a suicide mission. Everyone on the Kon Tiki was assigned to a task, navigator, radio operator, engineer, photographer, etc. The real story is about mother earth and what she had in store for the crew of  the Kon Tiki. There was not one dull moment in this movie. The epic fights among the crew. The scenes of joy, laughter, and extreme danger. The main theme is about several guys that had nothing in common, and as the voyage progresses they banded together as mates.IMDB advised that there are four scenes that did not actually take place on the 1947 voyage, and that the movie is not historically accurate. They say this was done to beef up to movie, and make it more melodramatic. I will have to agree with Hollywood this time. Those four scenes did not change the outcome of the voyage in anyway, and only made it more entertaining.Another note is that this docudrama was so....good when it played at the Oklahoma Museum of Art that at the end of the movie everyone in the theatre stood up and applauded.

1619066,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B00AZMFKNK,Howard Schumann,"[4, 11]","The Andean story of how the world was created by a tall white, blue eyed man with long blond-reddish hair and beard who arose from Lake Titicaca in Bolivia has been passed down by word of mouth through generations of South American Indians. Known to the Aymaras as Viracocha (he was also called Kon-Tiki), Quetzalcoatl (by Aztecs), and Kukulkan (by Mayans), the story is similar to Biblical accounts of the creation of a race of giants who ruled the Earth but who displeased God and were destroyed by a flood. Unlike the God of Israel, however, Viracocha is said to have disappeared across the Pacific Ocean by walking on the water.Norwegian Zoologist and explorer Thor Heyerdahl believed that Viracocha, rather than walking on the water, left Peru on a raft and floated with the current to Polynesia, a feat he wished to duplicate. (He did not consider the possibility of Viracocha's connection with the very ancient, advanced technological cultures of Tiahuanaco, Puma Punka, and Chavin de Huantar). Heyerdahl's accounts of how he and five other men built a balsa-wood raft which he named ""Kon-Tiki"" and sailed to the Tuamotu Archipelago in the South Seas is dramatized in Norwegian directors, Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg's Kon-Tiki, one of five nominated films in the Best Foreign Language Film category at this years' Oscars.The film was shot in two versions, one in Norwegian and the other in English (the one I saw), presumably to appeal to a broader audience. Engagingly portrayed by Pal Sverre Hagen, Heyerdahl is first seen living with his wife Liv (Agnes Kittelsen) on the Polynesian island of Fatu Huku, where he resided for a year. After listening to native accounts, Heyerdahl began to develop the idea that Polynesians originally arrived from the Americas, not from Asia. Opting for adventure rather than character development, the film shows the courage (some call it being foolhardy, or even a death-wish) of the crew that consisted of three fellow Norwegians, as well as Swedish cameraman (Gustaf Skarsgard) and refrigerator salesman Herman Watzinger (Anders Baasmo Christiansen) as his engineer as they traveled 4,300 nautical miles across the Paciifc, isolated and alone for 101 days.The film pays little attention to the day-to-day routine aboard the raft but concentrates on the thrill of the struggle against sharks, the fierce storms, conflict among the crew (contrary to Heyerdahl's own account), and the immediate danger of their raft collapsing. The photography, done without CGI effects such as in Life of Pi, is striking and beautiful, yet Kon-Tiki is mostly a formulaic adventure story that mimics the superficial triumphalism of Hollywood without capturing the deeper spirit of the journey. Heyerdahl's character is hardly explored and, while his subsequent travel to Easter Island is noted, there is no mention of his later advocacy of environmental issues and world peace.While most scientists still oppose Heyerdahl's ideas and can show strong DNA evidence linking Polynesians to Asians, there are also anomalies that point in a different direction. For example, researcher David Pratt tells us that there are various genetic and cultural similarities between the Polynesians and the Tlingit, Kwakuitl and Haida Indians of Alaska and Canada - something not readily explained by any mainstream theories. In addition, there is the famous Kon-Tiki statue in the sunken Gardens in Tiahuanaco showing a man with a thick beard and mustache (South American Indians are beardless and do not shave).One of the features of this and other statues in the area is the positioning of the hands, one over the heart and the other over the stomach, the same feature seen on Polynesian statues and gold medallions. Whatever the truth, there is no doubt that Thor Heyerdahl, through his willingness to take risks, brought the topic of seafaring, communication, and migration in the ancient world to people's attention, and deserves the appreciation he receives in the film.

Though the film outlines the major aspects of the adventure, there's so much missing that it seems like a pallid imitation of the real adventure. You don't really get to know any of the characters in detail other than Thor, and you also don't get an accurate picture of what it was like to build the raft and spend 101 days drifting slowly across the Pacific. The book also continues with what happened after they landed in Polynesia, and that's almost entirely omitted from the film.

I have not examined what was cut but I did try the dub in parts and the mix of accents sent me quickly back to the Norwegian, (which has a lot of English in it too). The DVD is not a full copy, it only contains the shorter English dub not the full length Norwegian version.The film however is an astonishing achievement and follows the book surprisingly closely. The whale shark and shark incidents are over-cooked for dramatic effect as compared to the book and the throwing out of the wire never happened as far as I could see. The unfortunate parrot was not eaten by a shark but just swamped by a wave. Despite this making such a film in the open ocean was no easy task and despite the large amount of CGI it comes over very well. The acting is good and the picture and sound excellent. All in all this is a fascinating relook at a subject that is still unresolved. Heyerdahl makes numerous points that cannot be brushed away. Perhaps we will never know the truth but this astonishing, almost foolhardy voyage should  certainly light the fire of adventure in us all. I met Heyerdahl years later on Easter Island and he presents his theories with tremendous conviction.

Oleson,"[4, 5]","After Norwegian adventurer/scientist Thor Heyerdahl spent years in Polynesia, he became convinced that the islands were originally founded and inhabited by people from South America, specifically Peru.  This was contrary to the belief at the time that settlers came from Asia.In 1947, Heyerdahl and his 5 man crew set out to prove that the 5000 mile trip could be made on a raft supported by balsa wood.  He was successful, wrote a book and made an Oscar winning documentary (in 1950) about the trip.  This dramatic film uses both mediums and some interviews with Heyerdahl's son to recreate the adventure.  This film co-directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg and produced by Aage Aaberge had financial support from over 20 entities and became the largest budgeted film to ever come from Norway.  It was rightly nominated for Best Foreign Language Film based on the longer 119 minute Norwegian language version.Harvey Weinstein agreed to release the film in the U. S. but only with an English language version with a shorter running time.  So the filmmakers shot two versions of the film at the same time.  The actors spoke both Norwegian and English, so they would shoot scenes twice.  Both versions are available on this disc and both include subtitles in English, Spanish and English SDH using unique display methodology.I only watched the longer Norwegian version and while it is primarily in Norwegian, there are also extended scenes in English when Heyerdahl is in New York trying to get financing and in Peru as he communicates in the only common language.  I don't know what was excised in the English language version.  Even if I watched it, it would likely have to be done side-by-side to catch the differences.  I didn't have the time, equipment or resources to do it.  Evidently nobody else did either.  I spent some time surfing the web to see if anyone had ascertained what 23 minutes got cut, but could find no one who had gone to the trouble either.With a film as beautiful as this one, there is no reason not to watch the original Norwegian version.  The filmmakers used a combination of ""at sea"" shooting and digital CGI.  The CGI scenes range from just OK (shots of the NYC skyline) to remarkable (the whale shark...and other sharks).  The Blu ray comes in the original 2.39:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  It is stunning.  Colors are vibrant.  Contrast and clarity are exemplary.  This similarly themed film compares favorably to the visuals of ""The Life of Pi.""The Norwegian language version comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is as good as it comes.  There is one scene I remember when the raft is being turned around as sea and the sound circles the room as the raft moves.  Very effective.  As good as it is, boy this would have been even better in 7.1.  If you watch the English language version you will get a lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track.  Extras include a 26 minute featurette called Kon-Tiki: The Incredible True Story and a 10 minute music only featurette called Visual Effects showing some of the photography tricks used in filming.I haven't said much about the story.  Pal Sverre Hagen stars as Heyerdahl and does a remarkable job.  He even looks like Thor.  Even with a wife and children at home in Norway, Heyerdahl is focused on the man vs. nature element as well as proving that his theory is correct.  The only other performances of consequence are the 5 shipmates and they are credible in their performances.  The direction, photography and editing are likewise superb.  The film has enough tension and suspense to keep audiences awake.  There are sharks of course.  There is the raft coming apart.  There is bickering at sea in the 101 day trip.  There are violent storms.  And did I mention...sharks!  This is a well-made, near perfect adventure.

Next we find Thor and his girlfrien/eventual wife Liv spending time in Polynesia in the late 1930s, and it is there that Thord gets the idea that Polynesia was settled by ""travelers from the east"" (which would be South America). Thor spends the next 10 years trying to prove this theory, until he is dared by a publisher to provide the ultimate proof: replicate the 5000 mile journey from Peru to Polynesia on a raft, the same way it was done 1500 years earlier. About half an hour into the movie, the journey begins, and what an epic journey it turns out to be. To tell you more would ruing your viewing pleasure.Several comments: first and foremost, what is a great movie turns out to be a butchered version of the original (and Oscar-nominated) Norwegian version that was released last year to great acclaim (it is the highest grossing movie of all time in Norway). Indeed, all source materials (including info listed by the art-house theatre but also for example here on Amazon and on IMDb) list this as lasting 118 min. but what I saw today was barely over an hour and a half. After the movie was over, I asked to speak to the manager as I thought maybe something went wrong, but instead I was told that indeed the US version is a shortened version. The fact that some corporate suit at The Weinstein Company, the US distributor, decided the movie needed to be ""dumbed down' for US audiences just sickens me, and it has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I wouldn't be surprised if for the DVD release they'll include the ""extended"" (meaning, the original) version to entice you to spend yet more money.The fact that we see a drastically shorter version of the original movie has tainted my overall judgment of ""Kon-Tiki"", which has all the makings of an excellent ""old school""-style adventure movie, with gorgeous photography and engaging performances. At this point you may wish to wait for the DVD release, rather than seeing it in the theatre, even though by all means a movie like this just begs to be seen on the big screen.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[21, 25]","I know there are already a number of reviews of the FILM posted, and I'll refer you to those for the story line and acting. I'll use this space to discuss the DVD and BD versions.  This is another instance of the Weinstein Company and Anchor Bay going the extra distance to put a lot into the home video release of a film that only received limited theatrical release.As you will learn from my fellow Amazon reviewer Paul Allaer, the US theatrical version was edited down from 119 minutes to 96 minutes. It was the longer version - in Norwegian with English Subtitles - that was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Foreign Feature Film. What you get on both the DVD and the BD version are BOTH that original as well as the English language version - which will  give the film greater exposure. Whichever version you choose, it is the visual images that will grab you the most. The BD version looked great on my new flat screen TV. There were a few sound issues however with the volume dropping off in a few places. I'm not sure it this was in the transfer or not. (This was in the English version.). The special effects (mostly CGI created) are quite heavy, but very realistic. (One of the two ""bonus features"" is a nine-minute ""Visual Effects Featurette"" which shows the images before and after the CGI effects, with no narration; just a musical soundtrack.)The other bonus is a 25 minute ""program"" on the expedition that Thor Heyerdahl made in 1947 and subsequent book and film versions. It appears to have been made for a television show.Having recently returned from a vacation in Norway, I was  anxious to see this film (which seemed to have passed through Philadelphia quickly on its theatrical run.). I found it both historically interesting and well-acted, especially when there were no identifiable ""stars"" to distract me from the story.UPDATE 8/28/13: I just checked my combo pack and noted that the DVD included has only the English language version. The BD in the combo has both. I do not know if the stand alone DVD set has the Norwegian version but I doubt it, because a single DVD can not hold that much info.FURTHER UPDATE - 8/29/13 - A commenter (see comments) confirmed that the DVD version is also a TWO_disc set and does contain both Emnglish and Norwegian version.
