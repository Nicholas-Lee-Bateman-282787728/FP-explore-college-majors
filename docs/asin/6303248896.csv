He was perfect for the role as he still looked quite good physically. Taylor plays his part well and is a standout in a good cast. This is a good print with a good soundtrack. The scenery is typical of the westerns of the time.

365662,A339QW2JJNUBGC,6303248896,Judith E. Hanhisalo,"[2, 2]","""Return of the Gunfighter"" was not Robert Taylor's last film.  He did a couple of B productions in Europe, working into 1968.  In October of 1968 he had a lung removed and did not work again.  Nonetheless, ""Gunfighter"" is a suitable farewell.  Taylor plays a reformed gunfighter, recently released from prison after serving 5 years for a bogus murder conviction.  The character, Ben Wyatt, seeks only to live in peace but events make this impossible. When a friend and his wife are murdered, Wyatt must see that justice prevails.The meat of the story is the relationship between Wyatt and young gunslinger Lee Sutton, played by Chad Everett.  A secondary motif is Wyatt's love for his ""niece,"" Anisa, played by Ana Martin.  It isn't a love triangle at all but a passing of the flame to the younger generation.  Everett, a happy-go-lucky young man, learns to be a responsible adult by confronting the villain, Clay Sutton (Lyle Bettger), his older brother.  Under Wyatt's influence, he faces evil and wins the young girl's love.Everett is charming and handsome as Lee Sutton.  His self-centered playfulness is gradually replaced by a sense of morality and accountability.  Ana Martin's acceptance of him as a suitor comes only as he matures.  Martin had a better role than women usually do in westerns and handles it satisfactorily although not memorably. The supporting cast is uniformly professional and effective.The picture, however, belongs to Taylor.  He is still handsome and his lined face conveys emotion with quiet authority.  As others have said, no one rode a horse the way he did--his straight yet graceful posture, his easy control, his oneness with the animal.  The pretty boy of the thirties has become a superb actor without ever being showy or ""going Hollywood."" It is disturbing, however, to watch his labored breathing, knowing what caused it.  The last scene, where he walks away from the camera, alone in the street, is very moving.",4,Robert Taylor Exits Gracefully,1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,1953,"['Return', 'Gunfighter', 'was', 'not', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'last', 'film', 'did', 'couple', 'B', 'productions', 'Europe', 'working', '1968', 'October', '1968', 'had', 'lung', 'removed', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'again', 'Nonetheless', 'Gunfighter', 'suitable', 'farewell', 'Taylor', 'reformed', 'gunfighter', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', '5', 'years', 'bogus', 'murder', 'conviction', 'character', 'Ben', 'Wyatt', 'only', 'live', 'peace', 'events', 'make', 'impossible', 'When', 'friend', 'wife', 'are', 'murdered', 'Wyatt', 'must', 'see', 'justice', 'prevails.The', 'meat', 'story', 'relationship', 'Wyatt', 'young', 'gunslinger', 'Lee', 'Sutton', 'played', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'secondary', 'motif', 'Wyatt', 'love', 'niece', 'Anisa', 'played', 'Ana', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'love', 'triangle', 'passing', 'flame', 'younger', 'generation', 'Everett', 'happy-go-lucky', 'young', 'man', 'be', 'responsible', 'adult', 'confronting', 'villain', 'Clay', 'Sutton', 'Lyle', 'Bettger', 'older', 'brother', 'Wyatt', 'influence', 'evil', 'young', 'girl', 'love.Everett', 'charming', 'handsome', 'Lee', 'Sutton', 'self-centered', 'playfulness', 'gradually', 'replaced', 'sense', 'morality', 'accountability', 'Ana', 'Martin', 'acceptance', 'suitor', 'only', 'Martin', 'had', 'better', 'role', 'women', 'usually', 'do', 'westerns', 'satisfactorily', 'not', 'memorably', 'supporting', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'professional', 'effective.The', 'picture', 'however', 'Taylor', 'still', 'handsome', 'lined', 'face', 'conveys', 'emotion', 'quiet', 'authority', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'horse', 'way', 'did', 'straight', 'yet', 'graceful', 'posture', 'easy', 'control', 'oneness', 'animal', 'pretty', 'boy', 'thirties', 'become', 'superb', 'actor', 'ever', 'being', 'showy', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'disturbing', 'however', 'watch', 'labored', 'breathing', 'knowing', 'what', 'caused', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'away', 'camera', 'alone', 'street', 'very', 'moving']",N/A

The movie filmed in Metrocolor was released 29 January 1967 and still gets 6 out of 10 stars for a western. See IMDb for additional information.An aging gunfighter fresh out of Yuma Prison meets up with a young girl he has known since her youth, with her parents recently murdered he will help her look for the killers.  Simple, straightforward plot with typical western story, add a love story, with the good guys coming out on top and you have the plot.The acting is excellent with many aging stars of the l950s showing up in various roles, doing a mighty fine job at that.  I read westerns and enjoy western movies so I may not be the best judge of quality here, but the movie is colorful and interesting.  I would recommend it to any viewer who enjoys a good western, not great mind you, but solid and good.I had never viewed the movie prior to its showing on Encore Westerns this month, January, 2010, but will no doubt watch it again.
