There were a few utterances of mild crude language and drinking in a few scenes.  I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again. There were several parts that I thought could have been better, but it was entertaining.The only thing I didn't like was how Jesse attempts to sabotage a real estate sale.  She hasn't been home in years (because she couldn't deal with the grief of her husbands death), but this Christmas she comes home and plans on surprising her parents with the news that she is going to buy their house that they have been trying to sell for months.  Only to find out that they just barely reached an agreement with a buyer, Michael, but it is contingent on him selling his house.  She is furious and can't understand how her parents could sell &#34;her house&#34;. That night, a stranger follows his dog to the house.  She is kind and polite...until she finds out he is the buyer.  All of a sudden she turns on him and treats him as the enemy.  Her obsession to buy the house leads her to stand in the way of would-be-buyers of Michael's home and he eventually finds out.  Just as you are really starting to dislike her, she how horrible she has been and how much she hurt him and surrenders her parents home and secretly buys his.Despite her behavior and since she learned from it and tried to make up for it, I would watch this movie again.

Not so.Andrea Roth plays Jessica, a single mom, widowed for three years. During those three years she has avoided family gatherings. She had always been such a ""together"" person throughout her life and after her husband died she felt like she was a mess. She didn't want her family to see her that way. Now her parents are trying to sell their home and move to Florida, where all their friends have gone. She has decided to take her young son and go home for Christmas to surprise her parents with an offer to buy their home. She has a stronger than usual attachment to the place.  When her father (played so well by Bruce Davison) first bought the land on which he built the home, the family had spent most of the summer camping there. She was only nine and had connected with a boy her age whose family was also camping in the vicinity. They had been inseparable, along with a golden retriever that seemed to attach itself to them, and as she remembers that time through flashbacks, she tells her young son that it had been the perfect summer. As the summer had come to a close she and her friend had gathered small things that reminded them of their time together and buried them as a time capsule in a metal lunch box--and they had made some special promises to each other. The boy had carved their names in a tree near the burial site--only problem was that they had never used their real names throughout the summer, choosing instead the names of characters from the movie Star Wars. Now she has no idea who that boy might be, though her son is sure she will meet him somewhere.Back with the family she discovers that her parents have a surprise for her--they have finally sold their home. She is not happy with the situation and goes about trying to change it--estranging herself from the man who has bought the home, and making the real estate agent, an old high school friend, wonder what has happened to her. Jessica finally realizes that she has been behaving very selfishly and sets about to make reparations. It is fun to see how things finally unfold, though the outcome is no surprise.It isn't perfect--what movie is? Both of the main leads were good, but I would have liked a little more believable chemistry between them. Though mostly family friendly, some might want to know that there was one incident of profanity and one of swearing. Also, when Jessica first tells her sister about the friend she used to meet in the woods, before she has mentioned their ages at the time, her sister blurts out, ""You guys did it in the woods?"" And finally, I winced a little when Jessica's mom mentions ""getting our butts to Florida."" Not the kind of thing we say in our home, though I know it is mild by today's standards.One of the things I liked about this movie was that I felt like the actors were talking the way people really talk to each other these days, and not just reading memorized lines. There were some clever exchanges--especially between Jessica and her sister Anna, played by Elisa Donovan. And if you are concerned about good role models for your kids, other than a little normal disappointment about not getting a dog for Christmas, the children in this movie are well-behaved.",4,Misleading cover photo--good movie,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,3311,"['been', 'mentioned', 'cover', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'kids', 'movie', 'bunch', 'dogs', 'Not', 'so.Andrea', 'Roth', 'Jessica', 'single', 'mom', 'widowed', 'three', 'years', 'three', 'years', 'avoided', 'family', 'gatherings', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'together', 'person', 'life', 'husband', 'died', 'felt', 'was', 'mess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'family', 'see', 'way', 'Now', 'parents', 'are', 'trying', 'sell', 'home', 'move', 'Florida', 'where', 'friends', 'have', 'gone', 'decided', 'take', 'young', 'son', 'go', 'home', 'Christmas', 'surprise', 'parents', 'offer', 'buy', 'home', 'stronger', 'usual', 'attachment', 'place', 'When', 'father', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'first', 'bought', 'land', 'built', 'home', 'family', 'had', 'spent', 'most', 'summer', 'camping', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'nine', 'had', 'connected', 'boy', 'age', 'family', 'was', 'also', 'camping', 'vicinity', 'had', 'been', 'inseparable', 'golden', 'retriever', 'seemed', 'attach', 'time', 'flashbacks', 'young', 'son', 'had', 'been', 'perfect', 'summer', 'summer', 'had', 'come', 'close', 'friend', 'had', 'gathered', 'small', 'things', 'reminded', 'time', 'together', 'buried', 'time', 'capsule', 'metal', 'lunch', 'box', 'had', 'made', 'special', 'promises', 'other', 'boy', 'had', 'carved', 'names', 'tree', 'burial', 'site', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'had', 'never', 'used', 'real', 'names', 'summer', 'choosing', 'instead', 'names', 'characters', 'movie', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Now', 'idea', 'who', 'boy', 'might', 'be', 'son', 'sure', 'will', 'meet', 'somewhere.Back', 'family', 'parents', 'have', 'surprise', 'have', 'finally', 'sold', 'home', 'not', 'happy', 'situation', 'about', 'trying', 'change', 'estranging', 'man', 'who', 'bought', 'home', 'making', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Jessica', 'finally', 'been', 'behaving', 'very', 'selfishly', 'sets', 'make', 'reparations', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'finally', 'unfold', 'outcome', 'surprise.It', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'what', 'movie', 'main', 'leads', 'were', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'mostly', 'family', 'friendly', 'might', 'want', 'know', 'was', 'one', 'incident', 'profanity', 'one', 'swearing', 'Also', 'when', 'Jessica', 'first', 'sister', 'friend', 'used', 'meet', 'woods', 'mentioned', 'ages', 'time', 'sister', 'out', 'guys', 'did', 'woods', 'finally', 'winced', 'little', 'when', 'Jessica', 'mom', 'mentions', 'getting', 'butts', 'Florida', 'Not', 'kind', 'thing', 'say', 'home', 'know', 'mild', 'today', 'standards.One', 'things', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'actors', 'were', 'talking', 'way', 'people', 'really', 'talk', 'other', 'days', 'not', 'just', 'reading', 'memorized', 'lines', 'were', 'clever', 'exchanges', 'especially', 'Jessica', 'sister', 'Anna', 'played', 'Elisa', 'Donovan', 'are', 'concerned', 'good', 'role', 'models', 'kids', 'other', 'little', 'normal', 'disappointment', 'not', 'getting', 'dog', 'Christmas', 'children', 'movie', 'are', 'well-behaved']",N/A

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[5, 8]","Based on the cover and description of this movie, I was expecting a family movie along the lines of the Air Bud movies - lots of dog shots, kids, and a plot that centers around them. Instead the main drama in this film is all adults - a divorced man and woman, each with one child, who knew each other as children but don't yet recognize each other. They both have personal issues they are working through, and are thrown together through a real estate transaction (he is buying her parent's house, which she has since decided she wants.) A golden retriever, who looks a lot like a dog that they played with as kids, turns up and seems to be conspiring to get them to recognize each other and come together once again.The problem from the perspective of kids watching this movie is that the dog gets too little screen time, there are few shots of the couple as kids, and most of the drama centers around their personal dramas and the complicated real estate issues. My kids, ages 5 & 7, were totally uninterested except for 2 minutes towards the end where some puppies are finally shown.So this definitely won't keep younger kids engaged, perhaps older kids would appreciate the romantic drama, but even for them, this isn't a highly entertaining film, and certainly not an animal film.",2,Too Much Adult Drama and Too Little Golden Screen Time,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1286,"['Based', 'cover', 'description', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'family', 'movie', 'lines', 'Air', 'Bud', 'movies', 'lots', 'dog', 'shots', 'kids', 'plot', 'centers', 'Instead', 'main', 'drama', 'film', 'adults', 'divorced', 'man', 'woman', 'one', 'child', 'who', 'knew', 'other', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'recognize', 'other', 'have', 'personal', 'issues', 'are', 'working', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'real', 'estate', 'transaction', 'buying', 'parent', 'house', 'decided', 'golden', 'retriever', 'who', 'lot', 'dog', 'played', 'kids', 'up', 'be', 'conspiring', 'get', 'recognize', 'other', 'come', 'together', 'once', 'again.The', 'problem', 'perspective', 'kids', 'watching', 'movie', 'dog', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'shots', 'couple', 'kids', 'most', 'drama', 'centers', 'personal', 'dramas', 'complicated', 'real', 'estate', 'issues', 'My', 'kids', '5', '7', 'were', 'totally', 'uninterested', '2', 'minutes', 'end', 'where', 'puppies', 'are', 'finally', 'shown.So', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'keep', 'younger', 'kids', 'engaged', 'perhaps', 'older', 'kids', 'would', 'appreciate', 'romantic', 'drama', 'even', ""n't"", 'highly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'animal', 'film']",N/A

I don't know of any child over 8, or even before, that hasn't had a sweet crush on someone, and shared something, even if just a rock, for friendship.  I am 74 and having raised 7 children have witnessed many a crush that is sweet and not sexual...there is NOTHING that would encourage anything sexual in this sweet movie...in a day when there is precious little on the screen you can watch...and any 'misdeeds' in the movie are acknowledged and repented and discussed the correct handling...life is not perfect and it shows the results and recovering from wrong decisions.
