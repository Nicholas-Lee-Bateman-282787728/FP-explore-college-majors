Guy goes to strip club meets stripper, smokes pot, and a week later he is addicted to coke, has pretty much dropped out of law school, is cheating on his girl and is pulling guns on people. Yeah. Ok. He does coke 3 times yet he goes through withdrawals in jail. Really?The chicks are ok, but not enough to save the rest of the movie. If you want to see a guy in a bowling shirt acting like a wanna be gangster then this is your movie. This would fit better as a Lifetime network movie of the week...

I can't help it I am a loyal fan and will get any thing with the man's name on it. This film luckily is a pretty decent film, though it tries to hard to be like every other film in its genre. The story is all about a kid named Tristan Price played by Jesse Medcalfe going out one night with his little brother and meeting the wrong people. These people end up getting him into all kinds of trouble, and even turn his family on him at one point. The leader of these folks is Sebastian played greatly by Corey Large [who also co wrote and co produced], who not only uses Tristan but also goes after his girl.It is actually a pretty good story that Corey, Director/producer Alan Poe, Kyle Kramer, & S.A.Lucerne came up with. And you can tell that Alan Poe was really trying to put together a good movie. The look of the film was good; the feel was good even the sound was good everything meshed real well together. The down side was performances by some of the actors.Kurupt of course gives a wonderful performance in this film but he isn't around long enough to do anything, although the best scene in the film revolves around him when he is about to be killed. It is that scene in particular that Kurupt shines, his performance is great. Same can be said for Corey Large and Vinnie Jones who plays Mr. Black. The led player Jesse Medcalfe is good in this film as his is brother played by Chace Crawford. The problems arise from the females in this film, hence beauty does not equal good acting. And while none of them were horrible, none were impressive either, where's Kathy Bates when you need her.Over all this was a pretty good film, I recommend renting it first to see what you think, but if you are a Kurupt fan go buy it at once",4,KURUPT,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,1789,"['LOADEDNaturally', 'know', 'why', 'got', 'movie', 'KURUPT', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'am', 'loyal', 'fan', 'will', 'get', 'thing', 'man', 'name', 'film', 'luckily', 'pretty', 'decent', 'film', 'hard', 'be', 'other', 'film', 'genre', 'story', 'kid', 'named', 'Tristan', 'Price', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Medcalfe', 'going', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'little', 'brother', 'meeting', 'wrong', 'people', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'kinds', 'trouble', 'even', 'turn', 'family', 'one', 'point', 'leader', 'folks', 'Sebastian', 'played', 'greatly', 'Corey', 'Large', '[', 'who', 'also', 'co', 'wrote', 'co', 'produced', ']', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'Tristan', 'also', 'girl.It', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'Corey', 'Director/producer', 'Alan', 'Poe', 'Kyle', 'Kramer', 'S.A.Lucerne', 'came', 'up', 'can', 'tell', 'Alan', 'Poe', 'was', 'really', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'movie', 'look', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'feel', 'was', 'good', 'even', 'sound', 'was', 'good', 'everything', 'meshed', 'real', 'well', 'together', 'down', 'side', 'was', 'performances', 'actors.Kurupt', 'course', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'film', ""n't"", 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'do', 'anything', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'around', 'when', 'be', 'killed', 'scene', 'particular', 'Kurupt', 'shines', 'performance', 'great', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Corey', 'Large', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Black', 'led', 'player', 'Jesse', 'Medcalfe', 'good', 'film', 'brother', 'played', 'Chace', 'Crawford', 'problems', 'arise', 'females', 'film', 'hence', 'beauty', 'not', 'equal', 'good', 'acting', 'none', 'were', 'horrible', 'none', 'were', 'impressive', 'either', 'where', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'when', 'need', 'her.Over', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'recommend', 'renting', 'first', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'Kurupt', 'fan', 'go', 'buy', 'once']",Loaded

1132886,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0011V7PQY,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[4, 6]","LOADED is a terrible film.  Filled with despicable characters who do ludicrous things, all ninety minutes of this clunker fail to inspire anything but boredom and possibly confusion.The plot follows the young, wealthy, handsome, and over-priviledged Tristan Price (even his name is cool!).  Due to a hazy, drug-induced tragedy during his high school years, Tristan has been put under house arrest by his dad.  Six years later, during his birthday, he's allowed one night out with his buddies.  The party gets a little out of hand, Tristan gets a little caught up in all of the ""fun,"" and his buddies (let's call them Plot Contrivances) disappear for the rest of the movie, while Tristan does all kinds of stupid and illegal things for no apparant reason whatsoever.LOADED is filled with the kind of jittery and over-exposed shots that you're more likely to find in low-rent music videos.  In this case, they are meant to convey Tristan's struggle with the drugs that surround him and the steadily chaotic life that he finds himself living.  The movie trumpets a lame duck attitude of Drugs-Are-Cool-And-Also-Dangerous, a paradox that makes the art-wrecked cinematography all the more unbearable.That's not the least of this film's problems.  Aside from Erin Gray, who plays Tristan's mother, the entire cast of this film fails to make any impression beyond pure boredom.  Jesse Metcalfe's Tristan is particularly annoying, although that may just be because he's the main character.  His slide into delinquency is so easy and so sudden, it makes one wonder if he doesn't have some kind of mental disorder.  The story tries to make the father out as some kind of demanding czar, but considering how Tristan immediately turns to drugs and guns the moment he is let out of the house, the father's knee-jerk paranoia doesn't seem so misplaced.  As it is, Tristan is only likable inasmuch as you are willing to believe that he is simply a put-upon idiot.Tristan is swayed by the schmoozy charms of a drug dealer named Sebastian.  Played by Corey Large (who also co-wrote the film), Sebastian is smug, distant, and says all of his lines as if he is at the script's first read-through.  He's meant to be charming and absorbing, but the only fascinating thing about him is how tiny his face is in comparison to his head.  His world of cocaine and bullets is no different than any other low-budget dreck that tries to make killing people exciting, with the possible exception that it is conspicuously devoid of any graphic violence or nudity.  Great pains are taken to make it obvious that there's more to Sebastian than meets the eye, but unless the viewer is as stupid as Tristan, there are no surprises to be found here, and certainly no fun.",1,Shooting Blanks,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,2735,"['LOADED', 'terrible', 'film', 'Filled', 'despicable', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'ludicrous', 'things', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'clunker', 'fail', 'inspire', 'anything', 'boredom', 'possibly', 'confusion.The', 'plot', 'young', 'wealthy', 'handsome', 'over-priviledged', 'Tristan', 'Price', 'even', 'name', 'cool', 'Due', 'hazy', 'drug-induced', 'tragedy', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'Tristan', 'been', 'put', 'house', 'arrest', 'dad', 'Six', 'years', 'later', 'birthday', 'allowed', 'one', 'night', 'buddies', 'party', 'little', 'hand', 'Tristan', 'little', 'caught', 'up', 'fun', 'buddies', 'let', 'call', 'Plot', 'Contrivances', 'disappear', 'rest', 'movie', 'Tristan', 'kinds', 'stupid', 'illegal', 'things', 'apparant', 'reason', 'whatsoever.LOADED', 'filled', 'kind', 'jittery', 'over-exposed', 'shots', ""'re"", 'more', 'likely', 'find', 'low-rent', 'music', 'videos', 'case', 'are', 'meant', 'convey', 'Tristan', 'struggle', 'drugs', 'surround', 'steadily', 'chaotic', 'life', 'living', 'movie', 'lame', 'duck', 'attitude', 'Drugs-Are-Cool-And-Also-Dangerous', 'paradox', 'art-wrecked', 'cinematography', 'more', 'unbearable.That', 'not', 'least', 'film', 'problems', 'Aside', 'Erin', 'Gray', 'who', 'Tristan', 'mother', 'entire', 'cast', 'film', 'make', 'impression', 'pure', 'boredom', 'Jesse', 'Metcalfe', 'Tristan', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'slide', 'delinquency', 'so', 'easy', 'so', 'sudden', 'one', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'mental', 'disorder', 'story', 'make', 'father', 'out', 'kind', 'demanding', 'czar', 'considering', 'how', 'Tristan', 'immediately', 'drugs', 'moment', 'let', 'house', 'father', 'knee-jerk', 'paranoia', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'misplaced', 'Tristan', 'only', 'likable', 'inasmuch', 'are', 'willing', 'believe', 'simply', 'put-upon', 'idiot.Tristan', 'swayed', 'schmoozy', 'charms', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Sebastian', 'Played', 'Corey', 'Large', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'Sebastian', 'smug', 'distant', 'lines', 'script', 'first', 'read-through', 'meant', 'be', 'charming', 'absorbing', 'only', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'how', 'tiny', 'face', 'comparison', 'head', 'world', 'cocaine', 'bullets', 'different', 'other', 'low-budget', 'dreck', 'make', 'killing', 'people', 'exciting', 'possible', 'exception', 'conspicuously', 'devoid', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nudity', 'Great', 'pains', 'are', 'taken', 'make', 'obvious', 'more', 'Sebastian', 'eye', 'viewer', 'as', 'stupid', 'Tristan', 'are', 'surprises', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'certainly', 'fun']",Loaded
