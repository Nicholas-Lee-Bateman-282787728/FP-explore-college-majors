1426136,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B004QWSU46,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","A Little Bit of Heaven is a film I never heard of before but I'm a fan of Kate Hudson so I decided to take a chance on this little, surprise gem. This romantic drama is very charming and of course, Kate is a delight like always. Kate gets to stretch her acting chops here, she effortlessy plays Marley...a free-spirit who lives her life by her own rules but then she gets the worse news anyone could ever get, she has colon cancer and the chances of survival are not good. I liked this movie, the supporting cast is great from Kathy Bates to Lucy Punch. A Little Bit of Heaven may seem fluffy and weepy but I think it's one of the most rewarding films I've seen in many years. My only gripe is I thought the guy who's plays Marley's doctor, Julian wasn't very engaging and lacked chemistry with her. But still, it's definitely worth checking out...enjoy!",4,Heavenly Kate.,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,854,"['Little', 'Bit', 'Heaven', 'film', 'never', 'heard', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'little', 'surprise', 'gem', 'romantic', 'drama', 'very', 'charming', 'course', 'Kate', 'delight', 'always', 'Kate', 'stretch', 'acting', 'chops', 'here', 'effortlessy', 'plays', 'Marley', 'free-spirit', 'who', 'life', 'own', 'rules', 'then', 'worse', 'news', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'colon', 'cancer', 'chances', 'survival', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'liked', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Heaven', 'may', 'seem', 'fluffy', 'weepy', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'rewarding', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'only', 'gripe', 'thought', 'guy', 'who', 'plays', 'Marley', 'doctor', 'Julian', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'engaging', 'lacked', 'chemistry', 'still', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'enjoy']",A Little Bit Of Heaven

1426141,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B004QWSU46,Anthony Pittore,"[5, 11]","'A Little Bit of Heaven,' which will be the final film released by the the now-bankrupt studio The Film Department, is really a blown opportunity. Not so much the film itself, but the title. After hearing that title and seeing the great Peter Dinklage as the #2 listed cast member, I was excited. Could a movie actually take a risk and have the main character date a little person/dwarf? Now, it wouldn't be the first time that this would have happened, though the only one that comes to memory is 'Freaks' and I don't think that casts a good light on the subject. Unfortunately, the only relation the title has to Dinklage is the nickname he was given within his profession (I won't give away what that profession is, however, for sake of not ruining the best part of the film).The film stars Kate Hudson as Marley, a slutty marketing exec who either doesn't believe in love or just enjoys gallivanting around with random men too much. After feeling rundown after a particularly intense night of said gallivanting, Marley heads to the doctor to get herself checked out. After a few tests come back with bad results, she finds out that she's suffering from colorectal cancer and has only a short while to live. This news is first broken to her by none other than God. . . played by Whoopi Goldberg. . . in an anaesthesia-induced hallucination. Her future is then confirmed by awkward, but apparently handsome, oncologist Julian (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), who convinces her to sign up for a dangerous experimental treatment for no other reason than to have the film make her look more tired and give her a few more days to fall in love. Also joining Marley's side in her time of need is her best friend Sarah (Lucy Punch) and her combative parents (Kathy Bates & Treat Williams).Instead of straying from the conformity of modern romance stories, 'A Little Bit of Heaven' grabs right onto them and holds on for dear life. It takes almost all of the elements of past ""dying comedies"" (like Queen Latifah's 'Last Holiday' and Angelina Jolie's 'Life or Something Like It') and stuffs them into the film, including a funny ""risk-taking"" scene (hang gliding here), laughing off the condition as ""not so bad,"" and falling in love with the doctor. It doesn't bother to add much of anything new, except the use of Whoopi Goldberg as God, though there have been funnier choices to play a deity (Alannis Morisette in 'Dogma' comes to mind). After Judd Apatow released 'Funny People,' even if it wasn't universally loved, I had hoped that this small subgenre of comedy would get a push in the right direction. Unfortunately, it looks as if it's going to continue to cling onto the same conventions for a bit longer. The film does contain some heartfelt moments that may jerk some tears from the ducts of our more emotional audience members, but after the emotional manipulation ends, there isn't much else. That being said, it's not really a poorly written film. It's just not a bravely written one and that will leave it to be nothing more than a forgettable entry in the filmographies for the otherwise talented cast.Final Verdict: 6/10.-AP3-",3,"A heartfelt ""dying"" comedy that fails with its conventions",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3133,"['Little', 'Bit', 'Heaven', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'film', 'released', 'now-bankrupt', 'studio', 'Film', 'Department', 'really', 'blown', 'opportunity', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'title', 'hearing', 'title', 'seeing', 'great', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', '2', 'listed', 'cast', 'member', 'was', 'excited', 'Could', 'movie', 'actually', 'take', 'risk', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'date', 'little', 'person/dwarf', 'Now', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'only', 'one', 'memory', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'light', 'subject', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'relation', 'title', 'Dinklage', 'nickname', 'was', 'given', 'profession', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'profession', 'however', 'sake', 'not', 'ruining', 'best', 'part', 'film', '.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Marley', 'slutty', 'marketing', 'exec', 'who', 'either', ""n't"", 'believe', 'love', 'just', 'enjoys', 'gallivanting', 'random', 'men', 'too', 'much', 'feeling', 'rundown', 'particularly', 'intense', 'night', 'said', 'gallivanting', 'Marley', 'heads', 'doctor', 'get', 'checked', 'out', 'few', 'tests', 'come', 'back', 'bad', 'results', 'out', 'suffering', 'colorectal', 'cancer', 'only', 'short', 'while', 'live', 'news', 'first', 'broken', 'none', 'other', 'God', 'played', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'anaesthesia-induced', 'hallucination', 'future', 'then', 'confirmed', 'awkward', 'apparently', 'handsome', 'oncologist', 'Julian', 'Gael', 'Garc', 'iacute', 'Bernal', 'who', 'sign', 'up', 'dangerous', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'other', 'reason', 'have', 'film', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'tired', 'give', 'few', 'more', 'days', 'fall', 'love', 'Also', 'joining', 'Marley', 'side', 'time', 'need', 'best', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'combative', 'parents', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Treat', 'Williams', '.Instead', 'straying', 'conformity', 'modern', 'romance', 'stories', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Heaven', 'grabs', 'right', 'dear', 'life', 'almost', 'elements', 'past', 'dying', 'comedies', 'Queen', 'Latifah', ""'Last"", 'Holiday', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', ""'Life"", 'Something', 'stuffs', 'film', 'including', 'funny', 'risk-taking', 'scene', 'hang', 'gliding', 'here', 'laughing', 'off', 'condition', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'falling', 'love', 'doctor', ""n't"", 'bother', 'add', 'much', 'anything', 'new', 'use', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'God', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'choices', 'play', 'deity', 'Alannis', 'Morisette', ""'Dogma"", 'mind', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'released', ""'Funny"", 'People', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'universally', 'loved', 'had', 'hoped', 'small', 'subgenre', 'comedy', 'would', 'get', 'push', 'right', 'direction', 'Unfortunately', 'going', 'continue', 'cling', 'same', 'conventions', 'bit', 'longer', 'film', 'contain', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'may', 'jerk', 'tears', 'ducts', 'more', 'emotional', 'audience', 'members', 'emotional', 'manipulation', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'really', 'poorly', 'written', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'bravely', 'written', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'forgettable', 'entry', 'filmographies', 'otherwise', 'talented', 'cast.Final', 'Verdict', '6/10.-AP3-']",A Little Bit Of Heaven

1426148,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004QWSU46,Grady Harp,"[17, 21]","Two young women - writer Gren Wells and director Nicole Kassell - make a solid impression with this little film that explores human relationships from family to friends to lovers in a manner that makes us look to either side of ourselves and appreciate what we have.  Yes, it is a little bit of a fluff movie until the latter half, but it is populated with some very fine performances that make us appreciate that fine line between comedy and tragedy, realizing that the difference is all a matter of perspective.Marley Corbett (Kate Hudson) is a beautiful ad executive who collects one night stands lake a magnet - by her own choosing.  She is afraid of commitment, perhaps reflecting her experience with her parents Beverly Corbett (Kathy Bates) and  Jack Corbett (Treat Williams)  - a couple who seem perennially at odds with each other and the world and maintain a distance form Marley.  Marley has solid friendships: Sarah (Lucy Punch) tries to learn feminine wiles techniques from Marley, Renee (Rosemarie DeWitt) has Marley babysit her delightful child Cammie while she tends to mothering and wifeing with her husband (Jason Davis - she is again pregnant), her boss  Rob (Steven Weber) and her gay next door neighbor Peter Cooper (Romany Malco).  Marley sleeps with lots of attractive guys but when they begin to talk about longterm relationships, Marley backs off.At the advertising agency Marley is asked if she is losing weight, a question that drives Marley to the doctor.  Her new physician is Dr. Julian Goldstein (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), a handsome but shy and dedicated young man who examines Marley and sedates her for colonoscopy: while Marley is under medication she dreams of being in heaven next to God (Whoopi Goldberg) who tells her she is dying and gives her three wishes - Marley chooses a million dollars, a chance to fly, and to find love. Upon awakening she is informed she has extensive colon cancer and Dr. Goldstein suggests she see a Dr. Sanders (Alan Dale) who offers her two choices - extensive chemotherapy or death.  Marley chooses the former and from there she begins to alter her relationships with everyone around her. She gradually falls in love with Dr. Goldstein, confronts her parents and friends with her news, and the manner in which they accept her fate is where the film alters to a tender heart-warming gentle string of events that should be seen instead of read.It is so rewarding to see Kate Hudson expand her acting talent into a serious role and she manages to find that perfect balance between the lighthearted personality we all recognize and the empathetic and vulnerable woman she becomes. Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal assumes a new type of role and is completely charming and loveable.  There is a fine cameo by Peter Dinklage - a Special Escort hired by neighbor Peter to give Marley `a little bit of heaven' - and Kathy Bates, Lucy Punch, and Romany Malco are particularly fine.  This film will likely bring a few tears to the viewer's eyes, but those releases of emotion just make us feel better about life.  Despite the few over the edge silly parts in the film this is a solid little gem that should find an appreciative audience when it reaches the theaters.

It is, of course, a role served up to her on a platter - the kooky, beautiful, commitment phobic, dying young woman - but she excels, absolutely lighting up the screen in every scene.  She inhabits the character of Marley so thoroughly, the viewer almost believes it could really happen this way.  However, the plot contains a major flaw.How does this very serious doctor who has no life suddenly determine that it is OK to have a personal relationship with a patient?  And what happens to all his other patients, now that he is seemingly spending most of his time with Marley?  In the real world, Julian's actions would constitute a serious breach of ethics.  In the movie world, it is addressed by a single line of dialogue (which is subsequently disregarded).  Granted, Marley's personal magnetism is considerable and the time left to spend with her is limited.  However, Julian mentioned that he felt indebted to others for getting the job, and he basically lived at the hospital.  The dramatic tension between his personal and professional obligations is completely missing and creates a huge void.Then again, this is Movieland, and all of the actors are utterly charming.  I love certain movies in spite of their flaws, usually because the performances are especially compelling and/or the dialogue is well above average.  I watch those movies over and over, and eventually the flaws kind of disappear.  I have a feeling this is going to be one of those movies for me.

I was thoroughly delighted with the acting of Kate Hudson (Marley Corbett) while looking for her to pull out her acting chops once again as I have seen her do before. In her engrossing portrayal of Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical account 'Almost Famous', Hudson shines as the brightest and promising new star on the horizon.In this movie she also is able to deliver on several levels and in diverse genres.  She is not pigeonholed into being just a comedic actress.  While there is the element of comedy also present, Hudson also pulls the tears and much drama.Set in New Orleans, Marley is on top as an advertising executive and at the pinnacle of her career succeeding on her own terms.  She is fulfilled through her high power status enjoying many gratifying friendships and is completely lovable as her story enfolds and develops.Marley's most relevant friendship is with the wonderful Rosemarie DeWitt (Renee). Kathy Bates and Treat Williams star as her divorced parents.  First completely self-absorbed, emotionally vacant and severely critical of Marley.  One could easily respect her apprehension toward committed relationships with her bickering role models. As Beverly and Jack, they do a wonderful job in their spot-on roles of her parents.Marley begins to notice herself feeling drained, fatigued and being told she is losing weight.  At her friends urging she visits Dr. Julian Goldstein, the superlative actor Gael Garcia Bernal in a different role for him.I enjoyed Bernal in this movie. He is charming through the dichotomy of feelings he starts having for Marley and is quite shy owning a sweet uncomfortable nature.The two visit a jazz club in the French Quarter where we are treated to the music of local musician Ivan Neville and his band.  The two begin talking more while singer Macy Gray lends a lovely background song as the two inevitably fall in love.Marley finally begins to resolve massive relationship issues with her parents and going forward to start relating to them as their daughter.  Co-workers and her very important friends need attending to also, the priority being the emotionally distraught Renee.  The two actresses share an intense scene at Renee's home that may draw tears as DeWitt punches it home.There is an underlying theme to this. I find the movie would be better served by excluding it and taking it as the relationship driven movie it intends to be.  It is a solid piece with or without it.

Great friends and a personal life that she is OK with. After a visit to the doctor changes her life she decides that a change to her personal life is needed, fast. Without trying to give too much away I have to say the preview was misleading (to me anyway). I was expecting a comedy along the lines of ""50/50"". While this did have some funny moments in this it is much more of an emotional movie then I expected. I don't want you to misunderstand me on this because this was a very good movie and I enjoyed it quite a bit, but don't go in expecting to laugh as much as you did at ""50/50"". I would compare this more to the TV show ""Big C"". The movie is good and definately worth watching but this is more of a love story then I expected as well. Not to sound morbid, but I would call ""50/50"" more of a guy's cancer movie while this one is more of a chick flick. Both are good but I liked ""50/50"" more.

Kate Hudson is a good solid actress but this movie did nothing for her career. It unfortunately ends like ""Love Story"" but the script doesn't help what otherwise would be good actors portraying genuine characters. The young Doctor introduces himself and we have to be told that he is Mexican-Jewish which is ridiculous and totally irrelevant. Do real people introduce themselves with the qualification that they are Catholic-Canadian or Danish-Lutheran, American-Baptist, etc. immediately after giving their name? Like ""Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'm German-American Episcopalian. It would be refreshing to watch a movie without having to know what religion the people are since, for the most part, its irrelevant to the story. I give this movie one star for cinematography, set design, sound quality, etc.  A love story? No way.  The relationship is superficial at best and Mr. Bernal as the doctor doesn't make it work nor is he at all believable. The movie starts with wild kisses and hugs but its for her African-American neighbor who just happens to be gay. This movie leaves one wondering if all of America is mostly homosexual and all doctors are Jewish. Good grief give the non-Jewish and non-homosexual community a decent break and try to mix the characters up just a bit to represent something close to what America currently is and what it is all about.

Doctors give her poison to ""treat"" the tumor.The so called specialist (oncologist) only knows poison (...chemo) to treat cancer, or more lethal poison (clinical trial that makes you really sick).She is full of contradictions. While a vegetarian, when her mom asks her if she thought about finding another doctor that uses nutrition and non-toxic treatments she laughs at her (...""I don't want any of the healy feel thing mom""). This is the idea the average person has about alternative treatments. Because the important guy with the white coat that knows everything (...i.e. oncologists) told her that only chemo will save her life. However, she is a very smart college educated advertising executive. But she wouldn't try anything else. Not even out of curiosity (...at this point what does she has to lose? She is dying anyway) because when she was in college she probably avoided all science classes. There are so many NON-TOXIC treatments out there that REALLY WORK. Get informed people!Selfish family entourage (except her mom). Her sister doesn't want to get involved because she is pregnant and her dad (who probably divorced her mom when she was in grade school) is busy traveling even when she is terminal (...call me if you need anything)Great acting. Kate Hudson and Kathy Bates are FANTASTIC. The two doctors are really well portrayed in their ignorance and focus on chemotherapy. The only problem is Whoopi Goldberg. She is not really believable and she doesn't look comfortable in her role. Bad choice.
