Make no mistake, you have watch the first movie, or else it'll be impossible to keep up with what's happening.The short version is, I like it. It's an ending, and after the first movie was just treading water, it felt good to finally see the plot seriously moving forward. I did have to watch it twice to really grasp what was happening. There's a subplot that goes no where, and the plot is still entrenched in Japanese politics. What EXACTLY makes the ""Japanese Home Ministry"" so bad, or that tax that was proposed is lost on me. But, on the positive side, the resolution technically makes sense. Sorta. In that Japanese way.So, if you've already bought the first two parts of the series, I recommend this movie. I liked it better than ""King of Eden.""Now, the long version is Eden of the East was at it's core a battle between Takizawa and Mononobe, and if you were paying attention, you could see this coming. Considering all those who were eliminated during the series and first movie, there could only be one logical conclusion.In hindsight, the movies are bogged down by the ""Make me king,"" request. Firstly, I think they meant, ""Get me elected Prime Minster of Japan."" Second, I think Taki's too young to be a candidate for PM. Third, what are his actual qualifications? The subplot about Taki's mom goes nowhere, and they expect us to believe one to many coincidences. And it amounts to nothing over all.The core conflict is Mononobe trying to frame Eden of the East, Takizawa and the 20,000 NEETs as terrorists. His plan is the 9/11 conspiracy: incite chaos, use the aftermath to pass your own agenda. It's so relatable and it's empowering to see our ""savior"" defeat the politician at every turn.Like I said, I like it because it's a reasonable ending, but I can see people disliking all the fake drama that haunt the movies. If you haven't spent money on the series, I say give it time. It'll be cheaper later. But, if you've already got the first two parts, maybe keep in mind what I said and maybe you'll enjoy it better. Maybe.If the Series is an ""A"".King of Eden is ""D+""Paradise Lost is ""B-""",4,The End of Eden,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,2209,"['Paradise', 'Lost', 'second', 'movie', 'third', 'final', 'part', 'Eden', 'East', 'Make', 'mistake', 'have', 'watch', 'first', 'movie', 'else', ""'ll"", 'be', 'impossible', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'happening.The', 'short', 'version', 'like', 'ending', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'treading', 'water', 'felt', 'good', 'finally', 'see', 'plot', 'seriously', 'moving', 'forward', 'did', 'have', 'watch', 'twice', 'really', 'grasp', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'subplot', 'where', 'plot', 'still', 'entrenched', 'Japanese', 'politics', 'What', 'EXACTLY', 'Japanese', 'Home', 'Ministry', 'so', 'bad', 'tax', 'was', 'proposed', 'lost', 'positive', 'side', 'resolution', 'technically', 'sense', 'Sorta', 'Japanese', 'way.So', ""'ve"", 'already', 'bought', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'series', 'recommend', 'movie', 'liked', 'better', 'King', 'Eden', 'Now', 'long', 'version', 'Eden', 'East', 'was', 'core', 'battle', 'Takizawa', 'Mononobe', 'were', 'paying', 'attention', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'Considering', 'who', 'were', 'eliminated', 'series', 'first', 'movie', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'logical', 'conclusion.In', 'hindsight', 'movies', 'are', 'bogged', 'down', 'Make', 'king', 'request', 'Firstly', 'think', 'meant', 'Get', 'elected', 'Prime', 'Minster', 'Japan', 'Second', 'think', 'Taki', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'candidate', 'PM', 'Third', 'what', 'are', 'actual', 'qualifications', 'subplot', 'Taki', 'mom', 'nowhere', 'expect', 'believe', 'one', 'many', 'coincidences', 'nothing', 'over', 'all.The', 'core', 'conflict', 'Mononobe', 'trying', 'frame', 'Eden', 'East', 'Takizawa', '20,000', 'NEETs', 'terrorists', 'plan', '9/11', 'conspiracy', 'incite', 'chaos', 'use', 'aftermath', 'pass', 'own', 'agenda', 'so', 'relatable', 'empowering', 'see', 'savior', 'defeat', 'politician', 'turn.Like', 'said', 'like', 'reasonable', 'ending', 'can', 'see', 'people', 'disliking', 'fake', 'drama', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'spent', 'money', 'series', 'say', 'give', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cheaper', 'later', ""'ve"", 'already', 'got', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'maybe', 'keep', 'mind', 'what', 'said', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'better', 'Maybe.If', 'Series', 'A', '.King', 'Eden', 'D+', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'B-']",Eden of the East: Paradise Lost

We finally get to find out who the final salecao's are and who Mr. Outside really is.I have to say the animation is really good in this anime, and the CG effects they have mix well with the awesome animation. I think they did a really good job on drawing the characters, and they don't default to the typical anime huge eyes and fan service. They did a real good job in making the characters different and not the same clone as everyone else.The music fits the anime well, and pulls you right into the story. Along with that you have a fantastic English dub that doesn't sound like a knife to a blackboard, like some of the worse Anime's out there. I have to say though, Funimation is starting to become a really good company, and they are even picking up Anime's that previous companies canceled for translation (like .hack//quantum), so it's nice helping sustain the industry with good anime.The package comes with a DVD and Blu-ray, in a case with a cardboard slip cover. The DVD/Blu-ray has awesome drawings on them, and around the DVD has the famous Juis quote at the end of any request a Salecao makes. I currently don't have a blu-ray player, but the quality of picture the DVD has is outstanding, and I'm sure the blu-ray has perfect HD. The main special feature is a commentary, which has the cast being asked questions throughout the movie at key moments that their characters had. Also comes with the trailers that Eden of the East, King of Eden, and Paradise Lost had, with some other random anime trailers.I have to say the story had a nice little conclusion to the plot, but one part did annoy me. I'm not going to say that part due to spoilers, but some people may get annoyed with it as well.

But the two movies not so much.Promised the protagonist becoming King or prince, never happened.Promised to declare winner, ended up declaring everyone winner. Completely lost intensity of the game in the movies, changed the rules midway, no more death for losers. Then #1 and #9 decided to work together.Why would a weak speech and 1 yen make the country better?Promised romance: never happened.No more fresh ideas: memory wipe again, lost passport again, coming to America again,Pointless plots: Taki's mother, driving around Juizes 1 and 9, the whole wild goose chase about illegitimate son, why would that make the guy better suited to be a king?Stopped the game for no good reason, and started the game again for no good reason. .",3,Below expectations,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,777,"['Spoiler', 'warning.The', 'series', 'was', 'fantastic', 'two', 'movies', 'not', 'so', 'much.Promised', 'protagonist', 'becoming', 'King', 'prince', 'never', 'happened.Promised', 'declare', 'winner', 'ended', 'up', 'declaring', 'everyone', 'winner', 'Completely', 'lost', 'intensity', 'game', 'movies', 'changed', 'rules', 'midway', 'more', 'death', 'losers', 'Then', '1', '9', 'decided', 'work', 'together.Why', 'would', 'weak', 'speech', '1', 'yen', 'make', 'country', 'better', 'Promised', 'romance', 'never', 'more', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'memory', 'wipe', 'again', 'lost', 'passport', 'again', 'coming', 'America', 'again', 'Pointless', 'plots', 'Taki', 'mother', 'driving', 'around', 'Juizes', '1', '9', 'whole', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'why', 'would', 'make', 'guy', 'better', 'suited', 'be', 'king', 'Stopped', 'game', 'good', 'reason', 'started', 'game', 'again', 'good', 'reason']",Eden of the East: Paradise Lost

I didn't really understand the ending as it didn't make a lot of sense, so I was kind of disappointed. They had this great build up with this story and I never really was able to connect the dots. It is still good though, don't get me wrong. I will just repost a new review after I rewatch everything to give this movie the review it deserves.",4,Finally I Own This Movie,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,476,"['be', 'honest', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'watch', 'entire', 'show', 'again', 'first', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'post', 'review', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'had', 'great', 'build', 'up', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'was', 'able', 'connect', 'dots', 'still', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'will', 'just', 'repost', 'new', 'review', 'rewatch', 'everything', 'give', 'movie', 'review']",Eden of the East: Paradise Lost
