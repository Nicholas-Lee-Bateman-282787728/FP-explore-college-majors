This film is so awesome - it should be seen by EVERYONE.  It can truly make a difference in their lives.  It deals with a son who has AIDS and his Mother who he has not spoken to in years.  Actors are top notch (""Dame"" Julie Andrews, Ann Margaret & Hugh Grant!).  My gratitude to anyone & everyone who worked on this film.",5,"Heartwarming, heartbreaking, intelligent & honest",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,433,"['Wow', 'TV', 'movie', 'am', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'such', 'amazing', 'price', 'film', 'so', 'awesome', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'EVERYONE', 'can', 'truly', 'make', 'difference', 'lives', 'son', 'who', 'AIDS', 'Mother', 'who', 'not', 'spoken', 'years', 'Actors', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Dame', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'gratitude', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'film']",Our Sons

946132,ADVRSHBI35H97,B000BO0LFY,"James Donovan ""movie lover""","[18, 21]","I remember when this was first broadcast on TV, back in 1990. I was too young to see it but I always wanted to, since even back then I knew I was gay. When I heard it was coming out on DVD, I jumped at the chance to see it for the first time. And now that I have, I can finally tell you that it's...okay. Granted this was 1990, so I wasn't expecting anything truly deep or daring from this, but watching it, I couldn't help but notice how quaint and careful and well, clinical the whole thing was. The story is basically about a young gay couple, one of whom is played by a young Hugh Grant, trying in vain to sound like an American, even though his mother is played by Julie Andrews. Grant's lover is dying of AIDS and wants to reconcile with his estranged mother (played by a slightly over-the-top Ann Margaret in a blond wig) before he dies. So Grant sends his mother (Andrews) to Arkansas to try and convince his lover's mother, who hasn't seen her son in years to come and see her son. Naturally, being an ignorant woman, she refuses. (There's a high camp moment when Andrews slaps Ann Margaret and calls her a stupid b****.) And so the bulk of the film is about her coming to terms with what she has tried to ignore for years and make peace with her son. The film isn't terrible but it tries so hard to be safe that the inevitable and much needed emotional climax never really comes, at least not in a satisfactory way. The ending is completely rushed and leaves the viewer feeling cheated. But in the end, the film is a product of it's time, so you can't be too harsh towards it. For six bucks, you could do a lot worse, and the curious won't feel too disappointed.",3,"Dated, but still entertaining...",1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1672,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'back', '1990', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'see', 'always', 'wanted', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'knew', 'was', 'gay', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'jumped', 'chance', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'now', 'have', 'can', 'finally', 'tell', 'okay', 'Granted', 'was', '1990', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'truly', 'deep', 'daring', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'how', 'quaint', 'careful', 'well', 'clinical', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'story', 'basically', 'young', 'gay', 'couple', 'one', 'whom', 'played', 'young', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'trying', 'vain', 'sound', 'American', 'even', 'mother', 'played', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Grant', 'lover', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'reconcile', 'estranged', 'mother', 'played', 'slightly', 'over-the-top', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'blond', 'wig', 'So', 'Grant', 'mother', 'Andrews', 'Arkansas', 'try', 'convince', 'lover', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'son', 'years', 'come', 'see', 'son', 'Naturally', 'being', 'ignorant', 'woman', 'high', 'camp', 'moment', 'when', 'Andrews', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'stupid', 'b****', 'so', 'bulk', 'film', 'coming', 'terms', 'what', 'tried', 'ignore', 'years', 'make', 'peace', 'son', 'film', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'safe', 'inevitable', 'much', 'needed', 'emotional', 'climax', 'never', 'really', 'least', 'not', 'satisfactory', 'way', 'ending', 'completely', 'rushed', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'end', 'film', 'product', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'harsh', 'towards', 'six', 'bucks', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'curious', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'disappointed']",Our Sons
946133,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,B000BO0LFY,JJ,"[0, 0]","This movie is so well done in every way that I can't begin to express myself about it.  Julie Andrews is, of course, her usual prissy self but it is appropriate here. When she takes a limo to the trailer park in Arkansas it is just such a wake up call for her that it's funny and heart breaking at the same time.  Hugh Grant is gorgeous in all his youthful beauty and Anne Margaret looks surprisingly well. She does a fantastic job in the role.  I won't give away the story but I think that anyone with any heart at all would love this movie.",5,A Wonderful Movie,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,542,"['movie', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'express', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'course', 'usual', 'prissy', 'self', 'appropriate', 'here', 'When', 'limo', 'trailer', 'park', 'Arkansas', 'just', 'such', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'funny', 'heart', 'breaking', 'same', 'time', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'gorgeous', 'youthful', 'beauty', 'Anne', 'Margaret', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'fantastic', 'job', 'role', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'story', 'think', 'anyone', 'heart', 'would', 'love', 'movie']",Our Sons

946136,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000BO0LFY,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[11, 13]","I have seen this on dish TV a few times now and liked it.  This was an emotionally wrenching story about two sons both gay.  The parents could not be more different.  One is better off fanancially and very cosmopolitan more liberal and accepting.  The other son has parents that are more working class country stock from a more conservative traditional closed minded background.The sons fall in love and one contraversy after another ensues.  I do not want to reveal the nature of the issues raised but let me just say the fur flies as a result. The acting in Our Son's is very beleivable.  The focus is on the two mothers and how differently they respond to the events in their respective sons lives.  Ends up both parents and others involved in the lives of the two son's have a lot of growing up to do.  Everyone touched by the choices the sons make is left profoundly changed. Only you can say if it if is for the better.  Take a look at the DVD, it is pretty good.  The ending is pretty happy and arrived at only after hard work on the parts of all conserned.  Alas it is sort of bitter sweet in the end.The DVD is worth it.  This is a must have DVD in my collection and I think you will like it too.",5,Life Depicted in this DVD is Nowhere Near Pretty But Very Real and Heartwarming,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,1205,"['have', 'seen', 'dish', 'TV', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'liked', 'was', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'story', 'two', 'sons', 'gay', 'parents', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'One', 'better', 'fanancially', 'very', 'cosmopolitan', 'more', 'liberal', 'accepting', 'other', 'son', 'parents', 'are', 'more', 'working', 'class', 'country', 'stock', 'more', 'conservative', 'traditional', 'closed', 'minded', 'background.The', 'sons', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'contraversy', 'ensues', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'reveal', 'nature', 'issues', 'raised', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'fur', 'flies', 'result', 'acting', 'Son', 'very', 'beleivable', 'focus', 'two', 'mothers', 'how', 'differently', 'respond', 'events', 'respective', 'sons', 'lives', 'up', 'parents', 'others', 'involved', 'lives', 'two', 'son', 'have', 'lot', 'growing', 'up', 'do', 'Everyone', 'touched', 'choices', 'sons', 'make', 'left', 'profoundly', 'changed', 'Only', 'can', 'say', 'better', 'Take', 'look', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'ending', 'pretty', 'happy', 'arrived', 'only', 'hard', 'work', 'parts', 'conserned', 'Alas', 'sort', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'end.The', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'too']",Our Sons
