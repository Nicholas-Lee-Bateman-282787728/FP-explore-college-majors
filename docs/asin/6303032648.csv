This was the third installment in the 'Dennis-Meg' film triligy and it's a pretty good one at that.  'Flesh and Bone' serves up a decent thriller with some very good acting all the way around.  Dennis Quaid plays Arlis, a man tormented daily by the memories of his terrible childhood.  He wears this torment etched across his face at all times (if you want to know who Heath Ledger gets his Ennis Del Mar from just watch Dennis here...it's uncanny).  He is a drifter, moving around constantly restocking vending machines for a living in an attempt to forget where he came from.  After having a fall out with her husband, Kay (Meg Ryan) falls into his life bringing home an uncomfortable disturbance in Arlis' all to routine life.  You see, Kay is running from a past that Arlis is connected to in a way he would have never guessed, and it's not until Arlis' 'evil' father Roy (Caan in a brutally frightening performance) shows up with his partner in crime Ginnie (Paltrow in a scene stealing role) that their pasts are revieled.  The final few frames of this film are intence and surreal as you watch Arlis confront the demons he's been running from and take action towards redemption.

351713,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,6303032648,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[1, 9]","&quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; earns two stars only because of the acting brilliance of Gwyneth Paltrow. She is thoroughly believable as Ginnie, a poorly educated girl-woman who even steals from corpses awaiting burial. Ginnie has a serious alcohol dependency problem, and seeks love and companionship from the much older Roy Sweeney (James Cann). Unfortunately, Paltrow has only has a supporting role in this mess of a movie. The other marquee named cast members include both Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. Why did they involve themselves in &quot;Flesh and Bone?&quot; Paltrow at least had an excuse because her career was in its early stages eight years ago. One can only assume that Cann wanted the challenge to portray someone totally manipulative and despicable. Cann's intentions may have been noble, but in the future he needn't be so lackadaisical and careless in his actual choices.The story line revolves around the peculiar family values embraced by Roy and his son Arlis (Quaid). At the very beginning, we witness Roy wiping out a family so as not to leave behind any witnesses and &quot;loose ends.&quot; A very young boy is even deliberately slaughtered by the father. Arlis is exhorted to always remain loyal to his immediate family regardless of their violent misdeeds. Blood is supposedly more important than adhering to the standard moral norms of compassion and honesty. Quaid's character is far too normal and decent. In real life, it is far likelier that an Arlis would be just as psychopathic as his primary parental role model. Meg Ryan as Kay is also never for a moment convincing as an adult woman of a proverbial white trash background. She fails completely to hide her upper middle class diction. The Director Steven Kloves apparently thought that Ryan's authenticity would be unquestioned if she merely left her hair uncombed. He was egregiously wrong, and the audience had to suffer the consequences. Kloves had so much talent to work with, and yet accomplished so little. The movie's pace slowed to the point where personal self discipline was required to sit through &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; until its banal conclusion.Gwyneth Paltrow fans should make sure &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; is in their collection.

351715,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,6303032648,Jason Horsley,"[8, 10]","Steve Kloves' Flesh and Bone (1993) is a rare bird indeed, a movie with unassuming depths. A beautiful film, moving and eerie and almost mysterious in its effects, it has a grace and poetry all its own. And it went almost entirely unnoticed by the movie-going public. (Today it is perhaps best known, if known at all, as one of Gwyneth Paltrow's earliest featured roles.) It's easy to see why it disappeared without a trace: it's an incredibly subtle film by any standards, and compared to your average '90s fare, it barely ""exists"" at all. It's like a phantom, a hazy dream. Watching it is like passing through a roadside town, catching a glimpse of a diner and a bar, and imagining the lives of ordinary folk (never so ordinary as we think); then scratching the surface of their routines, and revealing the turmoil beneath. Flesh and Bone is a real road movie, maybe the best of them all, because it creates a perfect sense of people moving, forever moving, but never actually getting anywhere. The characters in the movie are like fish in a barrel, like flies in a sun-drenched room; their movement is central to who they are as people, and also to the meaning and the structure of the film, which is about rootlessness: a lack of having any place to go.  All the characters in Flesh and Bone are restless; they are searching for something without knowing, or especially caring, what. They are simply moving because they cannot bear to remain still;  like blood in the veins, perhaps.From THE BLOOD POETS, by Jake Horsley[...]",5,A Rare Bird,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1529,"['Steve', 'Kloves', 'Flesh', 'Bone', '1993', 'rare', 'bird', 'indeed', 'movie', 'unassuming', 'depths', 'beautiful', 'film', 'moving', 'eerie', 'almost', 'mysterious', 'effects', 'grace', 'poetry', 'own', 'went', 'almost', 'entirely', 'unnoticed', 'movie-going', 'public', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'known', 'one', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'earliest', 'featured', 'roles', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'disappeared', 'trace', 'incredibly', 'subtle', 'film', 'standards', 'compared', 'average', ""'90s"", 'fare', 'barely', 'exists', 'phantom', 'hazy', 'dream', 'Watching', 'passing', 'roadside', 'town', 'catching', 'glimpse', 'diner', 'bar', 'imagining', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'never', 'so', 'ordinary', 'think', 'then', 'scratching', 'surface', 'routines', 'revealing', 'turmoil', 'beneath', 'Flesh', 'Bone', 'real', 'road', 'movie', 'maybe', 'best', 'perfect', 'sense', 'people', 'moving', 'forever', 'moving', 'never', 'actually', 'getting', 'anywhere', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'fish', 'barrel', 'flies', 'sun-drenched', 'room', 'movement', 'central', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'also', 'meaning', 'structure', 'film', 'rootlessness', 'lack', 'having', 'place', 'go', 'characters', 'Flesh', 'Bone', 'are', 'restless', 'are', 'searching', 'something', 'knowing', 'especially', 'caring', 'what', 'are', 'simply', 'moving', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'remain', 'still', 'blood', 'veins', 'THE', 'BLOOD', 'POETS', 'Jake', 'Horsley', '[', ']']",Flesh & Bone VHS

After I found out it was him, I decided to buy it(and I see I might have been in the minority on this decision). Word of caution, I could not find a place on the net to sample this music so you'll have to go by the film alone. If I were to compare this score to other Newman films, I'd be hard-pressed to find a suitor. One score that comes to mind is the Green Mile. If you like music that makes you think, tracks  #6, #10, #11,#18, #21, and #23 will do. All in all, though, this score is not for those folks who fell in love with other Newman scores like How to Make An American Quilt, Little Women, Fried Green Tomatoes, or Meet Joe Black. It is, to put it plainly, The Green Mile on a very bad day. Even so, I gave it 3 stars because although hard to hear at times, it is very influencial music, especially for a writer like myself who gets inspirtation from music, and this score does just fine for my more morbid writings.

Thomas Newman's score is haunting and evocative; Dennis Quaid, James Caan, Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow offer complex, fleshed out performances.

FLESH AND BONE also pulls a big coincidence that manages to be both improbable and unbelievable.

351725,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6303032648,Mr. Cairene,"[8, 9]","There is a thin line that movies like Flesh and Bone walk, its story line suggests an overwrought film, with loud scenery chewing acting and flashy camera work. This could have easily turned into a pointless variation on  the pointless U-Turn. A credit then to director Steve Klove and his  cinamatagropher Philippe Rousselot for creating a completely original  beast. You may not know it from a plot description, but you will never see  another film quite like this one.In the film's arresting opening scene  an expressionless grim looking boy stands outside a family's house late at  night. He doesn't say a word except that he's lost. They let him in, and  decide to let him stay overnight. But that's not all there is to it, the  boy is actually working with his father on a scheme they've perfected  hundreds of times before, where he waits till the family is asleep and  opens the door to his father to come in and rob the place. Something goes  terribly wrong that night, but the events that transpire in this scene will  haunt every character in this film. This brilliant opening sequence grabs  the veiwer's attention, and makes the slow burning tense plot that follows  all the more mysterious.Dennis Quaid stars as Arliss, a man who isn't  much of a talker, &quot;You're the best listener I've ever met&quot; Kay  Davies (Meg Ryan) tells him when they first meet. &quot;Depends on who's  talking&quot; he replies. As events unfold, with a touch if a supernatural  element we come to fully comprehend why he so unenthusiastic about life.  &quot;I'm a creature of habit&quot; he says at one point, and by then we  know exactly why he feels breaking established habits can be deadly.The dialogue in this film, which is written by the director, literally  stings. There are no throw away lines, or scenes that merely exist to push  the plot forward. Every line is diliberate and calculated, queitly  delivered by a cast who obviously relish this high quality stuff.All  four principle cast member are excellent. I've always admired Dennis Quaid  since Breaking Away, Meg Ryan successfully sheds the light comedy persona,  Gwenyth Paltrow delivers her lines with icey detachment and James Caan is  chilling as a man who &quot;values his sleep&quot;.I'd love to see  more movies by Steve Klove, he has only made one other film The Fabulous  Baker Boys, and most recently he wrote the wonderful Wonder Boys.
