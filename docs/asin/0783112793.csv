42665,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,0783112793,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[44, 44]","What astounds me about these dance/percussion numbers is their intricacy, which must have required relentless rehearsing, and yet there is almost an improvisational, immediate quality about them; some of them are performed on a stage, some on location in New York City, and they seamlessly segue from one to another. I especially like the transition from the alley ball game into the kitchen with the marvelous cigar-chomping chef.This innovative show was created in the early 90s in the U.K. by Luke Cresswell and Steve McNicholas (who met in 1981 as members of a street band called &quot;Pookiesnackenburger&quot;) and they share directorial credits for this HBO film; the show in its stage version has received numerous awards with its many productions around the globe.Some of these performers have star quality, and it's a shame names are not put to the faces, but with so many different casts world-wide, even the ones in this film remain only as part of a list in alphabetical order. The cinematography is also excellent, by Christophe Lanzenberg.One would think that a wordless show with only percussion for music would become monotonous, but it captures and holds our attention because of its imaginitive skill, its humor, and the talent and energy of its performers. Dance fans will love &quot;Stomp Out Loud&quot;. Total running time is 50 minutes, and that includes a 5 minute sketch on the who, how, and where of the film.",5,rhythmic brilliance,1083628800,"05 4, 2004",2004,1435,"['What', 'dance/percussion', 'numbers', 'intricacy', 'must', 'have', 'required', 'relentless', 'rehearsing', 'yet', 'almost', 'improvisational', 'immediate', 'quality', 'are', 'performed', 'stage', 'location', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'seamlessly', 'segue', 'one', 'especially', 'transition', 'alley', 'ball', 'game', 'kitchen', 'marvelous', 'cigar-chomping', 'chef.This', 'innovative', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'early', '90s', 'U.K.', 'Luke', 'Cresswell', 'Steve', 'McNicholas', 'who', 'met', '1981', 'members', 'street', 'band', 'called', 'quot', 'Pookiesnackenburger', 'quot', 'share', 'directorial', 'credits', 'HBO', 'film', 'show', 'stage', 'version', 'received', 'numerous', 'awards', 'many', 'productions', 'globe.Some', 'performers', 'have', 'star', 'quality', 'shame', 'names', 'are', 'not', 'put', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'casts', 'world-wide', 'even', 'ones', 'film', 'remain', 'only', 'part', 'list', 'alphabetical', 'order', 'cinematography', 'also', 'excellent', 'Christophe', 'Lanzenberg.One', 'would', 'think', 'wordless', 'show', 'only', 'percussion', 'music', 'would', 'become', 'monotonous', 'attention', 'imaginitive', 'skill', 'humor', 'talent', 'energy', 'performers', 'Dance', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'quot', 'Stomp', 'Out', 'Loud', 'quot', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '50', 'minutes', '5', 'minute', 'sketch', 'who', 'how', 'where', 'film']",N/A

Very enjoyable for people  interested in seeing a group of talented young performers, or musicians,  make music with percussion through common everyday items.  Using poles,  hammers, trashcans, plastic containers, and anything else that can produce  a beat or a tone, the group provides some astounding sounds that are only  matched by their fascinating techniques.  Most remarkable is a portion of  the group performing with basketballs in an alleyway, using trash-bins,  security doors, and the street itself to produce a rhythmic beat.  There's  another sequence where they perform in the large kitchen of a restaurant,  achieving an amazing range of sounds.  The members of the group are  entertaining to watch and they add a lot of humor to their performances.

In fact, until I saw Stomp in Las Vegas this year, I was only familiar with one piece of theirs: ""Ripper Sole"" from the movie ""Tank Girl."" (And that was a movie that would have benefited greatly from hewing much more closely to the original Hewlett & Martin comic...but that's another review.) But the Stomp show in Vegas was wonderful! Percussion heaven -- if you don't like percussion, stay away from Stomp -- and infused with sly bits of humorous running gags presented entirely with body language and monosyllabics, the performers had us laughing so hard we were gasping for air and our sides were aching; especially with their antics during the show's ""halfway"" point.

42676,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,0783112793,J. Lizzi,"[24, 24]","We already know the extent to which complex, entertaining rythmic compositions can flow from this ensemble's use of everyday ordinary objects, household items, or even junk.  Stomp is so clever that way, and I can't help but reminisce about how often I banged on stuff just for entertainment in my younger days.This performance, taken from an HBO special in 1997, sacrifices a bit of the energy of Stomp's live show for the more intimate perspective gained by having a camera filming in the midst of the performers.  More interesting still are the different locales (all in New York City) used for a number of the routines:  a Soho alley, a kitchen, a rooftop, and even under a pier at a sugar refinery.  I thought the camera work was excellent, and I appreciated having different ""stages"" upon which to showcase these talented performers (they're all accomplished percussionists).  The on-stage (i.e., with the audience) portion of the show differs from the rest in that four cameras were employed to capture a variety of viewing angles from on-stage and off.  You can't get this experience from seeing them live (for me, twice), so that's why I like having this DVD.  Aside from the percussive interaction of the ""band,"" you can also see their faces, so there's an acting component of the show that adds another fun dimension.A few minor disappointments:  fifteen chapters (performance routines) are listed in the keep case notes; however, there's no #15 in the show.  Also, the run time was several minutes shy of the stated 50 minutes (the missing routine?) which is REAL short to begin with.  The ""Special Features"" part of the disc contains nothing but reading material and a few photos.  I was hoping for something like ""Stomp - Behind the Scenes,"" which would have been a blast, so there's almost nothing to be experienced in terms of the group members' personalities or the filming experience.  Maybe on another DVD . . .Overall, I'd recommend this to just about anyone interested in percussion or performance art.",4,An interesting complement to the live show,1018137600,"04 7, 2002",2002,2023,"['already', 'know', 'extent', 'complex', 'entertaining', 'rythmic', 'compositions', 'can', 'flow', 'ensemble', 'use', 'everyday', 'ordinary', 'objects', 'household', 'items', 'even', 'junk', 'Stomp', 'so', 'clever', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'reminisce', 'how', 'often', 'banged', 'stuff', 'just', 'entertainment', 'younger', 'days.This', 'performance', 'taken', 'HBO', 'special', '1997', 'bit', 'energy', 'Stomp', 'live', 'show', 'more', 'intimate', 'perspective', 'gained', 'having', 'camera', 'filming', 'midst', 'performers', 'More', 'interesting', 'still', 'are', 'different', 'locales', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'used', 'number', 'routines', 'Soho', 'alley', 'kitchen', 'rooftop', 'even', 'pier', 'sugar', 'refinery', 'thought', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'excellent', 'appreciated', 'having', 'different', 'stages', 'showcase', 'talented', 'performers', ""'re"", 'accomplished', 'percussionists', 'on-stage', 'i.e.', 'audience', 'portion', 'show', 'differs', 'rest', 'four', 'cameras', 'were', 'employed', 'capture', 'variety', 'viewing', 'angles', 'on-stage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'experience', 'seeing', 'live', 'twice', 'why', 'like', 'having', 'DVD', 'Aside', 'percussive', 'interaction', 'band', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'acting', 'component', 'show', 'fun', 'dimension.A', 'few', 'minor', 'disappointments', 'fifteen', 'chapters', 'performance', 'routines', 'are', 'listed', 'keep', 'case', 'notes', 'however', '15', 'show', 'Also', 'run', 'time', 'was', 'several', 'minutes', 'shy', 'stated', '50', 'minutes', 'missing', 'routine', 'REAL', 'short', 'begin', 'Special', 'Features', 'part', 'disc', 'nothing', 'reading', 'material', 'few', 'photos', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'Stomp', 'Scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'blast', 'almost', 'nothing', 'be', 'experienced', 'terms', 'group', 'members', 'personalities', 'filming', 'experience', 'Maybe', 'DVD', '.Overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'just', 'anyone', 'interested', 'percussion', 'performance', 'art']",N/A

The show truly is pure energy, and it's awesome.The DVD has only a few bits of the live performance.  For the most part, it consists of several filmed segments of people Stomp-ing.  The segments look like music videos.  In other words, they look edited and polished.
