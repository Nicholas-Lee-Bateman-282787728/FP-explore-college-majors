1645016,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00C9VZ6WK,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Trying to find quality films for my daughter to watch is hard.  She wants so badly to move away from the cartoons and `kiddy shows', despite only being six, because she wants so badly to be bigger than she is.  Allowing her to watch certain programs is hard for me, mainly because she's so young and as a parent my main goal in life is to preserve her innocence and keep her as young as I can for as long as possible.  Then my mother suggested the American Girl movies.  She told me that they were a great transition from animation to live action, and she assured me that there was no boyfriend stuff.Seriously, if you have a little girl then you understand why that is a big deal.`Saige Paints the Sky' was the first of the two that we watched, and my daughter LOVED this movie.  My critique of this film and `McKenna Shoots for the Stars' is pretty similar, for the reasons I like and dislike both stem from similar areas.First, this film tells the story of Saige, a young girl who loves to draw (her grandmother is a famous painter).  Saige is horrified to find out that the school has had to cut out the art program thanks to budget cuts.  If that wasn't bad enough, her best friend Tessa has bonded with Dylan while away for the summer at Music Camp and now Saige feels like an outsider.  Things only get worse for young Saige.  Her grandmother gets severely hurt and her own stagefright becomes a roadblock in her campaign to win back the art program by raising the money needed by the school.I have quite a few issues with this film.  First, the film in general has a lot of silly plot points.  Most notably is the fact that the money needed by the school for the art program is a measly $5000.  When you consider that Saige's own grandmother is a very famous painter, and the house Saige lives in is easily worth a few million, I'd say that $5000 was nothing to her family and should have been an easy get.  The parade sub-plot and the ridiculous horse riding scenes don't help much.  In fact, the tricks were so dumb that even my six-year old asked me `what did she do?'.  Nothing honey, she did nothing.  A bigger issue I have with this, and an issue that I share with the `McKenna' film,  is that these young girls panic and breakdown and throw hissy fits about EVERYTHING.  In Saige's world, life ends every five seconds.  The inability to have more than one friend is also an issue shared with both films, and while it is an issue resolved by the film's end, it does take on a dominating presence.  I also find it bizarre that parental supervision of these children is so slight.  These kids, who can't be older than 13, are left to do whatever they want, whenever they want, with no parent in sight.Still, the glossy veneer makes this a fun film to the young ones.  They cheered for Saige when she overcame her fears and when the girls bonded together, and they danced and sang and clapped during the final scene.  Still, I take a serious issue with Saige's actions and her complete and total dramatics.When your daughter starts excusing her tantrums by saying ""I'm just like Saige"" you know you have a problem.",2,An American problem child...,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,3125,"['Trying', 'find', 'quality', 'films', 'daughter', 'watch', 'hard', 'so', 'badly', 'move', 'away', 'cartoons', 'kiddy', 'shows', 'only', 'being', 'six', 'so', 'badly', 'be', 'bigger', 'Allowing', 'watch', 'certain', 'programs', 'hard', 'mainly', 'so', 'young', 'parent', 'main', 'goal', 'life', 'preserve', 'innocence', 'keep', 'as', 'young', 'can', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'Then', 'mother', 'suggested', 'American', 'Girl', 'movies', 'told', 'were', 'great', 'transition', 'animation', 'live', 'action', 'assured', 'was', 'boyfriend', 'stuff.Seriously', 'have', 'little', 'girl', 'then', 'understand', 'why', 'big', 'deal.', 'Saige', 'Paints', 'Sky', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'watched', 'daughter', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'critique', 'film', 'McKenna', 'Shoots', 'Stars', 'pretty', 'similar', 'reasons', 'like', 'dislike', 'stem', 'similar', 'areas.First', 'film', 'story', 'Saige', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'draw', 'grandmother', 'famous', 'painter', 'Saige', 'horrified', 'find', 'out', 'school', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'art', 'program', 'thanks', 'budget', 'cuts', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'best', 'friend', 'Tessa', 'bonded', 'Dylan', 'away', 'summer', 'Music', 'Camp', 'now', 'Saige', 'feels', 'outsider', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'young', 'Saige', 'grandmother', 'severely', 'hurt', 'own', 'stagefright', 'roadblock', 'campaign', 'win', 'back', 'art', 'program', 'raising', 'money', 'needed', 'school.I', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'issues', 'film', 'First', 'film', 'general', 'lot', 'silly', 'plot', 'points', 'Most', 'notably', 'fact', 'money', 'needed', 'school', 'art', 'program', 'measly', '5000', 'When', 'consider', 'Saige', 'own', 'grandmother', 'very', 'famous', 'painter', 'house', 'Saige', 'easily', 'few', 'million', ""'d"", 'say', '5000', 'was', 'nothing', 'family', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'get', 'parade', 'sub-plot', 'ridiculous', 'horse', 'riding', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'fact', 'tricks', 'were', 'so', 'dumb', 'even', 'six-year', 'old', 'asked', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'Nothing', 'honey', 'did', 'nothing', 'A', 'bigger', 'issue', 'have', 'issue', 'share', 'McKenna', 'film', 'young', 'girls', 'panic', 'breakdown', 'throw', 'hissy', 'EVERYTHING', 'Saige', 'world', 'life', 'ends', 'five', 'seconds', 'inability', 'have', 'more', 'one', 'friend', 'also', 'issue', 'shared', 'films', 'issue', 'resolved', 'film', 'end', 'take', 'dominating', 'presence', 'also', 'find', 'parental', 'supervision', 'children', 'so', 'slight', 'kids', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'older', '13', 'are', 'left', 'do', 'want', 'whenever', 'want', 'parent', 'sight.Still', 'glossy', 'veneer', 'fun', 'film', 'young', 'ones', 'cheered', 'Saige', 'when', 'overcame', 'fears', 'when', 'girls', 'bonded', 'together', 'danced', 'sang', 'clapped', 'final', 'scene', 'Still', 'take', 'serious', 'issue', 'Saige', 'actions', 'complete', 'total', 'dramatics.When', 'daughter', 'excusing', 'tantrums', 'saying', ""'m"", 'just', 'Saige', 'know', 'have', 'problem']",N/A

I also like horses and painting, so  I guess I was ready to pick favorites.Saige Copeland is a young artist that for some reason needs to have art at school even though she has her grandmother's art studio to go to. So when Mesa Grande Elementary has to cut art for the year due to budget cuts, Saige is upset and plans to bring art back.Saige is also dealing with the fact that her old friend, Tessa, came back from music camp with a new friend. Saige also makes a new freind, Gabby, but really Saige is extremely shy and not as social as the others.Saige's shyness and lack of boldness makes this story special, the idea is unique.

1645020,ACWSIO0SKFFAZ,B00C9VZ6WK,Cara,"[2, 3]","As a horse-loving artist with a lifelong soft spot for American Girl, I was prepared to love this, but was I ever disappointed! It was not worth the money I spent to rent it.The acting is stiff, superficial, and overwrought throughout, though I think it's more a case of lousy, simplistic script-writing and awkward directing than of poor acting per se. The opening scene promises beautiful scenery, but many of the scenes are obviously faked, with the backdrops added in after filming. The scene in which Saige and her father ride in the balloon is particularly bad - it might as well be a low-budget black-and-white era film with a painted wooden backdrop. It's also obvious that Saige is not really riding the horse, and the riding scenes come off quite stilted and choppy. The lack of realism wouldn't fool any child old enough to be interested in this movie, I would think.As another reviewer mentioned, the film is full of inter-girl drama, all of which is extraordinarily petty, and which also seems far more middle-school than fourth-grade in nature. The Dylan character is a brat, pure and simple, and Tessa and Gabi have few redeeming qualities. The actress playing Saige is beautiful, and her face clearly conveys Saige's sensitivity, passion and sorrow in some scenes, but overall, the movie does her potential a disservice. Instead of inner strength and determination, her character seems to have an outsized helping of whiney-ness and fit-pitching. Even Jane Seymour does little to redeem the film, but again, I think the poor character development is more a flaw in the script and structure of the film itself.I developed real sympathy for none of the characters except MAYBE Saige, and I had to try to like her. And, while perhaps it's a misguided attempt to be realistic, but wouldn't it be better if AG showed NICE little girls, who didn't have cat fights as if it were ""normal""? I think AG missed a beautiful chance to work with some cute actresses and some breathtaking scenery and art. Instead of portraying the passions and internal complexities of a sweet, strong, endearing introverted girl, they portrayed the external cattiness, domination, and competition of middle school brats. The end ""art show"" is too polished for supposed kids' work. It's like they grafted a vapid, overly glitzy Disney channel-meets-Glee pop dance routine onto a stilted script and sold it as a heartwarming, edifying movie.

First on the plus side: As the mother of an almost fourth grader, I have to say this movie absolutely nails the girl drama. My daughter and her friends have all been through situations so similar to the one this movie centers around - two best friends grow apart due to differing interests (singing and art), and each is threatened by a new friendship the other has formed. This movie portrays this well, and the girls work through their differences in a positive way. Saige also works through an intense fear of speaking or appearing in front of others, and even if this isn't your daughter's fear, most girls this age experience some kind of self-consciousness, so they will be able to relate.The downside is that the production quality and acting seemed to be a step down from prior AG films, even though they have all been pretty cheesy (none are anywhere close to theater quality.) This bugged me, but didn't bug my kids at all (2 girls and a boy, ages 7-9) all of whom were riveted throughout and thought it was great.

She loves painting and horseback riding with her artsy, Bohemian grandmother, played by Jane Seymour.  Saige's fairly well to do parents play a secondary role in the movie but are loving and wise.Conflict ensues from girlfriend cattiness about who is whose best friend, and the message here, of course, is let's work together, appreciate each other, and not play games with favoritism.There's a fair amount of melodrama here, but the young actors are very good; the music is up and bouncy, the singing good and harmonious, and most of the shots just fine.  The upclose horseback scenes are too obviously set-up, and probably better left off; Jane Seymour, who I really like, came across odd and too poignant.  I kept sighing at whatever the next contrived conflict was, but... our girls watched intently and gave it a thumbs up.It's not their favorite.  My wife and I prefer the historic ones, e.g., Samantha or Felicity.  They show more fortitude and less whininess.  Right now our girls are into Josephina and Caroline.  They read the books, tell me lots of history info, and I'm impressed.I would note that the story apparently is changed here, and other reviewers complained about that- very typical when one reads a book first.  In summary, we liked the young actors, the music, singing, stage production, and the New Mexico balloon festival near the end.  I give it 3 1/2 stars, but don't want to complain too much because we really hope for more movies.",4,Quite Dramatic but with Good Spots,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1723,"['believe', '7', 'American', 'Girl', 'movies', 'overall', 'AG', 'girls', '6', '9', 'enjoyed', 'however', 'be', 'warned', 'lots', 'emotional', 'huff', 'puffiness.Saige', 'modern', 'girl', 'save', 'art', 'class', 'school', 'regain', 'close', 'friendship', 'painting', 'horseback', 'riding', 'artsy', 'Bohemian', 'grandmother', 'played', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Saige', 'fairly', 'well', 'do', 'parents', 'play', 'secondary', 'role', 'movie', 'are', 'loving', 'wise.Conflict', 'ensues', 'girlfriend', 'cattiness', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'message', 'here', 'course', 'let', 'work', 'together', 'appreciate', 'other', 'not', 'play', 'games', 'fair', 'amount', 'melodrama', 'here', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'up', 'bouncy', 'singing', 'good', 'harmonious', 'most', 'shots', 'just', 'fine', 'upclose', 'horseback', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'obviously', 'set-up', 'probably', 'better', 'left', 'off', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'really', 'came', 'odd', 'too', 'poignant', 'kept', 'sighing', 'next', 'contrived', 'conflict', 'was', 'girls', 'watched', 'intently', 'gave', 'thumbs', 'up.It', 'not', 'favorite', 'wife', 'prefer', 'historic', 'ones', 'e.g.', 'Samantha', 'Felicity', 'show', 'more', 'fortitude', 'less', 'whininess', 'Right', 'now', 'girls', 'are', 'Josephina', 'Caroline', 'read', 'books', 'tell', 'lots', 'history', 'info', ""'m"", 'impressed.I', 'would', 'note', 'story', 'apparently', 'changed', 'here', 'other', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'that-', 'very', 'typical', 'when', 'one', 'book', 'first', 'summary', 'liked', 'young', 'actors', 'music', 'singing', 'stage', 'production', 'New', 'Mexico', 'balloon', 'festival', 'end', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'hope', 'more', 'movies']",N/A
