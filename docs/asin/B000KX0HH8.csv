While not innovative, it sports some eye-popping pyrotechnics and chase scenes that don't give the audience a chance to catch its breath.  John Cena fans will likely be enthralled, especially since his character acquires some boxing and martial arts abilities to add to his wrestling repertoire.  (Nine lives don't hurt, either.)  Even the threads and riveting music draw our attention; both a modest update to 'Miami Vice,' (the TV series).  Seeming random at first, John Tritan (Cena) gets established as a sort of Iraq War Rambo whose prowess will undoubtedly help him save his domestic life.  Coming home, he finds his new job as a security guard dull, even if it gets him on the eleven o'clock news and another chance to come home to Kay (Kelly Carlson), his pretty young wife.  The plot is simple:  Jewel thieves, who score hideously for keeping a low-profile, have a show-down at a remote gas station where the military couple are also filling up for a trek to leave it all behind.  Cornered, they hijack their SUV with Kay left in tow.The draw of the film may be more conservative, for its gung ho military preface and a plot where the hero saves his wife.  There are drawbacks for everyone, though.  The acting overall is below a television par, and the dialogue is mostly flat.  Taking references meant to be funny from 'Deliverance,' 'Terminator,' and 'Freddy Krieger,' the screenwriters borrow heavily because they seldom have anything new to offer.  The female feistiness also seems token, like the characters were meant not to offend the audience with any vulnerable traits. (Undoubtedly, they are also drawing more ringside entertainment as well.)  An understandable draw for some, 'The Marine' will undoubtedly please no matter how predictable it may seem.

The film stars WWE wrestler John Cena in search of his wife who was kidnapped by a bunch of guys who weren't afraid to die, or kill anyone who unfortunately happened to get in their way.Anyone who enjoys action films with lots of hand fighting and lots of shooting (and I mean LOTS of these things) you will definitely find yourself enjoying the Marine.  It's nothing but total nonstop action for the last hour or so.  The movie clocks in at 1 hour and 23 minutes (even though some other places have said the time length was a bit longer, it's actually not).  The negative reviews are really strange to me- John Cena himself promoted the movie as nothing but an action film.  It doesn't pretend to be anything else.

Granted, Vince receives a nice sum of cash for Johnson's wrestling moniker to be used for movies, but that just isn't enough.And where Johnson has long-since passed up the 1980s-styled superhero genre, here comes Vince lumbering along in his powerwalk with his answer to The Rock, John Cena. Yes, that John Cena who was going to be a hip-hop star; until he proved that he has no hip and zero hop in his mic skills.But have a script comparable with Sylvester Stallone's ridiculous Rambo character - with Cena's mannerisms that could be termed as the nephew to the fictional tough-guy - blow all kinds of things up and Vince is in business.

Decent action like some of Arnold's early works (e.g. Commando and Red Heat), but not the best acting just like them. If you got a couple hours to blow and want to see a new action movie this will fit the bill. I suggest rental as this does not have alot of replayability in my book. Even my two young stepsons that were Marines weren't impressed. A good popcorn no brainer action movie. If you own any of Schwarzenegger's movies your time would be better spent watching them again. Don't get me wrong I really hope that Cena's career in movies will continue. With time I'm sure his acting will improve as Schwartzenegger's did. Let's face it the movie had potential if the acting was better or they threw in more comedy. About the only funny thing in the movie was when one of the bad guys says, ""He's like the Terminator"", when talking about the Marine, and then Robert Patrick, who played a Terminator in ""Terminator 2"" gives a steely glance at him. If this turns out to be the only movie Cena makes I have to vote for ""Chill Factor"" with Skeet Ulrich or ""Firestorm"" with Howie Long over this one. If they had added in more humor I think it would have worked better.Story Synopsis: A decorated Marine is discharged for disobeying orders for not leaving a man behind against orders. His first day on the job as a security guard he throws a man through the window and is fired.

He is struggling to adapt to civilian life and hold onto his relationship with his wife when she is abducted in a bank robbery.As his life crumbles and the police seem less interested in recovering his wife, he goes the vigilante route, tracking, interrogating and diving into dangerous situations, ultimately leading him to Las Vegas where he uncovers a large scale plot that is bigger than he or anyone could ever imagine.Other than the fact that my script is more complex and has better dialogue, the biggest difference between my script and THE MARINE is that the lead character in my script is REAL. A real, flesh and blood, human being Marine with vulnerabilities, emotions and he actually bleeds. He's a real person, like somebody you might know from your town who went to Iraq.While THE MARINE'S John Triton (John Cena) is bulletproof, explosion proof, dives through walls unscratched, hangs onto semi-trucks while it drives through buildings and despite the bombardment of boards, pipes and tin sheets, he rolls off and groans before jumping up and kicking more butt. Not to mention, I don't think a scene goes by that he doesn't remind everybody that he's a Marine and it's the only thing he knows. By the way, the tin sheets would have severed him, easily.Oh, and of course the name Triton is appropriate to refer to John Cena as a Greek God or the largest moon of Neptune.Ridiculous is an understatement.

The movie is not political in ANY way, but there is a fairly heroic brief starting episode in Iraq; I guess some don't like that.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (eg ""Commando"") or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results, but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies, there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example, Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture, however, and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it, too, for that matter.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cena,so I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer, then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander, and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it, not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off, he'd probably start shaking, but while things were going on, he didn't have time to be upset. Man, haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the star,but he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum, a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief, but most action movies do. It will grab you hard and keep you watching.",5,Terrific.

Unfortunately, there is way too much corny humor that fails to be funny, and hurts the seriousness of the film.  While Robert Patrick usually portrays a decent villain (specifically in Terminator 2), his character fails to come off as a tough one, thanks to the corny lines and attempt at humor the script forces him to serve.  The same goes for the rest of his gang in the film.The story doesn't get any simpler than the one in the Marine.  If you are looking for a movie with some plot and story, this is definetly not it.  Its so simple that the only reason the main charcaters - John Triton (John Cena) and his wife Kate become entangled with the bad guys is simply for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  John's wife is kidnapped about 1/3 of the way through the film, and the last 2/3 of the film is set looking for her and killing off the bad guys one by one.The Marine is basically action to the extreme, nothing more and nothing less.  There are unbelievable amounts of explosions in this one, a really good car chase, and some great Cena fist-pounding one on one's.  Cena even gets to fight Patrick in the end, which was a bit of a surprise, seeing that Patrick has obviously aged since his T2 days.  The fight actually is pretty even, thanks to numerous items to be used as weapons at Patrick's disposal.As an action movie, its great for the action scenes, but everything else is below par.  The villains are not impressive, and Cena is not used to what I think could be his fullest.  There is no story and the corny humor basically ruins everything.  The only funny line I found was when one of the guys says that Cena is like ""The Terminator"" in the presence of Robert Patrick.

He returns home to his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) and after not being able to adjust to his homelife so easliy, they take a vacation.  Unfortunally John ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time as he crosses paths with a group of jewel thieves at a gas station led by a killer named Rome (Robert Patrick) and after things don't go as planned, they go on the run & kidnap Kate as a hostage.  From there, John goes after the thieves to save his wife but encounter many obsticals along with the way while the theives have problems of their own such as not being to trust each other & Kate being tougher than she looks.This is one of those generic action movies where the plot itself was very simple & something the average person can understand. The acting isn't much as Cena had no previous acting experience before this role so his dialog is very limited but did do well & was believeable in his role.  They have good action scenes from a car chase to fist fights to tons of explosions. The most annoying thing here though was that they tried to add comedy to this movie which didn't work at all. For example, when the bad guys are in the jungle running from the police...that's not the time to start making jokes about ""rock candy"" & getting calls about their cable TV package eventhough I did get a chuckle as the priceless look Patrick gave after the ""he's like the Terminator"" line.While the DVD included both the unrated & theatrical versions of the movie, the DVD extras include all the WWE promotional features, footage of the World Premiere, various features on John Cena, and a ""Making Of"" featurette.

1035994,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000KX0HH8,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 2]","At the outset, it is prudent to state the obvious:  action movies are prone to having sequences that are not believable.  No matter how good (or bad) the action flick, this remains true.  However, some action movies push the envelope so far beyond the realm of believability that the movies become more like cartoons rather than films to be taken seriously.Such is the case with this present movie.  There are huge explosions in which people walk away unscathed.  A police car gets shot to pieces by about a thousand bullets, then flies off a cliff, yet our hero waltzes away as insouciantly as though he's returning from Walmart with a bag of groceries.The casting of the story is decent.  Robert Patrick is nice & sinister and as such plays a good bad guy, and there is a cute reference toTerminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD).  John Cena is certainly buffed up enough to be a credible action hero, but the problem is he has no acting prowess whatsoever.  He makes fellow wrestler-turned-actor The Rock look like Charleton Heston.By far & away the best performance belongs to Kelly Carlson.  It is clear that she has bona-fide acting talents, most of which are wasted in this farce of an action movie.  I do hope to see more of her in the future - much more!Beyond the believability aspect of the film, the pacing is pretty lousy.  The opening scene shows the hero doing heroic things on a mission against terrorists in Iraq.  I think the movie would have been much better had they stretched out this scene another 20 minutes, as it was actually interesting.  Instead, they stretch out the last 1/2 of the film, and things move along at a snail's pace.Also, it appears that the filmmakers were a bit torn on which direction they wanted the movie to go, ratings wise.  It had a few golden opportunities for un-contrived gratuitous nudity.  Unfortunately, they held back, ostensibly just for the PG-13 rating.

1035997,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000KX0HH8,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 1]","THE MARINEI have to admit that I have enjoyed all of the 7 or 8 or something like that WWE produced films, this one in particular. Sure some have been better then others but all have at least been entertaining, this one here would be in that category. I always liked John Cena especially when he was a heel, he has always been entertaining. So once WWE really wanted to get going with the movies I knew Cena would be starring in one. I am glad that the film did well enough at the box office for them to let him do another. I found this movie to be very enjoyable even though it is flawed.The movie is about John Triton an ex marine who is having a hard time adjusting to his new life as a civilian. After a mishap at a security guard job he took he and his wife decided to go on a trip to any were just to get away on vacation. It is on this trip that they run into some trouble at a gas station, it turns out that some people who are also there just robbed a diamond place and is on the run. When things go wrong Triton's wife is kidnapped by these guys and the chase is on. So the rest of the movie we are treated to an action filled adventure that pits one man's love for his wife against those who have a lust for money and power.The strong point of this film is obviously the ridiculous unbelievable action sequences, and I do mean unbelievable. Michell Gallagher and Alan McElroy did a decent job with the script basically just adding a few words to pages full of explosions and fist fights. For this, a WWE film that is just fine and I did not expect any thing else so it makes perfect sense. Director John Bonito shows that he has a talent for making a fun yet over the top action flick and he even makes Cena look good in his first acting gig, so credit to you sir. Director of photography David Eggby did a great job shooting this movie as the camera work is great, Executive producer Vince McMahon knows how to hire the right people. Every one behind the scenes did what a consider a good job given that this was supposed to be a WWE action movie, job well done.As far as the acting I think that while Cena has a way to go before he wins any Oscars he actually does a good job with this film, he has a natural charisma that carries over onto the screen. At times it looks like the performance is forced but over all he does a pretty good job in my opinion, I don't know why but I think he would be perfect in a comedy or a family comedy. Kelly Carlson is good as Cena's wife and brings a nice little charm to the film even though at times she gets rough with the other characters. Robert Patrick is great in the lead villain role with a sly humor to him, and his partner Abigail Bianca is just as good. In fact to be honest no one does a bad job in this film and in fact all of them do very well for this type of film.I liked this movie I thought it was a fun over the top action flick in the vain of 80's movies [like other reviews have said]; it is a good weekend/afternoon movie. A lot of people talk bad about this movie and John Cena in particular, but I liked it and Cena. I think if Cena is given time to develop as an actor I think he could actually be good. Hopefully he has developed more for the upcoming ""12 Rounds""; I will go see it keep up the WWE streak.

The movie pretty much portrays Cena in the action film genre as the WWE portrays him as a WWE superstar, invincible, unbeatable, and never get's injured.  The way bullets and explosions always seem to miss him make it seem like John Woo films (such as Hard Boiled)are realistic enough to be documentaries.  The 2 scenes I can easily point out as examples include when Cena is driving a car at the car the villians are driving, and 2 or 3 villians are unloading magazine after magazine rounds at the 'front' of the car, shattering the window, destroying the hood, and yet not one even scratches Cena who doesn't even try to dodge most of them (there's one part where he tries to put up a bullet proof vest, but that only lasts for a couple seconds, and you mine as well forget it ever happened when compared to the rest of the scene).  Then the part at the end fight (with Patrick) where Cena takes a sledgehammer to the gut at a full force impact, then continues the fight 15 seconds later like nothing happened.The movie is good as a one time popcorn flick with a few buddies, but even then it would still not be enjoyable since, like in 9 out of 10 Cena matches in the WWE, Cena wins, and the opponent(s) people are really cheering for and who are overall better than Cena (in this case, Patrick has better charisma and acting skills) lose.See it if you want, but I would put it on the 'pass' list.

Of course I always chose ""Just one of the guys"" because the chick playing the dude flashes the other dude the chick who's playing the dude is into (yeah, that movie is a little confusing) - but more importantly, brief nudity for the price of a PG-13.In any event, one evening the assistant manager of the store (who was later charged with murder... long story) brought in a film from Japan.  It featured the usual fare - people doing weird and wacky stuff.  However, during one vignette the camera focuses on the rear of a nude man.

McElroy is just awful (with good perception!), but as the film's story evolves the idea that this may just be a National Lampoon parody of action flicks - and if that is the case, it is truly a funny bit of entertainment - for a while.  Then it becomes obvious that the minimal storyline (ex-Marine's wife is abducted by diamond thieves and Marine elects to leave his one day 'security job' and take the initiative to capture his wife and strike down the bad guys in the swamps of North Carolina) is really just a matrix for staging as many pyrotechniques explosions as possible.  It does get tedious.The 'star' of this noisy, 'Unrated-for-destructive-violence' film is one John Cena, another wrestler from WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) being promoted by the director John Bonito to follow the path of The Rock: the difference is The Rock has done some classy acting and a range of roles that call for much more than flexing whereas Cena seems completely like a fish out of water who has yet to take a class in acting basics.  John Cena does have a splendid physique and perhaps that should have been more on camera.  Instead his 'John Triton' character, despite his tremendous physical advantages, gets beaten up by some pretty small and older guys, making us wonder why he has all that bulk and no fighting ability.The cast is good to adequate and once you realize this film is a parody, they seem even better delivering the corny lines they are given.

Smart business move.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (e.g. ""Commando"") or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results, but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies, there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example, Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture, however, and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it, too, for that matter.Don't be surprised to see the knife on the market soon, ala Rambo.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cena,so I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer, then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander, and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it, not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off, he'd probably start shaking, but while things were going on, he didn't have time to be upset. Man, haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the star,but he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum, a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief, but most action movies do.Recommended for fans of John Cena, the WWE, and Arnold and Rambo for that matter.GunnerGunner  December, 2007",5,Action Movie,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2047,"['Marine', 'DVDIt', 'interesting', 'see', 'Vince', 'McMahan', 'WWE', 'going', 'form', 'scripted', 'entertainment', 'i.e.', 'diversifying', 'Smart', 'business', 'move.This', 'fact', 'terrific', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'mold', 'Rambo', 'Schwarzenegger', 'films', 'e.g', 'Commando', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'series', 'violence', 'not', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'results', 'movie', 'where', 'female', 'stars', 'full-power', 'strikes', 'come', 'bouncing', 'back', 'reality', 'counted', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'girl-star', 'action', 'movies.The', 'violence', 'actually', 'toned', 'down', 'favor', 'action', 'example', 'Sgt', 'Triton', 'out', 'two', 'very', 'tough', 'villains', 'exciting', 'brawls', 'when', 'good', 'fighting', 'knife', 'Reality', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'much', 'bloodier', 'Not', 'much', 'gore', 'blood', 'picture', 'however', 'can', 'safely', 'take', 'pre-teen', 'teen', 'son', 'wife', 'liked', 'too', 'matter.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'knife', 'market', 'soon', 'Rambo.The', 'acting', 'was', 'top-drawer', 'context', 'plot', 'never', 'heard', 'John', 'Cena', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'biased', 'Triton', 'was', 'seen', 'first', 'front', 'commanding', 'officer', 'then', 'interacting', 'wife', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'emotionally', 'restrained', 'commander', 'strong', 'little', 'reflective', 'wife', 'was', 'Then', 'Marine', 'had', 'mission', 'had', 'complete', 'not', 'emote', 'burst', 'tears', 'adrenalin', 'high', 'wore', 'off', ""'d"", 'probably', 'start', 'shaking', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'be', 'upset', 'Man', 'have', ""n't"", 'sweetie-boys', 'who', 'have', 'panned', 'acting', 'ever', 'been', 'fight', 'never', 'heard', 'star', 'turned', 'very', 'believable', 'good', 'performance', 'part', 'excellent-looking', 'wife', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'nudity', 'movie', 'Unfortunately.In', 'sum', 'fine', 'example', 'type', 'highly', 'recommended', 'suspension', 'belief', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'do.Recommended', 'fans', 'John', 'Cena', 'WWE', 'Arnold', 'Rambo', 'matter.GunnerGunner', 'December', '2007']",N/A

1036006,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000KX0HH8,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","Pro wrestler John Cena flexes his acting muscles and discovers that, alas, when it comes to cinema, he's a 98 pound sissy. Having said that, THE MARINE is not the most abysmal of B-movies. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is: a modest actioner sponging off the quasi-hot commodity that is John Cena. I quite enjoyed the deliberate tongue-in-cheek, off-the-wall tone in some parts of the flick, which was a respite from all the uninspired swamp chasing and the mind-numbing, been there, done that heroics and explosions. Truth to tell, this picture is worth watching most for Robert Patrick's wiggy bad guy performance. Now this cat was having fun.The plot: Ex-sergeant John Triton (John Cena) may have been dishonorably discharged, but he still considers himself a marine at heart. Back in the civilian world, he becomes a rent-a-cop and, on his first day on the job, gets promptly sacked. As a consolation prize, he's talked into getting away from it all and ventures on a road trip with his beautiful wife Kate (Kelly Carlson). But this ends up being one of the most heinous of holidays ever as the Tritons bump into a gang of diamond thieves at a gas station, which then becomes the site of a shoot-out and results in Kate being kidnapped. What happens next is Triton channeling his inner marine, stolidly trekking thru the messy portions of South Carolina, and semper-fying the crap out of the hooligans and knuckleheads what done him wrong.Thespian newbie John Cena is earnest, I'll give him that, and must've graduated with honors from the School of Posing Heroically and Surviving Big Kabooms. No, Cena doesn't really distinguish himself from all the other would-be heir to Schwarzenegger's kingdom (the Rock, Vin Diesel, Jason Statham). In fact, he's not even as good as the action stars in the parentheses. If this was still the '90s, he'd be *ouch* Brian Bosworth. Now, maybe that last one's a bit too harsh. Cena is adequate, if torpid, in his first picture outing and even threatens to show niggling bits of potential. But, when one thug comments, ""This guy's like the Terminator."", well, no, he's not. Think what you will about Ah-nuld's acting, part of his box office clout was due to his self-deprecating sense of humor. In future films (should there be any), Cena needs to loosen up a bit. Or a lot. Even Jason Bourne thinks this guy's too impassive. On the positive side, John Cena is ripped like crazy. Even his Adam's apple is cut.So just how much fun was Robert Patrick having in this flick? He steals all the scenes, along with the diamonds, and delivers his lines with such obvious relish. His quirky and amusing take on his role is what kept me watching up until the end, where, as one reviewer pointed out, Cena administered a very dubious brand of CPR. Kelly Carlson also makes a good showing as the not-quite-hapless hostage and all around hottie, although she could've grieved just a bit more for her hubbie when he's first assumed dead over a cliff. I'm always up for a girl on girl brawl, and Kelly has several with equally tasty bad girl (naughty girl?) Abigail Bianca. By the way, it says something about the charisma-challenged Cena that even the henchmen end up being more interesting. One gets the feeling that, when not pulling bank heists, this motley crew of crooks puts in some massive down time in deep therapy. For real, they've got issues.Action sequences and stunts? So-so. With both having a wrestling background, it's only natural, I guess, that Cena and the Rock are studied under the same light. But it's not even close as Cena hands down pales in that comparison. The Rock just seems to be more kinetic and just more...aware. He knows how to play to his movie audience. Cena is still learning the Hollywood ropes. And it doesn't serve him at all that his fight scenes are boringly choreographed and that the car chase and explosions are run-of-the-mill. Was there even a real sense of jeopardy at any point in the film?Two and a half stars for THE MARINE, with a special shout out going to Robert Patrick for his just-a-wee-bit-mental performance.",3,"""I don't want to see any eye contact.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","I really hope the American Military didn't support this movie considering how things are going over there in order to recruit more bodies. If so that was a poor attempt. After watching this movie it left me quite speechless. War is entirely different, and should not be made glamorous for recruiting purposes.""The Marine"" is a very simple film with a few minor twists here and there. In the tradition of The Rock, John Cena has begun a movie career after gaining notoriety as a wrestler. Both wrestlers/actors are muscle bound former college football players. Whereas The Rock has now proven he can act in a variety of roles, Cena has just proven that he can do action. His role in ""The Marine"" is evidence that he may very well be successful in films, but he will need to find better material than this. The directing here is nothing special, but seeing this is John Bonito's first feature, I have nothing to support my cause as I have nothing more to base it on, but he is able to deliver a film that is very easy and even if Bonito got a little explosion happy.  The plot however, is pointless. Throughout this movie these imbecile thieves call attention to themselves every chance they get. After robbing a jewelry store, they don't just stroll away as no one outside knows what they did. They blow up a cop car. Why? I have no idea. One member of the group is prone to telling sad stories of his youth. Too often the camera lingers on the bad guys and then quickly gives us a shot of Cena running. Sure, Patrick is a bigger movie star than Cena, but this is Cena's movie. I really did not care about the bad guys other than how Cena is going to kick their [...].I will say that Cena has the build and look of an action hero in the grain of Jean-Claude Van Damme. He fits right in with the 'unstoppable 80's action hero mold.'  He is 90% muscle and 10% charm. He has few lines of dialogue but does well enough with what he has.  Robert Patrick hammed it up, but seemed to relish playing a wise-cracking psychotic murderer. No one else is worth mentioning, as it seems paychecks were just collected. Cena, who is also a rapper, had also been wearing military attire at his matches. No doubt he is doing so for publicity sake of this movie, which celebrates Marines as heroes which is great but nothing he can do is going to generate enough interest to make ""The Marine"" a success.",2,WWE really jack up the image of the Marines,1173398400,"03 9, 2007",2007,2383,"['really', 'hope', 'American', 'Military', 'did', ""n't"", 'support', 'movie', 'considering', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'there', 'order', 'recruit', 'more', 'bodies', 'was', 'poor', 'attempt', 'watching', 'movie', 'left', 'quite', 'speechless', 'War', 'entirely', 'different', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'glamorous', 'recruiting', 'purposes', 'Marine', 'very', 'simple', 'film', 'few', 'minor', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'tradition', 'Rock', 'John', 'Cena', 'begun', 'movie', 'career', 'gaining', 'notoriety', 'wrestler', 'wrestlers/actors', 'are', 'muscle', 'former', 'college', 'football', 'players', 'Rock', 'now', 'proven', 'can', 'act', 'variety', 'roles', 'Cena', 'just', 'proven', 'can', 'do', 'action', 'role', 'Marine', 'evidence', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'successful', 'films', 'will', 'need', 'find', 'better', 'material', 'directing', 'here', 'nothing', 'special', 'seeing', 'John', 'Bonito', 'first', 'feature', 'have', 'nothing', 'support', 'cause', 'have', 'nothing', 'more', 'base', 'able', 'deliver', 'film', 'very', 'easy', 'even', 'Bonito', 'got', 'little', 'explosion', 'happy', 'plot', 'however', 'pointless', 'movie', 'imbecile', 'thieves', 'call', 'attention', 'chance', 'get', 'robbing', 'jewelry', 'store', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'stroll', 'away', 'one', 'outside', 'what', 'did', 'blow', 'up', 'cop', 'car', 'Why', 'have', 'idea', 'One', 'member', 'group', 'prone', 'telling', 'sad', 'stories', 'youth', 'Too', 'often', 'camera', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', 'quickly', 'shot', 'Cena', 'running', 'Sure', 'Patrick', 'bigger', 'movie', 'star', 'Cena', 'Cena', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'bad', 'other', 'how', 'Cena', 'going', 'kick', '[', ']', '.I', 'will', 'say', 'Cena', 'build', 'look', 'action', 'hero', 'grain', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'right', ""'unstoppable"", '80', 'action', 'hero', 'mold', '90', '%', 'muscle', '10', '%', 'charm', 'few', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'well', 'enough', 'what', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'hammed', 'up', 'seemed', 'relish', 'playing', 'wise-cracking', 'psychotic', 'murderer', 'one', 'else', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'paychecks', 'were', 'just', 'collected', 'Cena', 'who', 'also', 'rapper', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'wearing', 'military', 'attire', 'matches', 'doubt', 'doing', 'so', 'publicity', 'sake', 'movie', 'Marines', 'heroes', 'great', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'going', 'generate', 'enough', 'interest', 'make', 'Marine', 'success']",N/A

The WWF gave us Stone Cold Steve Austin in THE CONDEMNED which was fun and Austin was great. But like THE MARINE, we see almost zero of the world famous torsoes of these super heroes. In THE CONDEMEND, Austin never takes off his shirt for one scene. And he has a body to die for. in THE MARINE, you've got about l5 seconds where we see Cena without his shirt and his body is amazing. But after that, he's fully covered.  The reason I worship these wrestling super stars is because they're so damned good looking and they don't mind strutting their stuff in a pair of speedoes.

He then gets fired from his security job after man handling a jerk. He then stresses to his friend that ""being a marine is what he did best"". Then on a trip with his wife she's taken hostage by jewel thieves. They carry big guns and blow stuff up but while acting like the kind of baffoons you'd see in a Home Alone movie. Robert Patrick is cool as the leader of the bad guys but he gets so many goofy lines that it's hard to take him seriously. I think he's a wasted actor. I mean his performance in Walk the Line and other serious roles show that. Plus no he did not kill the X-Files like many fans say. The show  trying to continue without Mulder killed the X-Files. He was pretty good in it.Anyway this movie doesn't know if it's an action thriller or action comedy. Plus I don't know why people praise the stunts. It's like wannabe Transporter or Transporter 2 type action. Plus with so many huge explosions you'd think that at least one person would die in them. But John Cena escapes every huge explosion without a mark on him.We also have seen how many movies where the heroe takes one bad guy at a time as one after another goes looking for him one after another. It worked a lot better for Die Hrad than it does for this film though. Now the good about the movie. It offers sexy women and although I'm not the biggest John Cena fan I can't say he's a bad action star. He has the right look even if he does basically give a one note performance. He's a marine and he makes sure we think of him as nothing but a marine. The script also makes sure we just think of him as nothing but a dangerous marine that loves his wife too.

Commercial director John Bonito helmed his first feature.  He keeps the pacing going well.  I had no clue who John Cena was, and wondered how he grabbed an action lead.  After seeing the DVD extras of his wrestling career, I understand how he was cast and remembered him from channel surfing.  His reactions are fairly wooden without many levels that we'd expect from a more experienced actor.  But he gets an ""A"" for effort and completed many of his own stunts.Robert Patrick who was the bad guy in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and had a small part in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers"" plays the bad guy Rome who engineers a bank heist.  Patrick looks like he's smart enough to plan the caper, but has a screw loose enough to result in the chaos and trail of bodies.Kelly Carlson from ""Nip & Tuck"" and many appearances on ""CSI"" plays Kate Triton, the wife who gets abducted.  The brief love scenes looked like both actors were having fun and convinced us of a romantic relationship, although there wasn't much more marital emotional depth beyond that.  She looked great.Her female nemesis is played by Abigail Bianca who portrays the trigger happy gang moll with expertise.  She excels at the action sequences.  My favorite shot in the film is when she is flung through glass and diamonds are scattered, some of them red with blood.The very best performance in the film, however, is one of the gang members named Bennett.  Creatively named, he is played by New Zealand actor Manu Bennett.  He seems to be the one in the gang with intelligence and emotional realism.  His fight scene with John Cena is excellent.  I was sad to see him bite the dust.Overall, the film was about what I expected.  Perhaps the acting wasn't quite as good as I'd anticipated.

1036029,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000KX0HH8,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 2]","THE MARINE proves yet again that an action movie needs to have the focus on the hero and his motivation.  When a film like this one has some truly outstanding fiery explosions to maintain a viewer's interest, that attention span will last only for as long as do the FX, and even with that there are diminishing returns.  John Cena, the WWE wrestler, is John Triton, an ex-Marine discharged from the Corps only because he disobeyed orders to save the lives of three fellow marines.  You would think his commanding officer would have understood.  He takes a job as a security officer and gets fired immediately, again for just doing his job.  The primary problem with THE MARINE is the expectation that one has in terms of why one sees this film.  I choose to see action movies that have a hard to achieve balance between the exploits of the action star and the believability of the plot.  Stallone had no problem doing that in any of his RAMBO films.  Cena has a long way to go to find this happy medium.Robert Patrick is the Bad Guy.  He mugs, makes unwelcome advances to Cena's wife, and generally conducts a criminal campaign on the fly.  You know that an action film is off kilter when the Bad Guy by default becomes the focus of interest.  Cena does little more than take beatings, give beatings, narrowly escape death in fiery car crashes, and scowl on cue.  If Cena has a future in acting, that future is probably in the ring as a wrestler.",2,Lots of Explosions But Still Dull,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,1446,"['MARINE', 'yet', 'again', 'action', 'movie', 'have', 'focus', 'hero', 'motivation', 'When', 'film', 'one', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'fiery', 'explosions', 'maintain', 'viewer', 'interest', 'attention', 'span', 'will', 'last', 'only', 'as', 'long', 'do', 'FX', 'even', 'are', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'John', 'Cena', 'WWE', 'wrestler', 'John', 'Triton', 'ex-Marine', 'discharged', 'Corps', 'only', 'disobeyed', 'orders', 'save', 'lives', 'three', 'fellow', 'marines', 'would', 'think', 'commanding', 'officer', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'job', 'security', 'officer', 'fired', 'immediately', 'again', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'primary', 'problem', 'MARINE', 'expectation', 'one', 'terms', 'why', 'one', 'film', 'choose', 'see', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'hard', 'achieve', 'balance', 'exploits', 'action', 'star', 'believability', 'plot', 'Stallone', 'had', 'problem', 'doing', 'RAMBO', 'films', 'Cena', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'find', 'happy', 'medium.Robert', 'Patrick', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'unwelcome', 'advances', 'Cena', 'wife', 'generally', 'criminal', 'campaign', 'fly', 'know', 'action', 'film', 'off', 'kilter', 'when', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'default', 'focus', 'interest', 'Cena', 'little', 'more', 'take', 'beatings', 'give', 'beatings', 'narrowly', 'escape', 'death', 'fiery', 'car', 'crashes', 'scowl', 'cue', 'Cena', 'future', 'acting', 'future', 'probably', 'ring', 'wrestler']",N/A
1036030,A3I7ZDO69JWRHH,B000KX0HH8,"Matthew Siebert ""~Author and Critic""","[2, 4]","This movie is almost a joke. The beginning starts off quite nicely with our ""Marine"" taking down 9 terrorist with a machine gun and hand-to-hand combat, without even being touched. The problem is later in the movie our same ""Marine"" is knocked down with a fire extinguisher, a branch, and a bar. Apparently terrorists trained in the military with machine guns are much less capable than a man with a fire extinguisher.Second, the ""Marine"" was knocked unconscious by both the fire extinguisher and tree branch yet being punched hard multiple times tied to a chair, he is left un-phased.Third, our ""Marine"" seems to get punched a lot for being such a skilled fighter. Even going up against hill billies he gets thrown through a table. Which also shows hill billies are skilled in hand to hand combat, a reality this movie taught me.Fourth, no one seems to care that our well respected ""Marine"" leaves a wounded cop unattended and steals a cop car. Throughout the movie he causes hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage without being reprimanded.Fifth, a good portion of the movie consist of  our ""Marine"" following people through the woods. That's it.... Wow.... Exciting.....Sixth, our marine jumps out of a flaming car over the edge of a cliff. 10 minutes later he is walking on land. Apparently it is left to our imagination how marines can fly.Seventh, When our ""Marine"" gives CPR its just pathetic. It looks funny to begin with because John Cena's arms are as big as his wifes body, but its even worse because he doesn't do CPR right to begin with.I'll be fair, there were good fight scenes.

I doubt I would have ever even rented it if I was back in the states (I'm in Iraq right now). This is going to be a short review for a pretty bad movie.Before you read my review, please take not that I'm an action movie fan. Whether it's a good one with a pretty decent plot or a fun one where you can drink and laugh to it with its whack out plot and crazy actions scenes. This movie just fell short of anything fun or good.The beginning intro with Cena rescuing some marine buddies was action packed but choreographed horribly. It looked incredibly fake. My hopes for a decent movie faded quickly.One of the cooler parts of the movie was a bank heist that was led by Rome (Robert Patrick better known as T1000 from T2). If it wasn't for the horrible direction and script, Patrick would've pulled this character off in a very cool way. This scene gave me hope for an ok movie to maybe get a little drunk to and laugh at the over the top action scenes.Then comes the kidnapping. It felt like 40 minutes of the movie we watched Cena run and jump through the woods trying to rescue his girl from the bad guys. Pretty annoying.Then we see the bad guys take refuge in an abandoned bar in the middle of a swamp that the police were JUST in. Honestly I believe there would've been cops that would've stayed there JUST in case this exact scenario would have happened...but whatever... I dont expect common sense to happen in action movies... especially bad ones like this. So we have Cena taking out bad guy after bad guy here till the oh so predictable twist of the movie happens.If you like explosions, trust me about this, you'll see massive ones every 25 minutes of the movie it seems like.Also Kate (Kelly Carlson from Nip/Tuck) played a pretty good part for such a bad role. What really makes me irritated about her part though was that she gave the bad guys SUCH hell that there is no way they wouldn't have just killed her to get rid of the crap she was putting them through. Like I said earlier, I dont mind cheese in bad action movies, but this was just driving me nuts.I gave it 2 stars mainly for Robert Patrick. Like I said earlier, he played his part as well as he could for the craptastic script.

1036034,A2ZQ7E617I2SCK,B000KX0HH8,"Michael S. Lareaux ""belcatar""","[0, 0]","Take the naive and testosterone-fueled ramblings of an adolescent male, add a few million dollars and some talented effects people, sprinkle in a few professional wrestlers and movie actors, and you have ""The Marine,"" a silly, nonsensical piece of bullet-porn that starts off ridiculous and devolves from there.John Cena plays John Triton, a Marine who is booted from his beloved Corps because he disobeyed orders and rescued a few of his fellow Devil Dogs from certain death at the hands of some standard-issue Al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist-type bad guys. Now, you would think that after getting kicked out of the Marines for doing his job, he'd think twice about it the next time he got caught up in a difficult situation. Then again, if you're the type of person who does a lot of thinking, you'd be watching a different movie.John Triton also doesn't do a lot of thinking. After getting a job as a security guard with his slightly obese, non-sexually-threatening friend, he gets fired for-you guessed it-doing his job.He and his wife Kate(played by Kelly Carlson) decide that getting fired twice in rapid succession for doing his job isn't the end of the world, and that John just needs some time away. They set out for the mountains of South Carolina, apparently unconcerned about things like bills and taxes and gas money.Meanwhile, a crew of hardened diamond thieves do their job, and once again, everyone gets upset. Not terribly upset, mind you; despite the cold-blooded murder of a diamond-store attendant, the police only see fit to send a single cruiser, which the bad guys dispatch with the aid of a rocket launcher. (If you want to see this kind of thing done right, watch ""Heat"".)The bad guys and our vacationing, unemployed heroes finally cross paths at a gas station somewhere in rural South Carolina. Apparently, the police were sufficiently cowed by the demise of their two officers, and didn't put much effort into investigating, because the officer who conveniently pulls in to the gas station to move the plot along begins chatting up the bad guys. Naturally, the bad guys take offense to friendly cops, and the cops are soon riddled with bullets. The gas station suffers a similar fate. No self-respecting adolescent-male fantasy is complete without large explosions, and ""The Marine"" delivers in this category.Realizing they'll never make it to act three without a car, they take John's, and as a bonus, they take his wife as well. He gives chase in a police car, and the audience is treated to action not seen since John Schneider and Tom Wopat zoomed around Hazard County in the General Lee.The rest of the movie is one long chase through the swampy South Carolina wilderness. John Cena slow-motion-runs, choke-slams and suplexes his way though a bevy of bad-guys. Along the way, the audience is treated to rural stereotypes and a light-hearted reference to child sexual abuse.If you can fog a mirror, you can probably guess the ending of this film.Now that we have the story out of the way, let's talk about the actors. Robert Patrick chews the scenery as the head bad guy, and he does the best he can with what he had to work with. Kelly Carlson seems to be having the time of her life regardless of what's happening around her, which isn't entirely her fault, as the script didn't really call for much else.John Cena does a decent job as Triton, who seems to have a superhuman resistance to damage that would be the envy of actual Marines. Acting isn't the easiest thing in the world, and his career is only beginning, so he gets a free pass.

1036035,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000KX0HH8,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 3]","At least once a year, along comes a film that's so wrapped up in hype and  promises of greatness that you know it can't be as good as its makers would want you to believe. The distinctive model of this for 2006 was ""The Marine"", the second feature of the newly-founded WWE Films, starring ex world champion John Cena. To state plainly, this is one godawful movie: a lame and poorly-written publicity project by Vince McMahon's sports entertainment empire that can't even be redeemed by placing it under the action/adventure genre. As a fan of both the WWE and action films, I was blown away by how uninteresting and unexciting the filmmakers could make this $23 million picture, considering that it was co-written by the same fellow who penned ""Rapid Fire"", ""Spawn"", and ""Wrong Turn"", and directed by a producer of WWE - a company that is built upon fast-paced action and excitement.Let's start with the focus of this debacle - the star, John Cena. Though I feel apathetic about him as a wrestler, John Cena is most definitely not up to being an action hero: lacking the talent of Sylvester Stallone and Harrison Ford, the personality of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the moves of Jean-Claude Van Dam, the humour of Jackie Chan, and even the sincerity of character of Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren, Cena looks woefully out of place and confused amidst the explosions, gunfights, and combat fatigues, and doesn't even have any decent one-liners to his credit to make up for his lack of presence. Essentially, he's as bland of an action star as they get.Mind you, this wouldn't really be that much of a problem if the film featured a strong enough supporting cast to make up for the star's deficiencies, but even here ""The Marine"" falls flat: Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2"") as the film's wannabe-crazy villain and Kelly Carlson (""Player 5150"") as Cena's spunky kidnapped wife are not really feeling the script at any point, and neither are the half-dozen or so supporting villains - including Anthony Ray Parker (""The Matrix"") as a token black guy who alludes to being molested at summer camp for the sake of humour - most of whom kill each other before Cena can even prove himself by beating them up.Even if we were to completely ignore the shoddy acting, there is little in either the storyline (Cena is a discharged marine whose wife is kidnapped by jewel thieves) or the action sequences to hold our attention. While the film nicely portrays the depression and ""lost"" feeling of a soldier who has just returned home from combat, and the ""man-saving-wife"" premise holds some lingering potential, the vast majority of the plot descends quickly into mundaneness, and focuses mainly on the group of villains stabbing eachother in the back and the pursuing Cena having to fight off hillbillies. The action offers absolutely nothing new or innovative: though the chase scene with Cena in the police cruiser is cool, it's a dim highlight amidst mediocrity that features standard gunfights, no martial arts, and more explosions that one expects can occur in the swamps of South Carolina.In short, ""The Marine"" does not raise the bar at all above fellow panned WWE Films ""See No Evil"" and ""The Condemned"". If they want to be taken seriously in the realm of cinema, the writers of WWE will have to stop relying on clich&eacute;-driven pictures and name-recognition to be successful. After all, Cena's flick failed to make back its budget, as did Steve Austin's ""The Condemned"".

A huge muscleman marine is told to wait for the rest of the soldiers on a mission.  He says ""not enough time"" and charges in to blow things up.  Next scene he is being discharged and has to go find a job as a security guard.  This is all in the first 2 minutes of the movie.  The thing that really bothered me about the movie was that everything that went on really had no point and did not make a difference later in the film.  That isn't the only thing they weren't able to complete, not by a long shot.  The bad guys have this big black guy on their side and he is not unfunny, they just don't give him anything funny to say.  I seriously think that he didn't complete a single joke.  In fact, the liquid metal guy from Terminator 2 stars as the main bad guy and they even throw in a reference to that and it was the only joke they actually completed.  I thought that it was the least bad part of the movie.Now the reason I went to see this was becasue I was told it had great fights.  The shootouts were nice to look at and the explosions became so repetitious I almost fell asleep, but the fights were once again just the same old I hit you and then you hit me style.

1036048,A3BKIVVRFP7X6M,B000KX0HH8,R.C. Collins,"[2, 2]","The Marine is a film about a marine that has just been discharged and is back home with his wife. When she's kidnapped by the bad guys, the game is on. It's an action movie and I think most people can spot what this movie is going to be like from that description. So if you're not a person that enjoys action movies like Rambo or Commando then I can safely say that you won't enjoy this film. It's still a paint-by-numbers affair so it's doubtful you'd suddenly find yourself enjoying this type of film.But I am someone who enjoys action movies like Rambo and Commando. So I waited till I found myself in the right mood to watch an action romp, and I stuck this DVD in. The movie starts out with some promise. After John Cena's character is discharged from the military, he takes a job as a security guard. The scene that followed that was fairly entertaining - with Cena throwing around his weight. While that scene is entertaining, it is also meant to show that Cena's character is miserable outside of marine life. This hints at some inner turmoil that is then left behind completely and never again brought up in the film.Robert Patrick does a great job as the bad guy. I thought he was very good. I did not care for his henchmen as they didn't seem to bring anything to the table. Likewise, John Cena is not an actor. He doesn't need to be in an action movie if the plot is compelling but it's really not. There aren't any memorable action scenes that stick out in my mind as I reflect back so all I am recalling is the awkward delivery that John Cena had. I also didn't care for his character's wife; who was very attractive but had a quality about her that said there was nothing going on upstairs. The pair is not a couple who are developed characters; the wife especially comes off as an arrogant shrew and so as a viewer, I'm not invested in the film when she is kidnapped.All in all, this movie would have been a better film as a focus on Robert Patrick's jewelery store heist and escape. That was much more interesting than The Marine and his walk through a swamp.

John plays a Marine who gets kicked out of the Corps after defying orders to save the lives of some Marines. I wont even get into that rats nest of crap. So he is discharged from the Marines and is trying to start working a civilian job. While on a road trip with his wife some people who robbed a jewelery store and happened to stop at the same gas station end up kidnapping his wife and begins his outrageously stupid and ill scripted pursuit. Fact is John was able to track his targets through the marsh and swamp while quite often they were on a road. The thought process that i have would be is that they could take any back road/dirt road or anything that connect to the main road they would be gone and he would be heading in the completely wrong direction. However somehow he is always able to find the bad guys. My biggest complain is that it is a movie about a Marine and he never really uses a gun, he takes them and never uses them. I think the person who wrote it doesn't realize that every Marine is a rifleman and i cannot think of one who wouldn't use a gun to protect his wife.

However i bought a movie titled MARINE i fully expect there to be FIREFIGHTS and shooting. That is what really irritates me along with the pathetic acting is that it doesn't make sense.

Joe cartoon. Yeah, there are plot holes, logic bombs and more cheesy dialogue than Kraft could put in a dozen commercials, but this doesn't stop the movie from being a lot of fun to watch.WWE wrestling superstar John Cena plays John Triton, a U.S. Marine who has been scapegoated and dishonorably discharged for disobeying an order from commanding officers and is making an adjustment to civilian life with his hot wife. He gets a job at a security firm where...he gets fired for disobeying an order. After this mishap he and his wife decide to go away where at a gas station they run afoul of some diamond smugglers who kill a cop and kidnap take his wife for a hostage so they can make their getaway. In the quest to get her back, Triton goes through car chases, explosions, and death defying scenarios. It's best not to take these too seriously; this is the kind of action movie where you turn your brain off and enjoy the show.Despite the logic holes, The Marine reminds me of the kind of old-fashioned action movie I used to watch back in the late 1980's-1990's like American Ninja or Ninja III: The Domination (WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD YET!) Low budget movies that were full of over the top stunts, car chases, big explosions and clich&eacute; lines from the heroes. The kind of movie you turn your brain off for two hours and unwind with. The kind of movies I'd watch on a Saturday afternoon when I had nothing else to doJohn Cena is fun to watch as Triton, he has great charisma and a strong screen presence that keeps you watching in spite of the campy script. He shows the potential to be a solid B-action star in the not unlike Michael Dudikoff or Michael Pare. Kelly Carson is good as Triton's wife. She does the best she can with the weak script she's given. Robert Patrick takes his character way over the top The rest of the cast here is fodder for Triton to kill or beat up.If you catch this on TV one Saturday afternoon, after you've done the shopping or are coming back from a late night date don't miss it.

That is unfortunate as it is a storyline that could have proven to be a great movie if it were written better.It features John Triton (John Cena) as a former Marine who was kicked out of the Corps for disobeying an order.  Of course, had he obeyed the order, many American lives would have been lost.  Nevertheless, he was scapegoated and discharged.One day he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are at a convenience store when a group of thugs kills a cop.  They then take Kate hostage, which proves to be a very poor decision for them as John is a commando the makes Rambo look like a wimp in comparison.  The bad guys are about to have a very bad day indeed.This really could have been a great show, but there are way too many extreme fires/explosions that get Triton.

WWE Studios is dedicated to expanding the careers of those with acting talent, from the ring to the big screen.  As a champion, John Cena brought an imposing physical presence, rugged good looks, and a certain flair for the dramatic, to his wrestling, and music endeavors.  The Marine (2006), is a vehicle designed to showcase Cena's talents, and he acquits himself well enough, in his big screen debut, an explosive and exciting, but still rather unremarkable action thriller.Cena is ex-Marine John Triton, discharged from the service for disobeying orders while on a mission in Iraq.  Returning stateside, Triton finds civilian life a little rough, and decides to get away from it all for a while, heading into the South Carolina mountains, with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson, Nip/Tuck).At a roadside gas station, a gang of thieves on the run, ambush a couple of highway patrolmen.  With their vehicle damaged, the criminals, led by Rome (Robert Patrick), and his lieutenant Angela (Abigail Bianca), slug John, kidnap Kate, and hit the road in Triton's SUV.  Triton gives chase in the patrol car, in what is the action highlight of the first half of the film.  The gang is left travelling on foot through the swamp, with Triton on their trail.  The group make their way to a safe house.  Triton arrives and takes out some of the gang, but Rome sets off and explosion, and makes his escape.  Triton again has to dodge a fireball, and after borrowing a police speedboat, finally catches up to Rome.  Up until the finish, Cena's fight scenes are fairly routine, but the battle between Cena and Patrick finally generates a few sparks.Although the story is rather simplistic and uncomplicated, The Marine does entertain, and provides the requisite opportunities for John Cena to flex his muscles, and exercise his fledgling acting skills.  Robert Patrick (The Unit, Terminator 2) is a known talent, and brings some humor and class to the production, and he has enough physical stature to take on Cena.  Kelly Carlson (who should be in more films) and Australian Abigail Bianca, mix it up, in a couple of spirited fights.Working with director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), the acting potential that is shown here, is more fully realized in Cena's next film, 12 Rounds (2009).  Though he is still chasing after a girl, Cena's character is more well rounded, and the film features more of Cena doing his thing, behind the wheel of a vehicle.",3,"John Cena's film debut, is a serviceable though unremarkable journey . . .",1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,2524,"['might', 'say', 'professional', 'wrestlers', 'are', 'already', 'actors', 'extent', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'dedicated', 'expanding', 'careers', 'acting', 'talent', 'ring', 'big', 'screen', 'champion', 'John', 'Cena', 'brought', 'imposing', 'physical', 'presence', 'rugged', 'good', 'looks', 'certain', 'flair', 'dramatic', 'wrestling', 'music', 'endeavors', 'Marine', '2006', 'vehicle', 'designed', 'showcase', 'Cena', 'talents', 'well', 'enough', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'explosive', 'exciting', 'still', 'rather', 'unremarkable', 'action', 'thriller.Cena', 'ex-Marine', 'John', 'Triton', 'discharged', 'service', 'disobeying', 'orders', 'mission', 'Iraq', 'Returning', 'stateside', 'Triton', 'civilian', 'life', 'little', 'rough', 'get', 'away', 'while', 'heading', 'South', 'Carolina', 'mountains', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Kelly', 'Carlson', 'Nip/Tuck', 'roadside', 'gas', 'station', 'gang', 'thieves', 'run', 'couple', 'highway', 'patrolmen', 'vehicle', 'damaged', 'criminals', 'led', 'Rome', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'lieutenant', 'Angela', 'Abigail', 'Bianca', 'slug', 'John', 'kidnap', 'Kate', 'hit', 'road', 'Triton', 'SUV', 'Triton', 'chase', 'patrol', 'car', 'what', 'action', 'highlight', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'gang', 'left', 'travelling', 'foot', 'swamp', 'Triton', 'trail', 'group', 'make', 'way', 'safe', 'house', 'Triton', 'out', 'gang', 'Rome', 'explosion', 'escape', 'Triton', 'again', 'dodge', 'fireball', 'borrowing', 'police', 'speedboat', 'finally', 'up', 'Rome', 'Up', 'finish', 'Cena', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'routine', 'battle', 'Cena', 'Patrick', 'finally', 'few', 'story', 'rather', 'simplistic', 'uncomplicated', 'Marine', 'entertain', 'requisite', 'opportunities', 'John', 'Cena', 'flex', 'muscles', 'exercise', 'fledgling', 'acting', 'skills', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Unit', 'Terminator', '2', 'known', 'talent', 'humor', 'class', 'production', 'enough', 'physical', 'stature', 'take', 'Cena', 'Kelly', 'Carlson', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'films', 'Australian', 'Abigail', 'Bianca', 'mix', 'up', 'couple', 'spirited', 'fights.Working', 'director', 'Renny', 'Harlin', 'Cliffhanger', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'acting', 'potential', 'shown', 'here', 'more', 'fully', 'realized', 'Cena', 'next', 'film', '12', 'Rounds', '2009', 'still', 'chasing', 'girl', 'Cena', 'character', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'film', 'more', 'Cena', 'doing', 'thing', 'wheel', 'vehicle']",N/A

If you remember this film, our hero is a retired elite commando, single-handedly saves the kidnapped daughter, and kills all the bad guys. The story is incredible, I know, but fun nonetheless.In ""The Marine"" WWE's John Cena plays that hero John Triton, a marine discharged for disobeying the direct orders. The difference here is that the hero has to rescue his wife kidnapped by the diamond robbers and the gangs' leader is played by Robert Patrick. And watching ""Commando"" is more fun.Frankly I don't care the wooden acting of the cast and the predicable (and unrealistic) story as long as the film provides good actions. Actually I found John Cena is not that bad as critics say, and Kelly Carlson as his wife did a fine job. Also ""The Marine"" has one car chases with good stunt and one funny one-liner about Robert Patrick's career making role.But things start to look silly when these actions are drawn-out. There are scenes big explosions, but they only help lower the film's tension as the poorly-written storyline and choppy editing make it clear that none of these poses a danger to the protagonist who can easily survive and go to the next set-piece.

1036072,A1JNKGC3C6OVGQ,B000KX0HH8,"Ujjwal Dey ""2write""","[2, 2]","Firstly, let me tell you that if you are an elite critic and watched this movie, ask yourself why. Do you even like the action-movie genre? No? Then don't waste our time by writing reviews about stuff you don't enjoy. We like it here and we like Hollywood. So astalavistababy.For all WWE Fans and those who have come to see John Cena blow things up by more than just his fist - this is an awesome action flick. I too came to see this movie because I am a fan of WWF now known as WWE and because I admire John Cena as a person and not just as what we see him do inside the squared ring.The first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie needs to be passed over. To be forgiven. It is not the best start to an action movie. And this is an out and out thriller of an action movie. But then Robert Patrick shows up and everything rocks and everything is cool again. Yes, I came to see Cena and got bowled over by Robert Patrick. Patrick carries this movie. I would say he saved the movie. Cena is great. He is our hero. And we cheer for him throughout the movie as he gets beat while trying to rescue his dear wife. But you can't help fall for Robert Patrick. He waltzes in all bad-a$$ and mean. He is ultra, uber-cool. He makes the badguy role come alive and give meaning to the whole story. As in any story, for the hero to be a hero, you need a strong adversary. We get that in the form of a team of criminals led by Robert Patrick.The action is non-stop. As soon as the villain has done his first job in the movie - the action keeps up the tempo and we get big gunfights and bigger explosions. The crazy black dude routine is well played here by a henchman of Patrick. I was a bit disappointed with the truth behind the ""rock candy story"" - they should have made it as big as it sounded. But there is plenty of more fun in the movie. Some dark humour and Cena is incredible as he chases down the bad guys in the mandatory car chase sequence and then on in the swamps. This is thrilling from there till the very end. Some good hand-to-hand fights. Cena gets punished and he triumphs. The deviation with the 2 other crooks in the same swamp thinking Cena is a cop looking for them is also brilliant turn of events. More action. More a$$-kicking. The scenes with the explosion are very well shot.The two big ones with Cena at the petrol pump explosion and him at the shack in the swamp exploding are incredibly well captured. You could feel Cena getting the fury of the fire. Awesome stuff. And Patrick is unstoppable too. He is determined and he has the wife as a leverage and hostage. There is the essential bad girl accompanying the villain, Patrick. She does a great job, better I think than the actress who plays Cena's wife. In all I would rate high the casting as the team of Patrick is well picked bunch of actors doing what they do best. These bad guys are worth cheering for.Cena of course makes it to the climax. An epic one it is, involving a truck, a motorboat, explosions, fistfights, splattering of blood and the suspense of whether Cena's wife will survive this ordeal or not.Watch this one and make sure you reload the popcorn.",5,"Action, Thrills and some good FUN!!!",1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,3129,"['Firstly', 'let', 'tell', 'are', 'elite', 'critic', 'watched', 'movie', 'ask', 'why', 'Do', 'even', 'action-movie', 'genre', 'No', 'Then', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'writing', 'reviews', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'here', 'like', 'Hollywood', 'So', 'WWE', 'Fans', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'John', 'Cena', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'more', 'just', 'fist', 'awesome', 'action', 'flick', 'too', 'came', 'see', 'movie', 'am', 'fan', 'WWF', 'now', 'WWE', 'admire', 'John', 'Cena', 'person', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'see', 'do', 'squared', 'ring.The', 'first', '5', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'be', 'passed', 'be', 'forgiven', 'not', 'best', 'start', 'action', 'movie', 'out', 'thriller', 'action', 'movie', 'then', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'up', 'everything', 'rocks', 'everything', 'cool', 'again', 'Yes', 'came', 'see', 'Cena', 'got', 'bowled', 'over', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Patrick', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'saved', 'movie', 'Cena', 'great', 'hero', 'cheer', 'movie', 'beat', 'trying', 'rescue', 'dear', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'bad-a', 'mean', 'ultra', 'uber-cool', 'badguy', 'role', 'come', 'alive', 'give', 'meaning', 'whole', 'story', 'story', 'hero', 'be', 'hero', 'need', 'strong', 'adversary', 'get', 'form', 'team', 'criminals', 'led', 'Robert', 'Patrick.The', 'action', 'non-stop', 'As', 'soon', 'villain', 'done', 'first', 'job', 'movie', 'action', 'up', 'tempo', 'get', 'big', 'gunfights', 'bigger', 'explosions', 'crazy', 'black', 'dude', 'routine', 'well', 'played', 'here', 'henchman', 'Patrick', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'truth', 'rock', 'candy', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'as', 'big', 'sounded', 'plenty', 'more', 'fun', 'movie', 'dark', 'humour', 'Cena', 'incredible', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'mandatory', 'car', 'chase', 'sequence', 'then', 'swamps', 'thrilling', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'good', 'hand-to-hand', 'fights', 'Cena', 'punished', 'triumphs', 'deviation', '2', 'other', 'crooks', 'same', 'swamp', 'thinking', 'Cena', 'cop', 'looking', 'also', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'events', 'More', 'action', 'More', '-kicking', 'scenes', 'explosion', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'shot.The', 'two', 'big', 'ones', 'Cena', 'petrol', 'pump', 'explosion', 'shack', 'swamp', 'exploding', 'are', 'incredibly', 'well', 'captured', 'could', 'feel', 'Cena', 'getting', 'fury', 'fire', 'Awesome', 'stuff', 'Patrick', 'unstoppable', 'too', 'determined', 'wife', 'leverage', 'hostage', 'essential', 'bad', 'girl', 'accompanying', 'villain', 'Patrick', 'great', 'job', 'better', 'think', 'actress', 'who', 'Cena', 'wife', 'would', 'rate', 'high', 'casting', 'team', 'Patrick', 'well', 'picked', 'bunch', 'actors', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'worth', 'cheering', 'for.Cena', 'course', 'climax', 'epic', 'one', 'involving', 'truck', 'motorboat', 'explosions', 'fistfights', 'splattering', 'blood', 'suspense', 'Cena', 'wife', 'will', 'survive', 'ordeal', 'not.Watch', 'one', 'make', 'sure', 'reload', 'popcorn']",N/A
