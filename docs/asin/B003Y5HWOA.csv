Jeff Bridges is commanding in his role as John Katz, but I favor Lois Blair as the feisty and much needed anchor who holds the script to its turning point. Some reviewers bemoan the lack of family relationship ""details,"" but, I found that the script gave us just as much info as we needed to know about Katz's shaky marriage. The point of the story is Man and Dog. My thanks to the scriptwriters for NOT getting gooey and overwrought with the details of marital strife: Bridges' acting succinctly conveyed the message. I am buying this DVD as a birthday gift for my doggie-loving brother, who is about the same age as Jon Katz",5,Broken Hearts and Wagging Tails,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,853,"['gravitated', 'DVD', 'local', 'rental', 'shop', 'not', 'only', 'anything', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'look', 'story', 'line', 'damaged', 'man/soul', 'finding', 'way', 'back', 'life', 'love', 'damaged', 'soul/dog', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'commanding', 'role', 'John', 'Katz', 'favor', 'Lois', 'Blair', 'feisty', 'much', 'needed', 'anchor', 'who', 'script', 'turning', 'point', 'reviewers', 'bemoan', 'lack', 'family', 'relationship', 'details', 'found', 'script', 'gave', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'info', 'needed', 'know', 'Katz', 'shaky', 'marriage', 'point', 'story', 'Man', 'Dog', 'thanks', 'scriptwriters', 'NOT', 'getting', 'gooey', 'overwrought', 'details', 'marital', 'strife', 'Bridges', 'acting', 'succinctly', 'conveyed', 'message', 'am', 'buying', 'DVD', 'birthday', 'gift', 'doggie-loving', 'brother', 'who', 'same', 'age', 'Jon', 'Katz']",N/A

Not from a training point of view but as an example of the many challenges the dogs offer. So often, TV and movies show training highlights that make it appear fast and easy to train a dog. A breakthrough can take a moment or years and most people would have given up on Devon quickly. I laughed out loud every time Jeff Bridges had trouble with Devon. They embarrass us, humiliate us and humble us. ""You can't live here unless you change,"" are the same words that came out of my mouth more than once. I actually read the book a few years after I got my first Border Collie. Eventually, that dog ended up with my parents who are home all the time. Although I won't read the Katz book about Orson, I really liked his writing style and was not disappointed in the changes when A Dog Year was made into a movie. Katz is flawed but I was happy to see him speak briefly in the extra feature. I always had a mental image of Michael Moore in my head when picturing Katz. He doesn't come off as a know it all and his openness of sharing his experiences (good and bad) has invited the experts to fling a lot of single stars at his ratings. The honesty that Katz projects could prevent someone from entering into a casual commitment when trying to adopt a dog made out of pure electricity.

1375858,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Y5HWOA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 18]","As Jeff Bridges, to me, has always been one of the most underrated actors of his period--I'm glad to see him finally getting the recognition he deserves.  His recent Oscar win for ""Crazy Heart"" is just a capper on his previous four nominations which spanned nearly 40 years with ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"" ""Starman,"" and ""The Contender.""  Aside from ""Picture Show,"" these films only hint at Bridges' range and I've always maintained that his work in ""Tucker: The Man And His Dream,"" ""The Fisher King,"" and the incredible ""Fearless"" (and dare I mention The Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"") were the true height of acting genius.  It's only natural that Bridges has settled into somewhat of a comfort zone and ""A Dog Year"" (which garnered him an Emmy nomination) is a film he could do in his sleep.  Playing a disheveled and obstinate man in a mid-life crisis has been Bridges' go-to role for several years now and it's on display again in ""A Dog Year.""Based on the popular Jon Katz memoir, ""A Dog Year"" follows Bridges as he chronicles a life in turmoil.  A writer who can't write, Bridges also has anger issues.  His wife has left him and he seems somewhat isolated and estranged from others in his life.  When he is contacted about a dog in need, he inexplicably agrees to see if he can help.  Needless to say that this border collie named Devon is a problematic creature.  Wreaking havoc, though in believable and not overly comedic ways, Devon forces Bridges to reevaluate quite a bit in his life.  Bridges is not particularly nice and Devon's antics aren't particularly endearing--so there is a refreshing quality to their interactions and it's not as cutesy as you might fear.  Before you know it, Bridges is on the road with Devon and learning about life and love again from his new pet and the wise strangers he encounters.In truth, there isn't much that's surprising about ""A Dog Year.""  Some elements and plot points are rather vaguely defined.  I, for one, wished for more insight into the family dynamic.  I wanted more meat with my story!  But it is what it is.  And what we're left with is a pleasant experience.  You can see happiness, understanding, acceptance, and love coming around the bend--can't you?  Devon must learn from Bridges--but Bridges can learn so much from Devon too!  Slight and enjoyable, what am I going to say that's too negative?  If you love Bridges and dogs (and really who doesn't?), there are worse ways to spend eighty minutes.  About 3 1/2 stars, but I'll round up because I'm an animal lover.

1375859,A387BD735MI50R,B003Y5HWOA,R. Schultz,"[1, 2]","This movie isn't for those who demand a lot of action in their films. Not much happens here. The rescue dog that Jeff Bridges, (playing real-life author and dog owner Jon Katz) tries to domesticate, isn't nearly as rambunctious as the dog in ""Marley and Me."" This HBO production has more of the low-key quality of an ""After-School Special.""It tries to inject some drama into the proceedings by having a dog trainer advise Katz that he's very angry - implying that his anger is rubbing off on the dog, making it in turn wild and uncontrollable. However the film doesn't prove its case on this score. Katz is actually shown being more patient with the dog than I think 90% of even the most ardent animal lovers would be.But Jeff Bridges brings his usual appeal to the film. As in ""Crazy Heart"" and ""True Grit,"" he's someone stuck at a crossroads - with one road leading to the life of a gruff loner, and the other road leading to some involvement in the world of people. Part of the Katz character's writer's block is no doubt the result of being suspended between these two life-paths. As active and amok as the adopted dog Devon tends to be, he actually provides Katz with a kind of caesura. The dog is a distraction, giving Katz time to figure out which path he wants to take. You can probably figure out which path that will be.This movie is more like a journal translated onto the big screen than a plot-driven excitement. But it's a gentle charmer that the whole family can enjoy.

1375860,A2UYGOYMV73826,B003Y5HWOA,Rushmore,"[1, 3]","If you have read Jon Katz's books you will know the real story of Devon/Orson.  If I remember correctly, the dog was originally named Devon.  Katz wondered if the dog associated the sound of his name with abuse to come, so he renamed him Orson.  This was a somewhat successful tactic.This movie tells part of a longer and very controversial story.  Jon Katz has said repeatedly that Orson saved his life.  I couldn't really appreciate that until I saw this movie in which Jeff Bridges as Katz, obviously depressed, devotes himself to figuring out the puzzle of Devon.  As another reviewer has said, this is probably a role that Bridges could do in his sleep, but that does not make it any less riveting to watch.The dog who plays Devon is nothing short of magnificent.  He turned in an Emmy-worthy acting job on his own.  Kudos to the trainers on this film.  It is all the more heartbreaking to know the fate of the real Devon/Orson, but (spoiler alert) at least this movie ends happily.The movie is relatively slow-moving and has a low-budget feel.  Not a lot happens.  Man is a depressed writer who can't write.  Wife and daughter are worried.  Man rescues a crazy Border Collie, almost sends him back but ends up devoting himself to trying to rehabilitate the dog.  Man and dog spend some time in a ramshackle house in the country.  Both make some progress.  The End.I also want to mention the other two dogs who played Stanley and Julius, the elder Labs in Katz's life at the time Devon joined them.  Both dogs are wonderful and provide delightful contrast to Devon's manic gyrations.If you are troubled about Devon/Orson's fate, I highly recommend Katz's books.  He mentions Orson in just about every book. He has a new book coming out this month called Going Home which deals with grieving for your pets.  He is still working out his relationship with this dog years after his death.  He doesn't sugarcoat the truth or pull any punches, but his love for all his animals and especially Orson shines through in every word.",4,4 stars for Jeff Bridges and the dog,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,2026,"['have', 'read', 'Jon', 'Katz', 'books', 'will', 'know', 'real', 'story', 'Devon/Orson', 'remember', 'correctly', 'dog', 'was', 'originally', 'named', 'Devon', 'Katz', 'wondered', 'dog', 'associated', 'sound', 'name', 'abuse', 'come', 'renamed', 'Orson', 'was', 'somewhat', 'successful', 'tactic.This', 'movie', 'tells', 'part', 'longer', 'very', 'controversial', 'story', 'Jon', 'Katz', 'said', 'repeatedly', 'Orson', 'saved', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'appreciate', 'saw', 'movie', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Katz', 'obviously', 'depressed', 'figuring', 'out', 'puzzle', 'Devon', 'reviewer', 'said', 'probably', 'role', 'Bridges', 'could', 'do', 'sleep', 'not', 'make', 'less', 'riveting', 'watch.The', 'dog', 'who', 'Devon', 'nothing', 'short', 'magnificent', 'turned', 'Emmy-worthy', 'acting', 'job', 'own', 'Kudos', 'trainers', 'film', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'know', 'fate', 'real', 'Devon/Orson', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'least', 'movie', 'happily.The', 'movie', 'relatively', 'slow-moving', 'low-budget', 'feel', 'Not', 'lot', 'Man', 'depressed', 'writer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'Wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'worried', 'Man', 'crazy', 'Border', 'Collie', 'almost', 'back', 'up', 'devoting', 'trying', 'rehabilitate', 'dog', 'Man', 'dog', 'spend', 'time', 'ramshackle', 'house', 'country', 'make', 'progress', 'End.I', 'also', 'want', 'mention', 'other', 'two', 'dogs', 'who', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Julius', 'elder', 'Labs', 'Katz', 'life', 'time', 'Devon', 'joined', 'dogs', 'are', 'wonderful', 'provide', 'delightful', 'contrast', 'Devon', 'manic', 'gyrations.If', 'are', 'troubled', 'Devon/Orson', 'fate', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Katz', 'books', 'Orson', 'just', 'book', 'new', 'book', 'coming', 'out', 'month', 'called', 'Going', 'Home', 'grieving', 'pets', 'still', 'working', 'out', 'relationship', 'dog', 'years', 'death', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'truth', 'pull', 'punches', 'love', 'animals', 'especially', 'Orson', 'shines', 'word']",N/A
