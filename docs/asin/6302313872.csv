307243,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6302313872,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","Danny DeVito versus Gregory Peck? A little like David and Goliath, except DeVito is actually the Goliath, using other people's money. He's a corporate liquidator, buying up companies that have undervalued stock, in this case because one division loses money, New England Wire & Cable, while all the others make money. DeVito wants to buy it up and close the Wire & Cable. Peck, as the patriarch of the corporation, is also the son of the founder. He's concerned that if the factory closes, a lot of people will be out of work and the small town in which the Wire & Cable works is located will become economically depressed.You know, I didn't know who to cheer in this one, except perhaps Penelope Miller, who is the attorney hired to help the Wire & Cable survive the takeover attempt. She is apparently the step-daughter of Peck's character, and she negotiates with DeVito using all her feminine wiles. She gives him a big come-on, dresses in very provocative outfits to meet with him, and he does the predictable: falls in love with her, and even asks her to marry him.But the whole takeover issue is put to a vote at the stockholder's meeting, and both Peck and DeVito give brilliant performances offering their sides of the issue. No, I won't tell you who wins. OK, yes I will: ultimately, the Japanese. In any corporate raid situation, ultimately the Japanese win. It's the way of the modern world.I didn't understand it very well, but it was entertaining and amusing, if occasionally aggravating. And I want a solid gold slinky like DeVito has!

Danny Devito is incredibly  perfect for the part of the corporate raider, and how he relishes playing  the part!  Sad to see Gregory Peck for the most part reduced to a stubborn  old man, although there are flashes of the great actor he once was.  Ah,  but doesn't Penelope Ann Miller do a neat Marilyn Monroe imitation talking  on the phone to our predatory take over artist?The fine script, based on  a play by Jerry Sterner, and directed by the consummate professional,  Norman Jewison, is studded with cynical Wall Street wisdom, not the least  of which is, it is always nice to play with &quot;other people's  money&quot; (gambler's lingo for being ahead of the game).  Naturally this  Hollywood presentation is a little shallow, but what a pleasant fantasy for  short, old, balding day traders on a holiday.Of course there is the  delicate question of how to play ""Danny Devito gets Penelope Ann Miller.""  Are we going to see him pull her into his arms and kiss her, thereby  sweeping her off her feet?  I don't think so.  However, confidence (and  mass bucks) are very sexy, and so there is a certain plausibility to this  amusing romantic comedy.While watching I was reminded that Miller is one  of the great beauties of the contemporary screen, but I was saddened to  realize how short her span....  Alas.

307248,AMKCZHXDOS2RN,6302313872,E. Spencer Garrett IV,"[14, 14]","There is no nudity in this movie but there are some vaguely sexual discussions.  Even some adults might miss the true points being made but you may want to consider that before allowing children to see OPM.That said, this is the best business movie I have ever come across.  When I first saw it in the theater I was all for Gregory Peck's character until DeVito's speech at the end which is truly thought provoking.  In teaching business management at the University of Southern Mississippi, I have my students watch the whole thing at the beginning of the semester to acquaint them with the notion that those who have the goal of making money are not all bad.  For some reason, even though they want to be in business, my students too often think of running a business and making money as grubby, nasty chores performed by evil people.  The characters in OPM force them to examine those beliefs.Other reviewers have made the point that this a funny movie and it truly is.  The humor is probably better appreciated by adults than children since it is not of the slapstick kind but rather uses plays on words.While the characters in OPM are somewhat one-dimensional, what I enjoyed is that they are always true to themselves.  When offered a million dollars by Piper Laurie's character to go away , DeVito responds ""It is not enough.""  She was being true to her goals of minimizing conflict in her company and he was being true to his goals of maximizing his wealth.  When asked why, he gives an answer that shows that he doesn't accept the idea that he is the bad guy in this drama.I particularly appreciated the movie not making DeVito's character out to be a totally bad guy.  That is a real failing of most movies coming out of Hollywood.  Other reviewers have talked about how his relationship with Penelope Ann Miller's character shows his humanity but I think people should take note of his relationship with his chauffeur and his secretary and their loyalty to him.  He makes use of his reputation as a tough guy to serve his business needs but there is much more to the man.All together, this is truly a great movie.  It amazes me that it took so long for it to come out on DVD since it has all the stars in the world (DeVito, Peck, Miller, Laurie, Stockwell, etc.)",5,OPM- Used in my Business Management classes...,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,2273,"['nudity', 'movie', 'are', 'vaguely', 'sexual', 'discussions', 'Even', 'adults', 'might', 'miss', 'true', 'points', 'being', 'made', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'allowing', 'children', 'see', 'OPM.That', 'said', 'best', 'business', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'theater', 'was', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'character', 'DeVito', 'speech', 'end', 'truly', 'thought', 'provoking', 'teaching', 'business', 'management', 'University', 'Southern', 'Mississippi', 'have', 'students', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'beginning', 'semester', 'acquaint', 'notion', 'who', 'have', 'goal', 'making', 'money', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'reason', 'even', 'want', 'be', 'business', 'students', 'too', 'often', 'think', 'running', 'business', 'making', 'money', 'grubby', 'nasty', 'chores', 'performed', 'evil', 'people', 'characters', 'OPM', 'force', 'examine', 'beliefs.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'funny', 'movie', 'truly', 'humor', 'probably', 'better', 'appreciated', 'adults', 'children', 'not', 'slapstick', 'kind', 'rather', 'plays', 'characters', 'OPM', 'are', 'somewhat', 'one-dimensional', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'always', 'true', 'When', 'offered', 'million', 'dollars', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'character', 'go', 'away', 'DeVito', 'not', 'enough', 'was', 'being', 'true', 'goals', 'minimizing', 'conflict', 'company', 'was', 'being', 'true', 'goals', 'maximizing', 'wealth', 'When', 'asked', 'why', 'answer', ""n't"", 'accept', 'idea', 'bad', 'guy', 'drama.I', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'not', 'making', 'DeVito', 'character', 'be', 'totally', 'bad', 'guy', 'real', 'failing', 'most', 'movies', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'talked', 'how', 'relationship', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'character', 'humanity', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'take', 'note', 'relationship', 'chauffeur', 'secretary', 'loyalty', 'use', 'reputation', 'tough', 'guy', 'serve', 'business', 'needs', 'much', 'more', 'man.All', 'together', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'stars', 'world', 'DeVito', 'Peck', 'Miller', 'Laurie', 'Stockwell', 'etc']",N/A

It's funny, and goes against form in showing the ""heartless"" capitalist as a moral, likable person. The proxy battle scene is one of my favorites in all of film, with Gregory Peck and Devito forcefully advocating different views on the purpose of a company.I will go against popular opinion and say it is strange that Devito's character falls madly in love with Penelope Miller's character. She does a lousy job playing a sexy street-smart lawyer, and all the revealing dresses in the world couldn't cover that ineptitude. Thus the 4 star review.The DVD is a pleasant surprise. The wide screen reveals what the cinematographer was going for with the short, stocky Devito strutting across the screen. It's both comic and adds to the character seeing a little man who walks like a giant.

There are no extra features.I wondered if this was ever coming out on DVD, and why not? Look at the cast - Danny DeVito, Penelope Ann Miller, Gregory Peck, Piper Laurie, Dean Stockwell. It did well at the box office, but then....nothing. Well it's finally here.I agree that the match-up of Danny DeVito and Penelope Ann Miller seems a bit odd at the beginning, but as the movie unfolds, you begin to understand the attraction. Danny's attraction to Penelope's character is for obvious reasons, but her's are NOT so obvious.  However, as she gets to know him she finds that, in spite of his appearance, he is not only rich and powerful, but also a smart, funny, romantic, caring person who also provides her with the most powerful aphrodisiac of all - he admits he's madly in love with her. We all find THAT very attractive in another person, don't we? Still, this movie doesn't provide that usual ""guy gets the girl"" ending, but leaves it hanging as a possibility, since Penelope's character, in spite of her attraction, is still somewhat put off - both by his appearance, and his profession.This is a great movie about the ""merger and acquisition"" frenzy of the 80's, and has absolutely stellar acting and writing. I also like that Penelope's character doesn't mind using her obvious physical assets to her advantage. After all, if you've got the smarts to back it up, then why not? All's fair, and so on.

307265,A1P5HSM15HWNWV,6302313872,"Steve ""xtcr7""","[13, 16]","Remember the good old 80s, when Ronald Reagan ruled the roost?  The stock market was part of the zeitgeist at large, but in a pre-CNBC way; it was there in the news, but Mainstreet America wasn't as plugged into it then as she is today.  Consider that stocks can be bought and sold over the web with the click of a mouse- being coddled by a broker was so old news, so old economy.  Information is online in reams and ready to be accessed at a moment's notice, one didn't have to peruse a bunch of pulpy pages to figure out what the return-on-equity of Disney calculated to.  It's against this backdrop that OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY finds itself, a competent and interesting piece of film which presents two sides to the hostile-takeover-and-subsequent-liquidation scenario.Danny DeVito portrays the odious Lawrence Garfield, affectionately christened with the salubrious sobriquet ""Larry The Liquidator.""  Garfield loves one thing better than his beloved doughnut pastries: woefully undervalued companies.  When his computer screen filters out the latest hot prospect, New England Wire & Cable, his shark-like senses smell the blood immediately and he sets out for a meeting with its owner, Andrew Jorgenson, played to great curmudgeonly effect by Gregory Peck.Jorgenson is a fatherly figure to his workers, respected and revered almost to the point of deification, one would imagine.  When Garfield points out that his company's stock price is out of whack in relation to its book value, Jorgenson is staunch in his reply: get out, and take your Wall-Street greed with you.  But everyone knows that the little guy isn't going to be cowed so easily; he's as feisty and fanatic as he is sly and devious.  They know he'll find a way to bulldoze over Jorgenson and his twenty percent ownership.Enter Penelope Ann Miller's character, Kate Sullivan, a firecracker counselor who is as sexy as she is intelligent.  Sullivan is the estranged stepdaughter of Jorgenson; antagonistic though the pair is, she is nevertheless willing to help him keep his business out of the hands of Garfield.  Only problem is, Garfield is having difficulty keeping his hands off Ms. Sullivan.  As detestable as the situation is, she decides to exert a bit of sexual leverage over him to facilitate achievement of her goals.  The film eventually climaxes with a raucous shareholder's meeting and a pernicious proxy fight.OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY serves as an excellent cinematic snapshot of that specific period of time when buzzphrases like ""trickle-down economics"" and ""Star Wars defense system"" were constantly uttered in media outlets and watercoolers alike.  It's not a film which relies on an overabundance of clever camera moves or convoluted plot devices; instead, it builds from a foundation of useful thespian techniques and dexterously crafted dialogue (the source for the screenplay is a stage production, so it is obvious why the lines would be so precise).  DeVito, Miller, and Peck excel in their roles, making them come alive with a conservative approach; the viewer never feels as if he/she is being suffocated by cloying histrionics.  The triangle formed by these three characters is a dynamic one, much more expanisve than its one hundred eighty degrees.DeVito in particular requires a spotlight look; it isn't so much that he's invented any novel blueprints toward his discipline- instead, one realizes upon post-viewing analysis that he fit the part like the proverbial glove.  Garfield's vitriolic, killer-instinct demeanor proved a suitable substrate for the actor to react with; in the end, a more than successful catalysis is the result.  But it wasn't just the acerbic tendencies he gelled with.  Garfield possesses a healthy quanta of vulnerability, as he is also a lonely loner, looking for love and companionship; DeVito triumphed with this aspect as well (think of his outing in THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN, with Billy Crystal).  One strategy which would have added depth to the film would have been an ongoing voiceover for Garfield; his insights would have enriched the overall narrative and injected it with a unique energy.The movie, above all, presents a balanced take on a fascinating issue: is the hostile corporate takeover an evil act?  Although one could argue that a subtextual ideology is present- in fact, in many ways, the script can be considered a yuletide cautionary tale written by Dickens sans the spectral spirits- it can easily be dismissed; there is never a feeling that the viewer is being spoonfed one propaganda or another.  The soliloquies rendered by Jorgenson and Garfield at the end form the killer application of the piece.  They deliver two diverse, diametrically opposed filters on the same subject, and both participants challenge all of us to come up with a sane, informed opinion regarding it.  Jorgenson isn't right necessarily, and neither is Garfield; as we begin to squint the lenses of our collective mental faculties, we see that the black and white sides of the arguments converge into a tenuous gradient of grays.  Both are idealists, and perhaps it is accurate to say that whatever set of ideals fit the mitigating circumstances of the time will win out in the end.OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY is a film worthy of attention.  It won't change a person's life, certainly, but it will provide good entertainment value and an educational look at corporate dealings.  Even in these post-80s times, it is still more than relevant; in fact, it will always be relevant.  After all, every generation has its own Chrylser bailout, LTCM collapse, and Enron debacle; you can most definitely invest your money in that.",4,Provides a great return on invested
