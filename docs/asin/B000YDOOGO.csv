1119151,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000YDOOGO,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Am I the only one who thought about the Elton John classic ""Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"" upon noticing the movie title?  Come on, great song but... this isn't about the memorable period of Elton's classic years and how you should pick up at least 10 of his albums.  This is about an action-packed thriller starring Christian Slater.It's about a gang of no good thugs living next door to a good-hearted loving couple.  The two neighbors obviously despise each other, which you will quickly discover when you see a certain scene involving a bike.One day, a gang of crooked DEA agents (Christian Slater's character) realizes that the thugs took a bag of money, so one night the DEA agents invade the home with guns a blazing.  Just about everyone dies... however the boyfriend of the generous neighbor happens to walk by after the killing, notices the money on the floor, grabs his wife, and they both take off and start a new life together away from all the crime, violence and depression they're forced to endure on a daily basis.However, not everyone dies in that gun shooting, and Christian Slater's character goes out and searches for the thieves.I like the storyline because of the fact it features two dishonest gangs along with the neighbor who takes the money.  Basically it's a lose/lose situation for everyone involved, however you will probably find yourself pulling for the good-hearted neighbor characters when you witness their deplorable living conditions and sincere attempts to search for happiness together.The movie is extremely heavy on the action and guns, so if you're a huge action buff, you won't be disappointed with anything taking place on screen.  It's a constant ""run from the bad guys"" type suspense, and it's a pretty darn good one.  I'm pretty shocked this movie never got the recognition I believe it deserves.

1119155,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000YDOOGO,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 1]","Director Keith Samples has worked extensively in television, directing shows as diverse as ""Reba,"" ""Everwood,"" ""Felicity"" & ""Roswell.""  He keeps the action moving here.  The best part of the film for me was Brian Geraghty's performance as Duke, a military veteran who can't seem to get his life put together.  For some reason, he lives in a high-crime area that puts him in direct confrontation with the gangs.  Geraghty had worked previously inJarhead (Widescreen Edition).  As Duke, he's head over heels in love with Amber.  Amber is played by Jenna Dewan who was the lead inStep Up (Widescreen Edition).  She does a good job as the young woman who is kind to children and works hard as a grocery checkout clerk.  Duke encounters dirty drug agent Pollen played by Christian Slater.  Slater plays this character with little of his characteristic swagger.  We know his bad guy is a bad guy from first frame to last.  Tara Summers from TV's ""Boston Legal"" has a cameo as Detective Alice Sands who confronts Pollen and birddogs him to uncover the dirt.  By the end, I cared about the lovers and wanted to see them have a future.  Overall, while Geraghty's performance is the bright spot, this is an average film good for an evening's romantic/action entertainment.

1119156,A3G4BFD7FN8VF1,B000YDOOGO,Marvin Powell,"[9, 10]","*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ***Love Lies Bleeding is an action thriller starring Brian Geraghty as Duke, Christian Slater as Pollen, and the talented Jenna Dewan as Amber.Love Lies Bleeding is a straight-to-DVD movie that is actually, surprisingly, better than most straight-to-DVD movies I've ever seen. While far from original or unpredictable, it does with a movie is supposed to do, and that's entertain. Duke and Amber are a poor, New Mexico couple trying to make some decent cash. And when you have the white boy trying to get work amongst the illegal immigrant day laborers, you KNOW they're poor! Duke and Amber make a believable poor couple, and this is only added by the filthy no-good gangsters next door.Sick of harassing him and pretty Amber, Duke buys a gun (which you'd think he would've already had in such a neighborhood) and goes to take care of business. However, Detective Pollen (Slater) beats him to it, as the gangsters have stolen some of his stolen evidence cash, roughly a quarter million dollars, from one of his cowardly street lackeys. And just to note, this is probably the FAKEST money I've ever seen. Even if you couldn't get one real $100 bill to put over top the fake money, then at least, as the director, don't zoom in on it, geez! After a shootout, Duke checks in on the situation to see everyone shot up and dead, except the injured Pollen. Duke sees the bag full of money and makes a run for it with the cash. Now, why he didn't just kill the half-dead Pollen, who just happens to be the only witness, right then and there, I have no idea, but then I guess we wouldn't have a movie.Duke and Amber, with a quarter million dollars, head East out of New Mexico (yes, EAST, not West towards California) and buy a new car, on their way to a better life, a dream of theirs that is repeatedly hammered into the audience throughout the movie. Pollen goes on the run for them. Duke and Amber get married and spend their honeymoon at an off-road casino resort. While there on their honeymoon, they come across a thieving room service guy, and we're lead into a chase and fight-out in the casino hotel's kitchen. Eventually, Pollen and his goons catch up to Amber and she just manages to escape with her life. Amber runs into a guard in the stairwell and once he's not convinced Pollen is a legit cop, he gets shot and Amber runs off, again. Amber eventually reunites with Duke the reclaimed money. Duke and Amber devise a plan to outwit the clueless local police and escape, separately, and Duke decides to hide the cash in the bushes while they're on the run. Probably not the brightest idea when the casino is swarming with cops, everywhere. Did he really think they wouldn't at least, search the place?While hiding out, Amber realizes that their dream of a happy family life won't be possible with dirty money, so convinces Duke to give the money back to Pollen in exchange of him letting them off the hook. Meanwhile, local detective Alice Sands questions Pollen, and not being an idiot like every other cop in this movie, comes to the conclusion that he isn't on the up and up. Pollen manages to convince everyone else though, that this poor New Mexico couple with no previous criminal record, are both drug peddlers. When Duke and Amber call Pollen about the deal (don't ask me how they got his number), Sands and her partner decide to follow them all to find . Duke heads back to the casino, only to find the money gone, and comes to the conclusion that the gardener who just quit has taken it. Duke heads to the guy's place and grabs the money back at gunpoint, warning him that dirty money never comes without a price.Duke and Amber head to the rendezvous site, in order to give back the money and live their life in peace, but Pollen isn't having any of it. He has his henchman beat up and tie up Amber before Pollen starts to have his way with her. But a distraction from her allows for a final showdown with Duke and Pollen. In the aftermath of everything, Detective Sands comes in, and learns the truth behind everything, including the real story behind the corrupt cop, Pollen.Now, this being a straight-to-DVD video, I was expecting this movie to be cheap and poorly made, however, it ended up being better than I thought. The filming and production quality is all top-notch. The movie itself, does what a movie is supposed to do and that's entertain you.The acting isn't great, but everyone except for Geraghty as Duke, gives off a convincing, acceptable performance. In fact, Duke comes off as a one-dimension character and I was more than convinced that this was the actor's very first movie, however, it isn't. All we get from Duke is that he's a hot-headed, romantic dreamer, of sorts, who makes rash and often, stupid decisions. But I guess it's enough to work for this movie. Jenna Dewan as Amber and Christian Slater as Pollen are probably the best two in this, as they both bring a little bit of depth (not that much, but some) to their characters. Amber gets beat up A LOT in this movie. In fact, on four separate occasions. By Hispanic thugs, by Pollen's henchman, and by Pollen, twice.  Despite her beatings though, Dewan as Amber is at least willing to fight back in her multiple, near-rape situations, which is more than most movie damsels-in-distress do. But seriously, Amber takes a real beating in this, and you have to give Jenna Dewan some credit for taking most of it herself, and not using a stunt double. Christian Slater's character may not have as much depth, but he is good in at least making you hate him. This guy is a real prick, that's for sure. I just wish we had a reason or inkling on just WHY he's so evil, rather than him just being a corrupt, bad cop just for the sake of it.The characters aren't really that memorable, but the actors at least give their best efforts in making them likable. Duke may be the short-tempered devoted boyfriend, but I think someone other than Geraghty could've added a little more depth and believability to him, especially considering he's the lead. His character sort of reminds me of John Cena's character in ""The Marine,"" as his only purpose is to play the ""tough, but vulnerable"" hero. The plot isn't all that original, but as is the case in Hollywood, it's not what story you're telling, but HOW you tell it, and this is told much better than I was anticipating. It could've easily come in 3rd place at the box office had the studio decided to release it in theaters.The movie is overall entertaining and worth seeing, even if it's not perfect. I liked it and think others will find it enjoyable as well, despite its flaws. If you want a cheap thriller, with lots of good action and suspense, this satisfies, even if you probably could do better with Slater's earlier work with ""True Romance.""",4,"Not perfect or even
