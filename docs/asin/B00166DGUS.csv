1152276,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00166DGUS,David Von Pein,"[1, 2]","""JOHN F. KENNEDY: YEARS OF LIGHTNING, DAY OF DRUMS"", narrated with great style and class by actor Gregory Peck, is a wonderful documentary film that tells the story of the all-too-short Presidency of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was inaugurated as the 35th President of the United States on January 20, 1961, and died at the hands of an assassin just 1,037 days later.Featuring a remarkable musical score that words alone cannot possibly do complete justice to, ""Years Of Lightning, Day Of Drums"" is, in this reviewer's opinion, one of the very best films or documentaries ever created about President Kennedy.The 85-minute film was made in 1964, very shortly after JFK's November 1963 assassination. It was produced by the United States Information Agency for release in foreign countries. But the film was so popular, it was finally released in U.S. theaters (through an act of Congress, no less) on April 10, 1966.Also included in the movie is an abundance of rarely-seen color film footage of President Kennedy's funeral processions through the streets of Washington, D.C., on November 24 and 25, 1963.""Years Of Lightning"" was written and directed by Bruce Herschensohn, who also composed the film's stellar and poignant original musical score as well. It was practically a one-man Herschensohn show. And a well-crafted show it is, too.David Von PeinJanuary 2009January 2011",5,"A REMARKABLE FILM, WITH A BRILLIANT MUSIC SCORE",1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1378,"['JOHN', 'F.', 'KENNEDY', 'YEARS', 'LIGHTNING', 'DAY', 'OF', 'DRUMS', 'narrated', 'great', 'style', 'class', 'actor', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'film', 'story', 'all-too-short', 'Presidency', 'John', 'Fitzgerald', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'was', 'inaugurated', '35th', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'January', '20', '1961', 'died', 'hands', 'assassin', 'just', '1,037', 'days', 'later.Featuring', 'remarkable', 'musical', 'score', 'words', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'do', 'complete', 'justice', 'Years', 'Lightning', 'Day', 'Drums', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'created', 'President', 'Kennedy.The', '85-minute', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1964', 'very', 'shortly', 'JFK', 'November', '1963', 'assassination', 'was', 'produced', 'United', 'States', 'Information', 'Agency', 'release', 'foreign', 'countries', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'U.S.', 'theaters', 'act', 'Congress', 'no', 'less', 'April', '10', '1966.Also', 'included', 'movie', 'abundance', 'rarely-seen', 'color', 'film', 'footage', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'funeral', 'processions', 'streets', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'November', '24', '25', '1963', 'Years', 'Lightning', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Bruce', 'Herschensohn', 'who', 'also', 'composed', 'film', 'stellar', 'poignant', 'original', 'musical', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'practically', 'one-man', 'Herschensohn', 'show', 'well-crafted', 'show', 'too.David', 'Von', 'PeinJanuary', '2009January', '2011']","John F Kennedy - Years of Lightning, Day of Drums on DVD"

My original VHS copy was in danger of breaking and I wanted the DVD to become a lasting medium to use well into the future.  Unfortunately, the video quality of the DVD is not good.  The color is faded and the brightness is very poor...in fact, the DVD seems more like a black and white program than a full-color one.  The details are often lost in the darkness of the DVD.

1152279,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B00166DGUS,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[13, 13]","December 1964 - The Agency's first feature-length documentary Years of Lightning, Day of Drums is distributed in 117 countries. Public Law 89-274 allowed the film to be shown in the United States. The film won an Academy Award as Best Documentary. In this poetic propaganda film by the USIA made for foreign audiences, Kennedy is the American hero who had ""years of lightning"" before his life was ended and remembered in a ""day of drums"" funeral. The film is structured around the ""six faces"" of the New Frontier: the Peace Corps, conquest of space, Alliance for Progress, civil rights, freedom, peace. In 1961 ""upon the floating globe called the world there were three billion people and most of them were not happy or free or at peace."" There were loud and visible problems of "" fires burning in the Congo"" and a ""foreign-dictated government in Cuba"" and ""starvation for one-third of the world."" John Kennedy is portrayed as one of the uncommon men in the history of the world who thought not of problems but of ""the invisible and silent"" solutions. Featured in this film are his speech at White House to the first Peace Corps volunteers, his journey to Costa Rica -- ""viva Costa Rica, viva Costa Rica, mucha gracias"" -- the Freedom Riders mass meeting Aug. 28 in Washington DC, the Alan Shephard award ceremony, the Berlin crisis --""if war begins, it begins in Moscow, not Berlin"" -- his speech at the Berlin Wall --""Let them come to Berlin"" -- and his trip to Ireland. Interspersed between each of these segments are scenes from the 1963 funeral. ""History will pick up its cold pen and book, and write in chronological order the events of the day with the date and time and the city. But history will be wrong, for there wasn't one date, or time, or city."" His life and death symbolized the ""invisible and silent"" hopes and dreams of the world.",5,A MUST SEE  FOR ALL HISTORIANS!,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,1848,"['December', '1964', 'Agency', 'first', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'Years', 'Lightning', 'Day', 'Drums', 'distributed', '117', 'countries', 'Public', 'Law', '89-274', 'allowed', 'film', 'be', 'shown', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'poetic', 'propaganda', 'film', 'USIA', 'made', 'foreign', 'audiences', 'Kennedy', 'American', 'hero', 'who', 'had', 'years', 'lightning', 'life', 'was', 'ended', 'remembered', 'day', 'drums', 'funeral', 'film', 'structured', 'six', 'New', 'Frontier', 'Peace', 'Corps', 'conquest', 'space', 'Alliance', 'Progress', 'civil', 'rights', 'freedom', 'peace', '1961', 'floating', 'globe', 'called', 'world', 'were', 'three', 'billion', 'people', 'most', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'free', 'peace', 'were', 'loud', 'visible', 'problems', 'fires', 'burning', 'Congo', 'foreign-dictated', 'government', 'Cuba', 'starvation', 'one-third', 'world', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'portrayed', 'one', 'uncommon', 'men', 'history', 'world', 'who', 'thought', 'not', 'problems', 'invisible', 'silent', 'solutions', 'Featured', 'film', 'are', 'speech', 'White', 'House', 'first', 'Peace', 'Corps', 'volunteers', 'journey', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'viva', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'viva', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'mucha', 'gracias', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'mass', 'meeting', 'Aug.', '28', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Alan', 'Shephard', 'award', 'ceremony', 'Berlin', 'crisis', 'war', 'Moscow', 'not', 'Berlin', 'speech', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'Let', 'come', 'Berlin', 'trip', 'Ireland', 'Interspersed', 'segments', 'are', 'scenes', '1963', 'funeral', 'History', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'cold', 'pen', 'book', 'write', 'chronological', 'order', 'events', 'day', 'date', 'time', 'city', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'date', 'time', 'city', 'life', 'death', 'symbolized', 'invisible', 'silent', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'world']","John F Kennedy - Years of Lightning, Day of Drums on DVD"
