This DVD is nothing but scenes that were too bad to be included in Jackass 2 and various people explaining why they were too bad or did not work as planned as an intro to each clip.  The only newly shot material on this DVD is the intro and outro of the movie which is nothing to look at it's just them all standing on stage and saying welcome to Jackass 2.5 basically.  This whole DVD could have been included with Jackass 2 as a couple extra minutes of deleted scenes, instead they chose to try and make another $20 off of us all by making us buy the movie twice.  You have already seen most of these scenes in the ending credits of Jackass 2 such as them on the driving range, wee man in the cooler with the watergun, and riding minibikes in the grocery store.  In all honesty there is nothing here that I will watch more than once since these scenes are all awful, and even for Jackass fans I cannot recommend this DVD unless you have money to burn.",1,Rip off that should have been included with Jackass 2!,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1187,"['fan', 'hate', 'give', 'Jackass', 'Dvd', 'low', 'rating', 'nothing', 'way', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'fans', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'material', 'when', 'bought', 'Jackass', '2', 'quite', 'overpriced', 'top', '20', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'scenes', 'were', 'too', 'bad', 'be', 'included', 'Jackass', '2', 'various', 'people', 'explaining', 'why', 'were', 'too', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'planned', 'intro', 'clip', 'only', 'newly', 'shot', 'material', 'DVD', 'intro', 'outro', 'movie', 'nothing', 'look', 'just', 'standing', 'stage', 'saying', 'welcome', 'Jackass', '2.5', 'basically', 'whole', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'Jackass', '2', 'couple', 'extra', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'instead', 'chose', 'try', 'make', '20', 'making', 'buy', 'movie', 'twice', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'most', 'scenes', 'ending', 'credits', 'Jackass', '2', 'such', 'driving', 'range', 'wee', 'man', 'cooler', 'watergun', 'riding', 'minibikes', 'grocery', 'store', 'honesty', 'nothing', 'here', 'will', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'scenes', 'are', 'awful', 'even', 'Jackass', 'fans', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'have', 'money', 'burn']",Jackass 2.5

I've always been an avid fan of the Jackass movies nad Wildboyz TV series but this is a waste of time. What you have is nearly two hours of outtakes that were considered too lame for Jackass 2--and they're still so lame and boring that you would think a grammar school kid had video taped the sequences. You're given scene after scene showing the Jackass cast and crew shrieking in uncontrollable laughter and hysteria as they watch themselves on screen. Then you're presented with endless talky interviews that one would expect to have found on the Jackass 2 DVD. What's strange is that the most popular cast member, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius is giving absolutley nothing to do. You see him hiding behind his guitar, talking, talking. Much of the film emphasizes bare bottoms and which ones do they constantly use? Those of wee man and the 300 pound man.  They're enough to make you truly barf. In one scene, Johnny Knoxville puts the wee man over his lap and powders his bare rear. What was the point, except to watch Knoxville and the cast and crew nearly collapsing on the floor with hysteria. Even worse is the continual showing of the fat man's bare rump and the different things that are done to it. You really want to barf. Why couldn't they have used the rears of some of the better looking guys--like the Party Boy? There's also one sequence where Bam Mangera receives a prostate exam in a sex shop in Russia. Bam screams and hollars and convulses while this is being done--with one finger--until you'd think this guy has a tree trunk being used instead of a doctor's finger. You can only hope that Jackass 3 will be a hell of a lot more interesting than these boring, lame episodes that are all so boring and lame and worthless that I could barely get through to the end.",1,Brainless Bilge,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,1869,"['compilation', 'outtakes', 'Jackass', '2', 'strictly', 'fanatical', 'Jackass', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'avid', 'fan', 'Jackass', 'movies', 'nad', 'Wildboyz', 'TV', 'series', 'waste', 'time', 'What', 'have', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'outtakes', 'were', 'considered', 'too', 'lame', 'Jackass', '2', ""'re"", 'still', 'so', 'lame', 'boring', 'would', 'think', 'grammar', 'school', 'kid', 'had', 'video', 'taped', 'sequences', ""'re"", 'given', 'scene', 'scene', 'showing', 'Jackass', 'cast', 'crew', 'shrieking', 'uncontrollable', 'laughter', 'hysteria', 'watch', 'screen', 'Then', ""'re"", 'presented', 'endless', 'talky', 'interviews', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'have', 'found', 'Jackass', '2', 'DVD', 'What', 'strange', 'most', 'popular', 'cast', 'member', 'Chris', 'Boy', 'Pontius', 'giving', 'absolutley', 'nothing', 'do', 'see', 'hiding', 'guitar', 'talking', 'talking', 'Much', 'film', 'bare', 'bottoms', 'ones', 'do', 'constantly', 'use', 'wee', 'man', '300', 'pound', 'man', ""'re"", 'enough', 'make', 'truly', 'barf', 'one', 'scene', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'wee', 'man', 'lap', 'powders', 'bare', 'rear', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'watch', 'Knoxville', 'cast', 'crew', 'nearly', 'collapsing', 'floor', 'hysteria', 'Even', 'worse', 'continual', 'showing', 'fat', 'man', 'bare', 'rump', 'different', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'really', 'want', 'barf', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'used', 'rears', 'better', 'looking', 'guys', 'Party', 'Boy', 'also', 'one', 'sequence', 'where', 'Bam', 'Mangera', 'prostate', 'exam', 'sex', 'shop', 'Russia', 'Bam', 'screams', 'hollars', 'convulses', 'being', 'done', 'one', 'finger', ""'d"", 'think', 'guy', 'tree', 'trunk', 'being', 'used', 'instead', 'doctor', 'finger', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Jackass', '3', 'will', 'be', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'boring', 'lame', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'boring', 'lame', 'worthless', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'end']",Jackass 2.5
