1454590,A2JNGYDPSATWDC,B005CXOGAU,A. Mcintyre,"[26, 27]","I understand all the complaints. I believe I am the first to review the actual DVDs. By the fifth inning of the first game, I forgot my issues with picture quality and started to enjoy the games. By most any measure, Game 6 is one of greatest games in World Series history. And that's the way it comes across here, with all the post-game interviews and comments included. In my case, some of the post-game stuff is new because my local station cut in with the ""11 o'clock news."" But, all the games are interesting...seven game World Series with two evenly-matched teams are very rare these days.I am disappointed with the Bonus DVD, which is a recap of the two playoff series, and a small portion of the Cardinals victory parade. Why bother, if that's all you show?For Cardinal fans (like me) who are upset about Albert Pujols leaving for the Angels, it was chance to watch Albert for one last time. I am angry about Pujols leaving, but again the World Series is so interesting, he eventually becames just part of an unusally interesting sports event. David Freese, Lance Berkman and Chris Carpenter are the Cardinal heros, except for Pujols's three-homer game.Give the DVDs a chance!",5,One of Most Exciting World Series in Years,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1184,"['understand', 'complaints', 'believe', 'am', 'first', 'review', 'actual', 'DVDs', 'fifth', 'inning', 'first', 'game', 'forgot', 'issues', 'picture', 'quality', 'started', 'enjoy', 'games', 'most', 'measure', 'Game', '6', 'one', 'greatest', 'games', 'World', 'Series', 'history', 'way', 'here', 'post-game', 'interviews', 'comments', 'included', 'case', 'post-game', 'stuff', 'new', 'local', 'station', 'cut', '11', ""o'clock"", 'news', 'games', 'are', 'interesting', 'seven', 'game', 'World', 'Series', 'two', 'evenly-matched', 'teams', 'are', 'very', 'rare', 'days.I', 'am', 'disappointed', 'Bonus', 'DVD', 'recap', 'two', 'playoff', 'series', 'small', 'portion', 'Cardinals', 'victory', 'parade', 'Why', 'bother', 'show', 'Cardinal', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'upset', 'Albert', 'Pujols', 'leaving', 'Angels', 'was', 'chance', 'watch', 'Albert', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'am', 'angry', 'Pujols', 'leaving', 'again', 'World', 'Series', 'so', 'interesting', 'eventually', 'just', 'part', 'unusally', 'interesting', 'sports', 'event', 'David', 'Freese', 'Lance', 'Berkman', 'Chris', 'Carpenter', 'are', 'Cardinal', 'heros', 'Pujols', 'three-homer', 'game.Give', 'DVDs', 'chance']",St. Louis Cardinals: 2011 World Series

It will not hold a spot with the great series like 1975(Reds/Red Sox) 1986 (Mets/Red Sox) 1991 (Twins/Braves) 2001 (Diamondbacks/Yankees). Rather it will be remembered among some very good series like 1982 (Cardinal/Brewers) 1987 (Twins/Cardinals) 1997(Marlins/Indians) 2002(Angels/Giants). With that said there is no doubt I will be adding it my collection. Game 6 and the great Cardinals comeback makes it worth the purchase. Besides, it was nice to see a class orginazation like The Cardinals win another title.
