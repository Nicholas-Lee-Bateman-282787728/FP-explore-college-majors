870853,AJASGOXDLFHR9,B0006JMLUW,Ace,"[0, 0]","Vampires are popular as they are both sexy and cool. Throw into the equation cops, gun play and gore and one has the potential for a ""monster"" hit. VAMPIRES Out For Blood was for the most part, a serious attempt at Horror which played out like a cross between a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER episode and BORDELLO OF BLOOD, (with bits of VAMP & John CARPENTER's VAMPIRES tossed in for good measure). A Police Detective searching for a missing female is lured to an abandoned hospital that is used by Vampires for orgies (and feeding on their Human prey). Once bitten by the Master Vampire, he must search and destroy his sire in order to avoid ""turning"" into one of the undead. Though formulaic, I rather enjoyed the first half of the film though the remaining frames failed to hold much interest. Some of the acting was also spotty with Vanessa ANGEL taking top honors in that category. Though he delivered a competent performance, I was not sold on lead Kevin DILLON either. Lance HENRIKSEN's performance was solid as was that of lead femme fatale Vamp Jodi Lyn O'KEEFE. I would have liked to have seen more of her character in this picture. This was an entertaining Vampire film that featured some impressive gore and splatter, (check out the decapitation and the latex stretching ""nardi"" in one of the neck bite scenes). The Vampires were reminiscent of those seen in BUFFY; replete with their snide remarks, funky clothing and angular faces with protruding foreheads & high cheekbones. The Vamps also displayed super-human powers as demonstrated by their stealth, speed and powers of bewitching. The former was evident by the change noted in their eyes, (great contact lenses). Although the treatment was different than that portrayed in films like INNOCENT BLOOD, the effect was almost as powerful and added a welcome dimension to the undead. The film was also racy at the outset; containing some nudity and adult situations, including hedonism. The Vamps lair doubled as a Swingers/S&M Club of sorts, with Humans on the menu. Had this angle been developed with more interplay between DILLON and O'KEEFE, we would have had a dynamite motion picture on our hands. As it stands, VAMPIRES Out For Blood is worth a rent and perhaps even a purchase for those interested in Vampire films. While it won't be your favorite undead DVD, I think you will agree that one could do a lot worse.

I bought this movie a while ago at a Hollywood Video expecting a pretty cool movie, I wasn't too disappointed. The film on looks alone promises a lot and only delivers on some, which makes it a decent movie. But hey Lance Henriksen wanted to do this movie so that says something, right?The story is about a sleazy drunk detective who is stalking his ex wife, who happens to be a vampire expert and famous author. We start off with Hank telling a psychiatrist about what happened to him because apparently things didn't work out for him. From here he is put on a case to find a missing girl, who as you can guess is a vampire. He is lead to the feeding grounds of the vampires and is bitten by the leader, who looks like a mix of the Salem's lot type vampire and something out of Star Wars. Of course he tries to get his ex to help him and a lot of bad things start to happen to both of them from this point on.Writer/Director/Producer Richard Brandes has crafted a pretty decent little independent horror film. In fact on the production side of things there is really nothing wrong with this film. Brandes obviously really put a lot of work into this film, and the score and camera work are really good especially for this type of film. Problems come from the acting side of this film, not all are bad but not all are good. Vanessa Angel in particular does not come off as completely believable in this film, in fact in scenes were she is supposed to be excited or scared she over sells it. Kenneth Colom is just annoying at the beginning of this movie, but gets a little better later in the film, in the hotel scene he is pretty funny actually. Kevin Dillon is real good in this film, but for the first 10 to 15 minutes his character is completely unlikable. Really it is after the vampire scenes were he is bitten do we start to like him. Lance Henriksen As usual is great as the police chief, he really pulls out a good performance in this little b movie.This movie while not a classic does have it's moments, the ending is brilliant. And there is some tension that is built up real well at times, it's a pretty good movie.

As a last-ditch effort to give him something to do that will get his mind off his ex, Hank's captain (Henriksen) assigns him to track down a missing girl, Layla Simmons (&lt;em>Prison Break&lt;/em>'s Jodi Lynn O'Keefe). He finds her relatively quickly...and discovers she's the newest recruit in a band of vampires who travels around the city looking for prey. Needless to say, no one believes him...If you were to slap together every clich&eacute; you can find in any vampire film made in the past, oh, thirty years, you might come up with the script for &lt;em>Out for Blood&lt;/em>. Brandes manages a couple of amusing twists (there's a great sequence that involves baiting the Renfields, who are capably, and amusingly, played by character actors  Adrian Roberts and Nick Stellate--they're the best thing about the movie), but by five minutes into this, you will be able to map out the entire film's trajectory withou expending any brainpower at all. And when your end credits include such deep, meaningful roles as ""Hot Girl"" and ""Wild Girl #2"", well, you know why you're watching this. **",2,You could probably make a decent drinking game out of it.,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2113,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Out', 'Blood', 'lt', '>', 'Richard', 'Brandes', '2004', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'lt', '>', 'Out', 'Blood', 'lt', '>', 'also', 'released', 'variant', 'title', 'lt', '>', 'Vampires', 'out', 'Blood', 'lt', '>', 'better', 'slightly', 'other', 'Richard', 'Brandes', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2006', 'lt', '>', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'lt', '>', 'should', 'have', 'simply', 'dropped', 'Penny', 'name', 'purposes', 'accuracy', 'However', 'lt', '>', 'Penny', 'Dreadful', 'lt', '>', 'bar', 'so', 'low', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'When', 'top-billed', 'stars', 'are', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', '1988', 'lt', '>', 'Blob', 'lt', '>', 'remake', 'Vanessa', 'Angel', 'lt', '>', 'Superbabies', 'Baby', 'Geniuses', '2', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'screams', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Add', 'small', 'role', 'perennial', 'SFC', 'favorite', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'movie', 'fate', 'was', 'guaranteed.Plot', 'Hank', 'Dillon', 'alcoholic', 'cop', 'who', 'dangerously', 'close', 'getting', 'thrown', 'off', 'force', 'using', 'official', 'connections', 'help', 'stalk', 'ex-wife', 'Angel', 'writer', 'lurid', 'pulp', 'vampire', 'novels', 'last-ditch', 'effort', 'give', 'something', 'do', 'will', 'get', 'mind', 'ex', 'Hank', 'captain', 'Henriksen', 'track', 'down', 'missing', 'girl', 'Layla', 'Simmons', 'lt', '>', 'Prison', 'Break', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Jodi', 'Lynn', ""O'Keefe"", 'relatively', 'quickly', 'newest', 'recruit', 'band', 'vampires', 'who', 'travels', 'city', 'looking', 'prey', 'Needless', 'say', 'one', 'were', 'slap', 'together', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'find', 'vampire', 'film', 'made', 'past', 'oh', 'thirty', 'years', 'might', 'come', 'up', 'script', 'lt', '>', 'Out', 'Blood', 'lt', '>', 'Brandes', 'couple', 'amusing', 'twists', 'great', 'sequence', 'baiting', 'Renfields', 'who', 'are', 'capably', 'amusingly', 'played', 'character', 'actors', 'Adrian', 'Roberts', 'Nick', 'Stellate', ""'re"", 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'five', 'minutes', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'map', 'out', 'entire', 'film', 'trajectory', 'withou', 'expending', 'brainpower', 'when', 'end', 'credits', 'include', 'such', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'roles', 'Hot', 'Girl', 'Wild', 'Girl', '2', 'well', 'know', 'why', ""'re"", 'watching', '**']",N/A

Anyway, It wasn't a terrible horror movie either, these 1 star reviewers haven't been around the horror movie block long enough to see what a bad one really looks like. To get to the point, there are many problems with it: (1) You have 2 really good actors in the movie surrounded by a slew of bad actors. The contrast is so bad that it is laughable. (2) keeping in spirit of the unevenness, the regular vampires have good, to fair makeup jobs, while the master vampire has terrible makeup. Actually I should say a mask. He looks like yoda. (3) It has some gore in it. I gave it high ratings for that, but at the same time, the blood effects were generic, so I subtracted some points (4) Terrible ending, which I wont spoil, but its abrupt, and the movie is very vague about the origins of the vampires.The summary: some T&A;, some gore, some bad acting, some good acting, some good makeup, some bad masks, not too many memorable scenes, a movie to rent, and then forget about.

870869,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B0006JMLUW,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[4, 4]","This is an OK movie on a bad day I have even called it lame.  Having just seen the movie on SCI-FI this weekend made me revisit my way too hard opinion of this movie.  Oh trust me it is still not a master work of vampire fiction to say the least but, I have seen much worse than this.  Dracula 3000 springs immediately to mind.  Compared to Dracula 3000, this Vampires - Out for Blood (Widescreen Edition) DVD is Oscar Worthy high art.This vampire story has a well developed plot more than I can say about some really bad DVD's.  I do not know how they managed it but ever one of the characters in this movie has a flakey  aspect to their on screen persona that makes them feel unreal at best or slightly unhinged at worse.  The fact that all the people in the DVD come across as slightly cracked bothered me at first because, it made the process of suspending logic to get into the movie more of a chore.Seeing the movie this weekend taught me I was taking the movie too seriously.  This movie is not one of those ""Serious Vampire Thrillers"".  There is a very subtle well executed vein of comedy running throughout this movie for those sensitive enough to the human condition to detect it.  Granted the weirdest humor in this movie is so slight it is barely discernable, it took me three viewings to catch the hidden humor in this film but it is for sure there.Yes the cop hunting the vampires was an amazing lush.  His ex-wife was played to ditzy California perfection from the very beginning of the film to its end.  The king of the Vampires was a special effect that only the Irwin Allen super elastic bubble plastic monster designers guild could be proud of.  I kind of liked the main character in the movie exactly because he was imperfect and sort of tragic in so many ways.  The ending of this movie was particularly hilarious and I would not dare spoil it for you chaps here.  Taken as a humorous but frightening flick this DVD deserves 3 to three and a half stars.A more realistic king of the vampire's tighter more believable character development and in some cases slightly better writing would have made this a pretty good vampire movie.  The core storyline was awesome it just was not carried out well as it could have been.  All things considered it is NOT a bad DVD at all.  Now that I have experienced some really bad Vampire movies I have revised my rating on this one to 3 well deserved stars.  Is this the best vampire movie NO, but on a day when you just want to watch something mildly funny and scary this DVD fits the need to a T.  I might be adding this DVD to my collection soon; it is way pricey for a merely average B-Movie but seeing how subtly funny this thing this past weekend has pushed me towards buying a copy before it goes out of print.Best wishes to yawl from, WOLFY",3,Too Expensive  for nn OK Movie that is far less than it could have been!,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,2803,"['OK', 'movie', 'bad', 'day', 'have', 'even', 'called', 'lame', 'Having', 'just', 'seen', 'movie', 'SCI-FI', 'weekend', 'made', 'revisit', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'opinion', 'movie', 'Oh', 'still', 'not', 'master', 'work', 'vampire', 'fiction', 'say', 'least', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'Dracula', '3000', 'springs', 'immediately', 'mind', 'Compared', 'Dracula', '3000', 'Vampires', 'Blood', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'Oscar', 'Worthy', 'high', 'art.This', 'vampire', 'story', 'well', 'developed', 'plot', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'bad', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'managed', 'ever', 'one', 'characters', 'movie', 'flakey', 'aspect', 'screen', 'persona', 'feel', 'unreal', 'best', 'slightly', 'unhinged', 'worse', 'fact', 'people', 'DVD', 'come', 'slightly', 'cracked', 'bothered', 'first', 'made', 'process', 'suspending', 'logic', 'get', 'movie', 'more', 'chore.Seeing', 'movie', 'weekend', 'taught', 'was', 'taking', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'Serious', 'Vampire', 'Thrillers', 'very', 'subtle', 'well', 'executed', 'vein', 'comedy', 'running', 'movie', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'human', 'condition', 'detect', 'Granted', 'weirdest', 'humor', 'movie', 'so', 'slight', 'barely', 'discernable', 'took', 'three', 'viewings', 'catch', 'hidden', 'humor', 'film', 'sure', 'there.Yes', 'cop', 'hunting', 'vampires', 'was', 'amazing', 'lush', 'ex-wife', 'was', 'played', 'ditzy', 'California', 'perfection', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'king', 'Vampires', 'was', 'special', 'effect', 'only', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'super', 'elastic', 'bubble', 'plastic', 'monster', 'designers', 'guild', 'could', 'be', 'proud', 'kind', 'liked', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'exactly', 'was', 'imperfect', 'sort', 'tragic', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'would', 'not', 'dare', 'spoil', 'chaps', 'here', 'Taken', 'humorous', 'frightening', 'flick', 'DVD', '3', 'three', 'half', 'stars.A', 'more', 'realistic', 'king', 'vampire', 'tighter', 'more', 'believable', 'character', 'development', 'cases', 'slightly', 'better', 'writing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'pretty', 'good', 'vampire', 'movie', 'core', 'storyline', 'was', 'awesome', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'carried', 'out', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'things', 'considered', 'NOT', 'bad', 'DVD', 'Now', 'have', 'experienced', 'really', 'bad', 'Vampire', 'movies', 'have', 'revised', 'rating', 'one', '3', 'well', 'deserved', 'stars', 'best', 'vampire', 'movie', 'NO', 'day', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'mildly', 'funny', 'scary', 'DVD', 'need', 'T.', 'might', 'be', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection', 'soon', 'way', 'pricey', 'merely', 'average', 'B-Movie', 'seeing', 'how', 'subtly', 'thing', 'past', 'weekend', 'pushed', 'buying', 'copy', 'print.Best', 'wishes', 'yawl', 'WOLFY']",N/A
