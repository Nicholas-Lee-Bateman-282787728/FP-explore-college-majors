775185,A2XBBQ36STNJ0G,B0000CBXYN,here_is_your_review,"[48, 49]","If you're trying to explain the End Times (i.e., the 7-year Tribulation, 3.5-year Great Tribulation) to your family, friends or associates, you won't find a better video than this one. Includes running commentary by Dr. Ed Hindson, Dr. Thomas Ice, Dr. Larry Poland and Dr. Tim LaHaye. Excellent presentation of material, news and documentary footage, plus state-of-the-art graphics and special effects. NOW there is a DVD version for easy access to chapters!!!Actually the only doctrinal issue that I would differ with is LaHaye's statement of the world's population by mid-trib whereas I would say the Scriptures more accurately presents this figure at the end of the Tribulation. Don't let this keep you from ordering the video.They really did their homework to come up with a decent presentation on this topic and spent the money for terrific production values. I recommend it especially to pastors who are trying to quickly get their church &quot;up to speed&quot; on these issues. This has to be one of the best videos on this subject ever produced. No drama, just Bible prophecy presented with news footage plus a few actors to portray some of the main characters.Too bad they didn't note that Moslems had planted a graveyard in front of the Eastern Gate of Jerusalem during the Turkish rule. Knowing that the Messiah, Christ, would have to qualify as an Old Testament Priest of God, they walled up the Eastern Gate and planted a graveyard in front of it. Priests are forbidden by Scripture to go through a graveyard.  Somehow, I don't think this will be a problem for Him! (there are a lot of shots of the Eastern Gate of Jerusalem, with the graveyard in front of it, in this movie).Get the movie and show it to your family and friends!  Ask your Pastor / Minister to show it at church!

I didn't give it 5 stars only because it didn't speak of the 2 prophets that Rev say will come and talk of the Lord and wont be able to be killed but will shoot fire from their mouths on all who try to hurt them. Until after 3.5 years when God calls them and the rise and go to heaven. Also It ended at Christ's 1000 year rain and did not speak of satan being released after and the new Jerusalem.

For anyone looking at the world and wondering about the chaos ensuing in various places, Jesus' message may bring comfort or distress. Will the world know peace before it knows more chaos?While troubling to think about, this program explains that according to prophecy the world will go through more ""birth pains"" in order to arrive at a place of peace. Increases in earthquakes, disease, natural disasters and famine have been predicted, but already we see this happening all over the world and at more alarming rates. They go as far as to say that one-third of the earth's population are victims of famine.While these events are predicted in the Book of Revelations, the theme of this program is the signs Jesus foretold just days before he died.Of all the ""End Times"" movies I've seen, this one succinctly explains the series of events anyone who believes in prophecy could expect once the pieces of this puzzle start to fall into place more rapidly. While they don't go into detail about all the prophecies that have come true, they do point out some major occurrences that give validity to the prophecies of Jesus. The ""Seven Signs of Christ's Return"" is also helpful if you are tryingto do research or want an overview of Biblical prophecy in regards to End Times topics.While many of these types of movies focus on the end of the world, this at least does give hope and presents a peaceful world in the end.~The Rebecca Review",5,Shines Light on Biblical Prophecy,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1793,"['June', '30', '2005', 'UN', 'scientists', 'say', 'severe', 'draughts', 'Africa', 'Central', 'America', 'south-east', 'Asia', 'past', 'year', 'are', 'part', 'emerging', 'pattern', 'could', 'result', 'food', 'shortages', 'one', 'out', 'six', 'countries', 'world', 'year', 'Are', 'nearing', 'end', 'world', 'Jesus', 'predicted', 'what', 'exactly', 'did', 'say', 'signs', 'return', 'anyone', 'looking', 'world', 'wondering', 'chaos', 'ensuing', 'various', 'places', 'Jesus', 'message', 'may', 'bring', 'comfort', 'distress', 'Will', 'world', 'know', 'peace', 'more', 'chaos', 'troubling', 'think', 'program', 'according', 'prophecy', 'world', 'will', 'go', 'more', 'birth', 'pains', 'order', 'arrive', 'place', 'peace', 'earthquakes', 'disease', 'natural', 'disasters', 'famine', 'have', 'been', 'predicted', 'already', 'see', 'happening', 'world', 'more', 'alarming', 'rates', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'one-third', 'earth', 'population', 'are', 'victims', 'famine.While', 'events', 'are', 'predicted', 'Book', 'Revelations', 'theme', 'program', 'signs', 'Jesus', 'foretold', 'just', 'days', 'End', 'Times', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'succinctly', 'series', 'events', 'anyone', 'who', 'prophecy', 'could', 'expect', 'once', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'start', 'fall', 'place', 'more', 'rapidly', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'prophecies', 'have', 'come', 'true', 'do', 'point', 'out', 'major', 'occurrences', 'give', 'validity', 'prophecies', 'Jesus', 'Seven', 'Signs', 'Christ', 'Return', 'also', 'helpful', 'are', 'tryingto', 'do', 'research', 'want', 'overview', 'Biblical', 'prophecy', 'regards', 'End', 'Times', 'topics.While', 'many', 'types', 'movies', 'focus', 'end', 'world', 'least', 'give', 'hope', 'peaceful', 'world', 'end.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

Many discuss how the Feasts of God have been foreshadowing or rehearsals of Christ's birth, life, death, rapture and return. The fall feasts have yet to be fulfilled.  So we should know the season, but not necessarily which one or when the horn starts and stops blowing based upon when the first sliver of the new moon is seen.Also, I do not be believe the rapture will be just a disappearance.  Read - Red Moon Rising.  by Peter Goodgame.  He makes some really good observations of earthquakes and resurrections and matching to the seals.  I think it is very possible that a massive earthquake on a world-wide scale like that of the tsunami in 2004 which took hundreds of thousands of lives (many will never be found) will be the rapture and it will be easy to convince people that those who are lost were swept away in the ocean or buried in landslides, sink holes, etc.So, this was a good video, but I wanted to add my thoughts and suggestions on additional information to review and read.",4,"Good overview, but you need to read more",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,1143,"['Yes', 'day', 'hour', 'may', 'not', 'know', '1', 'Thessalonians', '5:4', 'are', 'not', 'darkness', 'day', 'should', 'surprise', 'thief', 'night', 'Many', 'discuss', 'how', 'Feasts', 'God', 'have', 'been', 'foreshadowing', 'rehearsals', 'Christ', 'birth', 'life', 'death', 'rapture', 'return', 'fall', 'feasts', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'should', 'know', 'season', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'when', 'horn', 'blowing', 'based', 'when', 'first', 'sliver', 'new', 'moon', 'seen.Also', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'believe', 'rapture', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'disappearance', 'Read', 'Red', 'Moon', 'Rising', 'Peter', 'Goodgame', 'really', 'good', 'observations', 'earthquakes', 'resurrections', 'matching', 'seals', 'think', 'very', 'possible', 'massive', 'earthquake', 'world-wide', 'scale', 'tsunami', '2004', 'took', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'lives', 'many', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'found', 'will', 'be', 'rapture', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'convince', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'lost', 'were', 'swept', 'away', 'ocean', 'buried', 'landslides', 'sink', 'holes', 'etc.So', 'was', 'good', 'video', 'wanted', 'add', 'thoughts', 'suggestions', 'additional', 'information', 'review', 'read']",N/A
