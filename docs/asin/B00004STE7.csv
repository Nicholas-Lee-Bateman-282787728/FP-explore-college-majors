It's really cute - I love how the Big Red Car was basically made of cardboard here and how they go around showing all the people that work with them and their children.  It's filled with great songs and just very nice things for kids to dance to.  The end shows live concert shots of the Wiggles and it's pretty basic compared to what they do now.  This was our first Wiggles video and one of our favorites too.  This one is a very early Wiggles video but one very much worth getting.

My girls love them (1 and 2.5 years)and dance and sing along to their favourite songs.  Each song has simple dance moves so that your toddler can easily copy Jeff(Purple Wiggle), Murray (Red Wiggle), Greg (Yellow Wiggle) and Anthony (Blue Wiggle).  Captain Feathersword (the friendly Pirate), Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog and Henry the Octopus all feature in this video as well.  There is always lots of Wiggle humour thrown in as well which my girls find hiliarious!What I like about The Wiggles is that you can tell that each member is really having a good time - they enjoy what they do, entertaining children and their carers, and this shows through on their videos.",5,Get this video and WAKE UP JEFF!,1014336000,"02 22, 2002",2002,741,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'biased', 'being', 'Australia', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'girls', 'love', '1', '2.5', 'years', 'dance', 'sing', 'along', 'favourite', 'songs', 'song', 'simple', 'dance', 'moves', 'so', 'toddler', 'can', 'easily', 'copy', 'Jeff', 'Purple', 'Wiggle', 'Murray', 'Red', 'Wiggle', 'Greg', 'Yellow', 'Wiggle', 'Anthony', 'Blue', 'Wiggle', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'friendly', 'Pirate', 'Dorothy', 'Dinosaur', 'Wags', 'Dog', 'Henry', 'Octopus', 'feature', 'video', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'lots', 'Wiggle', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'girls', 'find', 'hiliarious', 'What', 'like', 'Wiggles', 'can', 'tell', 'member', 'really', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'enjoy', 'what', 'do', 'entertaining', 'children', 'carers', 'videos']",N/A

At first I though Toot Toot! was the best one, but as we watched Wakeup Jeff more and more it grew on me and my baby. It is a little older and less polished then the other tapes, filmed in 1997, but it is the tape that shows the most dancing children in every song! The songs all are superb too. There are no pauses either with the annoying Magic tricks they like to do in this tape. It is non-stop dancing singing fun that my baby claps and &quot;wiggles&quot; to non-stop. The Wiggles is the only thing that soothes her every night so she can be ready to fall asleep for bed- nothing else works. And after 11 months of watching them every night neither my husband nor myself are sick of them. This is perhaps the best one in the series and we have them all, even Dance Party!",5,This is as close to perfection as it gets!,997228800,"08 8, 2001",2001,882,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Wiggles', 'video', 'baby', 'was', 'born', '11', 'month', '65533', 's', 'ago', 'night', 'first', 'Toot', 'Toot', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'watched', 'Wakeup', 'Jeff', 'more', 'more', 'grew', 'baby', 'little', 'older', 'less', 'polished', 'then', 'other', 'tapes', 'filmed', '1997', 'tape', 'most', 'dancing', 'children', 'song', 'songs', 'are', 'superb', 'too', 'are', 'pauses', 'annoying', 'Magic', 'tricks', 'like', 'do', 'tape', 'non-stop', 'dancing', 'singing', 'fun', 'baby', 'claps', 'quot', 'wiggles', 'quot', 'non-stop', 'Wiggles', 'only', 'thing', 'night', 'can', 'be', 'ready', 'fall', 'asleep', 'bed-', 'nothing', 'else', '11', 'months', 'watching', 'night', 'husband', 'are', 'sick', 'perhaps', 'best', 'one', 'series', 'have', 'even', 'Dance', 'Party']",N/A

Even getting someone who isn't a Field brother as Captain Feathersword is a step up. What may be the best moment comes in Henry's Underwater Big Band where in a moment of free style Greg sets dancing back a few years. Still they are so sincere in what they're doing and you can tell good things are in store for them. If your little ones only know the Wiggles from about the Sam era on you're on your own to explain chubby unibrow Anthony.Things look doubtful they'll release this one on DVD, unless there's a petition or something.
