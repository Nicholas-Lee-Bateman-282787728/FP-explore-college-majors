It's THAT cute. It's a heartwarming and, indeed, therapeutic viewing experience, watching these young, super-dedicated employees, competing for the employee of the month designation - and the winner gets the car and he could get the girl too.There is no violence, there is lots of friendship and team work all-over, because both the good guys and the bad guys are team players. The bosses are a little bit demanding but fair and the few illegalities or immoral activities are so mild, they should make us laugh rather than outrage us. In the end, the good guy wins, of course and the not so good guy is humiliated and properly but not severely punished. We are led to believe that all the personal dramas the good guys were experiencing are solved or on their path toward solving and some of those who did not fall asleep or did not walk away might end the viewing with a little smile on their faces.This shouldn't be on anyone's must-have movies shopping list but those interested to see what might be going behind the scenes inside those mysterious big-box shopping clubs that charge members annual fees for the privilege of being allowed to buy super-family-sized snack boxes and a discount may find the viewing experience tolerable.",2,Big Box Shopping Club Cuteness,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,1407,"['Meant', 'be', 'feel', 'good', 'nice', 'nice', 'nice', 'comedy', 'cuteness', 'should', 'really', 'improve', 'public', 'image', 'employers', 'such', 'B.J', 'Sam', 'Club', 'CostCo', 'cute', 'heartwarming', 'indeed', 'therapeutic', 'viewing', 'experience', 'watching', 'young', 'super-dedicated', 'employees', 'competing', 'employee', 'month', 'designation', 'winner', 'car', 'could', 'get', 'girl', 'violence', 'lots', 'friendship', 'team', 'work', 'all-over', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'team', 'players', 'bosses', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'demanding', 'fair', 'few', 'illegalities', 'immoral', 'activities', 'are', 'so', 'mild', 'should', 'make', 'rather', 'outrage', 'end', 'good', 'guy', 'wins', 'course', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'guy', 'humiliated', 'properly', 'not', 'severely', 'punished', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'personal', 'dramas', 'good', 'guys', 'were', 'experiencing', 'are', 'solved', 'path', 'solving', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'asleep', 'did', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'might', 'end', 'viewing', 'little', 'smile', 'faces.This', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'anyone', 'must-have', 'movies', 'shopping', 'list', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'scenes', 'mysterious', 'big-box', 'shopping', 'clubs', 'charge', 'members', 'annual', 'fees', 'privilege', 'being', 'allowed', 'buy', 'super-family-sized', 'snack', 'boxes', 'discount', 'may', 'find', 'viewing', 'experience', 'tolerable']",N/A

Jessica handles herself well, looks beautiful and is quite classy and charming.

I fall more in the latter category. And here he makes his starring debut, and nobody could save this film except for the Kind of Egoism. Well, add to the fact that it has an interesting locale and this film saves itself from a somewhat shallow grave. And comes off rather funny in the process.The Cast: Dane Cook brings his personality to the movie, and hits all the right slacker notes. It definitely couln't, or wouldn't have been pulled off very well any other guy, except one who is truly a slacker. The underrated Dax Shepherd also hits all the right notes as his evil and underhanded cashier superstar. Although it is weird to see him with blond hair, but it makes him all the more evil. And Jessica Simpson, while winning no Oscars, doesn't exactly come away with any Razzies as screamingly as her other roles. She comes off a bit likable, even though her character is a bit one-dimensional.The supporting cast is also rather well done with many underrated talents. Harland Williams, Efren Ramirez and Brian George also do well in what under-used roles they have. And they come off great as always. It's also nice to see Harold Crenshaw, or Tim Bagley in a role that fits him very well. On the other hand, Andy Dick is self-explanatory to his name, and the over-used Danny Woodburn is as annoying as always.Story: Fairly interesting, and entertaining. Sure, it may be one you've heard a million times, but with the added element of the ""Super Club"" setting, it makes things all the more interesting. It's more of a satire on the blue-collar workshift workers who make their living in dead-end jobs, with nothing to look forward to. And the movie makes this dull existence something of a respectable position. But don't expect me to turn my application in there any time soon. And although this may sound weird, the more poignant moments of the movie were very good (stop laughing, I'm not out of my mind).Comedy: With all these comedic minds, how could there not be a chuckle or two? Fortunately, there's more than chuckles, and it blows into all-out hilarity in spots. Of course, my humor is the more juvenile 'Family Guy' type, but I was very amused during the whole movie. And while all gags featuring Andy Dick fall flatter than a... never mind, Dax Shepherd's victim gags seem to garner a laugh every time. And the competition scenes are sure to grab a few laughs if only because of the sheer ridiculousness of it all.Soundtrack: Props to the soundtrack of the movie, with it's wonderful use of Sugarcult's ""Do It Alone,"" NeedToBreathe's ""Shine,"" the cover of ""Surrender,"" and whatever the name is of that song that plays at the beginning of the credits. It's all fun, it's all good, and it's all used very well. It's very rare that a movie has this much music that I actually know, much less like.Overall, pick it up for a rental, or pick it up in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart, there's enough here to entertain and sustain. Sure, it may not be the greatest film on earth, or even close, but this little comedy does have heart, laughs and a great cast.

1037715,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B000LC3ICE,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[1, 2]","For what it's worth, the film is marginally entertaining, mainly because it seems to satirize the idea of making it to the top as an employee, even if it is a Sam's Club type of place (in this case, Super Club). With this movie's premise, it certainly should have been fairly funny, but for some reason it seemed to fail at many points. I think this had to do mainly with the lack of originality; everything seems to be standard and characters fail to deviate from their normal ""comedy"" stereotypes. You have the little cliques between the ""bag boy"" types on one side (great performance by Andy Dick), and then you have the ""cashier"" clique. Dax Sheppard plays Vince, the cashier who is not only the fastest, but will do anything to maintain his employee of the month record. On the other hand you have Zack (Dane Cook), the prototypical slacker type who does enough to just get by and not get fired. He's obviously the kind of guy you would root for because he doesn't have an ego, and seems to have a good repertoire with most of the employees (except, of course, Vince). Things begin to take off when Amy (Jessica Simpson) enters the scene, the new hot employee. Vince and Zack hear that she sleeps with employees of the month, and so the quest is on to be the next employee of the month. From here, we see Amy built a good relationship with Zack, all the while not fully aware of the ""contest"" between Zack and Vince.This comedy is mediocre mainly because it is middle of the road, and doesn't take many chances or stray from the norm at all. We all know that Vince is a jerk just like we know that Zack is the ""good guy"" who tries his best, is honest, and will probably have things work out for him. Then there is the hot girl who just wants to be loved, and find someone to treat her right, for who she really is. We don't have much in the way of original characters or story and, while the film is funny at times and entertaining somewhat, it could have been a lot more.

No, it's no CLERKS or OFFICE SPACE, but, nevertheless, I found it quite charming and certainly convivial enough to give it three stars. The acting efforts of stand-up comic Dane Cook and Groundlings alum and Cook's movie nemesis Dax Shepard propel the movie and give it its comedic gusto. The rest of the cast, including some so-called professional funnymen, vary from congenially effective to tepid.Most of us can relate, at some point or another, to people suffering the woes and aggravations of wasting away in a dead end job. We've all felt that overriding sense of boredom and career unfulfillment. Imagine toiling away at a Costco-like superstore as the lowest of the low, the much lamented position of Box Boy. Dane Cook plays Zack Bradley, a likable, laid back box boy at the Super Club (""where buying in bulk is our God-given right"") who was quite content to let the glory go to cocky, super go-getter Vince Downey (Dax Shepard), the ""fastest cashier in the Southwest Region."" That is, until he falls for new cashier girl Amy Renfrew (Jessica Simpson). Her personal file indicates Amy will only date employees of the month. So Zack decides to be that employee of the month but then has to contend with chief rival Vince, who has held that position for 17 months running. And if Vince gets it for the 18th time, he'll break the Super Club record and will win the grand prize of a brand newish 2005 Chevy Malibu. Will Zack be able to summon some reserve of ambition and achieve this oh-so-lofty goal? Will Dax Shepard steal the movie away from Dane Cook? Will Jessica Simpson ever get past acting on a vapid level?Every now and then, I feel like veering away from Oscar caliber type movies and getting down and dirty, cinema-wise (and, no, I don't mean those kinds of movies). I'm probably gonna go check out THE DEPARTED in the following weeks, but, tonight, I was in the mood for some crude, unPC shtick. I mean, what do you expect from this B-level cast and from Dane Cook? Rated PG Bill Cosby stylings? C'mon, now. This is pretty much the low-brow stuff that I thought the movie was gonna have, and I'm pretty content after having seen it. It contained enough chuckle-and-laugh-out-loud-worthy moments and enough shots of the nicely-endowed, scantily-clad Jessica Simpson that I didn't feel I wasted my money. Folks wandering into the theatre in search of Shakespearean styles of thespianism are in the wrong freakin' place. EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH is fully a frat movie, its core audience predominantly composed of juveniles and juveniles-at-heart. It does strive to be sweet at times and even attempts to drive home a message late in the flick (which I actually think proved to be more of a detriment to the film).There are some things that the movie missed out on. Casting, for example. Amy Smart would've been perfect for this role (although, she's perfect in any role) and would've done so much more with Amy Renfrew than Jessica Simpson did here. The word is still out on whether Simpson can act, but there's no doubting that she looks fine. Come to think of it, Ryan Reynolds probably would've also improved on the Zach Bradley role. And I've never been an Andy Dick fan. Guy is too out there and, worst of all, is NOT funny. The film also suffers from not taking enough chances (you could sense Dane Cook biting his tongue in many of the scenes), and the ending was definitely too smaltzy. The humor is also not mined enough in Andy Dick's blind-as-a-bat character, who toils away in the eye-care department. Same goes for the character of Gary Ross, the domineering dwarf.But, fear not, this comedy flick does offer some nice touches. I liked the idea of a secret hangout located on top of one of the towering, warehouse-like piles of store stock supplies, the concept of the store manager (named Glen Gary) being afraid of his big brother (named, Glen Ross, who turns out to be an imperious dwarf), and Efren Ramirez as Vince's sycophant lackey. Dane Cook, while not Ryan Reynolds, still is very serviceable in the lead role and you almost buy into his 180 degree redemption from a deadbeat to a responsible citizen. And Jessica Simpson does look VERY hot. And, with respect to the other actors, Dax Shepard is truly the one to watch in this film. The combination of arrogance and insecurity he instills within his role makes Vince Downey the most well-rounded character in the movie.So, kudos to Dax Shepard, Dane Cook, Harland Williams, Efren Ramirez, and - fine! - kudos also to Jessica Simpson. Slackers of the World, unite. Go down some suds, scarf a steak sandwich, and get yourself to the nearest cinema and revel in the low-rent but funny experience that is EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH.",3,"""This is an '81 Honda!

1037724,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000LC3ICE,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","One of the things I noticed about this movie was that it isn't another comedy where people sit around and mope about their dead-end jobs. In fact, the characters in this movie generally like their jobs and want to be good at them. Other films like Clerks and Office Space have done the job-loathing thing to perfection. I liked that this one went a different way. Granted, Zach initially likes his job primarily for the socialization, but he still learns to emulate his rival's conscientiousness. That the story finds honor rather than contempt in retail labor automatically makes it smarter than you might expect. ""Employee of the Month is intentionally exaggerated in its depiction of the retail workplace. I'd enjoyed the film's approach. It takes an environment we're all familiar with and gives it a good warping. If ""Employee of the Month"" has a flaw - and I guess it does or else I wouldn't be mentioning it - it's that the 108-minute running time is too indulgent for the thinness of the plot. Everything could be said and done just as effectively in 90 minutes, especially since it's pretty obvious where the story is heading anyway.The movie does have it's moments, The two actors really make the picture work. Cook melds the vintage movie slacker prototype with his own inherent charm to turn Zack into a guy we actually root for. Shepard, on the other hand, brings freshness to the now-stereotypical jerk character. He plays up Vince's buffoonery and vanity rather than making him a standard hateful comedy villain. Jessica Simpson wasted her whole on screen performance trying to remember her lines. There were times I believed she may have used cue cards. Simpson should quit acting and seriously stick to singing.  The whole time I sat there asking myself, 'how could any director in their right mind let a performance like this end up in their finished feature film?' Then when the credits rolled, I got my answer. Simpson's father was one of the film's producers.Cook's friends are made up of an all star supporting comedy cast (Harland Williams, Andy Dick) which flounders in this film. Andy Dick plays the guy with coke-bottle glasses who can't see anything, wasn't this joke played out on Saturday Night Live in the 60's? And the Indian electronics salesman bit was already done better in ""40 Year Old Virgin."" And we're forced to laugh at yet another joke about a midget as an authority figure. I will agree that midgets are funny on screen. But this play against type is old and done. The movie does have a couple laugh out loud moments involving a ""piece-of-crap Honda"" and a race sequence to clean up a spill in isle 6. But again, those funny moments are few and far between. ""Employee of the Month"" is a missed opportunity on almost every level and the box office clearly shows that.",3,[2.5]--This movie gets a triple discount,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,2808,"['One', 'things', 'noticed', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'where', 'people', 'sit', 'mope', 'dead-end', 'jobs', 'fact', 'characters', 'movie', 'generally', 'jobs', 'want', 'be', 'good', 'Other', 'films', 'Clerks', 'Office', 'Space', 'have', 'done', 'job-loathing', 'thing', 'perfection', 'liked', 'one', 'went', 'different', 'way', 'Granted', 'Zach', 'initially', 'job', 'primarily', 'socialization', 'still', 'emulate', 'rival', 'conscientiousness', 'story', 'rather', 'contempt', 'retail', 'labor', 'automatically', 'smarter', 'might', 'expect', 'Employee', 'Month', 'intentionally', 'exaggerated', 'depiction', 'retail', 'workplace', ""'d"", 'enjoyed', 'film', 'approach', 'environment', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'good', 'warping', 'Employee', 'Month', 'flaw', 'guess', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'mentioning', '108-minute', 'running', 'time', 'too', 'indulgent', 'thinness', 'plot', 'Everything', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'done', 'just', 'effectively', '90', 'minutes', 'especially', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'where', 'story', 'heading', 'anyway.The', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'two', 'actors', 'really', 'make', 'picture', 'work', 'Cook', 'vintage', 'movie', 'slacker', 'prototype', 'own', 'inherent', 'charm', 'turn', 'Zack', 'guy', 'actually', 'root', 'Shepard', 'other', 'hand', 'freshness', 'now-stereotypical', 'jerk', 'character', 'up', 'Vince', 'buffoonery', 'vanity', 'rather', 'making', 'standard', 'hateful', 'comedy', 'villain', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'wasted', 'whole', 'screen', 'performance', 'trying', 'remember', 'lines', 'were', 'times', 'believed', 'may', 'have', 'used', 'cue', 'cards', 'Simpson', 'should', 'quit', 'acting', 'seriously', 'stick', 'singing', 'whole', 'time', 'sat', 'asking', 'could', 'director', 'right', 'mind', 'let', 'performance', 'end', 'up', 'finished', 'feature', 'film', 'Then', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'got', 'answer', 'Simpson', 'father', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'producers.Cook', 'friends', 'are', 'made', 'star', 'supporting', 'comedy', 'cast', 'Harland', 'Williams', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'film', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'guy', 'coke-bottle', 'glasses', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'was', ""n't"", 'joke', 'played', 'out', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', '60', 'Indian', 'electronics', 'salesman', 'bit', 'was', 'already', 'done', 'better', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', ""'re"", 'forced', 'laugh', 'yet', 'joke', 'midget', 'authority', 'figure', 'will', 'agree', 'midgets', 'are', 'funny', 'screen', 'play', 'type', 'old', 'done', 'movie', 'have', 'couple', 'loud', 'moments', 'involving', 'piece-of-crap', 'Honda', 'race', 'sequence', 'clean', 'up', 'spill', 'isle', '6', 'again', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Employee', 'Month', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'almost', 'level', 'box', 'office', 'clearly']",N/A

1037728,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000LC3ICE,K. Driscoll,"[2, 6]","Let me start my review of Employee of the Month by saying that I don't think Dane Cook is a great comic.  Despite being impeccably well marketed Cook is not a self-stylized comic and furthermore, he is a horrible actor.  On the flip side for Cook, he is quite lucky to work with Jessica Simpson, who stars as his love interest in this movie, and she is actually even worse.  Even worse than that; the film is directed by Gregory Coolidge who is responsible for writing one of the worse films in recent years,Sorority Boys.  And even further down the spiral of disappointment we find that Employee of the Month was a financial success and this whole multitude of mediocre talent will continue to make the big bucks.Zach (Cook) works at Super Club as a box-boy, which is apparently the worse thing you can be.  Super Club is a fictional version of wholesale warehouse companies like BJ's, Costco or Sam's Club.  Zach is intentionally an underachiever and quietly mocks the heroics of Vince (Dax Shepard) with his friends played by comedians Harland Williams, Brian George, and Andy Dick.  Vince is the head cashier and constant winner of the employee of the month honors.  Zach is re-invigorated when Super Club gets a new cashier named Amy (Simpson).  Amy likes guys who win employee of the month so Zach needs to pick it up and compete with Vince.The story is flat and senseless, and that would be alright with me if I found that the story served as a vehicle for laughs, but it doesn't.  I will say that Dax Shepard does a fine job in his role as the film's villain Vince, so much so I wanted him to come out on top in the end.  The supporting cast is very annoying, especially Andy Dick and Harland Williams, who are normally at least moderately amusing.  The performance of Simpson was rightfully chosen for a Golden Raspberry nomination for worse actress but she lost out to Sharon Stone inBasic Instinct 2.  No matter, she'll get more roles and land a Razzie at some point.This is a movie littered with random and blunt toilet humor that is just dull and remarkably uncreative.

In some cases, this actually propels the story (see Sandler's ""Click"").  In others, it comes across as a cheesy afterthought.  Employee of the Month is the latter, a flick that would've worked much better if it had dumped the cheese.Dane Cook (the ever-more-renowned college-circuit comic) hides behind himself as Zack, a box boy at the buy-in-bulk megastore Super Club.  He's happy coasting by until the store gets a new cashier, Amy (played with perma-grin by Jessica Simpson).  Discovering that Amy had a thing for the Employee of the Month at her last job, Zack enters into a contest for the title with the store's current Alpha Male, head cashier Vince (Dax Shepard, providing us with one of the movie's only interesting characters).Zack is both helped and hindered by a host of marginally humorous supporting characters.  There's a woefully underused Andy Dick playing the sight-challenged Lon, Efren Ramirez as Jorge (a character that is far, far, far too similar to his Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite), and Harland William -- whimsically weird as always -- has some of the best lines as a stocker named Russell (""She'll slide into the sack quicker than a singed Koala looking for an all-night burn center"").Zack's quest involves the typical ups-and-downs, some easily forecast misunderstandings, and his losing sight of What Really Matters.  All of this while he deals with Vince's uninspired machinations and the whims of an easily-spooked boss named Glen Gary (the store is owned by his older brother, Glen Ross -- a Mamet reference in a Jessica Simpson movie; try wrapping your head around that one).The end result, I'm afraid, is much less than the sum of its parts, and that's due mostly to the film's fear of being too inappropriate.  The premise is hammy enough without dialogue that pulls so many punches, and without a story that arcs so carefully around a Lesson To Be Learned (in this case: be loyal to your friends ... or don't be afraid to take risks ... or always be yourself ... or be yourself by taking the risk to stay loyal to your friends.

And judging by her wardrobe, Jessica Simpson's chest is the other key topic. The better to distract you from her acting, I guess.Directed and co-written by Greg Coolidge, it's not on par with Jennifer Aniston's ""The Good Girl,"" but the movie does benefit from a likable newcomer in Dane Cook and a committed, funny turn by Dax Shepard, one alumni of ""Punk'd"" who at least knows where his bread is buttered.Shepard plays Vince, the cashier at Super Club - a spoof of Sam's Club - with so fast a conveyor belt he's been called ""the fastest hands in the Southwest."" Vince is a professional sycophant who squirrels his way into the employee of the month award so many times, he's now eligible for the ""grande prize"" of a managerial promotion and a ""newish"" 2004 Chevy Malibu.Slacker boxboy Zach (Cook) is the store clown who suddenly decides to compete for the award when a new cashier named Amy (Simpson) starts at Super Club and Vince fixes his gaze on her.""Employee of the Month"" has its moments. The ""cashier's lounge"" is cleverly presented as a kind of airline pilot's den of leather furniture and free soft drinks. Vince ""rescues"" a lost child and emerges from a haze of cold air that bursts out of a freezer-food door. And weirdo Andy Dick gets a few off as a nearly-blind optometrist.Cook has some of that Ryan Reynolds look and appeal: Relaxed, confident, slightly moronic. Shepherd and his ""assistant,"" played by Efren Ramirez are a good duo. The rest of the movie is copied, chapter and verse, from The Book of Sandler: Profane elderly women, a bullying dwarf, random shots at immigrants and gays, and, of course, the ""lesson"" of personal pride and self-discovery.But let's get one thing straight: Jessica Simpson seems nice enough, even if she marches to Daddy's drum in her music career and personal life. Maybe Pops put her up to this, because you're not going to see a more uncomfortable performance this fall. It's not that Simpson can't act - she does not appear to know how. Her looks and reactions come off as inquisitions toward her director: ""Is this how I should be?""Coolidge, possibly by necessity, keeps her out of much of the movie. But each time she's in it, she's wearing low-cut, look-at-these! shirts and dresses that undercut whatever goal Simpson might have had in creating a character.

Because of this, he decides to try try for the title and beat out lead clerk Vince.This movie started out funny, but I soon found myself annoyed by Zack Bradley's character. I felt his motivation for wanting to win, and his change from slacker to star employee unconvincing. Zack changes to impress a girl, not because he wants to be star clerk or has truly changed. I also felt he was a bit mean. The ending was particularly bad. Poor Vince.2.5 stars. Funny beginning but the mean put-down humor got old after a while.

And to top it off, it is completely unoriginal.  If this movie had been made 10 years ago, you can be sure Sandler would have starred in it.  It borrrows heavily from his formula, most notably Happy Gilmore.Now I enjoyed Happy Gilmore, I think it's one of Sandler's better early comedies.  But I despised watching this movie rip scene after scene out of it.  Dane is Happy, while Dax Sheppard is Shooter McGavin, the favored employee to win employee of the month for the 18th month in a row.  And Jessica Simpson plays the Virginia Venit role of the girl Dane Cook is after and believes he will get if he does in fact win employee of the month.Everything is stolen.  The scene where Happy takes Virginia to the ice rink and the zamboni driver sings and the lights come down low, it's in here but takes place with a janitor's floor sweeper in the wholesale warehouse they work at.  The scene where Happy is starting to steal Shooter's thunder and attract more of a crowd when he tees off is in here, except he attracts more customers around his checkout.  The scene where Shooter is secretly practicing how to swing like Happy is in here, except it's Dax trying to wheel around on shoe skates the way Dane does.  We are even treated to Dane's foul mouthed grandma, and by far the most blatant ripoff (or ""homage"" as I'm sure they would put it) is when Dax sings I Want To Kiss You All Over by No Mercy.  The only thing missing is a fist fight with Alex Trebek, or perhaps Pat Sajak.Dane Cook is pretty funny in his stand up, but if you weren't a Cook fan before, I don't think this movie would help convert anybody.  He just doesn't have anything funny to do or say in this.  And Jessica Simpson... well she's not as bad in this as she was in Dukes of Hazzard, I'll give her that, but it's probably just because she dropped the fake southern accent.  This is the first thing I've seen Dax in, and I can't say he was terrible, but not good enough to make me want to go see another movie with him in it.It's a dumb comedy so, of course, it's completely predictable, but it's just not funny, so what's the point?  If you don't have a preference between Cook and Sandler, just watch Happy Gilmore instead.  At least then you're not getting sloppy seconds.",1,"Hey Adam Sandler, Dane Cook is starring in your movie!",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,2354,"['Employee', 'month', 'waste', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'effort', 'film', 'talent', 'hardly', 'name', 'top', 'off', 'completely', 'unoriginal', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'made', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'Sandler', 'would', 'have', 'starred', 'heavily', 'formula', 'most', 'notably', 'Happy', 'Gilmore.Now', 'enjoyed', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'think', 'one', 'Sandler', 'better', 'early', 'comedies', 'despised', 'watching', 'movie', 'rip', 'scene', 'scene', 'Dane', 'Happy', 'Dax', 'Sheppard', 'Shooter', 'McGavin', 'favored', 'employee', 'win', 'employee', 'month', '18th', 'month', 'row', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Virginia', 'Venit', 'role', 'girl', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'will', 'get', 'fact', 'win', 'employee', 'month.Everything', 'stolen', 'scene', 'where', 'Happy', 'Virginia', 'ice', 'rink', 'zamboni', 'driver', 'sings', 'lights', 'come', 'down', 'low', 'here', 'place', 'janitor', 'floor', 'sweeper', 'wholesale', 'warehouse', 'work', 'scene', 'where', 'Happy', 'starting', 'steal', 'Shooter', 'thunder', 'attract', 'more', 'crowd', 'when', 'off', 'here', 'more', 'customers', 'checkout', 'scene', 'where', 'Shooter', 'secretly', 'practicing', 'how', 'swing', 'Happy', 'here', 'Dax', 'trying', 'wheel', 'around', 'shoe', 'way', 'Dane', 'are', 'even', 'treated', 'Dane', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'grandma', 'far', 'most', 'blatant', 'ripoff', 'homage', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'put', 'when', 'Dax', 'sings', 'Want', 'Kiss', 'Mercy', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'fist', 'fight', 'Alex', 'Trebek', 'perhaps', 'Pat', 'Sajak.Dane', 'Cook', 'pretty', 'funny', 'stand', 'up', 'were', ""n't"", 'Cook', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'help', 'convert', 'anybody', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'funny', 'do', 'say', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'well', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', ""'ll"", 'give', 'probably', 'just', 'dropped', 'fake', 'southern', 'accent', 'first', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dax', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'terrible', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'it.It', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'so', 'course', 'completely', 'predictable', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'what', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'preference', 'Cook', 'Sandler', 'just', 'watch', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'instead', 'least', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'sloppy', 'seconds']",N/A

I think this movie spoofs all of those ""try to beat the golden boy"" kinds of comedy. Dane Cook was at his best in this one as a slacker with a good heart, and Dax Sheperd as the ""golden boy"" is very funny as the obnoxious head cashier. Shepherd is employee of the month seventeen months in a row at the super store Super Club. Jessica Simpson is a new transfer in and Cook believes the way to her heart is to beat Shepherd and become employee of the month. Andy Dick and Harlan Williams add some more comic relief as fellow employees. All in all I feel this one is a keeper since Hollywood has not been producing many good comedies lately.
