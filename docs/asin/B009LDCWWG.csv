If you're a fan of the show, this season still has all the horror, mystery, twists and the endless love triangle. But what made this season so special was Elena's transition as a vampire (I was looking forward to see how that change would affect everyone), and it made it so interesting. There was not a boring episode this season, and a lot of things (sad and happy things) happen, so be ready if you haven't seen the season, because the unexpected twists make you wanting more and more of this show!I just think that The Vampire Diaries is one of the best supernatural shows on TV right now. If you love a mix between horror, love and mystery, this show is for you. And I can't wait to get this set! The bonus features look great, and I'm looking forward for season 5, and The Originals too!Update (09/14):Now that I bought the DVD, I was so excited for the bonus features, they all sounded really interesting and they ended up being that and more! The featurettes show the most important things that happened during the season with commentaries of the cast and crew, they were really great made.

Then I later got Amazon Video, so it helps me feed my TVD addiction on a weekly basis.  It really has been a wonderful, compelling adventure. Season 4 has been, in my opinion, a journey through growing pains--not just for Elena, who has had to endure all that comes along with being a vampire, losing the last of her family, and saying goodbye to her humanity--but also to Damon and Stefan, who have both felt not only the depth of Elena's love and compassion, but also her wrath in the wake of that missing humanity. Some people get lost in the love triangle and all that entails, but I'm really more about the journey. While I am Team Delena (all the way), I appreciate what Stelena once shared and how important it was to both of them, and to the journey that is affecting all three of them as they move toward the eventual end of the series. No matter how it all ends (or whom Elena ends up with), I will always love these characters and what they endured and how they loved and how they grew...and I'm just going to enjoy the ride that had me at, &#34;Hello, brother.&#34; TVD is one of my favorite shows of all time (I'm 46, and it's a very short list of favorites), and that's saying a lot.",5,Growing Pains,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,1358,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'hooked', 'TVD', 'beginning', 'when', 'first', 'watched', '34', 'vampire', 'show', '34', 'Netflix', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Netflix', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'Then', 'later', 'got', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'feed', 'TVD', 'addiction', 'weekly', 'basis', 'really', 'been', 'wonderful', 'compelling', 'adventure', 'Season', '4', 'been', 'opinion', 'journey', 'growing', 'pains', 'not', 'just', 'Elena', 'who', 'had', 'endure', 'along', 'being', 'vampire', 'losing', 'last', 'family', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'humanity', 'also', 'Damon', 'Stefan', 'who', 'have', 'felt', 'not', 'only', 'depth', 'Elena', 'love', 'compassion', 'also', 'wrath', 'wake', 'missing', 'humanity', 'people', 'get', 'lost', 'love', 'triangle', ""'m"", 'really', 'more', 'journey', 'am', 'Team', 'Delena', 'way', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Stelena', 'once', 'shared', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'journey', 'affecting', 'three', 'move', 'eventual', 'end', 'series', 'matter', 'how', 'whom', 'Elena', 'up', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'characters', 'what', 'endured', 'how', 'loved', 'how', 'grew', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'had', '34', 'Hello', 'brother.', '34', 'TVD', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'time', ""'m"", '46', 'very', 'short', 'list', 'favorites', 'saying', 'lot']",N/A

This season, however, came as something of a disappointment. The first stumbling block came in the premiere episode in which the cliffhanger of Klaus having possessed Tyler was resolved way too quickly. There was an awful lot of potential in that storyline that just wasn't realized. Then, there's Elena becoming a vampire. It all started out well enough, only for another stellar idea to not be developed properly. Not to mention the contradictions of her sire bond to Damon. It all became a very frustrating experience to watch. Exactly what was the purpose of the new character, April? She flitted from episode to episode without any real purpose, only to be forgotten about altogether. Another missed opportunity was this season's MacGuffin: the vampire cure. When the cure was finally obtained, why did no one think to hand it over to Dr. Meredith Fell and have her attempt to synthesize more of it? Despite this season's many flaws, the talented ensemble cast never gave less than 100% throughout. I only wish they'd been given better material to work with. I'll definitely be buying the DVD release.

That being said, every show has a bad season - Buffy had the snooze-fest of season four, Angel had the truly terrible baby plot line in season three, Smallville had a dull-as-dishwater-Zod in season nine, and ... well, this is TVD's bad season. (I hope, because it's a mess and I'd hate to sit through another one.) The thing is, when the show is good, it's really good, and when it's bad, it's incredibly bad.Watching this season reminded me of reading ""Breaking Dawn."" It started out promising then turned into total crap, but I kept reading hoping for the EPIC RESOLUTION that would make up for 500 pages of self-defeating, totally illogical bull that preceded it. Lo and behold, instead of an epic resolution, I got 40 pages of pontificating and vampires standing around glaring at each other, before everyone went home; a big buildup, the promise of epic violence, and ... no payoff.In a nutshell, this is how season four of ""The Vampire Diaries"" plays out: a promising start, an epic build-up, some decent character moments, the threat of deathly peril and then... total crap. Not only is the pacing way off (long gone are the days of the series actually being creepy, and having episodic cliffhangers), it breaks all its formerly-established ""vampire rules,"" spends way too much time on unimportant things and not enough on its villain, introduces pointless characters for one or two episodes rather than using and developing existing ones, and the finale, while ""good,"" is so rushed, I felt most of it SHOULD have been a three or four episode arc at the end of the season.The wasted opportunities this season are endless, particularly the finale: the writers bring back a bunch of vengeful hybrids, werewolves, vampires, and dead witches, and you don't really see them DO ANYTHING BAD in town! Where's the hell-raising Kol promised us? Where's him capturing Elena and torturing her for days? Where's Klaus having to face down his twelve angry, undead, can't-be-killed hybrids? It's a MAJOR LET DOWN, and worse, a missed opportunity. Sadly, it didn't shock me because the entire season is like that.Breaking established ""rules of the universe"" in a series (or book, for that matter) is lazy, sloppy, and convenient, the epitome of bad writing. Here, they do it multiple times - baby vampires get the upper hand on much older ones (including an Original), a hybrid-werewolf baby is conceived, the sire bond isn't as rare as they said, and for that matter, neither are doppelgangers. Relationships are convenient rather than developed; characters are underused; consistently, the writers promise us something great and fail to deliver. Kol promises us hell on earth if Silas is freed - it never arrives; Klaus promises vengeance for Kol - it doesn't happen; Klaus swears vengeance on Tyler - and does nothing.None of the originals care when one of them is killed - and Elijah even goes so far as to comfort his brother's murderer, with nary a mention of his senseless death (and no, the show's justification is invalid, since there's a witch in Mystic Falls capable of stopping Kol). The writers then have him turn around a few episodes later and spend half of an episode trying to convince Klaus how important it is to preserve family. (WUT?)Granted, it all doesn't suck, and the first half of the season is even good. There's a few standout episodes, such as the aftermath of the Jeremy plot twist. Klaus' presence in the Christmas episode is unforgettable. Elijah continues to be fabulous, particularly when turning up in New Orleans. Damon and Elena have a nice moment together in the finale. Plus, it included the pilot episode for ""The Originals,"" which between Elijah (who, me, biased? Never!) and Marcel (who out-awesome-s Klaus by ten million miles) may be a lot of fun next fall.Will I be watching it next season? Yes. I didn't give up on Buffy, Angel, or Smallville after their crappy seasons. Hopefully, this is just a stumble and not an indication of the future of the series, because in spite of its faults, I do like ""The Vampire Diaries""... and I want to see it get back on form.Or at least have some sort of a PLAN next season.",3,a bad season for my favorite show,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,4355,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'hopefully', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'major', 'ones', '.DISCLAIMER', 'do', 'actually', 'show', 'plan', 'sticking', ""'m"", 'OCD', 'must', 'see', 'things', 'end', 'being', 'said', 'show', 'bad', 'season', 'Buffy', 'had', 'snooze-fest', 'season', 'four', 'Angel', 'had', 'truly', 'terrible', 'baby', 'plot', 'line', 'season', 'three', 'Smallville', 'had', 'dull-as-dishwater-Zod', 'season', 'nine', 'well', 'TVD', 'bad', 'season', 'hope', 'mess', ""'d"", 'hate', 'sit', 'one', 'thing', 'when', 'show', 'good', 'really', 'good', 'when', 'bad', 'incredibly', 'bad.Watching', 'season', 'reminded', 'reading', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'started', 'out', 'promising', 'then', 'turned', 'total', 'crap', 'kept', 'reading', 'hoping', 'EPIC', 'RESOLUTION', 'would', 'make', 'up', '500', 'pages', 'self-defeating', 'totally', 'illogical', 'bull', 'preceded', 'Lo', 'behold', 'instead', 'epic', 'resolution', 'got', '40', 'pages', 'pontificating', 'vampires', 'standing', 'around', 'glaring', 'other', 'everyone', 'went', 'home', 'big', 'buildup', 'promise', 'epic', 'violence', 'payoff.In', 'nutshell', 'how', 'season', 'four', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'out', 'promising', 'start', 'epic', 'build-up', 'decent', 'character', 'moments', 'threat', 'deathly', 'peril', 'then', 'total', 'crap', 'Not', 'only', 'pacing', 'way', 'long', 'gone', 'are', 'days', 'series', 'actually', 'being', 'creepy', 'having', 'episodic', 'cliffhangers', 'formerly-established', 'vampire', 'rules', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'unimportant', 'things', 'not', 'enough', 'villain', 'introduces', 'pointless', 'characters', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'rather', 'using', 'developing', 'existing', 'ones', 'finale', 'good', 'so', 'rushed', 'felt', 'most', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'three', 'four', 'episode', 'arc', 'end', 'season.The', 'wasted', 'opportunities', 'season', 'are', 'endless', 'particularly', 'finale', 'writers', 'bring', 'back', 'bunch', 'vengeful', 'hybrids', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'dead', 'witches', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'DO', 'ANYTHING', 'BAD', 'town', 'Where', 'hell-raising', 'Kol', 'promised', 'Where', 'capturing', 'Elena', 'torturing', 'days', 'Where', 'Klaus', 'having', 'face', 'down', 'twelve', 'angry', 'undead', ""can't-be-killed"", 'hybrids', 'MAJOR', 'LET', 'DOWN', 'worse', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'shock', 'entire', 'season', 'that.Breaking', 'established', 'rules', 'universe', 'series', 'book', 'matter', 'lazy', 'sloppy', 'convenient', 'epitome', 'bad', 'writing', 'Here', 'do', 'multiple', 'times', 'baby', 'vampires', 'get', 'upper', 'hand', 'much', 'older', 'ones', 'including', 'Original', 'hybrid-werewolf', 'baby', 'conceived', 'sire', 'bond', ""n't"", 'as', 'rare', 'said', 'matter', 'are', 'doppelgangers', 'Relationships', 'are', 'convenient', 'rather', 'developed', 'characters', 'are', 'underused', 'consistently', 'writers', 'promise', 'something', 'great', 'fail', 'deliver', 'Kol', 'hell', 'earth', 'Silas', 'freed', 'never', 'Klaus', 'vengeance', 'Kol', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Klaus', 'vengeance', 'Tyler', 'nothing.None', 'originals', 'care', 'when', 'one', 'killed', 'Elijah', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'comfort', 'brother', 'murderer', 'mention', 'senseless', 'death', 'show', 'justification', 'invalid', 'witch', 'Mystic', 'Falls', 'capable', 'stopping', 'Kol', 'writers', 'then', 'have', 'turn', 'around', 'few', 'episodes', 'later', 'spend', 'half', 'episode', 'trying', 'convince', 'Klaus', 'how', 'important', 'preserve', 'family', 'WUT', 'Granted', ""n't"", 'suck', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'even', 'good', 'few', 'standout', 'episodes', 'such', 'aftermath', 'Jeremy', 'plot', 'twist', 'Klaus', 'presence', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'unforgettable', 'Elijah', 'be', 'fabulous', 'particularly', 'when', 'turning', 'up', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Damon', 'Elena', 'have', 'nice', 'moment', 'together', 'finale', 'included', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Originals', 'Elijah', 'who', 'biased', 'Never', 'Marcel', 'who', 'out-awesome-s', 'Klaus', 'ten', 'million', 'miles', 'may', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'fall.Will', 'be', 'watching', 'next', 'season', 'Yes', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Smallville', 'crappy', 'seasons', 'Hopefully', 'just', 'stumble', 'not', 'indication', 'future', 'series', 'spite', 'faults', 'do', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'back', 'form.Or', 'least', 'have', 'sort', 'PLAN', 'next', 'season']",N/A

No one has sense anymore, which would make sense seeing most were turned vampires in high school making them perpetually 16 or 17 only that number is enhanced. History keeps repeating itself again, and again, and again, the same mistakes are made over and over and over and now there's Silas who can kill Originals and bring on Armageddon.Katharine killed Jeremy, Damon turned Elena's humanity off and that severed something so it can never be turned back on, Damon and Stephan are emotional nit-wits when it comes to Elena, and Elena has embraced her new state-of-being that makes her more of a monster than Katharine and the Originals combined. Caroline has a yen for Klaus but insists on playing the ""I'm a better vampire than you because I have morals"" game; although in reality, each of them are about the same as he is morally but he's been around longer and came to terms with who he is a long time ago. Bonnie's stomping her feet, holding her breath until her face turns blue to get what she wants ranting, ""I'm in control, I'm in control"", but in reality she's everyone's favorite dishrag.Don't let me forget the ""Cure"", not the band but something that can turn a vampire human, that has everyone at each other's throats including the Original family who are now bonding together again to work a deal amongst themselves and take control, but there's only one dose and you have to drink the whole thing. At least Stephan, in a heart-to-heart moment with Damon says he's noticing they keep making the same mistakes over and over and he wants to change and not do that anymore. Will there be a light? Stay tuned.Where is this season going? You've got me but the one perk is Klaus isn't the biggest-bad bully anymore thanks to Silas.

I would actually have stopped watching several episodes ago but I bought the season so I figured I should push through it.  It was a chore.  Elena has become this pathetic creature and Damon has become a louse that takes advantage of a woman who is sired, meaning she has ""no control.""  As a vampire lore lover, being sired is a lot more intense than this show is making it out to be and my contempt for these two characters are is very high.  But, finally, finally, finally, the writers take Stefan, who they were turning into a weak individual, and make him strong, decisive and more what a vampire should be.  Love it!  The best line out of any of the seasons was Stefan telling Elena she had never seen him not loving her.  I loved it!  That is a man.  That attitude would make an awesome woman too.  Why would anyone want a wishy washy ""I love you but I love him too"" twit like Elena?  The beginning of this season was too much like the glittery vampires and the indecisive twit of a popular movie series.  Why can't we get real women for the main characters, someone strong like Stefan is becoming at the end of this series?  I will hold out for awhile, simply because Stefan is so intriguing right now but, if they only focus on Elena and Damon, I'm ditching this TV show next season.  I will definitely not be buying the season until I know if they are going to make the characters interesting again or if it's just going to be Stefan saving the day for me.

As with any other successful serials, first couple of seasons are great, then the plot is extended and twisted, characters alternate between Jekyll and Hyde personas - in the end, it either you end up with apathy and move on to other interests, or you remain stuck in the world created by LJ Smith.  I ended up being apathetic.

1598140,A2FMY2ZBLKF1CE,B009LDCWWG,Zora A-W,"[0, 1]","I love the Vampire Diaries and have been watching since the first season. First two seasons the show was building its character, as well as the actors. Season three was when it truly came together. Season five is on the CW now, and though it has changed with Caroline and Elena off at college the dynamics are the same. However season five is all about Delena, whereas seasons three and before where about Elena and Stefan. If you enjoy supernatural shows about vampires, werewolves, and witches this is one which does so with young adults, other shows don't do so well as this for the young adult audience. Also Caroline and Tyler arc is getting tired. The original vampires featured in season four, however since they have their own show they probably won't be taking up much of season five. Katherine a prominent figure, though, in season five has been given the cure and is vulnerable as a human. Since season five just started the season is developing itself, it started off well but needs a plot twist soon, relying on Stefan's memories as he is trapped while Silas impersonates him.",4,Best show on CW,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,1089,"['love', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'First', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'was', 'building', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'when', 'truly', 'came', 'together', 'Season', 'five', 'CW', 'now', 'changed', 'Caroline', 'Elena', 'off', 'college', 'dynamics', 'are', 'same', 'However', 'season', 'five', 'Delena', 'whereas', 'seasons', 'three', 'where', 'Elena', 'Stefan', 'enjoy', 'supernatural', 'shows', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'witches', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'adults', 'other', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'well', 'young', 'adult', 'audience', 'Also', 'Caroline', 'Tyler', 'arc', 'getting', 'tired', 'original', 'vampires', 'featured', 'season', 'four', 'however', 'have', 'own', 'show', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'taking', 'up', 'much', 'season', 'five', 'Katherine', 'prominent', 'figure', 'though', 'season', 'five', 'been', 'given', 'cure', 'vulnerable', 'human', 'season', 'five', 'just', 'started', 'season', 'developing', 'started', 'off', 'well', 'plot', 'twist', 'soon', 'relying', 'Stefan', 'memories', 'trapped', 'Silas']",N/A
