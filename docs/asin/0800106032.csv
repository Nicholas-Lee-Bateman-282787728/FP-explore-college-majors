The first part is a flawless drama about how the perfect yuppie life changed to Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), after his wife decided to leave him with their small son Billy (Justin Henry) so she can find herself.Hoffman is wonderful: charming, vulnerable; the kid is cute an cries like a pro, and Meryl Streep is perfect as the unhappy young mother. New York City is beautiful and it's easy to emphasize with the dilemmas of mother, father and child; but when it comes to the part  when it becames a courtroom drama, the argument of each lawyer are  weak: Joanna won't be a fit mother because she has a demanding job, and Ted won't be a fit father because he sacrificed his lucrative job to care for his child.After seeing Kramer vs Kramer and the way they supossed to deal in the late 70's with child custody, as Virgina Slims would have said: "" We've come a long way, baby"".",3,We've come a long way,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,962,"['saw', 'Kramer', 'vs', 'Kramer', 'DVD', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'thougth', 'did', ""n't"", 'age', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'part', 'flawless', 'drama', 'how', 'perfect', 'yuppie', 'life', 'changed', 'Ted', 'Kramer', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'wife', 'decided', 'leave', 'small', 'son', 'Billy', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'can', 'find', 'herself.Hoffman', 'wonderful', 'charming', 'vulnerable', 'kid', 'cute', 'cries', 'pro', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'perfect', 'unhappy', 'young', 'mother', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'beautiful', 'easy', 'emphasize', 'dilemmas', 'mother', 'father', 'child', 'when', 'part', 'when', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'argument', 'lawyer', 'are', 'weak', 'Joanna', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'fit', 'mother', 'demanding', 'job', 'Ted', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'fit', 'father', 'sacrificed', 'lucrative', 'job', 'care', 'child.After', 'seeing', 'Kramer', 'vs', 'Kramer', 'way', 'supossed', 'deal', 'late', '70', 'child', 'custody', 'Virgina', 'Slims', 'would', 'have', 'said', ""'ve"", 'come', 'long', 'way', 'baby']",N/A

This is one of those films that have a heart, soul, and incredible acting from both of its leads. To me, this is Hoffman's best performance, he plays the husband whose wife has just walked out and left their son behind, Hoffman plays the character so real and gutsy. Streep plays a not so nice person but you learn later on in the film the reasons why she had to leave and start a new life for herself.

161126,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0800106032,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","There are many films about the deterioration of the marriage arrangement, but very few of them can reach the levels of emotional attachment that `Kramer vs. Kramer' manages to grasp hold of.  To say that `Kramer vs. Kramer' doesn't still resonate today is a miscalculation if you ask me, for even if the eventual result is softer and or more delicate than is often the case in reality, there is so much truth in every frame that one can't help but draw comparisons to similar situations today.The film tells the story of Ted Kramer, a successful advertising executive who just landed a huge account and a big promotion.  His joyful celebration is cut short when he arrives home to find his wife Joanna packed and ready to leave.  After a brief and vague explanation she walks out of Ted and their son Billy's life and Ted finds himself in a very strange and foreign situation.  It is clear right from the start that Ted doesn't know how to be a caretaker, but what I love about Ted is that even at it's roughest he is always a father, for his love for Billy shines through even his most extreme shortcomings.  As the months pass their relationship strengthens and Ted winds up being the parent he always was just didn't know how to express, and Billy is better off for it.  But then Joanna returns, wanting custody of the son she abandoned and Ted finds himself in an even tighter spot as he fights to keep the son he's grown to appreciate.`Kramer vs. Kramer' plays out like two films.  The first have is a sweet and inspiring journey of a man coming into his own, understanding how to be a father and how to raise a child.  It's the story of a man who possible took everything he had for granted, but the instant his world was turned upside down he fought to come to an accurate appreciation of life's gems.The second half though is much more exhausting, as Joanna and Ted find themselves fighting over Billy in court.  The ugly side of divorce is brought on strong, and it shifts the tone of the film drastically.  It reminded me of the first time I saw `Million Dollar Baby', how the first act and the second act represented two very drastically different emotion tones; one part raising your spirits and the second part obliterating them.  `Kramer vs. Kramer' surely ends on a soft and sweet note (although it still had me bawling) but that second act is still devastating in its own right.`Kramer vs. Kramer' feels very short, which I actually believe works to its benefit.  I often prefer films that really elaborate on each character and scene and build a life inside itself, but `Kramer vs. Kramer' doesn't need to stretch the clock to do that.  It quickly, yet efficiently, fleshes out our main characters (namely Ted) and never allows itself to drag on long enough to bore us.  It's like a sucker-punch to the gut; quick and undetectable yet brutally effective.The performances here are amazing to say the least.  Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep definitely deserved those Oscars, for their portrayals of Ted and Joanna carry this film through all of its emotional arcs.  Jane Alexander is wonderful as family friend Margaret Phelps, and rightfully landed herself an Oscar nomination.  Her testimony is one of the most touching scenes in the film.  Oscar nominated Justin Henry is just unbelievably real as young Billy.  His performance just wrecked me.  His final scenes with Hoffman are some of the most tender and honest scenes in the entire film.  I remember the scene where they make French Toast for the second time (probably the single greatest scene in the film for all of its symbolic expressions of growth in relationship between father and son) and feeling the tears streaming down my face because the scene was so effortless, so natural.`Kramer vs. Kramer' is a flawless film that still stands tall as an inspiring and moving cinematic landmark.  I'm so thrilled that the Academy showered this film with multiple Oscar wins, including Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Lead Actor and Supporting Actress.

A failure at first, Hoffman learns how to deal with it, eventually at the cost of his job, until there is a strong bond between father and son.

161130,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0800106032,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 2]","This is great work for several reasons. Hoffman (an art director) is trying to get his company a major contract. He comes home late to trealize that his wife (Streep) is leaving him and thus leaving him in charge of their preteen son Billy. We can infer that at least one reason was Hoffman's over involvement in his job. (Having no time for her) We are permitted some sympathy for Streep. At this time, divorces were becoming more and more common.This movie seems to be a reaction against the concept that the mother was always the better parent if a choice had to be made. (One is entitled to wonder if this movie was the foundation for ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" but we won't go there.)Moving on, Hoffman tries VERY HARD to handle his responsibilities to his son and job. We can see that this is taking its toll on him. But fortunately, he finds help from his wife's friend (Jane Alexander).Hoffman is far from 'father knows best.' At one point, he is so frustrated, he picks Billy up and throws him. (Though on a bed) But this is what makes the movie great. He is a flawed human being who does the best he can under the circumstances. A touching moment is when Billy gets injured, and Hoffman rushes him through a busy street to get him to the hospital.The platonic love between Hoffman and Alexander is a GREAT aspect of the movie. Despite Hoffman's problems with Billy, their relationship improves vastly. An especially beautiful scene is when he helps Billy learn to ride a bike.But tensions rise. Streep resurfaces about a year later and decides she wants her son back.We can scarcely blame Hoffman for his frustrations here. If we had any sympathy for Streep, it's gone now. To make matters worse, Hoffman gets unexpectedly and brutally fired from his job. (Not a good situation in any case, but especially bad if you are trying to win a custody battle!) He lands a new job in one day. Despite the fact that he is overqualified for it, it is acceptable.One of my few complaints is that Streep's lawyer uses some techniques that don't make sense. (Hoffman leaving work early to take care of Billy when he was ill.)Without going on too long, in this sad story there is an interesting form of comic relief. When Billy asks about divorce, Dustin puts it in a way Billy can understand: ""Well, sometimes Mommy and Daddy don't get along...""Also worth noting are scenes where no words are spoken. When Hoffman and Billy get their routine down knowing that Streep is not coming back. Also, right before Billy has to leave, they have their breakfast routine down without having to say anything to each other.Overall it's a great movie that shows conflicts don't always spring from heroes vs villains. Sometimes they spring from well meaning people with different ideas.",4,"""Sometimes Mommy and Daddy Don't Get Along""",1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,2759,"['great', 'work', 'several', 'reasons', 'Hoffman', 'art', 'director', 'trying', 'get', 'company', 'major', 'contract', 'home', 'late', 'trealize', 'wife', 'Streep', 'leaving', 'thus', 'leaving', 'charge', 'preteen', 'son', 'Billy', 'can', 'infer', 'least', 'one', 'reason', 'was', 'Hoffman', 'over', 'involvement', 'job', 'Having', 'time', 'are', 'permitted', 'sympathy', 'Streep', 'time', 'divorces', 'were', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'common.This', 'movie', 'be', 'reaction', 'concept', 'mother', 'was', 'always', 'better', 'parent', 'choice', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'One', 'entitled', 'wonder', 'movie', 'was', 'foundation', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'Moving', 'Hoffman', 'VERY', 'HARD', 'handle', 'responsibilities', 'son', 'job', 'can', 'see', 'taking', 'toll', 'fortunately', 'help', 'wife', 'friend', 'Jane', 'Alexander', '.Hoffman', 'far', ""'father"", 'knows', 'best', 'one', 'point', 'so', 'frustrated', 'Billy', 'up', 'bed', 'movie', 'great', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'best', 'can', 'circumstances', 'touching', 'moment', 'when', 'Billy', 'injured', 'Hoffman', 'busy', 'street', 'get', 'hospital.The', 'platonic', 'love', 'Hoffman', 'Alexander', 'GREAT', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Hoffman', 'problems', 'Billy', 'relationship', 'vastly', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'when', 'Billy', 'learn', 'ride', 'bike.But', 'tensions', 'rise', 'Streep', 'resurfaces', 'year', 'later', 'son', 'back.We', 'can', 'scarcely', 'blame', 'Hoffman', 'frustrations', 'here', 'had', 'sympathy', 'Streep', 'gone', 'now', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Hoffman', 'unexpectedly', 'brutally', 'fired', 'job', 'Not', 'good', 'situation', 'case', 'especially', 'bad', 'are', 'trying', 'win', 'custody', 'battle', 'new', 'job', 'one', 'day', 'fact', 'overqualified', 'acceptable.One', 'few', 'complaints', 'Streep', 'lawyer', 'techniques', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Hoffman', 'leaving', 'work', 'early', 'take', 'care', 'Billy', 'when', 'was', 'ill.', 'going', 'too', 'long', 'sad', 'story', 'interesting', 'form', 'comic', 'relief', 'When', 'Billy', 'divorce', 'Dustin', 'way', 'Billy', 'can', 'understand', 'Well', 'sometimes', 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Also', 'noting', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'words', 'are', 'spoken', 'When', 'Hoffman', 'Billy', 'get', 'routine', 'knowing', 'Streep', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'Also', 'right', 'Billy', 'leave', 'have', 'breakfast', 'routine', 'having', 'say', 'anything', 'other.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'conflicts', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'spring', 'heroes', 'vs', 'villains', 'Sometimes', 'spring', 'well', 'meaning', 'people', 'different', 'ideas']",N/A

Then I recently decided to watch it, as the story seemed to mirror my own childhood. This movie beautifully captures the truth behind a good relationship between a father and his son. It provides insight into the good times and the bad. The emotions are powerful and very real, and if you have a close relationship with a single parent then this film will touch a raw nerve.I felt that Dustin Hoffman's character was played remarkably and his transformation is profound. Meryl's character seemed somewhat believable, certainly her reasons for the performance were there. The little boy in the movie was incredible and really gave life and breath to the soul of his character. It's not a happy story and it's not all bad either, it's a life story.

161134,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0800106032,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[18, 18]","""Kramer vs. Kramer"" was released in theaters back in 1979 and is about the Kramer family.  The film starts off with Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) with her 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry) and watching him go to sleep at night.  Ted Kramer is a busy advertising designer who works his tail off to provide for his family and is eventually recognized by the advertising firm he works for and selecting him to take on a major account.Excited about the new developments for his work, you realize that Ted is a workaholic and dedicated to his job.  Once he gets home, Joanna tells him that she is leaving him and Billy.  She doesn't where she's going but she's leaving and not coming back.  She also tells him that she doesn't love him anymore.Ted doesn't understand what is going on.  He just got this major account, an account that could bring more income to the family but now he's faced with a wife that left him and now having to raise his son by himself.We watch the transformation of Ted Kramer within a 18-month period, as he struggles and becomes a good father for his son while trying to maintain his job.Then out of nowhere, 18-months later, his ex-wife Joanna returns.  After leaving Ted and Billy, Joanna has sorted her life and got herself a new job.  But most of all, she wants custody of Billy.This sets up a legal battle between both Kramers for custody of Billy.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is not only a moving film but it really hits the nail on where cultural society was going during that time.  Women wanting a bigger presence in their careers and not wanting to be just housewives and also how divorce can change the family dynamics and how one would face becoming a single parent.VIDEO & AUDIO:The film is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The Blu-ray transfer is definitely the best transfer of this film as knowing that it was released back in 1979, watching it 30-years later and it's so clear at different parts of the film, that the film doesn't show its age in terms of film quality.  Of course, the film shows its age in terms of the clothing used and that phone calls were made via the old rotary phones of that time but picture quality was very good.  There were some indoor shots that had a bit more grain but overall, a very good transfer.As for the audio, audio is featured in TrueHD5.1.  The film is primarily a dialogue-based film but I did notice that in some outdoor scenes, you can hear people's discussions in the rear and side channels.  Also, when you hear that guitar strumming of the film, the music really comes quite clear and noticeable.  Overall, being a dialogue-driven film, audio is clear.SPECIAL FEATURES:The Blu-ray comes with one major special feature and that is the documentary ""Finding the Truth: The Making of Kramer vs. Kramer"".  This special feature was on the original 2001 DVD release but for those who have never seen it, then this DVD definitely shows us some really in-depth behind-the-scenes situations.  For one, both Robert Benton and Stanley R. Jaffe really wanted Dustin Hoffman for the role.Hoffman was going through his first divorce and really wasn't sure where his life or his career would be going, not knowing if he wanted to do film anymore.  But eventually, Benton and Jaffe wanted Hoffman that they moved to the area to be closer to him and work out the script for the film.As for Meryl Streep, she was shooting ""Manhattan"" for Woody Allen and doing theater but as any actress starting out, she wanted the role badly and hoped that Benton and Jaffe would allow her the time to shoot both films which they did.As for Justin Henry, the casting of his role was so crucial that his mannerisms captured both Hoffman, Benton and the crew's attention.  The child was essentially born to play that role.But what is more enjoyable was to know how certain scenes were improvised.  From the broken glass scene, Meryl Streep and the director didn't know that was going to happen, so that was a genuine reaction.  Also, to see how Hoffman would help Justin achieve his emotional scenes especially in the hospital scene was definitely insightful.But overall, you learn a lot of interesting facts from the film and it was good to see the all the major talent interviewed for this segment.JUDGMENT CALL:The film is ultimately moving and your easily drawn into the story and its characters.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a film that definitely made an impact on society at that time because cultural society of ""motherhood"" and ""fatherhood"" was changing.  The focus on two parents working, the woman becoming more independent and not being forced to stay at home to take care of children and eventually the film would be used and brought up for several court cases that involved custody battles.Granted, divorces are much, much more common place but 30-years ago, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" was released during a time where ""Brady Bunch"" just ended several years earlier and TV sitcoms focused so much on the family dynamic, father was making the money and the women were essentially housewives.  ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" was a film about a man who was the moneymaker in a top job now having to face becoming a single father while his ex-wife, unhappy of having to be forced to be a stay-at-home wife, now searching for her life and essentially getting a job (that pays more than what Ted is making).Suffice to say, this film worked on many levels because of the talents were wellcast.  Dustin Hoffman is an excellent actor and his use of improvisational and trying to make sure the scenes work was well done.  Justin Henry as Billy was one of the best examples of excellent child acting and seeing a kid through a variety of emotions - happiness, sadness and excruciating pain.  And of course, Meryl Streep, with only 15-minutes of screen time, manages to really bring out the character of Joanna in a variety of levels. Also, Jane Alexander as the family friend Margaret, who definitely brought a contrast towards Ted Kramer's situation of a wife who's husband has left her with the kids.The storyline was well-written and until I saw the featurette on Blu-ray, I never realized how certain pivotal scenes were improvised and Dustin Hoffman really made sure he could bring out the best in both Meryl Streep and Justin Henry.  But also to find out that during the filming of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", Dustin Hoffman was essentially playing himself because during that same time, he was going through his first divorce and was emotionally distraught of the situations in his personal life at that time.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" looks and sounds great on Blu-ray.  Granted, times have changed considerably within the last 30 years but knowing how much this film impacted pop culture at that time and just knowing how things were behind-the-scenes in the making of the film, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" never looked more beautiful as it does with this release.A classic film worth owning on Blu-ray!",5,"Heartwarming, moving and overall fantastic!

Mom leaves because Dad is absorbed in his work in advertising. His indifference has harmed her self-image.At first he and the boy are at each other's throats because Mom has left. Then they become close.But their closeness endangers his job. In order to take care of the boy he misses meetings, loses an important account, and is finally fired.

161140,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,0800106032,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[4, 4]","A powerful statement about the trauma of divorce is offered by this winner of five Academy Awards. Dustin Hoffman plays Ted Kramer, a husband and father who, in order to ""bring home the bacon"" is totally dedicated to his career.His wife feels neglected, ignored, alone, and forgotten. Meryl Streep plays the wife, Joanna, and delivers an outstanding performance about the young mother, overwhelmed with what she considers a dead end. She decides to leave her husband, son and apartment in search for self-development and growth.Ted Kramer arrives home, bringing what he thinks will be the best news ever. He has just received a promotion, landing a major advertising account. As he enters, Joanna delivers the news that she is leaving.As it happens in many situations, we find Ted going from the sublime to the ridicule, from what he thought was the best of news, to hearing his world, as he knows it, is about to end. Ted tries hard to keep some sense of composure for tomorrow he has a major presentation to deliver at work. But... the drastic change in his personal life starts to take its toll.Dustin Hoffman is superb. The next day scenes during his first attempt at breakfast with his son, Billy, played by Justin Henry, are some of the best movie clips in this movie, for you sense his anger, his pain, his frustration. He wants to be positive to prevent his son from having to live through the trauma of abandonment, but soon finds himself making breakfast, not knowing how, with his son trying to help, only to realize that ""Daddy"" has no clue as to how to make his favorite, French toast.Father and son soon begin to adjust to this new life, the father taking on all the responsibilities of his ex-wife, and the child adjusting to a world without Mom, where he actually has to guide his father to the right products to purchase as they grocery shop.Finally, when these two have regained some sense of composure, and life is beginning to smoothly run for father and son, Joanna returns and now she wants Billy back. Ted refuses to give him up and they go to court to battle... Kramer vs. Kramer... Husband vs. Wife...While this movie was released in 1979, it is as good a topic today as it was then, and highly recommended for any family confronted with the issues of divorce, irreparable differences, separation, resulting anger, frustration, and pain.Dustin Hoffman's performance as the father who attempts to do what is right for his son is brilliantly delivered. In all fairness, the movie delivers a powerful message, and that is that in cases of divorce, of a family breaking up, every individual has a certain share of responsibility. We can not blame one person entirely, and in Kramer vs. Kramer we find all parties facing the dilemma of how to proceed with life when the family unit ceases to exist. Without a doubt... this is the trauma of divorce performed to perfection!",5,The trauma of divorce...,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,2892,"['powerful', 'statement', 'trauma', 'divorce', 'offered', 'winner', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Ted', 'Kramer', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'order', 'bring', 'home', 'bacon', 'totally', 'dedicated', 'career.His', 'wife', 'feels', 'neglected', 'ignored', 'alone', 'forgotten', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'wife', 'Joanna', 'delivers', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'young', 'mother', 'overwhelmed', 'what', 'dead', 'end', 'leave', 'husband', 'son', 'apartment', 'search', 'self-development', 'growth.Ted', 'Kramer', 'home', 'bringing', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'news', 'ever', 'just', 'received', 'promotion', 'landing', 'major', 'advertising', 'account', 'Joanna', 'news', 'leaving.As', 'many', 'situations', 'find', 'Ted', 'going', 'sublime', 'ridicule', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'news', 'hearing', 'world', 'end', 'Ted', 'hard', 'keep', 'sense', 'composure', 'tomorrow', 'major', 'presentation', 'deliver', 'work', 'drastic', 'change', 'personal', 'life', 'take', 'toll.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'superb', 'next', 'day', 'scenes', 'first', 'attempt', 'breakfast', 'son', 'Billy', 'played', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'clips', 'movie', 'sense', 'anger', 'pain', 'frustration', 'be', 'positive', 'prevent', 'son', 'having', 'live', 'trauma', 'abandonment', 'soon', 'making', 'breakfast', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'son', 'trying', 'help', 'only', 'realize', 'Daddy', 'clue', 'how', 'make', 'favorite', 'French', 'toast.Father', 'son', 'soon', 'begin', 'adjust', 'new', 'life', 'father', 'taking', 'responsibilities', 'ex-wife', 'child', 'adjusting', 'world', 'Mom', 'where', 'actually', 'guide', 'father', 'right', 'products', 'purchase', 'grocery', 'shop.Finally', 'when', 'two', 'have', 'regained', 'sense', 'composure', 'life', 'beginning', 'smoothly', 'run', 'father', 'son', 'Joanna', 'returns', 'now', 'Billy', 'back', 'Ted', 'give', 'up', 'go', 'court', 'battle', 'Kramer', 'Kramer', 'Husband', 'vs', 'Wife', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1979', 'as', 'good', 'topic', 'today', 'was', 'then', 'highly', 'recommended', 'family', 'confronted', 'issues', 'divorce', 'irreparable', 'differences', 'separation', 'resulting', 'anger', 'frustration', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'father', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'son', 'brilliantly', 'delivered', 'fairness', 'movie', 'powerful', 'message', 'cases', 'divorce', 'family', 'breaking', 'up', 'individual', 'certain', 'share', 'responsibility', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'one', 'person', 'entirely', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'find', 'parties', 'facing', 'dilemma', 'how', 'proceed', 'life', 'when', 'family', 'unit', 'exist', 'doubt', 'trauma', 'divorce', 'performed', 'perfection']",N/A

This film touches on that trend. In the past 40 years the USA divorce rate has climbed from approx 21% of all marriages to the current rate of approx 56% of all marriages. Sadly, a full two thirds of all first marriages end in divorce.In some ways the film is unrealistic. Here's three ways that the film fails to click ...The courtroom scenes don't happen in real life, with lawyers putting the father & mother thru harsh cross examination. This simply doesn't happen. In reality, the vast majority of divorce cases don't go to trial. They're settled by lawyers in backrooms.Also unrealistic is the portrayal of Ted as the clueless father & spouse. The vast majority of fathers do not resemble this ignorant stereotype. This is akin to portraying black people as stupid, second class citizens. Hollywood wouldn't dare to portray blacks this way today but sadly it continues to portray fathers using dated stereotypes.Unrealistic, too, is how Joanna hasn't worked in many years then shortly after entering the job market begins earning more than Ted. Are you kidding me? While not impossible it's nearly impossible.Nevertheless, the portrayal of Ted as the loving father clicked with me. I saw myself in him on many occassions.

Shirley Temple won the first one, and in subsequent years Judy Garland won another, so did Mickey Rooney, Deanna Durbin, right down to Hayley Mills.  Instead of the full size Oscar we know, the juvie Oscars were tiny little things, cute and pintsize.  Too bad they stopped this custom, and instead decided to throw the kids right in with a pack of sharks they call adult actors.  Justin Henry who played the little boy in KRAMER VS KRAMER was nominated for an Oscar in 1979.  He ran opposite ancient Melvyn Douglas, and even oddly enough against Mickey Rooney, the preminent boy star in Hollywood, then all grown up and a sad prophecy of what would happen to a child star who had seen better days.Poot little Justin shouldn't have been put in this position.  If the Academy had just given him his special Oscar we might not have had the unpleasant experience of watching his career stall like a Duesenberg in Katonah River mud.  Years later, when he played the little brother in SIXTEEN CANDLES, American gasped in horror remembering how sweet he had been as the abandoned Kramer Jr, with his sheepdog hair and his forever trembling lower lip, like a strawberry.  As the brat in SIXTEEN CANDLES he rolled onto the screen like a tumbleweed, overweight, sulky, a dead zombie look in his eyes, throwing sexual innuendo in every direction, the parents' worst nightmare, as if to say, this is what would happen if your mother let your father bring you up in the dog eat dog world of Manhattan advertising.Meryl Streep (selfish) and Dustin Hoffman (selfless) played the parents, and both of them are fine, though you really, really, REALLY have to love Hoffman to sit through this picture without gagging.  Not since the glory days of the 1940s ""weepies"" has a saint been presented in cinematic form with such humorless and melodramatic closeups as Hoffman gets here, his beady eyes welling with tears that shine luminously as the human spirit itself.Meryl Streep explains that she had to go find herself.  It was a brave part especially at the beginning of a long career.  No one who saw KRAMER VS KRAMER when it first came out ever was able to look at her again without thinking in the back of their heads, ""There she is, the selfish one.  Thinks only of herself.""SIXTEEN CANDLES by the way was a much better picture than this critical darling.  As the years go by and more and more couples get divorced or never even bother marrying in the first place, the movie has lost some of its punch.

161161,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,0800106032,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","A wonderful, beautifully acted film about the meanings of love,friendship, and above all parenthood. This is the film where RobertBenton's complex humanism really comes to full flower.In a situation that almost demands taking sides - a sudden divorceleading to an unprepared father taking over childcare only to bechallenged for custody when the mother returns 18 months later - Bentonmanages to make everyone a complex human being, with strengths andweaknesses, trying their best to do the right thing in a painful, messysituation.Hoffman, who has been brilliant so many times playing characters farfrom himself is perhaps the most moving he's ever been playing acharacter that director Benton described as really, honestly playinghimself - perhaps the hardest character of all. Streep takes a womanwho could have easily come off as the villain of the piece, and makesyou understand her actions - - even abandoning her little boy. JaneAlexander is wonderful and subtle as the slowly developing friendHoffman makes as a single father, and young Justin Henry is utterlyreal in a way few child actors are as the 7 year old stuck in themiddle. It's also beautifully, if understatedly shot by NestorAlmendros.It's flaws are minor. Some of the supporting roles, while played byterrific character actors, are a bit more one note and characturishthan they need be. And some of the courtroom theatrics feel just a tinybit... well, theatrical. Also, there's a logic point that's always buggedme - why doesn't Hoffman - doing quite well on Madison Avenue, hire apart-time housekeeper or nanny to help him from becoming terminallyoverloaded by the combination of career and single parenthood? Lastfamily politics have changed enough in 31 years that no longer wouldthe climactic court fight stack up quite the same way - it's no longera rarity for a man to want custody of his children - but that's not aflaw in the film, just a welcome reminder that some things do getbetter.And none of the above are enough to detract from the fact that this isstorytelling and acting of the highest order.The blu-ray, while not a dramatic leap from the fine DVD, is stilla worthwhile upgrade.

Ladies, bring your tissues, several boxes, and men, be ready to excuse yourself when you can't hold the tears back either.  Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep bring wonderful, full, realistic performances as the young troubled couple whose lives are torn apart when Joanna (Streep) walks out on Ted (Hoffman).  Ted is caught completely unaware of Joanna's unhappiness, and is left to raise their son, Billy (Justin Henry) alone.  Much of the movie is about the adaptation and emotional growth that takes place between a once detached father and an emotionally needy son.  Hoffman and Justin Henry pull it off magnificently and effortlessly.  They become the characters they play.  While it is certainly rewarding to see Hoffman grow in his role as a father and realize what exactly is important in one's life, it is Justin Henry who steals the show.  Despite his young age, he is somehow able to summon the appropriate body language and facial emotion for each demanding scene.  Although Streep and Hoffman get top billing, Justin Henry is their equal.  Jane Alexander brings up a remarkably strong supporting cast, as the friend of Joanna's who befriends the bewildered Ted Kramer.  Alexander is wonderful, and her role is such that one is forced to wonder if a reconciliation between Ted and Joanna could perhaps happen in the future. Bringing a classic comic relief scene to the movie, JoBeth Williams, girlfriend of Ted, accidentally meets young Justin Henry in the hallway while she is in the buff.  They carry on  a polite conversation while Williams tries to cover up her body parts.What a wonderful, touching film this is.  It is full of great performances, has scenes that will live in your heart forever, and has an ending that will leave you wondering.There is some brief nudity and some sparse swearing, so this is not suitable for those under 13-14 years old.While not exactly a ""family"" movie per se, this movie holds up well over the years as its theme resonates through the generations: family is important, relationships are important, and love is the binding force that bonds it all together.kone",5,If This Does Not Touch Your Heart - You Haven't Got One,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,2162,"['rip', 'heart', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Ladies', 'bring', 'tissues', 'several', 'boxes', 'men', 'be', 'ready', 'excuse', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'tears', 'back', 'either', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'bring', 'wonderful', 'full', 'realistic', 'performances', 'young', 'troubled', 'couple', 'lives', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'when', 'Joanna', 'Streep', 'out', 'Ted', 'Hoffman', 'Ted', 'caught', 'completely', 'unaware', 'Joanna', 'unhappiness', 'left', 'raise', 'son', 'Billy', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'alone', 'Much', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'emotional', 'growth', 'place', 'once', 'detached', 'father', 'emotionally', 'needy', 'son', 'Hoffman', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'pull', 'off', 'magnificently', 'effortlessly', 'become', 'characters', 'play', 'certainly', 'rewarding', 'see', 'Hoffman', 'grow', 'role', 'father', 'realize', 'what', 'exactly', 'important', 'one', 'life', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'who', 'show', 'young', 'age', 'somehow', 'able', 'summon', 'appropriate', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'emotion', 'demanding', 'scene', 'Streep', 'Hoffman', 'get', 'top', 'billing', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'equal', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'up', 'remarkably', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'friend', 'Joanna', 'who', 'bewildered', 'Ted', 'Kramer', 'Alexander', 'wonderful', 'role', 'such', 'one', 'forced', 'wonder', 'reconciliation', 'Ted', 'Joanna', 'could', 'perhaps', 'happen', 'future', 'Bringing', 'classic', 'comic', 'relief', 'scene', 'movie', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'girlfriend', 'Ted', 'accidentally', 'young', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'hallway', 'buff', 'carry', 'polite', 'conversation', 'Williams', 'tries', 'cover', 'up', 'body', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'film', 'full', 'great', 'performances', 'scenes', 'will', 'live', 'heart', 'forever', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering.There', 'brief', 'nudity', 'sparse', 'swearing', 'not', 'suitable', '13-14', 'years', 'not', 'exactly', 'family', 'movie', 'se', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'years', 'theme', 'generations', 'family', 'important', 'relationships', 'are', 'important', 'love', 'binding', 'force', 'bonds', 'together.kone']",N/A

First, it gave Meryl Streep her first Oscar (as a ""Supporting"" Actress, so don't expect to see a lot of her).

And third, the young son caught between his parents is simply adorable!What I like about this film is its realism.  Neither parent is portrayed as the bad person, and the emotional development of each character is believable.  The acting is superb, and the film is well written, directed, produced, and cast.On the negative side, it is an emotionally heavy film, as, like in reality, the child is in such innocent pain.

How could she leave her husband and, especially, her young son?!But there were many little things about the film I found quirky. Recently I saw it again on TV. Look for the scene, early in the film, where Ted Kramer is at the kitchen table with the boy. Notice the can of soft drink next to Ted. The pink can. It's TAB. Then it hit me: this guy is gay! That can of TAB is to this film what the Rosetta Stone is to ancient Egypt. Suddenly you see the movie in a whole new perspective - and ALL the questions are answered.Why did the wife say she is unhappy with her husband? Why does Ted Kramer in a very moving scene tell the boy that it was his (Ted's) fault that mommy left? Why do we never hear what Ted did to make her leave? Why does the mother consider her son totally safe with the father? (No fear that he will find another woman to replace mommy - ever notice that?) Why does the son repeatedly refer to his father as ""mommy""? And what about that nude scene where Ted finally does have another woman in bed? Isn't there something odd about it? The woman asked him out - he did not ask her out. We never see their date. We never see, or hear, what actually happened (or didn't happen) in bed. We only hear her saying that she has to leave in a hurry. She does not give Ted her phone number, or ask for his. We hear nothing more about her. Ted shows no concern at all that she is literally out of the picture. How about the attractive neighbor, whose husband has left her. She and Ted are friends, but he never hits on her - and she shows no surprise at this. Wouldn't it be logical for these two to get together or at least consider it? Why does Ted, who is no idiot, make no legal moves to gain custody of his son while the wife is gone for months?As a gay man in 1979, Ted had to put on an act. He can't let people at the office know what he is. So when an attractive woman asks him out on a date he is trapped into saying yes. The wife knows the truth. The neighbor, who was the wife's friend, knows it, too. Ted doesn't dare start legal proceedings when his wife can expose him at any time. He just has to hope that she will let him keep the boy. (A boy who looks quite a bit like the mother but nothing at all like the supposed father.) If Ted was heterosexual, wouldn't he be looking for another woman? Apart from the obvious reasons, it would strengthen his hand in court if he could offer his son a normal family - with a daddy and a mommy. Instead we have a kid with two mommies!Remember that this film was made before AIDS - before gays got widespread sympathy because for a while most people thought they were on their way to extinction. (It's easy to feel sorry for people whom you think will not be around long enough to make any demands on you.)No major studio was likely to sink money into a big budget film about a gay man in 1979. So Ted Kramer becomes a ""normal guy"" - who just happens to act in a lot of abnormal ways, which are artfully concealed by keeping them in plain sight. Isn't it time that Kramer v.

161168,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0800106032,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Kramer vs. Kramer provides us with a timeless snapshot of what custody battles are like after a messy divorce. Although there are a few things in the movie that are a little dated (phone with dials, Checker type New York City taxicabs, the fashions, and salaries that were once considered quite good when in our times they would be way too low to afford a nice apartment in Manhattan), the fundamental story remains relevant and the issues have changed little. In addition, the acting is absolutely convincing in Kramer vs. Kramer; you couldn't ask for better--Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep deserved their Oscars. The musical score for the film enhances it, too; and I like the choreography as well as the fine cinematography.When the action starts in New York City, we see the highly stressed out Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) walking out on her husband Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and their seven year old son Billy (Justin Henry). Ted calls Joanna's friend Margaret (Jane Alexander) as he thinks Joanna will be with her friend and then come right back home--after all, she didn't even take her suitcase! Unfortunately, Joanna simply disappears and Ted is left to care for his son while holding down a demanding job when he is finally beginning to climb the corporate ladder big time. Initially, Ted and his son Billy don't always have things easy, but as time goes by they form a touching bond and they love each other very much.As time passes, Ted is tested many times and I came to sympathize with him a great deal. We see him panic and run with Billy in his arms to a hospital emergency room when Billy falls off the neighborhood park's jungle gym and requires a few stitches. Ted and Billy share very tender moments when Ted reads bedtime stories every night to Billy. Ted also slowly but surely forms a bond of friendship with Joanna's now former friend Margaret; they often chat with each other on the park bench as their children play close by.However, all this is threatened when Joanna unexpectedly moves back to New York. Almost a year and one-half later, Joanne now wants custody of their son Billy. Ted is incensed and refuses; thus Joanna starts a custody battle in the court system. Ted gets lawyer John Shaunessy (Howard Duff) to represent him although Shaunessy tells Ted it's going to be tough to win the custody battle because judges always favor giving custody to the woman--even if the woman once walked out on her own child.Questions remain, however. What happens when Ted's boss suddenly lets Ted go--how will Ted be able to find a good paying job in twenty-four hours so that he has at least a slim chance of keeping custody of his son? To what degree with Joanna and her lawyer go to defame Ted's character? How will Margaret be able to help or hinder Ted in the courtroom custody trial? No plot spoilers--watch and find out!The DVD comes with a terrific documentary about the making of the film.Kramer vs. Kramer will stay in your mind long after you see it; it's extremely poignant and moving with just a little bit of comedy that makes it as realistic as possible. I highly recommend this film for people interested in the themes presented and played out in this movie; and fans of the actors would do well to add this to their collections.",5,"outstanding, taut and riveting drama that grabs you by the throat and never lets you go until the ending",1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,3264,"['Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'timeless', 'snapshot', 'what', 'custody', 'battles', 'are', 'messy', 'divorce', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'little', 'dated', 'phone', 'dials', 'Checker', 'type', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'taxicabs', 'fashions', 'salaries', 'were', 'once', 'considered', 'quite', 'good', 'when', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'low', 'afford', 'nice', 'apartment', 'Manhattan', 'fundamental', 'story', 'relevant', 'issues', 'have', 'changed', 'little', 'addition', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'Kramer', 'Kramer', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'too', 'like', 'choreography', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'cinematography.When', 'action', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'see', 'highly', 'stressed', 'out', 'Joanna', 'Kramer', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'walking', 'out', 'husband', 'Ted', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Billy', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'Ted', 'Joanna', 'friend', 'Margaret', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Joanna', 'will', 'be', 'friend', 'then', 'come', 'right', 'back', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'suitcase', 'Unfortunately', 'Joanna', 'simply', 'Ted', 'left', 'care', 'son', 'holding', 'down', 'demanding', 'job', 'when', 'finally', 'beginning', 'climb', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'big', 'time', 'Initially', 'Ted', 'son', 'Billy', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'things', 'easy', 'time', 'form', 'touching', 'bond', 'love', 'other', 'very', 'much.As', 'time', 'passes', 'Ted', 'tested', 'many', 'times', 'came', 'sympathize', 'great', 'deal', 'see', 'panic', 'run', 'Billy', 'arms', 'hospital', 'emergency', 'room', 'when', 'Billy', 'neighborhood', 'park', 'jungle', 'gym', 'few', 'stitches', 'Ted', 'Billy', 'share', 'very', 'tender', 'moments', 'when', 'Ted', 'bedtime', 'stories', 'night', 'Billy', 'Ted', 'also', 'slowly', 'surely', 'bond', 'friendship', 'Joanna', 'now', 'former', 'friend', 'Margaret', 'often', 'chat', 'other', 'park', 'bench', 'children', 'play', 'close', 'by.However', 'threatened', 'when', 'Joanna', 'unexpectedly', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'Almost', 'year', 'one-half', 'later', 'Joanne', 'now', 'custody', 'son', 'Billy', 'Ted', 'incensed', 'thus', 'Joanna', 'custody', 'battle', 'court', 'system', 'Ted', 'lawyer', 'John', 'Shaunessy', 'Howard', 'Duff', 'represent', 'Shaunessy', 'tells', 'Ted', 'going', 'be', 'tough', 'win', 'custody', 'battle', 'judges', 'always', 'favor', 'giving', 'custody', 'woman', 'even', 'woman', 'once', 'walked', 'out', 'own', 'child.Questions', 'remain', 'however', 'What', 'when', 'Ted', 'boss', 'suddenly', 'Ted', 'go', 'how', 'will', 'Ted', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'good', 'paying', 'job', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'so', 'least', 'slim', 'chance', 'keeping', 'custody', 'son', 'what', 'degree', 'Joanna', 'lawyer', 'go', 'defame', 'Ted', 'character', 'How', 'will', 'Margaret', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'hinder', 'Ted', 'courtroom', 'custody', 'trial', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'terrific', 'documentary', 'making', 'film.Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'will', 'stay', 'mind', 'long', 'see', 'extremely', 'poignant', 'moving', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'comedy', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'themes', 'presented', 'played', 'out', 'movie', 'fans', 'actors', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections']",N/A

Seeing 'Kramer vs Kramer' was the worst/best movie I have seen about this subject. There are so many people in the world today that live alone with a child are a child of divorced parents. Same for me.Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are married but she decided to leave him because he is so into his work that he sometimes forgets about her. She was a former graphic artist like him but gave it up when their baby Billy came. Without even taking a suitcase she leaves him and Billy alone. The movie is about how the father and son have a hard time getting along in the beginning but come closer and closer as the movie progresses. He does have to leave his job because he cannot do it as well as he did because he has to take care of Billy now.In the end she wants Billy back and starts a court case for custody which she wins, though she does not deserve it. Hoffmann is a great father and spends a lot of time with him, but the courts are strange sometimes.What will happen remains unclear, the last scene is multi-interpretable.As I said before as a child of divorced parents this movie was sometimes hard to watch and that is what makes it so good, its reality.

I literally had not seen this movie in several decades, and recently picked it up, among others because of the bonus materials on this 2001 DVD release (more on that later).Several comments on the movie: I was stunned to see how well this movie still hold up. Dustin Hoffman is just terrific, and what can you say about Meryl Streep, then just about to break really big after some earlier small successes. She looks just stunningly beautiful in this film. But Justin Henry as the little boy may have stolen the film from the both of them, he brings one of the all-time amazing children's screen debuts. Also revealing to me is how timeless this theme of divorce and custody battle remains to this day, I mean, has it all changed that much in today's society compared to the late 70s? Last but not least, I found myself welling up AGAIN multiple times in the movie, just like I did way back when.As to the DVD bonus materials, there is first and foremost a fantastic 50 min. documentary called ""Finding the Truth: The Making of Kramer vs. Kramer"" (shot specifically for the 2001 DVD release). It features interviews with all of the principals involved in the movie, none more so than Dustin Hoffman, who as it turns out had a huge hand in how the screenplay evolved, so much so that writer-director Benton offered Hoffman a co-screenwriting credit (Hoffman: ""I foolishly said no, what was I thinking then?"", ha!). Even more revealing is the interview with the grown-up Justin Henry, now about 30 years old. I can't say enough about this documentary, it is a MUST SEE for any fan of the movie. The other bonus materials (trailers, etc.) are nice but non-essential.I was 19 years old when ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" was released and the movie had a HUGE impact on me.

Dustin Hoffman &amp; Meryl Streep star as Ted &amp; Joanna Kramer.  Ted is the prototypical yuppie.  His job in an advertising company is really accelerating and it is taking up most of his time from his family that also includes eight-year old Billy (Justin Henry).  Ted is so involved in his career, he knows little of the day-to day routine of his own household.  One day, Ted's world is shattered when Joanna leaves him and Billy in order to find herself.  Ted must learn how to raise his son, juggle his work and home life and go through a divorce trial.  The film is both poignant and touching as Ted &amp; Billy bond and form a loving relationship.  Mr. Hoffman is excellent as is Ms. Streep and Jane Alexander gives a strong turn as the Kramer's woman's libber neighbor who Ted feels egged Joanna on and caused the breakup of his marriage.  But the true find is young Justin Henry.  He gives one of the finest performances by a preteen in movie history.  The film was much lauded and praised and come Oscar time, Mr. Hoffman finally took home the Best Actor award after several failed nominations.

Yes, I am shallow. It's all I really remembered from the movie, other than Meryl Streep's ""I make thirty-one thousand dollars"" speech. And it's just as much fun this time around as it was when I originally saw the movie over twenty-five years ago. (I'm obviously not the only one who thinks so; the first keyword for the movie at IMDB is ""nude wearing glasses"".) I was reminded, however, of much of the reason I seem to have forgotten the rest of the movie, which has not aged well at all.Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna (Meryl Streep) Kramer are married with child, Billy (Justin Henry). All is not well in casa de Kramer, however, and Joanna runs off to find herself, leaving Ted with Billy. Ted, who has spent much of his time working and very little of it with Billy, has to learn to connect with the lil' bugger while simultaneously learning to be a single parent. Nine months and one lost job later, that's finally happened-- and then Joanna shows back up and wants custody of her kid. Cue dirty custody battle.As enjoyable as the movie is on the surface-- and I certainly won't deny that the film is as well-acted as one would expect from a cast that includes not only the above but a whole host of the seventies A-list-- but Benton, adapting Avery Corman's novel for the big screen, manages to work in just about as many single-parent clich&eacute;s and stereotypes as he possibly can. (Whether they were present in the novel or magically appeared in the script, I don't know.) Sure, he plays them wonderfully-- the recurring French-toast theme, for example-- but that doesn't make them any less clich&eacute; or stereotyped. Oh, look, here's the doofus dad who knows nothing about parenting! At least the idiotic Mr. Mom made no bones about the fact that it was idiotic. Kramer vs. Kramer wanted to pass itself off as intelligent comedy-drama, and did so well enough that it scored a Best Picture Oscar back when such a thing actually meant something. (Assuming it ever did, your call.) These days, cast and all, I wonder whether this movie would even make it to the theaters, or whether it would be sentenced to the Lifetime Movie Purgatory-- err, Network.Yes, it's certainly a watchable film, if dated nowadays, but in the slightly more enlightened society in which we now live, I hope the script's defects are a lot clearer to those watching it now. ** ",3,Not aging well.,1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2529,"['Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'Robert', 'Benton', '1979', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'wanted', 'see', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'again', 'solely', 'JoBeth', 'Williams', 'scene', 'Yes', 'am', 'shallow', 'really', 'remembered', 'movie', 'other', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'make', 'thirty-one', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'speech', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'time', 'around', 'was', 'when', 'originally', 'saw', 'movie', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'obviously', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'so', 'first', 'keyword', 'movie', 'IMDB', 'nude', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'was', 'reminded', 'however', 'much', 'reason', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'all.Ted', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Joanna', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Kramer', 'are', 'married', 'child', 'Billy', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'not', 'well', 'casa', 'Kramer', 'however', 'Joanna', 'find', 'leaving', 'Ted', 'Billy', 'Ted', 'who', 'spent', 'much', 'time', 'working', 'very', 'little', 'Billy', 'learn', 'connect', 'lil', 'bugger', 'simultaneously', 'learning', 'be', 'single', 'parent', 'Nine', 'months', 'one', 'lost', 'job', 'later', 'finally', 'happened', 'then', 'Joanna', 'back', 'up', 'custody', 'kid', 'Cue', 'dirty', 'custody', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'surface', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'film', 'as', 'well-acted', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'cast', 'not', 'only', 'above', 'whole', 'host', 'seventies', 'A-list', 'Benton', 'adapting', 'Avery', 'Corman', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'work', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'single-parent', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotypes', 'possibly', 'can', 'were', 'present', 'novel', 'magically', 'appeared', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sure', 'wonderfully', 'recurring', 'French-toast', 'theme', 'example', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotyped', 'Oh', 'look', 'here', 'doofus', 'dad', 'who', 'nothing', 'parenting', 'least', 'idiotic', 'Mr', 'Mom', 'made', 'bones', 'fact', 'was', 'idiotic', 'Kramer', 'Kramer', 'wanted', 'pass', 'off', 'intelligent', 'comedy-drama', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'enough', 'scored', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'back', 'when', 'thing', 'actually', 'meant', 'something', 'Assuming', 'ever', 'did', 'call', 'days', 'cast', 'wonder', 'movie', 'would', 'even', 'make', 'theaters', 'would', 'be', 'sentenced', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Purgatory', 'err', 'Network.Yes', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'film', 'dated', 'nowadays', 'slightly', 'more', 'enlightened', 'society', 'now', 'live', 'hope', 'script', 'defects', 'are', 'lot', 'clearer', 'watching', 'now', '**']",N/A

161190,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,0800106032,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 3]","We live in a world in which people watch movies to be thrilled and excited. It's difficult enough to pry someone away from their cell phone, tablet or PC for long enough to watch an entire movie. In order to cater to this trend, Hollywood has largely moved away from emotional dramas like Kramer vs. Kramer, replacing them with CGI-loaded blockbusters. If this movie had been made in 2014, there's an 87 percent chance that Ted would be a shape-shifting vampire with telekinetic powers.That's a huge shame.I watch my fair share of action, science fiction, and adventure movies, but most of my favorites are serious dramas. I like being made to feel something other than amazement at the visuals. Kramer vs. Kramer won five Oscars; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. Watching the film in 2014, those awards still seem thoroughly deserved.This is a great story because it's so real and believable. It opens with a scene in which Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is given a major promotion at work. He's thrilled at his success and eventually makes his way home to deliver the news to wife, Joanna (Meryl Streep). Unfortunately, Joanna is just finishing the task of packing her bags, and announces that she is leaving him. Ted can't believe her poor timing, but it's clear to us that work is his main priority.The mood changes as the reality of Ted's situation sets in. Most of the events are told from his perspective, so it's easy to empathize with his problems. His boss wants him to be available 24/7, but that's impossible if you are responsible for an 8-year-old child. Ted has relied on Joanna to take care of his son, Billy (Justin Henry), and despite his false optimism, Ted has little idea of what is involved. This is apparent when we see Ted making French toast with Billy the morning after Joanna leaves. He doesn't even know what grade his son is in at school.The charm and beauty of the story is that Ted does everything in his power to learn, improve, and be a good father. His work inevitably suffers, but Billy is happier. Ted's neighbor (Jean Alexander) was more of a friend to Joanna than to Ted, but she sees that he has changed. She's also separated herself, and she regularly hangs out with Ted while their kids play together.As the title would suggest, there is a court case. Some 18 months after Ted has adapted his life to Billy's needs, Joanna reappears and says that she wants custody of Billy. You have to remember that the movie was made in 1979, and it was highly unusual for a court to rule in favor of a father over a mother. Ted loves his son and thinks that he has earned the right to raise him.One thing that strikes me is the truthfulness present throughout the whole story. Instead of tearing each other apart inside and outside the courtroom, Ted and Joanna seem to respect one another. They genuinely want what is best for Billy. Neither of the parents are cast as villains, and the film is all the better for it. What we see is a family rationally coming to terms with the problems presented by a divorce. There's no sensationalism or anything written purely for effect.Many of the scenes were improvised by the actors, especially when Billy was involved. Hoffman was about to be divorced in his real life at the time, and I'm sure he accessed some of those emotions. The result is a brilliant performance, and Streep was effective in her more limited time on the screen. I am not a parent, but I was thoroughly engrossed in Ted's life for 105 minutes.The Blu-ray offers a pleasing upgrade and comes with just one special feature, Finding the Truth. However, this documentary does run for around 50 minutes and contains plenty of interesting information if you are a fan of the movie. The first cut of the film was 43 minutes longer, and it would be nice to see some of the scenes that were removed, but the story is tight and tense in its final form. This is why I own older movies and continually explore films I initially missed.There is brief nudity, but it's quite humorous, and not a reason to prevent children from seeing the movie.Overall score 4.5/5",5,"Essential viewing, despite the lack of a shape-shifting vampire with telekinetic powers",1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,4150,"['live', 'world', 'people', 'watch', 'movies', 'be', 'thrilled', 'excited', 'difficult', 'enough', 'pry', 'someone', 'away', 'cell', 'phone', 'tablet', 'PC', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'order', 'cater', 'trend', 'Hollywood', 'largely', 'moved', 'away', 'emotional', 'dramas', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'replacing', 'CGI-loaded', 'blockbusters', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'made', '2014', '87', 'percent', 'chance', 'Ted', 'would', 'be', 'shape-shifting', 'vampire', 'telekinetic', 'powers.That', 'huge', 'shame.I', 'watch', 'fair', 'share', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'adventure', 'movies', 'most', 'favorites', 'are', 'serious', 'dramas', 'being', 'made', 'feel', 'something', 'other', 'amazement', 'visuals', 'Kramer', 'Kramer', 'won', 'five', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Watching', 'film', '2014', 'awards', 'still', 'seem', 'thoroughly', 'deserved.This', 'great', 'story', 'so', 'real', 'believable', 'scene', 'Ted', 'Kramer', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'given', 'major', 'promotion', 'work', 'thrilled', 'success', 'eventually', 'way', 'home', 'deliver', 'news', 'wife', 'Joanna', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Unfortunately', 'Joanna', 'just', 'finishing', 'task', 'packing', 'bags', 'announces', 'leaving', 'Ted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'poor', 'timing', 'clear', 'work', 'main', 'priority.The', 'mood', 'changes', 'reality', 'Ted', 'situation', 'Most', 'events', 'are', 'told', 'perspective', 'easy', 'empathize', 'problems', 'boss', 'be', 'available', '24/7', 'impossible', 'are', 'responsible', '8-year-old', 'child', 'Ted', 'relied', 'Joanna', 'take', 'care', 'son', 'Billy', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'false', 'optimism', 'Ted', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'involved', 'apparent', 'when', 'see', 'Ted', 'making', 'French', 'toast', 'Billy', 'morning', 'Joanna', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'grade', 'son', 'school.The', 'charm', 'beauty', 'story', 'Ted', 'everything', 'power', 'learn', 'improve', 'be', 'good', 'father', 'work', 'inevitably', 'suffers', 'Billy', 'happier', 'Ted', 'neighbor', 'Jean', 'Alexander', 'was', 'more', 'friend', 'Joanna', 'Ted', 'changed', 'also', 'separated', 'regularly', 'out', 'Ted', 'kids', 'play', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'court', 'case', '18', 'months', 'Ted', 'adapted', 'life', 'Billy', 'needs', 'Joanna', 'reappears', 'custody', 'Billy', 'have', 'remember', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1979', 'was', 'highly', 'unusual', 'court', 'rule', 'favor', 'father', 'mother', 'Ted', 'son', 'earned', 'right', 'raise', 'him.One', 'thing', 'truthfulness', 'present', 'whole', 'story', 'Instead', 'tearing', 'other', 'apart', 'courtroom', 'Ted', 'Joanna', 'seem', 'respect', 'one', 'genuinely', 'want', 'what', 'best', 'Billy', 'parents', 'are', 'cast', 'villains', 'film', 'better', 'What', 'see', 'family', 'rationally', 'coming', 'terms', 'problems', 'presented', 'divorce', 'sensationalism', 'anything', 'written', 'purely', 'effect.Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'improvised', 'actors', 'especially', 'when', 'Billy', 'was', 'involved', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'be', 'divorced', 'real', 'life', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'accessed', 'emotions', 'result', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Streep', 'was', 'effective', 'more', 'limited', 'time', 'screen', 'am', 'not', 'parent', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'engrossed', 'Ted', 'life', '105', 'minutes.The', 'Blu-ray', 'pleasing', 'upgrade', 'just', 'one', 'special', 'feature', 'Finding', 'Truth', 'However', 'documentary', 'run', '50', 'minutes', 'contains', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'information', 'are', 'fan', 'movie', 'first', 'cut', 'film', 'was', '43', 'minutes', 'longer', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'scenes', 'were', 'removed', 'story', 'tight', 'tense', 'final', 'form', 'why', 'own', 'older', 'movies', 'continually', 'explore', 'films', 'initially', 'brief', 'nudity', 'quite', 'humorous', 'not', 'reason', 'prevent', 'children', 'seeing', 'movie.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",N/A

Originally released to theatres in 1979, ""Kramer vs. Kramer is one of the most intelligent films ever, dramitizing the effects of what happens to a child when it's mother walks out on the family. The film explores the means in which the father goes to to gain full custody of his son, and the ultimate outcome when the mother resurfaces to claim the child. Thought provoking and emotional, this film will leave you confused, sad, angry, and happy, which is what most films that are dramas should do.A perfect film with a cast that most Hollywood producers would kill for, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" stars Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep as the parents who get a divorce and wage a war with each other in their claims for their son. This was one of Meryl's first meaty roles and she would win her first Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The film would garner 4 other major Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Dustin, Best Director for Robert Benton, Best Screenplay, also for Robert Benton, and Best Picture of the Year!Kate Jackson, of ""Charlie's Angels's"" fame, was offered the role of Joanna, the mother in the film, but the producers of ""Charlie's Angels"" wouldn't allow her time to do the film. Jackson would later quit ""Charlie's"" the following year.Leonard maltin says of the film, it's ""intelligent, beautifully crafted, and is intensely moving"".The DVD is full of bonuses including interiews with the main cast, trailers, and it comes in beautiful widescreen format and is beautifully restored.",5,"""All Movies Should Be This Good""",1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,1578,"['are', 'movies', 'then', 'are', 'movies', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'one', 'Originally', 'released', 'theatres', '1979', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'films', 'ever', 'dramitizing', 'effects', 'what', 'child', 'when', 'out', 'family', 'film', 'means', 'father', 'gain', 'full', 'custody', 'son', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'when', 'mother', 'claim', 'child', 'Thought', 'provoking', 'emotional', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'confused', 'sad', 'angry', 'happy', 'what', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'dramas', 'should', 'do.A', 'perfect', 'film', 'cast', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'would', 'kill', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'parents', 'who', 'get', 'divorce', 'wage', 'war', 'other', 'claims', 'son', 'was', 'one', 'Meryl', 'first', 'meaty', 'roles', 'would', 'win', 'first', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'film', 'would', 'garner', '4', 'other', 'major', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Dustin', 'Best', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'also', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Year', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'fame', 'was', 'offered', 'role', 'Joanna', 'mother', 'film', 'producers', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'time', 'do', 'film', 'Jackson', 'would', 'later', 'quit', 'Charlie', 'following', 'year.Leonard', 'maltin', 'film', 'intelligent', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'intensely', 'moving', '.The', 'DVD', 'full', 'bonuses', 'including', 'interiews', 'main', 'cast', 'trailers', 'beautiful', 'widescreen', 'format', 'beautifully', 'restored']",N/A

161194,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,0800106032,TheBandit,"[7, 8]","This is a very good movie with three extraordinary leading performances.  Much has been said about the work of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and Justin Henry (who plays their son) in this film.  23 years later, these peformances remain great.  Everyone knows what powerful actors Hoffman and Streep are at their best.  So what really stood out to me was Justin Henry.  He is absolutely natural; not a &quot;phony&quot; moment in his performance.I do wonder if the film would've been even better if Streep's character had been fleshed out a bit more.  It's extremely hard to relate to her.  We don't see anything particularly bad or intolerable in Hoffman's character, so her abandoning of their son seems unconscionable.  She had to go &quot;find herself?&quot;  I had no sympathy for her, simply because it seemed she walked away from a loving and devoted husband.  I understand he was very busy with work, but he was putting food on their table.  When raising kids, sacrifices must be made.  Hoffman's character sacrificed most of his leisure time in order to work hard.  Based on what we see in the film, Streep's character didn't want to make those kinds of sacrifices.Anyway, if a movie can spark conversations, or even debates, it must've done something right.

161195,AY6A8KPYCE6B0,0800106032,Tyson,"[0, 0]","Despite being made 30+ years ago, Kramer Vs. Kramer is an ahead-of-its-time timelessly relevant sociological masterpiece depicting the struggles of divorce and the not-always-true idea that mothers are better parents than fathers.  If you've never seen it before, you owe it to yourself to watch it.  But even if you HAVE seen it before, you should really watch it again on blu ray.The blu ray transfer is AMAZING.  You often don't expect old catalog titles like this to get really really great 1080p transfers, but Sony didn't mess around and gave the 5-time Oscar winner an appropriately perfect, glossy HD release that will easily become a favorite in your collection.  The aspect ratio is 1:85:1 meaning that the picture will fill a widescreen television completely. The striking detail will amaze you.  You can literally see every thread on suits and book titles in the far corner of a room. The clarity and attention to detail has never sparkled this way before, and it does so while remaining very true to its source.  There's not an ultra-saturation, digitized look that you occasionally come across.  It's just a perfect transfer from a great source, no unnecessary bells and whistles about it.The audio quality is also nice. I'm not an audiophile as much as I am a videophile so maybe I'm not the best to comment, but the Dolby 5.1 surround sound sounded great to me.  I mean, this isn't the kind of movie where you would need or want big bass or thunderous booms, so in my opinion it is very satisfying in a simple, atmospheric way.Overall, great movie on a phenomenal Blu Ray release.  Whether you like intelligent scripts, epic performances (Hoffman is unbelievable, Streep is a charm as always), or just want to watch movies that have won Best Picture, this is the movie for you.  Just don't experience it in inferior standard definition when you can experience Kramer VS.

I bought it on DVD the other day and the latest version of it includes a 50 min documentary (worth having for that alone). So, I watched the movie, enjoyed the acting, but wondered how it even won a single oscar, let alone five! Ok, this is where it is important to remember that it was made in 1979 where divorce battles were very much highlighted, and women's careers were just starting to take off. The film is also quite short, and I imagine that if it was made today, it would be much longer - particularly the courtroom scenes which are very short in the movie. The title to me indicates a battle between husband and wife, but I found Meryl Streep to be tame and accommodating. I love Dustin Hoffman in any movie, so pleased to own it for that reason - I might add that in parts he reminded me of his role in Tootsie. To finish off, I would have to say that there are some classic scenes in the movie, but I still believe it is a highly over-rated film. People must have been easy to please back in 1979, because this is more of a 'Made-for-TV' movie in my opinion. Only buy it if you see it on sale.",2,Fine acting ....
