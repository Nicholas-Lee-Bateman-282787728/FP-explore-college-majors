1337163,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B003DC883I,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[7, 7]","Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~Darker Than Black was one of the anime watches you sometimes stumble on and don't realize until later is pretty fantastic. Going in there were no expectations since there wasn't anything to go by. It was completely new. From our introduction to the world of Darker Than Black. Soon, you are brought up to speed on what's going on. In what's considered the world everyone lives in a few years back The Gates started to appear turning groups of regular everyday people into something other than human. They became either contractors, medatoriums, and or dolls. All of which, who aren't exactly entirely human.  It's a really intriguing premise which delivers finely throughout the series.All the plethora of contractors, medatoriums, and dolls can be highly pinpointed by regular people by how they act in a complete rational plain of thought which alters their view of the world. Afterwards, in these various groups there are even more various differences. Contractors being at the top of the hierarchy have different range of powers that they can access after completing unique obsessive tasks.  The cost of using your contractor abilities is your obsessive task that is different for every contractor. Varying from smoking a cigarette to undressing in public.The contractors are always coming across in various situations because of their connection to The Gates. They are set apart from human society even though they are human. Well sometimes. Its complicated but its what is so fascinating. Contractors come off as dangerous for their abilities which they are but also hilarious in their rational way of interacting with their surroundings. Also on various occasions well aware of their powers they will allow themselves to be hired to be assassins for wealthy governments or organizations. Only making them seem cruel killers to society at large.There is widespread gossip about a contractor that is something of an enigma to even regular contractors. The Black Reaper who's real name is really Hei.Moving into the characters, Hei, is the main character that has a lot to do with the story. We are first introduced to him through a plethora of events that seem random but are in fact, part of bigger plot in how The Gates exist and conspiracy. Yes, Hei is ba contractor but as it turns out he's unique. He doesn't act at all like other contractors most of the time. This surprises most other contractors. Throughout the events in Darker Than Black he's after the truth of what reall happened in his past during a war involving contractors. His sister died during this war. Leaving him resenful and enraged. As he searches he finds a bigger hidden conspiracy connected to be The Gates of  The Heaven's Gate and Hell's Gate that will affect everyone.Now, for those of you interested in some romance in your anime there are instances of romance but they are subtle. Hei cares for a doll named Yin. She has an appearance of a petite skinny girl that is almost catatonic but don't let that fool you she's something else. She almost always helps Hei on his assignments that turn out to be dangerous. The romance in Darker Than Black isn't huge in this anime but is is there. The sequel to Darker Than Black: Ry'sei no Gemini  (English Translation: The Twins of the Meteor) continues the story of Hei and Yin's romance a little s and brings in a new cast of characters with a new adventure. Furthe revents are mentioned in Darker Tahn Black: Gaiden which is Season 3 of Darker Than Black. It's an in-between of events that transpired during Darker Than Black and Darker Than Black: Twins of the Meteor.It's important to note that this anime is very dark. While things have a tiny sense of hope there is a very tragic or more dystopian tone.Genre: Espionage, Young Adult",5,It's important to note that this anime is very dark,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,3837,"['Full', 'non-spoiler', 'review', 'courtesy', '~', 'Book', 'Movie', 'Dimension', 'Blog', '~Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'was', 'one', 'anime', 'watches', 'sometimes', 'stumble', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'later', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'Going', 'were', 'expectations', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'go', 'was', 'completely', 'new', 'introduction', 'world', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'Soon', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'speed', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'considered', 'world', 'everyone', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Gates', 'started', 'appear', 'turning', 'groups', 'regular', 'everyday', 'people', 'something', 'other', 'human', 'became', 'contractors', 'medatoriums', 'dolls', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'entirely', 'human', 'really', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'finely', 'series.All', 'plethora', 'contractors', 'medatoriums', 'dolls', 'can', 'be', 'highly', 'pinpointed', 'regular', 'people', 'how', 'act', 'complete', 'rational', 'plain', 'thought', 'view', 'world', 'Afterwards', 'various', 'groups', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'various', 'differences', 'Contractors', 'being', 'top', 'hierarchy', 'have', 'different', 'range', 'powers', 'can', 'access', 'completing', 'unique', 'obsessive', 'tasks', 'cost', 'using', 'contractor', 'abilities', 'obsessive', 'task', 'different', 'contractor', 'Varying', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'undressing', 'public.The', 'contractors', 'are', 'always', 'coming', 'various', 'situations', 'connection', 'Gates', 'are', 'set', 'apart', 'human', 'society', 'even', 'are', 'human', 'Well', 'sometimes', 'complicated', 'what', 'so', 'fascinating', 'Contractors', 'come', 'off', 'dangerous', 'abilities', 'are', 'also', 'hilarious', 'rational', 'way', 'interacting', 'surroundings', 'Also', 'various', 'occasions', 'well', 'powers', 'will', 'allow', 'be', 'hired', 'be', 'assassins', 'wealthy', 'governments', 'organizations', 'Only', 'making', 'seem', 'cruel', 'killers', 'society', 'large.There', 'widespread', 'gossip', 'contractor', 'something', 'enigma', 'even', 'regular', 'contractors', 'Black', 'Reaper', 'who', 'real', 'name', 'really', 'Hei.Moving', 'characters', 'Hei', 'main', 'character', 'lot', 'do', 'story', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'plethora', 'events', 'seem', 'random', 'are', 'fact', 'part', 'bigger', 'plot', 'how', 'Gates', 'exist', 'conspiracy', 'Yes', 'Hei', 'ba', 'contractor', 'out', 'unique', ""n't"", 'act', 'other', 'contractors', 'most', 'time', 'most', 'other', 'contractors', 'events', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'truth', 'what', 'reall', 'happened', 'past', 'war', 'involving', 'contractors', 'sister', 'died', 'war', 'Leaving', 'resenful', 'enraged', 'bigger', 'hidden', 'conspiracy', 'connected', 'be', 'Gates', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'Hell', 'Gate', 'will', 'affect', 'everyone.Now', 'interested', 'romance', 'anime', 'are', 'instances', 'romance', 'are', 'subtle', 'Hei', 'doll', 'named', 'Yin', 'appearance', 'petite', 'skinny', 'girl', 'almost', 'catatonic', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'something', 'else', 'almost', 'always', 'Hei', 'assignments', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'dangerous', 'romance', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', ""n't"", 'huge', 'anime', 'there', 'sequel', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', ""Ry'sei"", 'Gemini', 'English', 'Translation', 'Twins', 'Meteor', 'story', 'Hei', 'Yin', 'romance', 'little', 's', 'new', 'cast', 'characters', 'new', 'adventure', 'Furthe', 'revents', 'are', 'mentioned', 'Darker', 'Tahn', 'Black', 'Gaiden', 'Season', '3', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'in-between', 'events', 'transpired', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'Twins', 'Meteor.It', 'important', 'note', 'anime', 'very', 'dark', 'things', 'have', 'tiny', 'sense', 'hope', 'very', 'tragic', 'more', 'dystopian', 'tone.Genre', 'Espionage', 'Young', 'Adult']",N/A

1337165,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B003DC883I,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[4, 5]","It seems lately there are fewer and fewer anime series being brought to the US.  Part of this is due to ADV closing their doors.  Funimation seems to be the last company consistently bringing over anime (Bandai having issues too).So while there are several good quality series around, there have not been many 'blockbuster' series like Fullmetal ALchemist (I don't count Brotherhood since it is not a 'new' series).  So imagine my surprise and delight when I dove into this series!I won't give out any plot, let's just say that the story is intriguing.  The characters are complex and the main character a guy neither good nor bad.  If you like semi-sci-fi storylines, than this is going to appeal to you.  The series progresses very much like Cowboy Bebop or Witch Hunter Robin: stand alone episodes (or two part episodes) that are not really building off one another, but generally building towards a final conclusion (unlike a series like Gundam or DragonBall Z which each episode is a continuation of the last).Overall the animation quality is good, but not as good as series have been in the past (budgets and all).  Some scenes feature top quality animation and shading whereas others appear to be produced by third parties (as is often done toady - many studios hire Korean animation firms to produce many scenes - at lower quality than more expensive Japanese animators).I still give it five stars because despite the few minor issues it is a brilliant, somewhat original series that will keep the viewer well engaged.  Highly recommended!*My preference is the Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.*Also note: there is some graphic violence and blood, but nothing too gory (for those very young anime fans).",5,A Breath of Fresh Air in a Stagnant Anime Market~,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,1719,"['lately', 'are', 'fewer', 'fewer', 'anime', 'series', 'being', 'brought', 'US', 'Part', 'due', 'ADV', 'closing', 'doors', 'Funimation', 'be', 'last', 'company', 'consistently', 'bringing', 'anime', 'Bandai', 'having', 'issues', 'too', '.So', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'quality', 'series', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'many', 'series', 'Fullmetal', 'ALchemist', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'Brotherhood', 'not', ""'new"", 'series', 'So', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'delight', 'when', 'dove', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'out', 'plot', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'story', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'main', 'character', 'guy', 'neither', 'good', 'bad', 'like', 'semi-sci-fi', 'storylines', 'going', 'appeal', 'series', 'very', 'much', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'two', 'part', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'building', 'off', 'one', 'generally', 'building', 'towards', 'final', 'conclusion', 'series', 'Gundam', 'DragonBall', 'Z', 'episode', 'continuation', 'last', 'animation', 'quality', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'budgets', 'scenes', 'feature', 'top', 'quality', 'animation', 'shading', 'whereas', 'others', 'appear', 'be', 'produced', 'third', 'parties', 'often', 'done', 'toady', 'many', 'studios', 'hire', 'Korean', 'animation', 'firms', 'produce', 'many', 'scenes', 'lower', 'quality', 'more', 'expensive', 'Japanese', 'animators', '.I', 'still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'few', 'minor', 'issues', 'brilliant', 'somewhat', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'well', 'engaged', 'Highly', 'recommended', '*My', 'preference', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'English', 'subtitles', '*Also', 'note', 'graphic', 'violence', 'blood', 'nothing', 'too', 'gory', 'very', 'young', 'anime', 'fans']",N/A

I thought it was just going to be a generic spy / assassin story, with just a bunch fights and cold heartless characters. But instead I got a story with good fights, complex characters, and a good thriller setting.Before I watched this season I watched the second season, which I do not recommend for most people because I don't think that it is worth the money. But for those who do you will not be spoiled from it.First off I have to say the characters are great. Especially the main protagonist, Hei (I hope this is how its spelt), or BK-201. What makes him so good is the show never gives you a straight explanation of him until the end, and its cool to see him manipulate every one around him with his good guy cover, and then turn back to the assassin. I want go into the rest of the cast but there are many other great characters. There was a character in the show that I did find annoying a few times but I also enjoyed this character in many moments of the show.Another great thing about this show is how the episodes are layout. They are pretty episodic but at the same time they all lead to the end.If I have one complaint about the show it is that I wished they made the end longer then two episodes.

1337179,A2C2T9R7V2LRLJ,B003DC883I,Lazar,"[1, 2]","With stimulating action and well-developed characters, I would like to rate the first season of Darker than Black higher.  Out of the two installments it is the best, but The Black Contractor suffers early on from its lack of explanation and episodic structure.  While a series like Bebop gets away with self-contained episodes, DtB is less successful due to essential questions being unaddressed, and a lack of a strong central antagonist.As we watch the first few episodes, a few queries raise their mysterious heads: what exactly ""are"" contractors?  Why do they exist? What's all this talk about ""old stars?"" Where did the Gates come from?  What is Hei's price?  Why is Kirihara so useless?  Some of these questions are answered, but others are just shunted aside to no effect but to confuse the viewer.The Black Contractor's 26 episodes  build characters slowly, but effectively, in a revelatory fashion via flashbacks.  Characters who are initially neutral and even antagonistic (Huang, for instance) become sympathetic in time.  Perhaps one of the largest early pitfalls is the lack of a recurring antagonist.  An action anime needs a strong enemy to maintain structure and sense of direction, and all of the early contractors are killed by Hei at the end of each episode.  This gives each episode a sense of self-containment which runs against the feeling that a larger story is being unveiled, and did not encourage me to continue watching.  Furthermore, many of the new supporting characters are also similarly neutralized, leaving the core four: Hei, Mao, Yin, and Huang, with Kirihara dancing in the background.  With the entrance of November 11, July, and others, The Black Contractor picks up steam and purpose, but the series lacks a charismatic villain throughout, and consequently suffers.However, I'm glad I stuck with it; The Black Contractor is a good watch, and one that will stand up to a second viewing.

1337185,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B003DC883I,RavenRing,"[16, 19]","10 years ago, Hells Gate appeared in Tokyo. Its appearance also marked a new breed of humans: Contractors. Humans who have lost their emotions and gained psychic powers, their existence is kept secret by the government. Hei is a powerful Contractor with a dark past and many secrets. He works for a mysterious organization called the ""Syndicate"". He works with another Contractor, a Doll, and a regular human, undertaking some rather questionable missions.What is the Syndicate and what is Hei's real motivation?The first time I started watching this series was on the computer when I was really tired. I thought it was kind of interesting, but when I stopped watching, I forgot to go back and finish it. A few years later I found it had been released on DVD, so I thought it was time to check it out again. I was completely blown away. I was hooked from the first episode and every episode after. Every time I had to stop watching it to go to bed, I would be disappointed. I spent the day eager to get home and watch some more. I was worried at one point that when the secrets were starting to be revealed, I might be disappointed and not enjoy the show as much. But I worried in vain, 'cause it stayed good all the way through the end.The thing that makes this series awesome is the way the mystery is handled. The many mysteries I should say, are woven perfectly into the plot of each episode. The episodes start out separate, but connected, and become more and more connected as the series progresses. The excellent story is supported by interesting characters and concepts - I really love how the Contractors were dubbed Contractors because they contract for their power. So every time they use their power, they must pay a price after. The prices don't make much sense, such as the guy who needed to smoke a cigarette after using his freezing power. Hei is a very competent and cool character, one of my favorite anime characters yet (and I've watched lots of anime).Darker Than Black is a puzzle. You spend the series putting each piece into place, and when you finish, you find that while you have solved the puzzle, it is but part of a larger puzzle that you don't get to see completed. I liked it that way, but if you are the sort of person who wants the story to finish with all of the questions answered and all of the loosed ends tied up, then prepare for disappointment. And if you think that the second season will give you satisfaction, think again.If you enjoy sci-fi/fantasy stories with great suspense, solid characters, action, and thrills, then give Darker Than Black a try, you won't be disappointed!",5,What is Darker than Black?,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,2622,"['10', 'years', 'ago', 'Hells', 'Gate', 'appeared', 'Tokyo', 'appearance', 'also', 'marked', 'new', 'breed', 'humans', 'Contractors', 'Humans', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'emotions', 'gained', 'psychic', 'powers', 'existence', 'kept', 'secret', 'government', 'Hei', 'powerful', 'Contractor', 'dark', 'past', 'many', 'secrets', 'mysterious', 'organization', 'called', 'Syndicate', 'Contractor', 'Doll', 'regular', 'human', 'undertaking', 'rather', 'questionable', 'missions.What', 'Syndicate', 'what', 'Hei', 'real', 'motivation', 'first', 'time', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'was', 'computer', 'when', 'was', 'really', 'tired', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'interesting', 'when', 'stopped', 'watching', 'forgot', 'go', 'back', 'finish', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'found', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'again', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'was', 'hooked', 'first', 'episode', 'episode', 'Every', 'time', 'had', 'stop', 'watching', 'go', 'bed', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'spent', 'day', 'eager', 'get', 'home', 'watch', 'more', 'was', 'worried', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'secrets', 'were', 'starting', 'be', 'revealed', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'enjoy', 'show', 'much', 'worried', 'vain', 'stayed', 'good', 'way', 'end.The', 'thing', 'series', 'awesome', 'way', 'mystery', 'handled', 'many', 'mysteries', 'should', 'say', 'are', 'woven', 'perfectly', 'plot', 'episode', 'episodes', 'start', 'out', 'separate', 'connected', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'connected', 'series', 'excellent', 'story', 'supported', 'interesting', 'characters', 'concepts', 'really', 'love', 'how', 'Contractors', 'were', 'dubbed', 'Contractors', 'contract', 'power', 'So', 'time', 'use', 'power', 'must', 'pay', 'price', 'prices', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'such', 'guy', 'who', 'needed', 'smoke', 'cigarette', 'using', 'freezing', 'power', 'Hei', 'very', 'competent', 'cool', 'character', 'one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'characters', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lots', 'anime', '.Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'puzzle', 'spend', 'series', 'putting', 'piece', 'place', 'when', 'finish', 'find', 'have', 'solved', 'puzzle', 'part', 'larger', 'puzzle', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'completed', 'liked', 'way', 'are', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'story', 'finish', 'questions', 'answered', 'loosed', 'ends', 'tied', 'up', 'then', 'prepare', 'disappointment', 'think', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'give', 'satisfaction', 'think', 'enjoy', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'stories', 'great', 'suspense', 'solid', 'characters', 'action', 'thrills', 'then', 'give', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
