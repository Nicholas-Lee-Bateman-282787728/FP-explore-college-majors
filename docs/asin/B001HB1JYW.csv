The cast is very likeable, the humor is good-natured, and the overall tone is just goofy and fun.  In many ways this reminded me of 80s comedies like Better Off Dead or some of John Hughes stuff like 16 Candles, back when comedies didn't rely on extreme gross-out gags and in-your-face obscenity to generate laughs.  In fact, whenever an off-color word or phrase is used in Ping Pong Playa it is effectively bleeped out by the sound of a bouncing ball - a very random running gag that nevertheless made me laugh out loud more than once.  In this story about an underachieving wanna-be baller who finally has a shot at redeeming himself in the eyes of his family & his community via a local ping pong competition, you get a nice mix of satire (sports movies get their send-up through the dramatic come-from-behind ping pong tournament climax), cultural humor, very mild family dysfunction, and very mild teen angst as the bases for what ends up being a winning comedy.  If you're in the mood for a sweet comedy that forgoes the usual cheap-laughs raunch and succeeds instead with charm and wit, give this one a shot.",4,Very Likeable Little Flick,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1215,"['What', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Had', 'never', 'heard', 'watched', 'lark', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'cast', 'very', 'likeable', 'humor', 'good-natured', 'overall', 'tone', 'just', 'goofy', 'fun', 'many', 'ways', 'reminded', '80s', 'comedies', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'John', 'Hughes', 'stuff', '16', 'Candles', 'back', 'when', 'comedies', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'extreme', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'in-your-face', 'obscenity', 'generate', 'laughs', 'fact', 'whenever', 'off-color', 'word', 'phrase', 'used', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'Playa', 'effectively', 'bleeped', 'out', 'sound', 'bouncing', 'ball', 'very', 'random', 'running', 'gag', 'nevertheless', 'made', 'loud', 'more', 'once', 'story', 'underachieving', 'wanna-be', 'baller', 'who', 'finally', 'shot', 'redeeming', 'eyes', 'family', 'community', 'local', 'ping', 'pong', 'competition', 'get', 'nice', 'mix', 'satire', 'sports', 'movies', 'get', 'send-up', 'dramatic', 'come-from-behind', 'ping', 'pong', 'tournament', 'climax', 'cultural', 'humor', 'very', 'mild', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'very', 'mild', 'teen', 'angst', 'bases', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'winning', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'mood', 'sweet', 'comedy', 'usual', 'cheap-laughs', 'raunch', 'instead', 'charm', 'wit', 'give', 'one', 'shot']",N/A

This movie has the best storyline, actors, and scenes. There isn't any big special effects, this movie is all story and acting talent.The story itself is about Chris, an Asian American guy that wants to be a pro basketball player. He is not your stereotypical Asian guy. He isn't very smart, shy, or soft spoken. He says that in the movie too. lol He tells you what he wants! He wants to be a BALLER! Even though it didn't happen that way, he found out that he has natural talent in ping pong and starts competing in it. This all is very entertaining and has plenty of jokes with it. He then falls for the main cast gal and pursuit to win her over. The interaction with each other is very funny and witty ever time.I got to say, this is a must see if you like watching Asian American films.",5,The Best Asian American film I seen yet!,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,921,"['Wow', 'very', 'best', 'Asian', 'American', 'film', 'seen', 'yet', 'seen', 'lot', 'bad', 'ones', 'What', 'Rice', 'Living', 'Tokyo', 'Time', 'movie', 'best', 'storyline', 'actors', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'story', 'acting', 'talent.The', 'story', 'Chris', 'Asian', 'American', 'guy', 'be', 'pro', 'basketball', 'player', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'Asian', 'guy', ""n't"", 'very', 'smart', 'shy', 'soft', 'spoken', 'movie', 'too', 'what', 'be', 'BALLER', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'found', 'out', 'natural', 'talent', 'ping', 'pong', 'competing', 'very', 'entertaining', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'then', 'main', 'cast', 'gal', 'pursuit', 'win', 'over', 'interaction', 'other', 'very', 'funny', 'witty', 'ever', 'time.I', 'got', 'say', 'must', 'see', 'like', 'watching', 'Asian', 'American', 'films']",N/A

Lazy at home, unable to hold a job, and with no real goals in life, C-Dub's life changes when a car accident sidelines both his ping pong champion brother, and his mother - who teaches kids ping pong at a local youth center. When C-Dub is forced to take over her ping pong lessons, he bucks every form of responsibility at first ... but eventually gets into working with the kids he teaches, and even starts wondering if he could possibly even defend his brother's titles in the upcoming ping pong championship games. Funny, charming, and with an undeniably lovable lead character in C-Dub (thanks to Jimmy Tsai), this is a sweet, funny ""Little Engine That Could"" story that will charm and satisfy.",5,"The perfect blend of comedy, drama, action ... and ping pong!!",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,948,"['little', 'pretty', 'darned', 'funny', 'movie', 'one', 'biggest', 'hearts', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'find', 'centering', 'around', 'Chinese', 'slacker', 'Christopher', 'C-Dub', 'Wang', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'playing', 'pro', 'basketball', 'otherwise', 'just', 'sleepwalking', 'life', 'Lazy', 'home', 'unable', 'hold', 'job', 'real', 'goals', 'life', 'C-Dub', 'life', 'changes', 'when', 'car', 'accident', 'sidelines', 'ping', 'pong', 'champion', 'brother', 'mother', 'who', 'kids', 'ping', 'pong', 'local', 'youth', 'center', 'When', 'C-Dub', 'forced', 'take', 'over', 'ping', 'pong', 'lessons', 'form', 'responsibility', 'first', 'eventually', 'working', 'kids', 'even', 'starts', 'wondering', 'could', 'possibly', 'even', 'defend', 'brother', 'titles', 'upcoming', 'ping', 'pong', 'championship', 'games', 'Funny', 'charming', 'undeniably', 'lovable', 'lead', 'character', 'C-Dub', 'thanks', 'Jimmy', 'Tsai', 'sweet', 'funny', 'Little', 'Engine', 'Could', 'story', 'will', 'charm', 'satisfy']",N/A
