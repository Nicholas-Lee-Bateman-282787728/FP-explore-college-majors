686917,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005V3Z4,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 3]","It is hard to describe the plot of 'Donnie Darko' without making the movie seem repellant.  'Donnie Darko' is purposely ambivalent, and the causality of bizarre events is intriguing from the very start.  The journal development is a retro trip in itself.  Using footage of the Dukakis and Bush (I) debates before the 1988 election, the movie authenticates its setting of a high school near the end of the eighties.  How they manage to mix nostalgia with an eerie tale and dark manifestations is a mystery, but they pull it off.  Uniquely enigmatic with the memories they elicit, the movie has the effect of being a 'Twilight Zone' manifestation of 'Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.' (Aptly, the soundtrack draws from ""Tears for Fears"" instead of ""Bow Wow Wow"".)Now about the story.  Our titled tortured protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal in another talented role) is undergoing psychiatric care complete with medication.  The first hint we have that things aren't going well is when an ominous voice summons Donnie out of bed to meet him somewhere in the dark.  What we discover there on a golf green is a six-foot rabbit, who, if his processed voice weren't so menacing, could only be dismissed with chuckles.  (One can only describe the creature as a rabid or demonic 'Harvey'.)  And, indeed, our best evidence of a demonic presence  is when Donnie asks him later, ""Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?""  To which the voice quickly replies, ""Why are you wearing that stupid human suit?"")  Here he announces to the disturbed adolescent that the world is going to end in approximately a month--Halloween 1988--to be exact.  After that we get varying degrees of maladjustment with some foreboding events.  Upon his return home he discovers he narrowly escaped death when an airplane part fell through his bedroom, leveling much of the house.  A grateful Donnie will do anything for ""Frank,"" who saved him from the debacle.  From there a series of inexplicable events take place that leave one glued to the screen with magnetic interest.'Donnie Darko' is a mysterious and disturbing alternative movie.  Some of the draw comes with the acting.  Keeping it real is no short order.  The scenes of hypnosis are mesmerizing with Dr. Therman (played with expert delicacy by Katherine Ross) who tries to uncover Donnie's pathology.  But it isn't that easy.  In the meanwhile, Donnie, himself, seeks a teacher at his private school and an elderly woman down the road who has written a book about time travel.  Dabbling with penetrating thoughts about predestination and the occult, Donnie's predicament is fascinating.  Drew Barrymore, whose mere presence could singularly bring flashbacks of the eighties, is the producer and plays lively English teacher, Karen Pomeroy, a character who provides a pivotal place for social commentary.  (Besides a mysterious mood piece, some satire is accessible.)  On the staff is stalwart moral zealot, Mrs. Farmer, who is almost painted in clown white during her ignorant tirades.  There's also preacher-like motivational speaker, Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze who makes his character creepy enough) who has a few skeletons in his own closet.'Donnie Darko' deserves accolades for being so original.  With effective performances that include the delicious novelty of having Donnie's sister played by real-life sister Maggie Gyllenhaal, the elements speak for themselves.  Nevertheless, the overall effect is not as satisying as the creativity, and the story leaves some gaping holes that, while like real life, are unsettling nonetheless.  'Donnie Darko' will fill a black hole for teenagers who will relate to some of Donnie's difficulties that beg for meaning.  (Recommended for a different sort of movie adventure.)",4,'Through a Glass Darkly',1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,3750,"['hard', 'describe', 'plot', ""'Donnie"", 'Darko', 'making', 'movie', 'seem', 'repellant', 'Darko', 'purposely', 'ambivalent', 'causality', 'bizarre', 'events', 'intriguing', 'very', 'start', 'journal', 'development', 'retro', 'trip', 'Using', 'footage', 'Dukakis', 'Bush', '1988', 'election', 'movie', 'setting', 'high', 'school', 'end', 'eighties', 'How', 'manage', 'mix', 'nostalgia', 'eerie', 'tale', 'dark', 'manifestations', 'mystery', 'pull', 'off', 'Uniquely', 'enigmatic', 'memories', 'elicit', 'movie', 'effect', 'being', ""'Twilight"", 'Zone', 'manifestation', ""'Romy"", 'Michelle', 'High', 'School', 'Reunion', 'Aptly', 'soundtrack', 'draws', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'instead', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'Now', 'story', 'titled', 'tortured', 'protagonist', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'talented', 'role', 'undergoing', 'psychiatric', 'care', 'complete', 'medication', 'first', 'hint', 'have', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'well', 'when', 'ominous', 'voice', 'summons', 'Donnie', 'bed', 'meet', 'somewhere', 'dark', 'What', 'discover', 'there', 'golf', 'green', 'six-foot', 'rabbit', 'who', 'processed', 'voice', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'menacing', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'dismissed', 'chuckles', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'creature', 'rabid', 'demonic', ""'Harvey"", 'indeed', 'best', 'evidence', 'demonic', 'presence', 'when', 'Donnie', 'later', 'Why', 'do', 'wear', 'stupid', 'bunny', 'suit', 'voice', 'quickly', 'replies', 'Why', 'are', 'wearing', 'stupid', 'human', 'suit', 'Here', 'disturbed', 'adolescent', 'world', 'going', 'end', 'approximately', 'month', 'Halloween', '1988', 'be', 'exact', 'get', 'varying', 'degrees', 'maladjustment', 'foreboding', 'events', 'return', 'home', 'narrowly', 'escaped', 'death', 'when', 'airplane', 'part', 'fell', 'bedroom', 'leveling', 'much', 'house', 'grateful', 'Donnie', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'Frank', 'who', 'saved', 'debacle', 'series', 'inexplicable', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'leave', 'one', 'glued', 'screen', 'magnetic', 'interest', 'Darko', 'mysterious', 'disturbing', 'alternative', 'movie', 'draw', 'acting', 'Keeping', 'real', 'short', 'order', 'scenes', 'hypnosis', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'Dr.', 'Therman', 'played', 'expert', 'delicacy', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'who', 'uncover', 'Donnie', 'pathology', ""n't"", 'easy', 'meanwhile', 'Donnie', 'teacher', 'private', 'school', 'elderly', 'woman', 'road', 'who', 'written', 'book', 'time', 'travel', 'Dabbling', 'penetrating', 'thoughts', 'predestination', 'occult', 'Donnie', 'predicament', 'fascinating', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'mere', 'presence', 'could', 'singularly', 'bring', 'flashbacks', 'eighties', 'producer', 'lively', 'English', 'teacher', 'Karen', 'Pomeroy', 'character', 'who', 'pivotal', 'place', 'social', 'commentary', 'mysterious', 'mood', 'piece', 'satire', 'accessible', 'staff', 'stalwart', 'moral', 'zealot', 'Mrs.', 'Farmer', 'who', 'almost', 'painted', 'clown', 'white', 'ignorant', 'tirades', 'also', 'preacher-like', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'Jim', 'Cunningham', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'who', 'character', 'creepy', 'enough', 'who', 'few', 'skeletons', 'own', 'closet', 'Darko', 'deserves', 'accolades', 'being', 'so', 'original', 'effective', 'performances', 'include', 'delicious', 'novelty', 'having', 'Donnie', 'sister', 'played', 'real-life', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'elements', 'speak', 'Nevertheless', 'overall', 'effect', 'not', 'as', 'satisying', 'creativity', 'story', 'gaping', 'holes', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'unsettling', 'nonetheless', 'Darko', 'will', 'fill', 'black', 'hole', 'teenagers', 'who', 'will', 'relate', 'Donnie', 'difficulties', 'beg', 'meaning', 'Recommended', 'different', 'sort', 'movie', 'adventure']",Donnie Darko

Christianity,right-wing politics and any form of morality that one might decide to uphold.All of this propoganda is coated with a science-fiction sub-plot of time travel,so as to not make it TOO apparent.Oh yes,this movie is so very original!Make good people look eviland evil people look good.Righteousness MUST be hypocrisy...Gee Hollywood,you certainly haven't been beating that dead horse for the past 30 years.Wonder if you can ever create something new with YOUR closed mind?And as far as this ""extrodinary"" storyline goes,let me just see if I get this straight.... God sends a man who was shot in a stupid looking bunny suit back in time to the man who shot him because he wanted him to kill himself instead of living life because death is better than living with a mental disorder...I think you should lay off the funny leaves Beavis!The dialouge in the movie also said that timetravel could be possibile if a large enough vessel was used that traveled faster than the speed of light AKA a spaceship.Uhm,an airplane can't travel faster than the speed of light;even when it's crashing into the earth.Yes,it wil travel very,very fast;but NOT fater than the speed of light.I wonder if the creator of this movie even understands how fast the speed of light is?Anyway since the airplane crashing wouldn't travel faster than the speed of light,no wormhole would be created,and so that adorable little windbag Donnie Dorko could not travel back in time.

686922,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00005V3Z4,Ace-of-Stars,"[4, 5]","Having known next to nothing about this film, but constantly hearing mountains of praise being heaped upon this obscure ""Midnight Madness"" fare, I had the original intention of waiting for the DVD release of the ""Director's Cut"" (which, as of this writing, is in limited theatrical release here in the US but, curiously, is already out on the DVD market in the UK). But after more researching & reading of reviews (including some information stating that the scenes which got left on the cutting room floor were just as much the Director's idea as that of the studio execs), and taking into consideration the fact that Director Kelly was -VERY- happy with the finished result which became this original theatrical version along with his revelation that virtually every ""new"" scene which will be presented in the ""Director's Cut"" is what's avalable on this ""original release"" DVD in the ""deleted scenes"" section, I made the conscious decision to discontinue ALL plans to wait for the ""Director's Cut"" -- either in DVD format or in theatrical release which, as of this writing, has still not played at any Hawaii venues.And so just a couple of days ago, with my recently shipped ""original theatrical release"" version of the DVD, I watched this movie for the very first time -- and let me say I was NOT disappointed in the very least!!! This remarkable little film lives up to all of its ubiquitous hype! (B+ easily!)The biggest surprise of all? -- I *TOTALLY* agreed with the trimming away of those scenes which had been selected for deletion! -- All 20+ of them! I usually go into kneejerk hysterics whenever I review deleted scenes from other films and I wind up cursing film execs for putting directors under this kind of pressure to meet some totally arbitrary ""time constraints"" for a film's length, but amazingly I did not have that reaction this time around! Sure, there were a couple of little ""bit pieces"" I would have liked to have seen within the main body of the film, but even so they were still not really necessary.And so ""Donnie Darko"" becomes only the SECOND ""Director's Cut"" of a film's re-release I would not endorse (the other being the D-Cut of the original ""ALIEN,"" which was totally unnecessary and broke the continuity it established with its sequel). Does that mean I think the new release of ""Donnie Darko"" is not worth seeing? I'm not saying that at all. But keep this in mind: If you have not yet seen this movie in its ""original release"" version, you'll be seeing in the ""Director's Cut"" what is, essentially, a ""different"" movie altogether -- because the added scenes will actually steer the story in a radically different direction leading to whole new different interpretations. It'll still be an amazing film to watch, no question about that; but it will also, in my personal opinion, actually present a WEAKER, not nearly as intense, and a less esoteric story.So my suggestion is to purchase the ""original release"" version DVD and enjoy the movie for the story it presents in its final form, then ""IMAGINE"" the ""Director's Cut"" by reviewing the ""deleted scenes"" and accompanying commentaries.Enjoy!",4,"Believe the Hype!

686924,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005V3Z4,A Customer,"[4, 6]","Summary:Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) appears to be a delusional schizophrenic with a number of other problems, including a potentially anti-social personality disorder. He is being visited, usually in daydreams or hallucinogenic states, by a disfigured rabbit named Frank (James Duval). Frank, who describes himself as a messenger from the future, tells Donnie to do certain things, including flooding and defacing his high school and burning down a local, motivational speaker's house (Patrick Swayze).While experiencing these visits, Donnie is seeing a therapist (Katharine Ross), has fallen in love with the new girl in school (Jenna Malone), is having trouble with his parents (Eddie Darko - Holmes Osborne; Rose Darko - Mary McDonnell), and is having trouble at school. What all of these people surrounding Donnie don't know is that Frank has informed Donnie when the world is going to end. Donnie, meanwhile, begins exploring conceptual understandings about God and time travel in hopes of understanding what is happening to him.The movie ends with Donnie realizing that he wasn't delusional, but that realization comes with a steep price.Comments:Several friends highly recommended this movie, describing it as a dark 'mind trip' (though they used a slightly different word, if you get my drift). In some ways I would agree that this movie is, for the most part, a mind trip, but I think it would be more accurate to describe it as a film that has the potential to be a 'mind trip'. Though this movie is about as close as a movie can get to being a mind trip, I don't think it quite pulls it off. But the reason why is not because the story didn't have all the essential elements, but because the elements that would have given the story the necessary additional information to solidify the intrigue are cut from the final version of film. The result is a movie far more open to interpretation than I believe was originally intended. The movie is supposed to contrast divinity and insanity, but it doesn't quite get there without the deleted scenes and director's commentary. I don't understand why, in the DVD edition, a director's cut version is not an option. If it was offered, I don't think I could complain about this movie.As far as the acting goes, Jake Gyllenhall is tremendous. Most of the rest of the cast is okay, but I found myself not caring that the supporting cast wasn't outstanding because Gyllenhall was so good.Generally I also comment about the fluency and logic of the story, but my only concern with this film is that too much of the story was cut (see above).Overall, I enjoyed the film, but I have a tendency to be critical of films that require additional commentary in order to be understood. I understand that some films are designed to be interpreted, but I don't think the degree of openness to interpretation in this film was intended. Sure,  the issues of God and time travel are left unresolved, but the I believe the writer/director had intentions to clarify the issues that were being raised but was forced to cut some of the scenes that would have done this. I think a good example of a movie that has enough substance to clearly raise an issue but not offer any answers is 'Eyes Wide Shut' (or pretty much any Kubrick film), though Kubrick was generally able to take as much time as was necessary to tell his story. Thus, my critique of the film is more of a disappointment; it had what was necessary to be a great film, but, sadly, elements that were necessary for achieving that end were cut when they shouldn't have been.  Though those elements are offered as special features on the DVD, they should have been reincorporated into the movie on the DVD - then the writer/director wouldn't be able to complain.",4,"Almost really good; but as it stands, just pretty good",1068163200,"11 7, 2003",2003,3757,"['Summary', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'be', 'delusional', 'schizophrenic', 'number', 'other', 'problems', 'including', 'potentially', 'anti-social', 'personality', 'disorder', 'being', 'visited', 'usually', 'daydreams', 'hallucinogenic', 'states', 'disfigured', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Frank', 'James', 'Duval', 'Frank', 'who', 'messenger', 'future', 'Donnie', 'do', 'certain', 'things', 'including', 'flooding', 'defacing', 'high', 'school', 'burning', 'down', 'local', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'house', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'experiencing', 'visits', 'Donnie', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'fallen', 'love', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'Jenna', 'Malone', 'having', 'trouble', 'parents', 'Eddie', 'Darko', 'Holmes', 'Osborne', 'Rose', 'Darko', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'having', 'trouble', 'school', 'What', 'people', 'surrounding', 'Donnie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Frank', 'informed', 'Donnie', 'when', 'world', 'going', 'end', 'Donnie', 'meanwhile', 'exploring', 'conceptual', 'understandings', 'God', 'time', 'travel', 'hopes', 'understanding', 'what', 'happening', 'him.The', 'movie', 'Donnie', 'realizing', 'was', ""n't"", 'delusional', 'realization', 'steep', 'price.Comments', 'Several', 'friends', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie', 'describing', 'dark', 'trip', 'used', 'slightly', 'different', 'word', 'get', 'drift', 'ways', 'would', 'agree', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'mind', 'trip', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'describe', 'film', 'potential', 'be', ""'mind"", 'trip', 'movie', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'being', 'mind', 'trip', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'off', 'reason', 'why', 'not', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'essential', 'elements', 'elements', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'story', 'necessary', 'additional', 'information', 'solidify', 'intrigue', 'are', 'cut', 'final', 'version', 'film', 'result', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'open', 'interpretation', 'believe', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'movie', 'supposed', 'contrast', 'divinity', 'insanity', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'there', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'DVD', 'edition', 'director', 'cut', 'version', 'not', 'option', 'was', 'offered', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'complain', 'movie.As', 'far', 'acting', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'tremendous', 'Most', 'rest', 'cast', 'okay', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'Gyllenhall', 'was', 'so', 'good.Generally', 'also', 'comment', 'fluency', 'logic', 'story', 'only', 'concern', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'cut', 'see', '.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'have', 'tendency', 'be', 'critical', 'films', 'require', 'additional', 'commentary', 'order', 'be', 'understood', 'understand', 'films', 'are', 'designed', 'be', 'interpreted', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'degree', 'openness', 'interpretation', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'Sure', 'issues', 'God', 'time', 'travel', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'believe', 'writer/director', 'had', 'intentions', 'clarify', 'issues', 'were', 'being', 'raised', 'was', 'forced', 'cut', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'think', 'good', 'example', 'movie', 'enough', 'substance', 'clearly', 'raise', 'issue', 'not', 'offer', 'answers', ""'Eyes"", 'Wide', 'Shut', 'pretty', 'much', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'generally', 'able', 'take', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'Thus', 'critique', 'film', 'more', 'disappointment', 'had', 'what', 'was', 'necessary', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'sadly', 'elements', 'were', 'necessary', 'achieving', 'end', 'were', 'cut', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'elements', 'are', 'offered', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'reincorporated', 'movie', 'DVD', 'then', 'writer/director', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'complain']",Donnie Darko

Luckily others agreed, and now we have Donnie Darko.First off, Donnie Darko belongs in a category by itself like a large number of movies released in recent years. Horror? Not quite. Thriller? Nope, no Jodie Foster in sight. So, we have the new category that I have dubbed ""Stumper"" or ""Figure-it-outer."" Other movies in this category range from ""Magnolia"" to ""Pulp Fiction"" and even ""Unbreakable"".Donnie is disturbed. So disturbed in fact, he's stupified. (Cheap Joke). He has been seeing a psychologist due to his emotional instability. Also, he is seeing a six foot rabbit. His family life is so-so, and the bindings in his family seem to be slipping daily. Like Sixth Sense, at the end of the movie, there is a shocker, and no matter what your thinking while your watching, throw it out. Thats not going to be it. But I can tell you that you will be thinking about Donnie Darko for days after you see it. It's a great movie, and requires puzzle-piecing. I just have one question: Did the world end in 88? Oh, really?While you watching Darko, keep your eyes open for clues and remember the plot points to help yourself place the conclusion when its over. Also keep your eyes and ears out for some great book and movie references. And yes, they were watching Evil Dead in the theater.

When I hold a movie in high regard, I try to wait as long as possible between viewings so I can experience the story with the same awe - and often more - than the first time.I'm not in any way knocking the fact that many people watch their favorites quite often. My husband and I are especially inclined to do that with comedies full of great one-liners that make us laugh by simply quoting something (Christpher Guest movies are a good example). But personally, I need to be in the right frame of mind - with very little distraction - when I watch an intense film that requires attention to detail.It's been a little while since I last saw Donnie Darko, and I was very hesitant tonight to watch the director's cut because I didn't want to risk having the story spoiled somehow. I'm glad I decided to because it didn't change a thing for me. But I'm also very thankful that I've seen the original several times because it was a thrill to ""get it"" ... and even more so each time I watched it.If the only version that had ever been released was the director's cut, I wouldn't have a different view about the film. No offense intended to anyone, but if you've watched both versions and are still at a total loss as to what happened, this movie is definitely not for you. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!If you're like me and you do not have every detail of the theatrical version burned to memory, the difference between it and the director's cut was not monumental and didn't change my perception in any way. Now I'm compelled to watch the original again so I can compare the two.For those who haven't seen the film: the acting is superb, the story is very compelling, and it's probably not at all what you were expecting to see.

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[17, 19]","For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre.  After leaving this film last night at the theater, my wife and I had another two-hour discussion about this film.  One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction.  This is something to think about when you watch this edition.  The ending of this film (not to give anything away) opens the door to the possibility of the genre change.  Throughout the film there are hints towards this chance change, but it isn't until the end that it becomes clearer.  That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities.  He does this by adding chapters from the book ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" to better guide us through the different phases that Darko encounters and experiences.  Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality.  This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.There are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie.  We learn a bit more about his parents, his girlfriend, and his therapist.  There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition.  I was overjoyed to see this because I felt that was an aspect missing from the original.  There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic.  This powerfully sealed the film for me.  It allowed a bit more insight in Donnie's character as to where he stands on the issue of God and the strange events that are happening around him.  It was as if the final piece of the puzzle was finally put into place.Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form.  The way the director wanted it to be.  We finally were able to see the finished product, and for some it may not be the finale they desired, but for this film fanatic it was extra icing on the cake.  The additions of some new songs only help build the already haunting sound of this film.  Honestly, who can match the remake of the Tears for Fears song ""Mad, Mad World""?  It seemed like it was made explicitly for this film.  Finally, how can you challenge a film that releases the secret to time travel?  The truth is out there?  Not unless you have seen this film.  There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film.  This was not the case here.  Kelley changed nothing with his deeply developed characters or the overall story.  The only aspect that I feel did change (and possibly not for everyone) was the possible genre switch.  It will be up to you to see if this is true or not.Donnie Darko continues to remain on my top eleven films ever list.  I do not see it dethroned anytime soon, especially with the release of this director's cut.  It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come.  You will not see films like this in the recycled Hollywood riff that is currently being released, and I doubt we ever will, so go out and buy this film today.  It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,The search for God is absurd?,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,3655,"['have', 'seen', 'original', 'version', 'film', 'director', 'cut', 'fills', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'nearly', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'genre', 'leaving', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'theater', 'wife', 'had', 'two-hour', 'discussion', 'film', 'One', 'discussions', 'had', 'was', 'director', 'cut', 'perhaps', 'moved', 'perfect', 'film', 'world', 'fantasy', 'world', 'science', 'fiction', 'something', 'think', 'when', 'watch', 'edition', 'ending', 'film', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'door', 'possibility', 'genre', 'change', 'film', 'are', 'hints', 'chance', 'change', ""n't"", 'end', 'clearer', 'what', 'Richard', 'Kelley', 'unbelievable', 'film', 'mind', 'several', 'new', 'ideas', 'possibilities', 'adding', 'chapters', 'book', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'better', 'guide', 'different', 'phases', 'Darko', 'encounters', 'experiences', 'Also', 'Kelley', 'images', 'human', 'eye', 'several', 'scenes', 'create', 'stronger', 'connection', 'tangent', 'universe', 'reality', 'director', 'cut', 'seemed', 'more', 'dream', 'original', 'thoroughly', 'welcomed', 'change.There', 'are', 'handful', 'other', 'scenes', 'Kelley', 'enhance', 'world', 'Donnie', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'parents', 'girlfriend', 'therapist', 'also', 'be', 'more', 'referencing', 'religion', 'edition', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'see', 'felt', 'was', 'aspect', 'missing', 'original', 'wonderful', 'discussing', 'film', 'Donnie', 'therapist', 'concerning', 'difference', 'atheist', 'agnostic', 'powerfully', 'sealed', 'film', 'allowed', 'bit', 'more', 'insight', 'Donnie', 'character', 'where', 'issue', 'God', 'strange', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'was', 'final', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'was', 'finally', 'put', 'place.Thankfully', 'extra', 'scenes', 'better', 'sound', 'can', 'witness', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'purest', 'form', 'way', 'director', 'wanted', 'be', 'finally', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'finished', 'product', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'finale', 'desired', 'film', 'fanatic', 'was', 'extra', 'icing', 'cake', 'additions', 'new', 'songs', 'only', 'help', 'build', 'already', 'haunting', 'sound', 'film', 'Honestly', 'who', 'can', 'match', 'remake', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'song', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'seemed', 'was', 'made', 'explicitly', 'film', 'Finally', 'how', 'can', 'challenge', 'film', 'secret', 'time', 'travel', 'truth', 'there', 'Not', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'cases', 'when', 'director', 'cut', 'will', 'dramatically', 'change', 'structure', 'sensation', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Kelley', 'changed', 'nothing', 'deeply', 'developed', 'characters', 'overall', 'story', 'only', 'aspect', 'feel', 'did', 'change', 'possibly', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', 'possible', 'genre', 'switch', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'see', 'true', 'not.Donnie', 'Darko', 'remain', 'top', 'eleven', 'films', 'ever', 'list', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'dethroned', 'anytime', 'soon', 'especially', 'release', 'director', 'cut', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'impressions', 'mind', 'years', 'come', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'films', 'recycled', 'Hollywood', 'riff', 'currently', 'being', 'released', 'doubt', 'ever', 'will', 'so', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'film', 'today', 'honestly', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'escape', 'grasp', 'Hollywood.You', 'will', 'never', 'experience', 'film', 'again', 'lifetime.Grade', '*****', '*****']",Donnie Darko

I was totally entranced with the film even before the opening credits finished popping up on the screen. Jake plays Donnie Darko, a young man with a sleeping disorder that has him waking up in strange places (far away from his house, even). Usually, he is drawn out of the house at night by a gigantic bunny - actually, a guy in a bunny costume. Yes, it's really weird. But one night, the vision of the bunny man saves his life, as he is lured out of his bedroom not too long before a big piece of a plane comes crashing down on his bed - where he would have been at the time, if it weren't for his darn strange sleeping habits. This scene sets the stage for what is, I think, one of the strangest movies ever - and the most original.The film also stars Jake's real-life sister Maggie, as Donnie's sister. Patrick Swayze turns in a humorous performance as one of those annoying motivational speakers. Drew Barrymore plays one of his teachers, and Jena Malone is good as Donnie's love interest. And while all of their performances are good, none of them are as good as Jake Gyllenhaal, who gives a haunting, mesmerizing performance that will stick in your mind. If you're going to watch this movie, I suggest doing it on DVD, because I found the audio commentary to be extremely helpful. The reason for this is that there is a lot in this movie I don't really get (the ending, if you ask me, is a weird one, and would love it if someone could please tell me their take on it), and especially the actor commentary was helpful; little things are actually pointed out that could be crucial to understanding the film, or at least it is cool to see how everything sort of all comes together in the end.I don't think this film is for everyone, and a lot of people are going to probably start watching and decide it's too eccentric for them, and not even finish it. But I urge anyone to at least give it a chance, even if it is just for Jake's performance.

Every once in a while, I have to go back and down-grade a bunch of films I reviewed, because a great film comes along and shows me what is really possible given a talented cast and great script in the hands of a good director. This is such a film. The first two acts set up our expectations - a nervous young man with a troubled past and a lot of barely concealed anger is abused in various ways by both kids and adults. He tries to stay in control, but some darkness within makes him stop taking his anti-psychotic medication even as he tries vainly to fight off visions of ""the end of the world"", brought to him by the ghost of Bad Times Yet to Come in the form of a satanic-looking rabbit. Family and frinds just watch as our hero starts circling the bowl. When will he crack ? Then the bomb goes off and this film rockets to my ""must buy"" list. Not only did I not get a Columbine-style ""gun battle"" that the marketing for this film seemed to promise, I found I was in the middle of a supernatural thriller. I will not say much, except that subplots and strange phenomena abound, which are resolved in one of the best third acts I can recall. I waited in vain for the payoff we usually get with supernatural thrillers in which the ""unspeakable evil"" shows up and is actually quite speakable, if not outright lame. What I got was worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense""). This remarkable achievement came not through trickery (hiding the Bad Thing) or cheats (making the Bad Thing invincible), but through not letting the the plot swallow the characters. Instead, the characters are drawn so well that when the Bad Thing reveals itself, (note: the Bad Thing is actually worse than anything we could have expected - it is classic in scope and scale) the characters act accordingly and the emotional payoff just rocks. The resolution of the film was so strong that while I watched it, I was taken in, but when I think back about the events early in the film in context of what I know comes later, I get serious chills. The DVD contains several fully-realized scenes and extensions of scenes in the film, some of which I wish were in the film or at least watchable as part of the main narrative.

The core of `Donnie Darko' isn't as clear as some may want it to be, but that is half the fun.

Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal as the emotionally reserved young man who talks to giant rabbits and becomes obsessed with time travel.  As the world continues to evolve around him, Donnie finds himself increasingly fixated on a world inside that world, one that moves him and propels him to conclusions that will warp your mind.  The cast is extensive (Swayze, McDonnell, Barrymore, Malone, the hot Gyllenhaal...) and they all play their part, making the most of limited screentime to create whole characters that are interwoven into Donnie's destiny.

I know that I'll have to watch it a couple more times to pick up on all the little things and connections. Overall, for now, I appreciate schizo Donnie as the hero - giving his own life for the sake of others - in the end which is really the beginning and the end. Oh, and obviously the guy in the bunny costume, Frank, was really freaking freaky. I'm glad he eventually takes off the suit, though, because that would have given me nightmares if I hadn't known who or what was really inside it. Biggest surprise - seeing Patrick Swayze. I didn't know he was in this movie before I started watching. He was good, and it made me sad seeing him again. Still, I'm glad he's got another good film credit. Yes, I do think this was a good movie, even though I don't fully understand it all yet. I'm still intrigued by the time travel elements. I love time travel in movies and the way it messes with my mind. Oh, and favorite line so far - Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. This movie has some excellent weirdos.Maggie Gyllenhaal played Jake Gyllenhaal's sister, and that was neat to see the real-life sibling actors acting together. This was Jake's first major film I believe (not sure), and he was excellent as dark, troubled, sleep-walking schizophrenic Donnie.

All of the actors are fantastic in their roles (although some of the charicatures in the film remain just that, despite the good acting). Especiialy Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is brilliant -- taking up the role of a schizophrenic Holden Caulfield-type character perfectly. The story is intriguing. The directing and cinematography, brilliant.This is a movie with great emotional punch, but which fails to come together logically in the end. It's a time-travel story with holes in it, and although the holes in logic are filled with touching, emotional moments, the holes in logic are still present.Still, despite the logic-problems, I give it four stars because it has so many moments in it that I can personally relate to. I think anyone who remembers the confusion, ackwardness and frustration of being an adolescent should see this movie, because, truth is, Jake Gyllenhaal brings Donnie Darko to life in the moments when he seems most sane -- when he seems like a kid too smart for his own good, unsure how to deal with a world that isn't the way he would have made it, if he were in charge.If you watch this movie and you remember those ackward adolescent moments you experienced when growing up, you'll find something in Donnie's character to which you can relate.

686951,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00005V3Z4,Anthony Hinde,"[0, 0]","Some films are impossible to categorize. Donnie Darko can be seen as horror, science fiction, drama or social satire but in truth it is just art. This is the sort of entertainment that is best experienced in a relaxed state of half dreaming. The plot defies analysis and the bizarre situations that arise are strangely suited to the audience's mood. After my first viewing, I didn't know what I had seen but I knew I liked it. In fact, it took several sessions to reach a solid hypothesis as to the narrative cause and effect.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a troubling but not troubled young man who lives in a different world to the rest of us. His average family offers him all the support they can but even Donnie's psychiatrist struggles to understand his situation. The prescription of antischizophrenic drugs seems to do little to blunt his visions, nor do they stop his nocturnal missions. I particularly like the way the soundtrack was gently used to separate the normal from the abnormal. The film's mournful version of ""Mad World"", (originally made famous by Tears for Fears), was one of the musical highlights.One of Donnie's most interesting qualities is that he has no fear of the common-place terrors that exist for the rest of us. He tells his teachers where to shove it, asks the beautiful Gretchen to go steady after only a day, speaks out against the school's guest brain-washer and even copes calmly with murderous bullies. He is however, afraid that the world will end in 28 days and is concerned about dying alone, but then who isn't.The story is interwoven with several mysteries, only some of which are even partially explained in the film. One of the most important of these occurs while Donnie is out one night on the local golf-course, talking to a six foot rabbit named Frank. I don't know if this is an allusion to the James Stewart film, ""Harvey,"" but it is certainly not played for laughs, as Frank is quite sinister. Sometime during this meeting Donnie's bedroom is demolished by a falling jet engine. No one knows where it came from and no airline claims their lost property, but one thing is certain, if Donnie hadn't been AWOL, he'd be very dead.Life quickly resumes. The family's notoriety fades and school life once again regains its position of central torment in Donnie's life. His beautiful and sensitive English teacher, along with his grounded and caring science teacher, (Barrymore & Wylie), fail to offset the damage done by the stressed and misguided gym teacher, Kitty Farmer. She is a disciple of Jim Cunningham, (Swayze), a motivational speaker who reaks of charm and paternalistic love; so much so that Donnie, and the audience, just can't buy into his simple solutions.The film's cast is huge but of an impressive quality, for an ostensibly independent production. All the major characters seemed to go beyond what is expected and create three dimensional beings with quirks, fears and emotions that are subtly alluded to. I particularly enjoyed Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie. When he is in the sway of one of his visions, the cast of his eye is more disturbing than any million dollar special effect. Beth Grant, playing the Gym teacher, is also outstanding. Her new-age zealotry is the perfect representation of what is truly dangerous in our politically correct society.Along with a great cast, the script is amazing. Not just in its creativity but that it ever managed to get funding. Chock full of unlikely theories, small but convoluted set pieces and thought provoking dialogue, it made the film entertaining, even after several viewings. Small touches bring Donnie's world home to us; like the discussion of the sexual mores of Smurfs, Ms Pomeroy forcing the new girl to sit next to the guy she likes best and an old lady suffering a life-threatening obsession with checking her perpetually empty mailbox.In the end though, it is the greater plot devices that twist our minds like some drug induced mobius loop. Is Donnie some sort of psychotic super-hero? Did everyone remember an alternative future, at the end? Were Grandma Death's theories on time-travel true? If you like pat answers in your entertainment, then you'll be frustrated with Donnie Darko. If however, like me, you like to solve puzzles, you may be prepared to dive into the depths of Donnie's world.

686955,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00005V3Z4,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[7, 8]","I would go with ""something"", but Superhero is a close second.Just when you think you've seen every plotline under the sun, along comes the most brilliantly tweaked teen angst film in over a decade.  Donnie Darko is a highschooler living in upper middle class suburbia circa 1988.  He has all the usual problems with parents, siblings, teachers and friends that are standard elements of any story about teenagers, but just to top it off he's a bit of a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  One night he sleepwalks out the front door and down to the golf course at the command of a new imaginary friend ""Frank"".  A few minutes later a stray piece of a jetliner falls from out of nowhere and crashes right through the roof of his bedroom.  Donnie realizes that since Frank has saved his life, he is now bound to serve Frank's will.  Oh, and Frank also predicts the end of the world in 28 days.I think that what makes this weirdness work is the lead actor, Jake Gyllenhall.  He was a relative unknown at the time this was made, and I think this allowed him to pull off a very believable performance as a basically decent guy who just happens to have this weird personal rabbit-alien thing telling him to do disturbing things.  Donnie is a kind of secret superhero.  You see this tall, solidly built teenager who is good looking enough to have been popular with the jock-and-cheerleader crowd, but who is too much of a free thinker to care about that sort of thing.  He stands up to bullies in an almost detached manner, hangs around with all kinds of kids and cares for his family.  He is charming in an off sort of way.  You would almost forget that he has a dark side at all if you didn't see this slow, twisted smile creeping across his face at key moments.I would love to delve further into the meaning behind the plot, but that would make for a real spoiler.It's been a long time since I've enjoyed such a quirky, cult-classic-to-be movie.

The music, the tone, and Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliance completely swept me away. Writer/director Richard Kelly has created an altogether awesome movie that is thought-provoking, funny, and sad.This film is a psychological/sci-fi thriller about a teenager named Donnie Darko who is shown prophetic visions by a six-foot tall rabbit named Frank. Are you thinking Harvey? Think again. This is the scariest rabbit I've ever seen in my entire life. The film begins with a jet-engine crashing through the roof and into Donnie's room. Donnie's not sure what to make of this, and spends the rest of the film on a sort of spiritual journey of faith, love, life, and death.This movie left me with so many questions, but after trying to pick this movie apart so I could better understand it, I decided to just give up on it. Take this movie as it is, don't try to nitpick it because it will seriously make your head explode.Everything about this movie is great. Jake gives such a great performance, and he has yet to disappoint me. Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone co-star to create a truly all-star cast. The music is probably my favorite part of the film. The original score evokes the sci-fi/futuristic feeling, but it's also extremely haunting.

Extremely strange things begin to happen as Frank predicts Donnie's approaching rendezvous with destiny.The film is unfortunately loaded with clich&eacute;s:  the troubled teen, the idiot parents, the sympathetic science teacher, the class bullies, the new girl in town...it's everything we've seen before in dozens of other movies.  But `Donnie Darko' does have one thing going for it: it's as strange as a flock of flying pigs.  That weirdness almost makes the movie work, but the film ends leaving so many loose ends that are never tied up.  The extra features should have been a warning sign: when you've got 20 deleted and extended scenes, you've probably got a chopped up story.

686967,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005V3Z4,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Donnie Darko doesn't strike me as suspenseful horror in any shape or form.  More like light elements of psychological weirdness that never really hits you on a deep personal note.It basically consists of a teenager constantly questioning his reality, questioning the possibilities of time travel, and wonders what would happen if you were to change the past so it never happened.  Mental problems perhaps a tad worse than usual for a confused teenager contributes to some wild, hallucinating effects.Now when I was a teenager, I went through problems similar to the kid playing the role of Donnie Darko.  I'd confuse and worry myself silly *almost* to the point I'd wonder if my existence was even real or not.  This resulted in questioning whether the universe was actually real among other crazy problems.  Nothing really out of the ordinary there- most teenagers go through the same phase.  We grow out of them eventually (at least, most of us do) as we accept that death is inevitable, so I can totally see why Donnie Darko is a huge hit among the younger crowd.Perhaps I'm too old to really appreciate it, but many of the scenes felt rather cheesy with Donnie constantly seeing odd, orb-like transparent snake images floating directly in front of his family members and friends while they were walking around the house.  Supposedly the theme is that Donnie was seeing images of a terrible situation that couldn't be avoided.  However...I don't want to spoil the ending because that would ruin everything, but you may be shocked by the conclusion.If anything, Donnie Darko delivers with an interesting storyline that makes you wonder where it's going, and that's it.  I honestly didn't sense any truly earth-shattering deep meaning here.  Obviously the rabbit creature *itself* isn't supposed to be scary- it makes you think because it's an unexplainable hallucination.  So people who are putting down the rabbit creature because it's not scary... well, imagine looking in the mirror and seeing something like that.  Yeah, it would definitely be alarming *then*.Anyway, I really do like Donnie Darko.  There's a variety of characters each with their own assortment of problems and the storyline does a great job focusing and giving enough time to each one of them.  However, the ending... haha.

686969,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005V3Z4,Benjamin,"[6, 6]","""Donnie Darko,"" with a DVD chock full of interesting extras, is a surprisingly good, creepy little period movie. (Of course, the movie's set in 1988, and its soundtrack, featuring a lot of Tears for Fears music is killer.)In the film itself, Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the great new young actors, gives a performance that stays both vulnerable and frightening as the title character, a disturbed boy seeing a psychologist because he sleepwalks, remains disdainful of his parents (who consider him ""changed"" even before the freaky events of the plot happen) and visualizes, at times, a giant bunny rabbit named Frank who tells him the end of his world is coming in less than a month.Around the time he begins seeing Frank, Donnie's house is hit with a piece of airplane fuselage, which destroys his bedroom. The wreckage is unidentified, for no plane at the time reported losing any of its equipment.At Donnie's school, the staff and students have become involved with an inspirational speaker's new program involving a narrow scope of emotional honesty. Donnie, seeing all as hypocrites, is encouraged to rebel violently by Frank, but Donnie also begins to piece together clues regarding hidden secrets, an uncertain future and, strangely, time travel that hint that Frank may not be all that he seems.All of this leads to an ending that, more or less, makes sense and remains haunting, though it takes multiple viewings to quite ""get"" the film and Donnie's choices at its end.Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore, who also served as a producer on the film, are on hand to give key performances.

It is strange, dark (of course), cool, mysterious, enigmatic, scary, funny, serious, sarcastic, bleak yet hopeful, mystical, and even charming. Jake Gyllenhaal is Donnie, who is absolutely believable no matter what he says or does. Time travel? No problem! A seven-foot rabbit named Frank who predicts the end of the world in 28 days? No problem! Donnie's earnestness is mesmerizing. The rest of the cast is an incredible ensemble of big stars in small, crucial roles. Drew Barrymore (E.T., The Wedding Singer, Charlies Angels) plays the only teacher in Donnie's school who seems to realize that what's being passed off as an &quot;education&quot; is actually a long, dull course in mind-numbing mediocrity (hmmm... sounds like my highschool). Noah Wyle (ER) is the science teacher who has wild theoretical conversations with Donnie about time travel, then cuts him off competely when Donnie asks if God might be involved. Donnie's mom is played by Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves, Grand Canyon). She loves him while being frustrated and afraid of his condition. Katharine Ross (The Graduate, The Stepford Wives) is Donnie's psychiatist, trying to probe his mind and help him. Patrick Swayze (Dirty Dancing) plays Jim Cunningham, tele-guru and local self-help author, who is exposed by Donnie (and Frank) for who / what he REALLY is. Jena Malone is Donnie's new girlfriend Gretchen. She's got problems enough of her own. Together, this cast of characters orbits perfectly around Donnie's dark center of gravity. Do not expect the typical hollywood bucket of swill here! Donnie Darko took actual thought to create. It's style and story are unique.

686979,A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ,B00005V3Z4,Blahblahblah,"[3, 6]","To oversimplify the film, Donnie Darko is about a boy who may have paranoid schizophrenia who is saved from being crushed by an airplane engine which crashes into his bedroom by an imaginary friend that resembles a guy in a demon bunny costume. This new ""friend"" begins manipulating his actions which creates a chain reaction inevitably leading to the end events. Throughout the film Donnie finds himself confronting such issues as predestination vs free will and the existence of God. The story takes place in the late 1980s, apparently so the viewer will have some expectation of what won't happen in Donnie's future.The time travel plot provides moments of interest, but is ultimately weak and pointless.  I cannot give a full critique without spoiling the ending, but this storyline completely contradicts the point the film is trying to make (see below for more details). However, where the film excels is as a character study of Donnie himself and his interactions with several other interesting characters. Some of the other characters are a bit one dimensional, but that is the point. Such shallow people do exist in real life and never look at the world with the amount of depth or imagination that Donnie does, and seeing the two extremes come into conflict is priceless. This is one of the funniest satires of suburban life I have seen since American Beauty.If Richard Kelly were more confident to stick to straightforward storytelling and directing (the shifts in camera speed for example are just annoying and campy) and left out the superficial gloss and unnecessary time travel storyline, this film would be a true masterpiece. He does appear to have the potential to create surreal masterpieces like David Lynch, but he first has to figure out how how to avoid completely contradicting himself. It will be interesting to see which way he goes in the future; if he'll make the next American Beauty or the next Mulholland Dr. Maybe he'll surprise us and make a more successfull hybrid.SPOILER: The film is supposed to divine intervention leading to Donnie's self-sacrifice. However, the tragedies at the end of the film are solely caused by this intervention.  For example, Donnie would not have flooded the school or burnt down the kiddie porn house or visited Grandma Death's house without the encouragement of the bunny, so his mother would not be on the plane, his teacher wouldn't have been fired, his girlfriend would not have been killed,  nor would the guy in the bunny suit have even died if not for his own intervention!

686983,A2SJXOV5UTYBJU,B00005V3Z4,"Boondagger ""Steve-o""","[4, 5]","This version of Donnie Darko is superior to any version released before. There are numerous differences ranging from the musical soundtrack to uncountable additional scenes pepped throughout and re-editing of some of the old scenes.I think that the most important addition in this movie are the periodic pages of ""The Philosohpy of Time Travel"" that flood the screen. They fortell the epic ending and cast a bit more light on the unseen story from the older versions. I found myself pausing the movie constantly so I could read them completely. While they are still as vague as you might think, they do serve a purpose to the end result.Sound effects have been added and changed though the entire movie as well. Most notable is the addition/modification of the Abyss-style liquid spears' sound effects. Now they sound more mechanical than liquid. Another major addition/change is the inclusion of the pixelated monitor filter used on many vision sequences. It's seemed out of place at first, but that's only because I was used to the original version. But it works.It's so hard to list everything different in this version, but if you're a fan of the original, you simply must see this version. I absolutely love it, even though the ""Echohead and the Bunnymen"" song from the beginning was changed. It's almost like a new movie. This has always been a dark movie, but now the brighter colors seem to have been emphasized and sharpened more than before.My favorite scene, the movie theater/portal scene has even been updated. It now has an even more ominous feel to it, if that's possible. The one thing that old fans may/may not like about this version is that Donnie Darko is sort of painted with the ""chosen one"" brush. While I don't mind this because it is still done in a crazy head trippin' way, it doesn't feel quite as inexplicable.The movie oozes so much more artistic style this time around. This is truely the director's original vision, and I think a fantastic example of what a DVD re-release should be.

Not exactly lied, but distorting the truth a little bit - I was reccomended DONNIE DARKO after buying Memento, but it seemed a bit much for my taste - end of the world, time-travel, aliens, giant bunny rabbits - it sounded like an artistic mess David Lynch is capable of delivering combined with a talking animals in clothing (talking chimps come to mind that should be forbidden) - but it intrigued me enough to keep an eye on it.After a few months, I visited a friend I haven't seen a long time and he says: ""I have something to show you...""

I made him stop the movie so I can enjoy it with the real 5.1 sound and picture. I ordered it at the amazon the very same day.Upon writing this review, I thought to myself: ""Rather than telling you what the movie really is about, I'll tell the story of how I came to become a very satisfied owner of it.""

686988,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B00005V3Z4,Brett Corkins,"[7, 7]","This is one of the few movies that keeps you thinking about it days after watching it. The basic plot is enough to stimulate even the most genius of people. As far as the acting goes, you really don't get much better than this. What makes this movie leaps and bounds better than other movies of this sort is that the execution is flawless and it makes you think. From beginning to end this movie keeps your attention and keeps you guessing at what might happen next.The story revolves around Donnie Darko, a teen that doesn't quite fit in. He has two sisters and parents that are making him see a shrink. It's with his shrink that some of his inner-most thoughts are spoken. It's also with his shrink where he tells of his encounters with the mysterious Frank. Gretchin, his girlfriend, does help to take his mind off of the strange happenings that are going on around him at times, but at night is when everything happens to him. Mrs. Sparrow, also known as ""Grandma Death,"" seems to be his guide through what he experiences throughout this film. Her book, The Philosophy Of Time Travel, becomes Donnie's bible through his troublesome 28 days.As I stated earlier, the acting is second to none. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) couldn't have portrayed a troubled teen better. Every second he's on screen you just become engrossed with him, nobody could've done a better job. Jena Malone (Gretchin) is also believable. She too is a troubled teen with an extremely perilous past. Her and Jake's romance is, to say the least, acted out perfectly. Also along for the ride is Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell. All of which seem to have brought they're A game. Donnie's family, I feel, was casted perfectly. The way they interact and talk to each other is so true to real life it's scary. Part of the reason they mesh so amazingly is because Jake's real sister was cast as his sister in the film. Pure genius.Overall this is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. However hard it is to understand you are rewarded greatly for paying attention. The ending, while I was a bit disappointed for them not including the extra bit, was amazing. A great end to a flawless film.

Not that the movie had any other connections to terrorist acts, but that was enough to stifle this well-made indie flick in its theatrical run.  But the DVD brings it to life in a very full way, and with LOADS of extras.The story is twisting and would make David Lynch's head spin!  Donnie is just your average all-American teen who sees big evil bunny rabbits on golf courses telling him about a coming apocalypse.  He survives a plane engine hitting his house thanks to his visions.  He may or may not be schizophrenic, or touched in a special way.  He commits violent destructive crimes in his sleep, but they bring retribution somehow.  And he may or may not be seeing destiny forming in front of his family - I mean this literally in a physical sense.  Is he crazy?  Is he a savior?  Maybe both.The cast is SUPERB!  Drew Barrymore who also produced, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wylie, Catharine Ross, and Beth Grant all make strong use of their characters.  The movie is bursting with eccentric well-constructed characters from Donnie's family to his friends.  There are no weak links here!And technically the movie is beautiful.  Set in the mid 80s, the production design is dead on with just small touches here and there.  The music is affecting!  The camera work is sublime!  Even the special effects work incredibly well given the budget.  This is a labor of love for all involved and it shows.And the DVD is the same labor of love.

The sheer volume of existing commentary on this totally original, cutting edge movie are impressive enough, but even more amazing is the degree of depth and insight put into many of these reviews. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that 'Donnie Darko' is not only a cult classic, but a major cinematic phenomenon that has attracted an immense following. Considering the content of this film you might even go so far as to say it has established a ""congregation"" of its own.So sit down, relax, strap yourself into your favorite chair and say a quick prayer in preparation for a hallucinatory journey through the brilliant but borderline schizophrenic mind of Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled teenager dealing with a constantly shifting world of multiple dimensions.Jake Gyllenhaal is magnificent as the disturbed Donnie Darko. The subtle but dramatic changes in personality, body movements, gestures, voice and physical appearance displayed during his mental transition from one state of reality to the next are done to perfection. Add to Jakes' nuanced performance the unnerving visual of a human-sized demonic entity dressed in a very bad rabbit suit and you have the makings of an experience unlike anything you've ever seen.A word of warning is necessary. Beware of possible side-effects after viewing this film. It you start hearing a low, modulated voice speaking to you in the darkness of your room make sure to have some rabbit food handy.

686991,AZLC3D46UHOAK,B00005V3Z4,Bryan Weber,"[15, 19]","This is absolutely one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen. Focusing on troubled teenager Donnie Darko, this movie is set in the month of Oct. 1988, amid the political backdrop of the Bush/Dukakis election.Late one October night, Donnie has a dream about a six foot tall, nightmarish bunny named Frank, who tells Donnie that the world is going to end on Oct. 30. He returns home to find a jet engine lodged into his bedroom, an engine that no-one can trace.The next day at school, Donnie encounters Gretchen, a beautiful girl with a troubled past. She and Donnie become friends.Meanwhile, the school is preparing for a visit by a New Age philosopher named Jim Cunningham (brilliantly played by Patrick Swayze) who tells people that he can eliminate their fear.Madness or prophecy? That's the question we are forced to ask ourselves at each turn, every time that Donnie has a vision of Frank.Donnie confronts Jim Cunningham at a school assembly, seeing past the man's empty promises. Donnie tells Jim that he is ""the AntiChrist"".All the while, Donnie is obsessed with the idea of time travel, fueled by a book written by a woman he knows, a woman who has told him that all creatures on this Earth will die alone.Haunted by strange visions, Donnie is aware of the ever-approaching deadline for the end of the world, falling more and more in love with Gretchen.I can't say much more without spoiling the ending of the film, but I will say this. Donnie Darko is a romantic suspense film about sacrifice and redemption.And the DVD itself is full of extras, with twenty deleted scenes, a mock infomercial about Jim Cunningham and his philosophy, cast bios, a beautiful music video, and pages from the book The Philosophy of Time Travel.With no gratuitous violence, nudity, or gore, this film is purely driven by the characters and their circumstances, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to think for themselves.",5,Why Are You Wearing That Stupid Man Suit?,1018569600,"04 12, 2002",2002,1926,"['absolutely', 'one', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Focusing', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'movie', 'set', 'month', 'Oct.', '1988', 'political', 'backdrop', 'Bush/Dukakis', 'election.Late', 'one', 'October', 'night', 'Donnie', 'dream', 'six', 'foot', 'tall', 'nightmarish', 'bunny', 'named', 'Frank', 'who', 'Donnie', 'world', 'going', 'end', 'Oct.', '30', 'home', 'find', 'jet', 'engine', 'lodged', 'bedroom', 'engine', 'no-one', 'can', 'trace.The', 'next', 'day', 'school', 'Donnie', 'Gretchen', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'troubled', 'past', 'Donnie', 'become', 'friends.Meanwhile', 'school', 'preparing', 'visit', 'New', 'Age', 'philosopher', 'named', 'Jim', 'Cunningham', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'who', 'people', 'can', 'eliminate', 'fear.Madness', 'prophecy', 'question', 'are', 'forced', 'ask', 'turn', 'time', 'Donnie', 'vision', 'Frank.Donnie', 'confronts', 'Jim', 'Cunningham', 'school', 'assembly', 'seeing', 'man', 'empty', 'promises', 'Donnie', 'Jim', 'AntiChrist', '.All', 'while', 'Donnie', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'time', 'travel', 'fueled', 'book', 'written', 'woman', 'woman', 'who', 'told', 'creatures', 'Earth', 'will', 'die', 'alone.Haunted', 'strange', 'visions', 'Donnie', 'aware', 'ever-approaching', 'deadline', 'end', 'world', 'falling', 'more', 'more', 'love', 'Gretchen.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'romantic', 'suspense', 'film', 'sacrifice', 'redemption.And', 'DVD', 'full', 'extras', 'twenty', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mock', 'infomercial', 'Jim', 'Cunningham', 'philosophy', 'cast', 'bios', 'beautiful', 'music', 'video', 'pages', 'book', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel.With', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'nudity', 'gore', 'film', 'purely', 'driven', 'characters', 'circumstances', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'think']",Donnie Darko

I found the audio commentary by the producer and main actor to be helpful toward the end...They do offer some explanations about some things you might not have picked up on that are significant.  After I watched this the first time, I went back over the last 15 minutes with the audio commentary on and was surprised to see how detailed the storyline was.

When a young man has no future even in a dimension where he survives a jet engine hitting his room, but his girlfriend is ran over and killed, I think you get the point.

686999,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005V3Z4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[2, 7]","This film appears to be written and directed with the marketing strategy of appealing to mixed up and angry adolescents in that stage of life where they think the whole world is crazy, absurd, and working against them. It is a science fiction film yet we are given enough background to also think that maybe this is a film about a mentally ill or schizophrenic teenager. The lose ends of the film are eventually resolved, but in a way that appeals to the romantic aspect of adolescents that seeks some dramatic way to change the world.We are shown a world of dysfunction around Donnie. His mother seems to think discipline is a bad thing and allows her son to curse her out and then sobs around the house in a depression thinking she failed as a mother. His father tries too hard to be a buddy to his son rather that be a strong father. His teachers range from the intellectual, to the weak, to the right wing fascist type. The school principal fires the one teacher that treats the students as intelligent and supports the most outlandish right wing teacher on the faculty. School bullies dominate the school and community. A crazy motivational speaker begins to dominate the community with an evangelical style self-help strategy. All of this Donnie seems to recognize as out of line and yet he also sees things that are definitely not real, and thus whereas he sees through hypocrisy with x-ray vision, he also is plagued with odd hallucinations of a demonic 6 foot sharp toothed rabbit.Well where does this weirdness lead us? It finally leads to mysterious airplane engines falling from the sky and then to acts of sacrifice and heroism, again appealing to the romantic and idealistic instincts of American youth.It is an odd film, neither outstanding nor terrible. The film uses the classic strategy for maintaining suspense, which is to withhold information from the audience. Eventually the viewer is given enough information to have the structure of the film come together and for there to be resolution of all the issues in the plot, or at least the major issues.

Not so. The movie does not go to extremes. Donnie has friends and even a girlfriend. He's good kid we like.Some people compare this to David Lynch in that the film makes no sense. It made sense to me.Lynch's films are odd in the way that you feel left out of the movie. The characters know what's happening but you don't. As if somehow they edited out the wrong scenes from the movie. Here we know all that Donnie does. And Donnie knows more than the other characters.For first time director Richard Kelly the production quality is amazing. The score consists of Tears For Fears songs.Be sure to get the DVD with extra scenes. There's some scenes I can't believe they left out.

In fact, I think this kid just had to be my personal hero!I haved loved this movie for years, and not just loved it. It is like a beautiful, intelligent woman, where you love every part of it, in every way. It is a flawless creation.The characters are incredible. Donnie is a broodig teenager that any can relate to. He just happens to be visited by the future and traverse space and time. His parents are completely realistic recreations of sad, worried, yet oddly hopeful elders. And his teachers, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and one crazy lady who loves Patrick Swayze, are all tremendously entertaining figures, in every way.Many people at the beginning roll their eyes at such a perceivedly dark piece of work, But by the end, they are enlightened, laughing, scared, and astonishingly overjoyed. This movie has a toll on the senses unlike any other. And the hip 80's soundtrack will make any viewer fill with uneasy glee.There is no need to describe the plot. No one can. It must be deciphered through multiple viewings, and even then, the viewer is left up to their own interpretation. It is an admirable mind-twister, and you will spend many nights awake arguing with yourself over the meaning of the film.I loved the film. it perfectly blends dark comedy, horror, drama, intution, curiosity, and virtuosity into one complex, compelling mastercraft.

Davis,"[6, 6]","I highly recommend this movie.This video first came to my attention when someone on NPR provided an analysis of the movie comparing it to the Reagan Presidency.  That alone should show that there are multiple possible interpretations for this movie.  Of course, the 900 plus reviews on Amazon might be another clue as well.As you watch the movie, several possibilities come to mind.  Donnie Darko is insane.  Donnie Darko is going to somehow save the world.  Donnie Darko's friends are pulling the most elaborate practical joke on him and this is facilitated by the psychotropic drugs that are proscribed for him. In the end, all of these are wrong.""Donnie Darko"" is about self-determination. On one hand, it offers hope that we do have control over our destinies and we are not just machines that God has set in motion to follow His plan. One the other hand, it offers the idea that by choosing his own immolation, Donnie will have made the world a better place.Of course, Donnie did this because he believes it will save the life of his girlfriend.  In the end, even that is unknowable.  Does she simply die at the hands of her estranged father vice being run over?  Do enough of the memories from the alternate future remain to discredit the child molester/motivational speaker that Donnie unmasks?  In the end, this movie is disturbing in that it not only has characters that are extremely likable yet bizarrely antisocial but its lack of answers on really any issues other than the possibility of time travel and free choice.Many of the reviewers have painted this as an anti-""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Frank the giant rabbit is organizing and directing Donnie's life.  Frank Capra the director and Frank the giant rabbit.  Yet, in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" it was possible to know the result of one's choices.  In ""Donnie Darko"", one does not even know if choice is a possibility until the very end. The final results of those choices remain unfathomable.This is an excellent story and needs to be watched at least twice to get all the subtle points.  For example, who is the overweight Asian girl and why does she have a crush on Donnie?  While the main story comes together at the end with a revealing series of scenes, it is far better than a ""gimmick"" movie that is of no interest once the viewer learns the ""real"" secret.",4,A DVD WORTH OWNING,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,2329,"['highly', 'recommend', 'movie.This', 'video', 'first', 'came', 'attention', 'when', 'someone', 'NPR', 'provided', 'analysis', 'movie', 'comparing', 'Reagan', 'Presidency', 'alone', 'should', 'show', 'are', 'multiple', 'possible', 'interpretations', 'movie', 'course', '900', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'might', 'be', 'clue', 'well.As', 'watch', 'movie', 'several', 'possibilities', 'come', 'mind', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'insane', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'going', 'somehow', 'save', 'world', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'friends', 'are', 'pulling', 'most', 'elaborate', 'practical', 'joke', 'facilitated', 'psychotropic', 'drugs', 'are', 'proscribed', 'end', 'are', 'wrong', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'self-determination', 'one', 'hand', 'hope', 'do', 'have', 'control', 'destinies', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'machines', 'God', 'set', 'motion', 'follow', 'plan', 'One', 'other', 'hand', 'idea', 'choosing', 'own', 'immolation', 'Donnie', 'will', 'have', 'made', 'world', 'better', 'place.Of', 'course', 'Donnie', 'did', 'will', 'save', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'end', 'even', 'unknowable', 'simply', 'die', 'hands', 'estranged', 'father', 'vice', 'being', 'run', 'Do', 'enough', 'memories', 'alternate', 'future', 'remain', 'discredit', 'child', 'molester/motivational', 'speaker', 'Donnie', 'unmasks', 'end', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'likable', 'yet', 'bizarrely', 'antisocial', 'lack', 'answers', 'really', 'issues', 'other', 'possibility', 'time', 'travel', 'free', 'choice.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'painted', 'anti-', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Frank', 'giant', 'rabbit', 'organizing', 'directing', 'Donnie', 'life', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'director', 'Frank', 'giant', 'rabbit', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'was', 'possible', 'know', 'result', 'one', 'choices', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'choice', 'possibility', 'very', 'end', 'final', 'results', 'choices', 'remain', 'unfathomable.This', 'excellent', 'story', 'be', 'watched', 'least', 'twice', 'get', 'subtle', 'points', 'example', 'who', 'overweight', 'Asian', 'girl', 'why', 'have', 'crush', 'Donnie', 'main', 'story', 'together', 'end', 'revealing', 'series', 'scenes', 'far', 'better', 'gimmick', 'movie', 'interest', 'once', 'viewer', 'real', 'secret']",Donnie Darko
687003,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,B00005V3Z4,Cecily Champagne,"[3, 4]","After watching `Donnie Darko' for the first time, I was entirely confused.  What were they talking about with time travel, tangent universes, and worm holes?  I have no interest in science fiction and couldn't begin to de-tangle the intricacies of this film's plot.  But guess what.  That didn't really matter.  I still really enjoyed `Donnie Darko.'  (Incidentally, the plot - at least the *probable* plot - has been explained to me since my first viewing ... kudos to anyone who figures out what's going on for her/himself).  Anyway - my point is - you don't have to know precisely *why* a plane's engine crashes through Donnie Darko's bedroom ceiling, and you don't have to know *why* that creepy, giant bunny is lurking around the corner to like this movie.What is likeable about this movie?  To begin with, as almost every other reviewer has pointed out, Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job with the role of Darko.  His character is extremely intelligent, cynical, slightly demented and ultimately charismatic - he reminded me a lot of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye - - which is actually an odd coincidence, considering that, in `The Good Girl,' Gyllenhaal plays a character who renames himself Holden and identifies with Salinger's protagonist.  Anyway - just a thought.  While almost all of the characters in the movie are likewise enjoyable and are brought to life by talented actresses/actors (Patrick Swayze as a motivational speaker/pervert? - well done!), I have to agree with another reviewer: Drew Barrymore is atrocious as a high school English teacher.  She is entirely unconvincing and reminds me of a female Keanu Reeves (at his worst).  Anyway ...I also like this movie because, while I did not exactly ""get"" what was happening, it is never boring.  The plot is definitely unique, dark and subtly humorous.  The scene with Darko, his uptight Health teacher (I think she was a Health teacher) and a ""Life Line"" is hilarious.  Moreover, I think that, in general, the relationships in this film are treated in a very nuanced manner and with a great deal of tenderness.  Darko and his older sister (played by Gylenhaall's real-life sister Maggie) demonstrate an especially endearing - albeit playfully hostile - dynamic.Lastly, I think one of the greatest aspects of this film is its soundtrack.  There are several great 80s songs - all very nostalgic, moody, brooding, and sexy.  They fit in perfectly.I definitely recommend giving `Donnie Darko' a shot.  It's unique, it'll probably leave you thinking (at least: 'what just happened?!?') and I think most people will enjoy it.",4,unusual and enjoyable flick,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,2608,"['watching', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'entirely', 'confused', 'What', 'were', 'talking', 'time', 'travel', 'tangent', 'universes', 'worm', 'holes', 'have', 'interest', 'science', 'fiction', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'de-tangle', 'intricacies', 'film', 'plot', 'guess', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'still', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Incidentally', 'plot', 'least', '*probable*', 'plot', 'been', 'explained', 'first', 'viewing', 'kudos', 'anyone', 'who', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'her/himself', 'Anyway', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'precisely', 'plane', 'engine', 'crashes', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'bedroom', 'ceiling', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', '*why*', 'creepy', 'giant', 'bunny', 'lurking', 'corner', 'like', 'movie.What', 'likeable', 'movie', 'begin', 'almost', 'other', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'role', 'Darko', 'character', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'cynical', 'slightly', 'demented', 'ultimately', 'charismatic', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'actually', 'odd', 'coincidence', 'considering', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'who', 'Holden', 'identifies', 'Salinger', 'protagonist', 'Anyway', 'just', 'thought', 'almost', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'likewise', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'talented', 'actresses/actors', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'motivational', 'speaker/pervert', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'atrocious', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'entirely', 'unconvincing', 'female', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'worst', 'Anyway', 'also', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'exactly', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'never', 'boring', 'plot', 'definitely', 'unique', 'dark', 'subtly', 'humorous', 'scene', 'Darko', 'uptight', 'Health', 'teacher', 'think', 'was', 'Health', 'teacher', 'Life', 'Line', 'hilarious', 'Moreover', 'think', 'general', 'relationships', 'film', 'are', 'treated', 'very', 'nuanced', 'manner', 'great', 'deal', 'tenderness', 'Darko', 'older', 'sister', 'played', 'Gylenhaall', 'real-life', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'demonstrate', 'especially', 'endearing', 'albeit', 'playfully', 'hostile', 'dynamic.Lastly', 'think', 'one', 'greatest', 'aspects', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'several', 'great', '80s', 'songs', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'moody', 'brooding', 'sexy', 'fit', 'perfectly.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'giving', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'shot', 'unique', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'leave', 'thinking', 'least', 'just', 'happened', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy']",Donnie Darko

The script is original and entirely unpredictable. There isn't a single bit of action or dialogue, not one frame that can be anticipated. The characters, too, are refreshingly well-conceived and highly unique. And it's a treat to see actors we know well (Drew Barrymore, who also produced, and Noah Wyle) stretch well beyond our usual expectations. There is great humor in this film as well as great sorrow. And, ultimately, it's impossible to say if the entire scenario takes place within the dreams of a brilliant but possibly schizophrenic young man or if, as he so desperately wishes, he has, through physics, managed to reverse time.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stunning performance as Donnie. Even his body language--incurving shoulders, questioning eyes, uncertain smiles--reveal a vast, searching intelligence. Mary McDonnell gives yet another in a roster of thoughtful portrayals--this time as the despairing mother of brilliant and troubled Donnie, simultaneously loving and hating him for being emotionally beyond her reach.

All I knew was that I couldnt stop thinking about it and wondering what the heck I just watched. So I watched it again, still didnt get it but I really liked alot better the second time.

Not because it's another case of trying to show a bit of retro cool by referencing the 80's but because it fits in so well. The fact that the scene is in slow motion should be naff but in fact it is close to the best placement of a song in a movie in ages.Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie that will leave you with a smile on your face, despite its bittersweet ending. While being startingly original, it does reference other movies (Harvey, The Sixth Sense) but doesn't seem like a second rate copy or a ""re-imagining"" for that matter (take note Mr Burton). It certainly deserves a wider audience than it got on release in the cinema with a groundbreaking performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and a wonderfully understated performance from Drew Barrymore.Richard Kelly can join such young directors as Spike Jonze and Paul Thomas Anderson who buck the trend of what is wrong with so much in American cinema, namely cliched and rehashed pap for the masses.

687011,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00005V3Z4,Clare Quilty,"[24, 40]","I was really looking forward to this movie, but so much of it strikes me as a really well made, feature-budgeted student film.Why?Because ""Donnie Darko"" is bursting with inspiration (some fresh, a lot borrowed) and yet it just doesn't seem to have the wisdom of very much actual experience. I was both fascinated and frustrated at every turn and in the end I was mostly just disappointed.For starters, ""DD"" is saddled with one of the most opaque and least likeable main characters since ""Brewster McCloud"" (which comes to mind because it, too, is an intriguing and risky but ultimately unsuccessful experiment). Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie with the ""head down, eyes up"" sad-smile glower of a Kubrick anti-hero. Sometimes Donnie is smart. Sometimes Donnie is dumb. Sometimes Donnie is mean. Sometimes Donnie is cool. Sometimes Donnie is crazy. Which is like most teenages (or even most people) but it becomes problematic when we can never get a rough estimate of how many cards the central character is playing with.The other characters aren't much help, either. The villains are cardboard and heavy handedly drawn; virtually free of any sort of complexities, they proudly sing the virtues of censorship, psycho-evangelism, and easy answers. Donnie's rebellion against them almost makes it appear that he's taking easy bait.Everybody else just sort of wanders in and out of the story, and I was really surprised at how ill-used Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie, Jena Mallone and especially Maggie Gyllenhaal are. They're all very good when it occurs to the script that they should make an appearance, but most of the time the script would rather watch Donnie be kooky.Finally, there are just too many elements of ""DD"" that remind me of, or refer to, other stuff. There's the malevolent infomercial guru prancing around on stage and he seems to belong to another movie (say, ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Magnolia""). There's the mystical rabbit-like wanderer (probably only a coincidence that ""Sexy Beast"" has one, too, but what about, say, ""Gummo"" ?). The troubled wild child in counselling (""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Ordinary People""). When the movie wants to be cheeky, it displays a theater marquee with the ""Halloween Double Feature"" of ""Evil Dead"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (zing! crash!). And one would think, since Donnie's mother is versed in Stephen King (she's reading ""It"" when the movie opens), she'd at least have a clue where her story was going.Based on the amount of deleted scenes on the DVD, and the wealth of information that's covered therein (including a particularly interesting but excised revelation about Donnie's medication) I think this was a movie that lost its way during the editing.  Director Kelly doesn't seem to have any real regrets on the commentary track so I doubt there will be a more coherent ""director's cut,"" but I imagine that a longer version would've filled in some of the blanks that I was left with at the end of the film.Nevertheless, as a horror movie, ""Donnie Darko"" does strive for something MUCH more subtle than most of the recent offerings from the horror genre. It does have genuine moments of creepiness and dread. I felt led on and let down by ""Donnie Darko,"" but I'd rather see this creepy failure five times than see another variation on ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" which, fortunately, is one movie ""Donnie"" doesn't emulate.I'll be interested to see what Richard Kelly does next.",2,Such an interesting film and yet... somehow not very good,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,3440,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'feature-budgeted', 'student', 'film.Why', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'bursting', 'inspiration', 'fresh', 'lot', 'borrowed', 'yet', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'wisdom', 'very', 'much', 'actual', 'experience', 'was', 'fascinated', 'frustrated', 'turn', 'end', 'was', 'mostly', 'just', 'disappointed.For', 'starters', 'DD', 'saddled', 'one', 'most', 'opaque', 'least', 'likeable', 'main', 'characters', 'Brewster', 'McCloud', 'mind', 'too', 'intriguing', 'risky', 'ultimately', 'unsuccessful', 'experiment', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Donnie', 'head', 'down', 'eyes', 'up', 'sad-smile', 'glower', 'Kubrick', 'anti-hero', 'Sometimes', 'Donnie', 'smart', 'Sometimes', 'Donnie', 'dumb', 'Sometimes', 'Donnie', 'mean', 'Sometimes', 'Donnie', 'cool', 'Sometimes', 'Donnie', 'crazy', 'Which', 'most', 'teenages', 'even', 'most', 'people', 'problematic', 'when', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'rough', 'estimate', 'how', 'many', 'cards', 'central', 'character', 'playing', 'other', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', 'either', 'villains', 'are', 'cardboard', 'heavy', 'handedly', 'drawn', 'virtually', 'free', 'sort', 'complexities', 'proudly', 'sing', 'virtues', 'censorship', 'psycho-evangelism', 'easy', 'answers', 'Donnie', 'rebellion', 'almost', 'appear', 'taking', 'easy', 'bait.Everybody', 'else', 'just', 'sort', 'wanders', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'ill-used', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Noah', 'Wylie', 'Jena', 'Mallone', 'especially', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', ""'re"", 'very', 'good', 'when', 'script', 'should', 'make', 'appearance', 'most', 'time', 'script', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'Donnie', 'be', 'kooky.Finally', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'DD', 'remind', 'refer', 'other', 'stuff', 'malevolent', 'infomercial', 'guru', 'prancing', 'around', 'stage', 'belong', 'movie', 'say', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Magnolia', 'mystical', 'rabbit-like', 'wanderer', 'probably', 'only', 'coincidence', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'one', 'too', 'what', 'say', 'Gummo', 'troubled', 'wild', 'child', 'counselling', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'When', 'movie', 'be', 'cheeky', 'theater', 'marquee', 'Halloween', 'Double', 'Feature', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ', 'zing', 'crash', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Donnie', 'mother', 'versed', 'Stephen', 'King', 'reading', 'when', 'movie', ""'d"", 'least', 'have', 'clue', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going.Based', 'amount', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'wealth', 'information', 'covered', 'therein', 'including', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'excised', 'revelation', 'Donnie', 'medication', 'think', 'was', 'movie', 'lost', 'way', 'editing', 'Director', 'Kelly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'regrets', 'commentary', 'track', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'coherent', 'director', 'cut', 'imagine', 'longer', 'version', 'would', ""'ve"", 'filled', 'blanks', 'was', 'left', 'end', 'film.Nevertheless', 'horror', 'movie', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'strive', 'something', 'MUCH', 'more', 'subtle', 'most', 'recent', 'offerings', 'horror', 'genre', 'have', 'genuine', 'moments', 'creepiness', 'dread', 'felt', 'led', 'let', 'down', 'Donnie', 'Darko', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'creepy', 'failure', 'five', 'times', 'see', 'variation', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'fortunately', 'one', 'movie', 'Donnie', ""n't"", 'emulate.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'next']",Donnie Darko

I thought the casting was brilliant, thus the acting was perfect.Jake Gyllenhaal has been compared to countless, great, young actors. He shouldn't have been. He is in a class by himself. I feel the same way about Jena Malone. She will survive the transition between child star and adult actress with no problem. The rest of the cast was equally inspired. Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osbourne, Kathrine Ross and Jake's real life sister Maggie are all exceptional.I think a lot of the criticism of this movie comes from people's need for a neat, tidy ending. This movie doesn't have one. It's totally up to the viewer to decide what they think happened.I have watched this movie several times and each time my conclusion is different. It depends on your mood I guess. I love that it isn't spelled out for me. I don't need to be spoon fed. I can think for myself, and this movie definitly allowed me to. I listened to the commentary and even the writer/ director doesn't really know how to explain it (that's aweome).It's a commentary on a lot of things: society, values, sanity, love. Take your pick, or add your own.This is a pensive film. It's not American Pie. Take some time with it. Watch it 2 or 3 times.

Even watching the director's cut, I was like ""what?"" at times, but then re-reading some of the things, it finally clicked. Whether you should've been left in the dark or finally understood the movie is one of those personal things that you can have it either way best suited to your tastes. For me, I enjoy that I finally ""get"" this thing.Donnie Darko(dumb name by the way) is a troubled teen under medication living in the 80's. One night while sleepwalking, a jet engine manages to land right smack in the middle of his room. That's not all as a 6-foot tall freaky rabbit tells him that the world will end in less than a month. To spoil the rest would of course be a big disservice.Some directors will come out with a huge film, and either make films that surpass or films that are great on their own merits but public reaction is ""they liked the first movie better"". M. Night Shyamalan is essentially trying to match the impact of the Sixth Sense with varying degrees of success while David Fincher was able to grow beyond Alien 3's reaction with Seven and Fight Club. Richard Kelly on the other hand seems to be one of the few who's actually trying to change around its success. Donnie Darko didn't exactly make much money but it developed a big cult following meanwhile Kelly was saying it was wrong thing, wrong that, anything and everything was wrong, hence we get this release.On initial viewing of the original version, I didn't know what the hell happened, it's like some weird story with core elements actually taken out. Here, it's practically spoonfed to you and a quick trip to a site like Wikepedia helps put everything in perspective. All the talk of Tangent Universes and Manipulated Living are just like ""huh?"" to some people but eventually they'll get...maybe. Some prefer the ambiguity, others like an explanation for once. Me? I'm kind of in the middle.Since I didn't watch the original constantly, I have no idea what was added back in but some of the effects got better and music was changed, such as the opening song which I always preferred the original choice better but hey it's his movie. Got no problem with him adding scenes to create his ultimate ""vision"" of the movie, just glad he cast Maggie Gyllenhaal, easy on the eyes that one.This is a release that I have no idea which to recommend.

Basically, he sees a vision of an oversized bunny which prophesizes that the world will end in a little under a month. Donnie gets to experience everything he's ever wanted to do during this time and still has some left to save the world.As simple as that synopsis may sound, it can't do the film justice. There are plenty, and I mean PLENTY, of subplots that are pretty interesting. The characters are also worth a look because, although not every one of them experiences growth, the majority of them who do grows in an odd yet interesting way.The direction and cinematography are pretty good, even if they do hint at past movies like E.T. and Silence of the Lambs. The effects are excellent for an independent film, and the simplistic, ambient score matches nicely with the movie's atmosphere.The plot might be the determining factor whether this film appeals to you or not. As you may have heard, the whole film, beginning, middle, and ending, are open to discussion. Although Kelly did a good job of handing us the appetizer and main course of the meal, the bastard kept the dessert. But I think this helps with the longevity of the movie; it's easily one that begs to be talked about, scrutinized, and criticized.Another determing factor might be its subtle preaching. One might not catch on to it early on but as the film progresses, it becomes more evident. Sometimes I think that the movie tries to address too many things at once, resulting in a, if you will, mental overload. But again, this can be cured with repeat viewings.I hope Kelly didn't run out of ideas after this film. I truly believe that this movie is his welcome call to the artform, both scriptwise and direction-wise. This work is among my all-time favorites not because of what it is but what it tries to be, and that beats the many offerings Hollywood has given us recently, which never tries to be anything even though they can be something.EDITED TO ADD: Director's Cut (Rating = 4 stars, since I can't place two reviews here.)I've recently watched the two versions back to back and decided to compare the two.Pros:- The addition of a few pages of The Philosophy of Time Travel into the movie makes the plot easier to comprehend for first-time viewers.- Almost all of the deleted scenes are placed back into the movie. As a result, it feels more complete and in some instances, adds more poignancy to the film, the best of which shows Donnie's relationship with the rest of his family.- Some of the special and sound effects have been revamped, all for the better.Cons:- For someone who has seen the original version and have discussed it at length with others, the Director's Cut almost feels like it dumbs down the complexity of the former. I for one recommend seeing the first before the Cut. Formulate and research your theory first before Kelly does it for you =)- I have a big, if not HUGE, problem with the changes in music. Echo & the Bunnymen's ""The Killing Moon"" is replace by INXS' ""Never Tear Us Apart"" during the beginning of the movie. While the latter is a good song itself, ""The Killing Moon"" was such an integral part of original version. It's instead relocated to a another scene where one needs to listen carefully in order to hear it. Some of the score have also been altered or moved around.It's an all-around nice version of the film though. There are a few good things added or changed, but there are also bad. This altered version doesn't take away the major aspects that made the original version/story/whatever good though. Again, here's to hoping that Kelly will eventually squeeze more genre-bending, mind-blowing, odd spectacles in his career.",5,"Part period piece, part fantasy, part sci-fi, part...",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,3985,"['going', 'going', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'one', 'films', 'even', 're-release', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'cult', 'status', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'afraid', 'think', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'later.The', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'Donnie', 'obviously', 'borderline', 'schizo', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'Basically', 'vision', 'oversized', 'bunny', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'little', 'month', 'Donnie', 'experience', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'do', 'time', 'still', 'left', 'save', 'world.As', 'simple', 'synopsis', 'may', 'sound', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'are', 'plenty', 'mean', 'PLENTY', 'subplots', 'are', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'look', 'not', 'one', 'growth', 'majority', 'who', 'do', 'grows', 'odd', 'yet', 'interesting', 'way.The', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'do', 'hint', 'past', 'movies', 'E.T', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'independent', 'film', 'simplistic', 'ambient', 'score', 'matches', 'nicely', 'movie', 'atmosphere.The', 'plot', 'might', 'be', 'determining', 'factor', 'film', 'appeals', 'not', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'whole', 'film', 'beginning', 'middle', 'ending', 'are', 'open', 'discussion', 'Kelly', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'handing', 'appetizer', 'main', 'course', 'meal', 'bastard', 'kept', 'dessert', 'think', 'longevity', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'be', 'talked', 'scrutinized', 'criticized.Another', 'determing', 'factor', 'might', 'be', 'subtle', 'preaching', 'One', 'might', 'not', 'catch', 'early', 'film', 'more', 'evident', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'movie', 'address', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'resulting', 'will', 'mental', 'overload', 'again', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'repeat', 'viewings.I', 'hope', 'Kelly', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'film', 'truly', 'believe', 'movie', 'welcome', 'call', 'artform', 'scriptwise', 'direction-wise', 'work', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'not', 'what', 'what', 'be', 'many', 'offerings', 'Hollywood', 'given', 'recently', 'never', 'be', 'anything', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'something.EDITED', 'TO', 'ADD', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Rating', '=', '4', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'place', 'two', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'watched', 'two', 'versions', 'back', 'back', 'decided', 'compare', 'two.Pros', 'addition', 'few', 'pages', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'movie', 'plot', 'easier', 'comprehend', 'first-time', 'viewers.-', 'Almost', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'placed', 'back', 'movie', 'result', 'more', 'complete', 'instances', 'more', 'poignancy', 'film', 'best', 'Donnie', 'relationship', 'rest', 'family.-', 'special', 'sound', 'effects', 'have', 'been', 'revamped', 'better.Cons', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'original', 'version', 'have', 'discussed', 'length', 'others', 'Director', 'Cut', 'almost', 'feels', 'down', 'complexity', 'former', 'one', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'first', 'Cut', 'Formulate', 'research', 'theory', 'first', 'before', 'Kelly', '=', 'have', 'big', 'not', 'HUGE', 'problem', 'changes', 'music', 'Echo', 'Bunnymen', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'replace', 'INXS', 'Never', 'Tear', 'Us', 'Apart', 'beginning', 'movie', 'latter', 'good', 'song', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'original', 'version', 'instead', 'relocated', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'listen', 'carefully', 'order', 'hear', 'score', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'altered', 'moved', 'around.It', 'all-around', 'nice', 'version', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'added', 'changed', 'are', 'also', 'bad', 'altered', 'version', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'major', 'aspects', 'made', 'original', 'version/story/whatever', 'good', 'though', 'Again', 'here', 'hoping', 'Kelly', 'will', 'eventually', 'squeeze', 'more', 'genre-bending', 'mind-blowing', 'odd', 'spectacles', 'career']",Donnie Darko

I thought it was a quirky, crazy 80s period piece and had a killer soundtrack (loved the use of the Killing Moon during the opening sequence, thank god they didn't stick with the INXS song I believe was supposed to go instead). Initially, I thought it was about schizophrenia, to discover later on that this theme merely wrapped itself around a much more complex, albeit ""unrealistic"", centre, concerning theology, the transcendence of the soul, and time travel.I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was very good, he gave body and credibility to a character who appears (and most likely, is) totally unfocused, troubled, nihilistic, yet proves to also be intelligent and aware of all the good and the bad around him. I wasn't much of a fan of the actress that played Gretchen, nor the character itself. I could never tell if she had any motivations, if she was truly concerned about her family situation, and why she was with Donnie in the first place.

687023,AF50ULMYITS9J,B00005V3Z4,Corey Slack,"[20, 22]","This is an incredibly dark, comedic, and somber film that largely lacks in linear narrative, but covers its ground well with a stunningly original plot and quirky, tone-shifting atmosphere.  At any one moment, you could be howling with laughter, staring in disbelief, or form goosebumps from overall creepiness.  The most satisfying fact is that it is all done extraordinarily well, servicing up what is--in my opinion--one of the best build-ups and conclusions I've seen in a film since SEVEN.The movie is nothing like SEVEN.  It is the story of a 1988 teenager named Donnie Darko.  While at first seeming to have the cliched problems of teen angst and a dysfunctional family, his world slowly opens up to someone with a deep, psychological malfuntion.  He takes commands from a giant rabbit while sleepwalking.  One night, while out talking to this rabbit, he is told that the world is coming to an end in 28 days.  While he is out that evening, a jet engine that fell off an aircraft destroys his room.That's all I'll say as far as plot, and I only have said that much because it all happens in the first fifteen minutes.  After that is a mystical journey through Donnie's mind.  While serving up a ton of foreshadowing and plot devices (which seem pointless until the film concludes), writer/director Richard Kelly gracefully churns out political satire, comedy, and insightful views on human nature and teenage rebellion.  I was also impressed by how well the characters developed, no matter how small or insignifican their roles seem to be.  They're all important in the overall scope of the film.Like I said earlier, this movie does lack a linear narrative.  However, I feel that is overshadowed by how well it covers all the issues it presents.  This is a hard thing to do, but it is occasionally done really well (MAGNOLIA, SHORT CUTS).  The conclusion is something that will probably turn this into a bit love/hate film, if you throw things like implausibility and suspension of disbelief.  However, I am a big fan of such things, and I am tired of cash-filled, gutless Hollywood endings which are geared towards profitibility.This film is risky, but made with some incredibly promising talent.

Slipman,"[2, 2]","Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as delusional high school student Donnie Darko in talented director Richard Kelly's thought provoking and stunningly creative award winning flick, which he also wrote.Donnie apparently a borderline schizophrenic who suffers from somnabulism has been having visions of a huge evil looking rabbit who has portended the end of the world in 28 days.  During a dream the rabbit named Frank summoned Donnie from his bed.  In a fortuitous twist of fate, inexplicably a jet engine crashes through the Darko house, specifically into Donnie's room.  Had he been there he surely would have perished.This incident set off more frequent delusions where Frank coaxed Donnie into destructive and bizarre acts.  Psychotherapy conducted by a concerned Dr. Thurman played by Katharine Ross was having little beneficial effect.  Donnie began becoming increasingly seduced by the concept of time travel somewhat fueled by science teacher Professor Monnitoff played by Noah Wylie.  Wylie introduced him to a revolutionary book on the subject penned by an aged and haggard local woman known as Grandma Death played eerily by Patience Cleveland.While this was happening Donnie became enamored with a high school girl Gretchen played by Jena Malone, whose influence would shape Donnie's future.Kelly concludes this extremely unique flick in terrific fashion, requiring rumination in it's interpretation.The musical score was haunting and enhanced the tenor of the flick especially in conjunction with the dream sequences.  The songs used throughout the film were also tastefully selected.  The acting requiring players to portray some very curious characters was very nicely done.

No, I'm not talking about The Lord of the Rings (although, my previous statement could easily be applied to that film as well). Richard Kelly's feature debut film as a director, Donnie Darko, is a fascinating science fiction drama. The film looks at the life of a troubled `80s teen named Donnie Darko, who suffers from blackouts, sleepwalking, and bizarre hallucinations. The film features an awesomesoundtrack(which is unfortunately unavailable on Amazon.com) and some nifty camerawork and visual effects. Since its initial release, Donnie Darko has developed a loyal fanbase across the globe, especially in the U.K. where the film first achieved its cult classic status.The story tells us of an emotionally troubled teenager, Donnie Darko, who begins having hallucinations (or are they) of a man in a rabbit costume. The man refers to himself as simply Frank, and he warns Donnie that the world will end in 28 days. Meanwhile, Donnie's family struggles with his peculiar behavior and his general disregard for their feelings. After meeting a new girl at school named Gretchen, Donnie seems to find new purpose in life, but his blackouts become more severe. During these episodes he vandalizes the school and even burns down his neighbor's house. Soon Donnie discovers that he and everyone around him are being manipulated by a mysterious force, the Deus ex Machina (roughly translated this means God of the Machine). If Frank's prediction is right and the world were truly to end, the sky to open up, and the universe torn apart, could anyone or anything stop it? This is the ultimate challenge of Donnie Darko. Can he save the world from oblivion?The film features an all-star cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Beth Grant, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne, Katharine Ross, Patrick Swayze, and Noah Wyle. The film's director, Richard Kelly, proves himself to be one of the most extraordinary up and coming filmmakers.For a greater understanding and appreciation of this film, I also recommend the following:The Hero with a Thousand FacesThe Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for WritersA Brief History of TimeThe Evil DeadE.T. the Extra-TerrestrialHigh School Flashback CollectionBack to the Future - The Complete TrilogyThe Last Temptation of ChristStephen King Gift Set",4,"""Where Is Donnie?""",1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,2595,"['-This', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'conjunction', 'standard', 'edition', 'DVD', 'not', '2-disc', 'Director', 'Cut-2001', 'was', 'year', 'full', 'outstanding', 'films', 'one', 'film', 'stood', 'out', 'others', 'sheer', 'inventiveness', 'brilliant', 'vision', 'director', 'ambition', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'previous', 'statement', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'applied', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'feature', 'debut', 'film', 'director', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'fascinating', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'film', 'life', 'troubled', '80s', 'teen', 'named', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'who', 'blackouts', 'sleepwalking', 'bizarre', 'hallucinations', 'film', 'awesomesoundtrack', 'unfortunately', 'unavailable', 'Amazon.com', 'nifty', 'camerawork', 'visual', 'effects', 'initial', 'release', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'developed', 'loyal', 'fanbase', 'globe', 'especially', 'U.K.', 'where', 'film', 'first', 'achieved', 'cult', 'classic', 'status.The', 'story', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'who', 'having', 'hallucinations', 'are', 'man', 'rabbit', 'costume', 'man', 'simply', 'Frank', 'Donnie', 'world', 'will', 'end', '28', 'days', 'Meanwhile', 'Donnie', 'family', 'peculiar', 'behavior', 'general', 'disregard', 'feelings', 'meeting', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'named', 'Gretchen', 'Donnie', 'find', 'new', 'purpose', 'life', 'become', 'more', 'severe', 'episodes', 'school', 'even', 'burns', 'down', 'neighbor', 'house', 'Soon', 'Donnie', 'everyone', 'are', 'being', 'manipulated', 'mysterious', 'force', 'Deus', 'ex', 'Machina', 'roughly', 'translated', 'God', 'Machine', 'Frank', 'prediction', 'right', 'world', 'were', 'truly', 'end', 'sky', 'open', 'up', 'universe', 'torn', 'apart', 'could', 'anyone', 'anything', 'stop', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Can', 'save', 'world', 'oblivion', 'film', 'all-star', 'cast', 'including', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Holmes', 'Osborne', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'film', 'director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'up', 'coming', 'filmmakers.For', 'greater', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'film', 'also', 'recommend', 'following', 'Hero', 'Thousand', 'FacesThe', 'Writers', 'Journey', 'Mythic', 'Structure', 'WritersA', 'Brief', 'History', 'TimeThe', 'Evil', 'DeadE.T', 'Extra-TerrestrialHigh', 'School', 'Flashback', 'CollectionBack', 'Future', 'Complete', 'TrilogyThe', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'ChristStephen', 'King', 'Gift', 'Set']",Donnie Darko

And, at the end of your first viewing, you too may be asking ""what's up doc?""Tom Keogh, who wrote the review of this film for Amazon, stated that this movie is unclassifiable.  I don't necessarily agree with that view.  Although it is part drama, part romance and part teen movie, it is primarily science fiction, with a sub-category of time travel.  Keogh goes on to add that ""Darko"" is stunningly original--with that I do agree.  Richard Kelly seems to be able to aptly create a David Lynch-like atmosphere that will keep the audience watching--and guessing--until the end.Jake Gyllenhaal does an admirable job in the title role and is supported by an ensemble cast, including his sister Maggie, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell (and even Ashley Tisdale in a small role).  Jake is able to give ""Donnie Darko"" the needed dark off-centered, delusional, mind set that shows in his eyes in the distant haunted stare he conjurs up at just the right time during the story.When it comes to eerie, mysterious science fiction flicks, you'll have a hard time finding another one nearly as good as ""Donnie Darko"".

Every subsequent viewing only deepens your understanding of the movie and makes you appreciate the complexity of Kelly's narrative. There is a lot going on in this film and every time I've seen it, I've noticed something new or seen something that made me think about it in a different way.I first noticed Jake Gyllenhaal in October Sky and was immediately captivated by his performance in that film. He has since produced a fascinating output and diverse body of work. His performance in this movie is nothing short of excellent. He starts off as a confused teenager but Gyllenhaal gradually shows that there is so much more to this character than meets the eye. Is he crazy? Is he some kind of mad prophet? A time traveler? A visionary? A mixed up kid? All of the above? It's quite a soulful, thoughtful performance that is also funny and heartbreakingly tragic.The whole cast is top notch: from ER's Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore to the always reliably Jena Malone and a surprise turn from Patrick Swayze playing a slimy Infomercial guru. More importantly, Donnie's family is so well cast, including Mary McDonnel as his mom and Holmes Osborne as his dad and, of course, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Donnie's sister (and also Jake's real-life one). They really feel and act like a genuine family with all of the little behavioural nuances.As for the DVD, well, if you had any questions as to what it all means, listen to Kelly's audio commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal. While he doesn't explain everything, he does examine a lot of the themes and does fill in some of the gaps. This is one of the best audio commentaries out there for that simple fact. Best of all, he points out all kinds of images that were buried in the background that you don't notice the first few times. For example, as Donnie rides his bike home at the beginning of the film, Frank drives by him in his car. Or, the bunny motif that pops up throughout the movie. It is these attentions to detail that really give this film an added complexity and I'm very appreciative of Kelly for drawing attention to them in his commentary track.The cast commentary is more of a free-for-all but fun to listen to and the many deleted scenes are very interesting to watch and fill in a few more gaps. It should be interesting to see how many of these are put back into the Director's Cut.This is an incredibly original film that never insults your intelligence.

I think of it as a deep movie for shallow people, a darkling ""Dead Poets Society"" run through with heaping doses of ""Rushmore""-ish satire and ""Catcher in the Rye"" bitterness and disillusionment. The title character is a deeply troubled suburban wonderboy going to a private school who is haunted by this spectral, demonic being in a bunny suit, who begins to become, as Vonnegut would say, ""unstuck in time"" (which I recall him saying was a metaphor for going insane). This seems definitely the case.Stylistically, it is very interesting; the director has a great eye in places, putting together some enticing, effective scenes that are pretty to look at.Thematically, though, it sort of implodes under the weight of its own pretensions. The beginning and the end loop together in a way that (in my opinion) ultimately blows down the house of cards set up in the first place. Donnie seems to dish things out without ever taking it, an adolescent fantasy if ever there was one. Without wanting to spoil it, a problem I had with the movie is that it seems to answer the teen angst retort of ""maybe everybody would be happier if I was DEAD!!"" That's as good a way of summing it up as any other.The DVD is worthwhile, particularly because of the 20-some deleted/extended scenes one can watch with or without commentary.

687047,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00005V3Z4,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[7, 8]","Writer-director Richard Kelly's debut feature, the Lynchian Donnie Darko, is a tale of adolescent angst ripe with enigmatic sci-fi underpinnings. Regardless of whether Kelly's titular protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is seemingly deranged or merely on the brink of saving humanity from itself, his time-warping fantasies become startling metaphors for confused teenage male development. This endlessly inventive film is the virtual antithesis of happy-go-lucky '80s teen flicks, hauntingly gauging the pulse of a nation gripped by sexual repression and political uncertainty. Kelly's jabs at Reaganism are about as subtle as his devilishly boldfaced ""Vote Dukakis"" shtick. By film's end, Kelly has expertly transformed his comfortable '80s milieu into an apocalyptic sweat chamber nervously situated between moral complacency and heartbreaking could-have-been hopefulness.""Maybe it's the story of Holden Caulfield, resurrected in 1988 by the spirit of Phillip K. Dick,"" says 26-year-old Kelly of his film. The students at Donnie's school free-float through hallways that begin to resemble portals into an alternate universe. Make no mistake, this is Kelly's deadpan notion of what life was like in the '80s. A school bully openly snorts cocaine by a friend's locker in one hysterical slow-motion shot. Kelly allows ample room for poignancy when the bronze statue of the school's mascot (here, a curious squatting dog) keeps stoic watch over a fat girl named Cherita (Jolene Purdy), whose swan-inspired performance at the school's talent show is rejected in favor of a lame Stacy Q rip-off. The group is named Sparkle Motion, spearheaded by Donnie's young sister Samantha (Daveigh Chase). They are the embodiment of '80s cheese-pop; their performance is ghoulishly applauded while Cherita's hopeful gaze into the future is tossed aside with polite disinterest.A sleepwalking Donnie is lured out of his house by his alter ego (here, a rabbit named Frank), who saves Donnie from the plane engine that crashes into his bedroom. As a result, Donnie comes to believe Frank's prophecy that the world will end in 28 days. Halloween's arrival and the Bush/Dukakis race pitch-perfectly compliment the film's apocalyptic wind-down. With doomsday nearing, Donnie becomes an upstart messiah ridding the town of self-righteous false prophets, though he does find time to innocently woo new-girl-in-town Gretchen (Jena Malone) with retro come-ons like ""do you want to go with me?"" A New Age gym teacher who makes little emotional allowances outside her fear/love lifeline is Donnie's main target. Her downfall is followed by and linked to the fiery demise of a self-help guru played by Patrick Swayze, whose motivational shenanigans Donnie hysterically shoots to the ground.Now in a hectic search for enlightenment, Donnie begins to believe that time travel is possible. For help, he looks to the town's 101-year-old biddy (writer of the fictional tome The Philosophy of Time Travel), who is as eerily frozen in time as her hopeful disciples.

If you like David Lynch, for instance, especially MULHOLLAND DRIVE, you'd love this.  It also has a sort of Alan Ball feeling to the visual narrative.Donnie is a troubled teen who wakes at movie's beginning along the side of an abandoned road.

687053,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005V3Z4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[8, 10]","It has been ten years since ""Donnie Darko"" appeared in theaters and in within those ten years, fans of the film, people who watched and have appreciated the film continue to watch it over and over  and many still give their interpretations of what they think ""Donnie Darko"" is all about.  Many who have had differing opinions of the film especially with the release of the Director's Cut version of the film.But ""Donne Darko"" has a pretty considerable following and yes, has achieved cult status.Not surprising as ""Donnie Darko"" is one of those films that tends to mix reality, non-reality, time-travel and possibly a parallel universe to give a surreal film that people need to watch this film more than once.  And sure enough, with each viewing of the film, people tend to find certain things that they have never seen before.  And I have to agree because each time I watch this film, I always discover something different, something new.So, what is ""Donnie Darko""?""Donnie Darko"" is a film written and directed by Richard Kelly (""Domino"", ""The Box"", ""Southland Tales"") and while it was not successful in the box office (the film was budgeted at $4.5 million and took home $4.1 million), the film has done much better in home video release.In 2002, a DVD for the film was released.  Followed by the ""Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut"" 2004 DVD featuring 21 additional minutes of extra footage and new special features and in 2009, ""Donnie Darko"" was released on Blu-ray with both the Director's Cut and theatrical version of the film.And here we are with a 2011 Blu-ray release titled ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"".  While pretty much the same release as what was released back in 2009, this edition includes the Blu-ray with both theatrical and Director's Cut release and the special features DVD from the popular 2005 Deluxe Edition release but also includes the original 2002 DVD that came with special features (which were not included on the Deluxe Edition or the 2009 Blu-ray release) and a digital copy of the film.VIDEO:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is the same Blu-ray release from 2009.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:#5:1 aspect ratio), the picture quality is quite soft.  The film is not actually vibrant but there is clarity over the previous DVD release.  There is a good amount of grain and black levels are good.  But maybe its the original film elements but I did notice a good amount of noise as well.Overall, ""Donnie Darko"" (theatrical or Director's Cut) has good PQ and while not as vibrant or very detailed compared to modern releases on Blu-ray, the PQ for the film is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  While dialogue and music is what comprises this film's lossless soundtrack, there are times where you hear immersive sound.  From the fall of the airplane engine on Donnie's bedroom, the sound of the worlmhole, the brooding sound of Frank or the sound of 80's music from Echo and the Bunnymen, Tears for Fears or INXS, the audio quality for the film is good but don't expect full immersion via the surround channels.  The film is primarily central and front channel driven!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:Blu-ray:Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Richard Kelly and Director Kevin Smith (Director's Cut) - Actually, a very enjoyable commentary to hear these two filmmakers discuss the film.  And also discussing the differences between both the Director's Cut and theatrical version.Audio Commentary with Cast and Crew (Theatrical Version)Commentary with Richard Kelly and Actor Jake Gyllenhaal (Theatrical Version)DVD DISC TWO:Production Diary - (52:54) Featuring behind-the-scenes footage with optional commentary by director of photography Steven PosterThey Made Me Do It - The Cult of Donnie Darko - (28:05) A featurette on how ""Donnie Darko"" achieved cult status.#1 Fan: A Darkomentary - (13:18) The winner of the donniedarko.com #1 fan contest.Storyboard to Screen  - (7:58) A splitscreen comparison of the storyboards and the actual final cut.Director's Cut Theatrical Trailer (1:02) The original theatrical trailer to ""Donnie Darko"".DVD DISC THREE:Theatrical Trailer/TV Spots - Featuring theatrical trailer, TV Spot - Sacrifice, TV Spot - Darker, TV Spot - ERA, TV Spot - CAST And TV Spot - DARK.Cast and Crew Information - Text based filmography information on the cast and crew.Deleted/Extended Scenes with Optional Commentary - Featuring a total of 20 deleted/extended scenes with optional commentary.Mad World Music Video - (3:21) ""Mad World"" performed by Gary Jules and directed by Richard Kelly.Donnie Darko Website Gallery - Images from the website.The Soundtrack - Liner notes on the ""Donnie Darko"" original soundtrack.""Cunning Visions"" Infomercials - Featuring infomercials  (5:41) with optional commentary by Cunning Visions CEO Linda Connie and Director Fabian Van Patten, His Name is Frank and Book Covers.Art Gallery - Featuring production stills and concept art.The Philosophy of Time Travel Book - Featuring pages from ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"".JUDGMENT CALL:""Donnie Darko"" is a film that I don't know if it's even worth explaining because it's a movie that is meant to be seen and watched again.  And even if you do watch the theatrical version or even the Director's Cut, only those willing to rewatch and dissect the film, to piece together the various clues, will find the film to be quite entertaining.For me, I love films that make you think, I love films that have a lasting rewatch value because you tend to have different interpretations of what is going on and what is happening.  What is real?  What is not real?  Are we watching scenes from Donnie's perspective or reality?  Or is it a parallel, alternate timeline?Needless to say, this is not a film that will be easily accessible for those wanting a simple, formulaic storyline.  And to make things even more confusing is the inclusion of the Director's Cut which has scenes that further make the series a bit more confusing and different, that you either will prefer on or the other.Speaking of the Director's Cut, it's essentially almost like you are getting two different films.  The Director's Cut changes a few musical sequences and adds in other sequences that make you wonder why the Director added them but needless to say, the film was complex to begin with and now it's even made a bit more complex with the additional footage.  Especially the addition of the title cards showing the contents of the Philosophy of Time Travel.Personally, when I watched Donnie Darko, I just thought it was sick individual who didn't take his medication and what we are watching are neither reality but a figment of his imagination.  But then again, that would be too easy of an explanation.So, the next time I watched the film, I felt that perhaps there was  deeper meaning and almost what we see with those who have mental issues and end up hurting or murdering people because they have a problem with society, I often wondered because Donnie had so many issues of society, was always a challenge to authority, that perhaps it was his way of trying to free himself from society.  To conjure any thoughts of escaping the reality through time travel and in some way, while a smart individual, it's his inability to fit in that puts various situations in his mind.I often feel that there is also a message from Kelly that he felt towards society.  Where his sister is a dancer for Sparkle Motion, the parents put too much emphasis on their children to achieve but for the wrong reasons.  We see it at the beginning of the film when Rose is talking to her daughter about Harvard, we see Rose more concerned about Sam's dancing and the parents for the other children are no different.  And I felt that Kelly was trying to demonstrate how messed up society is because of this thinking.  That people are consumed by this culture that there are other things that that should be cared about but no one was willing to make that change.  But it's not just Donnie's parents, it also can be seen with the teacher (played by Drew Barrymore) and other adults where society is literally heading to darkness and decay and perhaps Donnie is the one to fix the world.But that leads me back to the people with mental problems who go on to hurt others.  In their head, they are also thinking they are trying to make the world a better place when in fact, no one sees them like that.  More like a cancer to society... the same can be seen with Donnie Darko, hero for a new generation or a cancer to society?Last but not least, there is almost a lax of parental authority. Children are free to cuss on the table, the father just laughs.  Donnie tells a teacher to shove something up her butt and his father just laughs.  And as for Frank, the demonic rabbit, this is Donnie's figment of his own imagination.  Think of it as the devil and angel on one's shoulders, telling them what to do and not do.  Well, remove that angel out of the equation and substitute that devil for a demonic rabbit.  The rabbit is the yearning of Donnie to be destructive because afterall, who will really care?And the irony of it all, is that destruction is going to happen but yet, Donnie seems to have found love during destruction and to see that love taken away.Of course, I have had several interpretations of this film over the last ten years.  It's an artistic expression that reminds me of a Picasso painting where you can see a painting that looks so off, so dark and bleak, but someone else can see it as light, vibrant and unique.  Donnie Darko is a film that is not mean to be understood 100%.  It's mean for the viewer to take what they got from the film and interpret it their way.  Some may find it complex, some may find it as a simply love story.  Some may find it as a film of sacrifice.  It's all subjective to the viewer.As for the Blu-ray release, unfortunately there is not much new aside from the downloadable digital copy that is included with this 10th anniversary of Blu-ray and the inclusion of the original 2002 DVD release.  Those hoping for a remaster or newer restoration are not going to find any changes from the 2009 Blu-ray release. But for those who have not purchased the 2009 edition on Blu-ray, then by all means, definitely give ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" a chance!  It's definitely worth checking out if you are open to creative, artistic and a different style of film.I have heard cinema fans who talk about how they disliked the film at first but now consider it a masterpiece.  I've read people who love intellectual films to surreal films but couldn't get into ""Donnie Darko"".  Suffice to say, people do have an opinion of it.  There is no doubt that ""Donnie Darko"" Is definitely a different kind of film and possibly one that didn't do well in the box office because of its unusual nature.  But to see how this film has grown its fanbase in the last decade is quite intriguing!Regardless of how my interpretation or others interpretation of the film may be.  Positive or negative...really, it doesn't matter because this is not your average film where one can watch once and give a definitive answer.  It's a film that requires multiple viewings and because of that, it either may peak your interest or turn you off.""Donnie Darko"" is meant to be experienced and re-interpreted.  It's a film that is thought-provoking, intriguing and surreal but at the same time, I can easily say that it may not be accessible for the general public and it may not be for you.  But if you are into artistic expression of cinema, then ""Donnie Darko: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is worth watching!Definitely recommended for the cineaste!",4,"Blu-ray: You may find Richard Kelly's

If that wasn't hard enough he starts having delusions of a big demonic bunny rabbit damned Frank.  Frank tells his he must do certain tasks to save everyone, because the world is comming to an end.

687058,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005V3Z4,D. Litton,"[5, 14]","The loss of words I'm left with after watching ""Donnie Darko"" is not one born of fascination or perplexed wonderment, but one of sheer disappointment over being cheated out of two hours of my life for a story that does everything but shove its originality down the audience's throats. A cross between science fiction, horror, and comedy, the possesses but a few fleeting moments where these elements take flight, but never once do any of them connect in a noticeable pattern.The beginning of the film is exquisite, a terrific combination of character introductions and seething dread. We're introduced to Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal), a teenage boy plagued by schizophrenia and severe depression, that which causes him to converse with a abnormally large, surprisingly spooky rabbit named Frank (later revealed to be played, fittingly enough, by Gregg Araki alumnus James Duval). Such moments provide a terrific amount of underlying dread, that which perhaps causes one's expectations to elevate.We also meet the Darko family: Donnie's parents, Eddie and Rose (Holmes Osborne, Mary McDonnell), and his two sisters, all of whom look upon Donnie as look upon Donnie as the bad seed, though hope for better days ahead. His parents are understanding of his mental state, providing him with therapy and medication; they provide him with all that he needs in hopes of reinstating his mental health.Then one night, things get worse. After Donnie's first meeting with Frank, a freak accident involving a dismembered plane engine results in shaken nerves, though no one is hurt. Donnie, however, is told by his new imaginary friend that there is a window of 28 days, after which the world as he knows it will come to an end. He meets a girl, falls in love, all the while performing strange and sometimes shocking acts at Frank's request.Interesting beginning, and certainly enticing enough to wet one's appetite for more. But the movie's main course turns out to be a less-than-satisfactory concoction of science fiction and the psychological, throwing things like time travel and premonitions into its already-crowded blender of potential ideas. Despite my increasing frustrations with the material's lack of coherence, I found myself strangely entranced by it, blinded by my hope that something would eventually tie things together. In the end, there is an explanation for everything, albeit a very inconsistent and ludicrously disjointed one that only furthers one's discontentment for such a wasted opportunity.The film has a good cast in its favor, though one has to wonder how hard it is for Gyllenhaal to stare dismally into space and look continuously glum and despondent. McDonnell and Osborne play convincingly caring parents, while young Jena Malone is quite the attraction as Donnie's newly acquired girlfriend. The movie features Drew Barrymore as an English teacher who's fed up with abiding by the curriculum, and Patrick Swayze as a fear-fearing fanatic blinded by his fanaticism to his own hypocrisy.In the beginning, I got the feeling that too much was going on; after it was over, I felt as if nothing of any significance had occurred. My main question concerning a film like ""Donnie Darko"" is this: what is this movie trying to say? What is this story really about? Do the filmmakers hope that their bleak portrayal of such cultural elements as censorship and religious fanaticism will mask their inept efforts at creating a coherent storyline that makes no sense in its conclusion?",2,Inconsistent and ludicrously disjointed.,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,3495,"['loss', 'words', ""'m"", 'left', 'watching', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'not', 'one', 'born', 'fascination', 'perplexed', 'wonderment', 'one', 'sheer', 'disappointment', 'being', 'cheated', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'story', 'everything', 'shove', 'originality', 'audience', 'throats', 'cross', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'comedy', 'possesses', 'few', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'where', 'elements', 'take', 'flight', 'never', 'once', 'do', 'connect', 'noticeable', 'pattern.The', 'beginning', 'film', 'exquisite', 'terrific', 'combination', 'character', 'introductions', 'seething', 'dread', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'teenage', 'boy', 'plagued', 'schizophrenia', 'severe', 'depression', 'converse', 'abnormally', 'large', 'surprisingly', 'spooky', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Frank', 'later', 'revealed', 'be', 'played', 'fittingly', 'enough', 'Gregg', 'Araki', 'alumnus', 'James', 'Duval', 'Such', 'moments', 'provide', 'terrific', 'amount', 'underlying', 'dread', 'perhaps', 'one', 'expectations', 'elevate.We', 'also', 'meet', 'Darko', 'family', 'Donnie', 'parents', 'Eddie', 'Rose', 'Holmes', 'Osborne', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'two', 'sisters', 'whom', 'look', 'upon', 'Donnie', 'look', 'upon', 'Donnie', 'bad', 'seed', 'hope', 'better', 'days', 'ahead', 'parents', 'are', 'understanding', 'mental', 'state', 'providing', 'therapy', 'medication', 'provide', 'hopes', 'reinstating', 'mental', 'health.Then', 'one', 'night', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'Donnie', 'first', 'meeting', 'Frank', 'freak', 'accident', 'involving', 'dismembered', 'plane', 'engine', 'results', 'shaken', 'nerves', 'one', 'hurt', 'Donnie', 'however', 'told', 'new', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'window', '28', 'days', 'world', 'will', 'come', 'end', 'girl', 'love', 'while', 'performing', 'strange', 'sometimes', 'shocking', 'acts', 'Frank', 'request.Interesting', 'beginning', 'certainly', 'enticing', 'enough', 'wet', 'one', 'appetite', 'more', 'movie', 'main', 'course', 'out', 'be', 'less-than-satisfactory', 'concoction', 'science', 'fiction', 'psychological', 'throwing', 'things', 'time', 'travel', 'premonitions', 'already-crowded', 'blender', 'potential', 'ideas', 'increasing', 'frustrations', 'material', 'lack', 'coherence', 'found', 'strangely', 'entranced', 'blinded', 'hope', 'something', 'would', 'eventually', 'tie', 'things', 'together', 'end', 'explanation', 'everything', 'very', 'inconsistent', 'ludicrously', 'disjointed', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'discontentment', 'wasted', 'opportunity.The', 'film', 'good', 'cast', 'favor', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'hard', 'Gyllenhaal', 'stare', 'dismally', 'space', 'look', 'continuously', 'glum', 'despondent', 'McDonnell', 'Osborne', 'play', 'convincingly', 'caring', 'parents', 'young', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'quite', 'attraction', 'Donnie', 'newly', 'acquired', 'girlfriend', 'movie', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'abiding', 'curriculum', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'fear-fearing', 'fanatic', 'blinded', 'fanaticism', 'own', 'hypocrisy.In', 'beginning', 'got', 'feeling', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'felt', 'nothing', 'significance', 'had', 'occurred', 'main', 'question', 'concerning', 'film', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'say', 'What', 'story', 'really', 'Do', 'filmmakers', 'hope', 'bleak', 'portrayal', 'such', 'cultural', 'elements', 'censorship', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'will', 'mask', 'inept', 'efforts', 'creating', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'sense', 'conclusion']",Donnie Darko
687059,A1QO7HLN7WBY3Z,B00005V3Z4,DocSmithers,"[13, 14]","This review concerns the newly released Director's Cut of Donnie Darko.Fans take notice there is a new kid on the block, but it's not all peaches and roses.Many of the scenes have been changed.  Some have had material added.  The music has been changed and moved around.  A few of the original songs are gone from the original DVD, Under the Milky Way, and The Killing Moon are gone.They cut out some stuff too.  The scene with Sparkle Motion is indeed done to Notorious, which I read had originally been changed, it hasnt.  While the song Notorious is still there, the scene has changed in other ways.  No longer do you hear someone from the audience yell, ""get off the stage Cherita"" and ""you suck""  during here Autumn Swan dance.  Its weird now, b/c Cherita looks around as does others as if someone had just yelled offensive stuff but since the lines were removed, it just seems strange now.So many other changes... I don't want to bore you with that.  Let me get to my point here people.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko in any form, skip this one and watch the original DVD release without a doubt.For the majority of you who have seen or own Donnie Darko already, this DVD is nothing more than a appendix to the original.

687068,A6LUXI8I8BU6P,B00005V3Z4,"D Strick ""Entertainment D""","[5, 6]","Donnie Darko is one F'ed up movie, but in a good way.  The movie makes you think and you know from the first frames of the film that this is one of those you'd better pay attention to or else risk missing something important.  If you're not prepared to challenge your mind then you may want to wait until your brain is ready to watch this.The movie gives the viewer humor, horror, teen angst, family drama, psychological thriller and sci-fi rolled into one and remains fun to watch and interesting which is the feat, I think, that makes it as popular as it is.  Donnie, the perfectly cast Jake Gyllenhaal, is a darkly troubled teen that is either, crazy, a genius or a cog in a universal scheme that has the power to save the world.  The only consistent thing is that we have to see what he's going to do and say next.Frank the Bunny is his horrific companion in his adventure and helps direct Donnie along his path, helping him to escape death and commit acts of violence that may or may not serve an important purpose.  Or is it all schizophrenic delusion?  This is a movie that a few minutes in you will know that many questions will arise and maybe not all will be answered by the end.Many people who were faithful to the original cut of the film will point out that the director's cut may not be as ambiguous as the original and therefore not as challenging for the viewer.  That may be correct.  I was very proud of myself for figuring out the main plot (well, mostly) on my first viewing, but then I had the help of the time travel book text to assist me whereas, as I understand, the original did not.  I do know that even if the director's cut is ""easier"" it is still one of the most thought provoking and intelligent movies around.  It is also of note that the director does not expect us to forget the original but states this is just a re-mix and can co-exist with the original release.  Considering the subject matter of the film I don't see why that can't work.  He's not pulling a George Lucas on us anyway.To sum it up, the movie is just too interesting to pass up.

Fortunately, the deleted scenes in the DVD kind of take you by the hand and clue you in to what actually happened to Donnie, and why.Having said that, though I'm truly glad I watched them, my overwhelming impression of every deleted scene was that there was a good reason it was deleted, that the movie was better without it.For instance, the scenes with Donnie carving pumpkins with his sister and her attempt to help him, and his heart-to-heart with his Dad, were very well-acted but lessened the sense of Donnie as being isolated, of having to deal with this hideous problem alone.The scene with Elizabeth on the phone gives us way too great a clue toward one of the big surprises later in the film.I'm very, very glad they cut the scene where the shrink tells Donnie his pills are just placebos. Again, that greatly lessens the sense of Donnie as being in a totally crappy situation, a big part of which was being forced to take anti-phychotic drugs. It also paints the doctor, a character we're supposed to like and respect, as being extremely deceitful and manipulative, to have lied about this, not only to Donnie but his very concerned parents. &quot;I think we should increase his medication,&quot; indeed.

Coming into this movie with the plot outline I read a few weeks back really led me to a totally different place, but after seeing the movie I am thankful it went the way it did instead. It is truly amazing. This is an excellent movie which sort of defies classification: thriller, mystery, sci-fi, horror - it just doesn't seem to fit altogether in one category in particular. I have not felt so in awe after a movie since Fight Club. It is just so beautiful. The camera shots, the scenery, everything is so beautiful. The mood is set so well. There is a certain &quot;ambience&quot; which the director/writer Richard Kelly (27 - 28 years old) is able to create which alternately gets you laughing, thinking, or just sends chills up and down your spine. The plot is mind blowing, really really mind blowing. So much information to process, so many mysteries, so many thoughts it is hard to say anything but &quot;Wow&quot;. I am lost in my chills and my hollow stomach, and I feel thoroughly satisfied. You can not watch this movie just once, it just won't let you.

687073,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,B00005V3Z4,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[0, 1]","I had been recommended this movie by two different people, and boy, was this the best recommendation of a film I've had in awhile!!! Before I actually started watching this, I sat in the darkness of my living room and opened my mind.  I told myself that I have no expectations.  It is going to be different, yes, but that is why I am watching it.Richard Kelly is so amazingly creative!!! He is the Quention Tarentino of the new Millennium!!!  While this movie is not violent like Pulp Fiction, it's screenplay is just as original.""Donnie Darko"" certainly may not be the feel good movie of the year nor was it a blockbuster hit.  It is now my favorite movie.Why?  Well, first off, it is unique and I am so tired of the usual romantic comedy or the formulatic action/adventure that has come out in the past year.  2001 had so many movies come out of it that i just did not care for.  This film is one of the select few that really moved me and made me think and was also very intensly entertaining.  If you are of the group of people that just wants to have some silly laughs or want something light and airy, this isn't a movie for you.  I do often like to laugh, and did find myself laughing a few times at this movie, but it is so original>  It's a beautiful story that is told through Donnie's mind.Secondly, the acting is brilliant.  Jake Gyllenhaal, also of the moronic ""Bubble Boy"", is utterly amazing and so in tune to his character, Donnie Darko.  It's as if the character was written for him.  The expressions he makes often appear a bit creepy, but he isn't supposed to be competely sane.  Donnie is, however, a good person, and Jake makes him seem so real and true.  I pay a great deal of attention to what the characters say and do in movies, and I think that Donnie Darko is one of the greatest characters ever written.  Sure he may have some emotional problems, but he is a nice guy who in some respect is willing to do anything for someone he loves.  The film itself is set in October 1988, and Donnie, who is on medication for emotional problems, has this very frightening and menacing looking bunny rabbitt called Frank come to him into a dream.Frank makes Donnie do things, things that maybe in Donnie's mind may seem like the right thing to do but aren't; however, he feels there is some justification in doing them.  While he may feel this way, his school(except for one teacher, played by Drew Barrymore), and the self-help preaching Jim Cunningham, played by Patrick Swayze do not.Talk about the 80's!! Swayze hasn't been in much since those days.Drew Barrymore is the worst thing about this movie.  Is her character supposed to be acted so badly? I have never particularly liked her as an actress.  She was born into an acting family, and I think it is the name that has gotten her into films.  She is the executive producer of Donnie Darko, and I think that they just gave her a role in this because of that reason.  She plays Donnie's English teacher, and while her acting is pretty bad, the character is one that Donnie actually appreciates and to some extent admires.Mary McDonnell, who's most celebrated work is in Passion Fish, plays Mrs. Rose Darko.  She is very good in this and convincing as the mother who feels as if she hasn't done a good job as mother to Donnie.Katharine Ross plays the therapist that Donnie goes to.  She takes the role seriously, and plays it very well yet subdued.No real other names stick out for me in the acting category, but all of the actors and actresses are all very good in this.  They all work very well together.My other reason this is a favorite of mine is that it is set in the 1980's, which is my generation.  I was in junior high and high school then and this brings back great memories for me.I think they could have made more use of 80's music in the film.  The only song I recognized is Tears for Fears, ""Head over Heels"".The main reason I call this favorite is because of it's originality and it's message.  I paid very close attention to Donnie and what he says throughout the film, and I found the message to be a bit complex and hard to understand what was going on until the end.  That is all I will say.One really must take this movie with a complete open mind.  I really can't classify this film into one genre, it is a bit science fiction with it's subplot about time travel, but there is so much to this movie it's just hard to classify for those who contemplate watching it.  If you are up for something completely different and go into it with a mind wide open, I think you will be very pleasantly surprised.This is a sad, demented at times, powerful, and thought provoking film that was so overlooked while in theaters.  It never came anywhere near me on the big screen, only in Cambridge.I rented the dvd, which was so amazingly well done.  I watched a lot of the extras, for fans of the film, it is worth buying with all the extra goodies such as deleted scenes with audio commentary.  I, myself, like to watch with the commentary on after viewing the movie as it brings me into a deeper understanding of what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish.",5,My new Favorite

Some people don't think the Director's Cut adds much, but I think it adds a whole lot. It's a lot easier to understand than the original cut and it flows so much better with most of the deleted scenes from the Donnie Darko DVD included plus splices of the Philosophy of Time Travel and a few changed songs.For those of you who know nothing about this movie I can't tell you anything about it =P It's a movie that you can't summarize other than saying that it's deep and awesome. It starts out with a boy being saved from an airplane engine falling into his room and killing him by a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit named ""Frank"" who tells him that the world will end in 28 days. See? It sounds hokey, but trust me, it's not. The cast is impressive with Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhall, James Duval, and Mary McDonnell. It's written and directed by newcomer Richard Kelly, who has also written the upcoming film Domino.The dialogue in this film is smart and intriguing. The acting is spot-on, and you can't even tell that it was made low-budget. The Director's Cut gives you more of a feeling that every single scene matters, and it does. It has these beautiful scenes that were cut for the sake of having it under 2 hrs, but they add so much to the overall feeling of the plot including information about Donnie's medication, a scene about Watership Down, and some other scenes I'm not at liberty to spoil. If you're trying to figure out which one you should get, get this one! Some people argue that they don't like how he changed the songs, but it's his vision and he put in the songs that he couldn't afford to put in before, it really doesn't change the plot.",5,The must-see cult hit,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,2171,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'yet', 'time', 'wrote', 'review', 'was', ""n't"", 'out', 'yet', 'know', 'extras', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'production', 'diary', 'film', 'optional', 'commentary', 'director', 'photography', 'Steven', 'Poster', 'storyboard-to-screen', 'featurettes', 'Made', 'Me', 'Do', 'Too', 'Cult', 'Donnie', 'Darko', '1', 'Fan', 'Darkomentary.However', 'have', 'seen', 'actually', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'own', 'DVD', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Director', 'Cut', 'much', 'think', 'whole', 'lot', 'lot', 'easier', 'understand', 'original', 'cut', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'DVD', 'included', 'splices', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'few', 'changed', 'songs.For', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'summarize', 'other', 'saying', 'deep', 'awesome', 'out', 'boy', 'being', 'saved', 'airplane', 'engine', 'falling', 'room', 'killing', '6', 'foot', 'tall', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Frank', 'who', 'world', 'will', 'end', '28', 'days', 'See', 'hokey', 'not', 'cast', 'impressive', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'James', 'Duval', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'written', 'directed', 'newcomer', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'who', 'also', 'written', 'upcoming', 'film', 'Domino.The', 'dialogue', 'film', 'smart', 'intriguing', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'was', 'made', 'low-budget', 'Director', 'Cut', 'more', 'feeling', 'single', 'scene', 'matters', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'sake', 'having', '2', 'hrs', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'overall', 'feeling', 'plot', 'including', 'information', 'Donnie', 'medication', 'scene', 'Watership', 'Down', 'other', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'not', 'liberty', 'spoil', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'should', 'get', 'get', 'one', 'people', 'argue', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'changed', 'songs', 'vision', 'put', 'songs', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'put', 'before', 'really', ""n't"", 'change', 'plot']",Donnie Darko

The restored footage does two things.  First, it enhances and fleshes out what was already a wonderful troubled-adolescence story.  Second, and more importantly, it moves the movie away from David Lynchian ambiguity and makes it, instead, what the director always intended: an airtight, completely explicable work of science fiction, one whose basic, essential storyline can be fully grasped on the first viewing (as evidenced by the half a dozen DD newbies I dragged with me, all of whom got it and all of whom loved it).  There is still, of course, an astonishing amount to be grasped on repeated viewings: the more I saw it, the more it moved me.Donnie Darko would be a ***1/2, 9/10 movie if it had no sf element at all, if it were just a conventional story of a troubled teen.

People apparently like it very much when a film ""messes with their heads"" (in the words of one avid reviewer), especially when it espouses ""trendy"" teen philosophies such as the stupidity of mentors (be they teachers or parents) and the meaninglessness of everything.  Classic ""teen angst"" things really.What this film does is it presents us with an antisocial, depressed  teen nutcase who embodies all of the above philosophies, and then justifies his actions.Donnie Darko, who comes from a VERY rich family judging by their house, commits one crime after another in the film, speaks dumb jokes to his ""friends"" and wipes out a whole branch of physics with a single sentence (""wouldn't it be possible to travel backwards through time by travelling faster than light?"").  The movie glorifies him through all of this, presenting him as some kind of messiah who is the only one who has seen the light.Yes, I can see why so many people like this. Wouldn't it be nice if it were REALLY that way? If those stuffy scientists, teachers, and parents were really wrong about everything, despite all of their hard work and dedication? Wouldn't it be nice if all you had to do to know the Truth would be to have some hairbrained notion in your drug-hazed head about what is really right (yes, Donnie Darko is constantly on anti-depression drugs throughout this movie)?This film will indeed ""mess with people's heads"", but it won't clear them, which in my mind is what trully great filmmaking should do.  Donnie Darko, with its false and depressing interpretation of the world, is flawed at its most fundamental level.It's full of plot-holes as well.

Willi,"[0, 1]","Review based on DIRECTOR'S CUT.As GROUND HOG DAY made use of Nietzche's idea of the ""Eternal Recurrance"", DONNIE DARKO uses Nietzsche's ideas of ""Beyond Good and Evil"" -- using terms of the motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze): ""Fear and Love"". Nietzsche thought that life experiences are too variegated to simplistically interpret as being either fully good or fully evil, and this is the critique that Donnie says to his teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) during the ""Fear / Love"" class exercise. Now, as far as plot structure, and where reality begins and ends... It seems that [PLOT SPOILER] Donnie is destined for tragedy, but gets a chance, through some odd combination of divine intervention and time travel, to save the world from the day of destruction. He is led in this by the Rabbit figure, Frank (James Duval), who could be Christ/angel/demon. The events cannot be interpreted simply as good or evil: [PLOT SPOILER] Burning the house down seemed evil (fear-based), but the result was good (an act of love) because the porn ring-leader was busted. [PLOT SPOILER] The scene with Donnie and Frank in the movie theatre: Frank reveils his eye wound (from when Donnie later shot him), but appears fine at the end of the movie. A risen Christ figure? [Going back and reading some of the reviews, there are some who argue that Donnie IS the Christ figure since he sacrifices himself to save others. I'm sticking with Frank, however, because Frank has the Christlike knowledge and power. ""Jesus will walk with me down through the valley..."" Frank was there for Donnie, just as Christ is there for us. Any sacrifice Donnie makes is done in imitation of Christ -- a disciple following his master.]Then again, it could simply be a case of possession, either demonic possession or possession by the Holy Ghost.WWDDD? What Would Donnie Darko Do? Ever since watching this movie, whenever I get an urge to do something maybe not completely rational -- something impulsive -- I see Donnie shouldering his axe with his heart glowing.",4,Beyond Good and Evil,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,2043,"['Review', 'based', 'DIRECTOR', 'CUT.As', 'GROUND', 'HOG', 'DAY', 'made', 'use', 'Nietzche', 'idea', 'Eternal', 'Recurrance', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', 'Nietzsche', 'ideas', 'Beyond', 'Good', 'Evil', 'using', 'terms', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'Jim', 'Cunningham', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Fear', 'Love', 'Nietzsche', 'thought', 'life', 'experiences', 'are', 'too', 'variegated', 'simplistically', 'interpret', 'being', 'fully', 'good', 'fully', 'evil', 'critique', 'Donnie', 'teacher', 'Kitty', 'Farmer', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'Fear', '/', 'Love', 'class', 'exercise', 'Now', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'structure', 'where', 'reality', '[', 'PLOT', 'SPOILER', ']', 'Donnie', 'destined', 'tragedy', 'chance', 'odd', 'combination', 'divine', 'intervention', 'time', 'travel', 'save', 'world', 'day', 'destruction', 'led', 'Rabbit', 'figure', 'Frank', 'James', 'Duval', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'Christ/angel/demon', 'events', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'interpreted', 'simply', 'as', 'good', 'evil', '[', 'PLOT', 'SPOILER', ']', 'Burning', 'house', 'down', 'seemed', 'evil', 'fear-based', 'result', 'was', 'good', 'act', 'love', 'porn', 'ring-leader', 'was', 'busted', '[', 'PLOT', 'SPOILER', ']', 'scene', 'Donnie', 'Frank', 'movie', 'theatre', 'Frank', 'eye', 'wound', 'when', 'Donnie', 'later', 'shot', 'fine', 'end', 'movie', 'risen', 'Christ', 'figure', '[', 'Going', 'back', 'reading', 'reviews', 'are', 'who', 'argue', 'Donnie', 'Christ', 'figure', 'save', 'others', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'Frank', 'however', 'Frank', 'Christlike', 'knowledge', 'power', 'Jesus', 'will', 'walk', 'down', 'valley', 'Frank', 'was', 'Donnie', 'just', 'Christ', 'there', 'sacrifice', 'Donnie', 'done', 'imitation', 'Christ', 'disciple', 'following', 'master', ']', 'Then', 'again', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'case', 'possession', 'either', 'demonic', 'possession', 'possession', 'Holy', 'Ghost.WWDDD', 'What', 'Would', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Do', 'Ever', 'watching', 'movie', 'whenever', 'get', 'urge', 'do', 'something', 'maybe', 'not', 'completely', 'rational', 'something', 'impulsive', 'see', 'Donnie', 'shouldering', 'axe', 'heart', 'glowing']",Donnie Darko

More commentators should bring along their smart friends.The director took deleted scenes from the first DVD's extras and returned them to the film. He added ""comic book"" visual elements like a giant eyeball. The audio was reimagined to heighten the supernatural vibe. A couple of songs were returned to their rightful positions, and an INXS tune now opens the film.The new audio (Dolby Digital 5.1) proves a dramatic, subwoofer-smoking upgrade.

For details of the film, read the other reviews.  Suffice to say that it's a haunting, brilliantly cut film-noir with very interesting characters and superb acting by the entire cast.The Director's Cut, however, lacks.  I firmly believe that director's cuts should add new footage, not change existing footage.  With 20 extra minutes, there's a new scene here and there, but the most obvious changes are in the way certain scenes play out.  The eyeball thing every time Donnie encounters Frank the rabbit doesn't quite seem to fit, and the time travel sequence at the end is just way to busy-looking to be enjoyed.  I much preferred the simplicity of the way that scene played out in the original.  A few tiny segments have been cut entirely, and that bothers me because in this movie, it's the little things that make it interesting.  The 5.1 surround sound has also been re-edited, and again, I prefer the original.  During the Sparkle Motion scene at the talent show, the sound quality of the Duran Duran song is terrible, but halfway through, it fixes itself.  The picture quality is far worse than the original cut.All in all, I think the original is better.  The excerpts from the ""Philosophy of Time Travel"" book is a nice change though.

687096,A1Q1WIWSN6LMDJ,B00005V3Z4,George Waters,"[0, 0]","Donnie Darko is, quite simply, one of the most unique and thought-provoking movies of all time. Originally released just six weeks after 9/11, the film - with its early scene of a jetliner's engine crashing through the roof of a suburban house and its open-ended questions about life and death - initially unsettled many people. On first viewing, you likely will find yourself left with more questions than answers. And therein lies the very goal of the film: to weave a tale that is so multi-faceted that second and third viewings let the viewer into the story that much more.The role of Donnie Darko is brilliantly acted by Jake Gyllenhaal. He completely transforms himself into the title role of Donnie. His sister (in the movie and in real life) is played by the delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal. The film opens with Donnie being found ""asleep"" on a golf course. And so the story begins. Patrick Swayze's performance as a self-help guru selling simplistic solutions (think Tony Robbins with a very, very dark side) shows the man's incredible versatility and his ability to commit to a role. Throughout the movie, constantly brilliant dialogue is intertwined with a soundtrack of 80's era pop that sets the scene perfectly. When Frank, the giant rabbit, first appears, what are we to make of him? Is he a medication-induced hallucination? A being from another dimension? Or something else, something running in parallel with Donnie's life? I think part of the answer lies in the exchange between Donnie and Frank: ""Why are you wearing that stupid bunny suit?"" ""Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?""The Director's Cut restores some critical footage to the film, footage that helps flesh out some aspects of the story while also opening up other avenues for thinking about the story and its meaning. Bonus features include a ""Darkomentary"" about the cult following the film has garnered, that is quite an interesting watch as well. Donnie Darko is a film that I find myself watching again to look for new clues and theories. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy a movie that encourages thinking in new and interesting ways, Donnie Darko is for you.",5,Do you believe in time travel?,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,2163,"['Donnie', 'Darko', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'thought-provoking', 'movies', 'time', 'Originally', 'released', 'just', 'six', 'weeks', '9/11', 'film', 'early', 'scene', 'jetliner', 'engine', 'crashing', 'roof', 'suburban', 'house', 'open-ended', 'questions', 'life', 'death', 'initially', 'unsettled', 'many', 'people', 'first', 'viewing', 'likely', 'will', 'find', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'therein', 'very', 'goal', 'film', 'weave', 'tale', 'so', 'multi-faceted', 'second', 'third', 'viewings', 'let', 'viewer', 'story', 'much', 'more.The', 'role', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'completely', 'title', 'role', 'Donnie', 'sister', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'played', 'delightful', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'film', 'Donnie', 'being', 'found', 'asleep', 'golf', 'course', 'so', 'story', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'performance', 'self-help', 'guru', 'selling', 'simplistic', 'solutions', 'think', 'Tony', 'Robbins', 'very', 'very', 'dark', 'side', 'man', 'incredible', 'versatility', 'ability', 'commit', 'role', 'movie', 'constantly', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', 'intertwined', 'soundtrack', '80', 'era', 'pop', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'When', 'Frank', 'giant', 'rabbit', 'first', 'what', 'are', 'make', 'medication-induced', 'hallucination', 'being', 'dimension', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'running', 'parallel', 'Donnie', 'life', 'think', 'part', 'answer', 'exchange', 'Donnie', 'Frank', 'Why', 'are', 'wearing', 'stupid', 'bunny', 'suit', 'Why', 'are', 'wearing', 'stupid', 'man', 'suit', 'Director', 'Cut', 'critical', 'footage', 'film', 'footage', 'flesh', 'out', 'aspects', 'story', 'also', 'opening', 'up', 'other', 'avenues', 'thinking', 'story', 'meaning', 'Bonus', 'include', 'Darkomentary', 'cult', 'following', 'film', 'garnered', 'quite', 'interesting', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'film', 'find', 'watching', 'again', 'look', 'new', 'clues', 'theories', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'thinking', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'Donnie', 'Darko']",Donnie Darko

I am sure I am not the only one that felt this way. After having co-workers recommend this movie to me a couple of times I decided to rent it. By reading the description I was expecting a horror movie or a slasher film. That is very far from the truth. I would almost call this a comedy. But it's not really that funny. It is a movie that does not fit into one category or even two for that matter.The darkness of this movie and its lead character are overplayed at times. His psychological problems are not the first to be seen on the big screen. But his visions and hallucinations may be. The more scientific the movie gets the more it gets away from what I thought its intended purpose was. It seems by end of the movie you are forced to ask questions and there are some loose ends.The soundtrack is fantastic. Every song rings true of the eighties and is selected for a reason.

687100,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005V3Z4,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[10, 11]","The young Richard Kelly, director of this film, graduated from USC Film School in 1997. This was his first feature film. He has spun a dark multi-layered vision, part dramatic comedy, part science fiction, part fantasy and allegory. The movie almost needs to be classified as three genres stirred gently. He set the world of the film as autumn 1988. It is, in part, a story of adolescent teenae angst, the familiar turf of a John Hughes project, but actually it is more like John Hughes meets David Lynch meets Steven Spielberg. Kelly has put several interesting twists into the high school yarn. It is like a hip FERRIS BEULLER'S DAY OFF.Jake Gyllenhaal, from MIDNIGHT MILE &amp; OCTOBER SKY, played Donnie Darko brilliantly. He was a young man smarter than his teachers, his parents, and his friends. An intrepid curious lad who could ask those questions very few wanted to answer. He is a kid who is being treated for mental illness, even though he may not have been clincially ill. He was outspoken, outrageous, and socially boorish...like most smart teenagers. Roger Ebert wrote,&quot; Donnie is appealingly smart yet sarcastic, more quixotic than eccentric, more curious than frightened.The film's prologue is bang on target. A bright sunrise on dark foothills, suddenly interrupted in the frame by the insertion of the black silhousette of a young man's head. Donnie Darko, there on the hard ground near his bicycle, far from home. After he cycles home, his arrival is treated as familiar behavior; sleep sojourns, adventurous forays into the darkness. That very next night, we witness him roused from his slumber by someone calling his name. He slips outside and we meet the presence that has beckoned him...a medium longshot of someone in a rabbit suit...someone named Frank. But this rabbit, tall as HARVEY, is not a benign companion. Its face is twisted into a demonic death mask. With Darko away from the house, we see an accident happening. Something has fallen out of the night sky, and crashed directly into Donnie's bedroom; a 707 jet engine. If he had been there when the engine came acallin', he would have died instantly. Frank sends Donnie off to do devilish chores; flooding the school, and burning down a house.Nothin is linear or logical in Darko's dreamlike world. His parents are too understanding. His new girlfriend, Jena Malone, is really too easy to get to know. Physical laws, like an axe being buried in a bronze statue, are tweaked and violated. The film can only approach some level of cohesiveness if one is able to conjure up a premise, a through line. For me, most of the characters presented are probably actually a part of Donnie's&quot;real&quot; life, but as they were mostly presented in the bulk of the narrative, they were peopling his &quot;dream&quot; life. One possible explication for the whiplash lunges from drama to comedy to satire to science fiction and fantasy, was that most of the film's narrative occurred from the time Donnie was awakened in his bed, either by Frank's voice, or the faint sound of the 707 engine whistling and plummeting down toward his bedroom. Time was compressed, like in THE INCIDENT AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE on the Twilight Zone, a sort of Alice through the Looking Glass dream squeezed into those precious elongated seconds.This film poses more questions than it offers answers for. There are theories that we, as spiritual entities, can sustain more than one version of our &quot;Self&quot; in parallel dimensions similtaneously. Somehow, it seemed that Donnie called on one of his alternate selves to swing through those last few brief moments, those seconds that stretched out into 30 days.

This is one of the few times a movie improved by adding in the cut scenes (approximately 20 scattered additional minutes). The scenes that first-time writer/director Richard Kelly added enhanced the movie tremendously. The original release at the theater got off to a rough start premiering one month after 9/11 (2001) grossing only $500,000 at the box office. The nation was in mourn and this movie has an aura of gloom. It became a classic once released on DVD and gained a HUGE following. It's extremely mesmerizing and still popular.Most have explained a large part of the premise and theories on this thought provoking, eerie and intriguing movie. Frank, the 6-foot-tall rabbit with what looks like the head of a science-fiction insect is worth seeing alone. Jake Gyllenhaal leads an all-star cast (including his real life sister Maggie as his screen sister). Actor Patrick Swayze plays a surprising role...

687103,A21CFAK6J6H2UI,B00005V3Z4,Goatface Killah,"[39, 41]","Funny, sad, and mind-blowing, 'Donnie Darko' is, quite simply, an excellent movie. The plot is complex and engaging, with Jake Gyllenhaal as the protagonist, followed up by a cast that doesn't leave Jake holding up the movie.Depending on what version of the film you see, the plot can be simple, or very hard to understand.  I saw the original version on television and it was easy to comprehend.  However, I had a lot of questions about little plot strings that weren't tied up.  Just the other day I saw the director's cut. I spent the rest of the night explaining things to the people who watched it with me while simultaneously figuring it out myself.But, let me explain first. In the original version of the movie the plot line goes like this. Donnie Darko is introduced as the protagonist.  He smokes, sees a therapist, and is rude to his parents.  Then comes the fateful night of October 2nd.Donnie is asleep when he hears a voice that tells him to follow it. Donnie gets up and walks out of the house and onto a golf course where a human sized, demented bunny rabbit called Frank tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. At the same time as this encounter a jet engine falls through Donnie's room, which would have crushed him had he not gone out to the golf course. For the next 28 days Donnie goes on certain missions by the bidding of Frank, gets a girlfriend, and finds out about time travel.  I wont tell the ending for the sake of preserving it.In the director's cut there are a few differences.  The beginning is the same. However, this time the end of the world mentioned by Frank really comes into play.  It is explained (and this is explained only in the director's cut) that Donnie is in a tangent universe separate from the primary universe, and it will collapse after a few weeks, creating a black hole in the primary universe destroying all of existence.Donnie goes through the same adventures with a few differences here and there from the original version with the same ending result, only it is much clearer why he does what he does.I highly recommend this movie to those intelects who like to think about the plot, and to those who like dark comedy, and also to anyone and everyone, for this is truly not a film to be missed.",5,The End of the World,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,2284,"['Funny', 'sad', 'mind-blowing', 'Darko', 'quite', 'simply', 'excellent', 'movie', 'plot', 'complex', 'engaging', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'protagonist', 'followed', 'up', 'cast', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Jake', 'holding', 'up', 'movie.Depending', 'what', 'version', 'film', 'see', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'simple', 'very', 'hard', 'understand', 'saw', 'original', 'version', 'television', 'was', 'easy', 'comprehend', 'However', 'had', 'lot', 'questions', 'little', 'plot', 'strings', 'were', ""n't"", 'tied', 'up', 'Just', 'other', 'day', 'saw', 'director', 'cut', 'spent', 'rest', 'night', 'explaining', 'things', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'simultaneously', 'figuring', 'myself.But', 'let', 'explain', 'first', 'original', 'version', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'introduced', 'protagonist', 'therapist', 'rude', 'parents', 'Then', 'fateful', 'night', 'October', '2nd.Donnie', 'asleep', 'when', 'voice', 'follow', 'Donnie', 'up', 'walks', 'house', 'golf', 'course', 'where', 'human', 'sized', 'demented', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'called', 'Frank', 'world', 'will', 'end', '28', 'days', '6', 'hours', '42', 'minutes', '12', 'seconds', 'same', 'time', 'encounter', 'jet', 'engine', 'Donnie', 'room', 'would', 'have', 'crushed', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'out', 'golf', 'course', 'next', '28', 'days', 'Donnie', 'certain', 'missions', 'bidding', 'Frank', 'girlfriend', 'out', 'time', 'travel', 'wont', 'tell', 'ending', 'sake', 'preserving', 'it.In', 'director', 'cut', 'are', 'few', 'differences', 'beginning', 'same', 'However', 'time', 'end', 'world', 'mentioned', 'Frank', 'really', 'play', 'explained', 'explained', 'only', 'director', 'cut', 'Donnie', 'tangent', 'universe', 'separate', 'primary', 'universe', 'will', 'collapse', 'few', 'weeks', 'creating', 'black', 'hole', 'primary', 'universe', 'destroying', 'existence.Donnie', 'same', 'few', 'differences', 'here', 'there', 'original', 'version', 'same', 'ending', 'result', 'only', 'much', 'clearer', 'why', 'what', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'intelects', 'who', 'like', 'think', 'plot', 'who', 'like', 'dark', 'comedy', 'also', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'truly', 'not', 'film', 'be', 'missed']",Donnie Darko
687104,A1ZS82R4RC0I2N,B00005V3Z4,gonn1000,"[0, 0]","One of the most surprising and memorable indie gems of the last years, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a gripping and intriguing cult movie and a fine addition to the coming-of-age genre. Well, to define this movie`s genre is not easy, really, since it goes into sci-fi, teen drama, thriller, suspense and black comedy territory. But the most surprising element is that it actually suceeds at combining all that genres.A powerful experience about growing up, the building of personality, communication, schizophrenia and the frontiers between sanity and madness, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a superb achievement. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the confused, smart and offbeat Donnie, that spends most of his time going to school and talking to a giant rabbit.Richard Kelly`s debut as a director is strong and convincing, providing captivating and absorbing cinematography with an unique mood and an ethereal, oniric and dream-like atmosphere (similar to some David Lynch, Atom Egoyan and even Tim Burton works). Delivering enough surrealistic and gothic details, Kelly truly creates a personal and identifiable style here. The haunting score also helps to keep things interesting, capturing the zeitgeist of the eighties and providing a nostalgic dark feeling (Gary Jules` song &quot;Mad World&quot;, a cover of a Tears for Fears hit, is particularly deep and compelling).&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an amazing cinematic experience that wisely focuses alienation in suburbia, giving a peculiar portrait of teen depression and the coming of adulthood in an original way. This is what independent cinema does better, to offer innovative perspectives about old, been-done-to-death subjects. Richard Kelly`s directorial debut is one of the most interesting american movies of the last years that looks like nothing else.

Strangely, when it was all over I was markedly undecided about it, but she, who prefers historical realism like ""Gangs of New York""-type films, loved it.  We both compared it throughout to ""Heathers"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" in its surrealistic portrayal of high school life.  I watched it again with the first commentary track with the director and Jake Gyllenhaal, and all was made clear.  A lot of our assumptions turned out to be incorrect (which is also true of some other reviews on this board) but I love movies that can be interpreted in different ways and require multiple viewings to see all the clues and story nuances.  After listening to the commentary, now I can't get the movie out of my head and I talk about it all the time.I agree with others that for a small budget, this film is shot beautifully.  The acting is superb, of course, with Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze (who all worked for pocket change, another testament to a great script), and especially newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal. The music is great too, adding great power to some scenes similar to the soundtrack in ""Rushmore"".  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, for such a small budget.

Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) is given a four week head's up of the impending doom for Earth. His imaginary friend Frank lets him know, he's the 6 feet tall terrifying monster bunny in the mirror that no one but Donnie can see.  Even though he's heavily medicated, in therapy, and risking the wrath of his family, Donnie takes Frank the Bunny's advice unconditionally.  He feels he owes it to Frank, he saved his life after all.  His first piece of advice proved dead on, to leave his home in the middle of the night, which prevents Donnie from of all things, being smooshed by a giant jet engine which falls mysteriously to earth and crashes into his bedroom.  Now the troubled Donnie must cope with his secret and very scary friend taking him on eerie and fateful sleepwalking adventures, his troubles with his family and school, and dealing with growing feelings for a girl with her own set of problems, Gretchen, (jena malone) whose Mom is in the witness protection program. The film is imaginative, intelligent, well acted, challenging and thoroughly original.  Gyllenhaal underplays Donnie's mental problems which makes it all the more unnerving and hypnotic to watch.

This is the most original movie EVER!! It has lots of dark humor (absolutely hilarious moments), drama, science-fiction, and horror. So, it basically just mixes every genre possible in a blender to make a highly orignal and awesome movie that will make you think a lot.The movie also has great acting, notably by Jake Gylenhaal as Donnie and his dad was great also. Jena Malone also does a great job as Donnie's cute and sweet girlfriend. The movie also has stars Patrick Swayze (he was hilarious and great) and Drew Barrymore. The movie is about Donnie Darko, a troubled youngster who goes to a psychiatrist. He is visited by his imaginary rabbit reptilian, human sized friend called Frank. He talks to him, telling him to do things and about what will happen in the future. One very strange but amazing moment comes when the engine of a plane lands in Donnie's room. Donnie is bothered by some bullies at school and is very open to tell everyone what's on his mind (his teacher and a public speaker). But, Frank tells him to do bad things, which I won't give away but the greatest mystery is when Frank tells Donnie when the world is going to end. The voice of Frank is powerful and absolutely brilliant, but the actor that carries the movie is Jake Gylenhaal. His emotions, expressions, movemets, and powerful sentences are brilliant. Everything in this movie is brilliant and the ending still has me confused and shocked. That's why this is like Memento a movie that you need to rewatch. This movie is so original that you just have to be amazed and absolutely love it. This one will make you think and think over and over. And lastly, another compelling aspect of this movie is the awesome 80s pop music. It's fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.

687116,A1KLNYFROE90OV,B00005V3Z4,Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...,"[2, 32]","I saw this movie about a year ago because I thought it was going to be a comeback vehicle for Patrick Swayze who is my all time best actor. I celebrate the entire Patrick Swayze collection, my favorites including his portrayal of the post-apocolyptic warrior ""Nomad"" in Steel Dawn, his masterful footwork in ""Dirty Dancing"" and as a ghost in ""Ghost"".As of late though, Patrick has been a little bit out of the mainstream, so I figured that Donnie Darko would be his equivolant of Travolta's comeback in Pulp Fiction. Boy was I wrong.First things first, when I rent a movie that I hear involves Mr. Swayze, I automatically assume that he will be featured in the lead role. Patrick is a major player that shouldn't be pushed to such a small part in favor of the kid from Spiderman. Where as this kid just mumbled and drooped his way through the Donnie Darko part, Patrick Swayze would have provided much more life and charisma which was sorely lacking.Now on to my second (and biggest) bone to pick with the movie. The role that Patrick was cast in seemed promising at first. That is until.....well, let's just say that I'm disgusted with the film industry for the vile direction they made his character go towards. I still haven't decided wether or not I'm mad at Swayze though, since I'm quite positive that had he known what was in store for his character he never would have signed up in the first place. He, like I probably just assumed that he would be playing Darko and that Spiderman would just be in the rabbit costume or whatever. Unfortunately, due to reasons still unclear, Patrick's career has not been revitalized, but instead sabotaged, possibly on purpose.Anyways, on to the rest of the movie, summed up as Howard sees it (that's me). Basically the main character is a kid that is crazy and I guess he kind of repeats parts of his life or whatever. And there's a guy in a rabbit uniform after him (not like a sports mascot, much more creepy). I guess from what I gather it's kind of like the movie ""Groundhog's Day"" but without Chevy Chase. Oh yeah, and Drew Barymore is in it for like a minute, apparently trying to kill her momentum built up by actual good movies like Charly's Angels. I swear that she was probably only in it to pay off a drug debt or something.Now as a Patrick Swayze lover, (no gay jokes please, I know what some of you are thinking and you need to grow up), to say that Donnie Darko is a dissappointment is an understatement. In retrospect I think the best part of the whole movie is when we get to see the wall-sized handpainted mural of Patrick Swayze. If such a thing exists outside of the movie world, I would do ANYTHING to obtain it. I have been searching for a way to get my hands the actual presentation featured in the movie to no avail. When I went on vacation to Universal Studios in Florida I even asked some of the workers but they said they didn't know. I have also written dozens of letters to various art galleries, film studios, video camera manufacturers, and even Patrick himself.In conclusion, I am looking forward to buying this Director's cut of the movie just to see if they have fixed any of the problems with Swayze's character, and hopefully beefed up his part. Also the movie could use more action to make it better. That usually works. One way or the other I will at least have a reference of the enormous Patrick Swayze painting, so if worse comes to worst I can at least commission a local artist to recreate it, or even try to paint it myself if I have to. Please e-mail me if you know the wherabouts of this piece. I wonder if it is hanging in Mr. Swayze's estate, which I guess would make me pretty happy.

We say this with a certainty because of the elements where it succeeds. It has a horror element but it is not horrible in the sense of visual or mental disgust but instead a quiet fear--that same fear that Aristotle says is so important to theater because the audience must feel as if it could happen to them just as easily as the characters. It has an element of science-fiction but its plot (despite a charming continual reference to Deus ex Machina) is not reliant upon some kind of techno-babble postulation or solution. It has a lifelike ensemble of characters--of truly gifted actors giving fine performances--but none of the characters are overtly mean-spirited or caricatures of real people but rather a set of people earnestly attempting to do what they feel is right. There is even a striking moment at the end of  a film where a criminal is shown weeping at his own sense of guilt and hatred towards himself. Finally, it is a film that speaks directly and unflinchingly at the confusion of teenagers but still gives them a sense of something to believe in and the necessity for personal achievement.WHO SHOULD WATCH:Current teenagers and adults who remember their teenage years probably all the way back to 1980 will find watching this film to be a moving experience. Kelly is deadly accurate in his many portrayals and the relevance to youth in this decade is still sharp. Aside from the coming-of-age elements of this movie, it shares some of the most similarities with some striking films involving romance and the chronic pathos of life. For example, the movie Happy Accidents starring Vincent D'Onofrio has thrilled many a romantic audience despite its speculative elements and those people would probably find a great deal of merit here and vice-versa. Also, more mainstream movies--decidedly ""unspeculative""--such as Magnolia and Quiz Show also have audiences who would appreciate Darko and vice-versa. These are all movies that speak to life in the most important ways and we should not ignore them.WHO SHOULD AVOID:Obviously, there's no cathartic rush of violence here. Movie-goers may be misled by the cover and title in to thinking it's some kind of R-rated Alice in Wonderland type romp which it most assuredly is not. For films of this excess--but still done well--look to Predator or perhaps A Clockwork Orange or other similar venues. Also, this is a confusing movie that leaves its audience with a heavy sense of ambiguity. This can be highly irritating to the movie-goer who wants to understand what is happening and yearns for a sense of closure. Indeed, this ambiguity disturbed Roger Ebert quite badly in his initial review.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM",5,One of the very best films,1112054400,"03 29, 2005",2005,2790,"['Darko', 'movie', 'will', 'speak', 'entire', 'generation', 'youth', 'survive', 'test', 'time', 'say', 'certainty', 'elements', 'where', 'horror', 'element', 'not', 'horrible', 'sense', 'visual', 'mental', 'disgust', 'instead', 'quiet', 'fear', 'same', 'fear', 'Aristotle', 'so', 'important', 'theater', 'audience', 'must', 'feel', 'could', 'happen', 'just', 'as', 'easily', 'characters', 'element', 'science-fiction', 'plot', 'charming', 'continual', 'reference', 'Deus', 'ex', 'Machina', 'not', 'reliant', 'kind', 'techno-babble', 'postulation', 'solution', 'lifelike', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actors', 'giving', 'fine', 'performances', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'overtly', 'mean-spirited', 'caricatures', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'set', 'people', 'earnestly', 'attempting', 'do', 'what', 'feel', 'right', 'even', 'striking', 'moment', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'criminal', 'shown', 'weeping', 'own', 'sense', 'guilt', 'hatred', 'towards', 'Finally', 'film', 'directly', 'unflinchingly', 'confusion', 'teenagers', 'still', 'sense', 'something', 'believe', 'necessity', 'personal', 'achievement.WHO', 'SHOULD', 'WATCH', 'Current', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'who', 'remember', 'teenage', 'years', 'probably', 'way', 'back', '1980', 'will', 'find', 'watching', 'film', 'be', 'moving', 'experience', 'Kelly', 'deadly', 'accurate', 'many', 'portrayals', 'relevance', 'youth', 'decade', 'still', 'sharp', 'Aside', 'coming-of-age', 'elements', 'movie', 'shares', 'most', 'similarities', 'striking', 'films', 'involving', 'romance', 'chronic', 'pathos', 'life', 'example', 'movie', 'Happy', 'Accidents', 'starring', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'thrilled', 'many', 'romantic', 'audience', 'speculative', 'elements', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'great', 'deal', 'merit', 'here', 'vice-versa', 'Also', 'more', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'decidedly', 'unspeculative', 'such', 'Magnolia', 'Quiz', 'Show', 'also', 'have', 'audiences', 'who', 'would', 'appreciate', 'Darko', 'vice-versa', 'are', 'movies', 'speak', 'life', 'most', 'important', 'ways', 'should', 'not', 'ignore', 'them.WHO', 'SHOULD', 'AVOID', 'Obviously', 'cathartic', 'rush', 'violence', 'here', 'Movie-goers', 'may', 'be', 'misled', 'cover', 'title', 'thinking', 'kind', 'R-rated', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'type', 'romp', 'most', 'assuredly', 'not', 'films', 'excess', 'still', 'done', 'well', 'look', 'Predator', 'perhaps', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'other', 'similar', 'venues', 'Also', 'confusing', 'movie', 'audience', 'heavy', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'can', 'be', 'highly', 'irritating', 'movie-goer', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'yearns', 'sense', 'closure', 'Indeed', 'ambiguity', 'disturbed', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'quite', 'badly', 'initial', 'review.READ', 'THE', 'ENTIRE', 'REVIEW', 'AT', 'INCHOATUS.COM']",Donnie Darko
687121,AOIPPEZ66R2UP,B00005V3Z4,"Into ""voidness""","[2, 3]","It just so happened that this is the first movie I saw after surviving the bloated, pretentious, and interminable, Magnolia; and, by comparison, Donnie Darko was like a breath of fresh air. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. In addition to the palpably dark and eerie atmosphere that pervades the whole movie, it is one of the more accurate depictions of &quot;teen angst&quot; ever committed to film; and, as a period piece, it also manages to be a very effective depiction of life in those crazy 1980's. This film is a great example of how the budget of a film can often be inversely proportionate to its quality, especially in &quot;Hollywood:&quot; it is better than most films with 30 times its budget. The special features on the DVD are very worthwhile (for once) as well. If you enjoy the movie, I recommend that you take the time to watch the extended and deleted scenes: there are a few, that you might even feel, could've been left in; although you may just admire Richard Kelly's efforts to keep the finished film at around two hours, as the editing never allowed this movie to &quot;drag&quot; (perhaps he felt, as do I, that beyond the two hour mark most films seem to collapse under their own weight). A second viewing of the movie with the audio commentary by Jake Gyllenhaal and Richard Kelly is also very worthwhile. Although the director considers this a sci-fi movie, it comes across as more of a supernatural/psychological thriller, and an intelligent one to boot. Also, as many people have commented, the casting and performances are inspired. The darkly ambient soundtrack is brilliant, as well (even without the pop songs that were too expensive to license for the OST album), and the creepy cover of Tears for Fears' Mad World is just amazing in the context of the film. Also, I'm not much of a Drew Barrymore fan, but praise should go to her for championing this project as an executive producer, and for providing an interesting portrayal of a progressive and idealistic young teacher trying to bring some enlightenment to a conservative private school.I haven't seen a movie that was such a &quot;complete package&quot; (great script, directing, casting, acting, editing, lighting, soundtrack, sets; effective-but-not-overblown special fx, etc.) in a LONG time. One final note: if you have heard about the &quot;demonic bunny thing&quot; prior to seeing this movie, and are put off by it--as, initially, was I--you needn't worry: far from coming off as silly, the &quot;bunny&quot; just adds another dimension of creepiness to this movie.",5,Restored my faith in American film.,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,2584,"['just', 'so', 'happened', 'first', 'movie', 'saw', 'surviving', 'bloated', 'pretentious', 'interminable', 'Magnolia', 'comparison', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'addition', 'palpably', 'dark', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'whole', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'accurate', 'depictions', 'quot', 'angst', 'quot', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'period', 'piece', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'depiction', 'life', 'crazy', '1980', 'film', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'budget', 'film', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'inversely', 'proportionate', 'quality', 'especially', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'better', 'most', 'films', '30', 'times', 'budget', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'once', 'as', 'well', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'recommend', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'might', 'even', 'feel', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'left', 'may', 'just', 'admire', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'efforts', 'keep', 'finished', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'editing', 'never', 'allowed', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'felt', 'do', 'two', 'hour', 'mark', 'most', 'films', 'seem', 'collapse', 'own', 'weight', 'second', 'viewing', 'movie', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'also', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'director', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'more', 'supernatural/psychological', 'thriller', 'intelligent', 'one', 'boot', 'Also', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'casting', 'performances', 'are', 'inspired', 'darkly', 'ambient', 'soundtrack', 'brilliant', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'pop', 'songs', 'were', 'too', 'expensive', 'license', 'OST', 'album', 'creepy', 'cover', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'Mad', 'World', 'just', 'amazing', 'context', 'film', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'fan', 'praise', 'should', 'go', 'championing', 'project', 'executive', 'producer', 'providing', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'progressive', 'idealistic', 'young', 'teacher', 'trying', 'bring', 'enlightenment', 'conservative', 'private', 'school.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'quot', 'complete', 'package', 'quot', 'great', 'script', 'directing', 'casting', 'acting', 'editing', 'lighting', 'soundtrack', 'sets', 'effective-but-not-overblown', 'special', 'fx', 'etc', 'LONG', 'time', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'have', 'heard', 'quot', 'demonic', 'thing', 'quot', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'initially', 'was', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'far', 'coming', 'off', 'silly', 'quot', 'quot', 'just', 'dimension', 'creepiness', 'movie']",Donnie Darko
687122,A1I60AO06W5BMB,B00005V3Z4,Ivo Shandor,"[0, 0]","I came very close to not buying this DVD, based on the bad reviews, but I am SO glad I did!  The negative comments from others led me to expect a horrible abomination from the theatrical cut, but it actually wasn't as bad as I feared.  Different, yes, but not bad.  Yes, the sound effects are different (for a reason), yes the song tracks are different (for a reason), yes, some of the visual effects are different (for a reason).  (The reasons are all fully explained in the commentary of this edition.)  What you have to understand is that the director, Richard Kelly, considers this a ""remix"" version of the film, not a ""replacement"" version.  He's not pulling a George Lucas and trying to usurp previous versions with this one instead; he was given the chance to make an additional version, so he did.What is awesome about this edition, however, is not the changes from the theatrical version, but Kelly's commentary track with Kevin Smith, because it finally makes everything so perfectly clear!  When I first saw the original film on the theatrical DVD release, I kind of understood it, but not completely.  Then I watched the deleted scenes and the extras (the Philosophy of Time Travel excerpts) on the original DVD and I got a much better understanding of the film.With the director's cut, the deleted scenes and the POTT excerpts have now been added into the film, so if you've never seen the theatrical release you might find this one easier to understand.  Completists should be aware that some of the deleted scenes that have been restored to this version are NOT available in the deleted scenes on the theatrical release DVD - they are making their first appearance here.But it's when you listen to the director's cut commentary that we finally get the full explanation of what Kelly meant to convey.  I won't spoil anything here, but even if you think you sort-of understand what the ""manipulated living"" and the ""manipulated dead"" and the ""receiver,"" etc all mean (from the POTT excerpts), it's never really made completely clear until this commentary with Kevin Smith -- even Kevin Smith admits there are things he didn't understand until this meeting with Kelly, like what the other characters were (subconsciously) doing throughout the story to influence Donnie.  And there is one relationship between two characters that I don't think anyone but Kelly got until now.Now, this might mean that Kelly is just really bad at getting his point across on a dramatic, script level - otherwise why would it have taken this many tries to get the true plot structure clear to the audience?  Unless he meant this film to be the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for its generation: deliberate vagueness to leave it open for individual interpretation.And for those wanting to know why Kevin Smith was chosen to assist in the commentary, it's because Kelly was attempting to make the movie more like a comic-book film (despite his own admission of not being knowledgeable about comic books) and asked Kevin Smith along to talk about whether or not he succeeded.Bottom line, which version do I prefer?  Well, the theatrical version, but mostly because I prefer its song selections to the director's cut song selections (song choices and song placements, which both changed).  But to truly understand this film, you need to be familiar with the deleted scenes, the extras, AND the director's cut commentary - all of which are in this edition.",5,Buy This for the Director's Commentary!,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,3436,"['came', 'very', 'close', 'not', 'buying', 'DVD', 'based', 'bad', 'reviews', 'am', 'SO', 'glad', 'did', 'negative', 'comments', 'others', 'led', 'expect', 'horrible', 'abomination', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'feared', 'Different', 'yes', 'not', 'bad', 'Yes', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'different', 'reason', 'yes', 'song', 'tracks', 'are', 'different', 'reason', 'yes', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'different', 'reason', 'reasons', 'are', 'fully', 'explained', 'commentary', 'edition', 'What', 'have', 'understand', 'director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'remix', 'version', 'film', 'not', 'replacement', 'version', 'not', 'pulling', 'George', 'Lucas', 'trying', 'usurp', 'previous', 'versions', 'one', 'instead', 'was', 'given', 'chance', 'make', 'additional', 'version', 'awesome', 'edition', 'however', 'not', 'changes', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Kelly', 'commentary', 'track', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'finally', 'everything', 'so', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'original', 'film', 'theatrical', 'DVD', 'release', 'kind', 'understood', 'not', 'completely', 'Then', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extras', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'excerpts', 'original', 'DVD', 'got', 'much', 'better', 'understanding', 'film.With', 'director', 'cut', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'POTT', 'excerpts', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'added', 'film', 'so', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'release', 'might', 'find', 'one', 'easier', 'understand', 'Completists', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'version', 'are', 'NOT', 'available', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'theatrical', 'release', 'DVD', 'are', 'making', 'first', 'appearance', 'here.But', 'when', 'listen', 'director', 'cut', 'commentary', 'finally', 'get', 'full', 'explanation', 'what', 'Kelly', 'meant', 'convey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'here', 'even', 'think', 'sort-of', 'understand', 'what', 'manipulated', 'living', 'manipulated', 'dead', 'receiver', 'mean', 'POTT', 'excerpts', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'completely', 'clear', 'commentary', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'even', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'admits', 'are', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'meeting', 'Kelly', 'what', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'subconsciously', 'doing', 'story', 'influence', 'Donnie', 'one', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'Kelly', 'got', 'now.Now', 'might', 'mean', 'Kelly', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'getting', 'point', 'dramatic', 'script', 'level', 'otherwise', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'many', 'tries', 'get', 'true', 'plot', 'structure', 'clear', 'audience', 'meant', 'film', 'be', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'generation', 'deliberate', 'vagueness', 'leave', 'open', 'individual', 'interpretation.And', 'wanting', 'know', 'why', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'was', 'chosen', 'assist', 'commentary', 'Kelly', 'was', 'attempting', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'comic-book', 'film', 'own', 'admission', 'not', 'being', 'knowledgeable', 'comic', 'books', 'asked', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'talk', 'not', 'line', 'version', 'do', 'prefer', 'Well', 'theatrical', 'version', 'mostly', 'prefer', 'song', 'selections', 'director', 'cut', 'song', 'selections', 'song', 'choices', 'song', 'placements', 'changed', 'truly', 'understand', 'film', 'need', 'be', 'familiar', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extras', 'director', 'cut', 'commentary', 'are', 'edition']",Donnie Darko

The story is confusing and comples  and requires repeat viewings a visit to the website and the commentary track to understand. To some that may seem like overkill, ""shouldn't the movie explain itself?"". But personally I love the way it works out. You have to really explore and think about this film before you truly understand what has happeend by the time it ends. Visually the film is stunning. Filmed with very subtle camera moves and bright, yet wet looking colors it creates a perfect atmosphere. Everything looks normal, but it carries a slightly eerie feel to it. As far as acting goes, Gyllenhaal is fantastic as the lead. He shows little emotion when normal, however when he goes into his trances he gets this strange glazed look on his face. Great acting. The rest of the cast is very good as well, although I'll never be a big fan of Drew Barrymore. The movie seems very real. The family acts lie kany normal family would. It doesn't feel forced or faked. The teenagers seem like ttenagers, they arent exaggerations of teenage stereotypes. The film is very reminiscent of the real world. Overall this is a very intellectual film. THer is no straightout comedy or action, but the film is funny at times and is often exciting. It would be very hard to find a catagory to fit Donnie darko. Many people will find it confusing and dull, many others will think that it tries to hard to be an intellectual film. However if you enjoy having to think about your movies, or jsut strange movies in general, Donnie Darko is a great pick.

Is Donnie Darko a seer who can see the future through time travel, through a worm hole shooting out his chest?

Which is the main reason this film has replay value, but is a tad overrated by it's cult following, though one of the better films influenced by David Lynch. It does lack the visceral images of violence, sex, & general complex ambiguities of the best surrealistic Lynch, like ""Mulholland Drive, ""Lost Highway,"" & ""Twin Peaks,"" or the memorable characters & dialog from Lynch's, ""Wild at Heart,"" but never the less, a very good film in the head games department.3 1/2 stars = Very Good",3,"This is Not ""Harvey""",1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,895,"['Donnie', 'Darko', 'schizophrenic', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'seer', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'time', 'travel', 'worm', 'hole', 'shooting', 'out', 'chest', 'something', 'else', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'filled', 'Lynch', 'puzzles', 'ambiguity', 'surrealistic', 'realities', 'Good', 'acting', 'abounds', 'great', 'cast', 'filled', 'dark', 'humor', 'smart', 'dialog', 'end', 'something', ""'ll"", 'be', 'contemplating', 'hours', 'watching', 'film', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'replay', 'value', 'tad', 'overrated', 'cult', 'following', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'influenced', 'David', 'Lynch', 'lack', 'visceral', 'images', 'violence', 'sex', 'general', 'complex', 'ambiguities', 'best', 'surrealistic', 'Lynch', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'memorable', 'characters', 'dialog', 'Lynch', 'Wild', 'Heart', 'never', 'less', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'head', 'games', 'department.3', '1/2', 'stars', '=', 'Very', 'Good']",Donnie Darko

Just ask any copywriter (okay, I happen to be one), headlines are murder.And about that rabbit reference, anyone who's seen or even heard of ""Darko"" knows that there's a rather odd-looking, man size rabbit-like character named ""Frank"" appearing in this film. While he's definitely no Bugs Bunny, he does set some looney toons type moments in motion.Example? At Frank's behest, Donnie floods his school and buries an axe in the head on the school mascot statute. It's funny too see at first, but after a moment you also realize it's pretty creepy.But despite Donnie's tendency to turn a little destructive when Frank talks to him, this movie isn't about a tennager going off the deep end and turning into an axe murderer.In fact, it's hard to generalize as to what this film is about. It's about being a teenager in the eighties. It's about relationships. It's about time travel. Trust me, it all makes sense in the film.It certainly doesn't tie everything up in a neat package at the end. But that doesn't mean the ending isn't one of those that leaves you hanging. It does come to a definitve conclusion, one that actually pretty much brings you back to it's starting point.Okay, you just have to see it to appreciate it.

687130,AUKLLB4J4YHNA,B00005V3Z4,Jason!,"[4, 5]","Watching this version made me realize what made the orignal so good: the subtelty, the things left to the imagination.However, I find it hard to really compare it to the original. I think its best to look at these two versions as seperate movies best for different audiences, the director's cut more suitable for mainstream American audiences and the original for people that like what mainstream Americans call ""weird"" movies.If you are a fan of the original movie, then you might think these are bad things...- like another reviewer points out, most of the subtelty is gone.  Things are brought up and made apparent in the director's cut.  The ambiguity made the film more powerful, for me.  This is why Hitchcock films were great.  This is why the chainsaw scene in Scarface was scary without actually seeing the action.  The viewer's mind is much more powerful than anything on the screen could ever be.  This might be a matter of opinion or one's taste though.- The addition of sound design is way to apparent.  Too much birds chirping, classroom noises, background chatter, etc.  This is especially bad in the first 40 minutes of the film.  It makes the film seem less real.  That stuff isn't supposed to take attention away from a film, and it does in this version.  This is probably the only really bad thing about the movie.- It would have been nice to have the choice of watching the original version OR the director's cut on the same disc.  That way people new to the film can see the differences. Nobody really wants to buy a movie twice.If you liked the original version, you will probably appreciate the things that are revealed in the director's cut as new insights.  The time travel stuff is explained a bit more.  Whether thats good or bad is arguable.  I think that is the main aspect that makes it seem like another movie.  In the original it was more mysterious so you just looked at it like something you can't know anyway so you focused more on how this phenomenom effected the characters, rather trying to understand the phenomenom itself.There is dialogue about Donnie being agnostic that I think was better left out.  Now there's going to be a million teenagers suddenly becoming agnostic because its cool.  In my opinion this isn't even really important to the story and seems like a distracting attempt to add depth to Donnie's state of mind.Overall I think the differences make the director's cut a different movie altogether. Its not a better movie or a worse movie, just a different take on the story.  Now you have a movie about time travel itself, parallel universes meeting, a teenager's contemplation about god and dealing with the average troubles of being a teenager.  In the original all these things were presented vaguely enough that you were left to consider the characters and their interaction with each other more than the actual stuff they are going through.If you already have the original, you might as well get the director's cut for the simple reason that you get a new way of looking at the story.If you have never seen either version, I highly suggest both though I prefer the original because its a bit darker and ""weirder"".

Pouliot,"[5, 5]","One of my rules of thumb is that after running across three unrelated references to a film, book or TV show in the same week, it's time to see what all the fuss is about. Recently, several ""Donny Darko"" references drove me to pick up the film. And am I glad they did!""Donny Darko"" is dark, hypnotic and stimulating. A young man, living in an affluent home, is obviously mentally ill. For reasons that are not clear, he leaves his home at  night and wakes to find himself sleeping on backs roads and golf courses. His parents seem concerned, but attribute his odd, though harmless, behavior to his condition. But soon, Donny Darko is hearing voices, and seeing a frightening, adult-sized metal-faced rabbit called Frank who tells him that the world will end within the month.I'm not going to give up any more of the plot, except to say that it involves time travel, lost love and a chance at redemption.Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play Donny. His dark features, sleepy expression and stiff movements perfectly capture the off-kilter inner world of his character. Mary McDonnell does knock-out work as Donny's mother, Rose. She has an incredible ability to portray two or more emotions simultaneously. The scene at the end of the film, in which she waves ambiguously and perhaps knowingly to another character, has had me thinking for days. Did she know? The real star of the movie, though is the music. Brooding, solemn and creepy, it gives the movie a thick, turgid and menacing aspect that perfectly complements the theme and acting.I got a kick from the movie's social commentary. Though Donny seems mad, the world he inhabits is similarly irrational, often making crazy Donny the sanest one in the room. The film is set in a conservative Catholic school in 1988, more for reasons of mood than anti-religious ones. The health teacher worships a local self-help guru and forces the class to watch his amateurish self-help videos. Donny's dad has an irrational hatred of then-presidential contender Michael Dukakis. Donny's friends brag unconvincingly about their exploits and fantasies. Donny's madness seems driven as much by a reaction to the inanity and insanity of his straight-laced, ""normal"" classmates as by his brain chemistry.Which makes it all the more ironic that he finds himself at the nexus of a cosmic tangle.I'm not sure any linear narrative would do justice to the crazy plot of this film. There must be a logical disconnect somewhere. But for a terrifically well-crafted film that comes at you from everywhere and everywhen, ""Donny Darko"" is hard to beat.

I watched The Director's Cut, true--but it was a Net flix version all on a single DVD.I must have been well bolted down in my coffin when this movie was first released because it went completely under the radar. I had seen Jake Gyllenhaal in 2 later films & I thought he was a really good actor. So, I was finding out a little more about him & sort of stumbled on DONNIE DARKO. The film, of course, is fantastic (both literally & figuratively), but I can't help but wonder what it would have been like without JG in it. I felt the same way about AND THEN THERE WILL BE BLOOD with the amazing Daniel Day-Lewis. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfection itself in the leading role. And those eyes! As ambiguous & mystifying as the character he plays. KG could well be the equivalent of a Daniel Day-Lewis for his generation.If permitted, I would have given DONNIE DARKO 4 & 1/2 stars. In the end I witheld a star because I felt there were a few cliches in the film. The ""overweight"" girl & the gym instructor seemed a bit sterotypical. The girl's graceful dance could have been lifted from a TV TWILIGHT ZONE episode where the same idea of the plump woman who fantasies being a ballerina is featured in it too. The chief bully was a bit over the top as well--I mean, snorting coke by the student's lockers--give us a break!Then there's the scene where Donnie's therapist tells him that she has only been giving placebos. If not outright illegal, in the real world it would definitely be seen as the height of unprofessionalism...not to mention dangerous. I suppose it can be chalked up to another one of the ambiguous & ambivalent themes that run throughout the movie.Other than the above, I was very excited by DONNIE DARKO, primarily because it visualized aspects of the Parallel Universe theories that have popped up in the scientific explorations of quantum mechanics. One theory promotes that idea that every possibility of our physical reality plays out with every possibility of outcome on each level. There's a certain element of Nietzche's ""Eternal Recurrence"" in these rather mind-bending concepts as well.Any work of art (especially an American film) that generates the interest & cult-following (true, largely fostered by the ""official website"") has got to have something real going for it. I watched the movie twice in a row & twice the second day. To turn a phrase of Leonard Cohen (""Democracy is coming to the USA""), maybe appreciation for surrealism is finally coming to the USA.",4,Starring The Guy With The Bedroom Eyes,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,2561,"['Preface', 'Apparently', 'are', 'several', 'versions', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', 'floating', 'around', 'watched', 'Director', 'Cut', 'true', 'was', 'Net', 'flix', 'version', 'single', 'DVD.I', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'bolted', 'down', 'coffin', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'went', 'completely', 'radar', 'had', 'seen', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', '2', 'later', 'films', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'So', 'was', 'finding', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'sort', 'stumbled', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', 'film', 'course', 'fantastic', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'JG', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'AND', 'THEN', 'THERE', 'WILL', 'BE', 'BLOOD', 'amazing', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'perfection', 'leading', 'role', 'eyes', 'ambiguous', 'mystifying', 'character', 'KG', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'equivalent', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'generation.If', 'permitted', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'end', 'witheld', 'star', 'felt', 'were', 'few', 'cliches', 'film', 'overweight', 'girl', 'gym', 'instructor', 'seemed', 'bit', 'sterotypical', 'girl', 'graceful', 'dance', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'TV', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'episode', 'where', 'same', 'idea', 'plump', 'woman', 'who', 'being', 'ballerina', 'featured', 'too', 'chief', 'bully', 'was', 'bit', 'top', 'as', 'well', 'mean', 'snorting', 'coke', 'student', 'lockers', 'give', 'break', 'Then', 'scene', 'where', 'Donnie', 'therapist', 'only', 'been', 'giving', 'placebos', 'not', 'outright', 'illegal', 'real', 'world', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'seen', 'height', 'unprofessionalism', 'not', 'mention', 'dangerous', 'suppose', 'can', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'one', 'ambiguous', 'ambivalent', 'themes', 'run', 'movie.Other', 'above', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', 'primarily', 'visualized', 'aspects', 'Parallel', 'Universe', 'theories', 'have', 'popped', 'up', 'scientific', 'explorations', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'One', 'theory', 'idea', 'possibility', 'physical', 'reality', 'out', 'possibility', 'outcome', 'level', 'certain', 'element', 'Nietzche', 'Eternal', 'Recurrence', 'rather', 'mind-bending', 'concepts', 'well.Any', 'work', 'art', 'especially', 'American', 'film', 'interest', 'cult-following', 'true', 'largely', 'fostered', 'official', 'website', 'got', 'have', 'something', 'real', 'going', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'row', 'twice', 'second', 'day', 'turn', 'phrase', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'Democracy', 'coming', 'USA', 'maybe', 'appreciation', 'surrealism', 'finally', 'coming', 'USA']",Donnie Darko

It's challenging, original and does not spoon feed itself to you. While some reviewers have complained that Darko borrows elements from other movies, I don't think this movie is merely a sum of it's parts and I think it's ridiculous to accuse it of doing something that all fiction has been guilty of since hunters told stories around camp-fires. There are few stories, and it's the way they are told that make them stand out.While watching DD, I was constantly reminded of another movie I saw earlier this year...I find it difficult to believe that Ghost World was nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay while Donnie Darko was completely snubbed in every category. I loved Donnie Darko for all the same reasons I hated Ghost World. While Ghost World seems to celebrate apathy and selfishness (to me anyway), Donnie Darko rages against it.What's most striking to me about Darko is that on the surface it's dark, twisted, disturbing and even a little depressing, but beneath the surface it really does celebrate life. I described it to one friend as ""12 Monkeys"" meets ""It's a Wonderful LIfe"" with an evil bunny rabbit. Ok, maybe that's stretching things a bit, but while most people will fail to see anything other than another dark, sci-fi, time travel movie, the open minded viewer will be deeply rewarded... Donnie eventually discovers the beauty and joy of life against inhuman odds. Life is finite, fleeting and precious, and Donnie represents those fortunate few who discover this in time to appreciate it even in complete defiance to the horrors he witnesses. It's easy to be positive when life is a bowl of cherries, but to delve into the darkness and emerge with hope takes real courage.",5,Overlooked and Underrated.,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,1782,"['many', 'movies', 'truly', 'love', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'challenging', 'original', 'not', 'spoon', 'feed', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'Darko', 'elements', 'other', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'merely', 'sum', 'parts', 'think', 'ridiculous', 'accuse', 'doing', 'something', 'fiction', 'been', 'guilty', 'hunters', 'told', 'stories', 'camp-fires', 'are', 'few', 'stories', 'way', 'are', 'told', 'make', 'stand', 'watching', 'DD', 'was', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'movie', 'saw', 'earlier', 'year', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Ghost', 'World', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'best', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'was', 'completely', 'snubbed', 'category', 'loved', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'same', 'reasons', 'hated', 'Ghost', 'World', 'Ghost', 'World', 'celebrate', 'apathy', 'selfishness', 'anyway', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'it.What', 'most', 'striking', 'Darko', 'surface', 'dark', 'twisted', 'disturbing', 'even', 'little', 'depressing', 'surface', 'really', 'celebrate', 'life', 'described', 'one', 'friend', '12', 'Monkeys', 'Wonderful', 'LIfe', 'evil', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'Ok', 'maybe', 'stretching', 'things', 'bit', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'fail', 'see', 'anything', 'other', 'dark', 'sci-fi', 'time', 'travel', 'movie', 'open', 'minded', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'deeply', 'rewarded', 'Donnie', 'eventually', 'beauty', 'joy', 'life', 'inhuman', 'odds', 'Life', 'finite', 'fleeting', 'precious', 'Donnie', 'fortunate', 'few', 'who', 'discover', 'time', 'appreciate', 'even', 'complete', 'defiance', 'horrors', 'easy', 'be', 'positive', 'when', 'life', 'bowl', 'cherries', 'delve', 'darkness', 'emerge', 'hope', 'real', 'courage']",Donnie Darko

Many people will have many different interpretations as to what this movie is all about, however I find this movie to focus primarily on time-travel.  Time-travel gives Donnie the opportunity to control future occurrences from happening.  A movie about manipulation of FATE.  Ok enough of my philosophical analysis.

Watch it like it's a comic about an ordinary, not-so-mild-mannered schoolboy that's been given a mission from up high.  I liked the film a lot when I first saw it, but what makes this one special (like so many others) is the way you get something new each time you see it.There are so many great things to say about the plot that it's not worth it to write.  Suffice it to say that it's never boring, always original and will remind you of.......nothing.  There's no other movie like this.  It's some crazy blend of thriller, comedy, drama and sci-fi. Maybe that means Kelly has created a new category.  I certainly think that any movie that's hard to classify is a winner.The cast is superb. Each play their part to perfection; you sympathize with Donnie, hate the health teacher, love the two young teachers, fear Frank, and despise Jim Cunningham.  When bigshot actors like Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Mary McDonnell all play small parts, you know that they did this movie not for the money, but because they believed in this film.  They trusted the rookie director, and they were right to do so.Religion pervades the film, and with careful viewing, you can get a whole new perspective that hopefully will serve as an inspiration to both agnostics and believers.  It might remind you of another young man that willingly gave his life for the people and the world that he loved.  If you get the DVD, watch all the extras, and you'll get a lot more out of it.

Though the film isn't perfect, freshman writer/director Richard Kelley delivers enough great moments to make Donnie Darko a must-see.I always say that I love seeing a film that shows me something new. Donnie Darko isn't a cliche teen horror film, and it's not a silly sci-fi rehash. I didn't know anything about the plot of Donnie Darko beforehand - and I'm glad I didn't. This film is deep and thoughtful; thoughtful in a way that stays with you intensely for several hours.I must give a specific mention to the original music in Donnie Darko. All of the music is a perfect complement to the film's mood - somber, yet positive. Additionally, the theme song for the film is just stunning. Who would have thought a remake of the Tears For Fears song &quot;Mad World&quot; would work so well here?Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job playing the disturbed lead character. His task is not an easy one. Gyllenhaal has to play a character that is simultaneously smart, scared, and drugged. Also very good is Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother. A lesser director might have painted Donnie's parents as mean or unsympathetic. The only bad performance was Drew Barrymore. Thankfully, she only has about six minutes of screen time.

It's hard to categorize this movie.  Sci-fi?  Teen angst/coming of age?  Horror?  It has elements of everything, and there's nothing to compare it to.I'm not going to detail the plot, because that's been taken care of in the description and in many other reviews.  It's not an easy plot to follow, and the end is confusing.  I highly recommend that you watch this movie more than once, because it makes a lot more sense on repeated viewings.  If you really want to get into what the movie is about, check out the kind-of-cryptic website at donniedarko.com, which has a lot of background info.  In order to get into the time travel/parallel universe, you need to read some of the documents on the website.  You aren't going to figure it out just from watching the movie.  I also suggest doing a google search and seeking out some of the better fan sites, which have explanations of the different universes and how the plot works.Jake Gyllenhall delivers an outstanding performance in this movie.  His character is off-beat, brilliant, disturbed, and handsome.  He's an outcast at school, but so funny that he gains respect of his peers when he has intelligent outbursts railing against the hypocrisy of education.  Another not-to-miss performance is Patrick Swayze as an annoying self-love self-help guru worshipped by the teachers at Donnie's school.Watch this movie once to see what it is all about, and if you are at all intrigued, get ready for some repeated viewings and some research into the backstory.",4,"It's tough to categorize this movie, and it requires repeated watchings",1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,1636,"['finally', 'checked', 'movie', 'out', 'hearing', 'hype', 'one', 'best', 'quirky', 'off-beat', 'movies', 'decade', 'hard', 'categorize', 'movie', 'Sci-fi', 'Teen', 'angst/coming', 'age', 'Horror', 'elements', 'everything', 'nothing', 'compare', 'to.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'detail', 'plot', 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'description', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'not', 'easy', 'plot', 'follow', 'end', 'confusing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'check', 'out', 'kind-of-cryptic', 'website', 'donniedarko.com', 'lot', 'background', 'info', 'order', 'get', 'time', 'travel/parallel', 'universe', 'need', 'read', 'documents', 'website', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'watching', 'movie', 'also', 'suggest', 'doing', 'google', 'search', 'seeking', 'out', 'better', 'fan', 'sites', 'have', 'explanations', 'different', 'universes', 'how', 'plot', 'works.Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'delivers', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'movie', 'character', 'off-beat', 'brilliant', 'disturbed', 'handsome', 'outcast', 'school', 'so', 'funny', 'gains', 'respect', 'peers', 'when', 'intelligent', 'outbursts', 'railing', 'hypocrisy', 'education', 'not-to-miss', 'performance', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'annoying', 'self-love', 'self-help', 'guru', 'worshipped', 'teachers', 'Donnie', 'school.Watch', 'movie', 'once', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'intrigued', 'get', 'ready', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'research', 'backstory']",Donnie Darko

It was just one of those movies that I could watch over and over, and the humor never got old. It is a comedy, with sci-fi undertones, but it is also so much more. Everything in the movie clicked just right, and watching it is always a real joy. When I saw the directors cut, I immediately realized what I had been missing just watching the theatrical version, and I liked it even more. I think personally, you have to watch the theatrical release first, and really think about it, and then watch the Directors Cut and enjoy all the added explainations. The directors cut is a much more solid movie, and everythiing is more crisp, and clear. All of the questions I was left wondering about after watching the theatrical release were answered for me in the directors cut, and that was great. I hear complaints that it took the mystery out of the movie. Well, if Donnie Darko had been a mystery movie, that would suck, but it wasnt', it was a Dark Comedy. The directors cut didn't take any of the darkness, or the comedy out of the movie, it simply made it make more sense. I don't see how any true fan of Donnie Darko could not like seeing a fuller version of the movie they claim to like. The directors cut doesn't take anything away from the movie, it just adds to it.

687145,A3GTH1VXNRYZS5,B00005V3Z4,"""j_james""","[2, 6]","I'm torn on this one, and so I ultimately have to disagree with the reviewer who said there's no middle ground. That you'll either love this film or you'll hate it. I'm living proof that there is middle ground.On the one hand this is a fabulously made flick. The screenwriting is sensational with some bitingly original insults, which for reasons of censorship I can't cite here, and the dialogue throughout is amazing. The characters are fantistically developed, the high schoolers take you back to your high school years and the adults show you what adulthood is all about--that we don't necessarily have things figured out any more than kids do. The audio track is flawless, sound effects fit into the puzzle just as they should, the soundtrack is fabulous (despite the fact that Donnie's little sister dances to a song (Notorius) that wasn't released until 1992). And as for the lighting. Obviously Kelly has done some Gaffer or Director of Photography work before because he has an astute sense of what angles, what shadows to employ. You could almost get the characters' emotions without actors by paying attention to how faces are lit. Or the camera angles and movements they're shot in. With that said, with one exception--Drew Barrymore, who is horribly miscast here--the acting is bitingly true. Jake Gylenhaal debuted to the limelight with October Sky very well. He follows that performance up with an even more accurate performance here. Jena Malone continues to show that she will someday soon be a massive star, despite her ripe young age of 16 and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Donnie's mother, who when she's on it, steals the screen) fit their characters flawlessly.So you wonder: with all these great things said, what can possibly be wrong with this film? two things. First Drew Barrymore, who I usually love and who produced the flick, thus having the ability to pick her role, fails as a hard-nosed, but well intentioned young teacher. And secondly, and much more importantly, it never seems that Kelly has a clear vision of what he wants his debut film to be. At times it seems he wants it to be a teen, high school flick, at times a commentary on pretentiousness or gullability, at times a look into the effects of mental illness on those that suffer the malady and on the family and friends of the mentally ill, at times it feels as though it's going to be a coming of age story, at times it looks into sexual perversions, at times it a psychological analysis of different characters, at times it tries to surprise you with interesting twists and then just to convolude itself as much as humanly possibly, it's a science fiction movie about time travel. Each of these themes are fabulous film fodder, but they can't be clumped into one hour and a fifty minute movie. A combination of a few of them, sure. Or a deep investigation of one or two of them, even better. But ultimately Donnie Darko is too amibitious (something you can rarely say about films today) and can't possibly do all of the things it seems to do want to accomplish. This, on one hand, is a strength. I'd rather have a film be ambitious and scale many genres; it inspires more thought and emotion that way. But sometimes, as a writer or filmmaker, you have to narrow your scope and pick what's most important. It feels as though Kelly never did that. And if he did, I'd loathe seeing the original first couple drafts of this script.",3,"What are we watching? Genius, yes.

I asked them what it was about and they said, ""It's about this guy who sees a demon bunny.""WRONG!It's about so much more. Mental psychosis, time travel, and yes, a demon bunny. But mainly, the story deals with a teen who seems to remind you of a certain Holden Caufield - strange considering Jake Gyllenhaal and lookalike Tobey McGuire both mention Caufield in two films they were in - The Good Girl(Gyllenhaal) and Pleasantville (McGuire).Donnie, the name of the character played by Jake G, is being stalked by a human-sized demonic bunny that tells him to do things. Donnie makes himself listen because the bunny, named Frank, saved his life from a plane engine that crashes into his room. But Frank wants Donnie to do more things, seemingly evil things.....Okay, now that we've officially got the originality factor into play, let me just say that this screenplay, the acting and the mood compel you to watch more. I went from laying on the ground as I watched this film to sitting up on my dumpa at the end, bracing for what might happen next (well, not bracing, but close).The musical score is amazingly fitting, and the acting - even from Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, is first rate. This is a film that will make just about anyone keep sitting and watching.Warnings to those who care - LOTS of profanities in the beginning of the film. Not much violence throughout. A few sexual references while Donnie's in psycho therapy, and no nude scenes but there is one sexual scene that lasts maybe ten seconds but involves kissing on a bed - nothing more.I've seen Bully, At Close Range and War of The Worlds in the last three days and this was hands down better than all of them.One last parting shot - if you don't pay attention all the way through, you'll miss out.

This movie defies classification. It is set in the late 80's during the Bush-Dukakis presidential race.  This fact is not so important other than it gives the movie a concrete sense of time.  This is the when.The film follows teenaged Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Donnie is in therapy for his schizophrenia and the movie switches between what we see as the reality of the movie and his visions of some creature that looks like it has a mask of a disturbing rabbit.  This rabbit is man sized and it instructs Donnie to act and to do things.  Exactly what these things are would spoil some of the wonder of the movie.  In the reality, the film opens with the engine from a plane falling from the sky and crashing through Donnie's bedroom.Donnie's family is fairly normal.  He argues with his sister (played by Jake's real life sister Maggie).  His parents try their best to provide for the family and to help Donnie with his therapy.  He is somewhat of an outcast at school but has his group of friends.  He meets a new girl at school (Jena Malone) and they begin a relationship that feels real despite the strangeness of their meeting.The strength of this movie comes from Donnie's belief in his visions.  It provides motivation as well as tension throughout the movie.  As an added bonus this movie is so original that we don't quite know where the movie is going.  There is discussion of time travel and hints of what might really be going on.As a whole, this is a fascinating movie.

I was wrong.Anyway, the story starts off with Donnie Darko, a young man in the 80's going through,  depression, moral issues, arson issues, wonder of what the world brings and well a huge demonic bunny named Frank which brings news of the end of the world. He is surrounded what seems to be a normal family, a normal sweet younger sister, an older sister with obvious attitude issues and parents who are simply ""worried"" a love interest with the new girl in town, bullies and friends that really don't seem to be doing much in life. Watching Donnie transform through this movie was amazing and shwos his range as an actor. The last 10 minutes is truly thought provoking cinema.I have cable, so that is how I stumbled upon this movie. So, I can't give youexact details on extras for the dvds. However, they h ave played it alot and i've watched it 6-8 times this month and I must say, you won't be dissapointed. I will leave you will a few memorable quotes. Enjoy.Gretchen: My mom had to get a restraining order against my step dad. He has emotional problems.Donnie: Oh, I have those too. What kind does your step dad have?Gretchen: He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.Donnie: Oh.Karen Pommeroy: [to Principle Cole] I don't think that you have a clue what it's like to communicate with these kids. We are losing them to apathy... to this prescribed nonsense. They are slipping away.Donnie: My parents didn't get me what I wanted for Christmas.Dr. Lilian Thurman: What did you want?Donnie: Hungry Hungry Hippos.Dr. Lilian Thurman: And how did you feel, being denied these hungry, hungry hippos?Donnie: Regret.Dr. Lilian Thurman: The search for God is absurd?Donnie: It is if everyone dies alone.Donnie: [in a letter] Dear Roberta Sparrow, I have reached the end of your book and... there are so many things that I need to ask you. Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep.

687155,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B00005V3Z4,John Morgan,"[9, 19]","I really wanted this film to be a GREAT film. Based on the things I'd read about it, and what I'd heard from others, it sounded like the kind of film that would enter that pantheon of films that I must watch at least once every year or so. And I do believe that ""Donnie Darko"" is a very good film - I have watched it three times thus far, and there aren't many films on which I would spend that much time, if I didn't find them intriguing.  The film is extremely well-made, and evokes an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding very effectively.  The gleaming unreality of 1980s suburbia, which seems to just barely cover over some mysterious darkness lurking beneath which threatens to erupt and overwhelm the surface world at any moment, compares favorably with ""Blue Velvet,"" which achieved a very similar effect.  And the characters and dialogue are richly drawn, and we have high school kids who actually look and act like how high school kids really look and act - a rarity in American film.But there are still some quite serious problems that I have with it. One is that I don't find Donnie to be a particularly sympathetic character. He's not especially likable - he's smart, but completely self-absorbed, nihilistic, and the friends he hangs around with seem to be a rather unsavory bunch (the ""Go back to China"" comment from one, said to an Asian student, being a particularly brutal example). He doesn't have any real problems, either, being the privileged only son of affluent and loving parents who give him anything he wants.  There's a bully who bothers him occasionally, and his ""emotional problems,"" although by the end of the film it seems that the latter is, in fact, essential to the ""mission"" he's called on to carry out.  Otherwise, Donnie's life seems quite golden, in the American suburban sense, so it's unclear as to what it really is that troubles him, other than the usual teen angst with which all of us must come to terms.Another weakness is that the film seems to simultaneously try to evoke nostalgia for the 1980s, while some sort of critique of `80s values seems to also be implied.  Such ambivalence isn't necessarily a flaw, particularly in view of the light/dark duality that I mentioned earlier in its depiction of suburbia. However - and I'm entirely willing to admit that this as a personal quirk of mine - as I'm only two years older than the film's creator, Richard Kelly, and come from a very similar suburban background, I can't help but react negatively to this setting, as I experienced the same period in the same way, and found everything about the `80s to be vacuous and repulsive.  I'm still not sure exactly what Kelly's trying to communicate about the `80s - whether it's meant to be ironic or not - but I personally found it to be a turn-off.  This may be deliberate on his part, but I remain uncertain, even after multiple viewings.Although for me, the greatest flaw didn't strike me until I made the mistake of attempting to ""understand"" the film.  I was fortunate enough to see the film for the first time in a theater that happened to be screening the Director's Cut - and the Director's Cut of ""Donnie Darko,"" I must say, is one of the few such re-releases that I felt actually added something of substance to the original theatrical version (which I have seen subsequently), and I recommend that first-time viewers seek out the Director's Cut for this reason.However, even given this advantage, there were still a lot of things about the film that struck me as odd or inconsistent.  I should have just chalked it up to the film's surreal atmosphere, and left well enough alone, but I couldn't help but wonder if I'd missed something on my initial viewing, so I started searching the Internet and going through the special features on the DVD to see what I could unearth.  What I learned changed my view of the film, and not for the better.  (SPOILERS AHEAD!) One thing that stayed with me after my first viewing was the jet engine that plummets from the sky at the film's conclusion - what caused it to fall off the plane in the first place?  There's no way to know this from the film itself.  So I discovered an interview with Kelly in which he explained that the engine was, in fact, ripped away from the body of the plane by Donnie himself, with his ""new-found psychic powers,"" and that Donnie discovers at the climax of the film that he's a kind of superhero, replete with super-powers.  I found this to be kind of a cop-out.  After all, there's absolutely nothing in the film itself to support this...no hint that Donnie has ""super-powers,"" and yet clearly it's a crucial plot point, since the entire plot revolves around this jet engine.  Further reading only soured my view of the film further.  I made the mistake of reading the text of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book (an extra on the DVD) which is featured in the film, although within the film we never find out exactly what's in it.  This is for the better, since I discovered upon reading it that most, if not all of the characters in the film are being manipulated by whatever unseen forces are driving Donnie toward completing his ""mission.""  Frank, the guy in the bunny costume, it turns out is a ""manipulated dead,"" meaning that he was sent back in time from the moment when Donnie kills him in order to instruct Donnie in what he must do.  As for some of the other bizarre moments in the film, it turns out that these unseen forces can also manipulate the living, and that when Donnie's psychiatrist warns him about ""the sky opening up,"" or when Donnie's teacher tells Gretchen to ""sit next to the boy who's the cutest,"" this is all the result of them being manipulated by these mysterious beings.  This, for me, was a huge disappointment.  Basically, what this means is that ""Donnie Darko"" is basically about a bunch of characters who are all automatons without free will, being manipulated by unseen forces for some purpose that is never fully divulged in the film.  My reaction to this revelation was, ""So who cares?""  I watch films to see humans reacting in human ways to human situations.  Discovering that the characters in a film are basically puppets being forced to behave in particular ways is, for me, a devastating blow to the film's integrity, and, as I said before, a cop-out, since it gets the characters out of any responsibility or motive for their own actions.  (END SPOILERS) I was willing to attribute the strangeness of the film to its surreal character, but now that I know Kelly's intent, it's hard to put it out of my head when I'm watching it.  Maybe Kelly is trying to say something about free will and determinism that I haven't figured out, but as it is, knowing that the characters are all being manipulated to do and say certain things, it really takes away a lot of the compelling interest in the story for me.When I've watched the film since finding out these things, I've tried to put what I've read out of my head, more or less successfully, but it's still weakened the film in my eyes. So, my advice to prospective new viewers of this film is: DON'T try to understand it, just take it at face value for what it is. It doesn't stand up to sustained investigation.",3,"A good film, just don't look too deeply into it",1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,7227,"['really', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'GREAT', 'film', 'Based',

687158,A1EKA9XSI641C9,B00005V3Z4,John S. Milas,"[4, 6]","When I first heard about this it sounded like some sort of cheap teen horror slasher movie and I really wasn't interested.  Eventually it became evident that it was quit a popular movie among the more cultured people in my local society, so I became a little more interested in it and finally bought it at the local Best Buy for about $10, which was an excellent price condidering The Matrix is still about $10 and it's about 2 years older than Donnie.  I watched this movie for the first time with my family and was sort of nervous because I wasn't aware of the subject matter to come, but I was pleasantly surprised that everyone including me liked the movie, although my parents were somewhat confused with the meaning of it, I just liked it.  For the calibur of film that this is it's excellent.  By calibur I mean that it wasn't originally made for a large theatre release on a huge budget.  There isn't really anything I can say to you about the movie that gives it away other than the fact that it is extremely funny, creepy, and unsettling all at the same time.  The performances by the cast are true to life.  The film is supposed to take place in 1988, and I guess that the budget and time sort of crippled the feel of it, but when I looked closer I saw a little more 80's soul in it.  The DVD is great also, the commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake G. (will not attempt to spell) is very informative.  I learned several things that would be impossible to figure out by just watching it that make a little more sense now that I know them.  The deleted scenes range from very well done to very pointless (Donnie's rightfully deleted death shot).  The Mad World music video is only good because of the song, the actual video is prety much clips of the movie.  One thing I find odd is the website gallery.  It's just screenshots from [...] and they're very unclear so I don't see the justification in it being on the DVD.  Same thing with the production photos.

687159,AK81WLVD5KGUX,B00005V3Z4,"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[3, 3]","This brilliant film didn't make much of a splash in the U.S. when it appeared in theaters. On DVD, though, it's getting the attention it deserves.Which makes sense, really; it's not the sort of film you grok fully after one viewing. There's a lot going on here, and some of it isn't actually explained within the movie itself. (For the SF time travel/alternate universe skeleton on which the story is hung, you'll probably need to look online for excerpts from _The Philosophy of Time Travel_, a fictional book that figures prominently in the movie.)The time travel bit is pretty well worked out, and this film would be a success purely as an SF film even if that's all it were. In its time-travel logic, it's not quite as tight as the first Terminator film, but it beats the heck out of _Timecop_.But it's lots of other things too: a charming late-80s period piece (with lots of music -- including a gorgeous remake of Tears for Fears' 'Mad World' -- to satisfy anybody out there who happens to be nostalgic for the 1980s); a scorching satire of public education; a dark comedy about puberty, teen angst, and psychological disorders; a comeback vehicle for Katharine Ross and Patrick Swayze; and an extended parable the moral of which is that kids had better save themselves because adults are too screwed up to do the job. (First-time director Richard Kelly wrote the script.)That's a lot of balls to keep in the air -- but, amazingly, the film succeeds in _every one_ of these aspects. Its success is due in no small measure to the mesmerizing performance of Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role; he carries the entire film on his shoulders. His real-life sister Maggie is also delightful as Elizabeth Darko, and the adult Darkos (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) are a refreshing change of pace from the usual teen-film parents. Jena Malone, as Donnie's girlfriend Gretchen Ross, is well matched with Gyllenhaal (and this is the second time in five years that she's appeared in a movie with wormholes in it: she also played Jodie Foster's younger self in _Contact_).The rest of the cast is good too -- especially Swayze, who camps it up as a smarmy self-help guru.Oh, and there's the rabbit. If you're reading this page, you're surely aware that Donnie is visited by a human-sized bunny who persuades him to engage in odd behavior while he's sleepwalking. (You may be reminded of _Harvey_ at this point, but director Richard Kelly says he wasn't thinking of that film at all.)If you haven't seen this movie yet, you may be thinking that a film in which a teenaged boy is visited by a giant rabbit cannot _possibly_ work. I guarantee you you'll be pleasantly surprised once you actually watch it; this one is every bit as good as you've heard it is. In its way it's every bit as mind-blowing as David Lynch's _Mulholland Dr._ -- but with a gentler, lighter touch, a fine sense of humor, and, in its way, a more hopeful message (though every bit as dark as Lynch).It's being rereleased in theaters in an extended 'director's version', but the current DVD includes about twenty deleted scenes that will presumably constitute at least a lot of the additional footage. If you want to see what you've been missing, grab this one while it's still available; if a director's-cut CD is ever released, you can buy it too. And you'll probably want to.",5,'Donnie Darko'?

687165,A1RR6EZ58D0YMG,B00005V3Z4,"JP ""fattyjoe37""","[14, 15]","The theatrical version of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I liked it so much that I went to the world premiere of the director's cut.  Unfortunately what I saw there was a great movie turned into merely a good one.  I'm all for filmmakers going back and making their work available in the way they want it be seen before a studio messed with it (such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Legend), but I don't like it when filmmakers go back and change stuff that they didn't have a problem with in the first place (which is what happened here).  Richard Kelly said that he was happy with the theatrical cut and would only change the opening song to an INXS song that was in the script.  But he changed a lot more in the director's cut then that and makes the movie lose much of its mystery and charm.  Here are some of the major changes:-Music changed: In the opening Echo and the Bunnymen has been changed to INXS.  Even if Richard had wanted to use INXS in the first place he was lucky to find Echo and the Bunnymen because that song works much better.  A lot of other songs are mixed around in the soundtrack now too and not for the better.-Added visual effects: Shots of Donnie's eye filled with crazy imagery doesn't fit with the style of the movie and they look pretty cheesy.  Effects like these also ruin the ending of the movie.-Pages of the book: Throughout the director's cut pages of the Philosophy of Time Travel will appear onscreen basically telling the audience what is happening.  The old version worked much better because you could decide for yourself what was going on.  Now the director is jamming an explanation down your throat.-Added scenes: The only thing the director's cut does right is adding in about 20 minutes of deleted scenes that really flesh out the characters.  But they do make the movie seem overlong and not all of them add anything special.-Audio changes: Some audio has been deleted from the theatrical version.  Not really any reason, but it's for the worse.  And an important scene with Drew Barrymore was cut in half.Now onto the DVD.-Commentary: Richard Kelly and filmmaker Kevin Smith (Clerks) talk about the changes in the director's cut and the movie's cult status.  A very good and entertaining commentary, this is the best extra on the set.  But the commentary with Richard and Jake Gyllenhaal is still the best of the Darko commentaries.-Production Diary: Some behind the scenes footage.  Semi-interesting.-Documentary on the cult of Donnie Darko: A documentary made in Europe that is sort of interesting, but the participants spend most of the time bashing Americans and how they can't understand a movie like this.-#1 Fan: A short film made for a contest to find Donnie Darko's #1 fan.  The guy in this piece is really weird and kinda crazy.  But at the end you'll be laughing your head off.-There are also storyboards and a trailer.The director's cut of Donnie Darko isn't bad, it was just right the first time.

But, first of all and most important, this is a very original, thought-provoking and intense film.The script is like something Neal Stephenson and Stephen King would write togheter: dark, multi-elemented, fantastic characters, it grabs the viewer and tranports him to Donnie's reality without effort. Maybe you won't turn the TV set off feeling very well after watching ""Donnie Darko"", but you also won't forget it easily. Donnie sticks to mind. Relating things like depressive behavior with time-travel made this movie one of the most incredible I've seen in the last decade.Donnie is brilliantly played by one of the upcoming stars of the young generation of talented actors, Jake Gylenhaal. Donnie is a schyzophrenic, uncomprehended kid with lots of relationship problems. Sleepwalking, he does ""errands"" for a fantastic figure, a giant reptile-rabbit named Frank. These errands, always using violence and being supposedly pointless, are all part of a greater scheme conceived by Donnie and his immaginary pal, Frank. And this greater scheme is what is most interesting and original about ""Donnie Darko"". I don't want to give anything away, you'll have to watch it to understand.All characters are well-developed, no matter how little their on-screen time. For example: Noah Wyle's character, one of Donnie's teachers, is always eating someting, because the actor decided his character was diabetic (!). This is the kind of acting I'm talking about. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and, especially, Jena Malone, all of them created believable and coherent characters.But the best thing of all in this amazing movie is the dialogue. It's intelligent, fast, funny. There are many, many memorable quotes, one better than the other.

The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role.The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.So what went wrong' the plot. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple. They don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors the movie holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school English essay.Now Donnie Darko is otherwise superior to Soul Survivors and other films where the ending is a groaner (cough The Village cough), but after all that goodness the magic is gone and they couldn't pull a rabbit out of their hat.

Jake Gyllenhall is dead on perfect as the teenager whose grasp of reality seems to be slipping and who occasionally sees a very spooky looking giant rabbit. The kid is seeing a psychiatrist because his parents are worried not only about his visions but about his past troubles (burning down an abandoned house, etc).What sets this movie apart from other spooky movies is the way the film shows the dark side of high school life. Patrick Swayze, no longer a regular in films, is good as the leader of a cult movement which is more than it appears...and so is its leader. Drew Barrymore is a teacher who wants her students to question their lives and who isn't afraid to confront the principal if she thinks he is wrong.

""Donnie Darko"" is simultaneously none of these and a half-dozen of them.Similar to but better than ""Final Destination"", ""Donnie Darko"" is the story of a psychotic high school kid that hallucinates what appears to be a malevolent rabbit that orders bad things to happen. Sometimes Donnie participates in these events and they always affect him.The plot moves eerily in many directions from this premise, at various times approaching science fiction, horror, family drama, teen angst, comedy, adventure and school hijinks. Not all these types are equally well done and the film occasionally loses focus and direction.An all-star cast -- Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, Drew Barrymore as a misunderstood teacher, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom -- lends consistent credibility to this movie, which sometimes goes quite far afield to make its point.The movie is full of surprises you don't expect. The ending is  a cult classic and watch how moralist-weight loss-lifestyle expert Patrick Swayze -- who is cast wayyyy against type -- gets undressed later in the movie by an act of violence that offers an ironically satisfying twist.Make no mistake, ""Donnie Darko"" is not a great film and will never make to the AFI 100.

687191,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,B00005V3Z4,LeftManOut,"[4, 4]","The first time I saw Donnie Darko almost 3 years ago, I, like a lot of other people, understand very little about what I had just watched. However despite that fact, I was intrigued and extremely drawn to this movie, even though I didn't quite understand what had just happened. Upon multiple viewings of the movie I have more or less come to my own conclusion or meaning about the plot, which like everyone says, will give you something new every time you watch it. That's the beauty of this film, because no two people are going to come to the same conclusion on what the movie is about. With brilliant direction (kudos Richard Kelly), an excellent (an extremely underrated I might add) cast of characters, and a confusing, yet beautiful story, ""Donnie Darko"" is not just another cult film. This is a movie that is timeless.There are very, very few movies that have been able to capture my attention the way Donnie Darko has, and even fewer have prompted me to view the movie multiple times to actually find more and more out about it. However Donnie Darko is one of those films that the first time through, you may not necessarily understand what is going on. To briefly summarize the plot, Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal who gives a phenominal performance) is teenager who has had frequent psychological problems in his life recently, and feels alienated from his family and friends. One night Donnie is awakened by Frank, a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit, who instructs Donnie to follow him. Donnie does, and this ends up saving Donnie's life as a jet engine crashes through his roof that night. Frank informs Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 Minutes and 12 seconds. Donnie then feels like he must obey Frank who makes him do many questionable things, because Frank saved his life. This includes flooding his local high school and burning down the house of a perverted self help guru. Not only that but it appears that Donnie is slipping in and out of multiple realities, leaving you wondering what are hallucinations, and what is really happening. This ultimately leads Donnie into the research of time travel and tangent universes, which becomes one of the most important aspects of the movie. That should give you a basic idea what the movie focuses around. While this might not sound like the most award winning premise, Kelly definitely turns this into one of the must see movies of our generation.There are so many themes and underlying messages running throughout this film, and only upon multiple viewings will you truly discover them all. Like I said one of the best things about this film is that everyone is going to draw something different from it. However Kelly has deliberately made the Donnie character one that everyone can relate to. I can honestly say as a teenager I felt almost exactly like Donnie does in the film, and that makes relating to this movie on different levels so easy. There's also a sense that this alienated teenager is in the end the real hero, despite being looked down upon by his peers and his community. The love story between Donnie and Gretchen is exactly what you would expect it to be like between two teenagers who don't necessarily understand what they are feeling at the time. Part of the charm of this movie is its overwhelming honesty and portrayal of things as they are in real life, not glamoured up for hollywood.Whatever Kelly's intention was when he wrote the movie (which to this day has never been clearly explained), he has made a movie that has touched and connected with a broad audience of people worldwide. It is safe to say that ""Donnie Darko"" isn't just a cult film now, it's a worldwide phenomenon. I promise you will never think about things the same way as you do after viewing this film. I strongly encourage you to see this movie. It is definitely something that will stand out from anything you've ever seen. I still don't feel like I have done this movie justice with my review, but I don't really think any review is capable of doing that. To put it simply, you must see this movie.

""Donnie Darko"" in this case, is one of those underdogs - a completely morbid and fulfilling storyline, with dazzling presentation and a cast of amazing actors playing multi-layered characters.The story revolves around the charismatic, wayward teenager, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal).  This troubled teen is the black sheep of his middle-class family, already having trouble with law for stealing a car and attending psycho-therapy sessions to handle his sleepwalking.  Only after a brief introduction into his life, does the movie immediately dive into the action - in a dream, Donnie is beckoned out of his house by an evil (almost satanic) looking man-sized bunny, Frank.  Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days - the 28th day being Halloween.  Back in reality, a jet-plane engine has fallen from the sky and crashed in Donnie's bedroom - Donnie survives because he had been sleepwalking.  Frank becomes a regular figure in Donnie's dreams and delusions - coercing him to commit random acts of vandalism and arson.  In the meantime, the world around Donnie Darko seems embedded with strange characters, mind-bending encounters and philosphical if not humorously poignant conversations.  Among these are are Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), the self-help guru, his highschool teachers: (Noah Wyle) - who is obsessed with the ideas of time travel - and (Drew Barrymore) who is disillusioned with the education system feeding into Jim Cunnigham , Grandma Death -a prophet of some sorts and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend and another troubled teen, who's mother is hiding out from an abusive ex-husband.  As doomsday approaches, Donnie's visits from Frank the evil bunny become more frequent, as he points out the relivance of time travel in his visits into Donnie's psyche.  Soon, Donnie realizes that many of his encounters with Frank, leave very real impacts on those around him.  (Spoiler:  For instance, Frank tells Donnie to burn down Jim Cunningham's house, that reveals a child pornography ring in his basement).All events and characters lead Donnie down to his final day, where he realizes that certain events have to take place and some people must suffer in order for others to survive.""Donnie Darko"" is magnificant in keeping one's interest, keeping its audience in suspense and sometimes in laughter.  Jake Gyllenhaal does a superb job of playing Donnie as a dark confused teenager in search of understanding and conscious, with the sexiness of Tobey Maguire but with a personality.  The dynamics of family make this story seem very real and close to home, as we are not only drawn to the supernatural, but to the plight of Donnie's mother, who is desperate to guide and understand her son.The basic story, visual effects and music are simple and play well off each other.  However, the much greater story and concept is certainly hard to understand and up for interpretation.  With time travel being a major theme, one might need to watch through the movie two or three times to finally have an idea of what actually happened in what order.  The ending (no spoiler, sorry!) can leave one with the questions: what just happened?... What did he accomplish?

It's a beautiful, heartfelt movie about a troubled young man who sees a giant (scary) bunny.  This movie caused hours of debate between my friends and I when we first watched it.  The fact that it does leave questions is only a part of why I can watch it again and again.  Let's get to why I gave it only four stars.  The director's cut is flawed.  Richard Kelly added pieces from the Donnie Darko book and other images that break up the movie so it doesn't flow as well.  Also, I like the movie starting with Killing Moon by Echo and the Bunnymen as opposed to Never Tear Us Apart by INXS (which is a great song and it works, but it just throws me off cause I had watched it several times before I saw the director's cut.)  Personally I loved the feeling of things being unexplained, which Kelly tried to fix in the director's cut.  There are some great additions though. One of my favorite additions was a scene where Donnie reads a story he wrote in his English class.

687202,A2ODFNHZF5I7R1,B00005V3Z4,"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go...""","[3, 3]","I wish I could understand in this day and age what exactly it is that makes a cult film. Quite possibly, it could be the following that film has and how rabid they are about the film itself. It's true that Donnie Darko has one of the most intense followings a film could ever ask for. The fans of this film has dissected it from the inside out, trying to explain each and every little facet of the film. Which is cool, if you're into having information spoonfed to you and not really interested in figuring it out for yourself.However, I find that to be the most interesting and entertaining aspect of this film. Nothing is really explained in full, but it's not so vague that it's completely impossible to understand. Richard Kelly wrote a brilliant script, full of true emotion and at times horror, complete with science fiction elements so strange it will be hard to wrap your brain around them if you're not entirely into this kind of film. It certainly is not for the casual viewer.But with the Director's Cut, we get a whole new look at the original Donnie Darko, with over twenty minutes of additional footage and a whole new soundtrack.Before Bubble Boy and Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal established himself as an incredible actor with his portrayal of Donnie Darko. Indeed, it is the acting in this film that makes it so powerful. The interaction between the family, especially Jake and real-life-sister Maggie, and the dinner conversation between the two, makes you believe that these two really are siblings in the context of the film and doesn't feel like just two actors going at each other's throats. Maybe it was just the fact that they grew up together that made it so believable, but I tend to lean more towards the fact that the two were just great actors as it was, and used the influence from their lives together to craft a bond between the two characters. And of course, Jena Malone is fantastic, as she always is, as Gretchen Ross, Donnie's girlfriend and unfortunate victim in the whole scheme of things. But there isn't really a weak actor in this film, they all do excellent in their roles, and it all just seems completely believable.The cinematography is also top notch. For a first time director, Richard Kelly really knows what he's doing and always manage to find the most beautiful and effective shots to emphasize what's going on in the scene. That's what's beautiful about this film- there isn't a shot that is just there to further the movie, every shot is there to increase the impact of what is going on in the story. Even in the simplest shots, there is something special about each one that I rarely see in films.Also with this Director's Cut, Richard Kelly changed the score around, which was hit and miss. Most of the time it was a hit, but I miss hearing Echo and the Bunnymen playing during the opening scene. INXS's Never Tear Us Apart isn't bad, but I remember falling in love with The Killing Moon because of the original cut. Basically, that's my only gripe about the change in score, as everything else works perfectly.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko and want a film that isn't a spoonfed 'here's what's going on' formula, do yourself a favor and see it. If you loved the original cut, chances are you'll love this one too. This is a film every should see at least one time, even if just to say you did.",5,Have you ever seen a portal?,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,3358,"['wish', 'could', 'understand', 'day', 'age', 'what', 'cult', 'film', 'Quite', 'possibly', 'could', 'be', 'following', 'film', 'how', 'rabid', 'are', 'film', 'true', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'followings', 'film', 'could', 'ever', 'ask', 'fans', 'film', 'dissected', 'inside', 'trying', 'explain', 'little', 'facet', 'film', 'Which', 'cool', ""'re"", 'having', 'information', 'spoonfed', 'not', 'really', 'interested', 'figuring', 'out', 'yourself.However', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'aspect', 'film', 'Nothing', 'really', 'explained', 'full', 'not', 'so', 'vague', 'completely', 'impossible', 'understand', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'wrote', 'brilliant', 'script', 'full', 'true', 'emotion', 'times', 'horror', 'complete', 'science', 'fiction', 'elements', 'so', 'strange', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'wrap', 'brain', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'kind', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'casual', 'viewer.But', 'Director', 'Cut', 'get', 'whole', 'new', 'look', 'original', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'additional', 'footage', 'whole', 'new', 'soundtrack.Before', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'established', 'incredible', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Indeed', 'acting', 'film', 'so', 'powerful', 'interaction', 'family', 'especially', 'Jake', 'real-life-sister', 'Maggie', 'dinner', 'conversation', 'two', 'believe', 'two', 'really', 'are', 'siblings', 'context', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'just', 'two', 'actors', 'going', 'other', 'throats', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'fact', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'made', 'so', 'believable', 'tend', 'lean', 'more', 'towards', 'fact', 'two', 'were', 'just', 'great', 'actors', 'was', 'used', 'influence', 'lives', 'together', 'craft', 'bond', 'two', 'characters', 'course', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'fantastic', 'always', 'Gretchen', 'Ross', 'Donnie', 'girlfriend', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'whole', 'scheme', 'things', ""n't"", 'really', 'weak', 'actor', 'film', 'do', 'excellent', 'roles', 'just', 'completely', 'believable.The', 'cinematography', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'really', 'what', 'doing', 'always', 'manage', 'find', 'most', 'beautiful', 'effective', 'shots', 'emphasize', 'what', 'going', 'scene', 'what', 'beautiful', 'film-', ""n't"", 'shot', 'just', 'there', 'further', 'movie', 'shot', 'there', 'increase', 'impact', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'Even', 'simplest', 'shots', 'something', 'special', 'one', 'rarely', 'see', 'films.Also', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'changed', 'score', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'Most', 'time', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'hearing', 'Echo', 'Bunnymen', 'playing', 'opening', 'scene', 'INXS', 'Never', 'Tear', 'Us', 'Apart', ""n't"", 'bad', 'remember', 'falling', 'love', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'original', 'cut', 'Basically', 'only', 'gripe', 'change', 'score', 'everything', 'else', 'perfectly.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'want', 'film', ""n't"", 'spoonfed', 'what', 'going', 'formula', 'do', 'favor', 'see', 'loved', 'original', 'cut', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'too', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'even', 'just', 'say', 'did']",Donnie Darko

The opening scene with Donnie awakening from sleep in the middle of an asphalt road on a misty mountain side, was beautiful, but confusing. Although his bike was lying on the side of the road, when he jumped upon it and began pedaling back home, I figured that he had not been in an accident ... so, was he a sleep walker? And, a bit later on, came the infuriating scene where he called his mom a ""bitch.""Naturally my motherly porcupine hackles rose and I prepared myself to hate this film and write a scathing review.And I will write a review (in my part of the world it's almost midnight now, the bewitching hour), but tomorrow.For now, briefly: this is a good film. Intelligent, intuitive, creative. The teenage Donnie Darko (despite calling his mom a bitch, and of course he deserves a sound trashing for that, especially because his mom as well as his dad are good people) is a likeable character, and soon you find out that he does appreciate his parents, his sisters, even his small picturesque American town. However, he is tormented by hallucinations and is taken medication and undergoing therapy. The way I interpret it, Donnie is deeply sensitive, and a genius as well as a psychic. Yes, he's got too much brains, too much heart, and can see into the future as well. The six foot tall monstrous bunny is his sixth sense which he of course does not recognize as such, and I'll bet many of you will disagree with me. That's OK, though, DONNIE DARKO invites you to make your own assumptions and interpretations.If you want to think, watch this movie. But do watch it sober, no booze or what-nots please during viewing! Its effect is psychedelic enough, and you don't want to miss the nuances.I certainly liked the ending. Though completely unrelated, it reminded me of AMERICAN BEAUTY and Kevin Spacey. And of course there is always the possibility that if we want it strongly enough... we might turn back time to right wrongs... and give our loves ones a second chance ... even if it means to sacrifice ourselves....Parents, this is a good film you could watch with your teens.

The film effortlessly and seamlessly combines these disparate and bizarre elements into a single whole, resulting in a very unusual and rivetting film that as I said, almost defies description.

But, I wouldn't leave it at that.  Calling this a great film would lead to a lot of disappointment because it has some serious flaws, not the least of which are plot contrivances that simply don't work.  It is as if the writers wanted to squeeze too many ideas into a single film, and then couldn't intelligently wrap up the many loose ends.  The film's ideas are oftentimes terrific, but they pull the viewer in too many different directions and end with a far more &quot;conventional&quot; and unsatisfying conclusion for all the effective build-up.What I liked most about the film was its ability to depict a nuanced view of psychosis.  It is perhaps the best cinematic portrayal of a schizophrenic mind that I've ever seen, and in some ways reminded me of Polanski's &quot;Repulsion.&quot;  Unfortunately, rather than playing to this strength, the movie then attempts to &quot;explain&quot; the psychotic state through a somewhat silly &quot;Carlos Castaneda&quot; explanation of secret knowledge, emanations from the solar plexus, time travel, and extradimensional physics.  The lovely ambiguities of the first three-quarters of the film melt away into time-looping conventionality, with a lot of inexplicable throwaway issues.  (The burning down of the &quot;positive thinking&quot; guru's house is a good example.  We're never given any clues as to why the future is informing the present about his involvement in a child pornagraphy ring--and directing him to burn the house down.  Kept more ambiguous, the event would have had far greater and more interesting significance.)With the exception of Drew Barrymore, the performances are top knotch.

You could call it noir occult with more than a dash of science fiction and wry social commentary thrown in for leavening.  I tend to thing of it as a Gnostic restatement of 'Back to the Future.'  But the truth is that it is in its own little world of creativity and spookiness.  What director Richard Kelly has done is taken the story of a mildly psychotic teenager caught in someone else's cycle of guilt and expiation and turned it into something that deserves cult film status if nothing else.Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is our semi-psychotic hero.  His insanity sets him apart in the religious sense, making him liable to insights and visions which are crazy by our standards, but pierce one of reality's veils in an almost prophetic way.  When a jet motor comes out of nowhere to crash on his bedroom, from which he has been lured by an evil rabbit time becomes the crisis of Donnie's existence.  Mumbling old women whisper to him and a teacher passes him a secret text in a darkened classroom.  The book 'The Philosophy of Time' is Donnie's only guide in a building whirlwind of events.Donnie is surrounded by a family almost as odd as he is, a psychiatrist determined to drug him into sanity, a kiddie porn maker who does motivational speaking on the side, and a love interest (Jena Malone) that lays the groundwork for a stunning conclusion.  Gyllenhaal's performance captures the inner discontinuities of a character whose world alternates clarity with hallucination, leaving us to wonder what is real and what is inadvertent juxtaposition.As a film, Donnie Darko is as deep as you want to take it in a range between pure spookiness and metaphysics.  By the time I hit the closing credits I found it hard to believe that a modern director would take the risks that Kelly did with this film, and very glad that the risks were taken.  There is a lot of fine detail in the settings and scene action that only gradually sink in.  This was a much more carefully made film than it appears on first contact.By all means see this for its creative adventurism if nothing else.  Stay to watch it a few times and you will find it eerily optimistic despite the tragic thrust of its central story.

687216,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005V3Z4,Matthew Horner,"[6, 9]","I have read several reviews that said that &quot;Donnie Darko' is difficult to classify; indeed, it is composed of an exotic blend of sci-fi, horror, teen angst, and comedy, all seasoned with bits of physics and philosopy, While not a perfectly realized film, it is the kind of movie that many people, myself included, wish there were more of. These are ones that pose challenging or interesting questions, then ususally leave it up to the viewer to come up with answers. Often, there are no real answers, of course, but the thought process is definately stimulated. I appreciate that. I suppose that &quot;Donnie Darko' is best recommended to people who do not like pat answers.This is the story of a boy who is suffering from some major mental problems. He hallucinates, often seeing a hideous, man-sized bunny rabbit which commands him to commit all sorts of anti-social acts. He thinks he can see a sort of time travel path leading people on to whatever is next in store for them. He believes the world is about to end. Is Donnie insane, or has he stumbled upon some truith about existence? Is he a victim of the American upper-middle class lifestyle, one which truly does have some 'Alice Through the Looking-glass' elements to it, or is he more highly evolved than those around him? Did the world, in fact, end, as Donnie foresaw? An Edgar Allen Poe quote came to mind near the film's end: &quot;Perchance everything we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.'What I can't describe here are the visuals, which are fascinating. Perhaps it was just my imagination, but it seemed as if every scene had a slight dream-like quality to it, implying that everything I was seeing could be either a memory or a fantasy about some future event.Richard Kelly has the right stuff to become a major new force in movies. I have been convinced of Jake Gyllenhall's tremendous acting skills since 'October Sky', another highly recommended movie.NOTE: I gave 'Danny Darko' four stars. My real rating is 4 1/2.

It is Richard Kelly's masterpiece (at least from a screen writing perspective), and easily Jake Gyllenhaal's most famous role.The movie follows troubled teenager Donnie Darko's experiences in the weeks after a jet engine falls from a phantom plane and crashes into his room while he is out for the night. He then begins to have some odd visions and out of body experiences. He starts experiencing the world, or rather the universe, in a very different way.For me, this movie blends many different concepts into one bizarre, very visual, sometimes disturbing, and occasionally hilarious creation. It is a tale of existential philosophy and interdimensional time travel, full of paradoxes, and has some intense, deep meanings if you care to dig enough (and see it more than once).With the major exeptions of Jena Malone's character and Gyllenhaal's masterful performance (only his second lead role, after 1999's October Sky), the acting and directing are nothing special. The set and costume design evoke something of a Stepford Wives or Edward Scissorhands visual vibe. They both compliment this idea of a very dark story taking place in a ""perfect"" suburban setting. However, the real reason to watch this movie is for the story and the evolution of Gyllenhaal's character into something metaphysically aware, and possibly posthuman.Final Score: 7/10",4,Review: Donnie Darko (2001),1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,1522,"['Director', 'Richard', 'KellyWriter', 'Richard', 'KellyStarring', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Noah', 'WyleDonnie', 'Darko', 'become', 'modern', 'cult', 'classic', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'masterpiece', 'least', 'screen', 'writing', 'perspective', 'easily', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'most', 'famous', 'role.The', 'movie', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'experiences', 'weeks', 'jet', 'engine', 'phantom', 'plane', 'crashes', 'room', 'out', 'night', 'then', 'have', 'odd', 'visions', 'body', 'experiences', 'experiencing', 'world', 'rather', 'universe', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'concepts', 'one', 'bizarre', 'very', 'visual', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'occasionally', 'hilarious', 'creation', 'tale', 'existential', 'philosophy', 'interdimensional', 'time', 'travel', 'full', 'paradoxes', 'intense', 'deep', 'meanings', 'care', 'dig', 'enough', 'see', 'more', 'once', '.With', 'major', 'exeptions', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'character', 'Gyllenhaal', 'masterful', 'performance', 'only', 'second', 'lead', 'role', '1999', 'October', 'Sky', 'acting', 'directing', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'evoke', 'something', 'Stepford', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'visual', 'vibe', 'compliment', 'idea', 'very', 'dark', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'perfect', 'suburban', 'setting', 'However', 'real', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'story', 'evolution', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'something', 'metaphysically', 'aware', 'possibly', 'posthuman.Final', 'Score', '7/10']",Donnie Darko

I thought I'd rent it, since it seemed to have a loyal following.The story, in a nutshell, is about a troubled teen (Donnie) who has visions of a rabbit who tells him the world will end.The film, written and directed by Richard Kelly, captures the high school angst that I remember so well.  Kelly is young, and some of the film's themes are executed a bit heavy-handedly, but  the heart of the film is constant.  The time travel aspect of Kelly's script was a bit confusing -- I admit, though, that DONNIE DARKO probably requires a few viewings as there are themes and story points that make more sense after repeated viewings.DARKO's cast is really incredible.  What a potpourri of talent!  Mary McDonnell is soooooo good. Katharine Ross (THE GRADUATE, BUTCH CASSIDY) is a welcomed presence as Donnie's therapist.

I would rate the original theatrical release five stars.This director's cut brought to mind William Faulkner's line about writers often having to ""kill their darlings"" in order to meet the demands of a work's wholeness and integrity. Evidently, Richard Kelly was forced to kill his darlings with the theatrical release, and the result was close to perfection, if not perfection itself. The film's emotional force was stunning; its mysteries challenging; its pace so good that hitting pause to get more popcorn was impossible to do; its soundtrack (to my mind) a tour de force. It worked terrifically as a film experience, being a beautiful ""whole"" work of art. Extras that included Roberta Sparrow's book were great ... who really wanted to read the book during the movie anyways? (Which we can now do in the DC.)Which does not mean a director's cut had no hope of working. Or even, maybe, revisions to the soundtrack (although I really think that was touchy business better left untouched). There were some good scenes deleted from the original, mainly between family members, and they didn't seem major pace-cutters. Fortunately, we do get those scenes here, but we also get the overwhelming force of the director's enthusiasm ... and WAY too much embedded detail of his personal vision.On the upside, there's a nifty freedom to that enthusiasm which translates well into the Darko world IF you are also enthusiastic and into ""playing"" with Darko. In other words, if you love Donnie Darko already, you may find this cut a lot of fun. The pacing's completely blown, and the ending comes across flat compared to the original. (Kelly gets too detailed and baroque at the end, thus the impact of the ""Mad World"" music montage--don't want to include spoilers--and last scene is severely undermined.) Yet it's great to have more Darko, however we have to get it. And I don't regret buying this.But if you've never seen the original DVD release, I cannot recommend this DVD set to you over that one. You will probably wonder why a cult ever built up around this film ... what anyone saw in it. You'll be missing that visceral power and compelling wonder that makes movies great and leaves you wanting to see a movie again ... immediately, if possible.Donnie Darko was a little miracle of a film that cast a huge shadow. The director's cut joins many other films that try for bigness and achieve little ... unless, of course, in Darko's case, you've already seen the light and are into shadow-play.",3,Sometimes less is a lot more ...,1108857600,"02 20, 2005",2005,2563,"['rating', 'following', 'refers', 'specifically', 'Director', 'Cut', 'would', 'rate', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'five', 'stars.This', 'director', 'cut', 'brought', 'mind', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'line', 'writers', 'often', 'having', 'kill', 'darlings', 'order', 'meet', 'demands', 'work', 'wholeness', 'integrity', 'Evidently', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'was', 'forced', 'kill', 'darlings', 'theatrical', 'release', 'result', 'was', 'close', 'perfection', 'not', 'perfection', 'film', 'emotional', 'force', 'was', 'stunning', 'mysteries', 'challenging', 'pace', 'so', 'good', 'hitting', 'pause', 'get', 'more', 'popcorn', 'was', 'impossible', 'do', 'soundtrack', 'mind', 'tour', 'force', 'worked', 'terrifically', 'film', 'experience', 'being', 'beautiful', 'whole', 'work', 'art', 'Extras', 'included', 'Roberta', 'Sparrow', 'book', 'were', 'great', 'who', 'really', 'wanted', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'anyways', 'can', 'now', 'do', 'DC', 'not', 'mean', 'director', 'cut', 'had', 'hope', 'working', 'even', 'maybe', 'revisions', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'touchy', 'business', 'better', 'left', 'untouched', 'were', 'good', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'original', 'mainly', 'family', 'members', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'major', 'pace-cutters', 'Fortunately', 'do', 'get', 'scenes', 'here', 'also', 'get', 'overwhelming', 'force', 'director', 'enthusiasm', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'embedded', 'detail', 'personal', 'vision.On', 'upside', 'nifty', 'freedom', 'enthusiasm', 'well', 'Darko', 'world', 'IF', 'are', 'also', 'enthusiastic', 'playing', 'Darko', 'other', 'words', 'love', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'already', 'may', 'find', 'cut', 'lot', 'fun', 'pacing', 'completely', 'blown', 'ending', 'flat', 'compared', 'original', 'Kelly', 'too', 'detailed', 'baroque', 'end', 'thus', 'impact', 'Mad', 'World', 'music', 'montage', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'include', 'spoilers', 'last', 'scene', 'severely', 'undermined', 'Yet', 'great', 'have', 'more', 'Darko', 'however', 'have', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', 'this.But', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'wonder', 'why', 'cult', 'ever', 'built', 'up', 'film', 'what', 'anyone', 'saw', ""'ll"", 'be', 'missing', 'visceral', 'power', 'compelling', 'wonder', 'movies', 'great', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'immediately', 'possible.Donnie', 'Darko', 'was', 'little', 'miracle', 'film', 'cast', 'huge', 'shadow', 'director', 'cut', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'try', 'bigness', 'achieve', 'little', 'course', 'Darko', 'case', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'light', 'are', 'shadow-play']",Donnie Darko
687223,A3IRAQ780H0FMB,B00005V3Z4,"M. Dillard ""Fulleyes""","[1, 1]","&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a dark and intrigueing film from first time writer/director Richard Kelly.  The film is about a troubled teenage boy, named Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal), that receives visits from a creature that looks like a giant rabbit.  This creature takes Donnie on sleepwalking experiences, and ends up making him do some things he most likely would not have done otherwise.  The creature also relays to Donnie that the world will end in 28 days or so. Donnie has a caring family, however they don't seem very protective at all.  The parents allow the children to curse without ever really getting mad at all.  Then one night, while Donnie is sleepwalking, a 747 jet engine falls through the roof of his bedroom.  The FBI investigates the incident, but finds no answer to where the engine came from.  Donnie also has a psychiatrist(Katherine Ross), who uses hypnosis on Donnie to understand his thoughts, and his actions.The film then goes on an original, invilving path, that makes the viewer anxious to find out what will happen to it's characters.  Richard Kelly plays fair in allowing little clues here and the as to what will happen later in the film, though I highly doubt much of anyone will be able to figure out before hand what will happen.  Kelly shows talent here, and demonstrates that he can write one heck of a good screenplay.The ending to &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; I will not say, but I would like to say that this is no where near a straight forward ending, and even repeated viewings may not solve the puzzle.&quot;Donnie Darko&quot; has a great young cast.  It features of course Jake Gyllenhaal, who shows some real talent here, and also shows that he is one of the stars of the future.  Also showing talent is Jake sister in real life, and in the film Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She has an odd, mysterious look to her, but shows she has an ability to act, and is leading lady material.  However, my favorite of the bunch is Jena Malone, who plays Donnie's girlfriend.  She has been in earlier films such as &quot;Stepmom&quot; and &quot;Cheaters&quot;, but here she looks beautiful, and gives a beautiful performance.  &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is a great film, and will have viewers talking, and watching again.",5,"Dark, Intriguing, and one of the best of 2001",1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,2243,"['quot', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'quot', 'dark', 'intrigueing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'film', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'boy', 'named', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'visits', 'creature', 'giant', 'rabbit', 'creature', 'Donnie', 'sleepwalking', 'experiences', 'up', 'making', 'do', 'things', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'otherwise', 'creature', 'also', 'Donnie', 'world', 'will', 'end', '28', 'days', 'so', 'Donnie', 'caring', 'family', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'protective', 'parents', 'allow', 'children', 'curse', 'ever', 'really', 'getting', 'mad', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'Donnie', 'sleepwalking', '747', 'jet', 'engine', 'roof', 'bedroom', 'FBI', 'incident', 'answer', 'where', 'engine', 'came', 'Donnie', 'also', 'psychiatrist', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'who', 'hypnosis', 'Donnie', 'understand', 'thoughts', 'actions.The', 'film', 'then', 'original', 'invilving', 'path', 'viewer', 'anxious', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'characters', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'fair', 'allowing', 'little', 'clues', 'here', 'as', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'later', 'film', 'highly', 'doubt', 'much', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'hand', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Kelly', 'talent', 'here', 'can', 'write', 'one', 'heck', 'good', 'screenplay.The', 'ending', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'quot', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'where', 'straight', 'forward', 'ending', 'even', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'may', 'not', 'solve', 'puzzle.', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'quot', 'great', 'young', 'cast', 'course', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'real', 'talent', 'here', 'also', 'one', 'stars', 'future', 'Also', 'showing', 'talent', 'Jake', 'sister', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'odd', 'mysterious', 'look', 'ability', 'act', 'leading', 'lady', 'material', 'However', 'favorite', 'bunch', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'who', 'Donnie', 'girlfriend', 'been', 'earlier', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Stepmom', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cheaters', 'quot', 'here', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'quot', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'viewers', 'talking', 'watching', 'again']",Donnie Darko
687224,ADTUS88NFTW23,B00005V3Z4,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[6, 8]","I am a little torn on the ""Donnie Darko Director's Cut"".  The differences from the Theatrical Cut in presentation are subtle, and the differences in character are grand.I really enjoy the Theatrical Cut.  I think it leaves so much to the imagination that the impact of the film is felt greater.  At the San Diego Comic Con, Richard Kelly told the audience how the Director's Cut came about.  ""Donnie Darko"" never got it's fair shake when it was first released.  This was probably due to the film being released soon after 9-11, when people (quite understandably) were not in the mood to see a dark movie about plane parts falling from the sky and the end of a world.When the film did surprisingly well on home DVD release, the studio allowed Kelly to add in a few things that he had always wanted to, in order to give them an excuse to release the movie theatrically again and give it another chance.  This was very good on the studio's part (unfortunately, they didn't market it very well on it's second release).  Anyway, now we have this new version.I was set off by the new opening.  Don't worry, there are no big spoilers here.  The only difference in the new opening is the music.  Richard Kelly said that the opening was designed to go with ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS, and I can see that; but it works SO WELL with Echo and the Bunnymen's ""Killing Moon"".  Now that INXS would finally sell them the rights for the new release, I can see why they used it.  It still seems odd, though, since I'm used to (and prefer) the other song.After that initial startling change, I settled into this new version of the movie.  I did enjoy the further interaction between the members of Donnie's family.  I think that added a lot to the film.  I'm on the fence about the additions with the explanations of the book and time travel.  I think, sometimes, not knowing details can be better.  Sometimes the audience's imagination can be much more impressive than the film maker's.  Not completely understanding the Theatrical Cut when I first watched it is one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed about it.I'd write more, but I don't want to give the film away for those who haven't seen it.  Even though they are 90% the same, these two films feel like very different movies.  It's one of those rare films where I'm going to own both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's Cut.  I've done this with The Exorcist, Legend, Brazil, Army of Darkness, and maybe a few other movies where both versions have left me with very distinct feelings, and different things to think about.  If you have never seen ""Donnie Darko"", I think you might want to start with the Theatrical Cut.  After that, if you are confused or simply want more of this great movie, then watch the Director's Cut.",5,Director's Cut Review,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,2771,"['am', 'little', 'torn', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Director', 'Cut', 'differences', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'presentation', 'are', 'subtle', 'differences', 'character', 'are', 'grand.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'think', 'so', 'much', 'imagination', 'impact', 'film', 'felt', 'greater', 'San', 'Diego', 'Comic', 'Con', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'told', 'audience', 'how', 'Director', 'Cut', 'came', 'about', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'never', 'got', 'fair', 'shake', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'probably', 'due', 'film', 'being', 'released', 'soon', '9-11', 'when', 'people', 'quite', 'understandably', 'were', 'not', 'mood', 'see', 'dark', 'movie', 'plane', 'parts', 'falling', 'sky', 'end', 'world.When', 'film', 'did', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'home', 'DVD', 'release', 'studio', 'allowed', 'Kelly', 'add', 'few', 'things', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'order', 'give', 'excuse', 'release', 'movie', 'theatrically', 'again', 'give', 'chance', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'studio', 'part', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'market', 'very', 'well', 'second', 'release', 'Anyway', 'now', 'have', 'new', 'version.I', 'was', 'set', 'off', 'new', 'opening', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'are', 'big', 'spoilers', 'here', 'only', 'difference', 'new', 'opening', 'music', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'said', 'opening', 'was', 'designed', 'go', 'Never', 'Tear', 'Us', 'Apart', 'INXS', 'can', 'see', 'SO', 'WELL', 'Echo', 'Bunnymen', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'Now', 'INXS', 'would', 'finally', 'sell', 'rights', 'new', 'release', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'used', 'still', 'odd', 'though', ""'m"", 'used', 'prefer', 'other', 'song.After', 'initial', 'startling', 'change', 'settled', 'new', 'version', 'movie', 'did', 'enjoy', 'further', 'interaction', 'members', 'Donnie', 'family', 'think', 'added', 'lot', 'film', ""'m"", 'fence', 'additions', 'explanations', 'book', 'time', 'travel', 'think', 'sometimes', 'not', 'knowing', 'details', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'Sometimes', 'audience', 'imagination', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'film', 'maker', 'Not', 'completely', 'understanding', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'one', 'things', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'it.I', ""'d"", 'write', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'film', 'away', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Even', 'are', '90', '%', 'same', 'two', 'films', 'feel', 'very', 'different', 'movies', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'own', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'Director', 'Cut', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Exorcist', 'Legend', 'Brazil', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'maybe', 'few', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'versions', 'have', 'left', 'very', 'distinct', 'feelings', 'different', 'things', 'think', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'think', 'might', 'want', 'start', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'are', 'confused', 'simply', 'want', 'more', 'great', 'movie', 'then', 'watch', 'Director', 'Cut']",Donnie Darko

After seeing it I thought of the film as a sort of &quot;Ordinary People&quot; meets &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; with a touch of &quot;Pi&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot; thrown in. But ultimately that equation is unfair; &quot;Donnie&quot; is, in the end, a true original.The film takes place in 1988. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character: a troubled, sleepwalking teenager who has recurring, frightening visions. Donnie is a quest to understand the forces that are affecting his life and sanity.Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance helps to hold the film together. He is a quirky, offbeat leading man; at times frightening, at times appealingly vulnerable. Gyllenhaal's work is superbly complemented by that of an eclectic ensemble cast which includes Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore, and Noah Wyle. I was particularly impressed by Patrick Swayze's turn as a creepy, oily motivational speaker.&quot;Donnie&quot; defies genre classification. It blends together elements of serious family drama, 80s period piece, horror, satire, and science fiction. In a sense, it is a deconstruction of the whole 80s teen movie genre. The script makes intriguing use of 80s pop culture.&quot;Donnie&quot; has scenes of weirdness and absurdity, and is often punctuated by bizarre dialogue and strange, frightening imagery. And there are some really moving scenes that tap into the universal experience of human loneliness and the need for love. If there was ever a movie that had all the elements to make it a cult classic, it's the haunting &quot;Donnie Darko.&quot;",5,Gyllenhaal is outstanding in this haunting film,1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,1680,"['How', 'describe', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'quot', 'dark', 'psychological', 'drama', 'written', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'seeing', 'thought', 'film', 'sort', 'quot', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'quot', 'meets', 'quot', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'quot', 'touch', 'quot', 'Pi', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'thrown', 'ultimately', 'equation', 'unfair', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'quot', 'end', 'true', 'original.The', 'film', 'place', '1988', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'title', 'character', 'troubled', 'sleepwalking', 'teenager', 'who', 'recurring', 'frightening', 'visions', 'Donnie', 'quest', 'understand', 'forces', 'are', 'affecting', 'life', 'sanity.Gyllenhaal', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'quirky', 'offbeat', 'leading', 'man', 'times', 'frightening', 'times', 'appealingly', 'vulnerable', 'Gyllenhaal', 'work', 'superbly', 'complemented', 'eclectic', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Katharine', 'Ross', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'turn', 'creepy', 'oily', 'motivational', 'speaker.', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'quot', 'defies', 'genre', 'classification', 'together', 'elements', 'serious', 'family', 'drama', '80s', 'period', 'piece', 'horror', 'satire', 'science', 'fiction', 'sense', 'deconstruction', 'whole', '80s', 'teen', 'movie', 'genre', 'script', 'intriguing', 'use', '80s', 'pop', 'culture.', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'quot', 'scenes', 'weirdness', 'absurdity', 'often', 'punctuated', 'bizarre', 'dialogue', 'strange', 'frightening', 'imagery', 'are', 'really', 'moving', 'scenes', 'tap', 'universal', 'experience', 'human', 'loneliness', 'need', 'love', 'was', 'ever', 'movie', 'had', 'elements', 'make', 'cult', 'classic', 'haunting', 'quot', 'Donnie', 'Darko.', 'quot']",Donnie Darko
687229,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005V3Z4,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[5, 5]","Donnie Darko is one of those movies you've always heard about but never saw.  Here's why:Donnie Darko is about a young man in high school who sleepwalks at night, just in time to avoid a jet engine smashing through his bedroom.Right around September 11, 2001.So Donnie Darko, like the titular character of the same name, disappeared with nary a trace.  Fortunately, we now have a DVD version and there will be a new theatrical re-release of a director's cut of the film in July, 2004. Perhaps Donnie will still get his day.Donnie Darko is about the Darko family.  They're an average family, with an older sister heading for college (Elizabeth, played by Jake's real life sister Maggie), a cute-as-a-button younger sister (Samantha, played by Daveigh Chase), a white-collar mom and dad (Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne), and then there's Donnie.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie as an alternately awkward, exhausted, strung out teenager who exhibits brief flashes of rage at the inanity of modern life.  Donnie also suffers from a troubled past, a past that requires him to see a therapist and take medication.Donnie's life is a textbook troubled soul on the road to nowhere.  We could easily see him committing suicide, getting involved in drugs, getting some girl pregnant, maybe joining a gang, or even shooting up his school.  All's the pity, because Donnie is also extremely bright and has a piercing wit that embarrasses adults.All that changes when Frank shows up.  Who's Frank, you ask?  Why, Frank's a deranged bunny rabbit.That's a simplification, of course.  To be precise, Frank is a deranged being in a bunny rabbit suit.  The distinction matters.In fact, in Donnie Darko, EVERYTHING matters.  Every word, every nuance, like an Edgar Allen Poe poem, has significance and meaning.  Ironically, the director and writer, Richard Kelly, feels the movie has only one interpretation as a science fiction story.  In spite of himself, Kelly has created a movie that alternately weeps at the desperate loneliness of so many humans living next to each other and exults in the sheer joy of existence.Frank whispers suggestions to Donnie, things that, at least on the surface, seem like very bad things to do.  Donnie, in his sleepwalking, always performs these acts of vandalism.  And each time, Frank tells Donnie how much he has left before the world ends.  He starts the film with 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Screen shots remind us that the end of the world is coming in a manner similar to The Ring (which came out in 2002, one year after Donnie Darko).Reality lurks in the background.  No one can explain where the jet engine came from.  Government agents shadow Donnie's every step.  In the mean time, town life goes on: Samantha's dance group gets discovered by an agent, a self-help guru (played by Patrick Swayze) spreads his mind-numbing spiritual pap, a book gets banned by the conservative elements for fear that it influences students to commit vandalism, bullies make fun of kids, teenagers do drugs and fool around...in other words, it's a microcosm of Everytown, USA.All around him, Donnie's life slowly falls apart even as it starts to make sense.  Each person in his life is challenged by their mediocrity and must face whether to rise above or succumb to their fears.  The movie emphasizes the madness of putting &quot;Fear&quot; and &quot;Love as diametrically opposed elements, emphasizing that the world is never that simple and often involves a mixture of the two.  It also struggles with the issue of God's existence, of personal choice vs. destiny, of life and death, of madness vs. sanity, and more.Drew Barrymore stars as an English teacher who attempts to open the student's minds. She's also executive producer.  Unfortunately, her character comes off as stilted and unbelievable.  Noah Wyle makes an appearance that's appropriately low key.Kelly's camerawork is exceptionally mature for a new director.  He doesn't shy away from wide-angle scenes and takes on some breathtaking shots; the most memorable being one sweeping panoramic scene that manages to encompass all that is high school in the span of a few seconds.At least as integral to the film is the 80s music that permeates it.  This movie is a love letter to the misbegotten youth of year 2000 twenty-somethings.  The music is always appropriate and conveys the slow tumble of Donnie's life very effectively.  The song &quot;Mad World&quot; sums up the essence of the film and its fundamental disagreement with what passes for our own mundane reality.Donnie Darko has a lot in common with movies like Groundhog Day and Fight Club. The themes of personal choice, of growing beyond one's own selfish nature, of facing down one's demons in a universe that doesn't exist make for though-provoking cinema in the tradition of the silver screen. We don't get many films like this anymore.As the movie comes to a close, Donnie must make a choice. It's not the choice that really matters, but that he was comfortable with his decision in the end.  Viewers who stick with the movie and pay close attention will not be disappointed.Besides, Frank told you to see it.",5,We don't get many films like this anymore.,1087862400,"06 22,

687230,ARTST8JB04TBC,B00005V3Z4,Michael Kear,"[11, 13]","Donnie Darko is an allegory. Not only that, but it is one of the finest movies ever made. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance in the title role. His body language - the curving shoulders, freaky smiles and brooding eyes - reveals an instinctual knowing without the benefit of a complete revelation. His acting is truly outstanding. I'm not saying that anyone else's acting is particularly great or that the special effects are the bomb (they are quite good for a low budget film). What I am saying is that this movie is a multi-dimensional rollercoaster ride that you don't even realize that you are on until it's too late to get off. The closest thing I can relate it to is Twelve Monkeys. But Donnie Darko goes farther and deeper and asks more questions. It is haunting and humorous and even a little scary. If you are a person given to flights of philosophical fancy or theological speculation, (or even if you like reading Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku), you will love this movie. But be prepared! You will have to watch the movie over and over again, and each time you do the allegory becomes fuller and fuller as the revelation opens.Now, my interpretation of the allegory may not be anyone else's. I would be quite interested in hearing other points of view. But here is my idea in a nutshell...The wrinkle in time is this present worldDonnie Darko is the Christ figure (hence, his mother = Mary; father = Joseph)Jim Cunnigham is the devil (Or is Frank the devil and Jim the Antichrist?)Gretchen Ross is the ChurchKittie Farmer is Self-righteous churchianity (as opposed to The Two Teachers, below)Roberta Sparrow/Grandma Death is the Bible (by way of her book The Philosophy of Time Travel)The Two Teachers (Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore) represent conscientious but silenced clergy - the prophetic voiceThe wrinkle in time in which the story takes place is the world as we know it. Donnie gives up his life so that his beloved might live, but in the process he changes everyone and everything. Even Jim Cunningham - the evil molester who, because of the death of Donnie may not even be found out - is reduced to tears, perhaps knowing that everything has changed. The world as a whole will never be the same again.Okay, you philosophers and movie wizards... what does the fat man in the jogging suit represent? What about Frank? What is he really? Or the psychiatrist? Or Sparkle Magic? What does Donnie's older sister represent? Frank is her boyfriend! Frank also is the oracle that cause Donnie to act. Lots of stuff I just haven't figured out yet!!!!First time writer/director Richard Kelly has created a real gem here. The film already has a hardy cult following and will become, I think, the theologian's and philosopher's Rocky Horror Picture Show.",5,Donnie Darko Is An Allegory,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,2775,"['Donnie', 'Darko', 'allegory', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'finest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'excellent', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'body', 'language', 'curving', 'shoulders', 'freaky', 'smiles', 'brooding', 'eyes', 'reveals', 'instinctual', 'knowing', 'benefit', 'complete', 'revelation', 'acting', 'truly', 'outstanding', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'anyone', 'else', 'acting', 'particularly', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'bomb', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'What', 'am', 'saying', 'movie', 'multi-dimensional', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'are', 'too', 'late', 'get', 'off', 'closest', 'thing', 'can', 'relate', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'farther', 'deeper', 'more', 'questions', 'haunting', 'humorous', 'even', 'little', 'scary', 'are', 'person', 'given', 'flights', 'philosophical', 'fancy', 'theological', 'speculation', 'even', 'like', 'reading', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'Michio', 'Kaku', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'be', 'prepared', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'time', 'do', 'allegory', 'fuller', 'fuller', 'revelation', 'opens.Now', 'interpretation', 'allegory', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'interested', 'hearing', 'other', 'points', 'view', 'here', 'idea', 'nutshell', 'wrinkle', 'time', 'present', 'worldDonnie', 'Darko', 'Christ', 'figure', 'hence', 'mother', '=', 'Mary', '=', 'Joseph', 'Jim', 'Cunnigham', 'devil', 'Frank', 'devil', 'Jim', 'Antichrist', 'Gretchen', 'Ross', 'ChurchKittie', 'Farmer', 'Self-righteous', 'churchianity', 'opposed', 'Two', 'Teachers', 'Roberta', 'Sparrow/Grandma', 'Death', 'Bible', 'way', 'book', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Two', 'Teachers', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'represent', 'conscientious', 'silenced', 'clergy', 'prophetic', 'voiceThe', 'wrinkle', 'time', 'story', 'place', 'world', 'know', 'Donnie', 'up', 'life', 'beloved', 'might', 'live', 'process', 'everyone', 'everything', 'Even', 'Jim', 'Cunningham', 'evil', 'molester', 'who', 'death', 'Donnie', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'found', 'reduced', 'tears', 'perhaps', 'knowing', 'everything', 'changed', 'world', 'whole', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again.Okay', 'philosophers', 'movie', 'wizards', 'what', 'fat', 'man', 'jogging', 'suit', 'represent', 'What', 'Frank', 'What', 'really', 'psychiatrist', 'Sparkle', 'Magic', 'What', 'Donnie', 'older', 'sister', 'represent', 'Frank', 'boyfriend', 'Frank', 'also', 'oracle', 'cause', 'Donnie', 'act', 'Lots', 'stuff', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'yet', 'First', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'created', 'real', 'gem', 'here', 'film', 'already', 'hardy', 'cult', 'following', 'will', 'become', 'think', 'theologian', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show']",Donnie Darko
687231,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00005V3Z4,Michael R Gates,"[2, 3]","Donnie Darko is an intelligent but somewhat befuddled teenager who lives with his idyllic family in an upscale American suburban neighborhood, attends an exclusive private school...and has nighttime visions of a huge, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank who gives him information about the future.  Sometimes the nightmarish nocturnal hare puts Donnie into a sleep-like trance and sends him out to perform an act of vandalism or two, and it is during one of these somnambulistic excursions that a massive jet engine from a commercial airliner falls from the sky and demolishes Donnie's bedroom.  Because it appears that Frank has saved his life, Donnie tends to believe Frank's claim to be from the future feels that he must, for the time being, humor the late-night lagomorph.  In the mean time, amid several bizarre events suddenly taking place in his daytime life, Donnie's research into the scientific possibility of time travel leads him to a life-changing epiphany.The ingredients that freshman writer/director Richard Kelly uses to whip up the plot and narrative for DONNIE DARKO (2001) are the familiar materials of everyday life, but he throws in a pinch or two of the bizarre and the absurd to create a subtly skewed and therefore disturbing atmosphere.  The characters are fresh but true-to-life and never formulaic, yet in many of them Kelly still manages to find springboards for satirical comments on diverse societal elements like the American school system, infomercials, spin doctors &amp; public images, the entertainment industry, the popular perception of science, and more.  All of this coalesces into a fascinating and compelling examination of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.The film's entire cast is quite strong and handles the deep material with the appropriate degree of earnestness.  Star Jake Gyllenhaal is especially outstanding in the title role.  His Donnie Darko, though emotionally imbalanced, is both an intriguing and sympathetic character, one that engages the absurdities in life--particularly HIS life--with saturnine curiosity rather than fear, and he therefore establishes a perfect tone for the film. Of the supporting cast, Mary McDonnell gives a standout performance as Donnie's mother Rose Darko, as she emotes a genuine concern over the seeming psychological downslide of her son.  The cute and talented Jena Malone also does a wonderful job as Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen, a young woman who is nearly as perplexed and yet intrigued by life's absurdities as Donnie himself.  In a refreshing departure from the usual hunk and heartthrob roles in which he is usually cast, Patrick Swayze delivers a darkly humorous interpretation of a smarmy self-help guru, and the beautiful Drew Barrymore--also one of the film's executive producers--offers a convincing yet low-key portrayal of an unconventional but popular high-school English teacher.The DVD from Fox offers a very good (some filmic artifacts) digital transfer of DONNIE DARKO in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The wonderful bonus features include two feature commentaries--one with writer/director Kelly and star Gyllenhaal, the other with various members of the cast and crew--a widescreen video of the film's haunting featured pop song MAD WORLD, deleted scenes, and other cool stuff.  Definitely worth the price of admission, and a disc that fans of more cerebral SF will want in their collections.",5,The Future Is Looking Kinda Darko,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,3463,"['Donnie', 'Darko', 'intelligent', 'somewhat', 'befuddled', 'teenager', 'who', 'idyllic', 'family', 'upscale', 'American', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'exclusive', 'private', 'school', 'nighttime', 'visions', 'huge', 'demonic-looking', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Frank', 'who', 'information', 'future', 'Sometimes', 'nightmarish', 'nocturnal', 'hare', 'Donnie', 'sleep-like', 'trance', 'out', 'perform', 'act', 'vandalism', 'two', 'one', 'somnambulistic', 'excursions', 'massive', 'jet', 'engine', 'commercial', 'airliner', 'sky', 'Donnie', 'bedroom', 'Frank', 'saved', 'life', 'Donnie', 'believe', 'Frank', 'claim', 'be', 'future', 'must', 'time', 'being', 'late-night', 'lagomorph', 'mean', 'time', 'several', 'bizarre', 'events', 'suddenly', 'taking', 'place', 'daytime', 'life', 'Donnie', 'research', 'scientific', 'possibility', 'time', 'travel', 'life-changing', 'epiphany.The', 'ingredients', 'freshman', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'whip', 'up', 'plot', 'narrative', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', '2001', 'are', 'familiar', 'materials', 'everyday', 'life', 'pinch', 'two', 'bizarre', 'absurd', 'create', 'subtly', 'skewed', 'therefore', 'disturbing', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'are', 'fresh', 'true-to-life', 'never', 'formulaic', 'yet', 'many', 'Kelly', 'still', 'find', 'springboards', 'satirical', 'comments', 'diverse', 'societal', 'elements', 'American', 'school', 'system', 'infomercials', 'spin', 'doctors', 'amp', 'public', 'images', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'popular', 'perception', 'science', 'more', 'coalesces', 'fascinating', 'compelling', 'examination', 'consciousness', 'perception', 'nature', 'reality.The', 'film', 'entire', 'cast', 'quite', 'strong', 'deep', 'material', 'appropriate', 'degree', 'earnestness', 'Star', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'especially', 'outstanding', 'title', 'role', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'emotionally', 'imbalanced', 'intriguing', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'one', 'absurdities', 'life', 'particularly', 'HIS', 'life', 'saturnine', 'curiosity', 'rather', 'fear', 'therefore', 'perfect', 'tone', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'standout', 'performance', 'Donnie', 'mother', 'Rose', 'Darko', 'genuine', 'concern', 'seeming', 'psychological', 'downslide', 'son', 'cute', 'talented', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'also', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Donnie', 'girlfriend', 'Gretchen', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'nearly', 'perplexed', 'yet', 'intrigued', 'life', 'absurdities', 'Donnie', 'refreshing', 'departure', 'usual', 'hunk', 'heartthrob', 'roles', 'usually', 'cast', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'interpretation', 'smarmy', 'self-help', 'guru', 'beautiful', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'executive', 'producers', 'convincing', 'yet', 'low-key', 'portrayal', 'unconventional', 'popular', 'high-school', 'English', 'teacher.The', 'DVD', 'Fox', 'very', 'good', 'filmic', 'artifacts', 'digital', 'transfer', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'film', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'wonderful', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'two', 'feature', 'commentaries', 'one', 'writer/director', 'Kelly', 'star', 'Gyllenhaal', 'other', 'various', 'members', 'cast', 'crew', 'widescreen', 'video', 'film', 'haunting', 'featured', 'pop', 'song', 'MAD', 'WORLD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'cool', 'stuff', 'Definitely', 'price', 'admission', 'disc', 'fans', 'more', 'cerebral', 'SF', 'will', 'want', 'collections']",Donnie Darko
687232,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00005V3Z4,Mike Stone,"[23, 34]","I've watched ""Donnie Darko"" three times now in the last five days, and still can't say definitively if I like it.  I appreciate the heck out it, am impressed by the imagination and creativity of the filmmakers, and admire the fact that what they put on screen belies their $4 million budget.  Most of all, I enjoy the heightened sense of awareness I get every time it finishes.  It's a feeling that lets me know, without question, that I've been affected by what I just saw.  But when I think about the film rationally, as opposed to emotionally, it crumbles under the weight of its own conceit.Set in October of 1988, the story follows young Donnie Darko, a seemingly unbalanced teenager who is prone to sleepwalking.  On one such night journey he meets a new friend, a 6-foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.  Upon returning home the next morning, he finds that an unaccounted-for airplane engine has crash-landed on his house, crushing the room where he should have been asleep in bed.  It's the kind of setup that keeps the audience on its toes for the rest of the film.  Where did the engine come from?  Who is Frank?  What do the fates, which obviously want him alive, have in store for Donnie Darko?The problem is that writer/director Richard Kelly has some ideas for answers to these questions, but he either: 1) Didn't have the budget to realize them; 2) Didn't want to give them away too early; or 3) Didn't want to give them away at all, preferring for the audience to fill in the gaps on their own.  I don't have a problem when most filmmakers choose path #3.  The audience should act as a participant in determining the meaning of the film.  But they can't do it alone, in a vacuum.  Kelly provides clues all along, but they are so hidden and so obscure, that even the most discerning viewer probably wouldn't be able to find them on first (or second, or third pass).  It becomes even more frustrating when the ending, supposedly constructed to tie up all loose ends (or at least all loose ends that the writer has bothered tying up), bends and breaks the audience's ability to suspend disbelief.  There's one final thread that I still can't logically rationalize, even though I know what was supposed to happen.Donnie rails against ignore-the-grey-area thinking, claiming that life is more complex than that.  I wish Kelly would have heeded his own advice, for he does a lousy job presenting complex characters.  Most everyone here is either good or evil, black or white.  He loves the beatific Darko family, the progressive young teachers at school, and Gretchen (Jena Malone), Donnie's new girlfriend.  He hates, and is unsympathetic to, Kitty, the little girl dance troupe that she exploits for her own ego, and the infomercial pitchman whose theories she buys into wholeheartedly.  No scene holds a more pointed example of Kelly's inability to hide his hand, than an emergency PTA meeting.  Called because someone has flooded the school and put an axe in the head of its mascot, it is inevitably interrupted by Kitty, who has discovered that an English teacher (Drew Barrymore) is teaching Graham Greene's short story ""The Destructors"".  ""Do you even know who Graham Green is?"" asks a concerned mother.  ""I think we've all seen 'Bonanza',"" comes the arrogant yet ignorant reply.  Kelly didn't even have enough confidence in his good guys -- and by association, their quest -- to give them credible bad guys to rail against.  Instead he offers villains whose actions are one step above twirling their moustaches menacingly and tying damsels in distress to railroad tracks.In Kelly's defense, ""Donnie Darko"" was his first film.  And to his credit, there is a lot here that is either very accomplished or shows potential.  I did say that every time I watch the film it affects me in a poignant way, and now I'll tell you why.First of all, it looks great.  Kelly and crew, low budget or no low budget, have made a film that you can stand alongside any big budget blockbuster of the day, and it wouldn't look out of place.  They even manage a skillful recreation of the living water effect first seen in James Cameron's ""The Abyss"".  His camera work is ambitious or simple when necessary.  In a film called ""Donnie Darko"", one would expect that light (or the lack thereof) would be an important player.  Kelly and cinematographer Stephen B. Poster use clean suburban sunshine in the daytime, and extreme darkness at night.  The latter is often punctuated by blinding flashes of light, most notably the brilliant beam that presciently spews from Frank's left eye.Kelly does fine detailed work making sure the authenticity of the time period is maintained.  From the clothes, to the conversations, to, most importantly, the music, everything fits the era to a T.  He manages to get fine use out of not one but two Tears for Fears songs: ""Head Over Heels"" adds power to an effective tracking shot showing the treacherous ecosystem that is Donnie's school; a cover of ""Mad World"" adds melancholy, without adding melodrama, to the affective denouement (like I said, emotionally the film works, but it can't stand up to reason).Overall, I'll give Richard Kelly the benefit of the doubt, and deign to recommend his film.  Like I said, it offered me enough of a visceral rush that I've seen it multiple times, and look forward to seeing many times more.  For all potential audience members, remember this: ""Donnie Darko"" will not make much sense, at least until you've done some further research into the hidden meanings of the film.  Appreciate it as an emotional experience first, and its pleasures will fulfill you.I guess I liked it after all.",4,"Everyone Dies Alone; ""Donnie"" Makes the Interim Bearable",1030924800,"09 2,

I have no idea why. Creating a confusing mess and explaining nothing about itself is not a Mindblow. DD shows demonic posession, talks about the possibility of time travel, and this is sll supposedly leading up to the prevention of doomsday. No attempt is made to explain how doomsday is prevented using a single jet engine. Nor why the incident with said jet engine repeats itself. Or why Donnie's letter to the old woman makes no damned sense at all. The list goes on and on with all the unexplained *wtf?!* moments in this film.Of course, there are those that argue that Donnie Darko has no plot holes. The theories offered by internet folk to explain DD speak of superpowers, ""tangent"" universes, ""the manipulated dead"", etc. They make sense when you read them. These theories are worth checking out, because there is probably no way your brain will jump to such farfeched conclusions, based on the little-or-no info the film gives you in its supernatural aspects. Here's my theory: DD is a badly made movie that could have been compelling if it wasn't so lazy. Surely the taseless, pointless discussion about how smurfs relieve their sexual urges, could have been lopped to make room for explainations. Same with the sex-obsessed hypnotherapy session. why are scenes like these allowed to exist when they do nothing but juxtapose the movie's cerebral/mysterious tones?I don't necessarily need the solution to the puzzle spoon-fed to me.

687235,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005V3Z4,mirasreviews,"[2, 5]","Richard Kelly's quirky ""Donnie Darko"" was an audience-pleaser at Sundance then a bomb at the box office in 2001 before becoming a cult hit on DVD. It isn't clear what kind of film it's trying to be, which is part of the problem and part of the attraction. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high school student whose life is disrupted by sleepwalking and hallucinations of someone named Frank wearing a grotesque bunny suit. On October 2, 1988, the bunny tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 6 seconds. That would be on Halloween. It's assumed that Donnie is mentally ill. He doesn't know himself. Between the bunny's commands and other bizarre incidents, Donnie begins to think it all has something to do with time travel, which will come to an abrupt end on October 31.Donnie is a thoughtful young man with a problem of unclear dimensions. He's trying his best to figure it all out, so the audience roots for him. Richard Kelly places ""Donnie Darko"" in the science fiction genre. But it's also satire, family dramedy, teen romance, and a period film of the 1980s. This works, because different themes are compartmentalized, and when they intersect, they do so naturally. The satire involving a gym teacher (Beth Grant) who idolizes a puritanical motivational speaker (Patrick Swayze) is over-the-top. The family dynamic is sincere and good-natured. Mary McDonnell is particularly touching as Donnie's mother, who feels her son's pain and reacts with respect and kindness. But there is a nagging feeling that things in Middlesex, Virginia are somehow out of whack.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2003): On the standard disc, NOT the director's cut, the bonus features are a theatrical trailer and 5 TV spots, selected filmographies of 11 cast and 9 crew members, 20 deleted or extended scenes with optional commentary, ""Mad World"" music video performed by Gary Jules (3 min), a web site gallery that features documents that fill out the past and future of some characters, liner notes for the soundtrack, ""Cunning Visions"" infomercials (6 min) with optional commentary by the company's fictional CEO and director, Cunningham's full ""His Name is Frank"" presentation, Cunningham's book covers, an Art Gallery with nearly 50 production stills and 27 pieces of concept art from the film, and 12 pages of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" by Roberta Sparrow.There are also 2 audio commentaries. The first is by writer/director Richard Kelly and actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This includes their recollections of filming, discussion of themes and characters, Gyllenhaal's thoughts about Donnie, discussion of the film's mysteries, and what the director hoped to reveal as the film progressed. The second audio commentary is by 8 (I think) members of the cast and Richard Kelly. They are a friendly bunch, conversing with the director and each other about the film, commenting on the scenes. Kelly does offer some different ideas in this commentary than in the first, so it's not a repeat. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.

This is not really a summary, so yeah, sorry.I don't know if I can say which is better, it's really up to personal preference. The director's cut is different in the sense that it adds in some scenes, slightly alters others, and changes/rearranges some of the music and scoring.The theatrical cut is much more poetic. A lot of people say that it is better because it leaves so much interpretation as to what all happens to the viewer.The Director's Cut helps explain more of what happens, and the supernatural aspect of it, and leaves less interpretation. It tends to put a lot of focus on the sci/fi side of it.Most people tend to like the version better that they saw first. I would recommend the Theatrical Version, but really either is better. For any Donnie Darko fan, I'd say to have both. I really like the commentary on the Director's Cut, it helps get an insight into all the thoughts that went into the movies, the changes made in the director's cut, and the music.

I was told &quot;It's weird&quot; and even &quot;It's stupid&quot; but such 2 word reviews don't really tell me anything.Anyway, here goes:We start out with our anti-Hero, Donnie Darko, who is leading a bizarre night life. Every morning, he wakes up far away from his bed in his pajamas.  He also sees things.  Things like giant rabbits. Oh, and air planes fall on his house.  Also, time travel.Yes. Weird.  Many little things set this apart from other movies. From it's wonderful characterization (Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance), to it's slow yet not-boring pace.  I left the theatre wondering what I just experienced.

687241,A2ZA3LSJZD9UO0,B00005V3Z4,Mr G Bowden,"[10, 12]","Richard Kelly's remarkably assured directorial debut, ""Donnie Darko"", could be earmarked as the teen movie version of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" with a surreal sci-fi edge. Unfortunately, despite having the likes of Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Katharine Ross, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze in a to-die-for ensemble cast and probably the best poster of 2001 (not to mention a seriously deranged web-site), it fell by the wayside at the box office. Many blame its sort-of unintentional mirroring of September 11 for its lack of drawing power; others claim a misleading ad campaign was to blame (ignore the ""classic psychological thriller"" plaudit on the DVD sleeve); many found its similarities to Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"" and the aforementioned ""Magnolia"" too much to stand. However, there is still a lot of enjoyment to be had with watching ""Donnie"", thanks in large part to an admirably tender tone often missing in today's movies.Kelly's script, unfortunately, does bear quite a few likenesses to Paul Thomas Anderson's three-hour opus, not least in Donnie and his psychologist, Dr. Thurman's, discussions about God, an unerringly supernatural ring to all of the preceedings and Swayze's role as a motivational speaker with some rather humiliating dark secrets (and, unfortunately, Swayze doesn't match Tom Cruise's Frank TJ Mackey for audience enrapturement). That said, ""Donnie"" trades in some David Lynch-style moments to keep the audience happy, not least in Donnie's eerie messanger, Frank, the six-foot-tall bunny rabbit. And Kelly's direction is a lot less harsh on his protagonists than Anderson's was, giving the film a more involving emotional centre than Anderson's polarising epic.Though it doesn't match ""Magnolia's"" scale budget-wise, Kelly belies the film's average budget ($5 million) much like Darren Aronofsky did with ""Requiem For A Dream"". The film is effortlessly secured in the '80s with a very decent pop soundtrack (though lack of money prevented the filmmakers from releasing a 'various artists' soundtrack) and is very well shot by director of photography Steven Poster (particularly highlighted in Donnie's scenes with Frank in his bathroom). Kelly also manages to worm in some decent digital effects, from the ""Abyss""-style 'time spears' to the apocalyptic sky effects.And, having gained a hell of a cast for his first feature, Kelly duly delivers on the acting front also, particularly in his lead Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal epitomises the film's sweet, moral centre as well as the thick paranoia set throughout, and emerges alongside ""Ghost World's"" Thora Birch's Enid as 2001's most beguiling teen hero. He is ably supported by the rest of the ensemble, particularly Beth Grant as gym teacher Kitty Farmer, Jena Malone as his girlfriend Gretchen and, especially, Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne as his worried parents. The character Cherita Chen, however, stole my heart shamelessly.A lot's been made about ""Donnie's"" juggling of genres, switching quite quickly from domestic drama to black comedy to teen romance to apocalyptic sci-fi in leaps and bounds. There is no denying, though, that Kelly is a talent to watch in the future, considering the remarkable debut he's made here. The DVD, meanwhile, is crammed full of supplemental material, including two audio commentaries (one of which done by the producers and near enough the whole cast) and extensive deleted scenes featuring more substantial acting work, particularly from Drew Barrymore and Holmes Osborne.

687242,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005V3Z4,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[27, 32]","Donnie Darko is a very difficult movie to characterise and assign to one or even two genres, which is also part of its appeal and fascination. It opens with the title character (Jake Gyllenhall) waking in his pyjamas, with his bike lying next to him, on a highway overlooking his hometown of Middlesex, set in an idyllic tree covered valley. Straightening up he looks out toward the rising sun on the horizon and with a knowing smile he re-mounts his bicycle and makes his way back home to the tune of Echo and The Bunnymen&#65533;s &#65533;The Killing Moon&#65533; in what is an excellent opening sequence. Right from these first few frames it was obvious that I was about to witness something very original and it had me hooked.Donnie Darko is inspired (I would guess) by the weird combination of Philip K Dick, Wes Anderson, JD Salinger and the classic James Stewart movie &#65533;Harvey&#65533;. It announces the arrival of two great new talents in Writer/Director Richard Kelly and the young actor Jake Gyllenhall, in what is a hugely original, ingenious and entertaining movie. Set in 1988, around Halloween time, this movie has the conventional leafy-suburbia-plus-high-school setting, which alludes to the horror genre of Carrie and Halloween but it is no horror movie.  It also has specific elements that suggest that it&#65533;s a psychodrama about a young man with schizophrenia but this is not &#65533;A Beautiful Mind&#65533;. It also ponders the possibility of time travel but this is not science fiction. Stranger still, Donnie Darko is unusual in that (unlike most retro 1980&#65533;s pictures such as The Wedding Singer) it actually has a very cool soundtrack drawn from the period of my youth, which includes contributions from the likes of Echo and The Bunnymen, Tears For Fears and Joy Division.So, what is Donnie Darko about?  Well, without giving up too much of the plot, Donnie is continuously visited by a 6 foot tall rabbit named Frank, which unlike the Pooka in the classic &#65533;Harvey&#65533; is both visible to the audience and strangely satanic. Frank tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days six hours and forty two minutes but not to worry as everything is going to be all right. Guided by Frank he narrowly misses being killed when an engine from a 747 crashes through his house whilst he is lying sleeping on a local golf course and the plot thickens when it becomes apparent that the aviation authority has no record of any aircraft losing an engine. Donnie is of course undergoing therapy with a local shrink and hypnotherapist played by Katherine Ross (The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid) and the suggestion is of course that Donnie is hallucinating, for as his sister says &#65533;he hasn&#65533;t been taking his pills&#65533;. One of Donnie&#65533;s recurring visions suggests that he can see the future before it happens and so he becomes obsessed with the possibility of time travel and a book written by a retired teacher, who is now a scary old recluse, &#65533;The Philosophy of Time Travel&#65533;. There are also many other sub-plots including Donnie being inspired by his English teacher (Drew Barrymore) and Graham Greene&#65533;s short story &#65533;The Destructors&#65533; into some playful vandalism. In addition to this Donnie&#65533;s subversive thoughts and actions begin to undermine the stability of the local community that is strangely gripped by a slimy fundamentalist guru played by Patrick Swayze.Much of this movie is darkly comic and there are some great scenes including a conversation between Donnie and his therapist, where she asks him what he thinks about at school. Like most teenage boys he inevitably replies &#65533;having s*x&#65533; before proceeding to unbutton his trousers about to m*sturbate. There is also a scene where at a PTA meeting Donnie&#65533;s mother challenges the local bigot by asking ""Do you even know who Graham Greene is?"" she confidently and proudly replies ""Oh please! I think we've all seen Bonanza"".Personally I loved this movie but whether or not you enjoy this movie probably depends upon how far left of centre you like your movies. If you are not a fan of independent cinema or movies by the likes of Wes Anderson and David Lynch then you probably wont like this. However there is much to recommend in Donnie Darko, not least the cast, which includes, Noah Wyle (ER), Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Confessions of A Dangerous Mind) and the previously mentioned Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katherine Ross. Jake Gyllenhaal&#65533;s exquisite comic timing and laidback personality endows Donnie's existence with a dreamlike quality at odds with his teen angst and the suburban paranoia of his surroundings. Meanwhile writer/director Richard Kelly creates a wonderful sense of tension and keeps you guessing throughout the movie that even after the final titles have rolled you are still left to mull over what you have just witnessed.Whilst critics may argue that Donnie Darko fails as a psychological study and/or horror movie, you cant help but feel they are missing the point, as it deliberately avoids easy classification to a specific genre and instead concentrates on being intelligent, ingenious and highly original.  Closing appropriately to a cover version of the old Tears For Fears song &#65533;Mad World&#65533; and the lyrics &#65533;the dreams on which I&#65533;m dying are the best I&#65533;ve ever had&#65533;, neatly ties up the previous two hours and what was for me a very satisfactory cinematic experience. Destined for cult status this undoubtedly deserves five stars!",5,I Think We&iquest;ve All Seen Bonanza!!! *****,1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,5651,"['Donnie', 'Darko', 'very', 'difficult', 'movie',

It seems to have impressed a large number of viewers (and critics), so perhaps I'm just missing something.  I do like films that require me to think, but unfortunately the thought required to enjoy this film didn't feel rewarding in the end.  Other reviewers here have referred to this film as a puzzle.  That's the way it seemed to me, too; unfortunately after the puzzle is put together (and I believe that there is more than one way to interpret this film), one is left with a feeling of ""so what?""  There isn't anything profound about this film; it doesn't shed any new light on ""the human condition"" as far as I can tell.  Perhaps this film appeals most to people who enjoy puzzles purely for the mental exercise.  I would like a little emotional payoff/insight in the end.I read the most recent 50 or so reviews and did not see anyone comment on the age of the cast.  I must say that I was distracted by the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as an alleged high school student.  Yes, he was only 20-21 when this was filmed, but he definitely looked to be in his twenties and not an adolescent.  Some of the other actors also looked too old to be playing their parts.  Jena Malone, on the other hand, whose looks match her age  (four years younger than Jake Gyllenhaal) only served to call attention to the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal looked more like a man and less like a teenager.  I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was good (though I haven't seen him in anything else and some people are criticizing him by saying he essential comes across the same in every film), but he just wasn't believable as a high school student.  The casting wasn't as bad as, say, the film version of ""The Wiz"" (where a forties-ish Diana Ross tried to pretend to be a young teen), but I was definitely distracted by some of the choices made.",3,What's all the fuss about this film?,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,1954,"['honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'film', 'received', 'amount', 'attention', 'liked', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'great', 'have', 'impressed', 'large', 'number', 'viewers', 'critics', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'just', 'missing', 'something', 'do', 'films', 'require', 'think', 'unfortunately', 'thought', 'required', 'enjoy', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rewarding', 'end', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'referred', 'film', 'puzzle', 'way', 'seemed', 'too', 'unfortunately', 'puzzle', 'put', 'together', 'believe', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'interpret', 'film', 'one', 'left', 'feeling', 'what', ""n't"", 'anything', 'profound', 'film', ""n't"", 'shed', 'new', 'light', 'human', 'condition', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'appeals', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'puzzles', 'purely', 'mental', 'exercise', 'would', 'like', 'little', 'emotional', 'payoff/insight', 'end.I', 'read', 'most', 'recent', '50', 'so', 'reviews', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'anyone', 'comment', 'age', 'cast', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'distracted', 'casting', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'alleged', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Yes', 'was', 'only', '20-21', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'definitely', 'looked', 'be', 'twenties', 'not', 'adolescent', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'looked', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'parts', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'other', 'hand', 'looks', 'match', 'age', 'four', 'years', 'younger', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'only', 'served', 'call', 'attention', 'fact', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'looked', 'more', 'man', 'less', 'teenager', 'thought', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'people', 'are', 'criticizing', 'saying', 'essential', 'same', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'casting', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'say', 'film', 'version', 'Wiz', 'where', 'forties-ish', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'tried', 'pretend', 'be', 'young', 'teen', 'was', 'definitely', 'distracted', 'choices', 'made']",Donnie Darko
687245,A1HALUZL6JHO3Y,B00005V3Z4,M. W. Zeininger,"[9, 14]","Let me start by saying that I've been aching to see this brilliant film since last fall, but instead had to wait till video.  And boy, oh boy, was it worth the wait!  Richard Kelly presents something stunning here.  At times mordantly funny, shrewdly satiric, eerie, tragic, but always fascinating, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an inspiration for people like me looking for something that will come as a revelation.  Jake Gyllenhaal does tricky, effective work here, and carries the film strongly.  Mary McDonnell is first-rate, and the rest of the supporting cast know exactly what Kelly wants from them.  Touching, funny, surprising and entertaining, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; will remain one of my favorite films of all time.

In 1988, young Donnie is a borderline schizo who sees a grotesque man size reptilian/rabbit which he follows and obeys.  One night when Donnie goes off sleepwalking, the rabbit (who is called Frank) tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.  The next morning as Donnie stumbles home, we see his home has been decimated by a jet plane engine.  It is here where Donnie begins to wonder if all this really is all in his head, or if he isn't crazy and is meant for something more.  As the film rolls along he meets and falls in love with the new girl (Jena Malone), and becomes obsessed with the theories of time travel.  Patrick Swayze is here as a self help guru who may or may not be who he says he is, and nearly steals the show with his great performance.  Mary McDonnel is great as well as Donnie's mother, and Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (she also was an executive producer of the film) play husband and wife teachers.  Writer/director Richard Kelly has crafted an unbelieveably moving film that scares, shocks, and plays with the mind of the viewer while having a sense of dark humor to it all.

687253,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005V3Z4,Nicholas Carroll,"[2, 5]","I saw the Director's Version in theaters last year, after reading an article in the paper that the original theatrical film became a ""cult hit"" on dvd after disappearing in theaters in 2001.  I had never heard of the film before (all I remember was a film called ""Donnie Brasco"" with Johnny Depp and had no interest in seeing that one), which is a shame because this film had the poor sense of timing (no fault of Director Richard Kelly) to be released in the month following the 9/11 tragedy, even though it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival many months earlier.  Had it opened in July or August of 2001, it might have become an even bigger financial success, which it certainly deserves.When I watched the original theatrical version before seeing the Director's version, I didn't know what to make of this film.  Its a strange film that doesn't follow any linear pattern or conventional storyline, but it grabs your attention nonetheless with the awesome visuals, superb acting by a first rate cast, and has many funny moments punctuated by memorable, quotable lines.  This film, more than most I've seen, leaves a lasting impression after a first viewing.  While many films are instantly forgettable, this one stands above others with its unique vision and overall message.What I love about this version over the original one are the inclusion of previously deleted scenes that should never have been deleted in the first place (and it was the studio obsessed with keeping the running time under two hours that demanded cuts).  The added scenes fill in some of the holes of the story, in particular, the scene where the father gives Donnie some good advice about being true to himself in spite of what others might think.  Its a funny moment, and a memorable one between father and son.  I also loved the scene where Drew Barrymore tells Donnie that maybe he and the Bunny can read ""Watership Down"" together.  That's a funny line that should never have been cut from the theatrical release.What makes this film most memorable for me, where the director more than earned his right to direct future films, is the awesome scene when Tears for Fears ""Head Over Heels"" plays and we see a shortened, film-within-a-film, as all the elements of the overall film flow quite well with the music.  Its far better than most music videos I've seen and if they ever gave an Academy Award for best scene in a motion picture, that scene deserves the Oscar.  I also love the haunting melody and images of people grieving when ""Mad World"" plays.  An appropriately brilliant song, as are most song selections for this film.  The Sparkle Motion dance sequence was another memorable scene in the film particularly the way Drew Barrymore moves her eyes and head to the rhythms of Duran Duran's ""Notorious"", while still maintaining the blank stare of complete boredom.  Its hard to pull of something like that, but Drew does it perfectly.  Another brilliantly shot scene is when Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone walk down the stairs in perfect synchronicity with each other.  The only change I didn't like from the original is that I thought ""Under the Milky Way"" fit much better with that sequence and the house party scene than the Echo and the Bunnymen song...but that's the only change I didn't like.All in all, this film must be seen to be believed, and its complex enough to keep you wanting to watch it over and over, but also engagin enough to pull you into its mystery on first viewing.  This film could be a metaphor for many things and is worthy of a film discussion group.  The images of many scenes are beautifully crafted, well acted, and perfectly touched with the right music.  Director Richard Kelly has every reason to be proud of this notable achievement.  I can't wait to see what he will do with his next film, whenever that comes out.One of the special features has a documentary by the supposed #1 Donnie Darko fan, which I found to be quite disturbing, especially at the very end.  That Director Richard Kelly would allow such a documentary to be included on his director's version dvd says a lot about him as a person (a nice guy, in other words).  Fans who are wanting him to write a complete book on time travel to fill out this Donnie Darko project are asking too much.  Let the director move on to other projects, bringing his unique vision to the screen.

It plays like an 80's version of American Beauty. And while it's nicely ironic, well written and cleverly engineered - too cleverly engineered, really - I think it lets itself down badly in execution. An awful lot of signposts the movie needs to make it understandable are down, unclear, or just flat out missing.As a result the film is largely incoherent. Many of the positive reviews praise it for a dark post modernism which I really don't think was intended. There's a fine line between post modernism and incoherence, of course.A case in point: the episode where a jet engine falls out of the sky but which no-one reports as missing. Rather than being a wry satire of corporate responsibility and American victim culture, this is actually intended as plain old daft science fiction: it isn't reported as missing, because it has fallen through a wormhole in the space-time continuum from another universe. You don't discover this until much later in the film. But at least you do find out eventually: there are several aspects which are key to understanding what is going on that you can only discover by watching the director's commentary and having the incidents pointed out:While I was busy soaking up Will Sergeant's jangling guitars in the chorus of the Killing Moon, Frank appears briefly in the first scene of the film, driving past the camera in a red Mustang, having dropped Donnie's sister off after a date. He is also mentioned briefly as having died thirty years ago driving to Donnie's father's school prom. These are important to the exposition (and understanding whether Frank is real, an apparition, or a figment of Donnie's deranged mind) but without the director's commentary you would (on a first viewing) be none the wiser. Similarly underemphasised is the fact that, as Donnie leaves the house on the night of the jet engine incident, he moves into a parallel universe. There is nothing at all in the script that, as far as I could see, gave any hint of that. Nor of the fact that Donnie's pills are only a placebo. The film toys with the question of whether or not Donnie is schizophrenic, but never answers it.In general, Donnie Darko asks a lot more questions than it answers, and by the end of the show I was kicking around a further question: ""what on earth was that all about?""Which I don't think is a good thing.",3,Too incoherent to be genuinely great,1065398400,"10 6, 2003",2003,2576,"['Echo', 'amp', 'Bunnymen', 'single', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Joy', 'Division', 'epochal', 'Love', 'Will', 'Tear', 'Us', 'Apart', 'last', 'ten', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'sort', 'film', 'have', 'natural', 'weakness', '80', 'version', 'American', 'Beauty', 'nicely', 'ironic', 'well', 'written', 'cleverly', 'engineered', 'too', 'cleverly', 'engineered', 'really', 'think', 'down', 'badly', 'execution', 'awful', 'lot', 'signposts', 'movie', 'make', 'understandable', 'are', 'down', 'unclear', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'missing.As', 'result', 'film', 'largely', 'incoherent', 'Many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'praise', 'dark', 'post', 'modernism', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'intended', 'fine', 'line', 'post', 'modernism', 'incoherence', 'course.A', 'case', 'point', 'episode', 'where', 'jet', 'engine', 'sky', 'no-one', 'reports', 'missing', 'Rather', 'being', 'wry', 'satire', 'corporate', 'responsibility', 'American', 'victim', 'culture', 'actually', 'intended', 'plain', 'old', 'daft', 'science', 'fiction', ""n't"", 'reported', 'missing', 'fallen', 'wormhole', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'universe', 'do', ""n't"", 'discover', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'least', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'eventually', 'are', 'several', 'aspects', 'are', 'key', 'understanding', 'what', 'going', 'can', 'only', 'discover', 'watching', 'director', 'commentary', 'having', 'incidents', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'busy', 'soaking', 'up', 'Will', 'Sergeant', 'jangling', 'guitars', 'chorus', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'Frank', 'briefly', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'driving', 'camera', 'red', 'Mustang', 'having', 'dropped', 'Donnie', 'sister', 'off', 'date', 'also', 'mentioned', 'briefly', 'having', 'died', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'driving', 'Donnie', 'father', 'school', 'prom', 'are', 'important', 'exposition', 'understanding', 'Frank', 'real', 'apparition', 'figment', 'Donnie', 'deranged', 'mind', 'director', 'commentary', 'would', 'first', 'viewing', 'be', 'none', 'wiser', 'Similarly', 'underemphasised', 'fact', 'that', 'Donnie', 'house', 'night', 'jet', 'engine', 'incident', 'parallel', 'universe', 'nothing', 'script', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'see', 'gave', 'hint', 'fact', 'Donnie', 'pills', 'are', 'only', 'placebo', 'film', 'question', 'not', 'Donnie', 'schizophrenic', 'never', 'answers', 'it.In', 'general', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'lot', 'more', 'questions', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'kicking', 'further', 'question', 'what', 'earth', 'was', 'Which', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'thing']",Donnie Darko

It definitely wasnt bad, but not thought provoking either. Though it claims to have transcended all genres, this topic was fairly bordering postmodernistic thought (for eg, darko's nihilistic imaginary pal, Frank, the caricature of the determinist, Jim Cunningham, and the meaningless destruction of donnie's room by an unknown aeriel vessel emphasizing dissociation with rootedness), and so this movie immediately springs to one's mind, masterpieces like ""un chien andalou"", ""lost highway"" or ""trainspotting"". However, there is very little basis for comparison as the concept was treated in a very simplistic and linear fashion. Not even vaguely stunning or fascinating. The direction was original but the pace and stylization were mediocre and the concept of time warps and worm holes was treated too simplistically.The characters didnt unfold many surprises either. The treatment of characters was like that in a Television serial with no mysterious aura around anyone else other than the protagonist and his imaginary pal, Frank. The picturization was not even vaguely aesthetically pleasing nor shocking.Regarding performances, Jake Gylenhaal definitely stood out and did an above average job with his role. And so did Drew Barrymore lending some dignified charm to her role as a school teacher intent on breaking deep seated conformistic moulds.On the whole, this movie deserves to be watched once (if you cant get a copy of any other intellectually stimulating masterpieces of lynch, kubrick, jodorovsky, etc).

687260,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005V3Z4,Only-A-Child,"[11, 13]","I have never been a huge fan of ""Donnie Darko"" as a science fiction story, which is how it was intended by writer/director Richard Kelly. The vague storytelling masks the gaps in logic and the budgetary constraints that did not allow them to show things more convincingly (also Kelly needed more experience before he tackled a project of this scope). However, fans have embraced this failing as the film's strength and have used the open-ended structure to mold the thing into something that fits their own individual agendas.By now most everyone knows that early in the film the world diverges into a tangent universe, a situation that must be remedied in 28 days or the normal universe will end. Donnie has been selected by some undisclosed guardian to bring the tangent and primary universes back into alignment. He is given some superhuman powers for this task but only a few clues about what must be done. Searching for answers (mostly about time travel) during the day and performing sleepwalking pranks by night (an inefficient way to bring about certain vaguely tangential events), he semi-cluelessly moves forward toward the deadline. At last he figures out that he must send an ""artifact"" (a jet engine) back from the tangent universe to the normal universe. He seemingly knows that doing so will result in his death in the normal universe but he selflessly performs the task and restores things to a stable balance.This is not as silly and contrived as it sounds but it does have some major issues that must be ignored if one is to really embrace the film. It also lacks useful philosophical depth and is just a teen movie with some intriguing thoughts about time travel.But ""Donnie Darko"" becomes extraordinary when viewed instead as an allegorical story about free will versus destiny. It is basically a twisted remake of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", with Donnie a 1988 version of George Bailey and Frank his guardian angel. Instead of being given a chance to see what the world would be like if he had not been born, Donnie is given the chance to see how his continued existence would alter events. For George Bailey the experience was full of positive revelations, for Donnie it is the opposite.To go with this unintended interpretation you just dismiss the whole thing about tangent universes. Instead Donnie dies at the beginning of the story by a random event (a jet engine falls off a plane passing over his house)over which he has no control. Since he is not essential to the event, he is given a chance to experience an additional 28 days of life to see the effects of his remaining alive and then choose between the two alternate futures. But he is also given the ability to actually see the force fields that draw everyone toward their destinies and finds himself powerless to resist such manipulation. Ultimately he makes his first ""free choice"" and elects his original death.""Heathers"" was a major influence on Kelly and ""Donnie Darko"" has that same sedated tone, with characters generally under-reacting to absurdly extreme developments. As in that film parents are not the problem, rather it is kids being incredibly (but believably) cruel to each other.The cast is solid although avoiding Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze is normally a good idea. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent and it is nice that his actual sister Maggie plays his film sister. Unfortunately both Maggie and Jena Malone are wasted in unchallenging roles with minimal screen time.Then again, what do I know?

687267,A1IA7P9DY5Y2T3,B00005V3Z4,Paul Gargan,"[5, 7]","It's quirky.  It's weird.  It's memorable.  And it has a cool soundtrack.Think ""American Beauty"" style satirical family commentary, throw in equal measures of teen angst, mental illness, time travel and one hilarious monologue on the sex life of the smurfs and you get the idea.  All the ingredients are there for a great film but while I would say the film is certainly Very Good, it never quite pulls all the threads together sufficiently to make it Great.The film opens with our hero Donnie waking up in the middle of the road beside his bike.  We don't know if he was hit by a car or hit by lightening or quite what happened (which sets the tone for the whole movie and in particular the ending - we never quite know what happened).  But one thing is for sure, things started to get weird for Donnie from then on.  (Look out also for the fantastic opening track ""Killing Moon"" by Echo and the Bunnymen).Donnie is a moody, troubled teen with a bit of pyromania in his past.  He takes medication for some type of mental illness, fights with his sister, uses bad language at the family dinner table and sleepwalks.  He also hears voices that tell him to come outside at night where he meets a rather sinister six foot bunny rabbit called Frank for the first time who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days.  Interested yet?  And it's just as well that Frank wanted to speak with Donnie because while they were chatting about the end of the world a jet engine falls from the sky and crashes into Donnie's bedroom.  You've gotta say that's original.The whole mood of the film is fantastically dark and ominous and there are enough twists and turns to hold the interest right the way through.  I've found myself thinking about this movie for some time after having seen it and pondering its themes of second chances and sacrifice.Where Donnie Darko lets itself down is that it never quite brings together the various threads laid by the large supporting cast.  There is just too much going on.  There's Donnie's girlfriend (is she/isn't she, my what a strange family she has), his father (distant and juvenile), mother (earnest and caring), school teachers (too many to mention other than to say that Drew Barrymore is badly miss-cast and Carter from ER knows more about time travel than he is letting on), a creepy motivational speaker who turns out to be a child molester (Patrick Swayze), Grandma Death (no idea how she was supposed to fit in), a shrink, Donnie's school friends and acquaintances - the list goes on and on.  I'm just not sure what all these characters had to do with the story.

I would even go as far to say this is one of the best movies ever to be put to the big screen. It is the type of movie that you have to see again and again, and will still catch something new, even the 50th time you see it. It draws you in and catches your attention early by its strangeness, and dark comedy. Then boom! A six foot tall bunny rabbit tells the main character Donie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) when the world will end. Fom there in it is a roller coster ride all the way through. I also recommend that anyone who sees this movie reads the pamphlet on the DVD called The Philosophy of Time Travel (it is hard to read but fourtunatly it has been put on the internet.) This helps to explain the REAL plot of the movie that you will not get until you read it, but only see it AFTER you see the movie. I also suggest going through the maze that is DonieDarko.com it's confusing (I had to cheat to get through it) but also helps you understand the movie beter.The prefomances in the movie are great.

687269,A1QWG77KXFU4GI,B00005V3Z4,Perrin Frch,"[1, 1]","Possibly the finest debut film by a new comer ever. Richard Kelly delivers a brilliant film about a troubled teeneager named Donnie Darko.Donnie Darko is a trouble maker who has problems at school, home, and his emotional problems. In the beggining of the director's cut we find donnie lying in the middle of a road with his bycicle laying right next to him, we then see our first look at donnie, but he doesn't get freaked out about where he is, he just simply smirks like it never happpened. We then get an idea of what sort of person Donnie is. In the original version, as he is riding his bike back home we hear a song by echo and the bunny men titled 'Killing Moon'; instead we hear 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS. I'm not necesarilly reviewing the DVD yet but just telling you some of the stuff they took out and some of the stuff they put in, so moving on, we get extra classroom scenes where donnie is reading poetry and the classroom getting new books due to the banning of a book by graham greene containing a short storie about boys who wage destruction on an old man's house.In this director's cut, we also get small little things that make the movie more appealing, for example, when donnie is dreaming or waking up to find frank (the rabbit), we see a sweet visual of donnie's one eye with reflections and info on his eye, it's hard to explain, but I wont ruin anything else for you so I'll shut up about the extra footage onthe director's cut.Now the review:I've seen the original, so I reccomend you rent the original theatrical release version first to decide which one is worth more for your purchase. This film is about a troubled but brilliant young man named donnie darko. He is a trouble maker who has to see a psychiatrist due to recent brushes with destruction and various problems to why he does them. He is also a victim of a sleep walking problem to where he goes missing every now and then. One night he is told to wake up by mysterious voice, he then obeys the voice and follows it to where he tells him to go, he eventually ends up at a golf course where a giant bunny rabbit informs him that the world will end in the period of 28:06:42:12.While donnie is at the course his troubles begin to thicken when a jet engine lands in his bedroom, no one knows why or where it came from. Donnie then begins to start obeying what frank tells him to do, because he saved his life. So then the movie really starts to kick off when donnie starts finding out about the mysteries of time travel, frank, and if the world will really end in 28 days.The acting in this movie is surprisingly good, and has a brilliant cast of actors and actresses to pull off the brilliant characters of Richard Kelly's script. The directing and cinematography is awe inspiring with great directing and visuals.And as for the soundtrack, the music is mezmirising and absolutely brilliant, music and original score. So to sum it all up, I Highly reccomend this extraordinary piece of film to anyone who knows and enjoys good cinema.

One reviewer said that it's like Donnie is taking bait.  He is, and he's supposed to.  See, Donnie is a typical highschool student with a not so typical life.  He's being visited by a 6ft rabbit with a reptilian feel to the face, and he's finding out about time travel as well as going through the motions of highschool in 1988 (great soundtrack by the way).  Along the way we meet a self help guru who well... isn't Tony Roberts by any means, a bible thumping teacher, his psychiatrist, his parents who are the coolest parents, and his two sisters as well as his new girlfriend who just moved into the neighborhood.  They are all there for a reason and they like Donnie feel something, but don't know what.  The commentary by the director/writer and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) is great, and the lost scenes are well... amazing.  Why a few made it to the cutting room floor I don't really know.

Hit the right arrow key till you get to Appendex B and hit the up button.  That will highlight an arrow and with that you hit enter.)  We also get to see the original infomercial for the selfhelp series, and several TV spots (But not as many as on the Fight Club DVD) and more.  Many people are wondering why it didn't get wide release, well I guess that there is one reason... but I can't say because it would give something about the movie away but feel free to email me to find out my opinion on that.

It's difficult to describe the story or even characterize it by genre, which shows how original the film is.  Simply put, it's about time travel, but it's about a lot more than that, too.The acting is consistently outstanding, with a list of well-known names in the cast, along with less familiar ones.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance that is so convincing, you forget that he is acting;  he IS Donnie Darko. While the story is mainly told through his eyes, the other characters are surprisingly sympathetic as well.  This is not an easy feat for a script to accomplish, especially when the viewer must focus so much attention on every event. It would have been easy to create a one-dimensional hero and a bunch of villains, but writer/director Richard Kelly doesn't take the easy way out.Instead, we get a highly intelligent and challenging film that engages us as much as it baffles us, that injects enough humor to keep us from stress-overload, and most importantly, makes us want to watch it again and again, even after we know what's going on.  In this sense, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; succeeds where other films have fallen short:  for example, I enjoyed the complexities of &quot;Memento&quot;, but I was not able to identify or even care very much about any of the characters.  The same was true of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.  Both are excellent films, but I viewed both from a distance, more analytically than emotionally.I did not view &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; from a distance.  I was drawn into the world that it creates, and enjoyed it enough to return more than once.  A brilliant first film from Richard Kelly, who has set a very high standard for himself.The DVD does full justice to this fine movie.  The video and audio are excellent, and the extra features are quite thorough.

I was curious so I looked up the movie online, and what I read made me even more interested in seeing it. But I was concerned I might be bored because I knew the plot.So I found it on TV one night and sat watching so spellbound I didn't even change my position on the couch. About an hour into the movie, my husband came upstairs and said, ""What are you watching?""""Donnie Darko.""""Oh. What's it about?""I had to sit there for about 30 seconds, and then the only explanation I could give was a sigh from the deepest part of my chest. And even then, when the movie was done, all I wanted to do was stare at the black TV screen for about another hour.So if you're worried about the surprises being ruined, rest assured it is impossible to write a spoiler for this film. Complex, layered, ambiguous, intense, and yes, dark, it is something you have to see to even begin to understand.The reviews here cover most aspects of the film's possible meanings, so I'm only going to add my one take. Now I'm not one to find religious messages in everything, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I did see a few parallels between Donnie's story and the Jesus story. First, when Donnie starts telling the truth, people really resent it. The results are sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but they all have one thing in common: Nobody wants to listen because they're afraid of what they'll hear.Then you have Donnie's choice to accept his death. If he saves his own life, many other people's lives will be ruined; if he chooses to die, these people will be spared. And yet....Donnie dies and the motivational speaker is still mired in a horrid mess of a life; Donnie's family is devastated; and the gym teacher is still blinkering herself into a black/white paradigm. So did Donnie's death really serve any purpose? I won't give my answer to that question, because this is a film everyone must see and process for him- or herself. And this is why I would definitely recommend getting a DVD, because you need to watch it more than once to even start to sort it out.Very rarely does a film this powerful and affecting come along.

It's a strange, genre bending film with a knock-out ending that will lead to hours of discussion long after the final credits roll.Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager who in-between zoning out at school and regular trips to his shrink, starts being visited by a demonic rabbit named Frank. Darko is told the world is going to end, and is given orders as this story becomes more and more absurd. Is everything what it seems? What does everything mean? And when the climax is reached, just when you think you're going to get some answers, plot twists the size of Jupiter knock you down for the count and confuse you even more. After two viewings I'm still trying to figure it out. But that is what makes this film so much fun. There are many puzzle pieces throughout the film, some obvious and some you never notice until repeat viewings. And the movie is so much fun to watch that each viewing is an intense, exciting experience.A number of pieces come together to make this movie work. The cinematography is excellent. From the opening [picture] of Darko lying on the hill top road to the final image, each [scene] is disturbing, eerie and above all, beautiful. And the accompanying soundtrack fits these scenes perfectly. Most impressive is a hard hitting montage at the end to a haunting cover of a Tears for Fears song. The editing in a number of scenes is equally impressive. For example, in the first scene at Darko's school, the camera flies around switching from slow motion to fast forward, introducing all the supporting characters as they cross each other's paths. The results will have you rewinding the scene and many others over and over out of their sheer beauty. Helping the film in its disturbed nature is Gyllenhaal's characterization of Darko, sending down-right scary smirks and haunting glares all throughout the film.Despite all these successes, though, Donnie Dark does have some significant problems. Much of the A-list supporting cast, such as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze and Noah Wylie, while superb in their roles, aren't given enough to do. Barrymore and Wylie especially needed more time to establish their relationship and characterizations. Also, while the film is supposed to be abstract and mind bending, it sometimes goes a little too far without offering just a little bit of explanation. Mostly just some added character motivation here and there would make a little more sense out of it.While some absurdity works and some doesn't, in the end the good in this film far outweigh its problems, and Donnie Darko shows great promise for newcomer Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it. After all, any film that inspires hours of thought and discussion long after it ends succeeds on all accounts. You'll want to own this one for repeat viewings.",4,"Wildly strange and entertaining, and gets your mind spinning",1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,2943,"['Flying', 'theaters', 'anyone', 'really', 'even', 'heard', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'one', 'little', 'gems', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'strange', 'genre', 'bending', 'film', 'knock-out', 'ending', 'will', 'lead', 'hours', 'discussion', 'long', 'final', 'credits', 'roll.Donnie', 'Darko', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'who', 'in-between', 'zoning', 'out', 'school', 'regular', 'trips', 'shrink', 'being', 'visited', 'demonic', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Frank', 'Darko', 'told', 'world', 'going', 'end', 'given', 'orders', 'story', 'more', 'more', 'absurd', 'everything', 'what', 'What', 'everything', 'mean', 'when', 'climax', 'reached', 'just', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'answers', 'plot', 'size', 'Jupiter', 'knock', 'down', 'count', 'confuse', 'even', 'more', 'two', 'viewings', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'are', 'many', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'film', 'obvious', 'never', 'notice', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'viewing', 'intense', 'exciting', 'experience.A', 'number', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'opening', '[', 'picture', ']', 'Darko', 'lying', 'hill', 'top', 'road', 'final', 'image', '[', 'scene', ']', 'disturbing', 'eerie', 'beautiful', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'scenes', 'perfectly', 'Most', 'impressive', 'hard', 'hitting', 'montage', 'end', 'haunting', 'cover', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'song', 'editing', 'number', 'scenes', 'equally', 'impressive', 'example', 'first', 'scene', 'Darko', 'school', 'camera', 'switching', 'slow', 'motion', 'fast', 'forward', 'introducing', 'supporting', 'characters', 'cross', 'other', 'paths', 'results', 'will', 'have', 'rewinding', 'scene', 'many', 'others', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'Helping', 'film', 'disturbed', 'nature', 'Gyllenhaal', 'characterization', 'Darko', 'sending', 'down-right', 'scary', 'smirks', 'haunting', 'glares', 'film.Despite', 'successes', 'though', 'Donnie', 'Dark', 'have', 'significant', 'problems', 'Much', 'A-list', 'supporting', 'cast', 'such', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Noah', 'Wylie', 'superb', 'roles', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'do', 'Barrymore', 'Wylie', 'especially', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'establish', 'relationship', 'characterizations', 'Also', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'abstract', 'mind', 'bending', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'offering', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'explanation', 'Mostly', 'just', 'added', 'character', 'motivation', 'here', 'there', 'would', 'make', 'little', 'more', 'sense', 'it.While', 'absurdity', 'works', ""n't"", 'end', 'good', 'film', 'far', 'problems', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'great', 'promise', 'newcomer', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'hours', 'thought', 'discussion', 'long', 'accounts', ""'ll"", 'want', 'own', 'one', 'repeat', 'viewings']",Donnie Darko

No one saw in the theater, but once people like you and me get their hands on it in the video store, we make damn sure all our friends see it.The coolest thing about ""Donnie Darko"" is that it's a bonafide independent sci-fi film. This movie has some impressive visuals and visual effects, and it was all made on a $4.5 million budget. Of course, when Drew Barrymore is your executive producer, I bet you get some deals and steals here and there...but it's still amazing that this film cost so little to make.Jake Gyllenhall is wonderful as the title character; somehow, the kid who stooped to the all-time low of ""Bubble Boy"" is able to carry a mind-bending genre film with a large cast of good actors.The film itself is at once hysterical and depressing; realistic and surreal; frustrating and accommodating. It's certainly an original work from a first time director, and a film that will certainly leave you with more questions than answers. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Any movie that requires you to think about it well after the credits roll is doing something right. ""Donnie Darko"" and Spielberg's ""A.I.

But still there are some things that need to be said. I believe the directors and writers of this movie intended for it to be complex, but rather than this, they made it an unorganized collection of clips and dialog just to fit into a two hour time limit.  This movie did have amazing if not the greatest inventive plotline I have ever seen, it tackled the most important issues in life and death.  Such as religion and/or non-religion, the human mind, family, and love. But Nothing was portrayed the way it was intended to be portrayed. Many characters including Drew Barrymore?s were underdeveloped, and when events took place in their lives, there was no impact to the viewer because of this.  The impact fulness of every event in this movie is dwindled down to a bead because of the lack of character development.  After watching The Virgin Suicides, I understand that it is the idea of some directors and writers to create a sort of third person view movie, as if a book.  This would have made an excellent book.  It makes the viewer focus more on the moral issues and imagery of the story rather than the characters.  However, it seems the producers wanted to impress completely different groups of audiences, one teenagers, the other, the oddballs of the world.  Due to the lack of structure to the movie, all of us oddballs were disappointed, especially with certain mediocre scenes of some characters (Donnie/sister/friends) using out of place profanity and sexual content, when this time could have been targeted to character development and relationships.  Due to this, I was unable to see the character Donnie as a rare and brilliant person, and rather just an average, mediocre teenager.  This is far from complex and brilliant scenes. The teenage crowd was unimpressed by this sloppy attempt at teenage relation.  Many of the deleted scenes were vital, and needed to be included in the movie in order for the viewer to feel and understand the whole concept of it. But the movie was inventive, and had some note worthy parts to it. Sadly, this was just the stories topics, original they were, but not done justice by the acting and character interaction.  The thing that gave it mystical complex beauty was the music, which sets the viewer off into a journey into the stars.  To anyone, I would suggest buying just the album, which is excellent, the score is the only thing that saved this movie from being mush, and providing it with a certain brilliance I was expecting.  The movie was certainly original, and honestly brilliant in some aspects.

Richard Kelly was able to pull off both of these in his first try, with Donnie Darko. Donnie Darko is the tale of a teenager of the title's namesake (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is also a somnabulist. He is from an upperclass family which doesn't have your normal table topics for dinner. Coupled with the fact that Donnie sees a psychiatrist and takes psychiatric medication is fertile territory to make for such a vibrant character. Every character (even the janitor!) in the film springs to life with some kind of nuanced magic of which Richard Kelly is the only practitioner.The intricacy is nothing to be overlooked; as the story touches on philosophy, time travel, the end of the world and subtexts. You see unusual things: hypnosis, detached jet engines, two-bit horror movies, dirty voyeurs and a geriatric woman who can't stay off the road.

687284,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,B00005V3Z4,R. A Rubin,"[3, 6]","Donnie Darko is a teen horror film.  In addition, it's a teen romance.  In addition, Donnie Darko is a Hamletian study in familial relationship.  The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty.  I particularly liked the scenes with the lady-shrink where under hypnosis Donnie has a self-pleasuring moment.  Things can go wrong in those shrink sessions for sure.There are two groups of adults here, the Democrats and the Republicans.  Dukakis is smart and thoughtful.  Bush 1 is stammering and smarmy.  The Physical Education teacher is new-age bunko, book burning, inflexible along with her idol, Patrick Swayze, as the handsome motivational speaker with one message, there's Fear and Love.  To contrast, Drew Barrymore plays the really cool young English teacher that gets canned for being too Liberal.  Donnie rebels and insists there is a world of grays out there, not black and white.  Okay, this is relativism which has it's own critics.  I'd go along with the evil Dan Quail idea if it were more developed, but good and evil in Darko is pretty cardboard.I'm not at all sure why Kelly decided it was important to do a 1988 film in 2001.  You got me on that one.  There's as much political animosity and self-help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's.  I can only assume that the 80's was a crucible for the director.Finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment.

I am not a horror fan, nor like gore. I am glad however I took a chance and bought this film and watched it. Unique doesn't even begin to describe this film. Rest assured the R rating is mainly for extremely strong language. There is no graphic violence or gore involved, nor any nudity or sex, whatsoever. The disturbing part comes from anticipation and not understanding what you are seeing here.It is a profoundly unique well done story and no scene can be anticipated in advance as in many other Hollywood films.  It is not hard to understand now why this is such a cult classic!The Blu-Ray Directors cut is very high quality, extremely crisp, and the sound excellent.

If the rest of his films are as good as Donnie Darko, America has found its first truly great director since John Huston.The title character (Jake Gyllenhaal, who easily deserved last year&#146;s Best Actor award for this role) plays a paranoid schizophrenic high school students whose best friend is a six-foot-tall mutant-looking rabbit named Frank (James Duval [Go/The Doom Generation]). No, no one but Donnie is capable of seeing Frank. Frank makes Donnie do very bad things.When not under Frank&#146;s powers of suggestion, Donnie is your typical high school student. Along the way, he acquires a girlfriend, Gretchen (Jena Malone, of Life as a House fame), goes to class, feuds with his teachers, has deep and meaningful discussions about the sex lives of the Smurfs, gets bullied by the school bad boys, tries to make life easier for an exchange student, and hangs out with his similarly-outcast friends. When midnight comes, however, Frank pops up, and Donnie becomes&#133; someone else. The first time we see Frank, he tells Donnie the world will end in twenty-four days and some change. And things go downhill from there.Add to this mess Donnie&#146;s English (Drew Barrymore) and Science (Noah Wyle) teachers, whom he likes; the insane Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant [Speed]), whom he hates (she seems to be some kind of psychology teacher with a twisted agenda); his psychiatrist (the redoubtable Katherine Ross); a motivational speaker who seems to have fooled everyone but Donnie (Patrick Swayze); and, of course, his family, who think he&#146;s absolutely insane. It&#146;s a thick, tasty stew of teen angst, mental illness, and the sheer beauty of growing up different than everyone else. Like life, it&#146;s both funny and sad by turns, and sometimes cruel; Donnie wins a few battles, loses a few. The only real difference between Donnie and most high school outcasts is that, well, he&#146;s got this friend, see&#133;All of this makes Donnie Darko a good film. What makes it a great film is all the thought that went into the script and the direction; the underlying meanings, the visual clues, the attention to detail. Kelly makes M. Night Shayamalan directing The Sixth Sense look like an ogre with a mallet; this is the most symbolically-laden film since Begotten, at least, and possibly going all the way back to the original Cape Fear.Donnie Darko earned itself a place on the all-time 100-best list immediately. **** ",5,By far one of the best of 2001,1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,2509,"['Donnie', 'Darko', 'Richard', 'Kelly', '2001', 'hail', 'coming', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'rest', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'America', 'found', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'director', 'John', 'Huston.The', 'title', 'character', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'easily', 'deserved', 'last', 'year', '146', 's', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'role', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'best', 'friend', 'six-foot-tall', 'mutant-looking', 'rabbit', 'named', 'Frank', 'James', 'Duval', '[', 'Go/The', 'Doom', 'Generation', ']', 'No', 'one', 'Donnie', 'capable', 'seeing', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'Donnie', 'do', 'very', 'bad', 'things.When', 'not', 'Frank', '146', 's', 'powers', 'suggestion', 'Donnie', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'way', 'girlfriend', 'Gretchen', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Life', 'House', 'fame', 'class', 'feuds', 'teachers', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'discussions', 'sex', 'lives', 'Smurfs', 'bullied', 'school', 'bad', 'boys', 'tries', 'make', 'life', 'easier', 'exchange', 'student', 'hangs', 'out', 'similarly-outcast', 'friends', 'When', 'midnight', 'however', 'Frank', 'up', 'Donnie', '133', 'someone', 'else', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'Frank', 'Donnie', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'twenty-four', 'days', 'change', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'there.Add', 'mess', 'Donnie', '146', 's', 'English', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Science', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'teachers', 'whom', 'insane', 'Kitty', 'Farmer', 'Beth', 'Grant', '[', 'Speed', ']', 'whom', 'be', 'kind', 'psychology', 'teacher', 'twisted', 'agenda', 'psychiatrist', 'redoubtable', 'Katherine', 'Ross', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'who', 'have', 'fooled', 'everyone', 'Donnie', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'course', 'family', 'who', 'think', '146', 's', 'absolutely', 'insane', '146', 's', 'thick', 'tasty', 'stew', 'teen', 'angst', 'mental', 'illness', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'growing', 'up', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'life', '146', 's', 'funny', 'sad', 'turns', 'sometimes', 'cruel', 'Donnie', 'few', 'battles', 'few', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'Donnie', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'outcasts', 'well', '146', 's', 'got', 'friend', 'see', '133', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'good', 'film', 'What', 'great', 'film', 'thought', 'went', 'script', 'direction', 'underlying', 'meanings', 'visual', 'clues', 'attention', 'detail', 'Kelly', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shayamalan', 'directing', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'look', 'ogre', 'mallet', 'most', 'symbolically-laden', 'film', 'Begotten', 'least', 'possibly', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'original', 'Cape', 'Fear.Donnie', 'Darko', 'earned', 'place', 'all-time', '100-best', 'list', 'immediately', '****']",Donnie Darko

This is a good reason I tend to rent movies away from the Hollywood formula, going for foreign films. With writer / director Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko, I found a treat close to home. With cameos from Drew Barrymore, Noel Wyle and Patrick Swayze this movie carries you into the past, pre school shootings and unexplainable violence from today's youth. Set in 1988 (a year after I graduated high school), Donnie Darko uses the music of the times and the down-home settings to drive the point home. Quoted by Drew Barrymore (unfortunately deleted from the film), ""Kids today are lost because the parents don't know how to reach them,"" Or close to that. Our hero, Donnie, descends into madness when he comes full circle in the month of October to learn of the future events through his imaginary friend, a dark twisted rendition of Harvey with Jimmy Stuart, called Frank ""the rabbit"". Frank explains, through visuals with excellent special FX that the path we lead in this life is predetermined by a source that is expelled from your body. Confusing? Good! To appreciate the subtle use of language and visuals Donnie Darko isn't a ""horror"" movie, you could border it with Sci-Fi, you have to see the film! I recommend this to anyone that wants a taste of nostalgia from the late 80's without the trite clich&eacute;s always seen in movies.

Movies that take advantage of the space are the ones that generally look better. This Donnie Darko Director's Cut puts both theatrical and Director's versions separately onto ONE disc, cutting the amount of space available for each in half. The result:  Neither cut looks better than a standard DVD. The image quality is soft to the point where film grain is barely even visible, and detail is poor, except in the occasional closeup.I didn't actually watch the Directors cut until I bought this version recently, and didnt understand what the hub-bub was about.  The sound mixing in the DC is downright awful in places where changes have been made.  Most of the sound changes involve fading out the (excellent) score by Michael Andrews and putting loud sound effects in their place.  Extra material in scenes adds some slight character padding that portrays Donnie in a somewhat less sinister light, which the removal of some of the music seems to want to suggest, too.  There's nothing wrong with that, but a big part of the film's charm is the mood it evokes, and the score is a big part of it. Cutting it down just makes the tone of the film even harder to get a hold of, if that's possible...The bonus disc contains a filmmakers journal, which will certainly interest film buffs, a documentary called 'they made do it too' about people who really liked the movie talking about how they liked the movie, and #1 fan: A Darkomentary (which I didn't watch).The Philosophy of Time Travel book that was included in the original DVD is sadly not included here.I'm a fan of the film, and even liked Kelly's Southland Tales (which was a good blu-ray, if not a great movie), but I can't recommend this release... it's just meh.If they re-release the theatrical cut as a standalone with a better transfer, I'm down.",2,2 Poor Transfers - Why?,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,1873,"['Just', 'bit', 'math', 'blu-ray', 'disc', '50', 'GB', 'data', 'Movies', 'take', 'advantage', 'space', 'are', 'ones', 'generally', 'look', 'better', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Director', 'Cut', 'theatrical', 'Director', 'versions', 'separately', 'ONE', 'disc', 'cutting', 'amount', 'space', 'available', 'half', 'result', 'cut', 'better', 'standard', 'DVD', 'image', 'quality', 'soft', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'grain', 'barely', 'even', 'visible', 'detail', 'poor', 'occasional', 'closeup.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'watch', 'Directors', 'cut', 'bought', 'version', 'recently', 'didnt', 'understand', 'what', 'hub-bub', 'was', 'about', 'sound', 'mixing', 'DC', 'downright', 'awful', 'places', 'where', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Most', 'sound', 'changes', 'involve', 'fading', 'out', 'excellent', 'score', 'Michael', 'Andrews', 'putting', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'place', 'Extra', 'material', 'scenes', 'slight', 'character', 'padding', 'Donnie', 'somewhat', 'less', 'sinister', 'light', 'removal', 'music', 'want', 'suggest', 'too', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'charm', 'mood', 'score', 'big', 'part', 'Cutting', 'down', 'just', 'tone', 'film', 'even', 'harder', 'get', 'hold', 'possible', 'bonus', 'disc', 'filmmakers', 'journal', 'will', 'certainly', 'interest', 'film', 'buffs', 'documentary', 'called', ""'they"", 'made', 'do', 'too', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'talking', 'how', 'liked', 'movie', '1', 'fan', 'Darkomentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', '.The', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'book', 'was', 'included', 'original', 'DVD', 'sadly', 'not', 'included', 'here.I', ""'m"", 'fan', 'film', 'even', 'liked', 'Kelly', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'was', 'good', 'blu-ray', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'release', 'just', 'meh.If', 're-release', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'standalone', 'better', 'transfer', ""'m"", 'down']",Donnie Darko

I was spellbound for the next 113 minutes.Set in the late 80's Donnie Darko is the story of a young man's alienation through mental illness and general teenage angst. Soon after a jet engine mysteriously crashes into Donnie's bedroom he starts receiving visits from a prophetic character in a strange rabbit costume named Frank. His subsequent interactions with Frank, teachers, friends, family, and his therapist weave a completely original and absorbing tale. Donnie's interest in time travel and anxiety about Frank's apocolyptic predictions move the story forward in a completely unpredictable way. There is a great deal of humour, especially with Donnie's disdain for the local self help guru.The usual high school teen-drama characters present themselves but they are fleshed out with uncommon depth in this movie, Donnie's family are likeable and very functional, his teachers have lives outside school and his girlfriend has a multi-dimensional personality with troubles of her own.A hypnotic and darkly beautiful original soundtrack is complemented by one of the best selections of eighties music I have heard in recent memory. Honestly the way this music is integrated with such meaning and purpose to the film's narative you'd think it was written for it. From &quot;Killing Moon&quot; in the opening scene, tracks from bands like Tears for Fears and Joy Division complement perfectly every time. In one scene where Donnie's halucinations get a little out of hand &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; by Australian band the Church is used so well I got a rush of blood to the head, and the final scene uses a re-working of Tears for Fears &quot;Mad World&quot; to great tragic effect.Some reviewers have been upset by what they see as a confusing ending, but I found the ending deeply moving and satisfying, as I did the movie as a whole.",5,"Brilliant, Original Movie with Outstanding Soundtrack",1052697600,"05 12, 2003",2003,2037,"['thunder', 'rumbled', 'away', 'distant', 'mountains', 'left', 'young', 'man', 'lying', 'middle', 'road', 'first', 'notes', 'Echo', 'Bunnymen', 'quot', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'quot', 'out', 'was', 'spellbound', 'next', '113', 'minutes.Set', 'late', '80', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'alienation', 'mental', 'illness', 'general', 'teenage', 'angst', 'Soon', 'jet', 'engine', 'mysteriously', 'Donnie', 'bedroom', 'receiving', 'visits', 'prophetic', 'character', 'strange', 'rabbit', 'costume', 'named', 'Frank', 'subsequent', 'interactions', 'Frank', 'teachers', 'friends', 'family', 'therapist', 'weave', 'completely', 'original', 'absorbing', 'tale', 'Donnie', 'interest', 'time', 'travel', 'anxiety', 'Frank', 'apocolyptic', 'predictions', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'completely', 'unpredictable', 'way', 'great', 'deal', 'humour', 'especially', 'Donnie', 'disdain', 'local', 'self', 'help', 'guru.The', 'usual', 'high', 'school', 'teen-drama', 'characters', 'present', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'uncommon', 'depth', 'movie', 'Donnie', 'family', 'are', 'likeable', 'very', 'functional', 'teachers', 'have', 'lives', 'outside', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'multi-dimensional', 'personality', 'troubles', 'own.A', 'hypnotic', 'darkly', 'beautiful', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'complemented', 'one', 'best', 'selections', 'eighties', 'music', 'have', 'heard', 'recent', 'memory', 'Honestly', 'way', 'music', 'integrated', 'such', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'film', 'narative', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'written', 'From', 'quot', 'Killing', 'Moon', 'quot', 'opening', 'scene', 'tracks', 'bands', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'Joy', 'Division', 'complement', 'perfectly', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Donnie', 'halucinations', 'get', 'little', 'hand', 'quot', 'Milky', 'Way', 'quot', 'Australian', 'band', 'Church', 'used', 'so', 'well', 'got', 'rush', 'blood', 'head', 'final', 'scene', 're-working', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'quot', 'Mad', 'World', 'quot', 'great', 'tragic', 'effect.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'upset', 'what', 'see', 'confusing', 'ending', 'found', 'ending', 'deeply', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'did', 'movie', 'whole']",Donnie Darko

It is worth its fans though it is a very good and fascinating film with truly, as they say behind the scenes, a universal meaning. The whole plot though is something so amazing but mind- boggling that you just feel you need to talk to your friends or your parents about it right away after you watch it. This movie raised so many questions honestly and probably made a lot of people expand their thoughts just a little more for a little while about possibility and how limitless it truly is.Why this movie is not five stars readers may wonder? The ending itself, though understandable and satisfying, may not be easily understood the first time you watch it. I know it didn't for me. I was a bit confused the first time I watched the ending, so it was lucky for me that I waited until it came out on DVD so I could go back to the ending once or twice and put the pieces together more slowly. Yet it only takes once or twice glance at the ending again to get it. The point is though the ending isn't exactly a sure thing for most when they watch it for the first time, so I guess that is why they lose one star. After looking back once or twice though in the last few moments of the film, it all eventually comes together into again like I said a satisfying and good ending.Overall I liked this movie a lot, and I do think this year it is one of the best films I have seen. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I'm just terribly afraid of rabbits now...

Or so says Frank, the pshcyotic bunny rabbit that tells Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) to do violent things.If you're buying the director's cut, then you've probably already seen this movie about 28 times. If you haven't, let me fill you in.In 1988 suburban Middlesex, Donnie Darko lives with his loving family in an ordinary life. But one night he sleepwalks towards Frank where he recieves information about the world's end, and in the process dodges death when a jet engine falls on his room (you heard me right-a jet engine). Because Frank saved his life, Donnie now must do what Frank tells him to do. Given this time until the world ends, Donnie tries to make sense of what has happened to him, as well as connect with his family, fall for a girl, and question the search for God, and in the process discovers that he should've died when the jet engine fell on his room.The main reason why Donnie Darko is already a cult classic at age 4 is because it doesn't clearly offer a solution, leaving the viewer in the dark as to figure out the pretzel-like remains. But that's also why people love it. I honestly loved it because it unknowlingly re-examins what it means to live; If the world were to really end in 28 days, what would YOU do?With an impressive cast (Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze have supporting roles), lots of satirical humor, and many questions to ask, Donnie Darko remains a wonderful movie that dares to be original and will leave you thinking and wondering long after the credits end.But the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is for the director's cut and the special features. In the Director's Cut Edition, the movie is clogged with excerps from 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', a fictional book prominatly featured in the film. It didn't even really achieve what it meant to-offer a clearer answer to the film's twisty plot. They belong in the special features department, like the original DVD did. And the sound and visual affects added in completly ruin it, such as the sci-fi like sound affects in the opening credits-they were NOT needed and were better without it; It seemed like Richard Kelly took too many notes from 'E.T.' while cutting the film. And the topper comes at the montage/letter to Roberta Sparrow, a powerful intro to the famously poignant 'Mad World' sequence. The director decided to add of all things FIREWORKS. WHY FIREWORKS? They are a total distraction to the beautiful montage and are not needed at all.The special features are another story (actually, the same). The original DVD had an insightful commentary by star Jake Gyllenhaal and writer/director Richard Kelly (the much cluttered remaining cast and crew commentary could've been skipped), while this one features Richard Kelly and his friend Kevin Smith. This commentary doesn't say much about the actual movie, but rather sounds more like a conversation between two buddies over coffee and cigarettes. Vastly un-needed is the documentary about British people who loved the movie, as well as the short movie about the #1 Donnie Darko fan-it's more sad and disturbing (in the fact that someone actually loves any movie THAT MUCH) than funny. The least boring is the production diary with commentary by the cinematographer.If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly advise you to rent the regular DVD, form an opinion, then, if and only if you really loved the original movie, shimmy on down to the video rental store (or wait a day for your Netflix DVD to come in the mail) and watch this.

He is a Marine, off in Iraq right now. Bless his heart. So, to feel close to him, I watched this and his other fav - ""Napoleon Dynamite.""

The evil smile. The fear. The horny kid at the therapist.. He was made for this roll! He was excellent.The girlfriend, also very good.

687316,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005V3Z4,Samuel Chell,"[11, 13]","I fell asleep on this film a few years ago when I started it too late the night before it was due back at the video store.  It's not what I expected of a so-called ""cult"" film, or even a sci-fi or troubled-teenager genre flick.  Now, having some more time and patience, I gave this Director's Cut the careful attention it deserves, and the rewards are considerable.  The 26-year-old Kelly shoots movies like a pro if not an art movie director.  None of the ""shock editing"" that we've become so accustomed and desensitized to.  Instead, he favors long takes, slow pacing, and some of the most fluid camera movement in recent memory.  Moreover, he has a true artist's eye for shot composition, using the 2.5:1 anamorphic lens to maximum aesthetic and narrative effect in practically every frame.All the same, I've just ordered the earlier, shorter version to see if some of the apparent flaws I noticed in the Director's Cut are lessened.  For one, some of the scenes are overly formulaic and obvious--both in the scripting and filming.  The hypocritical, self-righteous characters are played quite loudly, bordering on flat caricature.  Moreover, Kelly pulls gratuitous tricks like mocking them with ""fast action"" shooting (whereas the youthful romantic hero and heroine, of course, are shot in slow motion).  Drew Barrymore seems to occupy unnecessary screen time toward the end of the film, tilting this POV film to her situation rather than Darko's.  Also, all the time-travel nonsense, which I understand has been exaggerated in both this version and on a Johnny Darko website, could be reduced to the betterment of the film, imo.  Still, the script is light years ahead of juvenilia time-wasters like Dazed and Confused (unless you're a teenager).Although Kelly talks about the film as Reagan-era social satire (an easy target, since the 80s were a rerun of the repressive 1950s), the movie is less about an historical period than about other movies: in fact, it's a collection of mirrors reflecting other movies.  Several shots of Darko recall Norman Bates, when we learn about his dual identity at the end of Psycho.  Darko's alter ego, Frank, recalls Jeffrey Beaumont's dark twin, Frank (Dennis Hopper), in Lynch's Blue Velvet.  The playing off of psychological vs. chronological time, challenging the viewer to decide which temporal dimension he is currently viewing, reprises Lynne's remarkable film, ""Jacob's Ladder.""  And the time-travel theme owes less to ""Back to the Future"" than ""serious"" science fiction movies like ""12 Monkeys"" and the 30-minute influential French film classic by Chris Marker: ""La Jetee.""But most strikingly, the film echoes the central theme of Burgess/Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange,"" where Alex and his Droogs talk Nadsat and commit rape and violence to assert their free choice and humanity in a world that threatens to ""condition"" them, transforming them into deterministic machines.  Two key moments in Darko: the intercut chapter with the quote, ""The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from oblivion,"" and Darko's conversation with his science teacher, who explains to him that if he were able to know his future, he would have a choice to accept or avoid it, which means that destiny would come to an end.This is a film that celebrates choice--not just its characters' but the viewers'.  Moviegoers need not subject themselves to mindless surrogate experiences in virtual reality, pretending that loneliness and fear are more imagined than real. The attentive viewer is likely to feel that the disturbed teen protagonist has made some significant choices which, however risky or even deadly, have prepared him to face the difficult circumstances of life that none of us can control.Finally, this is a director who definitely knows Catcher in the Rye, infusing his main character with so much of Holden's spirit (obsession with sex and death, impatience with phoniness and pretense, adoption of grandiose thinking and a savior complex) that Donny Darko becomes the ""everychild"" in each of us, more recognizable than we may be inclined to admit.",5,A Sleeper (but don't fall asleep on it),1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,4103,"['fell', 'asleep', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'started', 'too', 'late', 'night', 'was', 'due', 'back', 'video', 'store', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'so-called', 'cult', 'film', 'even', 'sci-fi', 'troubled-teenager', 'genre', 'flick', 'Now', 'having', 'more', 'time', 'patience', 'gave', 'Director', 'Cut', 'careful', 'attention', 'rewards', 'are', 'considerable', '26-year-old', 'Kelly', 'shoots', 'movies', 'pro', 'not', 'art', 'movie', 'director', 'None', 'shock', 'editing', ""'ve"", 'become', 'so', 'accustomed', 'desensitized', 'Instead', 'long', 'slow', 'pacing', 'most', 'fluid', 'camera', 'movement', 'recent', 'memory', 'Moreover', 'true', 'artist', 'eye', 'shot', 'composition', 'using', '2.5:1', 'anamorphic', 'lens', 'maximum', 'aesthetic', 'narrative', 'effect', 'practically', 'frame.All', 'same', ""'ve"", 'just', 'ordered', 'earlier', 'shorter', 'version', 'see', 'apparent', 'flaws', 'noticed', 'Director', 'Cut', 'are', 'lessened', 'one', 'scenes', 'are', 'overly', 'formulaic', 'obvious', 'scripting', 'filming', 'hypocritical', 'self-righteous', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'quite', 'loudly', 'bordering', 'flat', 'caricature', 'Moreover', 'Kelly', 'gratuitous', 'tricks', 'mocking', 'fast', 'action', 'shooting', 'youthful', 'romantic', 'hero', 'heroine', 'course', 'are', 'shot', 'slow', 'motion', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'occupy', 'unnecessary', 'screen', 'time', 'end', 'film', 'tilting', 'POV', 'film', 'situation', 'rather', 'Darko', 'Also', 'time-travel', 'nonsense', 'understand', 'been', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'Johnny', 'Darko', 'website', 'could', 'be', 'reduced', 'betterment', 'film', 'imo', 'Still', 'script', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'juvenilia', 'time-wasters', 'Dazed', 'Confused', ""'re"", 'teenager', 'Kelly', 'talks', 'film', 'Reagan-era', 'social', 'satire', 'easy', 'target', '80s', 'were', 'rerun', 'repressive', '1950s', 'movie', 'less', 'historical', 'period', 'other', 'movies', 'fact', 'collection', 'mirrors', 'reflecting', 'other', 'movies', 'Several', 'shots', 'Darko', 'recall', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'when', 'learn', 'dual', 'identity', 'end', 'Psycho', 'Darko', 'alter', 'ego', 'Frank', 'Jeffrey', 'Beaumont', 'dark', 'twin', 'Frank', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Lynch', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'playing', 'psychological', 'vs.', 'chronological', 'time', 'challenging', 'viewer', 'decide', 'temporal', 'dimension', 'currently', 'viewing', 'Lynne', 'remarkable', 'film', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'time-travel', 'theme', 'less', 'Back', 'Future', 'serious', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', '12', 'Monkeys', '30-minute', 'influential', 'French', 'film', 'classic', 'Chris', 'Marker', 'La', 'Jetee', 'most', 'strikingly', 'film', 'central', 'theme', 'Burgess/Kubrick', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'where', 'Alex', 'Droogs', 'talk', 'Nadsat', 'commit', 'rape', 'violence', 'assert', 'free', 'choice', 'humanity', 'world', 'condition', 'transforming', 'deterministic', 'machines', 'Two', 'key', 'moments', 'Darko', 'intercut', 'chapter', 'quote', 'Manipulated', 'Living', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'oblivion', 'Darko', 'conversation', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'know', 'future', 'would', 'have', 'choice', 'accept', 'avoid', 'destiny', 'would', 'come', 'end.This', 'film', 'choice', 'not', 'just', 'characters', 'viewers', 'Moviegoers', 'need', 'not', 'subject', 'mindless', 'surrogate', 'experiences', 'virtual', 'reality', 'pretending', 'loneliness', 'fear', 'are', 'more', 'imagined', 'real', 'attentive', 'viewer', 'likely', 'feel', 'disturbed', 'teen', 'protagonist', 'made', 'significant', 'choices', 'however', 'risky', 'even', 'deadly', 'have', 'prepared', 'face', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'life', 'none', 'can', 'control.Finally', 'director', 'who', 'definitely', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'infusing', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'Holden', 'spirit', 'obsession', 'sex', 'death', 'impatience', 'phoniness', 'pretense', 'adoption', 'grandiose', 'thinking', 'savior', 'complex', 'Donny', 'Darko', 'everychild', 'more', 'recognizable', 'may', 'be', 'inclined', 'admit']",Donnie Darko

The mother especially comes across as cold. In fact, I cannot think of any wasteful moments in this movie that do not further the plot.

I could really relate to the main character, although most schizophrenics don't act on their thoughts by becoming violent. The twist ending is really satisfying.

The movie was first shown at Sundance Film Festival where it was met with a lot of enthusiasm and good reviews. This is what prompted me add this movie to my collection.Before watching the movie I tried not to read a lot about it's plot and in this case it was a good deccision. The story is about a troubled teenage boy who has vissions of a giant rabbit who predicts that the world will end in 28 days.In some ways this movie reminds me of ""12 Monkeys"" as it deals with time travel and the parradoxes connected to it. But the plot and the movies 1980's surreal subburban setting are highly original. The production designer Alexander Hammond (""K-Pax"", ""Men in Black II"") did an excellent job of capturing various setting in which the story takes place. Surreal feel to the movie is greatly helped by the beautifull cinematography of Steven Poster (""Someone to watch over me"").The movies cast is diverse. The lead role of Donnie Darko is extremly well performed by Jake Gyllenhaal, previously unknown actor to me. He does a nice job of playing an emotionally disturbed teenager and the best scenes are his confrontations with the rabbit. The rabbit is played by James Duval (""Gone in sixty seconds"").In the roles of Donnies teachers among other we can see Noah Wyle (""E.R."") and Drew Barrymore and they did a good but not a memorable performances. Aslo, Patrick Swayze appears in the role of righteous self help guru.But the real strong point of the movie is it's open and undefined ending which leaves you wandering and prompts you to think about it. Not everyone will like the movie but all will at least think about the massage it tries to tell. It is intentionally made this way and the director says so in the commentary.

Unfortunately, 'Donnie Darko' is a victim of timing - the original release date was just 6 weeks after 9/11 and one of the majory plot points was eerily reminescent of another catastophe that happend immediately thereafter.From the two separate commentary tracks, you learn that Drew Barrymore ""god-mothered"" the production of this first major film by writer and director, Richard Kelly, and because the budget was a measly $4 million, the project became a true labor of love incredible cast, which includes Jena Malone, Jake Gylennhal, and his sister Maggie (who would put in a tour de force a year later with 'Secretary'), Noel Wylie, Mary O'Donnell, and Patrick Swayze.  This odd combination of one part comedy, two parts sci-fi comic, and three parts drama, which one reviewer described as David Lynch meets John Hughes, works.  The plot is refreshingly subtle, refusing to hit you over the head like its Hollywood-ized counterpart, 'Butterfly Effect', which arrived almost two years later.From the 20 revealing deleted/extended scenes, you realize that the film could have been much less secular and a better movie as a ""Director's Cut"".  Also, a physical version of 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' book (which explains much of the underlying world in this thriller) should have included in the package, as the pages on the DVD on illegible.SPOILER BEGINNING:  The writing is fantastic for a first time director, but having viewed the DVD in its entirety, I do have a problem with one of the plot points:  we know Donnie is highly intelligent and sleepwalks, but the script never really reveals Donnie's ""super powers"" (aside from the implication in the facts surrounding the trashing of the school), and as such, the fact that he is ACTING telekinetically to pull down the jet engine into the portal (as indicated by the writer/director) is completely lost on the viewer.SPOILER END.",4,Almost perfect,1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,1995,"['First', 'all', 'are', 'probably', 'wondering', 'how', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'flyed', 'so', 'long', 'radar', 'Unfortunately', 'Darko', 'victim', 'timing', 'original', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'just', '6', 'weeks', '9/11', 'one', 'majory', 'plot', 'points', 'was', 'eerily', 'reminescent', 'catastophe', 'happend', 'immediately', 'two', 'separate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'learn', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'god-mothered', 'production', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'budget', 'was', 'measly', '4', 'million', 'project', 'became', 'true', 'labor', 'love', 'incredible', 'cast', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Jake', 'Gylennhal', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'who', 'would', 'put', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'year', 'later', ""'Secretary"", 'Noel', 'Wylie', 'Mary', ""O'Donnell"", 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'odd', 'combination', 'one', 'part', 'comedy', 'two', 'parts', 'sci-fi', 'comic', 'three', 'parts', 'drama', 'one', 'reviewer', 'described', 'David', 'Lynch', 'John', 'Hughes', 'plot', 'refreshingly', 'subtle', 'refusing', 'hit', 'head', 'Hollywood-ized', 'counterpart', 'Effect', 'arrived', 'almost', 'two', 'years', '20', 'revealing', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'realize', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'less', 'secular', 'better', 'movie', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Also', 'physical', 'version', ""'The"", 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'book', 'much', 'underlying', 'world', 'thriller', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'package', 'pages', 'DVD', 'illegible.SPOILER', 'BEGINNING', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'having', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'entirety', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'one', 'plot', 'points', 'know', 'Donnie', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'sleepwalks', 'script', 'never', 'really', 'Donnie', 'super', 'powers', 'aside', 'implication', 'facts', 'surrounding', 'trashing', 'school', 'such', 'fact', 'ACTING', 'telekinetically', 'pull', 'down', 'jet', 'engine', 'portal', 'indicated', 'writer/director', 'completely', 'lost', 'viewer.SPOILER', 'END']",Donnie Darko

In a way, I compare Donnie's dream, or alternate reality, to this question:  ""Would you die for love?""It also brings about another question, ""Is it better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all?""Donnie is odd, Donnie is strange; but Donnie is a likeable kid despite his problems.  He is on medication for troubles he has had in the past, and is struggling to ""just be normal"".  He meets a girl named Gretchen, and they find their first love; and it will be a never-ending love.  Gretchen has problems of her own, with her mother having to hide from a violent ex-husband.The movie starts with Donnie waking up in the middle of the street, in the hills above his home.  He brushes himself off and heads home only to discover that a plane engine fell out of the sky from nowhere and struck his room.  If Donnie did not suffer from somnambulism he would have been killed.Donnie does have friends at school, but he also has imaginary companions whom he speaks with, and as he tells his therapist, they sometimes tell him to do things.  Enter Frank, the large psycho looking bunny who tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.Basically, the movie follows Donnie for these 28 days, through school and therapy and home, bringing in some very interesting characters like Grandma Death, and of course Frank; along with great small roles by Drew Barrymore as the teacher and Patrick Swayze as the self-help guru who doesn't make any sense.  You will love the scene where Donnie attends one of his seminars.It's rather hard to do a review of this movie without giving away any key information, and I urge you not to read any review that offers spoilers.  This is a movie that should be watched without knowing, so that all the emotions it provokes come from inside you and not some reviewer or friend.The ending is very surprising, and left me with a question that will not spoil the movie for you;  did Donnie make the choice, or was the choice made for him?Your view of this movie will definitely be your very own, but I can guarantee that whether you love it or hate it, you will not walk away unscathed.It is both dark and enlightening, surreal and yet realistic, and definitely thought provoking.

That's a plus in my book.  Nowadays originality is very scarce in Hollywood.Secondly, this movie is seriously (and consciously) weird.  That's not necessarily good or bad, but it definitely helps with the cult status.Without retelling the story, I'd just say that it was generally satisfying.  It's hard to catagorize, but, as the name implies, it's a sort of modern film noir - with a little science fiction & horror mixed in.  It was very unpredictable, but things came together at the end - sort of.There are a few flaws.  I was mystified that Drew Barrymore was so badly miscast for the part of an intellectual teacher until I saw that she was an ""executive producer.""  Money talks.Another problem, common among ambitious, unusual films, is that the part of the movie that takes place in the ""normal"" world wasn't very believable.  The dialog, especially between family members, didn't seem realistic.  Nobody seems to mind or hardly notice that Donnie is tremendously strange - he has lots of pals and gets a girlfriend without hardly trying.  Donnie and his buddies go to what appears to be a privileged private school, but, then, it doesn't.  The school bullies seem waaay over-the-top, especially considering the well-to-do suburban environment.  I could go on...But, despite the flaws, this movie keeps you interested.  While the viewer is at first presented with the old question of how much of what happens in the film is real or just in the protagonist's mind, it goes well beyond that before it's done.

Genre entertainment doesn't get better than this!Donnie Darko is a very disturbed boy. He seems depressed, quite lost in his own life. Things happen around him, things he cannot explain, things he has no control over. His life just doesn't seem to make any sense. So when a very tragic incident occurs in his neighbourhood, his life will be changed forever.The plot is so twisted, the story line so messed up that it's impossible to explain what the film is about in just a few words. What I can say is that Donnie Darko offers one of the best story's I've seen on the screen in a very long time. Great performances, a great supporting cast and a great storyline makes this one a winner in my book.Now, with the new director's cut, we're offered more of this cult classic. Scenes are added and a new soundtrack, the one the director first wanted before money became an issue in postproduction, only inhence the great experience that Donnie Darko offers its viewers.This is one movie any film lover should see. Donnie Darko will amaze you, will leave you breathless, and will make you want to see this one again. I've seen it six or seven times already, and I just can't wait to see it again.

Part satirical social commentary, part psychological thriller, part time travel sci-fi movie, and part horror flick; like David Lynch masterpieces, it probably requires several viewings to uncover the many rich layers.But that's the genre-defying beauty of Donnie Darko. It springs effortlessly across themes to create a gorgeously ominous atmosphere. The screenplay flirts with perceptions to inspire a dreamy curiosity without actually explaining the twisted universe of time travel that drives a teenager to the film&#8217;s startling climax.Sure, like any other work of art, it has its issues. There are bits that are simply impossible to make sense of. For instance, a scene with a couple of men and Drew Barrymore, where they abruptly say ""Donnie Darko"" and then giggle. What was that about?One could also say that the movie trips a little in the last quarter by tossing some random stylish punches in an effort to keep the audience interested. The result is somewhat confusing if not inconsistent. Who was Frank really? We are led to believe that he was a figment of imagination, but as it turns out, he was a real character. I am still trying to work this one out.Regardless, whatever it is, whatever it resolves to and ""means"", I highly recommend this mosaic for its dynamics rather than its ""story"".

687334,A2AN988COWP49T,B00005V3Z4,Shiragami Hiromi,"[5, 10]","The way I came across this film was so coincidental, or,  gsynchronistic h, if I may say as a self-assigned Jungian. It was just when I finished to watch the film:  gA Beautiful Mind h on DVD and was deeply moved by the extraordinary life with schizophrenia of the Nobel Award winning mathematician John Nash when my 15 year old daughter came in and said that she had just watched  gDonnie Darko h with her friends and she thought I should watch the film. Actually, although I knew the scary looking rabbit face on the jacket of the DVD, I knew nothing else about  gDonnie Darko h and it was just because I found the DVD on sale in a shop on the very next day, and the whole cast seemed promising to me, I bought it not knowing how great the magnitude the film would give me.I recognised Jake Gyllenhaal fs face just because a week ago I just saw the film  gThe Day After Tomorrow h and I liked his performance. Then I was totally stunned by the back ground music  gKilling Moon h by Echo and the Bunnymen, who were my heroes in  gOctober 1988 h, the very emotional period when I got married to the man who had introduced the band to me and is the father of above-mentioned daughter who was in my tummy at that time sharing my body fluid.I watched through the film with awesome and yet strangely familiar feelings towards Donnie Darko. Actually, his character, his being, the events happened to him, the whole thing in the film, was not strange to me at all. The film was like isotonic to my body fluid. It completely absolved me. I watched the whole film three times without break. I couldn ft help immersing myself in the film. I had become Donnie Darko.Although I have never been under medication, I knew what is like being  gborderline schizophrenic h because I, too, used to see and hear things in my adolescent years like Donnie Darko does. I had an  gimaginary h friend who was absolutely real to me and always said what I thought the truth. Truth about the nature of human being. About the life and the  gsupreme being h. I still cannot figure out if he was real, or just very realistic  gdaydream h, or product of schizophrenia.Like Donnie Darko met the book  gPhilosophy of Time Travel h, coincidentally or  gsynchronistically h, in the mid 70 fs, when I was a  gtroubled h adolescent, I met the books of Philip K. Dick like  gA Scanner Darkly h,  gMartian Time-Slip h and the  gValis h trilogy in early 80 fs and so on, to which in my personal view  gDonnie Darko h echoes immensely.Philip K. Dick, who was famously in suffering from mental illness himself until his untimely dearth in mid 80 fs, once wrote (though I cannot recall his exact words):  gGod changes the appearances of surroundings and the environment of yours so that it looks the time has past. h  I don ft think the  gtheory h should be proved mathematically, but I know it tells the truth. (O.K., I accept if you think that that is precisely because I am schizophrenic.)Anyway, through every story he wrote, I thought I got the message; the true nature of the faith is very similar to the form of insanity. In other words, you never be able to tell if a man telling you truth about God fs message or he is just purely insane. You have to know, however, your pure  gfaith h (to anything) can be used by both God (or, just say  ggood force h) and the Devil (or, again, just say  gevil force h), so you got to be careful. Look at the fascist like behaviour of Mrs Kitty Farmer, an advocate of the  gOvercome-the-Fear h cult of Jim Cunningham,  gcaricaturisticly h played by Patrick Swayze.The fear of apocalypse Donnie Darko (and I guess everybody) has is to fear of unknown. If you don ft know what happened when you die, the death can be unbearably horrific event. Donnie didn ft know what  gFrank h is telling him was actually a gospel to him, to save the life of the girl he deeply and truly loves and to save his own soul from succumbing to the fear. So, in the end (or the beginning), Donnie smiles contentedly because he now knows everything he should know as a human being. (I don ft say that he knows  geverything h like the God does. No one should, nor have to, I think.) You never know if Donnie fs Mum and little sister will still be on the plane ""again"", but at least he should have changed the course of lives of some people he related / would have related in the  gfuture h for good. I have heard that in the Bible it is said that when an apocalypse comes the God transfers his selection of people to the new world that exactly looks like the old one so the people never know they have been actually  gsaved h. But to some people a tiny fragment of the event remain in their memory like a dream you cannot recall. The fragments of what Donnie has done to the people  gin the future h are scattered onto the people fs unconscious memory like fairy dust.I think that thought is beautiful. It makes this film poignant and yet, somehow, soothing on each view.",5,The Rapture,1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,4946,"['way', 'came', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'coincidental', 'gsynchronistic', 'h',

It's the kind of film that raises as many questions as it answers, and NOT in a frustrating way.

And the marketing, I never heard of the darn thing.  One of the deleted scenes on the DVD I felt should have been included in the movie. Since Donnie's hallucinations are increasing in severity and frequency, his shrink doubles his dosage. The scene left out is where the shrink tells Donnie he's been taking placebo's all along! That would have freaked me out, and I'm sorry the director chose to delete that scene.

And he gets Jena Malone in Donnie darko.The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is a 2+ hour episode of The Twilight Zone. It deals in time travel, the butterfly effect, and the whole ""what would happen if certain events in the past didn't happen or were changed"" thing.And apparently the formula works. At the time of this writing the average Amazon rating is 4+ stars with almost 1000 reviews to back it up. Wow.Well, I say, what we have here is a good movie with a loyal following. Hence, Donnie Darko, for whatever reason, has become somewhat of a Cult Classic. But a 5 star film??? No. You have GOT to have Rabbititis to think that THIS is a 5 star film.Donnie Darko is an interesting movie. Its Director Richard Kelly has a very short resume, so kudos to him for creating such a buzz around such a mediocre psychological adventure.A lot of the situations are real and fun to watch. But the time travel part is the real point of the movie, which is bizarre and not easy to follow even if you are paying attention.So, if after all that you are as I was inclined to give Donnie Darko a try based on the raves...rent it as I did.

687341,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00005V3Z4,Steffan Piper,"[3, 4]","This film could possibly go down as the greatest film on teenage detachment ever made. If Hollywood could ever get their act together and make an adaptation ofThe Catcher in the Rye, we might actually have another contender, but as it stands currently, and barring all the false starts and problems the aforementioned project seems to be cursed by, Donnie Darko may just be the last word. At best, this really is a genre splitting debut feature about time travel, alternate dimensions, Castanedian Philosophy and even an introspection into the true nature and place of those would-be personalities, the Smurfs. At worst, it's the greatest contribution the Emo sub-culture to date, out-stripping The Cure.I've seen this movie a few hundred times now, and if you knew me you'd probably understand that it's not that strange of a boast at all for me to say it. I currently own three different versions of this and have sifted the contents and commentaries of all of them. The Original Theatrical Release, The Director's Cut (White Box) and the Region 2, UK Release (Black Box with hologram). So far, my favorite is the Original Theatrical release and for the following reasons.1. Richard Kelly tells the viewer in both versions of the Director's Commentary that he could never get clearance or the money for the songs he wanted to do the film with originally and was `forced' to change some of the music after he toured the film with festival rights. Well ... in all honestly, it was probably for the better that he didn't have the money. I can't bear to watch the film start with the alternate music. Echo and The Bunnymen's `The Killing Moon' is a perfect and very haunting opus-like opening to the film that should have never been messed with in retrospect, regardless of whatever came before it. Tampering with it in such a way is like taking `As time goes by' out of Casablanca, which Michael Curtiz and Jack Warner would've done had Ingrid Bergman not cut her hair and been unavailable to do reshoots and pick-ups.2. The fireworks at the end is superfluous and a bad choice of visual effects to have man-handled inappropriately into the film. It comes off as a thuggish way to treat the original, without doubt. The eyeball visual and the ocean waves are interesting and seem to fit the tone, but anything after that is just grasping at amateur theatrics.3. While I do appreciate the additional scenes and the on-screen text of `The Philosophy of Time Travel', it does add to the film, but with the other two mentioned points and the shifting of key music, it negates whatever is gained by the on-screen text.I remember when Donnie Darko was released and was being advertised with the ad campaign posters all over Hollywood. They were able to secure the large billboard on the corner of Fairfax and Hollywood Blvd and I remember thinking: `Wow, what an odd looking poster. What the hell is that all about?"" But I never saw a trailer once.The ad campaign this film received was atrocious to say the least and it was no fault at all of the filmmakers or flower films, but a direct failure of 20th Century Fox executives who didn't really know what to do with this, even though teen horror was the biggest grossing money-makers in the business at the time. All they needed to do was just advertise it and let the masses decide to go see it. Typically though, almost every modern classic has been panned or mishandled and sometimes this just adds to the beauty and the lore that follows the film ever after.Unfortunately, the film hit theatres in limited release (LA, NY) just a week and half before 9-11, and much like David Fincher'sThe Game, which was sunk by the death of Princess Diana, Donnie Darko suffered an equal fate and quietly slipped out of theatres robbing Kelly of the immediate notoriety he should have garnered and does deserve. To be fair though, Kelly does have a pretty unstable reputation as a filmmaker and a Howard Hughes alaHell's Angelstype of aura regarding his movies.Southland Talestook much longer for Kelly to get out and into theatres than was ever needed, and he pretty much spent the 00's working on one film, where his peers put out 3,4 and 5 films, even with Tony Scott taking him under his wing. Work ethic is probably not the problem, but writing and post-production tinkering seems to be his Achilles heel.Donnie Darko will surely be remembered as his masterpiece. For several years the film had successfully supplanted and pushed out midnight viewings ofThe Rocky Horror Picture Showand their antic driven followers, for the much more morose Donnie Darko and the coffee-clatching style of discussion that often followed afterwards. Having attended both of those in my life, I do not elevate one over the other but enjoyed both equally.Everything about the Theatrical Release of Donnie Darko is pure magic and the stuff of great filmmaking. Kelly's writing here leaves just enough for the viewers imagination without spoon-feeding and raises enough questions to cause a prolonged dilemma.... ...",5,Holden Caulfield called and he wants his

As does Jake Gyllenhaal, turning in a wonderfully unnerving performance as the troubled Donnie, his innocent looks making his behaviour even more chilling.  This is clearly a low-budget film, but for many audiences the grubby sound mix, poor lighting and (in places) very clunky writing will all be part of the charm.

Getting the DVD has revealed alot...and also opened up a whole other world if you will. I'm not one to understand what Universe the film is in at any given moment, or try to decipher how time travel works. I can only fathom that the movie is smart, bratty, and for the most part brutally honest about high school life (or whatever Middlesex is), Jr. High etc...and the variety of students you would encounter.Donnie is the independent one, who is smart enough to challange the norm, and stand up for what he believes...I think I understand why intelligent people are so angry and sometimes misunderstood, they see the world for what it is, they understand what is really going on around them, and they are really angry about it.

It tries to be profound and thought-provoking but only winds up being maddening and pointless.High school student Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is having strange visions.  He is taking medication and seeing a therapist but still cannot shake his problem.  Is the man in the rabbit suit that he constantly sees really there or just a figment of his imagination?  Is the fabric of the universe really unraveling before his very eyes?  And is the world really going to end in twenty-eight days, six hours, forty-two minutes, and twelve seconds?""Donnie Darko"" strives to be intriguing but winds up just being plain weird.  It appears at the outset to be a tantalizing metaphysical mystery but it ultimately reveals itself to be a tale full of nonsense and dead-ends.  The only aspect of the film that comes off as being a positive is the strong acting.  Gyllenhaal does a great job conveying the confusion and conviction of his character while the supporting cast of Mary McDonnell, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Patrick Swayze, and Katherine Ross all turn in yeoman work.  Yet when ""Donnie Darko"" ends, you are left with the feeling that it should have been something much more than the spectacular failure that it is.

687350,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00005V3Z4,Takis Tz.,"[1, 1]","Possibly one of the most original alternative films I've seen in the past years, Donnie Darko is a powerful mind stimulator.A brilliant deep-cutting script combined with intimidating acting and careful directing is what you get here but the more thoughtful viewers will also be awarded with valuable and out of the mainstream questions.A young teen diagnosed with bordeline schizophrenia starts having weird meetings with a human size rabbit who looks part alien, part reptile, part artificial, and who carries a message of doom for Donnie Darko (the boy, and yes, that's his name)..Donnie begins to take the message very seriously but simoultaneously he begins paying attention to the world around him and in him. He understands with the help of his ""friend"" that nothing you see and observe is accidental.Predictably, he comes at odds with the people he tries to convey this message to (""the world will end in 28 days""), he discovers that most people out there live on the surface of reality and not only they wouldnt dare take a dive underneath but wouldnt even consider there's something constantly eluding their awareness. Probably because their awareness is, hmm, defective?Donnie Darko, inspired by his visions ( or his deeper glimpse of reality) begins a personal trek of questioning, redifining and re-interpeting. The strange ""Grandma of Death"" (an old woman who years ago had written a book about time travel and spends her time ever since waiting for a ""message"" herself) becomes a focal point for Donnie. But Donnie tries also to squeeze as much information about the puzzle of reality from other people around him, most notably certain teachers, he attempts to piece things together and bond all these realities that appear before his eyes and mind together.The film is, as others have noted too, incredibly hard to classify. Viewers with a particular liking in the ""alternative"" will adore it as it encompasses loads of hints and direct references not only to time travel, but to parallel universes, telepathy and astral projection to mention but a few. But if the ""paranormal"" spooks you it has strong dosages of the ""normal"" reality most people experience too even if that is portrayed as a dull and depressing one. Which is yet another asset of the movie: it is as frank and honest as it gets.The young actor who plays Donnie Darko is utterly convincing allthough he has his show stolen by his mother who adds the necessary down-to-earthness to it all with her refreshing performance. But there is no actor involved in this film who goes unnoticed and I'd have to think hard to find a parallel in that respect.Lastly, this is an emotional rollercoaster of a film, it goes from scary to sad to funny and thought provoking to intimidating and back to melancholy in an stunningly effortless way (kudos to the script writer).An absolute must-see.",5,"...""we all die alone""....",1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,2860,"['Possibly', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'alternative', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'years', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'powerful', 'mind', 'stimulator.A', 'brilliant', 'deep-cutting', 'script', 'combined', 'intimidating', 'acting', 'careful', 'directing', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'viewers', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'awarded', 'valuable', 'mainstream', 'questions.A', 'young', 'teen', 'diagnosed', 'bordeline', 'schizophrenia', 'having', 'weird', 'meetings', 'human', 'size', 'rabbit', 'who', 'part', 'alien', 'part', 'reptile', 'part', 'artificial', 'who', 'message', 'doom', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'boy', 'yes', 'name', '..Donnie', 'take', 'message', 'very', 'seriously', 'simoultaneously', 'paying', 'attention', 'world', 'help', 'friend', 'nothing', 'see', 'observe', 'accidental.Predictably', 'odds', 'people', 'convey', 'message', 'world', 'will', 'end', '28', 'days', 'most', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'live', 'surface', 'reality', 'not', 'only', 'wouldnt', 'dare', 'take', 'dive', 'underneath', 'wouldnt', 'even', 'consider', 'something', 'constantly', 'eluding', 'awareness', 'Probably', 'awareness', 'hmm', 'defective', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'inspired', 'visions', 'deeper', 'glimpse', 'reality', 'personal', 'trek', 'questioning', 'redifining', 're-interpeting', 'strange', 'Grandma', 'Death', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'written', 'book', 'time', 'travel', 'time', 'ever', 'waiting', 'message', 'focal', 'point', 'Donnie', 'Donnie', 'tries', 'also', 'squeeze', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'puzzle', 'reality', 'other', 'people', 'most', 'notably', 'certain', 'teachers', 'piece', 'things', 'together', 'bond', 'realities', 'appear', 'eyes', 'mind', 'together.The', 'film', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'too', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'classify', 'Viewers', 'particular', 'liking', 'alternative', 'will', 'adore', 'loads', 'hints', 'direct', 'references', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'travel', 'parallel', 'universes', 'telepathy', 'astral', 'projection', 'mention', 'few', 'paranormal', 'strong', 'dosages', 'normal', 'reality', 'most', 'people', 'experience', 'too', 'even', 'portrayed', 'dull', 'depressing', 'one', 'yet', 'asset', 'movie', 'frank', 'honest', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'allthough', 'show', 'stolen', 'mother', 'who', 'necessary', 'down-to-earthness', 'refreshing', 'performance', 'actor', 'involved', 'film', 'who', 'unnoticed', ""'d"", 'have', 'think', 'hard', 'find', 'parallel', 'respect.Lastly', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'film', 'scary', 'sad', 'funny', 'thought', 'provoking', 'intimidating', 'back', 'melancholy', 'stunningly', 'effortless', 'way', 'kudos', 'script', 'writer', 'absolute', 'must-see']",Donnie Darko

I couldn't get to sleep though - mostly because the TV was so loud - but also, I thought the movie was fairly interesting.When I saw this movie available EVERYWHERE in London I couldn't resist buying it, and I got it for a slim price.  (I lucked out because everything else there is expensive as heck.)  I was disappointed to see that it wouldn't play on my Playstation 2 since it was a UK disc.  Fortunately, after some slight modifications, I could still watch it on the DVD player I had on my computer.The first thing I noticed was that this movie had a lot more cussing in it than I remember.  I also noticed that it didn't show my favorite character Frank all that much.  Still, I think this movie is a great thing to see.  It's about a kid in high school with severe mental problems, so it's not very unusual.  This kid's name is Donnie Darko.Donnie has hallucinations and personality disorders and darn near every mental disorder a person can have.  He goes to a shrink and takes lots of meds.  Does this help?  Of course not, why would anyone expect it to?  I'm sure it costs the parents a lot of money, but they seem more concerned for their wacko son than for saving up some dough.Well, Donnie has this imaginary friend named Frank that tells him when the world is going to end; 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.  Frank isn't a a Kool-Aid drinker though, he's just a guy in a bunny rabbit skull costume that looks really boss and evil.So Donnie goes through school and cusses out teachers and picks up this gothic-type chick.  Naturally he doesn't get expelled or anything.  Under the influence of Frank, Donnie develops an interest in time travel and studies it.  His main book of reference is written by a weird old lady who does nothing but check a mailbox all day.  She must have been looking for a check or something.In a short subplot, Donnie burns down the home of a child pornography peddler.  This happens right after my favorite scene in the movie where Frank takes off his mask.  The Frank unmasking scene is spooky, with really dark classical music playing in the background.  I love it.  Frank turns out to be pretty darn ugly.The film has an excellent soundtrack including one of my favorite songs, ""Head Over Heels.""  The cinematography can't be any better.  It's very dark throughout but not so dark that you can't see.  Even when it's bright daylight outside, the movie manages to keep its dark feeling.The movie is kind of written like a Star Trek episode with all of the time traveling business.  I'm not sure if it's 100% consistent, but with a vague and complicated subject like time travel, you can get away with inconsistency, since time travel is so darn neat.If you're into weird stuff, you need to see this movie.  It's got a lot of imagination put into it, and I think everybody can appreciate that.",5,There Needs to be More Skull-Rabbits,1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2005,2981,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'friends', 'house', 'tried', 'sleep', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sleep', 'night', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'sleep', 'mostly', 'TV', 'was', 'so', 'loud', 'also', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'interesting.When', 'saw', 'movie', 'available', 'EVERYWHERE', 'London', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'buying', 'got', 'slim', 'price', 'lucked', 'out', 'everything', 'else', 'expensive', 'heck', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'Playstation', '2', 'was', 'UK', 'disc', 'Fortunately', 'slight', 'modifications', 'could', 'still', 'watch', 'DVD', 'player', 'had', 'computer.The', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'cussing', 'remember', 'also', 'noticed', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'favorite', 'character', 'Frank', 'that', 'much', 'Still', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'thing', 'see', 'kid', 'high', 'school', 'severe', 'mental', 'problems', 'not', 'very', 'unusual', 'kid', 'name', 'Donnie', 'Darko.Donnie', 'hallucinations', 'personality', 'disorders', 'darn', 'mental', 'disorder', 'person', 'can', 'have', 'shrink', 'lots', 'meds', 'help', 'course', 'not', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'expect', ""'m"", 'sure', 'parents', 'lot', 'money', 'seem', 'more', 'concerned', 'wacko', 'son', 'saving', 'up', 'dough.Well', 'Donnie', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Frank', 'when', 'world', 'going', 'end', '28', 'days', '6', 'hours', '42', 'minutes', '12', 'seconds', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'Kool-Aid', 'drinker', 'just', 'guy', 'bunny', 'rabbit', 'skull', 'costume', 'really', 'boss', 'evil.So', 'Donnie', 'school', 'out', 'teachers', 'up', 'gothic-type', 'chick', 'Naturally', ""n't"", 'get', 'expelled', 'anything', 'influence', 'Frank', 'Donnie', 'interest', 'time', 'travel', 'studies', 'main', 'book', 'reference', 'written', 'weird', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'nothing', 'check', 'mailbox', 'day', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'check', 'something.In', 'short', 'subplot', 'Donnie', 'down', 'home', 'child', 'pornography', 'peddler', 'right', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'Frank', 'mask', 'Frank', 'unmasking', 'scene', 'spooky', 'really', 'dark', 'classical', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'love', 'Frank', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'darn', 'ugly.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs', 'Head', 'Heels', 'cinematography', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'very', 'dark', 'not', 'so', 'dark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Even', 'when', 'bright', 'daylight', 'movie', 'keep', 'dark', 'feeling.The', 'movie', 'kind', 'written', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'time', 'traveling', 'business', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', '100', '%', 'consistent', 'vague', 'complicated', 'subject', 'time', 'travel', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'inconsistency', 'time', 'travel', 'so', 'darn', 'neat.If', ""'re"", 'weird', 'stuff', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'imagination', 'put', 'think', 'everybody', 'can', 'appreciate']",Donnie Darko

It had to come from somewhere.This inexplicable occurrence is the basis for Donnie's increasingly complex & disturbing visions of mass destruction.In a quest for understanding, Donnie converses with his therapist, questions the science teacher, listens to Joy Division, & celebrates halloween.All of these activities contribute to Donnie's potential grasp on the very complex structure of time and space.Donnie reads The Philosophy of Time Travel, written by Roberta Sparrow, in an attempt to figure this puzzle out.The searching leads Donnie further down the rabbit hole. What does it all mean?Yes, there are a number of questions. Some are answerable and some, not so much.Donnie Darko's ability to transcend cultural eras could be considered time travel in it's own right.It will take you back, then back further, and then possibly forward.Overall, a fun thoughtful mental expedition.As with all great adventures, it's about the journey and not necessarily the destination.If you appreciate cult films, Darko is required viewing.""A wrecking ball smashes into the tall building, and a few floors collapse into the big hole. Hours later, the office building has been reduced to a pile of rubble, and a job has been well done.

Donnie Darko is a troubled 15 year old who thinks life is absurd and meaningless because, in the end, everyone dies alone.Set in the Fall of 1988, the movie is about personal transformation and how through your own personal transformation you can change the world.  The 1988 Presidential election serves as a handy backdrop for the despair caused by alienation and apathy.  The country has emerged from 8 years of conservatism under Ronald Reagan and has a choice to make.  This larger sense of place echoes within the community, where conservative values are prominent and people fear change.  The only kind of ""change"" people accept comes from the self-help guru who spouts shallow epithets; whereas real works about transformation and change are shunned and called ""pornographic,"" such as Graham Greene's short story which says, in part: ""It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his fifteenth year crystallised  with the pain of puberty.""This could not be a better description of the angst of adolescence and of Donnie Darko himself, now in his 15th year, who is searching for the ""plan"" he needs to accept the yin and yang of existence:  that destruction and creation work together to create change.Donnie is the only student in the class who understands the Greene story.  When called upon by his teacher he says the story is saying that ""destruction is a form of creation.  So the fact that they burn the money is..,.ironic.  They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.""But how does one find transformation in a world that seems to offer only diminished possibilities?  In a world that believes acquisition leads to happiness?  What Donnie ultimately discovers--which is why he laughs and smiles at the end of the movie--is that meaning is found through your creative engagement with life and through the mark you leave on the world.The song ""Mad World"" truly encapsulates the thematic concerns of the movie beautifully.

687359,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B00005V3Z4,The Wingchair Critic,"[7, 9]","'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' (2005) offers audiences a restructured vision of the extraordinary 2001 Richard Kelly film, which stands with 'Haxan' (1922), 'Freaks' (1932), 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), 'Beauty And The Beast' (1947), 'Curse of the Demon' (1958), 'Eyes Without A Face' (1960), 'The Innocents' (1961), 'Carnival of Souls' (1962), 'The Birds' (1963), 'Blue Velvet' (1985), and 'Faust' (1994) as one of the greatest fantastic films ever created.Sadly, the revision, however more closely it may dovetail with Kelly's personal vision, considerably dilutes the film's drama and power on almost every level.While the theatrical release was fueled by its own judicious editing, structural hard edges, glorious ambiguities, and evocation of the suburban weird, the so-called director's cut continually literalizes the plot while simultaneously altering the status of essential story elements.In a grave error of judgement, the daimonic rabbit Frank, a dominant presence in and the very symbol of the theatrical release, is now overshadowed by Roberta Sparrow's previously obscure book, The Philosophy of Time Travel, which is brazenly promoted into the foreground. Additional superfluous scenes of the Darko family interacting (which were wisely included as outtakes only in the original DVD) undercut the film' pivotal forward momentum, while the deletion of some of the mean-spirited dialogue Donnie's peers direct towards one another weakens the satiric and parodic humor of the original.Key characters, like the free thinking, anti-establishment teacher beautifully portrayed by Drew Barrymore, now seem to have briefly wandered in from another film entirely.Awash in new CGI effects, the director's cut should make more logical sense, but simply does not. The film's last ten minutes, in which everything that has gone before coalesces into terrible meaning, should have been considered sacrosanct and left unaltered.As a result of these changes and others, a clever, multi-faceted, fairly original, and genuinely tragic film has become a muddy, unfocused, and protracted exercise in the unthreatening and the banal.So in a reversal of several well-documented Orson Welles projects, including 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942), and the plot of Woody Allen's 'Stardust Memories' (1980), 'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' is a concrete example in which the much-maligned Hollywood executive machine has actually strengthened a creative work through forcible tampering.For the film's reputation to continue to flourish, it is essential that the theatrical version remain in circulation; the obvious choice here would have been to include the mediocre director's cut in addition to the theatrical release.Bonus ""special features,"" such as ""They Made Me Do It--The Cult of Donnie Darko"" and ""Number One Fan--A Darkomentary,"" are third rate, futile studies in self-applause and package padding which further embarrass the project as a whole.",2,Darkness Brightly Packaged,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2957,"['Darko', 'Director', 'Cut', '2005', 'audiences', 'restructured', 'vision', 'extraordinary', '2001', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'film', ""'Haxan"", '1922', '1932', 'Walked', 'A', 'Zombie', '1942', 'Beast', '1947', ""'Curse"", 'Demon', '1958', 'Face', '1960', 'Innocents', '1961', ""'Carnival"", 'Souls', '1962', 'Birds', '1963', 'Velvet', '1985', '1994', 'one', 'greatest', 'fantastic', 'films', 'ever', 'created.Sadly', 'revision', 'however', 'more', 'closely', 'may', 'dovetail', 'Kelly', 'personal', 'vision', 'considerably', 'film', 'drama', 'power', 'almost', 'level.While', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'fueled', 'own', 'judicious', 'editing', 'structural', 'hard', 'edges', 'glorious', 'ambiguities', 'evocation', 'suburban', 'weird', 'so-called', 'director', 'cut', 'continually', 'plot', 'simultaneously', 'altering', 'status', 'essential', 'story', 'grave', 'error', 'judgement', 'daimonic', 'rabbit', 'Frank', 'dominant', 'presence', 'very', 'symbol', 'theatrical', 'release', 'now', 'overshadowed', 'Roberta', 'Sparrow', 'previously', 'obscure', 'book', 'Philosophy', 'Time', 'Travel', 'brazenly', 'promoted', 'foreground', 'Additional', 'superfluous', 'scenes', 'Darko', 'family', 'interacting', 'were', 'wisely', 'included', 'outtakes', 'only', 'original', 'DVD', 'undercut', 'film', 'pivotal', 'forward', 'momentum', 'deletion', 'mean-spirited', 'dialogue', 'Donnie', 'peers', 'direct', 'one', 'satiric', 'parodic', 'humor', 'original.Key', 'characters', 'free', 'thinking', 'anti-establishment', 'teacher', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'now', 'seem', 'have', 'briefly', 'wandered', 'film', 'entirely.Awash', 'new', 'CGI', 'effects', 'director', 'cut', 'should', 'make', 'more', 'logical', 'sense', 'simply', 'not', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'everything', 'gone', 'before', 'coalesces', 'terrible', 'meaning', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'sacrosanct', 'left', 'unaltered.As', 'result', 'changes', 'others', 'clever', 'multi-faceted', 'fairly', 'original', 'genuinely', 'tragic', 'film', 'become', 'muddy', 'unfocused', 'protracted', 'exercise', 'unthreatening', 'banal.So', 'reversal', 'several', 'well-documented', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'projects', 'including', ""'The"", 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', '1942', 'plot', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""'Stardust"", 'Memories', '1980', 'Darko', 'Director', 'Cut', 'concrete', 'example', 'much-maligned', 'Hollywood', 'executive', 'machine', 'actually', 'strengthened', 'creative', 'work', 'forcible', 'tampering.For', 'film', 'reputation', 'continue', 'flourish', 'essential', 'theatrical', 'version', 'remain', 'circulation', 'obvious', 'choice', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'include', 'mediocre', 'director', 'cut', 'addition', 'theatrical', 'release.Bonus', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'Made', 'Me', 'Do', 'Cult', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Number', 'One', 'Fan', 'Darkomentary', 'are', 'third', 'rate', 'futile', 'studies', 'self-applause', 'package', 'padding', 'further', 'embarrass', 'project', 'whole']",Donnie Darko

687362,AWJKA0TRZLZGS,B00005V3Z4,Thomas Bailey,"[0, 0]","Theatrical trailer: ""The Only way to unwind the future is to follow the path."" -- The path of a 'border-line, adolescent, sleep-walking schizophrenic' named Donnie Darko living in a parallel universe -- or is it a total delusion? -- guided by the six-foot rabbit Frank. -- Frank who turns out to be much more than just the strangeness he appears to be: Something (his energy, essence, vibrations, importance) the other characters in the movie tune into without totally understanding the entire gestalt; plus: It is difficult to see, but it seems that all of these characters are a part of the whole: Many mentors guiding Donnie along the path, and psychotic-appearing acts that he commits with reasons that seem to be connected with setting things right, to rescue: Donnie Darko -- the chosen one, the savior of the world.When I first watched this movie, I found myself caught in between liking and hating it. I loved the character Donnie Darko: Although he was suppose to be mentally disturbed, I found him to be very perceptive, witty, intelligent, and one of the most sane people in the entire movie, challenging those who failed to see things the way they really are -- which causes him to be trapped in extremely-painful isolation. I loved many of the other characters as well: His girlfriend, his two sisters, his father and mother and many others, the teacher Drew Barrymore plays, Patrick Swayze's character, and the old woman who keeps walking back and forth to the mailbox to check for mail that is never there, almost getting hit by cars passing by -- although I found myself very disappointed, at first, that as strong a part as she seemed to play, she wasn't explained or used as fully as I hoped for; I found myself thinking of the movie 'Somewhere in Time', where Christopher Reeve -- playing a playwright in the 1980's -- is approached by an old woman --played by Jane Seymour -- who pleads for him to come back in time to her in the world of 1912 where she lives; but nothing like that appears to happen.I only found myself wading through a very slow movie that tempted me-several times-to jump to the end to find out where all of this was leading, but I avoided the temptation, watching with irritation with the slow pace, and fascination for the eerie use of sound and special effects drawing me deeper in...until...I got to the end, and everything was suppose to wrap up neatly ...but it didn't: ""Oh, yuck!"" I found myself vocalizing to an almost empty room, except for me.But after watching the commentary with the writer/director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie, and the deleted and extended scenes, it made more sense to me, and the old woman fit more into what I hoped for -- although very subtly -- and the ending was more satisfying, and some of my impressions were confirmed.And now I can say I like the movie. -- But even more so: The DVD as a whole; DVD is the way to go with this one; not VHS, for you need the deleted and extended scenes -- which the director cut because he needed to make a two and one half hour movie into a two hour one -- and the commentary to best understand and appreciate the movie, an understanding and appreciation you will not get by the VHS alone: You can either buy the movie so you can have time to go through at least once, watch all of the twenty scenes (with commentary and without), watch -- especially -- all the way through with the director's commentary, the commentary with the cast (if you so choose, but not necessary, for there is very little information that isn't all ready covered by the director in a much more straightforward manner), and check out the other features as well; or, if you would rather avoid the expense, you can rent it (all by itself) at a place that allows you to have it for five days, and: ENJOY!",4,"I LIKED IT, I HATED IT, I RECOMMEND IT",1033776000,"10 5, 2002",2002,3813,"['Theatrical', 'trailer', 'Only', 'way', 'unwind', 'future', 'follow', 'path', 'path', ""'border-line"", 'adolescent', 'sleep-walking', 'schizophrenic', 'named', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'living', 'parallel', 'universe', 'total', 'delusion', 'guided', 'six-foot', 'rabbit', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'strangeness', 'be', 'Something', 'energy', 'essence', 'vibrations', 'importance', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'tune', 'totally', 'understanding', 'entire', 'gestalt', 'difficult', 'see', 'characters', 'are', 'part', 'whole', 'Many', 'mentors', 'guiding', 'Donnie', 'path', 'psychotic-appearing', 'acts', 'reasons', 'seem', 'be', 'connected', 'setting', 'things', 'right', 'rescue', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'chosen', 'one', 'savior', 'world.When', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'found', 'caught', 'liking', 'hating', 'loved', 'character', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'perceptive', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'one', 'most', 'sane', 'people', 'entire', 'movie', 'challenging', 'who', 'failed', 'see', 'things', 'way', 'really', 'are', 'be', 'trapped', 'extremely-painful', 'isolation', 'loved', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'sisters', 'father', 'mother', 'many', 'others', 'teacher', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'plays', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'character', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'walking', 'back', 'forth', 'mailbox', 'check', 'mail', 'never', 'there', 'almost', 'getting', 'hit', 'cars', 'passing', 'found', 'very', 'disappointed', 'first', 'strong', 'part', 'seemed', 'play', 'was', ""n't"", 'explained', 'used', 'as', 'fully', 'hoped', 'found', 'thinking', 'movie', ""'Somewhere"", 'Time', 'where', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'playing', 'playwright', '1980', 'approached', 'old', 'woman', 'played', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'pleads', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'world', '1912', 'where', 'nothing', 'happen.I', 'only', 'found', 'wading', 'very', 'slow', 'movie', 'tempted', 'me-several', 'times-to', 'jump', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'was', 'leading', 'avoided', 'temptation', 'watching', 'irritation', 'slow', 'pace', 'fascination', 'eerie', 'use', 'sound', 'special', 'effects', 'drawing', 'deeper', 'got', 'end', 'everything', 'was', 'suppose', 'wrap', 'up', 'neatly', 'did', ""n't"", 'Oh', 'yuck', 'found', 'vocalizing', 'almost', 'empty', 'room', 'me.But', 'watching', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'Donnie', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'old', 'woman', 'fit', 'more', 'what', 'hoped', 'very', 'subtly', 'ending', 'was', 'more', 'satisfying', 'impressions', 'were', 'confirmed.And', 'now', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'DVD', 'whole', 'DVD', 'way', 'go', 'one', 'not', 'VHS', 'need', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'director', 'cut', 'needed', 'make', 'two', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'two', 'hour', 'one', 'commentary', 'best', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'VHS', 'alone', 'can', 'either', 'buy', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'time', 'go', 'least', 'once', 'watch', 'twenty', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'watch', 'especially', 'way', 'director', 'commentary', 'commentary', 'cast', 'so', 'choose', 'not', 'necessary', 'very', 'little', 'information', ""n't"", 'ready', 'covered', 'director', 'much', 'more', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'features', 'well', 'would', 'rather', 'avoid', 'expense', 'can', 'rent', 'place', 'have', 'five', 'days', 'ENJOY']",Donnie Darko
687363,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B00005V3Z4,Thomas Glebe,"[2, 2]","After several viewings and much thought, all I can say about this movie, in seven words or less is, ""My God, what a totally fantastic flick!""  A film, which I only finally saw (but had heard about, many years after it hit theaters and later DVD and cable).  I really cannot say how great this film is, but I'll try.  Note however, that on Amazon's rating scale from 1 star to 5, if I could, I'd give this SIX stars, but am limited to five.  For this is a work which rises above the five star Amazon rating level for me, and few films have ever done that actually.  Overall, despite some minor stumbles along the way, and many, confusing non-linear moments which occur throughout, I can seriously say this is certainly one of the most unique, touching, and mind-expanding movie efforts I've seen in a long, long time. It entered my top 20-50 films of all time quickly at the very least, when I first experienced it, and continues to move up, upon repeated screenings and reflections.  That's saying a lot because my list of such top films of all times includes dozens of great films, too many to name here.This is a small and independent but yet, GREAT movie, and is a must-buy for those with the funds and who loved/love this right off the bat as much as I did/do, because more viewings not only add to one's understanding and appreciation of it all, but will over time, as it has for me, simply add to one's thinking about it all deeply afterwards and lead to finding new meanings in various scenes and ideas/insights.  Basically. ""Donnie Darko,"" if you see it and you enjoy it upon initially watching it and re-watching it as I did (and still do), is a strange, wonderful enigma of a film, which you will come back to, for further and deeper appreciation.  With the rather obtuse at times, and certainly non-progressive temporal structure however, repeated viewings and closer attention, almost seems essential for a full appreciation of this masterpiece.  Along with so many various interpretations from viewers, if you collect DVD's, and fell in love with this film early on, as I did originally and much later on, this is really a movie you'll want to come back to and watch again, many times.  While my review does not distinguish between released DVD versions, I can only concentrate on the basic product, which in its original film, is really something special.It's hard to know where to begin to describe this absolutely amazing movie/film, which I found so surprisingly fascinating and unforgettable and great, when I first saw it, and since have, upon repeated viewings.  As a general rule, I have never written short Amazon reviews, since my main deal here has been to try to impart upon readers, more in depth thoughts on all things entertainment-wise.  I could just say, ""this is a little-known, but important, cult-ish example of what Hollywood/Independent cinema can be, and mandatory viewing for any real, thought-stimulating movie fan,"" or ""it is a complete and enlightening surprise from beginning to end,"" but I will instead just give my totally personal opinion (with a lot more words) that this is a film which everyone should see at least once.  Whether afterwards, they get the same mental digestive overdrive reactions I did when I first saw it and which has been validated by seeing it again and again, is unknown to me.  Because I loved this movie the very first time I saw it, and watching it again has only reinforced that opinion.  I would hope to believe others have experienced this gem as much as I did originally, and have found enjoyment from repeated viewings.While this film is, indeed, very non-linear. which is usually a quality which more often than not, has turned me off to so many other such movies besides notable exceptions like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Go,"" and ""11:14."" ""Donnie Darko"" is very deliberate in its intent and purpose, and its oftentimes ambiguous nature, is just one of its many charms.  If you first see it, and like/love it, you'll eventually refer others to it, if for no other reason, than for that of trying to search for other's explanations as to what it's all about, from others besides yourself.  However, if one first experiences this little jewel of a film and doesn't quite understand/appreciate it, I would advise one to simply devote the time if possible to watch it again, and again.  In time, I would trust that it will all eventually become clear, what this enigma of an independent, but Hollywood release, really means.  While some unnecessarily may want to over-interpret this, or dismiss it entirely from a possible feeling of just being too lazy to simply THINK, to me, ""Donnie Darko"" is simply amazing.  Whether watched initially, repeatedly, and/or thought about later.I came to eventually see this film long after its original release and subsequent impact, as I have so many other great movies, but in the new century,  That does not diminish its importance and meaning to me as a truly great cinematic effort in the long run, and this new century film holds up very well, with anything from the last few decades.  It is a one of a kind, at the very least, and I only wish more modern-day films came to equal this cinematic excellence.I could go on to list the many stars and their fine performances, including Jake Gyllenhaal (our teen-aged hero which this middle-aged man can still truly identify with), his sister in real life and in this movie, ""Maggie Gyllenhaal,"" Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone among others, but let it be said, this is a great cast.  And their characters all perform key roles in the overall whole.""Donnie Darko"" is one of the best films I've seen this century.  It is strange, open for debate as to meaning, but entertaining and compelling throughout.  The film style is original and effective, the soundtrack and appropriate ""songs"" right-on, and the whole film, while dealing with some rather disturbing and/or depressing subjects, is a winner from frame one to the last frame.  If you have never seen this, by all means, do.  If you have, a lot of what I've hinted about without spoilers, should touch base.An unforgettable experience, I watched this in amazement the first time, and have since, upon every repeated viewing.  One of a kind, tight, and almost perfectly presented from beginning to end, along with a near perfect cast, directorial style, and musical background, ""Donnie Darko"" is truly a must-see experience.  What it all really ""means"" in the end, is up to the viewer, which makes it forever more a total and timeless winner.",5,One of the best movies of the new millennium...,1223596800,"10 10,

Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't ""get it"" by watching the movie alone, I  say it is a failure on the film maker's part.That said, I was intrigued by it.

687374,A15H0OGLXJ9FC6,B00005V3Z4,T. R. Rak,"[5, 7]","First of all, buy this ORIGINAL 2001 release version DVD.  Forget the director's cut - it's okay, but not what you'd expect.  The director's cut suffers from what Jack White (of the seminal music band, ""The White Stripes"") meant when he said, ""Art is knowing WHEN to stop.""  The director's cut simply doesn't, and you'll see why too if (as I did) you make the mistake of shelling out the extra green to acquire it.  Take my advice:  Don't.Stick with the original.  You won't be disappointed.Okay, why do I call this bizarre, brilliant flick ""the story of my life.""  Well, because on October 20, 1988 (to be exact), I had an experience MUCH like Donnie's, REALLY and TRULY, only in my case I tried to commit suicide.  So when I saw ""Donnie Darko,"" my first reaction was, ""oh my god, HOW did the director know?"" (about my life at that precise moment in my, much like Donnie's, ""emotional problems""-riddled history?).  So ... overcoming the intial ""shock/epiphany"" of seeing my own life played back for me in panoramic technicolor, I curled up, frightened but fascinated, beneath a snuggle blanket and watched further, transfixed by one of the most subtly original, germane, cohesive stories to reach celluloid actualization since ""Dawn of the Dead"" or, much more recently, ""Identity"" (with John Cusack); and I quickly became, not only a believer in time travel, but a living survivor of it (UNLIKE Donnie, but forgive me for (possibly) giving away TOO much here).  This story HAS to be experienced; and perhaps YOU, Constant Viewer, like I do, remember where YOU were - and what YOU were doing/feeling/going through - way back in October of 1988.  Whatever it was, I bet it was something you'll never forget.Like this film - you'll never forget it; and, lessee ... I'm on about my, er ... 12th or 13th viewing of it now (the ORIGINAL, NOT the director's ""clutter"").  I put ""Donnie Darko"" in my Top 5 movies of all time.  For originality, for story, for great, natural, completely successful ""suspension of disbelief"" acting; for being, at once - a tragicomedy, a WILDLY-WEIRD (this is the understatement of the new millennium) dramedy, a fired-up, mind-frying sci/fi thriller, a uniquely-tender-hearted horror yarn, and WAY beyond, My Friends:  ""Donnie"" is a philosophical brain burster much in the same neogenre/league-of-its-own film-making; for counterparts in creative ""playfulness"" behind the motion-picture camera, I can only recommend the following ""warmup"" exercises:  see ""Pi,"" ""Primer,"" ""Adaptation,"" ""Happiness,"" ""Prince of Darkness,"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Martin"" (a little-remembered but unforgettable piece by George A. Romero, who has a brilliant little cameo in this pic as a ""happy marshmallow man-child"" of a Catholic priest).  You'll get the idea FAST, of what you're in for with Donnie.An all-star cast will blow you away and lends immense credulity to this quirkified, whacked-out, indie knockout punch; you'll be reeling when you see here:  Mary McDonnell, Noah Wiley, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore!  Watching Drew play the part of a high-school English teacher is definitely worth ""the price of emotion"" enough (interestingly, if NOT for Barrymore's bankroll (she's the executive producer of Darko's ""reel world,"" in REAL life); fact: ""Darko"" probably never would have lit up our darkened screens at all, without Barrymore's vision and deep enough pockets to realize such - Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, Drew!).  And getting Swayze to play the role of a pedophile HAD to have been a ""challenge,"" er ... to say the LEAST!  Swayze HAD to have been ""a total sport"" about what he was asked to portray; like the way John Malkovich was concerning HIS OWN ""journey through the looking portal.""But enough said.  Darken your own personal viewing room now.  Slide ""Donnie"" into your DVD player.  And ""take the trip,"" safely and securely (yet be warned - your MIND and SPIRIT may NEVER be the same afterwards), as I have, and am living proof of, the reality, horror, and (as Kelly intended, and successfully realized), the HEALING benefits, not unlike ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but only MUCH DARKER implications of, ""time travel.""

The reptilian rabbit head was just plain bizarre and kind of creepy and enough to keep me interested for awhile. However, things didn't start to make any sense and crucial pieces and elements of the ""plot"" started disappearing left and right. By the time the film ended I was wondering to myself, ""What in the world was that all about."" Now after reading a few reviews here, I can see how the whole dream-thing fits in and the movie sort-of makes sense. However, if it was all a dream, then this movie is just one big cop-out. Had the movie been written and edited together better, then this would not be the case. But it is.The writing is awful. Everything is all choppy and convuluted and doesn't make any sense. Of course, if it's all a dream, it does make sense. But, the thing about dreams is, nobody really likes watching other people's dreams. Dreams are difficult enough for the dreamer to understand, yet alone anyone outside in the ""real world"". Dreams are very personal and usually should be kept that way. That's why movies that are dreams on celluloid usually just don't cut it as cinema. A dream has to be restructured to make sense on the screen and if it isn't, it falls apart.However, even if the film did make sense, it still wouldn't be all that great. The poor writing has already been mentioned, but the acting is even worse. Jake Gyllenhall does a decent job as Donnie Darko and the young lady who plays his girlfriend isn't too bad either. Outside of that, most of the actors in this movie seem less believable than a cartoon. Patrick Swayze is one of the big names who has a secondary role in the film. His character seems like somebody who has taken too much speed; I mean Chris Farley's Matt Foley was a better and more believable motivational speaker than this guy. Then there's the other big name of the film, Drew Berrymore. Drew is a brilliant young actress, but in this movie she sucks. She plays a teacher who is dismissed for teaching a graphic novel in class that the school board believes leads to school vandalism. You can tell that Drew just doesn't relate to the noble profession and good old American teachers because her performance is as stiff as a brick wall. One of those Fandango paper-bag puppets could pull off a more believable performance than she did.The acting is pretty lame, the writing poor, and the plot makes no sense. The whole thing is supposed to be a dream, but comes off as being a cheap cop-out. Therefore, you will probably either love or hate this movie.

Maybe that is the wonder of this film: there is so much room for interpretation. Its own complexity only underscores one of its themes. What are these themes, you ask? There are many, and I went through a sort of cycle to understand what the film was trying to say:First I thought it was a film conveying the decay of modern society through metaphor. Then I thought it was about the complexities of fear, and that those who try to pin down life problems too simply are lost in themselves because they choose not to face the truth that lies within the shadows. Lastly, I began to think it was simply a movie that wanted to say, ""There are those who may be able to control fate with time travel, but only a few. They are out there; and it is possible.""Honestly, to me, it was all three rolled into one genius cult flick.I'm a big fan of films that attempt to tackle so much, because 1) it makes me think and approach aspects of my own psyche and 2) it offers more interesting cinema than the normalcy of peaceful narrative. It's even better when the film manages to pull off every one of its goals, especially with engaging symbolism and beautifully crafted twists and turns. I can't even say I caught everything by the end of 'Darko.' But I understood everything I needed to understand.

687385,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005V3Z4,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[10, 10]","""Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut"" takes the audience down the rabbit hole on a long, strange trip that alternately becomes, surreal, comic, dramatic and just plain scary. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) suffers from hallucinations and takes medication to help control his ""visions"". One night after taking his medication he has an encounter with a large, rancid, evil looking six foot tall rabbit who informs him that the world is going to end. ""Frank"" (as he calls his imaginary friend) takes him briefly into the future disappearing and reappearing throughout the film. Evidently only Donnie can stop it. The film moves from fantasy to reality with no clear indication as to whether or not Donnie's ""visions"" are real or if everything is in his imagination. Using a soundtrack made up of 80's staples (""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" by Joy Division, ""Head Over Heels"" by Tears For Fears, ""Never Tear Us Apart"" by INXS among many other titles), director/writer Richard Kelly creates a bizarre satire of suburbia and surreal science fiction drama. Kelly's original version of the film featured some different songs and was shorter (and features new sequences and optical effects not in the 2001 release) but also seemed more open to interpretation. The allegorical references sprinkled throughout the film along with the bizarre dream sequences made the original film both fascinating and plain weird.This new director's cut makes the film less opaque and adds an element of the ""Twilight Zone"" to Kelly's rich, original vision. The director's cut isn't necessarily a better film just different. Visually stunning and with an outstanding cast, inscrutable script ""Donnie Darko"" was just different enough to not score with audiences post-9/11. That's tragic as this totally original film makes an impression whether you're watching the original version or the director's cut of the film.""Donnie Darko"" lives up to its title with a number of unusually dark images. Fox has done an admirable job translating this film to DVD.  Unfortunately, Director Kelly and DP Hunter went for a muted, gauzy look with soft blacks and muddy image reproduction. There's nothing we can do about and Fox has done the best with what they were given. I did notice occasional analog flaws pop up on the print but aside from that it looks pretty good despite the limitations placed on the film by Kelly and Hunter. I'm surprised that Fox didn't use the extended branching approach here that they did with  the""Alien Quadrilogy"" boxed set but that could be simply because the film has been reshuffled too much to do so. The 5.1 and 2.0 mixes sound solid although the sound is a bit murky towards the conclusion with some distortion on this edition of the film.Fox wisely put all the extras on disc two of this set allowing the film to benefit from the extra disc space. We get a ""Donnie Darko Production Diary"" (with optional commentary by Director of Photography Steven Poster). . There's also a commentary track by Director of Photography Steven Poster in the Donnie Darko Production Diary which provides an interesting insider's perspective and lots of trivia about the production of the film. Featuring camcorder shot footage of the search for locations and behind-the-scenes footage of the production, it's an interesting glimpse into the process of pre-production. #1 Donnie Darko Fan is the result of an internet contest for the best short film about being a fan of this film. The winner's film is included and gives a glimpse into the odd world of fandom. We also get a storyboard to screen comparison for a key sequence from the film. They Made Me Do It features interviews with British fans of the film discussing what drew them to the film and how it changed their view of the world.A fascinating commentary track by Director Kelly who discusses his film with fellow Director Kevin Smith (""Clerks""). It's, at turns, informative, philosophical and very involving. Does it answer the big questions about this film? Not exactly but it wasn't designed to do that either.Kelly's original vision has been revised somewhat in this ""Director's Edition"" of Donnie Darko. The meaning of Kelly's film is still, ultimately, open to debate and while the film may be a bit less ambiguous than the first theatrical cut, its also got its fair share of great moments as well.  The first disc comes with a terrific commentary track by Kelly and Director Kevin Smith. The second has all the extras including a documentary on the making of the movie, a glimpse at the fandom following this unusual cult film. We also get to see the film that won the contest for #1 Donnie Darko fan. While it's not something to crow about it is an interesting look at what levels the fans of this unusual and great little movie will go to. Be warned fans of the theatrical cut that this version runs longer, has different songs and may spoil some of your pet theories about the film's meaning.",4,Expanded director's cut slightly different

A number of disturbing events occur, but by the end of the film, you are left wondering what is real and what isn't.Donnie Darko has some merits including interesting performances from the entire cast, and an fairly engaging storyline (but it does drag at times).  Overall, the film is over-rated and only worth seeing to try and determine why it has a cult following.  I'm still figuring out its cult following. Obviously theatre audiences from 2001 agree with me.DVD SUMMARY - includes many deleted and extended scenes.  Some of these are expected to be included in the impending Director's cut due for release shortly.  Apparently this new Director's cut will improve the film's meaning.

The movie plays with the conventions of teen comedy and teen horror movie without falling into the traps of either.  Jake Gyllenhaal generates real sympathy for a character that could have easily been just another Holden Caufield variant.  The tricky plot keeps you guessing.  The movie is also the first period piece whose period is the late 1980's, which has got to count for something.  ""Donnie Darko"" is totally worth watching once.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of watching it twice within the space of a few days, and the second viewing diminished the charm of the first.  Suddenly the teen angst was too heavy, and the loose ends I had found teasingly enigmatic seemed merely sloppy.  Then I made the even worse mistake of watching a few scenes with the commentary turned on.  Director Richard Kelly is a young guy with a dopey voice who clearly identifies with the put upon Donnie.  The gap between what he thought he was doing and what actually came across killed whatever mystery was left.""Donnie Darko"" is Richard Kelly's first movie, and I'm eager to see what he does next.  He's got more visual panache and interesting ideas than most people out there.  If ""Donnie Darko"" doesn't hold together, it's mostly because he tried to put too much of a good thing into one package.

687393,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,B00005V3Z4,Wing J. Flanagan,"[5, 6]","There is a curious cinematic form that has emerged in the last few years, which is akin to the Moebius Strip.  In such films, past shades into future, cause and effect are interchangeable, and the film loops around neatly (and shockingly) to reveal that it is really a sort of closed alternate universe. Examples include Lost Highway, Memento, 12 Monkeys, and now Donnie Darko.One of its charms (and frustrations) is that, like Vanilla Sky, you are never certain just what sort of film it is you are watching until the end.  It reveals itself slowly - layer by layer.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a likeable young man troubled by what is probably paranoid schizophrenia.  Refreshingly, his parents (played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnel), are not the usual teen flick dummies.  The family, while a bit dysfunctional, manages to remain cohesive and loving.  This is important.  The film would function as a sympathetic treatment of mental illness even if it did not have other goals in mind.Darko has strange visions and visitations.  He sleepwalks, and finds himself waking up in odd places.  Most disturbing, he seems to hallucinate a guy named Frank in a macabre bunny suit, who tells him that the world will end in 28 days.  It does not take long to figure out that he's referring to Darko's world, not the world as a whole.To enjoy this film, one needs to understand two things: the events, though strange, are leading to a definite, coherent conclusion; and - importantly - the audience is asked to participate in fitting the pieces of the puzzle together.  There is no character given the task of explaining it to the audience to make sure we get it.  That there is an answer, and that it's slyly revealed through seemingly inexplicable pieces doled out in the course of the story, is a testament to the skill of first-time writer-director Richard Kelly.As plenty of other reviews here make clear, there are many people who lack the patience for this sort of thing.  If you are one of them, you have been warned. You will probably find Donnie Darko both perplexing and pointless. But if you enjoy puzzles, if you find yourself trying to second guess where films are going as you watch, then you will probably find this film enjoyable.Although I didn't think Donnie Darko was very profound, I did find it moving.  Jake Gyllenhaal embodies his character completely, making him sympathetic even when his behavior borders on psychotic.  His is a brilliant, if malfunctioning mind, and Gyllenhaal's performance manages the neat trick of telling us that there is a decent human being struggling under the burden of his illness.  This basic decency leads him to decision at the end of the film that, while not very surprising, is nonetheless heroic in its own way.The DVD is fairly good, with some interesting (if not particularly revealing) extras, and a couple of frustratingly disjointed commentary tracks.  In my opinion, actors and directors should strive to actually PREPARE what they are going to say, while still allowing for some spontaneity during the recording session.  If not, you get a lot of laughing and people talking over one another, as you do here.  It's good for a listen, but don't expect anything truly revealing.I'm not sure how much further the Moebius film can be taken.  It may be exhausted with just a handful of striking examples.

The way ""Donnie Darko"" meanders without warning, or apparent reason, from one genre to another is one of its charms. Is this a science fiction film? superhero? horror? Teen comedy? Yes, all of them!Also refreshing about this film is, despite its name and gloomy cover art, this is not another pointless excercise in teenage doom-and-gloom, depression, angst, apathy, etc. (see Butterfly Effect). The dark moments are tempered by warmth and sweetness (e.g. Donnie actually discussing the time travel book with his family instead of hiding it away, or the genuine affection shown when they watch the youngest daughter perform in the talent show, etc.)The plot is a muddled mess, overly ambiguous, and even the director, in his commentary, seems a bit confused over what he's wrought. He seemed to have a lot of big ideas but lacked the discipline to connect all the dots. There is a lot of exposition missing that would have helped clarify just what we are beholding. Imagine trying to follow all the alternative time-lines and character crossovers of, say, the Back to the Future trilogy, but from the perspective of a minor character who is never actually aware of Marty and Doc and their time machine but witnesses only the changes that resulted from their interference and you have some idea of what I'm talking about.But it is significant that the ambiguity of the plot is never boring or frustrating, as it sometimes is in, say, a David Lynch film, in which you often feel like the director's jerking you around without any point. Donnie Darko always FEELS as though its coming together like some kind of complicated puzzle...even if it ultimately doesn't.The plot, as well as I can make out, is this: A jet engine falls from a plane, landing on Donnie Darko's house and killing him. But due to some time-space anomaly, explained only as an ""act of God"", the engine falls several weeks earlier than it is supposed to..seemingly dropping from out of the blue sky. This time-space anomaly threatens to disrupt the stability of all existence, and so a ghost-figure from the future travels back in time to save Donnie from being killed by the errant jet engine, then proceeds to guide him through various ritualistic acts of violence and destruction that, for reasons never made entirely clear, are necessary to correct the time-space paradox and thereby keep the world from ending. By the end, Donnie apparently has acquired the power to create a ""wormhole"" in space, and when that plane finally makes its flight and drops its engine, he uses a wormhole to transport that dropped engine back in time, thereby correcting the paradox (and sacrificing himself in the process).If it sounds convoluted, it is, but like I said, its never boring. And my analysis may be way off base, but that's part of the magic---that there is plenty to ponder and speculate by the time the credits roll.

I've never seen Drew Barrymore act better.  Even the small roles were developed and meticulously acted, such as Cherita, and Donnie's sister.  All of them had motives and yearnings, which I long to see more in Hollywood.  The score is also a must-have, composed by Michael Andrews, and with a fabulous song by Gary Jules - cover of Tears For Fears - Mad World.This should be seen by everyone.",5,Absolutely.,1021766400,"05 19, 2002",2002,1018,"['ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'surreal', 'consider', 'Linklater', 'Waking', 'Life', 'Bunuel', 'Le', 'Chien', 'Andalou', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Elegantly', 'crafted', 'cinematography', 'definitely', 'script', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'strong', 'acting', 'visceral', 'chills', 'more', 'few', 'places', 'then', 'dark', 'humour', 'top', 'opinion', 'film', 'close', 'tears', 'laughter', 'as', 'well', 'sympathy', 'should', 'rank', 'highest', 'collection.Jena', 'Malone', 'Gretchen', 'smouldering', 'angst-ridden', 'performance', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', '..', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'seen', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'act', 'better', 'Even', 'small', 'roles', 'were', 'developed', 'meticulously', 'acted', 'such', 'Cherita', 'Donnie', 'sister', 'had', 'motives', 'yearnings', 'long', 'see', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'score', 'also', 'must-have', 'composed', 'Michael', 'Andrews', 'fabulous', 'song', 'Gary', 'Jules', 'cover', 'Tears', 'Fears', 'Mad', 'World.This', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone']",Donnie Darko

When said bunny saves him from certain peril one night, it sets in motion a chain of events that present Donnie with a serious of decisions he must make.  To say any more would be to starting leaking spoilers.I'll start with the positives here: Despite the fact that the film gives away absolutely nothing (like a never-ending card game where the hands are never shown), it was still an enjoyable experience.  The characters are interesting, the plot is intriguing, and even though I never quite knew exactly what was going on, I never felt like I was wasting time.  It always seemed as if forward progress was still being attained.That being said, I can't give this movie the full five-star treatment like so many others.  Why?  Because I believe any movie has to have some sort of ""base"" (or some answers given), and this film just refuses to provide them.  It's like being asked to decipher a code without being given any sort of ""key"".  Maybe I'm missing something big here, but until I finished the movie and went online in search of answers I was utterly clueless as to what the heck I just witnessed.  Those online ""answers"" that I found, however, didn't seem to have shown up in the actual movie itself (or very slightly).  SPOILER ALERT: It all seems to be related to the ""book"", but yet the book only shows up in flashes in the movie.  Only in promotional materials does the book seem to be explained, giving us the ""key"" to understanding at least a little bit.Of course, it is always possible that I just ""don't get it"".  But until I do, this is an oddly middling effort for me.  More frustrating than anything, as I was totally engaged until the end when I was severely let down by the esoteric nature of the experience.",3,"Films This Deep Need SOME Explanation, But This One Provides Nothing",1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,2097,"['am', 'avid', 'film-watcher', 'especially', 'ones', 'mind-bending', 'material', 'such', 'one', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'stranger', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'teen', 'named', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'just', 'tad', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'begins', 'seeing', 'vision', 'night', 'giant', 'bunny', 'When', 'said', 'bunny', 'saves', 'certain', 'peril', 'one', 'night', 'motion', 'chain', 'events', 'present', 'Donnie', 'serious', 'decisions', 'must', 'make', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'starting', 'leaking', 'spoilers.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'positives', 'here', 'fact', 'film', 'away', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'never-ending', 'card', 'game', 'where', 'hands', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'even', 'never', 'quite', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'wasting', 'time', 'always', 'seemed', 'forward', 'progress', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'being', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'full', 'five-star', 'treatment', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Why', 'believe', 'movie', 'have', 'sort', 'base', 'answers', 'given', 'film', 'just', 'provide', 'being', 'asked', 'decipher', 'code', 'being', 'given', 'sort', 'key', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'big', 'here', 'finished', 'movie', 'went', 'online', 'search', 'answers', 'was', 'utterly', 'clueless', 'what', 'heck', 'just', 'witnessed', 'online', 'answers', 'found', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'actual', 'movie', 'very', 'slightly', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'be', 'related', 'book', 'yet', 'book', 'only', 'up', 'flashes', 'movie', 'Only', 'promotional', 'materials', 'book', 'seem', 'be', 'explained', 'giving', 'key', 'understanding', 'least', 'little', 'bit.Of', 'course', 'always', 'possible', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'oddly', 'middling', 'effort', 'More', 'frustrating', 'anything', 'was', 'totally', 'engaged', 'end', 'when', 'was', 'severely', 'let', 'down', 'esoteric', 'nature', 'experience']",Donnie Darko
