1279663,A1BOSH8QTZBZ9B,B002N7SXJI,"Clifford Court ""Tech Maven""","[5, 5]","This is an excellent DVD for those who enjoy John Denver's music. It is a collection of most of his hits, probably at the height of his career. Both the sound and video is high quality and his voice is wonderfully clear. Denver doesn't interact too much with the audience, mainly because of the language difference where the concert was held I assume, so it is mainly him and his band moving on with one song after another. But that doesn't detract from hearing Denver's wonderful voice and he is well-supported by his band and back-up singers.If you like John Denver, this DVD is highly recommended.",5,Great DVD for John Denver fans,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,600,"['excellent', 'DVD', 'who', 'enjoy', 'John', 'Denver', 'music', 'collection', 'most', 'hits', 'probably', 'height', 'career', 'sound', 'video', 'high', 'quality', 'voice', 'wonderfully', 'clear', 'Denver', ""n't"", 'interact', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'mainly', 'language', 'difference', 'where', 'concert', 'was', 'held', 'assume', 'mainly', 'band', 'moving', 'one', 'song', ""n't"", 'detract', 'hearing', 'Denver', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'well-supported', 'band', 'back-up', 'singers.If', 'John', 'Denver', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Nesbitt ""NEZI""","[0, 0]","John Denver certainly had his demons including a drinking problem that dogged him from at least his early 30's to his death.This DVD arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Price was very low.I never got to see him in person but he was the very first concert my wife went to back in the mid 1970's. So I bought this mostly for her but I was also curious to see him in concert. He doesn't disappoint on this concert from Japan. He sang all of his hits (to that point in time anyway) and was in very good voice. His backing band was extremely good as well.The closest I ever got to a John Denver concert was seeing Jim Curry, who looks and sounds a lot like Denver did, perform with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra a year or so ago. BTW - if you get a chance you really should see Jim Curry - it was a very good show.Picture was VERY good as was the sound.I would recommend this DVD for Denver fans or anyone who like country-folk-rock. I would rate this a very good 8.75 to 9.25 our of 10 stars!",5,Excellent concert from this very troubled performer,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,996,"['John', 'Denver', 'certainly', 'had', 'demons', 'including', 'drinking', 'problem', 'dogged', 'least', 'early', '30', 'death.This', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'quickly', 'perfect', 'shape', 'Price', 'was', 'very', 'low.I', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'person', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'concert', 'wife', 'went', 'back', 'mid', '1970', 'bought', 'mostly', 'was', 'also', 'curious', 'see', 'concert', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'concert', 'Japan', 'sang', 'hits', 'point', 'time', 'anyway', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'voice', 'backing', 'band', 'was', 'extremely', 'good', 'well.The', 'closest', 'ever', 'got', 'John', 'Denver', 'concert', 'was', 'seeing', 'Jim', 'Curry', 'who', 'lot', 'Denver', 'did', 'perform', 'Indianapolis', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'year', 'so', 'ago', 'BTW', 'get', 'chance', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'Jim', 'Curry', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show.Picture', 'was', 'VERY', 'good', 'was', 'sound.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Denver', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'country-folk-rock', 'would', 'rate', 'very', 'good', '8.75', '9.25', '10', 'stars']",N/A

One thing that is distracting is he turns his back to the audience and &#34;fiddles&#34; with his guitar too much.  He changes guitars a lot and each one seems to need to be tuned or something for which he turns his back on the audience.  At the end when the very polite Japanese people bring flowers to him he does accept them but when someone tries to hand him a note, he gestures them away and when the person puts the note on the stage John walks off and leaves it lying there even after he has come back for an encore.
