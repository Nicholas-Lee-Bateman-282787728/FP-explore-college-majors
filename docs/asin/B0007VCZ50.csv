Younger kids of today may think everything was always shot in ""reality"" style, but it was not.  That said, it is quite amazing how pretentious it is compared to something you'd expect to see today.  Sting came up from a humble background to create a persona that developed into that of a modern day self made Prince or Lord of sorts and self proclaimed Champion of Worthy Causes. So why not have a vanity piece for your new project shot in a French chateau? Thankfully, his musical brilliance made this precious behavior tolerable and this video covers his best solo album (his first), which was a very bold and brave departure from his starring role in the biggest band in the world just before this (The Police). It is fun to watch the powerhouse band develop songs during practice jams and the self importance of the between segment chatter (including  Miles Copeland's frenetic rants, themselves worthy of a Spinal Tap style parody) is all forgiven as soon as Sting hits the stage and belts out fantastic versions of his songs in concert.Any Sting fan must have this! I find the audio and video quality of the DVD to be excellent, and from looking at the reviews here, it doesn't seem like the Bluray version represents much of an improvement, so I am content.

Hartley,"[3, 4]","Whatever the motivations may have been behind this 1985 film concerning Sting's somewhat self-concious transition from spiky-haired posterboy for the 80's New Wave scene to Serious Jazz Artiste, the fact remains that it is one of the better rockumentaries out there. Director Michael Apted delivers an ultra-slick production  with an ""A+"" grade in the cinematography, editing and sound departments as we follow Sting and his crack back up band (ex-Weather Report, Miles Davis players) rehearsing in a French chateau for a ""debut"" performance in Paris. Most of the material is from the outstanding ""Dream Of The Blue Turtles"" album (which Sting has yet to match since-this WAS his artistic peak, IMHO). There are some ""oh so precious"" moments-especially a sequence depicting a ""goofy"" photo-shoot in Paris, with Sting being chased through public squares (and most embarassingly, a public fountain-what, suddenly he's Anita Ekberg in ""La Dolce Vita""? ) by a hyper little weasel wielding a camera and wearing a fez, who I really wished to see drop-kicked into the Seine. My favorite ""Spinal Tap"" moment: Sting's dictatorial manager (Miles Copeland, former Police svengali and founder/president of IRS Records) goes off on a set designer for her ""lack of imagination"" on what he perceives to be a drab and dismal stage look for the Big Show, against which she admirably stands her ground and testily retorts that Sting had told her he WANTED a ""Brechtian effect"".

I really enjoyed the music, from a cast of excellent musicians.  This is a documentary, so there are interviews over some (not all) of the music.  Within the 25 chapters, there are maybe 12 full concert songs.  The rest is rehearsal, with breaks in songs and interviews.  Even a few of the concert songs, are split with rehearsal footage.  There is the option in the special features to set your favorite song list that I have not tried yet.The transfer to DVD is superior in widescreen.  The .1 bass is great.

891801,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B0007VCZ50,One More Option,"[3, 4]","Branford Marsalis says in the film about Sting's music:  ""The music is a tremendous social statement.  Musicians are always social critics.  And that's the biggest problem with pop music is that they don't have any more social critics.  They don't have enough people with the intelligence or the balls to stand up and see the world for what it is and say, 'This s$!t is out.' ""When viewing the same problems, what makes one person call for violence and another person call for understanding?  There are probably many reasons.  The title to this review is an Anais Nin quote that I think suggests part of the answer.'Bring on the Night' is a movie about the launching of 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles' album and the creation of an interracial band.  The songs on the album are protest songs, protesting cold war propoganda, nuclear waste, possessive love, pride that refuses to forgive, and many other things.  For example, ""If You Love Somebody Set Them Free"" is a response to his earlier ""Every Breath You Take"".Sting's intent was to be disarming, to disarm through the discussion and publication of ideas.  He took a stand by stating his positions.  He did not choose to be silent or abandon the issues he cared about.  In his mind, love is not hidden and not silent.  Love doesn't say, ""I care about this issue, but don't tell anyone what I think.""  Good protest songs are made to be sung.Some of the lyrcis from the movie include:  ""One world is enough for all of us.""  ""Love is the seventh wave.""  ""I spent too many years at war with myself.  Doctor has told me, it's no good for my health.""Sting spends time writing a song to his ex, where he laid out both his admission of guilt and an olive branch for reconciliation:  ""If I built this fortress around your heart, encircled you in trenches and barbed wire, then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm, and let me set the battlements on fire.""This movie is the most fluid rock band film I've seen, and both the music and interviews discuss substantive issues.

They share some similarities, the behind the stage/the performance-""mixed"" footage, or easier said; we are invited to see parts of the rehearsal, parts of the show, and there are interviews with all the musicians with Sting in the lead. The main difference is; this whole consept behind the 1985-release (and tour) of the ""Blue Turtles""-material was the big risk Sting was taking being a settled artist, but with this new sound, style and (not least) the musicians he'd hired things indeed could have ruined his reputation and carreer. As you very well know, it didn't! He recieved standing ovations from audiences all over, and became a hit also as a solo-artist. Me myself, well, being a Sting-fan mainly, and not of Police -let's just say that I'm not surprised. Sting is one, if not the one, of the most talented composers and performers (including the musician he has and still works with) in the world today, and this release is another proof of that. I am so happy ""Bring On The Night"" finally has been released in this format. The sound is superb, the picture too -so let's throw away the old tapes now and really enjoy this!If you have a capable system, see it in DTS -the drum-opening on ""If you love somebody..."", it's like being there!Sting somehow becomes, ironically, an ""early"" Eminem (not that I compare them at all, they far from share much of anything else, but) the fact that they were both the only white in their black groups and collegues, Eminem with rappers. Sting theming up with these talented jazz-musicians, and of course, this inspired his composings and performances. Not that it's jazz, actually it is hard to catogorize any of Stings' music. It's kind of ""continental"". But a lot of the improvisings naturally goes over into jazz. And in 1985 the band was facing a lot of shared opinions about their project. (like Eminem had to face until he convinced his audiences, and that's the similarity I find.) But this was before the final result. Sting convinced as well, and from here it has mostly been ""going uphills"" for my favorite artist.Let me add to this that Stings' early influences take roots in jazz, and he was playing with jazz-musicians in the early days of his life. You can read about this in his biography ""Broken Music"". Recommended by the way!""Bring On The Night"" is very inspiring, and interesting that way. Sting is not the only reason for this, the interviews and opinions and presentation of the band is also ""very new"", and presents the project in a way I'd never thought of it before.

891808,A1T4IVIH6NUEXF,B0007VCZ50,sand-da-man,"[2, 2]","It is about time that this ground-breaking video finally made it to DVD, making it even more of an audio and video treasure. I can still remember the first time I saw the special on A & E almost 20 years ago.  I had lost track of Sting and his wanderings after he had left the Police, and wasn't quite sure I wanted to find him anyway given the negative publicity (and my own disappointment) surrounding his departure from what is still regarded as one of the best rock groups of all time. Unsuspecting, while lounging on my back porch I flipped through the cable channels and stumbled onto the program as it had just begun. For the next 2 hours I became mesmerized.The project was an unprecedented undertaking at the time, recording a band not only in live concert but through the whole process from inception to rehearsal to performance. The concept was as risky as it was revolutionary, especially for Sting who had everything to lose by not only gambling on a solo project, but by making this effort so accessible in such a unique manner to the viewing public. In its form and feature, it was also a prototype for what would become ""reality"" TV, long before there was such a category.Beginning with location shots of the band in rehearsal at a French castle just outside Paris, we get an impressive portrait of Sting shaping a new musical ensemble: he lays out the rudimentary form of his original compositions, then brings them to life, gently but confidently directing his very talented charges, mostly accomplished African-American jazz players, through the complex arrangements, allowing for their contributions along the way. What becomes abundantly obvious, beyond his now-and-again reserve and arrogance, is Sting's finely-tuned sense of artistic expression, complemented by his technical knowledge of the medium. He knows what he wants and how to articulate it. In addition to the picture of music and musicians coming together, there are unpredictable and insightful interviews with Sting and other members of the band spliced strategically into the body of the video. Apted's editing is excellent in these instances and rather spectacular overall. At times he even synthesizes the scenes from the concert performance of a song with those at practice, the two segments pieced together as one without missing a note or beat. We also are provided usually unseen glimpses of the band's manager, Miles Copeland, ensuring that peace reigns among the musicians while securing the preparations and publicity for their debut. We are fortunately not subjected to tantrums, petty arguments or catty exchanges, so typical of today's reality TV content, but we do see banter among the members and several spontaneous moments. The camera also, perhaps dubiously, follows Trudy, Sting's wife, to the hospital where we witness her giving birth to their son Jake. The event actually occurred while this was being made,  and it is still part of the footage.The ""Bring On the Night"" video culminates in the live concert. Not surprisingly, despite playing unfamiliar music with an unorthodox mix of instrumentalists in front of an SRO French (that's non-English) audience in Paris, Sting brings the house down. The finished songs are both well-polished and exciting as is their performance, which is near flawless. He finishes the evening with an encore of a few selected Police songs, including ""Message In a Bottle"" which he sings alone on stage - while final credits roll. The show removed any lingering doubts in my mind, low those many years ago, that the lad from Newcastle is indeed a musical genius. Now in this digitized format, it sounds and looks better than ever and is as inspiring as it was two decades before.",5,This is where it all started,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,3718,"['time', 'ground-breaking', 'video', 'finally', 'made', 'DVD', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'audio', 'video', 'treasure', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'special', 'A', 'E', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'lost', 'track', 'Sting', 'wanderings', 'had', 'left', 'Police', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'wanted', 'find', 'anyway', 'given', 'negative', 'publicity', 'own', 'disappointment', 'surrounding', 'departure', 'what', 'still', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', 'rock', 'groups', 'time', 'Unsuspecting', 'lounging', 'back', 'porch', 'flipped', 'cable', 'channels', 'stumbled', 'program', 'had', 'just', 'begun', 'next', '2', 'hours', 'became', 'mesmerized.The', 'project', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'undertaking', 'time', 'recording', 'band', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'concert', 'whole', 'process', 'inception', 'rehearsal', 'performance', 'concept', 'was', 'as', 'risky', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'especially', 'Sting', 'who', 'had', 'everything', 'lose', 'not', 'only', 'gambling', 'solo', 'project', 'making', 'effort', 'so', 'accessible', 'such', 'unique', 'manner', 'viewing', 'public', 'form', 'feature', 'was', 'also', 'prototype', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'reality', 'TV', 'long', 'was', 'such', 'category.Beginning', 'location', 'shots', 'band', 'rehearsal', 'French', 'castle', 'just', 'outside', 'Paris', 'get', 'impressive', 'portrait', 'Sting', 'shaping', 'new', 'musical', 'ensemble', 'out', 'rudimentary', 'form', 'original', 'compositions', 'then', 'life', 'gently', 'confidently', 'directing', 'very', 'talented', 'charges', 'mostly', 'accomplished', 'African-American', 'jazz', 'players', 'complex', 'arrangements', 'allowing', 'contributions', 'way', 'What', 'abundantly', 'obvious', 'now-and-again', 'reserve', 'arrogance', 'Sting', 'finely-tuned', 'sense', 'artistic', 'expression', 'complemented', 'technical', 'knowledge', 'medium', 'what', 'how', 'articulate', 'addition', 'picture', 'music', 'musicians', 'coming', 'together', 'are', 'unpredictable', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'Sting', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'spliced', 'strategically', 'body', 'video', 'Apted', 'editing', 'excellent', 'instances', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'overall', 'times', 'even', 'scenes', 'concert', 'performance', 'song', 'practice', 'two', 'segments', 'pieced', 'together', 'one', 'missing', 'note', 'beat', 'also', 'are', 'provided', 'usually', 'unseen', 'glimpses', 'band', 'manager', 'Miles', 'Copeland', 'ensuring', 'peace', 'reigns', 'musicians', 'securing', 'preparations', 'publicity', 'debut', 'are', 'fortunately', 'not', 'subjected', 'tantrums', 'petty', 'arguments', 'catty', 'exchanges', 'so', 'typical', 'today', 'reality', 'TV', 'content', 'do', 'see', 'banter', 'members', 'several', 'spontaneous', 'moments', 'camera', 'also', 'perhaps', 'dubiously', 'Trudy', 'Sting', 'wife', 'hospital', 'where', 'witness', 'giving', 'birth', 'son', 'Jake', 'event', 'actually', 'occurred', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'still', 'part', 'footage.The', 'Bring', 'Night', 'video', 'culminates', 'live', 'concert', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'playing', 'unfamiliar', 'music', 'unorthodox', 'mix', 'instrumentalists', 'front', 'SRO', 'French', 'non-English', 'audience', 'Paris', 'Sting', 'house', 'down', 'finished', 'songs', 'are', 'well-polished', 'exciting', 'performance', 'flawless', 'evening', 'encore', 'few', 'selected', 'Police', 'songs', 'including', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'alone', 'stage', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'show', 'removed', 'lingering', 'doubts', 'mind', 'low', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'lad', 'Newcastle', 'indeed', 'musical', 'genius', 'Now', 'digitized', 'format', 'better', 'ever', 'as', 'inspiring', 'was', 'two', 'decades']",N/A

891811,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0007VCZ50,Tom Benton,"[2, 2]","Music documentaries don't come much finer than Michael Apted's 1985 classic ""Bring on the Night"".  In the film, exquisitely photographed on 35 mm, Apted documents the rehearsals of Sting's then-newly-assembled backing band and ultimately their first concert.  It's a surprisingly fascinating and stunningly well-made, let alone highly insightful, look at the preparation that went into the performance as well as the dedication and skill of the band and their rather stiff leader.  The members are completely open about their feelings toward Sting and the band, as well as the direction in which it was headed; it is hailed as a work of genius, at once a anti-racial statement and a brilliant melding of intense jazz and intellectual rock.  And while it may be just that, it's Apted's delectable film that is the real work of genius here.We see the astounding skill of the backing band members, Sting's dedication and controlled brilliance as well as his near humorlessness, which the band members (particularly a charmingly young Branford Marsalis!) are all-too-happy to mock.  We see that former Police manager and current Sting manager Miles Copeland (yes, Police drummer Stewart's bro) is actually something of a jerk, but a talented manager.  We feel the tension of opening night, and that is why Apted's film is so great.  Unlike the average documentary, we are not outsiders looking in at a little glass bubble and seeing the machinery work; we are there with the band, along for the ride.  We are amazed at the hard work of the band, and we too struggle against the pressure that the band fights.  We cannot wait to see the fruition of the group's efforts.  Apted makes us feel, and that is why ""Bring on the Night"" is such a masterpiece.Of course, there's also the music.  The concert is fantastic, offering new compositions, a few blues and jazz covers, and some jazzed-up reinterpretations of former Police tunes.  Particularly wonderful is a dazzlingly soothing performance of ""Fortress Around Your Heart"", a sumptuous rendition of ""I Burn for You"" oozing sensuality, and a gleaming, utterly beautiful performance of ""Message in a Bottle"" featuring solely Sting on his guitar.  Another highlight is a memorable sequence in which, while Sting's bombastic, paranoid ""Russians"" plays in the background, Sting's wife Trudie Styler gives birth to their son.""Bring on the Night""'s long-awaited DVD release is worth the wait.  The picture is simply gorgeous, and the DTS sound mix is fantastic, making you feel even more like you're present at Sting's first solo concert.  The DVD also includes three Sting music videos as well as the original trailer, radio spots, and the option to create a ""personal playlist"".  Over twenty years after its release, ""Bring on the Night"" remains one of the very best and most riveting music documentaries ever released, and this DVD is an essential purchase for Sting fans or any musically-inclined soul who wants to experience a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking.",5,I couldn't stand another hour of daylight,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,3008,"['Music', 'documentaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'finer', 'Michael', 'Apted', '1985', 'classic', 'Bring', 'Night', 'film', 'exquisitely', 'photographed', '35', 'mm', 'Apted', 'documents', 'rehearsals', 'Sting', 'then-newly-assembled', 'backing', 'band', 'ultimately', 'first', 'concert', 'surprisingly', 'fascinating', 'stunningly', 'well-made', 'let', 'alone', 'highly', 'insightful', 'look', 'preparation', 'went', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'dedication', 'skill', 'band', 'rather', 'stiff', 'leader', 'members', 'are', 'completely', 'open', 'feelings', 'Sting', 'band', 'as', 'well', 'direction', 'was', 'headed', 'hailed', 'work', 'genius', 'once', 'anti-racial', 'statement', 'brilliant', 'melding', 'intense', 'jazz', 'intellectual', 'rock', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'Apted', 'delectable', 'film', 'real', 'work', 'genius', 'here.We', 'see', 'astounding', 'skill', 'backing', 'band', 'members', 'Sting', 'dedication', 'controlled', 'brilliance', 'as', 'well', 'humorlessness', 'band', 'members', 'particularly', 'charmingly', 'young', 'Branford', 'Marsalis', 'are', 'all-too-happy', 'mock', 'see', 'former', 'Police', 'manager', 'current', 'Sting', 'manager', 'Miles', 'Copeland', 'yes', 'Police', 'drummer', 'Stewart', 'bro', 'actually', 'something', 'jerk', 'talented', 'manager', 'feel', 'tension', 'opening', 'night', 'why', 'Apted', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'average', 'documentary', 'are', 'not', 'outsiders', 'looking', 'little', 'glass', 'bubble', 'seeing', 'machinery', 'work', 'are', 'there', 'band', 'ride', 'are', 'amazed', 'hard', 'work', 'band', 'too', 'struggle', 'pressure', 'band', 'fights', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'fruition', 'group', 'efforts', 'Apted', 'feel', 'why', 'Bring', 'Night', 'masterpiece.Of', 'course', 'also', 'music', 'concert', 'fantastic', 'offering', 'new', 'compositions', 'few', 'blues', 'jazz', 'covers', 'jazzed-up', 'reinterpretations', 'former', 'Police', 'tunes', 'Particularly', 'wonderful', 'dazzlingly', 'soothing', 'performance', 'Fortress', 'Your', 'Heart', 'sumptuous', 'rendition', 'Burn', 'oozing', 'sensuality', 'gleaming', 'utterly', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'Message', 'Bottle', 'featuring', 'solely', 'Sting', 'guitar', 'highlight', 'memorable', 'sequence', 'Sting', 'bombastic', 'paranoid', 'Russians', 'plays', 'background', 'Sting', 'wife', 'Trudie', 'Styler', 'birth', 'son', 'Bring', 'Night', 'long-awaited', 'DVD', 'release', 'wait', 'picture', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'DTS', 'sound', 'mix', 'fantastic', 'making', 'feel', 'even', 'more', ""'re"", 'present', 'Sting', 'first', 'solo', 'concert', 'DVD', 'also', 'three', 'Sting', 'music', 'videos', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'trailer', 'radio', 'spots', 'option', 'create', 'personal', 'playlist', 'twenty', 'years', 'release', 'Bring', 'Night', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'most', 'riveting', 'music', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'released', 'DVD', 'essential', 'purchase', 'Sting', 'fans', 'musically-inclined', 'soul', 'who', 'experience', 'masterpiece', 'documentary', 'filmmaking']",N/A
