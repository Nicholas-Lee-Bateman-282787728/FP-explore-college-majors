I liked the build up to the Avators not sure if they were good or evil. The Charmed Ones originally being against them then working with them to bring about Utopia only to realize its not what they want. I like that Piper, Pboebe and Paige come to the realization and chose to go back to the normal good vs. evil world by teaming up with the demons. It was fun to see them all on one side. Phoebe and Paige each find a love interest in Les and Kyle but neither romance was that interesting. Billy Zane was an exciting addition for three epsoides. I wish they had him on longer. I liked Zankou, he was a very good demon and had the Charmed Ones on the run ending in the wonderful season finale in Something Wicca Goes This Way.

1028373,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000JLTRIG,calvinnme,"[27, 32]","The best thing about Charmed was that it was pure entertainment involving both drama and comedy, with the balance between the two depending on the theme of each individual episode. It wasn't supposed to show Wicca in a good light or a bad light or even a remotely correct light - it was just a clever metaphor for the relationship between the sisters, which was the real point of the series. It was supposed to be sappy and corny at times. It was supposed to be like a soap opera. I never loved Rose McGowan as Paige, but, to be truthful, I never liked Shannon Dougherty as Prue that much either. I always enjoyed watching until Billie joined in the last season. How could it be that a witch, not related to the Charmed Ones, is more powerful than they? If so, why were they even called the Charmed Ones in the first place? That is why this seventh season should have been the final one. I thought that the plots in season eight were at times more powerful and clever than season seven, but Billie's antics just got in the way of enjoying it. Plus, the season seven finale did such a good job of wrapping everything up it just seemed like an appropriate place to end the series.Season seven is definitely much better than season six. It seemed like Charmed drifted for a season and a half after Cole's death in the middle of season five since the show had so much invested in that storyline, but here they are back on track. Being an ""Angel"" fan, I particularly liked Charisma Carpenter's guest appearances, even if she does come across like the Buffy-era Cordelia except with magical powers. I also liked ""Cheaper by the Coven"" where the sisters revert to their teenage personas and Wyatt creates a demon in the image of his dad because he feels like it is his fault that Leo isn't around and Gideon is dead. It shows just how much the parents' relationship affects their children, and also how much parents dont realize that their interactions with each other affect their children. This episode sees Piper and Leo putting aside their differences to help their son, and it was really great to see that again. Overall, highly recommended.",5,Season seven is back on track,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2139,"['best', 'thing', 'Charmed', 'was', 'was', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'involving', 'drama', 'comedy', 'balance', 'two', 'depending', 'theme', 'individual', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'show', 'Wicca', 'good', 'light', 'bad', 'light', 'even', 'remotely', 'correct', 'light', 'was', 'just', 'clever', 'metaphor', 'relationship', 'sisters', 'was', 'real', 'point', 'series', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sappy', 'corny', 'times', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'soap', 'opera', 'never', 'loved', 'Rose', 'McGowan', 'Paige', 'be', 'truthful', 'never', 'liked', 'Shannon', 'Dougherty', 'Prue', 'much', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Billie', 'joined', 'last', 'season', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'witch', 'not', 'related', 'Charmed', 'Ones', 'more', 'powerful', 'so', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'called', 'Charmed', 'Ones', 'first', 'place', 'why', 'seventh', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'final', 'one', 'thought', 'plots', 'season', 'eight', 'were', 'times', 'more', 'powerful', 'clever', 'season', 'seven', 'Billie', 'antics', 'just', 'got', 'way', 'enjoying', 'season', 'seven', 'finale', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'wrapping', 'everything', 'just', 'seemed', 'appropriate', 'place', 'end', 'series.Season', 'seven', 'definitely', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'six', 'seemed', 'Charmed', 'drifted', 'season', 'half', 'Cole', 'death', 'middle', 'season', 'five', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'invested', 'storyline', 'here', 'are', 'back', 'track', 'Being', 'Angel', 'fan', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'guest', 'appearances', 'even', 'come', 'Buffy-era', 'Cordelia', 'magical', 'powers', 'also', 'liked', 'Cheaper', 'Coven', 'where', 'sisters', 'revert', 'teenage', 'personas', 'Wyatt', 'demon', 'image', 'dad', 'fault', 'Leo', ""n't"", 'around', 'Gideon', 'dead', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'parents', 'relationship', 'children', 'also', 'how', 'much', 'parents', 'dont', 'realize', 'interactions', 'other', 'affect', 'children', 'episode', 'Piper', 'Leo', 'putting', 'aside', 'differences', 'help', 'son', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'see', 'again', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommended']",Charmed: Season 7
1028374,A3JM17QHAJCOWD,B000JLTRIG,Catherine Gallanti,"[5, 6]","This is not the best season of Charmed, but I preferred it to season 5 and 6, which I thought were a little on the boring side. That may be because I prefer the darker story lines and here we had a revival of some of the darker themes of the Charmed mythology.I enjoyed watching Leo's inner conflict with the elders, his grappling with his inner deamons, namely anger and revenge, and the chasing of the dream of a world without the good and evil polarity. Great to see him and the sisters eventually realize that the tensions between good and evil is linked to free will and that a world without free will, however peaceful on the surface, is actually worst than the ills the utopian dream proclaimed to cure.The episodes after the dismantelling of Utopia and the leaving of the avatars were not particularly riveting and could have been better. The story itself was good: the demonic world with a new leader attempts to take hold of the Nexus and Book of shadows, almost defeating the Charmed ones for good. These could have been great episodes if the leader of the underworld had been a bit more convincing. This chief deamon however did not have much of an edge...nothing compared to the charisma we encountered say in the first Source or even better in the Cole/Baltazar deamon of season 4. I have missed Cole since season 4, he was such a great character, which, by the way, makes a short guest appearance in ""the seventh year witch"" episode in this season.All in all however, this was a good season and I had fun watching it...and the twist at the end is pretty neat(which I will not reveal, just in case you have not watched it yet, as it would spoil your fun).

That's just my way of introducing CHARMED: The Complete Seventh Season. This is season, just like the first six seasons, is jam packed with more intense storylines. But those intense storylines can't seem to get the best of THE CHARMED ONES. PIPER (again played by Holly Marie Combs), PHOEBE (again played by Alyssa Milano), & PAIGE (again played by Rose McGowan) are back for a seventh round of defeating demons, warlocks, and many more.""A Call to Arms""Reeling from the loss of their future son Chris, an overprotective Piper and Barbas-obsessed Leo are forced by Phoebe and Paige to attend a Hindu wedding, where they inadvertently receive the powers of the Hindu's Ultimate Lovers, Shakti, the Goddess of Creation and her lover, Shiva, the God of Destruction.""The Bare Witch Project""Paige almost loses her fight to save Magic School when a bored student accidentally conjures Lady Godiva and Lord Dyson, a demonic land baron who feeds off humans' repressed emotions.""Cheaper by the Coven""Against Piper's wishes, Paige and Phoebe summon Grams for Chris's wiccaning. To put an end to the brother's sibling rivalry, Grams puts a spell on them, but in the process turns the sisters back to bickering teenagers.""Charrrmed!""On a search to find witches who have been disappearing, Paige encounters Captain Black Jack Cutting, an infamous 18th century pirate who is searching for the Fountain of Youth to reverse a curse that causes him to age but never die.""Styx Feet Under""When a demon, Sirk, tries to destroy his human half by killing off his remaining blood relatives, Paige casts a spell that inadvertently blocks all death from occurring. Annoyed that he now has a back-log of work, the Angel of Death insists that the Charmed Ones help him clean up the mess and ""kills"" Piper so she can help him restore the Grand Design.""Once in a Blue Moon""The Elders' suspicion of Leo causes them to assign a new Whitelighter to the girls. However, when the new Whitelighter is nearly killed by beasts, the Elders blame the attack on Leo. Trying to prove Leo's innocence, Piper, Phoebe and Paige discover that the beasts are actually the Charmed Ones' themselves, transformed by a blue moon.""Someone to Witch Over Me""Agent Brody convinces Paige to help him solve a mysterious string of accidents, only to discover that the demon Sarpedon is capturing innocents' Guardian angels and using them to protect himself from the forthcoming threat of a New Power.""Charmed Noir""While investigating a murder at Magic School, Paige and Agent Brody are sucked into an unfinished novel written twenty years ago by two students. They suddenly find themselves in a 1930s film noir, where they are chased by gangsters in pursuit of the famed Burmese Falcon.""There's Something About Leo""Leo reveals to Piper that he is an Avatar, despite the warnings from Alpha and Beta that Piper should find out in her own time. Phoebe and Paige call on Kyle for help, but his reaction to the news causes disastrous results.""Witchness Protection""The Avatars insist that Leo protect the Seer because she has information that can help them destroy the demons. The Seer shares with Phoebe a vision of a future in which there are no demons, leading the sisters to consider the possibility that the Avatars might be good and allowing Leo the opportunity to admit he is an Avatar.""Ordinary Witches""Still not completely sure that the Avatars mean well, Piper agrees to switch powers with Phoebe so that she too can see Phoebe's premonition of a Utopian world. During the spell, Zankou, the most powerful demon in the underworld, senses the girls' vulnerability and attacks them, accidentally transferring their powers to innocent bystanders, who run amok with their new abilities.""Extreme Makeover: World Edition""While the Avatars prepare to transform the world into a Utopia, they inform the Charmed Ones that the human world must be put to sleep so that they can kill any remaining demons. Brody, doubting the Avatars good intentions, calls the Elders for help but is instead kidnapped by Zankou and agrees to help Zankou stop the change by placing a paranoia spell on Piper, Phoebe and Paige. During the Utopian transformation, Brody uses Paige's paranoia to attract and kill an Avatar. However, Brody pays a high price for his actions.""Charmageddon""While the Charmed Ones enjoy their new conflict-free world, Leo learns that in order for the Avatars to protect their Utopian world, they also control everyone's destiny by deciding who lives and dies. Wanting to stop the Avatars, Leo joins forces with Zankou to undo the change. Paige receives a special surprise and Leo's fate relies on the Elders.""Carpe Demon""When Paige attempts to hire a new professor for Magic School, she learns that one of the candidates, Drake, is an ex-demon who made a deal with a demonic Sorcerer to become human.""Show Ghouls""When Darryl fears his friend Mike is possessed, Phoebe, Paige and Drake discover that Mike had been working close to a site where a cabaret was destroyed in a fire in 1899, killing hundreds of people. The spirit of one of the victims is using Mike to plead for help on behalf of all the Lost Souls who are trapped in the cabaret, forced to relive that night for eternity.""The Seven Year Witch""Already stressed out awaiting word on Leo's fate, Piper is attacked by demons and ends up in a coma. Stuck in the cosmic void between life and death, Piper's spirit is surprised to find Cole waiting for her and even more surprised when he tells her that he is there to help keep her and Leo together, which he hopes will restore Phoebe's faith in love.""Scry Hard ""Zankou sends his underlings to attack Leo in hopes of luring the sisters out of their house so that he can search for the Nexus and release the Shadow, the ultimate power. Terrified after witnessing demons attack his parents, Wyatt magically shrinks Piper and Leo and traps them inside a dollhouse for their protection.""Little Box of Horrors""The Charmed Ones are in a race against time when the mythological Pandora's Box falls into the hands of Katya, a shapeshifting demon who intends to open the box and fill the world with all of its sorrows. Phoebe and Piper try to find Hope, the Guardian who can return any released evil spirits to the box.""Freaky Phoebe""After a spell is cast on Phoebe by the power-hungry sorceress Imara, their souls switch bodies and Phoebe ends up becoming trapped in a cage.""Imaginary Fiends""Unbeknownst to the Charmed Ones, baby Wyatt's new ""imaginary"" friend is actually the demon Vicus, who is trying to win Wyatt's trust to turn him evil. Piper casts a spell to be able to understand baby Wyatt, but inadvertently brings 25-year-old Wyatt back from the future.""Death Becomes Them""Zankou's plan to make the sisters vulnerable so that he can take control of the Book of Shadows starts to work when Phoebe is left guilt-ridden after a classmate is brutally killed in front of her and comes back from the dead to blame her. Also part of Zankou's plan, Paige is devastated when she finds her new charge dead and realizes she was powerless to save her.""Something Wicca This Way Goes""With the Book of Shadows finally in his possession, Zankou plans to open the Spiritual Nexus and take in the power of the Shadow. To divert Zankou's attention away from the Nexus, Piper, Phoebe and Paige successfully goad him into coming after them instead. The sisters come to the realization that the only way to stop Zankou may be to sacrifice themselves.What a great season. Very bewitching.

As a result of season 6 many long-time fans jumped ship and really didn't care if the show floundered and sank.  This is really a shame as season 7 picks up a gust of magical wind and sails the show off into the sunset on a strong current of good shows.  The first half of the season deals with the Avatars and is basically a through story with many different character dimensions that were absent in season 6.  This slow burn lasts until the story is resolved.  After this the show seems a bit directionless, but with the help of a riotous Billy Zane for a few shows ""Charmed"" regains the humor of those hilarious early years.  There is even one great scene where he dances with Phoebe while dressed up as Gene Kelly from ""Singin' in the Rain.""  Great stuff!  There is even a surprise cameo appearance by one of the former cast members during one episode (no, I won't spoil who re-appears) that had me smiling a bit.  The final episodes attempt to bring closure to the story while leaving a hopeful ""out"" for a possible future return of the Charmed Ones.  Recommended.

After a lot of lighter, more comedic episodes in seasons 5 and 6, Season 7 returned the series to the darker glory days of seasons 3 and 4.  I loved the story arcs in the season, and the writing and direction were dead on.Season 7 picks up where season 6 ended; adult Chris is dead and Leo can't stop grieving and move on.  As his marriage to Piper continues to fall apart he is courted (in rather strange fashion) by Avatars (we saw them in Season 5 in the episode ""Sam I Am,"" where Paige is reunited with her real father, Sam)to change the world and end the struggle between good and evil.  Woven into this storyline are Paige's romance with the Avatar-obsessed Agent Brody (Kerr Smith) and Phoebe's romance with Les (Nick Lachey) and her sabbatical to find herself.  The Avatar story only lasted half the season but segued nicely into the rise of Zankou.  As Zankour terrorizes the sisters during the final half of the season in his quest for the Book of Shadows and the Nexus, Phoebe has a romance with an ex-demon and returns to school.  Paige decides running magic school isn't for her; she passes the baton to a newly mortal Leo and is thrust into double duty as a witch and a whitelighter.  Piper, after nearly dying, tries to rework her marriage to Leo, who gives up his powers to be with his family.",5,An outstanding season!,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1399,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Season', '7', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'favorites', 'lot', 'lighter', 'more', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'Season', '7', 'returned', 'series', 'darker', 'glory', 'days', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'loved', 'story', 'arcs', 'season', 'writing', 'direction', 'were', 'dead', 'on.Season', '7', 'up', 'where', 'season', '6', 'ended', 'adult', 'Chris', 'dead', 'Leo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'grieving', 'move', 'marriage', 'Piper', 'fall', 'apart', 'courted', 'rather', 'strange', 'fashion', 'Avatars', 'saw', 'Season', '5', 'episode', 'Sam', 'Am', 'where', 'Paige', 'reunited', 'real', 'father', 'Sam', 'change', 'world', 'end', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'Woven', 'storyline', 'are', 'Paige', 'romance', 'Avatar-obsessed', 'Agent', 'Brody', 'Kerr', 'Smith', 'Phoebe', 'romance', 'Les', 'Nick', 'Lachey', 'sabbatical', 'find', 'Avatar', 'story', 'only', 'lasted', 'season', 'segued', 'nicely', 'rise', 'Zankou', 'Zankour', 'sisters', 'final', 'half', 'season', 'quest', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'Nexus', 'Phoebe', 'romance', 'ex-demon', 'returns', 'school', 'Paige', 'running', 'magic', 'school', ""n't"", 'baton', 'newly', 'mortal', 'Leo', 'thrust', 'double', 'duty', 'witch', 'whitelighter', 'Piper', 'nearly', 'dying', 'tries', 'rework', 'marriage', 'Leo', 'who', 'up', 'powers', 'be', 'family']",Charmed: Season 7

1028415,A1NECG4UNVOPWJ,B000JLTRIG,Tyler,"[133, 142]","Season 7 is a very interesting year for the world of Charmed. When it is bad, it is REALLY bad but when it is good, it is REALLY good. It really is a hit or miss situation.The best episodes would have to be the ones near the end of the season but there are also some spread out through the season. Some of the best: Something Wicca This Way Goes, Witchness Protection, Charmed Noir, The Seven Year Witch, Srcy Hard and Death Becomes Them.The worst episodes: A Call To Arms, The Bare Witch Project, and Once In A Blue Moon.The Complete Rundown:1. A Call To Arms - When Piper and Leo attend a Hindu wedding, they become possessed by Hindu gods. This episode is alright, but doesn't seem strong enough to be a season opener.2. The Bare Witch Project - A student at magic school accidently conjures Lady Godiva, and the sisters must help return her to her time so she can finish her ride. Slightly better than the premiere but still doesn't live up to ""Classic Charmed""3. Cheaper By The Coven - Chris' wiccaning is upon us and the sister summon Grams for help, but when a spell goes awry, the sisters revert to their teenage selves. Fun episode that brings back favorites like Grams, Patty and Victor.4. Charrrmed! - A pirate comes to town searching for the fountain of youth. Most people did not like this episode, but I did find it entertaining. Depends on your tastes.5. Styx Feet Under - The Angel of Death is back after Paige casts a spell that blocks all death. Very well done episode, really good acting here.6. Once In A Blue Moon - The sisters are transformed into beasts. Bad episode. Really boring.7. Someone To Witch Over Me - Guardian Angels are being captured. Meanwhile Leo goes on a vision quest. Fans of Drew Fuller will enjoy this because Chris makes an appearance.8. Charmed Noir - Paige and Angent Brody are trapped in a 40's Noir book. One of the best episodes of the season. Smart, fun and true to the time period.9. There's Something About Leo - The sisters find out Leo is an avatar and the consequences are dire when Kyle Brody finds out. Interesting episode.10. Witchness Protection - The Seer is under attack and the sisters reluctantly help her. One of my favorites, Charisma Carpenter is great as the Seer and she finally gets more screen time than in Cheaper By The Coven and Styx Feet Under.11. Ordinary Witches - Paige takes Kyle back to the past to find out how his parents died. Interesting episode, but more leading up to the next episode/s.12. Extreme Makeover: World Edition - The sisters are about ready to makeover the world, when Kyle casts a paranoia spell on them. Good episode. Serves as a part one to Charmageddon.13. Charmageddon - Leo forms an unlikely alliance with Zankou so he can try to reverse the change. Good episode, conclusion to Extreme Makeover: World Edition.14. Carpe Demon - Drake, an ex-demon, applies for a teaching position at magic school and ends up taking Phoebe on a wild ride around San Francisco as Robin Hood.15. Show Ghouls - Phoebe and Drake are transported back to 1899, to help find out what happened at a cabaret. Fun episode.16. The Seven Year Witch - Piper ends up in a coma, Leo loses his memory and tries to find his way back to his family and Cole returns to restore Phoebe's faith in love. GREAT episode, and also features the final appearance of Cole.17. Scry Hard - Wyatt shrinks Piper and Leo into a dollhouse. Good episode, exciting.18. Little Box Of Horrors - The sisters must find Pandora's box before someone unleashes the evil inside. Good episode but not as exciting as some episodes before it.19. Freaky Phoebe - An ugly sorceress switches bodies with Phoebe. Alright episode.20. Imaginary Fiends - Wyatt's imaginary friend is a demon who is trying to turn him evil. Good episode, also sees the return of Adult Wyatt.21. Death Becomes Them - Dead innocents from the sisters' past comes back to haunt them, thanks to Zankou. Great episode. Dramatic, emotional and all around good. Also serves as a part 1 to Something Wicca This Way Goes.22. Something Wicca This Way Goes - The girls finally go after Zankou when he gains control of the Nexus. Great episode. Was originally intended to be both a season finale and a series finale. Conclusion to Death Becomes Them.As you can see, there are many more good episodes here than bad. There are just as many clunkers here than with any other season, perhaps even less than usual. With the show still up in the air, the finale was intended to be a series finale if necessary, but thankfully we get one final season.I recommend this to all fans of the show, especially seeing as we are now in the home stretch. 7 down, 1 to go! Enjoy it while it lasts!",5,Is Season 7 Heaven for Charmed Fans?,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,4680,"['Season', '7', 'very', 'interesting', 'year', 'world', 'Charmed', 'When', 'bad', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'when', 'good', 'REALLY', 'good', 'really', 'hit', 'miss', 'situation.The', 'best', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'ones', 'end', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'spread', 'season', 'best', 'Something', 'Wicca', 'Way', 'Goes', 'Witchness', 'Protection', 'Charmed', 'Noir', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Witch', 'Srcy', 'Hard', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Them.The', 'worst', 'episodes', 'Call', 'Arms', 'Bare', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Once', 'A', 'Blue', 'Moon.The', 'Complete', 'Rundown:1', 'A', 'Call', 'Arms', 'When', 'Piper', 'Leo', 'attend', 'Hindu', 'wedding', 'become', 'possessed', 'Hindu', 'gods', 'episode', 'alright', ""n't"", 'seem', 'strong', 'enough', 'be', 'season', 'opener.2', 'Bare', 'Witch', 'Project', 'student', 'magic', 'school', 'accidently', 'Lady', 'Godiva', 'sisters', 'must', 'help', 'return', 'time', 'can', 'finish', 'ride', 'Slightly', 'better', 'premiere', 'still', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Classic', 'Charmed', '3', 'Cheaper', 'Coven', 'Chris', 'wiccaning', 'sister', 'summon', 'Grams', 'help', 'when', 'spell', 'awry', 'sisters', 'revert', 'teenage', 'selves', 'Fun', 'episode', 'back', 'favorites', 'Grams', 'Patty', 'Victor.4', 'Charrrmed', 'pirate', 'town', 'searching', 'fountain', 'youth', 'Most', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'episode', 'did', 'find', 'entertaining', 'tastes.5', 'Styx', 'Feet', 'Angel', 'Death', 'back', 'Paige', 'spell', 'death', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'episode', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'here.6', 'Once', 'A', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'sisters', 'are', 'transformed', 'beasts', 'Bad', 'episode', 'Really', 'boring.7', 'Someone', 'Witch', 'Me', 'Guardian', 'Angels', 'are', 'being', 'captured', 'Meanwhile', 'Leo', 'vision', 'quest', 'Fans', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Chris', 'appearance.8', 'Charmed', 'Noir', 'Paige', 'Angent', 'Brody', 'are', 'trapped', '40', 'Noir', 'book', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'Smart', 'fun', 'true', 'time', 'period.9', 'Something', 'Leo', 'sisters', 'find', 'out', 'Leo', 'avatar', 'consequences', 'are', 'dire', 'when', 'Kyle', 'Brody', 'out', 'Interesting', 'episode.10', 'Witchness', 'Protection', 'Seer', 'attack', 'sisters', 'reluctantly', 'help', 'One', 'favorites', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'great', 'Seer', 'finally', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Cheaper', 'Coven', 'Styx', 'Feet', 'Under.11', 'Ordinary', 'Witches', 'Paige', 'Kyle', 'back', 'past', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'parents', 'died', 'Interesting', 'episode', 'more', 'leading', 'up', 'next', 'episode/s.12', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'World', 'Edition', 'sisters', 'are', 'ready', 'makeover', 'world', 'when', 'Kyle', 'paranoia', 'spell', 'Good', 'episode', 'part', 'one', 'Charmageddon.13', 'Charmageddon', 'Leo', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'Zankou', 'can', 'try', 'reverse', 'change', 'Good', 'episode', 'conclusion', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'World', 'Edition.14', 'Carpe', 'Demon', 'Drake', 'ex-demon', 'applies', 'teaching', 'position', 'magic', 'school', 'up', 'taking', 'Phoebe', 'wild', 'ride', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Robin', 'Hood.15', 'Show', 'Ghouls', 'Phoebe', 'Drake', 'are', 'transported', 'back', '1899', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'cabaret', 'Fun', 'episode.16', 'Seven', 'Year', 'Witch', 'Piper', 'up', 'coma', 'Leo', 'memory', 'tries', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'family', 'Cole', 'returns', 'restore', 'Phoebe', 'faith', 'love', 'GREAT', 'episode', 'also', 'final', 'appearance', 'Cole.17', 'Scry', 'Hard', 'Wyatt', 'Piper', 'Leo', 'dollhouse', 'Good', 'episode', 'exciting.18', 'Little', 'Box', 'Horrors', 'sisters', 'must', 'find', 'Pandora', 'box', 'someone', 'evil', 'inside', 'Good', 'episode', 'not', 'as', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'it.19', 'Freaky', 'Phoebe', 'ugly', 'sorceress', 'switches', 'bodies', 'Phoebe', 'Alright', 'episode.20', 'Imaginary', 'Fiends', 'Wyatt', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'demon', 'who', 'trying', 'turn', 'evil', 'Good', 'episode', 'also', 'return', 'Adult', 'Wyatt.21', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Them', 'Dead', 'innocents', 'sisters', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'thanks', 'Zankou', 'Great', 'episode', 'Dramatic', 'emotional', 'around', 'good', 'Also', 'part', '1', 'Something', 'Wicca', 'Way', 'Goes.22', 'Something', 'Way', 'Goes', 'girls', 'finally', 'go', 'Zankou', 'when', 'gains', 'control', 'Nexus', 'Great', 'episode', 'Was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'season', 'finale', 'series', 'finale', 'Conclusion', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Them.As', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'good', 'episodes', 'here', 'bad', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'clunkers', 'here', 'other', 'season', 'perhaps', 'even', 'less', 'usual', 'show', 'still', 'up', 'air', 'finale', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'series', 'finale', 'necessary', 'thankfully', 'get', 'one', 'final', 'season.I', 'recommend', 'fans', 'show', 'especially', 'seeing', 'are', 'now', 'home', 'stretch', '7', 'down', '1', 'go', 'Enjoy']",Charmed: Season 7
