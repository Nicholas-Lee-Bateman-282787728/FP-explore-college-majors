Erin Dugan ""janie""","[1, 1]","This is one of those movies that your not really sure what you're watching at first but you keep watching and enjoying it more and more as you try to figure it out. Then when it's over, you wish it wasn't. I just watched it for a second time, hoping at first that it was the same one I thought it was. And now I'm so pleased that it was the same movie and again, sorry it's over. So I'm buying it, because it would be too hard to explain to my friends. I'll just show it for them and hope they like it as much as I did. I'm betting they will.",5,"Delightful surprise,",1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,542,"['one', 'movies', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'first', 'keep', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'more', 'more', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'Then', 'when', 'over', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'hoping', 'first', 'was', 'same', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'now', ""'m"", 'so', 'pleased', 'was', 'same', 'movie', 'again', 'sorry', 'over', 'So', ""'m"", 'buying', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'explain', 'friends', ""'ll"", 'just', 'show', 'hope', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'did', ""'m"", 'betting', 'will']",N/A

The two leads had really good chemistry, but the premise of the movie is unsettling to me. I read in another review on Netflix that the movie addressed street harassment and bullying therefore the harassment scene in the first 10 minutes, while clearly disturbing, was actually very realistic in nature. It's something I have experienced myself and it's not talked about often enough, so I was OK with it showing how scary a scenario like that really is to women. And I was really hoping to see a movie that further addressed this aspect of society.********SPOILERS BELOW********But the problem is, she goes directly from that incident, visibly shaken, into a store to get some paper towels, when the other lead in the movie recognizes her and calls after her. She is so distressed she CLEARLY doesn't want to talk to anyone. So what does he do? He follows her, persists in asking her what's wrong and what happened. And frankly I feel he takes advantage of the situation manipulating her into having breakfast with him. Claiming he can make her feel better. Others might not see it as manipulative, but it bothered me how that whole scene (and later ones too) played out. The whole opening 20 minutes was frankly distressing to ME to watch.As one other reviewer pointed out elsewhere, he spends the rest of the day asking her to do things, favors, etc the *he* thinks will make her feel better, not really asking her what she wants except for once.The scene with the sister was awkward on so many levels. Not only because how of how emotionally abusive she is towards Michael, but also just awkward for Ashley. I felt like it was crappy for Michael to knowingly walk her into that kind of situation with his sister. It reeks of emotional manipulation is his part trying to get sympathy from Ashley. But that's not surprising given the plot twist showing he's got a deeper ulterior motive. And don't get me started on that plot twist.I'd have been happy with the ending had it ended when she walked out of the caf&eacute;. I'd have even been happy if it had ended with her confused phone call to her friend because she'd felt her trust and emotions had been so thoroughly violated and she was confused. Hell I'd have even been OK if she'd decided to forgive him on her own. But the way it ends with him showing up to the sandwich shop claiming she needed to listen to his explanation, stop being so sensitive and be mature and try and see why he did what he did. If she couldn't he would come back day after day (can we say STALKING??) until she forgave him? Nope that was the nail in the coffin there. The ending was horrible on top of an already manipulative and selfish premise.I almost wish now he were an angel. That would've actually been an interesting story",2,"Ending ruined a movie that could've been a great tale about the consequences of harassment, bullying, manipulation and lying.",1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,2853,"['2.5', 'stars', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'given', 'more', 'two', 'leads', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'chemistry', 'premise', 'movie', 'unsettling', 'read', 'review', 'Netflix', 'movie', 'addressed', 'street', 'harassment', 'bullying', 'therefore', 'harassment', 'scene', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'clearly', 'disturbing', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'realistic', 'nature', 'something', 'have', 'experienced', 'not', 'talked', 'about', 'often', 'enough', 'was', 'OK', 'showing', 'how', 'scary', 'scenario', 'really', 'women', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'see', 'movie', 'further', 'addressed', 'aspect', 'society', '********SPOILERS', 'BELOW********But', 'problem', 'directly', 'incident', 'visibly', 'shaken', 'store', 'get', 'paper', 'towels', 'when', 'other', 'lead', 'movie', 'so', 'distressed', 'CLEARLY', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'anyone', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'asking', 'what', 'wrong', 'what', 'happened', 'frankly', 'feel', 'advantage', 'situation', 'manipulating', 'having', 'breakfast', 'Claiming', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'Others', 'might', 'not', 'see', 'manipulative', 'bothered', 'how', 'whole', 'scene', 'later', 'ones', 'too', 'played', 'out', 'whole', 'opening', '20', 'minutes', 'was', 'frankly', 'distressing', 'ME', 'watch.As', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'elsewhere', 'rest', 'day', 'asking', 'do', 'things', 'favors', 'etc', '*he*', 'thinks', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'not', 'really', 'asking', 'what', 'once.The', 'scene', 'sister', 'was', 'awkward', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Not', 'only', 'how', 'how', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'towards', 'Michael', 'also', 'just', 'awkward', 'Ashley', 'felt', 'was', 'crappy', 'Michael', 'knowingly', 'walk', 'kind', 'situation', 'sister', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'part', 'trying', 'get', 'sympathy', 'Ashley', 'not', 'surprising', 'given', 'plot', 'twist', 'showing', 'got', 'deeper', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'plot', 'twist.I', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'ending', 'had', 'ended', 'when', 'walked', 'caf', 'eacute', ""'d"", 'have', 'even', 'been', 'happy', 'had', 'ended', 'confused', 'phone', 'call', 'friend', ""'d"", 'felt', 'trust', 'emotions', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'violated', 'was', 'confused', 'Hell', ""'d"", 'have', 'even', 'been', 'OK', ""'d"", 'decided', 'forgive', 'own', 'way', 'showing', 'up', 'sandwich', 'shop', 'claiming', 'needed', 'listen', 'explanation', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'sensitive', 'be', 'mature', 'try', 'see', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', 'come', 'back', 'day', 'day', 'can', 'say', 'STALKING', 'forgave', 'Nope', 'was', 'nail', 'coffin', 'there', 'ending', 'was', 'horrible', 'top', 'already', 'manipulative', 'selfish', 'premise.I', 'almost', 'wish', 'now', 'were', 'angel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'been', 'interesting', 'story']",N/A
