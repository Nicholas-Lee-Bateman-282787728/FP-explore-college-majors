1136560,ANUN5B8HYZXEJ,B0012EF7M4,Alexander Arsov,"[6, 6]","Finally, after the third watching, few words about ''Beauty as I see'' it from me too.I think the movie is quite remarkable and far more comprehensive than the other two I've seen:Gernot Friedel's''portrait'' of Karajan, sometimes titled ''So kann die Welt nicht bleiben'' but also issued under the title ''Maestro! Maestro!'', and Vojtech Jasny's short movie called ''Impressions'' (included as a ''bonus track'' on the DVDKarajan in Concert).Perhaps the title is a bit misleading since it might well lead one thinking it is solely dedicated to Karajan's music making and his interpretations, but it actually encompasses a great deal more, including his passion for planes and yachts, something about his last wife and his daughters, and other general biographical content. There are numerous commentaries from people who knew Karajan and worked with; they made quite an illustrious list: Christa Ludwig, Gundula Janowitz, Rene Kollo, Brigitte Fassbaender, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Sir Simon Rattle and a number of officials from almost everywhere Karajan left a trace that is not likely to fade with time: Wiener Staatsoper, Wiener Philharmoniker, Berliner Philharmoniker. The comments of these people range from very perceptive remarks to something very much like nonsense, but I am glad that the former far exceeds the latter.I have heard people called the movie something like ''mish mash"" and they certainly have a point here, but I suppose this is more or less inevitable. How can you give anything even remotely comprehensive about such personality and such life as Karajan's in just 90 minutes without being somewhat disorganized sometimes? Possible, but not very likely. Robert Dornhelm has done an excellent job. There is some rushing here and there, few moments are done in a haste, but all these are minor slips. On the whole the movie is fantastic and perfect for Karajan newcomers and Karajan buffs alike. It also fits perfectly my notion about Karajan and his life as a work of art which is not place here to elaborate upon.Perhaps one caveat that need be considered is that the movie, deliberately no doubt, skips most of the scandals normally associated with Karajan's name: the Nazi membership is barely mentioned, so are the scandals with Sabine Meyer and, later, with the Wiener Staatsoper. But it may be better not to elaborate on these ultimately unimportant matters. Still, there is one section in which several singers - Christa Ludwig, Brigitte Fassbaender and Rene Kollo - all talk about confrontations with Karajan but nothing of any consequence is said, especially about Maestro's role in them and his reactions. Frau Fassbaender looked dismayed that the next day after 20 hours flight to Japan she was summoned to piano rehearsal and what happened then that she was never invited again I couldn't understand. (But I guess this is the reason why the poor Brigitte aged so badly in the 30 years since the making of ''Das Rheingold''; she is all but unrecognizable here.) A gentleman from the Wiener Staatsoper, I think, whose name I forgot, mentioned that Karajan unconsciously radiated fear. Interesting observation; I wonder how much of this was founded on reality and how much was due to people's imagination. It seems to me that the notorious despotism of Karajan was actually little if anything more than very high artistic demands. He never spared and always gave 101% of himself into his work, so he thought he was right to demand the same from the people he worked with - and rightly so. As Sir Simon put it bluntly: ''He was a man completely without bull***t.'' (Apologies for the asterisks but you know how it is: the Amazon censorship never sleeps.) He certainly was. That Karajan had a tremendous impact on pretty much everybody who ever had any contact with min is hard to dispute. More debatable is if this impact was always positive and left the people spiritually enriched; not that it so much matters, but watching this movie it seems to me that that must have been so.Perhaps the most interesting part of ''Beauty as I see it'' are the excerpts from rehearsals. They range from black and white footage (Schumann's Fourth that is available complete on another DVD, I think), through Beethoven's Ninth in the late 1970s to Verdi's Requiem in the 1980s, together with bits from many Salzburg stagings including ''Fidelio'' (hilarious!), ''Die Walk&uuml;re'' (Karajan ''flying'' with the Valkyries), ''Otello'' (Karajan ''strangles'' Mirella Freni). These excerpts are all extremely funny and fascinating to watch, and make at least two things quite obvious to me: firstly, Karajan had a real passion for music, he was in love with it; whatever Karajan ever was, he was no humbug; (this, indeed, is quite obvious to me through Maestro's recordings as well, but a good many people seem to disagree on that point;) secondly, he had that all too rare and elusive quality called charm. And that is what must to my mind have been the main ingredient of Karajan's charisma: devastating natural charm that is simply irresistible. For all his ''no bull***t'' attitude Karajan, it seems, had a great sense of humour and even greater gift for mimicry and imitation that can make one laugh one's head off.The rehearsal of Verdi's Requiem is telling:Karajan [to Baltsa on the balcony]: ''If you don't look beautiful I'll turn the camera to me.''Baltsa gives him a glittering smile which prompts Karajan to make a most delightful, if very short, giggle. Then follow few grimaces that make the choir chuckle collectively and Jose Van Dam laughs outright. So, indeed, do I.Beethoven's Ninth is no less amusing:Karajan [during the last part]: ''Herr Kollo, Herr Kollo, Herr Kollo... Don't sing know, only the repetition.''Karajan [to the strings, last part again]: ''Now make that note especially beautiful. Otherwise it sounds like a coal sack thrown away from a train.''The comparison between Leonard Bernstein and Karajan at rehearsal is another riot to watch. Their manners are as different as their conducting in front of an audience, but there is one very important similarity: in both cases there is a lot of fun and, more importantly indeed, a great concentration, intensity and dedication to the music. As Christa Ludwig said: ''Bernstein was music himself, Karajan made music.'' During his rehearsal Karajan tells the very hackneyed joke about the Bundeskanzler who helped the old lady that had fallen on the ground; then she wanted to thank him but on his timid request for some votes on the next election she quipped: ''But I fell on my a***, not on my head!'' But he tells it so nicely that one can hardly help laughing with him.As for Bernstein, he is completely charming. Rehearsing Mahler with the Wiener Philharmoniker and as usually dancing on the rostrum: ''Ah, das ist kein Mahler... I don't care about your acht Stunde... [putting down the baton] Good! Cigarette!''Such bits can really make my day. There is also a charming episode with Yehudi Menuhin and with Karajan on the piano as well as several excerpts from interviews with him which are mostly basic biographical facts but it is quite another story to hear them from Karajan himself than from the music critic Joachim Kaiser, for example. Among parts of many commercially released videos of the Maestro, the movie is actually full of compelling bits of archive footage most of which I had never seen before. Karajan's conducting the Meistersinger prelude during the Nazi era, for instance; too short an excerpt unfortunately, but with immensely vigorous Karajan and spectacular sound for video from that time. (Apparently, the performance was never shot complete, alas.) There are touching moments of Karajan with his wife and daughters, fascinating shots of his houses in St. Moritz and Anif, and many, many more.The finale of the movie is incredibly moving. It starts with Karajan's famous speech on the New Year's Concert in 1987 which, regrettably and incomprehensibly, is cut from theDVD release; very emotional moment, Karajan obviously was deeply moved and he almost choked on the third ''Peace'' that ended his few words to the audience of one of the greatest concerts ever recorded. Then follow some poignant words from his wife and his daughters accompanied by the most suitable music for the occasion: Isolde's Liebestod with Jessy Norman (part only, alas, mostly audio). Karajan's distorted face after that performance, shining from the dark screen tells the whole story more vividly than the whole movie. I can't help thinking that the aged and hard to recognize Gundula Janowitz really hit the nail on the head with her description of the Maestro: ''One of the loneliest men I have ever known.''",5,"Somewhat misleading title, but a great documentary all the same",1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,8709,"['Finally', 'third', 'watching', 'few', 'words', 'Beauty', 'see', 'too.I', 'think',

1136561,A1R29FLZWPCURK,B0012EF7M4,George Goldberg,"[2, 3]","This is quite simply a magnificent film, the best biopic of a musician I have ever seen. It is also idolatrous, portraying von Karajan as nearly godlike; to which the justification is, he was. As some reviewers have noted, it does not deal much or at all with some of the less admirable aspects of his life - his membership in the Nazi party, his three marriages, his often vitriolic battles with his orchestras. No matter, for this is not a film about politics or domestic relations, it is a film about making music, and as such it succeeds magnificently.That does not mean it is perfect. There were features I did not like, especially the fast cutting from one speaker to another, often while music, gorgeous music was playing. Also, many of the excerpts were much too short - an egregious example was when Gundula Janowitz was singing the soprano part from the Brahms Requiem, a recording I happily own. After just a few bars, Christa Ludwig was on screen and talking over the music, which was emotionally jarring. But compensating for this shortcoming are the trailers - actually, an hour of extended excerpts from Supp&eacute;, Wagner (Das Rheingold), the Brahms Requiem, Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony, and Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto (scarcely ""trailers"" - actually more music than in the movie).Ludwig did mention one problem with von Karajan which seriously impacts his reception today: his tempos were often very slow, so slow singers had trouble holding the line. Today, no great conductor would slow things up to that extent, though then many came close. But criticisms aside, this is a very pleasant, even inspiring way to spend an hour and a half.

Martinez-Ybor ""Ignacio Martnez-Ybor""","[73, 73]","Robert Dornhelm's 92 minute film on the late, great Herbert von Karajan is informative, beautiful and elegiacal. More than any other question, it addresses what made Karajan (arguably) the supreme conductor of his generation and one of the towering musical figures of the twentieth century.  Much rehearsal footage is included, as well as incisive, on-point, commentary by Christa Ludwig, Gundula Janowitz, Helmut Schmidt, Seiji Ozawa, Christian Thielemann, Brigitte Fassbaender, Yevgeny Kissin, Rene Kollo, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Elizabeth Schwarzkopf and others (gratuitous flattery seems absent). Karajan himself talks a lot in interviews and interacting with orchestras in rehearsal, generating thereby a feel for his artistry, one so inextricably entwined with his personality that it was never a transferable ""method.""Robert Dornhelm's documentary is beautiful to look at, organized more thematically than chronologically.  It is not a biography, though biographical information is encompassed, including, i.a., his membership in the Nazi party and the row with the BPO over his appointment of Sabine Mayer as principal clarinetist. Karajan has said elsewhere that, earlier in his career, he aimed at a synhesis of the ""objectivity"" of a Toscanini and the passion and sponteneity of a Furtwangler; ironically, neither name is mentioned in the film.  Nor is there any discussion of his involvement in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra (of which he was principal conductor), originally a recording orchestra formed by Walter Legge for EMI, a rival firm to Deutsche Grammaphon who issued the DVD, though ample mention is made of Karajan's affiliation not only with the Berlin Philharmonic, of course, but also with the Vienna Philharmonic and La Scala (of which he was also music director), all with DG affiliations. Karajan left the London post when he became principal conductor of the BPO upon Furtwangler's death. These suspect omissions are, however, more peculiar than crippling.Most interesting is a whole section towards the end of the documentary juxtaposing the contrasting styles of Karajan and Leonard Bernstein (both DG artists, incidentally). It is really an illuminating sequence.There's loving participation by Karajan's widow and their two daughters.Hidden in the menu under the word ""trailers"" are extensive excerpts from released DVD Karajan performances, not truncated clips but whole excerpts, e.g. the final scene from Rheinegold, part of Brahms German Requiem, Jon Vickers doing Vesti la Giubba, von Supp&eacute;'s Light Cavalry, etc.Robert Dornhelm has put together an intelligent, beautiful documentary which will bring much repeated pleasure to anyone interested in 20th century classical music performance. Karajan is inescapable.  The b&w; rehearsal and concert film of Karajan and the Vienna Symphony (not the VPO) by Henri-Georges Clouzot is also warmly recommended.I need to acknowledge that since I was a teenager I have been an admirer of Herbert von Karajan's work and have had the pleasure, indeed privilege, of seeing him perform live in concert, in the opera house, and as harpsichordist (!) with a chamber ensemble.",5,Informative and Elegiacal,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,3158,"['Robert', 'Dornhelm', '92', 'minute', 'film', 'late', 'great', 'Herbert', 'von', 'Karajan', 'informative', 'beautiful', 'elegiacal', 'More', 'other', 'question', 'what', 'made', 'Karajan', 'arguably', 'supreme', 'conductor', 'generation', 'one', 'towering', 'musical', 'figures', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Much', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'incisive', 'on-point', 'commentary', 'Christa', 'Ludwig', 'Gundula', 'Janowitz', 'Helmut', 'Schmidt', 'Seiji', 'Ozawa', 'Christian', 'Thielemann', 'Brigitte', 'Fassbaender', 'Yevgeny', 'Kissin', 'Rene', 'Kollo', 'Anne-Sophie', 'Mutter', 'Elizabeth', 'Schwarzkopf', 'others', 'gratuitous', 'flattery', 'absent', 'Karajan', 'lot', 'interviews', 'interacting', 'orchestras', 'rehearsal', 'generating', 'thereby', 'feel', 'artistry', 'one', 'so', 'inextricably', 'entwined', 'personality', 'was', 'never', 'transferable', 'method', 'Robert', 'Dornhelm', 'documentary', 'beautiful', 'look', 'organized', 'more', 'thematically', 'chronologically', 'not', 'biography', 'though', 'biographical', 'information', 'encompassed', 'including', 'i.a.', 'membership', 'Nazi', 'party', 'row', 'BPO', 'appointment', 'Sabine', 'Mayer', 'principal', 'clarinetist', 'Karajan', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'earlier', 'career', 'aimed', 'synhesis', 'objectivity', 'Toscanini', 'passion', 'sponteneity', 'Furtwangler', 'ironically', 'name', 'mentioned', 'film', 'there', 'discussion', 'involvement', 'London', 'Philharmonia', 'Orchestra', 'was', 'principal', 'conductor', 'originally', 'recording', 'orchestra', 'formed', 'Walter', 'Legge', 'EMI', 'rival', 'firm', 'Deutsche', 'Grammaphon', 'who', 'issued', 'DVD', 'though', 'ample', 'mention', 'made', 'Karajan', 'affiliation', 'not', 'only', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'course', 'also', 'Vienna', 'Philharmonic', 'La', 'Scala', 'was', 'also', 'music', 'director', 'DG', 'affiliations', 'Karajan', 'left', 'London', 'post', 'when', 'became', 'principal', 'conductor', 'BPO', 'Furtwangler', 'death', 'suspect', 'omissions', 'are', 'however', 'more', 'peculiar', 'crippling.Most', 'interesting', 'whole', 'section', 'end', 'documentary', 'juxtaposing', 'contrasting', 'styles', 'Karajan', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'DG', 'artists', 'incidentally', 'really', 'illuminating', 'sequence.There', 'loving', 'participation', 'Karajan', 'widow', 'two', 'daughters.Hidden', 'menu', 'word', 'trailers', 'are', 'extensive', 'excerpts', 'released', 'DVD', 'Karajan', 'performances', 'not', 'truncated', 'clips', 'whole', 'excerpts', 'e.g', 'final', 'scene', 'Rheinegold', 'part', 'Brahms', 'German', 'Requiem', 'Jon', 'Vickers', 'doing', 'Vesti', 'la', 'Giubba', 'von', 'Supp', 'eacute', 'Light', 'Cavalry', 'etc.Robert', 'Dornhelm', 'put', 'together', 'intelligent', 'beautiful', 'documentary', 'will', 'bring', 'much', 'repeated', 'pleasure', 'anyone', 'interested', '20th', 'century', 'classical', 'music', 'performance', 'Karajan', 'inescapable', 'b', 'w', 'rehearsal', 'concert', 'film', 'Karajan', 'Vienna', 'Symphony', 'not', 'VPO', 'Henri-Georges', 'Clouzot', 'also', 'warmly', 'recommended.I', 'need', 'acknowledge', 'was', 'teenager', 'have', 'been', 'admirer', 'Herbert', 'von', 'Karajan', 'work', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'indeed', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'perform', 'live', 'concert', 'opera', 'house', 'harpsichordist', 'chamber', 'ensemble']",N/A

Here are the sweeping vistas of fog covered German landscapes ( rivers, mountains, cities) with the music of Beethoven, Wagner, etc wafting in and out of the narration.  Interspersed are interviews with Karajan, opera singers, musicians, and even a former German Chancellor. Then there are the terrific clips of Karajan's concerts and opera performances and the fascinating behind the scenes snippets of rehearsals where his drive for precision and exactitude reach the level of fanaticism.  One hundred and ten percent German !!What I really liked about this film was the inclusion of Leonard Bernstein ( Karajan's contemporary and co-holder with Karajan of 'worlds greatest conductor' title) showing him at reherasals and performances illustrating the complete antipodal personalities of these two men. It was a wonderful contrast. The  precise German machine and the fast and loose American inconoclast. Both at the peak of their abilities. Both world famous. And each arriving at music greatness through diametrically opposite methods.The only improvement I would make to this film is I wish they had allowed certain pieces of music to play out for just a few minutes longer to heighten the dramatic effect even more. They stopped certain pieces at exactly the point where, as a music lover, you are on the edge of your seat. But nevertheless this is a must have film for classical music fans.",4,Well done...,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,1578,"['saw', 'TV', 'last', 'night', 'producer', 'director', 'program', 'have', 'created', 'Germanic', 'tone', 'poem', 'Max', 'Reinhardts', '1936', 'movie', ""'Midsummers"", 'Night', 'Dream', 'film', 'Here', 'are', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'fog', 'covered', 'German', 'landscapes', 'rivers', 'mountains', 'cities', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'Wagner', 'etc', 'wafting', 'narration', 'Interspersed', 'are', 'interviews', 'Karajan', 'opera', 'singers', 'musicians', 'even', 'former', 'German', 'Chancellor', 'Then', 'are', 'terrific', 'clips', 'Karajan', 'concerts', 'opera', 'performances', 'fascinating', 'scenes', 'snippets', 'rehearsals', 'where', 'drive', 'precision', 'exactitude', 'reach', 'level', 'fanaticism', 'One', 'hundred', 'ten', 'percent', 'German', 'What', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'inclusion', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'Karajan', 'contemporary', 'co-holder', 'Karajan', ""'worlds"", 'greatest', 'conductor', 'title', 'showing', 'reherasals', 'performances', 'illustrating', 'complete', 'antipodal', 'personalities', 'two', 'men', 'was', 'wonderful', 'contrast', 'precise', 'German', 'machine', 'fast', 'loose', 'American', 'inconoclast', 'peak', 'abilities', 'world', 'famous', 'arriving', 'music', 'greatness', 'diametrically', 'opposite', 'methods.The', 'only', 'improvement', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'wish', 'had', 'allowed', 'certain', 'pieces', 'music', 'play', 'out', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'longer', 'heighten', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'even', 'more', 'stopped', 'certain', 'pieces', 'exactly', 'point', 'where', 'music', 'lover', 'are', 'edge', 'seat', 'nevertheless', 'must', 'have', 'film', 'classical', 'music', 'fans']",N/A
1136564,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B0012EF7M4,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[5, 6]","Robert Dornhelm's film Beauty As I See It is a compelling, ambitious documentary on the life and career of the late conductor Herbert Von Karajan, who, more than any other musician of the twentieth century, made an obsessive, downright bizarre fetish of surface beauty in musical interpretation.A billion words have probably been written about Karajan, from the adulation of Richard Osborne, who surprisingly wrote the fairly well balanced biography, ""Karajan, a Life in Music,"" to Norman Lebrecht, author of the intentionally provocative ""The Maestro Myth"" who sometimes likens Karajan to Lucifer himself.  2009 is the centenary of Karajan's  birth and, predictably, the Berlin celebration has garnered intense praise and intense criticism.Karajan (who died in 1989) left far more audio recordings and filmed performances than any other conductor in history. His last series of films, for Sony, were produced, edited, and directed by himself, sparing no expense. Karajan is often lit from below, like a descending deity. This was the conductor's final valentine to himself.Karajan's Nazi Party membership; his marriage to his second, Jewish wife (which predictably hurt his career in the Third Reich); his influential promotion of the compact disc format; his alleged homosexuality; and his divisive, bitter struggle with his beloved, yet misogynistic Berlin Philharmonic over his attempt to appoint a female clarinetist are either glossed over or are not covered at all in the film.Still, despite these glaring omissions, Beauty As I see It probably comes closer to capturing the conductor's paradoxical, obsessive nature than any other of the numerous films. Karajan was an autocrat who, upon being told he had been appointed director for the BPO, said, "" I shall be a dictator"".  Karajan was mercenary in his business dealings and died a near billionaire. Stories about his superstar celebrity abound. A taxi driver picks up Karajan after a concert and asks, ""where to?"" Karajan replies, ""it doesn't matter, I'm wanted everywhere"".Karajan's nepotism, vanity, and egotism are not shied away from. His determination to completely dominate the musical world is well on display, as are accusations that he showed more surface style than substance.  This accusation would seem apt. After all, Karajan was a sadistic bully, surrounded by sycophants, and tolerated no argument, no opposition, no other opinions. The Berliners were used to his predecessor, a director who valued their artistic input, would look them intensely in the eyes, and considered every performance a collaboration. Karajan closed his eyes to his players, completely drawn into himself. The performers' artistic input was not welcome.  The Philharmonic's previous conductor, Wilhelm Furtwangler, performed with his entire body, drenched in a bath of sweat. Every Furtwangler performance was likened to a church service. Karajan looked like an erect statue, with only the tips of his fingers in movement. A Karajan concert was the equivalent of being in a museum; quipped one critic, ""look, don't touch.""Yet, to dismiss Karajan's music making as all sheen is, in itself, an overly simplified, superficial evaluation. There was a Zen, cool-toned spirituality to Karajan's art. Sometimes, such as in baroque music, the result could be a laughable travesty, but despite his reputation of being in the German tradition, Karajan was really ultimate in the lesser known repertoire, such as the twentieth century music of Schonberg, Berg, Webern, a chamber-like, silvery Wagner, Mahler, Bruckner, Strauss and Bartok (the latter two he recorded for Stanley Kubrick in 2001 and The Shining) .Tellingly, Karajan refers to every recording he conducted as ""my music"" as there is little doubt that, at all costs, he was insisted on his own individualism and stamped everything he touched with it.  He never repented for his ancient Nazi past, dismissing it as simple career opportunity (although it did very little, if anything for him).  He often behaved like a Nazi, yet he could also be extraordinarily contemporary.The documentary contains valuable, newly released concert footage of Karajan in performance, including a disturbing one from the Nazi era. Couple that image with Karajan-the race car driver, pilot, business man, multi-millionaire, dictator, husband of a beautiful model, father of two daughters, latent homosexual, Zen Buddhist, filmmaker, and most prolific superstar conductor in history, and Beauty As I See it may not fully capture Karajan, but, amazingly, it comes close enough.*MY REVIEW ORIGINALLY APPEARED AT 366 WEIRD
