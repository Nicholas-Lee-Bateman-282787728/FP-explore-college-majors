It was excruciating to watch, while at the same time I couldn't stop - I had to know the outcome for this father and his children.  So much suffering and courage and raw human emotion is portrayed -- it moved me so deeply that I cried harder than any movie I've ever seen.  Mark Harmon is absolutely brilliant.  You feel his pain to the very depths of your soul. Seeing what the children endured is heartbreaking. If you are parent you will cry through to the end.  I've not seen the movie aired since I last saw it and can't understand why it is so elusive.  It is a phenomenal story that shows the most wonderful love of a father to his children. Once you watch it, you will never ever forget it.",5,Heartwrenchingly fantastic film,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,797,"['saw', 'movie', 't.v', 'twice', 'decade', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'describe', 'affect', 'was', 'excruciating', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'had', 'know', 'outcome', 'father', 'children', 'So', 'much', 'suffering', 'courage', 'raw', 'human', 'emotion', 'portrayed', 'moved', 'so', 'deeply', 'cried', 'harder', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'feel', 'pain', 'very', 'depths', 'soul', 'Seeing', 'what', 'children', 'endured', 'heartbreaking', 'are', 'parent', 'will', 'cry', 'end', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'aired', 'last', 'saw', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'elusive', 'phenomenal', 'story', 'most', 'wonderful', 'love', 'father', 'children', 'Once', 'watch', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'forget']",N/A

I don't recall another film affecting me so deeply. I hope that a digital version of this film may be released in the future. I agree with the other reviewers.

MARK HARMON MADE ME REALIZE THAT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING BAD ENOUGH, AND IF YOU STICK WITH TRYING TO GET IT, YOU WILL EVENTUALLY TRIUMPH.  THIS MAN LOST HIS CHILDREN TO THE SYSTEM IN 1930'S AMERICA.  HIS WIFE BECAME VERY ILL AND WOULD NOT SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.  SHE DIED AND THE FATHER WAS BLAMED FOR NOT GETTING HER TO THE HOSPITAL.  HE WAS TRYING TO RESPECT HIS WIFE'S WISHES EVEN THOUGH HE WANTED TO TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL.  BECAUSE OF THIS, HIS BOYS WERE TAKEN FROM HIM BY DECEITFUL MEANS BY THE SYSTEM.  HE SPENT YEARS TRYING TO GET HIS CHILDREN BACK AND HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT TO GET THEM BACK.  THIS IS A VERY SAD, HEART-RENDING MOVIE.  IT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOU SEAT.  YOU CAN'T HELP BUT ROOT FOR THIS FATHER EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.  MARK HARMON BROUGHT ALL TYPES OF DIMENTION TO HIS CHARACTER.  ORDER THIS MOVIE AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THIS MOVIE SINCE IT WAS MADE FOR TV IN THE EARLY 90'S, AND I CHECKED TO SEE IF AMAZON HAD IT.  THANK GOODNESS I DID BECAUSE I BOUGHT 1 COPY FOR ME AND 4 COPIES FOR MY 3 SISTERS AND 1 FOR MY MOM, WHO HAVE BEEN DYING TO GET THIS MOVIE ALSO.

This movie is a tearjerker for sure and very thought provoking.  The 1st time I saw it was on TV years ago and I only caught the end of it, so I had tons of questions running through my head; mainly just, &#34;WHAT happened????&#34;  Finally got it on VHS so I could watch the entire movie and I was shocked!  I cried buckets!!!  I was mad, too... and sad :0(  The things society and the courts can do to people is appalling and shocking to me. The day I watched this I was home alone and was a mess of tears and just crying my heart out when my husband came home from work... he asked, &#34;Who died?  Babes, what is the matter?  TELL me!&#34;  I was still numb and chilled to the bone by some of what I had seen.  The title says it all... and the father in this movie kept the promise in spite of all that transpired.
