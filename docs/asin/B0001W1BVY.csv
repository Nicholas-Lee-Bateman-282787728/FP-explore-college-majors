814840,A1QS2JDOY9RHSW,B0001W1BVY,A. Young,"[9, 9]","After reading the book that this movie was based on, I was excited to watch it.  The movie is a wonderful western, full of drama, action and of course romance.  However for years I have been reading up on Tombstone as well as the feud that happened there many years ago, I was dissapointed at how innacurate the movie was historically as well as from the book ""I Married Wyatt Earp"".  For example, Josie met Johnny first not Wyatt, that Josie had actually worked as one of the birdcage theater girls which is where her and Wyatt would meet most of the time and how after she first met Johnny she went home to S.F until Johnny sent for her to come to Tombstone.  Not to mention that the movie never focused on the fact that because her and Johnny lived together for sometime, Josie got to know many of the ""famous"" cowboys that the Earps were against.  The movie sadly focused on Josie and Wyatts time in Tombstone and portrayed her as a saint..which she was not.  There was more to Wyatt and Josie's life after Tombstone, which is what the book is really based on.I guess the bottom line is that for the price you can't go wrong.  It is a good western and is very entertaining to watch.  Marie Osmond as well as the other cast members do some wonderful acting, and the movie does help you to understand how the feud was probably started.  However, if you want to have an accurate historical account on Josie and Wyatt Earps life, purchase and read the book first and then watch the movie.  You'll get a whole lot more out of it that way.",3,Good movie...but not historically accurate.,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,1537,"['reading', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'excited', 'watch', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'western', 'full', 'drama', 'action', 'course', 'romance', 'However', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'up', 'Tombstone', 'as', 'well', 'feud', 'happened', 'there', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'how', 'innacurate', 'movie', 'was', 'historically', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'Married', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'example', 'Josie', 'met', 'Johnny', 'first', 'not', 'Wyatt', 'Josie', 'had', 'actually', 'worked', 'one', 'birdcage', 'theater', 'girls', 'where', 'Wyatt', 'would', 'meet', 'most', 'time', 'how', 'first', 'met', 'Johnny', 'went', 'home', 'S.F', 'Johnny', 'sent', 'come', 'Tombstone', 'Not', 'mention', 'movie', 'never', 'focused', 'fact', 'Johnny', 'lived', 'together', 'sometime', 'Josie', 'got', 'know', 'many', 'famous', 'Earps', 'were', 'movie', 'sadly', 'focused', 'Josie', 'Wyatts', 'time', 'Tombstone', 'portrayed', 'saint..which', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'more', 'Wyatt', 'Josie', 'life', 'Tombstone', 'what', 'book', 'really', 'based', 'on.I', 'guess', 'bottom', 'line', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'good', 'western', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Marie', 'Osmond', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'do', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'movie', 'help', 'understand', 'how', 'feud', 'was', 'probably', 'started', 'However', 'want', 'have', 'accurate', 'historical', 'account', 'Josie', 'Wyatt', 'Earps', 'life', 'purchase', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'way']",N/A

814842,A2RIRJJPGPMM8N,B0001W1BVY,Everyone's_a_critic,"[0, 0]","I came into this movie with low expectations, and that is exactly what I would recommend to anyone viewing 'I Married Wyatt Earp'. Temper your expectations, and then be prepared for some nice surprises.You must know that this is a made-for-TV-movie, and thus is shot in a made-for-TV-movie frame (no Panavision here), and makes use of a made-for-TV-movie musical score. And, it stars Marie Osmond. But having said all that I was quite delighted to find the film has a fair amount of gravitas and worth recommending. (parenthetically, it's a much better movie than that stupid looking box cover intimates. Marie looks like a mother upset with her child, and Bruce looks like the child, who just got busted with his hand in the cookie jar. It's definitely better than that!)In fact this version of the Wyatt Earp story might be a good entr&eacute;e for men wishing to entice a wife or girlfriend to sit through a Western. There's something for both sexes here. Marie Osmond's version of performer Josie Marcus, who goes on to marry Wyatt Earp, is that of a strong woman. But not the I-can-karate-chop-your-head-off-even-though-I'm-half-your-weight strong woman of today's Hollywood. No, she's got moxy, and she's not afraid to grab the reigns of a team of horses or pick up a rifle to hold the bad guys at bay... even though she knows nothing of either. For the men there are a number of tense moments of drama between the good guys and the bad guys, not only with firearms but with up close and personal stare down confrontations that rank as some of the best I've seen in all the Earp movies (I' can't believe I'm actually saying this).In terms of how accurate this movie was in portraying the actual events, I must confess that I have given up on that game. In going through the many Earp films I came to realize that the Wyatt Earp myth is just that... myth. It's become folklore. Sure, there were the original events in 1881, but that story soon became a legend, which evolved into a myth. Every telling of that myth is drawing from the 'template' or 'archetype' of the original circumstances, and each of these tellings in my view stands on its own. I watch a Wyatt Earp movie now for both entertainment as well as the lessons brought out. And believe me, each telling has its own lessons. It's great that all the Wyatt Earp movies are not the same.Whereas some Earp movies focus on, say, the relationship between Wyatt and Doc Holiday (My Darling Clementine, 1946 or Gunfight at the OK Corral, 1957), or the relationship between Earp and Ike Clanton (Hour of the Gun, 1967), instead 'I Married Wyatt Earp' focuses on Josie Marcus as she reacts to the very unfamiliar environment she has placed herself in, and the very different kind of men pursuing her (along with a sub-theme based on the conflict between Earp and Sheriff Behan).The rendering of events in this movie leaves no ambiguity regarding the Earps. They are cast as solid good guys with few if any shades of gray. We watch as Josie iterates from bad-guy Behan, whom she somehow does not recognize his slimy character for some time, to good-guy Wyatt, who must contain his desire for Josie due to his married status (like I said, pure good guy).As we approach the climax of the movie Josie attempts to be a voice of reason to the testosterone-fired men who see a gunfight to the death as the only viable solution. I liked they way they played this here because you get to see both sides of the coin. The idea of a group of men standing a few yards apart and shooting led into each other is arguably an insane act. It should be stopped! But on the other hand we're dealing with evil personified here, and the only way to be sure these bedeviled men won't hunt you and your family down however long it takes, each and every one of the bastards must be placed 6' below the surface of the earth.In other respects we get a standard issue telling of the story with the obligatory walk down Main St. to the OK Corral, and once there the shootout is staged more accurately than other renderings. The shootout itself is placed about 3/4 of the way through the film (unlike other versions where it occurs at the very beginning or very ending of the movie).The ending of I Married Wyatt Earp is different form any version I've seen. This is actually great because here is where the second surprise is delivered (the first being a much higher caliber film then anticipated); it's a very satisfying ending! Not as satisfying as the ending in Tombstone, but good.

814843,A16VMASAEPHIZN,B0001W1BVY,"Michael S. ""Michael S.""","[3, 3]","While this may be a ""must have"" movie for Marie Osmond fans it just lacks everything else.  The scenery is probably more ""period accurate"" than the sets in the movie Tombstone this film just lacks everywhere else.  And I would expect better acting from a high school drama cast.  Having watched all three of the current generation of Wyatt Earp movies (Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, I Married Wyatt Earp) I have to say that this is the worst of the three.  I find Wyatt Earp's biography fascinating.  Here's a man who was born in a time of no indoor plumbing, no roads, and everything west of the Mississippi just known as indian territory and who died in an era where there were automobiles, telephones, paved roads, metropolitian cities, and a more civilized society - what an interesting life he must have had!  I was hoping this film would explore the personna of Josephine Marcus Earp so I could learn more about her and the man she married.  Unfortunately it's just a re-hash of Wyatt Earp's life in the Tombstone era.  If you need to kill a lot of time watch ""Wyatt Earp"" with Kevin Costner.
