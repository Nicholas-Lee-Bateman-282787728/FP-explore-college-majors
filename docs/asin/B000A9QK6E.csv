924281,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000A9QK6E,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 9]","There are few films that are truly able to capture what it feels like to be addicted.  Probably the film that comes the closest and is the most compelling (albeit most disturbing) is `Requiem for a Dream'; at least in my humble opinion.  The little known gem that is `The Panic in Needle Park' comes very close though, for like `Requiem for a Dream', `The Panic in Needle Park' strips everything bare and delivers a very harsh reality to the viewer, exploring the depths that some will stoop to just to find their next fix.`The Panic in Needle Park' tells the story of Bobby, a young heroine addict who falls in love with Helen, a sweet and innocent young girl who is taken up by Booby's apparent bad boy persona.  He is new and interesting and unlike anyone she's ever really known before.  Sure, she's been around drugs but she's never really been exposed at such an alarming rate until she met Bobby.  Soon she becomes are addicted as he is, getting in and out of trouble with the cops as she peddles for Bobby, buys for Bobby and scores with Bobby.  Bobby's brother Hank isn't much help, for while he isn't as addicted as Bobby, his criminal activities leave him just as bad an influence.  As the film spirals towards its conclusion the lives of these two lovers become more and more disjointed and frantic and the panic sets in and the addiction takes over.The film is grim (no where near as grim as `Requiem for a Dream' so don't worry too much) and it's gritty delivery makes each and every scene seem as if it is really taking place (the lack of any musical soundtrack helps add a layer of reality to the film).  The performances really elevate the film as well, drawing the audience into the mental states of these star-crossed and ill-fated individuals.  Kitty Winn is marvelous as Helen, a truly devastating depiction of lost dreams and manipulated trust.  As she deteriorates due to Bobby's influence we watch her addictions take over her thinking and propel her in directions she never thought imaginable.  When she talks to Bobby at the prison, her face contorting to that of pain and misery you can see every fiber in her slowly fraying at the edges.  Al Pacino is also flawless as Bobby.  This is the performance that got him the coveted role in `The Godfather' saga; Coppola falling in love with Pacino's acting ability here.  He seeps effortlessly into the mind of an addict, conveying the hunger so readily and convincingly.  He is outstandingly sympathetic at one extreme and then harrowingly vile on the other.  He balances this very well in order to gain out acceptance and loyalty, much like Bobby gained that of Helen.In the end I must say that I am in awe of this film.  Like I mentioned, there are few films that can capture the heart of addiction with such fiery honesty, even though many films today try.  `The Panic in Needle Park' has such a rare truthfulness in its story and it rings forth with such power that one cannot help but become absorbed in its tale.  It is a hard film to watch because its misery is so real, but it is an important film to see for it sheds some light on the disease that takes so many victims today.",5,Honesty rarely hurts this much...,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3158,"['are', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'truly', 'able', 'capture', 'what', 'be', 'addicted', 'Probably', 'film', 'closest', 'most', 'compelling', 'most', 'disturbing', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'least', 'humble', 'opinion', 'little', 'known', 'gem', 'Panic', 'Needle', 'Park', 'very', 'close', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Panic', 'Needle', 'Park', 'strips', 'everything', 'bare', 'very', 'harsh', 'reality', 'viewer', 'exploring', 'depths', 'will', 'stoop', 'just', 'find', 'next', 'fix.', 'Panic', 'Needle', 'Park', 'story', 'Bobby', 'young', 'heroine', 'addict', 'who', 'love', 'Helen', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'taken', 'up', 'Booby', 'apparent', 'bad', 'boy', 'persona', 'new', 'interesting', 'anyone', 'ever', 'really', 'known', 'Sure', 'been', 'drugs', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'exposed', 'alarming', 'rate', 'met', 'Bobby', 'Soon', 'are', 'addicted', 'getting', 'trouble', 'cops', 'Bobby', 'Bobby', 'scores', 'Bobby', 'Bobby', 'brother', 'Hank', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', ""n't"", 'as', 'addicted', 'Bobby', 'criminal', 'activities', 'leave', 'just', 'bad', 'influence', 'film', 'spirals', 'towards', 'conclusion', 'lives', 'two', 'lovers', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'disjointed', 'frantic', 'panic', 'sets', 'addiction', 'over.The', 'film', 'grim', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'grim', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'gritty', 'delivery', 'scene', 'seem', 'really', 'taking', 'place', 'lack', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'add', 'layer', 'reality', 'film', 'performances', 'really', 'elevate', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'drawing', 'audience', 'mental', 'states', 'star-crossed', 'ill-fated', 'individuals', 'Kitty', 'Winn', 'marvelous', 'Helen', 'truly', 'devastating', 'depiction', 'lost', 'dreams', 'manipulated', 'trust', 'due', 'Bobby', 'influence', 'watch', 'addictions', 'take', 'thinking', 'propel', 'directions', 'never', 'thought', 'imaginable', 'When', 'Bobby', 'prison', 'face', 'contorting', 'pain', 'misery', 'can', 'see', 'fiber', 'slowly', 'fraying', 'edges', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'also', 'flawless', 'Bobby', 'performance', 'got', 'coveted', 'role', 'Godfather', 'saga', 'Coppola', 'falling', 'love', 'Pacino', 'acting', 'ability', 'here', 'effortlessly', 'mind', 'addict', 'conveying', 'hunger', 'so', 'readily', 'convincingly', 'outstandingly', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'extreme', 'then', 'harrowingly', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'order', 'gain', 'out', 'acceptance', 'loyalty', 'much', 'Bobby', 'gained', 'Helen.In', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'awe', 'film', 'mentioned', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'capture', 'heart', 'addiction', 'such', 'fiery', 'honesty', 'even', 'many', 'films', 'today', 'try', 'Panic', 'Needle', 'Park', 'rare', 'truthfulness', 'story', 'forth', 'such', 'power', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'absorbed', 'tale', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'misery', 'so', 'real', 'important', 'film', 'see', 'light', 'disease', 'so', 'many', 'victims', 'today']",N/A
924282,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B000A9QK6E,Blue Leaf,"[1, 1]","After watching the film I questioned why it is not talked about more. It is a stark, honest film with great photography of early 70's NYC Upper West Side. &#34;Needle Park&#34; is/or was the nickname of Sherman Square and a hangout for addicts, primarily heroin addicts, in the late 60's and 70's.The film is a great love story. It is story of the love addicts have for their next fix and how this love will always overshadow and win out over any human love.It stars Al Pacino, in his second role in film, as Bobby and Kitt Winn, as Helen, his seemingly lost and naive girlfriend. Kitt won the BEST ACTRESS award for this role at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. The film was written by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne and produced by the famous Dominick Dunne.Bobby meets Helen at his friend Marco's flat. Marco is played by a young and quite handsome Raul Julia. He is immediately smitten by her even though she is just lying sick on Marco's couch, recovering from a recent abortion. Marco is leaving the city for a while and after Helen ends up in the hospital after complications from the abortion Bobby begins to court her. She is in desperate need of someone to love and protect her and Bobby fits the bill perfectly.The rest of the film is about their lives together. As with most heroin addicts Bobby spends his days between searching for money for his next fix and getting high. Helen becomes more and more involved in the drug addict lifestyle which at first is exciting to her but ultimately pulls her into its seedy underbelly. I will stop it at that.I much prefer Pacino's acting in &#34;Panic&#34; over his role, the next year, in THE GODFATHER. I felt he really embraced the role and he came across genuine, realistic and not over-the-top as he does in many of his roles. There is a certain humbleness to his acting that we don't often see from him. Kitt Winn is an actress that had few film roles before or after this one. With all the critical acclaim she received for this film I question why she never became more popular. I am guessing it must have been her decision not pursue acting with more vigor but maybe someone here has some insight into why we don't see her in more movies in the 70's and 80's after this stellar portrayal.NOTE: While reading about this film I found an interesting fact that Jim Morrison of The Door's was the first choice for the role of Bobby.",5,One of the Best Portrayals of Heroin Addiction,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,2392,"['watching', 'film', 'questioned', 'why', 'not', 'talked', 'more', 'stark', 'honest', 'film', 'great', 'photography', 'early', '70', 'NYC', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side', '34', 'Needle', 'Park', '34', 'is/or', 'was', 'nickname', 'Sherman', 'Square', 'hangout', 'addicts', 'primarily', 'heroin', 'addicts', 'late', '60', ""70's.The"", 'film', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'love', 'addicts', 'have', 'next', 'fix', 'how', 'love', 'will', 'always', 'overshadow', 'win', 'out', 'human', 'love.It', 'stars', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'second', 'role', 'film', 'Bobby', 'Kitt', 'Winn', 'Helen', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'naive', 'girlfriend', 'Kitt', 'won', 'BEST', 'ACTRESS', 'award', 'role', '1971', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Joan', 'Didion', 'John', 'Gregory', 'Dunne', 'produced', 'famous', 'Dominick', 'Dunne.Bobby', 'Helen', 'friend', 'Marco', 'flat', 'Marco', 'played', 'young', 'quite', 'handsome', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'even', 'just', 'lying', 'sick', 'Marco', 'couch', 'recovering', 'recent', 'abortion', 'Marco', 'leaving', 'city', 'while', 'Helen', 'up', 'hospital', 'complications', 'abortion', 'Bobby', 'court', 'desperate', 'need', 'someone', 'love', 'protect', 'Bobby', 'bill', 'rest', 'film', 'lives', 'together', 'most', 'heroin', 'addicts', 'Bobby', 'days', 'searching', 'money', 'next', 'fix', 'getting', 'high', 'Helen', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'drug', 'addict', 'lifestyle', 'first', 'exciting', 'ultimately', 'seedy', 'underbelly', 'will', 'stop', 'that.I', 'much', 'prefer', 'Pacino', 'acting', '34', 'Panic', '34', 'role', 'next', 'year', 'GODFATHER', 'felt', 'really', 'embraced', 'role', 'came', 'genuine', 'realistic', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'many', 'roles', 'certain', 'humbleness', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'Kitt', 'Winn', 'actress', 'had', 'few', 'film', 'roles', 'one', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'received', 'film', 'question', 'why', 'never', 'became', 'more', 'popular', 'am', 'guessing', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'decision', 'not', 'pursue', 'acting', 'more', 'vigor', 'maybe', 'someone', 'here', 'insight', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'movies', '70', '80', 'stellar', 'portrayal.NOTE', 'reading', 'film', 'found', 'interesting', 'fact', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Door', 'was', 'first', 'choice', 'role', 'Bobby']",N/A

The comparison does not favor Panic. While Drugstore Cowboy feels like a story written by someone who really knows what it's like to be a junkie (it was), this tale feels like it was written by an intellectual who had never touched smack but thought it would be cool to write a story about strung-out people.  The whole thing feels affected, stale, acted out.  You can't help but love Al Pacino, overacting in an endearing way in the earliest days of his career.  And Kitty Winn, the actress who plays Pacino's partner in crime here, is cute and charming in a Margot Kidder/Karen Allen kind of way. But actors' charms aside, the film is bland and sterile.

924287,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000A9QK6E,David Baldwin,"[23, 28]","I was a little taken aback by the film's ""PG"" rating.  Drug use is treated frankly, there's some strong language and fleeting nudity.  But then I thought why shouldn't young people of a certain age see this film.  They are the most vulnerable in being ensnared into the drug culture and maybe they should heed the film's cautionary message.  I also found the timing of this film's release, 1971, interesting because it comes at a time when the drug culture was in full bloom and we were only a few years removed from ""Easy Rider"".  The selling point is, of course, Al Pacino who is nothing short of amazing as the small-time thief who goes from pecking to full-blown addiction.  I thought this was more Kitty Winn's picture, though.  Her character could be anybody's daughter who for reason's unknown takes up a serious drug habit.  The film is essentially a love story between Pacino and Winn's characters.  I couldn't decide whether the love between the two brought a little light to their dismal straits or that they were enabling each other into a worse addiction.  For obvious reasons the film's message is timeless because, unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world.

At that time, the area known as Sheridan Square was thought of as ""Needle Park"" because so many heroin addicts congregated there.  This is a film about heroin addiction but it is also a film about love and dependency which is as deeply moving as the several shock scenes of shooting up with close-ups of needles going into the skin.This film launched the career of Al Pacino in his first major role.  He is cast as a charismatic small time drug dealer and thief who wins his way into the heart of a homeless young woman from the Midwest  played by Kitty Winn.  She's lost her innocence already by the time she meets Pacino and he takes care of her in the aftermath a breakup with her artist boyfriend and a traumatic abortion.  Soon, they are a couple, falling in love, doing drugs together and supporting each other emotionally.  Naturally, the drugs take over their common sense and there is one horrific scene in which they buy a puppy in Staten Island but their needs drive them to do drugs in a restroom on the Staten Island Ferry, neglecting the puppy who falls off the ferry and drowns.The film is sad as the couple spiral even further downward, the young woman turning to first selling her body and then selling out on Pacino,  the love of her life.  How this all turns out is the stuff of pure drama with an ending that was more upbeat than I expected.

I am very happy to see that the DVD is available and I am buying one.I have not seen this since that first time, and it stands out in my mind like I saw it yesterday.  It is one of the most realistic films I have ever seen.  It could have been a documentary.  I lived in NYC for quite a few years and knew some people who were deep into the world of heroin.  I met a couple who had just ""discovered"" it, and as time passed I couldn't relate to them at all anymore, so we drifted apart.  The lifestyle and actions of the couple in ""Panic"" are so close to the couple I knew it is just amazing.  Then of course add Al Pacino's acting, and you have a movie that grabs your attention and keeps it through the entire film.One thing I like about the way the story is told is that I felt the same way about the young couple as I did the couple that had been friends of mine.  I knew that what they were doing was wrong, but I felt sorry for them.  The drug completely took over their lives, and as you see in the end, no matter what they have to do to get it, the other one understands and forgives - it is just part of their addiction.""Panic in Needle Park"" is outstanding, and it surprises me that you don't hear much about it these days like you hear about other classics that Pacino has made.

Betrayal runs rampant in needle park as narcotics detective Hotch played by Alan Vint (Badlands) tries to convince Helen to turn against Bobby.

Directed by Jerry Schatzberg (1973's Scarecrow, which also starred Al Pacino) and produced by the ""infamous"" Dominick Dunne, 1971's ""The Panic In Needle Park"" has become somewhat of a cult favorite for it's graphic depiction of drug usage in the under belly of New York's kitchen district.  A note of interest is Richard Bright's performance as Pacino's brother ""Hank"".  Bright (Once Upon A Time In America & The Sopranos) is probably best remembered for his recurring role as Micheal Corleone's henchman in all three of ""The Godfather"" films, and his classic role as the silent thug in 1976's ""Marathon Man"".
