My wife has wanted to see it for some time and I finally relented.Hell I wanted to see Charlie's Angels.  But I have to say that I was amazed at how good it was. I thought while watching it that it had a similar idea to Good Will Hunting. A movie that I only thought was ok and very over-rated. Maybe it just didn't connect with me like Finding Forrester did.  I thought the story was very clever, and above all the acting was incredible. The only one in the whole film who I thought was lacking was the love interest. Everyone keeps telling me how great she is because of The Piano. But her acting to me is dull, flat and utterly without emotion.  The film is a wonderful mix of drama, laughs and the human heart.

Rob Brown debuts as a high school student in the ghetto who is secretly a damn intelligent author in his own right. There's so much in this movie that's about writing and so much that isn't. Many themes I don't feel like spoiling, and you can find another review if you want plot spoilers. The writing is sharp, the language is clever, the characters are brilliantly portrayed, the dialogue is witty and observant, and the plot is surprisingly enjoyable to watch. F. Murray Abraham shines as a teacher I prefer not to emulate, and perhaps he got many of the best lines. This DVD is just perfect. Go get it.Oh, and let me talk about piracy. I bought my copy from Amazon. Region One only. China's Region Six. If I find a DVD player in China that will play only Region Six DVDs, then I've just been encouraged by the DVD people in the USA to buy a pirated DVD in China because that's the only way to watch the DVD here. In other words, this regional protection scheme encourages piracy. I hate that.

An unlikely relationship, to be sure, but they teach each other about life and soon become friends, with Forrester emerging from his shell and helping Jamal in his time of need. Finding Forrester has a lot of humor in it, and a lot of great drama. But the best part is the acting. It boasts three Academy Award-winners on its cast, along with a remarkable and heartfelt performance by newcomer Rob Brown, who does great in every scene. Connery is amazing, coming off performances in movies like The Rock and Entrapment, which were from okay to bad, he gives the best performance of his career. F. Murray Abraham has been great in everything he has ever been in (Last Action Hero pending), and this is no exception. This movie could have been perfect if maybe 15 or 20 minutes were trimmed, its a bit too long at nearly two and a half hours. However, it is an excellent movie and although the storyline is comprable to Good Will Hunting (it is impossible to write a review for this movie without mentioning GWH), its acting and humor are excellent, its writing and directing are great.

His name is Jamal Wallace, and he is a student in a public school in the Bronx. He loves basketball with great passion, and plays with great skill. He has a secret passion though, which is writing.Forrester is a reclusive , rather old white man, who stays in his apartment permanently. He has shunned modern day society, and lives a life of reading and spying with his binoculars and camera.Basketball provides the link between Jamal and Forrester. Eyeing the pickup games that Jamal and his friends play, Forrester becomes a mysterious figure in the teenager's eyes. They have heard strange stories about him, such as him murdering someone.Jamal's friends dare him to sneak into this reclusive man's apartment. Surreptitiously breaking in at night, Jamal is startled by a scream and runs off, leaving his backpack.If you want to learn how this unlikely friendship between them develops, I suggest you watch this movie. It's a very emotional movie, and a movie that inspires. It shows how one young black man's determination and talent brought success. I especially liked this movie because I like basketball, and reading. This movie has something that everyone can relate to. It's also a realistic movie, which is refreshing considering all the movies out. With an all-star cast (Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin) and a great storyline, this movie is sure to delight.",5,Wonderful movie,1053820800,"05 25, 2003",2003,1504,"['Finding', 'Forrester', 'movie', 'young', 'talented', 'African-American', 'teenager', 'who', 'friends', 'most', 'unlikely', 'person', 'name', 'Jamal', 'Wallace', 'student', 'public', 'school', 'Bronx', 'basketball', 'great', 'passion', 'plays', 'great', 'skill', 'secret', 'passion', 'writing.Forrester', 'reclusive', 'rather', 'old', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'apartment', 'permanently', 'shunned', 'modern', 'day', 'society', 'life', 'reading', 'spying', 'binoculars', 'camera.Basketball', 'link', 'Jamal', 'Forrester', 'Eyeing', 'pickup', 'games', 'Jamal', 'friends', 'play', 'Forrester', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'teenager', 'eyes', 'have', 'heard', 'strange', 'stories', 'such', 'murdering', 'someone.Jamal', 'friends', 'dare', 'sneak', 'reclusive', 'man', 'apartment', 'Surreptitiously', 'breaking', 'night', 'Jamal', 'startled', 'scream', 'off', 'leaving', 'backpack.If', 'want', 'learn', 'how', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'suggest', 'watch', 'movie', 'very', 'emotional', 'movie', 'movie', 'how', 'one', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'determination', 'talent', 'brought', 'success', 'especially', 'liked', 'movie', 'like', 'basketball', 'reading', 'movie', 'something', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'also', 'realistic', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'considering', 'movies', 'out', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'great', 'storyline', 'movie', 'sure', 'delight']",N/A

There should have been some comment from his mother about poets of color to create yet another dilemma in his world. Anna Paquin is a fine young lady but, I wish that interest would have developed only slightly more. She was obviously attracted to him for being the new phenomenon at the school as it is in real life.It attempted to do something in this film but it didn't quite finish. I agree with many others that attempts were made but the development of the possibilites did not happen. For somehing with a little drama it is worth watching. Not thrilling but a start.

578252,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005ASOC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Gus Van Sant is a strange director, in my opinion.  He goes for the guts one minute, staying true to his vision as a director and creating something that, while not wholly embraced, is at least admirable and then the next minute gets so commercial that any essence of his vision as a director is lost in the mix.  Sadly, you can't watch a film like `Good Will Hunting' or `Finding Forrester' and think they were made by the same guy who made such masterpieces as `To Die For' or `Elephant'.That said, `Finding Forrester' (and to a slightly greater extent `Good Will Hunting') are not bad films, but underwhelming and generic ones.  Some have given Van Sant credit for not making this `could be disaster' a complete clich&eacute;, but it's not like he breathed any freshness into it either.It's serviceable.On a dare, Jamal (a basketball player who can also write very well) sneaks into the apartment of a former famous author named William Forrester.  Forrester has become a reclusive grump of a man but this fluke meeting brings the two together.  Soon Forrester is helping Jamal hone his craft, giving him inspiration and proving to be a great `friend' in the end.Yeah, it's kind of schmaltzy no matter what anyone wants to tell you.The film has its moments, and it is a tad more honest and less clich&eacute;d (although Abraham's entire character is a clich&eacute;) as `Good Will Hunting' BUT the former had some fantastic performances that truly elevated the lackluster film.  This film, while containing some talent (I mean, Connery, Paquin and Abraham are all Oscar winners), fails to really capitalize on those strengths.  The performances are solid, but nothing revolutionary.  The best performance in the film comes from the one non-actor (well, Busta Rhymes isn't an actor either), Rob Brown, who carries the film with an earnestness reminiscent of Matt Damon's portrayal of Will Hunting.In the end, `Finding Forrester' is a tad too conservative to come from a man who has a following for throwing that said conservation out the window.  No, we should expect to see layers to an auteur and so we shouldn't expect every film to `feel' the same, but this doesn't feel like a film from a polished director.This kind of feels like `The Blind Side'.",3,Good Jamal Wallace...,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,2255,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'strange', 'director', 'opinion', 'guts', 'one', 'minute', 'staying', 'true', 'vision', 'director', 'creating', 'something', 'not', 'wholly', 'embraced', 'least', 'admirable', 'then', 'next', 'minute', 'so', 'commercial', 'essence', 'vision', 'director', 'lost', 'mix', 'Sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'think', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'such', 'masterpieces', 'Die', ""Elephant'.That"", 'said', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'slightly', 'greater', 'extent', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'films', 'underwhelming', 'generic', 'ones', 'have', 'given', 'Van', 'Sant', 'credit', 'not', 'making', 'could', 'be', 'disaster', 'complete', 'clich', 'eacute', 'not', 'breathed', 'freshness', 'either.It', 'serviceable.On', 'dare', 'Jamal', 'basketball', 'player', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'write', 'very', 'well', 'apartment', 'former', 'famous', 'author', 'named', 'William', 'Forrester', 'Forrester', 'become', 'reclusive', 'grump', 'man', 'fluke', 'meeting', 'two', 'together', 'Soon', 'Forrester', 'helping', 'Jamal', 'hone', 'craft', 'giving', 'inspiration', 'proving', 'be', 'great', 'friend', 'end.Yeah', 'kind', 'schmaltzy', 'matter', 'what', 'anyone', 'tell', 'you.The', 'film', 'moments', 'tad', 'more', 'honest', 'less', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'Abraham', 'entire', 'character', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'BUT', 'former', 'had', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'truly', 'elevated', 'lackluster', 'film', 'film', 'containing', 'talent', 'mean', 'Connery', 'Paquin', 'Abraham', 'are', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'really', 'capitalize', 'strengths', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'nothing', 'revolutionary', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'one', 'non-actor', 'well', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', ""n't"", 'actor', 'either', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'who', 'film', 'earnestness', 'reminiscent', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'portrayal', 'Will', 'Hunting.In', 'end', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'tad', 'too', 'conservative', 'come', 'man', 'who', 'following', 'throwing', 'said', 'conservation', 'window', 'No', 'should', 'expect', 'see', 'layers', 'auteur', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'feel', 'same', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'polished', 'director.This', 'kind', 'feels', 'Blind', 'Side']",N/A

But I think this movie also made me love Rob Brown, except of course he's way too young for me.This is one of those movies that's thoughtful rather than action-packed. OK, there are some basketball highlights here and there, but I could tolerate those because they were only highlights, and they even had enough respect for those of us who know almost nothing about the game to make it clear what was happening. After all, even I know that the point is to put the ball through the hoop.Jamal (Rob Brown) is 16. He's in a Bronx public school where he gets C-average grades and plays basketball very well. But New York state has proficiency tests they give to high school students, and the test gives away Jamal's big secret: he's very, very smart. His mother said he loves to read, and he is always writing something in these little notebooks he carries around. But she didn't know he was that kind of smart. In fact, he's so smart that a toney Manhattan private school wants him to come to them on complete scholarship, and of course play basketball for them as well.In an old apartment building (or perhaps a co-op; it's never clear) near where Jamal and his friends play basketball, there's an old man who looks out the window, and the kids all have these legends about him. He's a murderer who's hiding out. He was responsible for the disappearance of a teenage girl who lived in the building. They rarely see him, but they know he's at the window and he's watching them.One day, his friends dare Jamal to sneak into the old man's apartment and bring something out to prove he was in. He goes up the fire escape and in a window, and finds himself in a book-filled apartment. He sees an interesting curved knife on the desk, and has just zipped it up into his back pack then the old man (Sean Connery) suddenly pops up out of nowhere and scares him so bad he forgets his back pack and runs out of the apartment.The next day, his back pack is hanging in the window. When he fails to take the bait and go up for it, he finds it is thrown down onto the basketball court. When he gets home and unpacks his notebooks, and finds they are covered in comments, some extremely complimentary of his writing, some less so. He decides to go back and talk to the old man. But the old man puts him off, saying (through the locked door) that he should write 5,000 words on why he is going to leave the old guy alone. Oddly enough, Jamal does write such an essay, and takes it back.Little by little, Jamal and the old man become friends. Then when his English teacher at the prep school assigns the one novel by William Forrester, his wealthy friend gets a first edition and Jamal sees a photo of the young William Forrester. Sure enough, his old friend is William Forrester. (One advantage of using a very recognizable actor with a long career for such a story is plenty of good photos of him as a young man are available for such things.)Why is Forrester hiding from the world? Why did he only ever write that one excellent novel when he was in his 20s, and then never another? Why does he now undertake to help Jamal learn to write? Forrester does not want to talk about himself, but eventually we learn the answers to all these questions, and a few more we didn't know were there. Will the sweet young lady who just happens to be the daughter of one of the trustees defy her lily-white father and fall in love with Jamal? Will Jamal take the team to the regional championship?

Alone for most of his life, William Forrester has written one book, and that book became a phenomenal bestseller, capable of lasting through generations, and of supporting Mr. Forrester his whole life. Jamal Wallace is a young black boy living in the Bronx. Jamal loves to write, and it is through his writing that William and Jamal meet, and form a most unlikely team. Neither character believes their time spent together will be anything more than lessons learned from an old pro to a neophyte writer, but what evolves between them is a friendship so strong and so powerful, it will change each of them forever.

We find it hard to believe that housed in his head is an intellect much more formidable than any other skill of his.  Two big changes take place in his life: being mentored by Sean Connery's character, a reclusive fiction writer, and switching schools to a private one that is better able to handle all of his gifts.  Where it starts getting predictible is with F. Murray Abraham playing the boy's teacher.  Incredibly, Abraham is typecast here as Saleri again (from &quot;Amadeus&quot;) where he is consumed with envy over the boy's gifts, just like he was over Mozart's in that earlier film.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Finding Forrester (2000)Sean Connery is William Forrester, a brilliant novelist who published one book and then stopped publishing. Newcomer Rob Brown is Jamal Wallace. He is a black kid, or man of 16 years, living in the Bronx. He lives for basketball, but is a voracious reader, and he writes in journals. He keeps them in his backpack. He thinks he is a basketball player, but he was born to be a writer.On a dare, he is supposed to sneak into some old man's apartment, and steal something. He roams the house and takes a knife. He's about to leave when startled, he leaves his backpack behind. When he later recovers it, the writings in his journals have been red penciled. So begins an unlikely friendship. Or perhaps more of a student to teacher relationship.Meanwhile, when he excels on his test scores, he is offered a scholarship at the top prep school. It doesn't hurt that he is good at basketball, either. F. Murray Abraham is Prof. Robert Crawford. He is a bitter failed writer himself. He doubts that a basketball player from the Bronx can write so well, and he accuses him of plagerism.To further complicate things, Anna Paquin is Claire Spence, the daughter of a prominent faculty member. There is a lot of chemistry, biology, and physics, going on between them, if you solve my equation.Busta Rhymes is Terrell Wallace, Jamal's brother, who dreams of rap glory, but works in a parking lot. He is keeping it real.Sean Connery as Forrester is fabulous, always giving sage advice at unexpected times. Like this:Forrester: The key to a woman's heart is an unexpected gift at an unexpected time.Besides advice, the best thing Forrester does is encourage Jamal to write. He is like an athletic coach in his approach:Forrester: Punch the keys, for God's sake!I read somewhere that writing is the hardest thing to show in a movie, because it's not very dramatic to look at people typing. This movie breaks that rule, and gets away with it. It is the best type of typing scene since David Bowie danced on a giant typewriter in Absolute Beginners. And Forrester still with the pearls of wisdom teeth flowing:Forrester: No thinking - that comes later. You must write your first draft with your heart. You rewrite with your head. The first key to writing is... to write, not to think!There is a bit on Saturday Night Live with Will Ferrell as Alex Trebec, suffering through Celebrity Jeopardy, where the questions are dumbed down to the point that actors, not squirmy and obsessive fact nerds, can get them. Sean Connery is always depicted as a total bufoon. It was a recurring bit, and it always featured a parody of Sean Connery, who was always the most severly stupid contestant of a slew of Celebrity Jeopardy numbskulls. There is a scene where Forrester and Jamal are watching Jeopardy:Jamal: I'll take poor assumptions for $800, Alex.Such sweet, sweet, irony.Sean Connery gave a stellar performance. Wise, sage, but also an agoraphobic curmudgeon subject to the frailties of the flesh.Rob Brown more than kept pace with the seasoned pros. He was believable and authentic as a kid from the Bronx, on the basketball court, but he was just as believable in the classroom, as a literary enfante terrible.F. Murray Abraham was most excellent in his portrayal of Jamal's nemesis, Prof. Robert Crawford. Bitter and disappointed about his failure of a novel, he is jealous of Jamal's talent, and accuses him of plagarism. He is like Mozart's Saleri, a man of lesser talent who yearns to bring the angel Gabriel down. A man consumed with envy. I last saw him in Might Apphrodite, a Woody Allen film, and he was good there, too.Anna Paquin turns in her usual fantastic job as Claire Spence. There is an unspoken romance and unmistakable attraction, but nothing is ever acted on. Somehow, all the more tantalizing, but also a loose end that should have, could have, been sewn up.The music was fantastic as well. Lots of first rate Miles Davis music compliments Finding Forrester. It's a generous sampling of Davis's early 1970s work with side helpings of Ornette Coleman and guitarist Bill Frisell. With the help of Ron Carter, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Tony Williams, Miles Davis molded his second ""classic"" quintet into a earthshaking concoction of fonk and ruck far beyond the confines of the farthest reaches of fusion. Both ""Recollections"" and ""Lonely Fire"" are from Miles' Bitches Brew sessions and offer an atmospheric cocoon of cathedral ambience. This combined with Davis's polyrhythmic funk--""Black Satin"" from On the Corner--Ornette Coleman's alto sax--and Bill Frisell & Co's artful guitar noodlings make for a pleasant soundtrack indeed.SONG LIST OF THE SOUNDTRACK1.

In some ways it is like Good Will Hunting, which Gus also directed, with a story of a young genius finding his mentor. Gus Van Sant did a great job at putting it all together, and he also got great performances out of his actors. He seems to have a great feel for the Bronx, even if he never lived there himself. He shows remarkable empathy for all the people, and structures his drama masterfully--and no hidden agendas. Well done, my good fellow.TEN FILMS OF SEAN CONNERY, SEVEN OF THEM AS JAMES BONDThe Name of the Rose(1986) .... William of BaskervilleNever Say Never Again(1983) .... James BondZardoz(1974) ....

And while you're nitpicking about that, know that ""Hunting"" is also a variation of ""The Karate Kid,"" ""Scent of A Woman,"" ""Dead Poets' Society,"" and a film from the 60's, ""Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner."" So film plots borrow from one another. Just watch the sublime, tender, witty, beauty of this movie and judge it on its own merits and for yourself. The 'conjunction' sequence between Connery and Brown debating proper grammar is special. Or the scene at Yankee Stadium where a broken Connery delivers a monologue to Brown (which I think should've garnered him an Oscar nomination).

Miller ""Knitter and bookworm""","[0, 3]","Think &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; in the Bronx.The tried and true &quot;teacher-student relationship in which the teacher learns as much, if not more than the student&quot; resurfaces in this film, although Gus Van Sant gives it a new spin.  This time, the &quot;teacher&quot; is a misanthropic former wonder boy author, and the student is an inner city basketball player with an incredible talent for writing.Sean Connery and Rob Brown are very good as William Forrester and Jamal Wallace.  The role of Forrester allows Connery to go beyond his superhero pose, and Connery imbues the character with genuine human qualities.  He examines Forrester's wounds and eccentricities and lays them bare, but he also lets the character's arrogance shine through, exposing just enough to keep Forrester from being merely a crotchety old man.Of course, Forrester also happens to be Scottish, which isn't a huge stretch for Connery, and it allows him to plug his ancestral homeland, of course.  (An ancestral homeland he hasn't lived full-time in for over twenty years...But I digress...)Brown's intense, honest, understated performance is an excellent foil for Connery's occasional grandstanding.  It's not what Brown reveals, it's what he doesn't reveal that makes the performance noteworthy.  You can see the intelligence in Jamal's eyes, a difficult thing for any actor to convey.The problem with &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is that the film spends so much time developing the two main characters, everything else pretty much goes by the wayside.  The plot is conventional and predictable, and the supporting cast is pretty much forgettable.  Will Hunting's scrappy, sometimes obnoxious group of drinking buddies (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser) were some of the most memorable minor characters in recent film because they were so well developed, but Jamal Wallace's friends and family are barely given enough screentime to have a conversation with him.Other characters fare just as badly.F. Murray Abraham essentially reprises his role as the disgruntled, talentless composer Salieri in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, but this time, he plays a disgruntled writer who takes out his anger and disappointment on his students.  Unfortunately, Abraham is never given the chance to reach the emotional complexity of Salieri, reducing his role to an angry, jealous old has-been.Anna Paquin, one of the finer young actresses of the day, is basically wasted in the thankless role of Jamal's potential love interest, Claire, the upper class white girl.  Paquin is given neither the screen time nor the material to develop Claire into a remotely interesting character.  The film ends before it can delve into &quot;West Side Story&quot; territory.&quot;Finding Forrester&quot; has every intention to be something other than conventional.  Unfortunately, so much time is spent building up the relationship between the two main characters, there isn't enough film left to do anything new, and the final message is nothing that we haven't heard before.",3,it's nothing you haven't seen before,991094400,"05 29, 2001",2001,3038,"['Think', 'quot', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'quot', 'Bronx.The', 'tried', 'true', 'quot', 'teacher-student', 'relationship', 'teacher', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'student', 'quot', 'resurfaces', 'film', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'new', 'spin', 'time', 'quot', 'quot', 'misanthropic', 'former', 'wonder', 'boy', 'author', 'student', 'inner', 'city', 'basketball', 'player', 'incredible', 'talent', 'writing.Sean', 'Connery', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'William', 'Forrester', 'Jamal', 'Wallace', 'role', 'Forrester', 'Connery', 'go', 'superhero', 'pose', 'Connery', 'character', 'genuine', 'human', 'qualities', 'Forrester', 'wounds', 'eccentricities', 'bare', 'also', 'character', 'arrogance', 'shine', 'exposing', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'Forrester', 'being', 'merely', 'crotchety', 'old', 'man.Of', 'course', 'Forrester', 'also', 'be', 'Scottish', ""n't"", 'huge', 'stretch', 'Connery', 'plug', 'ancestral', 'homeland', 'course', 'ancestral', 'homeland', ""n't"", 'lived', 'full-time', 'twenty', 'years', 'digress', 'Brown', 'intense', 'honest', 'understated', 'performance', 'excellent', 'foil', 'Connery', 'occasional', 'grandstanding', 'not', 'what', 'Brown', 'reveals', 'what', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'performance', 'noteworthy', 'can', 'see', 'intelligence', 'Jamal', 'eyes', 'difficult', 'thing', 'actor', 'convey.The', 'problem', 'quot', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'quot', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'everything', 'else', 'pretty', 'much', 'wayside', 'plot', 'conventional', 'predictable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgettable', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'scrappy', 'sometimes', 'obnoxious', 'group', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'were', 'most', 'memorable', 'minor', 'characters', 'recent', 'film', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'developed', 'Jamal', 'Wallace', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'barely', 'given', 'enough', 'screentime', 'have', 'conversation', 'him.Other', 'characters', 'fare', 'just', 'badly.F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'essentially', 'role', 'disgruntled', 'talentless', 'composer', 'Salieri', 'quot', 'Amadeus', 'quot', 'time', 'disgruntled', 'writer', 'who', 'out', 'anger', 'disappointment', 'students', 'Unfortunately', 'Abraham', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'reach', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'Salieri', 'reducing', 'role', 'angry', 'jealous', 'old', 'has-been.Anna', 'Paquin', 'one', 'finer', 'young', 'actresses', 'day', 'basically', 'wasted', 'thankless', 'role', 'Jamal', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Claire', 'upper', 'class', 'white', 'girl', 'Paquin', 'given', 'screen', 'time', 'material', 'develop', 'Claire', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'can', 'delve', 'quot', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'quot', 'quot', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'quot', 'intention', 'be', 'something', 'other', 'conventional', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'building', 'up', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'enough', 'film', 'left', 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'final', 'message', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard']",N/A

The young man, Jamal Wallace, touchingly played by Rob Brown, has a real talent for basketball but loves books and words; then a strange twist of fate causes him to meet a strange neighborhood resident who is thought by some to be a ghost.This reclusive man, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery, is in a position to help Jamal begin to realize his dreams.

It is somewhat similar to Good Will Hunting, but I found this plot more interesting, and less predictable.The storyline basically follows the bond that forms between the two main characters.  I think that the stark contrast between these two(old white reclusive man vs. young black charismatic boy) really adds an intesting angle to the story.  The idea that two very different people can build a relatioship from a common passion (in this case writing) is a fascinating idea.I also like the fact that the films does get into racial issues (stereotypes, mixed race couples, athletes and academics), but they do not form the nucleus of the plot.  Instead, the film focuses more on what it becomes to become great in one's passion, and the risk required to develop a relationship with someone who isn't like you.  The director does a great job weaving these two concepts together throughout the story.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Good Will Hunting.

In FINDING FORRESTER I could identify with the two central characters' passion for writing, for telling a story, conveying a fresh point of view, recharging creative batteries.  This beautiful film was like a taste of sweet nectar.The story is more than compelling.  Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) is an inner city teenager living in the Bronx with a declared passion for basketball--a secret passion for writing.  He makes mediocre grades in school so as not to call attention to his phenomenal writing ability.  A boyish prank suddenly thrusts him into the life of William Forrester (Sean Connery), a disgruntled, bitter, reclusive author living in a shabby third-floor apartment.  Forrester has published but one novel, half a century ago, a Pulitzer Prize winner.  He recognizes Jamal's talent, becomes his mentor.  The dialogue between the two characters as they discuss writing is powerful, mesmerizing.  As the story unfolds, Jamal proves to be as much of a mentor for William Forrester as the aging author is to his teenage friend.  The ending is tender, bittersweet.F.

Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin are a winning combination.  Dialogue is crisp, honest, biting.  An embittered professor who duels mercilessly with his students in class because of his own past failure as a writer is the protagonist.

It is a film which examines a curious friendship which is forged between a young black youth (Jamal, played by Rob Brown) and an aging, reclusive white author (William Forrester, played by Sean Connery).The movie invokes the directorial talents of Gus Van Sant, and there are a few obvious parallels between it and &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; also directed by Van Sant. To SOME extent, Jamal is the liberal arts counterpart to the math/science extraordinaire that Matt Damon played in &quot;Hunting.&quot; However, while he is precocious, Jamal is not quite the &quot;giant among giants&quot; type of genius depicted in Damon's persona.However, what Jamal is is a young, gifted youth who has a whole lot of potential. The one thing he lacked all his life was intellectual direction. He is well-read, but never had any one to help him hone his writing skills. After stumbling across a one-hit-wonder author (Forrester never attempted to publish a 2nd book), he comes to understand that he has found the catalyst for his future success as a serious writer.This film succeeds brilliantly in its presentation of liberal arts as being an under-used nexus between societies, cultures and socio-economic classes. What keeps coming back again &amp; again throughout the film is just how uniquely human the art of literature is. The fact that Jamal is an athelete as well as a scholar is a refreshing touch, especially considering how most Hollywood movies portray intellectuals as being stereotypical &quot;nerds.&quot;The one factor which precluded my giving this movie 5 stars was its articulation of the relationship between Jamal and Claire. It was obvious that both characters wanted a romance with the other, but the relationship never really went anywhere. By the end of the movie, it seems that the writers forgot about her entirely. Don't get me wrong: I am not asking for a cheesy love scene, or even a kiss. I would have just liked to know what happened. Claire's disappearance from the movie was a bit odd, and it left the story incomplete.Other than that aspect, this is a worthwhile DVD to buy. Connery's performance, as usual, is breath-taking.

578291,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,B00005ASOC,Earl Hazell,"[0, 0]","I often wondered whether this movie would only be both fully forgiven for its flaws and appreciated for its strengths by frustrated novelists and authors like yours truly.  Lines like Jamal's to Sean Connery: ""So women will sleep with you just if you write a book?,"" answered with, ""Women will sleep with you if you write a BAD book..."" go straight to the heart, and made me laugh out loud (much to the chagrin of my girfriend).  Luckily, the star of this film is not Sean Connery or the new actor in the supporting/main role.  The star is not the setting in New York, nor is the film stolen by the master character actor F. Murray Abraham.  The film's star isn't the screenplay, despite some of its stellar moments.  And for ... sure it ain't the editing, which had me straining the forgiveability factor at times; it went a little past the attempt at purposely looking rough and raw to just being rough and raw as if we were looking at an unfinished film made by college students.The start of this film is the relationship between the two characters, who thankfully transcend the easily formulaic aspects of their surface identities and pre-prescribed social roles to become true artists and powerful friends.  True, they had no choice but to go there:  a simple and simple-minded ""experienced but fatally flawed reclusive White intellectual saves a ghetto Black youth with uncommon promise"" would have had the effect of filming an upper middle class cocaine party in the suburbs for the benefit of undercover detectives.  A majority White audience would have gotten high off of both the liberal guilt transformed via it cathartically dancing with the hypo-cortical (smile) feelings of racial superiority that produced it, but they would have been too ashamed at getting busted after the fact by the Black intelligentsia for the movie--or today's culture--to escape unscathed or anyone to enjoy the memories. And reality is reality: THE KARATE KID and GOOD WILL HUNTING are both such wonderful variations on the unlikely mentor/student of life theme that you don't need to see anyone miss at another attempt at equalling them, let alone surpass them--and they would have to be equalled for the film to be entertaining.  (Particularly when, in this racial surface context, a director will be immediately accused of the sin of commission delineated a few sentences above, even if he simply committed the sin of ommitting the spark of new life that would prevent it from being valid.)That is what makes this movie so special.

578293,A1L0HZI35HF8OF,B00005ASOC,Eric V. Moye,"[9, 11]","One of the few films I have left recently glad I spent the money! Too bad there were not a few car crashes, shoot-em-up scenes so that my sons would want to see it!Through a chance encounter, the young man from the South Bronx, and the recluse from two or three decades earlier become friends. Interestingly, it is hard to judge who benefits the most from this unusual friendship, which in spite of the differences, grows into one of mutual respect.Sean Connery can do very little wrong, and this to me is his best role since the award winning performance as the seasoned old Chicago cop in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; He is perfectly cast as Forrester. Another reviewer was correct: he really has to work at letting the tough exterior(hiding all manner of bizarre vulnerabilities) break down, and when he does, we see the maturation of a grown man just beginning become open to the trust in, reliance upon and assistance to his newfound friend.The film has several high points, not the least of which is the well deserved come-uppance Connery gives F. Murray Abraham (who is splendidly cast as a jerk of an English teacher who accuses Robert Brown of plagiarism). This is most reminiscent (to me) of the similar scene with Al Pacino from &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, but Connery has so much more power (enough which spares him the need to shout) in this dramatic display of friendship. Ditto the scene at Yankee Stadium where we first see how much Brown's character Jamaal does for Connery's Forrester.I was pleased to see this film avoid the cliches that Hollywood cannot seem to resist when attempting t portray young African Americans. Additionally, I was pleased not to see the interplay with Anna Paquin (the eager young prep school girl with the &quot;concerned&quot; father) turn to the inevitable sex/race clash.As another said, this is a must see for people (not just  children) who have trouble coming to grips with any on a number of God given abilities.This film was much to good for the lack of popular appeal it experienced, and is far too good to let go by. No heart pounding action, and nothing to maker the viewer jump up and high five the next person.

An underprivileged youth is discovered by a reclusive genius and is shepherded to his full potential.  What GWH was to math, this film is to literature.  They are such close cousins that Van Sant felt compelled to bring in Matt Damon for a cameo.Regardless of the familiar plot, ""Finding Forrester"" succeeds because of an excellent screenplay and outstanding acting performances by Sean Connery, Rob Brown and F. Murray Abraham.  This kind of story can't help grabbing the audience at a human level.  Genius, suppressed by societal class, struggles to emerge and it beats the odds.  The story is transcendent for both the main characters.  Forrester (Sean Connery) helps Jamal (Rob Wallace) transcend his societal constraints to realize his potential as a writer, and Jamal helps Forrester to transcend the constraints of his emotional traumas to free him as a human being.  It is a triumphant story, very uplifting.Van Sant does a good job of presenting the human element and developing the characters while keeping the photography effective but in the background.  The photography is very straightforward, allowing the characters to tell the story without the intrusive use of stylish shots that are all to prevalent lately.  Van Sant gives Forrester's apartment a dark and dreary look from a color and lighting perspective, which is particularly effective.Sean Connery is in top form and continues to make the case for being one of our best and most treasured actors.  He gives a virtuoso performance in this film with a complex and ornery character.  It is a powerful and moving portrayal.  Rob Brown is phenomenal in his first feature film.  He was found in a talent search and made an impressive debut with an extremely mature performance.  With the right scripts, he has a good chance of having a bright future.  F. Murray Abraham is fantastic as the haughty English teacher, who gets his just deserts.This is a highly intelligent film with a strong story, steady direction and marvelous acting.  I rated it a 9/10.  Despite an all too familiar storyline, it differentiates itself by its wide-ranging excellence.

Finding Forrester introduced Rob Brown, a natural on the big screen, and put him with veteran Sean Connery. The two had great chemistry on screen together and it brought a fun reality to the film. Finding Forrester was fantastic. It was one of the best films of the year, in my opinion. I would recommend this to anyone from 15 years old to 50 years old. It is probably not one for the younger kids though. It has pretty heavy language for a PG-13 film. Aside from the continuous language, the PG-13 rating reflects some sexual references.

578307,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005ASOC,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This film is a lot more than the story of a black boy from the Bronx finding his full realization in both basket-ball and creative writing. This film is a lot more than the skimming of black public high schools by white private high school to find the winning sportsmen they need. This film is a lot more than the story of a black teenager who finds his mentor, a father substitute since he has no father and his elder brother is not the model he wants, in a famous and yet totally marginal writer, Scottish by origin and bird-loving by choice and passion. This film is a lot more than the exacting tyrant a failed writer can become when he decides to compensate his failure in writing by becoming a creative writing and literature teacher. And this film is also a lot more than the phenomenal emotional shock it is for an aging man, diagnosed with cancer, entirely solitary and marginalized to find by accident and the insistence on the side of the foundling, the younger man who is going to be his follow-up next generation. He gets out of his cocoon. He gets out of his seclusion. Even so much that he will save his foundling from academic probation and even open up the door to his future. This film is all that together and a lot more. It is the story of loyalty, commitment and yet betrayal and salvation. Deeply emotional all along the film gets to a poignant ending when the death of the older man is announced by a lawyer to the younger man, and when this younger man is given the full legacy of the older man: the keys to the older man's den and sanctuary in the Bronx, a final farewell manuscript letter and the manuscript of his second and posthumous novel to be prefaced by the younger man. The racial problem is dealt with delicately but thoroughly showing how little race has to do with creative imagination, or even plain human love, but also that it has a lot to do with some preconceived ideas that a black basket ball player cannot be a creative writer of any excellence. A film to watch several times just for fun and emotional inspiration. You can always trace and track all the visual or situational allusions to many other films, like Matt Damon as a young lawyer. I have seen that somewhere else. Solve the many riddles of the type like the older man on his old fashioned bike cycling to the private school to save his black younger friend from ostracism and rejection.

Not only is it funny because it's Connery using modern day slang, it's also because the usage of the word ""dog"" went out of style faster than...well, it never was cool to say.  The saying, however, is as timeless as ""more cowbell"" and ""My name is Inigo Montoya..."" - it just gets better each time it's heard.Another classic line is when Connery belts out, ""PUNCH the keys for God's sake!""  It's not quite up to YTMND standards, but PTKFGS is nonetheless hilarious.The movie itself is highly inspirational and entertaining.  William Forrester (Connery) is a reclusive, agoraphobic, Pulitzer Prize winning author living in Harlem.  He's somewhat of a neighborhood boogeyman, and one day a prodigous yet troubled talent named Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) dares to sneak into the apartment.  Forrester scares him away, and in his haste, Wallace drops his backpack with his writings.  Some time later the work is returned, but all the papers are edited and reviewed.  In no time at all, the two are friends, Forrester is reviewing all of Wallace's work, and the two famous lines are uttered.The struggle and relationship between student and teacher is truly fabulous to watch in this movie.  And when Wallace attempts to help his teacher, or to coax out any sort of information, there is a palpable tension.  The true battle eventually unfolds between Wallace, his school, and his professor, where someone must sacrifice in order to help the other.I highly recommend this movie in every circumstance.

He remains in the home of his youth, despite the fact that over time it has changed from a middle class white neighborhood into a overall low income area in which the Black families that live in the area are struggling just to get by.He meets a prodigy by the name of Jamaal, a young Black man who is in the prime of his High School career and is both a great athlete as he is a great writer. Jamaal suffers from what many other youth suffer from, he fears to be alienated simply because he is smart and enjoys literature. Jamaal is given a scholarship to a top tier NY private school and learns that life is not as different as many thought between the white and black worlds, just different means to the same ends.Jamaal becomes Connery's pupil and learns to truly express himself via his writing, and while he learns about himself, he forces Connery's to do the same and the two not only become friends, but conquer some of the true challenge's that life presents.This is a great film, something everyone could enjoy.

A refreshing change (and relief) from action adventure, teenagers in love, special effects, or comedy romance. Rob Brown, who played Jamal, was so natural that it is incredible to believe that this was his first ever acting role. Either he's a natural, or else he just played himself!! Sean Connery, wonderful as always...and it was nice, for another change of pace....However, the movie could have been great. Some of the moments were too cliched, and didn't need to be. Jamal losing the basketball game was a little bit much. That scene didn't even need to be in the movie. Also, I can't figure out why Forrester had to die. It made no sense. It could have ended right after the writing contest, when they say good-bye and Forrester takes off on his bicycle.

578322,A1JCOLQL6ENZJG,B00005ASOC,KC Reviews,"[1, 1]","I really enjoyed this movie. I feel that both Sean Connery's and Rob Brown's performances were fantastic. The interactions between the two gave it a sense of originality while the concept of teacher student has been done an infinite number of times. However, the writers bit to deep into the formula in my mind.Here is the formula for writing a teacher-student story. First, you take intelligent and either misunderstood or misguided child. Make them a tad bit precocious intellectually. Then you take injured teacher. This injury can either be physical (like Mel Gibson's Man without a Face) or psychological (as agoraphobia is here). Then you put the youth in the unexpected pathway and viola drama ensues. Oh wait I forgot the key outcome. While the youth will succeed and learn, it is the injured teacher that is healed in the end.Great basic plot. You can write about a million of these, and perhaps they have. But, I think what frustrated me most was the insistent of the writers to digress into 60's &amp; 70's theme in a movie about a new generation. I think the fact the Brown character is a black youth from ""the `hood"" may be inspirational to some, I felt like it was trying to latch on to the boogie man of racism to make the film effective rather than developing strong characters. In addition, I found the use of the Paquin character a bit annoying on the same vein-Oh her daddy doesn't want her to date Jamal.There is so much potential here to make a good story relying on good character interplay... I think Good Will Hunting demonstrates that really well, where the hardship is derived from the characters' lives not from the use of oblique racial commentary. In fact, I feel cheated because it was the easy way in my mind because so much symbolism comes easy.I really liked this movie. The dialogue and the acting were really solid. I only wish the writers would have worked harder and looked beyond the skin color and into what makes people interact.",4,Great Acting...

Well directed by Gus Van Sant, the film revolves around the two main characters, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery, and sixteen year old Kamal, played by Rob Brown.William Forrester is a writer who, battling his own inner demons, has remained reclusive after writing a Pulitzer Prize winning novel some forty odd years earlier. Living alone in a changing neighborhood in the Bronx, he makes the acquaintance of Kamal, an intellectually gifted inner city kid, who plays street basketball, loves to write, and does both well.A mentoring relationship springs between the two. Under Forrester's secret tutorship, Kamal blossoms. When Kamal's scholastic test scores come to the attention of a local prep school, school officials offer him a scholarship to attend and, if he chooses to do so, play basketball on the school team. The school also turns out to be William Forrester's alma mater, where he is revered and his prize winning novel is required reading.There, Kamal encounters rank racism, all the more insidious because it is covert. F. Murray Abraham plays a teacher who is very similar to the character, Salieri, whom Abraham portrayed in the film ""Amadeus"". A failed writer who became a teacher, Abraham oozes racism as he contrives to destroy Kamal whom he accuses of plagirism, as he clearly believes him to be just another inner city, black basketball player who is incapable of anything more. He cannot seem to fathom that this kid could possibly write as well as he does, because he has Kamal stereotyped.Yet, Kamal is actually all that he puports to be, a gifted writer who just also happens to play basketball. Truly scholarly, he shows up his teacher in class, only to further exacerbate his emnity. This teacher's dislike and covert racism manifests itself in the exclusion of Kamal's entry in the prestigious writing competition sponsored by the prep school. This situation comes to a head when the teacher's racism is exposed for what it is in a stunning, surprising climax.Kamal, however, is not the only one to have a moment of redemption in the movie. Forrester, too, has that moment as he comes to grips with his past, the past that made him shut the world out for so long. It is his friendship with Kamal that illuminates his return to the very world from which he had withdrawn long ago.This film is about a friendship that is borne out of a shared passion. It is about the old nurturing the young. It is about passing the baton from one generation to the next. It is a film the transcends age and race.

More than teaching, a mentor relationship is one in which both parties learn from each other, and each is sustained and made stronger by their bond with the other.No doubt, you think the veteran Sean Connery can portray this.  Long a leading man, recently a character actor, Connery, however you may like or dislike him as a star, is a consummate actor.  Rob Brown is a revelation; a 16 year old non-actor who has the utmost confidence in himself, and portrays it on the screen, both as his character, Jamal, and as a true partner to Connery in their shared scenes. It will be a shame if the industry does not find more roles for a youngster with such raw talent and screen presence.A quiet film that embraces both sport and literature, and brings to life many elements of the city of New York (although mostly filmed in Toronto!), FF will touch your mind and your heart.Many reviewers have compared it to &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, but it perhaps is ahead of them (Gus Van Sant  using hindsight?) in that there is so much texture to the simple life of Jamal before he encounters William Forrester, in his friendships, his family, his incredible thirst for knowledge through reading and writing, his love of hoops.  One feels that Jamal would have succeeded on almost any level without Forrester, and is only enriched by his encounter.  For Forrester however, it is life, rediscovered.A terrific cast, a fitting score and camerawork, with perhaps not enough special features to make it a top-drawer DVD, Finding Forrester is high on my short list of favorites for the year 2000.

Rob Brown is also excellent in the role and surprisingly good since he is apparently a non-actor. The relationship that develops between the two unlikely friends grows out of their love of books and writing, and they come to like and respect each other despite the cultural and generational gap that exists between them. F. Murray Abraham is also great playing the villain as usual who wrongly attempts to get Rob expelled for an infraction, when Connery suddenly comes to his aid at the climax. This reminded me of the final scene in ""Scent of a Woman"" in which Al Pacino comes to the aid of Chris O'Donnell at his exclusive New England private school. A little piece of trivia--did anybody notice the ending music during the credits with the Jamaican steel drum band? It was the same music used during the credits in the Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek movie, Badlands, about two serial killers in South Dakota back in the 50's. I loved that music but have no idea about how to get ahold of it, and I was amazed to find it by chance in this movie. The only reason I don't give the movie more stars is that it just doesn't seem to get off the ground dramatically, but maybe I just don't appreciate the director's naturalistic, low-key style, since that could have been what he intended.

But Van Sant was careful enough to maintain things at a resemblance level, only picking up the best elements from his own masterpiece (in fact, more like the masterpiece of Matt Damon -who happens to play the minor role of a lawyer in this movie- and Ben Affleck, authors of the script). The script for 'Finding Forrester' instead puts out there the name of an amateur script writer and not-so-amateur News Director from Oregon: Mike Rich.The movie is centered in the Bronx, where a gifted high school student and neighborhood basketball star Jamal Wallace (played by young talent Rob Brown) begins an interesting friendship with a former literary star turned hermit, William Forrester (played by Sean Connery). The relationship between the very mature sixteen-year-old and the seventy-plus-year-old author evolves as Wallace earns the respect and trust of Forrester, as a result of the his brightness and candor, in the midst of a most adverse environment.As Wallace experiences the chance of a lifetime in the form of a scholarship to one of the most prestigious private high schools, he is faced with a human feeling he was not as used to in his poor Bronx: envy. The envy of another just-as-talented basketball player, and that of his bitter and not-so-brilliant literature teacher, Robert Crawford, notably played by F. Murray Abraham. Abraham is an actor that has already performed roles of this sort, such as Antonio Salieri in 'Amadeus' so you can guess that he does this extremely well.Connery's performance, as usual, was flawless, and so was Brown's. All these performances along with the script, one which deserves the highest praise, make very upsetting the fact that the movie went so unnoticed when it was playing in Theaters.

For one thing, it's often such a cerebral subject, and movies demand action. Another problem is that a literate script is a prerequisite. Most movies today don't require this, which results in a lot of screen writers who are long on concept and short on verbal skills. Mike Rich, the man who wrote Finding Forrester, does have writing skills and manages to give us a story that is reasonably compelling. The movie falls short of greatness because it is too long and because the ending is a formula one. but it still manages to be touching and full of hope. It also has a unique view of what it is like to be an intelligent young black man in America that I found to be both interesting and enlightening.To his friends and fellow high school student, Jamal Wallace [Robert Brown] is just nice guy who is very good at basketball. He has secret life that he hides from them. He is an avid reader, and he is constantly writing in his journals. In an old third-story apartment overlooking the public basketball court where Jamal and his buddies play, there lives a recluse. They've never seen him, but they have caught him peering at them from a window. That's why they call him The Window. One day the guys dare Jamal to sneak into the apartment and steal a souvenir. He does this and is caught by The Window, who turns out to be old man. In fleeing, Jamal leaves his backpack behind. The next day he sees it hanging from the man's apartment window. He retrieves the backpack, and when he gets home, he discovers that the journals that were in it have been read. Passages have been marked indicating what the man did and did not like. This begins an extraordinary friendship. Later Jamal will discover that the man is Robert Forrester, a writer who published one novel, gained fame and the Pulitzer prize, and then suddenly vanished. Jamal, Forrester will conclude, has the ability to become a great writer, but will the boy, who is also capable of being a basketball star, have the courage to become one?Sean Connery sparkles as Forrester. He gives us a memorable character who discovers that there is still a spark of hope within his world-weariness. Robert Brown, who has never acted before, is a great find. His Jamal is street-smart, yet obviously worthy of a fuller life. F. Murray Abraham plays an English teacher who is a failed writer and, therefore, thinks Jamal's work is too good for the boy to have done it himself.Some reviewers have stated that Finding Forrester is unrealistic except in the basketball scenes In doing so, they have helped to prove one of the movie's major points. A subtle racial prejudice still exists, even among some of the most urbane and educated people. It implies that a major sports career is perfectly suitable for a bright young black man. Indeed, it is an acceptable and lucrative way to make a living, but that subtle prejudice whispers that that's the summit for a black man or woman, that to aspire for more is to expect too much. I don't believe that's true, and I thought the movie told a story that was entirely possible.",4,"Strong character development, fine performances",1016236800,"03 16, 2002",2002,3134,"['must', 'be', 'hard', 'do', 'successful', 'movie', 'literary', 'world', 'one', 'thing', 'often', 'such', 'cerebral', 'subject', 'movies', 'demand', 'action', 'problem', 'literate', 'script', 'prerequisite', 'Most', 'movies', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'results', 'lot', 'screen', 'writers', 'who', 'are', 'long', 'concept', 'short', 'verbal', 'skills', 'Mike', 'Rich', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'have', 'writing', 'skills', 'manages', 'give', 'story', 'reasonably', 'compelling', 'movie', 'short', 'greatness', 'too', 'long', 'ending', 'formula', 'one', 'still', 'be', 'touching', 'full', 'hope', 'also', 'unique', 'view', 'what', 'be', 'intelligent', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'America', 'found', 'be', 'interesting', 'enlightening.To', 'friends', 'fellow', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Jamal', 'Wallace', '[', 'Robert', 'Brown', ']', 'just', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'basketball', 'secret', 'life', 'avid', 'reader', 'constantly', 'writing', 'journals', 'old', 'third-story', 'apartment', 'overlooking', 'public', 'basketball', 'court', 'where', 'Jamal', 'buddies', 'play', 'recluse', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'have', 'caught', 'peering', 'window', 'why', 'call', 'Window', 'One', 'day', 'guys', 'dare', 'Jamal', 'sneak', 'apartment', 'steal', 'souvenir', 'caught', 'Window', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'old', 'man', 'fleeing', 'Jamal', 'backpack', 'next', 'day', 'hanging', 'man', 'apartment', 'window', 'backpack', 'when', 'home', 'journals', 'were', 'have', 'been', 'read', 'Passages', 'have', 'been', 'marked', 'indicating', 'what', 'man', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'friendship', 'Later', 'Jamal', 'will', 'discover', 'man', 'Robert', 'Forrester', 'writer', 'who', 'published', 'one', 'novel', 'gained', 'fame', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'then', 'suddenly', 'vanished', 'Jamal', 'Forrester', 'will', 'conclude', 'ability', 'become', 'great', 'writer', 'will', 'boy', 'who', 'also', 'capable', 'being', 'basketball', 'star', 'have', 'courage', 'become', 'one', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'sparkles', 'Forrester', 'memorable', 'character', 'who', 'still', 'spark', 'hope', 'world-weariness', 'Robert', 'Brown', 'who', 'never', 'acted', 'great', 'find', 'Jamal', 'street-smart', 'yet', 'obviously', 'worthy', 'fuller', 'life', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'failed', 'writer', 'therefore', 'Jamal', 'work', 'too', 'good', 'boy', 'have', 'done', 'himself.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'unrealistic', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'helped', 'prove', 'one', 'movie', 'major', 'points', 'subtle', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'still', 'even', 'most', 'urbane', 'educated', 'people', 'major', 'sports', 'career', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'bright', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'Indeed', 'acceptable', 'lucrative', 'way', 'make', 'living', 'subtle', 'prejudice', 'whispers', 'summit', 'black', 'man', 'woman', 'aspire', 'more', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'true', 'thought', 'movie', 'told', 'story', 'was', 'entirely', 'possible']",N/A

A kid from a rough neighborhood and an old man with former ambitions meet and both their lives are completely turned around. The boy realizes that he is smarter then his former bad grades let on and the old man learns that he can still find a life past his recent failures. Good Will Hunting, right? Well, yes, but it is also the basic premise for Finding Forrester. Though the story is tweaked a bit and toned down from the R-rated Hunting, Forrester does come off as being a little too familiar, being released around three years after the Miramax feature, but can the similarities really hurt it? In actuality, not really. There have been plenty of Dead Poet Society knock-offs that have made pretty decent coin at the box office in recent years but none of them equal the quality of the original. So in essence there is both a good side as well as a bad side to this situation. Can Forrester break this trend? History is against the film but Connery is pretty select on his choice of scripts, so there is at least some hope for it.The story is pretty much the same as Good Will Hunting minus the witty charm of Ben Affleck and Robin Williams. William Forrester, a vibrant writer from New York, wrote the great American novel nearly four decades ago but ever since then he has basically vanished from the face of the earth. Or so many people thought. A sixteen year old student named Jamal Wallace meets up with the famous author when he breaks into his apartment one night and leaves his backpack behind. Jamal is amazed to find that his writings are returned with corrections made to the documents. When Mr. Wallace is accepted to an elite Manhattan prep school, he returns to the old recluse seeking help and inspiration for writing. After some time Mr. Forrester agrees but on two conditions: Jamal can not tell anyone about the whereabouts of William Forrester and no questions on why he only wrote one book. As time goes on they begin to look beyond the stereotypes they once believed and teach each other something about life. The story for Finding Forrester is quite well done despite borrowing several influences from the previously mentioned Good Will Hunting. If you are literature buff then you will greatly enjoy some of mentioned works in the film. If you're not then you will find the several scenes a bit confusing but your overall experience shouldn't be greatly affected.Though the cast is a relative bunch of no names, the leading roles, for the most part, perform exceedingly well. Sean Connery shows that he can still act off much younger co-stars amazingly well as he does with Rob Brown. Connery really showcases a former writer who had enough of what society thought his book was about and sunk into a deep depression especially after the loss of the several members of his family. The most enchanting scenes with the veteran actor have to be him riding his bicycle through the streets of New York. It seems so awkward that it becomes quite charming and heart-warming to witness in this feature. Rob Brown, as ill experienced as he may be, does a wonderful job considering he is performing opposite one of the prominent veteran actors of our time. One of the few flaws in the film has to be the character played by Anna Paquin, who recently appeared in the summer hit, X-Men. It has nothing to do with the performance, Paquin did an excellent job with the material that was given to her, but has rather to do with the character itself. The film suggests a growing romantic relationship between her and Brown's character but once the main premise of the feature rises to its climax, the whole romantic side story disappears completely.Overall, Finding Forrester managed to do what many of its predecessors couldn't by actually being entertaining despite borrowing several elements from critically-acclaimed Good Will Hunting. One those borrowed elements would have to be the talented actor Matt Damon, who cameos as Mr. Forrester's lawyer near the end of the feature. The timing and way the scene was handled made the cameo quite a delight considering thoughts of Hunting had to be on the minds of many movie-goers. The few problems with feature would have to include the longer then needed time length and some side stories including the romantic relationship between two characters that aren't explored fully in the film.

578340,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00005ASOC,Mike Stone,"[1, 3]","""Finding Forester"" starts with a shot of a clapperboard, clearly showing director Gus Van Sant's name and the title of his movie.  Right away, the fact that this is a make-believe story is brought to the audience's attention.  Couple this with the liberal use of the song `Over the Rainbow' -- the most famous movie song about ideal, make-believe worlds  -- and I got the distinct impression that Van Sant was trying to make excuses for this maudlin, almost cliched narrative.  ""Watch me undermine my own Hollywood film,"" he appears to be saying.  ""It may be trite, but at least I know that it's trite.  Forgive me, please.""Whatever, Gus.  You protest too much.  I still liked your film.The buzz on this movie is that it's nothing more than ""Good Will Hunting II"" (Van Sant recognizes this fact, with an obvious and unintentionally hilarious ""GWH"" reference in the film's epilogue).  I agree that it shares some cosmetic qualities with that film (bearded mentor counsels brilliant but troubled young man, against a background of poverty and academia), but ""Forester"" has enough unique qualities that the comparison becomes unnecessary.  First, the prodigy's genius is in his writing, and not in numbers.  It's a more dangerous proposition, because while most people wouldn't recognize a flawed mathematical equation, we can all spot bad writing.  Van Sant knows this, and tries to keep the examples of William Forester's and Jamal Wallace's writing hidden.  A wise move, because when we are finally exposed to them, it's quite dreadful.While the narrative moved forward with powerful (and often contrived) thrust, the movie felt overlong.  I noticed many sequences composed of purely visual montages that felt overlong by half.  I think Van Sant could have used the services of a more judicious editor.  He seemed to fall in love with the images of New York's streets and its inhabitants.  That's fine for setting up the context of the story, but should have been abandoned once the story got going.The acting, overall, was a mixed bag.  F. Murray Abraham as the villain professor was way over-the-top.  Sure, he was menacing, but with no real substance to back it up.  Anna Paquin as the love interest showed considerable charm and eccentricity, but her role was little more than a device.  She's a two-dimensional character at best.  Busta Rhymes as Jamal's older and wiser brother, has charisma to burn.  But the man is not a good actor.  He's at his best in a scene at the dinner table, when he breaks out in a spontaneous rap about his job as a parking attendant.  In smaller parts, Michael Nouri (as a wealthy alumnus) and the man who played the basketball coach were both horrible and distracting.  Thankfully, these performances don't distract from the powerful leads.Sean Connery is not a great actor.  He has not the depth and subtlety that the job requires.  But he is a star, and shows why here.  His William Forester chomps scenery as if it were saltines, dwarfing everyone around him.  And I could listen to Connery read the phone book, with that addictive Scottish accent of his.  He's perfect as the boozing J.D. Salinger-esque recluse, a man who can dominate a room by just raising one of his disheveled eyebrows.Ron Brown is a revelation as the young prodigy who comes to Forester for guidance.  He is a perfect contrast to Connery.  He never tries to do too much, is always composed, coiled, contained, and charismatic.  And oh yeah: he's utterly believable.  I've heard it said that this young man, with gifts of genius on the basketball court and at the typewriter, was just too much to believe.  Well, I believed it.  And I give full credit to Brown, who's asked to carry the movie his first time out, and never drops the ball.",4,Finding Brown,988675200,"05 1, 2001",2001,3749,"['Finding', 'Forester', 'shot', 'clapperboard', 'clearly', 'showing', 'director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'name', 'title', 'movie', 'Right', 'away', 'fact', 'make-believe', 'story', 'brought', 'audience', 'attention', 'Couple', 'liberal', 'use', 'song', 'Rainbow', 'most', 'famous', 'movie', 'song', 'ideal', 'make-believe', 'worlds', 'got', 'distinct', 'impression', 'Van', 'Sant', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'excuses', 'maudlin', 'almost', 'cliched', 'narrative', 'undermine', 'own', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'be', 'saying', 'may', 'be', 'trite', 'least', 'know', 'trite', 'Forgive', 'please', 'Whatever', 'Gus', 'protest', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'liked', 'film.The', 'buzz', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'II', 'Van', 'Sant', 'fact', 'obvious', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'GWH', 'reference', 'film', 'epilogue', 'agree', 'shares', 'cosmetic', 'qualities', 'film', 'bearded', 'mentor', 'counsels', 'brilliant', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'background', 'poverty', 'academia', 'Forester', 'enough', 'unique', 'qualities', 'comparison', 'unnecessary', 'First', 'prodigy', 'genius', 'writing', 'not', 'numbers', 'more', 'dangerous', 'proposition', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'flawed', 'mathematical', 'equation', 'can', 'spot', 'bad', 'writing', 'Van', 'Sant', 'tries', 'keep', 'examples', 'William', 'Forester', 'Jamal', 'Wallace', 'writing', 'hidden', 'wise', 'move', 'when', 'are', 'finally', 'exposed', 'quite', 'dreadful.While', 'narrative', 'moved', 'forward', 'powerful', 'often', 'contrived', 'thrust', 'movie', 'felt', 'overlong', 'noticed', 'many', 'sequences', 'composed', 'purely', 'visual', 'montages', 'felt', 'overlong', 'half', 'think', 'Van', 'Sant', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'services', 'more', 'judicious', 'editor', 'seemed', 'fall', 'love', 'images', 'New', 'York', 'streets', 'inhabitants', 'fine', 'setting', 'up', 'context', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'abandoned', 'story', 'got', 'going.The', 'acting', 'overall', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'villain', 'professor', 'was', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'Sure', 'was', 'menacing', 'real', 'substance', 'back', 'up', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'love', 'interest', 'showed', 'considerable', 'charm', 'eccentricity', 'role', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'device', 'two-dimensional', 'character', 'best', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', 'Jamal', 'older', 'wiser', 'brother', 'charisma', 'burn', 'man', 'not', 'good', 'actor', 'best', 'scene', 'dinner', 'table', 'when', 'out', 'spontaneous', 'rap', 'job', 'parking', 'attendant', 'smaller', 'parts', 'Michael', 'Nouri', 'wealthy', 'alumnus', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'basketball', 'coach', 'were', 'horrible', 'distracting', 'Thankfully', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'powerful', 'leads.Sean', 'Connery', 'not', 'great', 'actor', 'not', 'depth', 'subtlety', 'job', 'star', 'why', 'here', 'William', 'Forester', 'scenery', 'were', 'saltines', 'dwarfing', 'everyone', 'could', 'listen', 'Connery', 'read', 'phone', 'book', 'addictive', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'perfect', 'boozing', 'J.D', 'Salinger-esque', 'recluse', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'dominate', 'room', 'just', 'raising', 'one', 'disheveled', 'eyebrows.Ron', 'Brown', 'revelation', 'young', 'prodigy', 'who', 'Forester', 'guidance', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'Connery', 'never', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'always', 'composed', 'coiled', 'contained', 'charismatic', 'oh', 'yeah', 'utterly', 'believable', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'said', 'young', 'man', 'gifts', 'genius', 'basketball', 'court', 'typewriter', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'believe', 'Well', 'believed', 'give', 'full', 'credit', 'Brown', 'who', 'asked', 'carry', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'never', 'ball']",N/A

However that dare will change both Jamal's and Forrester's lives. As Forrester helps Jamal in bringing out his writing talents and both show each other two very different aspects of the world. Finding Forrester is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. Though its not a fast paced drama, that really doesn't matter because everything else in the film was implemented perfectly. Sean Connery does an incredible job as Forrester and is flawless throughout. This is one of Connery's most powerful performances. The star power and experienced acting of Connery didn't suppress newcomer Rob Brown who played Jamal. This was Rob Brown's first film and even before being cast he had no acting experience whatsoever. The performance that Brown puts on could fool anybody into thinking he has had some experience in the past, this young talent may just be a natural actor. Guess this film brought out a hidden talent of his. Busta Rhymes also stars in this drama and he actually isn't bad as Jamal's brother or friend, not exactly sure which one.

Indeed Rob Brown does a good job with it, being this his first movie ever, but Sidney Poitier or Morgan Freeman he ain't. Let's wait and see how he grows, possibly also on stage as well as on camera, to see if he's really worthy to be called an actor. F. Murray Abraham does a good job, but doing what? What he has always been doing, the bad, sadistic and twistedly jealous mentor. Wouldn't it be refreshing to see him do something totally whacky just for once? I felt he was wasted once again by the movie machinery...Connery is always good in whatever he does, but at times this bothers me, because he could do much better still. In this one, produced by him, he rather prefers to lean back and watch others work. I simply can't see him as a weak character. His true stamina and adrenalin is always overcooking. I could've seen an older William Hurt playing Forrester, but Connery?

The movie is portrayed as a matter-of-factly of a 16 years old African American boy, Jamal living in the Bronx.  He deliberately passed his grades simply rather than excelling in the exams &amp; shooting hoops in order to fit in with his peers but his hidden potential was soon discovered by an elite school in the nation's bursary which offered him a free scholarship.  In a dare with his friends, Jamal sneaked into William Forrester's (depicted brilliantly by Sean Connery) apartment &amp; by accident, a lifelong frienships ensued.  Jamal's significant improvement in his grades raised suspicion from his teacher (potrayed well by Murray Abraham).  As William put to Jamal's succinctly, a good teacher could either be very effective or very dangerous &amp; soon enough, Jamal was at the receiving end of the teacher's wrath for being too good.  Naturally, race issue was touched upon, &amp; the awkwardness of Jamal to date a white woman (acted by Anna Paquin) with a rich background was displayed not by words but by those silent moment &amp; brief glances.  Towards the end, it all came to a climax with a predictable but resounding ending.  A movie that deserved to be savoured slowly &amp; the message shines thru, that if you have a dream, pursue it albeit how late it is as long as you pursue it.  A cameo appearance by an unexpected star which would give the whole meaning to irony.  Rob Brown (who played Jamal), a non actor was believable with his big innocent eyes craving for knowledge, Busta Rhymes played a surprisingly low key character of Jamal's elder brother who wished for nothing but the best for Jamal as he accepted his own fate as a parking attendant at the local stadium, &amp; Sean Connery was simply splendid as always.  A movie that deserved to be stood alone on its merit.  Special features in the DVD are widescreen presentation, English &amp; French subtitles, Dolby Sound, HBO Making of the movie, Rob Brown, deleted choir scenes, theatrical trailers, talent files, interactive menus, production notes, &amp; lastly scene selections.",4,A well-made feel good movie,991094400,"05 29, 2001",2001,2247,"['have', 'seen', 'many', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'lifetime', 'such', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'amp', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'way', 'there', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'matter-of-factly', '16', 'years', 'old', 'African', 'American', 'boy', 'Jamal', 'living', 'Bronx', 'deliberately', 'passed', 'grades', 'simply', 'rather', 'excelling', 'exams', 'amp', 'shooting', 'hoops', 'order', 'fit', 'peers', 'hidden', 'potential', 'was', 'soon', 'discovered', 'elite', 'school', 'nation', 'bursary', 'offered', 'free', 'scholarship', 'dare', 'friends', 'Jamal', 'sneaked', 'William', 'Forrester', 'depicted', 'brilliantly', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'apartment', 'amp', 'accident', 'lifelong', 'frienships', 'ensued', 'Jamal', 'significant', 'improvement', 'grades', 'raised', 'suspicion', 'teacher', 'potrayed', 'well', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'William', 'put', 'Jamal', 'succinctly', 'good', 'teacher', 'could', 'either', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'very', 'dangerous', 'amp', 'soon', 'enough', 'Jamal', 'was', 'receiving', 'end', 'teacher', 'wrath', 'being', 'too', 'good', 'Naturally', 'race', 'issue', 'was', 'touched', 'amp', 'awkwardness', 'Jamal', 'date', 'white', 'woman', 'acted', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'rich', 'background', 'was', 'displayed', 'not', 'words', 'silent', 'moment', 'amp', 'brief', 'glances', 'end', 'came', 'climax', 'predictable', 'resounding', 'ending', 'movie', 'deserved', 'be', 'savoured', 'slowly', 'amp', 'message', 'shines', 'thru', 'have', 'dream', 'pursue', 'albeit', 'how', 'late', 'as', 'long', 'pursue', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'unexpected', 'star', 'would', 'give', 'whole', 'meaning', 'irony', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'who', 'played', 'Jamal', 'non', 'actor', 'was', 'believable', 'big', 'innocent', 'eyes', 'craving', 'knowledge', 'Busta', 'Rhymes', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'low', 'key', 'character', 'Jamal', 'elder', 'brother', 'who', 'wished', 'nothing', 'best', 'Jamal', 'accepted', 'own', 'fate', 'parking', 'attendant', 'local', 'stadium', 'amp', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'was', 'simply', 'splendid', 'always', 'movie', 'deserved', 'be', 'stood', 'alone', 'merit', 'Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'English', 'amp', 'French', 'subtitles', 'Dolby', 'Sound', 'HBO', 'Making', 'movie', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'deleted', 'choir', 'scenes', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'talent', 'files', 'interactive', 'menus', 'production', 'notes', 'amp', 'lastly', 'scene', 'selections']",N/A

Here is a movie whose theme emphasizes the rewards, as well as the agonies, attendant upon an American black youngster breaking into the academic world. Though I am generally opposed to movies that carry a propaganda message (and profoundly so to those that continue to portray blacks as victims), we are so desperately in need of positive black role models (instead of those that pay fawning homage to 'street culture'), that I applaud the intent of this movie.Unfortunately I can't agree with the majority of critics that the Jamal Wallace character is convincing. Rob Brown, who plays him, is utterly miscast and emanates a deep and sullen dullness in a role that needed a character capable of hinting at essential brilliance, concealed beneath an unpromising and protective exterior. To me the unpromising exterior remains intact for the duration.Connery, as usual, shows his versatility, but I don't see this as even near his best work - he seems not to have his heart in it and I can't blame him. Jamal, by the way, since he checked the professor's use of 'farther' when he should have used 'further' might have usefully caught out the erudite Forrester using 'phenomena' when he meant 'phenomenon'!

I am a person who loves to see inspiring and thought-moving films and I'm fond of it and in fact collecting them as much as possible. With my tight budget I have so far, I can't resist to buy another one and thus, I bought 'Finding Forrester'. Soon when I arrived home, I immediately viewed it. I did not read the short synopsis at the back of the dvd/vcd because I want myself to be drawn unto the movie and most especially its story.'Finding Forrester' is a movie that tells how important the integrity of friendship inspite of race differences, talents, level of intelligence or others that might be consider as a standard. William Forrester played by Sean Connery is an eccentric novelist with ill-tempered manners but a compassionate and well-depth person that ideally can be considered as a true mentor. Rob Brown is a newcomer actor who played Jamal Wallace, an Afro-American gifted-person in writings who at the same excels in basketball game. His performance was fair enough in giving justice to his character however, it is much better if he gives more 'life' or an 'emotional magic' to some scenes that needed most. I don't want him to be ultra-emotional but a little bit of stress of feelings to his character may somehow move the viewers.Sean Connery gave a brilliant performance to his character, he really personified what a novelist is, giving also justice to the fears and hopes of a novelist which he strongly portrayed. He showed us a picture (somehow) of how life can be for a novelist who after the fame of receiving Pulitzer-award...what comes next? what will the future will bring me to? how far i should be like this?---questions we sometimes asks in ourselves especially in our mid-life stage. One of my favorite actors is Sean Connery but it doesn't mean to say that I'll gave a plus factor for him because he's one of my favorites, to be fair enough...I really find this movie inspiring and moving if you could only watch it with understanding...you'll never mind the actors but the characters and most importantly, the story that matters most. Because of this film, I even like more Sean Connery as a well-deserved respect as an actor. Truly a brilliant actor. But the essence of this movie is all about friendship...if you are expecting to be a 'glorious' 'triumphant' movie at the end which the hero won in a contest or something...you better not expect that although there is a contest in the movie but it is not much emphasized or gave too much focus but the mutual friendship of both main characters. Integirty became a vital ingredient and important gem of the story. Integrity that keeps friendship so strong and lasts forever till the end. It happend to William Forrester and Jamal Wallace. This movie truly teach you the importance of Integrity in a friendship. A plus also in this movie, is the soundtrack...r&b; is the theme which fits actually in the setting of this film. I love to hear all over again the themesong 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' and 'What a Wonderful World' which was beautifully done in acoustic manner.Brilliant casts...outstanding performance...very good scripting...I hope you'll find it too when you watch 'Finding Forrester'...",5,The Integrity of Friendship,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,3301,"['When', 'dropped', 'dvd/vcd', 'store', 'i', 'found', ""'Finding"", 'Forrester', 'shelf', 'together', 'other', 'great', 'titles', 'am', 'person', 'who', 'see', 'inspiring', 'thought-moving', 'films', ""'m"", 'fond', 'fact', 'collecting', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'tight', 'budget', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'buy', 'one', 'thus', 'bought', ""'Finding"", 'Forrester', 'Soon', 'when', 'arrived', 'home', 'immediately', 'viewed', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'short', 'synopsis', 'back', 'dvd/vcd', 'want', 'be', 'drawn', 'movie', 'most', 'especially', 'story', ""'Finding"", 'Forrester', 'movie', 'how', 'important', 'integrity', 'friendship', 'inspite', 'race', 'differences', 'talents', 'level', 'intelligence', 'others', 'might', 'be', 'consider', 'standard', 'William', 'Forrester', 'played', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'eccentric', 'novelist', 'ill-tempered', 'manners', 'compassionate', 'well-depth', 'person', 'ideally', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'true', 'mentor', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'newcomer', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Jamal', 'Wallace', 'Afro-American', 'gifted-person', 'writings', 'who', 'same', 'excels', 'basketball', 'game', 'performance', 'was', 'fair', 'enough', 'giving', 'justice', 'character', 'however', 'much', 'better', 'more', ""'life"", ""'emotional"", 'magic', 'scenes', 'needed', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'ultra-emotional', 'little', 'bit', 'stress', 'feelings', 'character', 'may', 'somehow', 'move', 'viewers.Sean', 'Connery', 'gave', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'character', 'really', 'personified', 'what', 'novelist', 'giving', 'also', 'justice', 'fears', 'hopes', 'novelist', 'strongly', 'portrayed', 'showed', 'picture', 'somehow', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'novelist', 'who', 'fame', 'receiving', 'Pulitzer-award', 'what', 'next', 'what', 'will', 'future', 'will', 'bring', 'how', 'far', 'i', 'should', 'be', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'mid-life', 'stage', 'One', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Sean', 'Connery', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', ""'ll"", 'gave', 'plus', 'factor', 'one', 'favorites', 'be', 'fair', 'enough', 'really', 'find', 'movie', 'inspiring', 'moving', 'could', 'only', 'watch', 'understanding', ""'ll"", 'never', 'mind', 'actors', 'characters', 'most', 'importantly', 'story', 'most', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'well-deserved', 'respect', 'actor', 'Truly', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'essence', 'movie', 'friendship', 'are', 'expecting', 'be', ""'glorious"", ""'triumphant"", 'movie', 'end', 'hero', 'won', 'contest', 'something', 'better', 'not', 'expect', 'contest', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'emphasized', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'mutual', 'friendship', 'main', 'characters', 'Integirty', 'became', 'vital', 'ingredient', 'important', 'gem', 'story', 'Integrity', 'friendship', 'so', 'strong', 'forever', 'till', 'end', 'happend', 'William', 'Forrester', 'Jamal', 'Wallace', 'movie', 'truly', 'teach', 'importance', 'Integrity', 'friendship', 'plus', 'also', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'r', 'b', 'theme', 'actually', 'setting', 'film', 'love', 'hear', 'over', 'again', 'themesong', ""'Somewhere"", 'Rainbow', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'acoustic', 'manner.Brilliant', 'casts', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'very', 'good', 'scripting', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'find', 'too', 'when', 'watch', ""'Finding"", 'Forrester']",N/A

It brought out an emotional experience which was possibly new to me, and that is an extraordinary experience.It was enough to start off with a cast including Sean Connery, Anna Paquin, F. Murray Abraham,  Busta Rhymes, and a surprise, but un-named Oscar winner. And, as a writer, I was hoping, having seen the trailers, that this would be a good story. I had no idea it would lift me to new heights.The new fresh blood in the movie is first time actor, Rob Brown, a native of Harlem, who, is the youthful half of the Young Genius, Mentor Genius relationship, around which the story revolves.  I am one movie goer who enjoys a good tear-jerker. Movies which artfully and intelligently, lightly and subtely touch the heart are special works of magic. It was no small wonder to discover, within myself,  as this precious movie  was gradually unfolding, that my lower lip started to quiver. I tried to stop it, and then, like a light bulb, illuminating a dark room, only to discover myself in a museum with a never before seen masterpiece, I realized this quivering lip was beyond tear drops, beyond the moist eye most good scripts evoke. I touched my fingertip to my quivering lip. Little babies and toddlers lips quiver.  I smiled, and pointed my attention back to the screen, letting the script do its magic. And more magic it did!Finding Forrester is an extraordinary film which blends rap with classical literature,  basketball and baseball and racism and pedantism into a STORY which builds into a masterpiece which, at some point, begins to go beyond &quot;milking the human tear duct,&quot; to playing whole symphonies on your heartstrings.While it is rated PG,  primarily because of a few choice words, it is overall a good movie for that hard to satisfy 9-13 year old group. My 10 year old gave an unqualified &quot;good&quot; rating, which, considering he generally describes even his favorites as &quot;okay&quot;, is a dramatic endorsement.

578356,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,B00005ASOC,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[6, 10]","My very favorite movie of all time is &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; That is an example of a film where the writing, acting, and directing clicked so perfectly to create a modern film masterpiece. The story was heartfelt and, although touching, was not too mushy or sentimental as to turn off male viewers.  Now why did I mention &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; in a review of &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;? The reason is simple: In many respects, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; are the same movie. And that doesn't even factor in the facts that Gus Van Sant directed both movies, and that Matt Damon, the star of &quot;Good Will,&quot; has a cameo near the end of this film. Look at the similarities: Both films tell the tales of underpriveleged young men who have minds that are so brilliant it would seem impossible that they could have come from the meager backgrounds from which they did. Both male leads have friends or brothers who recognize their talent and do not want them to squander it by remaining at their current station in life. Both men become befriended by older men who are also stuck at a dead end in their lives. Through various meetings, the older men help the younger men reach their potentials, just as the younger men help them realize that they could still have great lives if they break out of the shells they created for themselves. &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is definitely a beautiful film. It is set apart by Sean Connery's brilliant performance and his easy interaction with the young actor who plays Jamal. Their friendship is a really beautiful story. Unfortunately, the film as a whole is inferior when compared to &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; Although Anna Paquin is wonderful as Jamal's love interest, their relationship is never as interesting as the complex and multilayered one Will had with Skyler. Also, &quot;Forrester's&quot; characters fit too much into set cliches much more than the very original ideas of &quot;Hunting&quot;.  Old colleagues/enemies occur in both. The difference is Forrester dislikes Jamal's teacher based on his writings, although he never met him. Sean, from &quot;Hunting&quot; has an old personal relationship with Will's teacher that is intriguing in its blend of friendship and animosity. Also, the bottom line for me is Jamal is just not as interesting as Will. Maybe he would have been if he came first, but he just doesn't seem to have the personality and fire in life that Will does. On one level, all these similarities do not matter, though. The film really is beautiful and even reaches brilliance in many areas, but unfortunately its similarities to &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; are so overwhelming that it seems as times that the only differences is the color of Jamal's skin. Compare Jamal's talk to the racist white man in the BMW and Will's famous &quot;How do ya like them apples&quot; speech, and you'll see they're really the same scene. The subtext might be different, but both are based on brilliant people breaking down others assumptions of them based on outward appearances.

578357,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005ASOC,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 5]","Sean Connery is the enigmatic William Forrester, a brilliant though troubled writer turned recluse after releasing a single literary masterpiece, ""Avalon Rising"".  (Famous hermit Salinger published far more - Forrester's literary contributions, beyond his novel, include periodical ramblings to mags like the New Yorker) Fearing attention, Forrester lives under an assumed name in a dessicated apartment, and frustrates those who would survey his work by dangling the prospect of a second book.  Newcomer Rob Brown (supposedly he auditioned for a bit part) is Jamel Wallace, local boy, b-ball maestro and burgeoning writer.  Not recognizing the hermit as Forrester, Jamel nevertheless turns to reclusive scot for help in his writing.  The need becomes more pronounced when Jamel's writing (and his court magic) gets him a scholarship to an upper-crust prep school.  Forrester nurtures Wallace's prose (Write from the heart first, then the head, Forrester advises) while Wallace returns the favor by drawing Wallace out of his shell and preserving the genius's privacy.  While at school, Wallace develops his writing under the eye of the Nefarious Professor Crawford (F. Murray Abraham).  With Crawford's earlier attempt at publishing thwarted by Forrester ages ago, the professor works his anger out by tyrannizing his wimpy students.  To Crawford, a disparity between Jamel's writing and background raises suspicions.  Jamel's refusal to conform only spurs Crawford further until the vindictive teacher can show a pattern between Jamel's writing and obscure works by Forrester.Though Director Gus Van Sant gets some good work from his leads, quality performances and deft direction don't rise above a thin and trite story.  We know that Forrester hides in his shell for a reason and that Wallace will find someway to ease his pain.  We also know that a confrontation between the evil Crawford and Wallace is inevitable.  Crawford is incredibly underwritten, like the villain of some action movie - you know he's going to get what's coming to him.  He's a bitter bully and a coward.  Worse is the school, the sort of stuffy place of learning we've seen in ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Scent of a Woman"", the sort of tradition-bound citadel ruled by old money and populated by craven white males.  (The school falls even below this standard - though on academic probation, the school avails itself of Jamel's court skills, and even dangles the prospect of a reprieve, and you've got to wonder what respectable establishment would tolerate as openly a tyrannical, apparently bigoted and not obviously unsuccessful figure like Crawford).  The story doesn't do anything to beef up the school, which is populated by weasels cowering before the faculty.  There are none of the priceless supporting characters you had in ""Good Will Hunting"", and Busta-Rhymes is wasted as Jamel's older brother.  Though the film is about writing, the script barely treats itself as such, and there are only few lines with Forrester and Jamel jousting on the craft of prose and narrative.  I'd suggest ""Wonderboys"" instead.",3,Weak meditation on writing,1007424000,"12 4, 2001",2001,3095,"['Sean', 'Connery', 'enigmatic', 'William', 'Forrester', 'brilliant', 'troubled', 'writer', 'turned', 'recluse', 'releasing', 'single', 'literary', 'masterpiece', 'Avalon', 'Rising', 'Famous', 'hermit', 'Salinger', 'published', 'far', 'more', 'Forrester', 'literary', 'contributions', 'novel', 'include', 'periodical', 'ramblings', 'mags', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Fearing', 'attention', 'Forrester', 'assumed', 'name', 'dessicated', 'apartment', 'frustrates', 'who', 'would', 'survey', 'work', 'dangling', 'prospect', 'second', 'book', 'Newcomer', 'Rob', 'Brown', 'supposedly', 'auditioned', 'bit', 'part', 'Jamel', 'Wallace', 'local', 'boy', 'b-ball', 'maestro', 'burgeoning', 'writer', 'Not', 'recognizing', 'hermit', 'Forrester', 'Jamel', 'nevertheless', 'reclusive', 'scot', 'help', 'writing', 'need', 'more', 'pronounced', 'when', 'Jamel', 'writing', 'court', 'magic', 'scholarship', 'upper-crust', 'prep', 'school', 'Forrester', 'Wallace', 'prose', 'Write', 'heart', 'first', 'then', 'head', 'Forrester', 'Wallace', 'favor', 'drawing', 'Wallace', 'shell', 'preserving', 'genius', 'privacy', 'school', 'Wallace', 'writing', 'eye', 'Nefarious', 'Professor', 'Crawford', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Crawford', 'earlier', 'attempt', 'publishing', 'thwarted', 'Forrester', 'ages', 'ago', 'professor', 'anger', 'out', 'tyrannizing', 'wimpy', 'students', 'Crawford', 'disparity', 'Jamel', 'writing', 'background', 'suspicions', 'Jamel', 'refusal', 'conform', 'only', 'Crawford', 'further', 'vindictive', 'teacher', 'can', 'show', 'pattern', 'Jamel', 'writing', 'obscure', 'works', 'Forrester.Though', 'Director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'good', 'work', 'leads', 'quality', 'performances', 'deft', 'direction', 'do', ""n't"", 'rise', 'thin', 'trite', 'story', 'know', 'Forrester', 'hides', 'shell', 'reason', 'Wallace', 'will', 'find', 'someway', 'ease', 'pain', 'also', 'know', 'confrontation', 'evil', 'Crawford', 'Wallace', 'inevitable', 'Crawford', 'incredibly', 'underwritten', 'villain', 'action', 'movie', 'know', 'going', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'bitter', 'bully', 'coward', 'Worse', 'school', 'sort', 'stuffy', 'place', 'learning', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'sort', 'tradition-bound', 'citadel', 'ruled', 'old', 'money', 'populated', 'craven', 'white', 'males', 'school', 'even', 'standard', 'academic', 'probation', 'school', 'Jamel', 'court', 'skills', 'even', 'prospect', 'reprieve', ""'ve"", 'got', 'wonder', 'what', 'respectable', 'establishment', 'would', 'tolerate', 'openly', 'tyrannical', 'apparently', 'bigoted', 'not', 'obviously', 'unsuccessful', 'figure', 'Crawford', 'story', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'beef', 'up', 'school', 'populated', 'weasels', 'cowering', 'faculty', 'are', 'none', 'priceless', 'supporting', 'characters', 'had', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Busta-Rhymes', 'wasted', 'Jamel', 'older', 'brother', 'film', 'writing', 'script', 'barely', 'such', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'Forrester', 'Jamel', 'jousting', 'craft', 'prose', 'narrative', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Wonderboys', 'instead']",N/A

Kent ""gamereader""","[3, 8]","Finding Forrester is a good movie that might have been great had it not attempted to be all things to all audiences.Jamal Wallace, well-acted by new comer Robert Brown, is an exceptionally bright, highly athletic, African-American student trying to hide his love of reading so as not to offend his less achieving friends.  Wallace makes a great sympathetic hero living in a very friendly version of the Bronx in which people can safely walk the streets at night.By a somewhat implausible but very acceptable twist, Jamal's friends dare him to break into the apartment of a strange recluse who turns out to be Sean Connery.Don't look for any traces of James Bond in this performance.  Connery may have some silly lines, but any accusations of playing this part as if still in her majesty's secret service are simply wrong.Connery is William Forrester, a reclusive writer, a Salinger-esque writer who published one novel accepted his Pulitzer and disappeared.  And by another implausible yet entertaining twist, Connery discovers that Jamal is an aspiring writer.  The two become friends, they bond, and grow.All of this is entirely implausible, but entertaining--a welcomed relief considering most of the other movies that have come out this year.But then things fall apart.  Jamal is accepted into a private school for his great test scores--he never showed his abilities in class to keep cool but let fly on an apptitude test.  Suddenly we are treated to a School Ties scenario with street-smart Jamal having to prove himself to the wealthy kids on his basketball team.  Then there is Finding Forrester the remake of One-on-One.  In these parts the movie has long basketball sequences that are well enough made, but distract from the theme of the literary theme.Finding Forrester also has a budding romance.  Jamal and one of the wealthiest girls in the school fall in like.  The movie never explores this relationship, but it's there in case you want it.Finally, there is the evil teacher, familiarly played by Murray Abrahams of Amadeus fame.  Abrahams acting is fine, but his role is entirely predictable.So here's how Finding Forrester rates in each of its many faces:Finding Forrester the buddy flick--5 stars Finding Forrester the gheto expose--2 stars Finding Forrester the School Ties film--2 stars Finding Forrester the basketball movie--3 stars Finding Forrester the romance--1 star Finding Forrester the evil teacher movie--4 starsPut 'em all together and what do you get?

578377,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005ASOC,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 4]","Even without its cheekily reminiscent title, or the involvement of Gus Van Sant and Matt Damon, this film was always going to be a poor relation to 'Good Will Hunting'. At one point writer Mike Rich has Forrester tell Jamal that one can kick start the writing process by beginning with someone else's work: start by rewriting it, and when you find your own voice, let it takeover. Perhaps this is what Rich did with Damon and Affleck's script. While the parallels are remarkable, the film that results isn't.  The premise is virtually identical: a dazzlingly talented kid from the wrong side of the tracks enters into a relationship with an older man, and both learn and grow from the experience. Now there's nothing wrong with telling this story again (Damon and Affleck were hardly the first to do so) as long as it's told well. But 'Finding Forrester' isn't. It lacks a crucial element that makes 'Good Will Hunting' so marvellous. That film is driven by a strong central conflict: Will does not want to spend time with Sean and resents the interference of him and other authority figures in his life. He only gradually comes around to admitting his core emotional problem and, in doing so, drags Sean and Gerald into the light with him. In 'Finding Forrester', Jamal wants to spend time with Forrester and, after a few early quibbles, Forrester is only too delighted to help him. There is no conflict here. Jamal falls out of favor with his new teacher, certainly, and there is a minor rivalry with another student on the basketball team, but these are secondary to the central relationship of the film and seem to have been superimposed to add some spark. That central relationship needs to be the emotional powerhouse it was in 'Good Will Hunting', but it just isn't. The result is a story that drags and dawdles along to its pleasant and inspiring though gratingly obvious conclusion: Jamal finds his voice, Forrester regains his.  To be fair, this predictability wasn't helped by a stirring preview which gave away every key story moment (save the redundant epilogue).

There were tons of similiarities between this and Good Will Hunting (troubled young man taken under wing by brilliant tutor) though there's a little more role reversal here (the student helps the teacher at least as much).  As if to remind you that this is a variation on the Will Hunting theme, Matt Damon even shows up in a cameo.  The movie is shot much like Good Will Hunting as well -- those sweeping shots of the teacher's bookshelves look a lot like the ones of Will's bookshelves at the beginning of the movie.But I enjoyed the story if for no other reasons than the performances.  Connery was appropriately gruff but lovable, and the newcomer (whose name I forget -- probably because he hasn't done anything big since) was wonderfully subtle.

The two begin an uneasy friendship, and Forrester helps Jamal with his writing, even as Jamal receives a scholarship to a private school and is befriended by the mature, understanding Clare (Paquin).  From there, however, the plot implodes with cliches and nonsense--a professor out to get the jock, a writing contest, a bitter teammate, allegations of cheating, the state championship game, the redemption scene, and so on.

578382,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005ASOC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[10, 10]","Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown [in his screen debut]), a high school student living in the Bronx, does all of the right things. He goes to school, he plays basketball and he hides his intelligence. In an effort to be accepted by his friends and colleagues, he receives straight Cs and most of his teachers recognize that he is capable of more. After receiving very high scores on the Statewide standardized exams, his teachers urge him to accept a scholarship at a private school in Manhattan. He goes to check it out and meets Claire (Anna Paquin), his guide for the day. The school is very interested in having him join the basketball team, to help them make it to the championship. Jamal finds that he might be challenged here and decides to attend. Jamal has also just met an old recluse living in the top floor of an old brownstone near his basketball court. The recluse (Sean Connery), a local legend as a scary being, reads some of Jamal's writing and encourages him to write more. They meet daily in the old man's apartment and he stirs Jamal's creative juices, getting him to further enhance his already considerable writing skill. Jamal soon learns that the old man is William Forrester, a J.D. Salinger-esque novelist who wrote one widely acclaimed novel (think ""Catcher In The Rye"") and then disappeared from public view.I have always enjoyed the work of Sean Connery. His screen presence has always been magnetic and he has used that to great advantage in most of his films. He earned fame and riches from playing icons, creating a character that will probably forever be credited to him. He has been unable to shake that character even though the last time he played the character was over fifteen years ago. Connery has created some incredible performances through the years. He played an aging Robin Hood against an aging Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) in a very good film that many people have never heard of. He played a great thief in a film called ""The Anderson Tapes"". He played a great con man that would become ""The Man Who Would Be King"". He played an aging mentor in ""The Untouchables"" adding a lot of class and earning an Academy Award for his portrayal. He has played a lot of memorable roles that challenged his acting skills. He has also appeared in films like ""Meteor"", ""Just Cause"" and ""First Knight"". Truly terrible films that only served to mar his work. However, he has never played a character like William Forrester. We have all seen characters like this in a number of films. A recluse, a famous person, a bombastic person. Yet Connery brings a quality to the role that is very unique. Often, actors use this type of role to chew the scenery and run around screaming and yelling. This only serves to undermine the character. If the character is an old man or woman where are they getting all of this energy. Connery plays the character old. He does raise his voice, but to make a point. He does impart his wisdom, but his wisdom makes sense. I actually believed that he was a writer, listening to the advice he gives his young protege. It is an incredibly rich performance that should know become the standard for which Sean Connery is judged. James who?Rob Brown brings a lot to the role and manages to hold his own against Connery. This is no small feat. A lot of this can be credited to his naturalistic performance. Brown has obviously lived through events that are very similar to those depicted on the screen and he channels his own emotions to that of the character. One of the many good things about the film is that Jamal and Forrester seem to teach and learn from each other, enriching each other's lives.Gus Van Sant returns to territory that is very similar to ""Good Will Hunting"", but he creates a different mood and feel, helping to set ""Finding Forrester"" apart from the other film. The film opens with a shot of a marker with Van Sant's name on it followed by some documentary style footage of kids in the neighborhood. This immediately heightens our awareness of the neighborhood and the people who live there. It is actually a great touch, bringing the audience into this world very quickly and effectively. The film is then told in a fairly conventional style as Van Sant concentrates on the characters and the story. The film moves at a leisurely pace; it takes about four meetings between Jamal and Forrester before they actually start working together. This allows us to get to know these characters in what seems a natural way.Van Sant and the writer, Mike Rich, another first timer, focus on a lot of details which make the film seem very rich. Jamal's mom, Ms. Joyce (April Grace), is a very good mother who encourages her son and provides a good home. His brother, Terrel (Busta Rhymes), encourages Jamal to take chances, to avoid making the same mistakes he made. He had dreams of being a rapper but is now the supervisor of parking services at Yankee Stadium. He hasn't achieved his dreams, but he doesn't let this make him bitter. Jamal's friends are also a very close bunch. Forrester is a recluse, yet he insults the few people who are required to visit him on a regular basis. These details may seem insignificant, but they help create a richly textured film.F. Murray Abraham plays the English professor at Jamal's new school and he is very effective. His snobbishness affects his every exchange with people. They are either less intelligent or undeserving of such an education. Anna Paquin plays a young girl who becomes closer to Jamal. Her performance is very good because she seems more attracted to Jamal for the dangerous aspect of an interracial relationship. At times, she seems to wonder if she is actually attracted to Jamal or the color of his skin.I found one thing odd. In a film about writing, we hear almost none of either writer's work. We hear a couple of lines here and there, but it is difficult to take that in in such a brief period of time. I would have liked to hear more of the writing in the final competition, to get more of a sense of the authors work. Instead, Van Sant shows us reaction shots of the various students, set to music, which I didn't feel was very effective.""Finding Forrester"" is one of the best films of the year. Connery is great, the direction and writing are rich and subtle and the film is very enjoyable.",4,One of Connery's Best Performances,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,6318,"['Jamal', 'Wallace', 'Robert',

Do you think that would make it easier or harder to keep?Jamal Wallace (played by Rob Brown) is a basketball player in the Bronx. When we enter the story, he's recently taken academic assessment tests and, in contrast to his work in class, has scored high enough to gain the attention of the school board. On top of this, it is mentioned that Jamal (Brown) is an exceptional basketball player. One night, after a successful game, he is sharing a meal with friends at a restaurant. They discuss, among other things, a neighborhood resident who is something of an urban legend, referred to simply as ""the window"" because he never leaves his apartment. A common tradition among the group is for one member to dare another. One of the men dares Jamal to break into ""the window's"" apartment and return with something from inside. Jamal enters the apartment and sees a letter opener shaped like a knife but, much to his surprise, ""the window"" catches him, yelling loudly and inspiring Jamal to flee. Until his mother makes him aware of the fact, he never realized that he left his backpack in the apartment. That's set aside, briefly, when he meets with an admissions officer from an expensive private school, as a result of his test scores. When his mother says they couldn't possibly afford the tuition, the school official says that if Jamal were to continue playing basketball with the same skill for his new school, that tuition will not be an issue. In the time since, Jamal's backpack was unceremoniously dropped from ""the window's"" apartment and the notebooks inside, all containing creative writing of Jamal's, now with editorial comments written with a red pen. Jamal approaches the apartment, this time using the front door, and asks ""the window"" if he would read more of his writing.I truly love this movie. Brown as Jamal Wallace is a character you cannot help but like, despite his momentary foray into delinquency. ""The Window"" who is later identified as a renowned author who became a recluse decades before we're introduced to him. ""The Window"", played by Sean Connery, is a very sympathetic character and, as he takes on the role of mentor to Brown's character, the audience is given the opportunity to see it change both of their lives for the better. Until recently, I hadn't watched this film for some time. Since watching it again, I have no idea why it took me this long.

A writer by the name of William Forrester (Sean Connery), who now lives in seclusion, inhabits an apartment near his home.  They become friends.

Who would have thought that Sean Connery fitted into a role such as this, but it was very clever to see it all develop. I've always enjoyed the melancholy acting of F. Murray Abraham, and once again he proves that he is perfect for the role. It was the first movie where I realized that Busta Rhymes acted on the side.I thought he almost played a key role as the ideal big brother, and showed the genuine love for Jamal that some siblings never experience. Rob Brown, awesome. A talented young basketball player who learns that he is also a talented writer.One thing that I love are some of the comments that Brown and Connery come out with in this. Brown: &quot;You read all these, man?&quot; Connery: &quot;No, I just have them to impress all my visitors.&quot; Another one I like is, &quot;Bolt the door... if you're coming in.&quot; But my favorite line throughout the whole film as to be one you probably would never expect from someone like Sean Connery.
