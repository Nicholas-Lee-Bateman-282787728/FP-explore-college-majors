Author Elmore Leonard, Creator/Show Runner Graham Yost, and star of 'Justified' Timothy Olyphant are all on hand for an informative discussion of the show, how it came to be, how they continue to produce some of the best dialogue on television, and much more. They answer questions from both the moderator and the audience.  It runs 60 minutes.The respect, humility, and admiration held among these professionals is evident and sincere.  Leonard is a pro, as are Yost and Olyphant; altogether, they make a phenomenal team.  Having read 'Fire in the Hole' and 'Raylan' (available on Amazon), this tribute to the iconic 87-year-old author, Elmore Leonard ('Get Shorty,' 'Out of Sight,' and '3:10 to Yuma'), his stories (including the one about his impeccable work ethic) were something I enjoyed and appreciated learning about, very much.

These folks actually get Elmore Leonard right. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is credited as a producer of the show. I am also geeky enough to enjoy the occasional 'behind the scenes' show. So, when I saw this I jumped. I gave it a good try, I really did. But whatever energy Justified has is altogether missing here. Elmore Leonard looks ancient and tired. Timothy Olyphant looks bored out of his mind. Graham Yost is the only one with any life in him. The questions are on the lame side and a bit worshipful. Admittedly, Elmore Leonard is a living legend and Timothy Olyphant is both pretty and a fine actor. Still, there have to be more interesting questions and more engaged answers.
