Hall ""Adrian""","[13, 13]","I finally got my copy of Manhattan Melodrama, and I was pleasantly surprise by the quality of the acting, direction and the script. The is movie is a classic, and a must for any film library.Myrna Loy as alway was fantastic in this movie, but so was Clark Gable and William Powell. It is a story about two orphan boys who grew up together, but took different path in life, and the woman who love them both.Myrna Loy was beautiful as ever, and she play her part as well as could be played by any actress, William Powell was urbane as ever, but Clark Gable playing the role of a Mobster was a surprise to me, he did a credible job with his part.If you are a Myrna Loy fan or even if you are not a fan, but love a good movie, I recommend that you get this movie for your library.",5,Manhattan Melodrama is a Classic,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,776,"['finally', 'got', 'copy', 'Manhattan', 'Melodrama', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprise', 'quality', 'acting', 'direction', 'script', 'movie', 'classic', 'must', 'film', 'library.Myrna', 'Loy', 'alway', 'was', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'so', 'was', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'William', 'Powell', 'story', 'two', 'orphan', 'boys', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'took', 'different', 'path', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'both.Myrna', 'Loy', 'was', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'play', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'played', 'actress', 'William', 'Powell', 'was', 'urbane', 'ever', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'playing', 'role', 'Mobster', 'was', 'surprise', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'part.If', 'are', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'fan', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'love', 'good', 'movie', 'recommend', 'get', 'movie', 'library']",Manhattan Melodrama VHS

It's one of those where I suspect a significant number of the cliches involved were original to this movie, and then copied so many times they became cliches.Two young boys (child Blackie is played by Mickey Rooney) lose their parents in a ferry boat accident, and one of their friends was also killed. So his father takes the boys home to live with him, but dies himself a few years later.Blackie Gallagher (Clark Gable in adulthood) and Jim Wade (William Powell) remain friends, even though Blackie studies gambling odds and Jim studies law. Blackie runs a classy gambling casino and Jim becomes a DA. Eleanor Packer (Myrna Loy) is Blackie's slinky girlfriend for awhile, but after spending an evening with Jim at the Stork Club waiting for Blackie to keep his promise to join them there, she decides she really hates what Blackie is doing, especially all the unsavory characters he hangs around with, and leaves him. Before you know it, she marries James Wade, who then runs for governor.Still, there are inevitable problems with a DA who is friends with a gangster, not to mention who marries the gangster's ex-lover. They remain friends in spite of it all, but the friendship is more tragic than beneficial to either one. I'd give too much away to say more. It won an Oscar for best writing, and it's not hard to see why.

Oh I know they may be outdated, like oil lamps and horse cars, but they're mine and I'm stuck with them."" -- Loy to Gable after seeing the honest side of life with Powell.This glossy, early 1930's melodrama is in a class by itself as topnotch entertainment. Buoyed by star power and Arthur Caesar's Oscar winning story, this triangle of friends taking different paths in the world and the woman who loves them both has been copied for decades, but never as well. With W.S. Van Dyke at the helm, a script by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Oliver H.P. Garrett, and James Wong Howe photographing Cedric Gibbons' stylish 1930's set decor, Clark Gable, William Powell, and Myrna Loy do everything right. Having a nice song from Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart doesn't hurt one little bit either.The backstory of Blackie and Jim (Gable and Powell), two young boys who lose everything but each other in a tragedy, then have tragedy revisit them, lends credibility to their deep loyalty to each other when they find themselves on opposite sides of right and wrong as adults. Gable's Blackie is the easygoing gangster while Powell's Jim is the up and coming District Attorney of New York who may one day be Governor. Myrna Loy's Eleanor will be the catalyst for the act of loyalty which might possibly destroy all their lives.Loy is excellent as Blackie's gal pal who cares about him but realizes there is no future there, and moves on. It is with Jim, who she comes to love dearly, she finds her dreams fulfilled, only to have them threatened by scandal over a crime Blackie committed but one which Jim did not prosecute because he believed in his pal's innocence. The three remain close friends and an act of loyalty on Blackie's part to prevent scandal for his friend will lead to the ultimate test of friendship. Both Gable and Powell are excellent here, with perhaps Gable having the edge, because his character is less pious and more pragmatic.Long before he was thinking about girls in the Andy Hardy series, young Mickey Rooney steals the first segment of the film as a likable delinquent. Nat Pendleton and Isabel Jewell also lend fine support to the three leads. A simply fabulous example of early 1930's star power as MGM was beginning to eclipse Paramount as the studio regarded as the finest in Hollywood. For fans of early melodrama, and the three stars, this is a must have film.",5,1930's Star Wattage on High,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2440,"['have', 'ideas', 'too', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'old', 'discarded', 'Oh', 'know', 'may', 'be', 'outdated', 'oil', 'lamps', 'horse', 'cars', ""'re"", 'mine', ""'m"", 'stuck', 'Loy', 'Gable', 'seeing', 'honest', 'side', 'life', 'Powell.This', 'glossy', 'early', '1930', 'melodrama', 'class', 'topnotch', 'entertainment', 'Buoyed', 'star', 'power', 'Arthur', 'Caesar', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'story', 'triangle', 'friends', 'taking', 'different', 'paths', 'world', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'copied', 'decades', 'never', 'as', 'well', 'W.S', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'helm', 'script', 'Joseph', 'L.', 'Mankiewicz', 'Oliver', 'H.P', 'Garrett', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'photographing', 'Cedric', 'Gibbons', 'stylish', '1930', 'set', 'decor', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'do', 'everything', 'right', 'Having', 'nice', 'song', 'Richard', 'Rogers', 'Lorenz', 'Hart', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'one', 'little', 'bit', 'either.The', 'backstory', 'Blackie', 'Jim', 'Gable', 'Powell', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'lose', 'everything', 'other', 'tragedy', 'then', 'have', 'tragedy', 'revisit', 'credibility', 'deep', 'loyalty', 'other', 'when', 'find', 'opposite', 'sides', 'right', 'wrong', 'adults', 'Gable', 'Blackie', 'easygoing', 'gangster', 'Powell', 'Jim', 'up', 'coming', 'District', 'Attorney', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'Governor', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Eleanor', 'will', 'be', 'catalyst', 'act', 'loyalty', 'might', 'possibly', 'destroy', 'lives.Loy', 'excellent', 'Blackie', 'gal', 'pal', 'who', 'realizes', 'future', 'there', 'moves', 'Jim', 'who', 'love', 'dearly', 'dreams', 'fulfilled', 'only', 'have', 'threatened', 'scandal', 'crime', 'Blackie', 'committed', 'one', 'Jim', 'did', 'not', 'prosecute', 'believed', 'pal', 'innocence', 'three', 'remain', 'close', 'friends', 'act', 'loyalty', 'Blackie', 'part', 'prevent', 'scandal', 'friend', 'will', 'lead', 'ultimate', 'test', 'friendship', 'Gable', 'Powell', 'are', 'excellent', 'here', 'perhaps', 'Gable', 'having', 'edge', 'character', 'less', 'pious', 'more', 'pragmatic.Long', 'was', 'thinking', 'girls', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'series', 'young', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'first', 'segment', 'film', 'likable', 'delinquent', 'Nat', 'Pendleton', 'Isabel', 'Jewell', 'also', 'lend', 'fine', 'support', 'three', 'leads', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'example', 'early', '1930', 'star', 'power', 'MGM', 'was', 'beginning', 'eclipse', 'Paramount', 'studio', 'regarded', 'finest', 'Hollywood', 'fans', 'early', 'melodrama', 'three', 'stars', 'must', 'have', 'film']",Manhattan Melodrama VHS

Clark Gable and William Powell play childhood friends who grow up to be a hood and a respected judge, respectively.  Both have a thing for Myrna Loy, but the expected rivalry for which this plot would seem to be tailor made never comes.  Instead, there's a refreshingly serious story about the boundaries of loyalty and friendship.  When Gable is accused of murder and sentenced to the death penalty, it is Powell's duty to decide whether or not to let his personal feelings for Gable interfere with his practice of legal justice.Loy pops up throughout, but, unfortunately, she's window dressing.  (Side note: My wife and I decided to have a Myrna Loy theme to our New Year's movie night, and rented this and &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer.&quot; We couldn't have picked two Myrna Loy movies that do a worse job of showing off Myrna Loy).

It was alright, but with so much talent in front of the screen (Myrna Loy, Clark Gable, William Powell and Nat Pendleton - who I think was the best part of the whole movie), not to mention behind the camera: W.S. Van Dyke, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, George Cukor (!!!) I was really expecting more.The story is your basic Cain and Abel hokum with two orphans growing up as brothers. One goes the straight and narrow to become a prominent political figure and the other the local kingpin of illegal gambling. Throw in the fact that they are both in love with the same woman and you got...well, nothing really. You would expect for there to be fireworks, but the script plays it safe from beginning to end and there's never any tension or surprise moments.I love William Powell, but I thought he was kinda weak here. Maybe it was just that the lame script gave him nothing to work with, whatever the problem was I thing Spencer Tracy would have done a much better job in the role of the honest lawyer. Another thing that really bothered me was why didn't the three main stars ever appear onscreen together at the same time? [...] odd.Oh well, I'm wasting too much time on this review. The film is ok, Clark Gable puts in a great performance as does Nat Pendelton who gets a surprising amount of screen time, but other than that this film is just average.

Jackson, Isabelle Keith, Frank Conroy, Noel Madison, Jimmy Butler, Mickey Rooney, Shirley RossDirected by W.S. Van DykeOrphans Edward ""Blackie"" Gallagher (Gable) and Jim Wade (Powell) are lifelong friends who take different paths in life. Blackie thrives on gambling and grows up to be a hard-nosed racketeer. Bookworm Wade becomes a D.A. vying for the Governorship. When Blackie's girlfriend Eleanor (Loy) leaves him and marries the more down to earth Wade, Blackie harbors no resentment. In fact, their friendship is so strong that Blackie murders an attorney threatening to derail Wade's bid to become Governor.The morally straight Wade's last job as D.A. is to convict his friend of the murder, and send him to the electric chair. After he becomes Governor, Wade has the authority to commute Blackie's death sentence-- a decision that pits his high moral ethics against a lifelong friendship.Direction, casting, acting, editing, photography, storyline, all flawless in a class by themselves.William Powell, showing more depth and sensitivity than in most of his films, especially in the climactic scene.And what a performance by Clark Gable was outstanding and compelling from start to finish.  We were secretly rooting for him toward the end credits.I feel the picture is underrated and highly recommend to all who want good drama and a story you can sink your teeth into.Watch for a young Mickey Rooney who always gives an outstanding performance.Oscar Winner for Best Writing, Original Story (Arthur Caesar)* Special Footnote: -- This is the first of 14 pairings of Myrna Loy and William Powell and the first of three films they would make together in 1934.  They were a perfect couple together, love all of their films.** Another Special Footnote: -- George Cukor was assigned as director for additional scenes after the preview showing on 14 April 1934, because director W.S.

Myrna Loy went on to co-star with both Gable & Powell (mostly Powell) in many future movies & is always beautiful & smart. A bonus was Mickey Rooney in the early scenes of Blackie (Gable) as a child. He & Jim (Powell) have a powerful lifetime bond, close as brothers. Flash forward 20 years to the 1920's, Gable is a hood with lots of money. Powell is the up & coming DA. As a government worker he seems to be doing pretty well. Gable as Blackie seems to have little motivation. As an actor he doesn't display much of his acting talent & is just average. Very little emotion when he kills sombody or loves his girl, Eleanor. She gets tired of his criminal ways & takes up with Powell. You'd expect some type of conflict here but there is none. Blackie even helps Jim in his run for govenor, without his knowledge. None of these stars gives a lifetime performance. The fact is it is early in their careers. None of them is a finished product. But the writing carries the day. Blackie's character is much too fatalistic when the law catches up to him. He still loves Jim & is proud of his career.

That's when the General Slocum, a passenger ship that was chartered by a church group to give New Yorkers an excursion around the City, caught fire and burned to the water line.  More than 1,000 people died in the accident.  It's on the deck of that ship that we first meet Blackie Gallagher and Jim Wade as children.  The role of Blackie is played by Mickey Rooney.  Even as a child he likes to gamble and we first meet him swindling a nickel from another child.  His friend, Jim Wade, is very different.  He likes to read books.  All of a sudden, fire breaks out.  There is panic.  There is sadness.  Blackie and Jim are orphaned and adopted on the spot by a kindly Jewish man who has lost his own son in the tragedy and is later murdered in front of their eyes because he speaks up against a rally for the Russian Revolution.Fast forward twenty years.  It takes a bit of imagination to believe it, but Mickey Rooney has grown up to be Clark Gable, a gambler who plays for high stakes, has Eleanor, played by Myrna Loy, as a girlfriend, and only kills people when they refuse to pay for their gambling loses.  His friend, Jim Wade, is now the district attorney.  The plot thickens.  Blackie doesn't want to settle down.  Eleanor wants home and family though and is attracted to the good qualities of Jim Wade, played by William Powell.  Eventually, she marries Jim Wade, who later runs for governor.  However, Jim Wade has an enemy who might thwart his chances at the governorship.  Eleanor tells Blackie about this and Blackie murders the enemy.Blackie is prosecuted by his district attorney friend and sentenced to die in the electric chair.  Jim Wade has an opportunity to commute the sentence.  How's that for a plot?As far as acting goes, I think Myrna Loy and William Powell were exceptional.  I understand that this was their first film together and that they went on to star as a couple in 14 other films.  Clark Gable is handsome.  But he is a terrible actor.  Every line sounded wooden and awkward, so much so that I almost laughed out loud.  I noticed that all the actors spoke very loudly and clearly, sometimes too loud and clear for the context of the role.  Later I realized that the sound techniques of the time just weren't as sophisticated as we have today.  I also had to smile at some of the slang that was used, like ""I had a `swell' time"" and ""everything is `hotsie totsie'"".  William Powell was just not a good looking man according to today's standards.  But he seemed more real than some of the plastic surgery icons of today. Also some of the techniques used in the film must have been cutting edge at the time.  For example, a split screen was used to show the contrast of the two boys growing up, one with schoolbooks and the other shooting dice.Also noteworthy is the fact that this is the movie that John Dillinger was watching before he was gunned down by FBI agents.  This led to a tremendous amount of popularity for the film and it was a bigger box office success than expected.  At the time Myrna Loy was among those who expressed distaste at the studio's willingness to exploit this event for the financial benefit of the film.All in all I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It brought me back in time and gave me a sense of the 1930s and the events that shaped those times.  I therefore give it a high recommendation.",5,"Corruption, murder, love and pathos  - a fine piece of filmmaking",1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,3670,"['First', 'released', '1934', 'fast-moving', 'drama', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'considering', 'technical', 'limitations', 'time', 'elements', 'police', 'corruption', 'murder', 'love', 'pathos.The', 'film', 'incident', 'shocked', 'saddened', 'New', 'Yorkers', '1904', 'when', 'General', 'Slocum', 'passenger', 'ship', 'was', 'chartered', 'church', 'group', 'give', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'excursion', 'City', 'caught', 'fire', 'burned', 'water', 'line', 'More', '1,000', 'people', 'died', 'accident', 'deck', 'ship', 'first', 'meet', 'Blackie', 'Gallagher', 'Jim', 'Wade', 'children', 'role', 'Blackie', 'played', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Even', 'child', 'gamble', 'first', 'meet', 'swindling', 'nickel', 'child', 'friend', 'Jim', 'Wade', 'very', 'different', 'read', 'books', 'sudden', 'fire', 'breaks', 'out', 'panic', 'sadness', 'Blackie', 'Jim', 'are', 'orphaned', 'adopted', 'spot', 'kindly', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'own', 'son', 'tragedy', 'later', 'murdered', 'front', 'eyes', 'up', 'rally', 'Russian', 'Revolution.Fast', 'forward', 'twenty', 'years', 'bit', 'imagination', 'believe', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'gambler', 'who', 'high', 'stakes', 'Eleanor', 'played', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'girlfriend', 'only', 'kills', 'people', 'when', 'refuse', 'pay', 'gambling', 'loses', 'friend', 'Jim', 'Wade', 'now', 'district', 'attorney', 'plot', 'thickens', 'Blackie', ""n't"", 'want', 'settle', 'down', 'Eleanor', 'home', 'family', 'attracted', 'good', 'qualities', 'Jim', 'Wade', 'played', 'William', 'Powell', 'Eventually', 'Jim', 'Wade', 'who', 'later', 'runs', 'governor', 'However', 'Jim', 'Wade', 'enemy', 'who', 'might', 'thwart', 'chances', 'governorship', 'Eleanor', 'Blackie', 'Blackie', 'enemy.Blackie', 'prosecuted', 'district', 'attorney', 'friend', 'sentenced', 'die', 'electric', 'chair', 'Jim', 'Wade', 'opportunity', 'commute', 'sentence', 'How', 'plot', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'think', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'William', 'Powell', 'were', 'exceptional', 'understand', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'together', 'went', 'star', 'couple', '14', 'other', 'films', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'handsome', 'terrible', 'actor', 'line', 'sounded', 'wooden', 'awkward', 'so', 'much', 'almost', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'noticed', 'actors', 'spoke', 'very', 'loudly', 'clearly', 'sometimes', 'too', 'loud', 'clear', 'context', 'role', 'Later', 'realized', 'sound', 'techniques', 'time', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'sophisticated', 'have', 'today', 'also', 'had', 'smile', 'slang', 'was', 'used', 'had', 'swell', 'time', 'everything', 'hotsie', 'totsie', 'William', 'Powell', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'looking', 'man', 'according', 'today', 'standards', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'icons', 'today', 'Also', 'techniques', 'used', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'cutting', 'edge', 'time', 'example', 'split', 'screen', 'was', 'used', 'show', 'contrast', 'two', 'boys', 'growing', 'up', 'one', 'schoolbooks', 'other', 'shooting', 'dice.Also', 'noteworthy', 'fact', 'movie', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'FBI', 'agents', 'led', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'popularity', 'film', 'was', 'bigger', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'expected', 'time', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'was', 'who', 'expressed', 'distaste', 'studio', 'willingness', 'exploit', 'event', 'financial', 'benefit', 'film.All', 'must', 'say', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'brought', 'back', 'time', 'gave', 'sense', '1930s', 'events', 'shaped', 'times', 'therefore', 'give', 'high', 'recommendation']",Manhattan Melodrama VHS

303635,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302241200,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Manhattan Melodrama tells the story of two young boys, Edward J. 'Blackie' Gallagher (Clark Gable) and James W. 'Jim' Wade (William Powell) who grow up together after their parents are killed in a fire onboard a steamboat just off New York City. While Blackie loves to play with dice and gamble--even as a young boy--Jim prefers to study and becomes New York's District Attorney and eventually Governor of New York State. Blackie runs his own illegal gambling parlor and even makes deals on the side with corrupt police officers.One person connects the two men throughout time: their relationship with Eleanor Packer (Myrna Loy). At first Eleanor is in love with Blackie but when she realizes he'll never go straight she leaves him; and she eventually marries Jim. Blackie and Jim stay in touch as they meet from time to time; and they hear more about each other through Eleanor, too.Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Jim wants to solve problems using the established laws and moral principles--but Blackie scorns this and solves his problems in a very different way. What happens when someone refuses to pay Blackie a debt? Will Eleanor remain happy with Jim or will she eventually be charmed back to Blackie and the good old days she had with him? What happen between Blackie and Jim when Jim runs for Governor? No spoilers here, folks, you'll have to watch the movie to find out!The choreography works well in the steamboat scenes early on in the film; and the cinematography shines in the state assembly.Overall, Manhattan Melodrama is a rather good film with a lot of punch and people who enjoy classic drama will want to see this one. Look also for a fine performance from a very young Mickey Rooney as Blackie when he was a kid; and Leo Carrillo also turns in a fine performance as Father Joe.",5,"a ""class film""--just like Selznick said it was",1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,1813,"['Manhattan', 'Melodrama', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Edward', 'J', 'Gallagher', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'James', 'W.', ""'Jim"", 'Wade', 'William', 'Powell', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'together', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'fire', 'steamboat', 'just', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Blackie', 'play', 'dice', 'gamble', 'even', 'young', 'boy', 'Jim', 'prefers', 'study', 'becomes', 'New', 'York', 'District', 'Attorney', 'eventually', 'Governor', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'Blackie', 'own', 'illegal', 'gambling', 'parlor', 'even', 'deals', 'side', 'corrupt', 'police', 'officers.One', 'person', 'two', 'men', 'time', 'relationship', 'Eleanor', 'Packer', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'first', 'Eleanor', 'love', 'Blackie', 'when', ""'ll"", 'never', 'go', 'straight', 'eventually', 'Jim', 'Blackie', 'Jim', 'stay', 'touch', 'meet', 'time', 'time', 'hear', 'more', 'other', 'Eleanor', 'too.Of', 'course', 'here', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'Jim', 'solve', 'problems', 'using', 'established', 'laws', 'moral', 'principles', 'Blackie', 'problems', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'What', 'when', 'someone', 'pay', 'Blackie', 'debt', 'Will', 'Eleanor', 'remain', 'happy', 'Jim', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'charmed', 'back', 'Blackie', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'had', 'What', 'happen', 'Blackie', 'Jim', 'when', 'Jim', 'Governor', 'No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'choreography', 'well', 'steamboat', 'early', 'film', 'cinematography', 'shines', 'state', 'assembly.Overall', 'Manhattan', 'Melodrama', 'rather', 'good', 'film', 'lot', 'punch', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'drama', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'Look', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'very', 'young', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Blackie', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Leo', 'Carrillo', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'Father', 'Joe']",Manhattan Melodrama VHS

303637,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302241200,Randy Keehn,"[7, 7]","I saw ""Manhatten Melodrama"" for the first time last night and I was very favorably impressed.  This movie caught my attention right from the very novel beginning.  We encounter our two male leads as youths on an outing.  One of the child actors is a juvenile Mickey Rooney already displaying his talents.  The scenes we witness are craftily designed to show us just how close a bond these two youths were developing.  We get another series of scenes that let us know the different directions each of them takes toward their adult life.  Naturally these glimpses show us two best friends headed in opposite directions.  One becomes a criminal and the other a District Attorney.  There is a woman who who doesn't so much come between them as serves as a connection between them.  Their paths cross from time to time until a serious crime is committed.  I'll leave the plot there because you probably would have guessed this much.The movie features three big names (plus the up-and-coming Rooney) in Clark Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy.  Their acting is well done and they have a reasonable supporting cast.  The picture won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and you should be able to tell that the writing IS the outstanding part of this production.  It had plenty of other nominations but this was 1934; the year of ""It Happened One Night"".  The movies moves itself from beyond the standard ""gangster movie"" fare of its' time as it unfolds into a great moral dilemna.  This is all well developed and reaches a powerful and emotional level that you might not have been prepared for despite the movie's title.  At least, that's how it hit me.  I didn't give it the top rating available...but I thought about it.

Not everyone will like it though; it is a film about friendship and honor and can become rather gooey when it comes to the relationships between characters. However, as a fan of melodrama, I really enjoyed it.Blackie (Clark Gable) and Jim (William Powell) have been friends since they were children. When they lost their parents in a shipwreck, they were adopted by a kindly man who did his best with them. Blackie always had a natural inclination toward gambling while Jim enjoyed reading and studying. Their differences in interest never severed their relationship though and each had a very strong love and respect for the other. Blackie becomes a gangster who only falls into trouble because he acts irrationally for the people he loves. Jim is the DA, a man with the possibility to become governer of New York City. Although the city knows he is a just man and loves him for it, his friendship with Blackie hurts him. Still, even when they fall in love with the same girl (Myrna Loy), their friendship is as strong as ever.Everyone in the cast does his part to make this a top-notch film.
