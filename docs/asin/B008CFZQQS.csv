Needless to say, we are not up on the latest and greatest television.  After reading about Girls and Lena Dunham in countless magazines and online, we were both a little curious about this show.  I found it here (used) for a good price and decided we would give it a shot, fully expecting to hate it.  We both absolutely loved it and it's become my new favorite show.  It does not get in the way of itself trying to be hip.  It's quirky and honest and a little out-there.  I am probably a bit immature for being in my 30's especially since I'm not having children, but I continually forgot this show was about people much younger than I am.

Shoshanna is the perky college student who thinks her life is supposed to resemble Sex and the City - she panics about the fact that she hasn't had sex yet.It's possible to find actress/writer/director Lena Dunham inherently likeable, but find her character Hannah frustrating.  One of the more interesting themes is how Hannah's insecurities actually make her judgmental and oblivious to others' feelings.  She also sabotages herself quite a bit.  When you realize the show understands this about her, and it isn't trying to excuse or garner sympathy for her - well, she's easier to take.The acting and dialogue are quite good, although the more extreme language and weird sex scenes seem gimmicky and unnecessary to me.  This show will entertain you if you can find humor in the dingy apartments, career malaise, weird relationships and general dysfunction of being a twentysomething in today's world of texting and extended adolescence.  Not to say that all, or even most twentysomethings act like these characters.  But I think it likely highlights (in an extreme and funny way) the challenges of being that age.However, if you don't enjoy self-involved characters or crude humor, this show isn't for you.  If you didn't like Sex and the City, you will probably hate this - Girls is a similar show, with less money, dirtier language, weirder sex and the main characters making even worse decisions.",3,Not to everyone's taste ...,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1853,"['show', 'patience', 'took', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'characters', 'develop', 'depth', 'heart.Hannah', 'struggling', 'writer', 'weight', 'self-esteem', 'issues', 'Marnie', 'uptight', 'one', 'who', 'perfectly', 'put', 'together', 'questioning', 'relationship', 'sweet', 'college', 'boyfriend', 'Jessa', 'friend', 'everyone', 'have', 'twenties', 'who', 'cool', 'confident', 'wild', 'unconventional', 'life', 'Shoshanna', 'perky', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'life', 'supposed', 'resemble', 'Sex', 'City', 'fact', ""n't"", 'had', 'sex', 'yet.It', 'possible', 'find', 'actress/writer/director', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'inherently', 'likeable', 'find', 'character', 'Hannah', 'frustrating', 'One', 'more', 'interesting', 'themes', 'how', 'Hannah', 'insecurities', 'actually', 'make', 'judgmental', 'oblivious', 'others', 'feelings', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'When', 'realize', 'show', ""n't"", 'trying', 'excuse', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'well', 'easier', 'take.The', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'more', 'extreme', 'language', 'weird', 'sex', 'scenes', 'seem', 'gimmicky', 'unnecessary', 'show', 'will', 'entertain', 'can', 'find', 'humor', 'dingy', 'apartments', 'career', 'malaise', 'weird', 'relationships', 'general', 'dysfunction', 'being', 'twentysomething', 'today', 'world', 'texting', 'extended', 'adolescence', 'Not', 'say', 'even', 'most', 'twentysomethings', 'act', 'characters', 'think', 'likely', 'highlights', 'extreme', 'funny', 'way', 'challenges', 'being', 'age.However', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'self-involved', 'characters', 'crude', 'humor', 'show', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Sex', 'City', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'Girls', 'similar', 'show', 'less', 'money', 'dirtier', 'language', 'weirder', 'sex', 'main', 'characters', 'making', 'even', 'worse', 'decisions']",Girls: Season 1

Unfortunately there seems to be no morals or positive personality traits in any of the main characters. If this is what the new generation (I admit I am old now) believes and stands for I am very disappointed. From the episodes I have seen not one characters has earned any empathy or sympathy. Every character is self-centered and very unlikable. They all back-stab and bitch about the people that are supposed to be their best friends. No emotional support, no morals and no thought for anyone but themselves. Overall a very poor display of humanity. Too bad this is type of program that earns awards. I feel very sorry for the writer and creator. She must have had a very sad and painful life to create such heartless and unfeeling characters. None of her so called friends are really friends. If this is an accurate portrayal of the way real people in the US now view their friends it paints a very dark and painful picture. Doesn't give much hope for the future. I just hope this Hollywood lack of morals and caring for your fellow man really doesn't influence the younger generation. Overall a very sad view of how uncaring and self absorbed people can be. Still not sure if this program is trying to be a parody of life or if it is just plain sad. If it is trying to be funny it fails miserably. It is a very visual depiction of very shallow and self-centered people making very stupid life choices.

The painful agonies and sharp learning curves of young adulthood that have rarely been presented as accurately or with as much unflinching honesty as in this series. Dunham's scripts are intelligent and sly, showing attractive, articulate young people making complete messes out of their lives, stumbling through their not-glamorous lives in modern-day New York City, a hard town that seems surprisingly welcoming and warm through the lens of these young and brash characters.There's a lot to like about this show - most of all it's how Dunham and company present people as they really are - inherently flawed, not easy to read, changing as they grow and have new experiences, appealing despite their shortcomings. The casting is brilliant: like Richard Linklatter (and her patron, Judd Apatow), Dunham gathers together unusual, goofy-looking actors, people who look like people you know, with big ears and crooked noses, body fat and funny faces, as well as young people who actually look like the ages they are supposed to be playing. Like Apatow's ""Freaks And Geeks"" or Linklatter's ""Dazed And Confused,"" this show rings true because it defiantly gives voice to the people we really know and are, rather than a bunch of blow-dried, silicon-boobed thirty year-olds pretending to be teenagers on some generic WB/CW/network soap opera.  And the plot matches the look: the sharp wit and poor judgement these characters display will remind you of your own post-college life, and is particularly good at showing the kind of experiences and relationships that real ""girls"" really have.Although Dunham gives a nod to ""Sex And The City"" (a show I could never get into), there's clearly a fair amount of pushback and satire intended in the comparison. These aren't oh-so-glamorous, oh-so-outrageous post-feminist stereotypes, these are realistic characters whose dreams and desires are bordered by mundane reality. The graphic, purposefully clumsy sex scenes do have a slightly gratuitous air to them, yet they invariably serve a direct dramatic purpose, adding new layers to the characters involved and their relationships with others. In short: well done. Bring on Season Two!

The show's protagonist Hannah is both hero and anti-hero, a young women so at odds with herself that she just has no time to bother with anyone else.  If she's not mooching off her parents then she's mooching off her roommate.  And if she's not complaining about her friend with benefits then she's sleeping with him -- and often at the same time.  And if she's not at home loafing around then she's quitting her job.  When her boss rebuffs her sexual advances she accuses him of sexual harassment and threatens to sue, and when her boss laughs and tells her to forget it all she becomes angry at his lack of anger, and quits.&#34;Girls&#34; is so good because it's so raw, unforgiving, and often at times so damn amateurish.

1550112,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008CFZQQS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[78, 91]","HBO's ""Girls"" seems to be one of those love-it or hate-it propositions and I'm not quite sure why. Its creator and star, Lena Dunham, burst onto the scene with the micro-budgeted indie ""Tiny Furniture"" in 2010. Embraced enthusiastically by critics, the young talent was branded a new voice in contemporary comedy. But as the picture became more widely seen (it is available in a 2-disc Criterion edition), the backlash began. ""Girls"" has some of the same situations, concerns, stars, pacing and humor as the feature film and all of the supposed negatives that applied to ""Tiny Furniture"" have followed Dunham to ""Girls."" The show is still a huge critical success, it just seems to lack universal appeal. The most common complaint, I suppose, is that it creates a very insular world populated with pretty self-involved characters. It's a fair point, to be sure. But for everyone who says that Dunham doesn't ""speak for their generation,"" I say that she never intended to. She speaks about her world, her life, and the things that she knows. It may not be identifiable to everyone, but it is eminently real and utterly believable! The world created in ""Girls"" exists and Dunham has skewered it perfectly creating a fresh comedy that is simultaneously absurd and truthful. This is a generation that has yet to find its purpose.""Girls"" is centered around four young women trying to navigate the pitfalls on the way to responsibility and adulthood. The characters ably showcase a combination of post-collegiate ennui and over-educated (and pseudo-intellectual) entitlement. Set in a fashionable New York City young, artistic and urban environment--the show's sardonic tone and cultural critique really speak to this specific subset of individuals. But the quirky storylines, which can be quite funny, also achieves a quiet poignancy when you least expect it. Dunham plays the principle character, an aspiring writer who struggles with menial employment to be able to afford the rent. The others in the quartet are the lovely Allison Williams (as Dunham's more responsible roommate), the brash Jemima Kirke (as a more exotic friend returning home), and the tightly wound Zosia Mamet as the innocent. For those looking for ""Sex and the City"" comparisons, each of the characters does fit squarely into the Carrie/Miranda/Samantha/Charlotte configuration. I'm not trying to draw any unnecessary comparisons as this is edgier, more modern, more youthful, and has a completely different vibe.Anyone needing big plotlines or stories, ""Girls"" really succeeds as a more character driven piece. The women are looking, in some variation or another, for love and success. But also, in many ways, they might not recognize these things should they present themselves. Truthfully, I didn't love every subplot within Season One's ten half hour episodes. I never particularly warmed to Kirke who is supposed to be someone the others look up to. I didn't always see the appeal and it certainly didn't help that she was saddled with some of the year's most unfortunate stories (poor James LeGros features prominently in a particular misfire). But the others really impressed. As an actress, Dunham is unafraid to showcase (and expose) a very personal, and oftentimes unpleasant, side to her persona. The show is frank, sexual, and presents a very unglamorous look at provocative subjects.""Girls"" may be about the women, but many of the men also have a chance to shine. It's good to see Peter Scolari (Newhart, Bosom Buddies) back as Dunham's father. Chris O'Dowd (Bridesmaids) and great character actor Richard Masur have funny cameos. Andrew Rannells (The Book of Mormon) is terrific as a man from Dunham's college days. Christopher Abbott is perfect as Williams' adoring boyfriend, oftentimes accompanied by his witty and sarcastic best friend (Alex Karpovsky, doing the same shtick as he does in Tiny Furniture). But, for my money, it is Adam Driver who (quite unexpectedly) emerges as a real star in this piece. Starting the season as Dunham's casual sex partner, Driver is hysterically aloof--sending mixed signals at every turn. As the season progresses, however, this performance becomes increasingly nuanced and surprising. At the end of the day, I might not remember all of the antics these girls got up to--but I will remember the progressive relationship of Dunham and Driver. These two score as TV's least probable couple and both are absolutely incredible. ""Girls"" is definitely a show worth checking out. Try it with an open mind, you might be pleasantly surprised.

However, for some reason, I like these girly shows (and before you ask, I'm straight). I was a fan of Gossip Girl until it became stupid towards the end. Initially, I wasn't planning on watching this series, but I saw about a million advertisements for Girls in the NYC Subway. I finally decided to succumb to peer pressure. I bought the season 1 DVD from Target and watched the entire season in 3 days.I can definitely see why some people dislike this show, but most of the episodes are entertaining. Watching this show requires some suspension of disbelief. The protagonist of the series is Hannah, a self-conscious and slightly overweight (but definitely not fat) girl in her mid-20's. Although she is book smart, she is completely dense. She once made a joke about date rape during a job interview. She quit another job she had after her ~60 year old boss refused to have sex with her. She reminds me of a female version of George Constanza. Hannah's frenemy is Marnie (sp?), an attractive but insecure girl. Hannah and Marnie have their cat fights and usually make up in the next episode.Jessa is a hot British girl. She's an eccentric, pot-smoking party girl, like a raunchier Phoebe Buffay. Shoshanna (sp?) is the innocent virgin (SPOILER: she loses her virginity in the season finale).What I didn't like about this series is that all of the male characters are douches. Adam, Hannah's borderline abusive boyfriend, is the dumb jock type. He rarely has a shirt on. He reminds me of Kelso from That 70's Show. Elijah is a recurring guest star. He's Hannah's ex-boyfriend who turned gay. He is the gay stereotype. Charlie is Marnie's boyfriend. They split up and 2 weeks later, he met someone else. Jessa got hit on by the father of the kids she babysits.This show is a caricature of life in New York City. I don't think it's meant for people to take seriously. No one can be as dense as Hannah. Furthermore, in real life, I find it hard to believe that a guy like Adam would be attracted to an average looking girl like Hannah. The funniest episode of the series was when they went to the party in Bushwick. The show started off realistic- Hannah had to survive in the city after being cut off by her parents. Then, the show became less realistic as it progressed. SPOILER: in the season finale, Jessa marries a guy she knew for 2 weeks.There isn't a single character who I like. I found myself laughing AT Hannah instead of cheering for her. Nevertheless, the show is funny. Many people have complained about the lack of minorities on the show. I don't have an issue with this. There are blacks and Asians on the show, but they appear mostly as extras. In New York City, there are all-white cliques, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're racist or exclude minorities. I'd rather the show reflect reality than to have a token black character (Donald Glover is going to appear in season 2).",3,"Watchable, but could be better",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,3016,"[""'m"", '27', 'years', 'old', '28', '3', 'weeks', 'African-American', 'male', ""'m"", 'obviously', 'not', 'target', 'demographic', 'show', 'However', 'reason', 'like', 'girly', 'shows', 'ask', ""'m"", 'straight', 'was', 'fan', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'became', 'stupid', 'end', 'Initially', 'was', ""n't"", 'planning', 'watching', 'series', 'saw', 'million', 'advertisements', 'Girls', 'NYC', 'Subway', 'finally', 'decided', 'succumb', 'peer', 'pressure', 'bought', 'season', '1', 'DVD', 'Target', 'watched', 'entire', 'season', '3', 'days.I', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'dislike', 'show', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'entertaining', 'Watching', 'show', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'protagonist', 'series', 'Hannah', 'self-conscious', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'definitely', 'not', 'fat', 'girl', 'mid-20', 'book', 'smart', 'completely', 'dense', 'once', 'made', 'joke', 'date', 'rape', 'job', 'interview', 'quit', 'job', 'had', '~60', 'year', 'old', 'boss', 'refused', 'have', 'sex', 'female', 'version', 'George', 'Constanza', 'Hannah', 'frenemy', 'Marnie', 'sp', 'attractive', 'insecure', 'girl', 'Hannah', 'Marnie', 'have', 'cat', 'fights', 'usually', 'make', 'up', 'next', 'episode.Jessa', 'hot', 'British', 'girl', 'eccentric', 'pot-smoking', 'party', 'girl', 'raunchier', 'Phoebe', 'Buffay', 'Shoshanna', 'sp', 'innocent', 'virgin', 'SPOILER', 'virginity', 'season', 'finale', '.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'series', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'douches', 'Adam', 'Hannah', 'borderline', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'dumb', 'jock', 'type', 'rarely', 'shirt', 'Kelso', '70', 'Show', 'Elijah', 'recurring', 'guest', 'star', 'Hannah', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'turned', 'gay', 'gay', 'stereotype', 'Charlie', 'Marnie', 'boyfriend', 'split', 'up', '2', 'weeks', 'later', 'met', 'someone', 'else', 'Jessa', 'got', 'hit', 'father', 'kids', 'babysits.This', 'show', 'caricature', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'meant', 'people', 'take', 'seriously', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'dense', 'Hannah', 'Furthermore', 'real', 'life', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'guy', 'Adam', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'average', 'looking', 'girl', 'Hannah', 'funniest', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'when', 'went', 'party', 'Bushwick', 'show', 'started', 'off', 'realistic-', 'Hannah', 'had', 'survive', 'city', 'being', 'cut', 'off', 'parents', 'Then', 'show', 'became', 'less', 'realistic', 'progressed', 'SPOILER', 'season', 'finale', 'Jessa', 'guy', 'knew', '2', ""n't"", 'single', 'character', 'who', 'like', 'found', 'laughing', 'AT', 'Hannah', 'instead', 'cheering', 'Nevertheless', 'show', 'funny', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'lack', 'minorities', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'issue', 'are', 'blacks', 'Asians', 'show', 'appear', 'mostly', 'extras', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'all-white', 'cliques', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', ""'re"", 'racist', 'exclude', 'minorities', ""'d"", 'rather', 'show', 'reflect', 'reality', 'have', 'token', 'black', 'character', 'Donald', 'Glover', 'going', 'appear', 'season', '2']",Girls: Season 1

1550120,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008CFZQQS,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","I've always approached shows on cable networks with a sense of caution. For some reason it seems that most of the critics in the world fall all over themselves to discuss how wonderful each and every program on cable networks like HBO and SHOWTIME are cutting edge and worth watching. For the most part the one thing these shows have in common that is missing from network shows is the inclusion of sex and nudity. When the cable networks started original programming that seemed to be their biggest concern. Unfortunately that hasn't changed all that much.I've never understood why that was all it took to make a show a hit. Surely this world is not so shallow that a few naked bodies are all it takes to make a hit series? Then again look at the offerings we've had. THE SOPRANOS, BOARDWALK EMPIRE, DEADWOOD and more have all offered some great story telling but at the same time felt the need to go after that base person tuning in by offering enough T&A; to keep them watching. Would the shows have been as good if they didn't include it? I think so. It's too bad that these networks don't want to take the chance to find out. Which brings us to GIRLS.Critically praised and already garnering Emmy nominations, GIRLS is the story of Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham, the shows creator/writer/sometime director), a woman in her early 20s out of college for 2 years whose parents in the opening of the series tell her that they've decided to cut her off. They will no longer pay her bills while she finds out what it is in life she wants. Instead they expect her to get a job like everyone else. Of course Hannah doesn't take this well and blames them for all of her problems expecting them to finance her until she decides what to do or until she gets her book of essays published. Their response? Too bad, get that job.The series, while focusing on Hannah, includes her three best friends as well. Marnie (Allison Williams) is Hannah's best friend and roommate. Her long time boyfriend also spends most of his time there and is oblivious to the fact that Marnie isn't quite so sure she wants to stay with him. He adores her, dotes on her, does everything he can for her and yet she feels there is something missing. Marnie works at an art gallery, something you would think nearly everyone living in New York does since most New York set shows have at least one person with this job description.Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) is a friend to both girls. What she does exactly I wasn't quite sure, but it's enough that she can pay rent and live fairly well. As the series begins she's something the rest of her friends are not which is a virgin. Shoshanna isn't sexually active which the rest of these girls are almost all the time.Lastly we come to Jessa (Jemima Kirke), the free spirit who roams the world where ever she wants to go without a care in the world. Jessa is the Bohemian of the bunch, not caring what anyone thinks of her or her lifestyle. Jessa smokes even though she thinks she's pregnant, considers an abortion without thinking about it and dresses in outfits that only someone on either coast would find normal.So what do these girls talk about, what predicaments do they find themselves in? First off they need to work. Hannah has the most problem finding a job. It seems she lacks the skills necessary to find employment in the big apple. Even Jessa finds a job baby sitting two young girls.The other big focus in their lives seems to be sex. One would think in an enlightened world where the sexual revolution changed the way women were observed that they would hold the upper hand at all times. Instead these women crave sex and constantly seek it out. The bad thing is that in all their choices for partners only one seems to actually care about the other and he's the one who could get dumped any moment. Men in this series rarely care about the women they have sex with and act as if it's just something to be expected. It shows a lot of what the writers of this show think about men. Then again what does it say about women when their only interest in men is sex?A huge number of reviews for this show have compared it to SEX AND THE CITY because of the fact that there are 4 friends who live in New York and who seem interested in sex. That's about the only way they compare. Where as SEX AND THE CITY displayed successful career women living out the fantasy lives that seemed prevalent at the time, GIRLS offers the grittier side of the same coin, showing a world where women struggle to make rent and instead of wealthy, handsome men find themselves in bed with whoever can make it there. Not meant as an insult but the women in this series are also more realistic than in SATC. No glamour girls here but rather women that you see every day.I've noticed another common comment in nearly every review written about this series. The word ""quirky"" comes up in almost every one I've read. I guess the easiest way to gather an audience is to do something ""quirky"" and off the wall and you can stick critics into your back pocket. Then again perhaps ""quirky"" is a lazy way for writers to appear to be in touch with their subject matter and not appear to be unhip.So with all that said do I really hate this series? Actually not quite. I mean it does seem more interested in playing to two simple crowds: those who watch for the vicarious thrill of seeing people having sex on TV and those who think they are so hip and in the know that this series reflects the lives of most everyone living in New York. I belong to neither group so the series isn't a must see on my radar. Occasionally it did offer a few laughs but those were few and far between. It also showed some heart in the fears and struggles of these characters, one scene in particular after Hannah has quit a job and found her ""boyfriend"" took her seriously when she said she wanted to break up. But this is not a show that I would set a DVR to record or rush home to watch an episode of.It is nice to see the world as seen through real life eyes rather than the rose colored glasses everyone wants to use when depicting life in New York, lives filled with glamour and paparazzi everywhere rather than the low rent apartments and pasty white boyfriends. For people who love shows that reflect a more realistic approach to the world you'll probably enjoy this series. I tend to watch shows that give me the opportunity to get away from that world rather than roll around in it. I think most of us have enough problems in our day to day lives that we don't quite find someone else going through problems as entertainment. But as long as you know what you're going into before watching that first episode, perhaps you'll find this one you'll like but then again maybe not.",2,...WITH LITTLE TO OFFER,1357776000,"01 10,

I admit that I was pretty skeptical about ""Girls,"" but after watching just one episode, I found that I absolutely loved it. The entire first season is fantastic. The best thing about the show is the writing, which is incredible. Lena Dunham is incredibly talented. It's hard to believe that she wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this series at such a young age and with very little experience. ""Girls"" follows the trials and tribulations of four young women who have been out of college for a couple of years and are trying to determine what kind of lives they want to build for themselves in New York City. The show is funny, poignant, honest, and heartwarming, and I can't get enough of it. (It kind of sucks that there are only 10 episodes.) I think the acting is wonderful, and a lot of these characters are much more realistic than the people you typically see portrayed on television. The one character I never really warmed up to at all is Shoshanna, who I think is super annoying (I'm glad she doesn't get nearly as much screen time as the other three girls).

After hearing about this show for over year and see Lena Dunham praised so much I finally sat down and watched it.  It was a head scratcher - especially the whole Adam thing and even though I was not sure I really liked the show I was intrigued enough to rent the first disc.  After suffering through the next four episodes I  agree with that doctor that you could not pay me to be 24 again.  I would have stopped then but I forgot to take the show off my rental list and on a long weekend I found myself with nothing to watch but the remainder of the series.  Good news: I actually almost like two episodes: Episode 7 &#8211; Crackcident and Episode 10 &#8211; She Did &#8211; the season finale.  It is interesting that these two episodes feature all the cast at a big event instead of little vignettes with one or two characters.  I also was surprised that Adam (still a little strange and creepy) turned out to be the most interesting thing about the show. I think my biggest problem is the character of Hannah.  Like many reviewers I am having hard time trying to figure out if she is parody or are we supposed to take her serious.  That whole plot line with the Boss was painful to watch on so many levels and frankly I think the actions that the two closest people to her took in the 9th and 10th episodes where the smartest things then did.  But having said all that there is something brave and occasionally appealing about just how brave Lena Dunham is to show herself in such an unappealing manner both emotionally and literally that I do applaud her for that.  Will I watch the second season?  Before watching the finale I would have said no but gosh darn it she did make me a little curious as to where everything was heading and if we might see some growth (finally) in our leading lady's character.,3,2.5 Stars - between don't like and it's o.k.,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,1949,"['watched', 'first', 'episode', 'sampler', 'got', 'HBO', 'when', 'purchased', 'season', 'series', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'maybe', 'True', 'Blood', 'hearing', 'show', 'year', 'see', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'praised', 'so', 'much', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'was', 'head', 'scratcher', 'especially', 'whole', 'Adam', 'thing', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'liked', 'show', 'was', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'rent', 'first', 'disc', 'suffering', 'next', 'four', 'episodes', 'agree', 'doctor', 'could', 'not', 'pay', 'be', '24', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'then', 'forgot', 'take', 'show', 'rental', 'list', 'long', 'weekend', 'found', 'nothing', 'watch', 'remainder', 'series', 'Good', 'news', 'actually', 'almost', 'two', 'episodes', 'Episode', '7', '8211', 'Crackcident', 'Episode', '10', '8211', 'Did', '8211', 'season', 'finale', 'interesting', 'two', 'episodes', 'feature', 'cast', 'big', 'event', 'instead', 'little', 'vignettes', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'also', 'was', 'surprised', 'Adam', 'still', 'little', 'strange', 'creepy', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'show', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'character', 'Hannah', 'many', 'reviewers', 'am', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'parody', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'serious', 'whole', 'plot', 'line', 'Boss', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'frankly', 'think', 'actions', 'two', 'closest', 'people', 'took', '9th', '10th', 'episodes', 'where', 'smartest', 'things', 'then', 'did', 'having', 'said', 'something', 'brave', 'occasionally', 'appealing', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'brave', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'show', 'unappealing', 'manner', 'emotionally', 'literally', 'do', 'applaud', 'Will', 'watch', 'second', 'season', 'watching', 'finale', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'darn', 'did', 'make', 'little', 'curious', 'where', 'everything', 'was', 'heading', 'might', 'see', 'growth', 'finally', 'leading', 'lady', 'character']",Girls: Season 1
