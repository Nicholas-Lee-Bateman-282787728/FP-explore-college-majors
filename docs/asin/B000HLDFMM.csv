I will admit, it seemed a little erratic, but in the end it all seemed to come together.I enjoyed the acting, I didnt once think any part of it was bad. I felt that it was politically charging, and it showed how a family can be ripped apart by something so insignificant as sexual preference.The Star's good looks didnt hurt either, but it was the emotion portrayed by him that really made me feel for him. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind for actors and companies trying to send a message. The emotion alone from the characters made me feel for them, and so again, I say, buy this movie.

I'm SO weary of the faux cinema-verit&eacute; approach used by so many directors now: jerky hand-held cameras have become a clich&eacute;. In this case, it adds nothing and accomplishes little more than producing a feeling of needing to run to the drugstore and find some Dramamine.

1015293,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000HLDFMM,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 5]","The closeted college student son (Matt Newton) of a conservative Southern senator is being forced into being the ""Poster Boy"" (2004) to attract young voters for his dad's re-election.  After he meets a hot, older gay activist (Jack Noseworthy), the son begins to reconsider remaining closeted on campus and to his family, without even knowing that his dad's campaign has been specifically targeted by the activist group.Sounds like a simple, solid plot, and it could have been a great film.  Unfortunately, the first-time director has to work with a boring cliche and platitude laden script by an inexperienced writing team, as all this unfolds in meandering flashbacks building up to the date that the student is supposed to introduce his dad at a college political rally (and even that doesn't make sense, since a rabidly conservative senator would not likely find many supporters on a university campus!)

1015294,A2IF6UKZCV0V0Y,B000HLDFMM,"C. Clay ""drakkar91""","[19, 20]","This is on of the darkest gay-themed films released in America I have seen.  Most reviews have not been favorable, so I'll do my best to tell you what I liked, and what I didn't like.  This is not a bad film, a 1 or 2 star rating seems quite unfair, but reviews are subjective.  It doesn't hold a candle to other gay films I have enjoyed, but the subject is very different.Why I Gave It 4 Stars: It was a solid 3, leaning towards 4 in the beginning, and towards the end, so I compromised.  A solid B- film you might say.The Story: It centers around Henry (played by Matt Newton).  Henry is the son of a ultra conservative Senator from the south.  Think of ""The Birdcage"", minus anything to laugh at.  Henry is also gay.  The film, told in ""flashback style"" as Henry tells his story to a reporter unfolds over the course of 6 months.  Basically, Henry comes out, and family chaos follows.  But not for long, as we're almost to the end of the film.What I Liked: Personally, I liked the edge.  This was almost more of a docu-drama, albeit a ficticious one, which could easily be based on truth.  The actors were good to very good, the overall production was good as well.What I Did Not Like:  I was nearly half-way through the film, starting to get concerned where it was going, before all the character/story sub-plots were connected.  The second half of the movie was strongest.The Rest of the Characters:  Besides our lead, Henry, we also focus on his stereo-typical bigot Republican Father/Senator, and his ""senator's wife"" Mother.  And to the mix, a straight girl Izzi, and her gay male friend Anthony, whose relationship was unusual at best.  Anthony and Henry meet under some unusual circumstances at a college party.The Ending: I never give away specifics, but let's just say it's not a ""Brady Bunch"" wrap-up.  If the ending was all tidied up for viewers, I would have knocked this down to a 3.  Everything about the film was somewhat gritty, dark, ""off"".  It's not the type of film that usually comes out of the USA.  We usually have to watch films like this with sub-titles, so kudos to Here! films and those involved for producing the film.Final Thoughts:  This is not a laugh-out-loud sex romp. No, not at all.  It's a good story trying to make a point about politics, sexuality and family values.  It does all of those well.Unrelated Chatter: Jack Noseworthy, the actor who played Anthony also starred in ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" and in his early years, ""Cats"" in the theater.  Matt Newton (Henry) has appeared on the ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""Judging Amy"".",4,"DARK Art-House Film - The ""Ordinary People"" for 2006",1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,2561,"['darkest', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'released', 'America', 'have', 'seen', 'Most', 'reviews', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'favorable', 'so', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'tell', 'what', 'liked', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'not', 'bad', 'film', '1', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'quite', 'unfair', 'reviews', 'are', 'subjective', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'other', 'gay', 'films', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'subject', 'very', 'different.Why', 'Gave', '4', 'Stars', 'was', 'solid', '3', 'leaning', 'towards', '4', 'beginning', 'end', 'compromised', 'solid', 'B-', 'film', 'might', 'say.The', 'Story', 'Henry', 'played', 'Matt', 'Newton', 'Henry', 'son', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'Senator', 'south', 'Think', 'Birdcage', 'anything', 'laugh', 'Henry', 'also', 'gay', 'film', 'told', 'flashback', 'style', 'Henry', 'story', 'reporter', 'course', '6', 'months', 'Basically', 'Henry', 'out', 'family', 'chaos', 'not', 'long', ""'re"", 'almost', 'end', 'film.What', 'Liked', 'Personally', 'liked', 'edge', 'was', 'almost', 'more', 'docu-drama', 'ficticious', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'based', 'truth', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'production', 'was', 'good', 'well.What', 'Did', 'Not', 'was', 'nearly', 'half-way', 'film', 'starting', 'get', 'concerned', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'character/story', 'sub-plots', 'were', 'connected', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'was', 'strongest.The', 'Rest', 'Characters', 'lead', 'Henry', 'also', 'focus', 'stereo-typical', 'bigot', 'Republican', 'Father/Senator', 'senator', 'wife', 'Mother', 'mix', 'straight', 'girl', 'Izzi', 'gay', 'male', 'friend', 'Anthony', 'relationship', 'was', 'unusual', 'best', 'Anthony', 'Henry', 'meet', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'college', 'party.The', 'Ending', 'never', 'give', 'away', 'specifics', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'not', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'wrap-up', 'ending', 'was', 'tidied', 'up', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'knocked', 'down', '3', 'Everything', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'gritty', 'dark', 'not', 'type', 'film', 'usually', 'USA', 'usually', 'have', 'watch', 'films', 'sub-titles', 'so', 'kudos', 'Here', 'films', 'involved', 'producing', 'film.Final', 'Thoughts', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'sex', 'romp', 'No', 'not', 'good', 'story', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'politics', 'sexuality', 'family', 'values', 'well.Unrelated', 'Chatter', 'Jack', 'Noseworthy', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Anthony', 'also', 'starred', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Movie', 'early', 'years', 'Cats', 'theater', 'Matt', 'Newton', 'Henry', 'appeared', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Judging', 'Amy']",Poster Boy
1015295,A21UUO3LE3SDGD,B000HLDFMM,CWC,"[29, 36]","Given my long time interest in politics, I was anticipating the release of this movie and the pre-publicity hype it had been given. For some reason, I was expecting this movie to be more of a comedy. I think the script would have been more effective and gotten its point across better if it had been. Actually, I don't think I cracked one smile throughout this movie. This flick is only a few steps above the tragedy called ""Ben & Arthur."" It was about as enjoyable quail hunting with Dick Cheney. (heheh)The overall production quality is below average. The interior set scenes are cheap and sparse. The movie doesn't flow smoothly. Many times the script and scenes moved at a disjointed pace. The sound quality is poor and uneven. At one moment I'm straining to hear the dialogue then all of a sudden, the background music jumps 100 decibels. I didn't feel connected to or had any empathy to any of the characters. Karen Allen's portrayal as the senator's wife was lauded in some reviews. I found her character- as everyone else's in the film- to be hoo hum, not complex or multi-dimensional, and disappointing. The ending of the film seemed abrupt and very unsatisifying.

1015298,AF3L7GVC6T94P,B000HLDFMM,Geminiguy,"[2, 2]","""Poster Boy"" had potential and squandered it almost as soon as it begun. This is not to say that this is a ""terrible"" movie because it is good. It isn't excellent or amazing either...The acting in it is fairly decent, if not a little over the top. The leads manage to keep their characters centered but it is the supporting characters that chip away at the foundation. Karen Allen, for one was off to me. Her southern accent seemed forced and in some of the situations she was faced with, she didn't seem to be all there. That isn't to say she lacked presence... she had plenty of that whith her smoldering gaze alone, it just seems as if the character was poorly developed.The plot is a little hard to follow and certain back stories were only there for who knows what reason. The best friend with HIV only seemed there to be overly protective and although HIV was a semi-point in the twisted senator's campaign, she had little to do with the flow of the story. The senators son was great, and in my opinion the only good guy in the film. He lives in the shadow of his fathers conservative politics but eventually steps out of that shadow and becomes his own man. The scenes between him and his father are not friendly ones but they aren't as tense as the filmakers wanted them to be either. The most enjoyment from this film comes from the ""wrap-around"" interview that connects everything else. In it, labels are brought up.

1015299,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HLDFMM,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","POSTER BOY is a film with a lot of potential: the story premise is solid (though a bit tired), the cast of both young and experienced actors is quite fine, and there are some worthwhile statements about our political system, about tolerance and acceptance and family, and about being true to yourself.  Despite all of these aspects that should have made a fine little film the whole thing bogs down with some of the worst editing and camera work on record.  That, and the writers' (Lecia Rosenthal and Ryan Shiraki) need to place platitudes into normal conversation is most distracting.  Zak Tucker as director just didn't seem to have control of this piece.The story itself is rather simple.  Through the gimmick of a confession to a reporter we meet handsome young Henry Kray (the talented Matt Newton), gay since early teens but electing to keep his private life a secret, who is the son of Senator Jack Kray (Michael Lerner) and his lovely but docile wife Eunice (the fine Karen Allen).  It seems that six months prior to the time we are invited into the conversation Henry met Anthony (hunky Jack Noseworthy) whose roommate is HIV positive Izzie (Valerie Geffner).  Henry and Anthony have a one-night stand the day before Jack Kray is to give a speech for re-election at Henry's college.  The Senator accidentally hits Izzie with his car and Eunice insists Izzie stay with them in their suite where the two women bond.  Meanwhile Henry's night with Anthony makes him late for the speech, but a talk to Henry from Jack before the speech telling him what to say (Jack is the best father, loves family values, etc) sticks in Henry's throat and soon after he obeys his father's wishes for the speech introduction, Henry turns to his table partner Anthony and the two kiss openly as the Senator is addressing the crowd - all caught by the media of course.How this moment of honesty alters the lives of everyone around is the crux of the ending.  Not a bad tale, but the camera work is so patchy and disconcertingly disconnected that it defies the viewer to keep the storyline straight.  But if the viewer can keep up visually, the performances by the cast are well worth attention.  There is some very fine talent on the screen of this B movie!  Grady Harp, November 06",3,Editor!

1015300,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000HLDFMM,James Morris,"[1, 1]","If I had read some of the reviews here before I purchased this film, I may not have bought it.  But I did read them before I got around to watching it, and was curious to see if it would turn out to be the mess that many say it is.I am happy to report that it is not quite THAT bad - I certainly don't agree with the reviewer who suggested that it's as putrid a production as Ben and Arthur, which still gets my vote as the worst gay film ever made.  Poster Boy never sinks anywhere near the level of amateurish acting, terrible direction or painfully low budget achieved by that piece of rubbish; then again, few films ever do.I do agree that Poster Boy is just a little too dark for its own good, and surprisingly unentertaining.  As a gay person concerned with the oppression and power wielded by the political right, of course I applaud much of its message.  But I'm not sure that presenting a cartoon-character of a US Senator, or awkwardly executed ""artsy"" gimmicks, is the most effective way to deliver the core message that this film was trying for.  I didn't believe much of the plot for a second, and when I did, it was attached to too many attempts to be avant garde, forgetting its own purpose in the process.Particularly problematic is the character of Jack Cray.  I had trouble accepting that anyone so thoroughly unlikable could sustain a career as a US Senator, especially while abusing everyone around him, including his family, his staff and his supporters.  And the reporter to whom young Henry is relating his story came off as a highly implausible character, in a film that was loaded with too many implausible characters and situations.  I will say that the acting was much better than I was lead to expect by some of the other reviews, especially in light of the material.One of this film's biggest problems is that it tries too hard to be ""cutting edge"", with quirky camera movements and a script that is far too reaching for the talents of those involved.  The sub-plots were particularly annoying, and after a while I gave up trying to keep track of who was who, and why they were behaving the way they were.  Certain aspects of the story made no sense at all, or seemed to be inserted solely to make a point that was either irrelevant or uninteresting.  They would have been better off if they'd stuck to a simple cautionary tale on the evils of hypocrisy, as practiced by the far right.  But the producers and director tried to achieve much more than they actually delivered, and, in the end, it was evident that everyone connected with this film was in way over their heads, which only compounded the ruin of a film that was seriously flawed to begin with.

1015302,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B000HLDFMM,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[1, 1]","The overall theme of this film provides a passably good take on the Republican party's dislike of things gay and the damaging effects such causes and thinking can have on someone's emerging life and persona. Well, I should point out here that the preceding statement has ""let a cat out of the bag"" about this movie---despite DVD cover notes indicating people falling for one another, this is in no way a romantic movie. Sorry, for those of you hoping otherwise, no falling involved.A newer, younger actor, Matt Newton (playing Henry Kray, a US Senator's damaged gay son), acts the socks off an 8 or 9 years more experienced Jack Noseworthy----who truth be told isn't given much to work with in the way of a script (a most inactive activist). Example: During Senator Kray's campus speech, when Henry unleashes the big G-Incendiary in the form of a K-Bomb, Noseworthy, as Anthony, just stands there open-mouthed (only figuratively, most certainly not literally). It's a mouth position that Noseworthy could have put to much better use in the more sexually oriented scenes of this movie---but didn't. (And Noseworthy does have wonderfully sexy lips).Speaking just a bit more on the topic of osculation, the best kiss in the entire movie is one Noseworthy's character gives his fag-hag (which doesn't provide much enjoyment for gay movie-goers). And, more specifically on the guy-to-guy bussing in this film, one is tempted to comment: 'how about opening your mouths some time........yer not kissing your grandmothers, for Pete's sake; ya probably won't give each other a disease.'And let me again highlight a specific acting performance in this film: If a possibly gay actor (Noseworthy) is gonna take on a gay role, you'd think he, of all of them, could do it realistically and give us gay sex scenes that actually come across as sex scenes ('hey, Jack, take a tip from young newbie, Daniel Letterle, as **Ethan Green, will ya.....he doesn't stint at kissing and making out'). You know, I'm beginning to think we get more realistic gay sex when straight men play the roles.Some disjointed here + there thoughts:Oh, if you're looking for even a little sex, you'll find more on the hetero-side than the homo-side.What kind of scene shooting finds us guys laying around naked in the afterglow of sex......while actually in our boxer shorts. Yikes!  Such a scene reminds me of the all too frequent hetero love scenes we see on prime-time TV, complete with the requisite undergarments and wraparound sheets.Something really enjoyed--the further opening up and growth in Newton's acting skills. With a little directorial help, he could maybe play a truly believable gay character in some future project.What sort of writer/director thinking is it that gives us lead character, Anthony, who chases his romantic(?) interest throughout the movie til he catches him........then sez: ""Well, see ya."" And what's with the fast-cut, extreme close-ups ""over-liberally"" sprinkled throughout.....this director must really like to highlight pores + blackheads.-----------------------------------------------------------The End-------------------------------------------------PS--So......have you by now found out whether what they say about sex & politics is true?

Wiersma ""ksmichael""","[4, 4]","This movie certainly holds your interest, and certainly forces you to concentrate, since the scenes and movements are spliced and patched together, presumably for effect, but can be confusing.It's a story about family, and the lengths one might go to cover up, or continue to deny, one's own sexuality, for fear of rejection or anger from, in this case, one's father.  In this case, the father is a despicable character, and I can't imagine particularly feeling beholden to him or worrying a lot about his feelings.Unfortunately all the characters are fairly one-dimensional, and we don't really get the chance to care about them.  There is a significant side story about a friend of the lead character, and I wondered what was going to happen.  (Were they attracted to each other, or what?)  Nothing happens.  It should have been edited out.And then there is this huge culmination of anticipation as you expect something really radical and huge to occur.  The event is fairly modest, actually, and I wondered whether this was really the huge disaster that it is built up to be.  (I thought it was actually a good thing, but six months later the son is still sad and suffering because of it?)I also grew weary of the characters negativity, self-pity, and basically wretched view of themselves and the world.  Perhaps if they all weren't focusing on the worst of themselves and their families/friends, then maybe they'd have time to shed the ""victim"" hat and try to make their world a little better.  It was as if the film-maker intentionally set out to make a negative movie that goes basically nowhere.It is a bold attempt and has some great moments and decent acting.  It's editing and scene-shifting and, turns out, sorta weak story line and unnecessarily negative screen play make this piece much less than it should have been.

1015305,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B000HLDFMM,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[7, 10]","I recently bought this DVD with some apprehension, because I had heard varying opinions on it. The verdict: Good story & acting, but flawed. The film has the hand-held camera feel of a Steven Bochco T.V. series, which, depending on your preference, either brings realism or detracts from the dramatic scenes. Actually, this film felt like more of a ""dramedy"" than a drama---humor kept creeping in to certain scenes. I empathized with Matt Newton's character of Henry Kray, a closeted son of a high-profile senator. He conveyed the agony that his character felt, being constantly controlled (or abused) by his father and frustrated by having to hold others back at arm's length & cloaking himself in anonymity, particularly Jack Noseworthy's character of Anthony, a liberal activist whose personal involvement with Henry becomes far more complicated than he would've ever imagined. Karen Allen injects the same appealing feistiness into her wife-of-a-senator role just as she had done as Harrison Ford's leading lady years ago in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Michael Lerner makes his character a man you'd love to hate, someone who expects all--his family & entourage--to jump whenever he snaps his fingers, to dance to his tune. His portrayal is both a blessing and a curse--I felt he was TOO easy to despise. Yet, I'm sure there are real political figures who get ""lost in the game""; they lose sight of who, and what, is more important in their lives. In politics, image & morality are everything, and as this story demonstrates, the ""game"" can have brutal consequences.  The Skip character--who comes to retrieve the wayward son--is a spineless character, a hypocrite, a brown-noser. Just when you think he has befriended Henry, he turns on him near the end, siding with the father on how ""disgusting"" Henry's lifestyle is, although he accompanied Henry to a gay bar earlier on!However, that coming-out kiss that Henry & Anthony share before a stunned press conference--and senator Jack Kray--made me want to cheer. Jack Kray DESERVED to have his family walk out on him; in a way, this is the film's weak point, as it becomes too obvious that the story is coming to this conclusion. Some plot points are too methodical; I could see them coming a mile away, and this is the movie's main flaw.This movie has a strong theme reflecting on our current headlines: the closeted children of political figures, or even the outing of those officials themselves. If you can forgive its slight budget and obvious plot twists, ""Poster Boy"" can be a powerful drama.",4,Yay or Nay?

The acting is first-rate throughout, no real problems there, but the charactes are two-dimensional (except Allen is giving added dimension to hers - in fact, worthy of an Academy Award) and even cliche.  Publicly in the closet young gay man seeks to have his relationships (non-clinging variety) while dealing within the family structure demanded of a celebrity flag-waving, banner-toting super-conservative father (naturally, the boy wouldn't have a socially liberal senator for a father; goes without saying).  Too bad the senator didn't go out hunting with friends - ha ha.  But unfortunately for the boy, he is outed at the same instant he is intent on outing himself, publicly, by a man he has come to know biblically and then sought to forget by abandoning that morning.  Spurned older man (not exactly good-looking, more odd-looking, OUT actor Noseworthy) seeks vengeance in the best way he knows how - considering he is also a political activist for gay rights.  How's that for a coincidence?  Unfortunately much screentime is devoted to a tiresome character, a youngish woman who'd contracted AIDS from her boyfriend, and her adenoidal judgments and complaints get on one's nerves.
