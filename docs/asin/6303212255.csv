As I recall, they were in the Appalachian Mountains: this was in the Grand Tetons. There are plenty of other differences.Henry Fonda is Clay Spencer, the father, Maureen O'Hara is Olivia, the mother of a brood of nine kids, ""all thoroughbreds,"" as Clay puts it. Clay Boy (that is, Clay Junior) is the oldest, and he not only was the first to graduate from high school, but he won an award from the school for excellence. (He was also the only male in the graduating class.) He wants so much to go to college, but there's just no money for it.The first idea is to get him a scholarship, but the only one still available is for theology: he'd be expected to become a preacher. Problem is, while Mom and the kids all go to church, Clay does not, will not, and can't stand preachers. He says he'd rather see his son in prison than in a pulpit. Anyway, he can't get into college, scholarship or not, because he has not learned any Latin.But the new preacher (Wally Cox) volunteers to teach him, and says he got an A+ himself, from the teacher who is now dean of the college, and his recommendation should be good enough. And he undertakes to teach Clay Boy, offering to do it for free. No, Clay Sr. says, he always pays his debts. OK, says the preacher, than what he wants in payment is for Clay to come to church every Sunday. He hates it, but he agrees.But there's still the question of the money. I won't spoil it by telling you how that problem was solved.This is a family movie in every sense of the word. There is romance, when Clay Boy is pursued by a cute little blond who seems almost as shameless as he is shy. But the most you ever see on the screen is kissing, so don't worry about your kids. Heck, his little sister saw them anyway!It's corny, but it is a heart-warming story, if a little too involved with religion for my taste. But I do love Henry Fonda, and the Grand Tetons make a gorgeous setting for the film, so I will give it three stars.",3,"Fine Old Romantic Comedy; Not Profound, But Entertaining",1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2036,"['probably', 'know', 'story', 'inspired', 'TV', 'series', 'Waltons', 'recall', 'were', 'Appalachian', 'Mountains', 'was', 'Grand', 'Tetons', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'differences.Henry', 'Fonda', 'Clay', 'Spencer', 'father', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'Olivia', 'mother', 'brood', 'nine', 'kids', 'thoroughbreds', 'Clay', 'Clay', 'Boy', 'Clay', 'Junior', 'oldest', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'first', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'won', 'award', 'school', 'excellence', 'was', 'also', 'only', 'male', 'graduating', 'class', 'so', 'much', 'go', 'college', 'just', 'money', 'it.The', 'first', 'idea', 'get', 'scholarship', 'only', 'one', 'still', 'available', 'theology', ""'d"", 'be', 'expected', 'become', 'preacher', 'Problem', 'Mom', 'kids', 'go', 'church', 'Clay', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'preachers', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'son', 'prison', 'pulpit', 'Anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'college', 'scholarship', 'not', 'not', 'learned', 'Latin.But', 'new', 'preacher', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'volunteers', 'teach', 'got', 'A+', 'teacher', 'who', 'now', 'dean', 'college', 'recommendation', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'teach', 'Clay', 'Boy', 'offering', 'do', 'free', 'No', 'Clay', 'Sr.', 'always', 'debts', 'OK', 'preacher', 'what', 'payment', 'Clay', 'come', 'church', 'Sunday', 'still', 'question', 'money', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'how', 'problem', 'was', 'solved.This', 'family', 'movie', 'sense', 'word', 'romance', 'when', 'Clay', 'Boy', 'pursued', 'cute', 'little', 'blond', 'who', 'almost', 'as', 'shameless', 'shy', 'most', 'ever', 'see', 'screen', 'kissing', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'kids', 'Heck', 'little', 'sister', 'saw', 'anyway', 'corny', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'little', 'too', 'involved', 'religion', 'taste', 'do', 'love', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Grand', 'Tetons', 'make', 'gorgeous', 'setting', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

As part of my study, when I'm tired of reading, I've enjoyed watching the old series, The Walton's.Spencer's Mountain was the movie before the series. It brings the Great Depression to life right in front of your eyes.You can't go wrong with Maureen O'Hara in a movie. She portrayed the mom from a different angle. She was just as protective, ever so loving, and with a little bit of sadness borne from having to survive during those tough times. She also still showed that passionate, spicy attitude and energy level that Maureen O'Hara made famous in so many other favorite movies of mine. Nobody can do that better! She was more fearful here as a mom. She was the loving and faithful wife of a man who drank too much, cussed, and was generally passionately overbearing. She wanted to protect her children from being disappointed by refusing to let them try. She believed they would fail and get hurt, so she at times discouraged them from trying to succeed. This one is a little more suggestive and only slightly less wholesome than the Walton series, but not much. Fans of Henry Fonda will enjoy watching him drunk throughout much of the movie. His language is peppered with creative word choices. However, he comes through with a strong defense of his family in some surprising ways, in spite of his faults. James MacArthur does a great job as the oldest son in the family.Grandma and Grandpa are quite different from the series. Grandpa didn't show that fun side that we're all used to from the Waltons. I felt it was there, but we didn't have time to explore it. We briefly got to see the other sons of Grandma and Grandpa as well. There was that dream of a home on the mountain, but I won't reveal how that one turns out in this movie.I truly enjoyed watching Spencer's Mountain.

This is a fine film, heartwarming in an old way without being cliched.  It's easy to understand how it inspired ""The Waltons"" television series, which drew on the novel's characters and its portrayal of American values.The transfer of the movie's setting from Appalachia to the Grand Tetons surprised this reader of the novel.  James MacArthur was too old to play Clay-Boy.  When I read the novel, I never imagined that Clay Spencer's wife Olivia looked like Maureen O'Hara.  But these are the normal quibbles of a reader when Hollywood reworks literature.A more substantive observation is that the novel gave more emphasis to Clay Spencer's self-identity as a landowner, even as he worked for wages at the quarry.  This perhaps diminished the psychological punch of his sacrifice in selling the land at the end of the film.The movie is carried by the sheer beauty of the Grand Tetons and by the power of Henry Fonda's memorable performance.

It was written by the same author but predates the Waltons in terms of its production. Still, there are many similarities as well as a few differences.The Waltons takes place during the era of the great depression. Spencer's Mountain has the 1950's written all over it although it never gives a particular time. The Waltons takes place near Walton Mountain in the Southeast while this film takes place near Spencer's Mountain in the Grand Tetons. The TV series had John-Boy as the eldest son of the family and the movie has Clay-Boy in the same role. Both of these young men seek knowledge and thirst for education. The patriarch of both families is relatively poor and struggles to provide for the family but is a faithful husband and father with those duties as the top priority. Both are wholesome and a bit of Americana. Somebody who liked the Waltons should like Spencer's Mountain as well.Henry Fonda plays the lead and does so in a likeable manner. He will sacrifice anything, including his dreams, for the sake of his family. Maureen O'Hara plays the mother. She is a good, church going woman and the anchor of the family. James MacArthur plays the eldest son. He is dutiful but yearns to get away and better himself. He wants to do something besides work in the quarry all his life.As I said before, it is all very wholesome fare.

I bought it because it was based on Earl Hamner's book.Others have compared this to the Waltons, and others have griped that it's not fair to do so.  I think it's a good ""rough draft"" for The Waltons - The Waltons is the fine finished work.I was most put out by the insipidness of the characters.  The kids were just underdeveloped caricatures...Henry Fonda was unnatural as was O'Hara.  She did not look at all like someone who was a poor mountain wife....but the biggest waste IMHO was the lack of use of the grandparents.  In the TV show, Grandma and Grandpa Walton were awesome.  In this movie, the grandparents are flavorless and colorless, much like something that needs more salt and spice.The story was OK.  I was having a difficult time coming to grips with what exact time period we were in - if it was supposed to be the Depression then I think the only thing that made it seem like that was the fact that the Spencers had no car and an ancient wood burning stove in the kitchen. (no mention made of anything to give us a time frame but when they went to the college town, I saw 1950s type cars, and the wardrobe was definitely post war years; probably late 50's early 60's.)  This is frustrating because part of the charm and draw for The Waltons, for me, was the time period - the period clothing, the old fashioned cars and radios and other period specific elements.  It seems to me that this film was thrown together poorly and expected to be a success simply because of Fonda and O'Hara.If you think of it as a ""rough draft"" for a greater, later work then this is a good film.  I'm glad I purchased it, and will watch it again, but only to find all the items that later turn up in the seasons of The Waltons.

But for those who enjoy a little family-friendly entertainment, this makes for a very pleasant diversion. The gorgeous, panoramic Wyoming vistas are certainly part of the film's charm and Henry Fonda makes himself right at home in the rustic environment, playing the head of the Spencer family. Maureen O'Hara brings her customary authenticity as Fonda's wife, whose struggles to bring her husband into the church pew are met with stubborn resistance. There's wonderful chemistry between Fonda's son, Clay Boy (played nicely by James MacArthur, who spends much of the film running for one reason or another) and the quarry boss's daughter, Claris Coleman (Mimsy Farmer in her first film role).The primary plot line is Clay Boy's desire to go to college and the working class Spencer family's efforts to make it happen. Surrounding the primary story are numerous pleasant sub-plots more designed to create atmosphere than to advance the story in any way. Perhaps a bit dated, the film still manages to bring smiles and warm the heart and even bring a tear or two.

The main plot is good (the family makes immense sacrifices to help their son fulfill his dreams), but the sub-plots are not.""Clay-Boy"" is smart, but not very wise, and certainly not a good example for anyone.  His girlfriend spends all of her time trying to seduce him until she finally succeeds.  When Clay-Boy's father figures out what's been going on, his only advice is to find a better place to fornicate.  That is definitely NOT family fare.The mother, who is supposed to be the devout Christian, is really more of a legalist than anything else.  She has all kinds of rules for herself and her family,but nothing that penetrates the heart.  As soon as things go wrong, she is ready to throw it all away.  This is not Christianity.  Most Christians can see that, I hope, but others too often think this is what loving God is all about.  Far from it.Another word about the message of this film.  In the trailer, it is said that ClayBoy becomes a man that summer.  Read: he has sex for the first time.  Have we gotten that stupid that we think having sex makes a boy a man?  I say that resisting temptation makes a boy a man.  Choosing a wife and loving her only for the rest of your days makes you a man.  Having integrity, knowing that God is higher than you are and that you owe Him everything, raising your children to do the same....those are things that make a man.  Giving in to the first temptations that come your way does nothing to make you ""grow up""!I'm very disappointed in this film.

I was delighted to see that it did.If you've ever watched the TV series THE WALTONS then you'll know part of the story. This movie was based on the book by Earl Hamner which also inspired that TV series. It tells the story of young Clay Spencer, a teen about to graduate from college who has the desire to learn more. Not only does he have that desire but his parents (Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara) also want to see him get the education. Fonda has no desire to watch his son toil away in the quarry where he has all these years.Not only do we get to see Clay and learn of his desires we get to see the entire Spencer clan as well. Clay has numerous brothers and sisters as does his father. His father's brothers go so far as to help him in building the dream house he has always promised his wife.This movie is all about family and sticking together. It's a movie that will touch your heart and your soul. There are some tragic moments in the film that have stuck with me since seeing it as a child.

Of course, we're dealing with 1950's Hollywood and Technicolor, with a mother who's had nine kids but looks like Maureen O'Hara, with stupendous scenery (not Virginia, as it should have been, but the Grand Tetons), and even the university Dean is always available for a chat.  The women are all lascivious and luscious beckoning, while the men are older, hardened, but lusty old goats underneath.There's a lot of bottom-smacking, which in the case of the supposedly teenage Clayboy (MacArthur from Hawaii Five-0, ""book-em Danno""), sure looks weird.  He's far too old for the part of the eager-beaver schoolboy, which makes his resistance to the local young tart even more absurd.Hamner, the writer of the the semi-autobiographical story upon which this movie is based, certainly knew poverty.  He wrote about his youth to show that it was a good one, in SPITE of the poverty, because of the family togetherness.  One look at this glossed-over version of Appalachan-style poverty (man, those quarrymen's huts look like great vacation cabins!) will show you that Hollywood really, really, really hates to show reality.However, all this being said, it's a pleasure to see old-time America in this film, with its family values, including the classic example of the father who refuses to go to church and listen to the preacher, because he enjoys cussing, dancing, kissing, drinking and so on.  This is thoroughly thrashed out with the Dean and the preacher, who look at this blaspheming frontiersman and logsplitter as a nutcase, whose gleaming redhead wife will surely change him.  Well, it's the free Latin lessons from the preacher for his college-bound Clayboy that force old SPencer to go to church, where any unfatigued eye will note, old goat Spencer is smack in the front row looking at the legs of the female choir.  Otherwise, wife and kiddies always go to church.  If this is typical American, well, gee, things were spiffy back then.  A man could be okay as long as the wife went to church, and I suppose that now, both feel okay without church.Those of you who've seen the series, ""The Waltons"", will think this a poor substitute for telling the 1930's Appalachian truth, but it's still worth a look-see for sheer Hollywood baloney.
