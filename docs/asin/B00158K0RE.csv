Funny, I thought they were in a fort at the time.

Acting was good considering the era and plot was o.k. Still, it had it's funny moments and little sneekery, i.e. cutting cards with the blacksmith, ""dismissed"".I thought it strange the Indians were more compasionate when it came to tossing anyone off the cliff.

Sammy Davis, Jr. (Jonah) has the part of Gunga Din. The movie actually has holes large enough to drive a Mack truck through so  a suspension of belief is necessary. Once that is done you can enjoy the movie. It's got some sections that are action-packed. I've been looking forward to this being released on DVD but never thought it would be. I actually saw this movie as a ten year old at the theatre; my memory of it was that it was funny & adventurous. I might have seen this movie shown once on TV but it's been well over 30 years since I last saw it.Mike is the senior sergeant of the three, the brains & the schemer. Chip is the drinker, Dean Martin is really a ham in the role. Larry is the educated one who's enlistment is about expired & going to get married. A band of Indians have wiped out all the citizens a town & it's up to the three sergeants to garrison the town. It's never explained why this town must be held. The Indians appear to be an unknown tribe, turns out they're a fanatical religion, known as the Ghost Dancers, whose mission is to wipe out the white man so that the buffalo will return. Joey Bishop's role as the Sergeant Major is a minor role & he's a straight man.This was the third Rat Pack movie & only the second one that had the entire bunch. It's the least well known of the four movies & it's not without reason. Fans can tell that the leads are good friends, it's very apparent. John Sturges was the director, he was responsible for numerous Hollywood classics, especially westerns, the most famous being The Magnificent Seven. Sinatra was the producer so he was in control of the project; he was notorious for doing scenes in no more than two takes, one if he could get away with it. That might keep a scene & actor fresh but it leads to some sloppiness too.

Sergeants 3 is the second and last, to feature these five.  The western starts out quite well, but later fizzles into rather mundane silliness.  Still, this is mostly a fun and entertaining time, with some Hollywood legends.Sergeants Merry (Sinatra), Deal (Martin), and Barrett (Lawford), are assigned to lead a group of soldiers on a mission to find out what happened at the town of Medicine Bend, where it is suspected that Indians may have attacked.  Bishop is also a soldier, while Sammy Davis is Jonah Williams, an entertainer who tags along with the group.Soon after their arrival in town, a furious battle with the Indians ensues.  The action highlight of director John Sturges's film is quite well-done, punctuated with plenty of explosions, and executed with much gusto and mirth.  The attackers, known as the `Ghost Dancers', are driven back into the hills.  What happened to the town's inhabitants is not made clear.Against orders, Deal heads into the mountains to find the Ghost Dancers' lair.  Together with Williams, the pair discover the Indians' secret hideout, a cave high in the mountains.  Merry leads an improbable rescue mission, where a handful of soldiers hold off a vastly superior force.  Bodies keep flying off cliffs, and Williams saves the day by escaping to sound a decisive warning.  It all doesn't make much sense, but with no casualties among the Rat Packers, things end better than could be expected.Mostly an action-adventure, with some comic moments, Sergeants 3 is more to be enjoyed for the distinguished cast, one big battle, and some quality cinematography.

Dean and Frank are clearly the stars here, and they do just fine.
