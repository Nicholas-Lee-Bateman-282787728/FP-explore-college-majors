1279805,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002NB420I,Haunted Flower,"[7, 9]","5 Blu-ray Discs, being released October 26, 2010For all you history buffs, ""World War II 360"" is over 17 hours of battle action in the Pacific. It has two complete series from the History Channel. The first called Battle 360 covers the war career of the USS Enterprise (Star Trek fans, feel free to drool), which was the only carrier to be front and center in EVERY battle in the Pacific during the war. The amazing story is told through historians, Top Gun graduates (once more, feel free to drool, my husband loves Top Gun), and sailors who were actually THERE.The USS Enterprise was a giant carrier that was equipped with tons of high-artillery machine guns, a large crew, and a deck carrying several small aircraft ready to take to the air for scouting or battle. Not only are the individual battles exciting, but there are a few funny stories put in too like of a drunk guy relieving himself in a stairwell. The first battle was discovering America had been pulled into the war in the first place with the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. In one terrifying moment, a Japanese pilot whose aircraft was damaged attempted to crash it right into the USS Enterprise, but one American's quick thinking saved the carrier. He jumped into one of the American aircraft and fired away at the Japanese aircraft which through off its trajectory and it scraped the deck and the aircraft of the American but coasted off to crash in the water. The Captain had been watching at the time and requested the hero immediately come see him in his office where he gave the officer two promotions for his bravery.Almost the entire sequence of battles is done in a CGI format that makes it look like a really cool video game, but it is fascinating to watch, especially in Blu-ray. The bonus features are additional footage from these stories.The second series is Patton 360 following General George S. Patton Jr. leading soldiers into North Africa, in the Sicilian invasion, and marching across Europe to take down Hitler's Third Reich. In the same manner as the Pacific battles, these fights are also animated in a video game format where historians and soldiers can talk about the strategies used in detail. Once again the bonus features consist of additional footage of these accounts.If you are a history buff and are particularly interested in battles, how they came about, strategies, and all the excitement that comes with them, this is a set for you!",5,"Really exciting & amazing history, does fantastic on CGI and Blu-ray",1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,2445,"['5', 'Blu-ray', 'Discs', 'being', 'released', 'October', '26', '2010For', 'history', 'buffs', 'World', 'War', 'II', '360', '17', 'hours', 'battle', 'action', 'Pacific', 'two', 'complete', 'series', 'History', 'Channel', 'first', 'called', 'Battle', '360', 'war', 'career', 'USS', 'Enterprise', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'feel', 'free', 'drool', 'was', 'only', 'carrier', 'be', 'front', 'center', 'EVERY', 'battle', 'Pacific', 'war', 'amazing', 'story', 'told', 'historians', 'Top', 'Gun', 'graduates', 'once', 'more', 'feel', 'free', 'drool', 'husband', 'Top', 'Gun', 'sailors', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'THERE.The', 'USS', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'giant', 'carrier', 'was', 'equipped', 'tons', 'high-artillery', 'machine', 'guns', 'large', 'crew', 'deck', 'carrying', 'several', 'small', 'aircraft', 'ready', 'take', 'air', 'scouting', 'battle', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'individual', 'battles', 'exciting', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'stories', 'put', 'too', 'drunk', 'guy', 'relieving', 'stairwell', 'first', 'battle', 'was', 'discovering', 'America', 'had', 'been', 'pulled', 'war', 'first', 'place', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Japanese', 'one', 'terrifying', 'moment', 'Japanese', 'pilot', 'aircraft', 'was', 'damaged', 'attempted', 'crash', 'right', 'USS', 'Enterprise', 'one', 'American', 'quick', 'thinking', 'saved', 'carrier', 'jumped', 'one', 'American', 'aircraft', 'fired', 'away', 'Japanese', 'aircraft', 'trajectory', 'scraped', 'deck', 'aircraft', 'American', 'coasted', 'off', 'crash', 'water', 'Captain', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'time', 'requested', 'hero', 'immediately', 'come', 'see', 'office', 'where', 'gave', 'officer', 'two', 'promotions', 'bravery.Almost', 'entire', 'sequence', 'battles', 'done', 'CGI', 'format', 'look', 'really', 'cool', 'video', 'game', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'especially', 'Blu-ray', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'additional', 'footage', 'stories.The', 'second', 'series', 'Patton', '360', 'following', 'General', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'Jr.', 'leading', 'soldiers', 'North', 'Africa', 'Sicilian', 'invasion', 'marching', 'Europe', 'take', 'down', 'Hitler', 'Third', 'Reich', 'same', 'manner', 'Pacific', 'battles', 'fights', 'are', 'also', 'animated', 'video', 'game', 'format', 'where', 'historians', 'soldiers', 'can', 'talk', 'strategies', 'used', 'detail', 'Once', 'again', 'bonus', 'consist', 'additional', 'footage', 'are', 'history', 'buff', 'are', 'particularly', 'interested', 'battles', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'strategies', 'excitement', 'set']",N/A

1279809,A7Z2DWCF66Q4H,B002NB420I,L. Der,"[0, 0]","This is a review of the Blu-ray set which contains BATTLE 360 (the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise) and PATTON 360 (Gen. George S. Patton). This is one of the best and most informative World War II documentary sets I've seen.BATTLE 360 (3 discs, 10 episodes) covers the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most-decorated Navy warship of World War II, from Pearl Harbor to its unfortunate post-war scrapping. It includes actual, stock and CGI video footage with the CGI being relatively good (one obvious mistake in the documentary's use of stock footage is showing weapons being loaded on the Enterprise's bombers---some of the weapons shown are AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles which were used in large numbers in the Vietnam War 20 years after the Enterprise saw combat in World War II). An added bonus are many interviews with former crew members of the Enterprise and its escort ships. Very informative commentary is provided by military historians including Jonathan Parshall and Martin Morgan. Highlights include the Battle of Midway, the Solomon Islands, the raid on Truk and the Battle of Leyte Gulf (the largest naval battle in history). When BATTLE 360 was shown on the History Channel, one of the sponsors was Enterprise-Rent-A-Car, whose founder, Jack Taylor, was a pilot on the Enterprise in World War II.PATTON 360 (2 discs, 10 episodes) follows the World War II story of Gen. George S. Patton, arguably the best and most controversial Allied general of the war. If you're a fan of the movie PATTON starring George C. Scott, PATTON 360 gives you a more detailed account of Patton which will give you a much better understanding of what transpires in the movie PATTON. Highlights of PATTON 360 including his victory over the Afrika Korps after his predecessor's humiliating defeat at the Kasserine Pass, Patton's race with British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in Sicily, his relieving of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge (perhaps his most worthwhile accomplishment) and the invasion of Germany, Patton's other race with Montgomery. Also included is a segment on Patton's Task Force Baum, the disastrous attempt to liberate POWs, specifically his son-in-law, at a German POW camp in the final months of the war in Europe. Like BATTLE 360, PATTON 360 includes numerous informative interviews with soldiers who served under Patton. Excellent commentary is provided by military historians including Rick Atkinson and Martin Marshall.There is one negative about this set---the documentary's excessive use of distracting CGI including bizarre celestial-type maps of stars, etc. which float throughout the documentaries during interviews with veterans and war historians and during actual combat file footage Also, stock footage, CGI tanks, warships and aircraft are often colored in purple, orange, pink, blue and other colors.Overall, this documentary set is one of the best World war II documentaries available. It is a highly recommended for any military documentary collection.",5,"excellent documentaries on USS Enterprise, Gen.

The story detail and completeness is just great with actual footage throughout. Computer graphics are added in between the actual footage to show you strategy, weapon configurations, and battle confrontation details that are not in the actual footage. Same for the war in the Pacific. In the Pacific they follow the Big-E through-out the war, the carrier Enterprise. The carrier Enterprise was the only naval ship that was in every major battle and survived. I purchased this film on Amazon for the lowest price and speed delivery. I and my wife have watched this film over 7 times in the past 4 months since I purchased it. You will never get tired of this film. It is just mind boggling the massiveness of WWII, failures and successes, and dumb US government politics that made the war twice as long as necessary.
