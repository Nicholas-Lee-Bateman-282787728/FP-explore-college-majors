335878,A3TMC106MIY8S5,6302799120,A. Edward Azad,"[2, 2]","This is a 1980 screwball comedy about a fugitive (Chevy Chase) who hides out on the property of his ex (Goldie Hawn) and her unknowing D.A. husband (Charles Grodin).  I thought I wouldn't like it.  Chevy Chase irritates me and I didn't much care for Foul Play, another comedy with the exact same leads.  In that one, chase and Goldie were running around trying to prevent someone from shooting the Pope.  They were clearly brought together again to replicate that ""success"", but this movie is alright.I think it's because Chase doesn't really have a character.  He's just a walking tornado of chaos which people have to react to.  Goldie Hawn traded him in for the successful-if-bland attorney, but it's hinted she belongs with Chevy after all since she's one banana short of a fruit salad, herself.  Grodin does his usual schtick of whining and grumbling.  It's a simple formula but funny.  And I'm a crabby individual, so if this movie made me smile, it should have you rolling on the floor.I kind of have a fondness for electric 70s cheese.

335879,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6302799120,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[8, 8]","Neil Simon's 1980 comedy starring Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn, Robert Guillame, and Charles Grodin is a very, very funny movie, from start to finish. Nick Gardenia (Chase), is a divorced novelist who is living a simple, quiet life. He just wants to work on his book. But things start to go bad right away, as he is visited by two low-life crooks who want to use him as a decoy of sorts. Under the threat of death, or at least, serious bodily harm, he is forced to rob a bank, and as they all make their getaway, he is thrown from the car and left by the side of the road to fend for himself, as he is the one caught on the bank's surveillence camera. He is now a fugitive with all of the state's police force searching for him.Desperate, he shows up at the home of his ex-wife, Glenda Parks (Hawn), a defense attorney, and his only hope. She is a very kind-hearted woman with a beautiful soul and a soft spot for the downtrodden, maybe she'll help? The problem is, her current husband, Ira Parks (Charles Grodin), is about to be appointed Attorney General, and if he finds Nick hiding in his house, he'll turn him in to the police, probably after a quick roughing up. And if anyone finds him there, Ira could easily lose all chances at his beloved Attorney General position, because his wife is harboring a fugitive. So Glenda has to hide Nick from Ira and everyone else as she tries to convince him to turn himself in, all the while they are about to throw an elegant dinner party celebrating Ira's good fortune, and Glenda has to play dumb, as if all is well.As the plot unfolds, we see that Glenda still has some strong feelings for Nick, and she is very conflicted; ethically, she must defend Nick in court, but personally she must turn off her long dormant feelings for him. And Ira can't find out she has been harboring him. And the situation becomes more and more complex as a second dinner party approaches; The governor himself is invited this time, and Nick, through a series of strange twists, winds up helping to serve the food and drinks at this particular dinner party.This film has large doses of physical and verbal humor throughout, chiefly Chase's pratfalls, per his days from ""Saturday Night Live"" (he was an original cast member in 1975), and Hawn's character's  gradual breakdown from the stress of hiding her ex-husband from her current husband; Goldie Hawn is a very good comic actress, and in this particular story, she's brilliant.It's an excellent screenplay, well-executed direction, and brilliant comedy throughout.One caviat, if you expect a lot of extra features, or any features, for that matter, you'll be disappointed; there aren't any. But this is such a good movie, that shouldn't matter.I have watched this movie many times since 1980, and laugh out loud every time.Enjoy.",5,Never a dull moment,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,2805,"['Neil', 'Simon', '1980', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Robert', 'Guillame', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'Nick', 'Gardenia', 'Chase', 'divorced', 'novelist', 'who', 'living', 'simple', 'quiet', 'life', 'just', 'work', 'book', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'bad', 'right', 'away', 'visited', 'two', 'low-life', 'crooks', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'decoy', 'sorts', 'threat', 'death', 'least', 'serious', 'bodily', 'harm', 'forced', 'rob', 'bank', 'make', 'getaway', 'thrown', 'car', 'left', 'side', 'road', 'fend', 'one', 'caught', 'bank', 'surveillence', 'camera', 'now', 'fugitive', 'state', 'police', 'force', 'searching', 'him.Desperate', 'up', 'home', 'ex-wife', 'Glenda', 'Parks', 'Hawn', 'defense', 'attorney', 'only', 'hope', 'very', 'kind-hearted', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'soul', 'soft', 'spot', 'downtrodden', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'help', 'problem', 'current', 'husband', 'Ira', 'Parks', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'be', 'appointed', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Nick', 'hiding', 'house', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'police', 'probably', 'quick', 'roughing', 'up', 'anyone', 'there', 'Ira', 'could', 'easily', 'lose', 'chances', 'beloved', 'Attorney', 'General', 'position', 'wife', 'harboring', 'fugitive', 'So', 'Glenda', 'hide', 'Nick', 'Ira', 'everyone', 'else', 'convince', 'turn', 'are', 'throw', 'elegant', 'dinner', 'party', 'celebrating', 'Ira', 'good', 'fortune', 'Glenda', 'play', 'dumb', 'well.As', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'see', 'Glenda', 'still', 'strong', 'feelings', 'Nick', 'very', 'conflicted', 'ethically', 'must', 'defend', 'Nick', 'court', 'personally', 'must', 'turn', 'off', 'long', 'dormant', 'feelings', 'Ira', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'been', 'harboring', 'situation', 'more', 'more', 'complex', 'second', 'dinner', 'party', 'approaches', 'governor', 'invited', 'time', 'Nick', 'series', 'strange', 'twists', 'up', 'helping', 'serve', 'food', 'drinks', 'particular', 'dinner', 'party.This', 'film', 'large', 'doses', 'physical', 'verbal', 'humor', 'chiefly', 'Chase', 'pratfalls', 'days', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'original', 'cast', 'member', '1975', 'Hawn', 'character', 'gradual', 'breakdown', 'stress', 'hiding', 'ex-husband', 'current', 'husband', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'very', 'good', 'comic', 'actress', 'particular', 'story', 'brilliant.It', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'well-executed', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'throughout.One', 'caviat', 'expect', 'lot', 'extra', 'features', 'features', 'matter', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', ""n't"", 'such', 'good', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'times', '1980', 'out', 'loud', 'time.Enjoy']",N/A

I'm an old school movie buff who relishes those old-timey musicals and screwball comedies and the way they spoke back then and the sheer energy with which the actors plied their craft. Seems Like Old Times is a 1980 screwball comedy that hearkens back to those classic sensibilities. Neil Simon wrote it which is a sure-fire guarantee that it shan't suck. It reunites Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn who two years before sparkled inFoul Play(1978). It made me crave chicken pepperoni.Somewhere in California (it's assumed) writer Nick Gardenia (Chase) inhabits a cabin in the woods, and there he types away in contented solitude. That is, until two crooks show up and force Nick to drive to Carmel, CA. The crooks' modus operandi is to pick out an innocent bystander, hand him an empty gun, and force him to approach the bank teller with the robbery note. It's just Nick's tough luck that he sports a ""nice, honest face."" Which is then captured on the bank's surveillance camera.In Brentwood, CA, liberal litigator (and soft touch) Glenda Parks (Hawn) habitually champions and even takes in strays and reprobates. She's got a generous heart. It's unintentional, but she's sort of launched her very own makeshift rehabilitation program. Her domestic staff is mostly comprised of lawbreakers she's represented in court.Her husband tolerates this, sort of. Ira J. Parks (Charles Grodin) is the smug District Attorney of L.A. county. He's a lock as the next Attorney General. He's about to have the governor over for a private dinner party to work out the details. And the governor loves chicken pepperoni. Why the governor loves chicken pepperoni isn't important. It's relevant only in that it becomes the talking point that triggers Glenda's epic nervous breakdown.The real reason for Glenda's hysterics is, of course, that her flaky ex-husband Nick's shown up unexpectedly. A fugitive from justice, Nick is claiming innocence and pleading for Glenda's help and also flirting with Glenda and all the time slipping under the spare bedroom's bed. Glenda is at wits' end. Her current husband, the smug D.A., refuses to believe in Nick's innocence, citing Nick's two years spent in Mexican jail on account of drug smuggling (Nick claims innocence for this, too; Nick claims a lot of stuff). Ira doesn't give an ef. Remember, he's up for Attorney General. He desperately needs to avoid a scandal. And since his cook is off getting her feet scraped, he also needs someone to put together some chicken pepperoni.This movie made me smile the entire time. Neil Simon delivers a non-stop barrage of witty patter and amusing visual gags. He also peppers in a brace of offbeat side characters, given life by a game supporting cast. Robert Guillaume lends his classy presence as the D.A.'s law partner. He saves his comic chops until that classic dinner sequence. Judd Omen plays the long-suffering judge. Yvonne Wilder is that outspoken cook, Aurora de la Hoya. And T.K. Carter is awesome as Chester the young chauffer/hubcap absconder. All conspire to elevate the madcap antics.So, yeah, this is a throwback to the golden age of screwball. Goldie Hawn would've fit right in in 1930s and '40s Hollywood. She makes a terrific dizzy dame. There's such a sweetness to her and this unaffected joy of living. And I don't know exactly how, but Chevy Chase complements her beautifully. There's only a few Chevy Chase movies I like, and those are mostly his earlier stuff. In his other pictures, I think he's annoyingly obnoxious (sorry, but that includes Community). But, here, I laughed at his repertoire of deadpan one-liners and physical shtick. The two leads' chemistry is inarguable and drives the narrative. It sucks that they only made two movies together. I like that Neil Simon writes layers into Hawn and Grodin's characters. The D.A. is smug but not without his redeemable traits. I like that Glenda, instead of predictably falling in with Nick, is throughout the movie torn between her ex- and current husbands. Still, there's not really a doubt as to where her instinctive preference lies. The film's last shot, this freeze frame of Glenda's startled but then jubilant expression, only punctuates it. And no worries, the governor got his chicken pepperoni after all. He thought it was spicy.",4,"""With your ex-husband on the loose, we're a lot safer with chicken pepperoni.""",1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,4401,"['had', 'pick', 'favorite', 'era', 'cinema', ""'d"", 'probably', 'roll', ""'30s"", 'okay', 'guess', 'two', 'eras', ""'m"", 'old', 'school', 'movie', 'buff', 'who', 'old-timey', 'musicals', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'way', 'spoke', 'back', 'then', 'sheer', 'energy', 'actors', 'plied', 'craft', 'Old', 'Times', '1980', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'back', 'classic', 'sensibilities', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'wrote', 'sure-fire', 'guarantee', 'sha', ""n't"", 'suck', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'who', 'two', 'years', 'sparkled', 'inFoul', 'Play', '1978', 'made', 'crave', 'chicken', 'pepperoni.Somewhere', 'California', 'assumed', 'writer', 'Nick', 'Gardenia', 'Chase', 'cabin', 'woods', 'there', 'away', 'contented', 'solitude', 'two', 'crooks', 'show', 'up', 'force', 'Nick', 'drive', 'Carmel', 'CA', 'crooks', 'modus', 'operandi', 'pick', 'out', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'hand', 'empty', 'gun', 'force', 'approach', 'bank', 'teller', 'robbery', 'note', 'just', 'Nick', 'tough', 'luck', 'sports', 'nice', 'honest', 'face', 'Which', 'then', 'captured', 'bank', 'surveillance', 'camera.In', 'Brentwood', 'CA', 'liberal', 'litigator', 'soft', 'touch', 'Glenda', 'Parks', 'Hawn', 'habitually', 'champions', 'even', 'strays', 'reprobates', 'got', 'generous', 'heart', 'unintentional', 'sort', 'launched', 'very', 'own', 'makeshift', 'rehabilitation', 'program', 'domestic', 'staff', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'lawbreakers', 'represented', 'court.Her', 'husband', 'sort', 'Ira', 'J', 'Parks', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'smug', 'District', 'Attorney', 'L.A.', 'county', 'lock', 'next', 'Attorney', 'General', 'have', 'governor', 'private', 'dinner', 'party', 'work', 'out', 'details', 'governor', 'chicken', 'pepperoni', 'Why', 'governor', 'chicken', 'pepperoni', ""n't"", 'important', 'relevant', 'only', 'talking', 'point', 'Glenda', 'epic', 'nervous', 'breakdown.The', 'real', 'reason', 'Glenda', 'hysterics', 'course', 'flaky', 'ex-husband', 'Nick', 'shown', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'fugitive', 'justice', 'Nick', 'claiming', 'innocence', 'pleading', 'Glenda', 'help', 'also', 'flirting', 'Glenda', 'time', 'slipping', 'spare', 'bedroom', 'bed', 'Glenda', 'wits', 'end', 'current', 'husband', 'smug', 'D.A.', 'believe', 'Nick', 'innocence', 'citing', 'Nick', 'two', 'years', 'spent', 'Mexican', 'jail', 'account', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'Nick', 'innocence', 'too', 'Nick', 'lot', 'stuff', 'Ira', ""n't"", 'give', 'ef', 'Remember', 'up', 'Attorney', 'General', 'desperately', 'avoid', 'scandal', 'cook', 'getting', 'feet', 'scraped', 'also', 'someone', 'put', 'together', 'chicken', 'pepperoni.This', 'movie', 'made', 'smile', 'entire', 'time', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'non-stop', 'barrage', 'witty', 'patter', 'amusing', 'visual', 'gags', 'also', 'brace', 'offbeat', 'side', 'characters', 'given', 'life', 'game', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'classy', 'presence', 'D.A', 'law', 'partner', 'comic', 'chops', 'classic', 'dinner', 'sequence', 'Judd', 'Omen', 'long-suffering', 'judge', 'Yvonne', 'Wilder', 'outspoken', 'cook', 'Aurora', 'de', 'la', 'Hoya', 'T.K', 'Carter', 'awesome', 'Chester', 'young', 'chauffer/hubcap', 'absconder', 'conspire', 'elevate', 'madcap', 'antics.So', 'yeah', 'throwback', 'golden', 'age', 'screwball', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'would', ""'ve"", 'fit', 'right', '1930s', ""'40s"", 'Hollywood', 'terrific', 'dizzy', 'dame', 'such', 'sweetness', 'unaffected', 'joy', 'living', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'beautifully', 'only', 'few', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'movies', 'like', 'are', 'mostly', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'other', 'pictures', 'think', 'annoyingly', 'obnoxious', 'sorry', 'Community', 'here', 'laughed', 'repertoire', 'deadpan', 'one-liners', 'physical', 'shtick', 'two', 'leads', 'chemistry', 'inarguable', 'narrative', 'only', 'made', 'two', 'movies', 'together', 'like', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'layers', 'Hawn', 'Grodin', 'characters', 'D.A', 'smug', 'not', 'redeemable', 'traits', 'like', 'Glenda', 'instead', 'predictably', 'falling', 'Nick', 'movie', 'torn', 'ex-', 'current', 'husbands', 'Still', 'not', 'really', 'doubt', 'where', 'instinctive', 'preference', 'lies', 'film', 'last', 'shot', 'freeze', 'frame', 'Glenda', 'startled', 'then', 'jubilant', 'expression', 'only', 'worries', 'governor', 'got', 'chicken', 'pepperoni', 'thought', 'was', 'spicy']",N/A

Oh, the film itself is crafted with very enjoyable comedic performances bolstered by an exceptionally hilarious script. Chevy was the at the top of his game in 1980, still fresh off his star-making stint on SNL, and it shows. Teamed with bubbly Goldie Hawn and legendary screenwriter Neil Simon - this was a success long before a single strip of film passed thru the cameras.The movie opens with journalist and ex-con Nick Gardenia, recent resident of the notorious Mexican prison system. Having served his time for trafficking in narcotics, he's finally free to write his incredible tale of misguided justice and gringo survival all while in harm's way.During the years spent avoiding amateur proctology exams he lost everything and everyone at home. His reputation, his friends, and most especially his beautiful wife - all gone. Divorce was inevitable. No one believed he was down there looking to do a story about illegal immigration but ended up sitting on a 5-pound parcel of heroin.Five years later with freedom finally back in his grasp, life is about to take yet another unexpected turn - for the worse.Two criminal knuckleheads who make their living abducting and forcing innocents to rob banks by proxy have found their newest ""partner"". Having done the deed and his usefulness at an end, Nick is given his exit pass from the gang - tossed out of the getaway car while still doing 65mph. Ouch.Broke, broken, bruised and on the run from law enforcement, Nick reaches out to his last hope. His former wife is a soft-hearted defense attorney for the downtrodden and defenseless. If there's one person who can extricate him from his most recent twisted mess - it's Glenda.There is, however, one small sticking point.Glenda is currently married to Ira Park, the District Attorney for Los Angeles County. His job and his desire make for an unexpected confluence of fun events for the man. Why? While it's his job to bring his wife's first husband to justice, he actually detests Nick on a personal level, him having got ""there"" first. His capture and re-incarceration will be a pleasurable side bonus.Carpet bombing the city is considered a viable option.Hilarity ensues as Nick takes refuge in the only place safe from all the cops - hiding in Glenda and Ira's home.Personal Notes:- 'Times' showcases a fantastic cast of great and near great character actors. From the always hilarious Harold Gould and irrepressible Charles Grodin, to slick T.K. Carter and droll Robert Guillaume. And it wouldn't be right not to mention the wonderful weaselly performance by Marc Alaimo and Yvonne Wilder's sublime execution of corn-footed house cook Aurora. Love it and them all!- I spent more than a few decades fantasizing about, and with the advent of the internet, finally attempting to locate a proper recipe for ""Chicken Pepperoni"". X-DNo such luck. It was, to the best of my research, something that was only invented in the mind of Neil Simon. However, it appears that this film inspired more than a few homemade versions. One of these days I'll give a couple of them a shot. Although most appear to be variants of Chicken Cacciatore, so I'm not as amped as I was in years past. As usual, the fantasy is often better than the reality.- This movie contains one of the most interesting film anachronisms I've ever seen. At one point Grodin's character points out that ""California is a very conservative state"" - which was true at the time. But, wow, look at them now. &lt;smh>- If you've read this far, then you know I stated I had mixed feelings about this flick, yet I tagged it with five stars. The emotional baggage I carry when screening this comes in the form of a twisted blend of fond recollection and perverted regret.

Neil Siomon was at the peak of his comedic perfection. Chevy Chase & Goldie Hawn rekindle their chemistry from Foul Play and take it to the next level.  Charles Grodin's deadpan and Robert Guillame's  presence just add to the mix to make it perfect.  T.K. Carter and a list of other cameo-esque bit parts bring it home.  Hysterical.  I watched it with my 13 year old daughter and I gotta tell you it was a real treat to see a movie that relied on dialogue and acting and was funny at every turn.  Sloppy by today's standards as far as suspending our disbelief in a few places, with a bit of hurried ending, still this movie is what comedy was in the late 70s and early 80s.  Genuine.  Perfect.  I don't want to get into the old cliche of ""they don't make them like this anymore,"" but being a cliche doesn't make it any less true:  they don't.  This is lost Hollywood.  Chevy, like Bill Murray, like Belushi, like so many of his Saturday Night Live brethren, was the ultimate cynical smartass and it worked so well (Any chance of slowing down to 55?).

The soundtrack sounds as though it was recorded in a bathroom... of a bunker... one mile below sea level... with my old radioshaq tapedeck. Ok, maybe it ain't that bad, but it does have a very &quot;small&quot; sound. Aside from that, the picture transfer is quite good. As for the movie itself, my memory of it was kinder. The movie is in high-gear as long as Chevy is on screen, take him out and what you are left with are a lot of wisecracks that could have used laughtracks, then someone would at least be laughing.
