1409451,A2I9XSZSHXQ3OZ,B004HPOU0K,CreateEnergy,"[0, 0]",This is a single disc collection with five episodes from the 'Best Food Ever' series on TLC. The narrator for this show is John Goodman(he does not actually appear before the camera).My favorite episode in this collection is 'Fab Food Carts' as it was nice to see hard-working folks who are passionate about food go about making their entrepreneurial dreams into a reality. It was also amusing seeing a heavy-metal pig truck!Overall this collection is a bit short and could have used an additional disc for a few more episodes. But overall what is here is fun to watch and recommended for lovers of food programs.,4,Fun to watch but only five episodes,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,613,"['single', 'disc', 'collection', 'five', 'episodes', ""'Best"", 'Food', 'Ever', 'series', 'TLC', 'narrator', 'show', 'John', 'Goodman', 'not', 'actually', 'appear', 'camera', 'favorite', 'episode', 'collection', ""'Fab"", 'Food', 'Carts', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'hard-working', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'passionate', 'food', 'go', 'making', 'entrepreneurial', 'dreams', 'reality', 'was', 'also', 'amusing', 'seeing', 'heavy-metal', 'pig', 'truck', 'collection', 'bit', 'short', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'additional', 'disc', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'overall', 'what', 'here', 'fun', 'watch', 'recommended', 'lovers', 'food', 'programs']",N/A

We don't have any restaurants like this in my yuppie want a be town.  In face any decent restaurant that does locate here is quickly run into the ground.
