1544772,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0082GN8XK,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[4, 5]","On first blush, 388 ARLETTA AVENUE might seem like a clever idea: the motion picture is yet another of the `found footage' flicks, a story edited together from multiple independent cameras videotaping the life and times of a young couple trapped within a curious set of circumstances.  However, on closer inspection, I thought much of the decisions made by writer/director Randall Cole were slightly off-kilter to produce anything greater than a bloated vanity project, a curious failure worth watching for curiosity's sake but perhaps little else.[NOTE: for the record, ARLETTA is one of those films that has an ending that makes it difficult to discuss the plot/premise without some modest spoilers.  I've done the best I can with the material, but be warned: there will be minor spoilers contained below.]James Deakin (played by Nick Stahl) eeks out an existence as an advertising executive.  He's married to a lovely woman, Amy (Mia Kirshner), and, while they're not living the `dream life,' they certainly appear happy on the surface.  Hidden cameras begin to show the ""cracks in their relationship,"" and, before the viewing audience knows what's happened, Amy's gone, possibly abandoning her husband or perhaps abducted by the curious stranger videotaping their lives.  Left on his own, James struggles to uncover what happened to his young wife, all the while growing more desperate in a race against time to put things right.As a `found footage' film, Mr. Cole goes to great lengths to produce a coherent narrative, and, so far as the story presented here is concerned, he does a better-than-middling job.  The audience is never told ""why"" they're watching the young couple, though we're lead to believe (maybe by our own ability to `fill in the gaps' in the story) that James has a secret in his past - some dark transgression - and it's all coming back to haunt him now.  Certainly, that's what James concludes, and he begins to go out and re-establish dialogues with people he's wronged.  Little does he know, he's actually way off base in that assessment.And therein lies the curious weakness to ARLETTA: it all flows organically on its own by the direction of the faceless voyeur, a cinema creation of Mr. Cole.  It's the ultimate hat trick - the man behind the curtain - so there's no real legitimacy to the story.  It's the audience - not the characters - who end up being pawns to Cole's vision.  Indeed, in the brief interview segment on a special feature, Cole talks about the fact that he'd always wanted to do a film about stalking, as well as tinkering with `found footage,' and ... voila!  Now, he's fulfilled both projects in one fell swoop, showing the viewer a tale entirely of his design but maybe kinda/sorta not a legitimate story.In reality, characters are put up against circumstances in order to show how they'd react normally.  In 388 ARLETTA AVENUE, nothing unfolds naturally - every event is driven by the designs of a stalker - and, without spoiling the ""big reveal"" of the conclusion, let's just say that I found it mostly unsatisfying.  In my estimation, it all ends up being a trick of the storyteller - Mr. Cole - and not a development of characters trapped within a story.  Now, don't get me wrong: it's all exceedingly well-made, and, yes, I'd give it a respectable three stars because I think it works loosely as a character study for James Deakin (loosely, not definitively) ... but I can't dismiss the fact that everything which transpires does so entirely by creation of the writer/director, not the character as he's been presented here.  Had there been more time with Amy - the wife - then I might have more to go on in terms of evaluating the story, how James and Amy choose to live their relationship (here, it's reduced to a single narrative `beat,' that being their mutual frustration with one another), how James gets along at work, etc.  There are hints - subtle threads of the man's less-than-stellar work performance, the inkling of a former workplace romance, the hint of some spousal abuse - but it was all too small and too inconclusive for my tastes.If a voyeur chooses his subject randomly, then the portrait of that random choice says something about our society.  Am I to believe that every man has a past like James?  That's a deduction I just can't support, not given the scraps presented here.388 ARLETTA AVENUE is produced by Copperheart Entertainment.  DVD distribution is handled through New Video.  As to the production quality of the DVD?  Well ... to be honest, I had some problems with the video and audio, but I know it all relates to the nature of the beast here.  As a `found footage' picture, ARLETTA is entirely filmed and recorded with tiny hidden cameras, all equipped with small microphones.  One could make the argument that the audio should've been heavily remixed in post production in order to bring some clarity to ALL of the dialogue, not just the snippets that the Mr. Cole wanted or needed as the writer/director, and that's a big miscue.  Simply, there are way too many sections of dialogue that I had to turn the audio all the way up to get any possible idea of what was being said.  Stylistically, that was possibly Cole's intent; however, I thought it was a big mistake.  I shouldn't have to watch a film and repeatedly keep adjusting the volume in order to understand the happenings.  The disc boasts only a single special feature - a behind-the-scenes ""interview"" with the cast and crew - but be warned: it's only 3 minutes in length, and there's really nothing substantive learned from it.  Disappointing.RECOMMENDED, especially for fans of `found footage' pictures.  While it's little more than a variation on the `found footage' premise - a jazzy riff on a familiar tune - it's certainly well done enough to keep others interested, though I don't know that they'll hang with it OR be entirely excited by its conclusion.  On the plus side, most of these cameras are mounted to tripods, so you don't get the usual herky-jerky videotaping commonly associated to other flicks in this genre; on the down side, the story really asks the viewer to suspend disbelief quite a bit by failing the true identity of a compelling villain with a compelling mission, and, apparently, that was all by design.  Sorry, creative people, but I don't know anyone with this much time and this much money to invest this much of his life into simply eeking out his days as a routine stalker ... except, maybe, Bruce Wayne.  Last I knew, his days and nights were already tied up with some other personal mission.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD

1544774,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0082GN8XK,J from NY,"[1, 1]","You really have to give it to Nick Stahl: he plays a perfect jerk. Just his demeanor, everything. Not saying that's what he's actually like, but he does a good turn as a nasty SOB in every movie he stars in. That's probably why they cast him as the lead in the movieBully.Though he's the victim in this film, it's really no different. His wife Amy, played by Mia Kirshner, practically opens the film by calling him a ""nasty little s***"" when he ribs her about being a slacker on her anthropological/college thesis. This is shortly before she disappears, and that's really the rub of the film. She vanishes shortly after Stahl's character (James) finds that his life is being slightly altered in ways he cannot explain. Mixed cd's of his are skipping and playing songs that were not there to begin with. His pillows are being rearranged just slightly, in ways he did not arrange them. His cat even starts to look different.To the outside world, James looks like a shady character indeed. His wife disappears after an argument that her sister knew about and James was never that nice a guy. The problem is (and this is the only thing I find unbelievable about the movie) that a guy with a camera--and this is the lens through which we see all this--is doing it himself. The innovation here is that we really have no clue who the sadist is, why he takes such pleasure in messing with this guy's life to the maximum degree, and yet we see everything through his lens.Stahl does a good job of playing a guy under an enormous amount of stress. He loses weight, grows pale and thin, and becomes so suspicious that he even tracks down the guy he picked on in high school in a crazed effort at reconciliation--only, of course, because he's a suspect in James' mind.Really, the tagline could have been: ""When the victimizer becomes the victim."" James is a guy who has probably made a lot of enemies, being snarky and prickly. But is that what this is about? Is it just random? At any rate, I disagree with the reviewer's here who found the movie mediocre. The use of music and the (almost) perfect ending are really, really unnerving. A bit of Hitchcock brought to the digital age, even.

1544775,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B0082GN8XK,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[1, 2]","388 Arletta Avenue tells the story of a young couple, James and Amy, as they are stalked by an unknown person; this mysterious person has entered their home and car to set-up hidden cameras to monitor their actions without reason. When Amy disappears to ""clear her mind"", James becomes paranoid as he is tormented by the stalker. This is another film that uses the found-footage style.The story and the concept are creepy. Unknowingly being watched and recorded is a creepy concept; there's a chilling scene where the stalker records James as he sleeps, which can send many ideas through your mind. (Have I ever been recorded as I slept?) Unfortunately, this film doesn't have many of these chilling scenes. It actually has a very slow pace, especially in the first half; there isn't enough dialogue or genuine suspense to really immerse you into the film. It's not really thrilling, or scary. The acting was great, it basically got the job done. It somewhat uniquely uses the found-footage style, which is another plus. Although a bit predictable, the ending was great.Overall, the movie is decent and has a creepy concept; it doesn't really engage or immerse the audience and probably would've been more effective as a short film, though. As of 11/3/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, I recommend streaming or renting before purchasing.388 Arletta Avenue has blood and violence, has no sex or nudity",3,"Creepy Found-Footage Thriller, Despite Its Slow Pace...",1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,1424,"['388', 'Arletta', 'Avenue', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'James', 'Amy', 'are', 'stalked', 'unknown', 'person', 'mysterious', 'person', 'entered', 'home', 'car', 'set-up', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'monitor', 'actions', 'reason', 'When', 'Amy', 'clear', 'mind', 'James', 'paranoid', 'tormented', 'stalker', 'film', 'found-footage', 'style.The', 'story', 'concept', 'are', 'creepy', 'Unknowingly', 'being', 'watched', 'recorded', 'creepy', 'concept', 'chilling', 'scene', 'where', 'stalker', 'records', 'James', 'can', 'send', 'many', 'ideas', 'mind', 'Have', 'ever', 'been', 'recorded', 'slept', 'Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'actually', 'very', 'slow', 'pace', 'especially', 'first', 'half', ""n't"", 'enough', 'dialogue', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'really', 'immerse', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'thrilling', 'scary', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'basically', 'got', 'job', 'done', 'somewhat', 'uniquely', 'found-footage', 'style', 'plus', 'bit', 'predictable', 'ending', 'was', 'great.Overall', 'movie', 'decent', 'creepy', 'concept', ""n't"", 'really', 'engage', 'immerse', 'audience', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'short', 'film', 'though', '11/3/12', 'film', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Instant', 'Video', 'recommend', 'streaming', 'renting', 'purchasing.388', 'Arletta', 'Avenue', 'blood', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity']",N/A

1544777,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0082GN8XK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 3]","Randall Cole's ""388 Arletta Avenue"" is an interesting idea of a movie, but that's about all it is. Beyond the initial premise, the screenplay doesn't even attempt to provide much story and/or characterization for its audience to grasp onto. It is an unconventional choice, but one that left me completely disconnected to any potential tension or thrills in this half-baked and vague idea of a plot. Styled similarly to the ""found footage"" genre of filmmaking, every scene in ""388 Arletta Avenue"" is grainy, unfocused, and captured from a distance. As a young couple (played by Nick Stahl and Mia Kirshner) is watched by a mysterious stranger, their lives are being taped and this scrutiny starts to unnerve our pair (and rightly so). Just who is this intruder into their lives and what is his goal? And does it matter? Ultimately, Cole seems to think that motive or ANY type of back story is completely unnecessary--so you'll just have to go with the flow as the unseen villain gets closer and closer to the couple.While the idea of unwanted attention can be unsettling, I never thought this movie went anywhere original or intriguing. When Kirshner disappears, Stahl is left to wonder if something nefarious has happened or if it is just the product of their increasing discord. The paranoia that might have fueled the story doesn't have much impact, though, because the obvious stalking makes one conclusion the most likely. As the unpleasant games intensify, Stahl is pushed precipitously close to a breaking point. Although seen only from a distance, I did appreciate the intensity of Stahl's performance. The movie might have been truly electrifying had we known or cared anything about the protagonists (or the villain for that matter). Again, though, we don't. So as the movie heads for its ""dramatic"" conclusion,"" I really didn't have much interest. The disconnected feel of the experience made everything seem drawn out and tedious for me.I also had a intellectual problem with the visual style of the movie, if that even matters. To create this voyeuristic vibe, it seems that every scene is filmed through hidden cameras as well as the stalker's handheld camera. Are we supposed to believe that Stahl's house, car, and office are wired with equipment? Or is that just a movie-making style we should accept? I felt like Cole was implying that every moment was being watched by the unseen menace. But it seemed a bit odd that Stahl's car, for example, had three different camera angles shooting the interior. You can't create this type of visual style if it doesn't make sense in the logical realm. Maybe it's a small point. But as I was never really involved with this thriller, it made these questions more glaring. 1 1/2 stars, I'll round up for Stahl. I've always liked him and hope he gets his life and career back on track.

But James notices something is wrong when he finds a strange CD in his car. James insists that this is not his, but Amy just doesn't care. Things get more serious when Amy disappears, having left a note.In ""388 Arletta Avenue,"" the entire story is told in a ""found footage"" style. Well, to be precise, writer / director Randall Cole gives a twist to the overcrowded genre by emphasizing that the footage is all shot by someone with a malicious intent. Thus the film focuses more on how James is driven to the point of doing something extreme, than on who filmed the footage, or how.Usually thrillers require the viewers to suspend their disbelief, and ""388"" is no exception. (The Canadian film is executive-produced by Vincenzo Natali of ""Cube"" fame) But probably ""388"" requires too much from us, with a storyline that is, if told in a conventional way, full of incredible events. Whoever shot the footage must have vast financial resources, physical strength and technical knowledge, as well as great amount of time to spend before the screen.But what is the most disappointing is that the film is not as suspenseful as it should be. Nick Stahl delivers a strong performance as a man driven to near insanity, but his quest (or obsession) for truth does not intrigue us very much because after all we know where the film is going. The film's too neat conclusion would have been more impactful with more fleshed-out characters, but despite James' dark memories that are suggested, the film's narrative method make the characters look more like cyphers.Perhaps we should remember why certain film sub-genres including so-called found footage films remain what they are: minor genres.
