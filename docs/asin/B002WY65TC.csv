The episodes ""First Steps"", ""Growing Pains"", and ""Identity Crisis,"" all named after ideas in Human Development, revovle around Eddie Brock discovering where the symbiote's been hidden, and, once reclaiming it, uses it to terrorize Spidey in true Venom fashion.As with previous Spec Spidey story arcs, the main villain doesn't really throw down with Spidey till the last episode, so the opportunity arises for Sandman to appear outside of the Sinister Six.  The goal is by episode's end for Spidey to see Flint Marko in a more heroic light, just as in Spider-Man 3.  It works better here, without the sobfest Sam Raimi aimed for in his epic film.In ""Growing Pains"", J Jonah Jameson's astronaut son finally becomes a super power as he did in the comics.  However in this case it's more digestable.  As per usual with Peter Parker's life, a series of misunderstandings puts the two heroes at odds by episode's end.Lastly, symbiote fans finally get to see Venom at his best - attacking Spider-Man's life and making Peter miserable and frustrated. With his identity possibly outed to the public, Peter has to dodge accusations as well as Venom's fists, which leads to the first battle to take place at Peter's school.When watched back to back with Volume 4, this makes for a cool little Venom movie, with the voice actors and the dialouge hitting the important beats and vibes the 80s and 90s comics did, illustrating how two young men both combat their inner demons and how revenge can drive you mad.",4,Three episodes of animation that surpass Spider-Man 3 in half the time!,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,1650,"['Losing', 'fifth', 'star', 'due', 'release', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'opposed', 'entire', 'second', 'season', 'DVD', 'return', 'Venom', 'story', 'arc', 'episodes', 'First', 'Steps', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Identity', 'Crisis', 'named', 'ideas', 'Human', 'Development', 'revovle', 'Eddie', 'Brock', 'discovering', 'where', 'symbiote', 'been', 'hidden', 'once', 'reclaiming', 'terrorize', 'Spidey', 'true', 'Venom', 'fashion.As', 'previous', 'Spec', 'Spidey', 'story', 'arcs', 'main', 'villain', ""n't"", 'really', 'throw', 'down', 'Spidey', 'till', 'last', 'episode', 'opportunity', 'Sandman', 'appear', 'Sinister', 'Six', 'goal', 'episode', 'end', 'Spidey', 'see', 'Flint', 'Marko', 'more', 'heroic', 'light', 'just', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'better', 'here', 'sobfest', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'aimed', 'epic', 'film.In', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'J', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'astronaut', 'son', 'finally', 'super', 'power', 'did', 'comics', 'However', 'case', 'more', 'digestable', 'usual', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'life', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'two', 'heroes', 'odds', 'episode', 'end.Lastly', 'symbiote', 'fans', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'Venom', 'best', 'attacking', 'Spider-Man', 'life', 'making', 'Peter', 'miserable', 'frustrated', 'identity', 'possibly', 'outed', 'public', 'Peter', 'dodge', 'accusations', 'as', 'well', 'Venom', 'fists', 'first', 'battle', 'take', 'place', 'Peter', 'school.When', 'watched', 'back', 'back', 'Volume', '4', 'cool', 'little', 'Venom', 'movie', 'voice', 'actors', 'dialouge', 'hitting', 'important', 'beats', '80s', '90s', 'comics', 'did', 'illustrating', 'how', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'combat', 'inner', 'demons', 'how', 'revenge', 'can', 'drive', 'mad']",N/A

Suffice it to say that it is a great rendition of Spiderman and well worth it for any fan to pick up.  What I want to pass along is that at least now (with the most recent lower prices on each disc) it is worthwhile to actually buy these as separate volumes.  If you want Season 2 (the last season) of Spectacular Spiderman you need to pick it up as four separate discs (Vol 5, 6, 7, and 8).  Each disc is now priced at approximately $7 so a full season still costs more than it should have, but if you are a fan of the show I think you will think it is worth it. I did and I am looking forward to finally enjoying season 2 of ""your frindly neighborhood Spiderman""!",5,Must Buy Season 2 of Spectacular Spiderman One Volume at a Time,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,718,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'review', 'content', 'series', 'Suffice', 'say', 'great', 'rendition', 'Spiderman', 'well', 'fan', 'pick', 'up', 'What', 'want', 'pass', 'along', 'least', 'now', 'most', 'recent', 'lower', 'prices', 'disc', 'worthwhile', 'actually', 'buy', 'separate', 'volumes', 'want', 'Season', '2', 'last', 'season', 'Spectacular', 'Spiderman', 'need', 'pick', 'up', 'four', 'separate', 'discs', 'Vol', '5', '6', '7', '8', 'disc', 'now', 'priced', 'approximately', '7', 'full', 'season', 'still', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'think', 'will', 'think', 'did', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'finally', 'enjoying', 'season', '2', 'frindly', 'neighborhood', 'Spiderman']",N/A

This like the series itself is a victim of the ambiguous licensing war between Sony & Marvel/Disney. That being said, IMO, this series was the single greatest (and truest) superhero animation adaptation ever made. Hats off to Victor Cook, Greg Weisman, and Sean Galloway.
