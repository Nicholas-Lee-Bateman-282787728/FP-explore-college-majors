722712,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B00006RJCS,Andre Dursin,"[32, 33]","A trio of films from Bing Crosby Productions, the WALKING TALL series were mostly-fictionalized accounts of the life and alternately tragic and triumphant times of Tennessee small-town police chief Bufford Pusser in the `60s and early `70s. All three films - newly available on both Blu-Ray and DVD from Shout! Factory -make for ideal drive-in fare, mixing fisticuffs, some social justice sermonizing and vigilantism that would likewise become a potent formula for the ""Death Wish"" series.The original ""Walking Tall"" is by far the best of the trio: a somewhat crudely made yet undeniably compelling B-movie with Joe Don Baker as Pusser, a former wrestler who returns to his small Tennessee town, only to find crime, corruption, moonshinin' and prostitution having overrun the local residents. Pusser nearly dies, twice, as he tries to clean up the town - first as a frustrated, concerned citizen, then as the newly elected sheriff - forever running into opposition from crooked judges, lying politicians and local white trash.Baker's performance anchors the original WALKING TALL which became a huge hit in 1973, leading to a series of wannabes and similar ""redneck justice"" pictures. It's not a great movie by any means, but it has a certain charm about it, with the movie having been made on a workmanlike level across the board. Walter Scharf's melodic, occasionally overwrought score includes a forgettable Johnny Mathis end credits tune, while the supporting cast features little Leif Garrett as Pusser's son and a pair of young actresses who met with premature ends: Elizabeth Hartman, who plays Pusser's wife, later committed suicide in the `80s (she also voiced Mrs. Brisby in ""The Secret of NIMH""), as did Brenda Benet, Bill Bixby's ex-wife, who killed herself in 1982 and makes an impression here as a hooker sympathetic to the sheriff's crusade.Baker didn't return for WALKING TALL: PART II, a barely serviceable 1975 sequel with Pusser still taking on the local mob in a movie that feels more like a TV film recycling as opposed to a legitimate big-screen continuation. Bo Svenson, at least, does a decent job as Pusser with a few faces having returned from the original; Walter Scharf repeated his scoring chores in a film that was released shortly after the real-life Pusser's mysterious death.1977's FINAL CHAPTER: WALKING TALL is an appreciable step-up from its predecessor, offering an interesting account of Pusser's continued attempts to dismantle local organized crime, to his work with a film crew documenting his life and sad demise. The Howard B. Kreitsek-Samuel A. Peeples script aims higher than the second film, picking up some loose plot threads from the original that the first sequel overlooked, with Pusser's character being more developed as the lawman loses almost everything - though ultimately not his legacy.Shout's Blu-Ray set is a gem: the first film's 1080p transfer (all films are 1.85) has been culled from a pre-existing HD master and looks pretty good, with just a hint of DNR, and a 2.0 DTS MA stereo remix. Judging from the credited telecine colorist who worked on Parts II and III, the sequels appear to have been freshly transferred for this release, boasting decent detail, less DNR and 2.0 DTS MA mono soundtracks, though the modest budgets and no-frills filming of each installment certainly don't make for HD ""eye candy"" or demo material.Extras are also on-hand, including a documentary offering new interviews with Baker (albeit off-camera), Garrett, his sister Dawn Lyn (who plays his sister in the film), and numerous members of Pusser's own family, who discuss the real man whose story inspired the movies (and the later, lame remake with The Rock). TV spots for all films, trailers for the sequels, and a vintage look at the production of ""Final Chapter: Walking Tall"" make for an excellent package, which is also available on DVD with the same extras this May from Shout!",4,Shout!

722716,AT57B36BHDQ00,B00006RJCS,Big Mike,"[11, 13]","I agree that the picture and sound quality should have been better. I feel better about the quality of my DVD player knowing that someone else found certain scenes in &quot;Final Chapter-Walking Tall&quot; to be too dark. Also disappointing are the lack of trailers and documentaries, the latter, especially disappointing since these films were loosely based on facts. The packaging is flimsy, hardly protective from dust for the discs, merely adequate. Even so, the set is still a bargain for the money. As one who had the privilege of meeting the real Buford Pusser's mother and daughter and being told the facts, I really don't like Paul Gaita's so-called review and his calling the real Buford Pusser cruel and far from scrupulous. He should at least take the time to get his facts straight before making such statements. He might also be interested to know that the real Buford Pusser did not die in an explosion, but from being thrown from a fast-moving car. His mother went to her grave believing the crash of his Corvette on August 21, 1974 was caused by his being poisoned. Officially, his death was ruled as an accident, caused by drinking and speeding. Curiously though, his mother said that she was prevented from having his body exhumed, which she said would have proven that he was poisoned. Especially strange that there was no autopsy done either, which would have been proof of his drinking or not. She also said she was prevented from having his death investigated any further. I agree that the first film is the best and most factual, but Mr. Gaita needs to get his facts straight before defaming an actual person's character and reputation.",3,No frills but a bargain for the money,1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,1660,"['agree', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'feel', 'better', 'quality', 'DVD', 'player', 'knowing', 'someone', 'else', 'found', 'certain', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Final', 'Chapter-Walking', 'Tall', 'quot', 'be', 'too', 'dark', 'Also', 'disappointing', 'are', 'lack', 'trailers', 'documentaries', 'latter', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'films', 'were', 'loosely', 'based', 'facts', 'packaging', 'flimsy', 'hardly', 'protective', 'dust', 'discs', 'merely', 'adequate', 'Even', 'so', 'set', 'still', 'bargain', 'money', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'privilege', 'meeting', 'real', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'mother', 'daughter', 'being', 'told', 'facts', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Paul', 'Gaita', 'so-called', 'review', 'calling', 'real', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'cruel', 'far', 'scrupulous', 'should', 'least', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'making', 'such', 'statements', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'real', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'explosion', 'being', 'thrown', 'fast-moving', 'car', 'mother', 'went', 'grave', 'believing', 'crash', 'Corvette', 'August', '21', '1974', 'was', 'caused', 'being', 'poisoned', 'Officially', 'death', 'was', 'ruled', 'accident', 'caused', 'drinking', 'speeding', 'Curiously', 'mother', 'said', 'was', 'prevented', 'having', 'body', 'exhumed', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'proven', 'was', 'poisoned', 'Especially', 'strange', 'was', 'autopsy', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proof', 'drinking', 'not', 'also', 'said', 'was', 'prevented', 'having', 'death', 'investigated', 'further', 'agree', 'first', 'film', 'best', 'most', 'factual', 'Mr.', 'Gaita', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'defaming', 'actual', 'person', 'character', 'reputation']",N/A

As others have stated, they all include a lot of violence...much of it accurate to Pusser's real life. They are at times disturbing and there were times when I gasped viewing them for the first time. Pusser was a one of a kind character in real life, and the filmmakers did a good job of bringing that uniqueness to screen. I like both Baker and Svenson as Pusser.

722737,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00006RJCS,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[9, 10]","This set gives what it promises. It provides videos of the 3 movies from the 70s about Sheriff Buford Pusser. It does little else. There are no special features to speak of; its just the movies.If you like the movies and don't care for the frill, you will like this set. If you want more, you will be disappointed.Synopses of the individual films appear below:Walking TallThe Original is still a ClassicJoe Don Baker plays the part of Buford Pusser, a.k.a. Buford the Bull, a pro wrestler who is disenchanted with the crooked sport and who decides to settle down in his home town in rural Tennessee. Home is not the way he remembers it, though. There is a hint of corruption in the air.This does not matter overly much to Buford until it affects him personally. When the local thugs, working for the local moonshiners and madam, work him over and leave him for dead, he decides that he has had enough. He doesn't get a gun, his wife does not like guns. Instead, when he recovers, he gets a big piece of oak, heads over to the roadhouse where all the problems are and proceeds to kick everyone's collective butt. That lands him in jail.When the trial comes about, it's a pretty open and shut case. Even Buford admits that he did the violence. It looks like he is going to be convicted until he fires his lawyer, makes an impassioned plea on his own behalf, shows the jury his scars and promises that if he is acquitted, he will run for sheriff and clean up the town. He gets off and then proceeds to clean things up.The problem is that the crooks don't want to be cleaned up. They fight him and even threaten his family. That makes it personal for Buford. He cleans them up anyway but has to endure a fair amount of grief in the process. Throughout it all, he relies only on speaking softly and carrying a BIG stick.This is not highbrow. Its just a simple good versus evil story. Buford is the good guy and he is likable.Walking Tall Part 2Vengeance in Mine Sayeth BufordNear the end of the Original WALKING TALL, Sheriff Pusser's wife is killed while the mob is attempting to kill him. Now it is time for payback. There are a few changes, though.Bo Svenson replaces Joe Don Baker as the likable sheriff. He does a creditable job but, under the circumstances, he is less concerned with the niceties of exactly following the law.He's still effective, though. He is so effective that the mob is desperate to get him and hires a variety of hit men to do the job. One of the mob leaders, in particular, is just as obsessed with getting the sheriff as the sheriff is with getting them. That leads to an intense conflict and no concern for niceties. That means violence and mayhem.Even with his proclivity for violence, the sheriff is concerned for his people. He is still a ""nice"" guy unless you are one of the people who is responsible for the problems. He still manages to get most of the small fry but the big fish still elude him.This is not a bad movie as sequels go but it is not as good as the original. Anger can only take you so far in progressing the plot. It cannot make up for a lesser script and lesser story.Walking Tall: The Final ChapterEnd of the RoadThe second Walking Tall ends with a notice that Sheriff Buford was killed in an auto accident. This third one picks up earlier in the story though. He is still adamant about getting the people who killed his wife and the Mob is still bent on getting the sheriff but Buford has a problem. He has lost his job as sheriff.The job loss comes about for several reasons. In some cases, Buford is scene as having gone too far outside the legal boundaries. This happens even when his solutions make life easier for everyone, including the perpetrators. The people of his county also seem a bit jaded by continued success. Where they once cheered him, now they are not ready to support him.The loss of his job means that Buford has to go after justice as a private citizen and he is well on his way to the poorhouse in pursuing his aims. The new sheriff is suspicious of him and is fearful that Buford might become a problem for him. It begins to look like he might have to move away with his business unfinished when he gets a lucky break.A Hollywood producer learns of his story and wants to make a movie about him. That brings in money and a chance for achieving his goals. The mob leader with a taste for vengeance finally gets his chance and we learn the story of the end of the former Sheriff of McNairy County.This one is better than the second but not as good as the first.",4,"Good for the Movies, Not the Frills",1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,4534,"['set', 'what', 'videos', '3', 'movies', '70s', 'Sheriff', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'little', 'else', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'just', 'movies.If', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'frill', 'will', 'like', 'set', 'want', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.Synopses', 'individual', 'films', 'appear', 'Walking', 'TallThe', 'Original', 'still', 'ClassicJoe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'part', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'a.k.a', 'Buford', 'Bull', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'who', 'disenchanted', 'crooked', 'sport', 'who', 'settle', 'down', 'home', 'town', 'rural', 'Tennessee', 'Home', 'not', 'way', 'though', 'hint', 'corruption', 'air.This', 'not', 'matter', 'overly', 'much', 'Buford', 'personally', 'When', 'local', 'thugs', 'working', 'local', 'moonshiners', 'madam', 'work', 'leave', 'dead', 'had', 'enough', ""n't"", 'get', 'gun', 'wife', 'not', 'like', 'guns', 'Instead', 'when', 'big', 'piece', 'oak', 'roadhouse', 'where', 'problems', 'are', 'proceeds', 'kick', 'everyone', 'collective', 'butt', 'jail.When', 'trial', 'about', 'pretty', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'Even', 'Buford', 'did', 'violence', 'going', 'be', 'convicted', 'lawyer', 'impassioned', 'plea', 'own', 'behalf', 'jury', 'scars', 'promises', 'acquitted', 'will', 'run', 'sheriff', 'clean', 'up', 'town', 'off', 'then', 'proceeds', 'clean', 'things', 'up.The', 'problem', 'crooks', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'cleaned', 'up', 'fight', 'even', 'threaten', 'family', 'personal', 'Buford', 'up', 'anyway', 'endure', 'fair', 'amount', 'grief', 'process', 'only', 'speaking', 'softly', 'carrying', 'BIG', 'stick.This', 'not', 'highbrow', 'just', 'simple', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'story', 'Buford', 'good', 'guy', 'likable.Walking', 'Tall', 'Part', '2Vengeance', 'Mine', 'Sayeth', 'BufordNear', 'end', 'Original', 'WALKING', 'TALL', 'Sheriff', 'Pusser', 'wife', 'killed', 'mob', 'attempting', 'kill', 'Now', 'time', 'payback', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'Svenson', 'replaces', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'likable', 'sheriff', 'creditable', 'job', 'circumstances', 'less', 'concerned', 'niceties', 'exactly', 'following', 'law.He', 'still', 'effective', 'though', 'so', 'effective', 'mob', 'desperate', 'get', 'variety', 'hit', 'men', 'do', 'job', 'One', 'mob', 'leaders', 'particular', 'just', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'sheriff', 'sheriff', 'getting', 'intense', 'conflict', 'concern', 'niceties', 'violence', 'mayhem.Even', 'proclivity', 'violence', 'sheriff', 'concerned', 'people', 'still', 'nice', 'guy', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'responsible', 'problems', 'still', 'get', 'most', 'small', 'fry', 'big', 'fish', 'still', 'elude', 'him.This', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'sequels', 'go', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Anger', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'so', 'far', 'progressing', 'plot', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'lesser', 'script', 'lesser', 'story.Walking', 'Tall', 'Final', 'ChapterEnd', 'RoadThe', 'second', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'notice', 'Sheriff', 'Buford', 'was', 'killed', 'auto', 'accident', 'third', 'one', 'up', 'earlier', 'story', 'still', 'adamant', 'getting', 'people', 'who', 'killed', 'wife', 'Mob', 'still', 'bent', 'getting', 'sheriff', 'Buford', 'problem', 'lost', 'job', 'sheriff.The', 'job', 'loss', 'several', 'reasons', 'cases', 'Buford', 'scene', 'having', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'legal', 'boundaries', 'even', 'when', 'solutions', 'make', 'life', 'easier', 'everyone', 'including', 'perpetrators', 'people', 'county', 'also', 'seem', 'bit', 'jaded', 'continued', 'success', 'Where', 'once', 'cheered', 'now', 'are', 'not', 'ready', 'support', 'him.The', 'loss', 'job', 'Buford', 'go', 'justice', 'private', 'citizen', 'well', 'way', 'poorhouse', 'pursuing', 'aims', 'new', 'sheriff', 'suspicious', 'fearful', 'Buford', 'might', 'become', 'problem', 'look', 'might', 'have', 'move', 'away', 'business', 'unfinished', 'when', 'lucky', 'break.A', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'learns', 'story', 'make', 'movie', 'money', 'chance', 'achieving', 'goals', 'mob', 'leader', 'taste', 'vengeance', 'finally', 'chance', 'learn', 'story', 'end', 'former', 'Sheriff', 'McNairy', 'County.This', 'one', 'better', 'second', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first']",N/A

722756,A2YZKTQG1L5YXJ,B00006RJCS,"Seahorse ""seahorse""","[0, 0]","This is the film that unleashed Joe Don Baker onto an unsuspecting public and the end result is a compelling fact based story that gets your blood pumping all the way up until the end credits. After re-locating back to his home town in Tennesee, ex wrestler Pusser survives a brutal attack from the state line mob and while healing up, decides to run for town sherrif. After winning, Pusser is obsessively driven to end all corruption in his town but comes at a higher price than he expected. The iconic club hits plenty of home runs off redneck heads as Pusser sends more and more gomers to the hospital. Veteran western character actors give phenomenal support as we get an uncompromising look at some of the slimiest backstabbers ever seen in movies. The director doesn't leave much to the imagination as the violence is unflinchingly shown and this is one of the few films that you feel ""dirty"" after viewing. Bruce Glover and Felton Perry are the uncorruptable deputies that back Buford all the way. 70's audiences stood up and cheered as Joe Don Baker sold Buford Pusser as an invincible hero to the world and how much hollywood changed the original story can be seen in the book which is ripe for another movie. The true story is so different from any of the films and there is more to tell about the results of Pusser eventually cornering the very people who killed his wife. The film is non PC so turn it up for reality's sake. The dvd from shout is 16x9 w/5.1 surround sound that complements all the action. Some audio comments from Baker keeps everyone in the dark about what it was like on the set with Pusser and everyone else has nothing much to say about the movie vs. what really happened.  Absolutely avoid the new Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson's version an inferior rehash with none of the talent that made the original a classic.  After the first ""walking tall"" the makers of part 2 were obviously looking to make a much more tame film and not exploit Pusser's recent death. The movie Bo Svenson walked into  was not the opportunity that Joe Don Baker had. We hope to see the bigger more imposing Svenson on a rampage to club, beat and shoot those responsible for his wife's death, but we don't because they are out of his reach. He hardly even gets to yell at anyone in this. Bo Svenson's best role as Buford Pusser is not W.T. part 2 or 3, it is the walking tall t.v. series with more action and drama providing Bo a chance to show he could do the part as good as Joe Don Baker. Pusser gets out of the hospital and faces all kinds of attempts on his life while trying to catch moonshiners. I still like this film because it is based on fact, and somehow it is very believable. Luke Askew and Richard Jaekel do a great job as bad guys. 16x9 DVD looks great but no interview with Bo Svenson or any discussion about how fictional part 2 and 3 were. A screen test  was supposedly made with Pusser originally cast in part 2 but nothing here on that. All comments from Pusser's family and friends are interesting but not too informative especially for anyone who read the book.  Final chapter has more action in it and is great up until Buford is voted out. Unfortunately the rest crawls along like a snail. Besides the boredom, Pusser seems a bit confused and is frustrating to watch as his life falls apart around him. Svenson is wasted in this and the obvious potential for a better movie can be found in the book, but they dropped the ball in a major way. Luckily, the T.V. series makes up for this downbeat error. 16x9 dvd is great. The audio is messed up during the bar fight scene, but the rest is just fine. Some decent trailers and a retro making of, are real gems and in good quality.

I even got to meet Buford Pusser when he made a promotional appearance at a local theater.  I remember he watched the film(standing)from the rear of the theater. When the scene that depicts his wife's death came up, he walked out into the lobby.He gave me an autograph and posed for a photo.I was very pleased when I discovered this set was coming out. I hadn't seen the 3 films in decades and it really brought back happy memories to see them again.The video & audio are excellent(especially the first film) and the extras are very nice.I only wish the set had included closed-captioning. It was also have been neat if they'd thrown in the TV movie with Brian Dennehy. I don't think it's available on DVD.All in all, a great set at a great Amazon price.",5,WALKING TALL TRILOGY(DVD FORMAT),1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,820,"['saw', 'Walking', 'least', 'twice', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1973', 'even', 'got', 'meet', 'Buford', 'Pusser', 'when', 'made', 'promotional', 'appearance', 'local', 'theater', 'remember', 'watched', 'film', 'standing', 'rear', 'theater', 'When', 'scene', 'wife', 'death', 'came', 'up', 'walked', 'out', 'lobby.He', 'gave', 'autograph', 'posed', 'photo.I', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'when', 'discovered', 'set', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', '3', 'films', 'decades', 'really', 'brought', 'back', 'happy', 'memories', 'see', 'again.The', 'video', 'audio', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'first', 'film', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'nice.I', 'only', 'wish', 'set', 'had', 'included', 'closed-captioning', 'was', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'neat', ""'d"", 'thrown', 'TV', 'movie', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'available', 'DVD.All', 'great', 'set', 'great', 'Amazon', 'price']",N/A
