375055,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,6303450229,christinemm  from The Thinking Mother blog,"[9, 10]","I have learned through experience that whenever buying a ""Wee Sing"" series videotape, you will get quality, wholesome songs, and pure innocence. As with the entire series, these shows lack any hint of sarcasm or rudeness on the characters behalf. There is nothing controversial here: nothing scary, no slang, no profanity, no mean-ness, no worry that some problematic topic will crop up. The children all get along with each other (as in the TV show ""Barney"") and they like each other and treat each other with respect.  The only bad thing about the entire series is that the songs tend to stick in my (adult) head and hearing some of these videos can get annoying and do suffer from a little goofiness!Wee Sing Train is a cute story that begins with a brother and sister setting up a train layout with toy trains. They then take other toys and set up little areas (vignettes) around the track. They then suddenly shrink down (could be their imagination) and sit on the talking train and travel around the track. They stop at each ""area"" and have an experience with their toys. There are singing cowboys ""home on the range"" and it goes on and on. The songs are traditional popular American children's music, with some new Wee-Sing songs. There is even a special song that must be sung to get the train moving along the track: it is a train powered by song.This is a very cute video that both my boys love. It has been playing in our home for over 3 years now and both children never tire of it! This is high-quality age-appropriate children's entertainment. My children began watching it when they were one year old and enjoyed it then. Both children sing these songs throughout the day, even months after seeing the video for the last time. (Hey, I need a break from it sometimes!)There is also a board book for this Wee Sing Train, which tells a shortened version of ""The Little Engine That Could"" that comes with an audiotape. That audiotape has more songs on it and tells the story with song of ""The Little Engine That Could"". That audiotape has gotten us through some long car rides. The book is nothing remarkable.  If you child loves the Wee Sing Train be aware that Brio (used to) make a wooden train figure 8 set that has the colored Wee Sing Train track and the Wee Sing 3-car train and elephant character and if you search for a set, you may be able to find one.",5,"So much loved, the tape is in danger of being worn out....",1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2373,"['have', 'learned', 'experience', 'whenever', 'buying', 'Wee', 'Sing', 'series', 'videotape', 'will', 'get', 'quality', 'wholesome', 'songs', 'pure', 'innocence', 'entire', 'series', 'shows', 'lack', 'hint', 'sarcasm', 'rudeness', 'characters', 'behalf', 'nothing', 'controversial', 'here', 'nothing', 'scary', 'slang', 'profanity', 'mean-ness', 'worry', 'problematic', 'topic', 'will', 'crop', 'up', 'children', 'get', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'Barney', 'like', 'other', 'treat', 'other', 'respect', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'entire', 'series', 'songs', 'tend', 'stick', 'adult', 'head', 'hearing', 'videos', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'do', 'suffer', 'little', 'goofiness', 'Wee', 'Sing', 'Train', 'cute', 'story', 'brother', 'sister', 'setting', 'up', 'train', 'layout', 'toy', 'trains', 'then', 'take', 'other', 'toys', 'set', 'up', 'little', 'areas', 'vignettes', 'track', 'then', 'suddenly', 'shrink', 'down', 'could', 'be', 'imagination', 'sit', 'talking', 'train', 'travel', 'track', 'stop', 'area', 'have', 'experience', 'toys', 'are', 'singing', 'cowboys', 'home', 'range', 'songs', 'are', 'traditional', 'popular', 'American', 'children', 'music', 'new', 'Wee-Sing', 'songs', 'even', 'special', 'song', 'must', 'be', 'sung', 'get', 'train', 'moving', 'track', 'train', 'powered', 'song.This', 'very', 'cute', 'video', 'boys', 'love', 'been', 'playing', 'home', '3', 'years', 'now', 'children', 'never', 'tire', 'high-quality', 'age-appropriate', 'children', 'entertainment', 'children', 'began', 'watching', 'when', 'were', 'one', 'year', 'old', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'children', 'sing', 'songs', 'day', 'even', 'months', 'seeing', 'video', 'last', 'time', 'Hey', 'need', 'break', 'sometimes', 'also', 'board', 'book', 'Wee', 'Sing', 'Train', 'shortened', 'version', 'Little', 'Engine', 'Could', 'audiotape', 'audiotape', 'more', 'songs', 'story', 'song', 'Little', 'Engine', 'Could', 'audiotape', 'gotten', 'long', 'car', 'rides', 'book', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'child', 'Wee', 'Sing', 'Train', 'be', 'aware', 'Brio', 'used', 'make', 'wooden', 'train', 'figure', '8', 'set', 'colored', 'Wee', 'Sing', 'Train', 'track', 'Wee', 'Sing', '3-car', 'train', 'elephant', 'character', 'search', 'set', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'one']",Wee Sing Train VHS

It acts as a story following siblings playing with their train set and toys; to a sing-along of every genre of music with fun, get up and move, interactive songs; to lessons on safety too :-).  Even adults get a kick out of watching their kids have fun with this 'movie.'  I've even gotten up and ""put my little foot right there"" many a-times:)  This is truly one of the BEST Entertaining and Interactive Kid's videos my family has ever owned.  I bought a second one when the kids wore the first one out after 6 years on playing it.  Still have it in my shelf and my kids are now in college.  And if you'd ask them about it, they'd still tell you, it was one of their favorite videos and brings back good times and fun memories.

The characters are both children and animals, including a fluffy talking elephant. Another character is the train itself, which takes the passengers from scene to scene.

One day, I was in an educational supply store and a Wee Sing video was playing. She stood watching, mesmerized as the kids danced and sang onWee Sing Together. Of course, I purchased the VHS tape (at that time). It calmed her down; she never got tired of that video.  However, her brother is 9 years older than she is. He really got sick of that video.  He now has a young son. I talked my daughter-in-law into purchasing this video for my grandson. All of us were excited while we waited for the video to be delivered...well, except my son, who was not looking forward to listening & watching anything Wee Sing. My 15.5 mo. old grandson loves the video. He even attempts to sing some of the songs and will sway back and forth too.Wee Sing Train begins as a girl and a boy are setting up a room with a train set with all sorts of stops along the way...a barn, farm with garden, paper dolls, & cowboys out on the range to name a few. They have a stuffed horse and elephant too. Not too long into the video, the children become part of the action as their train play area comes to life.My grandson likes thisThe Wee Sing Train& gets some exercise too, as he sings and dances along.",5,Wee Sing Train..,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,1265,"['had', 'very', 'active', 'daughter', 'never', 'wanted', 'leave', 'side', 'fussed', 'quite', 'bit', 'One', 'day', 'was', 'educational', 'supply', 'store', 'Wee', 'Sing', 'video', 'was', 'playing', 'stood', 'watching', 'mesmerized', 'kids', 'danced', 'sang', 'onWee', 'Sing', 'Together', 'course', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'tape', 'time', 'calmed', 'down', 'never', 'got', 'tired', 'video', 'However', 'brother', '9', 'years', 'older', 'really', 'got', 'sick', 'video', 'now', 'young', 'son', 'talked', 'daughter-in-law', 'purchasing', 'video', 'grandson', 'were', 'excited', 'waited', 'video', 'be', 'delivered', 'well', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'listening', 'watching', 'anything', 'Wee', 'Sing', '15.5', 'mo', 'old', 'grandson', 'video', 'even', 'sing', 'songs', 'will', 'sway', 'back', 'forth', 'too.Wee', 'Sing', 'Train', 'girl', 'boy', 'are', 'setting', 'up', 'room', 'train', 'set', 'sorts', 'stops', 'way', 'barn', 'farm', 'garden', 'paper', 'dolls', 'out', 'range', 'name', 'few', 'have', 'stuffed', 'horse', 'elephant', 'too', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'video', 'children', 'become', 'part', 'action', 'train', 'play', 'area', 'life.My', 'grandson', 'likes', 'thisThe', 'Wee', 'Sing', 'Train', 'exercise', 'too', 'dances', 'along']",Wee Sing Train VHS
