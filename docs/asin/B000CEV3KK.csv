957621,A22GTVN7Q9IZVT,B000CEV3KK,Adam Smithee,"[0, 0]","This film tries hard to be funny, though the writer/director has NO comedic talent whatsoever. He also does not know cinematic storytelling - make a long story short, whomever wrote/directed this film has no ""business"" in the ""movie business.""1) The characters are annoying and have almost no chemistry between each other. Their union is completely forced. Within 15min of the movie one can clearly see that these 8 characters would have nothing to do with each other outside of this ""film."" Since when do Lesbians feel so comfortable with a bunch of gay men? And isn't the directory enforcing negative gay stereotypes with the overly flamboyant ""queen"" character?2) The writing is clearly amateurish. The writer also felt the need to use the word ""*igga"" over and over, yet tries to paint the Black/African-American characters who are supposedly ""forward thinking"" and ""mobile."" Most upwardly mobile/intelligent Black men would send you to the door for such self-hating language. --Keep it to the rappers.--  As stated, the comedy writing is high-school level, annoying, and completely unfunny. For example, in the opening of the movie, the main character talks about his penis felt the need to give the audience a description of it. It was disgusting, yet I'm sure that the writer(s) of this movie were giggling to themselves.3) The main character is really annoying and has no business as a lead character. He's completely unlikable, complains all the time, and tries to be funny, yet he's not. He's also not easy on the eyes. In fact, there's only two characters in the film that approach being attractive, and they're side characters.In conclusion, director Maurice Jamal clearly proved that he has no talent in writing, character development, or comedy. I always like to support African American artists WITH talent, but ney, Maurice is not one of them. He recently launched the GloTV network, which I lauded greatly and paid for a subscription to the channel. However, its offerings are just as mediocre as this film. I would suggest that Maurice perhaps switch gears to a production role and leave the talent to someone else.Where's Patrik-Ian Polk when you need him?",1,Mediocre and unfunny,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2175,"['film', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'writer/director', 'NO', 'comedic', 'talent', 'whatsoever', 'also', 'not', 'know', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'whomever', 'wrote/directed', 'film', 'business', 'movie', 'business', '1', 'characters', 'are', 'annoying', 'have', 'almost', 'chemistry', 'other', 'union', 'completely', 'forced', '15min', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', '8', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'outside', 'film', 'when', 'do', 'Lesbians', 'feel', 'so', 'comfortable', 'bunch', 'gay', 'men', ""n't"", 'directory', 'enforcing', 'negative', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'overly', 'flamboyant', 'queen', 'character', '2', 'writing', 'clearly', 'amateurish', 'writer', 'also', 'felt', 'need', 'use', 'word', '*igga', 'yet', 'paint', 'Black/African-American', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'supposedly', 'forward', 'thinking', 'mobile', 'Most', 'upwardly', 'mobile/intelligent', 'Black', 'men', 'would', 'send', 'door', 'such', 'self-hating', 'language', 'Keep', 'rappers.', 'stated', 'comedy', 'writing', 'high-school', 'level', 'annoying', 'completely', 'unfunny', 'example', 'opening', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'talks', 'penis', 'felt', 'need', 'give', 'audience', 'description', 'was', 'disgusting', 'yet', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writer', 's', 'movie', 'were', 'giggling', 'themselves.3', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'annoying', 'business', 'lead', 'character', 'completely', 'unlikable', 'time', 'tries', 'be', 'funny', 'yet', 'not', 'also', 'not', 'easy', 'eyes', 'fact', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'film', 'approach', 'being', 'attractive', ""'re"", 'side', 'characters.In', 'conclusion', 'director', 'Maurice', 'Jamal', 'clearly', 'proved', 'talent', 'writing', 'character', 'development', 'comedy', 'always', 'support', 'African', 'American', 'artists', 'WITH', 'talent', 'ney', 'Maurice', 'not', 'one', 'recently', 'launched', 'GloTV', 'network', 'lauded', 'greatly', 'paid', 'subscription', 'channel', 'However', 'offerings', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'mediocre', 'film', 'would', 'suggest', 'Maurice', 'perhaps', 'switch', 'gears', 'production', 'role', 'leave', 'talent', 'someone', 'Patrik-Ian', 'Polk', 'when', 'need']",The Ski Trip

""Boring, tedious and unfunny"" applies here in spades (no racially offensive pun intended, since most of the characters are black). There isn't even any nudity in this one to make it worthwhile.There was one line that made me giggle. Our hero, who is turning 30, is having a turning-30 crisis. (Remember when turning 30 was a crisis!?!) He tells his lesbian buddy, ""I found three gray hairs this morning."" She says, ""Corey, you're bald."" He says, ""Not there!""But tell me, why does every gay movie have to have at least one obnoxious, offensive, screaming queen? The beautiful Haaz Sleiman from THE VISITOR is here (which is, believe me, the only reason I bought this piece of crap), and he's gorgeous...not to mention not offensive or stereo-typical. The man has an amazing body, which doesn't show in THE VISITOR.I gave this review one star, but that's only because there's no way to give it half a star.",1,Forget it!,1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,952,"['doubt', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Boring', 'tedious', 'unfunny', 'applies', 'here', 'spades', 'racially', 'offensive', 'pun', 'intended', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'black', ""n't"", 'even', 'nudity', 'one', 'make', 'was', 'one', 'line', 'made', 'giggle', 'hero', 'who', 'turning', '30', 'having', 'turning-30', 'crisis', 'Remember', 'when', 'turning', '30', 'was', 'crisis', 'lesbian', 'buddy', 'found', 'three', 'gray', 'hairs', 'morning', 'Corey', ""'re"", 'bald', 'Not', 'there', 'tell', 'why', 'gay', 'movie', 'have', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'obnoxious', 'offensive', 'screaming', 'queen', 'beautiful', 'Haaz', 'Sleiman', 'THE', 'VISITOR', 'here', 'believe', 'only', 'reason', 'bought', 'piece', 'crap', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'mention', 'not', 'offensive', 'stereo-typical', 'man', 'amazing', 'body', ""n't"", 'show', 'THE', 'VISITOR.I', 'gave', 'review', 'one', 'star', 'only', 'way', 'give', 'star']",The Ski Trip
957623,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000CEV3KK,Jeffery Mingo,"[9, 10]","First off, the title is deceptive.  You will never see a set of skis in this film.  Renting a cabin in a snowy area doesn't make it a ski trip.  This indie (read: low-budget) film is filled with bad writing and actors with bad timing.  The characters are all stock: the queen, the hag, the gym bunny, the bland main character, etc.  The actors are constantly reading each other, but not well.  The queeniest character takes up too much space and also doesn't allow time to develop the other characters.  One character is so nasty that it doesn't make since that the others continue to associate with him.  The stereotypical accents may grate your nerves after awhile.  The makeup crew should have been fired because each and every character is caked in too much makeup.  Three characters have baldies and no beards and may touch on ideas that ""they all look alike.""  The male characters often say, ""We gay men"" this and that.  However, these are characters of color that should be fully conscious of racial issues and really should have said, ""We Black and Latino gay men"" this and that.  Because I have read that Che Guevara was a nasty homophobe, I hated seeing the gay Latino character, who is played by an openly gay Latino man, wearing a shirt with his image on it.  This film bites off of Go Fish, the Big Chill, Will & Grace, and many others.  I haven't seen ""Punks,"" but because that dealt with three gay Black friends and one gay Latino man, I imagine that this film may have imitated it too.But shade aside, I appreciated this film.  I encourage people to see it and tell others about it.  Many predominately white, gay films have disturbing images of people of color.  Pittsburgh is one-quarter Black, yet there are no characters of cool in ""Queer as Folk.""  In ""Jeffrey,"" almost all of the gay men of color are waiters and totally to the periphery of the narrative.  ""Priscilla: Queen of the Desert"" shows a profoundly racist, xenophobic, and sexist depiction of an Asian woman.  There is even a pathetic Black, gay film ""Brother to Brother"" that has no Black, gay couples in it.  Hey, if low-budget flicks about straights of color like ""Playin' for the Kitty"" and ""Drive By"" can be made, why can't gay men of color do the same?The main character is also the director and screenwriter.  I imagine that this was a labor of love for him.  I loved seeing young actors of color get film experience.  I love that Black-Latino unity here.  There is a shocking twist near the end that kept my interest.  This is definitely an ""A for effort"" production.",2,the REAL brother to brother,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,2557,"['First', 'off', 'title', 'deceptive', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'set', 'skis', 'film', 'Renting', 'cabin', 'snowy', 'area', ""n't"", 'make', 'ski', 'trip', 'indie', 'read', 'low-budget', 'film', 'filled', 'bad', 'writing', 'actors', 'bad', 'timing', 'characters', 'are', 'stock', 'queen', 'hag', 'gym', 'bunny', 'bland', 'main', 'character', 'etc', 'actors', 'are', 'constantly', 'reading', 'other', 'not', 'well', 'queeniest', 'character', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'space', 'also', ""n't"", 'allow', 'time', 'develop', 'other', 'characters', 'One', 'character', 'so', 'nasty', ""n't"", 'make', 'others', 'continue', 'associate', 'stereotypical', 'accents', 'may', 'grate', 'nerves', 'awhile', 'makeup', 'crew', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fired', 'character', 'caked', 'too', 'much', 'makeup', 'Three', 'characters', 'have', 'baldies', 'beards', 'may', 'touch', 'ideas', 'look', 'alike', 'male', 'characters', 'often', 'say', 'gay', 'men', 'However', 'are', 'characters', 'color', 'should', 'be', 'fully', 'conscious', 'racial', 'issues', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'Black', 'Latino', 'gay', 'men', 'have', 'read', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'was', 'nasty', 'homophobe', 'hated', 'seeing', 'gay', 'Latino', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'openly', 'gay', 'Latino', 'man', 'wearing', 'shirt', 'image', 'film', 'Go', 'Fish', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Will', 'Grace', 'many', 'others', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Punks', 'dealt', 'three', 'gay', 'Black', 'friends', 'one', 'gay', 'Latino', 'man', 'imagine', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'imitated', 'too.But', 'shade', 'aside', 'appreciated', 'film', 'encourage', 'people', 'see', 'tell', 'others', 'Many', 'predominately', 'white', 'gay', 'films', 'have', 'disturbing', 'images', 'people', 'color', 'Pittsburgh', 'one-quarter', 'Black', 'yet', 'are', 'characters', 'cool', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Jeffrey', 'almost', 'gay', 'men', 'color', 'are', 'waiters', 'totally', 'periphery', 'narrative', 'Priscilla', 'Queen', 'Desert', 'profoundly', 'racist', 'xenophobic', 'sexist', 'depiction', 'Asian', 'woman', 'even', 'pathetic', 'Black', 'gay', 'film', 'Brother', 'Brother', 'Black', 'gay', 'couples', 'Hey', 'low-budget', 'flicks', 'straights', 'color', 'Playin', 'Kitty', 'Drive', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'gay', 'men', 'color', 'do', 'same', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'imagine', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'loved', 'seeing', 'young', 'actors', 'color', 'get', 'film', 'experience', 'love', 'Black-Latino', 'unity', 'here', 'shocking', 'twist', 'end', 'kept', 'interest', 'definitely', 'A', 'effort', 'production']",The Ski Trip
