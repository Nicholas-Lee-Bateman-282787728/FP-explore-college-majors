275604,AZAR0EO6NGV7,6301964144,"Brent Carleton ""Brent Carleton""","[5, 6]","First off, let us concede that neither the 1935 Greta Garbo ""Anna Karenina"" nor the 1948 Vivian Leigh version comes close to capturing the complexities of Tolstoy's masterpiece. Most significantly, Konstantin Levin and Kitty's relationship, and more particularly, Levin's protracted personal and metaphysical development, are dropped entirely, both screenplays preferring to treat the story as an adulterous romantic triangle with snowflakes instead of palm trees.That said, what we are left with in both films are masterpieces of film craftsmanship, where the triple triumphs of cinematography, art direction, and costume design are the real stars.Which is not in any way to lessen the contributions of the cast, who in both instances, make the best of what they have to work with.Garbo enchants in many of her individual scenes, particularly with Freddy Bartholomew and Maureen O'Sullivan, (as Kitty). Who can forget her advising Kitty to seize her fleeting youth, with its promise of a dream prince to emerge from the blue haze of the mountain top. Equally impressive, is her muted aversion to Alexei Karenin, (Basil Rathbone).But she fails in her depiction of a fatal love for Count Vronsky (Frederic March). Garbo, with her solemn, majestic and singular self possession--her ""Queen Christina"" like cerebral detachment, is simply too thoughtful, too deliberate, to in any way convey Tolstoy's impulsive, febrile and thoughtless anti-heroine.True, she had forsaken all for John Gilbert in ""Christina,"" but that decision was the result of deep and thorough soul searching, and explained with the eloquence of Solomon to her courtiers. In ""Camille"" she is by profession a lover, and so her ultimate renunciation of Armand, reveals the true depth of her character. But one cannot conceive of her destroying the lives of others to satisfy a whimsical infatuation.And this is where Miss Leigh's Anna trumps Garbo, for Miss Leigh does successfully transmit Anna's neurasthenic and utterly reckless collapse at the feet of the dashing Count. She seems blown by forces much stronger than she--a daffodil in a windstorm, and light years from Garbo's deep Scandanavian imperturbability.Given the alleged similarities between Miss Leigh and Anna's disposition, perhaps this is life imitating art. In any case, it is why she makes a truer Anna, and why the role serves as a warm up for Blanche Dubois...She is also abetted in her interpretation, by the genuinely eerie, recurring, nightmare sequence--with the Charon like, white bearded old man, forever dogging her as he chinks away at the ice. An ill omen indeed ! And Miss Leigh conveys the desperation of her impending doom in every gesture and nuance.Then too Keiron Moore, (despite being an inferior actor to Frederic March) is much more dashing and handsome as Vronsky--a fact which, at least in terms of audience sympathy, helps explain the attraction.Strangely, Mr. March who had been so visually appealing as Dr. Jeckyll, just a few years earlier, photographs very poorly in the Garbo version, and is not helped by a buzz haircut.And as superb as Cedric Gibbons sets and Adrian's costumes are as a backdrop for Garbo, we feel Mr.Andrejew's art direction and Cecil Beaton's designs get the nod here as well, if only perhaps in their European origin, and the deep, appropriately moody nineteenth century shadows with which they are lit and photographed.However, as visually sumptuous cinematic recreations of a vanished aristocratic world--each version has much to savor, and should be taken in tandem.",3,Garbo fails to convince here.,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,3551,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'concede', '1935', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Anna', 'Karenina', '1948', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'version', 'close', 'capturing', 'complexities', 'Tolstoy', 'masterpiece', 'Most', 'significantly', 'Konstantin', 'Levin', 'Kitty', 'relationship', 'more', 'particularly', 'Levin', 'protracted', 'personal', 'metaphysical', 'development', 'are', 'dropped', 'entirely', 'screenplays', 'preferring', 'treat', 'story', 'adulterous', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'snowflakes', 'instead', 'palm', 'trees.That', 'said', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'films', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'film', 'craftsmanship', 'where', 'triple', 'triumphs', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'costume', 'design', 'are', 'real', 'stars.Which', 'not', 'way', 'lessen', 'contributions', 'cast', 'who', 'instances', 'make', 'best', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'with.Garbo', 'enchants', 'many', 'individual', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Freddy', 'Bartholomew', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'Kitty', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'advising', 'Kitty', 'seize', 'fleeting', 'youth', 'promise', 'dream', 'prince', 'emerge', 'blue', 'haze', 'mountain', 'top', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'muted', 'aversion', 'Alexei', 'Karenin', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'depiction', 'fatal', 'love', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Garbo', 'solemn', 'majestic', 'singular', 'self', 'possession', 'Queen', 'Christina', 'cerebral', 'detachment', 'simply', 'too', 'thoughtful', 'too', 'deliberate', 'way', 'Tolstoy', 'impulsive', 'febrile', 'thoughtless', 'anti-heroine.True', 'had', 'forsaken', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'Christina', 'decision', 'was', 'result', 'deep', 'thorough', 'soul', 'searching', 'explained', 'eloquence', 'Solomon', 'courtiers', 'Camille', 'profession', 'lover', 'so', 'ultimate', 'renunciation', 'Armand', 'true', 'depth', 'character', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'conceive', 'destroying', 'lives', 'others', 'satisfy', 'whimsical', 'infatuation.And', 'where', 'Miss', 'Leigh', 'Anna', 'Garbo', 'Miss', 'Leigh', 'successfully', 'transmit', 'Anna', 'neurasthenic', 'utterly', 'reckless', 'collapse', 'feet', 'dashing', 'Count', 'blown', 'forces', 'much', 'stronger', 'daffodil', 'windstorm', 'light', 'years', 'Garbo', 'deep', 'Scandanavian', 'alleged', 'similarities', 'Miss', 'Leigh', 'Anna', 'disposition', 'perhaps', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'case', 'why', 'truer', 'Anna', 'why', 'role', 'warm', 'up', 'Blanche', 'Dubois', 'also', 'abetted', 'interpretation', 'genuinely', 'eerie', 'recurring', 'nightmare', 'sequence', 'Charon', 'white', 'bearded', 'old', 'man', 'forever', 'dogging', 'away', 'ice', 'ill', 'omen', 'indeed', 'Miss', 'Leigh', 'conveys', 'desperation', 'impending', 'doom', 'gesture', 'nuance.Then', 'too', 'Keiron', 'Moore', 'being', 'inferior', 'actor', 'Frederic', 'March', 'much', 'more', 'dashing', 'handsome', 'Vronsky', 'fact', 'least', 'terms', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'explain', 'attraction.Strangely', 'Mr.', 'March', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'visually', 'appealing', 'Dr.', 'Jeckyll', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'photographs', 'very', 'poorly', 'Garbo', 'version', 'not', 'helped', 'buzz', 'haircut.And', 'as', 'superb', 'Cedric', 'Gibbons', 'sets', 'Adrian', 'costumes', 'are', 'backdrop', 'Garbo', 'feel', 'Mr.Andrejew', 'art', 'direction', 'Cecil', 'Beaton', 'designs', 'get', 'nod', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'perhaps', 'European', 'origin', 'deep', 'appropriately', 'moody', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'shadows', 'are', 'lit', 'photographed.However', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'cinematic', 'recreations', 'vanished', 'aristocratic', 'world', 'version', 'much', 'savor', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'tandem']",Anna Karenina VHS

275606,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6301964144,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[3, 7]","As I plow my way through this Great Garbo Signature Collection a few things are becoming somewhat apparent. One, as Garbo got older she grew into her beauty and out of that ghostly look she had in his early films. And two, she is a movie star not a serious actress. As a result this adaptation of ""Anna Karenina"" is much more a Garbo vehicle than a serious take on a serious piece of Russian literature. Like most of her film entrances this one is marked by an extreme close up, lighting that is way too bright, and actual fanfare that today would just seem silly. The main problem I had was that it was just not very literary. The vocab is at a second grade reading level and the ideas are bold and unambiguous. The book and even the movie are old old old so I will forgive the story for feeling familiar, and you have to appreciate the message they are trying to spread. Here we have Anna, who fought for love, but was crushed under an avalanche of honor and careers, and who died for the sins of the men in her life.The first 30 minutes of the film are a waste (sorry, sacrifice) as we visit an upscale party where Anna meets Count Vronsky (Fredric March). We get so much dancing and costuming that I started having flashbacks to ""Marie Antoinette"". From there the film turns its attention to the role of adultery and the repressive nature of marriage. Anna and Vronsky are besotted, but Anna is married to Karenin, a tough military type who marches around all day scolding her for spoiling their (obnoxious) son.  He doesn't really care if she loves him or not, just so long as she stays with him so that they can keep up appearances.  She eventually caves to passion and he resorts to the old ""Your mother is dead,"" trick to explain her absence to their son. The film takes a stand against all things that are rotten about our dealings with relationships. Marriage is presented as an evil force that is thrust upon us to quash free love, free sex, and freedom. The rules are blasted for being arbitrary and the fact that sometimes there is a better option out there than marriage is stated. Those who sit around all day imploring others to focus on their careers are dismissed as stuffy bougie folk with nothing better to do. Of course there is a lot of Hollywood hokum mixed in here, what with the rousing tale of how you should crawl out from under your oppressors boot and find true happiness, but still this movie rocks philosophically.Soon after running off together Anna and Vronsky realize that there is a difference between love making and love maintaining. Her son beckons her and the Serbian/Turkish War beckons him. These desires dominate their lives until the film moves towards a decent climax and the anti-climatic resolution. I would also like to say that in light of the Barbaro tragedy the horse racing scene is especially tough to watch. Not so much for the image of a horse being euthanized, but for those that involved real horses taking truly scary tumbles. This film may depict old school Russia but the message is still relevant. We are all too eager to slap on the shackles of jobs and relationships just so that we can bemoan the ball and chain. And the sooner we realize that our government is squarely on the side of Karenin, the better off we will be. **3/4",3,Love in an Age of Appearances,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,3290,"['plow', 'way', 'Great', 'Garbo', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'becoming', 'somewhat', 'apparent', 'One', 'Garbo', 'got', 'older', 'grew', 'beauty', 'ghostly', 'look', 'had', 'early', 'films', 'two', 'movie', 'star', 'not', 'serious', 'actress', 'result', 'adaptation', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'much', 'more', 'Garbo', 'vehicle', 'serious', 'take', 'serious', 'piece', 'Russian', 'literature', 'most', 'film', 'one', 'marked', 'extreme', 'close', 'up', 'lighting', 'way', 'too', 'bright', 'actual', 'fanfare', 'today', 'would', 'just', 'seem', 'silly', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'literary', 'vocab', 'second', 'grade', 'reading', 'level', 'ideas', 'are', 'bold', 'unambiguous', 'book', 'even', 'movie', 'are', 'old', 'old', 'old', 'will', 'forgive', 'story', 'feeling', 'familiar', 'have', 'appreciate', 'message', 'are', 'trying', 'spread', 'Here', 'have', 'Anna', 'who', 'fought', 'love', 'was', 'crushed', 'avalanche', 'honor', 'careers', 'who', 'died', 'sins', 'men', 'life.The', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'waste', 'sorry', 'sacrifice', 'visit', 'upscale', 'party', 'where', 'Anna', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'Fredric', 'March', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'dancing', 'costuming', 'started', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'film', 'attention', 'role', 'adultery', 'repressive', 'nature', 'marriage', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'are', 'besotted', 'Anna', 'married', 'Karenin', 'tough', 'military', 'type', 'who', 'day', 'scolding', 'spoiling', 'obnoxious', 'son', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'not', 'just', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'eventually', 'passion', 'old', 'mother', 'dead', 'trick', 'explain', 'absence', 'son', 'film', 'stand', 'things', 'are', 'rotten', 'dealings', 'relationships', 'Marriage', 'presented', 'evil', 'force', 'thrust', 'quash', 'free', 'love', 'free', 'sex', 'freedom', 'rules', 'are', 'blasted', 'being', 'arbitrary', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'better', 'option', 'there', 'marriage', 'stated', 'who', 'sit', 'day', 'imploring', 'others', 'focus', 'careers', 'are', 'dismissed', 'stuffy', 'bougie', 'folk', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'course', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'hokum', 'mixed', 'here', 'what', 'rousing', 'tale', 'how', 'should', 'crawl', 'out', 'oppressors', 'boot', 'find', 'true', 'happiness', 'still', 'movie', 'philosophically.Soon', 'running', 'off', 'together', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'realize', 'difference', 'love', 'making', 'love', 'maintaining', 'son', 'beckons', 'Serbian/Turkish', 'War', 'beckons', 'desires', 'dominate', 'lives', 'film', 'decent', 'climax', 'anti-climatic', 'resolution', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'say', 'light', 'Barbaro', 'tragedy', 'horse', 'racing', 'scene', 'especially', 'tough', 'watch', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'image', 'horse', 'being', 'euthanized', 'involved', 'real', 'horses', 'taking', 'truly', 'scary', 'tumbles', 'film', 'may', 'depict', 'old', 'school', 'Russia', 'message', 'still', 'relevant', 'are', 'too', 'eager', 'slap', 'shackles', 'jobs', 'relationships', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'bemoan', 'ball', 'chain', 'sooner', 'realize', 'government', 'squarely', 'side', 'Karenin', 'better', 'will', 'be', '**3/4']",Anna Karenina VHS

All the ingredients should have contributed to a memorable film but after a good start, it just doesn't happen.Maybe it is the short running time. A sweeping novel has been understandably truncated but Anna's relationship with Vronsky is not sufficiently developed so their passion is unconvincing. A number of scenes don't lead anywhere e.g. Kitty's marriage scene.Maybe it's the cast. Basil Rathbone as her husband rises to Garbo's level, superbly generating some sympathy within a stern and cold character and Reginald Owen is excellent as her brother. Freddie Bartholomew is awful with his acting school diction and delivery. Fredric March starts well, dashing and magnetic, but becomes mechanical and unconvincing as the film develops. Maureen O'Sullivan, no one's idea of a Russian or Garbo's sister, overacts in a simpering and cloying manner.Maybe it's the script and direction. The first 20 minutes are by far the best with a terrific scene when March and his colleagues drink and eat and as the film moves to the memorable introduction of Garbo through the steam of a train and shows her empathy and warmth as she deals with her errant brother. From there, it is a gradual downhill slide plodding along lugubriously and generating little passion. It is as if everyone ran out of interest, even Garbo.Maybe it was the censorship which caused so many of these problems. Anna Karenina is an adulteress so it is likely that any scenes of real passion would have been curtailed.The print of the film has not been restored and is dirty with white lines appearing often.

275609,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301964144,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""Anna Karenina"" is a 1935 film based on a Leon Tolstoy novel. Tolstoy published the novel in serialized form from 1873 to 1877, and it's said to be a rendering of the true life story of Maria Hartung, the eldest daughter of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Many critics consider the 800+ page novel one of the top 10 ever written.The novel first appeared in operas and plays beginning in the early 1900s. The first film adaptation was ""Love"", a 1927 silent film starring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert. Garbo had been in nearly 20 silent films, starting as early as 1920. Her best known silent film prior to ""Love"" was ""Flesh and the Devil"" (1926) which was directed by Clarence Brown.  She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Anna Christie"", ""Camille"", and ""Ninotchka"") but never won. She is listed #5 on the AFI's list of Greatest Actresses.The great Frederic March co-stars as Garbo's lover. March won an Oscar for ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931) and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946), and earned three more nominations. He won the Golden Globe for ""Death of a Salesman"" (1951) and earned two more nominations. He won two Tonys (""Years Ago"" and ""Long Days Journey Into Night""). He appeared in more than 50 films between 1921 and 1973. Personally I think his best performance was as Matthew Brady in ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960). He claimed he wasn't ""overwhelmed"" by Garbo's beauty and thought that ""women were more attracted to her than men."" March does an excellent job min this film. He looks like a younger brother to John Barrymore.Suave Basil Rathbone plays Garbo's husband. No one has ever been better at playing the villain or the rouge than Rathbone. His performances in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), ""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Tower of London"" (1939), and ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940) are classic. He was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""If I Were King""). He's probably best remembered as the heroic Sherlock Holmes in the 14 films he made between 1939 and 1946. Rathbone gives a sympathetic performance as Garbo's cuckolded husband.The beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan is best remembered as Tarzan's Jane. She played Jane 6 times between 1932 and 1942, but she played many other roles during that time, including ""Tugboat Annie"" (1933), ""The Thin Man"" (1934), ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935), ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), ""A Yank at Oxford"" (1938), and ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1940). She slowed down in the 40s to devote time to her husband and 7 children, one of whom is the actress Mia Farrow. O'Sullivan plays Garbo's sister and does a sweet job in the little time she has on screen.Freddie Bartholomew plays Garbo's son. Freddie was one of the most famous child actors of the 1930s, appearing in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" (1`936), ""Captains Courageous"" (1937) and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). Freddie gives his usual endearing performance.Reginald Owen plays Prince Stiva, Garbo's brother.  Owen was a distinguished actor who appeared in over 100 films including playing Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938), Admiral Boom in  ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and General Teagler in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1972). He had the distinction of playing both Sherlock Holmes (""A study in Scarlet"") and Dr. Watson (""Sherlock Holmes"") and played King Louis XV in 3 different films. Own does his usual credible job.Clarence Brown directs. Brown was a well known silent film director (""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Flesh and the Devil""). He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times (""Anna Christie"", ""A Free Soul"", ""The Human Comedy"", ""National Velvet"", and ""The Yearling"") but never won. His films earned 38 Oscar nominations and 9 wins, but never for Director. This was his third film with Garbo and they would work together on three more films. He loved working with actresses, and also worked with Joan Crawford 6 times.  The film tends to drag at times, and at other times the pacing is uneven. Scenes appear that are hours and then months apart, with no apparent rationale.Williams Daniels is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948). Daniels' photography is exceptional. It's one of the best parts of the film.David Selznick produced for MGM. Selznick is best remembered for ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), but he was nominated for 8 other Oscars for films as diverse as ""Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1936), ""A Star is Born"" (1937), ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Spellbound"" (1945). Beyond these, he was also involved in one capacity or another in such classics as ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) and ""The Third Man"" (1949) among the nearly 90 films he produced. The production values in this film are excellent. One can feel the opulence.Garbo won Best Actress from the New York Film Critics and Brown won Best Foreign Film at the Venice Film festival. There were no Oscar nominations.

Those expressive close-up need to be exquisite because most of the rest of this film is perfunctory Hollywood hack work. Oh, let's give Basil Rathbone a bone for his craftsmanly performance as the cold husband Karenin. On the debit side, here's a kick in the shins for Frederick March, whose performance as Count Vronsky lacks any subtlety or thespian skill.The first ten minutes of this film do belong, at least partially, to Leo Tolstoy... to the novel Anna Karenina. Of course, if the rest of the script had been as attentive to Tolstoy, the film would have been six hours long instead of ninety minutes. Half or more of the novel is about Levin -- his soul-searching for a creditable way of life in his Russia -- but in the film Levin is a walk-on, and his eventual marriage to Kitty just an excuse to film a picturesque Orthodox wedding. This script excludes everything from the novel except the 'romance' of Anna and Vronsky. Even that gets more and more clipped and cursory as the ninety minutes tick by. The final scenes, including Anna's suicide, are no better than a Cliff Notes precis of the death of a romance.If anything saves this film as an entertainment, it's the sophistication of black-and-white. The sets and costumes have the elegance of 1935 about them, when Hollywood was the Holy Land of dreams for Depression-stricken America.

275612,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6301964144,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 3]","We recently ran a  ""Greta Garbo Weekend"" festival at the library where I work.  While I don't pretend to be an expert, I was familiar with most of the films  screened over the course of those three days. One that I had somehow managed to miss all these years was the 1935 version of ANNA KARENINA.  Yes, I'dread that it's considered by many to be the best of the various screen adaptations,and at least in theory, it seemed to be an ideal vehicle for  the enigmatic, world weary but glamorous Garbo.But you can be genuinely curious about a film and still have some qualms about it. Hollywood--in whatever era--does not always do well by literary classics.  Shoehorning an 800 page novel into less than two hours seems risky at best. So much has to be streamlined, if not completely excised.Admirers of any adapted film's source novel can usually rattle off dozens of ways in which their beloved work was compromised  (or downright mangled) in its translation to the big screen.Initially,  I was actually a bit startled to see that this particular version of the Tolstoy classic didn't even last two hours:  it clocks in at just over 90 minutes.  That wasn't all that unusual for films of that era,  but in this case,  a longer version might have been deemed warranted.Oddly enough, this relatively abbreviated  film not only works,  but it's actually seems to be just right.  One is aware that certain short cuts are being taken along the way, as well as  certain liberties with characterization and with the plot itself.  But this version of ANNA KARENINA does work in strictly cinematic terms: well enough, in fact, that it could inspire viewers familiar with the novel to  re-read it--and could just as well inspire someone unfamiliar with the work to finally pick it up.It shouldn't be surprising that the focus of film version is Anna's story. The novel's  Kitty/Levin subplot is only given the shortest of shrifts.  This particular artistic decision makes good sense in cinematic terms. There is enough of their story  in the film to serve as sharp contrast to Anna's own fate.  After initial hesitancy on Kitty's part,  she and Levin marry, start a family  and  readily embrace social convention--in stark contrast to Anna and Vronsky's  sacrificing social standing and prestige on the altar of their passion.Similarly,  we get just enough of a glimpse of the amorous misadventures of  Anna's brother Stiva to understand how ""double "" the standards of the day truly were.Yes, the novel fleshes it all out more,  but director Clarence Brown (a celebrated filmmaker of his era, who is largely--and shamefully--forgotten today)  and his fleet of writers succeeded in making a film that evoked its source work,  while fully understanding the strengths and limitations of cinematic narrative.And kudos to cinematographer William H. Daniels as well. Daniels works magic throughout, but particularly in the early scenes of the ball at which Stiva and Vronsky are first introduced.  Ingenious tracking shots of the banquet table,  successfully convey the opulence and decadence of the Russian aristocracy.Daniels worked on a number of  Garbo films (including ANNA CHRISTIE,  GRAND HOTEL,  SUSAN LENOX and NINOTCHKA), and while he modestly denied actually creating the ""Garbo face,""  it is also true that you could frame and exhibit any number of stills from this film or any of the other aforementioned classics and you'd have a truly remarkable exhibit.Garbo is supported by an excellent cast.  Fredric March makes for a dashing Vronsky--but is also capable of suggesting his character's many inner conflicts.  Basil Rathbone is equally good at suggesting Alexei Karenin's complexities.  The character of Anna's bureaucrat husband could have been little more than caricature.  Rathbone gives us substantially more than that.I mentioned director Clarence Brown above,  as a director whose work is undeservedly neglected today.  In fact,  he shares with Alfred Hitchcock the somewhat dubious distinction of receiving the most (six) Academy Award nominations for directing without a single win.Hitchcock of course, is now widely acknowledged now as one of the greats of Hollywood's classic era.  His lack of an Oscar has actually become a kind of perverse badge of honor.  It's possible--if not likely--that Brown may be subject to a similar re-evaluation at some point.  His work on this film (as well as ANNA CHRISTIE,  NATIONAL VELVET , THE YEARLING and others) suggest s that that time may be past due.",4,A Great Star--A Forgotten Director,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,4503,"['recently', 'ran', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Weekend', 'festival', 'library', 'where', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'expert', 'was', 'familiar', 'most', 'films', 'screened', 'course', 'three', 'days', 'One', 'had', 'somehow', 'managed', 'miss', 'years', 'was', '1935', 'version', 'ANNA', 'KARENINA', 'Yes', ""I'dread"", 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'best', 'various', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'least', 'theory', 'seemed', 'be', 'ideal', 'vehicle', 'enigmatic', 'world', 'weary', 'glamorous', 'Garbo.But', 'can', 'be', 'genuinely', 'curious', 'film', 'still', 'have', 'qualms', 'Hollywood', 'era', 'not', 'always', 'do', 'well', 'literary', 'classics', 'Shoehorning', '800', 'page', 'novel', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'risky', 'best', 'So', 'much', 'be', 'streamlined', 'not', 'completely', 'excised.Admirers', 'adapted', 'film', 'source', 'novel', 'can', 'usually', 'rattle', 'off', 'dozens', 'ways', 'beloved', 'work', 'was', 'compromised', 'downright', 'mangled', 'translation', 'big', 'screen.Initially', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'startled', 'see', 'particular', 'version', 'Tolstoy', 'classic', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'last', 'two', 'hours', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'was', ""n't"", 'unusual', 'films', 'era', 'case', 'longer', 'version', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'deemed', 'warranted.Oddly', 'enough', 'relatively', 'abbreviated', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'actually', 'be', 'just', 'right', 'One', 'aware', 'certain', 'short', 'cuts', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'liberties', 'characterization', 'plot', 'version', 'ANNA', 'KARENINA', 'work', 'strictly', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'well', 'enough', 'fact', 'could', 'inspire', 'viewers', 'familiar', 'novel', 're-read', 'could', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'inspire', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'work', 'finally', 'pick', 'up.It', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'focus', 'film', 'version', 'Anna', 'story', 'novel', 'Kitty/Levin', 'subplot', 'only', 'given', 'shortest', 'shrifts', 'particular', 'artistic', 'decision', 'good', 'sense', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'enough', 'story', 'film', 'serve', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Anna', 'own', 'fate', 'initial', 'hesitancy', 'Kitty', 'part', 'Levin', 'marry', 'start', 'family', 'readily', 'embrace', 'social', 'convention', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'sacrificing', 'social', 'standing', 'prestige', 'altar', 'passion.Similarly', 'get', 'just', 'enough', 'glimpse', 'amorous', 'misadventures', 'Anna', 'brother', 'Stiva', 'understand', 'how', 'double', 'standards', 'day', 'truly', 'were.Yes', 'novel', 'more', 'director', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'celebrated', 'filmmaker', 'era', 'who', 'largely', 'shamefully', 'forgotten', 'today', 'fleet', 'writers', 'succeeded', 'making', 'film', 'evoked', 'source', 'work', 'fully', 'understanding', 'strengths', 'limitations', 'cinematic', 'narrative.And', 'kudos', 'cinematographer', 'William', 'H.', 'Daniels', 'well', 'Daniels', 'magic', 'particularly', 'early', 'scenes', 'ball', 'Stiva', 'Vronsky', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'Ingenious', 'tracking', 'shots', 'banquet', 'table', 'successfully', 'convey', 'opulence', 'decadence', 'Russian', 'aristocracy.Daniels', 'worked', 'number', 'Garbo', 'films', 'including', 'ANNA', 'CHRISTIE', 'GRAND', 'HOTEL', 'SUSAN', 'LENOX', 'NINOTCHKA', 'modestly', 'denied', 'actually', 'creating', 'Garbo', 'face', 'also', 'true', 'could', 'frame', 'exhibit', 'number', 'stills', 'film', 'other', 'aforementioned', 'classics', ""'d"", 'have', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'exhibit.Garbo', 'supported', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Fredric', 'March', 'dashing', 'Vronsky', 'also', 'capable', 'suggesting', 'character', 'many', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'equally', 'good', 'suggesting', 'Alexei', 'Karenin', 'complexities', 'character', 'Anna', 'bureaucrat', 'husband', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'caricature', 'Rathbone', 'substantially', 'more', 'that.I', 'mentioned', 'director', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'above', 'director', 'work', 'undeservedly', 'neglected', 'today', 'fact', 'shares', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'distinction', 'receiving', 'most', 'six', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'directing', 'single', 'win.Hitchcock', 'course', 'now', 'widely', 'acknowledged', 'now', 'one', 'greats', 'Hollywood', 'classic', 'era', 'lack', 'Oscar', 'actually', 'become', 'kind', 'perverse', 'badge', 'honor', 'possible', 'not', 'likely', 'Brown', 'may', 'be', 'subject', 'similar', 're-evaluation', 'point', 'work', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'ANNA', 'CHRISTIE', 'NATIONAL', 'VELVET', 'THE', 'YEARLING', 'others', 'suggest', 's', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'past', 'due']",Anna Karenina VHS

Frederic March, Basil Rathbone, Freddie Batholemew and Maureen O'Sullivan co-star in one of the finest adaptations of what is hailed as one of the greatest novels ever written. Basil Rathbone, in my opinion, is so far the best Karenin I have seen so far. Greta Garbo is, of course, luminous as the doomed Anna. Freddie Bartholemew is really cute as Sergei (though I think the name of Anna's son is different in the novel; I could be wrong. Unfortunately, Maureen O'Sullivan's role of Kitty is sorely underwritten here (and would suffer the same fate in the 1948 screen version). In addition to this grand adaptation, I also highly recommend the 1997 version starring Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean, James Fox, Mia Kirshner and Alfred Molina as Levin. The television miniseries made in the 1970's is okay. The 1935 and 1997 versions of Leo Tolstoy's epic love story are well worth viewing.

Garbo, always fascinating to watch, is very strong in the role of a woman torn between her love for an officer and sacrificing her child.  Fredric March, as the officer she loves, does not register as strongly.  It's difficult to see the attraction he holds for Garbo.

In 19th-Century Russia Anna is married to a wealthy government man, Karenin (Basil Rathbone), and bears him a son, Sergei (Freddie Bartholomew).  When Anna goes to visit her brother, Stiva (Reginald Owen), to try and save his marriage after his numerous affairs, she meets and falls in love with Count Vronsky (Fredric March).  Anna returns home and asks Karenin for a divorce, but he refuses and warns that if she continues her affair with Vronsky she will lose her son.  But Anna still decides to run away with Vronsky to Venice, and for a while they are happy together.  Then Vronsky wants to return to the army.This film provides one of Garbo's finest performances in the type of role that made her famous, namely a tragic beautiful woman whose life is ruined by ruthless men.  In fact, she won the New York Film Critics Cirlce Award for Best Actress.  But in the end Anna has given up her son and Vronsky refuses to give up going to war, which is why we get the tragic ending.  &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; was a remake of Garbo's silent film &quot;Love,&quot; which she made in 1927 with John Gilbert, but that film is not available on video otherwise you would have a perfect Garbo double-bill with the two films.  Certainly March is a much better actor than Gilbert, but Garbo is the star of this one.  Despite the meticulous costumes and settings representing St. Petersburg, she steals the show in this film.  I think there is something to be said for using great literature, which provides greater depth than you get with most of her romantic vehicles.  &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; was remade again in 1948 with Vivien Leigh.",5,Greta Garbo shines as Tolstoy's tragic heroine,996883200,"08 4, 2001",2001,1762,"['Greta', 'Garbo', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'tragic', 'heroine', '1935', 'film', 'directed', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'produced', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', '19th-Century', 'Russia', 'Anna', 'married', 'wealthy', 'government', 'man', 'Karenin', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'son', 'Sergei', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'When', 'Anna', 'visit', 'brother', 'Stiva', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'try', 'save', 'marriage', 'numerous', 'affairs', 'love', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Anna', 'home', 'Karenin', 'divorce', 'affair', 'Vronsky', 'will', 'lose', 'son', 'Anna', 'still', 'run', 'away', 'Vronsky', 'Venice', 'while', 'are', 'happy', 'together', 'Then', 'Vronsky', 'return', 'army.This', 'film', 'one', 'Garbo', 'finest', 'performances', 'type', 'role', 'made', 'famous', 'namely', 'tragic', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'life', 'ruined', 'ruthless', 'men', 'fact', 'won', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Cirlce', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'end', 'Anna', 'given', 'up', 'son', 'Vronsky', 'give', 'up', 'going', 'war', 'why', 'get', 'tragic', 'ending', 'quot', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'quot', 'was', 'remake', 'Garbo', 'silent', 'film', 'quot', 'Love', 'quot', 'made', '1927', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'film', 'not', 'available', 'video', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'perfect', 'Garbo', 'double-bill', 'two', 'films', 'Certainly', 'March', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'Gilbert', 'Garbo', 'star', 'one', 'meticulous', 'costumes', 'settings', 'representing', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'show', 'film', 'think', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'using', 'great', 'literature', 'greater', 'depth', 'get', 'most', 'romantic', 'vehicles', 'quot', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'quot', 'was', 'remade', 'again', '1948', 'Vivien', 'Leigh']",Anna Karenina VHS

I fault her lover for going after a married woman! What a rotten creek F. March played! The child especially suffered! Look at her son.

Now, we're all familiar with Basil's villains, like Sir Guy in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; or his indestructible hero Sherlock Holmes. This time he was trying something different for a while: he actually was conveying nervousness when his character had to take his wife to task for her improprieties. Very unlike Basil, and I was surprised and delighted to see it. However, his character quickly had to become A Mean Vengeful Husband in order to make Garbo's Anna look good, and that was a bore.Which brings me round to my general opinion of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, notwithstanding BR. I found this an unsatisfactory representation of Tolstoy's novel because the characterization of Anna is all wrong. Garbo is much too confident, too together to make this story work. Anna is a formerly above reproach wife of a bureaucrat. Finally, she attracts some attention from a dashing army officer and then she falls from grace. I guess no one had tried to seduce her before; she is not in love with her husband. But though she chooses to pursue her illicit affair with Count Vronsky the officer, she cannot withstand society's rejection of her. It's not just &quot;oh, she saw him talking gaily to a blonde&quot;--it's the whole of Russian society that turns its back on her for her sin. So, she starts to lose her grip mentally which is why she takes A Drastic Step at the story's end. Greta Garbo didn't seem all that interested in Fredric March's Vronsky, at least not so much to follow him to Venice. I also didn't think she interacted effectively with her husband in their early domestic scenes, either. Here, she was the one giving him the cold shoulder and he looked alienated. I would more certainly have believed he would be the one to look for consolation from Vronsky! Or at least somebody.Of course, with such a short running time, the Levin/Kitty subplot went nowhere. That's also too bad, because Maureen O'Sullivan's Kitty was cutting a good figure as the jilted somewhat jealous Kitty at the ball. Although a lot of reviewers really slam Fred March, he's okay, especially when he becomes increasingly exasperated with all the doggone togetherness his affair with Anna has brought him.Bottom line: Garbo not cast correctly.

Anna meets Count Vronsky (Frederic March) at a railway station and falls madly in love. This poses a problem since she is married and has a small boy called Sergie. Anna has a love affair with Vronsky and decides to give up her position in 19th century Russia for the handsome Count. The price Anna has to pay is high however. Karenin  writes Anna a letter forbidding her to ever see her child.(In 19th century Russia the man had total power and if the wife left her husband she could be arrested and imprisoned or even subject to house arrest. The same thing happened with Michael Romanov and Natasha. Russia was a little backward compared to Europe and women lost the respect of relatives and friends. Divorce was not practiced and was frowned upon however most cultures did frown upon divorce. It was usually the woman who was disgraced.) Anna travels with Vronsky but misses her child. She tries to go to her son but is caught by her demanding husband. He forbids her to see Sergie again. Anna stays with Vronsky but people start to talk and  gossip. Soon the affair becomes a curse to Anna and Count Vronsky. Desperation sets in for Anna and she can only see one alternative!This was a beautiful movie and only Greta Garbo could play the part of Anna Karenina. The film won the Mussolini Cup for best foreign film at the Venice Festival. Garbo received a New York Film Critic Circle Award for Best Actress. Anna Karenina was one of Garbo's best films. This movie only took a small chunk of the book and was followed but was very condensed. The book was a lot deeper and had more characters.

However it really should have been longer than it was.  That would have made the romance between Anna and Vronsky more believable as well as the eventual demise of their passion.  Here it all happens so quickly that we almost don't get enough time to fully engage with the characters.Garbo makes it all worthwhile, though.  She is stunningly magnificent here -- I think more beautiful than in many of her other films.  Besides her very lovely physical beauty, her charm and naturalness, especially in the early scenes with her family, are winning.  No wonder Vronksy fell in love with her at first sight.Casting Frederich March as Vronsky seems like a mistake to me, but perhaps he was considered a heart-throb at the time.  To my eyes, he is stiff, a bit pudgy and just not very attractive.  Perhaps if more time had been given to the  buildup of the romance we might have seen what Anna saw in him, but here we just have to take it on faith.  Basil Rathbone, as the passionless husband, actually stirred up more excitement, although in a negative way.  His scene with their son, Sergei, (Freddie Bartholomew) was quite moving.I loved the opening scene of the fantastic banquet and the drinking contest, also the ball, (the Mazurka was wonderful), and the opera was a hoot!  The scenes at the train station, in the snow, are appropriately chilling.  So much drama has happened on European trains in those wonderful old stations.

275626,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6301964144,"""scotsladdie""","[6, 7]","The classic novel by Tolstoy is something more than a tale of sin and retribution, old style.  Each character, while being completely individual, is just as completely a product of class and time and envirnment. The word &quot;doomed&quot; is used in the dialogue, and though as a word, under the circumstances, it echoes with suggestions of melodrama and mock-heroics, it has this accuracy in it, that it suggests the fatal and inescapable power with which tradition, position and point of view worked upon the Russian aristocracy of the period.  With a firm foundation to stand on, Garbo portrays Anna with rare depth and beauty, as a gentlewoman of charm and poise, radiating a calm and enchanting loveliness, in who a great passion awakes, stirring up profound emotions and sufferings. She does it so quietly and subtly that you never catch her in the act of working to create an effect. It is as natural and true as if you were being permitted to eavesdrop on a woman in moments of most complete unselfconsciousness, so intimately herself that the make-up box seems a million miles away. This creation is the soul of the picture, and gives it its whole unity and meaning. Whether or not you are fascinated by Fredric March, Garbo makes you believe that he fascinated Anna, and on that belief the entire structure of the drama depends.

What sets MGM's 1935 version apart and places it above the others is Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Karenin.  It is, after all, Karenin, and not Vronsky, who establishes the parameters which define Anna.  It is Karenin who forces the romance to become a tragedy.  And it is Basil Rathbone, a career supporting actor who would mature like cheese when he began starring in Sherlock Holmes movies, who actually makes Karenin someone, something more than a stock character.  Yes, Greta Garbo and the others are good, but it's Basil Rathbone who makes this a movie you really must see.",5,It's elementary: Give the devil his due.,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,680,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'film', 'adaptations', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'What', 'MGM', '1935', 'version', 'apart', 'others', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'portrayal', 'Karenin', 'Karenin', 'not', 'Vronsky', 'who', 'parameters', 'define', 'Anna', 'Karenin', 'who', 'romance', 'become', 'tragedy', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'career', 'supporting', 'actor', 'who', 'would', 'mature', 'cheese', 'when', 'began', 'starring', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'movies', 'who', 'actually', 'Karenin', 'someone', 'something', 'more', 'stock', 'character', 'Yes', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'others', 'are', 'good', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'who', 'movie', 'really', 'must', 'see']",Anna Karenina VHS
275629,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,6301964144,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[2, 2]","+++++This movie is based on the very long 1877 Russian novel ""Anna Karenina"" by Count Leo Tolstoy (1828 to 1910).The thick novel is really two novels: a powerful drama of a woman trapped in a loveless marriage seeking love and happiness and Tolstoy's spiritual confessions of his lifelong meditations on birth, death, and God.This movie focuses out of necessity for time constraints on the first aspect mentioned above.Thus this movie is about Anna Karenina (Greta Garbo), a woman who has beauty, social position, wealth, a husband (Basil Rathbone), and a son (Freddie Bartholomew) who adores her but her existence seems empty.  When she meets the dashing officer Count Vronsky (Fredric March), she rejects her marriage and turns to him to fulfill her passionate nature.Greta Garbo along with Fredric March carry the movie and they both give fine performances.  Even Freddie Bartholomew (who was then a child star) does a good job.  In my opinion though, Basil Rathbone gives a very convincing performance as the husband who is concerned with his career and social position above everything else.The Russian music that occasionally plays is fantastic.  The costumes are a sight to behold.  All scenery and cinematography are breathtaking.Unfortunately, the movie seems rushed and doesn't do justice to the rich supporting cast of Tolstoy's novel.  There is a sub-plot with two other characters that seems to go nowhere.  The forming of the relationship (that's central to the movie) between Garbo and March seems somewhat unbelievable since not enough time is given for it to develop.  Worse still, as the movie proceeds it doesn't seem to gain momentum and becomes more-or-less predictable (even though I did not see the last scene coming).Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in Sept. 2005) has good sound quality.  The picture quality is also surprisingly good (especially when you consider that this movie was made so long ago) but there are faint streaks or lines that occasionally occur in the last scene.  There is one extra: a theatrical trailer.In conclusion, I think Greta Garbo fans will appreciate this movie despite its problems much more than non-Garbo fans.(1935; 95 min;  black and white;  27 scenes;  full screen)+++++",3,The Story of a Russian Love Triangle,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2240,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'based', 'very', 'long', '1877', 'Russian', 'novel', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Count', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', '1828', '1910', '.The', 'thick', 'novel', 'really', 'two', 'novels', 'powerful', 'drama', 'woman', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'seeking', 'love', 'happiness', 'Tolstoy', 'spiritual', 'confessions', 'lifelong', 'meditations', 'birth', 'death', 'God.This', 'movie', 'necessity', 'time', 'constraints', 'first', 'aspect', 'mentioned', 'above.Thus', 'movie', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'woman', 'who', 'beauty', 'social', 'position', 'wealth', 'husband', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'son', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'who', 'existence', 'empty', 'When', 'dashing', 'officer', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'Fredric', 'March', 'marriage', 'fulfill', 'passionate', 'nature.Greta', 'Garbo', 'Fredric', 'March', 'carry', 'movie', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'Even', 'Freddie', 'Bartholomew', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'child', 'star', 'good', 'job', 'opinion', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'husband', 'who', 'concerned', 'career', 'social', 'position', 'everything', 'else.The', 'Russian', 'music', 'occasionally', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'are', 'sight', 'behold', 'scenery', 'cinematography', 'are', 'breathtaking.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'rushed', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'rich', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Tolstoy', 'novel', 'sub-plot', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'go', 'nowhere', 'forming', 'relationship', 'central', 'movie', 'Garbo', 'March', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'given', 'develop', 'Worse', 'still', 'movie', 'proceeds', ""n't"", 'seem', 'gain', 'momentum', 'more-or-less', 'predictable', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'last', 'scene', 'coming', '.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', 'Sept.', '2005', 'good', 'sound', 'quality', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'are', 'faint', 'streaks', 'lines', 'occasionally', 'occur', 'last', 'scene', 'one', 'extra', 'theatrical', 'trailer.In', 'conclusion', 'think', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'problems', 'much', 'more', 'non-Garbo', 'fans', '1935', '95', 'min', 'black', 'white', '27', 'scenes', 'full', 'screen', '+++++']",Anna Karenina VHS
275630,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6301964144,Susan Fong,"[25, 27]","It is appropriate that one of literature's greatest and most tragic figures, Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, is given compelling life on screen by one of fildom's most gifted and spellbinding artists, Greta Garbo, in MGM's luxurious production of Tolstoy's masterpiece, &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;.Anna is the neglected wife of Russian aristocrat/bureaucrat, Karenin, haughtily portrayed by Basil Rathbone. Karenin is consumed by his career and social standing.  It seems that the only reason he married Anna and had a son with her is to enhance his &quot;respectibility&quot; in society.When a handsome officer, Count Vronsky, played with conviction by Frederic March, understandably is infatuated by the astonishingly beautiful and charming Anna, he makes this known to her.  He is persistent in his pursuit of her.At first Anna is reticent to his charms, but eventually succumbs. This story takes place during the 1800's under the reign of Czar Nicholas I of Russia.  In this era, there was a strict and judgmental social code.  Adultery was treated like a crime or a contagious disease, and Anna finds herself the object of scorn and ridicule among society.Anna's husband Karenin refuses to grant Anna a divorce and tells their son that Anna is dead when she flees to Venice with Vronsky. Eventually Anna becomes a social outcast because of her affair, and Vronsky begins to suffocate from their relationship. He decides to go off to war rather than be with Anna constantly.Devasted by Vronsky's abandonment and shunned by society, Anna's fate is tragic.I can imagine few other actresses than Greta Garbo who could so realistically embody the character of Anna. Anna is essentially a good person, a loving mother, and dutiful wife.  But she is starved for tenderness and affection so she turns to Vronsky.  Garbo subtly conveys Anna's despair and loneliness in her loveless marriage to Karenin.  Garbo makes you empathize with her predicament, and you truly feel the joy, passion, and guilt that Anna experiences as she falls in love with Vronsky.As an actress, Garbo is a minimalist in the best sense.  She understands that less is more.  She can gladden or break your heart with a glance, a smile, or the slightest tilt of her posture.  Her eyes are wondrously expressive. This is a masterful, mature, and dignified performance by a consummate actress.As for the rest of the movie, the direction, sets, and photography are all impressive.  And Garbo's unearthly beauty is complemented by the ravishing costumes designed by Adrian. This version of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; is a triumph.",5,Triumphant,1036886400,"11 10, 2002",2002,2583,"['appropriate', 'one', 'literature', 'greatest', 'most', 'tragic', 'figures', 'Tolstoy', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'given', 'compelling', 'life', 'screen', 'one', 'fildom', 'most', 'gifted', 'spellbinding', 'artists', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'MGM', 'luxurious', 'production', 'Tolstoy', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'quot', 'neglected', 'wife', 'Russian', 'aristocrat/bureaucrat', 'Karenin', 'haughtily', 'portrayed', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'Karenin', 'consumed', 'career', 'social', 'standing', 'only', 'reason', 'married', 'Anna', 'had', 'son', 'enhance', 'quot', 'respectibility', 'quot', 'society.When', 'handsome', 'officer', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'played', 'conviction', 'Frederic', 'March', 'understandably', 'infatuated', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'Anna', 'known', 'persistent', 'pursuit', 'her.At', 'first', 'Anna', 'reticent', 'charms', 'eventually', 'succumbs', 'story', 'place', '1800', 'reign', 'Czar', 'Nicholas', 'Russia', 'era', 'was', 'strict', 'judgmental', 'social', 'code', 'Adultery', 'was', 'treated', 'crime', 'contagious', 'disease', 'Anna', 'object', 'scorn', 'ridicule', 'society.Anna', 'husband', 'Karenin', 'grant', 'Anna', 'divorce', 'tells', 'son', 'Anna', 'dead', 'when', 'Venice', 'Vronsky', 'Eventually', 'Anna', 'social', 'outcast', 'affair', 'Vronsky', 'suffocate', 'relationship', 'go', 'off', 'war', 'rather', 'be', 'Anna', 'constantly.Devasted', 'Vronsky', 'abandonment', 'shunned', 'society', 'Anna', 'fate', 'tragic.I', 'can', 'imagine', 'few', 'other', 'actresses', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'who', 'could', 'so', 'realistically', 'embody', 'character', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'essentially', 'good', 'person', 'loving', 'mother', 'dutiful', 'wife', 'starved', 'tenderness', 'affection', 'so', 'Vronsky', 'Garbo', 'subtly', 'Anna', 'despair', 'loneliness', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Karenin', 'Garbo', 'empathize', 'predicament', 'truly', 'feel', 'joy', 'passion', 'guilt', 'Anna', 'love', 'Vronsky.As', 'actress', 'Garbo', 'minimalist', 'best', 'sense', 'less', 'more', 'can', 'gladden', 'break', 'heart', 'glance', 'smile', 'slightest', 'tilt', 'posture', 'eyes', 'are', 'wondrously', 'expressive', 'masterful', 'mature', 'dignified', 'performance', 'consummate', 'actress.As', 'rest', 'movie', 'direction', 'sets', 'photography', 'are', 'impressive', 'Garbo', 'unearthly', 'beauty', 'complemented', 'ravishing', 'costumes', 'designed', 'Adrian', 'version', 'quot', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'quot', 'triumph']",Anna Karenina VHS
275631,A34D9Q0JTF7N7K,6301964144,Susan,"[0, 3]","....because he plays a cad and I just can't take seeing Fred playing a cad!  I was glad to read in his bio that he himself didn't want to do this part, feeling it wasn't really the best for him. But he had to do it...Really, he is much better as the romantic GOOD guy, not the sort of romantic, selfish BAD guy.I will start first with what I liked about this film. First of all, Fredric March. This man rarely fails to impress me as an actor. He was just such a wonderful guy too...so handsome and romantic. In this, he looks terrific in the military uniforms, has a GREAT haircut and a cute little mustache. Once again he has a drunk scene, which is very unique. All these Russian soldiers drinking shots in unison and with the precision as if they are doing drills on the parade field. And then they must crawl under the table, come back to their place, and then the commander shouts orders to prepare for the next drink...truly weird!! Also, the opening shot of the LONG LONG table of food was very impressive. I liked Basil Rathbone because he did a great job of being the strange husband of Anna's. I liked the relationship Anna had with her young son. I liked seeing Fred doing the Russian dance at the party.What I didn't like. As mentioned before, seeing Fred as a cad. I didn't like his selfishness. I don't like Greta Garbo much, and while she did okay in this film, she just seemed so tragic in spirit all the time, like she never really was happy, but was in a trap of an unhappy marriage, yet her affair with Vronsky was not any happier. It didn't seem like they really liked each other; I didn't feel any passion between them; it was very strange how the whole love affair was handled in the film, but then I read that the Code had a lot to do with that. I don't approve of affairs; and I couldn't respect Anna as a person because her values were wrong. She gave up her son for a fling with another man. A mother who truly loves her children will never go and seek something for herself at the expense of her children.The whole film was generally dark and meloncholy, sad and tragic. You could be happy for neither Anna or Vronsky. You sit at the end of the movie only feeling sad for their tragedy. It is not a ""happy"" watch.But I did like to gaze upon a handsome Fredric March! If you want to see Fredric as a Russian soldier again...see him in We Live Again. He is young and handsome and beautiful in this one too. Based on Leo Tolstoy's ""Ressurection"", he plays a cad in that one as well, but happily we get to see him realize the errors of his ways and he make his wrongs right.I must also share with you that this Anna Karenina is MUCH better than the later remake with Vivien Leigh.

You can see that she thinks it's ironic that it's okay for her brother to cheat on his wife, and the world accepts it, but it's not okay for her, a woman. The film is superficial, there is no ""great love"" portrayed, it seems that Anna merely ran away with Vronsky because he bugged her to, and she's a very weak-minded woman.
