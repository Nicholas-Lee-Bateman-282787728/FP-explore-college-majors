Snoop plays a thug type who earns the respect of everyone at the car wash where Dre goes for a job as well. Dre gets the job alright-as Snoop's boss! It starts out alright between them, but the job starts to go to Dre's head a bit and Dre starts losing respect from everyone working at the car wash, including Snoop. I think anyone who's a fan of Snoop and Dre will like this movie. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there is a very gross and unnecessary part in the movie where Dre buys a burrito off a vending truck, which Dre's boss warned him not to do. Well, Dre gets sick ...and it's shared with us. On the DVD, you may want to jump to the next scene if you have a weak stomach.

686843,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B00005V1XX,Crazy Jim,"[4, 4]","&quot;Friday&quot; co-writer DJ Pooh tries for another run at the urban buddy comedy concept with superstar rap duo, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg playing roomates who go from the closest of buds to being at odds when Dre gets a supervising job at the car wash where Snoop works. Despite a pretty solid supporting cast including George Wallace, Tommy &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister, Lamont Bentley, and Alex Thomas, this one is all over the place. Dre and Snoop's musical chemistry doesn't seem to translate too well into the cinematic world. Both seemed more comfortable in the bit parts they played in &quot;Training Day&quot; than they do trying to be the stars of their own feature. Pooh the writer seems content with sticking to the same tired drug humor and fart jokes while Pooh the director uses big-name rapper cameos to cover up these faults. The film is so stuffed with silly gags in fact that the movie's biggest conflict is pushed to the closing 20 minutes, leaving the audience with the impression that it probably isn't that important. &quot;The Wash&quot; has a few fleeting moments of humor including Kurupt as a neighborhood punk who interrogates Dre at gunpoint, Pooh as one of the bumbling kidnappers, and Eminem as a disgruntled former employee of the car wash. In the end though, it feels more like an R-rated episode of &quot;Keenen &amp; Kel&quot; than a comedic gem like &quot;Friday&quot;.

686849,A37FUJC2L7DSPT,B00005V1XX,"J. L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[0, 0]","Loaded with rap music artists including lead actors Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg (now Snoop Lion as I write this in 2014), the 2001 movie THE WASH comprises parts of comedy, buddy movie, and caper flick that subtly add up to a plea for community togetherness and individual forgiveness.  As if there is a law against going more than 90 minutes, THE WASH leaves a few matters unresolved (Dre and Snoop have dates over to their apartment when, last we heard, the landlord turned off the water) and seems in a hurry to get to end the movie after the resolution of the crisis at the car wash, where most of the film takes place.  But despite that zigging and zagging, THE WASH moves along briskly on the strength of its many charming performances, especially that of Dr. Dre.Maybe THE WASH writer-director D.J. Pooh does not want to upstage his star actors as he limits the screen time of the very funny character Slim, whom he portrays.  It's one of those stand-out roles where you'll read the closing credits to see the name of the actor who plays him if, like me, you did not know D.J. Pooh on sight.While not hitting you over the head with it, THE WASH centers on a car wash to symbolize how the young people put petty differences and jealousies aside and support one another.",3,"""But we're both black, so I don't wanna lay you flat""",1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,1270,"['Loaded', 'rap', 'music', 'including', 'lead', 'actors', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'now', 'Snoop', 'Lion', 'write', '2014', '2001', 'movie', 'THE', 'WASH', 'parts', 'comedy', 'buddy', 'movie', 'caper', 'flick', 'subtly', 'up', 'plea', 'community', 'togetherness', 'individual', 'forgiveness', 'law', 'going', 'more', '90', 'minutes', 'THE', 'WASH', 'few', 'matters', 'unresolved', 'Dre', 'Snoop', 'have', 'dates', 'apartment', 'when', 'last', 'heard', 'landlord', 'turned', 'off', 'water', 'hurry', 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'resolution', 'crisis', 'car', 'wash', 'where', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'zigging', 'zagging', 'THE', 'WASH', 'along', 'briskly', 'strength', 'many', 'charming', 'performances', 'especially', 'Dr.', 'Dre.Maybe', 'THE', 'WASH', 'writer-director', 'D.J', 'Pooh', 'not', 'want', 'upstage', 'star', 'actors', 'screen', 'time', 'very', 'funny', 'character', 'Slim', 'whom', 'one', 'stand-out', 'roles', 'where', ""'ll"", 'read', 'closing', 'credits', 'see', 'name', 'actor', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'D.J', 'Pooh', 'sight.While', 'not', 'hitting', 'head', 'THE', 'WASH', 'centers', 'car', 'wash', 'symbolize', 'how', 'young', 'people', 'put', 'petty', 'differences', 'jealousies', 'aside', 'support', 'one']",N/A
686850,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005V1XX,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","The Wash is a direct-to-DVD film written and directed by DJ Pooh, who co-wrote the popular Friday with Ice Cube. Starring Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg with cameo appearances and bit roles by nearly every major rapper of the time it was made, no one should start watching this movie expecting any kind of masterpiece. In fact, I actually find this film hard to review when I can't tell if anyone was taking this project seriously. There are times when The Wash seems less like a movie than a loose plot-line that gives a bunch of successful rappers the opportunity to hang out.Dr. Dre plays Sean, unemployed and needing to acquire his half of the rent money soon. His best friend and roommate Dee Loc (Snoop Dogg) suggests that Sean applies for a job at The Wash, where Dee Loc works. Sean impresses the owner Mr. Washington (George Wallace) and is hired as an assistant manager, but soon his seniority over Dee Loc puts a strain on their relationship.Xzibit, Ludacris, Kurupt, Tommy Chong, Shaquille O'Neal, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr., Eminem, and Pauly Shore all make appearances in this film. Before you read any further, I want you to notice that Pauly Shore makes an appearance in this film. This should give you an idea about the quality of the film, as well as help you to figure out whether you want to see it or not. In casting his film, DJ Pooh seems to have put more effort into getting these guys together than on his script. O'Neal, for example, shows up solely to punch a guy and look directly into the camera, while Shore plays the coveted role of ""Man in Trunk."" It's true, Tommy Chong is actually really funny in his brief appearance but many of these roles could have been played by a random, no-name extra. Eminem (in an un-credited role) plays Chris, who was recently fired by Mr. Washington and spends the majority of the film making threatening phone calls. This is not the Eminem from 8 Mile and he seems to be taking his role less seriously than the rest...Like he was the only one in on the joke.Snoop Dogg has a kind of natural screen presence that makes him a charming, funny actor to watch and he's amusing here, but he's just playing an angrier version of himself. Not to say Snoop Dogg has demonstrated a remarkable amount of acting range before, just that he's not doing much here. Dr. Dre isn't given much to do, but he's passable and is both likeable and amusing. It's clear that acting isn't one of his strong suits, but I've seen worse performances by non-actors. While following the characters of Sean and Dee Loc, DJ Pooh decided to have radio stations in the background announcing the world premiere of the new song by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. When Sean and Dee Loc are listening to songs by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg it just feels awkward and really jerks you out of the movie. This decision, among others, is why I'm not sure DJ Pooh was even trying to make a coherent movie.If you've seen Friday, you know what type of humor to expect from this film. The jokes revolve around the character's distinct, sometimes stereotypical personalities, ghetto jokes, drug jokes, and the occasional flatulence. Ice Cube's influence on the script for Friday is pretty evident as, despite having a similar sense of humor and a similar tone, Friday was a much better and funnier film than The Wash. Many of the jokes feel forced and there's not much consistency or coherency to the script. It feels like a compilation of loosely-related sketches like you'd see on a ghetto version of In Living Color and even with a 90-minute running time, it can grow tedious. No movie like this would be complete without several clich&eacute;d sequences and this movie delivers (the bikini-wash being a glaring one). None of the humor is particularly intelligent or even witty, but I admit that I did laugh out loud during several scenes. The Wash also boasts what may be the most inept, hilarious kidnappers to ever grace the screen, but that's a minor compliment. Going back to the lack of consistency, the ending is a problem; while I never did personally, I'd guess that DJ Pooh intended you to care about the relationship between Sean and Dee Loc and yet the movie ends so abruptly. After the big climax, it just ends...Like DJ Pooh ran out of film, time, or ideas.So is The Wash a waste of time? Not really. As a film, it has better production value than most straight-to-DVD movies. It looks like it had the same budget as Friday. Furthermore, this is a film made for a certain audience and I can't completely criticize a film that I assume wasn't taken seriously by its makers and (I presume) set out to be nothing more than a stoner comedy.  The Wash is a film that you know you will love or hate simply by glancing at the DVD or reading this review. If it looks like the ""best movie ever,"" you will probably enjoy it and it will find frequent rotation in your DVD player while you're hanging out with your friends. If it looks ""terrible"" and ""just as bad as Friday,"" this is not a movie you want to waste your time on. While I'll never go out of my way to watch this again, I'd happily watch it if a friend put it on. It's nothing special or impressive, but it has its moments.GRADE: C",3,"Nothing Special, But Not Without Its Moments",1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,5191,"['Wash', 'direct-to-DVD', 'film', 'written',

The landlord cuts the water off for non-payment of rent at a very critically funny moment.  Dee Loc encourages Sean to get a job at the local Car Wash with him. The Wash has some colorful employees, funny antics happening all day, shady type customers and a boss named Mr. Washington (George Wallace) that come together to make a comedy worth seeing.  It reminds me of the 1970s flick entitled CarWash.The movie really hooks the viewer once Mr. Washington hires Sean as Dee Loc's supervisor instead of as his peer/co-worker.  The tension flares up and the comedy really erupts.  Once it appears that the friendship is ruined, their boss is kidnapped by what appears to be the mob or gangsters.

I know it was a comedy and I did not have high expectations, but I only laughed during a few scenes.  The one when Sean was sitting on the toilet after eating a bad burrito, and the scene when DJ Pooh's character was being a bumbling criminal.  Oh yeah then there was the scene where all Shaq's character did was speak with his fist, and sent C-Money flying in the air.Aside of that this movie was just dumb.  Dee Loc and Sean are friends that seem to spend more time arguing, and trying to party and they are one step from eviction.  Dre loses his job at the footlocker, and is trying to figure out where he will get his next gig.  He ends up getting a job at The Wash, meets the woman of his dreams, and Dee Loc keeps trying to mess up with Sean trying to fix up the mess.  Sean is the more responsible of the two, while Dee Loc is always trying to get over, or get his hustle on.  Due to non payment of rent, the landlord decides to cut the water off in their apartment.  The Wash is a car wash, and seems everyone who works there is working hard not to work, spending time watching BET on TV or stealing the lose money left in the customers cars.  Sean lies to a woman he meets at the Wash about what he does, but eventually the truth does come out.Mr. Washington is kidnapped, Dee and Sean find a way to save him.  Mr. Washington is also having to deal with a disgruntled employee (Eminem) who spends the majority of the movie calling him and yelling into the phone like a nut case.  What really ticked me off was the way the movie just suddenly ended.  It left you going......is that it?There was one scene that pretty much shows me how Ghetto and the lack of respect some women have for themselves and will settle for any type of behavior.I just remembered on other scene that did make me chuckle a little.  One of the car wash guys is trying to use a customer's cell phone and it's the voice activated kind.  Instead of saying Four, he is saying foe and the voice on the phone says ""Again fool.""The film was stupid, senseless and moderately funny.  If you are expecting this film to be anything near what Friday was you will be very disappointed.  I love comedies, but this one left me dry.Lamont Bently (Moesha), Bruce Bruce, DJ Pooh, Kurupt, Xzibit, Truth Hurts, Tiny Lister (Friday, The Fifth Element), Angell Conwell (Soul Plane), Pierre(For Da Love of Money), Pauly Shore, Eminem have parts in the film.

This movie has its funny moments, like when Dre has the girl over and Snoop turns up the music and they keep doin it back and forth. Also when Snoop tells off Dre when hes tryin to sell weed to people at the wash. I recommend this movie to fans of Snoop or Dre, and fans of comedy of course. Im not being critical of this movie because its not that type of movie to be really criticized.In alot of comdedies, I usually dont laugh at the stupid stuff, but this movie actually made me laugh quite a bit because of how they act so check this movie out.",4,The Wash,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,725,"['People', 'cant', 'be', 'too', 'critical', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'comedy', 'Dre', 'Snoop', 'main', 'characters.The', 'story', 'wasnt', 'really', 'nothing', 'special', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'funny', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'when', 'Dre', 'girl', 'Snoop', 'up', 'music', 'keep', 'doin', 'back', 'forth', 'Also', 'when', 'Snoop', 'off', 'Dre', 'when', 'hes', 'tryin', 'sell', 'weed', 'people', 'wash', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'Snoop', 'Dre', 'fans', 'comedy', 'course', 'Im', 'not', 'being', 'critical', 'movie', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'be', 'really', 'criticized.In', 'alot', 'comdedies', 'usually', 'dont', 'laugh', 'stupid', 'stuff', 'movie', 'actually', 'made', 'quite', 'bit', 'how', 'act', 'so', 'check', 'movie', 'out']",N/A
