1291150,A1YSDK1ZEVMT7U,B002V3HT2G,Aaron M.,"[18, 26]","First we are treated to a 20 minute psych-out as Zombie creates a homage to Rick Rosenthal's original sequel, leading us to think this may be another rehash, but no it's all a dream. Boo.However, you think things might be ok, since Zombie appears to be wanting to go his own way this time and create something original. Unfortunately he has almost nothing original to add.Zombie tries to go artsy with these visitations from Myers dead mother. (glowing white like some sort of angel and being followed about by a white horse) I'm assuming this is just Myers mental state and not a real ghost...since I have no idea why Myers mother would come back and direct her son to kill people...unless Zombie just couldn't help channeling Jason Voorhees once again into this thing. In fact, the more I think about it, the more it seems that Zombie really should have done a Friday the 13th reboot. He seems to love those mother-son/abusive childhood elements.Otherwise he throws in a lot a elements that are cobbed from the various bad sequels: The psychic link between Myers/Laurie (mirroring the psychic link between Myers/Jamie from Halloween V), The bizarre ""vacation"" Myers takes between Halloween holidays (from Halloween IV & V. What is he doing all that time?! Apparently he`s eating dogs all year and no one seems to notice)The one thing Zombie does add that is his own is his treatment of the Dr Loomis character: he destroys it. This more than anything reinforces my belief in Zombie's obsessive love for the Myers character. Zombie is now not just happy with making the original film's villain the hero, but turning Dr Loomis into the films villain! Here, Loomis is just another exploitive, selfish element of the society that Myers rages against. It's no wonder Myers went bad, he didn't even have good doctors treating him. The whole character could have been excised, but I'm assuming Zombie got a thrill out of corrupting the hero.Brad Dourif does a good job as Sheriff Brackett, surprisingly being an authority figure that doesn't seem to represent Evil Society, (breaking from Zombies usual theme) However, rather than representing an oppressive or exploitive authority figure, he actually seems to represent the incompetent authority figure. Of course this all comes crashing down on Brackett's head as his own daughter becomes a victim of Myers, aka Zombie's personification of rage against society. The implication being that if people like Brackett had been able to do their job right, such forces would not be unleashed.As far as the killings go, Zombie indulges in soulless violence. He seems to think that SFX and quick cutting are enough. Simple brutality is supposed to awe us here. What Zombie does not realize is that that era is over. Audiences are so desensitized now that it's not enough. He does not seem to have an inkling that creating a world we can believe in and characters we can care about are how one creates an emotional response.The ending is a convoluted mess I don't feel like explaining in detail...suffice to say that Zombie rips off the ending of Halloween IV. He just takes way more time and tries to cover up the simplistic idiocy of it all with gobs of cryptic nonsense.What are we to make of all this? That Hollywood has given up and decided that fan-fics are the way to go now? How long until some internet goober's Halloween fan-fic porno is considered worthy of a film treatment? Is the film industry really going to stop allowing artists to make films and just allow talent-less panderers hold up a mirror to the audience?",1,Rob Zombie's rambling fan-fic continues...,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,3567,"['First', 'are', 'treated', '20', 'minute', 'psych-out', 'Zombie', 'homage', 'Rick', 'Rosenthal', 'original', 'sequel', 'leading', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'rehash', 'dream', 'Boo.However', 'think', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'ok', 'Zombie', 'be', 'wanting', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'time', 'create', 'something', 'original', 'Unfortunately', 'almost', 'nothing', 'original', 'add.Zombie', 'tries', 'go', 'artsy', 'visitations', 'Myers', 'dead', 'mother', 'glowing', 'white', 'sort', 'angel', 'being', 'followed', 'white', 'horse', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'just', 'Myers', 'mental', 'state', 'not', 'real', 'ghost', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'Myers', 'mother', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'direct', 'son', 'kill', 'people', 'Zombie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'channeling', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'once', 'again', 'thing', 'fact', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'Zombie', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'Friday', '13th', 'reboot', 'love', 'mother-son/abusive', 'childhood', 'elements.Otherwise', 'lot', 'elements', 'are', 'cobbed', 'various', 'bad', 'sequels', 'psychic', 'link', 'Myers/Laurie', 'mirroring', 'psychic', 'link', 'Myers/Jamie', 'Halloween', 'V', 'bizarre', 'vacation', 'Myers', 'Halloween', 'holidays', 'Halloween', 'IV', 'V.', 'What', 'doing', 'time', 'Apparently', 's', 'eating', 'dogs', 'year', 'one', 'notice', 'one', 'thing', 'Zombie', 'add', 'own', 'treatment', 'Dr', 'Loomis', 'character', 'more', 'anything', 'reinforces', 'belief', 'Zombie', 'obsessive', 'love', 'Myers', 'character', 'Zombie', 'now', 'not', 'just', 'happy', 'making', 'original', 'film', 'villain', 'hero', 'turning', 'Dr', 'Loomis', 'films', 'villain', 'Here', 'Loomis', 'just', 'exploitive', 'selfish', 'element', 'society', 'Myers', 'rages', 'wonder', 'Myers', 'went', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'good', 'doctors', 'treating', 'whole', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excised', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Zombie', 'got', 'thrill', 'corrupting', 'hero.Brad', 'Dourif', 'good', 'job', 'Sheriff', 'Brackett', 'surprisingly', 'being', 'authority', 'figure', ""n't"", 'seem', 'represent', 'Evil', 'Society', 'breaking', 'Zombies', 'usual', 'theme', 'However', 'rather', 'representing', 'oppressive', 'exploitive', 'authority', 'figure', 'actually', 'represent', 'incompetent', 'authority', 'figure', 'course', 'crashing', 'down', 'Brackett', 'head', 'own', 'daughter', 'victim', 'Myers', 'Zombie', 'personification', 'rage', 'society', 'implication', 'being', 'people', 'Brackett', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'job', 'right', 'such', 'forces', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'unleashed.As', 'far', 'killings', 'go', 'Zombie', 'soulless', 'violence', 'think', 'SFX', 'quick', 'cutting', 'are', 'enough', 'Simple', 'brutality', 'supposed', 'awe', 'here', 'What', 'Zombie', 'not', 'realize', 'era', 'Audiences', 'are', 'so', 'desensitized', 'now', 'not', 'enough', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'inkling', 'creating', 'world', 'can', 'believe', 'characters', 'can', 'care', 'about', 'are', 'how', 'one', 'emotional', 'response.The', 'ending', 'convoluted', 'mess', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'explaining', 'detail', 'suffice', 'say', 'Zombie', 'ending', 'Halloween', 'IV', 'just', 'way', 'more', 'time', 'tries', 'cover', 'up', 'simplistic', 'idiocy', 'gobs', 'cryptic', 'nonsense.What', 'are', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'given', 'up', 'decided', 'fan-fics', 'are', 'way', 'go', 'now', 'How', 'long', 'internet', 'goober', 'Halloween', 'fan-fic', 'porno', 'considered', 'worthy', 'film', 'treatment', 'film', 'industry', 'really', 'going', 'stop', 'allowing', 'artists', 'make', 'films', 'just', 'allow', 'talent-less', 'panderers', 'hold', 'up', 'mirror', 'audience']",N/A

1291156,AKT39LK1YS658,B002V3HT2G,A. marrero,"[3, 8]","Wow! Let me begin by saying that I would rate the original Halloween 1 and 2 a four. I would rate Halloween 1- Rob Zombie remake a 2.5 if possible but since it isn't I believe I rated it a 3. However, this movie- OMG. Where to begin? Didn't Dr. Loomis die in the first movie of the remake? I think he did but he is alive and very greedy in this one. He also portrays very little moral. Laurie is just a nut- a girl with way too many psycho episodes and with too many anxiety and anger issues- sweet, depressed, reliable Laurie Stroude she is not. Micheal, well he talks and makes noises. He also walks around without a mask and we see his whole face and wow it has way too much facial hair! Then there is this whole issue with visions that Micheal has and dreams that Laurie does (acted mostly by Zombies wife I hear) that really don't make sense- they simply don't fit. They just make the film seem odd. The timing in the movie is off- the first remake seemed to be made modern day, this remake who knows. The TV's are turn dials and black and white, yet there are cars from the 90's and there is rock parapanalia (spelling?) all over the place that make me think of the late 90's. Also, Zombie seems to have taken parts of other Halloween sequels and used them in this part- yawn. In addition, I don't know if some parts were meant to be funny but if they were they fell flat. As for what was wrong with the first remake, that continues to be wrong here, there is entirely too much trash going on. This is not the middle class suburb that John Carpenter portrayed in his movies. These characters are very much working class and at the same time lacking class. The characters cuss all too much and without good reason alot of the time, just for the sake of it seems. This movie tries to go into Micheals Psychi (spelling?) making him human but just crazy rather than the simple he's just a psychopath. There is no suspense just kill, kill. Oh and no joke her- Micheal kills and eats a dog (a twist but really unnecessary.)

Catton ""Andrew Catton""","[0, 1]","Spoilers: Not since Alien 3 have we been treated to a downbeat slice and dice story where the heroine degenerates deeply into hopelessness. In Alien 3, Ripley was able to commit self sacrifice at the end, but in Halloween II, Laurie is driven farther into madness by the memory of what happened to her two years earlier, as well as the sudden appearance of &#34;ghost&#34; visions of her birth mother and of Michael as a child without the chance to do anything about it or help others. Laurie is shredded, emotionally, throughout this film, and left with nothing but her final vision of her mother coming to her as she dies. The film is a mixture of intense violence, psychological distress, building anticipation, and questions of sanity connecting Michael and Laurie. We get the treatment of the hospital from the 1981 Halloween II, but this is just a dream to set up Laurie's trauma that plays out as she uncovers who she really is and what that means. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis, rich and capitalizing on the deaths in Haddonfield two years prior, is forced to look at what his fame has done to others, and he must make the choice to stay out or do something. Surreal images juxtaposed against graphically violent ones make for an interesting and emotional viewing experience. Don't be fooled by those who claim there is no plot or nothing original. This Laurie Strode collapses into emotional problems years before Jamie Lee Curtis' character succumbed in Halloween: Resurrection (2002).

I guess it's that horror-fan philosophy that you have to watch a lot of crap for those rare diamonds that sometimes filter through. I am not a fan of remakes...but I do run across one occasionally that takes me down a new path or makes me think of old faves in a way that I didn't before...and I'm thankful for those bright spots.Rob Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" took me down an unfamiliar path all right, but instead of finding new thoughts or wrinkles, I instead wound up lost and disappointed.That said, I realize that there's a whole new generation of horror fans that DIDN'T grow up watching what I consider classics, and for that reason they see these ""imaginings"" with fresh eyes and minds grown in a different time...so I'm going to try to give my opinion of this film bearing those facts in mind, and be objective and honest.No promises except for the honesty, though.Trying to maintain my policy of staying spoiler-free, I can only say that I neither felt I knew (since these are time-honored roles) nor cared about any character in this film other than Annie Brackett, her father the sheriff, and the father of Lynda at a book-signing scene.

Sure, there was the occasional 'voice-of-reason' amidst the entropic nihilism, but overall every person is a deplorable example of humanity, at least the way my old-fashioned senses like to think it is.Be advised, the following COULD give some things away...impossible to review this without pointing some things out:Would it have been wrong to have a real hero in this film?  Are the original concepts of Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode so outdated as it's important for us to see them as respectively a greedy, morally-ambiguous opportunist or a prescription drug addled, foul-mouthed, semi-goth burnout?Maybe so.  The possibility exists that I just don't get it.I can understand the illustration of how her experiences might have royally screwed Laurie up psychologically...I can take that.  I can see the realism depicted in Loomis...but sometimes, I think what a lot of us like in a horror film is to see good actually standing up to evil...at least in the ""Halloween"" mythology.  I've read the theory that this whole film is merely a psychotic delusion of Laurie as she sits institutionalized after her experience...that would explain much, although this is never really clear...it would at least give us a reason as to how Michael took a magnum round to the face from a foot away and survived...but overall the depiction, whether this theory is true or not, is confusing on the screen.Perhaps Zombie wants to show the world as full of amoral, misanthropic, low-life rednecks who can't see beyond the end of their noses, and have only the f-bomb and a short assortment of nouns in their vocabularies...maybe he is trying to get us to recognize this; that the real horror is US...but for me, give me SOME light in the darkness, even if it loses in the end.  For me to have found some merit in his original crack at the ""Halloween"" story, Rob has really left me scratching my head over this defeatist and hopeless flick.As for the film itself, taking out the thematic elements, it was well done.  The cinematography was excellent, the imagery and editing was otherworldly and fearsome in it's presentation, and the acting, for the material they had to work with, was very good.  Brad Dourif was emotional and excellent, Malcolm MacDowell was his usual pristine self, and Danielle Harris was wonderful.  It was also good to see some old favorites on the screen again...Margot Kidder and Caroline Williams, albeit in small parts, as well as a plethora of familiar character actors.  The special effects were brutal and raw, and hat's off to the artists who created them.I can't really say I didn't like the movie; it had all of the things that I've mentioned that to me make a good film; I guess since it treads so heavily on a mythos I'm a huge fan of, I'm just not willing to buy into the bleak view it reflects as to how times have changed.Had this been a stand-alone, original film, I'm sure I would have thought more highly of it; but riding the coattails of what is horror-movie legend, this revisionist take just left me feeling depressed.2.5 stars for the imagery and acting skill shown.",3,Trying To Be Fair...,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,4438,"['know', 'often', 'ask', 'why', 'keep', 'watching', 're-imaginings', 'as', 'much', 'typically', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'guess', 'horror-fan', 'philosophy', 'have', 'watch', 'lot', 'crap', 'rare', 'diamonds', 'sometimes', 'filter', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'remakes', 'do', 'run', 'one', 'occasionally', 'down', 'new', 'path', 'think', 'old', 'faves', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'thankful', 'bright', 'spots.Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', '2', 'took', 'down', 'unfamiliar', 'path', 'right', 'instead', 'finding', 'new', 'thoughts', 'wrinkles', 'instead', 'wound', 'up', 'lost', 'disappointed.That', 'said', 'realize', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'horror', 'fans', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'grow', 'up', 'watching', 'what', 'consider', 'classics', 'reason', 'see', 'imaginings', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'minds', 'grown', 'different', 'time', 'so', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'give', 'opinion', 'film', 'bearing', 'facts', 'mind', 'be', 'objective', 'honest.No', 'promises', 'honesty', 'though.Trying', 'maintain', 'policy', 'staying', 'spoiler-free', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'neither', 'felt', 'knew', 'are', 'time-honored', 'roles', 'cared', 'character', 'film', 'other', 'Annie', 'Brackett', 'father', 'sheriff', 'father', 'Lynda', 'book-signing', 'scene', 'Everyone', 'else', 'depicted', 'was', 'rather', 'loathsome', 'morally-decrepit', 'just', 'plain', 'sickening', 'Sure', 'was', 'occasional', ""'voice-of-reason"", 'amidst', 'entropic', 'nihilism', 'overall', 'person', 'deplorable', 'example', 'humanity', 'least', 'way', 'old-fashioned', 'senses', 'think', 'is.Be', 'advised', 'following', 'COULD', 'give', 'things', 'away', 'impossible', 'review', 'pointing', 'things', 'out', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'have', 'real', 'hero', 'film', 'Are', 'original', 'concepts', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'so', 'outdated', 'important', 'see', 'respectively', 'greedy', 'morally-ambiguous', 'opportunist', 'prescription', 'drug', 'addled', 'foul-mouthed', 'semi-goth', 'burnout', 'Maybe', 'so', 'possibility', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.I', 'can', 'understand', 'illustration', 'how', 'experiences', 'might', 'have', 'royally', 'screwed', 'Laurie', 'up', 'psychologically', 'can', 'take', 'can', 'see', 'realism', 'depicted', 'Loomis', 'sometimes', 'think', 'what', 'lot', 'horror', 'film', 'see', 'good', 'actually', 'standing', 'up', 'evil', 'least', 'Halloween', 'mythology', ""'ve"", 'read', 'theory', 'whole', 'film', 'merely', 'psychotic', 'delusion', 'Laurie', 'institutionalized', 'experience', 'would', 'explain', 'much', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'would', 'least', 'give', 'reason', 'how', 'Michael', 'took', 'magnum', 'round', 'face', 'foot', 'away', 'survived', 'depiction', 'theory', 'true', 'not', 'confusing', 'screen.Perhaps', 'Zombie', 'show', 'world', 'full', 'amoral', 'misanthropic', 'low-life', 'rednecks', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'end', 'noses', 'have', 'only', 'f-bomb', 'short', 'assortment', 'nouns', 'vocabularies', 'maybe', 'trying', 'get', 'recognize', 'real', 'horror', 'US', 'give', 'SOME', 'light', 'darkness', 'even', 'end', 'have', 'found', 'merit', 'original', 'crack', 'Halloween', 'story', 'Rob', 'really', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'defeatist', 'hopeless', 'flick.As', 'film', 'taking', 'out', 'thematic', 'elements', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'imagery', 'editing', 'was', 'otherworldly', 'fearsome', 'presentation', 'acting', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'was', 'emotional', 'excellent', 'Malcolm', 'MacDowell', 'was', 'usual', 'pristine', 'self', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'was', 'wonderful', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'old', 'favorites', 'screen', 'again', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'Caroline', 'Williams', 'albeit', 'small', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'plethora', 'familiar', 'character', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'brutal', 'raw', 'artists', 'who', 'created', 'them.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'had', 'things', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'guess', 'so', 'heavily', 'mythos', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'willing', 'buy', 'bleak', 'view', 'how', 'times', 'have', 'changed.Had', 'been', 'stand-alone', 'original', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'more', 'highly', 'riding', 'coattails', 'what', 'horror-movie', 'legend', 'revisionist', 'take', 'just', 'left', 'feeling', 'depressed.2.5', 'stars', 'imagery', 'acting', 'skill', 'shown']",N/A

I was thoroughly disappointed.  Zombie clearly has changed the story, and it seems to me the only reason for that is to have his wife in the movie.  Because of the way his remake of Part 1 last year ended, ""Michael Meyers"" mom, Zombie's wife, shows up in dream sequences and ghostly apparitions to tell the now grown ""Michael Meyers"" to kill people.  He also has turned Dr. Loomis into a greedy apathetic character.  As we know in the original series, Dr. Loomis seemed to alway show up and try to help others and stop ""Michael"".  Rob Zombie, as with most of his movies, made this remake extremely bloody and as weird as this sounds, extremely violent.  What I mean by that is when ""Michael"" kills people you can almost feel the anger in which he's doing it come across the screen.  You also can see the over-kill...no pun intended.

1291165,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B002V3HT2G,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[6, 9]","Just like with Rob Zombie's 2007 re-make, my mind is racing with thoughts, feelings, and a sense of not exactly knowing what to say. Like many, I was horrified and disgusted when I heard that this classic was being re-made in the first place. Rob's re-make was far from great, littered with flaws and things I didn't like, would never of wanted for Michael Myers or a Halloween movie, but I actually kinda liked it. When the sequel came along, I was hesitant. This wasn't going to be a Halloween movie, but a full on Rob Zombie movie. And that's exactly what we got.The plot, such as it is, picks up exactly after the last film's final moments. It's these first 15 minutes or so that are the best part of the entire movie. It's also a cheat. We pick up 2 years later and re-connect with Laurie Strode(Scout Taylor-Compton), who is living with the Bracketts(Sheriff and Annie), and is a total, goth, rock and roll chick who is barely hanging on. This is not Laurie from the first film. Meanwhile, Michael is living the hobo life(and looking like it), having artsy fartsy visions of his mother with her white horse, and decides to come looking for Laurie again. Oh, and Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell)is a demanding diva, treated like a rock star, and on a book tour. More on that in a minute.Where to start?. The problems with the re-make are still very much evident here. The horrendous dialogue, constant swearing(I'm no prude, but the ""F"" word coming out of everyone's mouth every 2 seconds gets old very fast and becomes pathetic), greasy, trashy, hillbilly people, slutty girls, and more of the backstory that tries, along with the visions, to ""humanize"" Michael, which was a huge mistake in the first, and continues that trend here. The movie and the kills are very brutal to the point of being stupid and pointless. Michael just doesn't kill people, he KILLS people. Way, way overdone. Speaking of the kills, they are of the ho-hum, mundane type. Nothing new or creative. Typical, run of the mill stuff that Michael lingers too long on. Some of Laurie's friends didn't have much screen time to get to know them well in the last, and the same is true here, except for Annie. What else?. Dr. Loomis. Malcolm McDowell does a good job, and clearly has fun with the character, but the doctor's characterization here is abominal. This is a Loomis nobody knows, and doesn't want too. Some of his book storyline is interesting, but it all feels disconnected with the rest of the film, and Loomis doesn't even have anything to do with what's going on until the last few minutes. Loomis feels tacked on and serves no real purpose being there. Finally, the visions of his mother and white horse is probably what's going to get a lot of people hating this movie. I really don't care what Michael sees in his head. I don't want to know. I don't want things explained to me. Zombie still doesn't realize that it's the ""unknown"" that makes someone like Michael Myers creepy and scary. It ruins the mystique and creepiness of the whole character. Not knowing who exactly is underneath that mask or why they are doing what they are doing, is what makes it interesting. Tyler Mane is imposing, but he's too big. Michael Myers is not 20 feet tall and built like a mountain. I don't care for the size or crashing thru walls or tossing people around like rag dolls. It's too Jason/Terminator.Is there anything good?. Not much. McDowell has fun, Scout is okay in some scenes, but it's really the Brackett family that hold things together. Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris, returning as the Sheriff and Annie, are the acting standouts here. It's a movie about family, Laurie and Michael's, but the Brackett family are the acting stars here. I already mentioned the first 15 minutes. The best part of the movie. It's the only time the movie is remotely interesting or suspenseful, and the hospital with it's few Halloween decorations has some good atmosphere and tone. That completely vanishes later on.I have nothing against Rob Zombie. He seems like a nice, intelligent guy, and he does have an eye for things, but it's just not computing with the Halloween series or the character of Michael Myers. I understand when he says why do it if it's the same thing?. Do something different. Great, but you can't completely change or remove very vital things and details that have come to make these movies what they are and why fans love them and keep coming back to see them. No Halloween music until the end credits!. It was an interesting experiment, Rob, but I am more than ready now for Michael Myers to be back at being the ultimate, shadowy, elusive boogeyman that scared the daylights out of me. Maybe the already announced ""Halloween 3D"" will do that.Oh, and if you see the Director's Cut, you will bare witness to this Laurie Strode becoming the most annoying, unbearable horror movie heroine I have ever witnessed. You wished Michael finished her off in the opening moments and the heroine of this film was Annie. Just intolerable.""Halloween II"" is no treat.

But then after it was shown to be a dream, the movie went downhill from there.As one of the previous reviewers pointed out the gore was way to distressing. I found it sickening and way to much.The characters turned a new direction. The acting remains the same as the other 2007 Halloween movie - all characters incredibly boring. Laurie Strode was the most irritating character - F this and F that! Constantly screaming!Then there's the worst part of the movie the dreams. The white horse and that annoying woman. I have nothing against the actress whom plays Michael's mum. I am sure she is a nice woman in real life. But to bring her back in this movie was a really desperate move to make. The character and the horse just made no sense to the movie.I am glad that Rob is not making Halloween 3.This movie and the 2007 Halloween movie is the worse out of the whole Halloween series. I thought Halloween Resurrection sucked but is much better compared to this crap and the 2007 Halloween movie.The only good thing about this movie was Nan Vernon's Love Hurts.

I never would have guessed a horror movie that focused around nonstop violence, lots of blood and frequent stabbings would stink as much as it does, but well, it's true!  It's 100% true in fact.  I hated this film.Oh sure, it starts out fine.  A nurse gets stabbed, and a teenage girl runs for her life down a hospital hallway the moment she witnesses a huge figure running towards her with a knife.  Eventually however, the storyline seems to go away completely and turn into a mess of random killings and disjointed storyline segments focusing entirely around this one girl.  The storyline isn't coherent enough and it showed.  People would just appear out of nowhere, and they'd die.  Zero concern for storyline consistency.Plus there was a constant question buzzing inside of my head ""Why am I torturing myself with a low budget horror film?""  The acting, the stabbings and the supposed ""suspense"" were all really predictable and cliched.  The only truly interesting aspect is that people would die while classic rock songs were being played in the background such as 10cc's ""The Things We Do for Love"", the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""What's Your Name?""  That was the only interesting part of the movie- the song selection while death would occur.I highly recommend avoiding this disaster of a horror movie.

I had read the negative reviews and being a long time Halloween fan I was worried this would be another ""Resurrection"" type of failure. But being the Halloween fan I am, I had to check it out regardless. Let me say that on its own it is a pretty decent movie. In my opinion you have to go into it with a blank slate, forget all you remember about the older movies, or this one will frustrate you. I was a little put off by the mask-less, semi-vocal Micheal, and the new actor for young Mike, but it seemed to work for this movie. Parts of this film that I did enjoy were the homage's to the Halloween films of the past. No matter what Rob Zombie has said, the homage's are too apparent to disregard. And Brad Dourif really seemed shine in this one. for me he was the stand out actor of the entire film. Very good job!Overall I'm satisfied with this film. It's not a remake, not a sequel to the old movies, it's a standalone sequel to the 2007 remake (if that makes sense). I am glad I saw the Directors cut first. I hear its the better version. I will eventually check out the theatrical cut, but I'm satisfied with this version so I'm in no hurry to do so. I dont know that I'm ready for the upcoming H-3d,I think it is too soon for another sequel but I will give it a chance like I did this film.

1291172,A11FTNXI6MFIGF,B002V3HT2G,BIG T,"[3, 4]","Well, to start things off, I was really looking foward to this movie. Considering that Zombie just ruined the whole point of remakes. I actually enjoyed the first Halloween remake, but this movie just tanked everything.We see at the beginning of the movie. Michael as a child and his mom in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he was put after killing his sister. But he was given a white horse to reprsent his mom. But, about a minuet or so later, we see that Laurie is walking down the street absoltely covered in blood, and once Sheriff Brackett pulls over and ask's her what happeneed, she starts saying, ""I killed him,"" about four or five times. So of course, she is taken to a hospital, and so is Michael, but a crash along the way awakens him, and he kills the paramedic with a shard of glass. But, we see along the way, Laurie getting a imediate surgery, and put in a hospital bed. While finding the nurse, we see her walk out of a room and her chest is bloody, screaming and Laurie trying to run, we see Michael walk out of the room, and stab the nurse to death. Laurie, outisde, goes and hides in the gate keepers office type of thing, and he is killed with a random Ax that Michael has found, Michael knows that Laurie is in the small building because none of the windows are open, so busting down the wall, getting ready to kill her, Laurie wakes up from a serious nightmare.We see the next day, a hooded Michael, and his mom's ghost, staring at a billboard of him as a child. So, the mission is confirmed by ""Mom"", and Michael sets out to find Laurie, killing people such as two trucker's and there daughter along the way, and a owner of a strip bar, his friend, and a stripper, which rips part of his mask off. But, while this is happening, Laurie start's to have horrific hallucinations, seeing Deborah, and a Clown-Faced Michael. Later in the movie, Laurie see's in a book with her friend's, that she is Angle Myers, Michael's long removed sister. Once she find's this out, getting drunk to forget about it, she and her friends Mya and Harley decide to go to a halloween party. But, before Harley is about to get boned by some random dude she met, he's killed by Michael while taking a wiz, and seconds later, Harley is choked to death. Going to the Brackett house, where Annie closes her drug cabnet and see's Michael's reflection. He chases her and stab's her repatedly and carves her, spewing blood everywhere. ""Angle"", and Mya come to Annie's aid when they find her, but she dies in Laurie's lap. Seconds later, you see Michael smashing the door to peices after killing Mya who was on the phone with paramedics. Laurie escapes the house, and pulls over a driver, who of course is killed a couple of seconds later. But michael takes Angle and takes her to a abandon shed. Where her imagination takes over her and a young Michael is holding her down, getting to say ""I love you mommy"". But then, Dr.Loomis comes into the shed, and is screaming and yelling at Laurie that nothing is holding her down. But, Deborah tell's Michael, ""Time to go home,"", and Michael stab's and carves Loomis.Michael doesn't relize that he is in front of a window, and is shot in the arm. Once falling into the sharp equipment. Angle stab's him repeatedly and then takes his mask, and walks outside with it. The movie end's with Laurie being stranded in a all white psychiatric ward.There were deleted scense that just ruined the movie. But, there was a alternate ending, when attacking Loomis, Michael unmask's and is shot to death, and Laurie comes out and has picked up Michael's knife, and then is shot to death.So, overall this movie blow's, and just ruined the whole concept of Halloween. But, they are making a new Halloween movie which will not be directed by Zombie.Overall Rating - 2/5""Michael, your going to hell,""""DIE!""",2,Rob Zombie Strikes Twice,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,3822,"['Well', 'start', 'things', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'foward', 'movie', 'Considering', 'Zombie', 'just', 'ruined', 'whole', 'point', 'remakes', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Halloween', 'remake', 'movie', 'just', 'tanked', 'everything.We', 'see', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Michael', 'child', 'mom', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'Sanitarium', 'where', 'was', 'put', 'killing', 'sister', 'was', 'given', 'white', 'horse', 'reprsent', 'mom', 'minuet', 'so', 'later', 'see', 'Laurie', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'absoltely', 'covered', 'blood', 'once', 'Sheriff', 'Brackett', 'ask', 'what', 'happeneed', 'saying', 'killed', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'course', 'taken', 'hospital', 'so', 'Michael', 'crash', 'way', 'paramedic', 'shard', 'glass', 'see', 'way', 'Laurie', 'getting', 'imediate', 'surgery', 'put', 'hospital', 'bed', 'finding', 'nurse', 'see', 'walk', 'room', 'chest', 'bloody', 'screaming', 'Laurie', 'trying', 'run', 'see', 'Michael', 'walk', 'room', 'stab', 'nurse', 'death', 'Laurie', 'outisde', 'hides', 'gate', 'keepers', 'office', 'type', 'thing', 'killed', 'random', 'Ax', 'Michael', 'found', 'Michael', 'Laurie', 'small', 'building', 'none', 'windows', 'are', 'open', 'busting', 'down', 'wall', 'getting', 'ready', 'kill', 'Laurie', 'up', 'serious', 'nightmare.We', 'see', 'next', 'day', 'hooded', 'Michael', 'mom', 'ghost', 'staring', 'billboard', 'child', 'So', 'mission', 'confirmed', 'Mom', 'Michael', 'out', 'find', 'Laurie', 'killing', 'people', 'such', 'two', 'trucker', 'there', 'daughter', 'way', 'owner', 'strip', 'bar', 'friend', 'stripper', 'part', 'mask', 'happening', 'Laurie', 'start', 'have', 'horrific', 'hallucinations', 'seeing', 'Deborah', 'Clown-Faced', 'Michael', 'Later', 'movie', 'Laurie', 'see', 'book', 'friend', 'Angle', 'Myers', 'Michael', 'long', 'removed', 'sister', 'find', 'out', 'getting', 'drunk', 'forget', 'friends', 'Mya', 'Harley', 'decide', 'go', 'halloween', 'party', 'Harley', 'get', 'boned', 'random', 'dude', 'met', 'killed', 'Michael', 'taking', 'wiz', 'seconds', 'later', 'Harley', 'choked', 'death', 'Going', 'Brackett', 'house', 'where', 'Annie', 'drug', 'cabnet', 'see', 'Michael', 'reflection', 'stab', 'repatedly', 'spewing', 'blood', 'everywhere', 'Angle', 'Mya', 'come', 'Annie', 'aid', 'when', 'find', 'Laurie', 'lap', 'later', 'see', 'Michael', 'smashing', 'door', 'peices', 'killing', 'Mya', 'who', 'was', 'phone', 'paramedics', 'Laurie', 'house', 'over', 'driver', 'who', 'course', 'killed', 'couple', 'seconds', 'later', 'michael', 'Angle', 'abandon', 'shed', 'Where', 'imagination', 'young', 'Michael', 'holding', 'down', 'getting', 'say', 'love', 'mommy', 'then', 'Dr.Loomis', 'shed', 'screaming', 'yelling', 'Laurie', 'nothing', 'holding', 'down', 'Deborah', 'tell', 'Michael', 'Time', 'go', 'home', 'Michael', 'stab', 'Loomis.Michael', ""n't"", 'relize', 'front', 'window', 'shot', 'arm', 'Once', 'falling', 'sharp', 'equipment', 'Angle', 'stab', 'repeatedly', 'then', 'mask', 'walks', 'movie', 'end', 'Laurie', 'being', 'stranded', 'white', 'psychiatric', 'were', 'deleted', 'scense', 'just', 'ruined', 'movie', 'was', 'alternate', 'ending', 'when', 'attacking', 'Loomis', 'Michael', 'unmask', 'shot', 'death', 'Laurie', 'out', 'picked', 'up', 'Michael', 'knife', 'then', 'shot', 'death.So', 'overall', 'movie', 'blow', 'just', 'ruined', 'whole', 'concept', 'Halloween', 'are', 'making', 'new', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'directed', 'Zombie.Overall', 'Rating', '2/5', 'Michael', 'going', 'hell', 'DIE']",N/A

I'd also heard about Scout Taylor-Compton doing a terrible job as Laurie Strode, and her ""foul mouth"", ""whining"", and ""hysterical"" performance. Well, Zombie's version is different, but hardly as bad as it was made out to be! Michael Myers (Tyler Mane)is still the unstoppable killing machine we remember. Yes, he does take off the mask, and he does sport a raggedy beard. So what? I'd read how he looked ""homeless"", like a ""hobo"" Michael. I expected a real clown! Instead, he's even fiercer than he was in RZ's first HALLOWEEN! People complained that he ""grunted"" when he killed his victims. Again, so what? Mane is imposing and terrifying here, especially when he dispatches those hillbillies on the farm! Oh my! The only complaint I can agree w/ is the heavy-handed use of the horse imagery.

1291174,A36WKUBGCQRV3P,B002V3HT2G,Blackout,"[3, 6]","I absolutely loved Zombie's remake of Halloween, it is one of my favorite movies. That being said I'm here to review halloween II, which was nothing at all like the first one.1. Michael Meyers doesn't wear a mask for about 75% of the movie, and looks dirty and disgusting. Everyone in this movie was dirty, like characters in the other R Zombie films.2. Dream sequences-about 50% of the movie is dream sequences and useless ones. Not only are there dream sequences, but then out of the blue they'll show Michael's mom and little michael just standing in a hallway.....what purpose that serves? Couldn't tell you. Also some of these weirdo sequences take place in a dirty carnival looking enviornment just like the other R Zombie films. The white horse made no sense as well.3. Michael Meyers eats animals......a dog specifically. I've heard that in the original Halloween II, he did eat a dog as well, but it was more subtle. Also I hear he did eat a guy in the bathroom, which wouldn't surprise me, but I must have missed that part. (and i refuse to watch this movie again)4. Laurie Strode-what to say about her? She was screaming so much in this movie before Michael even chased her down. All she did was scream obscenities the entire film, also she looked dirty and smelly as well. And she has turned into a whiny freak, granted if i went through what she did, i probably would be too, but wow. Just shows how much Zombie is changing the original characters.5. They used a different child actor to play little Michael....why? It couldn't have been more that two years, i'm sure the kid from halloween wasn't that old yet, and he was much creepier than the cutie in this movie.6. Sam Loomis is like a totally different character altogether. Arrogant, sarcastic, and cared about no one but himself. Completely unlikeable.7. No plotline whatsoever, i realize its halloween and michael meyers comes back to kill on halloween. But all it is, is a bunch of scenes that were just thrown together that really make very little sense. The first 30 minutes was the best of the movie.To summarize-This movie was def along the lines of Devil's Rejects 2 and House of 1000 Corpses, which by no means are bad movies. But all Zombie did was steal the name Halloween and paste it on this creation. If it was labeled something else, it may have actually been a pretty decent movie.

1291177,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B002V3HT2G,Brian,"[0, 0]","I have never minced words to anybody who asks about my feelings whenever Rob Zombie's original ""Halloween"" is mentioned.I actually liked his first film; I think he gave what many considered to be a struggling slasher franchise a much-needed and long-overdue shot in the arm.With this one, however, I think he dropped the ball and it would seem I'm not the only fan who holds such sentiment. The opening minutes, which ironically pays strong tribute to Rick Rosenthal's ""Halloween"" sequel, are absolutely brilliant. Sheriff Brackett finds Laurie, caked in blood and shambling down the middle of a neighborhood street in petrified shock---one can assume only mere moments after shooting Michael squarely in the face. The next time we see her, she's having the many wounds she received at Michael's hands cleaned up and stitched at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. Her friend, Annie, played once again by Danielle Harris, is convalescing in another room down the hall. All seems perfectly fine, as it should be. That is until Michael, upon awakening in a coroner's wagon, shows up....primed and ready to finish what he started. At this point early on in the movie, I was excited. All the memories of Rosenthal's ""Halloween 2"" came flooding back to me in virtual waves. It was only after what began as a heart-pounding chase from the hospital and into the pounding rain outside that Rob Zombie suddenly decided to shift gears and throw a major monkey wrench into the proceedings.You see, after all this chaos, Laurie wakes up in bed safe and unharmed.Yeah.Those delicious, beautifully-crafted opening few scenes were nothing but a dream! And that is only the merest tip of where my disappointment in this movie stems. Zombie, who was given free reign to distance himself as far as he felt was needed from John Carpenter's universe of characters and story structure, took what could have been a truly effective follow-up to his own remake and steered it down a path most fans were not expecting and obviously did not appreciate. Apart from turning Michael into a Jason Voorhees clone with a Grizzly Adams beard, who in this film now seemingly bases his entire urge to kill around messed-up visions of his mother and a white horse, he has also committed the unthinkable blasphemy by transforming Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis into a money-hungry media whore! Loomis has apparently written a tell-all book, documenting Michael's prior rampages at what can only be seen as the shrewd and unforgivable expense of his victims and their families. This, as any one who has followed this series will tell you, is NOT how Dr. Samuel Loomis represents himself.But, still, that only encompasses everything I didn't like about this movie.What I DID like deserves it's own seperate analysis here. I liked the therapy sessions Laurie participated in with her counselor; a surprising cameo by Margot Kidder, by the way. Those scenes, even if they did consist of some rather ceaseless and unnecessary profanity by Laurie, were honest and effective. Conversely, even though I outwardly despised what Zombie had done with the Loomis character, I was also quite taken by the manner in which Laurie discovers her genetic tie with Michael. She reads about it in the good doctor's newest book. That was, admittedly, a very emotional scene. Brad Dourif's second turn as Sheriff Brackett was another positive standout for me. His scenes helped in keeping my interest grounded, especially towards the end when he finally confronts Loomis in a mad rage over everything that's transpired.This was, as Zombie admitted, a movie he made to close out the story he kick-started within his first film. Anyone else who has seen it will probably come away believing him.I didn't hate the film, in general, I was just disappointed. Very disappointed. But I still went ahead and bought the DVD, based mostly on the few good things I felt the script had going for it; basically everything I liked, as outlined above.That may not be the case for whoever else decides to give this a watch. As I always try to do when it comes to movies, I simply advise any fan reading this to rent the film for themselves and make up their own minds.",2,This one missed the mark,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,4187,"['have', 'never', 'minced', 'words', 'anybody', 'who', 'feelings', 'whenever', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'original', 'Halloween', 'mentioned.I', 'actually', 'liked', 'first', 'film', 'think', 'gave', 'what', 'many', 'considered', 'be', 'struggling', 'slasher', 'franchise', 'much-needed', 'long-overdue', 'shot', 'arm.With', 'one', 'however', 'think', 'dropped', 'ball', 'would', 'seem', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'fan', 'who', 'such', 'sentiment', 'opening', 'minutes', 'ironically', 'strong', 'tribute', 'Rick', 'Rosenthal', 'Halloween', 'sequel', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Sheriff', 'Brackett', 'Laurie', 'caked', 'blood', 'shambling', 'down', 'middle', 'neighborhood', 'street', 'petrified', 'shock', '-one', 'can', 'assume', 'only', 'mere', 'moments', 'shooting', 'Michael', 'squarely', 'face', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'having', 'many', 'wounds', 'received', 'Michael', 'hands', 'cleaned', 'up', 'stitched', 'Haddonfield', 'Memorial', 'Hospital', 'friend', 'Annie', 'played', 'once', 'again', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'convalescing', 'room', 'down', 'hall', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'should', 'be', 'Michael', 'awakening', 'coroner', 'wagon', 'up', '.primed', 'ready', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'point', 'early', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'memories', 'Rosenthal', 'Halloween', '2', 'came', 'flooding', 'back', 'virtual', 'waves', 'was', 'only', 'what', 'began', 'heart-pounding', 'chase', 'hospital', 'pounding', 'rain', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'suddenly', 'decided', 'shift', 'gears', 'throw', 'major', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'proceedings.You', 'see', 'chaos', 'Laurie', 'up', 'bed', 'safe', 'unharmed.Yeah.Those', 'delicious', 'beautifully-crafted', 'opening', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'nothing', 'dream', 'only', 'merest', 'tip', 'where', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'Zombie', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'free', 'reign', 'distance', 'as', 'far', 'felt', 'was', 'needed', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'universe', 'characters', 'story', 'structure', 'took', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'effective', 'follow-up', 'own', 'remake', 'steered', 'down', 'path', 'most', 'fans', 'were', 'not', 'expecting', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Apart', 'turning', 'Michael', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'clone', 'Grizzly', 'Adams', 'beard', 'who', 'film', 'now', 'seemingly', 'entire', 'urge', 'kill', 'around', 'messed-up', 'visions', 'mother', 'white', 'horse', 'also', 'committed', 'unthinkable', 'blasphemy', 'transforming', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'money-hungry', 'media', 'whore', 'Loomis', 'apparently', 'written', 'tell-all', 'book', 'documenting', 'Michael', 'prior', 'rampages', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'shrewd', 'unforgivable', 'expense', 'victims', 'families', 'one', 'who', 'followed', 'series', 'will', 'tell', 'NOT', 'how', 'Dr.', 'Samuel', 'Loomis', 'himself.But', 'still', 'only', 'everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie.What', 'DID', 'deserves', 'own', 'seperate', 'analysis', 'here', 'liked', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'Laurie', 'participated', 'counselor', 'surprising', 'cameo', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'way', 'scenes', 'even', 'did', 'consist', 'rather', 'ceaseless', 'unnecessary', 'profanity', 'Laurie', 'were', 'honest', 'effective', 'Conversely', 'even', 'outwardly', 'despised', 'what', 'Zombie', 'had', 'done', 'Loomis', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'taken', 'manner', 'Laurie', 'genetic', 'tie', 'Michael', 'good', 'doctor', 'newest', 'book', 'was', 'admittedly', 'very', 'emotional', 'scene', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'second', 'turn', 'Sheriff', 'Brackett', 'was', 'positive', 'standout', 'scenes', 'helped', 'keeping', 'interest', 'grounded', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'finally', 'Loomis', 'mad', 'rage', 'everything', 'transpired.This', 'was', 'Zombie', 'admitted', 'movie', 'made', 'close', 'out', 'story', 'kick-started', 'first', 'film', 'Anyone', 'else', 'who', 'seen', 'will', 'probably', 'come', 'away', 'believing', 'him.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'general', 'was', 'just', 'disappointed', 'Very', 'disappointed', 'still', 'went', 'ahead', 'bought', 'DVD', 'based', 'mostly', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'felt', 'script', 'had', 'going', 'basically', 'everything', 'liked', 'outlined', 'above.That', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'whoever', 'else', 'give', 'watch', 'always', 'try', 'do', 'when', 'movies', 'simply', 'advise', 'fan', 'reading', 'rent', 'film', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds']",N/A

What I am not a big fan of is re-makes (Or even &#34;Re-Boots&#34;  as the industry has tried to change it).  I thought the first Halloween re-make was decent.  And I really enjoyed Rob Zombie's other films like The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, House of 1000 Corpses, & Lords of salem.  But the Halloween II Re-Make lacked ALOT.I think Zombie made an admirable attempt in trying to create a new &#34;Vision&#34; with this film.  But in the end he just fell short.  I mean, there was no &#34;Revelation&#34; that the heroine was Myers sister like we did in the original, we knew it from the first one.  We get no supernatural scare like we did in the original either.  The Closest we come to it is Michael & His sister's &#34;Shared&#34; Hallucination of their mother.  There was to much blood.  And it lacked the scare the original Halloween II but it instead it traded brutality.What I did like about it was Malcom McDowel as Loomis.

1291179,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B002V3HT2G,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[4, 8]","Rating: +4Surely purists of the original Halloween will undoubtedly keep the flame burning by trashing Zombie's latest horror flick. Either that or they will just sit this one out to wait for the Redbox rental & Netflix. In my honest opinion, I'd much rather be stabbed to death by Michael Myers himself than to sit through another one of those inane sequels to the original Carpenter flick. In fact, I'm kinda disappointed that no one acknowledges let alone admit that Zombie is actually breathing life into the lackluster horror genre. Obviously, Rob has stolen the crown of bloody horror from Bava, Franco, & I daresay even Argento. Eli Roth, eat your heart out dude! All hail the new King of mainstream horror & his name is Rob Zombie!In the very first montage, we see a young Myers visited by his mother (played by Zombie's beloved wife) where he explains that his dreams of one day reuniting with the family. His mother then gives him a white horse toy as a gift & tells him to think of her whenever he plays with the horse. Michael hates nearly everyone in the world but he loves mommy & misses her more than life itself. Viewers can't help but feel a tad bit sorry for the tike in Zombie's reboot of the original & the sequel.The film cuts to a dark yet colorful street where bloodied Laurie Strode is walking home. After being located by a police car, she is taken to a nearby hospital where she's treated & learns that her best friend Annie is still alive but in critical condition. After being told to vacate the ICU room & to return to her own room, Laurie realizes she is not strong enough to make it back down the hallway & calls for help. Quickly, our heroine realizes she's not alone & that Michael is in the hospital terrorizing the nurses. It's time to escape once again & the nightmare doesn't seem to be over. Not yet, at least.Laurie wakes up screaming in her bed & realizes the hospital massacre was just a nasty dream, it's almost a year later after the events that took place in Haddonfield & Laurie is now living with Annie & her dad (played by the very underrated Brad Dourif) in the countryside. She's taking baby steps to rid herself of the traumatic experiences by visiting a shrink (Margot Kidder) who encourages her to face the demon & try to realize why these nightmares actually exist. Although Laurie would rather put all this out of her mind, she knows Halloween is just around the corner & dreaded memories are fairly easy to recall. What she doesn't realize is that family will be dropping in real soon.H2 picks up right after Zombie's remake of the original took place & things are about to take a turn for the bloody worst if one can fathom such. Michael Myers' dead body was never found on that night of the Halloween massacre even though Laurie Strode tries to tell herself repeatedly that she killed the man in the mask. Sadly, Laurie can't seem to completely get on with her life & the recurring nightmares of that night. In fact, she even fears that homicidal tendencies may very well run in her blood although she still has no idea who her real family is. She's about to find out rather quickly who brother dearest is & that family is forever whether she likes it or not.Dr. Loomis (played by magnificent Malcolm McDowell) on the other hand seems to be doing exceptionally well profiteering off the innocent lives of families who lost their loved ones by writing a novel which gives specifics to the origins of Michael Myers. Loomis even goes so far as to give details of Laurie's Strode's origins including her birth name & whereabouts as well. To further exploit the entire brutal massacre, his publishers insists on releasing the book on none other than Halloween. Fame & fortune seem to have smiled on our greedy Dr. Loomis & he's now a national celebrity to be seen everywhere including on a talk show with special guest Weird Al Yankovic.Zombie obviously has a knack for creating some of the violent if not sickening images ever put on the mainstream circuit & we really should praise the man for actually getting away with it. There is a rather intense scene near the beginning of the film where two coroners discuss necrophilia before crashing head-on into a vehicle on the country road in what may very well be the most ugly car crash I've ever witnessed in a horror flick. One of the latter montages finds Myers crushing a man's face with his foot which could very be a homage to Gaspar Noe's scene in the notorious film Irreversible where a man's face is smashed with a fire extinguisher. In another graphic scene, Michael stabs a nurse repeatedly to a bloody pulp which could've very well earned the film a solid NC-17 rating. Even more sickening, our villain kills a dog on a prairie & proceeds to gutting the poor animal before eating it in gruesome detail. Thus, Zombie is one of the few directors who can envision some of the most mortifying imagery ever & still manage to find a home in your local multiplexes.Above all else, Zombie has created some of the most unique if not artistic dream sequences I've seen in a long time which are unlike anything you will find in a typical slasher film. I can already hear the comparisons to Tim Burton (or even veterans like David Lynch come to mind) but I'd almost be willing to purchase this film on DVD for these sequences alone & I'd even be willing to bet many viewers would re-think their own judgment of Zombie if they were to check out these fantastic images. If Michael Myers has dreams like this, I'm truly envious. Kudos to Zombie!In addition to making a film which should be cherished by slasher film aficionados everywhere worldwide, Zombie proves once again he can write some very intelligent dialog when he's not dropping the infamous f-bomb. (As with any film he makes, the language is extremely coarse & the dude clearly has no intention of mincing his words.) As with any sequel or reboot, try to watch this film for what it is instead of bashing it for not being an exact replica of the Carpenter classic. Personally,  I believe H2 could have very well been his opus had he just spent a bit more time with it although this is still one of the best horror offerings you are going to find & I would gladly take this any day over the unnecessary remakes we've seen all year long like Friday The 13Th for example. If Zombie isn't your thing, there's still plenty of crap-tastic PG-13 entertainment at your local cinema to make up for H2.",4,Day of the Devil,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,6454,"['Rating',

After the Rob Zombie remake i thought they have a guy who cares about the franchise and will make them ""scary"" again as the first one was. This garbage is not! Why is Rob Zombie's wife in every one of his movies? Anyway the problem i have is Laurie isnt even a likable character. Also neither is Dr. Loomis. In the original you got behind the 2 main characters almost rooting for them. In this one i found myself WANTING Michael Myers to KILL them!! The characters are horrible, foul mouthed people, with Laurie being a promiscuous woman(or so i thought). Jamie Lee played the part the way it should be-the virginal good kid. Dont they know the rules(thanks Scream!)

Now Rob's remake of the first Halloween was pretty good. Much, much different then the orignal but was still a good movie.  Rob made Myers more human and more savage.Now to the remake of the second Halloween.  Well I truly do not know where to begin. Well let start with the good points.1) The voilence- it is truly stepped up a notch here.  Not gore but the violence. Itreally seemed to fit this Myers.  He is no longer thisboogieman type character but a sadistic brutal killer.2) Myers - Though I still like the original better this one is still great.  He'sdifferent.  Most will either love him or hate him not to many in themiddle.3) Dreams - We got to see what was driving Myers, what was going on in his head.Now what was bad1)Dr. Loomis -  Man does this Loomis really suck.  I mean the original really  helped make the movies. With out him the movie would have weakened greatly.  This Loomis nearly destroy's the movie.2) Dreams - I can't really go into this to much without giving some things up but lets just say there to many of them and they should have been limited to Myers.All in all I would like to have given 2 1/2 stars.  I think it would not be out of the question to give it a 3 star but that would be stretching it.

1291183,AMYWL00JMEZXA,B002V3HT2G,bugman,"[2, 3]","*****SPOILERS*****so, halloween 2, as directed by rob zombie:honestly, i loathed rob's first halloween. i thought it was boring, needlessly violent, and a generally uneven attempt to pay homage to carpenter's, while adding his own, new material. but i love rob's other flicks and his music, so i gave halloween 2 a whirl and loved it. i couldn't stop thinking about it. it unsettled me, it excited me, it made me wonder why i like horror movies in the first place.from the opening scene of laurie wandering bloody through the streets, i was hooked. her hospital scenes are excruciating. as we bleed into her normal routine later on, her emotional distress felt very real and believable to me. i enjoyed seeing the family that she, annie and the sheriff forged from tragedy and horror. i found her visitations to margot kidder to be illuminating and interesting.watching michael drift across the country side reminds me of shelley's frankenstein's monster. like the monster, michael is attempting to find himself, figure out his purpose, and act on it. to do this, reuniting his family seems the best option, and he acts on it. i also found many of these scenes beautiful, wonderfully, sumptuously shot. the night shots were especially effective, shrouded in dark blue, but clear and discernible.loomis' character in halloween 2 seems to generate the most criticism of anything, so attached to donald pleasance's brilliant portrayal of sam loomis most people seem to be, but i like this about the movie. the characters are carpenter's in name and position only; in terms of behavior and personality, they are all zombie's. this doesn't bother me, as i knew i wasn't seeing carpenter's movie (or rick rosenthal's, in the instance of the original halloween 2). i like the friction it creates in my brain to see characters i have long thought of in one way, presented in a different, oppositional light. i mean, why not explore all possibilities. genre fiction has long explored the doppelganger; everything, star trek, superman, bewitched, stephen king, whatever, has explored the notion of a dark half. is sam loomis so sacred? and in the end, he realizes his mistake--his self-absorption and aggrandizement--and does what he can to make things right.i love the vibe of this movie. rob gets a lot of grief for his ""white-trash"" sensibilities, but i like it. i like captain clegg. i like all the supporting characters that show up. i like the country-fried feel of this movie.the savage nature of the violence deeply affected me. on the one hand, it was horrifying and forceful, on the other, gratifying to see the anarchistic way that rob views human life. i find this chilling. i also thought annie's death, though horrible and raw, was thoughtful and beautiful. all the friction between her and laurie made her death matter when it happened. it was deeply moving, and showed me that rob can maintain a gentle hand, even when depicting horrible violence.additionally, the make-ups, by wayne toth, also deserve props. the opening scenes, especially of laurie's hand, i found to be very convincing. i also love the set design. each space, each room, is gloriously trashy. halloween 2 is totally punk rock.and while it may have been a tad obvious and seemingly out of step thematically with the rest of the movie, i think the whole white horse stuff added a nice touch of fantasy to the movie. who says you can't dramatically juxtapose images? frankly, i find it rather daring of rob, and it was a much more effective and interesting exploration of inner michael than the first films dysfunctional-by-the-numbers family portrait. and look, honestly, the white horse connected this movie to two other movies i adore--blade runner and (to a lesser degree) legend.halloween 2 is about family, ultimately, about michael's attempts to make sense of his life and reconstruct his family (albeit with a knife) the only way he knows how. similarly, michael's actions in the first movie have forced laurie, annie, and the sheriff to forge a necessary family out of each other. family drives this movie, which is all the more awesome, considering what a brutal, rockabilly good time it is.it seems that rob can't win: try to take halloween and its' characters in his own direction--while, i might add, paying homage to a variety of movies throughout horror's illustrious and varied history--and he just gets crucified. i mean, we bitch (well, not me, i don't mind them) about remakes and sequels and lack of originality, and someone comes along and takes an established character, who, c'mon, only really had one classic movie to his resume, arguably two that were decent (not saying i don't like more than that, just, you know, objectively), and moves the character off in a different direction, different vibe, and he gets taken apart, like he's never made any meaningful contributions to the genre.halloween 2 is refreshingly original, vibrant, chaotic, tense and interesting.  i think it's sort of rob's middle finger to the world, to make something so polarizing, and, for me, it works.  i find truth in it. i urge viewers, especially fellow horror fanatics, to step outside their boxes, take off their visors, and embrace this manic work of creativity.  it's a beautiful, horrible thing.",5,halloween II: white trash prometheus,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,5278,"['*****SPOILERS*****so', 'halloween', '2', 'directed', 'rob', 'zombie', 'honestly', 'i', 'loathed', 'rob', 'first',

1291184,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B002V3HT2G,Cagneyfan67,"[1, 1]","Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 is a great horror film and I think it does the Halloween franchise justice. I thought Zombie made this film different and was very creative. The opening to this movie is great as it pays tribute to the original Halloween 2 by having Myers stalk Laurie in a hospital. It all is a dream though. In real life time has passed and it has left a lot of trauma and bad memories to Laurie as she is an emotional wreck still trying to heal and get over that traumatic experience and learning that Myers is her brother. I thought it was realistic for someone to be like this after undergoing the experience. Compton is not a very good actress and having the most difficult part to play didn't help her in this movie.The acting large in part in pretty solid. Malcom Mcdowell gives a great performance as Dr. Loomis. Loomis has turned into a greedy, selfish egotist who will do anything to make a buck off his experiences with Myers. He has another book to sell and shows to appear on. He could care less about Myers being still out there as he is clearly out for himself. I like Zombie changing the character to make Loomis not an honorable man as in the original films. It's a strong point of the film that separates it from the original Halloween 2.Brad Douriff gives the best performance in the film as Sheriff Brackett. He is the most likable character in the movie and represents the honorable man that Loomis isn't. Brackett takes care of Laurie as if she is his daughter which is nice. Douriff has a great chemistry with Danielle Harris who returns as Annie. The two seem like a good father and daughter. Harris gives a great supporting performance in the film. She is someone on Myers's target list but also a survivor. It's cool having Harris once again in a Halloween movie since she has been doing them since she was a kid. Once Donald Pleasance passed on and Jamie Lee Curtis moved on from the Franchise Harris has carried on the tradition.Sheri Moon Zombie does a good acting job in the film as a ghost. I always thought Sheri Moon is a underrated actress. She did a great job in the first Halloween. The whole white horse thing was interesting. I like that Rob wanted to bring something new to the table.Chase Wright Vanek takes over the role of young Michael Myers. I thought the previous actor was much better and it was too bad he got too old for the part. There are some nice horror legends appearing briefly in the film. Margot Kidder from horror movies such as Black Christmas and Amityvillve Horror appears as a doctor. Caroline Williams from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 appears as Loomis's publicist. She is some nice added comic relief.The movie is very violent. It's brutal to put it in one word. My father said it best Myers was not too happy with Mrs Spencer who won an oscar after this film but in this film she plays a nurse who gets stabbed twenty times or so. That sets the tone for the whole movie. It's unrelenting and takes no prisoners. I know when Myers speaks in the film people didn't like that but once again it's being different than the Carpenter version. I liked that and thought it added to the great climax of the film.This is a very brutal and dark serious horror movie for the most part. When Danielle Harris is killed brutally it is a major shock and you care about her character and when Douriff finds his daughter it's one of the more tragic scenes in the history of horror. Douriff played the scene beautifully and instantly as the viewer we are on his side to get revenge on Myers. It was very dark and sad Annie dies. I like the flashblacks and dreams Laurie has during the film. It's well directed by Zombie.In the end Loomis finally comes to the realization that his fame is over, he's been a huge ass and Myers is alive and he maybe the only one that can stop him. He comes to help Laurie who is being held hostage by Myers. I won't say anything more but the unrated director's cut is one of the best endings to a horror film and I've seen a lot of them.

1291186,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B002V3HT2G,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[5, 10]","When creating anything in this world one must be true to oneself. Trying to second guess what other people want is pointless and will never produce honest work. With so many remakes out there today, especially of horror film classics, it is important to add something new and fresh beyond fast camera work and digital effects. I feel Zombie has put his heart and soul into this film and made the best film he could possibly make. it feel like he made it for himself and that honesty and conviction shows through in the film to me. For a film like this to resonate with me it needs to have something new. Zombie added his own take on the who, what, when, where, and why and peppered it throughout with homages, nods, and new ideas.I can see how people might come away thinking all that white horse stuff was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo but for me it added an artistic dimension to the film. It gave me something new to think about. It also made me curious about Zombie a bit more. He is obviously a well read person, even if his reading material may not be the same taste as mine.The idea of Michael as some Terminator of destruction was toned down and as to the bullet he received in the head in H1, well, it at least can be speculated on. Bullets do go into peoples heads and they live. Sometimes it happens. I come at a film like this differently than i would a film form an other genre. Horror films have a stigma and strikes against them already. To me there are only a few horror films that take it seriously enough to consider it art at all. Most films like this are tongue in cheek and use the cliche language of a thousand horror films past as a roadmap. While Zombie clearly used this language and gave us a few traditional ""cat scares"" there was enough of a departure from this early on for me to get deeply hooked. There was also a realism, power and intensity in this and H1 that I enjoyed greatly.The power and raw energy that Zombie imparts to Michael is exactly what makes these 2 films of his so great to me. While not unstoppable Michael is still more ferocious than he was in any of the originals. I see Michael as force of nature here, similar to Anton Chigurh in No Country For Old Men. The allusions that are made with Michael to the dark side of man and what horrors we are capable of is the core of what is at work in these 2 films. The originals and many other slasher films may have this in them too, but I suspect Zombie knows this and pushes this aspect of what it is about horror films that make us love them and flirt with so much death. Our mortality and the unknown forces at work in us and what truly makes us tick is important to many slasher films. Rather than just make another unstoppable killer we care little for, Michael in these films and this one in particular is given what often lacks in 99% of films like this...motivation. Michael is motivated to make his family complete again. He is bitter about all that went wrong in his life. His internal clockwork is all messed up and he has been left with little else but a few fond memories he clings to an distorts to achieve what he hopes will make him complete.The character of Laurie Strode is given more to work with in this film too. She has her demons that haunt her and a metaphysical connection between her and Michael is alluded to, suggesting that perhaps there may be something wrong with that family or there may just be a connection between the two of them. In H1 Michael did care for her when she was a baby and saw her as a pure untainted soul. When he finally go to her in this film he did not mindlessly kill her but rather contemplated her and the gravity of a complete family and what that means.My complaints with this film are mostly with the Loomis character. He was not the same character from H1 and I did not care for the change. I saw what Zombie was pushing with him as a media shilling for money but felt this aspect of our society could have been toned down a bit and was unnecessary here. There was too much departure to all that talk show stuff that felt out of place and could have been made better with inserted news footage or just less Loomis in general. This was my one complaint. Still I am sure Zombie thought long and hard about all that stuff and to him it was what he wanted. For his efforts and delivering what I feel was a way above par film for a genre that usually produces unwatchable garbage (Saw films) almost every time, I commend him. Zombie has made an honest film and despite the faults it is still a gem in my opinion and worth a few more viewings for sure.",5,Zombie is at the top of his game,1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,4598,"['When', 'creating', 'anything', 'world', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'true', 'oneself', 'Trying', 'second', 'guess', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'want', 'pointless', 'will', 'never', 'produce', 'honest', 'work', 'so', 'many', 'remakes', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'especially', 'horror', 'film', 'classics', 'important', 'add', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'fast', 'camera', 'work', 'digital', 'effects', 'feel', 'Zombie', 'put', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'made', 'best', 'film', 'could', 'possibly', 'make', 'feel', 'made', 'honesty', 'conviction', 'shows', 'film', 'film', 'resonate', 'have', 'something', 'new', 'Zombie', 'added', 'own', 'take', 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'peppered', 'homages', 'nods', 'new', 'ideas.I', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'might', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'white', 'horse', 'stuff', 'was', 'just', 'bunch', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'added', 'artistic', 'dimension', 'film', 'gave', 'something', 'new', 'think', 'also', 'made', 'curious', 'Zombie', 'bit', 'more', 'obviously', 'well', 'read', 'person', 'even', 'reading', 'material', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'taste', 'mine.The', 'idea', 'Michael', 'Terminator', 'destruction', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'bullet', 'received', 'head', 'H1', 'well', 'least', 'can', 'be', 'speculated', 'Bullets', 'do', 'go', 'peoples', 'heads', 'live', 'Sometimes', 'come', 'film', 'differently', 'i', 'would', 'film', 'form', 'other', 'genre', 'Horror', 'films', 'have', 'stigma', 'strikes', 'already', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'horror', 'films', 'take', 'seriously', 'enough', 'consider', 'art', 'Most', 'films', 'are', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'use', 'cliche', 'language', 'thousand', 'horror', 'films', 'roadmap', 'Zombie', 'clearly', 'used', 'language', 'gave', 'few', 'traditional', 'cat', 'scares', 'was', 'enough', 'departure', 'early', 'get', 'deeply', 'hooked', 'was', 'also', 'realism', 'power', 'intensity', 'H1', 'enjoyed', 'greatly.The', 'power', 'raw', 'energy', 'Zombie', 'Michael', 'exactly', 'what', '2', 'films', 'so', 'great', 'not', 'unstoppable', 'Michael', 'still', 'more', 'ferocious', 'was', 'originals', 'see', 'Michael', 'force', 'nature', 'here', 'similar', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'allusions', 'are', 'made', 'Michael', 'dark', 'side', 'man', 'what', 'horrors', 'are', 'capable', 'core', 'what', 'work', '2', 'films', 'originals', 'many', 'other', 'slasher', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'too', 'suspect', 'Zombie', 'aspect', 'what', 'horror', 'films', 'make', 'love', 'flirt', 'so', 'much', 'death', 'mortality', 'unknown', 'forces', 'work', 'what', 'truly', 'important', 'many', 'slasher', 'films', 'Rather', 'just', 'make', 'unstoppable', 'killer', 'care', 'little', 'Michael', 'films', 'one', 'particular', 'given', 'what', 'often', '99', '%', 'films', 'motivation', 'Michael', 'motivated', 'make', 'family', 'complete', 'again', 'bitter', 'went', 'wrong', 'life', 'internal', 'clockwork', 'messed', 'up', 'been', 'left', 'little', 'else', 'few', 'fond', 'memories', 'distorts', 'achieve', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'complete.The', 'character', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'given', 'more', 'work', 'film', 'too', 'demons', 'haunt', 'metaphysical', 'connection', 'Michael', 'alluded', 'suggesting', 'perhaps', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'wrong', 'family', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'connection', 'two', 'H1', 'Michael', 'did', 'care', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'saw', 'pure', 'untainted', 'soul', 'When', 'finally', 'go', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'mindlessly', 'kill', 'rather', 'contemplated', 'gravity', 'complete', 'family', 'what', 'means.My', 'complaints', 'film', 'are', 'mostly', 'Loomis', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'character', 'H1', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'change', 'saw', 'what', 'Zombie', 'was', 'pushing', 'media', 'shilling', 'money', 'felt', 'aspect', 'society', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'here', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'departure', 'talk', 'show', 'stuff', 'felt', 'place', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'better', 'inserted', 'news', 'footage', 'just', 'less', 'Loomis', 'general', 'was', 'one', 'complaint', 'Still', 'am', 'sure', 'Zombie', 'thought', 'long', 'hard', 'stuff', 'was', 'what', 'wanted', 'efforts', 'delivering', 'what', 'feel', 'was', 'way', 'par', 'film', 'genre', 'usually', 'unwatchable', 'garbage', 'Saw', 'films', 'almost', 'time', 'commend', 'Zombie', 'made', 'honest', 'film', 'faults', 'still', 'gem', 'opinion', 'worth', 'few', 'more', 'viewings', 'sure']",N/A

The nightmares have taken their toll; she's drinking, partying, anything to forget. Dr. Loomis is coping in his own way; he's written a tell-all book about the Halloween massacre and is drinking up the media love. Only Michael is still Michael, doing what Michael does. Working his way across the countryside, killing everyone whose path he crosses, he's set on getting Laurie this time. And he has supernatural help: his mother has come back, dressed in white, riding a white horse, telling him he needs to put the family back together. And that means Laurie has to die.Halloween II is not a faithful retelling of the original, as Zombie's Halloween was, but a completely new story under the same title.

1291194,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002V3HT2G,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 9]","Everything that made Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" such a great horror film is noticeably absent from ""Halloween II."" This is not a movie so much as a surrealistic freak show, a cruel, ugly-looking free-for-all that assaults the senses at every opportunity with lightning fast cuts, extreme close-ups, and grating music. Unlike what was released in 2007, ""Halloween II"" is not a remake of any film in the original ""Halloween"" series--it's a new story so strange, unpleasant, and inexplicable, it's as if Zombie wrote it completely off the cuff. What was he thinking? How could he let his vision go so horribly out of control? I can only hope that this isn't a sign of his success being a fluke, that ""Halloween II"" is merely a lapse of judgment from which he will soon recover.It begins exactly where the first film ended, with Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) savagely shooting Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) on Halloween night. An elaborate dream sequence follows, one that pays homage to Rick Rosenthal's 1981 version of the film by taking place in a hospital. As soon as Laurie wakes up screaming, we learn that a year has passed and that she's in therapy, and of course, she has the usual anxiety medications stashed in her medicine cabinet. She's now living with Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif) and his daughter, Annie (Danielle Harris). No one knows the whereabouts of Michael, which is strange because witnesses do remember the county coroner putting his body into an ambulance. Needless to say, Michael is very much alive, living in the middle of nowhere while plotting his return to Haddonfield, Illinois.He's after Laurie, of course. But why? The ads have given this plot point away, but if you've managed to avoid them, let it suffice to say that he feels a special connection with her. This ties into the weirdest subplot ever conceived of for a ""Halloween"" film, which involves visions of Michael's long since dead mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) walking next to a horse. She wears a flowing ghost-like dress and either walks down a brightly lit hallway or stands in front of brilliant white light. In one of the film's most bizarre scenes, Michael and his mother stand in front of a table where ghastly creatures (looking like rejects from ""Pan's Labyrinth"") seem to be reenacting Jesus' Last Supper. If there was any decent way to account for this ridiculous spectacle, I'd be the first to share it with you.Meanwhile, Michael's former psychologist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), is now promoting his new book about the Myers' family and the murders that took place a year ago. What a change twelve months can make; Loomis has de-evolved into an arrogant publicity hound, which is to say that the audience no longer has any reason to take him seriously. He's now nothing more than an opportunity for moments of comedy relief. What did Zombie hope to achieve by making Loomis a figure of fun? Given how deadly serious the rest of the film is, this seems incredibly out of place. When the foundation of the plot is a series of stabbings, spatters of blood, and a hell of a lot of screaming, a director can't believably pause to reveal that he also has a sense of humor. He has to show it all throughout in order for it to work.The hideous visuals don't help matters much. Rather than eerie shadows that build tension, Zombie opts for muted tones that look dirty and disgusting, as if mud was smeared over the camera lens before shooting. There's no sense of tension with this kind of look; there's only a sense of filth and degradation. But this story isn't supposed to be one of exploitation. On the basis of ""Halloween,"" which was a skillful combination of suspense and primal fear, I would have thought that Zombie already understood this. Apparently he didn't, and that leads me to an unfortunate conclusion: ""Halloween II"" fails because Zombie created an original story. The 2007 film, on the other hand, wasn't a complete reinvention but more of an update on John Carpenter's original. Strange how a little creative restraint can paradoxically be so freeing.Watching this movie is like witnessing a tragic fall from grace. Maybe that's to be expected, since sequels, especially in the horror genre, are notoriously inferior to the ones that started it all. Was there any way that ""Halloween II"" could have been better or just as good as ""Halloween""? Who can say? All I know is that this movie gets virtually nothing right, not the visuals, not the story, and definitely not the characters, who spew dialogue so foul and inane that they seem transplanted from another movie altogether. The whole thing is an unsightly mess with a nonsensical plot, a sideshow attraction that wants to pass itself off as a real horror film. I can't help but feel sorry for Zombie. ""Halloween II"" shows that he has lost his way as a director. Let us hope he will eventually get his bearings.",2,Even Serial Killers Need Their Mommies,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,4889,"['Everything', 'made', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'such', 'great',

The first ten minutes where it shows a ten minute run through of the original second movie was awesome and actually frightening but then after that Rob Zombie single handedly ruined the franchise. A franchise that I've always loved, even through Busta Rhymes round house kicking Michael through a window(Which was Oscar material compared to this). The first Rob Zombie remake was good. Hey, it was really good. A bit too much focus on little mental Michael and not fully in sync with the original. (WARNING: Spoilers Ahead! Read on if you want to know the worst things about the film) But the second just went and said, &#34;Hey, let's make Michael not wear the mask through half of it and show his face too. It's ok, he won't even be in half of it. It's mainly just Lori yelling. Let's also make his dead mother's ghost thing talk to him like he's actually mental and not just evil. (just an excuse for Rob's wife to be in it again) Let's also make everything grunge even though it hasn't existed in twenty years. Let's make Lori not sweet but a terrible, unrelatable, dirty, annoying character. Let's also make our hero, Dr. Loomis, a greedy, self-righteous, glorified, mean, unrelatable, selfish d**k who really has no reason to be in it.&#34; (Big Spoiler, though, who cares at this point) &#34;Oh and it would be cool if Rob Zombie...I mean Michael Myers talks, screaming the word DIE at Loomis just before the immortal Michael is killed...again.&#34; I don't get it either. &#34;But rest assure, your least favorite character, Lori, will be Michael in the next film because he touched her right before he died, (This poor attempt to do the same thing the 4th movie did.)&#34; There's more, a lot more that was just awful.

After several viewings, I started to see the Zombie-vision/revision of the classic and it grew on me.  I honestly began to feel more out of it than the original.  So, for the sequel, I was silently amped.I've seen every Halloween movie at the theater(except the direct-to-video part 6), a tradition in our family  and I can tell you, the worst one I have seen at the theater is still Resurrection, even though part 5 and now this one are not too far behind.Atmosphere is something Zombie gets and doesn't get all at the same time.  He nails deep rooted ambience at moments when it is not needed (such as the interesting hospital intro) and then where he should finish us off, he sort of fumbles around (like throwing his wife in to give some meaning behind the massacre).  The shots are usually good, but for this flick, I was severely disappointed.  It did remind me a bit of part 6: the curse of michael myers in it's raw cheesiness.  The shots were too close, too obscure and relied heavily on imagination, which is fine, but if you're going to go all out with a brutal murder scene, give us a look-see, would you? I love the posters for this movie...they have a grainy texture that gives Michael a raw edge.  You don't get that in the film.  The photography on the posters is better than the cinematography of the film and I wish I was exaggerating.Dialogue is almost painful and character development is slow and bitter.  Sherriff Bracket is great and Loomis is also good (even though many will hate him in this one...a sign of good acting), as both bring light to true human nature.  I think the actors in Zombie's movies are actually getting bad direction and dialogue, so I can't blame them.Michael himself does a great job being the murder-some brother, but he looks awful.  I can sympathize with the idea of him becoming somewhat of a vagabond, but the classic look of the mask is all but gone, turning the 'shape' into the 'bum'.  He looked and acted far better in the first Zombie take on Halloween than this one.  And the kid who plays Michael is different, which is never a good thing in a sequel of any kind.  It shows a lack of budget and integrity. There are some great murder scenes, but due to clumsy editing, you won't see much.  Too bad ALL of the murder scenes were pretty much the same on this one.The whole mom and young Michael bit was weird and insubstantial and having ***SPOILER ALERT*** Laurie put on the mask at the end and become the next ""Michael' was a cliche trick we've seen before (end of Halloween 4).  Nice for Rob to give his old lady a part, but it wasn't needed and it hardly carried the movie in any way, or even made for an interesting artsy filler of any kind.  Maybe he just needs to make an entire movie about just his wife and get it out of his system already.  Anyways, the tie-in seems pointless.It's a sad movie because the pieces are there and I guess we can all hope when the DVD comes out, it's slightly better.  I wouldn't say it's as awful as some have said, but that's because I'm partial to the series, but it was missing a lot.  Don't expect much and you might be able to appreciate some things in it.  There was a masterpiece to be had here, but the crew seems tired, out of touch and unwilling to fulfill a vision of autumn terror.",3,Well...,1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,3350,"['first', 'time', 'saw', '2007', 'remake', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'several', 'viewings', 'started', 'see', 'Zombie-vision/revision', 'classic', 'grew', 'honestly', 'began', 'feel', 'more', 'original', 'So', 'sequel', 'was', 'silently', 'amped.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'theater', 'direct-to-video', 'part', '6', 'tradition', 'family', 'can', 'tell', 'worst', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'theater', 'still', 'Resurrection', 'even', 'part', '5', 'now', 'one', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'something', 'Zombie', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'time', 'deep', 'rooted', 'ambience', 'moments', 'when', 'not', 'needed', 'such', 'interesting', 'hospital', 'intro', 'then', 'where', 'should', 'finish', 'off', 'sort', 'fumbles', 'throwing', 'wife', 'give', 'meaning', 'massacre', 'shots', 'are', 'usually', 'good', 'flick', 'was', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'did', 'remind', 'bit', 'part', '6', 'curse', 'michael', 'myers', 'raw', 'cheesiness', 'shots', 'were', 'too', 'close', 'too', 'obscure', 'relied', 'heavily', 'imagination', 'fine', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'out', 'brutal', 'murder', 'scene', 'give', 'look-see', 'would', 'love', 'posters', 'movie', 'have', 'grainy', 'texture', 'Michael', 'raw', 'edge', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'photography', 'posters', 'better', 'cinematography', 'film', 'wish', 'was', 'exaggerating.Dialogue', 'almost', 'painful', 'character', 'development', 'slow', 'bitter', 'Sherriff', 'Bracket', 'great', 'Loomis', 'also', 'good', 'even', 'many', 'will', 'hate', 'one', 'sign', 'good', 'acting', 'bring', 'light', 'true', 'human', 'nature', 'think', 'actors', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'actually', 'getting', 'bad', 'direction', 'dialogue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'them.Michael', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'murder-some', 'brother', 'awful', 'can', 'sympathize', 'idea', 'becoming', 'somewhat', 'vagabond', 'classic', 'look', 'mask', 'gone', 'turning', ""'shape"", ""'bum"", 'looked', 'acted', 'far', 'better', 'first', 'Zombie', 'take', 'Halloween', 'one', 'kid', 'who', 'Michael', 'different', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'sequel', 'kind', 'lack', 'budget', 'integrity', 'are', 'great', 'murder', 'scenes', 'due', 'clumsy', 'editing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'Too', 'bad', 'ALL', 'murder', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'one.The', 'whole', 'mom', 'young', 'Michael', 'bit', 'was', 'weird', 'insubstantial', 'having', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***', 'Laurie', 'put', 'mask', 'end', 'become', 'next', 'Michael', 'was', 'cliche', 'trick', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'end', 'Halloween', '4', 'Nice', 'Rob', 'give', 'old', 'lady', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'hardly', 'carried', 'movie', 'way', 'even', 'made', 'interesting', 'artsy', 'filler', 'kind', 'Maybe', 'just', 'make', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'wife', 'get', 'system', 'already', 'Anyways', 'tie-in', 'pointless.It', 'sad', 'movie', 'pieces', 'are', 'there', 'guess', 'can', 'hope', 'when', 'DVD', 'out', 'slightly', 'better', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'as', 'awful', 'have', 'said', ""'m"", 'partial', 'series', 'was', 'missing', 'lot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'things', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'crew', 'tired', 'touch', 'unwilling', 'fulfill', 'vision', 'autumn', 'terror']",N/A

I have to confess that we have seen Rob's Halloween at least 50 times. We try to watch it at least once a week.Finally Halloween II (the unrated dicerector's cut) arrived yesterday and last night we set up to see if this was going to be another Masterpiece for Zombie but more importantly another Masterpiece we could enjoy.After a moment we, ""fastened our seat belts...) and went for one hell of a ride. We couldn't help commenting to each other how fantastic it was as we were sucked in. Every scene was more terrifying than the last. Taylor Scout Compton took her role as Laurie Strode and ripped it apart with fiendish ~ feverish ~ frenzy! Best horror female we've ever seen.We knew Walmart was selling it and was there today doing some white trash shopping. We went by the DVD section and the entire wall display of Halloween II was empty and now we know why.We can't understand why people gave it one star? Maybe he/she didn't get the promised surprise from their date that night? Fell asleep from drinking too much before the movie? Forgot to leave the lobby and game area to see the whole film? Or a grudge about something?Jamie Lee Curtis originated the role of Laurie Strode in John Carpenter'sHalloweenand later blew our socks off in bothHalloween H2OandHalloween - Resurrection. Our Jamie could never be replaced.Yet Taylor Scout Compton brought such life to Laurie to make us believe she's Laurie that now we have 2 Flawless Laurie Strode's.

1291201,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002V3HT2G,Craig Whittle,"[0, 0]","HALLOWEEN IISTARRING:  Scout Taylor-Compton, Tyler Mane, Brad Dourif, Malcolm McDowell, Shari Moon Zombie, Danielle Harris, oh yeah and `Weird Al' YankovicWRITTEN BY: Rob ZombieDIRECTED BY: Rob ZombieRated: RGenre: HorrorRelease Date: 28 August 2009Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween was hands down one of the best horror films of the last decade; then came Halloween II.The film opens up with another child-actor playing a young Myers back at the asylum with his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) who brings him his toy horse.  I would love to know why they weren't able to get the same kid from the previous film to reprise his role as Michael. He did a phenomenal job and watching all of the special features, he had an absolute blast with the role. This new kid isn't creepy and is nowhere near the actor the other kid was. I was immediately disappointed by this.  The entire opening was slow and weak.Things pick up a bit and we're right back where we left off from the first film. All the rest of the original cast is back, thank God. The next 15 minutes or so were done very well; lots of gore, great acting, amazing cinematography; all paying homage to the classic hospital sequence of the original sequel. Good stuff. Michael is kicking butt and not caring to take names.And then, Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) wakes up and the entire sequence was apparently a dream. Wow, we just wasted 15 minutes. Okay, so we go with it and learn that Laurie Strode is no longer the quiet innocent virgin she once was. Apparently she has had some trouble adjusting to the painful memories of the previous Halloween night; transforming her into a dark misfit with ratty hair, grungy clothes and even a token tramp stamp tattoo. It's understandable she'd change but it feels too much like Rob Zombie and not like Halloween.Then we meet back up with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  My first instinct was to discredit him for his performance but then I found myself realizing that it wasn't his fault; the entire character was changed from the charming hero he was in all of the other films, into an egotistical, self centered butt-head.  Where did this come from? Loomis spends about 95% of his screen time trying to soak up his 15 minutes of fame from his new book. If he's not doing that, he's just being flat out rude to everyone he comes into contact with.  Why was he changed into such a jerk-off?And oh yes, there's the new and improved Michael Myers (Tyler Mane). Or as I like to call him: Jason Voorhees-Myers, because he's now every bit of a mamma's boy as Jason.  He sees his mother (who killed herself in the previous film), often with a large white horse (I'm guessing the toy horse?) and a younger version of himself, taunting him to kill; as if that's not enough, now he apparently grunts with anger when he slays his victims, which bothered me severely.  We see him eat, we see his eyes way too often and he must be cold because he wears a hoodie for a good portion of the film. Yes that's right, a hoodie.  Zombie has added way too many human elements to Myers, making him dull and not scary at all. Traditionally what has made Myers terrifying, is he looks human but he's simply just not there behind that mask. That is why we go to see him. That is what makes him intriguing and horrifying.There are also two huge ingredients missing from this film. One is THE SCORE. Where is the brilliant Halloween theme we have all come to love? It never shows up until the end credits start to roll. The movie feels so empty without it. And the second is sex. There are no sex scenes in this film; a few close calls, but no dice. We want to see some sex before we get our blood Mr. Zombie. It's a Halloween film for God's sakes!With all of that as bad as it was, the third act was the most disappointing of all. I'm not even going to mention it in detail; mainly because I'm so confused by it my head may explode. Why did the sheriff seem to be more concerned for Laurie, than he was for his own daughter? Why did Loomis finally care enough to show up? Were we watching Cops or Halloween II? What was the point of the ending? I'm at a loss for words here.One good thing about the film was the performance of the Sheriff played by the legendary Brad Dourif. His acting alone earned one whole star for this sad film in my book.As much as I complained about Zombie's vision here, he is an amazing director. The scenes with the dead mother and the horse were creepy and the last scene of the film reminded me of something out of The Shining. He shows us awesome stylized camera shots and slow motion sequences. There's even a dramatic sad score playing when one of Michael's victims dies slowly; while I can appreciate all of those elements for how well they were filmed, I just don't understand what they are doing in a Halloween film.",2,Halloween II Review,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,4833,"['HALLOWEEN', 'IISTARRING', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell',

1291204,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002V3HT2G,C. Sawin,"[3, 5]","This film has to set the record for dream sequences, which makes you wonder if the entire film is nothing more than a dream. I wasn't exactly a big fan of the remake from 2007 and expectations for this film were incredibly low, nobody can really be prepared for how terrible this film really is. Since there's so much wrong with this film, we'll try and start with what was actually was enjoyable.Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is really the highlight of the film as far as acting goes. While that probably isn't saying much and his role isn't as big as you may expect, he does a good job with the screen time he gets. His character is intense right from the start, but as things take a turn for the worse for his character his downward spiral is the most enthralling aspect of the film. A few of the deaths were also really satisfying. Mainly Buddy the Security Guard. There's a night scene where an officer is out on Sheriff Brackett's lawn and we're looking at the silhouette of a tree while the officer searches the premises. Before you know it, we see Michael emerge from that tree silhouette and kill the officer.Everything else in the film was just horrendous. The flaws are almost so overwhelming that it's nearly impossible to know where to begin. The whole white horse thing is ridiculous. So if Deborah Myers tells young Michael that he can think of her whenever he looks at the white horse figurine she gave him, wouldn't that make her a horse by default? The inconsistencies in the film are incredibly glaring, as well. Laurie and Annie's injuries from the previous film seem more severe at the start of this one, Laurie being able to put weight on an injured leg by walking on it but it causing her extreme pain when she's lifted from a stretcher to a bed at the hospital, Michael chopping off a guy's head with a shard of glass, etc. The ""Nights in White Satin"" thing was literally beaten into your skull by the time the film ended. If you sit through the film, it's like Rob is sitting next to you each time the song comes on nudging you with his elbow going, ""Eh? Do you get it? You get it?"" Michael was way too vocal for my liking. Heavy breathing is one thing, but when we're hearing him grunt loudly every time he stabs somebody then it takes a lot of it. When he actually talked at the end of the film, I was done. He also seemed to spend more time stabbing women than men in the film. Guys get their head chopped off or an axe to the back while women get stabbed a dozen times or have their face smashed against a mirror nine times. The choreography didn't seem as good as the remake either. There's a scene where water gets on the camera and it's on there the entire scene. It's interesting at first, but after a few minutes you just want someone to get a towel to wipe it down. As powerful as Michael seems to be, it at least made a bit more sense in the original film by John Carpenter. Michael was pure evil. That was the explanation, so him not being able to die at least sort of made sense. Now that he's been given this white trash upbringing in the remake, his super strength and inability to die just seems even more farfetched than it originally did. So when Michael is busting through walls and lifting cars with his bare hands all Incredible Hulk style in this film, it's laughable. Not to mention what happened to the Dr. Loomis character. There are just way too many things wrong with this sequel to list here.Rob Zombie has certainly made Halloween his own with Halloween II. It's just a shame that it's really not worth watching seriously. Let's put it this way, the highlight of the film is Weird Al's cameo.

Also we get to see legendary veteran actor Malcolm McDowell, in all his charisma and charm. Rob Zombie even manages to build a character arc into the plot for him, however unconvincing it may be.And now for the negative: this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It builds no tension, sustains no suspense, introduces no characters I could care about. It is horribly edited, coming off as a jumble of scenes which do not seem to hang together or build upon each other properly. It is frustrating. Much of the film is confusing, and in the end I just didn't care. At all. It is so poorly written, at times I wasn't believing what I was hearing coming out of the actor's mouths. If all that weren't bad enough, if commits the number one sin of the horror film: it isn't the slightest bit scary. This movie is a mess. I think there were some things here that could have been taken and built upon to make a decent film, but these opportunities were missed.

It tries to be too dramatic at times, too deep, too abstract, and falls flat.

The killings were routine, the shaky camera work was dizzying (I get that it's done for effect, but we also like to SEE what's happening), hardly any original John Carpenter Halloween score music which would have helped, the performances (especially Dr. Loomis) were annoying, and they couldn't even get the same kid to play young Michael - that was the biggest distraction.

Yes, it's extremely brutal and violent, but, it IS a horror movie, and a Rob Zombie one to boot, so what did you really expect out of it? Zombie said from the get-go that he set out to take the Halloween story and make it his own vision, which is exactly what he's accomplished with his two entries into this franchise.

I heard it getting trashed, but then I was slightly surprised when I saw it. A total of 2-3 years is suppose to have passed regarding this sequel. What we get is more of Zombie's delving into the human psyche, than an actual remake of the Halloween film. It has plenty of social undertones in it, and if you don't watch with a close eye, and a relative understanding of what's actually being done here then you'll likely won't appreciate the movie, and you'll turn into a mind less critic.I'm interested in the directors cut because Laurie's healing is supposed to be traded in for a much darker experience. We also find that Michael is living inside his own head, and the results are a mixed bag. Michael believes either his mother is angel from heaven (that explains the white horse) or we get the feeling she is a demon trying to fool him. The mask plays a more relevant role in this film. We tend to find that Michael's identity is that mask. So when you do see him out of that mask he is just blank, devoid of all human emotion, but the identity inside that mask brings forth a monster that even Jason himself could not become. Michael is filled with unbridled rage, and you get a lot of grunting, and a hell of a lot of screaming in one particular scene. I read one review about a face less Michael screaming ""die!"" but that wasn't the same movie I was watching.Loomis after his egotistical stint of apparently failing Michael has for whatever reason not gotten any better. In fact Loomis doesn't even redeem himself until the end of the movie but unlike some reviewers I am not going to spoil it. What we find here is Loomis has authored a ""Non Fiction"" book where he examines Michael, and instead of admitting his failure he has instead let success go to his head and corrupt his heart. Couple that with Annie's sympathy, and you're instantly at odds with what Loomis has become. This is the kind of tension you look to get lost in.The end of the movie itself was completely the opposite of what I was going for. And any effort to ignore this in Halloween 3D is just an injustice itself. But I guess time will tell.Some times people can get caught up in trashing a movie, or feel like their expectations are never going to be met that they can't appreciate something different.

The most glaring fault with the movie is that its supposed to be set one year after the first therefore 1981, so why did Dr Loomis have a LCD TV in his hotel room and why were they talking about Mike Myers of Austin Powers fame? Maybe Rob forgot and thought it was 2009.Like I say good but not great, my four star rating reflects the fact that I am a Halloween fan, I own them all, except Halloween 3 obviously.",4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,1058,"['have', 'say', 'preferred', 'first', 'Halloween', 'remake', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'when', 'people', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'have', 'mask', 'other', 'reviewers', 'commented', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'rubbish', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'grunting', 'dream', 'sequences', 'apparations', 'young', 'Michael', 'mum', 'Rob', 'tried', 'change', 'formula', 'bit', 'many', 'installments', 'was', 'necessary.I', 'did', 'however', 'find', 'Laurie', 'tad', 'annoying', 'making', 'hard', 'care', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'got', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'Michael', 'back', 'most', 'glaring', 'fault', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'one', 'year', 'first', 'therefore', '1981', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'Dr', 'Loomis', 'have', 'LCD', 'TV', 'hotel', 'room', 'why', 'were', 'talking', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'fame', 'Maybe', 'Rob', 'forgot', 'thought', 'was', '2009.Like', 'say', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'fact', 'am', 'Halloween', 'fan', 'own', 'Halloween', '3', 'obviously']",N/A

1291221,A3TBIP2WWK7L85,B002V3HT2G,"Erik Kramer ""ekosmo72""","[5, 9]","This movie was a complete waste of time.  I wonder if its possible to sue Rob Zombie for the time wasted in watching this movie.  I am a huge fan of the original Halloween series (minus part three).  I also enjoyed Rob Zombie's first remake.  However, this was a futile effort in filmmaking.  Allow me to elaborate for a moment.First of all, the picture quality stinks.  When viewing this dismal excuse of a movie you cannot even see the gory picture scenes.  Ok, I admit I am a little demented but the main reason to see a horror movie is actually see people being butchered by some maniacal psychopathic killer.  In this remake it is impossible to see the events of the death scenes because the producer failed to sufficiently light the scenes.Secondly the acting was reminiscent of a William Shatner death scene.  Over the top and not at all believable.  It almost seemed as if they gathered a bunch of kids of the street and told them to act in a movie.  Were there no actual auditions? Or is it that the filmmakers have no eye for talent?Finally the character development merely didn't exist.  We never got to know let alone relate to Lori Strode (the main female character).  The Dr. Loomis character was a joke.  In the original series Donald Pleasance portrayed him as the silent mentor type (or not so silent), with a passion for hunting down his arch nemesis.  His passion and fear in hunting down Michael Meyers was akin to that of Captain Ahab hunting his great white whale.  In this remake, Dr. Loomis is a bitter creation of a narcissistic society.  Whereas in the first series the Loomis character was a bastion of good, this new Loomis is almost as evil as Michael Meyers just in a different way.Needless to say I only gave this movie a rating of one because there isn't a lower rating to give on Amazon.  Save your money and buy one of the following horror movies:  The original Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, or Camp Sleepaway.",1,Skip this horror of a horror movie,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,1986,"['movie', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'wonder', 'possible', 'sue', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'time', 'wasted', 'watching', 'movie', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'Halloween', 'series', 'part', 'three', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'first', 'remake', 'However', 'was', 'futile', 'effort', 'filmmaking', 'Allow', 'elaborate', 'moment.First', 'picture', 'quality', 'stinks', 'When', 'viewing', 'dismal', 'excuse', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'gory', 'picture', 'scenes', 'Ok', 'admit', 'am', 'little', 'demented', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'actually', 'see', 'people', 'being', 'butchered', 'maniacal', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'remake', 'impossible', 'see', 'events', 'death', 'scenes', 'producer', 'failed', 'sufficiently', 'light', 'scenes.Secondly', 'acting', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'William', 'Shatner', 'death', 'scene', 'top', 'not', 'believable', 'almost', 'seemed', 'gathered', 'bunch', 'kids', 'street', 'told', 'act', 'movie', 'Were', 'there', 'actual', 'auditions', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'eye', 'talent', 'Finally', 'character', 'development', 'merely', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'let', 'alone', 'relate', 'Lori', 'Strode', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'character', 'was', 'joke', 'original', 'series', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'portrayed', 'silent', 'mentor', 'type', 'not', 'so', 'silent', 'passion', 'hunting', 'down', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'passion', 'fear', 'hunting', 'down', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'was', 'akin', 'Captain', 'Ahab', 'hunting', 'great', 'white', 'whale', 'remake', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'bitter', 'creation', 'narcissistic', 'society', 'Whereas', 'first', 'series', 'Loomis', 'character', 'was', 'bastion', 'good', 'new', 'Loomis', 'almost', 'as', 'evil', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'just', 'different', 'way.Needless', 'say', 'only', 'gave', 'movie', 'rating', 'one', ""n't"", 'lower', 'rating', 'give', 'Amazon', 'Save', 'money', 'buy', 'one', 'following', 'horror', 'movies', 'original', 'Halloween', 'series', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Friday', '13th', 'Hellraiser', 'Camp', 'Sleepaway']",N/A
1291222,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B002V3HT2G,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","The film should have opened with:WHITE HORSE - Since my wife's character .. I mean, ... a main character was killed off in the first film, I will quote some mumbo-jumbo excerpt from ""The Subconscious Psychosis of Dreams"" and have my wife .. I mean, a lead actress, portray an important character that influences another important character in this film. She will be dressed in white.. just because... and we'll throw in a white horse.. just because. She will continue to reappear throughout this film until all of the filmed footage is used.-Excerpt fromMy Journal .. I mean ...""The Subconscious Psychosis of blah-blah""Moving on...When this film was released back in 2009, it was butchered (no pun intended) by the critics and most of the audience. I, personally, do not care because I actually like it and prefer it over Zombie's original re-visioning of ""Halloween"". This sequel is brutal, unsettling, ghastly and it moves at a pretty brisk pace (well, at least one of the versions does... more on this later). Admittedly, I prefer the theatrical version but this unrated Director's cut offers some interesting additional footage and in my opinion, a very disappointing climax. Also note, that this version is not exactly scarier or bloodier. It is longer with revisions to timelines and characters. Most of the additional scenes deal with Laurie Strode's mental anguish. Also thrown in are a lot of unnecessary footage of Mikey and Rob Zombie's wife. For the horror nut, watch both versions and decide which one you like (or detest) better.This grisly sequel opens with a brief flashback of a young Michael and his mother that introduces the ""White Horse"" theme, a reoccurring theme for the duration of the film. The film then cuts to a shocked and wounded Laurie Strode, who aimlessly walks through an empty street in Haddonfield, having survived a near fatal confrontation with Michael. She is taken to the hospital where the diabolical Michael follows and I guess you can guess what happens there. The rest of the film does not even remotely resemble 1981's ""Halloween II"". Zombie did not try to imitate it and despite a brief scene taking place in the hospital, the rest of the film goes to places the original did not. Laurie Strode, because of her past traumatic experience, is clearly messed up seeking the help of a therapist (played by an almost unrecognizable Lois Lane.. I mean, Margot Kidder) while Dr. Loomis, shamelessly tries to cash in on the tragedy of the Haddonfield massacre by writing a tell-all book which reveals the truth about Myers and his connection to Strode.The tone of the film is much darker than Zombie's ""Halloween"" and the executions here are explicit. Whatever built up anger Michael possessed is unleashed here. I mean, talk about overkill. The man really has a bone to pick with these people. In some of the kill sequences, I honestly had to look away. The characters here are also very different than what we were used to seeing in the original film and its sequel. Here the characters are raw and emotionally, they are cut open. We see them in their entirety. This is where the unrated version may offer a bit more substance, at least to those who have the patience and are not annoyed by multiple scenes of a constantly whining leading lady. Although Strode is exposed as a disturbed, confrontational young woman and a far cry from the shy, good girl Laurie played by Jamie Lee Curtis in both versions, it is in the unrated version where we fully see her downward spiral and extremely abrasive demeanor. Taylor-Compton's Laurie is not as likeable but it is understandable why she is such a hot mess. Danielle Harris who plays her friend Annie, is a more vulnerable, likeable character but she too has a rough edge. Whenever she is on screen, we see the ravages of her previous encounter with Myers across her pretty face. She remains the most sympathetic character in this film. Brad Dourif who plays Sheriff Brackett is also great here and like Harris, is given a bit more depth. I am used to seeing Dourrif play outrageous psycho characters. Here, he is far more human.The film is not without its flaws. Although I warmed up to the ""white horse"" theme, it may appear silly to some. Zombie does permeate the films' surroundings with his usual unappealing flair - lots of swearing, some pretty horrible dialogue, unsavory main/supporting characters. As stated, I prefer the theatrical release. It is edited better, omitting unnecessary or pointless scenes fixing its pacing issues. The murder sequences are no less explicit and the climax is far more satisfying. Here Zombie simply added too much of Strode's emotional turmoil. There are far too many scenes of her loosing it. Whatever pity we may have felt for her slowly diminishes and by the time she is finally reunited with Michael, we are wanting him to silence her whining once and for all. I also do not think it was a good idea in showing us Myer's much too human face clearly in several frames. It takes away from this monsters magic and mythology. It didn't work for me in the first film and it certainly doesn't work for me here. With all of that said, as a slasher movie, it delivers.""Halloween II"" (2009) is not for everyone. Those who are not a fan of Rob Zombie need to stay away. The squeamish or those with faint hearts, I recommend you watch something not as visceral like Disney's ""Pinocchio"". This fable is a dark one. It is sick, twisted, and brutal to the core. As I already stated, I prefer the sequel over Zombie's original vision of the Halloween legend and I will forever remain unapologetic.The picture quality is good as is the sound. The version comes with a lot of extras that should please the fans. If you prefer the theatrical version, I recommend the Double Feature DVD that includes both Zombie's ""Halloween"" (2007) and ""Halloween II"". There are no extras but the films look good and is very affordable. If you are a completist like me and enjoy these films despite their short-comings, get them all and pleasant dreams.Halloween II (Theatrical) *** 1/2Halloween II (Unrated) ***",3,Michael Needs to Put

This movie could be classified under the 'torture porn' category (this is not a good thing). Rent it if you must, but don't spend the money buying it.

It never happened, then came the re-envisioned first Halloween.  I loved Rob's House of a Thousand Corpses and Devil's Rejects so when I saw the first one, my mind was blown. I like opening my mind to new ideas, a new take on my favorite Horror movie.  Like most, I was dying for Rob's Halloween 2, I missed the theatrical release (long story) so it was even worse to wait for the Blu-ray to come out.Zombie did it again, right when I thought I had an idea of what he was going to do, he elevates the story. The beginning was very cool with reflections of the original Halloween 2 and then made it just a nightmare. LOVED THAT! Why?  Because now I didn't know what was going to happen.  Making Laurie mentally/emotionally lose it was brilliant, I  mean how could that onslaught from Michael in the first movie not do that to any sane person?Loved the Sheriff bringing Laurie into his home and of course watching how Annie and Laurie's relationship fall apart due to what happened to them.  The ending was beautiful, Rob knew what to do with his story version and how to give it great closure.  Not sure why people hated how Loomis turned out, I loved the original but this Loomis is not the same character.  Fame got to his head, Rob showed flaws in Loomis. Nice touch.Also Michael is a nut case, why wouldn't he imagine himself as a kid and talking to his mother?  It fit this version of Halloween.  Over all, it was a great fresh surprise in Halloween 2. It makes me sad that it's done for Zombie but I also didn't want ten sequels.Thank you Rob for this version of Michael Myers, I loved the original and this version, sits right next to it in my heart of Horrors.",5,"Wow, done in two movies.

1291228,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B002V3HT2G,Gregorio,"[1, 3]","The directors cut of Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN 2 is certainly the finest film in the series since John Carpenter's original film.  I didn't think Zombie's original remake was exceptional, although it was miles ahead of most of the garbage remakes we are being subjected to by the likes of Michael Bay and his wretched cohorts at Platinum Dunes. Based on bad word of mouth from friends and reviewers I decided to skip this film in the theatres and check it out when the video was released.  I watched it at a friends house last night and this morning got out of bed and rushed to the store to buy my own copy.  This was so much more than I expected it to be, in fact I would suggest that it is the finest sequel to a slasher film ever made, and certainly the most artfully photographed.I can full understand why those wanting nothing more than a remake of the original HALLOWEEN 2 would have problems with this film, and I can also relate to the problems people have with changing a beloved horror icon into something new and different, but the changes Zombie has made have truly brought new life and a new (and far more original) direction to this series.  Michael Myers is now far more frightening without his mask than he is with it.I rarely have any emotional connection to the characters and events in a horror film but Rob Zombie pulled a lot of emotions out of me with this one, in particular the stunning ending of the film.  David Lynch has never composed amore beautiful sequence than the one that ends this film.  All of the scenes that feature Shari Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers are exceptionally beautiful and there is something quite wonderful about seeing her family reunited in this film. / I think it would also take a viewer with a very hard heart not to be moved by the scene where Sheriff Brackett (played very well indeed by Brad Dourif) discovers the body of Annie (Danielle Harris).HALLOWEEN 2 manages to be beautiful and ugly at the same time.  Zombie shot the film on 16mm stock and it looks pretty good in most scenes.  Surreal images abound in this and of particular interest is the ""dinner party"" which is unlike anything I've seen before.  I don't know where Zombie gets his ideas (and I'm glad such ideas don't come to me) but they are truly original.Most of the cast is excellent and in addition to Moon, Harris and Douriff, we get wonderful performances from Margot Kidder, Howard Hessman and Bill Faggerbach (spelling?).  Alas, not all of the cast is great.  Malcolm McDowell (miscast in both of these films) is distractingly over the top and the repulsive Scout Taylor-Compton screams, cries and pouts her way through this one and becomes so unlikable that I'm really ready for Michael to cut her open from top to bottom long before the end of the film.  These are serious complaints but I can live with them because everything else in this film works so beautifully.In response to those who complain that Rob Zombie is ruining the HALLOWEEN franchise, I can only wonder if they have ever watched HALLOWEEN 5, or HALLOWEEN:RESSURECTION (a film so relentlessly awful that I have only watched it twice in my life and never intend to watch it again . . . now that was a film that could wreck a franchise).  The original HALLOWEEN and all of the sequels are still right there on your shelf, ready to be watched whenever you feel like it and they will be exactly as you remember them.  Rob Zombie can not change those films one bit.  If you don't like what he has done with his versions, don't buy them or watch them.So what is on the disc?  Not as much as the other three Zombie films have had.  There is a highly entertaining commentary track from Zombie (his commentaries are always informative and interesting), some very poor deleted scenes (a half hours worth), some bloopers, several clever music videos of Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures (the band playing at the party in the film) and a dumb unedited Stand-up routine of Uncle Seymore (the guy with the teeth on stage at the party).  The extras are the same on both the DVD and the BluRay and since this is a rather messy looking, grainy film, it is perhaps safe to save your money and buy the DVD rather than the Bluray disc, as the poor film stock is highlighted in higher resolution.  Sony/Dimension decided to really rape viewers by not including both theatrical and director cuts on one disc and forcing them to be bought seperately by those who want to have both versions.  Money grubbing bastards.While this isn't a perfect film, it is certainly far above average, and a real surprise in this day of inept remakes and idiotic sequels and Michael Bay films.

That doesn't mean that the movie is bad.  My main problems with the movie are how dark the picture is (there are several scenes where you can't really see what's going on. It's all part of Zombie's direction though, which is good in it's own way) and the ""reviving"" of several characters that were victims of Michael Myers' previous killing spree in ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"". For example, Dr. Loomis is a prominent figure in ""Halloween II"". I seem to remember the end of ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"" when Loomis has his eyes CRUSHED INSIDE HIS SKULL by Michael Myers. Even if you firmly believe in suspension of disbelief, which I do, it is very far-fetched that Loomis would survive such an attack, let alone regain his sight for this sequel  (and yes, I know that Loomis is seen alive after the attack in ""Rob Zombie's Halloween""... that's too far-fetched as well). Too unbelievable, even for a horror movie. I also didn't really care for the dream sequences, they seem kinda corny and are used as simple filler material at times to provide some lengthy Myers' killing scenes, seemingly to take up time. I think the script was probably short to begin with and was difficult to stretch into a 90 minute movie, thus the dream sequences.  I really don't like Scout-Taylor Compton's acting, and unfortunately, the entire movie centers around her character, Lorrie Strode.  I have heard some people review this movie and say, ""This is Rob Zombie's best film yet.""  That's not true at all.  It's his worst if you have to pick a spot for it. Again, that doesn't make it bad. The movie doesn't skimp on violence at all, as this sequel is as brutal as any other Rob Zombie film, thus far at least.

He should have done another movie with his ideas and left Michael Myers completely out of his idea for a new Halloween because it just doesn't work at all. I doubt they will be asking him to do another Halloween movie since this one bombed so bad. I AM very happy I didn't pay theatre price for this trash. Thank god for netflix.,1,Horrible!

1291235,A1BG88N69Q7W1S,B002V3HT2G,"imafunker2 ""miamiderek""","[1, 1]","First off, let me say that i've been a big fan of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" since I first saw it in 1980. Parts 2-wherever they left off...not so much. But i've always believed strongly that the original was, and is, one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Carpenter understood that mounds of gore and constant 'false' scares (the cat jumps out of the closet, etc) did nothing for a film's fear factor-in fact, the director is always far more important than the content. If you don't believe that, watch Hitchcock's ""Psycho""...then watch the remake. If you can stay awake through it.That being said, there's room in the genre for an artist that liberally piles on the carnage and shocks, as long as that artist has a vision beyond his potential paycheck for the inevitable sequel(s). Once I saw Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", I felt certain that the innovative musician had truly found his niche. He successfully created a film that could truly be called the only other possible compliment one can bestow upon a horror movie besides 'terrifying'...that compliment being 'disturbing'.Naturally, when i heard Carpenter's classic would be getting the old 'revision' treatment, I was mildly angry. Does EVERY good-to-great motion picture need to be re-enacted for the attention deficient generation? Still, at the announcement of Zombie being given the honors, I had to assume that an essence of actual quality was likely. I also felt a bit saddened for the former 'White Zombie' frontman-just as 'Rejects' had introduced a potentially potent new force in the horror film industry, i knew there was no better way to knock people off your bandwagon than screwing up a beloved classic, especially one made by the equally admired Carpenter.But once I finally decided to check out Mr. Zombie's remake, some 4 years after it's release, I was surprised, even shocked. This was one 're-imagining' that actually lived up to that oft-used, rarely-enacted word. Succinctly put, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" scared the bodily fluids out of me. It picked up where ""Devil's Rejects"" had left off in the 'disturbing' department. Monumentally graphic, but exuding a confidence lacking from other 'unstoppable serial killer of horny teenagers' flicks, I viewed each ensuing scene with dread-the good kind. By the time it was over, sleep was but a distant fantasy. Basically, it freaked me out.So I found myself almost eager to check out Zombie's version of ""Halloween II""-as little as I cared for the original film with the same title, I assumed the lack of high standards to live up to would just loosen the director's reigns even more. And after a brutally violent first act, which mostly took place in the hospital that housed poor Laurie Strode, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Zombie wasn't going to follow that cliched, limiting format that so hurt the original ""II""-that is, the action remaining inside the hospital for the movie's duration.Imagine my disappointment when, as the film dragged on, it gradually dawned on me that Zombie, in fact, had no grand vision to display. With each increasingly violent murder, it became obvious that Zombie had fallen into the ol' 'crazy masked psycho' trap-that is, depending on the audience's visceral reaction to the bloody massacres onscreen to mask the absence of any real imagination or creativity.Unlike his previous Michael Myers treatment, I had no such reservations about going to sleep once the final credits had rolled. It wasn't awful-there were some genuinely original and shocking moments scattered amongst the dreck; but the final verdict is in, and it's clear that Rob Zombie took the money and ran. Hopefully, it won't damage what i feel is still a very bright future, and will only exist as a blip on the road to horrifying greatness for the only director who can be called 'More human than human'.",2,Even the remakes catch sequel-itis...,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,3859,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'first', 'saw', '1980', 'Parts', '2-wherever', 'left', 'off', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'i', ""'ve"", 'always', 'believed', 'strongly', 'original', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Carpenter', 'understood', 'mounds', 'gore', 'constant', ""'false"", 'scares', 'cat', 'closet', 'etc', 'did', 'nothing', 'film', 'fear', 'factor-in', 'fact', 'director', 'always', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'content', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watch', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'then', 'watch', 'remake', 'can', 'stay', 'awake', 'it.That', 'being', 'said', 'room', 'genre', 'artist', 'liberally', 'carnage', 'shocks', 'as', 'long', 'artist', 'vision', 'potential', 'paycheck', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 's', 'Once', 'saw', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'felt', 'certain', 'innovative', 'musician', 'had', 'truly', 'found', 'niche', 'successfully', 'created', 'film', 'could', 'truly', 'be', 'called', 'only', 'other', 'possible', 'compliment', 'one', 'can', 'bestow', 'horror', 'movie', ""'terrifying"", 'compliment', 'being', ""'disturbing'.Naturally"", 'when', 'i', 'heard', 'Carpenter', 'classic', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'old', ""'revision"", 'treatment', 'was', 'mildly', 'angry', 'good-to-great', 'motion', 'picture', 'need', 'be', 're-enacted', 'attention', 'deficient', 'generation', 'Still', 'announcement', 'Zombie', 'being', 'given', 'honors', 'had', 'assume', 'essence', 'actual', 'quality', 'was', 'likely', 'also', 'felt', 'bit', 'saddened', 'former', 'Zombie', 'frontman-just', ""'Rejects"", 'had', 'introduced', 'potentially', 'potent', 'new', 'force', 'horror', 'film', 'industry', 'i', 'knew', 'was', 'better', 'way', 'knock', 'people', 'bandwagon', 'screwing', 'up', 'beloved', 'classic', 'especially', 'one', 'made', 'equally', 'admired', 'Carpenter.But', 'once', 'finally', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Zombie', 'remake', '4', 'years', 'release', 'was', 'surprised', 'even', 'shocked', 'was', 'one', ""'re-imagining"", 'actually', 'lived', 'up', 'oft-used', 'rarely-enacted', 'word', 'Succinctly', 'put', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'scared', 'bodily', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'had', 'left', 'off', ""'disturbing"", 'department', 'Monumentally', 'graphic', 'exuding', 'confidence', 'lacking', 'other', ""'unstoppable"", 'serial', 'killer', 'horny', 'teenagers', 'flicks', 'viewed', 'ensuing', 'scene', 'dread-the', 'good', 'kind', 'time', 'was', 'over', 'sleep', 'was', 'distant', 'fantasy', 'Basically', 'freaked', 'found', 'almost', 'eager', 'check', 'out', 'Zombie', 'version', 'Halloween', 'II', '-as', 'little', 'cared', 'original', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'assumed', 'lack', 'high', 'standards', 'live', 'up', 'would', 'just', 'loosen', 'director', 'reigns', 'even', 'more', 'brutally', 'violent', 'first', 'act', 'mostly', 'took', 'place', 'hospital', 'housed', 'poor', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'Zombie', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'follow', 'cliched', 'limiting', 'format', 'so', 'hurt', 'original', 'II', 'action', 'remaining', 'hospital', 'movie', 'duration.Imagine', 'disappointment', 'when', 'film', 'dragged', 'gradually', 'dawned', 'Zombie', 'fact', 'had', 'grand', 'vision', 'display', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'murder', 'became', 'obvious', 'Zombie', 'had', 'fallen', 'ol', 'masked', 'psycho', 'trap-that', 'depending', 'audience', 'visceral', 'reaction', 'bloody', 'onscreen', 'mask', 'absence', 'real', 'imagination', 'creativity.Unlike', 'previous', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'treatment', 'had', 'such', 'reservations', 'going', 'sleep', 'once', 'final', 'credits', 'had', 'rolled', 'was', ""n't"", 'awful-there', 'were', 'genuinely', 'original', 'shocking', 'moments', 'scattered', 'dreck', 'final', 'verdict', 'clear', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'took', 'money', 'ran', 'Hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'damage', 'what', 'i', 'feel', 'still', 'very', 'bright', 'future', 'will', 'only', 'exist', 'blip', 'road', 'horrifying', 'greatness', 'only', 'director', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'called', ""'More"", 'human', 'human']",N/A

1291237,A319SKSB556033,B002V3HT2G,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[5, 9]","I've always rooted for the underdog movies, movies that very few people like or are victims of popular misconceptions (RoboCop 2, Hudson Hawk, Waterworld). But never in my life have I known a film to be on the receiving end of so much anger and undeserved hate than Rob Zombie's Halloween II.Zombie didn't want to do the movie. He'd killed off Michael and that was that. But the studio went ahead with a sequel regardless, and he figured that if a sequel was going to be made then he should be the one calling the shots instead of someone else who might deviate from his vision.Many were furious over his desecration of John Carpenter's original. I wasn't. I thought it was entertaining...but pointless. Zombie (and the makers of all the original sequels) just didn't grasp the fact that the minimalism and purity of the 1978 movie is what made it stand out. Copious amounts of back-story did nothing but bore me to death.But the 1981 Halloween II was hardly sacred ground. Though it took place on the same night as the first the series had already degenerated into pure drudgery and sank even further from there. Zombie's Halloween II pays homage with the first 10 minutes but goes off into a brand new tangent following his own imagination.His huge liberties with the Michael Myers mythology and rules may have offended fans, but after 31 years of keeping him in the dark it was time to bring the brutal ugliness into the light. This is hardcore slasher material. Compared to this the 80s and 90s sequels are PG family films. Violence and death in real life are not pretty, cool to look at, or bloodless. I'm sick of slasher films that are so clean and sterilized that they make murder look hygienic and harmless. What kind of message is THAT sending out?Zombie has delivered, without a doubt, the most visually striking Halloween film yet. I wasn't too impressed with his editing or cinematography style in the 2007 movie. Carpenter shot his film in anamorphic Panavision and stuck with the format ever since. But Zombie opted for ugly Super 35, which gave his film-making style a garish, MTV feel. This time around he shoots in grainy 16mm and keeps the camera right in front of the carnage, keeping it in our faces. He also grinds raw, emotional performances out of his cast, especially Scout Taylor-Compton and Brad Dourif.The hate, the anger, the condemnation...it's all completely unjustified. None of the original sequels were this bold, daring or imaginative. When it comes to drawn out franchises (especially horror films) there are frequent complaints of ""same old, same old"". But as soon as a sequel that DOES break the mold comes across it's torn apart for being too different.It's our inability to make up our minds over what we really want in movies that pushes studios into making so much inoffensive garbage. Honestly, if you're the kind of person who likes Twilight then you really have no business watching this film.The Blu Ray features the 119-minute Director's Cut of the film which several added scenes and a completely different ending. It's a much stronger film than the theatrical cut (which was still good) and if you're going to buy Halloween II it's best to buy this version. The 1080p picture is framed at 1.85:1 and is very grainy, but since this is the way the film was intended to look you can't blame it for not looking like Pixar. The sound design is loud and aggressive and there is a decent amount of extras.",4,Nothing hallowed about this eve,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,3446,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'rooted', 'underdog', 'movies', 'movies', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'victims', 'popular', 'misconceptions', 'RoboCop', '2', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'Waterworld', 'never', 'life', 'have', 'known', 'film', 'be', 'receiving', 'end', 'so', 'much', 'anger', 'undeserved', 'hate', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'II.Zombie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'movie', ""'d"", 'killed', 'off', 'Michael', 'was', 'studio', 'went', 'ahead', 'sequel', 'regardless', 'figured', 'sequel', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'calling', 'shots', 'instead', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'might', 'deviate', 'vision.Many', 'were', 'furious', 'desecration', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'pointless', 'Zombie', 'makers', 'original', 'sequels', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'fact', 'minimalism', 'purity', '1978', 'movie', 'what', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'Copious', 'amounts', 'back-story', 'did', 'nothing', 'death.But', '1981', 'Halloween', 'II', 'was', 'hardly', 'sacred', 'ground', 'took', 'place', 'same', 'night', 'first', 'series', 'had', 'already', 'degenerated', 'pure', 'drudgery', 'sank', 'even', 'further', 'there', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'II', 'homage', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'off', 'brand', 'new', 'tangent', 'following', 'own', 'imagination.His', 'huge', 'liberties', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'mythology', 'rules', 'may', 'have', 'offended', 'fans', '31', 'years', 'keeping', 'dark', 'was', 'time', 'bring', 'brutal', 'ugliness', 'light', 'hardcore', 'slasher', 'material', 'Compared', '80s', '90s', 'sequels', 'are', 'PG', 'family', 'films', 'Violence', 'death', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'not', 'pretty', 'cool', 'look', 'bloodless', ""'m"", 'sick', 'slasher', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'clean', 'sterilized', 'make', 'murder', 'look', 'hygienic', 'harmless', 'What', 'kind', 'message', 'sending', 'out', 'Zombie', 'delivered', 'doubt', 'most', 'visually', 'striking', 'Halloween', 'film', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'style', '2007', 'movie', 'Carpenter', 'shot', 'film', 'anamorphic', 'Panavision', 'stuck', 'format', 'ever', 'Zombie', 'opted', 'ugly', 'Super', '35', 'gave', 'film-making', 'style', 'garish', 'MTV', 'feel', 'time', 'grainy', '16mm', 'camera', 'right', 'front', 'carnage', 'keeping', 'also', 'raw', 'emotional', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'Brad', 'Dourif.The', 'hate', 'anger', 'condemnation', 'completely', 'unjustified', 'None', 'original', 'sequels', 'were', 'bold', 'daring', 'imaginative', 'When', 'drawn', 'out', 'franchises', 'especially', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'frequent', 'complaints', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'as', 'soon', 'sequel', 'break', 'mold', 'torn', 'apart', 'being', 'too', 'different.It', 'inability', 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'movies', 'studios', 'making', 'so', 'much', 'inoffensive', 'garbage', 'Honestly', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'Twilight', 'then', 'really', 'have', 'business', 'watching', 'film.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', '119-minute', 'Director', 'Cut', 'film', 'several', 'added', 'scenes', 'completely', 'different', 'ending', 'much', 'stronger', 'film', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'was', 'still', 'good', ""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'Halloween', 'II', 'best', 'buy', 'version', '1080p', 'picture', 'framed', '1.85:1', 'very', 'grainy', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'look', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'not', 'looking', 'Pixar', 'sound', 'design', 'loud', 'aggressive', 'decent', 'amount', 'extras']",N/A

I am very sad that I have to say this about his 2 different films Halloween 2 theatrical with better ending.Spoilers alert read no further if you haven't seen the director's cut! The directors cut has more gore as suspected and more nudity. Also it has more of Rob's famous seventy's exploitation style! Both versions are entirely different films in an effort to make more money. This is from a huge fan! The theatrical version has John Carpender's theme and is a better film, more 80's style. I prefer Halloween movies with the only scary parts included suspense,(Rob only had that with his first movie, House of a thousand corpses! The directors cut has great stuff but no theme or suspense just plenty of shock and gore more disturbing images and I think more nudity. Rob is an innovator of what's been done before, but not since the seventy's. Italian directors such as, Joe D'mato, Dadanto, and others have out gored him but those films weren't received well in the States, Unfortunately even Argento's and Bava's movies are better than this. I love you Rob but I had to write this review because you tried to cash out in a bad economy! Both films are great horror films and to the point, but why do the true fans have to buy 2 of the same film. Rob, you should have packaged this differently, it's not fare to fans, like myself.PS.

I know this film has been getting bagged by a lot of people who saw this movie, but I really don't understand why I thought this movie was incredibly good of a film. Reviews have been saying how this movie sucked but it didn't they only saw it once, this movie is more complicated and deeper than you would think. But seriously watch this film again but make sure it's the unrated director's cut.I really like the way Rob Zombie made the characters change from the first Halloween remake to this movie. Rob Zombie really opened up the dark side of Laurie Strode because it's a more realistic movie and I have to give Scout Taylor Compton some props for playing the part so well. I also have to congradulate Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and sheriff Brackett played by Brad Douraf they both did an amazing job with there characters.The only problems I had with this film is 1.

1291245,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B002V3HT2G,Jean-ren Leroux,"[2, 4]","""Halloween 2"" is an intelligent failure. The obviously talented and wise Rob Zombie, in my humble opinion, saw too big for his tail of a mute and ineffable human wreck who wants to kill his sister in order to bring her back to his ghostly family. You simply can't put too much layers of metaphores into something that doens't allow it. The leitmotiv of the white horse, the visions of the mother and little Michael shared by both Laurie and the big Michael, all this falls flat. A little more and you'd start hearing a voice-over. It's easy to see that Mr. Zombie wanted it to be his ""Blade Runner"".I really wanted to like ""Halloween 2"". Rob Zombie's course as a horror filmmaker is an interresting and promising one. His first and subsequent movies weren't necessarily perfect but they did show a sensible, yet twisted and demented, artist with a true vision and a thing or two to say. In interviews or within his own documentaries, you see him as a cunning and visionary author who truly has his characters and story at heart. The people he works with seems to want to go at incredible lenghts in order to please him.Here, he kept saying that he could at last be free and bring his visions to a full circle. But Michael Myers, without any emotion or lines, simply doesn't have enough ""juice"" to go on for two hours. And the other characters are either tiring, annoying (the ever so screaming Laurie), misscast or simply laughable. Brad Dourif as the sheriff and Malcom Mcdowell are probably crazier and scarier than Michael Myers, the self-centered psychologist being built as a badly-written archetype character with a cheap and clich&eacute; attempt at redemption at the end.Plus, after seing movies like ""Scream"" and others ""Horror Movie"" who made fun of all the clich&eacute;s used in horror films, you'd think that a wise person like Rob Zombie wouldn't put those clich&eacute;s in his ""serious"" movie... well, those clich&eacute;s are there all right. The killer walking calmly still managing to catch the running victims, The killer appearing out of nowhere, the victims (with a close-up on their faces) not seing the killer who's beside them simply because we, as spectators, aren't seing him either, the victims who's hidden places are revealed to the killer because they can't stop screaming, i mean heck! A bit more and they would have pull the old trick of the cat behind the door.Plus Rob Zombie, i feel, made an error of tone. In his previous movies (""House..."" and ""... Rejects""), the story allowed for quaint, hillbilly characters. Not here. It's more dark, serious and ""deep"". Therefore, The crazy and scary looking sheriff or psychologist don't fit. And Rob Zombie, although i think he is talented, has weak points nonetheless. One of those is to always put simple and stupid characters with cheap lines, like the two ambulance drivers in the beginning.The long nightmare at the start is also a perfect example of a director shooting himself in the foot. By the time we realize that it is a nightmare, we've already said ten times to ourselves that it was stupid and clich&eacute;. Even if we're going ""Oh, ok. It's a bad dream. We can start over."", the damage, i feel, is already done.I mean, the story was so small that Michael Myers needed to voluntarily make a couple of useless detours in order to kill complete innocent strangers who didn't have any link what-so-ever with the main plot, thus making these horrible kills perfectly gratuitous. Killing for the sake of killing.All in all, i'm still very curious about Rob Zombie's visions and i'm still going to follow him in his creative, yet twisted, journey as a filmmaker. ""Halloween 2"" was a ""faux pas"" but i think that ultimately, he will become better and more focused because of it.In my humble opinion of course.",1,"Can't make ""Blade Runner"" out of a mute wreck of a killer",1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,3795,"['2', 'intelligent', 'failure', 'obviously', 'talented', 'wise', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'humble', 'opinion', 'saw', 'too', 'big', 'tail', 'mute', 'ineffable', 'human', 'wreck', 'who', 'kill', 'sister', 'order', 'bring', 'back', 'ghostly', 'family', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'too', 'much', 'layers', 'metaphores', 'something', 'leitmotiv', 'white', 'horse', 'visions', 'mother', 'little', 'Michael', 'shared', 'Laurie', 'big', 'Michael', 'flat', 'little', 'more', ""'d"", 'start', 'hearing', 'voice-over', 'easy', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Zombie', 'wanted', 'be', 'Blade', 'Runner', '.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'Halloween', '2', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'course', 'horror', 'filmmaker', 'interresting', 'promising', 'one', 'first', 'subsequent', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'perfect', 'did', 'show', 'sensible', 'yet', 'twisted', 'demented', 'artist', 'true', 'vision', 'thing', 'two', 'say', 'interviews', 'own', 'documentaries', 'see', 'cunning', 'visionary', 'author', 'who', 'truly', 'characters', 'story', 'heart', 'people', 'want', 'go', 'incredible', 'lenghts', 'order', 'please', 'him.Here', 'kept', 'saying', 'could', 'last', 'be', 'free', 'bring', 'visions', 'full', 'circle', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'emotion', 'lines', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'juice', 'go', 'two', 'hours', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'tiring', 'annoying', 'ever', 'so', 'screaming', 'Laurie', 'misscast', 'simply', 'laughable', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'sheriff', 'Malcom', 'Mcdowell', 'are', 'probably', 'crazier', 'scarier', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'self-centered', 'psychologist', 'being', 'built', 'badly-written', 'archetype', 'character', 'cheap', 'clich', 'eacute', 'attempt', 'redemption', 'end.Plus', 'seing', 'movies', 'Scream', 'others', 'Horror', 'Movie', 'who', 'made', 'fun', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'used', 'horror', 'films', ""'d"", 'think', 'wise', 'person', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'serious', 'movie', 'well', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'there', 'all', 'right', 'killer', 'walking', 'calmly', 'still', 'managing', 'catch', 'running', 'victims', 'killer', 'appearing', 'nowhere', 'victims', 'close-up', 'not', 'seing', 'killer', 'who', 'beside', 'simply', 'spectators', 'are', ""n't"", 'seing', 'either', 'victims', 'who', 'hidden', 'places', 'are', 'revealed', 'killer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'screaming', 'i', 'mean', 'heck', 'bit', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'pull', 'old', 'trick', 'cat', 'door.Plus', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'i', 'feel', 'made', 'error', 'tone', 'previous', 'movies', 'House', 'Rejects', 'story', 'allowed', 'quaint', 'hillbilly', 'characters', 'Not', 'here', 'more', 'dark', 'serious', 'deep', 'Therefore', 'crazy', 'scary', 'looking', 'sheriff', 'psychologist', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'i', 'think', 'talented', 'weak', 'points', 'nonetheless', 'One', 'always', 'put', 'simple', 'stupid', 'characters', 'cheap', 'lines', 'two', 'ambulance', 'drivers', 'beginning.The', 'long', 'nightmare', 'start', 'also', 'perfect', 'example', 'director', 'shooting', 'foot', 'time', 'realize', 'nightmare', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'ten', 'times', 'ourselves', 'was', 'stupid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Even', ""'re"", 'going', 'Oh', 'ok', 'bad', 'dream', 'can', 'start', 'damage', 'i', 'feel', 'already', 'done.I', 'mean', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'small', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'needed', 'voluntarily', 'make', 'couple', 'useless', 'detours', 'order', 'kill', 'complete', 'innocent', 'strangers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'link', 'what-so-ever', 'main', 'plot', 'thus', 'making', 'horrible', 'kills', 'perfectly', 'gratuitous', 'Killing', 'sake', 'killing.All', 'i', ""'m"", 'still', 'very', 'curious', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'visions', 'i', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'follow', 'creative', 'yet', 'twisted', 'journey', 'filmmaker', 'Halloween', '2', 'was', 'faux', 'pas', 'i', 'think', 'ultimately', 'will', 'become', 'better', 'more', 'focused', 'it.In', 'humble', 'opinion', 'course']",N/A

1291250,ALTNI5BAFUAQY,B002V3HT2G,"Jery Tillotson ""cult author""","[8, 14]","Rob Zombie is now officially the master of horrible horror.Like hack director Michael Bay, he no longer makes original movies. He just searches through the titles of great horror franchises of the past, grabs one and then ""reinvents"" the classic, knowing that it'll make a fast buck on its opening weekend, helped by internet hype, and sucking in the fanboys and horror buffs (like myself.)At the rate he and Bay are going, they'll be forced to remake their own remakes--or, and this would be revolutionary--attempt to make an original thriller--something we haven't seen in many a moon. As it is, we've been deluged with hideous remakes (Asian horror, classic horror and sci-fi) and endless sequels and prequels.H2 is filmed so darkly, against such turgid, slimy backdrops and interiors, you literally experience the sensation of watching a movie where the camera was placed in an unwashed toilet bowl. Wardrobes are so hideous, with all the females sporting frizzed and mangy hairstyles you can only cringe when they have sex.Laurie, portrayed by the totally uncharismatic Scout Taylo-Compton, has almost zero dialogue, except for the F____ word that she spews out with gusto at regular intervals. The rest of the the time she shrieks, screams, blubbers, wails, keens, convulses without end. She looks like an animated corpse throughout with the worse hair (matted and strawlike) wardrobe (greasy looking ""punk"") and make-up (gray and sweaty)of any horror heroine in recent history.There's no character to sympathize with. You've only got Zombie's usual gallery of deadbeats, skanky women and redneck morons.  Whenever one of the male idiots encounters the monster, they make the terminal mistake of ""messing with him."" His seven foot size doesn't appear to warn them of a lethal reaction.  After cursing at him or breaking something over his head, he comes after them. As the retards they are, they don't move away. They just stand there to be pulverized.One of those who pays for his disrepect, has one line of dialogue that should result in an Academy Award for Best Script. As he lays all bloodied and dying, he mutters for five minutes:""F___, F___, F__, F___, F___, F___, etc.""Maybe this is what dying neanderthals utter before they go to that big outhouse in the sky.Whenever the hulking Michael Myers monster goes on the attack, he fast becomes a bore. He stabs and stabs until you're falling asleep. And you know that no tsunami of bullets or being run over by cars or blazing infernoes will keep him down.Probably the most confusing device used by Zombie are the dream sequences. The movie begins with a ten minute long dream, Laurie awakens, and then she dreams again and again as the movie progresses.  We're also supposed to figure out the presence of the ghosts of Michael Myers mother and him as a boy.  Towards the end, Laurie goes into another endless convulsion of spasms. It goes on so long, like seeing someone learning how to perform the St. Vitus dance, that you are not surprised that she ends up in her favorite place: a hospital.Before H2 was released last week, Rob Zombie announced he will start filming yet another horror/sci-fi classic: The Blob. Is everyone leaping into the air with wild applause and hysteria? Someone should whisper into his ear that after he ruins The Blob, there are yet other horror franchises he should consider remaking: Saw, Frankenstein&lt; Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy, The Invisible Man--that is if Michael Bay doesn't grab them first.",1,Zombie Holocaust:II,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,3497,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 'now', 'officially', 'master', 'horrible', 'horror.Like', 'hack', 'director', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'no', 'longer', 'original', 'movies', 'just', 'titles', 'great', 'horror', 'franchises', 'past', 'grabs', 'one', 'then', 'reinvents', 'classic', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'make', 'fast', 'buck', 'opening', 'weekend', 'helped', 'internet', 'hype', 'sucking', 'fanboys', 'horror', 'buffs', 'rate', 'Bay', 'are', 'going', ""'ll"", 'be', 'forced', 'remake', 'own', 'remakes', 'would', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'attempt', 'make', 'original', 'thriller', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'moon', ""'ve"", 'been', 'deluged', 'hideous', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'classic', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'endless', 'sequels', 'prequels.H2', 'filmed', 'so', 'darkly', 'such', 'turgid', 'slimy', 'backdrops', 'interiors', 'literally', 'experience', 'sensation', 'watching', 'movie', 'where', 'camera', 'was', 'placed', 'unwashed', 'toilet', 'bowl', 'are', 'so', 'hideous', 'females', 'sporting', 'frizzed', 'mangy', 'hairstyles', 'can', 'only', 'cringe', 'when', 'have', 'sex.Laurie', 'portrayed', 'totally', 'uncharismatic', 'Scout', 'Taylo-Compton', 'almost', 'zero', 'dialogue', 'F____', 'word', 'out', 'gusto', 'regular', 'intervals', 'rest', 'time', 'screams', 'blubbers', 'wails', 'keens', 'convulses', 'end', 'animated', 'corpse', 'worse', 'hair', 'matted', 'strawlike', 'wardrobe', 'greasy', 'looking', 'punk', 'make-up', 'gray', 'sweaty', 'horror', 'heroine', 'recent', 'character', 'sympathize', ""'ve"", 'only', 'got', 'Zombie', 'usual', 'gallery', 'deadbeats', 'skanky', 'women', 'redneck', 'morons', 'Whenever', 'one', 'male', 'idiots', 'monster', 'make', 'terminal', 'mistake', 'messing', 'seven', 'foot', 'size', ""n't"", 'appear', 'warn', 'lethal', 'reaction', 'cursing', 'breaking', 'something', 'head', 'retards', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'away', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'be', 'pulverized.One', 'who', 'pays', 'disrepect', 'one', 'line', 'dialogue', 'should', 'result', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Script', 'bloodied', 'dying', 'five', 'minutes', 'F___', 'F___', 'F__', 'F___', 'F___', 'F___', 'etc', 'Maybe', 'what', 'dying', 'neanderthals', 'utter', 'go', 'big', 'outhouse', 'sky.Whenever', 'hulking', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'monster', 'attack', 'fast', 'bore', 'stabs', 'stabs', ""'re"", 'falling', 'asleep', 'know', 'tsunami', 'bullets', 'being', 'run', 'over', 'cars', 'blazing', 'infernoes', 'will', 'keep', 'down.Probably', 'most', 'confusing', 'device', 'used', 'Zombie', 'are', 'dream', 'sequences', 'movie', 'ten', 'minute', 'long', 'dream', 'Laurie', 'then', 'again', 'again', 'movie', ""'re"", 'also', 'supposed', 'figure', 'out', 'presence', 'ghosts', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'mother', 'boy', 'end', 'Laurie', 'endless', 'convulsion', 'spasms', 'so', 'long', 'seeing', 'someone', 'learning', 'how', 'perform', 'St.', 'Vitus', 'dance', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'up', 'favorite', 'place', 'hospital.Before', 'H2', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'week', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'announced', 'will', 'start', 'filming', 'yet', 'horror/sci-fi', 'classic', 'Blob', 'everyone', 'leaping', 'air', 'wild', 'applause', 'hysteria', 'Someone', 'should', 'whisper', 'ear', 'Blob', 'are', 'yet', 'other', 'horror', 'should', 'consider', 'remaking', 'Saw', 'Frankenstein', 'lt', 'Dracula', 'Wolfman', 'Mummy', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Michael', 'Bay', ""n't"", 'grab', 'first']",N/A
1291251,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B002V3HT2G,J from NY,"[1, 2]","Let's start out by admitting that Rob Zombie creates a kind of pornography of violence in every film he makes.  There HAS to be, at all times and everywhere, a woman getting stabbed, psychopathic characters (and not just Michael or whatever killer he's schmoozing about) breaking each others' necks, etc.  That's what his shtick is.I don't deny that he's creative, but the impulses behind his creativity are limited.  He wants to paint a landscape of evil, white trash, corruption and just anything depraved at all, and he does it: but it's so excessive and over the top that I can't take him seriously.  And I'm kind of glad.I liked the nod he gave to Herk Harvey and ""Carnival of Souls"" with this one and the supernatural element added to Michael, but where is the Passion of Dr. Loomis?  Malcolm McDowell was wasted in the first one but he is *especially* wasted in this one.  I longed for Donald Pleasance as Zombie takes us on pointless book signings and celebrity rides with a corrupt, fame hungry Dr. Loomis (the point Rob Zombie wants to make is thus: there are no heroes.  There will be no Van Helsing to Michael's Dracula as there were in the originals.  Everything and everyone is corrupt in my movies, and if they aren't, they're ineffectual.  Like Brad Dourif as the sherrif. When Brad Dourif is the only good guy in the movie, you know you're in a bad landscape.)Michael GRUNTING?  Are you KIDDING ME?  Where is the subtlety, the REALLY scary motherf**ker we saw in Halloween 2 who doesn't make a sound and strikes like a quiet serpent?  What is this goofball mask about that exposes half his face?  You can talk about nostalgia and creative liberty all you want, but the simple fact of the matter is that this does not live up to the original sequel one iota.  It's goofball fun.  The only thing that was fun about it was the general celebration of the horror genre going on in the background, like at the party scene. Halloween 5 sucked, so what was the point of bringing that actress back?  Rob's private nostalgia?  And the ending!  I was hoping Zombie would show us his true colors as an artist with a real resurrection of Michael's terror, but again, he had to rob the ending of another movie to get by.

Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcom Mcdowell) has been doing the latest book based on Michael Myers's mental history including updating it about the incidents that happened two years ago and believes in his mind that Michael is dead, unfortunately the shape still lives in the outskirts of town as he sees supernatural visions of his mother (Sheri-Moon Zombie) telling him to kill.Fair sequel to Rob Zombie's unneccessary but enjoyable remake of ""Halloween"" from John Carpenter. This one isn't a remake of the underrated 1981 Halloween 2 but more in name-only except with a few homages to the original part 2 such as the hospital but done in a nightmare. The film features suprises appearences by Weird Al Yankovich and Caroline Willaims (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) just for the fans, it's very entertaining but feels like a jumbled mess at times. There's too much white-trash in this one which i think Zombie has a foundness for except that it was done well in his first two movies which were great but not for the Halloween series. And feels too much like a Friday The 13th then an actual movie on the Halloween franchise, there's also too much vulgarity which sounds like the kind that the Full Metal Jacket drill Sgt would say with graphic gory violence. All in all it's not bad for a sequel but i think Rob Zombie had enough of Halloween and will make one more remake called The Blob then back to doing original stuff like his dream project ""Tyranosaurous Rex"", although ""Haunted World of El Superbeasto"" made up for this one.This Blu-Ray offers the film in it's unrated director's cut featuring never-before-seen footage not shown in theaters with perfected picture including awesome sound.

XFL, meant to improve on the traditional NFL. Like Vince, Zombie falls flat on his face!What a total waste of effort(??)! Forget the obviously lame storyline! Zombie has taken the BEST parts of what I & others loved of John Carpenter's masterpiece and has profoundly spat on them, transforming & transposing them away from what made them appealing- Laurie Strode from a straight-lanced, innocently appealing & ultimately doomed heroine who we ended up rooting for to a foul-mouthed, UN-likeable blithering mess. Sam Loomis has been remade from a truly concerned savior, determined to stop his quarry (while being believably terrified of him at the same time)from spreading death & destruction into a greedy, uncaring opportunist. And what a howler THIS Michael Myers is......! Where-as he was a terrifying, shadowy form of living darkness in total control of his actions without expression or remorse in the original, Zombie's version is laughably inept, just another thuggish brute without the cunning or resilience of a true screen villian, led only by his childhood/""inner-self"" visions/images to explain his actions (oh, so T-H-A-T's why he does & is what he is!!!!! I d-i-d-n-'t k-n-o-w THAT!). I'm not sure how much effort was made by Tyler Mane to ""get into character"" but you never really truly believe he's Michael Myers, or at least I didn't. Dick Warlock ('the Shape' in 1981's H2) was more convincing, emerging out of a dark corner with the occasional creepy head tilt while remaining stoic was all that was really needed.The way I see it, the only real excuse for these re-makes (or are they re-boots???)is a set-up for a future ""Michael vs Jason"" clash!",1,What a MESS!!!!!!,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,1905,"['Going', 'what', 'gut', 'instinct', 'was', 'telling', 'current', 'crop', 'remakes', 'keep', 'springing', 'up', 'went', 'ahead', 'got', 'copy', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', '2', 'viewing', 'equivalent', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'Brainstorm', 'XFL', 'meant', 'improve', 'traditional', 'NFL', 'Vince', 'Zombie', 'flat', 'face', 'What', 'total', 'waste', 'effort', 'Forget', 'obviously', 'lame', 'storyline', 'Zombie', 'taken', 'BEST', 'parts', 'what', 'others', 'loved', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'masterpiece', 'profoundly', 'spat', 'transforming', 'transposing', 'away', 'what', 'made', 'appealing-', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'straight-lanced', 'innocently', 'appealing', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'heroine', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'rooting', 'foul-mouthed', 'UN-likeable', 'blithering', 'mess', 'Sam', 'Loomis', 'been', 'remade', 'truly', 'concerned', 'savior', 'determined', 'stop', 'quarry', 'being', 'believably', 'terrified', 'same', 'time', 'spreading', 'death', 'destruction', 'greedy', 'uncaring', 'opportunist', 'what', 'howler', 'THIS', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Where-as', 'was', 'terrifying', 'shadowy', 'form', 'living', 'darkness', 'total', 'control', 'actions', 'expression', 'remorse', 'original', 'Zombie', 'version', 'laughably', 'inept', 'just', 'thuggish', 'brute', 'cunning', 'resilience', 'true', 'screen', 'villian', 'led', 'only', 'childhood/', 'inner-self', 'visions/images', 'explain', 'actions', 'oh', 'T-H-A-T', 'why', 'what', ""d-i-d-n-'t"", 'k-n-o-w', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'get', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'truly', 'believe', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'Dick', 'Warlock', 'Shape', '1981', 'H2', 'was', 'more', 'convincing', 'emerging', 'dark', 'corner', 'occasional', 'creepy', 'head', 'tilt', 'remaining', 'stoic', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'needed.The', 'way', 'see', 'only', 'real', 'excuse', 're-makes', 'are', 're-boots', 'set-up', 'future', 'Michael', 'vs', 'Jason', 'clash']",N/A

1291263,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B002V3HT2G,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 9]","Well, it's January again. Christmas time has come and gone, the New Year has begun, and what better way to start things off than with a deluge of horror films. At least that's what Hollywood apparently believes. Apparently the annual January to February tradition for rentals is to make available the many horror films that were released to theaters the previous September and October. The most recent horror film from last year to be released was the not-so eagerly anticipated (at least by me) Rob Zombie sequel to his ""Halloween"" remake from 2007, the aptly titled ""Halloween 2"".""Halloween 2"" finds Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor Compton) struggling to find some semblance of understanding as to why the masked monstrosity known as Michael Myers attacked her and her friends without provocation. Now, two years after that horrific night, the presumed dead Michael Myers has mysteriously returned to Haddonfield to finish what he started.While watching this horrible creation spawned from the twisted mind of former rocker turned writer/director Rob Zombie, I was reminded yet again that this new remake driven ""Halloween"" franchise is nothing at all like its predecessor. For clarification, the fact that a remake-centric series is drastically different from the original is not necessarily a bad thing. In this case though, the bad far outweighs any good that one could possibly gleam from the first two entries into the new franchise.For starters, the initial remake in 2007 was a twisted amalgamation of depravity, sadism, and gratuitous sex and gore that shared only a slight resemblance to the John Carpenter classic to which it was supposedly paying homage. Not only did it have all that working against it, but it also tried to create a sense of empathy for Michael Myers, and I for one do not want to feel sorry for or understand him. I preferred the Michael that was more mysterious and ultimately less savage than what we find in this series. So, with the initial movie, this series of ""Halloween"" films was already off to a bad start and with ""Halloween 2"" the quality appears to have suffered even more.In the sequel, everything that was sick and twisted about the first film is taken even further in this entry. The gore is even more grotesque and pervasive, the characters are even more morally bankrupt, and the unbridled savagery of Michael is taken to an all-time low for either series. Essentially, there are no redeemable aspects to find within this movie, except (and this is a stretch) it does attempt to bring a resolution to the story that was started in the previous film... oh, and the fact that the movie ends (that was my favorite part of the experience).Now, this is not to say that the original series was brilliant filmmaking or a treasure trove of movie goodness, but it never once sank to the depths of darkness and despair that has consumed this newest franchise. The aspects that made the original John Carpenter classic so intriguing were as follows: Michael was a mystery to the audience, the story constantly kept a steady pace, the characters were moderately interesting, and whenever an attack were about to occur the suspense was so palpable that it could be cut with a knife.With Rob Zombie's revisionist look at the series all the suspense has been stripped away and replaced with an in your face approach that leaves nothing to the imagination and excessive gore that rivals the ""Saw"" franchise. The plot plods along at a meandering pace for much of the time. For example, how many times must we be shown Michael just walking around? I get it, the man doesn't really drive or run anywhere he goes, he has to walk, point taken. Then, there's the odd psychological elements included in the movie that are more distracting than illuminating. The intentions of these scenes is to give us some insight into Michael's inner psyche; however, the scenes come off as being an amateurish and pathetic attempt to make the movie seem smarter than it could ever hope to be.Honestly, these film work best when less time is spent on explaining the reasoning and driving forces for these villains. If Zombie would have paid better attention, the original franchise went south when the writers started trying to explore what made Michael tick, rather than just leave his story be with what was revealed about his and Laurie's connection in the second film. This movie's running time of nearly two hours could have been trimmed down by at least 30 minutes had we removed all the unnecessary walking bits or the nonsensical, ponderous moments showcasing Michael's inner neurosis.Another oddity to me is the fact that the characters swear with almost every other word that is spoken. I know that they're supposed to be teenagers, some of which have survived some decidedly grisly events, but I think one would be hard-pressed to find any true teenager that has a vocabulary so limited that cuss words are used for the majority of their adjectives, verbs, and so on. To me, I think Rob Zombie takes the approach when making a movie that he is going to take every aspect to the extreme even if it sacrifices realism and/or becomes irritating and disrupts the flow of the movie. Either that or this is an example of just how limited his vocabulary truly is. Who knows?Now, that I feel I have sufficiently torn into the bulk of the film and its shortcomings, let's discuss the cast for a moment. Out of the entire film, the primary cast members are the only elements that can receive even a glimmer of praise.Leading the cast is Scout Taylor Compton reprising her role as Laurie Strode. Scout does a passable job of trying to keep Laurie grounded without going too overboard in the hysterics while coping with her nightmarish memories. Although, she does go a little crazy in a few scenes and out of the entire cast she is the primary culprit for using expletives incessantly. As I pointed out above, the constant battery of four letter words does begin to distract. Not to mention, take away from the proceedings, plus making Laurie seem uneducated due to such a restricted vocabulary.The supporting cast is essentially comprised of the other survivors from the previous movie. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, who was one of the best parts of the previous film, is flat-out irritating in this installment. For whatever reason Loomis is now a glory seeking media hound who is trying to find his fame by capitalizing on Michael's murderous rage. Previously, Loomis was a sympathetic character who only wanted to help Michael and then stop him in the end due to his feeling responsible for his continued existence (much the same way as Donald Pleasence's version of Loomis had done). However, in this film, there is only the slightest glimmer of that Dr. Loomis lurking within, and what has replaced him is a narcissistic man who lives solely for the limelight. Despite this change in character, Malcolm does handle this new Loomis very well and makes his purported self-importance believable in every scene.Rounding out the supporting cast is Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris as Sheriff Brackett and his daughter Annie, respectively. Neither of these two characters really got to do all that much in this film. Both were much more involved in the previous movie, but this time around were relegated to the background and only popping up to provide some arguably questionable moral support for Laurie.Lastly, Rob Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, does appear several times throughout the film, mainly during the moments spotlighting Michael's inner thoughts. Her performance was fairly one-note, nowhere nearly as emotional or intriguing as she had been in the previous film. Plus, her scenes in this movie were some of the most boring and drawn out in the entire film. Her character would have been better off left in the sole flashback sequence seen at the beginning of the movie, as this was the most engaging moment for her character.Not that this is necessary, but in summation, this movie is an absolutely dreadful piece of cinematic garbage that should have remained in the recesses of Rob Zombie's twisted imagination. Containing only scant moments of interest yet filled to the brim with unreasonable amounts of gore, violence, and language. ""Halloween 2"" is by far one of the worst films ever created for any genre, and that's saying a lot.""Halloween 2"" is available in rated R and unrated editions; both contain pervasive violence,

The script sounds like it was written by a middle schooler (honestly, who uses THAT many F bombs in regular conversation?). And the violence, while somewhat expected, went WAY over the top as far as simply telling the story. On the plus side, whoever did the makeup effects for this movie has one heck of a demo reel to show off now.I'll agree that casting Maclolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis was a good move...it would have been even better if they had made him even remotely likable. Same goes for virtually any of the characters in H2.Oh, memo to those who griped about Michael grunting....he grunted in Carpenter's original as well...just check out the scene where he strangles Lynda, or when he's breaking into the closet, or choking Laurie.And of course they had to go the whole ""oh-my-God-she's-his-SISTER!"" route, which was stupid in the first HALLOWEEN 2 and is even more so this time around. John Carpenter came up with the idea in 1981 and even he admits it was a dumb one. Michael Myers is far more terrifying as simply the ""boogeyman"".....anybody could be his victim, nobody is safe. With this lame subplot, as long as you aren't related to him or between him and a relative, you're safe!

1291268,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,B002V3HT2G,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[3, 4]","I will start this review off by saying that I am one of the few horror fans out there that prefer Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". I know, it's blasphemy and I will go down in horror hell for saying such a thing. But I personally love the back story that Zombie gave Michael and feel as though everything about the film (from the acting to the directing to use of music) was just about perfect. Everything about the film really worked for me and it was with appreciation that I approached the sequel. Going in, I had heard nothing but TERRIBLE things. I mean downright AWFUL comments. ""One of the worst horror sequels ever made"" and ""Rob Zombie will burn in hell for what he has done to this series"" were some of the nicer comments. So is ""Halloween II"" really as awful as horror fans have made it out to be?In a short flashback, Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) visits her son, a young Michael Myers (Chase Wright Vanek), at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Deborah gives Michael a white horse statuette as a gift. Michael says that the horse reminds him of a dream he had of Deborah's ghost, all dressed in white and leading a horse down the sanitarium halls toward Michael, telling him she was going to bring him home. Moving ahead fifteen years, after having shot an adult Michael (Tyler Mane), Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is found wandering around in a state of shock and covered in blood by Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif). Brackett takes Laurie to the emergency room. Meanwhile, the paramedics pick up the Sheriff's daughter Annie (Danielle Harris) and Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), who are still alive after having been attacked by Michael, and take them to the hospital. Presumed dead, Michael's lifeless body is loaded into a separate ambulance. When the driver has a traffic accident Michael awakens and escapes the ambulance, walking toward a vision of Deborah dressed in white and leading a white horse.Michael appears at the hospital, and begins murdering everyone he comes across on his way to Laurie. Trapped in a security outpost at the gate, Laurie watches as Michael tears through the walls with an axe, but just as he tries to kill her, Laurie wakes up from the dream. It is actually one year later and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael's body has been missing since last Halloween--still presumed dead--and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy, Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Meanwhile, Michael has been having visions of Deborah's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home; so he sets off for Haddonfield.I know that most horror fans seem to despise this movie but I find it to be a beautiful shot, misunderstood gem of a horror film. I admire Zombie for not doing a straight up remake of the original sequel and I like how you actually are able to see the emotional grief that the first travesty has caused its characters. We are able to see Laurie and Annie as real, flesh and blood characters that are each trying to deal with this travesty the only way that they know how. It's not a perfect film (the horse imagery is out of place to say the least) but it is an ambitious film and that's more than you can say about most horror movies today.",5,Evil Comes Home,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,3437,"['will', 'start', 'review', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'one', 'few', 'horror', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'prefer', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'know', 'blasphemy', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'horror', 'hell', 'saying', 'thing', 'personally', 'love', 'back', 'story', 'Zombie', 'gave', 'Michael', 'feel', 'everything', 'film', 'acting', 'directing', 'use', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'Everything', 'film', 'really', 'worked', 'was', 'appreciation', 'approached', 'sequel', 'Going', 'had', 'heard', 'nothing', 'TERRIBLE', 'things', 'mean', 'downright', 'AWFUL', 'comments', 'One', 'worst', 'horror', 'sequels', 'ever', 'made', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'will', 'burn', 'hell', 'what', 'done', 'series', 'were', 'nicer', 'comments', 'So', 'Halloween', 'II', 'really', 'as', 'awful', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'short', 'flashback', 'Deborah', 'Myers', 'Sheri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'son', 'young', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Chase', 'Wright', 'Vanek', 'Smith', 'Grove', 'Sanitarium', 'Deborah', 'Michael', 'white', 'horse', 'statuette', 'gift', 'Michael', 'horse', 'dream', 'had', 'Deborah', 'ghost', 'dressed', 'white', 'leading', 'horse', 'down', 'sanitarium', 'Michael', 'telling', 'was', 'going', 'bring', 'home', 'Moving', 'ahead', 'fifteen', 'years', 'having', 'adult', 'Michael', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'found', 'wandering', 'around', 'state', 'shock', 'covered', 'blood', 'Sheriff', 'Brackett', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Brackett', 'Laurie', 'emergency', 'room', 'Meanwhile', 'paramedics', 'pick', 'up', 'Sheriff', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Michael', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'having', 'been', 'attacked', 'Michael', 'take', 'hospital', 'Presumed', 'dead', 'Michael', 'lifeless', 'body', 'loaded', 'separate', 'ambulance', 'When', 'driver', 'traffic', 'accident', 'Michael', 'ambulance', 'walking', 'vision', 'Deborah', 'dressed', 'white', 'leading', 'white', 'horse.Michael', 'hospital', 'murdering', 'everyone', 'way', 'Laurie', 'Trapped', 'security', 'outpost', 'gate', 'Laurie', 'Michael', 'walls', 'axe', 'just', 'kill', 'Laurie', 'up', 'dream', 'actually', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'Laurie', 'now', 'living', 'Bracketts', 'Michael', 'body', 'been', 'missing', 'last', 'Halloween', 'still', 'presumed', 'dead', 'Laurie', 'been', 'having', 'recurring', 'nightmares', 'event', 'Laurie', 'deals', 'trauma', 'therapy', 'Loomis', 'chosen', 'turn', 'event', 'opportunity', 'write', 'book', 'Meanwhile', 'Michael', 'been', 'having', 'visions', 'Deborah', 'ghost', 'younger', 'version', 'who', 'Halloween', 'approaching', 'time', 'bring', 'Laurie', 'home', 'off', 'Haddonfield.I', 'know', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'seem', 'despise', 'movie', 'find', 'be', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'misunderstood', 'gem', 'horror', 'film', 'admire', 'Zombie', 'not', 'doing', 'straight', 'up', 'remake', 'original', 'sequel', 'like', 'how', 'actually', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'emotional', 'grief', 'first', 'travesty', 'caused', 'characters', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'Laurie', 'Annie', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'deal', 'travesty', 'only', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'horse', 'imagery', 'place', 'say', 'least', 'ambitious', 'film', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'today']",N/A

1291272,A3TDW3TDZKUVJ,B002V3HT2G,Leah-S,"[1, 1]","*WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers*If I'm being completely honest, I was very surprised when it was announced that there would be a sequel to Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"". From what I read at the time, Rob Zombie wanted to make ""Halloween 2"" entirely his own & not go based off of John Carpenter's ""Halloween 2"" & from what I saw in the film, he accomplished that.The Movie: I'd written a review for Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" & said it was dark, gory & there was profanity, much like his other movies, but his version of ""Halloween 2"" is 10x worse than his reimagining of ""Halloween"". This takes place immediately after Laurie Strode ""kills"" her brother, Michael Myers, we see her in the hospital suffering from pretty substantial injuries & she goes into surgery. Nothing is left to the imagination, we're shown broken bones, open wounds, blood, stitches & it's all graphically shown. Skip ahead a couple of years & Laurie is a completely different person, she's depressed, has tattoos, has dreadlocked hair, she's very much a changed person from when we first met her in ""Halloween"". However, who wouldn't change drastically if they found out their brother was a serial killer who killed your entire family? Another character who has changed is Danielle Harris' character, Annie, she's become a positive, vegan, recluse, which is again the polar opposite of her character in the 2007 version. I personally wasn't a fan of Laurie's new friends in this movie, unfortunately, like in the 2007 version, I found them to be rather irritating when they hung out together, but hey, that's just my opinion. The ending was a disappointment to me, the final scene with Anthony Perkins in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" only it wasn't unique & haunting.The BluRay: It works very well, no issues with the disc. I believe there are some pretty good special features with this, I haven't watched the movie in a couple of years, but if I remember correctly a fan of the film would enjoy the included features.Overall: I don't want to sound like I absolutely hate this film, because I don't hate it, it's OK, it's just not as good as other horror movies out there.

Not a big problem but kind of pushes a bit off the path Michael has traveled in the last 30 years...wow...30 years. Congratulations Mr.Carpenter.The gore, and kill scenes throughout the movie were pretty good, possibly better than the first but the storyline just wasnt there.

I can honestly say that now Rob Zombie's Halloween films are among my top favorite films of all time. He has done an incredible job of taking the character Michael Myers and making him ""human"". Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the original but now there is a complete story to the mayhem inside Michael's mind. The story is believable and realistic. I don't want to give anything away but I will say this is NOT a remake of Halloween Two. Unlike the first Zombie film which did somewhat follow along the original (except for the addition of a few murders and the institution scenes) this film is entirely different. I will say that the opening few minutes of the film recreate the hospital massacre (with even more brutality) but the rest of the film then jumps ahead to two years later. I won't say anything more than that. What you can expect is to be genuinely terrified.Forget what you know about the old films. This is a more brutal Michael and yet at the same time, you almost feel a little sorry for him because he is so mentally disturbed. I also wasn't thrilled with the casting of Laurie in the first Zombie movie, but I have to say she really shined as an actress in this one and I now appreciate her more.

Suitable for selected audiences.Just finished re-screening the first part of Halloween II while eating dinner and giving some Bitburger ale a proper seeing-to.  This was followed by a shot of Johnnie Walker Black Label.The way I see it, Halloween and Halloween II are ritual drama.  The plot is obscure, verging on the incoherent.  Michael Meyers' mother, after her suicide, has apparently crossed over to the dark side and is now exhorting Michael to bring Boo home - i.e. stab the living crud out of her.  This, seemingly is Michael's mission.  Michael lives off the land, walking cross-lots a la Shawcross.  However, in the process of finding Boo - Laurie Strode, who has now refreshingly turned into a foul-mouthed, death-rocking nightmare on wheels, Michael must also put down many worthless hillbillies.  This indiscriminate killing does not seem related to his vision quest to stab Boo to death, and so contributes to the dream-like incoherence of the plot.  I mean it's hardly like Michael is harvesting these souls to populate the same ""heaven"" to which he is recruiting Boo.  One gets the impression that these souls are undesirable.  And yet slay them Michael must and slay them Michael does, for reasons known only to himself.Also, as the story progresses, Young Michael appears alongside the adult Michael, leading the earnest viewer to drunkenly conclude that the adult Michael is a kind of Golem, created by his now-evil mother, to roam the earth and cull garbalogical humans while on his solemn quest to slay Boo down.Meanwhile, Loomis has himself turned into a nightmare on wheels.  His eventual slaying by Michael seems to confer more dignity than he merits.  This adds to the basic sense of incoherence and dream logic, elements that seem intrinsic to ritual drama.  In ritual drama, the audience knows what must happen.  People must run screaming with their faces carved up and purple blood bubbling from their mouths while their eyes work apoplectically.  The audience knows the necessary plot so well that what does happen is soothingly immaterial.  Due to this strict determinism, the movie goes through its evolutions with the tranquility of things already happened.  In such a ritual drama, only the incoherence of the plot lends the sense of possibility and space.  Thus, in a Noh drama, the Samurai who slays the evil witch who flys about by whirling her long neck, he is lent charisma and dignity by the fact that his actions are at a basic level incomprehensible.  The basic message being a metaphysical observation: if the world did not contain something irrational, it could not be.",5,"If You Wanna Ride, Don't Ride the White Horse",1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,2703,"['Warning', 'following', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'and/or', 'reference', 'hardcore', 'boozing', 'Suitable', 'selected', 'audiences.Just', 'finished', 're-screening', 'first', 'part', 'Halloween', 'II', 'eating', 'dinner', 'giving', 'Bitburger', 'ale', 'proper', 'seeing-to', 'was', 'followed', 'shot', 'Johnnie', 'Walker', 'Black', 'Label.The', 'way', 'see', 'Halloween', 'Halloween', 'II', 'are', 'ritual', 'drama', 'plot', 'obscure', 'verging', 'incoherent', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'mother', 'suicide', 'apparently', 'crossed', 'dark', 'side', 'now', 'exhorting', 'Michael', 'bring', 'Boo', 'home', 'i.e', 'stab', 'living', 'seemingly', 'Michael', 'mission', 'Michael', 'land', 'walking', 'cross-lots', 'la', 'Shawcross', 'However', 'process', 'finding', 'Boo', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'who', 'now', 'refreshingly', 'turned', 'foul-mouthed', 'death-rocking', 'nightmare', 'wheels', 'Michael', 'must', 'also', 'put', 'down', 'many', 'worthless', 'hillbillies', 'indiscriminate', 'killing', 'not', 'seem', 'related', 'vision', 'quest', 'stab', 'Boo', 'death', 'so', 'contributes', 'dream-like', 'incoherence', 'plot', 'mean', 'hardly', 'like', 'Michael', 'harvesting', 'souls', 'populate', 'same', 'heaven', 'recruiting', 'Boo', 'One', 'impression', 'souls', 'are', 'undesirable', 'yet', 'slay', 'Michael', 'must', 'slay', 'Michael', 'reasons', 'known', 'only', 'himself.Also', 'story', 'Young', 'Michael', 'adult', 'Michael', 'leading', 'earnest', 'viewer', 'drunkenly', 'conclude', 'adult', 'Michael', 'kind', 'Golem', 'created', 'now-evil', 'mother', 'roam', 'earth', 'cull', 'garbalogical', 'humans', 'solemn', 'quest', 'slay', 'Boo', 'down.Meanwhile', 'Loomis', 'turned', 'nightmare', 'wheels', 'eventual', 'slaying', 'Michael', 'confer', 'more', 'dignity', 'basic', 'sense', 'incoherence', 'dream', 'logic', 'elements', 'seem', 'intrinsic', 'ritual', 'drama', 'ritual', 'drama', 'audience', 'what', 'must', 'happen', 'People', 'must', 'run', 'screaming', 'carved', 'up', 'purple', 'blood', 'bubbling', 'mouths', 'eyes', 'work', 'apoplectically', 'audience', 'necessary', 'plot', 'so', 'well', 'what', 'happen', 'soothingly', 'immaterial', 'Due', 'strict', 'determinism', 'movie', 'evolutions', 'tranquility', 'things', 'already', 'happened', 'such', 'ritual', 'drama', 'only', 'incoherence', 'plot', 'sense', 'possibility', 'space', 'Thus', 'Noh', 'drama', 'Samurai', 'who', 'evil', 'witch', 'who', 'flys', 'whirling', 'long', 'neck', 'lent', 'charisma', 'dignity', 'fact', 'actions', 'are', 'basic', 'level', 'incomprehensible', 'basic', 'message', 'being', 'metaphysical', 'observation', 'world', 'did', 'not', 'contain', 'something', 'irrational', 'could', 'not', 'be']",N/A

Don't ruin a classic beloved horror series, to make yourself feel all accomplished creatively!!! I was really let down by this. I'd even rather watch the one with Tyra Banks in it, than this mess! If the studios decide to go forward with new entries (wich I hope they do, because Zombie should NOT have the last word on this franchise!!!) I would hope they would push forward with a fresh new direction ignoring Rob Zombie's lack of caring. He really did not know his audience on this one, and I'm pretty sure he does not care.

1291281,A32AJA0B59J0OM,B002V3HT2G,Matt,"[3, 4]","Every writer injects a little bit of his or her own personality into their work.  It's a very basic fact of the craft.  Characters may be from their own hometown or loosely based on themselves. Stephen King was in a horrible car accident, and guess what, so was the main character in ""Duma Key.""  But what sets good writers apart from bad ones is how well they can wrap those autobiographical elements in characters and places that AREN'T based on themselves.  You have to be able to craft a place that's real, believable, and populated with characters who feel both authentic and different from each other.  And that's where Rob Zombie is a complete failure.  He claims that Halloween II is entirely his vision, and that is the truest thing that's ever been said of this movie.  Sadly, though, Rob Zombie is a man possessed of a great deal of tunnelvision.  He likes gore, f-words, heavy metal music, and strippers.  So every element of this film reeks of those things.  There are topless dancers where topless dancers don't make sense.  Every line of dialogue sounds like Zombie himself could have uttered it.  You could really mix and match a great majority of the characters and the dialogue wouldn't be affected by this at all because they all sound like each other.  They all sound like Rob Zombie.Of course, Rob wanted this movie to be different than its predecessor.  So he decided to make Michael Myers a real person.  To believe this premise, you have to believe that Myers can survive a great deal more punishment than any human being is capable of.  You have to believe that being locked in a psych ward for most of his life somehow resulted in a human Myers growing into a musclebound behemoth. You have to believe that a man who has been institutionalized all his life and has the education of a 12 year old can somehow be resourceful enough to survive living in the wilderness for 2 years.  You have to believe also that a deranged, psychopatic killer who ISN'T motivated by supernatural forces but rather by an instinctive desire to murder can somehow lay low for 2 years and then suddenly decide to start killing again.Zombie wants you to believe this is a deeper, more psychological exploration of Michael Myers the character.  But do we really see anything in the film that goes deeper than Myers having mommy issues?  No. It's a shallow and contrived plot convention that has been used lots of times before. Norman Bates, anyone?  Then you have Zombie throwing all of that out the window by introducing a psychic link between Myers and Laurie, which undercuts his desire to leave the supernatural out of it. Laurie is no deep character either.  She's upset because, like, her parents are dead.  Didn't you hear her?  Her parents...are...dead. And she's really upset.  So of course she needs to go to a party.

Well i'm sorry to say but this movie is not much of an improvement. the story continues right where it left off in the first. This movie is just as violent and sadistic as the previous if not more so. However that does not mean it is better in any way. We all know that in the last 5-7 years remakes of Classic horror movies have been a dime-a-dozen. Now in my personal opinion the majority of them have been pretty lame. this movie does seem to carry some weight in the aspect that it is a new look on the series while still keeping some original details. If you have watched the original movies which were born from John Carpenters Halloween then you may not care for this movie. However teens who have not experienced the original movies will probably enjoy this ""new"" look on Halloween. Overall i picked this up to add to my collection because it is not entirely horrible. If you can find this film at a good price $6-8 it is worth adding to your movie collection. Heck it is even worth watching with your friends on Halloween Night.

This is ROB'S take on the series, a series that became a real joke after so many horrible sequels. So yeah it needed a HUGE reboot.  Horror has changed throughout the years, and what rob made was his version on current horror. I for one loved the brutality, intensity, and all out craziness and sadness that came with the film. Even Danielle Harris who plays annie loved it and was shocked by the hardcore direction he took.  People complained about the grunting, what do you think a guy with a knife does? yeah he's angry,just got shot in the face by his sister, and he's crazy, and when he attacks you, he's gonna make noise. duh.  He's expressing all that rage. This film had some amazing cinematography, a great score, intense scenes, and was a real horror film that stuck with me and my friends for days. I highly recommend you see it soon, the directors cut is coming with tons more footage with annie and lori along with many other scenes that rob had to cut due to time.  the gore wasnt trimmed, but theres plenty more scenes like the fight with annie n lori that will make the film make more sense.  If your into raw, gritty, non commercial horror, then you will love this shocking film. but like so many hollywood myers fanboys, they simply cannot handle the indie influence zombie brings.  The only bad parts were sherri moon, who i love, but did not fit in this film and the new younger myers, man he was bad. Other than that, brilliant work. A real balls out horror film. Not for the candy coated myers fans. Come on guys, watch some french horror films or something.

1291289,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B002V3HT2G,Mike S.,"[1, 2]","Rob Zombie's first installment of Halloween can ostensibly be called a remake.  Although it did depart a lot from the original film it did essentially tell the same story.  Just with twists.  This one is just a direct sequel to that film, and while it does pay homage to the original version of Halloween II for the first 15 to 20 mins, after that it is its own movie and story.  It has much more of the strangeness and over the top gore that Rob Zombie's other horror movies have.  Loomis is turned into a raging prick who is just out to make a buck, and Laurie is definitely screwed up from her experiences.That part of the story I did find interesting.  It is the part of the original Laurie Strode story line we did not see.  How did she cope as a teenager after the events of that night.  If it were just her messed up life and Michael coming back I think the film would have been better.  But the whole channeling the dead mother angle and Laurie can sometimes feel Michael (like when he is eating the dog) was just stupid.  Also having Michael yell die when killing Loomis should not have happened.It is definitely a dark and twisted sequel.  Many devoted fans of the original two movies will probably hate this one.  Also people who would otherwise give it a chance if it were a remake of the second film will not like it either.  For everyone else there will probably still be a lot of disagreement.  Some will love it, others will hate it.  I am pretty lukewarm to it.  For what it is, if you can divest it from following the Halloween story verbatim, it is not horrible.  It is certainly better than Halloween 6 and Halloween Resurrection, but it is nowhere near as good as the original two films or even as good as Zombie's remake of the first movie.",3,Not a remake of Halloween II,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,1762,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 'first', 'installment', 'Halloween', 'can', 'ostensibly', 'be', 'called', 'remake', 'did', 'depart', 'lot', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'essentially', 'tell', 'same', 'story', 'Just', 'twists', 'one', 'just', 'direct', 'sequel', 'film', 'pay', 'homage', 'original', 'version', 'Halloween', 'II', 'first', '15', '20', 'mins', 'own', 'movie', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'strangeness', 'top', 'gore', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'Loomis', 'turned', 'raging', 'prick', 'who', 'just', 'out', 'make', 'buck', 'Laurie', 'definitely', 'screwed', 'up', 'experiences.That', 'part', 'story', 'did', 'find', 'interesting', 'part', 'original', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'story', 'line', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'How', 'did', 'cope', 'teenager', 'events', 'night', 'were', 'just', 'messed', 'up', 'life', 'Michael', 'coming', 'back', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'whole', 'channeling', 'dead', 'mother', 'angle', 'Laurie', 'can', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'Michael', 'when', 'eating', 'dog', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'Also', 'having', 'Michael', 'yell', 'die', 'when', 'killing', 'Loomis', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'happened.It', 'definitely', 'dark', 'twisted', 'sequel', 'Many', 'devoted', 'fans', 'original', 'two', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'one', 'Also', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'otherwise', 'give', 'chance', 'were', 'remake', 'second', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'probably', 'still', 'be', 'lot', 'disagreement', 'will', 'love', 'others', 'will', 'hate', 'am', 'pretty', 'lukewarm', 'what', 'can', 'divest', 'following', 'Halloween', 'story', 'verbatim', 'not', 'horrible', 'certainly', 'better', '6', 'Halloween', 'Resurrection', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'two', 'films', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'Zombie', 'remake', 'first', 'movie']",N/A

I liked his ""Halloween"" but wasn't thrilled by it. I have issues with him changing the idea of Michael Myers of being a mystery and that he is the ""Boogie man"" to an over long epic of his childhood which was all Zombie to then a full fledge remake.Now here comes ""Halloween 2"" a complete mess that makes the original sequel from 1980 look like a masterpiece in horror.

This movie is just a mess of unoriginal bits and pieces of other ideas.

Michael wanders around in a field in a hood and a beard., while his mother the ghost trails behind with a white horse (should have been a unicorn, imo). Dreams...

A lot of the common staples of Michael Myers are removed. He talks (once), and we do get to see inside his psyche and see first hand what makes him tick. The look of Myers is great,coming across more like some twisted vision of a pagan frankenstein rather than a mysterious phantom. It seems as if the biggest problem with Halloween enthusiast when confronted with Zombie's re-imagining is that it indeed is a re-imagining and not a frame by frame remake of the original,when in fact dubiously copying the film (much like they did with the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street) does more to insult and discredit the work put forth by the original cast and crew.

1291295,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B002V3HT2G,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[10, 14]","I have to give Rob Zombie credit, for when he makes a sequel he doesn't just make the same film over again. Zombie obviously loves the old horror film and it shows in every horror film he has made. I watched both the unrated and theatrical versions of the film and I think the theatrical moves along more smoothly and has a better ending. The gore is trimmed down slightly, but doesn't take away from this brutal film in any way.Zombie gives this film a very cool look and does create some eerie atmosphere, but I did find some elements confusing at times and that does take away from the overall experience. I wish they could have had the original actor who played young Michael in the first film as this actor just doesn't seem to be playing the same character. While the original was very withdrawn, the one in this film just seems like a regular kid. This could be due to the fact that he is only in the film as a figment of adult Michael and Angels imagination.The kill scenes are brutal and not just because of the excessive gore, but because the set ups are genuine and that makes from some gut wrenching murders. Zombie also has a knack for placing actors that we have seen over the years in these scenes, so we feel an little more sorry for them.The unrated version is longer and pulls us out of the action more times than needed, but it is certainly worth seeing for fans...I just preferred the theatrical. I do have one big gripe, why do they need to release the two versions separately?....I know the answer (GREED!), but it's shameful to charge fans twice for a film that isn't all that much different. I know I'm not alone when I say I want both versions, but I don't think it's worth paying the price! Both releases have a bunch of extras that are the same including outtakes, gag reel, music videos by the kooky horror band in the film and commentary.Overall if you like Zombie or newer horror films, you will probably like this film. I happen to love old horror film,but there are some good horror films out there today and this film will stay with you like all of Zombies Horror outings.....and isn't that what good horror films should do?",3,MICHAEL'S BACK AND HE'S MEANER THAN EVER!

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 8]","Contrary to many die hard fans of John Carpenter's original classic, I enjoyed Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween for what it was.  Being a huge success, a sequel is naturally the next stage of the game, and here we are with Halloween II, which finds Zombie destroying any and all good will that he probably ever had.  Beginning right after the last film, with Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) still in shock from her ordeal with Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) in a segment that sort of finds Zombie paying homage to Rick Rosenthal's original Halloween 2, which shockingly enough winds up being a better sequel than this one.  From that point forward, we see Laurie pick up the pieces of her life with fellow survivor Annie (Danielle Harris) and her father the Sheriff (the great Brad Dourif), while Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) profits off of Michael's rampage and familial link with Laurie with a best-selling tell-all book.  And oh yeah, Michael is still alive (and looking like a homeless Alan Moore) and wreaking all sorts of bloody havoc.  The biggest question that appears to the viewer during watching Halloween II is just what isn't groan worthy?  Is it the dream sequences that feature the dead mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) and young Michael (Chase Vanek) with a white horse in tow?  Is it the pointless, senseless brutality that by this point just seems more boring than anything else?  Or is it Zombie's surprisingly hackneyed script, direction, and shifted characterizations (the take on Dr. Loomis here is lightyears in contrast to the one we saw the last time around, or seen at all for that matter) that ultimately kill Halloween II?  All that and the ultra predictable ending, which we've seen a version of before, all help ruin something that could have been interesting at the least.

A lot of people have a problem with Rob Zombie drastically changing the core story, and the characters personalities. Actually, I can live with that. A remake, in essence, should be a re-telling, with personal touches by the writer/director. After all, a shot for shot remake doesn't work, remember the god-awful Gus VanSant remake of Psycho??? Having said that, however, this movie just does not work. The Laurie Strode character is so annoying, you will pray for her death. I know I did. The Loomis character is now a media and money hungry parasite, who profits from the tragedy of the first movie. While detestable, this is at least a somewhat realistic possibility.

I have no idea which is which, and what Zombie was trying to do. This is one big muddles mess of a movie. The biggest flaw, and I mean major flaw, is there is NOT ONE character who is sympathetic. You will not care one iota about any of these people. I rooted all the way for Michael Myers. I wanted him to kill every whining, obnnoxious, human being in this film. He almost did.

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[31, 37]","The Amazonites have spoken and this movie got killed, lambasted by some as 'the worst Halloween movie', though there's no way it can approach the horror of the botched Curse or the Busta-Rhymes-was-the-best-part Resurrection.I'm still not sure why this was given an August '09 release rather than...October/Halloween.  Presumably, they didn't want to run up against the latest Saw offering, and perhaps they sensed the buzz of Paranormal Activity.  Instead, they ran it against The Final Destination 3D, which still fared better.Folks seem to love or hate the Rob Zombie Halloween excursions.  Say this about Zombie...he is a horror movie fan and he tries something more personal this time around.  Yes, we all know and (presumably) love the original Halloween II, where Michael Myers stalks Laurie in the eerily empty corridors of Haddonfield Memorial Hospital.  And yes, we all know that it was revealed that Laurie was, in fact, Michael's sister, a plot twist conceived by John Carpenter when he ran out of ideas.  So what should we expect when someone remakes 're-boots' or jump-starts a series and then remakes the sequel, too?Yes, there are similar elements and plot points from earlier Halloween films, including the original Part II (the hospital, the sister angle, which we knew from the first Zombie installment, etc).  But this is not a remake of the original Part II.  Rob Zombie is going his own way with the blessing of the Akkad clan, and I think he does some interesting things story and plot-wise.  There are clearly some expressionistic nods to Italian horror directors (Bava, Argento), and there's a strong nod to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and general insanity after you've been chased by a knife-wielding lunatic.  The early scenes---again, picking up right after the events of the original---are well done, if unsettling.  There's the frenetic activity of the paramedics and authorities, the hospital atmosphere, the loving close-ups of emergency surgery and various injuries, and the spooky recurrence of The Moody Blues on TV.  There's a very nightmarish feel to everything and the looks and sounds are appropriately unsettling.  There's a focus on the trauma---the screaming! the terror!  The film is much more concerned with the idea that this Laurie Strode is losing her marbles, and is hardly the wholesome and pure Laurie of the previous series.  Zombie prefers some of the more disturbing elements of the material over the 'scary ones'...which in his world are nearly one and the same.  There is always the risk of wallowing in the downbeat versus showing that the filmmakers actually had any fun making this.  I think they did, but Halloween II definitely toes the line.Like most horror flicks, this is not the sum of its parts, but I always give points for atmosphere and demented touches.  Actually, the weakest part of the film is the stalking and slasher action itself.  It is predictable, methodical, absolutely brutal, and dare I say...sometimes boring.  Michael stabs...and stabs...and stabs...and then stabs again...and again...and again.  We get it.  Am curious what they cut, because it's a hard R rating here.  No, Mr. Zombie does not ease up on the slasher gore, and we get at least one close-up of a knife in the head.The better elements are the psychological angles (exploring...well, insanity), and the Loomis plotline.  This is not the same Loomis, tireless in his effort to stop evil on two feet, but rather a burnt out, cynical, media-obsessed sellout who may or may not have an ounce of altruism left in his shell.  Again, Malcolm MacDowell is excellent if underused this time.  There's also a bit of plot-timeline fudging toward the end during the 'final showdown'.The movie is demented, and extremely violent and brutal...perhaps too much in that it distracts from the fresh or different elements that Zombie tries to infuse.  I still liked this better than most of the rent-a-hack horror output that comes along.  Give credit to a horror fan making horror films and trying something else.  Of course, you can't win in this genre.  You will be condemned if you make the same old movie (which people want to see) or you'll be condemned if you try something out of left field (because people want something fresh).  If you want the old Part II, go watch it, it's a different film.  But lordy, this is a heck of a lot better than the latter stages of the original Halloween series.The DVD looks and sounds great.  I believe Zombie shot this on 16mm and converted it, so the images look grainier and darker...it's a very stark and appropriate look for this film.  The extras include a plethora of deleted scenes, most not essential but some interesting bits, plus the inevitable alternate ending.  Note that the ending here differs slightly from from what you saw in the theater (if you were such a fanatic), since this is the 'director's cut'.",3,Laurie's crazy and someone even hits a

It missing on the lighter notes like the couple in the hospital hot tub that brought some humor to the original Halloween 2.  I never like the idea of knowing the face behind Micheal's mask.  Just as his first Halloween movie felt like a combo of one and 2 the Halloween raves in this movie has a Curse of Micheal Myers feel to it as well as other elements of the film remind one of Return of Micheal Myers and Revenge of Micheal Myers. Also part of what made Myers character so great in original films is not knowing the man behind the mask never even seeing the pupils in the mask eye sockets.

1291309,A1Z1DZ1EEM9N9R,B002V3HT2G,pennyproductions,"[1, 3]","I am not a Rob Zombie fanboy.  I say this because I see a lot of reviews dismissed by fans of the original.  I get where all the hate comes from.  Rob's vision of Michael Myers is drastically different than Mr. carpenters and is inferior.  Then again, of all the rip offs that have come since the original, none have surpassed it.  What this film and the original remake try to do is deconstruct the original films.  They start from the sibling angle that Carpenter hated from the original Halloween II, and has crafted the idea of the deplorable American family that deals with its problems through repressed sexual angst and violence.  I was iffy on the first film, though I did like many of the scenes from it, but absolutely hated this version when I saw it in theaters.  It was the worst movie I had ever seen in theaters and I nearly walked out.  It was incoherent and silly.  The point is that these films are not trying to be the original.  That film already exists.  There is no way to improve upon it, so he is doing something unique and different.  No matter what you think about these films, you have to give him credit that there is something very unique to what he is doing and saying on film.I still maintain that stance towards the theatrical version.  I bought the director's cut because I am a completionist that loves Halloween and owns ever version of every film in the series.  After watching it and loving it, I bought the theatrical version to see if I was just out of it in the theater that night, and it really is a night and day difference.  Unlike the first remake, where the director commentary is identical between the theatrical and director's cut, except for additional commentary on the additional or changed scenes in the director's cut, there is a whole new explanation and thought that goes into this director's cut.  Maybe Mr. Zombie was expecting a Halloween release and was forced to finish the film early, because he says that he really was struggling to get something coherent out.  He failed, but when given the time to go in and fix the film, his vision really does stand out.Even with a complete vision, it is still very decisive amongst fans.  Where the first film was very much so this frantic mess of cutting and movement that seemed to focus on people that are suffering, this film is much slower and really focusing on the wounds.  I know that doesn't sound like a very big jump in concept, but it really is. The frantic pace is slowed down to show the damage that is being caused by the killer both literally and psychologically.  When we are hurt by the unimaginable, that thing almost always wins because even if we survive, we still kind of are left in the wake of that tragedy.Another interesting dynamic that plays in the film is that it was shot in rural Georgia.  There is a drastic change of pace and mood compared to the first film, despite supposedly happening in the same imaginary town.  You really can get a sense of city vs. country and how we view violence and how we take it.  In the first film, the violence is cut away from most of the time, almost like a squeamish city slicker, where here we see some of the hardest to take prosthetics I have ever seen in film.I know a lot of people don't get the white horse, and maybe it really is just a throw away, but I think it speaks to the idea that we are all trying to get back to this pure place in our minds that really is our childhood.  While the Carpenter film was trying to make us afraid of the unknown, Zombie wants us to face what we can understand and wants us to look hard at ourselves.  I think of all the nostalgia for a time gone by after 9/11.  We become cynical and impulsive and we break down.",4,The best Halloween sequel,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,3723,"['am', 'not', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'fanboy', 'say', 'see', 'lot', 'reviews', 'dismissed', 'fans', 'original', 'get', 'where', 'hate', 'Rob', 'vision', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'drastically', 'different', 'Mr.', 'carpenters', 'inferior', 'Then', 'again', 'rip', 'offs', 'have', 'come', 'original', 'none', 'have', 'surpassed', 'What', 'film', 'original', 'remake', 'try', 'do', 'deconstruct', 'original', 'films', 'start', 'sibling', 'angle', 'Carpenter', 'hated', 'original', 'Halloween', 'II', 'crafted', 'idea', 'deplorable', 'American', 'family', 'problems', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'angst', 'violence', 'was', 'iffy', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'many', 'scenes', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'version', 'when', 'saw', 'theaters', 'was', 'worst', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'theaters', 'nearly', 'walked', 'out', 'was', 'incoherent', 'silly', 'point', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'original', 'film', 'already', 'way', 'improve', 'doing', 'something', 'unique', 'different', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'films', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'something', 'very', 'unique', 'what', 'doing', 'saying', 'film.I', 'still', 'maintain', 'stance', 'theatrical', 'version', 'bought', 'director', 'cut', 'am', 'completionist', 'Halloween', 'ever', 'version', 'film', 'series', 'watching', 'loving', 'bought', 'theatrical', 'version', 'see', 'was', 'just', 'theater', 'night', 'really', 'night', 'day', 'difference', 'first', 'remake', 'where', 'director', 'commentary', 'identical', 'theatrical', 'director', 'cut', 'additional', 'commentary', 'additional', 'changed', 'scenes', 'director', 'cut', 'whole', 'new', 'explanation', 'thought', 'director', 'cut', 'Maybe', 'Mr.', 'Zombie', 'was', 'expecting', 'Halloween', 'release', 'was', 'forced', 'finish', 'film', 'early', 'really', 'was', 'struggling', 'get', 'something', 'coherent', 'out', 'failed', 'when', 'given', 'time', 'go', 'fix', 'film', 'vision', 'really', 'stand', 'out.Even', 'complete', 'vision', 'still', 'very', 'decisive', 'amongst', 'fans', 'Where', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'frantic', 'mess', 'cutting', 'movement', 'seemed', 'focus', 'people', 'are', 'suffering', 'film', 'much', 'slower', 'really', 'focusing', 'wounds', 'know', ""n't"", 'sound', 'very', 'big', 'jump', 'concept', 'really', 'frantic', 'pace', 'slowed', 'show', 'damage', 'being', 'caused', 'killer', 'literally', 'psychologically', 'When', 'are', 'hurt', 'unimaginable', 'thing', 'almost', 'always', 'even', 'survive', 'still', 'kind', 'are', 'left', 'wake', 'tragedy.Another', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'drastic', 'change', 'pace', 'mood', 'compared', 'first', 'film', 'supposedly', 'happening', 'same', 'imaginary', 'town', 'really', 'can', 'get', 'sense', 'city', 'vs.', 'country', 'how', 'view', 'violence', 'how', 'take', 'first', 'film', 'violence', 'cut', 'away', 'most', 'time', 'almost', 'squeamish', 'city', 'slicker', 'where', 'here', 'see', 'hardest', 'take', 'prosthetics', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film.I', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'white', 'horse', 'maybe', 'really', 'just', 'throw', 'away', 'think', 'idea', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'pure', 'place', 'minds', 'really', 'childhood', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'unknown', 'Zombie', 'face', 'what', 'can', 'understand', 'look', 'hard', 'think', 'nostalgia', 'time', 'gone', '9/11', 'become', 'cynical', 'impulsive', 'break', 'down']",N/A

The best part of the movie is a dream laurie's having. The only time you hear any of the Halloween theme is at the end. For me that doesn't cut it. Zombie is a musician and he can't see the need in using the theme throughout this disaster of a movie?. It might have taken my mind off the fact that his wife isn't one of the greatest actors out there. This ridiculous plot involving her isn't an example of his creative mind at work, it's just a plain stupid way to have her in the whole movie. Thanks a million Rob. This just does not have the ""feel"" that a Halloween film should have. Haddonfield has turned in to a trailer park full of dirty looking characters who I never ended up caring about, especially Loomis. Loomis is the most unlikable character in the entire movie. So much so, that I caught myself wishing he wasn't in it at all. I loved the updated Loomis in 2007 but here I couldn't believe the changes that were made to what should have been an important character. See this for yourself and draw your own conclusion. If your even half a fan of the series you'll see a bad difference between this and a real Halloween film.Continuity problem: There is a scene in this film where Loomis is at a convention for the book he has writen. Before he takes the stage to answer questions, the convention crowd is seeing a clip of him interviewing young Michael. He says to Him (I can't quote exact)""Your mother won't be coming to visit you any more....""Michael answers him. In Zombies original Michael had stopped talking before his mother killed her self. So, Zombies not following the continuity he set for himself in the 1st film.

His movies are also fun to try and spot the semi famous people from horror films of the past.  Two big gripes that seem to pop up a lot is the fact that this movie is not a remake of the original Halloween II--though Zombie does cleverly start it like it is going to be.  Also, the lack of a mask for Michael for a good part of the movie.  Really the answer to both is that this is Zombie's movie.  He did this sequel so he could cut lose in whatever direction he wanted without being hamstrung by trying to make a remake.  I am glad he did his own story.  I prefer Michael in the mask, even the half torn mask he wears in the film.  Seeing his mountain man face takes away from the faceless terror that is Michael.  I also don't like the few words he speaks or the grunts.  I like a silent killer.  As for the picture itself, I found it way too dark.  I often couldn't make out what was going on.  I also didn't like the parts with Sheri Moon.  I think she is a good little actress, but her part as a ghost in this film didn't work.  It seemed like Rob needed a way to put her in the film(as he does in all of them) and came up with the ghost idea.  None of her scenes worked for me in the movie.  Laurie Strode also changed a lot from her nice original character.  Most of the film she is either angry or crying.  Her friends are all hard partying rock chicks, so I really didn't have much sympathy for any of them.  Overall I really didn't care for the film much.  I did enjoy Rob's first much more.

Thomas ""rhthomas""","[10, 15]","Rob Zombie manages the seemingly impossible with this sequel - make a movie that is actually worse than his first remake of ""Halloween"".This is the man who was asked why he included the sister storyline in his first remake since that was a plot twist at the end of the original ""Halloween 2"", and said that he hadn't seen the movie in so long he forgot that wasn't part of the plot - one would think that *watching* the iconic movie you are remaking would be first thing on the list of a competent filmmaker, but not for this guy.It follows that he never saw any of the subpar sequels to the original ""Halloween 2"", either, and is completely unaware of some of the scenes and bad ideas that had already been introduced to the ""Halloween"" franchise that he included in his ""Halloween 2"":Escape from a crashed ambulance: Halloween 4Revelation that a female relative is crazy, too, when she wears his clown costume and stabs someone: Halloween 4A psychic connection between Michael and the disturbed female relation: Halloween 5He also continues his trashing of the original characters:Both Loomis and Laurie are badly-acted and unlikable characters.The iconic image of the white mask and coveralls has been replaced; Michael's mask is now falling off his face, and there are actually a couple of times when we see him unmasked, and he looks exactly like Rob Zombie - bet that caused some chuckles on the set, huh Rob? And he now wears a hoodie (not making this up, honestly) and is referred to in internet circles as ""Hobo Myers"".The classic ""Halloween"" music is not used until the very end of the movie, when we hear ""Laurie's theme"" and the classic main title.And for someone who loved to offer simple-minded criticisms of the original ""Halloween"" (look up online/magazine interviews with Rob Zombie), he sure offers a lot of plot holes himself:His Michael is human, not supernatural, but he manages to survive several gunshots, an ambulance crash, and can overturn a car with his bare hands.How does he know where Laurie is staying?In the first movie he stopped talking after his Mother died, in this one there's a flashback scene of him talking about his dead Mother.In the first remake, Loomis had his eyes gouged out and was presumably dead. In this one, one year later, he is fine with no signs of injury.In one interview during his first remake, Zombie made a sarcastic comment that his Michael would ""not be eating any dogs in this one"", but he includes a scene like this in ""Halloween 2"".And as a hack writer/director with an inflated sense of self-worth because his inner circle dare not offer honest criticism, he offers his attempts to elevate this movie into a higher plane of celluloid existence by including scenes which he must have thought were ""arty"":A white horse being led by a lady in white (Ghost Mommy Myers) that is the folie a deux of Michael and his sister, Laurie. These scenes are numerous and are laugh-inducing.Also included are awful scenes that are intended to be funny or offensive, but are neither:A man in a crashed vehicle saying the ""F"" word dozens of times in different inflections - a scene that defies belief in its awfulness.A similar scene with Laurie, in a vehicle, saying the ""F"" word over and over again.This film is ""99% my vision"" claims Rob Zombie, but why the Weinsteins, who are notorious for the control they have over the films they release, gave final cut to this man is a mind-boggling question that only they know the answer to.",1,Awful beyond belief,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,3482,"['Rob', 'Zombie', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'sequel', 'make', 'movie', 'actually', 'worse', 'first', 'remake', 'Halloween', '.This', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'asked', 'why', 'included', 'sister', 'storyline', 'first', 'remake', 'was', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'original', 'Halloween', '2', 'said', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'long', 'forgot', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'plot', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'iconic', 'movie', 'are', 'remaking', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'thing', 'list', 'competent', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'guy.It', 'never', 'saw', 'subpar', 'sequels', 'original', 'Halloween', '2', 'either', 'completely', 'unaware', 'scenes', 'bad', 'ideas', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'introduced', 'Halloween', 'franchise', 'included', 'Halloween', '2', 'Escape', 'crashed', 'ambulance', '4Revelation', 'female', 'relative', 'crazy', 'too', 'when', 'clown', 'costume', 'stabs', 'someone', '4A', 'psychic', 'connection', 'Michael', 'disturbed', 'female', 'relation', '5He', 'also', 'trashing', 'original', 'characters', 'Loomis', 'Laurie', 'are', 'badly-acted', 'unlikable', 'characters.The', 'iconic', 'image', 'white', 'mask', 'coveralls', 'been', 'replaced', 'Michael', 'mask', 'now', 'falling', 'off', 'face', 'are', 'actually', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'see', 'unmasked', 'exactly', 'like', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'bet', 'caused', 'chuckles', 'set', 'huh', 'Rob', 'now', 'hoodie', 'not', 'making', 'up', 'honestly', 'referred', 'internet', 'circles', 'Hobo', 'Myers', '.The', 'classic', 'Halloween', 'music', 'not', 'used', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'hear', 'Laurie', 'theme', 'classic', 'main', 'title.And', 'someone', 'who', 'loved', 'offer', 'simple-minded', 'criticisms', 'original', 'Halloween', 'look', 'up', 'online/magazine', 'interviews', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'lot', 'plot', 'holes', 'Michael', 'human', 'not', 'supernatural', 'survive', 'several', 'gunshots', 'ambulance', 'crash', 'can', 'overturn', 'car', 'bare', 'hands.How', 'know', 'where', 'Laurie', 'staying', 'first', 'movie', 'stopped', 'talking', 'Mother', 'died', 'one', 'flashback', 'scene', 'talking', 'dead', 'Mother.In', 'first', 'remake', 'Loomis', 'had', 'eyes', 'gouged', 'out', 'was', 'presumably', 'dead', 'one', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'fine', 'signs', 'injury.In', 'one', 'interview', 'first', 'remake', 'Zombie', 'made', 'sarcastic', 'comment', 'Michael', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'eating', 'dogs', 'one', 'scene', 'Halloween', '2', '.And', 'hack', 'writer/director', 'inflated', 'sense', 'self-worth', 'inner', 'circle', 'dare', 'not', 'offer', 'honest', 'criticism', 'attempts', 'elevate', 'movie', 'higher', 'plane', 'celluloid', 'existence', 'including', 'scenes', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'were', 'arty', 'white', 'horse', 'being', 'led', 'lady', 'white', 'Ghost', 'Mommy', 'Myers', 'folie', 'deux', 'Michael', 'sister', 'Laurie', 'scenes', 'are', 'numerous', 'are', 'laugh-inducing.Also', 'included', 'are', 'awful', 'scenes', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'offensive', 'are', 'man', 'crashed', 'vehicle', 'saying', 'F', 'word', 'dozens', 'times', 'different', 'inflections', 'scene', 'belief', 'awfulness.A', 'similar', 'scene', 'Laurie', 'vehicle', 'saying', 'F', 'word', 'again.This', 'film', '99', '%', 'vision', 'claims', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'why', 'Weinsteins', 'who', 'are', 'notorious', 'control', 'have', 'films', 'release', 'gave', 'final', 'cut', 'man', 'mind-boggling', 'question', 'only', 'know', 'answer']",N/A

I said that movie had problems as a remake but was ok as a movie. Here it's got problems as a movie and as part of the series it wasn't good.First, what I enjoyed, I enjoyed the dark tone and the newness of the storyline. Also many of the arguments are actually close to real life arguments we may experience during our lifetimes. The deaths were gruesome, the film got tense as it went on and there was a general sense of helplessness/negativity that I usually don't like, but felt was good in this movie.Now for the problems, this really isn't Halloween II. This is PTSD for everyone involved in the first and Michael just happens to show up at the end of the movie. Loomis went back to talk but little action and seemed very different from the previous movie. Trying to feel for Laurie was almost impossible even though I think that was the point. Michael having visions doesn't make sense as he didn't seem to have them before. Even though it's the best acted scene of the movie, I hated one perticuler characters death (you can figure it out).Finally neither ending was done well. SPOILER ALERT PEOPLE SO YOU MAY WANT TO STOP.

It was long overdue and thought a great way to celebrate would be with the newly released Halloween 2. Now as you may or may not know the Sid brothers are a huge fan of the original Halloween series but never turn down the chance to check out a different concept of Myers. Original Myers has always been one of the most feared characters in horror history with good reason. He's an unstoppable force of sheer terror, but did lack in a few departments. Zombie's version of Myers takes removes any lack of fear due to the fact that he's a giant lunatic with superhuman strength. Never before have the killings been more gruesome. Say farewell to the typical stabbings as he goes to new lengths to keep your jaw dropped in pure shock. We'd even put money on the fact that Zombie's Myers would kick the snot out of original Myers hands down.In Halloween 2 Zombie took his own spin on things making the film entirely his own idea. Yeah there's a little bit of hospital action going down, but nothing like the original Halloween 2. We pick up with a very jacked up pill addicted Laurie Strode trying to erase the memory of Myers prior attacks. With Loomis pushing his new top selling book, that exploits Laurie at every turn, all the old wounds are opened up while Myers gets back to business as usual. While seeing visions of his mother along with a young version of himself (CRAZY CRAZY) he becomes more and more enraged demolishing anyone in his path on his quest to finish off his sister Laurie. Overall the film was pretty solid but was almost too much. We've never seen a Myers this brutal leaving us legitimately freaked out which is what earned it 4 stars. So if there's any question to who is king of the slasher, there is no other correct answer besides new Myers.

As it turned out I gave Zombie props for providing everyone with a ""re-make"" instead of a ""re-do"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.The first half of Zombie's 2007 Halloween was devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie started by showing Myers' at age 10. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. In fact, the first half of Zombie's first Halloween movie was so well done that I was saying to myself as I was watching that ""this is a great movie."" But then the second half just collapsed with too many clich&eacute; horror movie ""oh that would never really happen"" moments. The whole point of the first half of Zombie's first Halloween movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.And Zombie's 2009 Halloween II pick's up right where the first one left off, and it takes the unbelievable and the supernatural aspects of the first movie and expands on them resulting in kind of a mess of a movie. And speaking of mess, the Myers murders in Halloween II are brutal. Not so much gory as plain outright savagely brutal. So if that's your bag, then at least you get that with Halloween II. Halloween II has some flashbacks to Halloween I, but it's not even the same kid playing young Michael Myers; in H2 it's some look-alike kid that's unremarkable at best.If you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptations of Carpenter's Halloween franchise will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was entertained by Zombie's Halloween, but the second one, the one that this review is attached to, left me feeling that maybe Zombie gave us one Halloween too many.",2,One Halloween Too Many,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,2346,"['finally', 'watchedHalloween', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'attempt', 're-invent', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'character', 'version', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'done', 'masterfully', 'withJohn', 'Carpenter', 'original', 'turned', 'out', 'gave', 'Zombie', 'props', 'providing', 'everyone', 're-make', 'instead', 're-do', 're-make', 'when', 'director', 'old', 'film', 'sometimes', 'even', 'classic', 'different', 'ideally', '*better*', 're-do', 'when', 'director', 'film', 'nothing', 'original', 'Zombie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'made', '*better*', 'movie', 'original', 'sure', 'did', 'give', 'movie', 'unique', 'spin.The', 'first', 'half', 'Zombie', '2007', 'Halloween', 'was', 'devoted', 'telling', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'story', 'movie', 'started', 'showing', 'Myers', 'age', '10', 'time', 'Zombie', 'how', 'Myers', 'went', 'troubled', 'tormented', 'demented', 'completely', 'psychopathic', 'kid', 'played', 'Myers', 'age', '10', 'was', 'outstanding', 'fact', 'first', 'half', 'Zombie', 'first', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'saying', 'was', 'watching', 'great', 'movie', 'then', 'second', 'half', 'just', 'collapsed', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'really', 'happen', 'moments', 'whole', 'point', 'first', 'half', 'Zombie', 'first', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'seemed', 'attempt', 'show', 'Myers', 'was', 'human', 'just', 'psychopath', 'go', 'out', 'window', 'second', 'half', 'Myers', 'showing', 'few', 'immortal', 'traits.And', 'Zombie', '2009', 'Halloween', 'II', 'pick', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'unbelievable', 'supernatural', 'aspects', 'first', 'movie', 'expands', 'resulting', 'kind', 'mess', 'movie', 'speaking', 'mess', 'Myers', 'murders', 'Halloween', 'II', 'are', 'brutal', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'gory', 'plain', 'outright', 'savagely', 'brutal', 'So', 'bag', 'then', 'least', 'get', 'Halloween', 'II', 'Halloween', 'II', 'flashbacks', 'Halloween', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'kid', 'playing', 'young', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'H2', 'look-alike', 'kid', 'unremarkable', 'best.If', ""'re"", 'preservationist', ""n't"", 'want', 'classics', 'messed', 'then', 'Zombie', 'adaptations', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'franchise', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'angry', 'unsatisfied', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'entertained', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'second', 'one', 'one', 'review', 'attached', 'left', 'feeling', 'maybe', 'Zombie', 'gave', 'one', 'Halloween', 'too', 'many']",N/A

1291332,A3R4XIOYH1OOPV,B002V3HT2G,"Stephanie C ""Stephanie""","[2, 4]","Before I even get into the review of this movie as a whole, I've seen so many reviews of ppl having no clue to the relevance of what we see throughout the entire movie.. Michael's mother standing next to a white horse. This is because to appreciate and understand what's happening, you HAVE to pay attention from the 1st second.This isn't a movie you can put in, then walk away or you'll miss the most important part of the explanation of what you later continue to see. At the beginning of the movie, there's a quote of the meaning of certain dreams, i.e the white horse. It also explains (as the movie progresses) why Michael himself is so much different in his killings with alot more rage and anger to them than we've seen before. You also have to remember this is a Rob Zombie movie and alot of his movies make you have to think instead of everything being very black and white and spelled out for you scene by scene.If you miss that quote at the beginning, the whole movie loses alot of meaning and opens the door for alot of confusion. It's also not one that you can talk on the phone for 10 minutes and just pick up knowing what's going on. It's a MUST to READ the beginning where the definition of the white horse and other meanings are to understand why we keep seeing a white horse and his mother in a white dress standing next to it throughout the movie. Too many ppl seem to miss that and then have no clue why it's happening.We all know Michael is crazy, but in this movie, Rob Zombie gives Michael a voice through young Michael and let's us see what it is that Michael sees to make him do what he does. In other words, since Michael never talks, if something needs to be said, it's young Michael who does the talking.Before Michael's mother killed herself in the 1st Zombie 'Halloween', it flashes back to his mother giving Michael a white horse while he's locked up. Young Michael tells his mother it reminds him of a dream he had. When she asks what the dream was about, he tells her she was wearing a white dress, how beautiful she looked, and how she was walking with a white horse promising to take him home.She tells him when he sees the white horse she gave him to think of her. She meant it as any mom would in the sense of when he looks at the horse she gave him, to think of her and it'll be his reminder that she's always with him. In Michael's mind, it takes on a whole new meaning because this is the vision he sees before he attacks as some kind of message from her... mom in a white dress standing next to a white horse promising to take him home. But in his mind, it also means nobody goes ""home"" until they can all be together by finding his sister and bringing her home too.With that said, this movie starts off exactly where the last Rob Zombie version left off. Laurie is running down the street all bloody after she shot Michael. Time goes by and she's now living with her best friend that survived and her friends father (The Sheriff). She's still dealing with everything that happened. She has horrible nightmares that are pretty creepy, and has completely changed from her sweet and innocent look she used to have. She goes to therapy and is having a difficult time because Halloween is coming up of course and she's still having trouble dealing with the death of her parents and why this guy was after her in the 1st place.Once again, Michael is after his sister, killing anyone who gets in his way on his mission. There's Laurie's life and then Michaels life you'll keep seeing, but the 2 seem to intertwine. They have some kind of connection as many of the things she sees, feels, experiences, and even tastes is somehow connected to what Michaels doing, experiencing, tasting and feeling. Soon enough she finds out through a tell all book that Dr. Loomis wrote of all that took place and gives away who Laurie Strode really is (Michaels sister). Laurie reads it and freaks out of course and thats when things get going as he's getting closer to her. The closer he gets, the deeper this strange connection is where she's almost becoming a part of him.Michael keeps seeing his mother and the white horse as their mother keeps letting Michael know it's time to bring Laurie ""home"" with him.. just like his dream at the beginning.It's also not the same young Michael that was in the 1st movie but don't let that throw you off. People have complained about that but the kid who played young Michael in the 1st one is a teen now. You can't have flashbacks of a child when that child is now a large teenager. You need to keep that in mind and not let it distract you.Michael finds Laurie as he always does and it just gets even more strange from there with what she's seeing and what's really happening. Her reality is off. To explain why is open to interpretation and also would give away too much. Overall, this movie is good but you have to pay attention to make the movie itself even make sense when it comes to this odd connection between Michael, Laurie, and their mom.As a footnote, there was something missing throughout the entire movie that I think took away alot of what the Halloween movies are famous for. The creepy piano score music wasn't there. You only hear it once at the end of the movie and that's a HUGE part of what makes the Halloween movies so great.

1291333,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B002V3HT2G,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 7]","Continuing on exactly from where 2007's excellentHalloween - Unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)left off, the second chapter of this new incarnation of the Halloween legend takes the story into radically new territory, greatly building on elements hinted at in the 2007 movie or, in some cases, in the original continuity, and creating new facets from scratch.  It also brings back in some elements that were mostly missing from the 2007 remake but were dominant in the original series, including edging Michael Myers back in the direction of being something more than a warped psychopath, something inhuman: it's doubtful, for example, that any mortal human could have survived the ending of the previous movie, let alone come back for more.  There are other glimmers of elements which may or may not be supernatural.  In contrast to these emerging elements, there's a gritty, uncomfortable raw-ness to both the movie and the character that were never present in the earlier entries.  Whereas the original Michael Myers was so utterly unhuman and almost otherworldy - it was part of the ongoing subtext that Michael was really a physical incarnation of the 'boogeyman' - that his longtime psychiatrist Dr. Loomis refered to Michael as 'it' rather than 'he'; the Michael Myers in the current movies is, despite his preternatural strength and resistance to physical injury, at times all too human.  As in the 2007 movie, the question of whether Michael is twisted and insane or just raw evil is answered: he's both.  It's obvious the character's mind is warped, but it's just as obvious that not all the brutality, aggression and sadism of the character can be attributed to a damaged psyche: it's the real Michael.We see the world through Michael Myers's eyes in certain scenes - where his dead mother is still present and directing his actions, where Michael's younger self is there and interacts with the older version, and where there's frequently the strange appearance of a white horse, which is said in psychological terms to represent vast amounts of inner rage when seen in a dream or vision.Halloween II brings back almost all of the signifigant surviving characters from Halloween 2007 (and some of the dead ones, through visions and flashbacks), which is a welcome factor.  Most of the characters have changed signifigantly in the wake of that movie's events.  Among the most striking changes are those in Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who's psychologically disturbed and whose character continues to darken in her own inner rage as the movie progreses.  Anyone who saw the 2007 movie or is at all familiar with the Halloween mythos knows that Laurie is really Michael Myers's younger sister, and anyone who saw the movies in the original series (especially Parts 4-6) knows that the idea that there might be something 'wrong' not only with Michael but with other members of his bloodline was an evolving plot thread.One thing that I found occuring in Halloween II that's occasionally been trotted out in other movies but has Never worked so well as it has here, is the recurring sensation that much of what we're seeing on screen may not be real, but happening in one of the character's heads.  That's usually annoying; here it's frightening.  The idea that it may not be 'real' but may actually be happening simultaneously in More than one of the character's heads is just plain eerie.There are other unique factors at work too: it's rare that a movie, including a horror movie, can have so much brutal, gory violence on-screen and yet still leave the door open that there's much Worse happening offscreen.  Unsettling.  Another rarity to movies in general, although director Rob Zombie tends to work this into his own films on a regular basis: the movie will start off seeming to take place in such a nihilistic, ugly world, populated predominantly by unlikable, totally amoral characters.  But then as it progresses, you meet other much more sympathetic characters, or you find yourself warming up to some of the originally unlikable ones (one of the returning characters has changed for the worse, but you find yourself starting to find more redeeming values in him as it goes along).  An example of this dichotomy: in the opening of the movie, an ambulance carrying away the bodies of victims from the first movie has its driver and attendant discussing how much they'd like to have sex with the corpse of one of the female victims.  From the rather nasty, unpleasant tone this little moment sets, you'd never expect elements to crop in like the 'adoption' of Laurie by Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif)'s family or the way they continue to try and help her even as she grows more abusive as her personality darkens.  The ties of loyalty and extended family between the survivors are handled with great effect and even tenderness.  Even Laurie, even as she's darkening, has those feelings: she doesn't want to be growing increasingly aggressive, but is losing control of herself.  The way you get to know the characters makes the fates that befall some of them hit like sledgehammers.All this talk of the emotional ties and loyalties between characters doesn't mean that this is a tv drama-of-the-week treatment of Halloween.  It's a dark (the darkest in the series), psychologically disturbing, relentless horror movie.  The thing that so many of horror's detractors (who usually don't seem to have actually watched that many of its movies) fail to get is that being a vicious horror movie doesn't preclude any other elements from also being part of the package.Halloween II won't sit well with all fans.  It's less of an 'awesome, fun horror thrill ride' than many entries in the slasher-type field; its horrendously brutal, coarse, and disturbs on a very emotional level.  That said, it's just as great as the other kinds of slashers, just in a very different way.  One thing that can inarguably said for the Halloween remakes at this point: they're not just repeating what the original series did so well.  They're really forging their own identity, and it's a very dark, ruthless identity.Killer ending to boot, setting the potential for the next chapter to develop and differentiate itself even

But he tried to push ""zombie"" type stuff in this movie and not only did it not work, but it ruined the whole point.In the original movies, the character of Michael is mysterious, he is silent, and there is almost a sadness or feeling that he is missing something deep down. In the Zombie films though (at least this one, haven't seen the first one for a long time) this character is completely gone. Now Michael is apparently some old guy with a beard who eats raw dog meat and actually makes grunting noises while he kills. Now his character is protrayed as angry, ruthless, and just out to hurt people, completely unlike the original Michael.The main thing I hate about this film is that Rob Zombie tried to make this into some sort of shocking grindhouse zombie movie. Michael's sister apparently lives in this middle class house, but her bedroom and bathroom look like the back room of some heavy metal band. Posters with cuss words all over them, a poster of Charles Manson, basically something that has nothing to do with the story but had to be added because it's a ""zombie"" movie now. When she finds out she is Michael's sister and becomes angry, she insists that she wants to go partying (really realistic). So they go to some party with people in really unrealistic mostly gothic looking costumes and topless women just hanging around dancing (is this a halloween party or a Zombie concert?).The death scenes just *had* to be made especially disgusting, such as Michael stomping on someone's head, sawing someone's head off, etc. As expected there are crude jokes about dead girls and general depravity.In the first movie I was actually interested in the storyline about Michael's long lost sister. In this movie it gets old. Now the ghost of her dead mother and Michael as a child follow him around and there is some weak storyline where Michael is supposed to find her so they can become a family again. In the end there is no conclusion to this.Strippers, violence, sex, goth chicks, heavy metal, parties, topless women, the F bomb repeated over and over, am I missing anything? this whole film made me feel like I was watching a backstage movie of a Rob Zombie concert.

I understood all the dialogue, what was going on psychologically within each of the characters, and sincerely felt Laurie's rage and agony.  It all made complete sense to me.  But once again... I have PTSD myself.  Those who don't know anything about mental illness--feel VERY BLESSED--and PRAY that you never have to know.  Michael is not ""The Boogey-Man"" anymore.  He's a real human being with real, uncontrollable rage burning inside of him... which to me is scarier than some ""masked monster.""

1291340,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B002V3HT2G,The Piper at the Gates,"[4, 6]","Well I would first warn any readers that this review may contain some spoilers, but honestly, I don't think it would even really matter. In fact, I might be doing some of you guys a favor by telling you what happens in the film rather than you having to actually sit and watch it! Ok ok..maybe this film is not THAT bad, but it isn't good by any means, and you shouldn't be expecting anything great, especially if you've seen the first installment of the Zombie remake. And that's why I definitely wasn't expecting anything good before going to the theaters to watch this film, but I left the theater just as disappointed as I did after viewing the first remake. But since I'm a big horror fan, and have purchased all the other Halloween films, including the first Zombie film, I had to buy this one too, and decided to give this one a couple of more viewings before writing this review. But to say my opinion has changed any since I viewed this film the first time, that really isn't the case. Just like the first film, there are just way too many things wrong with this film for me to really enjoy it.So where do I begin to list the many problems I have with this film? How bout the way Rob Zombie dupes the audience into thinking the movie is going to be actually semi-decent in the first 25 minutes of the movie? Talk about being completely disappointed! When watching this for the first time, and seeing the hospital chase scene, like that of the original Halloween 2, I was thinking to myself..could it be? Has Rob Zombie redeemed himself here and actually made a straight-forward, in-your-face film that pays true homage to the original films? My interest was peaked..and I was genuinely excited..until of course, Laurie wakes up, and you find out that Zombie just used the oldest trick in the book to fool, and in my case, disappoint his audience.Now onto other problems..first off, the Laurie Strode character. The way her character is portrayed, it's just really hard to sympathize with her. For the most part, she comes off as a bitch, using the F word every other word in many scenes (which can be blamed on bad script writing as well). She's sad and depressed one minute, then is a wild, care-free party chick the next..there are really no qualities about her that make me want to care about her character at all. And the Sam Loomis character, where do I begin here? His character was so painful to watch. Just a complete travesty compared to the original Loomis character played by Donald Pleasance. Why turn the Loomis character into a money hungry, self-centered bastard? Then only have him ""turn"" good in the last 10 minutes of the film, like its gonna make a difference..its completely unbelievable. Now I'm not blaming Mr. McDowell for his performance. For the kind of character I'm sure he was told to portray, he did an alright job.  Again, its the overall writing of the character that's so bad. Also, there's a new actor that plays young Michael Myers rather than Daeg Faerch. And although Chase Vanek looks the part much better than Faerch did, his acting leaves much to be desired, with all his lines being almost read in a monotone voice. The same could be pretty much said about Sheri Moon's performance as well, which was mediocre at best.Now on to Michael Myers..just when I thought Rob Zombie had done enough damage to his character in the first film, his continues to do so in this one. The grunting when he's stabbing people, the hoodie he wears (are u kidding me, a hoodie?!), the 10 little cut scenes where it shows him walking through some field like Bigfoot, giving him superpowers to be able to turn cars over, and worst of all..showing his face time and time again! Since Zombie claims to be such a horror fan, I would think he would have learned something from suspense master Alfred Hitchcock, and that is, many things should be left up the audience's imagination. The great thing about Michael Myers is that blank, emotionless mask. You don't know what is behind it, and that's a great thing. But when you show his face, and he looks just like some big bearded guy (actually, he looks like Zakk Wylde!), then it takes away from the character, and is much less scary or mysterious. But even that isn't as bad as what happens at the end of the film, when Michael actually SPEAKS..yes, speaks! This is a different ending from that of the theatrical version, and overall, I thought this unrated directors was actually better than that version, but when Michael utters the word ""Die!"" to Loomis at the end, I just shook my head in disgust.Much like the first film, I feel that Zombie just missed the mark here. First off, why have Michael's mother as the main catalyst for his rage? For originality, I give him a 1 for that. Hasn't he ever heard of any little movies called Friday the 13th?! The point of Michael Myers doing the evil things he does, is just that..he's pure evil. You don't know his motives, and again, not knowing something is scarier then trying to give an explanation to everything. Not only does Zombie give you this explanation, but he runs it into the ground by showing scene after scene of a white horse or Michael's mother, and young Michael, while they're talking off bad dialogue. Yeah, we get it, enough is enough..the audience doesn't need to be reminded of it every 5 minutes. It felt like more or less that Zombie just put those scenes in to give his real-life wife more screen time.With all the problems I had with this film, I did enjoy a couple of things. Again, the first 25 minutes of the film were good. And I do have to say, that for the most part, this version is better than the theatrical version too. And though I've read some reviews that put down Zombie down for showing more blood and gore, and making the film more violent, this is something I think he did very well. The kill scenes, though simplistic (mostly just stabbing, stomping, or smashing), were done very good.Maybe I'm just too hard on this film, I just can't like this movie. Its probably a bit better than the first Halloween, since you're not having to sit through an hour of crappy backstory about Michael's childhood. At least this one jumps right into the story. But the writing and imagining of many of the characters are just plain bad. I understand Zombie wanted to do something different here, but at some point, enough is enough. It's one thing to re-image something, its another thing to completely change established characters and story. With just a little tweaking, this could be an entirely different film, having nothing to do with the Halloween series at all. Slap another title on it, and there you have it. And I think I would have really liked these two films, if that was the case. However, when remaking or re-imaging an established classic film, there should be some boundaries. Simply put, Zombie should just stick to creating original material.",2,2.5 Stars: More of the Same From Mr. Zombie,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,6912,"['Well', 'would', 'first', 'warn', 'readers',

1291341,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B002V3HT2G,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[21, 31]","I don't even know where to start......First and foremost I am going to put this out there; I do not care for Rob Zombie. I never really cared for his music, not to say it is bad it just doesn't do anything for me.  So when I first heard he was going into the realm of cinema I wasn't too excited about it.  I totally detested ""House of a 1000 Corpses"", awful.  My friend suggested to me to watch his version of ""Halloween"" claiming that it was actually pretty good.  Being a fan of the old school ""Halloween"" flicks I figure I would give it a shot.  I must confess that I enjoyed aspects of ""Zombie's Halloween"" (mainly Malcolm McDowell version of Dr. Sam Loomis) but overall didn't care for it.  I figured I might as well watch the sequel, what a mistake.....I will take back my original thoughts about Zombie's 2007 version of ""Halloween""; I appreciate it much more after I watch this schlock of a sequel.  In stead of providing text why this movie was awful I am going to note some key points.* Don't know why Michael Myers was so pro-mask in the first film and in this sequel he would take it off quite a bit.* Michael Myers looked like The Undertaker (the wrestler).* Michael Myers eats a dog.* I never thought I would get sick of seeing a white horse and a lady dressed in white. The lady in white is Michael's mom; the role is played poorly by Zombie's wife. I don't know who the horse is.* Why waste 20 plus minutes on a no reason hospital dream?* The character development of Dr. Sam Loomis wasn't believable as a money/media whore, given what had transpired in the previous film.  Then the last minute ""change of heart""?* If a dollar could be given to repay the ""government bailout"" every time Laurie Strode cried, this country would be out of a recession.* Speaking of Laurie Strode, Scout Taylor-Compton's acting was so horrible. Was she supposed to be a whiny Emo girl? I lost count how many times she used the F word and stated her life ""sucked"".* Rob Zombie loves using the F word.* The acting in this movie was truly poor.* The over the top blood and guts was basically torture porn.  It is like Zombie is trying so hard to be ""dark"" and ""disturbing"" and it comes off comical. For instance, Michael Myers was going out of his way to kill people. Some of these moments I was laughing so hard it hurt.* Every character was unlikeable; I truly didn't care what happened to anyone.  I am still questioning myself why I didn't turn the movie off.* The entire supernatural/psyche aspect of Myers and Strode's relationship was totally out of left field.* Does Margot Kidder know Rob Zombie?  Her two small scenes seemed really out of place.* Did I mention the white horse and the lady dressed in white? Oh and Michael Myers eats a dog.This movie didn't receive the praise as its predecessor and I can see why.  This movie at the end of the day was unnecessary; everything was really tied up in the first film.  This movie was nothing more that a pot boiler.

1291342,A376GITYM7MQ6J,B002V3HT2G,Thiago Sardenberg,"[7, 10]","I'm a fan of the Halloween movies. But unfortunately, the last movie I had left the theatres really satisfyed with was Halloween:H20, back in '98. I still think the series should have stopped there, with Jamie Lee Curtis killing Michael.But they decided to continue. And they made a huge mistake called Halloween: Resurrection. So, the only way to go ""on"" would be to reboot.And there came Zombie. Now, I like him as a director. He'd done the amazing The Devil's Rejects. I thought Halloween could, maybe, use some of the brutality Rob would surely bring to it. After all, the Michael in Resurrection could not scare a 7-year-old in the dark.Zombie did a good job with the movie, but there was something off about it. It was like seeing Halloween (78) being violated somehow. I can't help but feel that way. The movie was different, but close enough to the original to make me uncomfortable.Now H2 is another story. Rob's taken his vision to the next level and we've been offered a whole new interpretation of the story.I think the overuse of profanity may make everybody a bit uncomfortable (and maybe takes some people off the movie), but, you go past it, and you have a very good story of people dealing with a post-traumatic experience and also, with one another, in the background.I think this is actually one of the Halloween movies that really invested on characters, and it is heartbreaking to see what they go through.Michael is more vicious than I have ever seen. he's brutal. merciless. in a word, scary. And it felt great to feel that way.The end is... interesting. If this is the end of the Halloween movies with these characters in this world, it's fine. Makes us wonder what could happen next. If it's not, I wonder where the story would go... and if Michael would be involved somehow. Is Halloween without MM Halloween?The last Halloween III (in the eighties) tried and failed.

At first I thought a remake would be interesting with Rob Zombie as the director, but he totally blew it on both movies, especially this one. It's just like any other Rob Zombie movie except it is set to Halloween. It's just a bunch of brutality mixed with bad acting, trailer-trash stereotypes, and hallucinations on the part of the protagonist and the antagonist. The camera shots are dull and boring (and shaky - I think that particular 'horror effect' is ridiculous and actually makes movies look worse), a far cry from the original series, which always established truly creative and horrific shots when the Shape appeared.

1291346,A1BDJWXH77PAHO,B002V3HT2G,"Timothy Wilkinson ""Tim Wilkinson""","[2, 3]","I find that as a filmmaker Rob Zombie has been struggling to find his voice.  House of 1000 Corpses marked his transition from a music video director to a narrative storyteller and suffered from lack of story and an over abundance of random imagery thrown in for shock value.Devil's Rejects was a much more clearly defined narrative effort that borrowed heavily from his favorite movies.  Basically, he was now retelling someone else's story while developing through his own eyes.  Though a tad too brutal for my liking.I think that he was put in a tough spot on Halloween.  Let's be honest: there was no way he could win this one.  It seemed to me that he had nailed his visual style and his work with actors had definitely improved, but now he had to contend with an existing mythos that dictate his story.  I wonder what this would have been like had he not been compelled to show the origin of the mask and whatnot.  This movie almost worked for me; it just felt like he was still holding back or being forced to color in between the lines a bit too much.Here there be spoilers.That being said, I really want to like Halloween II, if at least for some of the risks it takes.  I love the idea of Laurie dealing with the trauma and I thought that the writing and performance of her character were spot on.  This seriously could have been a movie about her life after the massacre without Meyers ever returning and I would have like it.  The same goes for Dr. Loomis.  I love the direction his character goes in-- except he doesn't really have a character arc or any reason for being in this movie.  The scene with Weird Al is genius.  But none of this really matters.  I even like crazy homeless guy Micheal.  What I didn't like what the stupid white horse/ghost mom hallucinations that follow him around.  That alone killed this movie for me.  Why can't he just be a psychotic killer?The problem with the sequel is the same problem that affects 99% of all sequels.  Instead of following the story to where it would logically want to go, sequels are forced to bring back all the main players to basically relive the events of the first film.  There's no room for character growth.  There's no room for them to exist outside of what happened in the first film.  The possibilities for a sequel are endless, but often overlooked.  How would this play out if Michael were at-large and killing in other towns but never returned to Haddonfield?  How would that affect Laurie?  or Dr. Loomis?  I don't know, I'm probably the only person who would want to see a movie like that, but my point is that Zombie got SO CLOSE to telling an interesting story all his own and then caved during the last half and let it devolve into the same crap that we always see.

The movie took a deeper look at Michael Myer's childhood which was interesting. Then in 2009 he releases a sequel Halloween II, now this one is not exactly a remake of the original sequel it's a sequel to Rob's remake of the classic horror film. The movie starts with a flashback scene which explains previous events and then we see Michael's sister Laurie covered with blood who just shot him getting carried in ambulance to the hospital. We see that Michael is also being carried there and as you can expect in from a sequel he's not dead from the shot and he kills everyone in sight at the hospital to finish what he started, kill his sister. This sequel didn't feature much that was interesting besides some of the killing sequences and was a disappointment all along, if you were a fan of the original or even the remake you WILL be disappointed, I liked both and I certainly was.Now there are two versions being released on Blue-Ray and DVD the theatrical version and the director's cut. Rob Zombie said that the director's cut is very different; according to some other reviewers this version of Halloween II is much better, I don't doubt it but the theatrical version wasn't good in my opinion. I wasted money on the theatrical version so why would I waste some more on the director's cut? I liked the remake but this sequel was just awful.

After seeing RZ'S first two movies, I have newfound respect for what he did with Halloween and it's sequel.Let me start by saying after watching the first one a couple times that it grew on me-and Rob Zombie contacting John Carpenter saying he wanted to 'redo his Halloween' when JC said 'make it yours' and he did. The language is kind of excessive, but the storyline in these makes up for that.I recently saw Devil's Rejects and 1,000 Corpses-didn't care much for them, but Rob's version of Halloween, I like em. I also like Sherri Moon Zombie in both films as Michael's mother, but a few other charecters stand out as well, Brad Dourif does a nice job as Sherrif Brackett, and Malcolm McDowell does a decent Dr. Loomis, but to me these films should be taken on their own merits and not compared to JC's classic, although with a horror classic this well known, comparing is hard...not to do.I'm not saying that RZ'S version is better, in fact, his version is alot darker, but in many ways he didn't just re-make the story, he re-invented the franchise. Any fan of Michael Myers can certainly appreciate what Rob came up with, although I'm sure some people who enjoyed JC's won't like this one, some won't, but you know what they say' don't judge a book by it's cover, basically, give both of these a chance before assuming you won't like em.",4,better than I expected,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,1379,"['Ignore', 'review', 'first', 'one', 'seeing', 'RZ', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'newfound', 'respect', 'what', 'did', 'Halloween', 'sequel.Let', 'start', 'saying', 'watching', 'first', 'one', 'couple', 'times', 'grew', 'me-and', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'contacting', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'saying', 'wanted', ""'redo"", 'Halloween', 'when', 'JC', 'said', ""'make"", 'did', 'language', 'kind', 'excessive', 'storyline', 'up', 'that.I', 'recently', 'saw', 'Devil', 'Rejects', '1,000', 'Corpses-did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Rob', 'version', 'Halloween', 'like', 'em', 'also', 'like', 'Sherri', 'Moon', 'Zombie', 'films', 'Michael', 'mother', 'few', 'other', 'charecters', 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'nice', 'job', 'Sherrif', 'Brackett', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'decent', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'compared', 'JC', 'classic', 'horror', 'classic', 'well', 'known', 'comparing', 'hard', 'not', 'do.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'RZ', 'version', 'better', 'fact', 'version', 'alot', 'darker', 'many', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 're-make', 'story', 're-invented', 'franchise', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'can', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Rob', 'came', 'up', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'JC', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'basically', 'give', 'chance', 'assuming', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'em']",N/A

In all honesty, this film does seem to be a step up from Zombie's previous entry, but that's not really saying much as almost any goofball with a camcorder could probably whip up a more decent movie than Zombie can with tons of money at his disposal. At any rate, Zombie seems to tone down the psychological mumbo-jumbo that permeated throughout his first film, which would be a good thing if he didn't replace it with just as heavy-handed spiritual mumbo-jumbo that has something to do with Michael reforming his family at any cost.To this end, you get a lot of shots of Sheri Moon Zombie walking around in a flowing white dress like some sort of celestial being and toting a white horse that has some sort of ham-handed link to Michael's state of mind. Even with an opening quote that sort-of explains the whole 'white horse' schtick, that whole plot point really just serves the dual purpose of allowing Zombie to try some artsy-fartsy film composition and to shoehorn his wife into the film yet again. She mostly goes around muttering cryptic lines that are supposed to mean something, but I'm pretty sure these scenes are there so Rob can get some sort of fantasy Ridley Scott aspirations out of his system.So, with that counting as the motivation for Michael (more or less), it's on to a film filled with just as many unlikable characters as the first one. Returning as Laurie Strode is Scout-Taylor Compton, who manages the rare feat of being even more annoying than in the first film. Obviously, she didn't take any acting lessons in between the two films and here she is, yet again, to force the audience to not even remotely like the film's central protagonist. There's no two ways around it - she's terrible, terrible, terrible. Need convincing? Watch the scene where she finds out she's Michael's sister and then runs to her work pals to party it up because she's tired of being the good girl. At one point, she exclaims: ""I want to party! I mean, f--- it, guys..."" in one of cinema's all-time worst line readings. It's so embarassing, it physically hurts. I mean, my friends and I made our own backyard films and we knew our acting was terrible, but this here... this right here... is supposedly a major motion picture and this is what we get for our lead? This girl needs to stop, take a breath, and reconsider her choice of profession. Sure, I'm being hard on her, but it's the truth. Here you have a character who was made sympathetic and likable in the previous incarnation by Jamie Lee Curtis (and it was the role that effectively launched her career) and I'm not saying Compton has to do the same thing, but just some sort of attempt at acting would be appreciated. Not this flailing around, screaming nonsense. Have you ever seen a kid in a department store completely lose it and start going into a fit because they don't want to be in the store anymore? That's kind of what Compton's acting is like and it's just as annoying. The average filmgoer will also have the same reaction that the average shopper would have upon seeing this: ""please remove this screaming child from my sight. Please leave it at home before subjecting the general public to this menace."" If there were ever a more distinct vision that would endorse birth control, I have yet to find it.Anyways, she's useless and is just as grating as the last film. Also returning is Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett - one of only two likable characters in the film (the other being her dad Sheriff Brackett, played by Brad Dourif). She's a little more toned down in this film and a heckuva lot more likable. Unfortunately, she doesn't get to do much besides be a doormat for Laurie's drama. Ultimately, her fate is sealed and it looks like she won't be back for the next installment, which is sad because this series needed more Danielle Harris (once again, I'm left wondering how much better this film would be if Harris had played Laurie Strode. Then again, I also wonder how much better this series would be if they'd stop letting Rob Zombie wander on set to direct things.)Malcolm McDowell is back as well, but it's such a thankless role that it really doesn't seem to matter whether he's here or not. It's interesting to see the character of Sam Loomis pull away from being the ultimate force of good and turn into the ultimate force of douche, but I guess I just don't get the purpose of it. Typically, Loomis is the yin to Michael's yang and it's a bit like having a Sherlock Holmes with no Moriarty the way Zombie presents him here. To be honest, I don't mind screwing with the formula, but there's no one here who really provides any sort of a threat to Michael and I guess it just seems to make the confrontations all the more meaningless because whatever's going on with Michael is going on inside of his head (which is filled with white ponies and Sheri Moon Zombie uttering bizarre fortune cookie dialogue.)Like the first film, it's fun to pick out the random cameos from faces that may or may not be familiar - hey, Margot Kidder! Is that Dauber from ""Coach""? Oh, Frogurt from ""Lost""... nice to see you... and there you go through a car windshield... Bye! Other than these little moments, there's not much else in the way of casting that's anything to comment on. So, on to the film itself...The film picks up from where the last film left off and it sort of jumps over major plot points without too much to-do about it. Laurie shot Michael in the face at the end of the last movie, but here he is walking around like some sort of ersatz Unabomber. He's mostly just hanging out in a shack somewheres, biding his time until next Halloween (actually two Halloweens from the previous Halloween - guess he took a year off to travel... or eat dogs... or whatever...) Though everyone makes a big deal about Michael's body disappearing, nobody seems to have gone looking for it and while I'm not sure how far away he is from Haddonfield in this movie, it sure seems like the cops gave up pretty quickly on finding him. Or maybe they never even looked for him in the first place - I dunno; cops in these types of films never seem to bother with procedure or with basic police work, so I guess it's okay. Laurie's still bothered by her previous encounter with Michael - so much so, that she has a 20 minute dream sequence involving a hospital after her initial attack from the first film (I guess this is a bit of an homage to the original Halloween II, but Zombie wisely chose not to restrict his sequel just to this one setting.) She's living with the Brackett's and, in general, just being kind of a pain in the ass (there's one scene where she hangs out with her new work friends and they rock out to ""Kick Out the Jams"" - which blew my mind that these kids would even know of that song, but I guess this is one aspect of teenage life that Zombie got right, whether intentionally or unintentionally. I'm not a music snob by any means, but I always found it funny when teenagers start to discover music that was made before today. They always seem to ignore any sort of context in which the song came about and instead choose to just rock out - kind of like listening to a 60's era protest song, but being completely ignorant about anything having to do with Vietnam. It's a moment that's just kind of humorous, exciting and sad all at once.)Sorry about that tangent... so, Halloween comes around and Michael makes his way to Haddonfield and kills pretty much anything that gets in between him and his sister. There's a lot of Michael just walking into situations where he kills everything in sight and it sort of makes you wish for the way they did things in the old ""Halloween"" films where Michael would just drive to wherever he was going. There was no screwing around with random rednecks, strip joint a-holes or little kids who never learned not to talk to strangers. As funny as the thought of Michael Meyers driving around town was to me in the old films, I do kind of miss that as it gave the films a weird sort of charm that was lacking in your typical slasher film of the era. At any rate, Michael eventually gets to his sister and there's a lot of blah-blah-blah about being a family again, but Loomis finally shows up and everyone fires a lot of rounds of bullets into the Big Double M and he supposedly dies (then again, he was shot in the face in the first film, so why anyone thinks this is going to work this time is beyond me... then again, we've already mentioned that these cops aren't firing on all cylinders here, so whatever.) Then the movie ends with a completely ridiculous ending that tries to be arty-farty and just downright retarded all at the same time. I don't really know what Zombie's going for here at the end and, honestly, I don't care. I hate Laurie in this film, so anything having to do with her just goes over my head because I can't work up enough investment in the character. In fact, I just found myself thinking of other things whenever Laurie was on screen. Things such as the following:1.) What era does this movie take place in? I asked this in the last film as well and this film seems to not conform to any specific timeline either. It's clearly a post-2000 era, but all that's ever on TV is old-ass cartoons and The Moody Blues (singing ""Nights in White Satin"" - presumably because Sheri Moon Zombie wanders around in white satin... subtlety doesn't seem to be Rob Zombie's strong point.)2.) Though Michael killed a lot of people in the last film, the residents of Haddonfield don't seem concerned that his body was never found. No one moves away and no one seems to let this fact impair their enjoyment of the holiday. The parents even let their kids trick or treat on Halloween with no adult supervision. Worst. Parents. Ever.3.) Why does everyone have a Halloween costume that's way more elaborate than anything you're ever likely to see ever? You see a lot of that in the Halloween party sequence. Speaking of... how old are these characters? In the last film, Laurie and company were still in high school, so at best, they were seniors and probably 18, but though it's only 2 years later, they attend a monster blowout that features lots of alcohol and rampant nudity and none of the cops seem to mind that this happens. They just all seem to hang out at the police station. Um, if cops knew there was some huge party going down that would probably be serving alcohol to minors, they would be camped outside that party all evening long busting everybody. Yet, like the parents of Haddonfield, the cops seem to have no clue. What's going on in this town?4.) How come the town strip joint is empty all night? It's not even midnight yet and there's no one there. Most strip joints are open till 2 or 3 in the morning and, even at closing time, there's still a ton of people there. Wouldn't a strip joint that advertises being the home of Michael Meyers' mom be jumping the night before Halloween? Where is everybody in this town? Why did that one guy have to take out the garbage at the strip joint? Who made that garbage? There's no one there to produce any garbage. Why does this scene exist?5.) So, Laurie survives an attack by a serial killer in the first film and is pretty screwed up because of it, but for some reason, she decorates her room with a giant poster of Charles Manson, one of the most well-known serial killers of all time? WTF?6.) The entire Meyers family has some sort of psychic link.... oooookay.... So, this only kicks in if Michael is eating a dog and Laurie is eating vegetarian pizza at the same time? Where was this in the last movie? Suddenly, the Meyers' are psychics now? If only she had cool Firestarter powers like Drew Barrymore... or maybe she could have fought Michael with her psychic ninja powers like that one chick did against Jason Voorhees in that one Friday the 13th movie... That might've been better than what I'm watching now.7.) How come Michael wears his mask sometimes, but not all the time? In the last movie, it was a big deal that Michael wore the mask because he was no longer Michael Meyers the sweet little kid and he just sort of regressed into his mask which was a way to deal with his being a killer. Now it just sort of appears and disappears at will. I guess no one wins on this because, frankly, he looked dumb with this mask on and he looked dumb without it on, so whatever.All in all, this is a pretty lackluster film that doesn't deliver a whole lot. On the plus side, it has a ton of gore for the hardcore fans and it does have one scene that was nicely done and created a great amount of tension: when Annie is attacked and she slowly looks up to see Michael standing off to the side, the film then jumps to slow-motion and Zombie finally delivers the sense of dread he's been trying to get for two films now. For me, this was the one standout scene of the film and it showed just a touch of the right effect at the right time in an effort to truly play off the absolute dread that should exist in that scene. Wonderfully done, but not enough to redeem the entire movie. However, I will give Rob the credit on that one - if more of the movie were like this scene, it would be much easier to recommend this film.As it stands, there's not a lot here to recommend. If you were a fan of Zombie's first film, then you'll probably carry on liking this one. If you weren't a fan of his previous film, then there's not much here that'll change your mind about Zombie as a filmmaker. Overall, I would say that this film was better than the first, but not by much. A good scene here, a really brutal gore scene there and the rest is just filler. Zombie doesn't really leave much to go on at the end of this one so it remains to be seen when and if another sequel will take place. For my money, I'd still be interested to see him just do his own riff on ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" and I think it'd be hilarious if both part 3's of both series had nothing to do with Michael Meyers, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see.Maybe Zombie did what no other person could do... maybe he effectively killed off Michael Meyers for good.",2,Zombie Continues To Deliver...

1291357,A3I2NQYN7R9Z8W,B002V3HT2G,"William Ajello ""DVDs & Beyond""","[7, 11]","Let me get this out of the way so that there is no mistaking what direction this review is going:JOHN CARPENTER'S HALLOWEEN II IS MILES...NO MAKE THAT LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF THIS REMAKE....NO QUESTION ABOUT IT!And the reason I can get away with saying this so easily is that being a collector of horror movies and having the complete set of every Michael Myers Halloween and even the one Non-Michael Myers Halloween movie ever made, I can tell you that this second Rob Zombie remake blows monkey chunks so bad, that just when I thought it was impossible to watch, a watchable part came strolling by the screen....and even THAT isn't saying too much but first, a back story to why this remake is not plausible.In the original Halloweens, Michael was an unstoppable force, a demon possessed and we all understood this and accepted it as such so naturally when he was shot at by police or whacked over the head or gutted with a knife, he could never be killed and he came back film after film after film until finally in ""Halloween ""Resurrection"", Laurie is killed and Michael is believed to be killed also and unfortunately shortly after that movie was finished, the producer of these movies, Moustapha Akkad, was killed in a suicide bombing and for all intents and purposes, that was the end of the original Michael Myers Halloween Movies because Moustapha said that the only way he would stop making them was if he were dead.The reason why Carpenter was able to get away with bringing Michael back was because of the possession story I explained earlier that Michael was cast in.....****SPOILER ALERT****IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST ROB ZOMBIE HALLOWEEN MOVIE, STOP HERE!****SPOILER ALERT****In Zombie's first Halloween movie, no such demonic possession existed, Michael was portrayed as a child who grew up in a really twisted and dysfunctional household and who himself was bullied at school and one day just snapped and went ballistic on the bully at school and killed him, and killed his scumbag father and was incarcerated and then his twisted mother who was a stripper (more on this later) blows her brains out and then he grows up to be this huge M****RF****R who breaks out of Smiths Grove (just like in the first movie), returns to Haddonfield and starts killing people, now this is all well and good until the end of the movie when Laurie, his sister, shoots him in the head and kills him.Now, I don't know if you're following me here but if you're not a person possessed by a demonic soul, when you get shot in the head by a gun the size of the one Laurie used at the range she was at?, YOU'RE DEAD!.....This is the first reason why this movie is so stupid...Yeah Yeah, I know it's Hollywood and they can do things like that, I get that but if you're going to make a sequel to a movie like this, at least make it look half way plausible so you're not insulting the audiences intelligence.I thought the first Rob Zombie film was the better of the two, far better, way better, I'm glad I just rented this film because it's a piece of crap, I don't know why he bother schmutzing it up with his wife in it through out the movie playing a ghost, I mean seriously, the scenes with her could have been substituted with some kill scenes instead because this movie was sadly lacking a body count.....there were more bodies in the Original Halloween II (the music was better also).There are GOOD things about this movie if you can believe it, Brad Dourif was terrific as Sheriff Brackett, Malcom McDowell, with all due respect to his acting ability was okay as Dr. Loomis but could never replace the late great Donald Pleasance. I really thought Danielle Harris was great in these Zombie flicks, she played the part of Annie very well. Newcomers who do NOT know who Danielle Harris is, she played Laurie Strode's daughter in Halloween IV: The return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The revenge of Michael Myers but for some reason was quickly removed from the cast in any future movies after that until these two remakes.If you must see this movie, RENT IT, DO NOT BUY IT, Trust me, YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DO, I believe in series continuity just like the next guy and I feel like I need to get every movie in a series but if I don't like a sequel, I DON'T BUY IT...........PERIOD and I didn't like this one AT ALL, Stay away from it!",1,Michael should've stayed dead after the first movie!,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,4335,"['Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'mistaking', 'what', 'direction', 'review', 'going', 'JOHN', 'CARPENTER',

1291358,AAOWC8GXIHKGM,B002V3HT2G,winehound89,"[2, 3]","Where Zombie's HALLOWEEN was a true re-imagining of a horror classic, HALLOWEEN II is a very original chapter in the Michael Myers' legacy.Picking up exactly where the first one left off, we see Laurie Strode walking along the road after shooting Michael Myers in the face. She is soon picked up by the sheriff and taken to the hospital. After a short incident with the morgue truck carrying Michael's body hitting a cow, Michael comes alive and begins his journey to finish what he started. Two years pass by but the nightmare remains for Laurie who is now on medication and seeing a therapist to deal with her night terrors and feelings about that fateful Halloween night. Rob Zombie presents to us a very disturbed and broken Laurie, a much different character than we've seen before. Her cheeriness and vibrancy for life has almost vanished and what remains is a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Now living with her friend Annie and her sheriff father, Laurie tries to get back into normality but any hope of that soon comes crashing down when she reads Dr. Loomis' new book revealing her bloodline to the Myers' family. And of course Michael's re-return to town.I think Rob Zombie has created something to be very proud of. Besides the initial beginning and the fact that it's called HALLOWEEN II, I wouldn't exactly consider this film a remake of the original sequel. Instead this newest instalment to the franchise is a fresh look at the aftermath of Michael Myers' horrific murder spree. The film includes quite a lot of realism with the inclusion of the scars left on Laurie and Annie's bodies as well as Sam Loomis' decent into a media hungry ego maniac who cares more for the fame than the misfortune. I consider this film to be the stronger of the two and admire Rob for making this his own and not just another remake.",4,Michael returns..

You had no ""heroes"" or ""Heroine"" to fight back and stop the killer like most slasher flicks. Instead you have Michael aimlessly wondering around and butchering random people, even in dream sequences.This movie takes itself TOO seriously and is a little too deep for a slasher flick.It bounced around and made the mistake the previous sequels made by having useless character(ghost mom/ ghost younger Michael) constantly show up.What made the first two(originals) successful was the suspenseful build up and climactic battles in the end.This jumped all over the place, too many random scenes and no one to cheer on to fight Michael.I didn't have much faith in this one.My personal thoughts are that Michael truly died in the first ""Halloween II"" which is a MUCH more superior slasher than this garbage.Rob Zombie needs to go back to making music videos.
