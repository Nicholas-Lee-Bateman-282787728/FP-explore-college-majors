16881,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0767822617,,"[0, 3]","This film, starring Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, helped propel Redford to superstardom. While Barbra Streisand was already a superstar, with the release of both The Sting and The Way We Were in 1973, Robert Redford's future in the film industry was assured.In this film, revolving around the class of 1937, Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) is a strident, political activist who is way to the left. Working her way through college, Katie is not the most popular figure on campus, but rather, the butt of jokes, often at her expense. She is a young, working class, Jewish woman with an edge and a bit of a chip on her shoulder. Humorless and dour, with her wild fro of hair, she is an individualist who is dedicated to causes that she feels will make the world a better place. She does not hesitate to speak her mind. This stance often finds her on the outside looking in. Barbra Streisand is really just playing the same role that she played in all her early films with an added passion that resonates throughout the film. At times, however, I found her performance grating.Hubbell Gardner (Robert Redford), on the other hand, is the quintessential Wasp, living the American dream. Blessed with All-American, golden boy good looks, charm, and grace, burnished by privilege, Hubbell is a poster boy for the old guard. He is a living icon for Wasp values. He is more than the sum of his parts, however, as he is also an aspiring writer with a way with words. While Katie, undeniably, has a crush on him, she despises his world. Hubbell, ever the gentleman, sees a spark in Katie that somehow draws him to her. Yet, while in college they are never more than passing acquaintances.Years later, they meet up again. This time, Katie has since improved her appearance, and Hubbell has written his first book. Katie is still sweet on Hubbell, and her energy, intensity, and zest for life attract him. The title song of this film adds to its bittersweet quality and went on to win an Academy Award in 1973 for Best Song.""

The movie basically explores the cliche &quot;opposites attract&quot; as Golden Boy Hubble (Redford) and Communist Sympathizer Katie (Streisand) fall deeply in love and marry. But can their passion survive their differences? Ah, that's the story... The movie takes place in the 40's and 50's with beautiful sets and wonderful costumes.If you have never seen The Way We Were and you enjoy romance, melodrama, and/or historical drama, then you should buy or rent it. (The weepiness may make this a tough sell for some men and women who dislike this genre.) If you have seen The Way We Were, then you should still rent or buy the DVD. The extra features are outstanding. Sydney Pollack's (the director) commentary is insightful and informative. He talks about everything from camera angles to Redford's hesitance about doing the part.

16884,A2DS532SLTFWFK,0767822617,Det. Abilene,"[122, 128]","As stated many times before, THE WAY WE WERE is one of only a handful of romantic blockbusters to actually feature an intelligent script and complex characters.  Writer Arthur Luarents' based his screenplay (and subsequent novel) on girl he knew in college, who fought for liberal (and sometimes communist) causes.  Three decades after it's release, THE WAY WE WERE remains one of the few cinematic depictions of the Red Scare that swept America in the forties and fifties; the backdrop of which lends the surrounding love story greater potency and depth.  The film was a surprise box office smash when originally released, and became the fifth-highest grossing film of 1973 and was instantly embraced as a classic.Katie Morosky is a character that Barbra Streisand born play, and she delivers on all accounts.  Fierce and determined, yet vulnerable and self-conscious, Katie is a tricky character and Streisand inhabits her so deeply that she seems nothing less than completely believable.  Justifiably nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, she inexplicably lost to Glenda Jackson's shrill performance in the barely remembered A TOUCH OF CLASS.  This was clearly a major blunder on the side of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Robert Redford, who had actually turned down the role twice before director and friend Sydney Pollack talked him into taking the part, displays some of the best reflective acting ever seen on the big screen and effectively brings forth the dark side of being stereotyped as the All-American golden boy (although Redford did not receive an Oscar nod for playing Hubbell in this film, he was nominated for Best Actor that same year for his light comedic performance in THE STING).THE WAY WE WERE is different from most romances in that it is not death, feuding families, or any other societal phenomena that directly tear the couple apart.  Katie and Hubbell are simply passionate individuals with highly volatile, and contrasting, ideologies; the conflict of which is expressed in several brilliantly written and acted scenes that shimmer with the type of intelligence and honesty that is rarely seen in cinema today.  The film's enduring popular success with the mass audience may very well be due to the magnetic chemistry between Streisand and Redford, the gorgeous cinematography, and the strong directorial hand supplied by Pollack.  However, it is the complexity of the romance with politics and the strong characterizations by both leads that continues to make THE WAY WE WERE the best love story for adults.About the DVD:  The picture quality is very good, quite possibly the best the film has ever looked.  You must remember that movie has always had a stylistically hazy look.  The sound quality is also vastly improved.  Pollack's commentary track is interesting, but the 60-minute documentary is the best extra on the disc.  Featuring insightful interviews from Pollack, Streisand, and Laurents (as well as composer Marvin Hamlisch and lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman) the documentary is well-produced and entertaining, and it was great to finally see those much-debated deleted scenes.",5,"""Katie, it was never uncomplicated""",1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,3143,"['stated', 'many', 'times', 'WAY', 'WE', 'WERE', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'romantic', 'blockbusters', 'actually', 'feature', 'intelligent', 'script', 'complex', 'characters', 'Writer', 'Arthur', 'Luarents', 'based', 'screenplay', 'subsequent', 'novel', 'girl', 'knew', 'college', 'who', 'fought', 'liberal', 'sometimes', 'communist', 'causes', 'Three', 'decades', 'release', 'WAY', 'WE', 'WERE', 'one', 'few', 'cinematic', 'depictions', 'Red', 'Scare', 'swept', 'America', 'forties', 'fifties', 'backdrop', 'surrounding', 'love', 'story', 'greater', 'potency', 'depth', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'box', 'office', 'smash', 'when', 'originally', 'released', 'became', 'fifth-highest', 'grossing', 'film', '1973', 'was', 'instantly', 'embraced', 'classic.Katie', 'Morosky', 'character', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'born', 'play', 'delivers', 'accounts', 'Fierce', 'determined', 'vulnerable', 'self-conscious', 'Katie', 'tricky', 'character', 'Streisand', 'so', 'deeply', 'nothing', 'less', 'completely', 'believable', 'Justifiably', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'inexplicably', 'lost', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'shrill', 'performance', 'barely', 'remembered', 'A', 'TOUCH', 'OF', 'CLASS', 'was', 'clearly', 'major', 'blunder', 'side', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'had', 'actually', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'twice', 'before', 'director', 'friend', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'talked', 'taking', 'part', 'best', 'reflective', 'acting', 'ever', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'effectively', 'forth', 'dark', 'side', 'being', 'stereotyped', 'All-American', 'golden', 'boy', 'Redford', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'playing', 'Hubbell', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'same', 'year', 'light', 'comedic', 'performance', 'THE', 'STING', 'WAY', 'WE', 'WERE', 'different', 'most', 'romances', 'not', 'death', 'feuding', 'families', 'other', 'societal', 'phenomena', 'directly', 'tear', 'couple', 'apart', 'Katie', 'Hubbell', 'are', 'simply', 'passionate', 'individuals', 'highly', 'volatile', 'contrasting', 'ideologies', 'conflict', 'expressed', 'several', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'acted', 'scenes', 'shimmer', 'type', 'intelligence', 'honesty', 'rarely', 'seen', 'cinema', 'today', 'film', 'enduring', 'popular', 'success', 'mass', 'audience', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'due', 'magnetic', 'chemistry', 'Streisand', 'Redford', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'strong', 'directorial', 'hand', 'supplied', 'Pollack', 'However', 'complexity', 'romance', 'politics', 'strong', 'characterizations', 'leads', 'make', 'WAY', 'WE', 'WERE', 'best', 'love', 'story', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'looked', 'must', 'remember', 'movie', 'always', 'had', 'stylistically', 'hazy', 'look', 'sound', 'quality', 'also', 'vastly', 'improved', 'Pollack', 'commentary', 'track', 'interesting', '60-minute', 'documentary', 'best', 'extra', 'disc', 'Featuring', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'Pollack', 'Streisand', 'Laurents', 'as', 'well', 'composer', 'Marvin', 'Hamlisch', 'Alan', 'Marilyn', 'Bergman', 'documentary', 'well-produced', 'entertaining', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'much-debated', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A
16885,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0767822617,Ed Uyeshima,"[12, 13]","When Carrie and the girls waxed enthusiastically about ""The Way We Were"" in an episode of HBO's ""Sex in the City"", I realized what a touchstone this movie has become for many who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Over thirty years have elapsed since its initial release, and it's easy to forget what a massive challenge director Sydney Pollack had in making this movie. Primarily he had to harness the elephantine personality of Barbra Streisand, then the most powerful female movie star, within a period movie that was designed to provide an incisive look at the McCarthy-era witch hunts. Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances, still her best onscreen work. She was also lucky to have veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents write such a strong, multi-dimensional character in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling.In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. I particularly like the intimate caf&eacute; scene where Hubbell announces to Katie that his article has just been published and later on when she cajoles him to stay for dinner and rattles on in typical Streisand rat-a-tat fashion about how she spent all her ration stamps on steaks and baked potatoes. Her look of realized humiliation afterward is priceless. She also handles her showcase scenes well, for instance, at the radio station when Hubbell concedes that the relationship is impossible to continue and later when Katie begs Hubbell to come over to help her sleep. I realize I was being manipulated by only-in-Hollywood, Oscar-baiting gesticulations, but the scenes somehow work regardless.When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles. But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, ""The Way We Were: A Look Back"". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures.Despite its narrative disconnect in the last third, I still love this movie, and it does deserve its place among the great screen romances. The evocative music along with the overplayed title tune certainly adds to its impact. It's just that it doesn't belong in a sub-category of films that deal seriously with the Communist red scare. The DVD transfer is good though not exceptional, and for diehard fans of the movie, the well done documentary seems essential.",4,"Streisand, Redford, Pollack Soar...Blacklisting Falls Short",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,4466,"['When', 'Carrie', 'girls', 'waxed', 'enthusiastically', 'Way', 'Were', 'episode', 'HBO', 'Sex', 'City', 'realized', 'what', 'touchstone', 'movie', 'become', 'many', 'who', 'saw', 'ultimate', 'opposites-attract', 'romance', 'thirty', 'years', 'have', 'elapsed', 'initial', 'release', 'easy', 'forget', 'what', 'massive', 'challenge', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'had', 'making', 'movie', 'Primarily', 'had', 'harness', 'elephantine', 'personality', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'then', 'most', 'powerful', 'female', 'movie', 'star', 'period', 'movie', 'was', 'designed', 'provide', 'incisive', 'look', 'McCarthy-era', 'witch', 'hunts', 'Pollack', 'exceptional', 'job', 'delineating', 'somewhat', 'preposterous', 'love', 'story', 'Streisand', 'one', 'most', 'subtle', 'touching', 'performances', 'still', 'best', 'onscreen', 'work', 'was', 'also', 'lucky', 'have', 'veteran', 'screenwriter', 'Arthur', 'Laurents', 'write', 'such', 'strong', 'multi-dimensional', 'character', 'Katie', 'Morosky', 'quite', 'journey', 'young', 'Communist', 'college', 'radical', 'late', 'thirties', 'glamorous', 'Hollywood', 'wife', 'early', 'fifties', 'Streisand', 'fully', 'committed', 'conveying', 'character', 'idealism', 'blind', 'idolatry', 'Matching', 'step', 'way', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'peak', 'matinee', 'idol', 'popularity', 'as', 'well', 'smartly', 'lionized', 'Hubbell', 'Gardiner', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'remained', 'cipher', 'instead', 'understand', 'own', 'limitations', 'interesting', 'how', 'other', 'characters', 'fade', 'completely', 'background', 'result', 'mega-wattage', 'generated', 'star', 'coupling.In', 'essence', 'movie', 'three', 'distinct', 'parts', 'college', 'years', 'when', 'first', 'make', 'impressions', 'other', 'WWII', 'years', 'when', 'meet', 'again', 'start', 'unlikely', 'romance', 'Hollywood', 'years', 'when', 'are', 'married', 'get', 'mired', 'studio', 'system', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'are', 'excellent', 'filled', 'memorable', 'moments', 'particularly', 'intimate', 'caf', 'eacute', 'scene', 'where', 'Hubbell', 'Katie', 'article', 'just', 'been', 'published', 'later', 'when', 'stay', 'dinner', 'rattles', 'typical', 'Streisand', 'rat-a-tat', 'fashion', 'how', 'spent', 'ration', 'stamps', 'steaks', 'baked', 'potatoes', 'look', 'realized', 'humiliation', 'afterward', 'priceless', 'also', 'showcase', 'scenes', 'well', 'instance', 'radio', 'station', 'when', 'Hubbell', 'relationship', 'impossible', 'continue', 'later', 'when', 'Katie', 'Hubbell', 'come', 'help', 'sleep', 'realize', 'was', 'being', 'manipulated', 'only-in-Hollywood', 'Oscar-baiting', 'gesticulations', 'scenes', 'somehow', 'work', 'regardless.When', 'story', 'moves', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'problematic', 'star-crossed', 'couple', 'challenged', 'revelation', 'Hubbell', 'studio', 'Katie', 'was', 'former', 'Communist', 'turn', 'Hubbell', 'now', 'rising', 'screenwriter', 'target', 'blacklisting', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'muddled', 'what', 'exactly', 'happening', 'cause', 'inevitable', 'break-up', 'Ironically', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'section', 'train', 'station', 'confrontation', 'Katie', 'Hubbell', 'people', 'principles', 'bottom', 'line', 'narrative', 'connection', 'Hollywood', 'blacklist', 'separation', 'just', 'odd', 'given', 'build-up', 'story', 'point', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'reinstating', 'several', 'crucial', 'scenes', 'cut', 'last', 'minute', 'Pollack', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'seeing', 'extensive', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'included', 'part', 'DVD', 'package', 'Way', 'Were', 'Look', 'Back', 'have', 'agree', 'Pollack', 'disagree', 'Streisand', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'pacing', 'emotionalism', 'part', 'movie', 'even', 'do', 'provide', 'added', 'context', 'course', 'coda', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'still', 'classic', 'mainly', 'due', 'brevity', 'dialogue', 'swooning', 'Marvin', 'Hamlisch', 'music', 'tear-jerking', 'stares', 'gestures.Despite', 'narrative', 'disconnect', 'last', 'third', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'deserve', 'place', 'great', 'screen', 'romances', 'evocative', 'music', 'overplayed', 'title', 'tune', 'certainly', 'impact', 'just', ""n't"", 'belong', 'sub-category', 'films', 'deal', 'seriously', 'Communist', 'red', 'scare', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'good', 'not', 'exceptional', 'diehard', 'fans', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'essential']",N/A

Whatever she believes in, she believes in it deeply and fights for it.  She will not hold back in speaking her mind.  Redford plays the All-American boy.  He believes in having fun and is a bit of a cynic in his beliefs about the individual being able to change the big picture.  Regardless of their differences, the two fall in love in New York, but will fight for their particular ideologies.The love story between the two is well done.  The audience sees that they care for each other, but that their differences will never let them find true happiness.The view of Americana starts from their college days before WWII and carries until well after the war.

16887,A2F8R40Z2OMIJM,0767822617,"Matt Howe ""outloud98""","[12, 13]","The packaging on this DVD is exquisite -- there's a nice gold-toned fold-out chapter index on the inside cover.  Columbia has really packaged it like a keepsake.The menus are classy as well.  The behind-the-scenes  featurette is very interesting.  Barbra Streisand is very humble and exact  about her memories of making the movie.  She is also very generous in her  praise of Redford.  Sydney Pollack gives some good insights into the film.  And author Arthur Laurents is especially revealing.  I think all involved  with the film knew they were creating something special. And yet the  featurette proves that even a classic romance needs snipping. The cut  scenes are interesting but prove that some scenes are superfluous to the  arc of the story.  However, the big scene in which Katie is told that an  old schoolmate has informed on her is VERY interesting:  Do the WASP and  the Jew split up because of politics or stay together and be blacklisted ?  It would have been a very different story if this scene were  used.Otherwise, the DVD looks gorgeous.  It is so good to see this film  in widescreen.  I have only seen pan-and-scan versions for years.  It is  great to see the opening credits (underscored with Barbra's beautiful  voice) framed the way they're supposed to be.  I had an old VHS version  that flip-flopped back and forth in order to get it all on the screen --  very annoying.Finally, the Marvin Hamlisch section of the documentary is  very interesting as well.

Hubbell was a golden boy to which everything came easy and he always took the easy road.  Katie had to work at everything and therefore, she took the hard road looking for every cause to fight for.  Katie and Hubbell had one class together creative writing.  Katie wanted to be a journalist and she prized this class but is devastated when it's Hubbell's story that the professor praises.  What is worse is the story is good.Both graduate and go their separate ways.  Katie becomes a writer for a radio show and Hubbell enlists in the Navy.  One night Katie is at a nightclub with her boss and who is there (asleep on a barstool), Hubbell.  Katie takes him home and thus begins their relationship.  But as they had different backgrounds neither is quite sure what that relationship is.  Despite their differences they get married. Hubbell's book is optioned by a studio and they are off to Hollywood.Everything is going fine.  They know what lines not to cross and stay away from them.  That is until communism hearing become a little too real.  Katie comes to the rally of the Hollywood victims of the hearing but Hubbell wants to stay clear.  This starts the end of their marriage.  They know that they love each other but cannot be with each other and end it amicably.Years later they meet.  Both have remarried but their reunion tells you that each is the other's true love.This is considered to be one of the great romances of all time.  I definitely agree with this!  Streisand is the perfect choice for Katie (the character in the book was inspired by her) and Redford is the perfect choice for Hubbell.  They exuded a chemistry that neither has equaled in future films.This film is well made from every aspect.  The cinematography adds feeling to the scenes.  The art direction and costumes evoke the eras involved.  And Marvin Hamlisch's Oscar winning score is perfection.If you ever had someone that you loved but lost, this is the perfect film.  Plus according to every TV show.  This is the movie you must watch after a breakup!DVD EXTRAS:  Making of Documentary - Looking Back: A one hour documentary on the making of the film with Streisand, writer Arthur Laurents, director Sydney Pollack",5,A Great Romance,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,2317,"['Katie', 'Morosky', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Hubbell', 'Gardner', 'are', 'students', 'Cornell', 'similarities', 'end', 'Hubbell', 'was', 'golden', 'boy', 'everything', 'came', 'easy', 'always', 'took', 'easy', 'road', 'Katie', 'had', 'work', 'everything', 'therefore', 'took', 'hard', 'road', 'looking', 'cause', 'fight', 'Katie', 'Hubbell', 'had', 'one', 'class', 'together', 'creative', 'writing', 'Katie', 'wanted', 'be', 'journalist', 'prized', 'class', 'devastated', 'when', 'Hubbell', 'story', 'professor', 'What', 'worse', 'story', 'good.Both', 'graduate', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Katie', 'writer', 'radio', 'show', 'Hubbell', 'enlists', 'Navy', 'One', 'night', 'Katie', 'nightclub', 'boss', 'who', 'there', 'asleep', 'barstool', 'Hubbell', 'Katie', 'home', 'thus', 'relationship', 'had', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'relationship', 'differences', 'get', 'married', 'Hubbell', 'book', 'optioned', 'studio', 'are', 'Hollywood.Everything', 'going', 'fine', 'know', 'what', 'lines', 'not', 'cross', 'stay', 'away', 'communism', 'hearing', 'become', 'little', 'too', 'real', 'Katie', 'rally', 'Hollywood', 'victims', 'hearing', 'Hubbell', 'stay', 'clear', 'end', 'marriage', 'know', 'love', 'other', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'other', 'end', 'later', 'meet', 'have', 'remarried', 'reunion', 'tells', 'other', 'true', 'love.This', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'romances', 'time', 'definitely', 'agree', 'Streisand', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Katie', 'character', 'book', 'was', 'inspired', 'Redford', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Hubbell', 'exuded', 'chemistry', 'equaled', 'future', 'films.This', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'aspect', 'cinematography', 'feeling', 'scenes', 'art', 'direction', 'costumes', 'evoke', 'eras', 'involved', 'Marvin', 'Hamlisch', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'score', 'ever', 'had', 'someone', 'loved', 'lost', 'perfect', 'film', 'according', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'must', 'watch', 'breakup', 'DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Making', 'Documentary', 'Looking', 'Back', 'one', 'hour', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'Streisand', 'writer', 'Arthur', 'Laurents', 'director', 'Sydney', 'Pollack']",N/A
