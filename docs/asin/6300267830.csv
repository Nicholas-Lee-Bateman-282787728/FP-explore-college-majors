But he really didn't have 40 pounds of fecal matter in him at his death as far as anyone knows because they never did an autopsy. That was a false internet rumor, probably started by sellers of ""colonic irrigation products"", vegetarians and that want to call attention to the unhealthy American meat-based diet. Heh, can't believe everything ya here. John Wayne did die of cancer, but I'm affraid he was indeed full of it, just in other ways. This film THE GREEN BERETS is impacted with enough nonsense to be harmful to the society that consumes too much material of this kind. The movie is well known for containg many technical errors including depiction of a sunset that takes place in the east. I wonder how many Americans would to this day know and or even notice that the country of Vietnam has no western coastline? How many would care is perhaps even more important a question. Technical errors aside the meassage of the film is completely false: the Vietnam War was was not faught to save little Vietnamese children and the Vietnamese people. It killed countless thousands of them.

Only a few bravemen opposed them and one of the bravest was John Wayne.John Wayne was a real american.  He was what every man wantedto be and what every woman wanted.  He loved his country andhated its enemies.  Thats why he made this film.He made this film because America had to be shown what thewar on communism was about.  It was about saving lives onthe frontlines and the frontiers of freedom.  And aboutsupporting our troops who were fighting for our freedom.The best character in the film is little Ham Chuck who learnsall the lessons of freedom from his green beret friends includingthe price of freedom in lives of those who are fighting for it.You could see that little fellow after an american victoryleading vietnam on the road to development and into the familyof free nations.  But we all know that because we sold himout, he either fortunately ended up in a refugee camp or heended up being put in a tiger cage for the rest of his lifeif he wasn't lucky.  He had learned too much of freedom andof the american way to ever be allowed to run loose in acommunist country.Wayne knew that the Vietnam war above everything else wasabout human decency.  We all know that millions were murderedby communists after we sold out the side of freedom.  Wayneknew that would happen even years earlier and tried to tellthe world what was going on with this film.Vietnam was a war worth fighting and worth winning.  The mistakeswe made was in fighting with one arm tied behind our back, notgiving the troops what they needed to win, and trying to fighta war by obsolete rules.  We also made the mistake of settinggoals and timetables.

I have been a fan of his and his work since I was a little dude. As an adult I continue to collect his work and enjoy them over and over. I spent 30 years in the Army which started in 1968 and his character and the plot of the movie is very believable and true to the real life war in Vietnam. The rhetoric, clothing, operations and missions and all else about the movie are within acceptable tolerances for this story. The booby traps, the visciousness of the Viet Cong against their own people and the missions are true to life. This movie will be represents actual places, people and events in our military history that should help Americans honor the fewer and fewer Vietnam veterans in our great nation who fought a war that wasn't fought to be won (in my own opinion). A lot of them weren't honored when they came home, they were branded as ""baby killers"" and the like which caused untold mental agony and distress. God bless 'em (us).As a side note, his westerns are entertaining and action filled. One of the reasons I enjoy them so much is the screen writer he used for so many years, especially his westerns, James Edward Grant. He is the one who put the Duke's famous phrases onto the screen; phrases like, ""a man's got to do what a man's got to do"", and ""Comfortable?!?! I've been called a lot of things in my life, but comfortable was not one of them."" The legend lives on in his movies, as does each of the actors that worked with him for all those decades.

231241,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6300267830,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 3]","I feel kind of guilty for liking this movie. Sure, I'm a John Wayne fan, and a David Janssen, Jack Soo and George Takei fan. And I generally like stories about heroes, even war stories if they're not just ""war is hell"" stories. But this one has several disturbing aspects, not the least of which was having been warned away from it when it was in the theaters.John Wayne plays Colonel Tough-As-Nails, his usual role. David Janssen is the skeptical newspaper reporter who goads the Colonel into taking him along to the combat zone by asking if he's afraid he'll see things he shouldn't see out there. What is sees, among other things, is the incredible brutality of the Viet Cong.OK, so far so good. But there's also the problem of being able to tell your friends from your enemies, especially when they discover that the VC unaccountably know what they are doing all the time.There's a little orphan boy who is made the mascot of the base, and sleeps in the bunk with his favorite soldier -- sure couldn't do that in a film today.Also, there's the necessity of stealing supplies from other bases when they need something. Wayne brought along a sergeant who is expert at that for the purpose.But the most disturbing part of all is an undercover operation, in both senses of the word. Jack Soo plays a Vietnamese colonel who works with Wayne. His sister-in-law is a beautiful singer in Danang. She knows one of the top North Vietnamese generals, who has been trying to get her into bed for a long time. So she agrees to go with him to his country home, setting a trap for him with the Green Berets. Of course she is putting herself in terrible danger in the process. Somehow, the whole operation seems a bit unsporting, you know? Particularly since all the North Vietnamese soldiers who were doing guard duty for the general's love nest are killed. I know, worse things than that can be justified in a war, but it just seemed cold, especially when Soo points out that she will be disgraced when the story gets out.Oh, yes; and the little boy's favorite soldier just had to be killed. The script utterly required it. Otherwise, he'd have to take the kid home and adopt him.",3,My Peacenik Friends Would Disown Me for This,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2170,"['feel', 'kind', 'guilty', 'liking', 'movie', 'Sure', ""'m"", 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'David', 'Janssen', 'Jack', 'Soo', 'George', 'Takei', 'fan', 'generally', 'stories', 'heroes', 'even', 'war', 'stories', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'war', 'hell', 'stories', 'one', 'several', 'disturbing', 'aspects', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'having', 'been', 'warned', 'away', 'when', 'was', 'theaters.John', 'Wayne', 'Colonel', 'Tough-As-Nails', 'usual', 'role', 'David', 'Janssen', 'skeptical', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'Colonel', 'taking', 'along', 'combat', 'zone', 'asking', 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'see', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'out', 'there', 'What', 'sees', 'other', 'things', 'incredible', 'brutality', 'Viet', 'Cong.OK', 'so', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'also', 'problem', 'being', 'able', 'tell', 'friends', 'enemies', 'especially', 'when', 'discover', 'VC', 'unaccountably', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'little', 'orphan', 'boy', 'who', 'made', 'mascot', 'base', 'sleeps', 'bunk', 'favorite', 'soldier', 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'today.Also', 'necessity', 'stealing', 'supplies', 'other', 'bases', 'when', 'need', 'something', 'Wayne', 'brought', 'along', 'sergeant', 'who', 'expert', 'purpose.But', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'undercover', 'operation', 'senses', 'word', 'Jack', 'Soo', 'Vietnamese', 'colonel', 'who', 'Wayne', 'sister-in-law', 'beautiful', 'singer', 'Danang', 'one', 'top', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'generals', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'bed', 'long', 'time', 'go', 'country', 'home', 'setting', 'trap', 'Green', 'Berets', 'course', 'putting', 'terrible', 'danger', 'process', 'Somehow', 'whole', 'operation', 'bit', 'unsporting', 'know', 'Particularly', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'doing', 'guard', 'duty', 'general', 'love', 'nest', 'are', 'killed', 'know', 'worse', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'justified', 'war', 'just', 'seemed', 'cold', 'especially', 'when', 'Soo', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'disgraced', 'when', 'story', 'out.Oh', 'yes', 'little', 'boy', 'favorite', 'soldier', 'just', 'had', 'be', 'killed', 'script', 'utterly', 'required', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'have', 'take', 'kid', 'home', 'adopt']",The Green Berets VHS

(Except Mel Gibson) This movie is different in that you do get a different perspective of that war, which is rarely shown from Hollywood these days. I wish we could go back to the days when Hollywood supported the military, the way this movie does. The thing that bothers me most about the Vietnam war is that we could have won it. North Vietnamese Generals have admitted as such, in documentaries. But widespread treason was committed by our left-wing media, and the leftist Hollywood types. Which I believe helped turn some Americans against the war. So we ended up losing the PR war.A lot of good people died in Vietnam.

The only thing I can say about any reality is that I was not in or near any green berated people. I was in armed reconnaissance and as you suspected the environment was totally different. We never went anywhere without an M-60 which was not present in the movie. I was the RTO carried a radio and extra ammunition for the M-60. People that watched out for me at night carried an M-79. For that matter they did not even have a P-38 on their tag chain. The people in the tiger suits were the LRRP's. Once in a while I got to go out with them. I could fill a book with the inconsistencies.Now putting the differences aside for this movie, it appears consistent with the larger than life John Wayne legend style.

portray us as the ones wearing the white hats and""the enemy"" being little more than stereotypical villians.Wayne's hypocritical politics were allowed full reign in this awful one-sided piece of garbage,and reality be damned.No doubt LBJ and the rest of the warhawks drooled over the idea that anti-war journalists could so easily be persuaded to ditch both objectivity and commonsense in real life as Jahnsen's character did in the film but it just did not happen.Likewise I have little doubt that the administration(which wasted taxpayer money by the bagfull giving Wayne and his film army support and manpower)wanted the military to appear to fully support the war effort.Again this was not the case.Most of those in the military then were drafted,forced to choose between going to fight a war few of them supported or facing the draconian penalties the government held over their heads.As for the morale of our troops in Viet Nam it was low to rock-bottom,and not because of protests at home either but,rather because few of the drafted troops believed in the war or felt they were in any way making""the world safe for democracy""I know because I was there.Even the RA types(regular army volunteer enlisted)had their doubts.Add to all of this the fact that most of those drafted were poor,or were not going on to college(which required money)had none of the ""exemptions""available to others,thus making the war one that for the most part allowed those who had the ability to avoid service to do so while allowing those who did not have the ability to be drafted and,too often,to die in a needless unnecessary war.The film was produced by Michael Wayne,and co-starred Patrick Wayne,both John Wayne's sons.Like John Wayne himself who chose to dodge military service during WW2(while many other film stars volunteered)these two played make believe while other people's children,both volunteers and draftees died in reality.Overall everything about this film disgusts me.POST SCRIPT...As of this writing there are two""comments""One is from someone offended by my review.Hey!I don't think that it is worthwhile to write a review if I have to tiptoe around making sure that I don't""offend""people who like the film being reviewed.That said I have no problem with people who disagree with my opinion.The freedom to do this is what America is supposed to be all about,isn't it?I DO however find myself offended at being questioned about the truthfulness of my own participation in that unnecessay warThis same comment links my negative review to the REALITIES of my own wartime experiences in Viet Nam,the commentator stating in this context that because I reviewed the film in the way that I did my claim of active duty and participation should therefore be questioned.So it is like this;I was drafted,which means that YES,I did NOT raise my hand and volunteer.Neither did I flee to Canada,or claim some exemption.I did my duty.While some may well take pride in serving the nation no matter what,and brushing aside  moral or ethical questions involved in such service I am not one of them.This same comment called the debacle of Viet Nam a""noble cause""which brings up the second comment.That individual took issue with my implication that Viet Nam was a ""right wing""conspiracy of sorts.It may or may not have been that but it was a disaster even if it had no right wing political elements.This second comment did however chide the first commentator on that""noble cause'thing,asking for an explaination as to how it was that.To date no expaination as to the reasons why Viet Nam was a"" noble cause""Have been forthcoming.My guess is that except for personal opinion there are no reasonable explainations as to why Viet Name was in any way,shape,or form

At 141 minutes, it could have been a lot better cut to two hours or even less.There is an interesting lecture to the press by the military early on and that's worth listening to, whether you agree with it or not. John Wayne played his normal tough-on-the-outside-but very human-on-the-inside role, which he so often did in his westerns. This movie also was made right when the Hays Code had been abolished but they still refrained from profanity, to their credit, although it certainly would have been understandable being a war flick.There were a number of lulls in here to show the soldiers being more than just killing machines. There is one very touching scene with a little boy whose soldier friend does not come back alive. From a war standput, there were Viet Cong booby traps that were brutal but interesting to see.Overall, I found it an ""okay"" war movie, but nothing special.

Other then that, it is aesthetically speaking a mediocre movie.  It is definitely not Academy Award material.  Was John Wane unable to find suitable investors within the left-wing Hollywood community?  Should we assume that the movie was made on a shoe string budget?  Whatever, Wayne should not have been so involved in the production.  The screen play is mediocre and the direction is about what would expect in a made for TV movie.  The actors mouth embarrassing  cliches.  Even the music score was awful.  Am I a leftist who disagrees with Wayne's position on the war?  Nope, he and I are on the exact same page.  The United States was valiantly trying to save the Vietnamese people from the evil Communists.  Unfortunately, our troops were stabbed in the back by the leftist media and it allies.Watching ""The Green Berets"" is something of an unpleasant experience.  John Wayne obviously meant well.

John Wayne felt it was his patriotic duty to answer ""Jane Fonda"" pinko liberal anti-VN War protesters and Hanoi Jane herself, the most hated sumbag by US GIs in VN. As a veteran of many covert low intensity wars, dedicated Colonel Mike Kirby of the US Special Forces, John Wayne leads a dedicated ""A"" team of highly skilled ""Professors of Warfare"" deep behind enemy lines in VN. Based in part on Capt. Roger Donlon's heroic and harrowing defence of a Green Beret outpost that won him the 1st Congressional Medal of Honour awarded in Vietnam, John Wayne is at his patriotic best in his realistic potrayal of a veteran of many, many wars fighting his country's enemies. The footage of an AC130 gunship ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" that terminates the VC that have over run the Special Forces camp is chilling in its depiction of quick death from the sky. Fascinating too to military buffs are the techniques of sentry silencing shown including garotting, as well as the use of the STABO extraction rig used to extract the enemy NVA General for interrogation. John Wayne's parting line as the sun sets over Danang, when he puts the Green Beret over the head of the orphan Vietnamese boy ""Ham Chunk"", ""You're what this is all about, Green Beret"" brings tears to your eyes. The plight of the boat people after the fall of Saigon showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that what John Wayne said to Ham Chunk in Danang Air Base was in fact TRUE. Refugees are people who vote with their feet. If you have ever seen the booby traps exhibited in the Cu Chi Tunnels exhibit you will realise that the sometimes simple and warm Vietnamese people can turn very nasty. Just see for yourself the many different leg traps made with rusty 6 inch long nails coated with faeces used to slice up unwary ARVN and US GIs and you will see exactly what I mean. As Ken, a good friend of mine always says, ""Seeing is believing"". If you know people who were in the re-education camps after the fall of Saigon, you won't be so quick to condemn this film. The Communists sytematically starved to death thousand in the re-education camps. my frind had to eat spiders and ants to stay alive.

Pauzer,"[25, 39]","I read someone else's review about this, and it peaked my interest enough to write my own about a movie that is a misfire on many levels from the outset to the bitter end.First, there's the dialogue, which is ueber patriotic from the get-go to build support for the war. (It was released in 1968). Some of it will give you the chills of embarrassment when a South Vietnamese Army captain says: ""First, kill all stinking Cong..."" You forget the rest of what he says as you feel your face flush red and wonder why the two actors he's addressing aren't laughing their web gear off. An abundance of military colloquialisms, popular at the time seem inserted rather than natural e.g. ""bought the farm"" or ""Puff, the Magic Dragon."" Loosely translated that means you're dead and you're about to die--respectively.Next, we have the plot.One lone reporter is anti war and antagonistic to the mission of US Army Special Forces (Green Berets), and he's going to prove it by going to Vietnam and see it first hand. He attends an orientation at Ft. Benning where the scenes, especially of the airborne school, are real. It is during this part of the movie that John Wayne is trying mightily to remember his lines, and not appear like someone who should have retired twenty years earlier.Next we see Jim Hutton, an enlisted greenie beanie who is a scrounger which translates as thief, who sleeps in ""jammies,"" and has a 1941 style barracks full of collectibles that no self-respecting special forces soldier would be caught dead with.Now the rest of the characters who all go to Vietnam:They are as numerous and predictable as it is easy finding cheese in any box of C rations. Sergeant Muldoon is the tough senior NCO and weapons expert who liked to make things explode with his chemistry set as a kid. (No kidding)! There's the mild-mannered doc who inoculates entire villages. There's Jackie Soo who appears that he hasn't graduated from acting school but you secretly hope will start singing ""A Hundred Million Miracles."" Then there's Sgt. Provo, who before you can say, ""There's a snake in my boot,"" notices that names of every building in country are named after someone who was killed in action. (Gee, guess what happens to him)! Next, a cute Vietnamese boy trying to look like a puppy dog without a tail sees the Hutton character Sgt. Peterson as a father-figure. So, naturally, you know what's going to happen to Hutton.After saving Vietnamese and fighting off VC attacks, lo' and behold, the reporter played by Michael Jansen says that he's going home to write something different that his editors will not like. (Ya' don't say)! John Wayne is proud of him. And of course, there's the little Vietnamese boy who runs to each returning helicopter to see if his Sgt. Peter ""San"" has returned. John Wayne goes to talk to him.There is plenty of shoot-em up action matched by an equal number of dull moments and bad dialogue. John Wayne goes by the code name, Bulldog. That seems about right as this movie is a complete hund.Avoid this like you would a horseshoe ambush.Airborne!P.S. I would like to thank my Amazon friends, you know who you are, for all your support.

In other words, My Country Right Or Wrong.  I'll not dissuade anyone from feeling that way if he or she chooses.Nevertheless, while the Duke may have had his heart in the right place for making THE GREEN BERETS, he unfortunately let that blind patriotism and his politics get the best of him.  This attempt at stirring up patriotic support for our guys in Vietnam comes across as not merely politically and historically phony but painfully corny.  Wayne likes to think that Vietnam was like World War II--which, of course, was painfully wrong (even more so because he didn't even FIGHT in WW II).  He wants us to believe that the VC and the NVA could be picked off like ducks in a shooting gallery, when that assumption in fact didn't even come close.  And the sentimental scenes involving his dead comrades and a Vietnamese orphan resonate still today, not for how touching they were (because they're not) but because of how utterly sappy they are.Reportedly, when this film was shown to the troops in Vietnam, many of them either laughed their heads off at Wayne's well-intentioned but utter phoniness or fired their M-16s at the screen.  I've talked to several Vietnam vets who saw the film--none of them, and I do mean NONE OF THEM, thought it was accurate in the least.  Beyond its politics and its historical inaccuracies, it is cinematically phony as well, with the &quot;sunset in the East&quot; final shot being the real capper.Later films like PLATOON and FULL METAL JACKET showed a far more accurate and complex vision of our Vietnam experience as being about young men who were put in a hellhole and were not able to find any way out.

The war was never viewed as a ""good"" war by a lot of people so any film that depicts it that way will have a lot of detractors.The film has great production values and a decent, if rather far fetched story. But, as we all know, movies that are not far fetched are rarely enjoyable.The battle scenes are well done, and the good guys win, even if they take it on the chin some.There is no ambiguity about just who the good guys are in this picture.

It is a little long for my tastes, and the last half hour of it depicting the capture of an enemy general seems tacked on to me, and pretty contrived. It might have been a better movie if that part had been left out. It did show off some of the capabilities of the Green Berets as a fighting force, and its possible the military wanted that kind of thing added as the price of cooperating in the making of the picture.

Sadly, it is and incredibly disappointing, especially considering the talent involved.  John Wayne, who had done a pretty good job directing THE ALAMO seven years before and was a very underrated actor;  Winton Hoch, one of the finest cameramen of the sound era and who won Oscars for two of the most beautifully photographed films ever-SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and THE QUIET MAN;  David Janssen, Jim Hutton, Bruce Cabot, Aldo Ray, Raymond St. Jacques were no pikers in the acting department;  Batjac, Wayne's production company and run by his son Michael, had produced some very good films in the past (MCLINTOCK!, THE ALAMO).This, however, is a piece of junk-plain and simple.The script is full of howlers and cliches that were out-of-date when the film was made, the photography is second-rate, the acting is all-around amateurish and for a studio film of that period, it looks like it was thrown together more haphazardly than a Roger Corman film of the early 60's.  The classic example:  the ending shot is supposed to be on the east coast of Vietnam, with the sun setting...in the east!  I still find it hard to believe that not one person on this film noticed this gaffe-pitiful.The main reason I purchased this Blu-Ray is that I wanted to see the film anamorphically, which the latest remaster on DVD does not do.  Fortunately the price was right and I should have this film in my collection being a fan of Wayne, but how often I take it out to watch is going to be problematical.The AlamoShe Wore a Yellow RibbonMcLintock!

I thought I'd try something different and review this as a movie without providing an op-ed piece on the war itself.First off, the cast in this movie is its strong point.  John Wayne and David Janssen are the two biggest names but a lot of wonderful character actors provide the movie with a heart and soul that go well beyond what the script provides.  Wayne himself gives one of his best performances and Jim Hutton is especially memorable as Sgt. Peterson.The story first follows Wayne to a US camp set up in Viet Cong (VC) territory.  He leads an effort to prepare for an assault that they know will come.  The defense of the camp takes up roughly the first two thirds of the movie.  Then, with almost no transition, there is a covert mission to kidnap a VC general behind enemy lines.  The camp story frankly drags and could have been cut by at least 20 minutes without losing anything.  The mission to kidnap the general is really laughable.  I'm sorry to say that it's like something a 12 year old would imagine a covert operation to be.  Wayne is one of two middle-aged colonels and at least three sergeants go along... all chiefs and no Indians.  Special forces missions are run by young, fit men who are the best of the best not by men who primarily sit behind a desk.  Since the movie was already running long, it's a bit of a mystery to me why they felt this second story needed to be grafted onto the end like that.Overall, the Green Berets is not one of Wayne's better movies.  I love the cast and they alone do make it watchable, but probably not enjoyable for many.  As is also obvious from the other reviews here, there is a strong pro-war sentiment and if that offends you then this will certainly not help your enjoyment of the film.

The men in theatre called them 'snake eaters' because of their training in survival and living off the land.Other such elite groups includes, but are not limited to,  the British Royal Marine Commandos, British Special Sea Service (SAS), a couple of Israeli groups, Rangers, Paratroopers, French Foreign Legion, and last but not least by any means, our Delta Force.  The United States Marine Corps also rates high mention because of their training, courage, brilliant history, and esprit de corps.In Yokosuka, Japan, in 1950 during the Korean war, in a corridor in an administrative office, I once was faced with two very large men in great physical condition. They were friends. They were the commanding officers of Underwater Demolition Team One and the Royal Marine Commandoes.  I would not have wanted to meet them in a dark alley--particularly if I were their enemy.This movie is exclusively about the Green Berets, so designated because of the color and type of uniform headgear that they wear.  The movie also made popular the song, Ballad of the Green Berets, lyrics by Sgt. Barry Sadler.John Wayne plays the part of Colonel Mike Kirby.  The cast is filled with eminent actors, all of whom do a superb job.  The story revolves around the Berets protecting an isolated wilderness post from Viet Cong attack and the congruent villages and villagers from the brutality and cruelty of the VC.  In a subsequent mission, Kirby, with a small group, abducts a North Vietnamese general.  Like most John Wayne movies, it reflects some truth about our armed services and the requirements of service, is patriotic in nature, and leaves one feeling somewhat uplifted.  That was his intent, in everything he portrayed on the screen.This is an interesting, action filled and tense drama which achieved much critical acclaim at the time of its release.

231306,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6300267830,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 8]","When this movie was released in the 60s it received a mixed reaction from a country that was starting to rethink its policies in Southeast Asia. While the movie does capture a flavor of the situation in Viet Nam, it is unabashedly patriotic and glosses over the downsides of the situation in Vietnam. Yet, getting past the politics and the residual feelings that Vietnam has left in the minds of many, this movie is actually a fair action movie.The movie is really several stories put together. The movie follows a group of Green Berets as they are transferred to Viet Nam. The beginning of the movie explains the enemy in Viet Nam and why we were in Vietnam with the logic of the time. The logic was rooted in the kind of idealism that carried us through World War II, and was not truly applicable to the situation in Vietnam. After laying the groundwork for why we should be in Vietnam, we soon meet a Wayne movie regular, Jim Hutton playing Sgt. Peterson, or Peter-Sahn as Hamchuck (Craig Jue), a Vietnamese orphan, calls him. Soon the team is on their way to Vietnam.Once in Vietnam the group's mission is to be part of the teams establishing bases in the hills to serve as points of stability for the locals, protecting them from the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). The movie takes the opportunity to point out how evil and cruel the enemy is toward women and children, and men too, as we see innocents ruthlessly murdered. We also see a firefight where the NVA win and the somewhat stereotypical aftermath scene where the NVA remove anything and everything of value from the dead left in an overrun camp.Later the group of Green Berets go on a mission to capture a North Vietnamese general, and once again the movie takes the opportunity to point out how morally corrupt the enemy is. Along the way we see a sophisticated booby-trap kill one of the principal characters to set up the poignant ending.David Janssen plays reporter George Beckworth, who tags along with the Green Berets from the beginning to the end. He represents those with an anti-war sentiment, and the movie shows how his ""misconceptions"" of the war are overcome by the incidents he encounters. By the end of the war George has become convinced that we are doing the right thing in Vietnam, and through truth, justice and the American way we will prevail.There are several scenes in this movie that are interesting and contain a combination of accuracy and inaccuracy. The balloon extraction system that was used to remove the Vietnamese general from the jungle was also used in the James Bond movie ""Thunderball."" There was an actual system and aircraft to pick up an object on the ground, though I have always wondered what that stress would do to a human body. An even better scene was when Puff the Magic Dragon was used. Puff was an AC-47, a modified version of the C-47, the military version of the DC-3, with Gatling guns mounted on the left side of the plane. While the configuration was relatively simple, it concentrated an incredible amount of firepower in a small area. This plane was the precursor of the significantly more powerful and sophisticated AC-130 Spectre Gunship, the most recent version of which goes by the call sign ""Spooky."" The scenes of the helicopters taking off and returning from missions are also impressive, though helicopter technology has advanced significantly in the decades since this war.It is easy to pick at this movie with its distortion of the situation in Vietnam and its incredibly stereotypical characters. Add to that the gross inaccuracies, such as the sun setting into the ocean off the Vietnamese coast, which faces east, and the movie can seem like poorly veiled propaganda film. However, without considering the era and the Duke you miss the point. This movie was John Wayne's personal statement regarding Vietnam. He, and many others, felt we should be there because it was the right thing to do; that it was human decency to prevent what would, and did, happen if the North Vietnamese won. Many of us truly believed that the North Vietnamese communists were more evil than the corrupt government of the south.If you ignore the propaganda, and that this movie is about the Vietnam War, and that later movies covered the topic much better, you end up with a movie in the tradition of World War II movies where it was easy to define who the good guys and the bad guys were, and our principal motivation to be there was good versus evil and right versus wrong. This movie is a sobering end to an era for our country and in film-making. From this point forward we would realize that rarely are situations black and white and would need to be more careful in how we approached situations such as this. If this film did nothing else, perhaps it helped us to realize how complicated the world actually is.",3,Patriotic and Propagandistic,1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,4843,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '60s', 'received', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'country', 'was', 'starting', 'rethink', 'policies', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'movie', 'capture', 'flavor', 'situation', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'unabashedly', 'patriotic', 'downsides', 'situation', 'Vietnam', 'getting', 'politics', 'residual', 'feelings', 'Vietnam', 'left', 'minds', 'many', 'movie', 'actually', 'fair', 'action', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'really', 'several', 'stories', 'put', 'together', 'movie', 'group', 'Green', 'Berets', 'are', 'transferred', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'beginning', 'movie', 'enemy', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'why', 'were', 'Vietnam', 'logic', 'time', 'logic', 'was', 'rooted', 'kind', 'idealism', 'carried', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'not', 'truly', 'applicable', 'situation', 'Vietnam', 'laying', 'groundwork', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'Vietnam', 'soon', 'meet', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'regular', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'playing', 'Sgt', 'Peterson', 'Peter-Sahn', 'Hamchuck', 'Craig', 'Jue', 'Vietnamese', 'orphan', 'Soon', 'team', 'way', 'Vietnam.Once', 'Vietnam', 'group', 'mission', 'be', 'part', 'teams', 'establishing', 'bases', 'hills', 'serve', 'points', 'stability', 'locals', 'protecting', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'Army', 'NVA', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'evil', 'enemy', 'women', 'children', 'men', 'too', 'see', 'innocents', 'ruthlessly', 'murdered', 'also', 'see', 'firefight', 'where', 'NVA', 'win', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'aftermath', 'scene', 'where', 'NVA', 'remove', 'anything', 'everything', 'value', 'dead', 'left', 'overrun', 'camp.Later', 'group', 'Green', 'Berets', 'go', 'mission', 'capture', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'general', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'morally', 'enemy', 'way', 'see', 'sophisticated', 'booby-trap', 'kill', 'one', 'principal', 'characters', 'set', 'up', 'poignant', 'ending.David', 'Janssen', 'reporter', 'George', 'Beckworth', 'who', 'Green', 'Berets', 'beginning', 'end', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'movie', 'how', 'misconceptions', 'war', 'are', 'overcome', 'incidents', 'end', 'war', 'George', 'become', 'convinced', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Vietnam', 'truth', 'justice', 'American', 'way', 'will', 'prevail.There', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'interesting', 'contain', 'combination', 'accuracy', 'inaccuracy', 'balloon', 'extraction', 'system', 'was', 'used', 'remove', 'Vietnamese', 'general', 'jungle', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'was', 'actual', 'system', 'aircraft', 'pick', 'up', 'object', 'ground', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'stress', 'would', 'do', 'human', 'body', 'even', 'better', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Puff', 'Magic', 'Dragon', 'was', 'used', 'Puff', 'was', 'AC-47', 'modified', 'version', 'C-47', 'military', 'version', 'DC-3', 'Gatling', 'guns', 'mounted', 'left', 'side', 'plane', 'configuration', 'was', 'relatively', 'simple', 'concentrated', 'incredible', 'amount', 'firepower', 'small', 'area', 'plane', 'was', 'precursor', 'significantly', 'more', 'powerful', 'sophisticated', 'AC-130', 'Spectre', 'Gunship', 'most', 'recent', 'version', 'call', 'sign', 'Spooky', 'scenes', 'helicopters', 'taking', 'off', 'returning', 'missions', 'are', 'also', 'impressive', 'helicopter', 'technology', 'advanced', 'significantly', 'decades', 'war.It', 'easy', 'pick', 'movie', 'distortion', 'situation', 'Vietnam', 'incredibly', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'Add', 'gross', 'inaccuracies', 'such', 'sun', 'setting', 'ocean', 'Vietnamese', 'coast', 'east', 'movie', 'can', 'seem', 'poorly', 'veiled', 'propaganda', 'film', 'However', 'considering', 'era', 'Duke', 'miss', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'personal', 'statement', 'regarding', 'Vietnam', 'many', 'others', 'felt', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'was', 'human', 'decency', 'prevent', 'what', 'would', 'did', 'happen', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'won', 'Many', 'truly', 'believed', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'communists', 'were', 'more', 'evil', 'corrupt', 'government', 'south.If', 'ignore', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'later', 'movies', 'covered', 'topic', 'much', 'better', 'end', 'up', 'movie', 'tradition', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'where', 'was', 'easy', 'define', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'principal', 'motivation', 'be', 'there', 'was', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'right', 'versus', 'wrong', 'movie', 'sobering', 'end', 'era', 'country', 'film-making', 'point', 'forward', 'would', 'realize', 'rarely', 'are', 'situations', 'black', 'white', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'careful', 'how', 'approached', 'situations', 'such', 'film', 'did', 'nothing', 'else', 'perhaps', 'helped', 'realize', 'how', 'complicated', 'world', 'actually']",The Green Berets VHS

It is very emotional and the group dymanics are a major part of this plot.As the other reviewers have pointed out, one will notice that this film has a slant which is in favour of the Vietnam war and maybe that it isn't exactly accurate. It has some propaganda mixed into it, but what can you expect from a war time film? Without reference to what side this movie is advocating, I think it is generally a good and interesting film with good acting.That being said, the bias of the film is not as strong as some would like to make it seem. The war was a very decisive issue and was a major dividing line in the 1960's and 1970's. I think we can sit back now, and watch this film for what it is worth. Even if we don't necessarily share the patriotic feelings that the maker of the film seems to have. We do well to realize that it is an interesting film put together by people who had a particular perspective on this war.The film has more depth beyond who was wrong and who was right. The young kid who is distraught at the end brings to light that the greatest causulties of war are not the soliders, sometimes they are the survivors who were never even enrolled into the war.",5,A Good Film!,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,1207,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'very', 'emotional', 'group', 'dymanics', 'are', 'major', 'part', 'plot.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'one', 'will', 'notice', 'film', 'slant', 'favour', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'accurate', 'propaganda', 'mixed', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'war', 'time', 'film', 'reference', 'what', 'side', 'movie', 'advocating', 'think', 'generally', 'good', 'interesting', 'film', 'good', 'acting.That', 'being', 'said', 'bias', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'seem', 'war', 'was', 'very', 'decisive', 'issue', 'was', 'major', 'dividing', 'line', '1960', '1970', 'think', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'now', 'watch', 'film', 'what', 'worth', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'share', 'patriotic', 'feelings', 'maker', 'film', 'have', 'do', 'well', 'realize', 'interesting', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'particular', 'perspective', 'war.The', 'film', 'more', 'depth', 'who', 'was', 'wrong', 'who', 'was', 'right', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'distraught', 'end', 'light', 'greatest', 'causulties', 'war', 'are', 'not', 'soliders', 'sometimes', 'are', 'survivors', 'who', 'were', 'never', 'even', 'enrolled', 'war']",The Green Berets VHS

231311,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,6300267830,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[97, 114]","As others have mentioned, this is perhaps the only pro-war film ever made about our involvement in Vietnam, either at the time of the war or since.Pretty much these days, nobody espouses a pro-war stance on the Vietnam conflict. It was not a ""good"" war, after all, and the war will always be part and parcel with the agony of America's social chaos in the late 60's and early 70's. However, at the time, the social battle lines were well defined between the peaceniks and the hawks; those against the war, and those all in favor of it. Without the thirty-plus years of hindsight to help them put this conflict in perspective, the hawks were pretty gung-ho. Likewise, the the peaceniks, who thought that if we just ""love each other"" everything would be alright, looks pretty naive and childish. If only the world were so simple.Like the war, this film engenders strong feelings in those who see it. The DUKE was a known hawk, and you can see it shine through in every line, and in every scene. Like most hawks at the time, I suspect that The DUKE simply thought Vietnam was just like any other war (most likely, World War II), and it was incomprehensible to them that anyone would be against it. The film, in turn, reflects the hawk viewpoint.In other words, you could substitute the Vietnamese with the Japanese in WWII, and the film would be more or less the same (good, upstanding Americans vs. big bad empire). The capture of the enemy general is pure WWII melodrama. The character of Petersen, the ""scrounger"", is also a stock character from a WWII movie. The staging of the action, the commando raid, blowing up a bridge, etc., all scream WWII.DUKE co-directs, and despite being filmed in Georgia (which looks nothing like Southeast Asia!), the results are really pretty good. The raid to capture the enemy general is laughable, but tense and exciting nevertheless. The characterizations are solid. The film flows nicely, and isn't too long or too short. The cinematography is workable, and at times, even impressive. There's plenty of action, too!When you see DUKE react to the child running from helicopter to helicopter looking for Petersen, you cannot help but have respect for this film. Certainly one of the best endings in American film history follows. Politics and anti-war sentiment of today's PC society aside, this is a great war film that honors the best of the best; the Green Berets.Let me take a moment and say a word or two about David Janssen's role as George Beckworth, the reporter for a left-wing and anti-war newspaper. The character is a little too obvious, and at first, a little too strong on the anti-war sentiment. His conversion was a little too predictable, but the handling of his conversion to pro-war is very well-handled. Ultimately, I think it was a believable transformation, and this is due entirely to Janssen's talent. In the hands of another, less skilled actor, the Beckworth character could have been a big sore point, but Janssen makes Beckworth a quiet force, a wall of anti-war sentiment needing to be erroded away by the reality of the situation he finds himself in. In many ways, I think Janssen's underplayed approach for Beckworth makes him seem more real, and ultimately sells the character. It helps sell the movie too, despite our modern perspective on the war.Appearing in supporting roles are Jack Soo (Nick Yemana on ""Barney Miller""), George Takei (Sulu on ""Star Trek""), and Bruce Cabot. Cabot had starred in a great many films, and ""The Green Beret"" is one of his last. He was a favorite DUKE co-star, appearing with DUKE in ""Hellfighters"", ""Big Jake"", ""Chisum"", ""The War Wagon"", ""In Harm's Way"", ""McLintock!"", ""Hatari!"", and others. Cabot is probably most famous for rescuing Fay Wray from King Kong. Also on hand is The DUKE's son, Patrick Wayne. Patrick appears as the commander of a Seabee team, following in his father's footsteps (DUKE starred in the famous homage to the outfit, ""The Fighting Seabees"").DUKE fans should try to locate a copy of the video ""No Substitute For Victory"" (available on this site), in which DUKE hosts a right-wing documentary look at our reasons for fighting in Southeast Asia. Watching this documentary after the film will give the viewer new insights into the thinking of the hawks at the time, and their position during the Vietnam conflict.",4,"Odd, but memorable...",1024185600,"06 16, 2002",2002,4338,"['others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'perhaps', 'only', 'pro-war', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'involvement', 'Vietnam', 'either', 'time', 'war', 'since.Pretty', 'much', 'days', 'nobody', 'pro-war', 'stance', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'war', 'war', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'part', 'parcel', 'agony', 'America', 'social', 'chaos', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'However', 'time', 'social', 'battle', 'lines', 'were', 'well', 'defined', 'peaceniks', 'hawks', 'war', 'favor', 'thirty-plus', 'years', 'hindsight', 'help', 'put', 'conflict', 'perspective', 'hawks', 'were', 'pretty', 'gung-ho', 'Likewise', 'peaceniks', 'who', 'thought', 'just', 'love', 'other', 'everything', 'would', 'be', 'alright', 'pretty', 'naive', 'childish', 'only', 'world', 'were', 'so', 'simple.Like', 'war', 'film', 'strong', 'feelings', 'who', 'see', 'DUKE', 'was', 'known', 'hawk', 'can', 'see', 'shine', 'line', 'scene', 'most', 'hawks', 'time', 'suspect', 'DUKE', 'simply', 'thought', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'just', 'other', 'war', 'most', 'likely', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'incomprehensible', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'turn', 'hawk', 'viewpoint.In', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'substitute', 'Vietnamese', 'Japanese', 'WWII', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'good', 'upstanding', 'Americans', 'vs.', 'big', 'bad', 'empire', 'capture', 'enemy', 'general', 'pure', 'WWII', 'melodrama', 'character', 'Petersen', 'scrounger', 'also', 'stock', 'character', 'WWII', 'movie', 'staging', 'action', 'commando', 'raid', 'blowing', 'up', 'bridge', 'etc.', 'scream', 'WWII.DUKE', 'co-directs', 'being', 'filmed', 'Georgia', 'nothing', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'results', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'raid', 'capture', 'enemy', 'general', 'laughable', 'tense', 'exciting', 'nevertheless', 'characterizations', 'are', 'solid', 'film', 'nicely', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'too', 'short', 'cinematography', 'workable', 'times', 'even', 'impressive', 'plenty', 'action', 'too', 'When', 'see', 'DUKE', 'react', 'child', 'running', 'helicopter', 'helicopter', 'looking', 'Petersen', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'have', 'respect', 'film', 'Certainly', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'American', 'film', 'history', 'Politics', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'today', 'PC', 'society', 'aside', 'great', 'war', 'film', 'best', 'best', 'Green', 'Berets.Let', 'take', 'moment', 'say', 'word', 'two', 'David', 'Janssen', 'role', 'George', 'Beckworth', 'reporter', 'left-wing', 'anti-war', 'newspaper', 'character', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'first', 'little', 'too', 'strong', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'conversion', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'predictable', 'handling', 'conversion', 'pro-war', 'very', 'well-handled', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'was', 'believable', 'transformation', 'due', 'entirely', 'Janssen', 'talent', 'hands', 'less', 'skilled', 'actor', 'Beckworth', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'sore', 'point', 'Janssen', 'Beckworth', 'quiet', 'force', 'wall', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'needing', 'be', 'erroded', 'away', 'reality', 'situation', 'many', 'ways', 'think', 'Janssen', 'underplayed', 'approach', 'Beckworth', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'ultimately', 'character', 'sell', 'movie', 'too', 'modern', 'perspective', 'war.Appearing', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'Jack', 'Soo', 'Nick', 'Yemana', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'George', 'Takei', 'Sulu', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'Cabot', 'had', 'starred', 'great', 'many', 'films', 'Green', 'Beret', 'one', 'last', 'was', 'favorite', 'DUKE', 'co-star', 'appearing', 'DUKE', 'Hellfighters', 'Big', 'Jake', 'Chisum', 'War', 'Wagon', 'Harm', 'Way', 'McLintock', 'Hatari', 'others', 'Cabot', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'rescuing', 'Fay', 'Wray', 'King', 'Kong', 'Also', 'hand', 'DUKE', 'son', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Patrick', 'commander', 'Seabee', 'team', 'following', 'father', 'footsteps', 'DUKE', 'starred', 'famous', 'homage', 'outfit', 'Fighting', 'Seabees', '.DUKE', 'fans', 'should', 'try', 'locate', 'copy', 'video', 'Substitute', 'Victory', 'available', 'site', 'DUKE', 'right-wing', 'documentary', 'look', 'reasons', 'fighting', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Watching', 'documentary', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'viewer', 'new', 'insights', 'thinking', 'hawks', 'time', 'position', 'Vietnam', 'conflict']",The Green Berets VHS

G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[87, 106]","If you ever read Gustav Hasford's &quot;The Short-Timers&quot; (which &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; was based on) you know how he felt about this movie: &quot;Let's watch the Duke and Mr. Sulu karate-chop Victor Charlie in a Kodicolor fantasy about Vietnam.&quot; In other words, he thought it was bunk. So does everyone else on the left, who have bought into the myth that Vietnam was a purely guerilla war and that the human-wave assaults employed by the NVA/VC on Col. Kirby's camp in the film would never have happened in real life. In point of fact almost 90% of the fighting in Vietnam was of the conventional type in the Central Highlands or the valleys (&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;) while only 10% of the troops were employed in the rice paddies you see in movies like &quot;Platoon.&quot; Whenever the NVA fought out in the open, a la the Tet Offensive, they were well and truly beaten, but their leadership was ruthless and understood that by trading 5 Vietnamese lives for one American, the U.S. will to fight would eventually break. They knew the American public had only tepid support for Vietnam and would not accept the losses. The result, of course, we all know. Hanoi Jane what she wanted and so did Uncle Ho. Too bad Jane didn't go back in say, 1975 and spend some time in a re-education camp. They could have taken pics of her in a tiger cage, eating bugs and rotting from typhus.If you are reading this you probably know the story of the movie.John Wayne's Col. Kirby and his elite Special Forces &quot;A&quot; Team (no, not the one with Hannibal and Face and B.A. Barracus)is sent to Vietnam to establish base camps which offer protection to the local farmers from the murderous Viet Cong (whose crimes against their own people are well documented here). The soldiers teach the locals how to fight while providing basic medical care and 20th century improvements to their primeval way of life. There is the usual big John Wayne type battle as the VC try to overrun the camp, followed by a commando raid deep into enemy territory, and a tragic-heroic ending. But the movie is more than the sum of its parts. It is not mere entertainment, it is personal propiganda, designed to present the Duke's argument for why America was fighting in Vietnam at all. The only failing is its sappiness and jingoism, which make it easy for opponents to ridicule. But making fun of it doesn't take away the fact that the Duke's argument was based on something he is rarely credited for -- human decency. What &quot;right&quot; did we have in Vietnam? I guess the same &quot;right&quot; we had to land on the beaches of Normandy. We had no &quot;right&quot; at all -- it was just the &quot;right thing to do&quot;, to support a bad government (South Vietnam) against a much worse government (North Vietnam) that used methods like mass killings of teachers, civil servants, nuns, missionaries, and village chiefs to destabilze the South and forcibly unite the country. You can argue about the legitimacy of taking sides in a civil war all day, but any country that uses methods like burying people alive and raping women to death as a matter of military policy probably deserves to be opposed, yes?Anyway, let me take a moment to say I LOVE THIS FREAKIN' MOVIE. Growing up, good old Washington D.C. Channel 20 (remember when you only had ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and your one local channel? Channel 20 was ours) played this movie, (along with &quot;The Battle of the Bulge&quot; and &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; and some other classics) about once every other day. Even the thought of it brings a smile to my face. Here was a guy, John Wayne, who had the guts to make a film this flag-shakingly right wing at a time when patriotism was growing unfashionable and millions of people were abandoning and spitting on the ideals that he embodied -- which, by the way, a few of us still hold true. As a movie, &quot;The Green Berets&quot; has a hard ideology of anti-communism and shows the newfangled Special Forces as a sort of elite brotherhood consecrated to fight against it. I think a lot of the hate directed against this movie comes from the surity of Kirby's (meaning John Wayne's) beliefs. They are rock-solid and not up for debate or negotiation. He understands what will (and did) happen to Vietnam if the North wins the war, and fights bitterly to prevent this from happening, while simultaneously trying to win over a stubborn journalist who has legitimate doubts about our involvement. No question, this movie is jingoistic and predictable, a Vietnam war movie packed in WWII casing, but who cares?",4,"Take that, Uncle Ho!",1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,4608,"['ever', 'read', 'Gustav', 'Hasford', 'quot', 'Short-Timers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'quot', 'was', 'based', 'know', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 'quot', 'Let', 'watch', 'Duke', 'Mr.', 'Sulu', 'karate-chop', 'Victor', 'Charlie', 'Kodicolor', 'fantasy', 'Vietnam.', 'quot', 'other', 'words', 'thought', 'was', 'bunk', 'So', 'everyone', 'else', 'left', 'who', 'have', 'bought', 'myth', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'purely', 'guerilla', 'war', 'human-wave', 'assaults', 'employed', 'NVA/VC', 'Col.', 'Kirby', 'camp', 'film', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'point', 'fact', 'almost', '90', '%', 'fighting', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'conventional', 'type', 'Central', 'Highlands', 'valleys', 'quot', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'only', '10', '%', 'troops', 'were', 'employed', 'rice', 'paddies', 'see', 'movies', 'quot', 'Platoon.', 'quot', 'Whenever', 'NVA', 'fought', 'out', 'open', 'la', 'Tet', 'Offensive', 'were', 'well', 'truly', 'beaten', 'leadership', 'was', 'ruthless', 'understood', 'trading', '5', 'Vietnamese', 'lives', 'one', 'American', 'U.S.', 'will', 'fight', 'would', 'eventually', 'break', 'knew', 'American', 'public', 'had', 'only', 'tepid', 'support', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'not', 'accept', 'losses', 'result', 'course', 'know', 'Hanoi', 'Jane', 'what', 'wanted', 'so', 'did', 'Uncle', 'Ho', 'Too', 'bad', 'Jane', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'say', '1975', 'spend', 'time', 're-education', 'camp', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'pics', 'tiger', 'cage', 'eating', 'bugs', 'rotting', 'typhus.If', 'are', 'reading', 'probably', 'know', 'story', 'movie.John', 'Wayne', 'Col.', 'Kirby', 'elite', 'Special', 'Forces', 'quot', 'A', 'quot', 'Team', 'not', 'one', 'Hannibal', 'Face', 'B.A', 'Barracus', 'sent', 'Vietnam', 'establish', 'base', 'camps', 'offer', 'protection', 'local', 'farmers', 'murderous', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'crimes', 'own', 'people', 'are', 'well', 'documented', 'here', 'soldiers', 'teach', 'locals', 'how', 'fight', 'providing', 'basic', 'medical', 'care', '20th', 'century', 'improvements', 'primeval', 'way', 'life', 'usual', 'big', 'John', 'Wayne', 'type', 'battle', 'VC', 'try', 'overrun', 'camp', 'followed', 'commando', 'raid', 'deep', 'enemy', 'territory', 'tragic-heroic', 'ending', 'movie', 'more', 'sum', 'parts', 'not', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'personal', 'propiganda', 'designed', 'present', 'Duke', 'argument', 'why', 'America', 'was', 'fighting', 'Vietnam', 'only', 'failing', 'sappiness', 'jingoism', 'make', 'easy', 'opponents', 'ridicule', 'making', 'fun', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'Duke', 'argument', 'was', 'based', 'something', 'rarely', 'credited', 'human', 'decency', 'What', 'quot', 'right', 'quot', 'did', 'have', 'Vietnam', 'guess', 'same', 'quot', 'right', 'quot', 'had', 'land', 'beaches', 'Normandy', 'had', 'quot', 'right', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'quot', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'quot', 'support', 'bad', 'government', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'much', 'worse', 'government', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'used', 'methods', 'mass', 'killings', 'teachers', 'civil', 'servants', 'nuns', 'missionaries', 'village', 'chiefs', 'destabilze', 'South', 'forcibly', 'unite', 'country', 'can', 'argue', 'legitimacy', 'taking', 'sides', 'civil', 'war', 'day', 'country', 'methods', 'burying', 'people', 'alive', 'raping', 'women', 'death', 'matter', 'military', 'policy', 'probably', 'be', 'opposed', 'yes', 'Anyway', 'let', 'take', 'moment', 'say', 'LOVE', 'THIS', 'FREAKIN', 'MOVIE', 'Growing', 'up', 'good', 'old', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Channel', '20', 'remember', 'when', 'only', 'had', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'NBC', 'PBS', 'one', 'local', 'channel', 'Channel', '20', 'was', 'ours', 'played', 'movie', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bridge', 'Remagen', 'quot', 'other', 'classics', 'once', 'other', 'day', 'Even', 'thought', 'smile', 'face', 'Here', 'was', 'guy', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'had', 'guts', 'make', 'film', 'flag-shakingly', 'right', 'wing', 'time', 'when', 'patriotism', 'was', 'growing', 'unfashionable', 'millions', 'people', 'were', 'abandoning', 'spitting', 'ideals', 'embodied', 'way', 'few', 'still', 'hold', 'true', 'movie', 'quot', 'Green', 'Berets', 'quot', 'hard', 'ideology', 'anti-communism', 'newfangled', 'Special', 'Forces', 'sort', 'elite', 'brotherhood', 'consecrated', 'fight', 'think', 'lot', 'hate', 'directed', 'movie', 'surity', 'Kirby', 'meaning', 'John', 'Wayne', 'beliefs', 'are', 'rock-solid', 'not', 'up', 'debate', 'negotiation', 'what', 'will', 'did', 'happen', 'Vietnam', 'North', 'war', 'fights', 'bitterly', 'prevent', 'happening', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'win', 'over', 'stubborn', 'journalist', 'who', 'legitimate', 'doubts', 'involvement', 'question', 'movie', 'jingoistic', 'predictable', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'movie', 'packed', 'WWII', 'casing', 'who']",The Green Berets VHS
231314,A3M4QGREWR0Z3O,6300267830,"Michael Daly ""Monkeesfan""","[18, 27]","The Green Berets offends a lot of movie critics. Leonard Maltin's comments pretty much sum up the ""right thinking"" attitude toward John Wayne's filmed tribute to the Army's Special Forces. It shows that Wayne got them where it hurt most - he affronted their worldview. This, ultimately, was and is the point Wayne hoped to make.Inspired by Robin Moore's superlative nonfiction novel about the Green Berets in Vietnam circa 1964, Wayne didn't set out to make an overly realistic portrayal of the fighting in Vietnam - his purpose was to put to the big screen a sympathetic portrayal of American soldiers and the American effort in Vietnam at a time when the term baby-killer was becoming an all-too-familiar libel pasted on those in the service. Wayne had his own misgivings over how the war was handled at the top level of government, but he noted over the years that the US did make a commitment, and the idea for the film came after a USO tour of the country and chats with soldiers.Wayne wanted the film made in Vietnam itself, but could not get permission and thus had to settle for filming it at Fort Benning, Georgia. Wayne and Ray Kellogg strove hard to make the film as believable looking as they could given the constraints they were working under.Nitpickers will of course uncover a lot wrong with the film - the overly stylized battle scenes, the stylized and sometimes cliched portrayal of the soldier-characters - notably Jim Hutton's Sgt. Peterson and Also Ray's Sgt. Muldoon. They'll note, as a recent biography of Wayne quite unfairly does, the differences between the events in the film and similar events in Robin Moore's book. But the film has aged much better than the leftist fraudulence of such works as Vietnam: Hearts & Minds and the quasi-surrealism of Apocalypse Now have. This is because Wayne and company made it without any pretense, and because the film's pro-American view of the war is far more accurate an historical gauge given the disasterous events that befell Indochina after the fall of Saigon - as Wayne might have asked, why would anyone want to see the Allies not win in Vietnam?As an action film, The Green Berets is quite entertaining, as Wayne assembled an engaging cast including Hutton, Ray, David Janssen in one of his first projects after the completion of The Fugitive television series, Luke Askew - reportedly Askew was a reallife antiwar activist, so how he signed onto this film is a puzzle - Edward Faulkner, Jason Evers, George Takei, and Jack Soo. The action for two-thirds of the film centers around a Forces basecamp that is in the heart of 'Cong territory, and which the NVA assaults and finally destroys only to be slaughtered by an AC-47 gunship. Following this mini-Khe Sanh seige Wayne signs on to lead a mission to kidnap a well known 'Cong general.The film ultimately is an action yarn that pops the antiwar left right in the eyes.",4,Wayne Sticks It To The Antiwar Left,976320000,"12 9, 2000",2000,2896,"['Green', 'Berets', 'lot', 'movie', 'critics', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'comments', 'pretty', 'much', 'sum', 'up', 'right', 'thinking', 'attitude', 'John', 'Wayne', 'filmed', 'tribute', 'Army', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Wayne', 'got', 'where', 'most', 'affronted', 'worldview', 'ultimately', 'was', 'point', 'Wayne', 'hoped', 'make.Inspired', 'Robin', 'Moore', 'superlative', 'nonfiction', 'novel', 'Green', 'Berets', 'Vietnam', 'circa', '1964', 'Wayne', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'make', 'overly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'fighting', 'Vietnam', 'purpose', 'was', 'put', 'big', 'screen', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'American', 'soldiers', 'American', 'effort', 'Vietnam', 'time', 'when', 'term', 'baby-killer', 'was', 'becoming', 'all-too-familiar', 'libel', 'pasted', 'service', 'Wayne', 'had', 'own', 'misgivings', 'how', 'war', 'was', 'handled', 'top', 'level', 'government', 'noted', 'years', 'US', 'did', 'make', 'commitment', 'idea', 'film', 'came', 'USO', 'tour', 'country', 'chats', 'soldiers.Wayne', 'wanted', 'film', 'made', 'Vietnam', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'permission', 'thus', 'had', 'settle', 'filming', 'Fort', 'Benning', 'Georgia', 'Wayne', 'Ray', 'Kellogg', 'strove', 'hard', 'make', 'film', 'believable', 'looking', 'could', 'given', 'constraints', 'were', 'working', 'under.Nitpickers', 'will', 'course', 'lot', 'wrong', 'film', 'overly', 'stylized', 'battle', 'scenes', 'stylized', 'sometimes', 'cliched', 'portrayal', 'soldier-characters', 'notably', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'Sgt', 'Peterson', 'Also', 'Ray', 'Sgt', 'Muldoon', ""'ll"", 'note', 'recent', 'biography', 'Wayne', 'quite', 'unfairly', 'differences', 'events', 'film', 'similar', 'events', 'Robin', 'Moore', 'book', 'film', 'aged', 'much', 'better', 'leftist', 'fraudulence', 'such', 'works', 'Vietnam', 'Hearts', 'Minds', 'quasi-surrealism', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'have', 'Wayne', 'company', 'made', 'pretense', 'film', 'pro-American', 'view', 'war', 'far', 'more', 'accurate', 'historical', 'gauge', 'given', 'disasterous', 'events', 'befell', 'Indochina', 'fall', 'Saigon', 'Wayne', 'might', 'have', 'asked', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'Allies', 'not', 'win', 'Vietnam', 'action', 'film', 'Green', 'Berets', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'Wayne', 'assembled', 'engaging', 'cast', 'including', 'Hutton', 'Ray', 'David', 'Janssen', 'one', 'first', 'projects', 'completion', 'Fugitive', 'television', 'series', 'Luke', 'Askew', 'reportedly', 'Askew', 'was', 'reallife', 'antiwar', 'activist', 'so', 'how', 'signed', 'film', 'puzzle', 'Edward', 'Faulkner', 'Jason', 'Evers', 'George', 'Takei', 'Jack', 'Soo', 'action', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'centers', 'Forces', 'basecamp', 'heart', ""'Cong"", 'territory', 'NVA', 'assaults', 'finally', 'only', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'AC-47', 'gunship', 'Following', 'mini-Khe', 'Sanh', 'seige', 'Wayne', 'signs', 'lead', 'mission', 'kidnap', 'well', 'known', ""'Cong"", 'general.The', 'film', 'ultimately', 'action', 'yarn', 'antiwar', 'left', 'right', 'eyes']",The Green Berets VHS

231322,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,6300267830,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[4, 7]","Here we get a simplistic view of a very complex war. We didn't know in 1968, when this film was released and when the action for American soldiers in Vietnam was very hot indeed, that it would be a full seven years before this political morass of a conflict would be ultimately ended and that the Americans would lose the war. In fact, in '68, the idea that we could possibly lose the Vietnam War probably didn't even occur to the average American.I said all that to lay the proper groundwork for the film. This is clearly a pro-war movie and it has suffered significant critical review (especially in retrospect) as a result. Hollywood drew upon their biggest gun, John Wayne, for the role of the tough and heroic Colonel Mike Kirby who ultimately ""wins the battle"" -- even Hollywood anticipated the risk of going out any further on a limb than this, given that they were no doubt more clearly apprised of the otherwise little-known actualities of America's lack of direction and progress in Vietnam.The story itself is a simple one: American soldiers are trying their best to crush the purveyors of horrific Communism and thus save the vulnerable South Vietnamese people from eternal, unfathomable atrocities which were generally associated with the North Vietnamese rulers and Vietcong soldiers during this time period. This Herculean task was to be accomplished, in this case, through superior tactics, by the employment of superior American weaponry, and, through the patriotic intestinal fortitude of John Wayne's sterling leadership. Of course, this microcosm of the war was allegedly representative of what we were supposedly doing all over South Vietnam.What you will NOT see in this film, which most later movies exploited, is drug use by American soldiers, prostitution for the troops offered by  Vietnamese women who were trying to survive their circumstances, or any of the other common, supplementary, and graphic appurtenances to the typical lengthy war. Other than Jim Hutton's little humorous Black Market escapades, it's mostly shooting and body counts. Here, the viewer can expect a very straightforward presentation of battle, tenoned with the occasional swatch of personal anguish.""The Green Berets"" is the antithesis to the more self-loathing, later-period, movies like ""Apocalypse Now,"" (1979) and ""The Deer Hunter,"" (1978). And it's probably accurate to say that each of these three flicks were reflective of the American public's general sentiment (in hindsight of Vietnam, regarding the latter two) at the time of their respective releases. I feel certain that both LBJ and Nixon would have wished for the production of a lot more movies like ""The Green Berets"".I based my 3-star rating on my view of the film AFTER having separated it from period politics. It's well-done in terms of cinematography, is supported by a quality filmscore (composed and effected by Miklos Rozsa), bulging with notable stars of the era (Jim Hutton, Mike Henry, Jack Soo), albeit I've never been a huge fan of David Janssen. I've always been turned off by his eternal despondence and grimness throughout his film career, ergo ""The Fugitive"" television series. In the end, one can't escape the propaganda feel of this film. Even at the time of its initial release I recall thinking that it was pretty stiff, and wreaking somewhat of Ozzie and Harriet-ness.""The Green Berets"" was filmed at Fort Benning, Georgia and if you look closely, you can spot that they utilized caucasians as some of the Vietcong soldiers. I do think that it was a fine performance by John Wayne, even though I'm not exactly rabid on The Duke as some folks are. Still, one cannot deny that he was perfect in the role. The film was co-directed by Ray Kellogg, John Wayne, and Mervyn LeRoy, the latter being uncredited.To summarize, I still enjoy seeing this film occasionally but about the only accurate part of it was the portrayal of the media's rising cynicism in regard to our continuing role in Vietnam.",3,A boost to LBJ and Nixon.,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,3984,"['Here', 'get', 'simplistic', 'view', 'very', 'complex', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', '1968', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'when', 'action', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'very', 'hot', 'indeed', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'seven', 'years', 'political', 'morass', 'conflict', 'would', 'be', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'Americans', 'would', 'lose', 'war', 'fact', ""'68"", 'idea', 'could', 'possibly', 'lose', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'occur', 'average', 'American.I', 'said', 'lay', 'proper', 'groundwork', 'film', 'clearly', 'pro-war', 'movie', 'suffered', 'significant', 'critical', 'review', 'especially', 'retrospect', 'result', 'Hollywood', 'drew', 'upon', 'biggest', 'gun', 'John', 'Wayne', 'role', 'tough', 'heroic', 'Colonel', 'Mike', 'Kirby', 'who', 'ultimately', 'battle', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'anticipated', 'risk', 'going', 'out', 'further', 'limb', 'given', 'were', 'doubt', 'more', 'clearly', 'apprised', 'otherwise', 'little-known', 'actualities', 'America', 'lack', 'direction', 'progress', 'Vietnam.The', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'American', 'soldiers', 'are', 'trying', 'best', 'crush', 'purveyors', 'horrific', 'Communism', 'thus', 'save', 'vulnerable', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'eternal', 'unfathomable', 'atrocities', 'were', 'generally', 'associated', 'North', 'Vietnamese', 'rulers', 'Vietcong', 'soldiers', 'time', 'period', 'Herculean', 'task', 'was', 'be', 'accomplished', 'case', 'superior', 'tactics', 'employment', 'superior', 'American', 'weaponry', 'patriotic', 'intestinal', 'fortitude', 'John', 'Wayne', 'sterling', 'leadership', 'course', 'microcosm', 'war', 'was', 'allegedly', 'representative', 'what', 'were', 'supposedly', 'doing', 'South', 'Vietnam.What', 'will', 'NOT', 'see', 'film', 'most', 'later', 'movies', 'exploited', 'drug', 'use', 'American', 'soldiers', 'prostitution', 'troops', 'offered', 'Vietnamese', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'survive', 'circumstances', 'other', 'common', 'supplementary', 'graphic', 'appurtenances', 'typical', 'lengthy', 'war', 'Other', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'little', 'humorous', 'Black', 'Market', 'mostly', 'shooting', 'body', 'counts', 'Here', 'viewer', 'can', 'expect', 'very', 'straightforward', 'presentation', 'battle', 'tenoned', 'occasional', 'swatch', 'personal', 'anguish', 'Green', 'Berets', 'antithesis', 'more', 'self-loathing', 'later-period', 'movies', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', '1979', 'Deer', 'Hunter', '1978', 'probably', 'accurate', 'say', 'three', 'flicks', 'were', 'reflective', 'American', 'public', 'general', 'sentiment', 'hindsight', 'Vietnam', 'regarding', 'latter', 'two', 'time', 'respective', 'releases', 'feel', 'certain', 'LBJ', 'Nixon', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'production', 'lot', 'more', 'movies', 'Green', 'Berets', '.I', 'based', '3-star', 'rating', 'view', 'film', 'AFTER', 'having', 'separated', 'period', 'politics', 'well-done', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'supported', 'quality', 'filmscore', 'composed', 'effected', 'Miklos', 'Rozsa', 'bulging', 'notable', 'stars', 'era', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'Jack', 'Soo', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'David', 'Janssen', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'turned', 'off', 'eternal', 'despondence', 'grimness', 'film', 'career', 'ergo', 'Fugitive', 'television', 'series', 'end', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'propaganda', 'feel', 'film', 'Even', 'time', 'initial', 'release', 'recall', 'thinking', 'was', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'wreaking', 'somewhat', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet-ness', 'Green', 'Berets', 'was', 'filmed', 'Fort', 'Benning', 'Georgia', 'look', 'closely', 'can', 'spot', 'utilized', 'caucasians', 'Vietcong', 'soldiers', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'fine', 'performance', 'John', 'Wayne', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'rabid', 'Duke', 'folks', 'are', 'Still', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'co-directed', 'Ray', 'Kellogg', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'latter', 'being', 'uncredited.To', 'summarize', 'still', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'film', 'occasionally', 'only', 'accurate', 'part', 'was', 'portrayal', 'media', 'rising', 'cynicism', 'regard', 'continuing', 'role', 'Vietnam']",The Green Berets VHS

When it was released in 1968 in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive(which America won) the American public and its leadership had rejected the overly optimistic outlook and bought the line the war was unwinnable and America should withdraw regardless of what happened to the South Vietnamese. If this was released in 1964, when there were few war critics outside of leftist and Black nationalist circles, it would have accurately reflected this country's view of South Vietnam and the war in 1964.Second, John Wayne is like many war movie stars. It is a known fact that Charlie Sheen (Platoon), Mel Gibson( When we were Soldiers) Chuck Norris (Missing in Action 1,2and 3) and Sly Stallone (First Blood 1,2 and 3) never served in combat or the military. However, John Wayne did tour South Vietnam with the USO. Movie actors are selected on box office drawing power not their backgrounds. If John Wayne wasn't in this movie, would this be a classic ?Third,  this movie didn't accurately portray the corruption, nepotism, indecisiveness and bad decisions of the South Vietnamese army and its officials (which led to South Vietnam's defeat in 1975). It also didn't show the American killing of civilians (which did not occur regularly until after the big build up began in 1965 and were generally committed by units such as the Americal Division with suffered from bad leadership). What it did show was North Vietnamese troops were active in South Vietnam before 1965 (the left always denies this). their slaughter of civilians in this movie was a glimpse of what they were to do in Hue in 1968 (the left still says the massacre never happened) and in all of South East Asia after 1975.Finally, John Wayne did do something that wasn't common at the time in military movies, he put a African-American actor (Raymond St. Jacques) in a leading role. Jacques portrayl of Sgt McGhee came accross as very dignified and intelligent. As the medic of the unit, he was ask by Lt. Col. Kirby (Wayne) for advice. Although John Wayne was not known to be a Civil Rights supporter and considered to be a racist by many radical Black circles, the character of Sgt McGhee was a breakthrough in potrayal of African-Americans in the movies.I watched this movie along with Platoon during my basic training at Fort Dix, N.J. in 1987. The recruits loved it! However, this was during the Reagan era when the cold war was a fact of life.

For this reason, as well as the healing period our country went through after Vietnam, the movie seems rather archaic and naive today.  Those on the far left ridicule it.  Those on the far right treat it with the reverence of a Biblical tale.  The truth about &quot;The Green Berets&quot; is that it lies somewhere between these two extremes.The Fort Benning, Georgia filmed training sequences appear to be as real as anything I ever saw while I was in uniform.  The combat sequences, however, contained a fair share of errors, most notably the well-known &quot;sun setting in the east&quot; flub.  The acting was rather wooden, especially from Wayne as well as Jack Soo, portraying the ARVN officer, and the plot meandered from being quite good in some parts to being downright silly in others.The most important thing to remember about this movie is that it should be taken for what it is...a good war movie.  To casually dismiss it as irrelevant or hopelessly out of step with the truth simply doesn't do it justice.  In similar fashion, it's rather stupid to portray it as an homage to the American way of life and characterize those who point out this picture's many flaws as &quot;un-American&quot;, as one previous review did.

Most that nit-pick this movie do so out of knee-jerk anti-everything-about-the-Vietnam-War-and I question their morality, what if we fought the war and casualties were under 1,000 over a 10 year period, would these folks still oppose the war? I'd say yes, because to them &quot;me-first&quot; is their guiding mantra. John Wayne is right on target in this movie because he shows the essential truth that the VC/NVA were trying to enforce their communist will on the South, whether the South's government was perfect is irrelevent.

Thus, if you're against the War in Iraq, for example, you're unpatriotic or anti-soldier.  If you're for it, you're some sort of imperialist or pawn of the robberbarons.  Can anything in life be so neatly divided?  Ironically, I was reminded of this schism while watching ""The Green Berets.""  On one hand, the film correctly celebrates the bravery and dedication of American soldiers during an era in which many men--including my own father--and women served honorably in our armed forces, even if some, as is always the case with any military throughout history, clearly did not.  On the other hand, it's almost pathological determination to sell the Viet Nam War while using cheap dramatic constructs and generally childish assumptions marks it as propaganda of the clumsiest kind.  What then to make of it?  Well, if you're a John Wayne fan--which I am--the Duke turns in a reasonably enjoyable performance, on par with his solid presence in such classics as ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Sons of Katie Elder,"" even if he seems too old and out-of-shape for the character he plays.  Co-stars Jim Hutton, David Jansen, and George Takei, along with many of Wayne's frequent supporting players, are quite capable, and the production itself--aside from some dicey model work with a helicopter--has a Hollywood gloss.  The script and direction (for which Wayne shares some of the responsibility), on the other hand, often come up short.  An attack on a base camp, for instance, is suitably dramatic, but soon after the battle is lost at great expense by the Green Berets and South Vietnamese civilians, a short strafing run eliminates the enemy, leaving viewers to wonder if a tactical evacuation of the camp without the costly battle might have been a wiser course of action in the first place.  The script also is compelled to introduce one tragedy after another, most of which focus on the plight of a young Vietnamese boy (even if his name and others are typical Hollywood gibberish for Asian terms and nomenclature).  ""Ham Chuk's"" home, belongings, parents, dog, and American surrogate father all fall victim to the war, leaving viewers to scratch their heads when the Wayne character reassures the boy at the end that the Americans are there to help people like him--just how much more help of this kind can the poor kid take?  Even the actual combat scenes, while sometimes gruesome for the day, seem rather juvenile, as the film takes a laughably cowboys-and-Indians approach to many scenes.  If watched as a pseudo-western with stock characters and fantasy ideas about real life, ""The Green Berets"" is palatable; if viewed as actual commentary about the war, it's a lot harder to take.",3,Watch It as Fantasy and Not Much Else,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,2822,"['terrible', 'thing', 'present', 'day', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'want', 'reduce', 'complex', 'ideas', 'situations', 'simplest', 'notions', 'Thus', ""'re"", 'War', 'Iraq', 'example', ""'re"", 'unpatriotic', 'anti-soldier', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'sort', 'imperialist', 'pawn', 'robberbarons', 'Can', 'anything', 'life', 'be', 'so', 'neatly', 'divided', 'Ironically', 'was', 'reminded', 'schism', 'watching', 'Green', 'Berets', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'correctly', 'bravery', 'dedication', 'American', 'soldiers', 'era', 'many', 'men', 'including', 'own', 'father', 'women', 'served', 'honorably', 'armed', 'forces', 'even', 'always', 'case', 'military', 'history', 'clearly', 'did', 'not', 'other', 'hand', 'almost', 'pathological', 'determination', 'sell', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'War', 'using', 'cheap', 'dramatic', 'constructs', 'generally', 'childish', 'assumptions', 'propaganda', 'clumsiest', 'kind', 'What', 'then', 'make', 'Well', ""'re"", 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'am', 'Duke', 'reasonably', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'par', 'solid', 'presence', 'such', 'classics', 'Longest', 'Day', 'Sons', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'even', 'too', 'old', 'out-of-shape', 'character', 'Co-stars', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'David', 'Jansen', 'George', 'Takei', 'many', 'Wayne', 'frequent', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'quite', 'capable', 'production', 'aside', 'dicey', 'model', 'work', 'helicopter', 'Hollywood', 'gloss', 'script', 'direction', 'Wayne', 'shares', 'responsibility', 'other', 'hand', 'often', 'come', 'up', 'short', 'attack', 'base', 'camp', 'instance', 'suitably', 'dramatic', 'soon', 'battle', 'lost', 'great', 'expense', 'Green', 'Berets', 'South', 'Vietnamese', 'civilians', 'short', 'strafing', 'run', 'enemy', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'wonder', 'tactical', 'evacuation', 'camp', 'costly', 'battle', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'wiser', 'course', 'action', 'first', 'place', 'script', 'also', 'compelled', 'introduce', 'one', 'tragedy', 'most', 'focus', 'plight', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'boy', 'even', 'name', 'others', 'are', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'gibberish', 'Asian', 'terms', 'nomenclature', 'Ham', 'Chuk', 'home', 'belongings', 'parents', 'dog', 'American', 'surrogate', 'fall', 'victim', 'war', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'scratch', 'heads', 'when', 'Wayne', 'character', 'boy', 'end', 'Americans', 'are', 'there', 'help', 'people', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'help', 'kind', 'can', 'poor', 'kid', 'take', 'Even', 'actual', 'combat', 'scenes', 'sometimes', 'gruesome', 'day', 'seem', 'rather', 'juvenile', 'film', 'laughably', 'cowboys-and-Indians', 'approach', 'many', 'scenes', 'watched', 'pseudo-western', 'stock', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'ideas', 'real', 'life', 'Green', 'Berets', 'palatable', 'viewed', 'actual', 'commentary', 'war', 'lot', 'harder', 'take']",The Green Berets VHS

This movie goes some way towards showing how effective these devices could be, and how they could even account for 40% of casualties in some units.TGB wasn't just a piece of shameless flag waving by The Duke, it was an attempt to humanize the War and make people care about the individual soldiers above all, at a time when the Communist hijack of the Peace Movement had made many people shun the returning troops and label them ""baby killers"". Even though it was the VC who were sometimes booby trapping live babies in order to kill American soldiers.If America feels guilt about VietNam, it should primarily be for the way it abandoned its young men to the Communist-led jackals of the ""don't think, just chant something"" sixties.The returning troops, whose average age was nineteen (just think of all the eighteen and nineteen year olds you know) heard all manner of hateful derision and ridicule back in the World.The one thing they didn't hear was the one thing they SHOULD have heard...Welcome home, brothers and sisters.That is why The Duke made this movie, and for that reason alone, it has value.",4,The Duke socks Communism on the jaw,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,1985,"['overall', 'tone', 'style', 'Green', 'Berets', 'make', 'somewhat', 'anachronistic', 'especially', 'ghastly', 'mercifully', 'brief', 'chorale', 'end', 'still', 'elements', 'make', 'watchable', 'VietNam', 'movie.All', 'politics', 'aside', 'was', 'Duke', 'from-the-heart', 'tribute', 'men', 'women', 'serving', 'Nam', 'who', 'were', 'quite', 'unjustly', 'being', 'blamed', 'machinations', 'military-industrial', 'complex.No', 'situation', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'straightforward', 'TGB', 'movie', 'give', 'something', 'feel', 'nature', 'jungle', 'warfare', 'such', 'cover', 'point', 'methods', 'moving', 'areas', 'were', 'often', 'laced', 'booby', 'traps', 'snipers.Having', 'had', 'lecture', 'VC', 'booby', 'traps', 'field', 'engineer', '1', 'ATF', 'Phuoc', 'Tuy', 'province', '1971', 'was', 'not', 'military', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'anybody', 'ever', 'survived', 'month', 'let', 'alone', 'tour', 'movie', 'way', 'showing', 'how', 'effective', 'devices', 'could', 'be', 'how', 'could', 'even', 'account', '40', '%', 'casualties', 'units.TGB', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'piece', 'shameless', 'flag', 'waving', 'Duke', 'was', 'attempt', 'humanize', 'War', 'make', 'people', 'care', 'individual', 'soldiers', 'time', 'when', 'Communist', 'hijack', 'Peace', 'Movement', 'had', 'made', 'many', 'people', 'shun', 'returning', 'troops', 'label', 'baby', 'killers', 'Even', 'was', 'VC', 'who', 'were', 'sometimes', 'booby', 'trapping', 'live', 'babies', 'order', 'kill', 'American', 'soldiers.If', 'America', 'guilt', 'VietNam', 'should', 'primarily', 'be', 'way', 'abandoned', 'young', 'men', 'Communist-led', 'jackals', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'chant', 'something', 'sixties.The', 'returning', 'troops', 'average', 'age', 'was', 'nineteen', 'just', 'think', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'year', 'know', 'heard', 'manner', 'hateful', 'derision', 'ridicule', 'back', 'World.The', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'heard', 'Welcome', 'home', 'brothers', 'sisters.That', 'why', 'Duke', 'made', 'movie', 'reason', 'alone', 'value']",The Green Berets VHS

Colonel Mike Kirby, the Duke, has been ordered to form two teams of Green Berets and head into South Vietnam for two missions. The first is to help build Army base camps deep in Viet Cong territory, and the second is to capture an important North Vietnamese general deep in the Cambodian jungle. For many years critics have unfairly ripped this movie to pieces because Wayne inserted his own beliefs in the movie.  The Green Berets is an exciting, old-fashioned war movie that in reality could be set in WWII in the Pacific Theater if it wanted.  This is a highly enjoyable Duke adventure with plenty of action and really a lot of fun overall. Don't listen to the critics' reviews and you'll really enjoy this movie.John Wayne stars as Colonel Mike Kirby, the leader of two teams of Green Berets with several dangerous missions to take care of near the Cambodian border.  Even in his 60's, Wayne was still an intimidating figure. David Janssen plays cynical journalist David Beckworth, who does not understand why the United States are involved in Vietnam. Jim Hutton is excellent as Sgt. Peterson, a scrounger who takes a Vietnamese orphan(Craig Jue) under his wing. Wayne's team of Green Berets include some of his regulars including Aldo Ray, Raymond St. Jacques, George Takei, Patrick Wayne, Luke Askew, Edward Faulkner, Mike Henry, Chuck Roberson, Eddy Donno, and Rudy Robbins. The film also stars Bruce Cabot, Jack Soo, Irene Tsu, and Jason Evers. The DVD offers widescreen presentation, trailers from 7 John Wayne movies, and a promotional featurette.

231362,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6300267830,trebe,"[1, 2]","You may not appreciate the in your face political message, but The Green Berets (1968) is a solid and occasionally brutal film that shocks and entertains, while presenting a fairly consistent point of view.  Controversial and generally unpopular at the time, the Viet Nam conflict was not the subject of many mainstream films during the 1960's.  The Green Berets was a rare exception.  With big time production values, and a solid cast headed by the iconic John Wayne, the film plainly makes the case that with Communist forces seeking to take over the region, America's involvement in Viet Nam was justified and necessary.Looking back now, it is easy to regard The Green Berets as overly simplistic pro-war propaganda, however the film still remains historically significant.  Media coverage at the time was perhaps lacking, a point that is made clear in the movie.  So for some, The Green Berets may have helped shape and influence their perceptions of the conflict, and served as their introduction to the M16 and punji  stick.  Claims that the film is not historically accurate may be justified, but it is perhaps unfair to hold The Green Berets to a higher standard for realism than your typical World War II adventure.Even with a heavy handed pro-war slant, The Green Berets is still an engaging often riveting tale, particularly in the first half of this 144 minute epic.  John Wayne stars as Colonel Mike Kirby, who arrives at Fort Bragg to prepare to take a team of Green Beret to Viet Nam.  One of the key elements of the film is the inclusion of journalist George Beckworth (David Janssen), who joints Kirby's team in Da Nang as an observer.  As someone unfamiliar with the nature of the war and the enemy, Beckworth represents the audience.  His exposure to the harsh realities and brutalities of the conflict, mirrors the typical viewer.In the jungles of Nam, the film is divided between two major operations.  The first involves the team's arrival as reinforcements at a basecamp deep in the jungle, where they immediately begin to make preparations to fortify the camp's defenses and extend the perimeter.  Much happens in the course of their brief stay.  Through interaction with the people, encounters with the enemy, acts of violence, and the cumulative effect of many personal tragedies, we form an impression of the nature and scope of the war, and the cruelty of enemy.With an officer killed the day before he is to be sent home, and soldiers slain by traitorous Viet Cong within the camp, the writing may be heavy-handed and loaded with clich&eacute;s, the results however are still quite effective, as the story quickly draws you in, and has you there in the camp with the group.  Beckworth gives a young injured girl his pendant, only to get it back the next day, after she is murder by the Viet Cong.  A bright spot occurs when Sergeant Petersen (Jim Hutton), adopts Hamchuck, a young orphan boy, but the good times are short lived.  The group's stay in the village comes to an end, when the enemy is gratuitously annihilated by mini-gun fire from a passing US plane.The second operation is an undercover mission, working with South Vietnamese Army Colonel Cai (Jack Soo), and using his sister-in-law (Irene Tsu) as bait, to kidnap an enemy general from a safe house deep behind enemy lines.  The operation gives the team a chance to display more of their deadly skills, as after the general has been captured, the team is pursued through the jungle.  Fittingly, just as success seems to be in sight, tragedy strikes, providing a somber ending to the film, which manages to close with a faint note of hope, as a version of former Green Beret Barry Sadler's The Ballad of the Green Berets plays.The politics that are integral to the film may bother some, but The Green Berets largely features old style WWII filmmaking, applied to a new conflict, one that did not have the same kind of public support.  Shot mainly on location in Georgia, the film serves as a testament to John Wayne's support for America's presence in Viet Nam.  It features standout performances by Jim Hutton and David Janssen, with solid work by George Takai, Aldo Ray, Raymond St. Jacques, Bruce Cabot, Jack Soo, and Irene Tsu.  The Green Berets really does look outstanding in Bluray, though regrettably there is just one extra feature.  Other films about the Viet Nam conflict would eventually follow, but with all its faults, The Green Berets is one of the landmark films about this chapter in America's history.",4,"""It's pretty hard to talk to anyone about this country, until they've come over here and seen it...""(John Wayne as Col.

I find it disturbing that it gets so much bad press cause it didn't have an anti war message or that it didn't portray acurately the war in Viet Nam. First on the anti war message. I think that the scene where they tell David Jansen, the reporter, about how the communist went in and killed all the politicians, the school teachers, women, and children ( which proved to be accurate after what we saw and found out in Cambodia under the communist) and when he found the little girl dead and mutilated is one hell of an anti war message. It also sends a message that even though a soldier despises war that somebody has to stand up and fight for what is right.I think that people saying that it did not portray the Viet Nam war accurately are misguided. The war that covert ops and the Green Berets fought was much different than an 18 year old green draftee. Most Green Berets were seasoned veterans and non com's. And depending on the time of the war you are portraying (in this film it is very early in Americas part of the conflict) the war was a different war. Not large scale with those same green troups.Anyway I thought that this movie showed both sides of the conflict and the men stuck in the middle. I thought Jim Huttons performance was very good, as well as Aldo Rays. John Wayne and David Jansen were brilliantly matched as to opposite extremes of a question.
