Schneider,"[16, 16]","I'm a daily exerciser so it is very important for me to A)have workout variety so my muscles don't get used to the same old routine, and B)Must be something I find enjoyable and satisfying.I do many types of workouts, pilates, yoga, step, kickboxing, but dance has a special place in my heart because I grew up taking lessons and I love anything that is dance oriented.  This routine is fun, no doubt.  The routine has body rolls, chest pops and lots of fun moves that keep your heart rate up.  I did both the old school and the sexy sculpt together to make one longer work out and that was just right for me.I felt Sarita Lou did a good job cuing the moves but this is not all about a perfect way to do a move, you take the base move and you add in your own flavor, so it is not important that you do it ""exactly"" like she does it, just learn the move and then add your own style to it...that is what dance is all about.  The less uptight you are the better. Just go with your body and have a good time.The workout is comprised of a 7 minute warmup, two workouts of approx. 20 minutes and a 5 minute cooldown.  I would say this is an intermediate workout.  A beginner to dance may need a few times to catch the steps, but someone that works out with dance videos or has a background in dance would catch the moves fairly quickly.  I did break a sweat doing the workout and felt much like I would after I had been just out on the dance floor having a good time.I also liked the instructor's style-she is not chirpy, overly enthusiastic, etc.  She looks like she is just having a good time. Her form is good and the stretches at the end felt great.I like this addition to my dance videos and would definitely seek out more videos where she is featured as the instructor.Let yourself go a little and dance in the livingroom....it's good for you and it is a whole lot of fun!",5,Get your butt off the couch and burn some calories the fun way....,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1872,"[""'m"", 'daily', 'exerciser', 'very', 'important', 'A', 'have', 'workout', 'variety', 'muscles', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'used', 'same', 'old', 'routine', 'B', 'Must', 'be', 'something', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'satisfying.I', 'do', 'many', 'types', 'workouts', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'step', 'kickboxing', 'dance', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'grew', 'up', 'taking', 'lessons', 'love', 'anything', 'dance', 'oriented', 'routine', 'fun', 'doubt', 'routine', 'body', 'rolls', 'chest', 'pops', 'lots', 'fun', 'moves', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'did', 'old', 'school', 'sexy', 'sculpt', 'together', 'make', 'one', 'longer', 'work', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'me.I', 'felt', 'Sarita', 'Lou', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'cuing', 'moves', 'not', 'perfect', 'way', 'do', 'move', 'take', 'base', 'move', 'add', 'own', 'flavor', 'not', 'important', 'do', 'exactly', 'just', 'learn', 'move', 'then', 'add', 'own', 'style', 'what', 'dance', 'less', 'uptight', 'are', 'better', 'Just', 'go', 'body', 'have', 'good', 'time.The', 'workout', 'comprised', '7', 'minute', 'warmup', 'two', 'workouts', 'approx', '20', 'minutes', '5', 'minute', 'cooldown', 'would', 'say', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'beginner', 'dance', 'may', 'need', 'few', 'times', 'catch', 'steps', 'someone', 'out', 'dance', 'videos', 'background', 'dance', 'would', 'catch', 'moves', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'did', 'break', 'sweat', 'doing', 'workout', 'felt', 'much', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'just', 'out', 'dance', 'floor', 'having', 'good', 'time.I', 'also', 'liked', 'instructor', 'style-she', 'not', 'chirpy', 'overly', 'enthusiastic', 'etc', 'just', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'form', 'good', 'stretches', 'end', 'felt', 'great.I', 'addition', 'dance', 'videos', 'would', 'definitely', 'seek', 'out', 'more', 'videos', 'where', 'featured', 'instructor.Let', 'go', 'little', 'dance', 'livingroom', '.it', 'good', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun']",DANCE AND BE FIT: HIP HOP CARDIO

You will have a basic, key move and you will return to that move once you add on.  OLD SCHOOL seemed to focus on the lower body with deep plies, sliding, and hops among others.  There are moves that are based on the single, single, double beat, which Sarita failed to cue us on.  She did cue us in SEXY SCULPT, though.  In OLD SCHOOL, Sarita didn't really focus on the arms, not until SEXY SCULPT. SEXY SCULPT includes body rolls, squats, step it out plies, et al.  Overall, the music was appropriate in helping with rhythm and the dance steps, the choreography was generally easy to follow,  uncomplicated, and fun to do.
