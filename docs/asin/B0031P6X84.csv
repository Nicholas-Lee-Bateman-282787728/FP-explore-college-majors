As in many of the better Hong Kong crime thrillers, this has some clever turns and some nifty scenes. But this had a couple of plot points that wouldn't allow me to suspend my disbelief. They didn't kill it for me but it did hurt the movie a bit.An innocent family of four is assassinated by some hit guys. Hubby is Asian. Mommy is French. Mom's dad comes from France to hire some guys to exact vengeance on the bad dudes. This is where it starts to get sticky. Instead of devising some clever way in which pops manages to locate some other hit guys to help him in his plight, he just happens to find them as they are finishing a hit in the hotel he happens to be staying at. Jeezo Peezo Batman! What are the chances!? That's probably the worst of it but there are a few other similar things that happen throughout.This is very good though. What works is how a bond begins to grow between Frenchy and the three Chinese hit men. He cooks for them and they talk over food and wine. They get to know one another and a mutual respect grows. As the odds mount against them there is little question they are there for each other.This is headed by some veteran Hon Kong Actors. Simon Yam, Suet Lam, Anthony Wong all do a decent job. The cinematography, action choreography and music are all stand up. I was a bit bothered by the fact that, in the big shoot out scene, To felt the need to put all the bad guys in dark rain slickers. Was he afraid we couldn't tell the difference? And, as always, the bad guys can't shoot as well as the good guys. But these are small quibbles.

1317282,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0031P6X84,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[18, 21]","Hong Kong auteur Johnnie To is back and this time he's gone international--heck, this film even competed at Cannes!  ""Vengeance"" is a co-production with France and utilizes French, Chinese, and English as its primary languages.  For fans of To's work, ""Vengeance"" aligns thematically with ""The Mission"" and ""Exiled.""  But no prior familiarity with To is necessary to enjoy the pleasures that ""Vengeance"" has to offer.  Even though the film is staged in an urban setting, it is essentially an existential gunfighter western with one man seeking retribution for an attack on his family.  Moody and contemplative, ""Vengeance"" is not a non-stop action picture but rather a thoughtful meditation on honor, loyalty, and mortality.As ""Vengeance"" opens, a family of four is gunned down at their residence in Macau.  As the wife clings to life, her father (French rock star Johnny Hallyday) arrives to provide comfort.  With his craggy face and sullen demeanor, Hallyday recalls a ""Death Wish"" Charles Bronson--and, indeed, it does appear that the film is headed in that direction.  Hallyday, a chef by profession, knows his way around a gun but needs help identifying the culprits responsible.  He conveniently runs across a team of hitmen (doesn't that always happen when you need it?).  Promising them everything he owns, including his restaurant, they join forces and are soon off to Hong Kong to settle the score.  But tracking the killers down is just the first stage as the team on Hallyday's payroll unravel some unexpected connections.To has reassembled many familiar faces from his previous films--I particularly liked Anthony Wong, Lam Kar Tung and Lam Suet as the trio working with Hallyday.  A real relationship develops within the team and this, to me, is one of the stronger elements in ""Vengeance.""  There are several finely staged, if somewhat familiar, shoot-outs.  A sequence in the park is orchestrated with precision and artistry while the finale is both loopy and surprisingly poignant.  One of the more unusual aspects of ""Vengeance"" is a condition (which I won't reveal) that Hallyday must cope with--but it is done well and really highlights a number of interesting philosophical questions about the nature of revenge.  There is a complex and adult subtext within this genre picture about responsibility, what we owe to others and ourselves.  ""Vengeance"" may not be the film you are expecting from its title and set-up, there is an underlying sorrow and a depth that is quite unexpected.  Give it a try.

Unexpected twists, comic turns, and surprisingly poignant moments, combine with Hong Kong director Johnnie To's stunning visual style to set this story apart from the conventional crime thriller.  Johnnie To always tweaks genre expectations, and here he infuses strong elements of the Western genre into the urban settings of Hong Kong and Macau.  A scene of darkened gunplay in a moonlit forest is one of the most visually thrilling and intense I've seen in a very long time.  While all the performances were memorable, Johnny Hallyday, with his enigmatic leathery face and penetratingly blue eyes, is perfectly cast as a quiet man coping with an increasingly apparent disability, but dead set on revenge.

Costello's daughter barely survives a brutal attack in her house in Macau, but her husband and 2 small children do not. Costello, a restaurant owner in Paris, immediately comes to Macau and in the hospital, his daughter begs him to ""revenge me"". Costello eventually hooks up with/hires three local hit men, and the search is on for the killers. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, the plot is pretty much secondary to the action in the movie. Hong Kong director Johnnie To brings the movie in a very stylish and visually catchy framework. Check out the gorgeous scenery of Macau (in the first half of the movie) and Hong Kong (later in the movie). Second, the performance from now old and grizzled Johnny Hallyday is outstanding. I realize that he is hardly known outside his native France and some other French-speaking regions in the worl such as Quebec and Belgium, but that guy is LEGENDARY, and he is still bringing it well into his sixties.Bottom line: this is a violent (and hence, viewe beware) but stylish crime drama from Hong Kong.

Once I peeked at some of it, I couldn't stop watching. This is full blown Johnnie To. After Costello's (Johnny Hallyday) daughter is almost murdered by triad gangsters who kill her family, he seeks revenge. The French chef with murder skills of his own hires three hitmen (Anthony Wong, Lam Ka Tung, and Lam Suet) to help him tackle mob boss George Fung (Simon Yam) and his team of expert killers. A friendship develops between the fab four as visions of Memento, Charles Bronson's Death Wish Series, All of Clint Eastwood's Westerns and some of To's films come to mind. You'll especially be reminded of The Mission and Exiled during the shootouts but that's okay. Vengeance is simply a great guy flick and pure heaven for Johnnie To fanatics like me. I get goosebumps every time I see Anthony Wong with trademark sunglasses, a cigarette in his mouth, and a gun in his hand. I also enjoyed the way English, French, and Cantonese languages are spoken together throughout the film. This really adds to it's international flavor. I had plenty of heated moments with Vengeance and look forward to repeated viewings of this instant classic. Now, I'd like to see Johnnie To and John Woo hook something new up with Chow Yun Fat, Andy Lau, Lau Ching Wan and all of To's players.
