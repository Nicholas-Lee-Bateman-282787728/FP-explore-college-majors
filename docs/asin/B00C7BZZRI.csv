A fascinating premise seemed to lose steam as the movie progressed and became more and more convoluted. I felt it strayed way off base when Elizabeth wanted her piece of the action from the heisters. To me that was unrealistic. How could a professional woman get the drop on hardened criminals? Well that question is answered by the end of the movie. Unfortunately how we get to that point is where things seemed to go awry.I was originally going to give this movie a Two oe Three-Star review. I changed my mind when I realized how solid the performances were. A major quibble I have had with the movie is I felt it did not deal enough with the stolen painting itself. Too, how could a corpse lie in the back of a trunk in a metropolis like London nad not be discovered (Smelt)? That being said, I believe this is a movie that needs to be seen twice or thrice in order to be understood.Rosario Dawson and James McAvoy do a remarkable job in their roles. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Dawson is the most underrated actress in Hollywood. I really wish she would get meatier roles. I've been a fan of hers since Spike Lee's 1998 film called He Got Game. Dawson could be the next Meryl Streep. She's that great of an actress! As Elizabeth she mesmerises the baddies in this movie with her brains shows the power of the mind of a resourceful woman. Elizabeth is not above using her feminine wiles to conquor the hapless lads. In the end we find out just how calculating and manipulative she is.I give this movie Three and a Half Stars. A more solid script would have had me rate it much higher.A.

1643440,A28G7IGU6WHYV,B00C7BZZRI,Bookwyrm,"[0, 0]","This is an engaging movie.  The acting is brilliant, the plot is complicated, and the effects are attractive.  The psychological twists do leave you wondering what is real and what is not, but the story isn't too hard to follow IMHO.  The twists are unpredictable (save for the fact that the nature of the story lets you know there WILL be twists) and intriguing.Spoiler alert!So why only three stars?  Because the characters are TERRIBLE people.  Don't get me wrong, the actors did a fantastic job.  They are supposed to be terrible people.  At the beginning of the film, I liked some of them and distrusted others (as was appropriate for the plot line).  I found James McAvoy's hapless Simon to be particularly endearing.  But as the film progresses and secrets are revealed, you find out those people who seemed to be the 'good guys' aren't so good.  In fact, they aren't good AT ALL.  And I'm not talking about relatively normal people having a dark side or character flaws.  They are just bad people.  By the end of the film, I didn't really like any of them, which it made me hard to care about what happened to any of them.  The last scene of the film involves my two least favorite characters (by that point) having what I guess is supposed to be a sweet, romantic moment--but it really rang sour for me because I'd been rooting against them.But that might not bother some viewers.  I was raised on a steady Hollywood diet of heroes and happy endings, but I know some people prefer darker characters and darker stories.  If that's you, Trance might be just the movie for you.Update:The film stuck with me, I'll give it that.  I wrote the initial review right after watching the film, but I've continued to think about it in the days since.  The more I think about it, the sorrier I feel for McAvoy's Simon and the less I like Dawson's Elizabeth.  The film now feels more a tragedy with a psychological aspect than a thriller for me so, again, if you like dark tragedies, I recommend this film.

1643442,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00C7BZZRI,Brian Driver,"[3, 6]","I had a tough time deciding whether to give three or four stars to this one...TRANCE is one of those movies I will have to watch at least once more before I truly BEGIN get a handle on it.  I'll tell you this: every time you think you've know where this movie is going it knocks you right on your butt.  It's as twisty and slick a movie as I've seen in quite a while, and I'm not sure that's always good.  Entertaining, yes...but good cinema?  Let's wait until I get that one last look.As for now, suffice it to say that this is a movie that begins fast and then seldom takes its foot off the throttle.  Art house auctioneer Simon (James McAvoy) is in charge of securing Goya's ""Witches in the Air"" when the alarm goes off: they're being robbed.  Though repeatedly warned to let the thieves have their way - ""No painting is worth your life,"" they say - Simon steps in the way of one burglar and gets hit hard on the forehead for his effort.  He's a bloody mess, and that's only the beginning of it: as he wakes up and staggers away he gets hit by a car.  And that's not all...when the thieves realize the bag containing the framed painting is absent one canvas, they kidnap him and begin a series of exquisitely horrible torture methods to force the painting's location out of him.The only problem is Simon's initial head injury was so serious that he's developed amnesia, and a top flight and - natch - extremely sexy psychologist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) is brought in to tackle it.  But she's a sharp cookie and quickly realizes she might be able to make a little more than her flat fee if she strikes a deal with the burglars - that is, especially with their boss, Frank (Vincent Cassel), who may or may not be a boob. And it is from here on in that, as the saying goes, mayhem ensues.And that was the straightforward part.  The problem here is that it's a Danny Boyle film, so it's all Zip Zap Kerflammy quick editing, and it's almost impossible to get your footing. It's entertaining and extremely watchable, but the problem is that it's very hard to believe what you're seeing. There are times you'll see characters die, but then they're back again the next scene. Or the painting's found, but then it's actually a body. Relationships may or may not exist between two characters, and assumptions made about this person or that person are just as well likely to be true as they are likely to be false: this is a PSYCHOLOGICAL movie, you see, and the mind plays funny tricks.  And just when you are about to cry foul, you realize that it's not reality that's changed, but only the character's perception of it.It's a tricky movie, slickly shot and edited and patched together, but it is an altogether watchable movie....just don't expect to know what's going on all the time.  I wasn't even really sure who the protagonist was after a while: the movie's change of perceptions allows for at least three different characters to wear that crown.  The problem is there is really no one to root for in this movie...they're all one variation or another of creepy, and no one here is admirable.  I heard one critic call it a nihilistic movie, and the term fits: there is really nothing here to ""value"" other than being the character to come out on top.  There is no evidence of any real morality, and not a shred of a code of ethics...unless one's ethics consists of being the last one standing with the painting.Like I said, I'll reserve final judgement for my next and perhaps final viewing.  For all of my nattering negativism, the movie is slick and fun to watch.  And it has an ending that I am sure many will dislike, but I thought was entirely appropriate, given the last one hundred minutes.But as for right now...hand on my heart, I'll tell you this: you could do a lot worse than watch this film: it is fun, fast, and a total mind fracture.  I enjoyed it...

I really did like it and I agree with the 3 and half stars amazon currently rates it. It is a great idea for a plot *spoilers* bf/ gf problem and the gf just happens to have the power of hypnosis and uses it to her advantage. The movie was very action packed, filled with complex twists and turns that not only kept me emotionally and mentally captivated but also was very entertaining. The actors were great, the directing was great, plot was great. The movie actually reminded me a bit like inception and those type of movies (ex. vanilla sky). There's also some huge advantages like Rosario dawson being nude (no idea her breasts were so big). After the movie ended I waited for the credits to be over because I kept thinking there was going to be some kind of twist ending or something as in some movies they have something after the credits. But nope nothing. I felt the ending was more than a little disappointing. I like how they unraveled everything. But I was left feeling like james mcavoy's character was the good guy and got screwed. They are basically saying the ends justifies the means and 2 wrongs= a right. I myself enjoyed the movie but would have more if it was a positive/semi positive message. I actually though that she was james and Rosario were playing the criminals or Rosario had them all hypnotized. They could have written the ending so many different ways but again was let down. So turns out james killed a girl he thought was his ex they drive somewhere and she conveniently runs him down while pushing the car conveniently into the river. Come on do something awesome like she yells strawberry and it was just a session trying to find his car keys or something. Or maybe she could have programmed some word for James to shoot himself or whatever but no they had her run him down ...... Where's the creativity ? wheres the rewrites haha. It's amazing how many movies I loved but the end ruins it for me. But that is just what I personally wanted. All in all. Most people should find it entertaining and &#34;spell binding,&#34; as it pertains to intriguing the mind. Very exciting and I applaud the good writing(until the ending), actors, and directing. Most people should find themselves enjoying the movie. Thanks for reading.

When his auction house comes under attack by Franck (Vincent Cassel) and his henchmen, Simon is struck in the head and forgets the location of the painting. After Simon's release from the hospital, Franck is determined to jog his memory - taking him to a professional hypnotist (Rosario Dawson) to recover the painting.Thoughts: This film is quintessential Danny Boyle - break neck pace, stirring visuals, frenetic style at times and brimming with ambition. The film's story is layered with hypnotic sequences which overlap with real sequences. At times, the film can be a bit murky and confusion, mirroring Simon's own state of confusion after the attack - as the layers of hypnotism take their toll we, the viewer, is left wondering what, if anything, is real and if Simon is being manipulated or simply losing his mind. When the final act begins, the ""reveal"" flips the entire story on its head - changing our perspective but informing the entire journey up to that point.Should you buy this film: Are you a fan of any of Boyle's previous films?

All made almost unwatchable due to the fact that none of the characters proves likable&#8212;so who cares what happens to them?We began Trance believing that the lead character will be some kind of a hero, but he proves the worst of the worst.  As a person, he is a gambling addict and an abusive boyfriend.  As a thief, he has absolutely no honor and an almost maniacal desire to destroy everyone around him in the most vicious possible way. The hypnotist as a woman-wronged-getting-revenge, well, if she can make everything all right with the acquisition of a painting, that really says it all.  The subject of the painting--witches --is meaningful.  If this film was for real, hypnotists would be ruling the world.This film really could have been so much more than it is.  Boyle is proving that he loves blind, senseless violence.  Which generally seems to be a growing trend in Film;  all these huge, visually gorgeous, movies with what really should be called &#8220;torture&#8221; scenes&#8212;where the level of sheer brutality really isn&#8217;t warranted.  Think of the bathroom scene in Red Lights. After you&#8217;ve knocked a guy down once, twice, twenty times&#8212;do you need to completely bash his brains in? Or set him on fire?The beginning of Trance was notable in showing how much can happen from just one sharp blow to the head.  The operating room scene really showed the impact of trauma on the human body.  So, why do we need all this unrelenting pummeling?  No one can survive all that and keep walking; and yet, we have all these films where people are smashed to bits and still get up, keep walking and even &#8220;save the day.&#8221;  Is this sort of thing really what makes for great cinema?  One might argue that this sort of violence raises the audience&#8217;s stake in the outcome, as it certainly seems to create a desire for it to all end&#8212;for relief.Some have said that Boyle was going for an Inception effect, but Nolan achieved a grandeur with his film that Boyle&#8217;s movie never touches.  With Inception, Nolan generated several character arcs that genuinely move the viewer.  There is a sense of a nobler purpose at play.  We love the characters despite their flaws, and they are able to surf the waves of violence because Inception has heart. Trance has cujones, sure, but very little heart.With Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle struck a much better balance of darkness and light and gave us a character to cheer for.  There are flickers in Trance.  The choice of centering this film around works of Art was brilliant and the repeated reference to Rembrandt&#8217;s Storm on the Sea of Galilee with the artist&#8217;s cameo appearance, was a deft touch&#8212;you can feel a lot of play with that.  Also, the hypnotic trance scenes are surrealistically intriguing fun. But there is very little fun in the characters, who one by one prove to be rotten at the core.  I mean, come on, Boyle, give us somebody to root for.  And don&#8217;t expect us to forgive you if you don&#8217;t, just because everything looks amazing and there&#8217;s a nice soundtrack.By the end of this film, and I only kept watching to see how Boyle would pull this maelstrom to conclusion, I didn&#8217;t like anyone and I really didn&#8217;t care what happened to any of them.  Except maybe Franck.  Though he had seemed like such a bastard at the film&#8217;s commencement, he was coming from behind in the homestretch.  Give that character another film, who knows, he might prove a hero.",3,Unlikable characters adrift in a maelstrom of violence (contains spoilers),1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,3805,"['beginning', 'film', 'what', 'see', 'extended', 'preview', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'pace', 'everything', 'was', 'hooked', 'rented', 'film', 'What', 'let', 'down', 'can', 'use', 'expression', 'was', 'little', '8220', '8221', 'Just', 'one', 'audio-visual', 'assault', 'made', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'due', 'fact', 'none', 'characters', 'likable', '8212', 'who', 'what', 'began', 'Trance', 'believing', 'lead', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'kind', 'hero', 'worst', 'worst', 'person', 'gambling', 'addict', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'thief', 'absolutely', 'honor', 'almost', 'maniacal', 'desire', 'destroy', 'everyone', 'most', 'vicious', 'possible', 'way', 'hypnotist', 'woman-wronged-getting-revenge', 'well', 'can', 'make', 'everything', 'right', 'acquisition', 'painting', 'really', 'subject', 'painting', 'witches', 'meaningful', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'hypnotists', 'would', 'be', 'ruling', 'world.This', 'film', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Boyle', 'proving', 'blind', 'senseless', 'violence', 'Which', 'generally', 'be', 'growing', 'trend', 'Film', 'huge', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'movies', 'what', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'called', '8220', 'torture', '8221', 'scenes', '8212', 'where', 'level', 'sheer', 'brutality', 'really', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'warranted', 'Think', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'Red', 'Lights', '8217', 've', 'knocked', 'guy', 'down', 'once', 'twice', 'twenty', 'times', '8212', 'do', 'need', 'completely', 'bash', 'brains', 'set', 'fire', 'beginning', 'Trance', 'was', 'notable', 'showing', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'happen', 'just', 'one', 'sharp', 'blow', 'head', 'operating', 'room', 'scene', 'really', 'showed', 'impact', 'trauma', 'human', 'body', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'unrelenting', 'pummeling', 'one', 'can', 'survive', 'keep', 'walking', 'yet', 'have', 'films', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'smashed', 'bits', 'still', 'get', 'up', 'keep', 'walking', 'even', '8220', 'save', 'day.', '8221', 'sort', 'thing', 'really', 'what', 'great', 'cinema', 'One', 'might', 'argue', 'sort', 'violence', 'audience', '8217', 's', 'stake', 'outcome', 'certainly', 'create', 'desire', 'end', '8212', 'relief.Some', 'have', 'said', 'Boyle', 'was', 'going', 'Inception', 'effect', 'Nolan', 'achieved', 'grandeur', 'film', 'Boyle', '8217', 'movie', 'never', 'touches', 'Inception', 'Nolan', 'generated', 'several', 'character', 'arcs', 'genuinely', 'move', 'viewer', 'sense', 'nobler', 'purpose', 'play', 'love', 'characters', 'flaws', 'are', 'able', 'surf', 'waves', 'violence', 'Inception', 'heart', 'Trance', 'cujones', 'sure', 'very', 'little', 'heart.With', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Boyle', 'struck', 'much', 'better', 'balance', 'darkness', 'light', 'gave', 'character', 'cheer', 'are', 'flickers', 'Trance', 'choice', 'centering', 'film', 'works', 'Art', 'was', 'brilliant', 'repeated', 'reference', 'Rembrandt', '8217', 'Storm', 'Sea', 'Galilee', 'artist', '8217', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'was', 'deft', 'touch', '8212', 'can', 'feel', 'lot', 'play', 'Also', 'hypnotic', 'trance', 'scenes', 'are', 'surrealistically', 'intriguing', 'fun', 'very', 'little', 'fun', 'characters', 'who', 'one', 'one', 'prove', 'be', 'rotten', 'core', 'mean', 'come', 'Boyle', 'give', 'somebody', 'root', 'don', '8217', 'expect', 'forgive', 'don', '8217', 'just', 'everything', 'looks', 'amazing', '8217', 's', 'nice', 'soundtrack.By', 'end', 'film', 'only', 'kept', 'watching', 'see', 'how', 'Boyle', 'would', 'pull', 'maelstrom', 'conclusion', 'didn', '8217', 'anyone', 'really', 'didn', '8217', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'maybe', 'Franck', 'had', 'seemed', 'bastard', 'film', '8217', 'commencement', 'was', 'coming', 'homestretch', 'Give', 'character', 'film', 'who', 'might', 'prove', 'hero']",Trance
1643470,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00C7BZZRI,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Danny Boyle (director of 127 Hours, Slumdog Millionaire, Sunshine, Millions, 128 Days Later..., A Life Less Ordinary and Trainspotting) comes up again with a mind-bending, action packed, kaleidoscopic vision of how the mind can be altered/twisted/confused/bent by hypnosis to create out of body experiences that provide clues and solutions to a story of a heist (and love affair) gone wrong. In many ways the film assaults the senses, but the story is so well crafted that it defies rational explanation until the very end.The setting is London and we are introduced to the fine art of fine art auctions by one Simon Newton (James McAvoy, fully immersed in his native Scottish brogue). Simon teams up with gangster Franck (Vincent Cassel) and his gang (Danny Sapani, Matt Cross, and Wahab Sheikh) in the heist of a valuable Goya painting from the auction house where he works. In the getaway, Simon does not deliver the painting (as so carefully planned) to Franck: Franck hits Simon's head and takes his package. Then Franck discovers that the painting is not in the package and he abducts Simon and tortures him with his gang in an attempt to discover where the painting is. Eventually it becomes evident that Simon's concussion caused amnesia and Franck decides to hire a hypnotherapist to help him to remember where he hid the painting. Franck shows a directory to Simon and he selects the American hypnotherapist Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) and they have a hypnosis session. Soon Elizabeth contacts Franck and tells him that she wants to be their partner and receive her share of the painting. The creative thinking Elizabeth has sex with Franck and she tells Franck that Simon is obsessed with her. She also tells him that she believes that he may recall where the painting is if she has sex with Simon. Elizabeth has sex with Simon and hypnotizes him into the beginning of his blurred journey between reality and daydream: `The choice is yours. Do you want to remember or do you want to forget?'Written by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge the plot is a blur of reality and delusions mixed to a fare-thee-well by Boyle and his cast. Though this is one of Rosario Dawson's better roles, the role of Elizabeth would have been better served by a more subtle actress who could have added another dimension of credibility to this wildly hallucinogenic crime caper. The others in the small cast are excellent. This is an art house movie bumped up to the big screen concept. It requires a lot of thinking from the audience in order for all the twists and turns to fall into place in this immensely entertaining puzzle of mind manipulation Grady Harp, July 13",4,`No piece of art is worth a human life.',1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2655,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'director', '127', 'Hours', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Sunshine', 'Millions', '128', 'Days', 'Later', 'Life', 'Less', 'Ordinary', 'Trainspotting', 'up', 'again', 'mind-bending', 'action', 'packed', 'kaleidoscopic', 'vision', 'how', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'altered/twisted/confused/bent', 'hypnosis', 'create', 'body', 'experiences', 'provide', 'clues', 'solutions', 'story', 'heist', 'love', 'affair', 'gone', 'wrong', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'senses', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'rational', 'explanation', 'very', 'end.The', 'setting', 'London', 'are', 'introduced', 'fine', 'art', 'fine', 'art', 'auctions', 'one', 'Simon', 'Newton', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'fully', 'immersed', 'native', 'Scottish', 'brogue', 'Simon', 'up', 'gangster', 'Franck', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'gang', 'Danny', 'Sapani', 'Matt', 'Cross', 'Wahab', 'Sheikh', 'heist', 'valuable', 'Goya', 'painting', 'auction', 'house', 'where', 'getaway', 'Simon', 'not', 'deliver', 'painting', 'so', 'carefully', 'planned', 'Franck', 'Franck', 'Simon', 'head', 'package', 'Then', 'Franck', 'discovers', 'painting', 'not', 'package', 'Simon', 'gang', 'attempt', 'discover', 'where', 'painting', 'Eventually', 'evident', 'Simon', 'concussion', 'caused', 'amnesia', 'Franck', 'hire', 'hypnotherapist', 'help', 'remember', 'where', 'painting', 'Franck', 'directory', 'Simon', 'American', 'hypnotherapist', 'Elizabeth', 'Lamb', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'have', 'hypnosis', 'session', 'Soon', 'Elizabeth', 'Franck', 'be', 'partner', 'receive', 'share', 'painting', 'creative', 'thinking', 'Elizabeth', 'sex', 'Franck', 'Franck', 'Simon', 'obsessed', 'also', 'may', 'recall', 'where', 'painting', 'sex', 'Simon', 'Elizabeth', 'sex', 'Simon', 'beginning', 'blurred', 'journey', 'reality', 'daydream', 'choice', 'yours', 'Do', 'want', 'remember', 'do', 'want', 'forget', ""'Written"", 'Joe', 'Ahearne', 'John', 'Hodge', 'plot', 'blur', 'reality', 'delusions', 'mixed', 'fare-thee-well', 'Boyle', 'cast', 'one', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'better', 'roles', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'more', 'subtle', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'dimension', 'credibility', 'wildly', 'hallucinogenic', 'crime', 'caper', 'others', 'small', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'art', 'house', 'movie', 'bumped', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'concept', 'lot', 'thinking', 'audience', 'order', 'twists', 'fall', 'place', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'puzzle', 'mind', 'manipulation', 'Grady', 'Harp', 'July', '13']",Trance

The rest of the movie was pure drek.  SLIGHT SPOILERS! Between the science of hypnosis being COMPLETELY misrepresented and used as a blanket excuse for plot holes, the characters all being deplorable sociopaths, and the ending asking us to forgive every evil deed and walk away with a whimsical sense of flirtatious mystery simply because of the gender of the one character, this is the first movie in a while that I was genuinely enraged by. Here is a test I apply occasionally to movies to see if I am being pandered to: If you reverse the gender of every major character and change nothing else, would the protagonist still be a hero or just be a self-serving monster? In this case...monster. And there was ZERO reason for the graphic nature of the nudity in this movie. Now, I don't care if you include some nudity in your movie as long as it serves the story, and in this case the nudity is mostly in service of the story, BUT when you make the scenes so blatant and graphic that it comes across as an EXCUSE to show graphic nudity, you go way past artistic expression and wind up right back on the level of a 70s exploitation film.This was a truly awful movie with no sense of itself that thought it was smarter and bigger than it was. it comes across as though written by an immature film student with social issues and fetishistic tendencies and no sense of restraint.

Everything else has left me pretty cold in one way or another. His films tend to teeter on the precipice of stylized pretentiousness and overblown self-importance. But after a triumpth like 127 HOURS, it was hard for me to pass up another effort from Boyle.TRANCE, at its very best, kept reminding me of better films thematically, such as Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION and some of the different works of David Cronenberg, such as eXistenZ, SPIDER and even NAKED LUNCH. James Mcavoy essentially plays Ewan McGregor 2.0 here as Simon, a cocky auctioneer at a prestigious London art gallery who is involved in a heist of a multi-million dollar painting, but because of a head injury he suffers at the hands of the ""villain"" of the piece, Franck (a terrific Vincent Cassel), he can't remember where he hid the painting. He goes to a hypno-therapist (the talented and lovely Rosario Dawson), who Simon and Franck believe to have the key to discovering where the painting is. As the film progresses, though, it becomes harder and harder to distinguish between reality and imagination as implanted memories and suggestions begin to swerve through Simon's mind until it comes to an ultimate revelation as to exactly who's the real villain.Again, if I hadn't seen a few films like this before, and that were done better, I would have had a better time with this film. Boyle does some fine work here as a storyteller who is determined to screw with the mind of the viewer as much as is possible, but he steps maybe too far over the line and gets tripped up by his own cleverness. Cassel and Dawson are captivating as the brutal thief and the innocent therapist caught in a web of deceit and violence, but as with most of his performances, Mcavoy comes off as the weak link of the cast despite him being trusted to carry the film. Mcavoy is not without charm and his baby face keeps the audience a little off-balance through this film, but he just seems to flounder without stronger performers to keep him afloat (just look at him and Michael Fassbender in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS or him and Keira Knightley or Saorise Ronan in ATONEMENT).TRANCE is a decent enough film, and certainly has some moments that will stay with you... certainly one for the men in the audience, if you get my meaning... but it's a tale often-told and often better.",3,INCEPTION meets Cronenberg for a well-made but totally derivative film.,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2447,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'stating', 'only', 'film', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'ever', 'made', ""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', '127', 'HOURS', 'Everything', 'else', 'left', 'pretty', 'cold', 'one', 'way', 'films', 'tend', 'teeter', 'precipice', 'stylized', 'pretentiousness', 'overblown', 'self-importance', 'triumpth', '127', 'HOURS', 'was', 'hard', 'pass', 'up', 'effort', 'Boyle.TRANCE', 'very', 'best', 'kept', 'reminding', 'better', 'films', 'thematically', 'such', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'INCEPTION', 'different', 'works', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'such', 'eXistenZ', 'SPIDER', 'even', 'NAKED', 'LUNCH', 'James', 'Mcavoy', 'essentially', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', '2.0', 'here', 'Simon', 'cocky', 'auctioneer', 'prestigious', 'London', 'art', 'gallery', 'who', 'involved', 'heist', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'painting', 'head', 'injury', 'hands', 'villain', 'piece', 'Franck', 'terrific', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'painting', 'hypno-therapist', 'talented', 'lovely', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'who', 'Simon', 'Franck', 'believe', 'have', 'key', 'discovering', 'where', 'painting', 'film', 'though', 'harder', 'harder', 'distinguish', 'reality', 'imagination', 'implanted', 'memories', 'suggestions', 'begin', 'swerve', 'Simon', 'mind', 'ultimate', 'revelation', 'exactly', 'who', 'real', 'villain.Again', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'few', 'films', 'before', 'were', 'done', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'time', 'film', 'Boyle', 'fine', 'work', 'here', 'storyteller', 'who', 'determined', 'screw', 'mind', 'viewer', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'maybe', 'too', 'far', 'line', 'tripped', 'up', 'own', 'cleverness', 'Cassel', 'Dawson', 'are', 'captivating', 'brutal', 'thief', 'innocent', 'therapist', 'caught', 'web', 'deceit', 'violence', 'most', 'performances', 'Mcavoy', 'off', 'weak', 'link', 'cast', 'being', 'trusted', 'carry', 'film', 'Mcavoy', 'not', 'charm', 'baby', 'face', 'audience', 'little', 'off-balance', 'film', 'just', 'flounder', 'stronger', 'performers', 'keep', 'afloat', 'just', 'look', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'X-MEN', 'FIRST', 'CLASS', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'ATONEMENT', '.TRANCE', 'decent', 'enough', 'film', 'certainly', 'moments', 'will', 'stay', 'certainly', 'one', 'men', 'audience', 'get', 'meaning', 'tale', 'often-told', 'often', 'better']",Trance

I think most people much like myself will waver between two opinions--either this movie is needlessly confusing/tedious and the director was just getting off on being clever, or this movie is a fantastic graphic psychological thriller. After having mulled on this for a while though, I've decided that I am in the latter camp.British director Danny Boyle of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Trainspotting"" has created a world that is both paradoxically grounded in a gritty R rated visual, yet is on a whole different dimension when it comes to the plot and sequencing of events. Much like ""Inception,"" ""Trance"" can be interpreted several different ways. The time frame of events, what is actually real, and who is ""telling"" the story are all subject to discussion. Unlike ""Memento"" where the story is clearly told backwards, it's possible that ""Trance"" is not linear either backwards or forwards. But at the same time, it could be. This is both part of the fun, as well as part of the frustration I felt when watching for the first time.I tend to gravitate towards mysteries or plot twists that are shocking due to their relationship to the rest of the story, yet ""Trance"" is different. Its plot twists are not something that you can definitively figure out like a good mystery, nor are they related to the story so much as the very method of filming. There was a point while watching the movie though, where I just accepted the complexities and relaxed into enjoying the stylish and dream like narrative though. Strangely, once I let go of forcing things to make sense--the movie actually picked up and I started really noticing details that helped in my understanding.James McAvoy as the intriguing art auctioneer who comes by a head injury/amnesia, and Rosario Dawson as his hypnotist with ulterior motives absolutely nail their respective roles. Their minute facial expressions and body language are spot on, and really push depth into the script and into their characters. The soundtrack by Rick Smith is appropriately scattered and the electronic edge serves the mood of the movie as well.At the end of the day, this movie really stuck with me despite having seen it a while ago. While it didn't really effect me emotionally, it was mentally interesting enough that I kept going through the events in my head and wanting to discuss my latest theories with my friends. Visually and musically, it's a feast. I would highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy movies like ""Inception"", ""Memento"" or even ""Donnie Darko.""

And Simon is an art house auctioneer. Through his hands passes billions of pounds sterling worth of oil and canvas, pencil and ink, polished stones and ground ancient ceramics. He's the gatekeeper to the treasures of the elite 1%.Unfortunately, he's also an inveterate gambler. Worse, he's lost money he can never hope to pay back to people who aren't the forgiving type.A deal is cut. A plan concocted. And a rare Goya painting worth in excess of 25 million pounds is going to be stolen.Twice.His plan to double-cross his partners goes off with near perfect results; save for one unexpected event. While making for a good show protecting the artwork - he receives a crushing blow to his cranium. Again, not part of the plan. Now suffering brain damage and traumatic amnesia, Simon honestly cannot remember what the plan was, who he was working for, and most critical for his survival - he has no idea what happened to the painting.After several long weeks waiting patiently for him to recover, his criminal partners pick him up with malice in their hearts. Understandably, they want the painting and believe this memory loss to be nothing more than an elaborate scam. And they're more than willing to torture him to death if he doesn't come clean. But it soon becomes clear to the boss, this is no act. Their inside man honestly doesn't remember anything. So a new angle of attack is hatched. They're going to hire a hypno-therapist to literally pull that information out of his wrecked brain.But is this new plan all it seems?A truly enjoyable film. Outstanding performances built on a wonderfully crooked screenplay - creating a twisted tale that will have even the most jaded of viewers guessing to the very end what and where the truth lies.No question at all - 5 Stars.Movie Notes:- The one weakness to the film, from my perspective alone, was casting Rosario Dawson.

It's lightweight by Boyle standards, being more mindbending than thought provoking, but succeeds as an entertainment, and will still spark those conversations in the pub afterwards on what works and what doesn't.It's not a bad thing to go into the movie knowing as little as possible.  Suffice to say it centres on James McAvoy's character Simon, who finds himself at the centre of an art heist.  The thieves headed by Vincent  Cassel soon realise they don't have what they came for and the only person who knows where it is has amnesia - time for hypnotherapist Rosario Dawson to enter the scene.  Thereafter you just have to fasten your seatbelts and stay focussed.In this sort of thriller that relies more on keeping the audience on their toes as to who did what, the actors are critical in selling the premise, and all three leads are convincing here with McAvoy a revelation, and Dawson revealing.  Basked in a neon world it really is hard to tell what is reality sometimes.. Ultimately, how you will feel about Trance will probably depend on where you sit on the `style' versus `substance' debate.  The substance here is fun, but too clever to be a B movie and not smart enough to be a classic.  There's a bit there in the middle where the activity is frantic but somehow the pace of excitement slacks off.. Style wins the day though, as the pace, visuals and music carry you dizzyingly from one scene to the next, until you're as mesmerised as the hypnotees in the movie.  With an ending that will divide opinion, Boyle has added another singular movie to his filmography, which is well worth a watch.  How many movies have full frontal nudity as a key plot point..?

1643517,A8BC52NCCFEWH,B00C7BZZRI,"Spike Owen ""John Rouse Merriott Chard""","[5, 8]","Viewed at the cinema, Trance is sure to be awesome on Blu-ray.Trance is directed by Danny Boyle and adapted to screenplay by John Hodge from Joe Ahearne's film of the same name from 2001. It stars James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson. Music is scored by Rick Smith and cinematography is by Anthony Dod Mantle.Art auctioneer worker Simon (McAvoy) does the double-cross on Franck (Cassel), his partner in an art heist, but after taking a blow to the head suffers amnesia and can't recall where he has hidden a stolen Goya masterpiece. Franck and his thug side-kicks decide to send Simon to hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Dawson) in the hope of unlocking the painting's hiding place. However, once the therapy starts, secrets come tumbling out and nothing is ever as it at first seems.Already this early in the day after the film's release, we know for certain that Danny Boyle's foray into neo-noir is going to split his fan base considerably. Admired for his ability to turn his hand at any genre he fancies, Boyle reaches back to his earlier movies and comes up with a mind bending neo-noir that crackles with the kind of sexual edginess that Paul Verhoeven thrived upon. It sounds snobbish I know, and I have been called a neo-noir snob recently, but if all things noir are not your thing then this really is a film you should stay away from. Think Basic Instinct meets Inception and they take out a 40s Heist movie for drinks and you get an idea where we are at with Trance.All the hallmarks of noir, both neo and conventional classics, are evident here, from characterisations to visual smarts, it's a noir head's dream and very much a must see on the big screen or on Blu-ray formats. Forget any notion of having someone to root for in this, there is scarcely a decent human bone on show. Characters are either fuelled by greed, lust, jealousy or vengeance, or quite simply just not smart enough to operate in the circles they move in. Amnesia is a key component of the story, something which again features a lot in olde noir, as does the central character being a complete dupe...To expand upon more would be stupid of me, the less you know the better it actually is upon first viewing. It really is a difficult film to discuss without delving into why it is such a trippy and deliciously cheeky piece of film. That's not to say that narratively it's smarter than a brain pie, because that's not the case. For as the threads untangle, several times, the mind meld aspect will fall apart if plot dissection is your thing? Also cramming so much ""brain food"" into the last quarter of film kind of feels like too much, overkill if you will. While Franck's side-kick bad boys are irritatingly disposable. Yet it's a film that begs to be seen more than once, twice, thrice even...Visually it's superlative, it's clear that Boyle and Mantle know and admire noir's visual splendours, with an awareness of atmospheric importance (noir is an atmosphere, not a genre. There's the snob in me again!) pulsing throughout. Set in London but filmed out of Dungeness in Kent, the backdrop is a city of steel and mirrors, a thriving city of wealth and mistrust. The tricks of the trade are here but never once is it style over substance, the visual ticks matter to the narrative. Night time overhead shots of a bustling city come and go, different colour tones for different character's apartments are clever, oblique camera angles ensure distortion of frame is equal to distortion of antagonists/protagonists minds (whose trance is this, really?...). Smudgey silhouettes through bronze glass, outrageous POV shots and caressing camera shots of the human form, no shot is wasted in the name of adding detail. Rest assured, Boyle brings his ""A"" game here. All of which is covered over by Smith's slow rumbling score that acts as a foreboding observer ready to unleash itself when the carnage begins.The three principal actors come out firing and clearly are enjoying themselves. McAvoy cements his ""A"" list credentials with a multi layered performance, Cassel is as usual a mighty presence and Dawson, in a bold role, does her best work so far and hints she's ready to move into the big league. While it has to be noted that all three actors have to play their cards very close to their chests throughout; and do so admirably. Boyle's action construction is kinetic, with the pre-credits sequence one of the best opening sequences lately, and Hodge's script has a playfulness about it that ensures those paying attention know the film is self-mocking and not taking itself half as seriously as some film fans seem to think. An audience splitter it is sure to be, but for those with a bent for noirish sexy mind bending heist capers?

1643527,A29EREHE2HKK12,B00C7BZZRI,TheProphetFromTrailopen.com,"[3, 4]","Unlike Mullholland Drive or Momento, there is a ultimately only a metaphorical logic here to rely on - at least most certainly in the conclusion with Vincent Cassel's character. If the painting is where it is, certain events must have taken place, yet there is this dream awakening of this same real character in his swimming pool. I'll forgive the film that, if for no other reason the last 60 seconds of the film are unexpected and brilliant. Regarding a certain dichotomy here of 'non-linear logic' versus creative metaphor, this is Dylanesque (as in ""Under the Red Sky""); where disparate points of view are made with no connectivity; perhaps an impressionist painting is more what it is...Vincent Cassel is awesome; upping his presence from Black Swan and too small a role in the CG Jung movie. He portrays a bad-guy who does what he has to - and not with a heart-of-gold, but with a growing admiration for Dawson's character, which meets its ultimate test at the end of the movie. James McAvoy is equally brilliant, totally drawing you into what you think he is, till a darker side begins to be shown in a really unique manner. McAvoy plays his character with such boyish appeal in the first ten minutes that you VERY QUICKLY find yourself lost and glued in an GREAT opening 15 minutes and in the ""spell"" of a master story-teller. McAvoy's reaction when - under hypnosis - he finds himself seeing all the stolen paintings brought tears to this viewer, especially as he cries out to see the masterpiece by Rembrandt. Great stuff. Rosario Dawson is fantastic and proves you dont have to create the usual Hollywood behaviors to accomplish a truly sexy, mysterious and intelligent female character.The twists and turns are quick, intelligent and creative; the cinematography and direction of one scene after another were in many cases so well thought-out; even to a small part of the opening, when the thieves are about to see what they got, the scene opens in blur, and quickly sharpens. These kind of metaphors are delightfully mixed in with dream symbolisms and a creative juice that (with the exception of a rape-scene), never sold-out for the quick and easy solution; opting for a rather intriguing climax. While the power of hypnotism may be debated, the central theme of facing oneself; ie. not 'forgetting, repressing, etc' is as new as HS Sullivan 1930's bringing schizophrenics into recovery through 'moments of illumination' or expressed 2000 years ago with ""The Truth Shall Set You Free."" The ending drives this home perfectly in a more personal way.BIG SPOILER ALERT: Three members of the group silently agree to a rape of the therapist. This act was very surprising as there is absolutely no foreshadowing that these characters, who are about to retrieve a $40,000,000 painting which will make them all millionaires, would nonchalantly agree to rape the woman most responsible for helping them get the painting. It strikes me as a last minute add-on by the movie-makers. They could have offered foreshadowing of the characters lusting after her, with additional jealousy as Cassel's character has sex with her - which would have been useful. They regard the rape with the same aplomb they would ordering a pizza. This did not seem real at all. They needed a way for these characters to be killed, and the movie-makers took an easy way out, looking amateurish in the process.A couple of technical blunders also annoyed me. Director Danny Boyle is of an age of people who dont readily adapt their thinking to the computer age. I have a degree in Info Technology but most high-school kids could school this very creative Director in these matters here: When the robbery was going on, one hood smashes the monitors in the Hi-Tech/Information Services Security Room. Since the goal of the hood is to apparently somehow disconnect / destroy their security camera apparatus, smashing monitors certainly wont destroy the data one bit, nor will bashing in a single CPU (as he does), as even your local drugstore with the sign saying ""Video Surveillance"" has a redundant off-site connection that is duplicating the digital feed in real-time. A better real-world solution would've been using an electro-magnetic device that will totally zap the hard drive after previously interrupting the off-site backup system; thereby making data recovery impossible; and would have made both the art thieves and the movie-makers appear intelligent rather than ignorant, lazy or arrogant in this regard.I cant help but think Im NOT THE ONLY ONE - during production - who recognized how silly that is, and perhaps the Director is just too aloof to take suggestions? A shoot the messenger kinda guy? Take for example the shotgun Cassel's character carries: This is ridiculous: a full-length solid stock!?!  A folding ""paratrooper"" (or pistol-grip) stock would take an additional 12-16 inches off its length and would have allowed the character to do the intelligent thing: put the shotgun in the same bag the art satchel is placed in. Then you would have avoided the viewer being forced to believe he's carrying a full-length shotgun down a London Street hiding it while walking.It kind of reminded me of Guy Richie in ""Snatch;"" where, after directing a great scene beautifully showing the gangster with his .50 cal Desert Eagle compared to his opponents' ""Replicas,"" Richie goes out of his way to show he's never shot a gun in his life, by having 'Bullet-tooth Tony"" shoot this monster weapon using the ghetto twisted-one-hand style, which amusingly guarantees you'll miss your target and sprain your wrist in the attempt. I have personally shot that weapon and know the kick it has. As someone who's been shooting for 50 years, it's laughably amateurish to shoot any handgun in that ghetto manner, no matter how ""cool"" it may look to some; unless you're a movie director.",5,"Blown

Their perfect plan goes terribly wrong, however, when one of the criminals, who had concealed the painting, lost his memories including the location of where he hid the painting.It&#8217;s a good idea for a crime noir, but when a hypnotherapist enters the story, who attempts to help the amnesiac thief remember what he did, the story gets convoluted more than necessary. Without revealing too much about what follows, I can say that the story involves a love romance or two, and a certain character&#8217;s past.Also, the film shows us how sometimes some people could do things including crimes, for the most implausible reasons. Danny Boyle&#8217;s &#8220;thriller,&#8221; or whatever it is, takes confusion for mystery, and inconsistency for surprise. To bolster the thin storyline, three principal characters played by James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson show their unexpected side. They all sort of change, not out of character development, but simply because the director wants to move on, regardless of the illogicality of their actions.After all, &#8220;Trance&#8221; is a movie directed by Danny Boyle. It has style, and lots of it. I give credit for that. But the rest of the film only shows us that even the great director of &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire&#8221; can do almost nothing with this poorly written material.",2,So Much Ado About Nothing,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,1433,"['gang', 'armed', 'robbers', 'steals', 'precious', 'Goya', 'painting', 'auction', 'house', 'away', 'perfect', 'plan', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'however', 'when', 'one', 'criminals', 'who', 'had', 'concealed', 'painting', 'lost', 'memories', 'including', 'location', 'where', 'painting.It', '8217', 's', 'good', 'idea', 'crime', 'noir', 'when', 'hypnotherapist', 'story', 'who', 'help', 'amnesiac', 'thief', 'remember', 'what', 'did', 'story', 'convoluted', 'more', 'necessary', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'story', 'love', 'romance', 'two', 'certain', 'character', '8217', 's', 'past.Also', 'film', 'how', 'sometimes', 'people', 'could', 'do', 'things', 'including', 'crimes', 'most', 'implausible', 'reasons', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '8217', '8220', 'thriller', '8221', 'whatever', 'confusion', 'mystery', 'inconsistency', 'surprise', 'bolster', 'thin', 'storyline', 'three', 'principal', 'characters', 'played', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'show', 'unexpected', 'side', 'sort', 'change', 'not', 'character', 'development', 'simply', 'director', 'move', 'regardless', 'illogicality', 'actions.After', '8220', 'Trance', '8221', 'movie', 'directed', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'style', 'lots', 'give', 'credit', 'rest', 'film', 'only', 'even', 'great', 'director', '8220', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', '8221', 'can', 'do', 'almost', 'nothing', 'poorly', 'written', 'material']",Trance

It appeared Boyle was going back to his earlier style making something with his visual style present in his earlier works such as Transpotting. Having seen the film, I would say that I found it entertaining, but left me feeling somewhat empty when it was over. The film has a great concept and the first 30 minutes or so is exactly what you'd expect it to be. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill a bit after that. I can't go into exact details without spoiling the film, but lets just say at a certain point you realize the characters actions don't have much effect on anything and the whole film ends up feeling kinda pointless. With that said, Boyle's hyper-visual style gives the viewer enough to keep the viewer entertained and there's always something visually appealing happening on screen to keep you from getting bored.Overall, would I say that I enjoyed Trance? Yes. Did I find it to be disappointing? You bet! But, it's still a film worth watching for it's unique style that Boyle is known so well for.
