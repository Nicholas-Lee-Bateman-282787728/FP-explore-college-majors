It is the WORST Amicus movie of all time3. Its is the WORST film Peter Cushing ever made- although he is still good in it.Amicus have produced some great genre pictures throughout the 60's and 70's. The House the Dripped Blood and City of the Dead are two of my personal favorites. In their hayday Amicus made brilliant films under the direction of many of Englands finest genre directors such as John Moxely and Roy Ward Barker (a Hammer regular).This film isn't fun, isn't entertaining, contains lackluster direction and a 'star' who hams it up and chews through his scenes like a galloping Elephant. Oh, and the 'wolf' is literally a dog with a wig. ""That's allright i bet your thinking. The director was probably clever and shot it with inventive camera angles/clever lighting and edited the film carefully so that you never see too much."" WRONG. It looks like a dog wearing a wig.

The idea of a group of people isolated in a remote mansion is tried and (usually) true. This time, the group is sequestered together so that a man can find out which one of them is the werewolf. Among them are Peter Cushing (THE SKULL, FLESH AND THE FIENDS, HORROR OF DRACULA, etc.), Anton Diffring (CIRCUS OF HORRORS, THE MAN WHO CHEATED DEATH), Charles Gray (ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, THE LEGACY), and Michael Gambon (SLEEPY HOLLOW, HARRY POTTER 3-7), sporting the world's largest sideburns. With this much talent involved, things could / should have turned out better. As it stands, BEAST is mildly entertaining and somewhat engaging.

576939,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B00005ABVT,Chip Kaufmann,"[0, 0]","THE BEAST MUST DIE, despite its rather generic horror film title, is really a rather clever 1970s reworking of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. Big game hunter Tom Newcliffe has hunted every type of game there is. For the ultimate sport (and an untried thrill), he invites a number of people to his large English country estate to hunt down one of them. Why? Because one of them is a werewolf! Included among the guests are a former diplomat (Charles Gray of ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW fame), a reclusive pianist (a young Michael Gambon), and the always reliable Peter Cushing (complete with foreign accent) as a werewolf expert. There's even the also reliable Anton Diffring (CIRCUS OF HORRORS) as a surveillance expert. Top that off with the fact that this is an Amicus production and you have a surprisingly effective old style thriller/mystery/horror film that is more enjoyable than it has any right to be.Amicus had long been Hammer's chief competitor in the British horror field during the 1960s usually specializing in multi-story films like DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS and TALES FROM THE CRYPT. They did occasionally make single story features like I, MONSTER, AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS, and this film. Having just revisited it after a lengthy period of time, I was struck and delighted by how well crafted the film is. The editing is crisp, the photography is atmospheric when it needs to be and the performances are in line with the material. The music is effective for the most part except when it shifts into urban contemporary mode because the lead role of the hunter is played by the Bahamian born African-American actor Calvin Lockhart (COTTON COMES TO HARLEM). SHAFT in England it certainly isn't but that didn't stop the producers from trying to reach out to a younger, more diverse audience.THE BEAST MUST DIE is essentially a gimmick film much like the 1966 CHAMBER OF HORRORS. But instead of a ""Horror Horn"" break, there is a ""Werewolf Break"" where the film stops for a moment to give you the opportunity of guessing the werewolf before it is revealed. This actually didn't bother me as much as it should have because I was having such a good time. Is TBMD a good movie? Depends on how you look at it. There are far worse films even amongst those in the Amicus catalogue (THE MONSTER CLUB or VAULT OF HORROR anyone?). This film works because everyone seems so committed to it and that kind of commitment combined with its old school approach makes BEAST a winner in my book. In fact I'd gladly sit through it again rather than endure most of what passes for horror today. On top of everthing else, the film works as a mystery. A good friend of mine who is quite knowledgeable about horror films failed to correctly guess the identity of the werewolf.

576940,A15PVKTO6JXT26,B00005ABVT,Chris,"[6, 7]","There's something about the great actors and high production values that makes movies like this enjoyable well beyond their used-by date.  You can say what you want about it being dated or silly, but it is still entertaining to watch.  The plot is ludicrous all around, but the actors are all solid and as is often the case, good characters keep the movie alive. The feel is somewhere between a Dr Who episode, an Agatha Christie mystery, the famous Shaft blaxsploitation flick and a traditional Hammer monster movie (I kid you not).  The plot revolves around a collection of strangers held captive in a house on the premise that one of them is a werewolf.  The host and captor is a swanky African guy who looks likes he's in the wrong movie and his wife is either Cleopatra Jones or someone who looks even better.  As others have noted the scenario is a classic Agatha Christie whodunit with the only twist being that one of the suspects is a werewolf rather than a murderer.  The movie includes various chase scenes on foot, by car, 4X4 and helicopter.  There is no substantial gore or horror to speak of and little suspense and overall this is simply a mystery.  Arguably, it is so out of left field that you keep watching to see what will happen next.

576941,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005ABVT,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[22, 27]","From Dark Sky Films comes the DVD release of The Beast Must Die (1974), part of their `The Amicus Collection' DVD series (two other films, so far, include 1973's And Now the Screaming Starts and 1972's Asylum), which I was very excited to see for two reasons, the first being I don't think Amicus has really gotten its due over the years (overshadowed by their competitor Hammer Studios), and the second being my past experiences with Dark Sky Films have been good ones as they seem to put forth an exceptional effort in their DVD releases.  Directed by Paul Annett (""Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected""), the film stars Calvin Lockhart (Uptown Saturday Night,  Predator 2) and Peter Cushing (Twins of Evil, The Creeping Flesh, Star Wars), who frequently appeared in both Amicus and Hammer film releases.  Also appearing is Marlene Clark (Beware! The Blob), Charles Gray (Diamonds Are Forever, The Rocky Horror Picture Show), Ciaran Madden (Swing Kids), Tom Chadbon (Tess), Michael Gambon (Toys, Layer Cake), and Anton Diffring (Circus of Horrors, Fahrenheit 451).Lockhart plays Tom Newcliffe, an obsessive, wealthy big game hunter who invites a small group of individuals under false pretenses to his isolated country estate as he's out for the biggest game of them all, a real live werewolf...you see, Tom believes one of his guests is, in fact, a werewolf, and he's scheduled their stay during time when he knew there'd be a full moon in the hopes that the individual afflicted would transform allowing Tom the hunt of a lifetime.  As the story begins we see some of the precautions Tom's taken in fortifying his estate with security measures including a helicopter, armed guards, hidden cameras and microphones, underground sensors, and so on, all installed and maintained by his security specialist Pavel (Diffring).  After revealing his true intent to his guests (most all, including his wife Caroline, played by Clark, think Tom is a bit nutty) and ensuring none can leave, the fun begins as the full moon rises...sure enough, one of Tom's guests is a werewolf, as evident by a large dog draped in a chintzy fur begins prowling the estate.  Despite Tom's technological edge, he's unable to pin down the beast (or discern which one of the guests has a penchant for howling at the moon), and things get tense as various individuals meet their untimely demise (Pavel makes a new friend).  As the guest list dwindles, Tom gets closer to discerning the real identity of the lycanthrope, but this is definitely one of those occasions where one must be careful what they wish for as the beast seems not only intent on protecting its identity, but its need to consume human flesh seems to be growing to the point where no one is safe...While I did enjoy this film, some elements didn't work out all that well for me, the main one being the mystery portion of the story.  At the beginning of the film a narrator announces this is a detective story and that we, the audience, are responsible for discerning the identity of the beast (near the end there's what's called a `werewolf break', in that the story stops, a clock appears and the audience is instructed to pick whom they believe the beast before it's actually revealed).  The problem was I don't believe there were any actual clues (plenty of misleads, though) that pointed towards one individual over another, so it seemed sort of pointless to expend energy on trying to figure out who the killer was, and better to just let things run their course (which I did).  I wouldn't have commented on this but the film made such a big deal about it up front. Another element that bothered me slightly was the character of Tom.  He was depicted as being a hunter extraordinaire, yet he seemed to have little issue using all kinds of technological hardware to track the beast, which felt like cheating to me...seems to me a certain amount of pride would be involved, and I would think a real hunter would eschew such a huge edge (Tom had the entire estate, including the surround grounds, rigged for sight and sound), instead relying on his own, extensively honed abilities, but given the beast was of the supernatural kind I guess one could make the argument perhaps he viewed using technology as a means to even the playing field (keep in mind I'm not a hunter, so this is speculation on my part).  I guess, in the end, it didn't really matter as all his gadgetry didn't really assist him all that much.  I did learn quite a lot from this film, including the following...1. Hunters seem a tightly wound lot.2. Given a chance a werewolf will eat your eyeball.3. Drinking and archery don't mix.4. You can simulate a werewolf by strapping a chintzy fur on a large dog.5. Paul can't climb a tree for spit.6. For an expert hunter, Tom is an extremely rotten shot.7. Dogs and werewolves (or, at least, dogs wearing fur coats pretending to be werewolves) don't get along.8. Caroline was sure attached to that dog.9. If you need to pad out the running time in your film, an extensive and relatively pointless car chase sequence will certainly help.10. I like hearing Peter Cushing using the word `Transmogrification' in a sentence.11. Tom may have nearly his entire home rigged with video cameras, but he's no voyeur.12. If you ever get invited for a weekend getaway by someone named Tom Newcliffe, it's probably for the best you decline the invitation.As far as the things I liked about the movie, well, the inclusion of Peter Cushing seemed a good idea.  His part may have not been all that much, but I do enjoy seeing him whenever I get a chance.  As far as the rest of the performers, most did well enough although Lockhart seemed a bit overly dramatic at times, even given his character's obvious obsession.  At least he was interesting to watch.  There is no real werewolf, in terms of a beast creature running around on two legs with fangs and claws coming out the wahzoo, but only a dog dressed up to look like a really hairy dog.  I didn't mind this much as the story kept me engaged as once it gets going, it's pretty tight.  There was a little bit of violence and a small amount of blood.  My favorite bit in the film comes after Tom, frustrated with his inability to bag the beast, returns to the house and fires off a round in the main hall, apparently in an effort to draw the attention of his guest, one of whom he's certain is the killer.  As the guest emerge from their rooms, one of them, a somewhat effeminate, snidely artist type named Paul (Chadbon) makes the following off the cuff comment...""It's like living in a shooting gallery.""  All in all a fun film with a few flaws, but if you're an Amicus fan (like me), this is worth getting.The picture on this Dark Sky Films DVD release, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1), looks very clean and the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio comes across well.  Special features include liner notes by Christopher Gullo, a commentary track by director Paul Annett, a still gallery, extensive cast and crew biographies, a thirteen-minute featurette titled `Directing The Beast!', and a trailer for this film along with two others, one for And Now the Screaming Starts (1973), and another for Asylum (1972).Cookieman108Just a note, this film was previously

I just watched And Now The Screaming Starts and Asylum, and loved them. So I was all exited to watch this one. But I was dissapointed.This movie was slow and had no horror atmosphere, and was not creepy or scary in the least. This movie has a '70's action vibe instead, and a '70's action movie score to go along with it, which didn't help make it seem action packed at all. There was a boring car chase scene just to kill time.If you think the premise of this movie sounds good, you may like it. I think that the premise is lame, but I thought it's Amicus and has Peter Cushing, so I'll give it a look. Here is the premise: A passionate hunter wants to hunt and kill a werewolf on his estate, and invites a group of people who all are suspect of being one. All have a shady past, yet the director neglects to play on that, except for two of the guests, Paul Foote and Jan.The hunting scenes were boring. This guy doesn't hunt either, he has people in helecopters and a guy watching closed circuit t.v. tell him where the prey is and is led to it. And he is a terrible shot. He couldn't hit the wolf from a helecopter with a machine gun! This moron just ends up putting everyone else in danger. He is the real monster, and gets his just deserts at the end.I was rooting for the werewolf to kill everyone by the end. I have't been this angry at a movie for a long time.Marlene Clark is terrible and over acts in every scene.The gimmick is The Werewolf Minute.

Who wouldn't adore the idea of a country-house murder mystery with an urban fantasy twist? But sadly most of the genius of this movie is in its concept rather than its execution -- most of it grinds by with tedious slowness, and most of the paper-thin characters are never really explored.Millionaire Tom Newcliffe (Calvin Lockhart) has invited several guests to stay at his remote mansion --  a disgraced diplomat, a pianist, a jet-setter, a sicko artist, and an archaeologist/werewolf expert.  Once they arrive, Newcliffe reveals that he knows one of them is a werewolf (just one? All of them except the archaeologist are suspect!).He plans to wait until the afflicted person transforms at the full moon, and then hunt them down with his rifle. To this end, he has also placed an elaborate security system in and around his house. But when Newcliffe begins tracking a beast through his land, it begins killing people and animals around him -- and unless the others figure out who the wolf is, all of them are going to die.Director Paul Annett seems to have the basic idea behind a country-house murder, but little actual idea how to pull it off -- which is pretty sad, because ""Agatha Christie-style werewolf murder mystery!"" is one of the coolest ideas I've ever heard of. Most of ""The Beast Must Die"" grinds by very slowly, with various people hanging around chitchatting vaguely about werewolves.The movie is at its best when there's action, usually involving Tom running through the woods or zooming through the night in his helicopter. Unfortunately, these scenes don't last nearly long enough -- instead we get a lot of scenes involving the suspects griping and complaining about their host. Also, the werewolf is not exactly frightening -- it looks like a large, cuddly dog, not a ravening eater of human flesh.And the people in this story aren't much better. Lockhart is pretty much the only actor who gets to shine here, as a cultured and intelligent man with a raw steely core. The rest of the cast is either forgettable, or wasted -- Michael Gambon barely says anything, Peter Cushing is reduced to a walking werewolf encyclopedia, and the beautiful Marlene Clark (of ""Ganja and Hess"") just sits around and whines at Lockhart.""The Beast Must Die"" is overflowing with potential, but only the action scenes take advantage of that potential -- the rest is a tepid mess.",2,The ultimate prey,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,2428,"['Honestly', 'wanted', 'love', 'Beast', 'Must', 'Die', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'adore', 'idea', 'country-house', 'murder', 'mystery', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'twist', 'sadly', 'most', 'genius', 'movie', 'concept', 'rather', 'execution', 'most', 'tedious', 'slowness', 'most', 'paper-thin', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'explored.Millionaire', 'Tom', 'Newcliffe', 'Calvin', 'Lockhart', 'invited', 'several', 'guests', 'stay', 'remote', 'mansion', 'disgraced', 'diplomat', 'pianist', 'jet-setter', 'sicko', 'artist', 'archaeologist/werewolf', 'expert', 'arrive', 'Newcliffe', 'one', 'werewolf', 'just', 'one', 'archaeologist', 'are', 'suspect', '.He', 'plans', 'wait', 'afflicted', 'person', 'transforms', 'full', 'moon', 'then', 'hunt', 'down', 'rifle', 'end', 'also', 'placed', 'elaborate', 'security', 'system', 'house', 'when', 'Newcliffe', 'tracking', 'beast', 'land', 'killing', 'people', 'animals', 'others', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'wolf', 'are', 'going', 'die.Director', 'Paul', 'Annett', 'have', 'basic', 'idea', 'country-house', 'murder', 'little', 'actual', 'idea', 'how', 'pull', 'off', 'pretty', 'sad', 'Agatha', 'Christie-style', 'werewolf', 'murder', 'mystery', 'one', 'coolest', 'ideas', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Most', 'Beast', 'Must', 'Die', 'grinds', 'very', 'slowly', 'various', 'people', 'hanging', 'chitchatting', 'vaguely', 'werewolves.The', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'action', 'usually', 'involving', 'Tom', 'running', 'woods', 'zooming', 'night', 'helicopter', 'Unfortunately', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'nearly', 'long', 'enough', 'instead', 'get', 'lot', 'scenes', 'involving', 'suspects', 'griping', 'complaining', 'host', 'Also', 'werewolf', 'not', 'exactly', 'frightening', 'large', 'cuddly', 'dog', 'not', 'ravening', 'eater', 'human', 'flesh.And', 'people', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'Lockhart', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'shine', 'here', 'cultured', 'intelligent', 'man', 'raw', 'steely', 'core', 'rest', 'cast', 'forgettable', 'wasted', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'barely', 'anything', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'reduced', 'walking', 'werewolf', 'encyclopedia', 'beautiful', 'Marlene', 'Clark', 'Ganja', 'Hess', 'just', 'around', 'whines', 'Lockhart', 'Beast', 'Must', 'Die', 'overflowing', 'potential', 'only', 'action', 'scenes', 'take', 'advantage', 'potential', 'rest', 'tepid', 'mess']",N/A

As in her novel ""Ten Little Indians,"" a group of people are lured to a secluded mansion.  This one is surrounded by an electrified fence, patrolled by a helicopter and kept under surveillance by cameras.  All of the guests have been connected to ghastly crimes where victims were torn apart and their flesh consumed.  One of them is suspected of being a werewolf.  The most famous suspect is Dr. Christopher Lundgren (horror icon Peter Cushing) who is an authority on werewolves.  Their host is self-made millionaire Tom Newcliffe (Calvin Lockhart) who, having hunted every animal known to man, is obsessed with killing a werewolf.Dark Sky Films has released an excellent edition of ""The Beast Must Die.""  The pristine picture is presented in its original widescreen theatrical release of 1.78:1.  For the hearing impaired, English subtitles have been provided.  The interview with director Paul Annette and the liner notes inside the DVD keep case provide interesting details on how the film was made.  For example, a real dog, a black Alsatian Wolfhound named Sultan, was used for the werewolf.  Annette had to teach Cushing how to play chess for one of the scenes.  Also, Cushing had just completed filming ""Madhouse"" with Vincent Price before beginning ""The Beast Must Die.""Who is the werewolf?  One by one, the guests are removed from the list of suspects when they are killed by the beast.  There are enough deaths to keep the film moving at a nice pace; however, don't expect a lot of gore.  The viewer will be kept guessing until the bitter end, which provides a delicious twist.  Who will be left alive?

576948,A1MUN0M965UR4O,B00005ABVT,Kooshmeister,"[1, 1]","Somewhere in rural England, a man is running, running for his very life. Everywhere he goes, his movements are tracked by hidden security cameras and a low-flying helicopter, which reports his movements to several armed men driving around in a Land Rover. Stopping, they get out and pursue the fugitive on foot. However, something's not quite right. Each time they catch the man, despite being armed with guns, they let him go. This proceeds for some until the man runs onto the grounds of a palatial mansion, where suddenly the armed men reappear and open fire... and it is then revealed that their guns are loaded with blanks. The man, Tom Newcliffe, is unharmed.Cut to a control room inside the mansion, where a refreshed Tom, now revealed as the wealthy owner of the house and all the land around it, is talking to a Polish man named Pavel.Pavel is an electronics expert and the head of the mansion's security. He has turned the isolated country estate into an impenetrable fortress patrolled by armed guards and helicopters, and overseen by uncountable security cameras and hidden microphones, both inside the house and in the woods outside. There is also an electronic perimeter, which, if crossed, will set off a alarm in the control room. Tom was testing the effectiveness of the system, using himself as bait, and he seems very satisfied.Pavel, though, is slightly in the dark about why his friend wants all this added security. Tom isn't terribly forthcoming about his reasons. Tom, we learn, is a self-made millionaire and ""born hunter"" whose predatory instincts allowed him to claw his way out of the African slum he was born in and earn enough money to move to Miami, Florida, where he had all of his money and met and married his beloved wife, Caroline. He has hunted every kind of animal of every continent around the world, but now he has a new prey in mind. One which he also is confident he'll be doing a service to society in killing. He tells Pavel he'll learn what it is he intends to hunt soon.Sometime later, Tom and Caroline are greeting some guests they've invited out to a weekend get-together. Or, should I say, Tom has invited them. Caroline is suspicious of her husband's motivations, mostly because she's never even heard of half of the people he's invited. But Tom seems to know each of them intimately, having done extensive research on each of them. One by one, he introduces them to Caroline (and us). He explains that each of them has one thing in common: death surrounds them.First up is Arthur Bennington, a former United Nations diplomat. Apparently, he and two others of the diplomatic corps got into a scrape in Africa and the other two turned up dead, horribly mauled. Only Bennington survived. Bennington was exonerated... but fired from his job. He now works as a TV show host (!).Then we have Jan Gilmore and his estranged wife Davina. Jan is a former concert pianist. Once renowned throughout the world, he is persona non grata in certain European countries because every time he was in town to perform, there were grisly murders. He has since stopped playing. Davina Gilmore, a wealthy, jetsetting socialite, has been separated from her husband following some kind of spat between them, but since Jan quit playing, she has come running back to him. According to Tom, though, every time she attends a party, they always come up a guest short.Then there is Paul Foote. A former medical student turned artist, Paul and some friends, while in medical school, once, as a grim lark, ate some flesh from one of the cadavers, leading to their expulsion. Later, during his career as an artist, there was a brutal murder, and one of Paul's paintings just happened to resemble the victim, and he was arrested for the killing, but eventually released for lack of evidence. Paul claims he saw the victim's face in a newspaper photo, but Tom isn't so sure.Lastly, we have Dr. Christopher Lundgren, who is a Swedish archaeologist by trade but whose personal hobby is cryptzoology. In particular - and here, we see why Tom saved him for last - Lundgren is a self-professed expert on werewolves.This shocks the other guests (as well as Pavel, who is listening in from the control room), and Tom explains that he believes without a shadow of a doubt that one of them is a werewolf, and he aims to prove it and slay the monster. The full moon is coming up, he says, and will last for three days, and with all the added security around the house, there is no way the werewolf can escape, and he vows wait until the werewolf's identity is revealed, and then hunt and kill it, after which the remaining, non-lycanthropic guests may leave.Tom's plan seems foolproof. The security system airtight. The guards well-trained. But you know what they say about the best-laid plans. Before the three days are over, the Newcliffe's guest list will be quite a bit shorter...The Beast Must Die is a fine and fun little werewolf film, with some great performances by actors all too familiar to genre fans. We have Peter Cushing as wise and kindly Dr. Lundgren (doing a rather hokey Swedish accent he lapses in and out of), the smarmy, acid-tongued Charles Gray as Bennington, the painfully handsome and soft-spoken Anton Diffring as Pavel, and, years before his turn as Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films, Michael Gambon as Jan Gilmore. There's also Ciaran Madden as Davina, although she's a bit on the wooden side; making up for this where the fairer sex are concerned is the positively gorgeous Marlene Clark as Tom's wife Caroline.But the true standout performances are Calvin Lochart and Tom Chadbon.Calvin Lockhart is probably best known to younger viewers as the voodoo-practicing drug lord King Willie in Predator 2. Here, as Tom Newcliffe, he lords himself over all of the other actors, even stalwarts like Charles Gray and Peter Cushing. Lockhart's delivery is a bit stilted at times, but, nevertheless, his sheer charisma and force of personality make give his Tom an utterly magnetic and engaging screen presence. He's like a modern day Captain Ahab, too, growing more and more crazed and obsessed at figuring out who the werewolf is each time he fails to kill it.And then we have Tom Chadbon, who I knew best as Detective Duggan in the Doctor Who serial City of Death. I loved him in that, and he's an absolute joy here. His Paul Foote is quite simply the funniest and most engaging character in the entire film. Up until a certain point, he doesn't take anything seriously and is constantly making jokes, even in the most dire circumstances; clearly, Paul operates on an entirely different plain of mental existence from the other people in the mansion.If the movie has one weakness, it's the werewolf itself. Apparently, Amicus blew its entire budget renting a helicopter and assembling all these wonderful actors, that they had zilch left over for the monster, so the titular beast is played by an actual wolf. Or, at least, a large, shaggy dog that looks reasonably enough like a wolf. Still, to Amicus' credit, they keep the critter mostly offscreen and let the suspense and the drama drive the story, and, when the shaggy abomination does rear its cute head and waggy tail, they shoot the attack scenes around the animal, and it works fairly well.",5,Tonight the Beast Must Die!,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,7279,"['Somewhere', 'rural', 'England', 'man', 'running', 'running', 'very',

There may not have been CGI effects available in 1973 (as the Director bemoans) but at least they could have found a werewolf substitute that was far better than the dog they used. Indeed, our werewolf kept sticking his tongue out and swinging it, looking as though he were more concered to find his missing ""doggie dish"" than anything else.The premise of this movie had to do with Calvin Lockhart being your uber hunter who has bagged every notable animal save for a werewolf. He invites a number of guests to his home and announces that one of them is a werewolf. He intends to find out who it is and hunt the creature down. The explanation as to how CL knows that one them could be a werewolf is rather lame to put it mildly. Be that as it may, the hunt begins. Immediately, things begin to go bad. First, the ""wolf"" crashes through a skylight and eliminates the monitor of some highly sensitive tracking equipment along with all the equipment itself.  Question: Why would you ever put such equipment and its monitor in a room with a glass ceiling that any strong animal, much less a werewolf, could break through?  And why wouldn't the monitor be armed with a gun containing silver bullets? And why am I asking such stupid questionsabout a horror wanabee movie?Soon afterward, one after another of the house guests is eliminated by the ""wolf"". Question: Why weren't all the house guests locked in their individual rooms so that whoever the werewolf was couldbe trapped and then hunted? Or, is that not fair game (pardon the pun)?Eventually, after one red herring and more bloodshed, the werewolf is revealed. But first there is a 30 second break for the audience to guess which character is the werewolf. (Shades of William Castle.) We are not told what the prize would be for guessing correctly. Full disclosure here - I guessed wrong.The effort of Calvin Lockhart as THE hunter is to be commended even if somewhat hyperbolic. As a black actor, being cast in such a lead part for the time was most unusual; and according to the director, may have proven to be a bit stressful. Peter Cushing was wasted in his role and was only there because he WAS Peter Cushing. The other actors were more like cameos as well, though the lady friend of CL comported herself well.

576952,A24MVVGNFVG68S,B00005ABVT,Manfred Zeichmann,"[8, 9]","I am a huge fan of werewolves, so THE BEAST MUST DIE DVD was a mandatory purchase for me. Let me assure you THE BEAST is one of the most unusual movies starring a furry predator in the history of film.The movie's hero is a rich big game hunter, who invites several guests to his remote English mansion. Now rich big game hunters are not unusual in movies, although I bet you rarely have seen a black one, and while he looks like a refugee from one of the SHAFT movies, he has an odd British accent (movie director Paul ANNETT comments in an interview in the extra features section that the character was an effort to cash in on the then popular blaxploitation genre and reveals that actor Calvin LOCKHART was unhappy with the role and felt it unfitting for a black person).His guests are an odd bunch too, consisting of a lycanthropy scholar (the late great Peter CUSHING, one of Britain`s finest actors), a former diplomat (Peter GRAY, who played 007's nemesis BLOFELD in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER), a hippie painter and a neurotic concert pianist and his girlfriend. All of them have some skeletons in the closet, and our big game hunter suspects one of them to be a lycanthrope - ""One of you is a werewolf!"" he announces to his guests and tells them, he will find out who and kill him.Despite our hero being aided by high tech video and microphone surveillance of the mansion and the surrounding area, a helicopter, and a whole silver bullet firing arsenal, the bodycount soon starts to rise once the full moon shines from the dark nocturnal sky and tensions mount among the survivors. Everybody is suspicous. Can you guess who the werewolf is? And who will survive his rampage?Now, admittedly THE BEAST MUST DIE is not very scary, but it is charmingly oldfashioned and unusual enough to keep you interested. Yes, the ""werewolf"" is clearly a German shepherd dog with a big attached fur (specifically evident in a scene were the ""werewolf"" fights our hero's dog), but personally I did not find it unintentionally funny. Wisely the ""werewolf"" is seldom shown and mostly relegated to the shadows. Don`t expect a horror film, think of it as a kind of Agatha CHRISTIE like murder mystery with a werewolf. There are lots of red herrings, wrong clues and some quite good unexpected plot twists toward the end (don't worry, I will not spoil them). And of course there is the well-known gimmick of this film, the ""werewolf break"" - it is so well known that I don't regard it as spoiler to mention it (towards the end the picture freezeframes and to the sight of a superimposed ticking clock you got 30 seconds to figure out who of the remaining suspects is the werewolf). A great idea!The cast is great, particularly Peter CUSHING as werewolf expert and Anton DIFFRING as surveillance guy Pavel. Overall it is an entertaining fun film that will appeal to fans of murder mysteries and werewolves alike!I also enjoyed the extra features, which include the film's excellent trailer as well as trailers for ASYLUM and LET THE SCREAMING START. There is also a good picture gallery, consisting of about 20 or so movie stills, posters and lobby cards. Another interesting extra feature is an interview with director Paul ANNETT, where he fondly remembers working with CUSHING, expands on the ""werewolf"" scenes, expresses interest in a remake, and loathes the ""werewolf break"" gimmick. There are also excellent liner notes.Great cover artwork too!

It wasn't the companies fault, it was the fact that the market had changed and if they wanted to tread water then they had put a new face on their product. Amicus decided to make a werewolf tale set in modern day and then throw in elements of mystery and add a dash of blackploitation for good measure and here is the result. Calvin Lockhart invited a group of people to his secluded mansion because he is certain that one of them is a werewolf. He has equipped his area with all kinds of monitors and tracking devices and he hopes to flush out the werewolf and kill it. We have plenty of groovy music, a strange bunch of suspects (none of them seem particulary shocked when they are told why they are there) and a few plot twists here and there. The film oftentimes seems very off kilter and uneven, but you still watch because the whole concept is fairly interesting. The film seems a little [low-budget] due to the werewolf being a dog with an extra fur coat being the werewolf. Calvin Lockhart tries and he is fair, but having legendary Peter Cushing, steely-eyed Charles Gray and ice cold Anton Differing in the supporting cast really gives this one a boost.

576954,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00005ABVT,Michael R Gates,"[0, 2]","For a few decades during the latter half of the 20th century, both Amicus Productions and Hammer Film Productions were successful British movie-making companies that each earned reputations for the horror films they produced.  But with the test of time, Hammer has come out as the favorite among the bulk of horror fans, and rightly so. With the possible exceptions of TALES FROM THE CRYPT (1972) and THE VAULT OF HORROR (1973), which were based on the American comic books published in the 1950s by EC Comics, Amicus rarely produced movies that equaled the literary and cinematic quality of those created by rival Hammer. A case in point is Amicus' werewolf flick THE BEAST MUST DIE (1974).  The first cinematic effort from director Paul Annett, whose previous experience was limited to British independent television, THE BEAST MUST DIE is a slow-paced horror whodunit that actually feels less like a feature film and more like an overlong episode of a boring 1970s TV series.Based loosely on a novelette by the venerated American SF writer James Blish, THE BEAST MUST DIE's rather cliche plot revolves around a character named Tom Newcliffe, a wealthy self-made businessman whose numerous hobbies include big-game hunting.  Convinced that one member of his group of jet-set acquaintances is secretly a werewolf, Newcliffe invites them all to a weekend getaway at his huge estate with the hope that he can ""out"" the lycanthrope and eventually kill it.  Unfortunately, the film's characters are as cliche and as uninteresting as the story itself, and it is therefore difficult to feel any sympathy for them as the werewolf predictably begins to off them one by one.From a cinematic standpoint, the film has numerous flaws, but the most egregious among them are definitely the laughable special FX.  Indeed, the titular werewolf itself is clearly nothing more than a large dog wearing a custom-made fur coat.  Almost as awful as the FX is the William Castle-like ""werewolf break"" gimmick, a 30-second spot near the end of the film during which the audience is invited to guess which of the remaining characters is the werewolf.  In addition, the hybrid jazz-and-rock score is ill suited for a horror film. Instead of contributing to any spooky ambiance, the music's shrill brass-based passages instead invoke the atmosphere of a car-chase scene in a TV cop show. And last but not least, the talents of the great actor Peter Cushing--who also appeared in countless Hammer horror films--are shamefully wasted on his cookie-cutter background role of a Van Helsing-like scholar of lycanthropy.  Throughout the film, Cushing is required to do little more than shuffle around the set and occasionally spew out bits of werewolf lore.Like the film itself, the DVD release of THE BEAST MUST DIE from Dark Sky Films also leaves a lot to be desired.  The disc offers the film in an anamorphic widescreen version that is reportedly at an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, but since the film was originally shot at a ratio of 1.66:1, Dark Sky's offering is actually slightly cropped.  Visually, the digital transfer is fairly clean, though there are a few spots of noticeable mpeg artifacts and jitter.  On the plus side, the disc does offer a couple of nice extras, one of which is an interesting feature commentary with the director.In short, Amicus' THE BEAST MUST DIE is a drastically inferior horror film, especially when compared to the other major British example of lycanthropic cinema from that era, competitor Hammer's THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF (1961).  While Dark Sky's DVD release of THE BEAST MUST DIE might be of interest to die-hard horror fans and scholars of horror cinema, those who only make occasional sojourns into the horror genre should probably steer clear.",2,"The Beast Must Die, but the Audience Will Snooze",1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,3758,"['few', 'decades', 'latter', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'Amicus', 'Productions', 'Hammer', 'Film', 'Productions', 'were', 'successful', 'British', 'movie-making', 'companies', 'earned', 'reputations', 'horror', 'films', 'produced', 'test', 'time', 'Hammer', 'come', 'out', 'favorite', 'bulk', 'horror', 'fans', 'rightly', 'so', 'possible', 'exceptions', 'TALES', 'FROM', 'THE', 'CRYPT', '1972', 'THE', 'VAULT', 'OF', 'HORROR', '1973', 'were', 'based', 'American', 'comic', 'books', 'published', '1950s', 'EC', 'Comics', 'Amicus', 'rarely', 'produced', 'movies', 'equaled', 'literary', 'cinematic', 'quality', 'created', 'rival', 'Hammer', 'case', 'point', 'Amicus', 'werewolf', 'flick', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', '1974', 'first', 'cinematic', 'effort', 'director', 'Paul', 'Annett', 'previous', 'experience', 'was', 'limited', 'British', 'independent', 'television', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', 'slow-paced', 'horror', 'whodunit', 'actually', 'less', 'feature', 'film', 'more', 'overlong', 'episode', 'boring', '1970s', 'TV', 'series.Based', 'loosely', 'novelette', 'venerated', 'American', 'SF', 'writer', 'James', 'Blish', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', 'rather', 'cliche', 'plot', 'around', 'character', 'named', 'Tom', 'Newcliffe', 'wealthy', 'self-made', 'businessman', 'numerous', 'hobbies', 'include', 'big-game', 'hunting', 'Convinced', 'one', 'member', 'group', 'jet-set', 'acquaintances', 'secretly', 'werewolf', 'Newcliffe', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'huge', 'estate', 'hope', 'can', 'out', 'lycanthrope', 'eventually', 'kill', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'cliche', 'as', 'uninteresting', 'story', 'therefore', 'difficult', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'werewolf', 'predictably', 'off', 'one', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'film', 'numerous', 'flaws', 'most', 'egregious', 'are', 'definitely', 'laughable', 'special', 'FX', 'Indeed', 'titular', 'werewolf', 'clearly', 'nothing', 'more', 'large', 'dog', 'wearing', 'custom-made', 'fur', 'coat', 'as', 'awful', 'FX', 'William', 'Castle-like', 'werewolf', 'break', 'gimmick', '30-second', 'spot', 'end', 'film', 'audience', 'invited', 'guess', 'remaining', 'characters', 'werewolf', 'addition', 'hybrid', 'jazz-and-rock', 'score', 'ill', 'suited', 'horror', 'film', 'Instead', 'contributing', 'spooky', 'ambiance', 'music', 'shrill', 'brass-based', 'passages', 'instead', 'invoke', 'atmosphere', 'car-chase', 'scene', 'TV', 'cop', 'show', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'talents', 'great', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'countless', 'Hammer', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'shamefully', 'wasted', 'cookie-cutter', 'background', 'role', 'Van', 'Helsing-like', 'scholar', 'lycanthropy', 'film', 'Cushing', 'required', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'shuffle', 'set', 'occasionally', 'spew', 'out', 'bits', 'werewolf', 'film', 'DVD', 'release', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', 'Dark', 'Sky', 'Films', 'also', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'disc', 'film', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'version', 'reportedly', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'ratio', '1.66:1', 'Dark', 'Sky', 'offering', 'actually', 'slightly', 'cropped', 'Visually', 'digital', 'transfer', 'fairly', 'clean', 'are', 'few', 'spots', 'noticeable', 'mpeg', 'artifacts', 'jitter', 'plus', 'side', 'disc', 'offer', 'couple', 'nice', 'extras', 'one', 'interesting', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director.In', 'short', 'Amicus', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', 'drastically', 'inferior', 'horror', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'major', 'British', 'example', 'lycanthropic', 'cinema', 'era', 'competitor', 'Hammer', 'THE', 'CURSE', 'THE', 'WEREWOLF', '1961', 'Dark', 'Sky', 'DVD', 'release', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'MUST', 'DIE', 'might', 'be', 'interest', 'die-hard', 'horror', 'fans', 'scholars', 'horror', 'cinema', 'who', 'only', 'make', 'occasional', 'sojourns', 'horror', 'genre', 'should', 'probably', 'steer', 'clear']",N/A

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[2, 5]","I'm a huge Peter Cushing fan but even HE couldn't pull this one out of the old excusado.If you're going to make a campy, spoofy film like this one, you pretty much need to stick to the stereotypical expectations of the potential viewers. Here, the producers/director seized upon every bizarre element that they could latch on to.I was looking for the macho, loud-mouthed Brit in khakis and an Aussie hat as the host and Big Game hunter -- nope. It turned out to be a cultured black guy, speaking the Queen's English, who generates the ambiance of Issac Hayes.One of the folks at the estate is supposed to be a werewolf (a strange idea), and this ""hunter"" who looks and acts more like a high-end record producer, has sworn to take him or her out. He is assisted by the fact that there are about a million cameras and microphones (indoor mikes that would last until the first time it rained!) spread throughout the estate. It's coming up a full moon (which he says is good for generating werewolf morphs for 3 days) and our hero has an astute assistant who seems to monitor the million TV screens, etc., 24/7.Yes, a werewolf appears but, even though they have the high-tech stuff, they can't seem to get a handle on who it is.... and it goes downhill from there.The musical score ranges from a Starsky and Hutch-type theme to Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"". Pretty awful all-around.So, I made it to the ending so that I might review it and I wish that I had not. I won't tell you how the end went down but I think that they just ran out of money to make the film and opted for the ""quick-out.""There may be folks who like this film but I can't imagine why they would.

Starring among others the legendary horror great Peter Cushing this production was surprisingly one of the rare occasions where Amicus tackled a werewolf story having dealt with it only once before in a segment of their first production ""Dr. Terror's House of Horrors"". Being the 1970's however the story has a very different slant to their earlier efforts with a funky 70's sound track and a black leading man in Calvin Lockhart. Despite some of the weak story elements and under use of actors such as Peter Cushing and Charles Gray, ""The Beast Must Die"", is an atmospheric production that does keep you guessing right up to the conclusion and even includes a bizzare ""werewolf break"", where the story halts and the viewers are asked to guess who among the characters is the werewolf!

When the quality of Hammer films fell Amicus pitched in with ""Asylum"", ""The House That Dripped Blood"" and ""The Beast Must Die"". Even the least of these is entertaining even when the cheese factor (such as in ""Madhouse"") is higher than the chill factor.Based on a story by science fiction writer James Blish ""The Beast Must Die"" mixes the plots from ""Ten Little Indians"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Throw in a bit of 70's camp and you've got this minor gem. The plot has been pretty well described previously but I'll briefly recap it again. A wealthy man gathers together a group of people to his house. He believs that one of them is a werewolf and plans on killing the creature. The acting ranges from very good (Anton Diffring, Michael Gambon, Charles Gray) to the seriously bad (Calvin Lockhart)and inbetween (Peter Cushing does a fine job despite an overactive accent).Unlike some of the other releases from Dark Sky this one doesn't look all that great. It's acceptable but the image is grainy and has a slightly greenish tint to it at times. What makes this edition shine are the extras. ""Directing the Beast"" features director Paul Annett discussing the making of the film. Annett also provides a fascinating commentary track moderated by Jonathan Sothcott. We also get a solid photo gallery which includes lobby cards and stills. Finally we get trailers for two other concurrent Dark Sky releases ""And Now The Screaming Starts"" and ambitious ""Rebecca""-like effort directed by Roy Ward Baker (""Quatermass and the Pit"", ""A Night to Remember"", ""Asylum"")that seems more like a Hammer effort with its lush production design and period setting and Baker's ""Asylum"". There's also a rememberance of actor Peter Cushing a talented actor who was often better than the material he appeared in.""The Beast Must Die"" is more interesting for its unusual mishmash of different storylines and mix of genres. While it isn't complete successful it's an enjoyable film highlighted by some time notch actors.
