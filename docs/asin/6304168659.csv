While most people will probably look at the film as just a regular family movie, I actually got something else out of it.  While watching the movie I learned to appreciate seals.  You know it's always been a mystery just how smart some of the sea animals really are, such as dolphins and seals.Well, watching the way Andre communicates with the people in the movie, you can sense he's a highly intelligent animal.  Some of his mannerisms such as sticking his tongue out in front of the people he didn't like, and being able to do a variety of tricks without missing a beat shows just how well a seal can understand humans.  I was sitting there totally amazed how smart Andre was.  I was also amazed that an animal that came from the ocean was able to fit in so well with humans.Dogs are also really smart animals, and some of Andre's facial expressions reminded me of my dad's girlfriend's basset hound.  I believe after you finish watching the movie, you too will be amazed at the level of intelligence seals have.  I simply didn't know how smart they are, but this movie really opened my eyes.

I like this film because I'm an animal lover and this film is filled with animals.""Andre"" is about a little girl, Toni Whitney, played by Tina Majorina, who lives with her parents Harry and Thalice, played by Shane Meier and Chelsea Field; her sister, Paula, played by Aidan Pendleton; and her brother Steve, played by Keith Carradine. They have an assortment of animals, and decide to adopt an orphaned, baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years, until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away!My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother, Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids, yet also knows how to discipline them.My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and funn. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion, not a seal, in the movie.""Andre"" is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport, Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change.This movie is a tear-jerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a family-friendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film five-out-of-five stars because I thought that the movie was really well-done overall and had a great plot.
