It's age appropriate for both my sons (age 19 months, he can recognize and say most of the words) and my 4 year old (he knows them but is starting to learn to read so this movie is a good refresher).",5,Another winner,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,335,"['boys', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'Preschool', 'Prep', 'productions', 'are', 'quality', 'animation', 'educational', 'exception', 'age', 'appropriate', 'sons', 'age', '19', 'months', 'can', 'recognize', 'say', 'most', 'words', '4', 'year', 'old', 'starting', 'learn', 'read', 'so', 'movie', 'good', 'refresher']",Meet the Sight Words 2
1165480,AW7VVW61YKZIQ,B001ACI5B8,"J M P ""Hotel Mom 123""","[0, 0]","These videos to the parent (and perhaps to some children) are extremely dull, repetitive and the graphics are not the best so if you are hoping for some bright shiny miracle on the screen to put your child in a learning trance this is not going to cut it. The good news is the video works and it seems to have lasting results. I haven't put these on consistantly and my son doesn't stay still to watch them for more than 10 minutes at a time. I put them on sometimes while he is playing and he stops to look and pays attention and goes back to playing. We haven't used these videos in several weeks but this morning he was very proud he used the word was and spelled it out to me--which for me which is a testimony to its usefulness and staying power. I don't think this is a stand alone product--you still needs flash cards or other hands on teaching to turn what is memorization into learning. The animations and words don't seem to correspond, and my son has gotten side tracked as to why a letter is doing the laundry and so on so I wish it would be a little more on target but overall this product without forceful or calculated use has indeed helped build my childs ability to recognize several words. We have skipped around cds which is not the intent so its hard to know how many he knows but definitely more than 8 words he can visually recognize and spell to me from the back of the car after casual use. (My son is 3.25) I wish that the videos included a simple list of what words they taught because I had to sit down and write a list so we could work on the words in other ways. (writing them at color time, choosing three words and doing flashcards, putting one of the flashcards on the fridge)",5,Good but know what to expect,1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,1708,"['videos', 'parent', 'perhaps', 'children', 'are', 'extremely', 'dull', 'repetitive', 'graphics', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'so', 'are', 'hoping', 'bright', 'shiny', 'miracle', 'screen', 'put', 'child', 'learning', 'trance', 'not', 'going', 'cut', 'good', 'news', 'video', 'have', 'lasting', 'results', 'have', ""n't"", 'put', 'consistantly', 'son', ""n't"", 'stay', 'still', 'watch', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'time', 'put', 'sometimes', 'playing', 'look', 'pays', 'attention', 'back', 'playing', 'have', ""n't"", 'used', 'videos', 'several', 'weeks', 'morning', 'was', 'very', 'proud', 'used', 'word', 'was', 'spelled', 'out', 'testimony', 'usefulness', 'staying', 'power', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'stand', 'alone', 'product', 'still', 'flash', 'cards', 'other', 'hands', 'teaching', 'turn', 'what', 'memorization', 'learning', 'animations', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'correspond', 'son', 'gotten', 'side', 'tracked', 'why', 'letter', 'doing', 'laundry', 'so', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'target', 'overall', 'product', 'forceful', 'calculated', 'use', 'indeed', 'helped', 'build', 'childs', 'ability', 'recognize', 'several', 'words', 'have', 'skipped', 'cds', 'not', 'intent', 'so', 'hard', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'definitely', 'more', '8', 'words', 'can', 'visually', 'recognize', 'spell', 'back', 'car', 'casual', 'use', 'son', '3.25', 'wish', 'videos', 'included', 'simple', 'list', 'what', 'words', 'taught', 'had', 'sit', 'down', 'write', 'list', 'could', 'work', 'words', 'other', 'ways', 'writing', 'color', 'time', 'choosing', 'three', 'words', 'doing', 'flashcards', 'putting', 'one', 'flashcards', 'fridge']",Meet the Sight Words 2
