1337022,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B003D7B58I,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[7, 8]","It's quite sad that a movie that was released in 2007 takes until October 2010 to get a BD release here, especially when it's this good. I guess that's not unusual for European films, especially subtitled ones, which it's deemed by someone to not be mainstream enough for US audiences?The story was broken up into two movies in 2007, and 2008 originally so to get the ""whole"" story so to speak, is almost worth the wait, albeit in truncated form.That being said, apparently the original version ( a truly lavish scale of production by European standards ) was released initially in a Mini Series format running about 6 hours in total, much like the original German version ofDas Boot - The Original Uncut VersionTo date, no plans have been made to make this version available, and although it is possible to get the original two movies - ARN: The Knight Templar, and ARN: The Kingdom at Roads End on DVD, they are hard to find, and in PAL format, or region 2 coded.Arn (played by Joakim Nattergvist) is based on the trilogy of books by Swedish author Jan Guillou, and although I have not read the books, I consider this adaptation to be a rare treat for fans of the genre.It's easy to quickly draw many comparisons with movies like ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and even the Lord of the Rings trilogy in some ways, partly due to the fact that the movie is so well made. The acting is great throughout, the locations impressive, and the battle scenes are graphic and realistic.Some will feel that the battle scenes are scant, even though they are done on a grand scale, but the story is about the struggle, not just the fighting.It's a story of two parts really.A young boy growing up in 12th century Sweden is taken by his parents to a monastery as he has an illness, and is not expected to reach adulthood.While there, he is taken under the wing of a monk who previously ""served God"" in the holy crusades, and he nurtures Arn's apparent natural talent with weapons to teach him the finer arts of fighting, swordplay and archery - something the youngster takes to well, aided by the fact he is naturally ambidextrous.Historically, much of Europe around the time the movie is set, was not as geographically delineated as it is today, many countries were a loose collection of warring fiefdoms, vying for power, land and the throne, and Sweden was no exception. It is during one such encounter that while defending his fathers honor, he makes an enemy of the powerful Svenger clan.Against the wishes of his family, the young Arn also falls in love with Cecilia, the daughter of a local family betrothed to the Svenger clan to help cement an alliance between the two most powerful families trying to control the country.Through lies and scorn he is sent to the Holy Land as a Crusader to do penance for 20 years, while his young bride to be is sentenced likewise for 20 years in a local convent, run by a vicious Abbess, who is sympathetic to the Svenger clan.Half of the movie centers on her struggle and life in Sweden, and the other on Arn's arduous and battle ridden path through the Holy land.I'm not going to go into much more detail than that really, and that's about as much information you would get from the movie trailer anyway, so not really a spoiler.Compressing three books into one movie, that runs just under two and a quarter hours, I'm sure will leave some plot holes for people who have read the books, but to me it felt very complete.It's also going to feel a little slow to some people, this movie is as much about love and family as it is about fighting and the crusades.despite these two points, I strongly recommend seeing this movie.There are those who will be put off by subtitles, although a large portion of the movie is in English. What is particularly well done is that all the characters speak their own language, Arabic, French, Swedish and English, clearly stated on screen with the subtitles, so it's easy to keep up.There are a few familiar faces US viewers will probably recognize, not least Stellen Skarsgard, but most I'm sure like me will be amazed that they haven't seen Joakim Nattergvist in anything before.This is top notch acting, whichever way you look at it, from the whole cast but particularly him.Focused, driven and really believable in the role, he seems to embrace all aspects of Arn's character.This feels to me like old fashioned story telling, with modern technology kept to a minimum. It feels ""Epic""If you like this kind of movie genre, see this film. 5 stars",5,Epic,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,4504,"['quite', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '2007', 'October', '2010', 'get', 'BD', 'release', 'here', 'especially', 'when', 'good', 'guess', 'not', 'unusual', 'European', 'films', 'especially', 'subtitled', 'ones', 'deemed', 'someone', 'not', 'be', 'mainstream', 'enough', 'US', 'audiences', 'story', 'was', 'broken', 'up', 'two', 'movies', '2007', '2008', 'originally', 'so', 'get', 'whole', 'story', 'so', 'speak', 'almost', 'worth', 'wait', 'albeit', 'truncated', 'form.That', 'being', 'said', 'apparently', 'original', 'version', 'truly', 'lavish', 'scale', 'production', 'European', 'standards', 'was', 'released', 'initially', 'Mini', 'Series', 'format', 'running', 'about', '6', 'hours', 'total', 'much', 'original', 'German', 'version', 'ofDas', 'Boot', 'Original', 'Uncut', 'VersionTo', 'date', 'plans', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'make', 'version', 'available', 'possible', 'get', 'original', 'two', 'movies', 'ARN', 'Knight', 'Templar', 'ARN', 'Kingdom', 'Roads', 'End', 'DVD', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'PAL', 'format', 'region', '2', 'coded.Arn', 'played', 'Joakim', 'Nattergvist', 'based', 'trilogy', 'books', 'Swedish', 'author', 'Jan', 'Guillou', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'consider', 'adaptation', 'be', 'rare', 'treat', 'fans', 'genre.It', 'easy', 'quickly', 'draw', 'many', 'comparisons', 'movies', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'even', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'ways', 'partly', 'due', 'fact', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'acting', 'great', 'locations', 'impressive', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'realistic.Some', 'will', 'feel', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'scant', 'even', 'are', 'done', 'grand', 'scale', 'story', 'struggle', 'not', 'just', 'fighting.It', 'story', 'two', 'parts', 'really.A', 'young', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', '12th', 'century', 'Sweden', 'taken', 'parents', 'monastery', 'illness', 'not', 'expected', 'reach', 'there', 'taken', 'wing', 'monk', 'who', 'previously', 'served', 'God', 'holy', 'crusades', 'Arn', 'apparent', 'natural', 'talent', 'weapons', 'teach', 'finer', 'arts', 'fighting', 'swordplay', 'archery', 'something', 'youngster', 'well', 'aided', 'fact', 'naturally', 'ambidextrous.Historically', 'much', 'Europe', 'time', 'movie', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'geographically', 'delineated', 'today', 'many', 'countries', 'were', 'loose', 'collection', 'warring', 'fiefdoms', 'vying', 'power', 'land', 'throne', 'Sweden', 'was', 'exception', 'one', 'such', 'encounter', 'defending', 'fathers', 'honor', 'enemy', 'powerful', 'Svenger', 'clan.Against', 'wishes', 'family', 'young', 'Arn', 'also', 'love', 'Cecilia', 'daughter', 'local', 'family', 'betrothed', 'Svenger', 'clan', 'help', 'cement', 'alliance', 'two', 'most', 'powerful', 'families', 'trying', 'control', 'country.Through', 'scorn', 'sent', 'Holy', 'Land', 'Crusader', 'do', 'penance', '20', 'years', 'young', 'bride', 'be', 'sentenced', 'likewise', '20', 'years', 'local', 'convent', 'run', 'vicious', 'Abbess', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'Svenger', 'clan.Half', 'movie', 'centers', 'struggle', 'life', 'Sweden', 'other', 'Arn', 'arduous', 'battle', 'ridden', 'path', 'Holy', 'land.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'really', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'would', 'get', 'movie', 'trailer', 'anyway', 'not', 'really', 'spoiler.Compressing', 'three', 'books', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'quarter', 'hours', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'leave', 'plot', 'holes', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'felt', 'very', 'complete.It', 'also', 'going', 'feel', 'little', 'slow', 'people', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'family', 'fighting', 'crusades.despite', 'two', 'points', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie.There', 'are', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'subtitles', 'large', 'portion', 'movie', 'English', 'What', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'speak', 'own', 'language', 'Arabic', 'French', 'Swedish', 'English', 'clearly', 'stated', 'screen', 'subtitles', 'easy', 'keep', 'are', 'few', 'familiar', 'US', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'recognize', 'not', 'least', 'Stellen', 'Skarsgard', 'most', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Joakim', 'Nattergvist', 'anything', 'before.This', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'whichever', 'way', 'look', 'whole', 'cast', 'particularly', 'him.Focused', 'driven', 'really', 'believable', 'role', 'embrace', 'aspects', 'Arn', 'character.This', 'old', 'fashioned', 'story', 'telling', 'modern', 'technology', 'kept', 'minimum', 'Epic', 'like', 'kind', 'movie', 'genre', 'see', 'film', '5', 'stars']",N/A

It's definitely my kind of flick so I thought I'd give it a shot and I'm glad I did.This is a really good story in the historical epic category. It propounds to be based in fact and, though I don't know how much they had to tweek it for script purposes, it contains certain things that feel true.Arn is a Swede who falls in love with a woman who is betrothed to another family. He knocks her up so she has to do 20 years in a convent while he has to do twenty years in the Crusades as a Knight Templar. As he himself was raised by the church he's a very serious dude. He was also schooled well in combat by a monk who did time in the Crusades so he can fight with the best of them. He heads off to the Holy Land where he becomes key in winning some battles. His time is up so he heads home to be with his woman but ends up facing a whole new challenge. It seems Sweden isn't all that united and there is a new grab for power he needs to thwart.This is an Historical Epic in the best sense. Great locations, costumes and lots of extras. You like Arn. He's a cool guy because he's good and devout, but can kick booty if he needs to. You like Cecelia his girlfriend. She's pretty and has a good spirit. It's acted well, shot well, edited well. The music score is good, though maybe a bit too similar to the ""Lord of the Rings"" score but that's a minor quibble. I also could have used a bit more in the building of the relationship between the two Cecelias, but again, it's a minor quibble. Surprisingly, they spent little effort on the major battle scenes. Were this Ridley Scott or Antoine Fuqua we'd have been dazzled by meticulous staging and swordplay. But here the director just didn't seem that interested. It's as though the battle scenes were no more important than anything else going on. I could have used more there myself but they were good enough to get the point across and move me to the next scene.This is a good, solid effort. It has all the right things in all the right measure.

1337040,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003D7B58I,Haunted Flower,"[6, 15]","1 Disc Widescreen, being released October 12, 2010""Arn the Knight Templar"" was directed by Peter Flinth in 2007 and stars Joakim N&auml;tterqvist as Arn Magnusson who has been trained from the age of a young boy to become an expert swordsman and after being double-crossed by a nobleman is made into a Knight Templar and sent to the Crusades. In the process of fighting to regain his freedom, he battles in the war and becomes a ""hero.""The beauty of a big budget film like this about the Crusades being made in Sweden is that the languages spoken in it are English, Swedish, Arabic, French, AND Latin -- not just English like it would be in America. It does a great deal more to authenticate the time period. There's just something so romantic about knights, chivalry, the costumes, the architecture, the nuns -- wait a second, the nuns?Since the Crusades actually were a dark time in history and not at all heroic like history books originally made them out to be, the church's darker side comes out as well. Arn was supposed to be a monk and his romantic interest, Cecilia was supposed to be a nun and the two are split apart after being found out and made example of. Arn gets to be a knight instead of a monk since he happens to be good with a sword, but he's a HOLY knight so that should make ALL the difference. Cecilia is thrown back into the nunnery where women are punished with lashes from a whip until blood is drawn for speaking. Scenes inside churches are more gruesome than ON the battlefield for the majority of the film.Joakim N&auml;tterqvist as the lead goes against type because when he is young and clean shaven, he just looks kind of goofy, immature, and short so nothing like a future hero. He gets more realistic street cred after growing his beard, but I never believe him as anything other than a guy who would get lost in the ranks. He is ""Russell Crow-ed"" up a bit on the cover, but he looks nothing like that during the film. It is played like he is supposed to be Aragorn from Lord of the Rings, but he is no Viggo Mortensen. Sofia Helin plays Cecilia Algotsdotter who is brought up as a nun-in-training, falls in love, then is practically imprisoned back in the church by the other nuns. Nuns are evil in this and the Mother Superior type character goes so far as admitting she wanted to ""crush the happiness"" shared by Cecelia and Arn. When Cecelia finds herself unable to forgive the woman who not only crushed her happiness but stole her child away from her, the woman freaks out and attempts to curse her!The costuming, sets, props, and accurate language really adds something special to this film and the whole thing has a big-budget feel typical of our American films but unique in Sweden. The lighting out in the desert is pretty fantastic as well. There is an overlying theme of obedience to one's elders, church, and country. It is pretty hard to keep up with when everyone seems out to get the two main characters who seem perfectly willing to serve their penance and when they do, they get it taken away from them again by jealous people in power. When the battle is truly underway, it feels like ""Braveheart"" but instead of being ""FOR FREEDOM!!!"", it's ""For Norway!""This movie is based on a series of historical fiction books by Jan Guillou and in 2008, a follow-up movie came out called ""Arn: The Kingdom at Road's End."" A three-part series of novels was made into 2 feature-length films and were the most expensive films made in Sweden's history. It feels like every big budget film period film you've seen in America, but it's from Sweden. It's still well done, but I don't care for the story. The Crusades were a dark point in history, not to be romanticized. As soon as I learned about the Crusades in school, I had to ask, ""why is our mascot The Crusader??? There's nothing good about that story!"" It is one of many doomed holy wars and we often forget its association with the story of Robin Hood. A bunch of people thinking they are off to do good when they aren't. Clearly everyone in power was vilified in this film, but our leads were made out to be martyrs doing the time for their crime in a saintly manner and I just was not feeling it.Special Features:There are two bonus featurettes of the making of the film subtitled in english with a running time of approximately 40 minutes total. It feels like the making of every epic period film you've ever seen before...the difference is that this was made in Sweden where they do not have a vast history of epic big-budget films to draw from so it all is pretty new to them. They are clearly very proud of what was accomplished in this film, but I have to say...I really don't get films about the Crusades.",4,"An epic film definitely, but the story's leads did not keep me enraptured with the plot nor do the Crusades",1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,4707,"['1', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'being', 'released', 'October', '12', '2010', 'Arn', 'Knight', 'Templar', 'was', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Flinth', '2007', 'stars', 'Joakim', 'N', 'auml', 'Arn', 'Magnusson', 'who', 'been', 'trained', 'age', 'young', 'boy', 'become', 'expert', 'swordsman', 'being', 'double-crossed', 'nobleman', 'made', 'Knight', 'Templar', 'sent', 'Crusades', 'process', 'fighting', 'regain', 'freedom', 'war', 'hero', 'beauty', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'Crusades', 'being', 'made', 'Sweden', 'languages', 'spoken', 'are', 'English', 'Swedish', 'Arabic', 'French', 'AND', 'Latin', 'not', 'just', 'English', 'would', 'be', 'America', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'authenticate', 'time', 'period', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'romantic', 'knights', 'chivalry', 'costumes', 'architecture', 'nuns', 'wait', 'second', 'nuns', 'Crusades', 'actually', 'were', 'dark', 'time', 'history', 'not', 'heroic', 'history', 'books', 'originally', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'church', 'darker', 'side', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'Arn', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'monk', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Cecilia', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'nun', 'two', 'are', 'split', 'apart', 'being', 'found', 'made', 'example', 'Arn', 'be', 'knight', 'instead', 'monk', 'be', 'good', 'sword', 'HOLY', 'knight', 'so', 'that', 'should', 'make', 'difference', 'Cecilia', 'thrown', 'back', 'nunnery', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'punished', 'lashes', 'whip', 'blood', 'drawn', 'speaking', 'Scenes', 'churches', 'are', 'more', 'gruesome', 'battlefield', 'majority', 'film.Joakim', 'N', 'auml', 'lead', 'type', 'when', 'young', 'clean', 'shaven', 'just', 'kind', 'goofy', 'immature', 'short', 'so', 'nothing', 'future', 'hero', 'more', 'realistic', 'street', 'cred', 'growing', 'beard', 'never', 'believe', 'anything', 'other', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'lost', 'ranks', 'Russell', 'Crow-ed', 'up', 'bit', 'cover', 'nothing', 'film', 'played', 'supposed', 'be', 'Aragorn', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Sofia', 'Helin', 'Cecilia', 'Algotsdotter', 'who', 'brought', 'up', 'nun-in-training', 'love', 'then', 'practically', 'imprisoned', 'back', 'church', 'other', 'nuns', 'Nuns', 'are', 'evil', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'type', 'character', 'so', 'far', 'admitting', 'wanted', 'crush', 'happiness', 'shared', 'Cecelia', 'Arn', 'When', 'Cecelia', 'unable', 'forgive', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'crushed', 'happiness', 'stole', 'child', 'away', 'woman', 'out', 'attempts', 'curse', 'costuming', 'sets', 'props', 'accurate', 'language', 'really', 'something', 'special', 'film', 'whole', 'thing', 'big-budget', 'feel', 'typical', 'American', 'films', 'unique', 'Sweden', 'lighting', 'out', 'desert', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'overlying', 'theme', 'obedience', 'one', 'elders', 'church', 'country', 'pretty', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'when', 'everyone', 'out', 'get', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'serve', 'penance', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'taken', 'away', 'again', 'jealous', 'people', 'power', 'When', 'battle', 'truly', 'underway', 'Braveheart', 'instead', 'being', 'FOR', 'FREEDOM', 'Norway', 'movie', 'based', 'series', 'historical', 'fiction', 'books', 'Jan', 'Guillou', '2008', 'follow-up', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'called', 'Arn', 'Kingdom', 'Road', 'End', 'three-part', 'series', 'novels', 'was', 'made', '2', 'feature-length', 'films', 'were', 'most', 'expensive', 'films', 'made', 'Sweden', 'history', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'period', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'America', 'Sweden', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'story', 'Crusades', 'were', 'dark', 'point', 'history', 'not', 'be', 'romanticized', 'As', 'soon', 'learned', 'Crusades', 'school', 'had', 'ask', 'why', 'mascot', 'Crusader', 'nothing', 'good', 'story', 'one', 'many', 'doomed', 'holy', 'wars', 'often', 'forget', 'association', 'story', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'A', 'bunch', 'people', 'thinking', 'are', 'do', 'good', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'Clearly', 'everyone', 'power', 'was', 'vilified', 'film', 'leads', 'were', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'martyrs', 'doing', 'time', 'crime', 'saintly', 'manner', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'feeling', 'it.Special', 'Features', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'making', 'film', 'subtitled', 'english', 'running', 'time', 'approximately', '40', 'minutes', 'total', 'making', 'epic', 'period', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'difference', 'was', 'made', 'Sweden', 'where', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'vast', 'history', 'epic', 'big-budget', 'films', 'draw', 'pretty', 'new', 'are', 'clearly', 'very', 'proud', 'what', 'was', 'accomplished', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'films', 'Crusades']",N/A

The story is fabulous.  I taught history and political science for 27 years.  But Nordic history is not as well-known as other European history.  This movie also gives insight into the Crusades and the politics, greed and quest for power that had little to do with the lofty goals of saving men's souls which was used to justify the murder and mayhem that was the Crusades.  But looking at the &#34;forest&#34; instead of the &#34;tree&#34;, the Crusaders brought back knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, science, philosophy and culture that dragged Europe out of the dense darkness of the Middle Ages.  This brought about the awakening of Europe from the practice of punishing of anyonewho questioned authority or embraced exploration, thought and dialogue, science as opposed to religion and also brought more humane conditions for those who broke the laws.

Camera angles are generally of the slow ponderous horizontal pan variety and the score is full of overblown schmaltz. Lead character Arn Magnusson is a goody two shoes super soldier who speaks arabic, pals around with Saladdin, and who could have prevented the Templar disaster at Hattin if only his sage advice had been heeded. Right. The film is supposed to cover a twenty year time span, but the characters don't age a day. The only way you can tell is that Arn's infant son is full grown at the end of the film.

It follows the full life of Arn Magnusson, a Swedish lad who grows up in a monastery where he's trained in use of sword. He falls for a local girl, but fates intervene and the two are forced to be apart for twenty long years. Cecilia is stuck in a nunnery, while Arn is turned into a Knight Templar and sent off to the Holy Land.The movie is stunning in how it portrays the many cultures involved in medieval times. Some people tend to think of medieval in terms of a tiny village in England where everyone knew each other, looked the same, and spoke the same language. In reality, many people did travel in medieval times, and cultures often mixed. In their homelands Arn and Cecilia speak Swedish. When he's on the road he speaks English. With the locals in the Middle East he speaks Arabic. Other languages get mixed in as well. Yes, this means subtitles - and it also means you can hear the rich wealth of tones and sounds.I love the attention to detail. The rough fabric the women wore, the types of chain and armor the soldiers wore, all seem richly evocative of the time period. This movie ended up being the most expensive movie in Swedish history.There's a lot of history being squished in here. I've read news that this is actually the 2 hour version of a 6 hour miniseries, and I can believe it. I will definitely be trying to get my hands on the longer version. There is so much going on here, from the Swedish battles for control to the battles for Jerusalem. We see how life in a nunnery and monastery was not always as placid as one might believe. In some situations the truncation makes it a bit challenging to follow what is going on if you're not a history buff. Hang in there, it makes sense as you go.Well recommended as a good view into the challenges of living in medieval time, and something more realistic than a Robin Hood dancing around in green tights :).",4,Great View of medieval times,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,1978,"['movie', 'three-book', 'series', 'Jan', 'Guillou', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'full', 'life', 'Arn', 'Magnusson', 'Swedish', 'lad', 'who', 'up', 'monastery', 'where', 'trained', 'use', 'sword', 'local', 'girl', 'intervene', 'two', 'are', 'forced', 'be', 'apart', 'twenty', 'long', 'years', 'Cecilia', 'stuck', 'nunnery', 'Arn', 'turned', 'Knight', 'Templar', 'sent', 'off', 'Holy', 'Land.The', 'movie', 'stunning', 'how', 'many', 'cultures', 'involved', 'medieval', 'times', 'people', 'tend', 'think', 'medieval', 'terms', 'tiny', 'village', 'England', 'where', 'everyone', 'knew', 'other', 'looked', 'same', 'spoke', 'same', 'language', 'reality', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'travel', 'medieval', 'times', 'cultures', 'often', 'mixed', 'homelands', 'Arn', 'Cecilia', 'speak', 'Swedish', 'When', 'road', 'English', 'locals', 'Middle', 'East', 'Arabic', 'Other', 'languages', 'get', 'mixed', 'as', 'well', 'Yes', 'also', 'can', 'hear', 'rich', 'wealth', 'tones', 'sounds.I', 'love', 'attention', 'detail', 'rough', 'fabric', 'women', 'wore', 'types', 'chain', 'armor', 'soldiers', 'wore', 'seem', 'richly', 'evocative', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'expensive', 'movie', 'Swedish', 'lot', 'history', 'being', 'squished', 'here', ""'ve"", 'read', 'news', 'actually', '2', 'hour', 'version', '6', 'hour', 'miniseries', 'can', 'believe', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'trying', 'get', 'hands', 'longer', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'here', 'Swedish', 'battles', 'control', 'battles', 'Jerusalem', 'see', 'how', 'life', 'nunnery', 'monastery', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'as', 'placid', 'one', 'might', 'believe', 'situations', 'truncation', 'bit', 'challenging', 'follow', 'what', 'going', ""'re"", 'not', 'history', 'buff', 'Hang', 'there', 'sense', 'go.Well', 'recommended', 'good', 'view', 'challenges', 'living', 'medieval', 'time', 'something', 'more', 'realistic', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'dancing', 'around', 'green', 'tights']",N/A

1337053,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B003D7B58I,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","Having recently watched Black Death and Season of the Witch, Arn - The Knight Templar seemed like a nice way to round out the knight trifecta. Arn is considerably different from those two films.  Where Black Death is about the rejection of paganism in light of a terrible plague and Season of the Witch is about biases against women (and Cage's accent), Arn is more like a historical reenactment.Things start out promising: Cecilia (Sofia Helin) gives birth in a convent.  The child is proclaimed a bastard and taken away to a chorus of Cecilia's wracking sobs.  What will become of the child? Who is the father?  Why is this nun (she's not a nun) giving birth?  We'll have to wait an hour to find out.The other plotline is about Arn (Joakim Natterqvist) who is raised by a former Templar in a monastery.  When he returns to his family, Arn has the opportunity to defend his father's honor.  He is instructed to never take a life except in self-defense, so instead of slaying the rival clan leader he just cuts off his arm.  This will have repercussions later.  Much later.Arn falls in love with Cecilia, who is betrothed to the rival clan.  He ends up bedding Cecilia and is accused by Cecilia's scheming sister of seducing her as well.  These accusations lead to them both being banished for twenty years to their respective convent/monastery.  Arn's simply back where he started of course, so it's not long before he's sent off to fight in the Crusades.  Twenty  years is, as the judge states, ""half a lifetime."" It's a long time for Cecilia to wait until Arn returns for her.  Fortunately for Cecilia, she won't age a year. Unfortunately for us, it takes us over a half hour to get to this point.Arn is a Swedish film far more interested in presenting a historically accurate narrative than telling a good story. The summary I gave above is more compelling than the way the movie lays it out.  This is because it's actually a hacked up version of a much longer miniseries.  It shows.At times the movie drags.  When Arn has a sit down with Saladin (yes, THE Saladin) we can guess what's going to happen.  When Cecilia pines for Arn, we can guess what's going to happen.  When Cecilia gives a cheesy cross to Arn, we can guess it will be given back in his bloodied hand at the very end of the story.  All these obvious plot points would be excusable if the editor made any effort to provide suspense, or drama, or anything besides a beat-by-beat retelling of two different tales that only intermingle occasionally.There's also the complete lack of acting makeup.  Arn grows a beard, which helps make him look a little more grizzled, but Cecilia doesn't age a day.  You get the impression director Peter Flinth is proud of the fact that this movie is without artifice, but that doesn't make it any less distracting.Beautifully shot with real locations and a dizzying array of languages, accents, and ethnicities, Arn feels like an epic...in dire need of an epic editor.",2,An epic in need of an editor,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,2970,"['Having', 'recently', 'watched', 'Black', 'Death', 'Season', 'Witch', 'Arn', 'Knight', 'Templar', 'seemed', 'nice', 'way', 'round', 'out', 'knight', 'trifecta', 'Arn', 'considerably', 'different', 'two', 'films', 'Where', 'Black', 'Death', 'rejection', 'paganism', 'light', 'terrible', 'plague', 'Season', 'Witch', 'biases', 'women', 'Cage', 'accent', 'Arn', 'more', 'historical', 'reenactment.Things', 'start', 'out', 'promising', 'Cecilia', 'Sofia', 'Helin', 'birth', 'convent', 'child', 'proclaimed', 'bastard', 'taken', 'away', 'chorus', 'Cecilia', 'wracking', 'sobs', 'What', 'will', 'become', 'child', 'Who', 'father', 'Why', 'nun', 'not', 'nun', 'giving', 'birth', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'hour', 'find', 'out.The', 'other', 'plotline', 'Arn', 'Joakim', 'Natterqvist', 'who', 'raised', 'former', 'Templar', 'monastery', 'When', 'family', 'Arn', 'opportunity', 'defend', 'father', 'honor', 'instructed', 'never', 'take', 'life', 'self-defense', 'instead', 'slaying', 'rival', 'clan', 'leader', 'just', 'cuts', 'off', 'arm', 'will', 'have', 'repercussions', 'later', 'Much', 'later.Arn', 'love', 'Cecilia', 'who', 'betrothed', 'rival', 'clan', 'up', 'bedding', 'Cecilia', 'accused', 'Cecilia', 'scheming', 'sister', 'seducing', 'as', 'well', 'accusations', 'lead', 'being', 'banished', 'twenty', 'years', 'respective', 'convent/monastery', 'Arn', 'simply', 'back', 'where', 'started', 'course', 'not', 'long', 'sent', 'off', 'fight', 'Crusades', 'Twenty', 'years', 'judge', 'states', 'lifetime', 'long', 'time', 'Cecilia', 'wait', 'Arn', 'returns', 'Fortunately', 'Cecilia', 'wo', ""n't"", 'age', 'year', 'Unfortunately', 'half', 'hour', 'get', 'point.Arn', 'Swedish', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'presenting', 'historically', 'accurate', 'narrative', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'summary', 'gave', 'above', 'more', 'compelling', 'way', 'movie', 'out', 'actually', 'hacked', 'up', 'version', 'much', 'longer', 'miniseries', 'shows.At', 'movie', 'drags', 'When', 'Arn', 'sit', 'down', 'Saladin', 'yes', 'THE', 'Saladin', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'When', 'Cecilia', 'pines', 'Arn', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'When', 'Cecilia', 'cheesy', 'cross', 'Arn', 'can', 'guess', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'back', 'bloodied', 'hand', 'very', 'end', 'story', 'obvious', 'plot', 'points', 'would', 'be', 'excusable', 'editor', 'made', 'effort', 'provide', 'suspense', 'drama', 'anything', 'beat-by-beat', 'retelling', 'two', 'different', 'tales', 'only', 'also', 'complete', 'lack', 'acting', 'makeup', 'Arn', 'beard', 'make', 'look', 'little', 'more', 'grizzled', 'Cecilia', ""n't"", 'age', 'day', 'get', 'impression', 'director', 'Peter', 'Flinth', 'proud', 'fact', 'movie', 'artifice', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'distracting.Beautifully', 'shot', 'real', 'locations', 'dizzying', 'array', 'languages', 'accents', 'ethnicities', 'Arn', 'feels', 'epic', 'dire', 'need', 'epic', 'editor']",N/A

Yes, it's a foreign film and maybe that's why the director was able to get away showing a tale of violence without being disgusting, romance without being raunchy, a complete lack of PC clich&eacute;s or anachronistic profanity and the portrayal of medieval Europeans with dignity. If you're not usually down with foreign films then please don't be quick to write this one off.  First, the dialogue comes at a pace that will be familiar to American audiences, in other words the subtitles aren't rapid-fire (I was actually playing a video game while watching most of it and was able to keep up).  Second, directors around the world, I believe, appreciate the style of Hollywood filming techniques and therefore adapt the methods while excluding shallow scriptwriting or the need to inundate the screen with non-stop action or include Tom Cruise in every flipping production.  Also, as far as I could tell, there are no pixilated armies of hundreds of thousands packing the screen in every battle sequence; I think they actually used real people for the extras!The Story: A young nobleman is raised in a monastery but receives martial training from an ex Templar and is eventually sent back to his family after it becomes apparent that a cloistered life may not be his destiny.  Upon returning home he champions his father during a dispute with a rival faction making enemies and subsequently begins a romantic relationship with another nobleman's daughter (Cecilia) that is resented by her jealous sister.  Unfortunately the sister goes overboard in her spite by accusing the lovers of serious depravity resulting in both being excommunicated and a subsequent penance with Cecilia in a convent while Arn goes off to the crusades in hopes of redemption.The viewer may note similarities with another fairly recent, medieval flick (i.e. Kingdom of Heaven) but I think I prefer this story to that of Ridley Scott's, who removed the heart from Christian Europe and inserted modern cynicism and sentimentality resulting in a visually gorgeous but overall hollow story. This film may not have the typical Hollywood budget, often rivaling the GDP of many countries, but I think it's the film that Kingdom should have been and harkens back to movies like El Cid and even more recently Braveheart (it was Gibson afterall who redefined the genre of period, action films and even movie-making in general).

In Sweden this was two films that ran to over 250 minutes. Here they have been melded down to 130 minutes. So I have some sympathy for the negative reviews that have called this a mish, mash etc. However, it is still a ruddy good effort.Arn is schooled in a monastery as a way of thanking God for saving his life after an illness (not uncommon practice). He leans more towards archery and sword play than Bible study and so his path to serving God as a soldier is pretty much mapped out. He falls for the daughter of a rival clan and as punishment she gets sent to a nunnery and he has to go off to the Holy Land and serve with the Knights Templar. This is not the story of the Crusades but does deal with it in part, but not very well for historical purists, but the real story here is the love story between Arn and Cecilia, and I felt that there was chemistry and thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting is all pretty much on the money and the cinematography is excellent. And it is epic in the cast and also battle scenes, though I have seen better, but that is a small point. Joakim Natterqvist and Sofia Helin are both excellent and Simon Callow is there for us Brits. Whilst there is the usual 'poetic licence' taken with the plot, this just adds to the narrative and helps sweep yopu and the plot along.There have been complaints about the language and I see that might be a problem for some, it is mainly English, but with dialogue in Swedish, Arabic and Latin; I found the subtitles very good and in no way detracted from my enjoyment. However both the Amazon description and the DVD box do not mention the foreign language which has upset a few people.

It contains so much passion with some great performances within its structure.
