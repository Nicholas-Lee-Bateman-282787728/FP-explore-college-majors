It's an exploration of the human mind under many perspectives, where the kidnapping by itself is not the center of gravity of the story. So let`s go by parts.A wealthy Freddy Heineken has turned his company into a legendary Empire, a national symbol. So, we have the drama. A weak spirit who becomes alcoholic due his limitations to reach higher positions in the company. This attitude will take him to be fired. His son, filled of frustration and comprhensible angry, begins to accumulate hate and fury respect Heineken. On the other side we have other outlaws of the system who collide making come true this nasty act.In this sense, Heineken's captivity is the best evidence of this hate. The physical and psychological tortures he will have to endure will display the first half of the film.But, once he is released, another emotional and legal forces will take place, where the kidnappers will be the prey, just because the legal system is unable to react before this fact with the severity you or me would expect.A very complex film that works out in many levels.

1545186,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0083H6AUG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 5]","If I'm being honest, ""The Heineken Kidnapping"" is one of the most frustrating films that I've endeavored to review in a very long time. This Dutch film by Maarten Treurniet has a fantastic true life story to draw from, but fails to provide much insight into the actual event even as it covers a lot of ground. Based in fact (although with the usual dramatic liberties), the film revolves around the 1983 case in which Freddy Heineken (yes, the brewing mogul) was abducted and held for ransom over a three week period. The culprits were low level, relatively inexperienced Amsterdam criminals who extracted millions for the industrialist only to be immediately ensnared in an International manhunt. Sounds like a great idea for a movie! And let me just say that ""The Heineken Kidnapping"" is an exceedingly well made and well acted movie. What frustrates me, however, is that its focus is so broad--you end up understanding very little about the actual incident. I don't feel as if the characters (either Heineken or the kidnappers) are developed in much depth. The details of the kidnapping aren't delineated very well, the police investigation is only hinted at, the trial aspect is fairly vague. At no point do I think the film's screenplay really mines the material for what its worth. This should have been and could have been absolutely riveting and unforgettable. But here's the rub. Despite these huge reservations, I still liked ""The Heineken Kidnapping"" and I'm not sure I should have.The great Rutger Hauer plays Freddy Heineken. While he has the gravitas and screen presence to keep you involved, he doesn't have much to do until the film's second half. The first part of the movie introduces the quartet of guys who are staging the crime. The central character is a young man by the name of Rem who actually masterminds the idea of abducting Heineken and brings it to the group. Young, volatile, and with a grudge against Heineken, Rem is portrayed as a fairly normal youth until he turns into a completely unrepentant sociopath. I never particularly felt that the script connected to his character, which it fundamentally needed to do. I never identified with him, the other three kidnappers, Heineken, or any of the other peripheral characters. With this distance to the characters, the movie loses some emotional impact. The story, however, is so incredible that it might even make up for this disconnect. But once again, the script refuses to dig into the details of the case. Seriously, I know very little more about the incident than before I watched the movie. Anyone expecting this to be the definitive story will surely be confounded by everything it DOESN'T tell you.Sounds like I hated it. But that's just it, I really didn't. I think that the movie severely fails to live up to its true potential, but I still enjoyed it. It's always a pleasure to see Hauer and Reinout Scholten van Aschat (as Rem) has a fascinating intensity. As the story takes Heineken from the victim to the pursuer, it's an interesting angle to explore. The movie looks terrific and all of the actors are quite good despite the limitations of the screenplay. Individual scenes are well constructed and several action sequences are expertly staged. And I did get a kick from the big finale. I'm giving ""The Heineken Kidnapping"" a four star rating for these reasons, although it might just as well have been three stars for the others. With this cast and crew, ""The Heineken Kidnapping"" easily had the potential to be one of the year's best films. It falls short of that designation for sure, but it's a fascinating story nevertheless.

1545188,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0083H6AUG,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","In 1983 Freddy Heineken head of the brewing giant that reaches the parts other beers just can not reach, was reached himself by a gang of petty criminals and along with his chauffer was kidnapped. They demanded a ransom of 35 million guilders. For those that know what happened to say anymore would be like saying of the film `Titanic' that it sank and there would be no surprises, but as I did not know an iota about this I will say no more of how it turned out.The kidnappers were quite ruthless especially Rem as depicted in the film. It was his idea and he was the nastiest toward Mr Heinken, this is explained away as him blaming Mr Heineken for his father's alcoholism. His father having been a sales rep for twenty years for the company and saying there was an `unwritten law' that they had to drink with the punters - sounds like my ideal jib to be honest. Well Rem's father now runs a fancy dress shop but is slowly dying and Rem uses some of the wigs and stuff as disguises to `case the joint' as is the underworld parlance. These are of the type famously sported by Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films, and gave me a mild chuckle.Well they go for the heist and what transpires next is a truly engaging and twisty tale. Mr Heineken is played by screen legend Rutger Hauer and he is rather good managing to licit both empathy for his predicament and a bit of loathing for his use of influence and wealth, and I spotted him drinking wine in one shot so not a good advert for his company either. As a side the real Heineken company paid millions of dollars to get James Bond to drink a bottle of their Export in the last Bond film! One of the kidnappers is a bit psycho that is Frans and Rem does the dirty and goes for his `mol' type girlfriend, so we have the inter rival shenanigans as well as the extra marital goings on with Jimmy the vino drinker to all add to the mix.I really enjoyed this film and then did my research and found there are a few inaccuracies, one being there were five kidnappers and not four as portrayed but the team were threatened by one of the crims for using him, so all very forgivable. It lasts just over two hours and is in Dutch and a bit Of English and a tad of French, all sub titled reasonably well though not always literal.

1545189,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0083H6AUG,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","As the film's title suggests, ""The Heineken Kidnapping"" (""De Heineken Ontvoering"") follows the story of a real-life kidnapping case of Alfred Henry (Freddy) Heineken in 1983, president (and grandson of the founder) of the namesake brewing company. Freddy and his chauffeur Ab Doderer were abducted by four masked men in front of the office and imprisoned for three weeks before they were finally released.The Dutch film directed by Maarten Treurniet is short on detail about the kidnapping and its subsequent police investigation. The film pays more attention to the psychological aspects of those who were involved, especially Freddy Heineken (Rutger Hauer) and a young kidnapper Rem (Reinout Scholten van Aschat), whose father was formerly employed by the company Heineken. The story plays out more like a morality tale with characters, who, vulnerable in different ways, represent two opposite and contrasting social strata.This is the strength and weakness of ""The Heineken Kidnapping,"" which, instead of revealing much about the crime and the complicated legal procedures that follow, attempts to shed light into the inner thoughts of the kidnapper(s) and the kidnapped, carefully balancing between the two sides.I did a quick research on the net and found that filmmakers took creative liberty in recreating some key points including the number of the kidnappers and their names. So the film's crime element is only part of the story, which spends more time on ""who they are"" than ""what they do.""This is a worthy attempt, but sadly the film does not offer much insight into what drives them to desperate actions. Don't get me wrong.
