842652,A37UPPF989N4EB,B0002OXVEG,"JKO ""A Doctor Who Viewer""","[37, 37]","As most Doctor Who fans know, there are huge gaps in the archives for the black and white era of the show that featured the first two actors to play the role, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. Due to a total disregard for archiving material and, criminally, as a cost cutting exercise, there was a systematic junking policy for `expired' TV shows across many broadcast networks through to the 1970's. In many ways, Doctor Who fared better than most with many complete stories surviving either in private hands or more often by happy accidents.Although anything to have survived is miraculous, in many cases, irritatingly, stories were left incomplete on the archive shelves. Pretty much useless to any broadcaster and indeed seemingly for home DVD or video release. But the bright guys at the BBC have spotted a way to gather up all this stray material and package it together on a collection of three discs featuring not only eighteen complete episodes but a whole myriad of other snippets and gems from the vaults.As a huge Doctor Who fan, I was thrilled to see all these homeless relics gathered together, but from a wider commercial viewpoint, I don't think it's a particularly interesting project. But isn't it wonderful for fans to be indulged in this way? I'd never seen either episodes of The Faceless Ones before, so this was a real treat, as it was to see the newly discovered gem from The Daleks' Master Plan.The problem for me is that alone, or even where two or more episodes exist, it's exceptionally frustrating to watch what remains of these stories. If you're watching episode one for example, you're completely hooked by the end and then hugely disappointed that there is no more! For stories that just have the odd episode from the middle of the story, it's enough to drive you barmy. My biggest irritation came from watching episode 4 of The Celestial Toymaker. What on earth is going on? It would have been so, so much better had the DVD contained a synopsis of what was missing to help flesh out some of the material and put things into context. Definitely an opportunity missed. In a step towards this, there are soundtracks included for two missing episodes from The Crusade and The Moonbase, which does help complete those stories, but since photos exist of both missing episodes, why weren't they included? When all there is to hear is music or sound effects, it leaves you bewildered as to what might be happening. A photo or a subtitle would have been so much more effective.Also gathered from the cutting room floor are many, many short clips (in some cases, don't blink or you'll miss them) from other completely deleted episodes. It's sad that in so many cases these split second clips are all that have remained. There's also a lot of home movie footage, which is really interesting. I believe this to be the only color examples of footage from the era and although short, they are wonderful to see.We can but hope that as time goes on, some of the missing material will turn up. No one would have thought the complete Tomb of the Cybermen would suddenly reappear in 1992. So hope springs eternal. Until then, here's some classic Who, brilliantly restored and remastered to enjoy.",4,Lost in time... but worth the find!,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,3218,"['most', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'know', 'are', 'huge', 'gaps', 'archives', 'black', 'white', 'era', 'show', 'featured', 'first', 'two', 'actors', 'play', 'role', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'Due', 'total', 'disregard', 'archiving', 'material', 'criminally', 'cost', 'cutting', 'exercise', 'was', 'systematic', 'junking', 'policy', 'expired', 'TV', 'shows', 'many', 'broadcast', 'networks', '1970', 'many', 'ways', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fared', 'better', 'most', 'many', 'complete', 'stories', 'surviving', 'either', 'private', 'hands', 'more', 'often', 'happy', 'anything', 'have', 'survived', 'miraculous', 'many', 'cases', 'irritatingly', 'stories', 'were', 'left', 'incomplete', 'archive', 'shelves', 'Pretty', 'much', 'useless', 'broadcaster', 'indeed', 'seemingly', 'home', 'DVD', 'video', 'release', 'bright', 'guys', 'BBC', 'have', 'spotted', 'way', 'gather', 'up', 'stray', 'material', 'package', 'together', 'collection', 'three', 'discs', 'featuring', 'not', 'only', 'eighteen', 'complete', 'episodes', 'whole', 'myriad', 'other', 'snippets', 'gems', 'vaults.As', 'huge', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'homeless', 'relics', 'gathered', 'together', 'wider', 'commercial', 'viewpoint', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'project', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'fans', 'be', 'indulged', 'way', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'episodes', 'Faceless', 'Ones', 'before', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'was', 'see', 'newly', 'discovered', 'gem', 'Daleks', 'Master', 'Plan.The', 'problem', 'alone', 'even', 'where', 'two', 'more', 'episodes', 'exist', 'exceptionally', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'what', 'stories', ""'re"", 'watching', 'episode', 'one', 'example', ""'re"", 'completely', 'hooked', 'end', 'then', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'more', 'stories', 'just', 'have', 'odd', 'episode', 'middle', 'story', 'enough', 'drive', 'barmy', 'biggest', 'irritation', 'came', 'watching', 'episode', '4', 'Celestial', 'Toymaker', 'What', 'earth', 'going', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'DVD', 'contained', 'synopsis', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'material', 'put', 'things', 'context', 'Definitely', 'opportunity', 'missed', 'step', 'are', 'soundtracks', 'included', 'two', 'missing', 'episodes', 'Crusade', 'Moonbase', 'help', 'complete', 'stories', 'photos', 'exist', 'missing', 'episodes', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'When', 'hear', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'bewildered', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'happening', 'photo', 'subtitle', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'effective.Also', 'gathered', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'short', 'clips', 'cases', 'do', ""n't"", 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'other', 'completely', 'deleted', 'episodes', 'sad', 'so', 'many', 'cases', 'split', 'second', 'clips', 'are', 'have', 'remained', 'also', 'lot', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'really', 'interesting', 'believe', 'be', 'only', 'color', 'examples', 'footage', 'era', 'short', 'are', 'wonderful', 'see.We', 'can', 'hope', 'time', 'missing', 'material', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'complete', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'would', 'suddenly', 'reappear', '1992', 'hope', 'springs', 'eternal', 'then', 'here', 'classic', 'Who', 'brilliantly', 'restored', 'remastered', 'enjoy']",N/A
842653,A3I312N7ISZ960,B0002OXVEG,"Mr. Nicholas Pearson ""Cert HE (Open)""","[3, 4]","William Hartnell is fast becoming one of my favourite incarnations of the famous Time Lord, The Doctor.  Since the 2005 revival of the Doctor Who television franchise, I have been following with bated breath the Saturday evening adventures of the 'Last Son of Galifrey'.  In my opinion, what has given Doctor Who it's longevity, is the idea of 'regeneration', in which The Doctor is able to change the form of his physical body upon death.  This was shown in the revival series with Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston regenerating into the Tenth Doctor, played by David Tennant and subsequently Matt Smith has taken the reigns as the Eleventh incarnation.Upon my initial discovery of this wonderful television phenomenon, I decided to serve my curiosity of what has gone before by researching what is termed as 'Classic Who'.  I now believe I am quite well-versed with the adventures of the First Incarnation of the Doctor (played by William Hartnell) and his subsequent audio adventures, along with his male and female companions.  Unfortunately, there is a chunk of these serial adventures that are missing from the BBC Archives, following the 1970s/80s purging of back-dated media programs.  Over the years, there has been a constant search for these lost stories, and sometimes episodes are found and given back to the BBC.  These finds can range from a whole serial, individual episodes or a few very short clips, and it is a collection of these 'lost and found' episodes that are included on this DVD.'The Crusade' was broadcast during Doctor Who's second season in March of 1965, and the serial concerned the historical events of the Third Crusade, with the regular Tardis crew in the company of King Richard the Lionheart, and the Saracen outlaws.  This historical serial was previously released on VHS alongside 'The Space Museum.  However, because only two out of four episodes presently survive in the BBC Archives (Episodes 1 & 3), an Audio CD was included with the linking soundtrack to episodes 2 & 4.  A special introduction and linking narration was specially made by William Russell in character as Ian Chesterson, and it is this release that is included on this DVD as the first 'lost' story, along with the linking soundtrack to the missing episodes in audio form.  This also includes an interesting optional audio commentary on Episode 3 with Julian Glover, who played Sir Richard and Gary Russell.The second incomplete serial included is 'The Daleks' Master Plan' - of which only three out of twelve episodes have been found.  This serial is the most sought after and includes the first on-screen death of a companion, Katerina of Ancient Greece, alongside the appearance of Jean Marsh as would-be companion Sara Kingdom, who was also killed in this story.  It is inevitably fairly difficult to follow the events of this story with only three episodes to work with, so it is probably better to look up the initial preface of the serial first in order to grasp the overall plot.  The episodes themselves look fantastic and the BBC Restoration Team have, once again, done a brilliant job in cleaning up these forgotten gems.  Also included with this serial is another interesting, optional audio commentary on Episode 2, with Peter Purves and Kevin Stoney, who played Steven Taylor and Mavic Chen respectively, alongside set designer Raymond Cusick and moderator Gary Russell.The third and final serial, 'The Celestial Toymaker', has just one episode out of four included (Episode 4), and this involves The Doctor, Steven and Dodo attempting to 'play' their way out of the realm of the Toymaker.  Again, it is better to know the overall preface of the story beforehand, but it is still an enjoyable lone episode, which leads directly into the the next complete serial, 'The Gunfighters' - recently released on DVD.With a few extra surviving clips and extant footage of other missing serials of the William Hartnell era, this surmises the overall content of the DVD.  For some, it may be a little confusing and it is worth researching some background knowledge on the missing serials in order to place where you are in the continuum of the series.  Maybe, in the future, animation technology will allow for these lost stories to be 'found' again, but, for now, this is as far as we Whovians will get to experiencing the missing stories in visual format, having had their original television soundtracks released on Audio CD and download (which I definitely recommend exploring in order to bridge the gap between said lost/missing serials!).",4,A

While the first and third episode are actually there, you still get at least the audio for the second and forth episodes--PLUS Ian Chesterton's recollections to help fill in some gaps if you want to skip the audio. That was kind of a kick to see him ""all grown up.""It also has Story 21: The Dalek's Master Plan--which I was completely lost on. The original story from season 3 had been created using episodes 10-21. All you get here are 11,14, and 19. You know, coming in on the second episode wasn't so terrible, but then skipping two more and coming back in was horrible, and then going to the third to last--where The Monk somehow gets back in--was just too much. If they had provided audio--which I understand if it wasn't possible--or someone to fill in gaps like they had Ian do, I think it would have been more tolerable. But such as it is, it only frustrated me.And then finally, they had one solitary episode from Story 24.
