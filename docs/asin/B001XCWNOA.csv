You can absolutely tell this was made by a witty writer (Felicia Day), who knows a thing or two about gaming and the culture.

Hill ""CFH""","[0, 0]","The second season of ""The Guild"" picks up shortly after the events covered in season 1 and it is still one of the cleverest series I have ever seen. This season has 12 episodes (there were 10 episodes in season one) and they retain the same basic format where each one opens with Cyd setting the stage talking to us on her webcam. The episodes are fairly short, but they are packed full of good acting and humor that almost anyone who spends time on-line will be able to relate to. Felicia Day is great as Cyd Sherman (an ""On-Line Game Addict"") and her alter ego ""Codex"" (cleric/healer) who mixes her real life with her on-line life. Her problems and the individual neuroses of the other characters (both live and game characters) are explored in greater detail, often with actual laugh out loud results.This is a very good series and the DVD is reasonably priced.

""The Guild - Season Two"" throws a bunch of new problems at our favorite gang of gaming nerds -- the woes of romancing a neighbor, guys engaging in guy time, and the devastating threat of server down time! It's even funnier than the first season.Codex and Zaboo move into a new apartment, since Zaboo's mom got her evicted from her old one. But her apartment comes with a bonus: a sexy stuntman that Codex desperately wants to impress. At the same time, she manages to unload Zaboo on Vork as his new roommate, despite the fact that Vork is completely insane (his house looks like a ""before"" picture from ""Hoarders"").Meanwhile, Tinkerballa (Amy Okuda) uses her feminine charms to get stuff from Bladezz, and Clara gets POed at Vork after she fails to get a cosmetic orb. Then the Guild is hit by a terrifying threat: four hours of server downtime! How will they cope with four hours of the real world? One word: PARTY. Several words: wild party that will involve fighting, kissing and betrayal.""The Guild - Season Two"" is actually even more fun than the first season. It has the same basic story -- personal conflict within the Guild -- but the writers mix it up with some wildly different subplots. The biggest one would be Codex awkwardly trying to have a ""normal"" romance, especially considering how neurotic she is at the best of times.The rest of the time, we're bounced between a trio of lesser subplots that are there just long enough to be hilarious. The dialogue practically overflows with hilarious dialogue poking fun at the many social defects of the gamers (""When I visited Codex today, she was interacting with another male. It was akin to a mating ritual. Had they been baboons, her nether regions would have been slightly swollen and ruby red""). And all the subplots come to a boil at the extremely disastrous party.Felicia Day is even more entertaining in this season, since it has her attempting to interact normally with non-gamer people -- some of whom are almost as weird as she is (Hot Stuntman makes her puke with his zombie makeup). Meanwhile, we see just how nasty Clara can be (and what a party animal!), and get a look at just what a freakshow Vork's life is.""The Guild Season Two"" is dork magic at its absolutely best -- socially awkward people, massive misunderstandings... and squab.

1245008,A1H8JUI9GNQKNR,B001XCWNOA,Harold Harefoot,"[0, 0]","Is there anything Felicia can't do?  I haven't seen her try bull riding or playing baseball - maybe one of those is her Achilles' Heel.  When it comes to writing a web-series she created, acting in that web-series, singing in someone else's web series (Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog) or acting on a regular tv show (Dollhouse episode #13), she doesn't seem to have any peers.  The Guild is laugh-a-minute hilarity about a group of online gamers who have had the misfortune of meeting each other in real life.  It's mostly about Felicia's character, Codex (who does a preamble vlog to begin each episode), but it's also about the other five members of the Knights of Good guild - a more flawed group of people you've never met.  Of course, it's their many flaws that make them so incredibly interesting and funny.  The main storyline revolves around Codex's attempts at either having or avoiding a love life.  The other characters have their own problems that they are trying to cope with.  That these six completely different personalities all wound up in the same guild makes for insane interactions between them as their expectations of each other are often way off the mark (Yes, Bladezz and Tink, I'm especially thinking of you two.)  I won't go into specific storylines, as that would give away too much.  Just go ahead and buy it - you'll enjoy it.  Oh, I forgot to mention the killer extras - the commentaries and other extras aren't online and they make the dvd worth buying all by themselves.

Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","Having gotten character development out of the way, the second season of The Guild is able to focus on what every fanboy wants: more of Codex (Felicia Day).  The outside world finally intrudes in the form of a handsome stuntman named Wade (Fernando Chien).  Convinced that Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh) is ruining her chances at a date with Wade, she offloads Zaboo to Vork (Jeff Lewis).  Hilarity ensues.Vork's mannerisms and precise accounting of everything he does is reminiscent of gamers in desperate situations we all know. It's precisely why these gamers play so often.  Vork's own pathetic rings true: his grandfather passed away and Vork lives off of his social security checks. When Zaboo moves in with Vork, it's like the odd couple for the millennial generation.Meanwhile, we get more insight into Clara's (Robin Thorsen) family. Clara's children derail her quest to retrieve an orb that allows editing a character's appearance, an ability undervalued by the men but coveted by the female gamers. Tinkerballa (Amy Okuda) wins the orb in a bid, setting the hilarious Clara on a revenge streak against Vork that involves multiplaying, lying to her sister, and leaving her husband to take care of the kids. As if that weren't enough drama, Bladezz (Vincent Caso) has fallen to Tinnkerballa's considerable charms and plans to woo her with gifts.When the game goes on hiatus for hours, it's time for a boys' and girls' night out. What starts out segregated by gender eventually collides in a ping-ponging spiral of egos, alcohol, and hurt feelings. Or to put it another way: comedy gold.The Guild has one finger on modern dating insecurities and another on gamer culture.  Day knows exactly where to aim her barbed pen.

It is cheaper and more convenient. While I dearly love this show, there is not a lot of content. It would be much nicer to have all the content on one disc than having to switch from one disc to another.THE GUILD is one of the most successful direct-to-Internet series yet produced. It was created and is written by and stars Felecia Day, who starred, along with Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, in what is by far the most successful Internet-first project ever, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG. The series concerns a group of people who would normally have nothing to do with one another, but have been drawn together by playing World of Warcraft together. For though who have never played WoW (I suppose such individuals exist), one of the things that you can do in WoW is form guilds who quest together. From personal experience I can attest that you end up forming online friendships with people you normally would not spend much time with. If you have played WoW, the show has lots of subtleties that will seem familiar and fun. I've intentionally avoided meeting anyone that I play online with, but these poor souls decide to meet in person. (Though I never join guilds for person reasons. I detest PvP [Player versus Player] and WoW is structured so that if one member of a guild fights a member of another guild, all members of each guild are thereby opposed to one another. Since I could not find a way to be a member of a guild and not PvP, I played solo, which luckily isn't that hard to do in WoW. BTW, I stopped playing WoW after maxing out several characters because of the staggering amount of time that gaming can absorb. Never going to get that book written playing WoW.)The Guild consists of: Codex (her online name), played by Felecia Day; Zaboo, a Hinjew (half Indian/half Jewish) who stalks Codex; Vork, an early middle-aged loser who lives in his dead grandfather's house (he lives off cashing his granddad's social security checks, and who is also a world-class tightwad and the titular head of the guild); Clara, the mother of three toddlers that she neglects to play online; Tinkerballa, a cute Asian girl who is so obsessed with gaming that she plays Gameboy while also playing WoW; and Bladezz, a long-haired teen who is not the most popular character on the show in Season One. This exceedingly odd collection of individuals unhappily linked with one another provides a host of funny moments that shouldn't be missed.Felecia Day has pretty much established herself as the hottest female actress on the Internet. Though many knew her from her Season Seven appearance on BUFFY as one of the Potentials, most of her work has been away from either film or television. DR. HORRIBLE made her on online star, a status that was quickly reinforced by the beginning of THE GUILD. She also starred in the great, though unaired episode of DOLLHOUSE ""Epitaph One,"" which many regard as the best episode of DOLLHOUSE. But again, unless you watch it on DVD, you won't see it at all. Most recently she has become even more popular due to a music video based on THE GUILD ""going viral."" If you haven't seen ""Would You Like to Date My Avatar?"" do so immediately. Starring Day and the rest of the cast of THE GUILD, with music written by Jed Whedon (the brother of Joss), it is a delightful send up of online socializing. The song is infectious, the performances delightful, and the lyrics witty. And it completes the whole DR. HORRIBLE-""Epitaph One,"" and music video trilogy. Jed Whedon co-wrote DR. HORRIBLE and ""Epitaph One"" with his wife Maurissa Tancharoen, and Maurissa is one of the performing dancers in the music video (she is one of the female dancers who back up Tinkerballa). And Felecia Day starred in all three. She is so adorable that I'd love to see her translate her online and DVD success to film and TV. Until then, we have this delightful online series.

Ms. Day has taken the players that she has played with and has somehow boiled them down to 5 personalities, the likes of which everyone runs across in the gaming realm.The real treat on this DVD is the extras.  There are quite a few.  Two excellent commentary tracks, gag reels, and...well, I don't want to ruin it all but I also found an Easter Egg (hilarious).It is funny because even though you can watch all these episodes for free online or via Xbox Live, I would still recommend that you pick up this DVD.  It is a must have.  The way the series Spaced captured a very specific time period of pop culture, The Guild captures the present period.  Kudos to all who worked on this and made it possible.",5,Epic Win,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,1001,"['no-brainer', 'Guild', 'wonder', 'web', 'series', 'lives', 'group', 'on-line', 'gamers', 'What', 'series', 'so', 'wonderful', 'clear', 'written', 'someone', 'who', ""'writing"", 'what', 'true', 'delight', 'show', 'group', 'dynamic', 'Ms.', 'Day', 'taken', 'players', 'played', 'somehow', 'boiled', 'down', '5', 'personalities', 'likes', 'everyone', 'gaming', 'realm.The', 'real', 'treat', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'Two', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'gag', 'reels', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'also', 'found', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'hilarious', '.It', 'funny', 'even', 'can', 'watch', 'episodes', 'free', 'online', 'Xbox', 'Live', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'way', 'series', 'Spaced', 'captured', 'very', 'specific', 'time', 'period', 'pop', 'culture', 'Guild', 'present', 'period', 'Kudos', 'who', 'worked', 'made', 'possible']",The Guild: Season 2
1245015,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B001XCWNOA,Terry Mesnard,"[10, 10]","I wrote in my first review of Season 1 of The Guild how charming and spectacular the show is; not to mention, how shocking it is that the show has come so far as to be released on DVD.  Everything about the first season can be repeated here, kind of negating a need for a review.Season 2 begins pretty much right where Season 1 ends.  Codex talks to her webcam, summarizing the events that happened after the first Season.  The story that follows deals mostly with a server outage for their game, forcing the members of the Knights of Good to deal with the real world.  What makes the second season so much better than the already excellent first is that, now that we've been introduced to the characters, they can be given room to grow.  Much more character development is given in this season and the show allows each character to have their individual storylines and key moments, splitting screen time a bit more evenly.  The witty writing and the hilarious situations that arise are still here, except I found this season even more humorous than the first.The story climaxes at a hilarious party that leaves on a bittersweet cliffhanger of an ending.  So it's a good thing that Season Three is just around the corner.  If you haven't given The Guild a chance, go out and watch it now.  It's hilarious, witty and a perfect celebration of MMO geek lifestyle, but it can also be appreciated by people who have no knowledge of the lifestyle.  It's the rare beast that can cater to both the culture and those not in it.",5,Surprisingly better than the first season!,1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,1518,"['wrote', 'first', 'review', 'Season', '1', 'Guild', 'how', 'charming', 'spectacular', 'show', 'not', 'mention', 'how', 'shocking', 'show', 'come', 'so', 'far', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Everything', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'repeated', 'here', 'kind', 'negating', 'need', 'review.Season', '2', 'pretty', 'much', 'right', 'where', 'Season', '1', 'ends', 'Codex', 'talks', 'webcam', 'summarizing', 'events', 'happened', 'first', 'Season', 'story', 'deals', 'mostly', 'server', 'outage', 'game', 'forcing', 'members', 'Knights', 'Good', 'deal', 'real', 'world', 'What', 'second', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'already', 'excellent', 'first', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'introduced', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'room', 'grow', 'Much', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'given', 'season', 'show', 'character', 'have', 'individual', 'storylines', 'key', 'moments', 'splitting', 'screen', 'time', 'bit', 'more', 'evenly', 'witty', 'writing', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'arise', 'are', 'still', 'here', 'found', 'season', 'even', 'more', 'humorous', 'first.The', 'story', 'climaxes', 'hilarious', 'party', 'bittersweet', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'good', 'thing', 'Season', 'Three', 'just', 'corner', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'Guild', 'chance', 'go', 'out', 'watch', 'now', 'hilarious', 'witty', 'perfect', 'celebration', 'MMO', 'geek', 'lifestyle', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'appreciated', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'knowledge', 'lifestyle', 'rare', 'beast', 'can', 'cater', 'culture', 'not']",The Guild: Season 2
