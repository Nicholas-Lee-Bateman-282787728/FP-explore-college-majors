It had a lot of great shorts and the making of dog city (shown by dogs). It was great. My sister got me this when I was in the hospital and was stoked and brought a smile. The movie is great, but not having behind the scenes, bean bunny trailers, kermit going crazy trying to find the reel to the film, and a robot guy or whatever is just highly disappointed. But shouldn't let it stop you from seeing this.",3,Highly disappointed for only the movie.,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,543,"['So', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'remember', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'introduced', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Hour', 'deal', 'had', 'lot', 'great', 'shorts', 'making', 'dog', 'city', 'shown', 'dogs', 'was', 'great', 'sister', 'got', 'when', 'was', 'hospital', 'was', 'stoked', 'brought', 'smile', 'movie', 'great', 'not', 'having', 'scenes', 'bean', 'bunny', 'trailers', 'kermit', 'going', 'crazy', 'trying', 'find', 'reel', 'film', 'robot', 'guy', 'just', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'should', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'seeing']",N/A

I kind of hesitated in wanting to buy it because of that but still, where else can you get The Jim Henson Hour episodes legally? So I bought the DVD, waiting and expecting a bad menu or something and suddenly I hear The Jim Henson Hour theme playing and that just brought a smile to my face. And also the behind the scenes photo gallery featuring a late Jim Henson on the set of Dog City looking at everything in a classic thinking pose. Awesome special feature. But still I yearn for The Jim Henson Hour complete series. This is good for an economic priced DVD but there should be a complete series for us collectors / Jim Henson Muppet fans know what I mean? But other then that, the film segment of the episode is uncut and uncensored. Buggy Them's Machine Gun and All! :) Nice an PG! Or what Buggy Them would say ""Senseless Violence, just the way I love it"" lol But what's amazing about this was, it was when The Jim Henson Company was slightly going more towards a satirical view within the later work which of course would bring us one of the greatest satirical shows ever ""Dinosaurs"" which was Jim Henson's original idea but wasn't made until a year after his passing. Anyway, I give it 4, I would give it 5 but it's mainly because it's cut.",4,We need More Jim Henson Hour DVDs,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1425,"['many', 'have', 'said', 'first', 'half', 'ending', 'halfs', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Hour', 'episode', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'basically', 'just', 'Dog', 'City', 'film', 'part', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Hour', 'kind', 'hesitated', 'wanting', 'buy', 'still', 'where', 'else', 'can', 'get', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Hour', 'legally', 'So', 'bought', 'DVD', 'waiting', 'expecting', 'bad', 'menu', 'something', 'suddenly', 'hear', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Hour', 'theme', 'playing', 'just', 'brought', 'smile', 'face', 'also', 'scenes', 'photo', 'gallery', 'featuring', 'late', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'set', 'Dog', 'City', 'looking', 'everything', 'classic', 'thinking', 'pose', 'Awesome', 'special', 'feature', 'still', 'yearn', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Hour', 'complete', 'series', 'good', 'economic', 'priced', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'complete', 'series', 'collectors', '/', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Muppet', 'fans', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'other', 'then', 'film', 'segment', 'episode', 'uncut', 'uncensored', 'Buggy', 'Them', 'Machine', 'Gun', 'Nice', 'PG', 'what', 'Buggy', 'Them', 'would', 'say', 'Senseless', 'Violence', 'just', 'way', 'love', 'what', 'amazing', 'was', 'was', 'when', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Company', 'was', 'slightly', 'going', 'more', 'towards', 'satirical', 'view', 'later', 'work', 'course', 'would', 'bring', 'one', 'greatest', 'satirical', 'ever', 'Dinosaurs', 'was', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'original', 'idea', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'year', 'passing', 'Anyway', 'give', '4', 'would', 'give', '5', 'mainly', 'cut']",N/A
