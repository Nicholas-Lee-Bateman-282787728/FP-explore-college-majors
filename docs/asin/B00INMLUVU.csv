I've watched several episodes, and the &#34;lineup's&#34; been great.  Efrem and Colby are in top form as seasoned veterans. Amazon has the mod warning on them again, but that will only be after the studio runs out of the initial release. I think that the actual show looks excellent, I can't believe that there's only two more to go! Thanks to Amazon for making this available to their customers, especially our overseas neighbors.",5,Tuesday's,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,568,"['Release', 'day', ""'m"", 'always', 'hoping', 'surprise', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'been', 'great', 'releasing', 'vault', 'exception', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'episodes', '34', 'lineup', '34', 'been', 'great', 'Efrem', 'Colby', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'Amazon', 'mod', 'warning', 'again', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'studio', 'initial', 'release', 'think', 'actual', 'show', 'excellent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'only', 'two', 'more', 'go', 'Thanks', 'Amazon', 'making', 'available', 'customers', 'especially', 'overseas', 'neighbors']","FBI, The: The Complete Seventh Season"
