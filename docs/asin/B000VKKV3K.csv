Stupid people that feel guilt from fighting multiple wars simultaneously kill people.&#34;Is that the theme, or moral, of this overly-simplistic-and-obvious film that takes advantage of the mood of 2007, when the US was still fighting multiple wars on multiple fronts?  Luckily for us, since then, the US has ended those wars and closed Quantonomo Bay.  After all, the &#34;Great One&#34; promised to do these things, way back one year after this film released, when He was elected.&#34;What, we're still fighting wars, and Quantonomo Bay is still open?&#34; you ask incredulously, after five years of His leadership?  &#34;How can this be?&#34;  Well, when you make the statement, &#34;You didn't build that!&#34; followed by the lie of the year in 2013, &#34;You can keep it,&#34; you can pretty much say whatever you want.  After all, you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story.And the problem with this film:  it's neither the truth nor a good story.  The first film with Kevin Bacon surely had it's moments, and I gave it a mild recommendation.  It was kind of spooky, and the director allowed the tension to build slowly but surely.  But here, it's like taking a shell to the gut right out of the gate.  And those shells keep coming, which makes you want to, well, just duck and cover.And my recommendation would be:  instead of renting this film, just duck and cover.  Hide in a place that doesn't even have a TV, just in case &#34;Stir of Echoes 2:  Daddy's Home&#34; just happens to come on accidently.  Another piece of advice:  when someone says, &#34;You can keep it,&#34; or &#34;You didn't build that,&#34; just vote for the other guy.

Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 5]","If you remember the originalStir of Echoesstarring Kevin Bacon, It was a surprisingly good ghost story about a man whose mind is opened to the paranormal after a hypnosis session gone awry.  The film turns into a murder mystery as our hero struggles to comprehend what the ghost is telling him.Stir of Echoes: Homecoming attempts to capitalize on the original without much more in common than it being about a ghost trying to tell a tortured protagonist something.  Which is pretty much the plot of every ghost story ever.United States National Guard captain Ted Cogan's (Rob Lowe) command goes awry while serving in Iraq.  Cogan orders an allied tank to fire a warning shot at a vehicle approaching his checkpoint, but due to a miscommunication the tank fires ON the vehicle, killing everyone in it except for a young girl who is subsequently killed in a separate RPG attack. Wounded, Cogan wakes up from a coma back in the States.Cogan comes home to a family strained by the tolls of the Iraq war; wife Molly (Marnie McPhail) works double shifts to pay the bills, Max (Ben Lewis) has taken up smoking and hangs with a bad crowd, and Cogan grapples with his PTSD. To make matters worse, a burning ghost and visions of murder and suicide bedevil Cogan at every turn. The identity of the ghost is not so clear cut.Homecoming bridges the gap between civilian and military lives, bringing the war home so to speak, through the paranormal. On the surface it may seem antiwar, but it's surprisingly pro-soldier, detailing the struggles Cogan faces in paying his bills as a discharged soldier under investigation for the death of civilians, the lack of medical care for shell-shocked soldiers, and a civilian population who can't possibly understand what he's been through.  In that regard, Homecoming drives the point home that war is hell - not just on the battlefield, but at home.Unfortunately it drives the point home with a sledgehammer.  Homecoming's messages are poignant but occasionally forced.  Lowe does a passable job of a conflicted soldier, but the chemistry between he and McPhail is nonexistent. Lewis, who bears the majority of emotional scenes, struggles with his lines. The ending spirals and leaves Cogan with few options. When the ghost starts possessing Cogan, it robs the narrative of any moral dilemma by taking away personal choice.For all its flaws, Homecoming is an unflinching portrayal of the costs of war...that just happens to be a ghost movie. With such a burden to bear, there's not much hope of a happy ending.",4,A war movie that happens to be a ghost story,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2539,"['remember', 'originalStir', 'Echoesstarring', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'man', 'mind', 'opened', 'paranormal', 'hypnosis', 'session', 'gone', 'awry', 'film', 'murder', 'mystery', 'hero', 'comprehend', 'what', 'ghost', 'telling', 'him.Stir', 'Echoes', 'Homecoming', 'attempts', 'capitalize', 'original', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'being', 'ghost', 'trying', 'tell', 'tortured', 'protagonist', 'something', 'Which', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'ghost', 'story', 'ever.United', 'States', 'National', 'Guard', 'captain', 'Ted', 'Cogan', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'command', 'awry', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'Cogan', 'orders', 'allied', 'tank', 'fire', 'warning', 'shot', 'vehicle', 'approaching', 'checkpoint', 'due', 'miscommunication', 'tank', 'vehicle', 'killing', 'everyone', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'subsequently', 'killed', 'separate', 'RPG', 'attack', 'Wounded', 'Cogan', 'up', 'coma', 'back', 'States.Cogan', 'home', 'family', 'strained', 'tolls', 'Iraq', 'war', 'wife', 'Molly', 'Marnie', 'McPhail', 'double', 'shifts', 'pay', 'bills', 'Max', 'Ben', 'Lewis', 'taken', 'up', 'smoking', 'hangs', 'bad', 'crowd', 'Cogan', 'PTSD', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'burning', 'ghost', 'visions', 'murder', 'suicide', 'bedevil', 'Cogan', 'turn', 'identity', 'ghost', 'not', 'so', 'clear', 'cut.Homecoming', 'gap', 'civilian', 'military', 'lives', 'bringing', 'war', 'home', 'so', 'speak', 'paranormal', 'surface', 'may', 'seem', 'antiwar', 'surprisingly', 'pro-soldier', 'detailing', 'struggles', 'Cogan', 'paying', 'bills', 'discharged', 'soldier', 'investigation', 'death', 'civilians', 'lack', 'medical', 'care', 'shell-shocked', 'soldiers', 'civilian', 'population', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'understand', 'what', 'been', 'regard', 'Homecoming', 'point', 'home', 'war', 'hell', 'not', 'just', 'battlefield', 'home.Unfortunately', 'point', 'home', 'sledgehammer', 'Homecoming', 'messages', 'are', 'poignant', 'occasionally', 'forced', 'Lowe', 'passable', 'job', 'conflicted', 'soldier', 'chemistry', 'McPhail', 'nonexistent', 'Lewis', 'who', 'majority', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'struggles', 'lines', 'ending', 'spirals', 'Cogan', 'few', 'options', 'When', 'ghost', 'possessing', 'Cogan', 'narrative', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'taking', 'away', 'personal', 'choice.For', 'flaws', 'Homecoming', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'costs', 'war', 'just', 'be', 'ghost', 'movie', 'such', 'burden', 'bear', 'not', 'much', 'hope', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

Well, I finally did, and it turns out I was right to do so. The original Stir of Echoes was one of my favorite movies of 1999, though it never got the recognition it deserved (it was eclipsed by The Sixth Sense in much the same way Near Dark was eclipsed by The Lost Boys fifteen years before), and I was pretty sure any sequel, especially one that went straight to the morass of the Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie, was bound to tear out anything that made the original good and keep the lurid aspects without anchoring them to anything worthwhile. Seems I didn't need to watch the movie, as I pretty much had it dead-on already. But I sat down and watched it, more fool me.Plot: Ted Cogan (Rob Lowe), an Iraqi War vet, suffers a traumatic injury after his position is hit by an RPG shell. When he returns home, the fallout from that incident gets him branded a murderer. Worse, he finds he can see ghosts. Sound familiar? One in particular needs him to right an injustice. Sound even more familiar? Yeah, it's less Stir of Echoes than it is Sixth Sense, but without any of the excellent acting, original touches, or attention to detail that characterized both of those 1999 movies.

1102241,A387BD735MI50R,B000VKKV3K,R. Schultz,"[2, 3]","This movie features another avenging ghost, a somewhat pale pastiche of the spirit in ""The Grudge."" This haunt isn't as frightening because its popping up is too pat, and it is too laden with excrescence, making it almost reminiscent of ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon."" Such appearances end up bringing the apparition almost too close to campiness.However, this ""Stir of Echoes"" is unexpectedly, seriously good in another way. It very movingly portrays some of the tragedy and trauma coming out of the War in Iraq, actually doing a better job of this than many of the documentaries I've seen on the subject.The movie also takes an interesting turn. It rises above predictability and builds into some very telling character study.The film already seems to be a little dated in its portrayal of U.S. citizens' tendency to stereotype all Middle Eastern Muslims just after 9/11. Thankfully, most Americans seem to have gotten beyond such corrosive, knee-jerk prejudice.In addition to the more major charge that can be brought against this film for projecting some rather ludicrous apparitions - there are a few minor distractions about ""Echoes 2."" For one thing, Rob Lowe seems miscast - not in his role as U.S. soldier fighting in Iraq - but in his role as father to the young man he's trying to discipline at home. Lowe just seems too young to be this actor's father. I persistently wanted to transfer Lowe himself into the James Dean-like role of troubled, rebelling son.Also, the extras on the DVD aren't very good. The Director's Commentary doesn't add much to the understanding of the film or its making, and you can probably skip it.However, ""Echoes 2"" is a worthwhile film, not so much as a thriller as an exploration of certain emotional landscapes created in the wake of 9/11.
