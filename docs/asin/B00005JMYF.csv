Of all the jokes that are attempted there is only one that doesn't really work and that's Steve the Pirate.  He just seems like a character that isn't used very well, or even in the right way.  The character could obviously be the most dangerous comic character in awhile, but instead, the director just allows him to be ordinary, to seem like one of the guys, and even though one of the funniest jokes emmerges when Owen doesn't recognize that he's a pirate and then knowingly acknowledges it later in the film.  I think one of the things that makes the movie really funny is Ben Stiller's willingness to take a chance with his comedy and not care whether it's actually funny or not, he just goes the distance.  In terms of the DVD, it's first rate.  Yes, there's features and commentary, deleted scenes, etc, but there's an easter egg if you can find it, as a matter of fact there's a key to a number of them throughout the picture and hopefully you find them and enjoy them.

624013,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B00005JMYF,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[0, 1]","What is there to say about Dodgeball - A True Underdog Movie other than it's a no-brainer of a hilarious movie that doesn't aspire to lofty heights. What it does do is come out firing with some of the funniest physical comedy and one-liners since The Farrelly Brothers' Something About Mary. First time director Rawson Marshall Thurber does a good enough job to keep the laughs coming one right after the another to keep Dodgeball from becoming too repetitive.The movie is a riff from the stock underdog sports genre with a Peter La Fleur (played by Vince Vaughn with his usual sardonic wit) having to find a way to save his Average Joe's Gym from being foreclosed by his bank and turned by a rival hi-tech gym next door into a parking lot. Who else would be the perfect foil for Vince Vaughn's Peter La Fleur but none other than Ben Stiller as the former-fatty turned workout fitness Nazi, White Goodman. Goodman's Globo Gym is a state-of-the art, sterile and BALCO-like gym where insults and making its members feel ugly, fat and useless is the way to clean health and the perfect bod.Already, within the first fifteen minutes, we know who to root for and who to boo. In one corner we have the Average Joe's guys played with comedic timing by Justin Long, Stephen Root, Chris Williams, Alan Tudyk and Joel Moore. Stiller's Goodman and his consigliere Me'Shell (Jamal Duff channelling Barry White) with a hand-picked ringer of a dodgeball team he calls the Purple Cobras. With the two sides set the dodgeball carnage begins as Average Joe's must win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Invitational to earn the $50,000 needed to save the gym. To round out the Average Joe's team will be the bank accountant who ends up sympathizing with the Joe's, Kate Veatch (played by Stiller's real-life wife, Christine Taylor) and Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn in a scene-stealing role).Rip Torn is hilarious as the acerbic and insane former Dodgeball great Patches O'Houlihan. He pretty much gets all the best one-liners in the movie the moment he appears on the screen. He coaches the Average Joe's team by browbeating them, insulting them and, failing that, throwing wrenches at them to help them in learning the 5 D's of dodgeball: Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge. In fact, I would say that if it wasn't for Rip Torn's character dominating the middle part of the movie, I think Dodgeball's constant ball to the groin shots would've gotten old. Instead Patches O'Houlihan constantly gave people watching a reason to laugh out loud.Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story is a movie that the Academy voters will not think twice about showering with praises and awards, but I'm sure most of them will be watching it and laughing out loud like the rest of the movie-going public. Dodgeball is one hilarious, one-liner after one-liner ball to the nuts funny and it doesn't aspire to be anything else but that. This movie will never get old with each viewing and will continue to make people laugh out loud.",4,Dodgeball has the Patches O'Houlihan seal of approval,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,2973,"['What', 'there', 'say', 'Dodgeball', 'True', 'Underdog', 'Movie', 'other', 'no-brainer', 'hilarious', 'movie', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'lofty', 'heights', 'What', 'do', 'come', 'out', 'firing', 'funniest', 'physical', 'comedy', 'one-liners', 'Farrelly', 'Brothers', 'Something', 'Mary', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Rawson', 'Marshall', 'Thurber', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'keep', 'laughs', 'coming', 'one', 'right', 'keep', 'Dodgeball', 'becoming', 'too', 'repetitive.The', 'movie', 'riff', 'stock', 'underdog', 'sports', 'genre', 'Peter', 'La', 'Fleur', 'played', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'usual', 'sardonic', 'wit', 'having', 'find', 'way', 'save', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Gym', 'being', 'foreclosed', 'bank', 'turned', 'rival', 'hi-tech', 'gym', 'next', 'door', 'parking', 'lot', 'Who', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Peter', 'La', 'Fleur', 'none', 'other', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'former-fatty', 'turned', 'workout', 'fitness', 'Nazi', 'White', 'Goodman', 'Goodman', 'Globo', 'Gym', 'state-of-the', 'art', 'sterile', 'BALCO-like', 'gym', 'where', 'insults', 'making', 'members', 'feel', 'ugly', 'fat', 'useless', 'way', 'clean', 'health', 'perfect', 'bod.Already', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'know', 'who', 'root', 'who', 'boo', 'one', 'corner', 'have', 'Average', 'Joe', 'guys', 'played', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'Chris', 'Williams', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Joel', 'Moore', 'Stiller', 'Goodman', 'consigliere', ""Me'Shell"", 'Jamal', 'Duff', 'channelling', 'Barry', 'White', 'hand-picked', 'ringer', 'dodgeball', 'team', 'Purple', 'Cobras', 'two', 'sides', 'set', 'dodgeball', 'carnage', 'Average', 'Joe', 'must', 'win', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Dodgeball', 'Invitational', 'earn', '50,000', 'needed', 'save', 'gym', 'round', 'out', 'Average', 'Joe', 'team', 'will', 'be', 'bank', 'accountant', 'who', 'up', 'sympathizing', 'Joe', 'Kate', 'Veatch', 'played', 'Stiller', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Patches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'Rip', 'Torn', 'scene-stealing', 'role', '.Rip', 'Torn', 'hilarious', 'acerbic', 'insane', 'former', 'Dodgeball', 'great', 'Patches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'pretty', 'much', 'best', 'one-liners', 'movie', 'moment', 'screen', 'Average', 'Joe', 'team', 'browbeating', 'insulting', 'failing', 'throwing', 'wrenches', 'help', 'learning', '5', 'D', 'dodgeball', 'Dodge', 'duck', 'dip', 'dive', 'dodge', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'Rip', 'Torn', 'character', 'dominating', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'think', 'Dodgeball', 'constant', 'ball', 'groin', 'shots', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'old', 'Instead', 'Patches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'constantly', 'gave', 'people', 'watching', 'reason', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud.Dodgeball', 'True', 'Underdog', 'Story', 'movie', 'Academy', 'voters', 'will', 'not', 'think', 'twice', 'showering', 'praises', 'awards', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'rest', 'movie-going', 'public', 'Dodgeball', 'one', 'hilarious', 'one-liner', 'one-liner', 'ball', 'nuts', 'funny', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'old', 'viewing', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'people', 'loud']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition
624014,A3JEXIVCVB5A8D,B00005JMYF,A viewer,"[1, 2]","I've read some of the reviews on this movie, and I think some of the people who say this movie isn't funny lack a sense of humor.  I first saw this movie in the theatre, I laughed all the way through it, along with the rest of the sold out cinema.  And when I watch it by myself at my house or with some people, I'll still laugh at some of its jokes.Probably the only thing I didn't like about this movie is that it was kind of short (85 minutes or so), and the storyline was incredibly fast-paced.  Anyways, there's two main characters in the movie.  First, there is Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaugn, ""Old School,"" ""Anchorman"") who is the owner of Average Joe's Gym, a run-down gym that is about to be shut down due to failed mortage payments and bought out by Peter's arch enemy, White Goodman (Ben Stiller).  White is the owner of Globo Gym, a state-of-the-art complex located right across the street from Average Joe's.  In order to keep Average Joe's Gym in business and out of the clutches of Globo Gym, Peter has to raise $50,000 dollars in 30 days.  After failed attempts to raise money, they decide to participate in a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas, which happens to have a $50,000 grand prize awarded to the winner.  In response, Globo Gym forms their own dodgeball team, to try and prevent Average Joe's from winning the money.That's pretty much it for the story itself.  And again, the story moves very quickly, but fortunately the cast is able to keep the laughs constantly coming.  The cast also includes a big set of on-camera cameos by William Shatner, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff, Hank Azaria, and Lance Armstrong.  The DVD also comes packed with bonus features.  I was surprised that they didn't have some of the deleted scenes in the actual movie, because they're pretty funny and the movie short enough as it is.  This may not be the best movie out there, but I bet Steven Spielberg crapped his pants when his movie, ""The Terminal,"" got destroyed by Dodgeball at the box office in the first weekend.

In the case of this movie, the slapstickiness and the ongoing pounding of rubber balls on human flesh is just funny in it's own right, but it takes on more meaning because it brings back memories, most of them not good, of the sport back in our school days. Thinking about the horrors of the barbaric sport in gym class and, if you were one of the unlucky ones, remembering being one of the unwilling picked on players who would just get massacred, makes the comedy here more personal. And that much more funnier. Vince Vaughan stars as Peter LaFleur, a laid back slacker type who runs his own little gym, Average Joe's. Which pretty much sums up his character. His gym is kind of slummy with some sad sack clientele. When he learns that he is in debt and owes $50,000 dollars, he must come up with a plan, or he will have to close his place, and hand it over to White Goodman(the hilariously crazy Ben Stiller), a nazi-like fitness guru with a massive gym, and just as massive hair and ego. Peter and his band of misfits learn of a Dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas where the first prize is, you guessed it, $50,000. What a perfect koinkidink. But who shows up?. White, of course. What we have here is a good natured, little underdog story that mostly works. It is by no means a classic, but it is a competent little comedy that is consistent in it's run and it's laughs. It also doesn't hurt that it has a very solid footing with it's good cast. Rip Torn plays their dodgeball coach, who is seen in a 1950's educational type film and is played by an uncredited Hank Azaria. There are a few other cameos here too like William Shatner, Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris(who is hilariously insulted in the last scene), and David Hassellhoff. The commentators for the sport are played by the always great and welcomed Gary Cole, and the mysteriously uncredited Jason Bateman. Those two are reminiscent of Fred Willard in ""Best In Show"", and they are just as funny. The regular cast holds things up nicely too. The always reliable Stephen Root(""Office Space"", ""King Of The Hill"", ""NewsRadio"")is great here as a nerdish family man. Justin Long, from ""Ed"" and the ""Jeepers Creepers"" movies is hysterical as, well, Justin, the poor kid who seems the bear the brunt of the slamming balls and other airborn devices. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor, also co-stars. And what can you say about Stiller?. He has always been very talented, and his creation of White Goodman here is hysterical. He keeps it interesting and fun when waiting to hear what dimbulb thing he is going to say next. This is a movie that is pretty funny and enjoyable on it's own, but is made so much funnier when we remember the rigors of high school gym class and are able to look back on it and laugh.

624027,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00005JMYF,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 1]","In many ways, ""Dodgeball"" is exactly what you think it's going to be: a slob comedy in the classic mold (like ""Stripes"" or ""Caddyshack""), with the snobs vs. the slobs.  And ""Dodgeball"" delivers plenty of laughs along those lines.  Despite all of the broad physical humor, ""Dodgeball"" manages to throw in a number of very subtle and dry gags, and has a lot more intelligence than you might think.However, ""Dodgeball"" takes a while to get moving.  The first 20 minutes are so lifeless and devoid of comedy that we almost kicked the DVD out of the player and abandoned the rest of the movie.  I'm glad I didn't, because the remainder of the movie is laugh-out-loud funny.  The problem is not Vince Vaughn, but his character and the way he's directed.  You never get the feeling that the character really cares about keeping the gym, so you don't get too invested in whether he wins the dodgeball competition or not.  Further, Vaughn, who is an excellent actor who has plenty of comedic energy, just doesn't display it unless Ben Stiller is on screen with him.  This suggests that the fault lies with the director, who seems like he wanted Vaughn to play it a bit too laid back.  What the role needed was the energy of a Bill Murray or Chevy Chase who can do laconic without being listless, and I'm afraid the director just didn't get that.Jason Bateman steals the movie as the stoner co-anchor of the dodgeball broadcast.  If you've ever seen ""Arrested Development,"" you'll laugh twice as hard, because this character is the exact opposite of Michael Bluth.  Bateman would have been a good choice for Vaughn's role as well.The deleted scenes and alternate (original) ending were pretty good.

624028,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B00005JMYF,Brian Markowski,"[1, 3]","I think when you walk into a movie theater to see a Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn comedy about professional dodge ball, expectations should probably be lowered. Odds are you all ready know the plot, a big business gym run by the ego maniac Stiller wants to take over the run down gym next door. A gym run by goofy, but nice salt of the earth kind of guys. You know there's a good chance that they'll be a love interest and she comes in the form of Christine Taylor, a cute but no nonsense banker who's indirectly helping Stiller foreclose on the goofy guy's gym. Vaughn, owner of said gym, needs $50,000 to stay solvent and keep his place but there's no way he can get that kind of...oh...but wait a minute... he and his employees could enter the local dodge ball tournament which eventually leads to Las Vegas and, you guessed it, a $50,000 grand prize. It's the perfect plan, but, oh no, Stiller and his thugs have entered the tournament too and the Average Joe's (the name of Vaughn's team) may be in trouble. Odds are you can guess how it ends.So we don't see these movies for the plots, we go to them for the jokes and Dodgeball has its share of funny and even laugh out load moments. Stiller's over the top performance is typical Stiller, but he's one of the few comic actors today that can pull off such a performance with out looking silly. Vaughn pretty much recreates his role from ""Old School"" while supporting roles and guest appearances by Rip Torn, Gary Cole, Hank Azaria, and Jason Bateman keep the action moving.My first problem with the film is that it takes some wrong comic turns. Alan Tudyk seems wasted as a guy who thinks he's a pirate, that's the joke...he thinks he's a pirate. When the team HAS to ware leather bondage uniforms for their first Las Vegas match, Joel Moore wears a gag bar in his mouth. Why? No real reason except it's suppose to look funny. There's also lots of ""ball"" (i.e. testicle) jokes, because testicle and ball mean the same thing and that's funny.  The second problem is that this movie rips off its idea and look from the very underrated BASEketball. Where Trey Parker and Matt Stone grossed out their audience perhaps a bit too much BASEketball, the idea was original and sound. It also seemed a lot funnier the first time around.",3,Funny...at times.,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,2280,"['think', 'when', 'walk', 'movie', 'theater', 'see', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'comedy', 'professional', 'dodge', 'ball', 'expectations', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'lowered', 'Odds', 'are', 'ready', 'know', 'plot', 'big', 'business', 'gym', 'run', 'ego', 'maniac', 'Stiller', 'take', 'over', 'run', 'down', 'gym', 'next', 'door', 'gym', 'run', 'goofy', 'nice', 'salt', 'earth', 'kind', 'guys', 'know', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'cute', 'nonsense', 'banker', 'who', 'indirectly', 'helping', 'Stiller', 'foreclose', 'goofy', 'guy', 'gym', 'Vaughn', 'owner', 'said', 'gym', '50,000', 'stay', 'solvent', 'keep', 'place', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'kind', 'oh', 'wait', 'minute', 'employees', 'could', 'enter', 'local', 'dodge', 'ball', 'tournament', 'eventually', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'guessed', '50,000', 'grand', 'prize', 'perfect', 'plan', 'Stiller', 'thugs', 'have', 'entered', 'tournament', 'too', 'Average', 'Joe', 'name', 'Vaughn', 'team', 'may', 'be', 'trouble', 'Odds', 'are', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movies', 'plots', 'go', 'jokes', 'Dodgeball', 'share', 'funny', 'even', 'laugh', 'out', 'load', 'moments', 'Stiller', 'top', 'performance', 'typical', 'Stiller', 'one', 'few', 'comic', 'actors', 'today', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'performance', 'out', 'looking', 'silly', 'Vaughn', 'pretty', 'much', 'role', 'Old', 'School', 'supporting', 'roles', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'keep', 'action', 'moving.My', 'first', 'problem', 'film', 'wrong', 'comic', 'turns', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'wasted', 'guy', 'who', 'pirate', 'joke', 'pirate', 'When', 'team', 'HAS', 'ware', 'leather', 'bondage', 'uniforms', 'first', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'match', 'Joel', 'Moore', 'gag', 'bar', 'mouth', 'Why', 'real', 'reason', 'suppose', 'look', 'funny', 'also', 'lots', 'ball', 'i.e', 'testicle', 'jokes', 'testicle', 'ball', 'mean', 'same', 'thing', 'funny', 'second', 'problem', 'movie', 'idea', 'look', 'very', 'underrated', 'BASEketball', 'Where', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'grossed', 'out', 'audience', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'BASEketball', 'idea', 'was', 'original', 'sound', 'also', 'seemed', 'lot', 'funnier', 'first', 'time', 'around']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition

624031,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JMYF,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 2]","Dodgeball is a fun and entertaining film that pits two business associates against each other in a battle for respect and survival. Ben Stiller is the egocentric, cocky White Goodman and Vince Vaughan plays his rival, Peter. Both men own physical health centers, but Peter's is in financial trouble and needs a way to make a large sum of money quickly. Peter and his employees decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas with the hope of winning the championship and the necessary money to stay in business. Goodman hears about this and he enters his own team to challenge them.The formula and plot for this movie may seem a little hokey at first. But the movie works for several reasons. First of all, there is the fine cast of characters and diversity of personalities. Vaughn's character is soft spoken and friendly, but also non- expressive and basically an underachiever- the mirror opposite of the arrogant character played by Ben Stiller. Rip Torn is also excellent as the coach for Vaughn's team. His character, Peaches O'Houlihan, is confined to a wheelchair but he doesn't let this stop him from doing what he does best: coaching and motivating his team in a most unorthodox and often hysterical way. And Gary Cole and Jason Bateman add some good laughs as the sportscasters for ""ESPN 8: The Ocho"", which is covering the dodgeball event.Cameo appearances by Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and others add to the many surprises in this film. And even though the movie is mostly predictable, as a viewer, you really won't mind. There is enough fun along the way to make the ride enjoyable regardless.Dodgeball is, in summary, a fast- moving, fun, entertaining, and mostly predictable film that is humorous and enjoyable from beginning to end. The director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, and the fine cast deserve credit for taking what initially seems like a stupid, ""B"" comedy and turning it into a compelling, witty, and entertaining motion picture film.",4,Dodge Yourself into a Seat to Watch this Funny Movie,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,1968,"['Dodgeball', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'two', 'business', 'associates', 'other', 'battle', 'respect', 'survival', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'egocentric', 'cocky', 'White', 'Goodman', 'Vince', 'Vaughan', 'rival', 'Peter', 'men', 'own', 'physical', 'health', 'centers', 'Peter', 'financial', 'trouble', 'way', 'make', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'quickly', 'Peter', 'employees', 'decide', 'enter', 'dodgeball', 'tournament', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'hope', 'winning', 'championship', 'necessary', 'money', 'stay', 'business', 'Goodman', 'own', 'team', 'challenge', 'them.The', 'formula', 'plot', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'hokey', 'first', 'movie', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'all', 'fine', 'cast', 'characters', 'diversity', 'personalities', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'soft', 'spoken', 'friendly', 'also', 'non-', 'expressive', 'basically', 'underachiever-', 'mirror', 'opposite', 'arrogant', 'character', 'played', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'also', 'excellent', 'coach', 'Vaughn', 'team', 'character', 'Peaches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'confined', 'wheelchair', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'coaching', 'motivating', 'team', 'most', 'unorthodox', 'often', 'hysterical', 'way', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'add', 'good', 'laughs', 'sportscasters', 'ESPN', '8', 'Ocho', 'covering', 'dodgeball', 'event.Cameo', 'appearances', 'Lance', 'Armstrong', 'William', 'Shatner', 'others', 'add', 'many', 'surprises', 'film', 'even', 'movie', 'mostly', 'predictable', 'viewer', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'enough', 'fun', 'way', 'make', 'ride', 'enjoyable', 'regardless.Dodgeball', 'summary', 'fast-', 'moving', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'predictable', 'film', 'humorous', 'enjoyable', 'beginning', 'end', 'director', 'Rawson', 'Marshall', 'Thurber', 'fine', 'cast', 'deserve', 'credit', 'taking', 'what', 'initially', 'stupid', 'B', 'comedy', 'turning', 'compelling', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'motion', 'picture', 'film']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition

Luckily, I was proven wrong. Ben Stiller is White Goodman, a cocky, wealthy and heavily built owner of the hottest gym going. Vince Vaughn is Peter LaFleur, the owner of Average Joe's gym which is old, worn out and in finanical debt to its ears. White and Peter have different philosophy as it relates to human conditioning and outlooks on life. White feels if you're not buff or in shape, you're a loser. Peter is for everyone regardless of what shape their in.The bank gives Peter a notice that the gym is about to be foreclosed if he does not come up with $50,000. If peter fails to come up with this money, White will use the gym to add on to his gym. Peter and his crew try desperately to come up with strageties to make the money, but fall flat each time until one of the guys encouraged the group to get involved in a dodgeball competition. Of course, Peter is pretty much the only guy on the team that has any athletic abilities. In fact the team was so bad that they got schooled by a girl scout's team in order to qualify for the touranment but the girls got disqualified b/c one of the girls failed a drug test. Go Figure. Luckily, the team did get some help as a coach (Rip Torn) comes and shows them the ropes on how to play the game. Of course, that took many, many practices to even get them even close to being competitive.  The coach used wrenches and screwdrivers to as ball to help them practice.  Obvisously, you would want to be good enough to dodge these things or else you'll be in some serious pain. In addition, the woman who entered Average Joe's gym to give him his notice joined the team b/c she hated White just as bad as he did and was you would expect, Average Joe's overcame the odds to advance in the finals of the tourament. However, their cinderalla story was in some serious jeporady. The coach gets killed in a casino, some of the team members had priorities elsewhere, and White strongly encouraged Peter a deal he couldn't refuse in selling his gym. However, against all odds the team did prevail, keep the gym, and run White's gym out of business. White ends up the guy that he thought was a complete loser as he sat in his sofa eating a pound of ice cream grieveing over the loss.

I once read an interview with a former Hollywood screenwriter.  He said he hated that way comedies were written because they always felt it necessary to say t the audience ""Here comes the joke. Here is the joke. Ok, that was the joke."" And I never saw that concept as clearly as I did while watching this film.  It's no enough that the Christine Taylor character swoons over Vince Vaughn and seems revolted at the mere sight of Ben Stiller.  No, no, no, she needs to spell it out to the audience that she just threw up...a little...in her mouth.  Now I've had my fair share of ugly girls hit on me in my day and never once did my body reject the idea of them so thoroughly as to create vomit.  And I doubt anyone else has had that experience either, so where exactly does the comedy come from in that scene?  The film is filled with the usual teenage fare... gross out jokes, celebrity cameos, and nonsense.  Oh yeah, and a nice dose of funny jokes.  I've always thought the Stiller/Wilson/Vaughn comedies had far more integrity that those of Adam Sandler.  [...]  Still I can't recommend this film.  They pander far too much and think too little of their target audience.  Also, I felt as though this film existed in a bubble, and that it could have been made any time in the past 100 years and has nothing to say about the society we live in today.

I'll never understand the absurdity of the regressive attitudes tied into taking the simplistic games we enjoyed playing when we were children and turning them into professional sporting events...I dunno, it kinda takes the magic out of being a kid...just my opinion, I suppose.  Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Terry Tate, Office Linebacker), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) stars Vince Vaughn (Old School, Be Cool) and Ben Stiller (Meet the Parents, Starsky & Hutch).  Also appearing is Stiller's wife Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movie, The Wedding Singer), Rip Torn (The Beastmaster, Airplane II: The Sequel), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), Stephen Root (""NewsRadio"", Office Space), Joel Moore (Art School Confidential), Chris Williams (Friday After Next), Alan Tudyk (I, Robot), Jason Bateman (""Arrested Development""), and Hank Azaria, the man behind the voice of Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu, Comic Book Guy, Cletus, Prof. Frinkon, to name a few, on the TV show The Simpsons.As the movie begins we meet a character by the name of Peter La Fleur (Vaughn), owner and proprietor of the Average Joe's Gym.  Business could certainly be better, but then Peter seems a soft touch, especially since he hasn't collected dues from his rather unique and distinctive membership (one guy thinks he's a pirate, and swears he'll pay off his debt once he remembers where he buried his treasure) in over a year.  Anyway, seems the bank is in the process of foreclosure, prompted by Peter's competition in that of the highly narcissistic White Goodman (Stiller), who runs the high tech Globo Gym `Here at Globo Gym we're better than you, and we know it' across the street, having designs on acquiring the property, leveling it, and turning it into a auxiliary parking lot for his elite clientele.  Peter learns from bank representative Kate Veatch (Taylor) that in order to save his gym he needs to raise $50,000 within 30 days, a seemingly insurmountable task, but opportunity comes in the form of a dodgeball tournement, one where the team that wins the finals, held in Las Vegas, is awarded a prize of the exact amount needed to save the gym.  Goodman learns of Peter's plan, organizes his own team, including a scary uni-brow female ringer from some Soviet breakaway republic, to ensure his nefarious scheme doesn't fail, but Peter and his band of sorry, uncoordinated geeks, losers, and oddballs finds help in that of 7 time dodgeball all star Patches O'Houlihan (Torn), who signs on as their coach (utilizing some unusual techniques and also having some of the best lines)...will the boys prevail?  Perhaps, but they're going to need some serious help, a little luck, and a whole lot of balls...This movie is worth watching if nothing else than to see Justin Long getting clobbered in the face with a wrench...oh, I know it was a rubber prop, but still, it looked darn realistic, and elicited a strange sense of satisfaction from myself.  I've got nothing against Justin Long as a person, but his character Warren Parker Cheswick on the television series `Ed' was just so darn annoying.  The story is pretty formulaic in terms of a rag tag bunch of misfits rising above their own inadequacies to achieve a common goal, facing impossible odds and adversity every step of the way, but the difference is the various interesting characters.  I thought all the actors did really well, but Stiller kinda needs to find a new schtick as I feel like I've seen his psycho, over-the-top characterization a number of times, with small variances.  I actually like him better when he's downplaying his roles in a self-effacing manner as in There's Something About Mary (1998) or Meet the Parents (2000)...yeah, his character did get a little nutso in those movies, but it was brief, and within context, and worked better in small doses.  I've never been a huge fan of Vaughn, ever since he appeared in that remake of Psycho (1998), but he fit in nicely here as the sort of smart alecky leader and wasn't relied on to carry the film as he got a lot of help from a good supporting cast.  The direction was good, as Thurber kept things moving along at a good pace, although the film did slow down a bit in the third act, despite all the scenes of intense competition in terms of teams battling to get into the finals.  In one of the commentaries, Thurber stated he actually left the film for a week, as the studio didn't like his original ending, which is included as a special feature.  I saw it, and thought it was better than the one used, and I can only imagine the reactions of those who attended pre-screening...oh well, I guess you really can't fight the power.  At least we get to see Christine Taylor kiss another woman, and that's gotta be worth something.  Some of my favorite scenes involved the training tactics used by Rip Torn's character (""If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball.""), which involved the scene, as I mentioned earlier, of Justin Long's character's face having an unfriendly encounter with a tool.  All in all this was a pretty silly movie, but highly entertaining, especially if you like to see guys hit in the crotch with large, rubber balls (I know I do).The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) picture on this DVD looks sharp, and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through clearly.  Special features include a commentary track with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, and director-writer Rawson Marshall Thurber, nine deleted/extended scenes and an alternate ending with optional commentary by writer/director Thurber, footage (with introduction by Thurber) of the Dodgeball Dancers (Yowsa!), some entertaining featurettes titled `Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball',  `The Anatomy of a Hit', `Justin Long: A Study in Ham & Cheese', `Dodgeball: Go for the Gold', a blooper/gag reel, 2 theatrical trailers for the film, along with ones for Garden State (2004), and There's Something About Mary (1998), the screenplay on DVD-ROM, and a few, easy to find Easter eggs featuring Stiller in a fat suit poking fun at those who scour DVDs for hidden features.Cookieman108Also, keep you eyes

By the way, this is an ""R"" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid.Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments, mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru, ""White Goodman,"" a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller, sort of like David against Goliath, the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk.Christine Taylor is the token young ""hottie"" that you also see in these kind of pictures: skinny, pretty, but not exactly the wholesome type.Rip Torn almost steals the show as ""Patches O'Houlihan,"" the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact, ""Patches"" puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a ""fair"" rating.A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story.

Vince Vaughn is the broke and nearly ruined Peter Le Fleur, owner of Average Joes Gym, and Ben Stiller is the beyond creepy White Goodman, maniac owner of the successful Globo Gym which is right across the street from the failing Average Joes.  White has taken advantage of Peter's defaulting on his second mortgage to get his paws on Average Joes Gym to tear it down to expand his parking.  Of course, Peter has 30 days to come up with the fifty grand to stay the foreclosure and death of his moribund gym.Steven Root plays Gordon, one of the loveable losers whose non-life revolves around Average Joes.  Gordon reads Obscure Sports Monthly.  It happens they can win the $50,000 if they can win a dodgeball tournament in Vegas.  Never mind the expense or taxes, the amount has to match exactly what is needed because it doesn't really matter at all.  It is just a plot device for the silliness which ensues.Rip Torn plays the wheelchair bound Patches O'Houlihan, the minor deity of the sport of dodgeball.  He takes on the loveable losers and trains them to win the tournament.

On the surface, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story seems to say yes but in actuality it is an accurate parody of this silly activity that one used to play as a child in gym class. Now, it is televised and played by ""professionals."" It's time to take this ridiculous enterprise down a notch.The attention to details is a part of what makes this such a funny movie. There is the skewering of the many ESPN TV channels as the tournament is shown on ESPN 8 (their slogan is ""If it's almost a sport we've got it here.""). The two sports commentators are played with gusto by Gary Cole and Jason Bateman who gleefully spout many funny, off-the-cuff comments that make fun of these kinds of broadcasters.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber and actors Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. Thurber mentions that he wrote the roles specifically for Stiller, Vaughn and Justin Long. Stiller and Vaughn comment on scenes with dry, sardonic humour while Thurber plays the straight man.There are seven deleted scenes with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that they were cut for time and pacing. There is some good footage here, including more with Justin (Long) and his dream of being a cheerleader.Also included is a more downbeat alternate ending with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that test audiences didn't like it and the studio forced him to re-shoot it, even leaving the production for ten days in protest. This is a rare insight into a problem that he ran into in an otherwise congratulatory collection of extras.""Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball"" features footage of the cast training for the dodgeball sequences. Interestingly, they all had to learn how to dodge and throw the ball like professional dodgeballers.""The Anatomy of a Hit"" examines why physical humour is so funny. Thurber explains that the tendency for an actor is to flinch before you're hit by an object.""Justin Long: A Study in Ham and Cheese"" features a scene with the actor adlibbing as he mentally prepares himself for dodgeball followed by a montage of many ball hits that he endured for a scene.""Dodgeball: Go for the Gold"" has Stiller and Vaughn making a mock-plea for dodgeball to be considered as an Olympic sport.There is the obligatory blooper/gag reel that features the usual blown lines and, not surprisingly, some of the nasty hits that the camera took from well-placed dodgeball throws by Stiller.Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.Dodgeball lives up to its subtitle by being a much better movie than it should have been. Sure, there is the requisite crude humour (gratuitous ball shots to the groin) but also right on the money parodies of fitness clubs and the fascination with sports that have no business being called such.

624062,AOHPEC3VN9FU1,B00005JMYF,"declan ""eraserhead""","[0, 2]","I think that you really do have to have seen this film on DVD to appreciate it, as there is alot in it that tends to escape the eye on the first viewing. Yes, it is a silly movie full of tiresome and painful slapstick, but there is a rather cynical side to the director that puts him a little above your average  director of dumb comedy. I would recommend watching the alternate ending and commentary on the DVD to see what i mean-it seems he fought fairly hard for a less predictable ending but gave up. What really puts this in prespective though is to watch the movie again and notice all the little touches that seem to make fun of the obviousness of the ending of the film that was seen in cinemas-notice, for instance, that the treasure chest that Vaughn wins actually has the words ""deus ex machina"" labelled upon it. It is actually pretty annoying that the alternate ending was not used, as this could have added a real twist to the film, without ruining the original outcome i.e. having Vaughn lose and than finding he used Globo Gym's money in betting against his team. Nonetheless, there's also a lot more goodies included throughout the film for those with an observant eye and patience, including a gust appearance by William Shatner (that man is addicted to guest appearances) and a memorably disturbing little skit at the end of the film after the credits-I won't give away too much, but let us just say that it involves Ben Stiller...enough said! Anyway, just watch closely for these little touches (I know it's hard after those endless mind-numbing scenes of balls hitting people that get put everywhere throughout the film) and you just might enjoy this movie.",3,More to it than meets the eye,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,1678,"['think', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'DVD', 'appreciate', 'alot', 'escape', 'eye', 'first', 'viewing', 'Yes', 'silly', 'movie', 'full', 'tiresome', 'painful', 'slapstick', 'rather', 'cynical', 'side', 'director', 'little', 'average', 'director', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'alternate', 'ending', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'mean-it', 'fought', 'fairly', 'hard', 'less', 'predictable', 'ending', 'gave', 'up', 'What', 'really', 'prespective', 'though', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'notice', 'little', 'touches', 'seem', 'make', 'fun', 'obviousness', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'seen', 'cinemas-notice', 'instance', 'treasure', 'chest', 'Vaughn', 'actually', 'words', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'labelled', 'actually', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'real', 'twist', 'film', 'ruining', 'original', 'outcome', 'i.e', 'having', 'Vaughn', 'lose', 'finding', 'used', 'Globo', 'Gym', 'money', 'betting', 'team', 'Nonetheless', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'goodies', 'included', 'film', 'observant', 'eye', 'patience', 'including', 'gust', 'appearance', 'William', 'Shatner', 'man', 'addicted', 'guest', 'appearances', 'memorably', 'disturbing', 'little', 'skit', 'end', 'film', 'credits-I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'enough', 'said', 'Anyway', 'just', 'watch', 'closely', 'little', 'touches', 'know', 'hard', 'endless', 'mind-numbing', 'scenes', 'balls', 'hitting', 'people', 'get', 'put', 'everywhere', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition

624064,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B00005JMYF,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[2, 3]","I picked up 'Dodgeball' based on the recommnedations of some friends, but my expectations were rather low.  Fortunately, this movie exceeded my expectations and was a funny and enjoyable movie.The Story:  Peter La Fleur, played by Vince Vaughn, runs Average Joe's--a gym that is struggling to pay bills mainly due to Vaughn's easy going managerial attitude.  Kate Veach, played by Christine Taylor, is a lawyer hired by the bank to foreclose on the gym.  White Goodman, played by Ben Stiller, is the owner of a competing mega-successful gym that is attempting to buy out Average Joe's through the foreclosure proceedings.  One of Peter's customers comes up with a scheme needed to raise the $50,000 to save the gym--enter the national dodgeball finals in Las Vegas where the winning team receives $50,000.The Cast and Characters:  The cast was selected well for this comedy.  Vince Vaughn plays a character that you'd expect from him.  Although the role was not a stretch for him, for the lines and jokes he had to deliver, he was perfect for the part.  Taylor was good in her role as well.  She is likeable, and perhaps underused in the movies.  Rip Torn turns in a offbeat role that is good for a few laughs as Patches O'Houlihan, a former dodgeball national champion and the mentor of the Average Joes.  The best performance was turned in by Ben Stiller in what was perhaps his best performance of late.  Slightly over the top, his portrayal of White Goodman was a successful caricature of flab to fab muscle bound gym owners.  His overzealous flirtations with Kate and his exchanges with Peter were what made the movie.The DVD:  The DVD content was first rate.  There is the behind the scenes look plus interviews with members of the cast.  There is a set of deleted and altered scenes, some of which would have fleshed out the story a bit more, but none of which were crucial to the movie, or so funny you wonder why they were left out.  The best additional feature on the DVD is the alternate ending.  The less said about it the better, otherwise it will be utterly spoiled.Overall:  this is a good comedy, although not one for the ages.  Its good for some laughs.

Here's to say, it's a comedy that doesn't generate very many laughs. It uses a lot of low-brow humor that is recycled and unoriginal. Also, what I was hoping to see the most of, the dodgeball game itself, just takes up a small portion of the very-short movie.This movie reminded me a little of ""Kingpin"" and ""Baseketball,"" only those two were much funnier. I like Vince Vaughn, but there is reason why he's usually the 'bad guy' in movies. Vaughn is just coasting through this role, and is just bland and boring enough to make us not give a damn if he loses his gym or not. I'm tired of Ben Stiller playing basically the same character in a majority of his movies. Here he is talking in that stupid deep voice and spitting out stupid insults and comebacks again. How do people still find this funny? His career is dying slowly, maybe he can resurrect it a little in ""Meet The Fockers.""There are a number of sight gags that fall completely flat throughout the movie. The dialougue was pretty lame, and people getting hit in the head and crouch gets old too fast! It was nice to see Christine Taylor kiss another chick at the end, of course, but where she proclaims that, ""I'm not a lesbian, I'm a bisexual,"" what the hell was that? That little part was just awkward. The only good things about this movie were the cameos by the likes of Lance Armstrong, Hank Azaria, David Hasselhoff, and of course Chuck Norris, and every minute Rip Torn was on screen. Torn just plays with such a gritty, unconventional attitude! I thought ESPN 8 ""The Ocho"" was somewhat funny.The movie didn't even make sense at times. It paints itself out of the corner so many times at the end there, it was ridiculous! First, Average Joe's team was going to have to forfeit, but wait!...there's a rule to overturn it. Vaughn's character gets knocked out by Stiller's, but wait!...he stepped over the line. Vaughn's team wins, but Stiller still gets Vaughn's gym, no wait!...Vaughn just happened to bet all his money on his team even though he was drinking beforehand and not planning on playing the final. Uhhhhhhhh! I wouldn't despise this movie so much if so many different ppl didn't tell me how great and funny it was. If you haven't seen this yet, don't go to any extent to see it right away!

And man was I surprised, it should've said ""Another 'I'm Pissing My Career Down The Sever' Comedy From Ben Stiller"". Seriously, I used to like and wait something from a Ben Stiller film/comedy but nowadays they're just not good. Last good film ""from"" Ben Stiller propably was Royal Tenenbaums from years ago. Every single crap he has done ever since has been crap in the meaning. Just for the record, the leading actor is mostly Vince Vaughn.

It is to this film's credit that it took my mind over my completely hypothetical sorrows.On a deep level, this movie is a powerful social critique of an America in which (1) no-one ever really ""grew up"" and (2) the most retrograde and barbaric high-school pecking orders remain as a result.Ben Stiller plays what the Yuppie has become, a complete a-hole of the sort that has littered Mt Everest with detritus as members of this caste ""achieve"" the Dream by trashing the roof of the world.He is confronted by the left behind, a lost America of love in which people ate a plate of ham and eggs and looked out the window.One knows that a neo-Capraesque resolution is more or less fore-ordained and one watches with pleasure as it is jokingly arrived at.The film makes a joke of the Hitler Jugend culture which pervades America while not speaking its name, a culture of systematic sexual and racial humiliation which uses organized sports mostly to make people feel terrible about themselves.The next step would be a remake of the Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner but the ""serious sports"" genre died out in the 1970s to be replaced by movies in which the ""loser"" doesn't get so much as to set himself apart (as does the runner) but is essentially co-opted, like Rocky, into the immortal System.To its credit, this movie makes the System a joke.

Who doesn't think seeing someone laid out with a wrench or a big red rubber ball isn't funny??

Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","In true spirit of David vs. Goliath, Dodge ball is a play-by-the-book story about the little guys overcoming big odds and coming out on top.  Normally this kind of plot line could be a pit fall for clich&eacute;s and highly predictable setups, but thankfully this movie is in the hands of a skilled director and fronted by likable and funny performers.Rawson Marshall Thurber writes and directs a highly entertaining, low brow, feel good story that utilizes a game most of us played in our youth.  When I played we called it Warball, but it was generally the same.  In the movie, the plot basically follows a charismatic, likeable slacker Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaghn) who owns a lackluster gym called Average Joe's.  Financially he's in over his head, and he doesn't really care.  He's smart and capable, but unmotivated and lacks the confidence.  He's facing bankruptcy, foreclosure and a buyout from the big franchise Globo Gym, run by the feather haired, Fu-manchu sporting narcissist White Goodman (played well over the top by Ben Stiller, but certainly one of his funniest roles).  Lafleur and a misfit group of his gym members decide to enter the professional Dodge ball circuit and go to Las Vegas to win the money needed to keep their gym open.Enter Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) as the bank rep who is pursued by Goodman but finds herself drawn to Peter.  So much so she joins his group of underachievers in the competitions, baring a softball pitch cannon of an arm.After a hilarious regional bout with a group a girl scout-like opponents, the group find themselves on their way to Vegas with a chance to prove themselves and win the cash.  The dodge ball bouts are definitely the highlight of the movie.  Anyone who has seen the `Terry Tate: Office Linebacker' commercials can tell the kinetic style transfers well to the big screen.  The climax features a showdown between the Globo Gym and Average Joe's.  The rest of the cast is well placed, especially role of Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn, and the younger version played by Hank Azaria.  The number of cameos is impressive as well; William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, David Hasselhoff as the German teams coach and especially funny is Jason Bateman as a former Dodge ball champ turned analyst whose commentary leaves intellect at the front door.  In all, this is a feel good movie for adults, probably more directed at men, but still funny for all.  Using a childhood memory, whether good or bad, and making it funny and entertaining.  For everyone who probably wasn't very good at the game as a kid, this movie will make you believe you can be good at it as an adult.",4,Dodgeball underdogs rule,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2680,"['true', 'spirit', 'David', 'vs.', 'Goliath', 'Dodge', 'ball', 'play-by-the-book', 'story', 'little', 'guys', 'overcoming', 'big', 'odds', 'coming', 'out', 'top', 'Normally', 'kind', 'plot', 'line', 'could', 'be', 'pit', 'fall', 'clich', 'eacute', 'highly', 'predictable', 'setups', 'thankfully', 'movie', 'hands', 'skilled', 'director', 'fronted', 'likable', 'funny', 'performers.Rawson', 'Marshall', 'Thurber', 'writes', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'low', 'brow', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'game', 'most', 'played', 'youth', 'When', 'played', 'called', 'Warball', 'was', 'generally', 'same', 'movie', 'plot', 'basically', 'charismatic', 'likeable', 'slacker', 'Peter', 'LaFleur', 'Vince', 'Vaghn', 'who', 'lackluster', 'gym', 'called', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Financially', 'head', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'smart', 'capable', 'unmotivated', 'confidence', 'facing', 'bankruptcy', 'foreclosure', 'buyout', 'big', 'franchise', 'Globo', 'Gym', 'run', 'feather', 'haired', 'Fu-manchu', 'sporting', 'narcissist', 'White', 'Goodman', 'played', 'well', 'top', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'certainly', 'one', 'funniest', 'roles', 'Lafleur', 'misfit', 'group', 'gym', 'members', 'decide', 'enter', 'professional', 'Dodge', 'ball', 'circuit', 'go', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'win', 'money', 'needed', 'keep', 'gym', 'open.Enter', 'Kate', 'Veatch', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Stiller', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'bank', 'rep', 'who', 'pursued', 'Goodman', 'drawn', 'Peter', 'So', 'much', 'group', 'underachievers', 'competitions', 'baring', 'softball', 'pitch', 'cannon', 'arm.After', 'hilarious', 'regional', 'bout', 'group', 'girl', 'scout-like', 'opponents', 'group', 'find', 'way', 'Vegas', 'chance', 'prove', 'win', 'cash', 'dodge', 'ball', 'bouts', 'are', 'definitely', 'highlight', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Terry', 'Tate', 'Office', 'Linebacker', 'commercials', 'can', 'tell', 'kinetic', 'style', 'transfers', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'climax', 'showdown', 'Globo', 'Gym', 'Average', 'Joe', 'rest', 'cast', 'well', 'placed', 'especially', 'role', 'Patches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'played', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'younger', 'version', 'played', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'number', 'cameos', 'impressive', 'well', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Lance', 'Armstrong', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'German', 'teams', 'coach', 'especially', 'funny', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'former', 'Dodge', 'ball', 'champ', 'turned', 'analyst', 'commentary', 'leaves', 'intellect', 'front', 'door', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'adults', 'probably', 'more', 'directed', 'men', 'still', 'funny', 'Using', 'childhood', 'memory', 'good', 'bad', 'making', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'everyone', 'who', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'game', 'kid', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'adult']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition

624101,ACTG0NWGJMNSM,B00005JMYF,"John Larsen ""Johncritic""","[1, 2]","Getting hit in the face with a ball isn't funny, but watching someone else get hit in the face is. Welcome to ""Dodgeball,"" a self-aware summer comedy that aims low and hits hard. Surprisingly, ""Dodgeball"" manages to nail most of its targets, leaving them red-faced and bruised.Anyone who endured the barbaric grade school sport of ""Dodgeball"" will understand and appreciate this underdog tale about a small time gym owner looking for salvation from bankruptcy by entering a rag tag team of losers in the National Dodgeball Championships.Writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber readily admits he's skewering underdog sports movies in general, which explains the over-exaggerated obviousness of the characters and their dilemma. What Thurber fails to take into consideration is that underdog sports movies in general are pretty lame, some so bad they actually become parodies of themselves.Poking fun at these type of films is risky, but Thurber manages to make ""Dodgeball"" a harmless excuse to waste an hour-and-a-half without feeling too guilty. His characters are as thin as rice paper, which allows the actors to break through and make them their own. Vince Vaughn is hilariously understated as ""Average Joe Gym"" owner Peter Le Fleur, whose client list includes a small group of misfits who call the decaying building home.Ben Stiller, with perfectly coifed hair as big as his inflatable cod piece, is exuberantly clueless as White Goodman, a former fatty who now owns the high-tech gym across the street from Average Joe. Intent on turning his competition into a parking structure, Goodman buys out the gym's second mortgage and calls in the loan. With only thirty days to raise $50,000 or lose their haunt, La Fleur and his members decide to enter and win the National Dodgeball Championships in Las Vegas.Not if Goodman has anything to do with it, who then recruits his own team of ringers to put La Fleur permanently out of business. Once La Fleur and his team are on the road to success, their wins come fast and furious, taking out one adverse team after another. Thurber wisely whisks through these tournaments because he knows that we know ""Dodgeball"" doesn't work unless the underdogs win and make it to Las Vegas.Thurber also throws every underdog sports movie cliche in the book at the screen. Some work, some don't, but there are enough laughs to accommodate anyone with an interest in seeing a movie called ""Dodgeball.""",4,"DODGEBALL THROWS HARD, AIMS LOW",1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,2434,"['Getting', 'hit', 'face', 'ball', ""n't"", 'funny', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'get', 'hit', 'face', 'Welcome', 'Dodgeball', 'self-aware', 'summer', 'comedy', 'low', 'hard', 'Surprisingly', 'Dodgeball', 'nail', 'most', 'targets', 'leaving', 'red-faced', 'bruised.Anyone', 'who', 'endured', 'barbaric', 'grade', 'school', 'sport', 'Dodgeball', 'will', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'underdog', 'tale', 'small', 'time', 'gym', 'owner', 'looking', 'salvation', 'bankruptcy', 'entering', 'rag', 'tag', 'team', 'losers', 'National', 'Dodgeball', 'Championships.Writer-director', 'Rawson', 'Marshall', 'Thurber', 'readily', 'skewering', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movies', 'general', 'over-exaggerated', 'obviousness', 'characters', 'dilemma', 'What', 'Thurber', 'take', 'consideration', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movies', 'general', 'are', 'pretty', 'lame', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'become', 'parodies', 'themselves.Poking', 'fun', 'type', 'films', 'risky', 'Thurber', 'make', 'Dodgeball', 'harmless', 'excuse', 'waste', 'hour-and-a-half', 'feeling', 'too', 'guilty', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'thin', 'rice', 'paper', 'actors', 'break', 'make', 'own', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'hilariously', 'understated', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Gym', 'owner', 'Peter', 'Le', 'Fleur', 'client', 'list', 'small', 'group', 'misfits', 'who', 'call', 'decaying', 'building', 'home.Ben', 'Stiller', 'perfectly', 'coifed', 'hair', 'as', 'big', 'inflatable', 'cod', 'piece', 'exuberantly', 'clueless', 'White', 'Goodman', 'former', 'fatty', 'who', 'now', 'high-tech', 'gym', 'street', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Intent', 'turning', 'competition', 'parking', 'structure', 'Goodman', 'out', 'gym', 'second', 'mortgage', 'calls', 'loan', 'only', 'thirty', 'days', 'raise', '50,000', 'lose', 'haunt', 'La', 'Fleur', 'members', 'decide', 'enter', 'win', 'National', 'Dodgeball', 'Championships', 'Las', 'Vegas.Not', 'Goodman', 'anything', 'do', 'who', 'then', 'own', 'team', 'ringers', 'put', 'La', 'Fleur', 'permanently', 'business', 'Once', 'La', 'Fleur', 'team', 'are', 'road', 'success', 'wins', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'taking', 'out', 'one', 'adverse', 'team', 'Thurber', 'wisely', 'tournaments', 'know', 'Dodgeball', ""n't"", 'work', 'underdogs', 'win', 'make', 'Las', 'Vegas.Thurber', 'also', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movie', 'cliche', 'book', 'screen', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'enough', 'laughs', 'accommodate', 'anyone', 'interest', 'seeing', 'movie', 'called', 'Dodgeball']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition

Every preview I saw for it in the theaters and on T.V. made it look absolutely ridiculous.So imagine my surprise when, about a third of the way through, I'm laughing so hard I can barely breathe. Rip Torn's portrayal of a former dodgeball champ now in a wheelchair training the highly untrainable ""Average Joe's"" dodgeball team absolutely stole the show. That's what Rip Torn usually does anyway. His characters always bring something to the screen and add that undefinable *something*.Vince Vaughn was believable as the lazy owner of a very less than average gym. His gym is about to be taken from him, the power in his house is about to be turned off, and he needs to raise $50,000. So they enter a Dodgeball tournament.We've seen this before. Entering tournaments to win much needed money for whatever cause has been done ad nausem. This film, with Vince Vaughn's quite complacence, Christine Taylor's solid comedic turns, it worked more than most of those old formulaic films.And while I hate to say it - and I'm sure this will garner me plenty of ""not helpful"" votes - Ben Stiller, as an actor, was the worst part of the film. I completely understand that as the owner of the over-the-top gym his character needed to be over-the-top as well, but it was overkill. Neither myself nor my roommate laughed at his ridiculousness. We did laugh, however, at other scenes in which Stiller wasn't involved. He just didn't fit the character.Without Stiller - or perhaps with Stiller a bit more reined in - it would have made for an even better film.

624116,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JMYF,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 3]","If you take one of the funniest ""sports"" movies from recent years -- ""Cool Runnings"" about the Jamaican bobsled team -- and mix it with the one liners from ""Airplane"" and throw in the inappropriate sexual references from any fraternity movie, you've got ""Dodgeball"", a sort of ""Putney Swope"" of sports movies.This movie is creative, predictable, obvious, profane, tasteless...and is one of the funniest movies of 2004 or any other year. It is a laugh riot where acting, situations, one liners and a nincompoop plot all merge to create a comedy that's more entertaining than most movies.The one liners come often and are usually laden with sexual conntent. ""Useless as a lollipop that tastes like a (male genitalia)"" is a line from one actor. Another, recounting the miracles he's seen in life, says, ""I've even seen a grown man satisfy a camel.""Ben Stiller is protagonist to Vince Vaughn's antagonist in this flick about competing health clubs, good guys and bad guys. Stiller is more in character throughout this movie than anytime I've ever seen him, while Vaughn plays himself. David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris, William Shatner and Lance Armstrong all play small roles parodying themselves along the way.The title action plays the deciding role in whether the good guy or bad guy will prevail, although everyone knows from the beginning who's going to come out on top. Another one liner about the dodgeball competition is that it is broadcast nationwide on ""ESPN 8, the Ocho"", a comic parody of ESPN2, which is known in the industry as ""the deuce.""While there is no denying this is one of the funniest films of recent years, you are warned not to share this video with your kids unless you want to incur the wrath of your wife or answer question all night like, ""Daddy, what's a dyke?""

624117,A2AV37AKRQZSYY,B00005JMYF,Lauren  B,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed this movie. I thought that Vince Vaughn gave a wonderful performance, as well as Ben Stiller, who is one of my favorite comedy actors. The plot is nothing spectacular--we have seen similar storylines many times over. However, the combination of actors and the little surprises here and there (think beastly (Russian?) woman) give it a nice kick. I docked a point due to one of the last scenes where Vince's love interest ends up kissing her girlfriend that shows up at the tournament, then tells him that she is not a lesbian...but bisexual, and kisses him. I thought that part was uncalled for and didn't add anything to the storyline whatsoever. I also didn't like the fact (and most people may not notice) that the cheerleader ended up pregnant--you can see her pregnant belly in the last scene. I thought that a little ridiculous, especially since most people may not even notice it because they are concentrating on many other characters simultaneously. I am young and have a child and I just don't appreciate the stereotypes--I own my own home and was not an unwed mother and do better than many adults in their fourties.

624118,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMYF,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 21]","In its defense, you have to admit that ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" embraces every clich&eacute; in the history of sports with a sense of joy.  More importantly, first time writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber manages to do this without being heavy handed, which is no mean feat.  He accomplishes this because since this 2004 comedy is trying to work in every clich&eacute; in the history of sports underdogs (and sports underdogs movies) it has to really move along to get them all into the film.  There is no gratuitous milking of the movement in ""Dodgeball,"" because like the sport itself, the movie sends another ball whizzing at you and it is heading for one of three places: your head, your stomach, or right for the obvious metaphor.The underdogs are the guys at Average Joe's Gym, where owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) takes a low-key approach to the health and physical fitness of his loyal and eccentric members.  This is in stark contrast to the high intensity environment across the street at Globo Gym, where White Goodman (Ben Stiller) has made narcissism an art form.  La Fleur is informed by attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) that he has 30 days to come up with $50,000 or lose his gym to (wait for it) Goodman.  It looks like all is lost until the gang at Average Joe's Gym discover that the American Dodgeball Association of America is having its national tournament and the winning teams gets (wait for it) $50,000.What makes this film work is that both the clich&eacute;s and the absurdities (the national champs of dodgeball only get $50,000?) are taken in stride by the characters, which makes it easier for the audience to go along with it as well.  Since the tournament is being covered by ESPN 8 (""The Ocho"") that certainly makes it legitimate, and there are all those screaming fans and teams from around the world.  While watching this movie there was both a point where my wife and I questioned the ""reality"" of the situation.  For her it was when the young Patches O'Houlihan (Hank Azaria) explained the rules of the game and said there were only six players on a team.  She took exception to that, based on personal experience no doubt, and I had to point out that he was talking about ""professional"" dodgeball.  Then when they started playing games in the movie I took exception to the idea that a match consists of a single game, which allowed her to point out that making it two out of three or whatever would just make the movie longer.  But once you start throwing red rubber balls at people it is hard to stop.The key element in ""Dodgeball,"" strangely enough, is that of restraint.  Vaughn's La Fleur is a remarkable calm and understated hero (an approach that carries over into the extras on the DVD) and even Stiller's intense portrayal of the villain is rather restrained.  When these two stand toe to toe and exchange confusing insults it is even more fun then watching people get hit by dodgeballs and be sent flying.  In that regard it is Justin Long as Justin who is the master of being hit and hit repeatedly to great comic effect, although when he is hit by wrenches thrown by the adult Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), you really have to wince, over and over again.  That is why the best approach to the film is to be like the ESPN 8 (""The Ocho"") commentary tag-team of Cotton McKnight (Gary Cole) and Pepper Brooks (Jason Bateman) and take every at face value and buy into it all the way, even if everybody knows the best strategy is to have a bunch of players all throw their balls at the same target at the same time.It is not surprising that as a result of this film dodgeball leagues have sprung up all around the country.  After all, as we have learned from sports films in the past, if you show it, they will play...",4,A film that refuses to dodge away from every sports clich&eacute;,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,3786,"['defense', 'have', 'admit', 'Dodgeball', 'True', 'Underdog', 'Story', 'clich', 'eacute', 'history', 'sports', 'sense', 'joy', 'More', 'importantly', 'first', 'time', 'writer-director', 'Rawson', 'Marshall', 'Thurber', 'do', 'being', 'heavy', 'handed', 'mean', 'feat', '2004', 'comedy', 'trying', 'work', 'clich', 'eacute', 'history', 'sports', 'underdogs', 'sports', 'underdogs', 'movies', 'really', 'move', 'along', 'get', 'film', 'gratuitous', 'milking', 'movement', 'Dodgeball', 'sport', 'movie', 'ball', 'whizzing', 'heading', 'one', 'three', 'places', 'head', 'stomach', 'right', 'obvious', 'metaphor.The', 'underdogs', 'are', 'guys', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Gym', 'where', 'owner', 'Peter', 'La', 'Fleur', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'low-key', 'approach', 'health', 'physical', 'fitness', 'loyal', 'eccentric', 'members', 'stark', 'contrast', 'high', 'intensity', 'environment', 'street', 'Globo', 'Gym', 'where', 'White', 'Goodman', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'made', 'narcissism', 'art', 'form', 'La', 'Fleur', 'informed', 'attorney', 'Kate', 'Veatch', 'Christine', 'Taylor', '30', 'days', 'come', 'up', '50,000', 'lose', 'gym', 'wait', 'Goodman', 'lost', 'gang', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Gym', 'discover', 'American', 'Dodgeball', 'Association', 'America', 'having', 'national', 'tournament', 'winning', 'teams', 'wait', '50,000.What', 'film', 'work', 'clich', 'eacute', 'absurdities', 'national', 'champs', 'dodgeball', 'only', 'get', '50,000', 'are', 'taken', 'stride', 'characters', 'easier', 'audience', 'go', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'tournament', 'being', 'covered', 'ESPN', '8', 'Ocho', 'certainly', 'legitimate', 'are', 'screaming', 'fans', 'teams', 'world', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'wife', 'questioned', 'reality', 'situation', 'was', 'when', 'young', 'Patches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'explained', 'rules', 'game', 'said', 'were', 'only', 'six', 'players', 'team', 'took', 'exception', 'based', 'personal', 'experience', 'doubt', 'had', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'talking', 'professional', 'dodgeball', 'Then', 'when', 'started', 'playing', 'games', 'movie', 'took', 'exception', 'idea', 'match', 'single', 'game', 'allowed', 'point', 'out', 'making', 'two', 'three', 'would', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'longer', 'once', 'start', 'throwing', 'red', 'rubber', 'balls', 'people', 'hard', 'stop.The', 'key', 'element', 'Dodgeball', 'strangely', 'enough', 'restraint', 'Vaughn', 'La', 'Fleur', 'remarkable', 'calm', 'understated', 'hero', 'approach', 'extras', 'DVD', 'even', 'Stiller', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'villain', 'rather', 'restrained', 'When', 'two', 'stand', 'toe', 'toe', 'exchange', 'confusing', 'insults', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'then', 'watching', 'people', 'get', 'hit', 'dodgeballs', 'be', 'sent', 'flying', 'regard', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Justin', 'who', 'master', 'being', 'hit', 'hit', 'repeatedly', 'great', 'comic', 'effect', 'when', 'hit', 'wrenches', 'thrown', 'adult', 'Patches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'Rip', 'Torn', 'really', 'have', 'wince', 'over', 'again', 'why', 'best', 'approach', 'film', 'be', 'ESPN', '8', 'Ocho', 'commentary', 'tag-team', 'Cotton', 'McKnight', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Pepper', 'Brooks', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'take', 'face', 'value', 'buy', 'way', 'even', 'everybody', 'best', 'strategy', 'have', 'bunch', 'players', 'throw', 'balls', 'same', 'target', 'same', 'time.It', 'not', 'surprising', 'result', 'film', 'dodgeball', 'leagues', 'have', 'sprung', 'up', 'country', 'have', 'learned', 'sports', 'films', 'past', 'show', 'will', 'play']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition

Add to this a male lead who is about as bland and uninteresting as you can imagine -- playing a sort of everyman that you can't even begin to root for -- and Dodgeball becomes a rather bland mess that doesn't live up to the potential of some of its funnier stars (Stephen Root and Ben Stiller at the top of the list).These writers must be related to major Hollywood hitters.

624129,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JMYF,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 2]","I have to say I was quite wary about this film. I'm not Ben Stiller's biggest fan. Never have been, never will be. His humour just does not appeal to me. And I always get him & Adam Sandler muddled up. I swear they're the same guy. Why is it as well that they put a very bad wig and moustache on him, and do their best to make him look like a very bad porn star? Surely he didn't think he looked good?! And I have never seen a film with Vince Vaughn before. The only things I know about him is that he's very tall (and I'm very small, so I won't be standing next to him anytime soon), and he's rumoured to be dating Jennifer Aniston.Isn't Dodgeball a game you would play in primary school? Well, it certainly is now, with the influence of the game. I have to say I would have failed miserably at this game. I have no hand-to-eye co-ordination, and if I have to avoid something (like a ball coming flying at you), then I'd walk straight into it. And how many shots were there in the movie of a poor guy getting hit in the ... y'know? I'm not a guy, but have been told that the pain is indescribable, and you certainly do not get up straight afterwards, and carry on. Now, if I was crossing my legs during the film, what would an average guy be doing?! It's too scary to think about.Was it deliberate that extremely tall people surrounded Ben Stiller? Vince Vaughn must be well over 6ft, and there was also that guy who was ""White's"" right-hand-man, who's name sounded a lot like Michelle, he was big too. In fact, most of White's team was taller than him.I have to say compared to other reviews, which have compared this to Kingpin & Baseketball, I disagree. Mind you, I wasn't taken by both films (have I seen both?), and much prefer this movie.I loved Christine Taylor in this (Ben's real life wife! Awwwwwww), I was loving the braids, and the way she played against the stereotypical girl in this film. By the looks of some shots, she really went for it! Even if her hubby did break 3 cameras, and also hit her in the face. (I'll bet he was making up for that later.)The film is very fast-paced, and you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat for most of the film, trying not to bite your nails. There's also quite a few cameos, including absolute hilarious turns by David Hasselhoff & William Shatner. However, I didn't get the cameos by Lance Armstrong, Hank Azaria and who is Chuck Norris?The extras are quite reasonable, the gag reel is so funny! But the rest of it is just your usual bog-standard extras. Nothing special.I quite enjoyed this film, and had a good laugh with it. The wig Ben Stiller is wearing though is unforgivable however. Ugh.

624134,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JMYF,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 3]","Let's get one thing straight: there really is, God help us, an International Dodge Ball Federation.  That alone seems like enough of an excuse for a comedy about the sport.  And lo, Ben Stiller saw that it was good and he made a movie about it with mixed results.Ben Stiller usually plays sympathetic, frustrated nerds who lose their tempers when things don't go their way.  In Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, the usual Stiller charm has been dropped and replaced by an arrogant, irritating character named White Goodman.  He is the founder of an extremely popular gym that has plans to expand by taking over extremely uptight, fastidious Peter La Fleur, played by Vince Vaughn.Just kidding!  Of course Vaughn wouldn't play anyone uptight or fastidious.  He's made a career out of playing easygoing regular Joes, sometimes with large vocabularies that betray a hint of intelligence, who don't work too hard and just want to get by in life. When Vaughn is paired with an even more mellow guy like Owen Wilson, it makes Vaughn look animated in comparison and the two become an excellent combination of mellow/acerbic.  See Wedding Crashers for a more palatable mix.But alas, Wilson isn't in this film.  Instead, Le Fleur is backed by a cast of equally lovable idiots, including obscure sportsphile Gordon (Stephen ""Red Stapler"" Root), clueless Owen (Joel Moore), normal guy Dwight (Chris Williams), the appropriately named Justin (Justin Long), and for some reason that only Stiller understands, Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk). Le Fleur falls hard for the lovely Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor and Stiller's wife), a lawyer in the employ of Goodman.How can our just-like-you gaggle of guys possibly beat the overcoifed, hyperactive Goodman?  Why, with a little training from the dodgeball champion himself, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). Patches is the funniest character in the entire movie.  That's not a compliment.Like the ill-fated Anchorman, Dodgeball is actually more amusing to quote than it is to watch.  Stiller is much funnier as an underdog and makes for a two-dimensional villain.  Vaughn is unbelievable as a successful business owner and flounders without a foil to play off of.  Taylor tries, again, to be the straight woman like she did in Anchorman, but she's too slickly attractive to pull it off convincingly.Thing is, Dodgeball doesn't care if you like it.  Jason Bateman, Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris, William Shatner, and David Hasslehoff all make appearances, so it's obvious the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  On the other hand, the amusement around these characters being in the movie depends directly on the cultural relevance to the audience.  The Chuck Norris jokes are getting a little creaky.If you watch Dodgeball with your buddies and a case of beer, it definitely earns five stars.  Otherwise it's merely a passable entry in the goofy sports genre.",3,There Really Is an International Dodge Ball Federation,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2891,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'really', 'God', 'International', 'Dodge', 'Ball', 'Federation', 'alone', 'enough', 'excuse', 'comedy', 'sport', 'lo', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'saw', 'was', 'good', 'made', 'movie', 'mixed', 'results.Ben', 'Stiller', 'usually', 'sympathetic', 'frustrated', 'nerds', 'who', 'lose', 'tempers', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'Dodgeball', 'True', 'Underdog', 'Story', 'usual', 'Stiller', 'charm', 'been', 'dropped', 'replaced', 'arrogant', 'irritating', 'character', 'named', 'White', 'Goodman', 'founder', 'extremely', 'popular', 'gym', 'plans', 'expand', 'taking', 'over', 'extremely', 'uptight', 'fastidious', 'Peter', 'La', 'Fleur', 'played', 'Vince', 'Vaughn.Just', 'kidding', 'course', 'Vaughn', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'anyone', 'uptight', 'fastidious', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'easygoing', 'regular', 'Joes', 'sometimes', 'large', 'vocabularies', 'betray', 'hint', 'intelligence', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'hard', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'life', 'When', 'Vaughn', 'paired', 'even', 'more', 'mellow', 'guy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Vaughn', 'look', 'animated', 'comparison', 'two', 'become', 'excellent', 'combination', 'mellow/acerbic', 'See', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'more', 'palatable', 'mix.But', 'alas', 'Wilson', ""n't"", 'film', 'Instead', 'Le', 'Fleur', 'backed', 'cast', 'equally', 'lovable', 'idiots', 'including', 'obscure', 'sportsphile', 'Gordon', 'Stephen', 'Red', 'Stapler', 'Root', 'clueless', 'Owen', 'Joel', 'Moore', 'normal', 'guy', 'Dwight', 'Chris', 'Williams', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Justin', 'Justin', 'Long', 'reason', 'only', 'Stiller', 'understands', 'Steve', 'Pirate', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Le', 'Fleur', 'hard', 'lovely', 'Kate', 'Veatch', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Stiller', 'wife', 'lawyer', 'employ', 'Goodman.How', 'can', 'just-like-you', 'gaggle', 'guys', 'possibly', 'beat', 'overcoifed', 'hyperactive', 'Goodman', 'Why', 'little', 'training', 'dodgeball', 'champion', 'Patches', ""O'Houlihan"", 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Patches', 'funniest', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', 'compliment.Like', 'ill-fated', 'Anchorman', 'Dodgeball', 'actually', 'more', 'amusing', 'quote', 'watch', 'Stiller', 'much', 'funnier', 'underdog', 'two-dimensional', 'villain', 'Vaughn', 'unbelievable', 'successful', 'business', 'owner', 'flounders', 'foil', 'play', 'off', 'Taylor', 'tries', 'again', 'be', 'straight', 'woman', 'did', 'Anchorman', 'too', 'slickly', 'attractive', 'pull', 'off', 'convincingly.Thing', 'Dodgeball', ""n't"", 'care', 'like', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Lance', 'Armstrong', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'William', 'Shatner', 'David', 'Hasslehoff', 'make', 'appearances', 'obvious', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'other', 'hand', 'amusement', 'characters', 'being', 'movie', 'directly', 'cultural', 'relevance', 'audience', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'jokes', 'are', 'getting', 'little', 'creaky.If', 'watch', 'Dodgeball', 'buddies', 'case', 'beer', 'definitely', 'five', 'stars', 'Otherwise', 'merely', 'passable', 'entry', 'goofy', 'sports', 'genre']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition
624135,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00005JMYF,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 3]","Dodge ball is the kind of movie you have seen a thousand times about a guy trying to save something for him and hid friends and they happen to figure out a way how to do it that would never really happen in real life, but you know it will in the end of the film, because it's a movie.What's-his-face plays this guy who owns a gymnasium that needs $50,000 to keep his gym, other wise it will be repossessed (or something like that) by the bank. So they try to think up a way to get the fifty grand with a few weeks by any means necessary (legally). They decide they will enter the Dodge Ball competition where the grand final prize money is (wait for it, you'll never guess) fifty thousand dollars!!! Their rival team is Ben Stiller's annoying character who owns a much more stable and wealthier gym who has bought off the first mortgage of Joes gym and plans to turn Joes gym into a car park for his gym that happens to be right across the street. Will Joe get to the final and win the 50k? Or will Global Gym beat them and take over? I wonder???Ben Stiller is not an actor I hate, I did like him in ""Something about Mary"" so don't get me wrong when I say he is the downfall of this film. He plays an extra stupid fitness buff who owns a major gym. But his character is not funny, and his acting is extremely annoying. To set up a character for the audience to hate is ok, but to make them annoyed and wish he would just get off the screen is another. There is a difference between a villain and bad acting.This movie didn't seem to know which direction it wanted to go in with its approach to comedy in my opinion. Some of it seemed like it was trying to go for average family comedy or kids movie, other parts it would go for the smutty comedy approach, and then in-between here and there where bits of attempted wacky and goofy comedy like a slap stick kind of think. Those elements can work well together, but this new 1st time producer, whoever he is, needs to work out how to blend them properly or never get it right. It's kind of like a kid's first time out drinking booze, instead of sipping something light; he's grabbed everything from the top shelf and mixed a regretting combination. But one day he might learn to not mix his drinks. That's because this movie had potential to be absolutely hilarious, but it failed with the wrong ideas and jokes and didn't come out the way it could have been.The extra features are nothing to look forward to. The out-takes aren't funny, (except David Hasslehoff's, that made me laugh) the deleted scenes are pretty boring, the featurettes are slightly amusing in some parts. The alternate ending is ...eh. The commentary was buggered up because it actualy had JOKE COMMANTARY written on the back of the case. (2 thing's, don't write that it's a joke, it reuins it, and don't tell people there are eggs on the DVD, it's reuins the fact that there supposed to be hidden extras.. oh and 3, make the eggs worth looking at)but knowing it was a joke rueined the thing that I knew was an attempted false audio commantary to make you laugh,well it failed anyway, not much is funny about them arguing and pretending to hate each other and rustling chip packets and drinking beer, might have worked if they didnt write it was a joke on the case already before you've seen it. but then halfway through they decide to play the audio commantary from 'something about mary' which is stupid to do from the 40 minute mark to the very end of the credits, it did become quite boring after the 1st 10 minutes of listning to that half of it. There is a hidden audio commentary in the commentary selection screen if you press right on one of the options and you get to listen to the REAL commantary (WHY HIDE A COMMENTARY TRACK?). Still, there boring. The hidden eggs aren't worth looking at either.Dodge Ball failed to find it's mark because I had a hard time trying to figure out what kind of comedy it was supposed to be? Slapstick? Family? Smutty? or a Kids Comedy? But I could not just sit back and enjoy the film either, too much of it just didn't hit the right mark and was pretty cheap attempts at humour. Surprisingly tho it didn't contain a fart joke anywhere in the movie!!! The movie really needed to finish what it began with certain character elements and little things here and there. I'd recommend you watch BASEketball instead, yeah, watch the movie that this one tried to be in some ways.The movie has no lasting quality. I laughed at a few things the 1st time around. But on the second time around it was pretty stale. Ben Stiller's performance is very hard for me to watch. The humour doesn't last. It could have been such a better movie then it is. The bonus features are a snore fest. Cameos do not save the film, the movie might be a clich&eacute; of sports and to itself, but it's a ""seen it before"" movie. You have seen the basic element of this movies story line 1000 times. There is probably 2 lines in the whole movie I liked `cause I though they where funny and original, but not lasting or classic comedy.Thumbs down, but to say something good about the film, least it was better then a lot of the other junk released last year.And pretty much everyone I know whose seen this has the same reveiw as me... ""I did not like the movie, but I loved the line Rip Torn said"" so on that note let me say that this DVD is a iseless as a C*** flavoured lollypop.",2,The movie that barley dodged a 1 star rating

Add a love interest, and some excellent comedy, and you have ""Dodgeball"".I have a very violent sense of humour, (I thought ""Hannibal"" was a laugh, just to give you an idea), so ""Dodgeball"" really appealed to me. As others have mentioned, the ""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball"" scene is priceless in its comedy. To see the poor guy squirming on the floor in abject pain was truly hilarious.Additionally, Rip Torn and Hank Azaria as Patches O'Houlihan are both brilliant. Describing the game as ""degradation, violence and exclusion"" was genius, followed by more violent humour.Ben Stiller deserves special mention for his performance as White Goodman, the owner of Globo-Gym, the evil rival.

He also fails to see why he is less than the experts and thinks its ok to be average.Rip Torn is the ""famous"" patches o'toole, a champion dodge ball player from the fifties trying to get the average joes ready to win.There is nothing new in this movie that has not been covered better before.  But, don't let that stop you from buying this one.  It is the combinations of the cliches that make this movie so hysterical.  With allusions to the famous fitness gurus to the ""karate kid"", the movie actually works.  I thought the idea of championship dodge ball was so over the top until I saw championship dodge ball on a famous cable sports channel.

Whenever people were getting pelted in the faces with balls and wrenches I was laughing - hey, slapstick gets me everytime. But the tedious dialogue scenes when the point is being reinforced that Ben Stiller's character is a total a-hole...ok, ok - we get it.

Rarely is there a middle ground with these movies. In this case, they got it right, I nearly wet my pants several times.Globo Gym wants to buy out Joe's to turn it into a parking deck for their carb counting clientele. White acquires the mortgage and Average Joe's finds itself needing $50,000 in a month or face the wrecking ball. They soon find themselves entered in a $50K dodge ball tournament with the fate of the gyms hanging in the balance.The boys from Average Joe's are a bunch of uncoordinated spaz's, which makes for some hysterical scenes. But they get some help when they find a coach. The coach they find is former dodge ball champion Patches O'Houlihan, played by Rip Torn. One of his theories is if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball. So he likes to hurl huge pieces of some of Craftsman's finest products at the teams' heads. He also utters such words of encouragement as ""you're as useless as a poo flavored lollipop"". All of the characters are funny, but Patches was by far the best quote machine in the movie.There's something hilarious about seeing grown men hurl a rubber playground ball into one another's groin. But if that isn't enough, there are some great cameos and surprises in this movie. For once, the studio got it right and did not give away the best laughs in the trailer. And Dodgeball is one of those movies you're going to want to see at least twice because there are so many small touchs in the background that you cant possibly catch them all in one screening. I will give this one 5 stars, it's a must see, and I think a movie this funny is best seen the first time with a crowd.

But it's gags and cast and the choice of sport make it original enough that you can get over that.  I find it amusing that Christine Taylor had better on-screen chemistry with Vince Vaughn than her real-life husband, Ben Stiller...I ultimately atribute that to good acting, but it still amuses me.  Mr. Stiller made for an interesting villain...both creepy and intelligent (he had to be to build his fitness empire)...a dangerous combination.  The supporting cast were all wonderful, with Rip Torn as the wheelchair-using, foul-mouthed, abusive coach of the underdog team being my favorite.  I do wish we'd gotten more of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman, the Dodgeball tournament announcers, and less of Chuck Norris and Lance Armstrong.  Overall, if you like sports movies and/or comedies, this is a film to grab.  Enjoy...oh, and if you go out and start playing dodgeball, be careful.  Apparently Ben Stiller hit his wife, Christine Taylor, in the face during filming with a dodgeball...I'm sure it was accidental, but I still advise caution...you never know who might seek revenge.

Ben Stiller plays Dwight Goodman and ego maniac who is in love with himself. He is the owner and operator of  Globogym which looks like a gym we'd see the year 2040. Now there are problems at Peter LaFluers' Average Joes Gym which is right across the street from Globogym.  They are behind in their payments and need 50,000 dollars or Dwight will buy their gym.Peter LaFluers gyms consists of all emotionally crippled in some way members who work for him.  Peter will do anything to help them or make them happy.  This is the only place they go to find solitude from their unhappy lives. For them being able to go Average Joes Gym and just being there makes them happy.  Peter sees this and  doesn't want to lose Average Joes to Dwight. They finally agree to play Dodgeball because this is there only way of winning 50,000 dollars.  After beating one team they enter the finals. Dwight sees this and also enters the finals.Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn overhears Peters members in a bar being bullied by non other than Dwight himself. Dwights is tring to scare them out of not going to the finals. Patches see this and  decides to coach their team on how to play Dodgeball . Patches coaching starts off in a more violent way which makes for some really funny scenes. There are also hilarious moments where Ben Stiller tries to pick up Christine Taylor in all grotesque perverted ways. Watch Stiller talk during most of the movie he doesn't make any sense and its so funny.Both teams finally go to the dodgedball competition in Las Vegas to see if they can win and Stiller will do anything to stop that from happening by getting really violent.

624159,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMYF,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 6]","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called ""Average Joe's"" that caters to the....um...how shall we say it?... less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer.  Pete's patrons are all ""losers"" and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are.  The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place.  Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise.  To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships.  When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.Most of the humor in ""Dodgeball"" is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile.  Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy.  Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team.  The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film.  But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape.  Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film.",3,endearing slapstick comedy,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,2381,"['Dodgeball', 'True', 'Underdog', 'Story', 'just', 'enough', 'good-natured', 'low', 'brow', 'humor', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'always', 'as', 'funny', 'be.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'role', 'straight', 'man', 'Peter', 'La', 'Fleur', 'owner', 'third', 'rate', 'gym', 'called', 'Average', 'Joe', '.um', 'how', 'shall', 'say', 'less', 'athletically', 'inclined', 'less', 'single-mindedly', 'health-conscious', 'consumer', 'Pete', 'patrons', 'are', 'losers', 'social', 'outcasts', 'who', 'find', 'Average', 'Joe', 'one', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'camaraderie', 'be', 'accepted', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'problem', 'poor', 'business', 'management', 'Peter', 'virtually', 'bankrupted', 'establishment', 'tune', '50,000', 'be', 'paid', 'off', 'pronto', 'maintain', 'ownership', 'place', 'Enter', 'White', 'Goodman', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'self-made', 'egomaniacal', 'owner', 'top-of-the-line', 'gym', 'street', 'who', 'determined', 'force', 'Peter', 'business', 'make', 'part', 'own', 'franchise', 'raise', 'money', 'Pete', 'comrades', 'form', 'ragtag', 'dodge', 'ball', 'team', 'head', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'compete', 'national', 'championships', 'When', 'Goodman', 'wind', 'plan', 'own', 'team', 'take', 'Average', 'Joe', 'less-than-average', 'players', 'David', 'Goliath', 'showdown', 'broadcast', 'nationwide', 'TV.Most', 'humor', 'Dodgeball', 'Three', 'Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin', 'variety', 'pretty', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'even', 'tend', 'become', 'bit', 'strained', 'repetitious', 'awhile', 'Vaughn', 'Stiller', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'playing', 'off', 'one', 'former', 'carefully', 'low', 'balling', 'performance', 'latter', 'bursts', 'forth', 'no-holds-barred', 'display', 'manic', 'energy', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'also', 'lovely', 'fine', 'bank', 'accountant', 'who', 'rummaging', 'Peter', 'financial', 'records', 'up', 'star', 'player', 'team', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'host', 'effective', 'cameo', 'performances', 'likes', 'William', 'Shatner', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Lance', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'really', 'mark', 'short', 'pivotal', 'well', 'written', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'real', 'acting', 'honors', 'go', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'crazy', 'wheelchair-bound', 'coach', 'who', 'mighty', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'whip', 'boys', 'shape', 'Torn', 'undisputed', 'comic', 'force', 'center', 'film']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition

I understand the role reversal idea where the tall hunky like vince vaughn ends up being the under dog everyman type guy and 5 foot nothing ben stiller is the greasy bad guy. Problem is it doesn't work. Stiller comes across as a comic book character and vaughn's understated humor is nearly comatose. The writing is horrible so of course the script is included with the dvd so you can read how horrible it is. It's bad!Ben stiller plays this sleazy ceo of a multimillion dolar health club who i guess is really trying to overcome his own feelings of inferiority though the writing does little to flesh that out. He does have the blow up crotch in his spandex to make it look like he has more than he does ha ha. Vaughn's character owns a run down nearly bankrupt gym right across the street called ""average joe's"". Average joe's is no threat to the bigger gym so of course the stiller character is obsessed with taking it over. That would be tragic because all the nerds at average joe's have nothing else. Like we should care? The message here is that owners of successful businesses are egomaniacal facists, nazis? While owners of failed businesses are laid back cool guys? Note that the name of the ben stiller character ""white"" goodman. Make up your own mind what that is supposed to represent.Anyway the mean facist ""white"" goodman is going after average joe's so now the vaughn character and his merry band of nerds needs to find a way to get $50,000 to keep average joe's and stop him. How do you raise 50K in america? Well win a nationwide dodge ball tourney of course. So they sign up and who will they play in the championship? A team led by the facist ""white"" goodman. What a shock. And you don't even need to guess who wins.In between all this you have numerous gags, about three dozen times someone will take a hit to the crotch and various cameo appearences by famous people. Some of the gags and lines are funny like when the stiller character asks the pretty christine taylor(his real life wife) if she would like to mate. She then gags and says ""i just vomited in my mouth"". Most are not funny.All in all there are some funny moments but you never buy into the whole plot line. You could care less about any of the average joe's characters and vince vaughn's character is vegetated. He is usually smiling wryly and little else. Ben stiller's character is so bizzare, so weird you can't take him seriously enough to hate him.Not even in the same league as something about mary.

To keep from getting their gym bought by the megalomaniac fitness guru White Goodman (played with over-the-top creepiness by Ben Stiller), Peter Le Fleur (Vince Vaughn) and his ensemble of odd companions must raise 50,000 dollars in 30 days.  They do so by entering a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament, which will be broadcast on ESPN 8 (""The Ocho"").First they must qualify in a regional championship, which they win only because one member of the Girl Scout troupe who trounces them on the court tests positive for various enhancement drugs.  After that, they get taken under the wing of a crazy wheelchair-bound ex-dodgeball player, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), whose tactics include making the team dodge wrenches and oncoming traffic.  Once in Las Vegas, they will have to compete against White Goodman and the musclebound team he's put together, after going head-to-head with a number of other teams, including a group of hardcore German players coached by a brutal David Hasslehoff.One reason the movie works so well is because Vaughn plays his character in a laidback, smart-alecky way, which balances all the weirdness surrounding him.  The supporting cast is memorable and strong: there's a middle-aged nerd who can only really play well when he loses his temper, a high school geek with surprising cheerleading skills, a man who's convinced he's a pirate, and a few other endearing misfits.  There's also a love interest played by Christine Taylor, who has a strong head and can really pack a punch.Dodgeball is crude, plays to certain stereotypes, but also breaks the mold in other ways and manages to be endearing and have loveable characters.

I found that you have to press enter right when he snaps his fingers. It's kind of hard to get it right, but it does work.I absolutely LOVE this movie!! I even stepped out of my preferred genre of action/horror/sci-fi movies to add it to my collection. This hilarious movie is better seen unrated, but if you don't want children to see it, or you just don't want to see it, you aren't missing much. Which is wonderful, because you don't want to miss any of this hilarious comedy. Patches' training procedure is enough to make yourself roll on the floor laughing. How Ben Stiller, Rip Torn, and Vince Vaughn say all those hilarious things with a straight face is beyond me, but it's funny as all get out! Although...I must say that I really hope you aren't drinking any liquids or are tired from laughing already....I really do...because the ending credits are priceless!!! It's too funny!

It relies on something extremely simple: the inherent funniness of seeing someone get hit in the head.  Thurber's screenplay piles joke upon joke - both visual and verbal - to the point of near-hysteria, especially during the training sequences and the early rounds of the tournament. Ben Stiller is marvellous as the ludicrously narcissistic/neurotic White Goodman, and the perfect foil to Vince Vaughn's almost somnambulistically unmotivated Peter La Fleur.  The supporting cast and cameos are all great, but in the end it's Thurber's relentlessly witty screenplay that shines.  It has a reassuring awareness of its own absurdity (from the elaborate subtitle, right down to the ""Deus Ex Machina"" emblazoned on the cash chest at the end), but respects the genre just enough to become one of its shining examples.

624182,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00005JMYF,Tim Janson,"[0, 1]","Dodgeball is nothing new when it comes to its plot.  It's been one of the most commonly used plots over the past 25 years or so with movies like The Bad News Bears, Major League, Mighty Ducks, and Necessary Roughness.  Basically a group of losers comes together to win the big game and save the day.  In this case Peter (Vince Vaughn) owns a run down old gym called ""Average Joes"".  He's behind on all his bills and hasn't collected membership dues in over a year.  He needs to come up with $50,000 in a month to save the gym from being taken over by his rival across the street Globo Gym.Globo Gym is run by White Goodman (Stiller) a blow-dryer headed, Tony Little-like obnoxious egomaniac.  The bank brings in a tax attorney kate (Christine Taylor) to go over Average Joe's financial records and to fight off the sleazy Goodman who is constantly hitting on her.To save the Gym, Peter and his rag-tag group of gym misfits decide to enter a dodgeball tournament where the top prize is, of course, $50,000.  Problem is the group has no idea how to play the game and little talent until an ancient doggeball coach, Patches O'hoolihan (Rip Torn) comes in as their mentor.  Well you can pretty much guess the story from here, Right?  No need for me to play spoiler.Despite its forula script, Dodgeball has some funny scenes involving its crew of misfit players.  Such as when they try and raise the money by having a car wash...we cut to a scene of gorgeous women in bikinis getting all wet and soapy and a long line of cars waiting...trouble is...that this is across the street and Average Joe's ""All male"" car wash has only one customer, a big, redneck who keeps paying the young Justin to wash his pickup over and over again.Stiller plays his role way over the top as a dimwitted diet and workout guru similar to the people you see on late night infomercials.  Stepehen Root plays Gordon, a whipped nebbish type not too unlike the role he played in Office Space.

624184,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B00005JMYF,T O'Brien,"[2, 3]","Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a really fun summer comedy with a hilarious cast.  Peter LaFleur's Average Joe's Gym is going to be shut down in a month by rival Globo Gym is he cannot come up with $50,000.  One of the gym members comes up with an idea how to get the money; win a $50,000 dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas and save the gym.  Globo Gym's evil owner, White Goodman, discovers their plan and enters his own team in the tournament so that he can officially put Average Joe's out of business.  The plot is pretty straightforward throughout.  The whole movie is basically an excuse to show people getting drilled by red rubber balls.  Plenty of great quotes throughout that will keep you rolling around on the ground.  Not as good as Anchorman, another summer comedy, but still well worth a watch.Vince Vaughn is great as the straight-faced owner of Average Joe's, Peter LaFleur.  He delivers his lines so calmly that sometimes you miss how funny he is.  Ben Stiller is great in an over-the-top part as Globo Gym owner White Goodman.  His character is so mind-numbingly stupid that he's funny.  Christine Taylor plays Kate Veatch, a bank employee who teams up with LaFleur to save the gym and beat Globo Gym.  Rip Torn steals the show as Patches O'Houlihan, a dodgeball coach from the 1950's who tries to teach LaFleur and his team how to play the sport.  LaFleur's team includes Justin Long, Stephen Root, Joel Moore, Chris Williams, and Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, cast and crew commentary, seven deleted/extended scenes, an alternate ending that should have been used, four featurettes, a bloopers/gag reel, and six easter eggs hidden in the menus.

The facility's ecclectic clientele of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman, the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds, and their own ineptitude,to try to save Average Joe's. By having a showdown dodgeball competition against Globo Gym. From the supporting cast and the cameo's everyone does a top notch job.  It's stupid, sure, but it's so hilarious, you don't care.

But I like 'Dodgeball' because of that, and if you love kind of a comedy like 'There's Something About Mary,' this film is for you.Story?  It's about a bunch of underdogs who need money very badly.  So they join in the national dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas to get $50,000.  That's it, and they form a ragtag team called 'Average Joes' while another team attempt to crush them, called 'Purple Cobras.'Vince Vaughn, cast against type, plays the reluctant leader of 'Joes' and Ben Stiller plays the greedy gym owner named 'White Goodman.'  Add to them, Christine Taylor (Ben's real-life wife) joins in the cast as the lawyer who is sexually harassed by Mr. Goodman.  Is there any depth, subtle touch, or social message?  But should there be any?[SLAPSTICKS AND CAMEOS] Rip Torn's funny dodgeball coach says, 'If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.'  Right?  In fact, red rubber balls fly around and hit the characters in the face.  The traditional slapstick comedy like pie-throwing is done in another style, with more energy and vitality, with lots of raucous humor.  Dirty languages abound, and the gags are often very sexual.  Plus, you see many cameos -- William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Hank Azaria, David Hasselhoff (as German coach), and Lance Armstrong -- all of them adding more unexpected humor to the film.I don't say this is the best comedy of the decade, but it is true I enjoyed watching the film very much.  Silly, to be sure, but sometimes, just sometimes, absolute silliness with unstoppable energy produces a hilarious comedy like this.

It sounds like it has a decent plot, it's a comedy, and it's got Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn so it has to be fairly good."" Then you get home and watch the movie and can't believe how terrible it is. That's how I felt about DODGEBALL.The set up of the movie is promising. Average Joes, a small time gym, has their mortgage purchased by Global Gym. The guy in charge of Global Gym hates the guy in charge of Average Joes. He thinks Average Joes is competing for his business and wants to turn Average Joes into a parking garage. The guys at Average Joes have to come up with $50,000 or their place is gone. That's where the dodgeball comes into play. The World Dodgeball Championships are being held in a few weeks in Las Vegas and the prize for the winning team is $50,000. But things go horribly wrong.There are a lot of funny lines in DODGEBALL. Ben Stiller is hilarious for most of the movie (basically reprising his role of Tony Serkis from HEAVYWEIGHTS but for an adult audience), Vince Vaughn is witty as ever, Rip Torn is a riot as the team's personal trainer who comes out of retirement, and the movie has Lance Armstrong in one of the best movie cameos of the early 2000s.But there's a hitch. Instead of going the high road of comedy DODGEBALL plays to the lowest common denominator and the movie drastically suffers. Foul language, crude jokes, every other sentence is filled with sexual innuendo. There's one scene where a group of young women are washing cars with their cleavage and there's another scene where Stiller's character uses a slice of pizza as Gold Bond. The movie promises to be hilarious, but it turns out to be a cruel, crude joke.If you like the types of comedies that Judd Apatow directs and writes or are a fan of THE HANGOVER, then you'll probably enjoy DODGEBALL. Personally, I like my comedies a little less crude. As for the movie being ""A True Underdog Story"", that's just part of the gimmick.

A true comedy in every sense of the word it will have you rolling in laughter and remembering your own experiences with the dreaded dodgeball.In a world of infomercials and faultless people resides the perfect man, White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Goodman owns and controls a state of the art health club and spends his life combing his feathered hair, pumping up and electrocuting himself over donut and pizza cravings. With a personality as shallow as his appearance he is a true specimen of gag reflex in motion! Across the street is a run down gym for ""Average Joes"" run by a hapless man of little ambition, Pete La Fleur (Vince Vaughn). Goodman and La Fleur soon begin a power struggle over ownership of his little gym and the games begin. SMACK! SPLAT! In order to come up with $50K to save the average joes from being eaten alive by White's arrogant conglomeration La Fleur and his gang of misfit members join a dodgeball tournament. With all seriousness the nerds begin to work out with a legend in the sport and after getting hit by iron wrenches and plenty of balls they end up in Las Vegas for the championship. Needless to say Mr. White and his robotic over-steroided team are also willing to be turned into pulp by a bunch of flying balls...Ouch!!Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are incredible in their roles as very serious gym owners and it is absolutely impossible not to laugh while watching this film. Christine Taylor (Stiller's real life wife) does an excellent job as the girl both over jockulated men eventually vie for. Rip Torn is hilarious as the urine drinking dodgeball legend who eventually coaches greatness from his wheelchair. The gags and stabs at seekers of perfection are downright on the money with plenty of pumped up pecs and abs to fill an egotists dream. The average joes are all absolutely side-splitting with their uncoordinated efforts and messed up lives. The tournament is filled with subtle innuendos directed at everything funny about Japanese, German, Eastern European and Red Neck American athletes as well as that ever present superior being the Bodybuilder! Cameo appearances by Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff offer a few short moments of additional laughs. But the real hero of this film is the dodgeball itself, that red ball that has instilled so much fear in anyone who has ever faced it while hugging onto a wall cringing.

That opportunity came in the form of the movie Dodgeball.  Here Stiller re-teams with Starsky and Hutch bad-guy Vince Vaughan, and they switch roles: this time around, Stiller is bad-guy gym owner White Goodman, while Vaughan is good-guy gym owner Peter LeFleur. The results are totally hilarious--I swear I started laughing at the beginning of this movie and didn't stop until it was over.  This one is easily one of the funniest movies of 2004!I'm convinced that Ben Stiller is doing what he was brought upon this Earth to do, and he does it with superior skill. Vince Vaughan's role in this movie is very conservative, but still packs the necessary comedic punch.

624196,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JMYF,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 6]","Basically, my thoughts about this movie can be summed up in the title of this review.  A family member of mine got this movie as a gift last Christmas, and just recently I was in a ""comedy"" mood and gave it a viewing.  By the end of the film, though, the only person I was laughing at was myself for sitting through the whole thing.The problems with this film are numerous: The jokes rely way too much on crude humor, they often aren't even funny in that area, and the goal of the film (to combine comedy with an even somewhat compelling storyline) is not even close to realized.  About the only positive impact this movie had on society was to get people playing the game of dodgeball once again.  Yet, it was no thanks to the jokes in this movie...just the base subject matter.Thus, if you are looking for 90 minutes of laughter, please look elsewhere.  Only a couple of decently funny scenarios kept this movie away from a bottom-of-the-barrel one star rating, and a ""1.5 stars"" would have been the optimal rating.  Fans of Ben Stiller will find Zoolander to offer more genuine laughs, while others may want to steer clear of this entire comedy genre altogether.",2,"How Many Jokes About ""Balls"" Can Be Made In 90 Minutes?",1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,1165,"['Basically', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'title', 'review', 'family', 'member', 'mine', 'got', 'movie', 'gift', 'last', 'Christmas', 'just', 'recently', 'was', 'comedy', 'mood', 'gave', 'viewing', 'end', 'film', 'though', 'only', 'person', 'was', 'laughing', 'was', 'sitting', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'problems', 'film', 'are', 'numerous', 'jokes', 'rely', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'crude', 'humor', 'often', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'area', 'goal', 'film', 'combine', 'comedy', 'even', 'somewhat', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'realized', 'only', 'positive', 'impact', 'movie', 'had', 'society', 'was', 'get', 'people', 'playing', 'game', 'dodgeball', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'thanks', 'jokes', 'movie', 'just', 'base', 'subject', 'matter.Thus', 'are', 'looking', '90', 'minutes', 'laughter', 'please', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Only', 'couple', 'decently', 'funny', 'scenarios', 'kept', 'movie', 'away', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'one', 'star', 'rating', '1.5', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'optimal', 'rating', 'Fans', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'will', 'find', 'Zoolander', 'offer', 'more', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'others', 'may', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'entire', 'comedy', 'genre', 'altogether']",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story Full Screen Edition
