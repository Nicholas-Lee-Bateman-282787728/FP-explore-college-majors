The thing about R Lee is he is 100% sincere in his love for the Corps but he's also a born performer and it comes thru in his presentation of the show. What is unexpected is how funny he is and loveable he comes across in all the episodes. Like many of us I revered him in the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"" but you owe it to yourself if your a true fan to check him out in the comedy ""Saving Silverman"". The series Mail Call is one of my very favorite shows and this SNAFU DVD is great!",5,Hilarious out-takes from the Gunny,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,551,"['like', 'Mail', 'Call', 'show', 'will', 'love', 'blooper', 'version', 'thing', 'R', 'Lee', '100', '%', 'sincere', 'love', 'Corps', 'also', 'born', 'performer', 'thru', 'presentation', 'show', 'What', 'unexpected', 'how', 'funny', 'loveable', 'episodes', 'many', 'revered', 'movie', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'owe', 'yourself', 'true', 'fan', 'check', 'out', 'comedy', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'series', 'Mail', 'Call', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'shows', 'SNAFU', 'DVD', 'great']",Mail Call - Snafu DVD
