991169,AFHKFOO046N00,B000FILVFA,"Akela ""smiling wolf""","[9, 14]","Gosh, this is -without any trace of a doubt - THE  silliest and stupidest movie I have even seen.In the Soviet Russia in the 80s, when I was in the university, the only source of information about Western (made in West, not just the cowboy stuff) movies - besides the officially approved and thus empty editions - was a couple of obscure and very cheezy Polish magazines, printed on bad paper with smudged photos and unreadable texts. ""Gwendoline"" was a sensation with them and they dedicated article after article to the movie (they did the same with Emmanuelle and other softcore masterpieces).So I finally decided to find out what was all the frenzy about.Well , the 70s and 80s are over (thanks for small mercies) and the movie proved to be so bad, that it is not even good. You know, how we often say - oh, it is so bad it is delicious. This is not the case. This one clearly transcends the stage ""so bad, it is actully good"" and goes into ""oh boy, bad is not the word"".Even softcore adventures should have at least one good idea, one good laugh and one good line per movie. This one does not. Girls look good (nobody argues) , the boy looks great (very neat six-pack) , costumes (if you can call them that) are rather abbreviated.Usually when I do not like a movie and do not intend to keep it, I give it away. In this  case I dropped it into trash as I would have been too ashamed to give it to anybody - not because of the naked bodies, but due to sheer stupidy of the film.",1,"""don't put it away... throw it with great force!""",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,1482,"['Gosh', 'trace', 'doubt', 'silliest', 'stupidest', 'movie', 'have', 'even', 'seen.In', 'Soviet', 'Russia', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'university', 'only', 'source', 'information', 'Western', 'made', 'West', 'not', 'just', 'cowboy', 'stuff', 'movies', 'officially', 'approved', 'thus', 'empty', 'editions', 'was', 'couple', 'obscure', 'very', 'cheezy', 'Polish', 'magazines', 'printed', 'bad', 'paper', 'smudged', 'photos', 'unreadable', 'texts', 'Gwendoline', 'was', 'sensation', 'dedicated', 'article', 'article', 'movie', 'did', 'same', 'Emmanuelle', 'other', 'softcore', 'masterpieces', '.So', 'finally', 'decided', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'frenzy', 'about.Well', '70s', '80s', 'are', 'thanks', 'small', 'mercies', 'movie', 'proved', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'know', 'how', 'often', 'say', 'oh', 'so', 'bad', 'delicious', 'not', 'case', 'one', 'clearly', 'stage', 'so', 'bad', 'actully', 'good', 'oh', 'boy', 'bad', 'not', 'word', '.Even', 'softcore', 'adventures', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'idea', 'one', 'good', 'laugh', 'one', 'good', 'line', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'Girls', 'look', 'good', 'nobody', 'boy', 'great', 'very', 'neat', 'six-pack', 'costumes', 'can', 'call', 'are', 'rather', 'abbreviated.Usually', 'when', 'do', 'not', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'intend', 'keep', 'give', 'away', 'case', 'dropped', 'trash', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'ashamed', 'give', 'anybody', 'not', 'naked', 'bodies', 'due', 'sheer', 'stupidy', 'film']",Gwendoline

991177,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000FILVFA,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[89, 97]","I have been wanting to pick up this obscure movie for years, ever since I first watched it some 12 years ago.  Unfortunately, up until now it has been out of print - even on VHS.  I was un-willing to pay an obnoxious price for a used version on Video tape.  Now there is no reason to fret any more:  Gwendoline is here & she's on DVD!!!The original title of the film was The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak.  It is basically a low-budget INDIANA JONES type of adventure movie, only with a whole lot more erotica mixed in. One could say there are elements of Monty Python as well. Brent Huff plays a Harrison Ford wannabe.  He has a great physique for an adventure movie, but he's not a particularly good actor.  The third major character is Gwendoline's sidekick / friend, Beth (played by French actress Zabou).The overwhelming reason to buy this DVD may be summed up in 3 words: Tawny Kitaen topless!  While she has stripped down in a few other movies (such as WITCHBOARD), one needs to have the pause button on the DVD remote handy to get a good look.  Not so with this film.  She is topless throughout most of the 2nd half of the film - and that's a very good thing!!!I can't for the life of me understand why Tawny has not had a more robust acting career or why she didn't make many more movies.  For one thing, there have not been too many female redhead movie stars.  Tawny is gorgeous and there are a few scenes in this film where she is absolutely ravishing - to the extent that she took my breath away.  She is also a better actress than a great many women in Hollywood.To be sure, this is a very corny movie.  Tawny and Zabou are good actors;  the rest of the cast are all a bit stilted.  I believe it was originally in French as the people all suffer from dubbing-man's disease.  However, it is also a very fun movie, and I had forgotten just how cute Zabou is.So, if you are even a remote fan of Tawny Kitaen you need to JUMP at the opportunity to buy this one.  It's a feel good movie and Tawny is the one who will making you feel good!",5,FINALLY!!,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2065,"['have', 'been', 'wanting', 'pick', 'up', 'obscure', 'movie', 'years', 'ever', 'first', 'watched', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'Unfortunately', 'up', 'now', 'been', 'print', 'even', 'VHS', 'was', 'un-willing', 'pay', 'obnoxious', 'price', 'used', 'version', 'Video', 'tape', 'Now', 'reason', 'fret', 'more', 'Gwendoline', 'here', 'DVD', 'original', 'title', 'film', 'was', 'Perils', 'Gwendoline', 'Land', 'Yik', 'Yak', 'basically', 'low-budget', 'INDIANA', 'JONES', 'type', 'adventure', 'movie', 'only', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'erotica', 'mixed', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'are', 'elements', 'Monty', 'Python', 'as', 'well', 'Brent', 'Huff', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'wannabe', 'great', 'physique', 'adventure', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'actor', 'third', 'major', 'character', 'Gwendoline', 'sidekick', '/', 'friend', 'Beth', 'played', 'French', 'actress', 'Zabou', '.The', 'overwhelming', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVD', 'may', 'be', 'summed', 'up', '3', 'words', 'Tawny', 'Kitaen', 'topless', 'stripped', 'down', 'few', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'WITCHBOARD', 'one', 'have', 'pause', 'button', 'DVD', 'remote', 'handy', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'Not', 'so', 'film', 'topless', 'most', '2nd', 'half', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'Tawny', 'not', 'had', 'more', 'robust', 'acting', 'career', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'more', 'movies', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'too', 'many', 'female', 'redhead', 'movie', 'stars', 'Tawny', 'gorgeous', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'absolutely', 'ravishing', 'extent', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'also', 'better', 'actress', 'great', 'many', 'women', 'Hollywood.To', 'be', 'sure', 'very', 'corny', 'movie', 'Tawny', 'Zabou', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'bit', 'stilted', 'believe', 'was', 'originally', 'French', 'people', 'suffer', 'dubbing-man', 'disease', 'However', 'also', 'very', 'fun', 'movie', 'had', 'forgotten', 'just', 'how', 'cute', 'Zabou', 'is.So', 'are', 'even', 'remote', 'fan', 'Tawny', 'Kitaen', 'need', 'JUMP', 'opportunity', 'buy', 'one', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Tawny', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'making', 'feel', 'good']",Gwendoline

This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend.But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn't force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It's not a good adventure film, and it's certainly not erotic.There's a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust.",1,"Potentially very hot, but sucked instead!",1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,847,"['generally', 'French-comic-books-turned-into-movies', ""'re"", 'usually', 'pretty', 'erotic', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'role', 'Barbarella', 'mind', 'Gwendoline', 'series', 'definitely', 'had', 'POTENTIAL', 'what', 'scantily-clad', 'women-in-bondage', 'theme', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Gwendoline', 'dominant', 'girlfriend.But', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Tawney', 'Kitaen', 'cast', 'Gwendoline', 'apparently', 'balked', 'doing', 'girl/girl', 'scenes', 'was', '1984', 'so', 'producers', 'obligingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'force', 'do', 'result', 'one', 'turned', 'very', 'bland', 'weak', 'diluted', 'version', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'not', 'good', 'adventure', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'little', 'nudity', 'ridiculous', 'moments', 'are', 'supposed', 'capture', 'kinkiness', 'French', 'comics', 'overall', 'one', 'was', 'disappointing', 'bust']",Gwendoline

Miller,"[1, 1]","I bought this movie because I thought Justin Jaeckin's movie version of ""The Story of O"" was ""pretty good"" (about a B- overall), and because the many still photos from this movie (available on the web, through an easy Google search) looked interesting.  I'd hoped for a ""Indiana Jones meets Story of O"" theme, and the movie makes an attempt to deliver, with an unexpected dose of comedy.  Unfortunately, unlike ""O"" (and ""Indiana Jones""), the acting in this movie was unbelievably awful, and was in fact rather silly in some cases, as was the writing.  The ""visuals"" were pretty good, that is, there were plenty of pretty women wearing very limited clothing, put into some intriguing situations, and well photographed as they sorted it out.  The movie may bear a second viewing, although that seems doubtful, at least in the near future.  I think the best thing I can say about ""Gwendoline"" is that I've seen worse.  If one star is the lowest possible score, and five is the highest, then I'd have to give ""Gwendoline"" about two stars, with the best part of that score going to the photography and the somewhat successful attempts to be funny.",2,"B+ visuals, otherwise awful",1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1142,"['bought', 'movie', 'thought', 'Justin', 'Jaeckin', 'movie', 'version', 'Story', 'O', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'B-', 'overall', 'many', 'still', 'photos', 'movie', 'available', 'web', 'easy', 'Google', 'search', 'looked', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'meets', 'Story', 'O', 'theme', 'movie', 'attempt', 'deliver', 'unexpected', 'dose', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'O', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'awful', 'was', 'fact', 'rather', 'silly', 'cases', 'was', 'writing', 'visuals', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'were', 'plenty', 'pretty', 'women', 'wearing', 'very', 'limited', 'clothing', 'put', 'intriguing', 'situations', 'well', 'photographed', 'sorted', 'out', 'movie', 'may', 'bear', 'second', 'viewing', 'doubtful', 'least', 'near', 'future', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Gwendoline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'one', 'star', 'lowest', 'possible', 'score', 'five', 'highest', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'give', 'Gwendoline', 'two', 'stars', 'best', 'part', 'score', 'going', 'photography', 'somewhat', 'successful', 'attempts', 'be', 'funny']",Gwendoline

991190,A3747YPXOBXRAT,B000FILVFA,Stephen Mann,"[0, 0]","What a daft movie.A comedy skin flick of sorts, or it would be if Tawny Kitaen would just lower her bloody hands. And her elbows. We get a couple of short flashes of the forbidden fruit but then she covers up again. Why is a mystery, since she must have known she wasn't hired for her acting skills (which can be seen in all their glory in 'Bachelor Party' and it doesn't get any better than that here). What little plot there is is Barbarella-esque, but the payoff isn't there because 80s Kitaen seems nowhere near as at-ease sans clothing in front of the camera as 60s Fonda was. Shame, because she had a nice bod in those days. I guess she figured she was no Fonda, able to build a sleazey T&A; movie into a career in the mainstream.I'll pull a star for her behavior and another for general lack of oomf. This sort of movie should stack up against Barbarella and Emmanuelle and it lacks the humor of the former, the lush production of the latter and the plot and eye-candy of either, at least until the last 20 minutes. Some of the stuff in the ""torture chamber"" is rather cleverly done but then the spikes all turn out to be rubber. We can tell because the ""actors"" forget to not lean on them every so often.There's a Ben Hur-esque chase involving chariots drawn by teams of bare-breasted girls but for pony girls there's precious little  of the equestrian about their costuming. Also, if you want to wave a whip around while the sound FX cracks but you *don't* want to hit anyone, use long-handled buggy whips rather than having the wielders wave coiled bullwhips around in the air. Important fetish trotting tip there, sadly one which the director was not privy to.How Just Jaeckin was involved with this I'll never know.

Scarillo ""music snob""","[4, 4]","I had never seen ""Gwendoline"" (or, ""Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak"", as it was titled in its shorter US version, though the film itself was made by the French director Just Jaeckin, who did an Emmanuelle film, which i'm sure i saw on Showtime back around 1985) prior to watching this uncut version, though most guys might remember it well from the 80's, since it came out around when Tawny Kitaen made a name for herself in ""Bachelor Party"".  Most guys who came of age in the 80's would likely know the film because there's a TON of topless nudity in the second half of it - it's akin to a film like ""Barbarella"" in that it's derived from a French comic and there's a highly sexual element to it, but to tell the truth, the film/story (about a young woman who is searching for her father & a rare butterfly, and discovers a society of warrior-like women) is really not that good and the acting is pretty uniformly subpar.  I'd be curious what was cut from this, that created the edited version, because there's not a whole lot of plot to begin with?  I WILL say, however, that this uncut director's cut has a REALLY good transfer (in 2:35:1 widescreen) and the image is very sharp, and this wasn't even a blu-ray.  Extras are ok - trailers, commentary, some other ancillary interview footage.  I can't imagine anyone would want to watch this more than once, unless you're a devout Tawny fan, but to each his own.
