803944,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B0001FVEDG,Duane Thomas,"[36, 39]","Female Prisoner #701 - Scorpion stars the beautiful and talented Japanese actress Meiko Kaji, best known for playing Lady Snowblood and singing ""Flower of Carnage,"" the title song to Kill Bill. This movie has everything to be a fine example of the ""women in prison"" film genre: stabbings, shootings, rape, lesbian sex, torture (scaldings, beatings, burnings, women hung by ropes from their elbows) and lots and lots of female nudity.

803945,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0001FVEDG,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[17, 19]","Uttering as few words as possible, Nami Matsushima (played by the stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji) dispenses with the pleasantries and builds a reasonably impressive body count by the end of ""Female Prisoner 701: Scorpion,"" one of the premiere films in the women's prison genre of films.Natsuyagi is a cop looking to move ahead in his life, and money, after all, is the root of all evil.  He hatches a scheme to use his lovely girlfriend, Nami, to lure the local mafia bosses into a scheme.  But when the gang feels something's amiss, they escort Nami into a back room and rape her.  Breaking in, Natsuyagi realizes he finally has what he wants: ignoring his fallen girlfriend, he convinces the mob that he can make all of their problems go away if they pay him off.  They agree, and Natsuyagi has Nami thrown into prison ... where she undergoes the obligatory beatings, teasing, and other forms of degradation so common to 'girls behind bars' films.What makes ""Scorpion"" different is the fact that Director Shunya Ito - in his debut film - decided to ride the fine line between art and trash.  He combines the best elements of the vindictive woman's feature along with artsy lighting in order to achieve the effect of a car crash: the viewer really hates to slow down and watch, but there really must be something to see here, right?  The violence is gratuitous, if not psychedelic, at times, but it all manages to flesh out (pun intended) before Nami manages to finally break out of prison and go on her murderous rampage, taking out the mobsters one-by-one until her final showdown with the unsuspecting Natsuyagi.Also, in Kaji's graceful hands, Nami isn't so much a victim as she is an antihero, not at all unlike Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.  The viewer is pulled into this world by means of a very beautiful woman who refuses to be a 'prisoner' to the genre.  Instead, she's defiant and calculating at every turn, refusing to comply with the warden's demands of good behavior.  She challenges every authority, instituting her own code of justice which applies to everyone: her fellow inmates, the prison guards, and even the police outside.  Uncompromising in her dedication, she ignores the acts she endures for the sake of focusing on one sole objective: revenge.... and that's an act she takes with complete seriousness.NOTE: Apparently, there is an issue associated to subtitling, as has been referred by other reviewers.  I had no problem whatsoever, but I would add that the film would not play with the correct aspect ratio of 2:35:1 in my American DVD player.  I did have to watch the film in my Region Free player, and I did not experience any problems.",4,Antihero of the (S)exploitation Film,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,2692,"['Uttering', 'few', 'words', 'possible', 'Nami', 'Matsushima', 'played', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Meiko', 'Kaji', 'pleasantries', 'reasonably', 'impressive', 'body', 'count', 'end', 'Female', 'Prisoner', '701', 'Scorpion', 'one', 'premiere', 'films', 'women', 'prison', 'genre', 'films.Natsuyagi', 'cop', 'looking', 'move', 'ahead', 'life', 'money', 'root', 'evil', 'scheme', 'use', 'lovely', 'girlfriend', 'Nami', 'lure', 'local', 'mafia', 'bosses', 'scheme', 'when', 'gang', 'something', 'amiss', 'escort', 'Nami', 'back', 'room', 'rape', 'Breaking', 'Natsuyagi', 'finally', 'what', 'ignoring', 'fallen', 'girlfriend', 'mob', 'can', 'make', 'problems', 'go', 'away', 'pay', 'off', 'agree', 'Natsuyagi', 'Nami', 'thrown', 'prison', 'where', 'obligatory', 'beatings', 'teasing', 'other', 'forms', 'degradation', 'so', 'common', ""'girls"", 'bars', 'films.What', 'Scorpion', 'different', 'fact', 'Director', 'Shunya', 'Ito', 'debut', 'film', 'decided', 'ride', 'fine', 'line', 'art', 'trash', 'best', 'elements', 'vindictive', 'woman', 'feature', 'artsy', 'lighting', 'order', 'achieve', 'effect', 'car', 'crash', 'viewer', 'really', 'slow', 'down', 'watch', 'really', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'see', 'here', 'right', 'violence', 'gratuitous', 'not', 'psychedelic', 'times', 'flesh', 'out', 'pun', 'intended', 'Nami', 'finally', 'break', 'prison', 'go', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'taking', 'out', 'mobsters', 'one-by-one', 'final', 'showdown', 'unsuspecting', 'Natsuyagi.Also', 'Kaji', 'graceful', 'hands', 'Nami', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'victim', 'antihero', 'not', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'viewer', 'pulled', 'world', 'means', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'be', ""'prisoner"", 'genre', 'Instead', 'defiant', 'calculating', 'turn', 'refusing', 'comply', 'warden', 'demands', 'good', 'behavior', 'authority', 'instituting', 'own', 'code', 'justice', 'everyone', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'prison', 'guards', 'even', 'police', 'Uncompromising', 'dedication', 'acts', 'sake', 'focusing', 'one', 'sole', 'objective', 'revenge', 'act', 'complete', 'seriousness.NOTE', 'Apparently', 'issue', 'associated', 'subtitling', 'been', 'referred', 'other', 'reviewers', 'had', 'problem', 'whatsoever', 'would', 'add', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'correct', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2:35:1', 'American', 'DVD', 'player', 'did', 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'Region', 'Free', 'player', 'did', 'not', 'experience', 'problems']",Female Prisoner #701 - Scorpion
803946,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0001FVEDG,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 3]","Maybe it was because it was Japanese. Maybe I didn't read enough reviews, but I wasn't expecting a W.I.P. flick. I thought I was walking into a crime thriller. Wrong!!! This is exploitation pure and simple. About the only thing interesting to me was that I thought these kinds of flicks were a purely American phenomenon.Here's the scoop. Our heroine is locked up in prison after being duped by her detective boyfriend into participating in a sting operation on some drug pedlars that actually ends up putting him higher up on the crime ladder. She has to go to prison so she can't spill the beans and she vows revenge.This is some pretty awful stuff. It has all the elements of other W.I.P. flicks with an interesting difference. No dyke guards for these ladies. All the guards here are male. They are stupid and exceedingly cruel. Some of the harshness they dish out to the ladies made me uncomfortable. And there's barely a brain cell working in the script either. Our heroine, Matsu, is tough. She can take the crap being thrown at her. Yet she has revenge on her mind and you see nothing of any kind of plan she might be concocting to escape. She got away once with another prisoner only to get recaptured. The other prisoner was shot in the attempt and Matsu helps nurse her back and the two form a bond. This is one of the few nice elements in the film. When she does escape it's by taking advantage of a prison riot. And when she gets out, the revenge she exacts isn't at all clever. She just guns all the bad guys down one at a time.I suppose these movies have to be brutal, to some degree, by their very nature. But this was nasty. It was cheap too. The directing was hack. The sound mixing was awful. It just stunk to high heaven. I've seen a few American W.I.P. flicks and even the not so good ones (are there any good ones?) were much better than this.Unless you have to see every W.I.P. flick ever made, I'd give this a pass.",2,This Scorpion Has a Nasty Sting,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,1939,"['Maybe', 'was', 'was', 'Japanese', 'Maybe', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'enough', 'reviews', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'W.I.P', 'flick', 'thought', 'was', 'walking', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Wrong', 'exploitation', 'pure', 'simple', 'only', 'thing', 'interesting', 'was', 'thought', 'kinds', 'flicks', 'were', 'purely', 'American', 'phenomenon.Here', 'scoop', 'heroine', 'locked', 'up', 'prison', 'being', 'duped', 'detective', 'boyfriend', 'participating', 'sting', 'operation', 'drug', 'pedlars', 'actually', 'up', 'putting', 'higher', 'up', 'crime', 'ladder', 'go', 'prison', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spill', 'beans', 'revenge.This', 'pretty', 'awful', 'stuff', 'elements', 'other', 'W.I.P', 'flicks', 'interesting', 'difference', 'dyke', 'guards', 'ladies', 'guards', 'here', 'are', 'male', 'are', 'stupid', 'exceedingly', 'cruel', 'harshness', 'dish', 'ladies', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'barely', 'brain', 'cell', 'working', 'script', 'either', 'heroine', 'Matsu', 'tough', 'can', 'take', 'crap', 'being', 'thrown', 'revenge', 'mind', 'see', 'nothing', 'kind', 'plan', 'might', 'be', 'concocting', 'escape', 'got', 'away', 'once', 'prisoner', 'only', 'get', 'recaptured', 'other', 'prisoner', 'was', 'shot', 'attempt', 'Matsu', 'nurse', 'back', 'two', 'form', 'bond', 'one', 'few', 'nice', 'elements', 'film', 'When', 'escape', 'taking', 'advantage', 'prison', 'riot', 'when', 'out', 'revenge', ""n't"", 'clever', 'just', 'guns', 'bad', 'guys', 'down', 'one', 'time.I', 'suppose', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'brutal', 'degree', 'very', 'nature', 'was', 'nasty', 'was', 'cheap', 'too', 'directing', 'was', 'hack', 'sound', 'mixing', 'was', 'awful', 'just', 'stunk', 'high', 'heaven', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'American', 'W.I.P', 'flicks', 'even', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'ones', 'are', 'there', 'good', 'ones', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'this.Unless', 'have', 'see', 'W.I.P', 'flick', 'ever', 'made', ""'d"", 'give', 'pass']",Female Prisoner #701 - Scorpion
803947,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B0001FVEDG,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","Based on a graphic novel, ""Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion"" is about a woman, Matsushima (or Matsu), who had been used by a corrupt cop to infiltrate the yakuza.  She is sent to a women's prison where she is just brutalized in so many ways!  Because of her many transgressions within the prison, including an escape (at the very beginning of the movie), she becomes the scourge of the other women inmates who are punished together for what Matsu does.  She is an extremely hardened woman, strong and nearly unflinching.  She is also hell-bent on revenge on the cop.  I don't want to give away too much.First, Meiko Kaji has to be one of the MOST stunning Japanese actresses!  She is best known for being Lady Snowblood in the movies/sequels of the same name.  She is also in the sequels of this movie.  I've only seen parts of ""Lady Snowblood.""  Her face is perfect, and she would just about put any modern Japanese actress to shame in similar films for her ability of not uttering a word and using facial expressions.  I would give her 5 stars for this film based solely on her.The movie is pretty over-the-top, but it is an exploitation flick.  It is a very stylized film, many times shot on sets that look like graphic novel backdrops.  The makeup and acting is cartoonish, especially by the prison guards, warden, and gangsters.The movie is filled with nudity, violence, blood, torture, two graphic rapes, stabbings, shootings, and did I forget to say nudity??  It is DEFINITELY for those who enjoy this type of film.Amazingly, the movie was made in 1972!  Other than some of the hairdos that many women have, the movie looks and feels like it was made in the late-1990s!  Amazing. The film is the first for the director, Shunya Ito.Although I am not fond of this type of movie (the women's prison exploitation flick), I did enjoy it for its highly stylized looks, the strong woman character who is unphased by anything, and the decent (but sometimes way over-the-top) acting.  It is another manga-based Japanese movie, and one has to keep that in mind while watching.  I did not like the fact that the movie is ""Not Rated"" and doesn't give reasons on the DVD (it is extremely violent and has oodles of nudity).  The DVD case also seems to assume that it is some type of detective movie, and it is NOT.  It is the women's prison exploitation movie (and probably the best one I have seen as far as look and story).4 1/2 of 5 Amazon stars (Amazon does not give 1/2 stars).  Worth a look, but NOT for the casual movie watcher!  NOT FOR CHILDREN BY ANY MEANS!  Excellent subtitle work (the black-framed white lettering that make it easy to read on light backgrounds).",4,"Women's Prison Flick from Japan - Violent, to say the least, but very good",1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,2666,"['Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Female', 'Prisoner', '701', 'Scorpion', 'woman', 'Matsushima', 'Matsu', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'infiltrate', 'yakuza', 'sent', 'women', 'prison', 'where', 'just', 'brutalized', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'many', 'transgressions', 'prison', 'including', 'escape', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'scourge', 'other', 'women', 'inmates', 'who', 'are', 'punished', 'together', 'what', 'Matsu', 'extremely', 'hardened', 'woman', 'strong', 'nearly', 'unflinching', 'also', 'hell-bent', 'revenge', 'cop', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much.First', 'Meiko', 'Kaji', 'be', 'one', 'MOST', 'stunning', 'Japanese', 'actresses', 'best', 'known', 'being', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'movies/sequels', 'same', 'name', 'also', 'sequels', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'parts', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'face', 'perfect', 'would', 'just', 'put', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'actress', 'shame', 'similar', 'films', 'ability', 'not', 'uttering', 'word', 'using', 'facial', 'expressions', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'film', 'based', 'solely', 'her.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'over-the-top', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'very', 'stylized', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'shot', 'sets', 'look', 'graphic', 'novel', 'backdrops', 'makeup', 'acting', 'cartoonish', 'especially', 'prison', 'guards', 'warden', 'gangsters.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'nudity', 'violence', 'blood', 'torture', 'two', 'graphic', 'rapes', 'stabbings', 'shootings', 'did', 'forget', 'say', 'nudity', 'DEFINITELY', 'who', 'enjoy', 'type', 'film.Amazingly', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1972', 'Other', 'hairdos', 'many', 'women', 'have', 'movie', 'feels', 'was', 'made', 'late-1990s', 'Amazing', 'film', 'first', 'director', 'Shunya', 'Ito.Although', 'am', 'not', 'fond', 'type', 'movie', 'women', 'prison', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'did', 'enjoy', 'highly', 'stylized', 'looks', 'strong', 'woman', 'character', 'who', 'unphased', 'anything', 'decent', 'sometimes', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'manga-based', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'one', 'keep', 'mind', 'watching', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'movie', 'Not', 'Rated', ""n't"", 'give', 'reasons', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'violent', 'oodles', 'nudity', 'DVD', 'case', 'also', 'assume', 'type', 'detective', 'movie', 'NOT', 'women', 'prison', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'as', 'far', 'look', 'story', '1/2', '5', 'Amazon', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'not', 'give', '1/2', 'stars', 'look', 'NOT', 'casual', 'movie', 'watcher', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'CHILDREN', 'BY', 'ANY', 'MEANS', 'Excellent', 'subtitle', 'work', 'black-framed', 'white', 'lettering', 'make', 'easy', 'read', 'light', 'backgrounds']",Female Prisoner #701 - Scorpion
